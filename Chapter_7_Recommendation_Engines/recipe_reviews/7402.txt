After reading through 4-5 pages of the reviews, I consolidated the most referred alterations to this recipe to: 1) using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar  2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract  3) adding 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (I squeezed out most of the juice before adding it, I didn't want any extra fluids in the cake)  4) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg  5) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon  6) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. The result came out incredibly delicious - the cake was very flavorful and moist.   For the frosting, I only used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar, and it was more than sweet enough, with a nicely balanced cream cheese vs. sweet flavor. If I would change anything again, I would use less pecans - it's a bit too nutty for my personal tastes. Also, I followed another reviewer's suggestion of grating the carrots with the large grater side (the one you use for cheese) so that you don't end up with a bunch of carrot mush and juice that can't be used. Will definitely make again! This is probably the best carrot cake I've ever had.

I chose this recipe specifically because it did not contain pineapple. It was wonderful just as written. (stepping on my soapbox)I think that a recipe should be reviewed for it's own merits with minimal changes. Rating a recipe that you have made many changes to messes up the rating system. You are not rating the listed recipe...you are rating your own! Go ahead and submit it!(stepping down now..thanks lol)
That said, I forgot to pick up pecans, but added some finely chopped hazelnuts I had on hand. : )

This is a great recipe.  Some other reviewers had problems with the center falling-these tips may help.  Cakes will sink or fall because of the following 1.Overbeating-too much air is incorporated 2.Underbaking- oven temp is too low or too short a baking time 3.Over or under measurement of ingredients 4.Using too small/large of baking pan 5. Make sure your oven temp is correct-preheat for at least 30 min. and check to make sure your oven is heating properly by using an oven thermometer for accuracy and finally, only open your oven door if you have to and then make sure 3/4 of the cooking time is up. Happy baking everyone!

This is just my humble opinion,  but I think it's very rude of people changing the recipe so much and then bragging about it like it worked out better than the one given.  I don't understand why people make so many changes to the recipes on this site.  It's out of control and almost seems like people want to one up the person putting the recipe on the site just to show they could do it better.  I have not made this recipe yet but I will tomorrow, without all the brown sugar, without the change in oil, without the applesauce, etc.  Post your own recipe instead of making these unneeded changes.

'Steps up on soap box'.  First of all I wish people would stop changing the entire recipe then giving it 5 starts.  I tried this recipe as is, and it's not good. I don't have time to go through 300 reviews and change all that needs to be changed.  I want to just find a recipe that is rated highly for it's own merrit.  I just wasted time and money on a cake that is not good.  When you rate something high, only after changing it, you're rating "YOUR OWN RECIPE", not the one that is here.  I'm all for experimentation, I just ask that people then post their experiment as their own recipe, and let others rate it.  Sorry for the rant but this has happened several times on this site.

Great recipe.  It was my 1st homemade carrot cake & it turned out perfect.  I made a layer cake using 2 9"round pans & cooked at 350F for 35 minutes.

This recipe was incredible.  After a box mix went awry, I turned to this terrific site to find a scratch recipe and decided to try this one.  Scrumptious!  Like some other bakers, I made a few substitutions and additions:  instead of using 1 1/4 C oil, I used 3/4 C oil and 1/2 C applesauce; instead of 2 C white sugar, used 1 C white and 1 C brown; used walnuts instead of pecans and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I used 2 9-inch greased and floured cake pans.  I made this a week before Christmas, so I popped it into the freezer, taking it out to thaw the day before it was needed.  It was like it was fresh baked!  Then I made the frosting, using 3 C of confectioners' sugar instead of 4.  The flavor was heavenly and I still had some left over.  Everyone in the family gave rave reviews and had 2 pieces!  The cake was gone by the next day.  I will make this a Christmas tradition.

I made some subs: 1.5 cups brown sugar (no white), half cup oil and 1 cup crushed pineapple (drained) instead of 1 1/4 cup oil, 2.5 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 3 tsp vanilla, omitted nuts and frosting. I baked in two 9 inch round cakepans for 40 minutes instead of a 9x13 pan. The result was perfectly moist cake with terrific flavor, and less guilt! Next time, I'll double the recipe so my cakes can be a bit taller, and I'll add crushed walnuts...but I can't imagine it being much better than this. 

Suggestion: if you're using a box grater, grate the carrots on the 2nd largest holes (same ones you use to grate cheese). I made the mistake of grating on the next smaller size holes last time, and used 5 cups of carrots (and 1/2 cup oil - no applesauce). The carrot shreds were too small and too many, and a lot of carrot juice was produced. All that extra liquid caused my "cake" to be more like a thin layer of rubbery pumpkin pie filling, even after cooking for over an hour. So make sure your carrot shreds are quite large, so you don't end up with all that unwanted carrot juice.

Of all of the many reviews on the site for this recipe only a handful of people actually reviewed this recipe. Most changed the recipe and then, instead of submitting what was now a new recipe and reviewing that, posted a review based on the changes they made. This pretty much makes the review useless and frankly not very helpful. 

Since I wanted to review this recipe I actually made this recipe. It's a good carrot cake. Not the best I've ever had but pretty darned good. It could use a bit more spice. There. A real review of this recipe. Thanks to the small handful of others who actually reviewed this recipe as well.

I've tried many of the carrot cake recipes on this site (including ones that are overrated) and this one is the best one.  It is perfect.  For a whole week, i tried many of the cakes and out of them all, my co workers, family and friends loved this the best, I have to agree with them, it's that good.  I left the frosting out, it's fine plain.

I read all the suggestions below and rolled them together to make the following changes:  2 C White sugar, I substituted 1 C White & 1 C Dark Brown.  I used 3-1/4 C Carrots (2 pounds) and 3/4 C vegetable oil and 1/2 C chunky applesauce (you may want to reduce to 1/3C if using the extra carrots - it was almost TOO moist!) and 2-1/2 teaspoons cinnamon - it was incredible!   I did make a 2 layer 9 inch round in dark metal pans, so I reduced temp to 335 and cooking time was about 38 minutes.  For the icing I found 3 cups of sugar to be perfect and I used lowfat cream cheese - you couldn't tell the difference!  I did forget to flour the pan, so I had a hard time getting it out of the pan - you may want to consider parchment on the bottom as well, it was a bit sticky to remove, but I could paste together with icing.  Made if for my mother's birthday - everyone raved!  I did one layer with nuts and one without and cut in half and put the nutless cake as half the 2 layer cake and the nut cake the other half (I used walnuts, much better).  Definitely a keeper!

this is the best carrot cake i have tasted in my life! it was absolutely delicious. and it was my first time making a cake from scratch. no more store bought cake for me. and it was guilt free. for those who are health freaks like me and still want a tasty treat i made some changes. i added in 1 cup of raisins. i also substituted applesauce for all of the oil and the cake was still very moist, and i used egg subsitute. i then used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. for a more "spice cake" taste, i used ground cloves, nutmeg, allspice, and cinnamon. i didn't use the frosting recipe that was given. instead i used the fat free cream cheese frosting which can be found on this website as well. for those who had trouble with the middle sinking in i would suggest not over-mixing the batter and leaving very small lumps. otherwise with these changes the cake is fat-free except for the nuts that you add in. enjoy!

Exceptional!!!  My family hovers in the kitchen when I set out ingredients to make this cake.  So after making it 3 times, it is time to write a review.  First let me state that this is a wonderful carrot cake recipe EXACTLY as written.    But to personalize the recipe I decided to experiment.  Based on other reviews:  upped the cinnamon to 2.5 tsps, added 1 tsp of nutmeg and 1 tsp of allspice, increased the carrots to 4 cups and the vanilla to 3 tsps.  Phenomenal!!!

I made this cake for my son's first birthday party a few days ago and it was a hit!!!  I too, made a few changes that really made this cake great.  I used 3/4 cup oil plus 1/2 cup applesauce instead of the full amount of oil, I used 1 cup each white and brown sugar and also added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  As for the frosting, I reduced the powdered sugar to 2 1/4 cups.  This recipe was delicious and I am sure would be with or without any of the changes mentioned above.  In fact, I think I am going to go eat another leftover piece right now :)!!  Thanks Tammy!

Great foundation recipe. I, like most people, made some slight altercations, but it's great just as is -- other than one thing: the baking soda. People who don't understand leavening agents like to throw in both baking powder and baking soda, but baking soda needs an acidic component in order to react; otherwise, you're left with a cake that sinks in the middle and a bitter flavor. There's no acidic component in this cake. With a big recipe like this, that bitter flavor will be mostly lost, but you still won't get the reaction you need. If you use an acidic component like a 1/2 cup of applesauce or crushed pineapple in place of some oil, or a 1/4 cup of honey in place of some white sugar, then the baking soda is fine. If you want to leave the recipe as is, I'd recommend using four teaspoons of just baking powder. Usually, more baking powder is needed when substituting for baking soda, but this recipe already called for plenty.

For people people who are having problems with all of the juice created from finely shredding the carrots, I recommend using some golden raisins, which I think are great in carrot cake, and mixing them with the shredded carrots. I use one cup. They soak up nearly all of the liquid and become nice and plump.

I thought this carrot cake was okay, nothing spectacular though.  I made it for my husband for his birthday, he LOVES carrot cake, and he thought it was just ok too.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than baking it in a Wilton 8x3 round pan.  It gave a nice two layer look, without leveling and stacking two layers.  I had the same sink hole in the center other reviewers commented about, although it wasn't noticable once frosted. The cake itself had a baking powder or soda taste.  Other reviewers had commented on this too, so I made sure it was mixed thoroughly, but not mixing it well enough wasn't the problem.  After looking at other carrot cake recipes, I think this one may use too much, or the wrong proportions.  Many of the others call for 2 tsp. of baking soda only, this one uses 2 tsp. each of baking soda and baking powder.  The frosting was wonderful, very rich.  I will definately use the frosting part of the recipe again.  This cake is worth the time, however, it just wasn't as wonderful as I had hoped for.  I think I'll try another recipe next time.  Thank you for the recipe though.

Why does everyone alter the original recipe and rate it?  It's misleading. Submit your own recipe.  With almost every recipe people change ingredients so that it's not even the same recipe anymore, it's frustrating.  Anyway without a picture for this one it doesn't state what kind of pan to use.  I prefer a layered carrot cake.

AS IS!!!!  Absolutely scrumptious and sooo moist!  I did make it in a springform pan and cut in half to make a layer cake with icing in between.  I made it for my son's 21st with carrots picked from my garden.  Definitely a keeper!  And for those of you who made all those changes, shame on you!  Yours were completely different recipes and you should not rate this recipe according to the changes you made.  Submit your recipe and let others rate your recipe and leave this one alone!

My family just finished testing this cake. They all give it five stars and I have some picky eaters! It was very moist and absolutely perfect. I did not change a single thing about the recipe except I used two nine inch round pans instead of a cake pan.  I had a little bit of a problem getting the cake out of the pans because of its moistness and density. Next time I make it I will not just spray the pans but also flour them and maybe that will help. Very, very good!

Excellent recipe!  I made this twice in one weekend (one for family and one for work) and both came out perfect; moist and delicious.  I agree with Noty's review.  This recipe is excellent if you make it as stated; it comes out perfect, not oily.  If you make adjustments and it does not turn out well, you can only blame yourself.

This is my mom's favorite recipe, and she is a carrot cake addict.  I love to make it for wedding cakes also, it always turns out perfectly.  I only use 1/2 cup oil and increase the carrots to 5 cups (makes up for the moisture lost in oil reduction and adds great flavor).  I increase the cinnamon and vanilla each by one teaspoon.  I also leave the nuts out of the frosting.  This recipe makes terrific cupcakes, sheet cakes, layer cakes, and larger tier cakes too.  Thank you so much for this delicious recipe!

This is a good tasting cake; however, it is a little oily.  I would recommend either decreasing the amount of oil to 1 cup or using applesauce. Update: I have made this cake quite a few times andX it always turns out great.  If you should half the recipe, cook it in a 9X9 pan for 30 minutes.  Also, if you cook the cake in a 9X13 pan, cook it for 40 minutes. Update 2: if using a jumbo muffin tin the cupcakes bake in 23 minutes.  The full recipe makes 14 jumbo cupcakes.  Update 3 (half recipe): Use 1/2 cup of oil and use 1.75 cups of shredded carrots.  This makes 11 regular sized cupcakes which took approximately 20 minutes to bake.  Update 3:  Made a traditional cake with this recipe (full recipe).  The cake baked for 25-30 minutes.

I chose this recipe because it is closest to the recipe I've been using for 30 yrs that I can no longer read lol. I made some of the changes other also did. 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce, half brown & half white sugar, adding nutmeg.  I've been baking all my life so my criticism of this recipe is more technical than flavorful.  For first time bakers mix the oil/applesauce & sugars together until almost dissolved, add eggs 1 at a time until well blended.  In a separate bowl "sift" the dry ingredients with a whisk and slowly add them to the wet ingredients. Then add vanilla.  Stir in carrots and nuts by hand. I, too, reduced the confectioners sugar by a cup but then I just barely had enough to frost 2 9 inch layers I made instead of a 13 x 9. That all said this is a very delicious cake and got rave reviews from everyone. This will be my go to carrot cake recipe I hope for the next 30 yrs. lol!

Absolutely wonderful. Don't change anything. My department at work went CRAZY over it. I thought 1 and 1/4 cups of oil seemed like a lot but it just made the cake so moist and tender (Not greasy, trust me). Even more important - Don't listen to bad reviews from people who didn't follow the recipe! They're giving their own recipe a bad review at that point, not this one. Also, remember that ovens are different. Check on the cake a few minutes early if you think you need to. The second that toothpick is clean, it's done.

I have made this cake for my husband every year for his birthday since we started dating. He loves it. These are the modifications I make based on other reviewer's suggestions: 1) Cut down the vegetable oil to 3/4 C  and add in 1/2 C applesauce, 2) change sugar to 1 C white sugar and 1 C packed brown sugar, 3) increase cinnamon to 3 t, 4) add 1/2 t nutmeg, 5) add 1 C drained crushed pineapple. I also take out all nuts, but that's more of a preference. Instead of grating the carrots like you would grate cheese, I typically use a peeler and peel the carrots down to their core and then chop the thin peeled strips. You don't lose a lot of the carrot moisture this way and the carrots are nicely featured. Enjoy!

Wow this recipe is the one, I can finally stop searching - thank you!  No changes made.. No need for crushed pineapple, it was moist enough on its own and you can really taste the carrots. Why do you rate a recipe if you've made five hundred thousand changes - submit your OWN recipe then.  Stop the madness! lol

Very delicious!  I put this in two 8" round pans, and they overflowed a little bit, so next time I will use two 9" pans, or maybe I will purchase 8" pans with 2-inch sides (mine are about 1 1/2 inches high).  Thanks!

After reading through the reviews, here's what I did : 1) used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 3) adding 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (I squeezed out most of the juice before adding it, I didn't want any extra fluids in the cake) 4) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 5) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 6) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce 7) . The result came out incredibly delicious - the cake was very flavorful and moist. For the frosting, I only used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar, and it was more than sweet enough, with a nicely balanced cream cheese vs. sweet flavor. I also added 2 tablespoons of lime juice to the frosting mix, which gave it a nice tanginess. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of grating the carrots with the large grater side (the one you use for cheese) so that you don't end up with a bunch of carrot mush and juice that can't be used.  This is the best carrot cake I've ever had.

Great recipe! I too made some substitutions and it came out very moist, delicious and not at all oily.  I used 3/4 C applesauce and decreased the oil to a 1/2 C, and substituted 1 C of the white sugar with 1 C of brown sugar.  Added a smidge of nutmeg and ground cloves.  As for the frosting, I didn't have enough powdered sugar, so I changed things a bit.  I only added 2 cups of sugar instead of 4, and it was pretty runny so I whipped an 8oz tub of Cool Whip into it.  It actually came out light, fluffy and delish! I'll be doing this again.

I think it is inconsiderate to rate this cake a 5 star and then say how you changed it.  How fair is that, it has thousands of reviews are they all different? Come on people this is Tammy's cake I dare you to submit your cake with changes and see what ratings you get or how much you like others changing your reciepe!

Great base but definitely needs adjustment. Overpowering amounts of sugar, cinnamon and pecans destroy the subtle tastes and could easily leave the blind taste-tester wondering if it's just a spice cake with butter icing.

Instead of 2c white sugar, I use 1-1/4 c loosely packed light brown sugar. Instead of 1-1/4 c oil, which I find too much to consume in one cake, I used 3/4 c oil (peanut oil) and 1/2 c apple sauce. I added 4c of carrot, grated with a course cheese grater. 2 tsp cinnamon overpowers the carrots and leaves a burning sensation in the throat, so I reduce to 1 tsp. I wouldn't recommend additional vanilla, cinnamon or nutmeg, because it just overpowers it.

Baking soda works as a rising agent when combined with acid so I found it odd there's no particularly acidic ingredient in this recipe, so I added 4 slices pineapple, crushed and drained.

4 c sugar in the icing is way too much, I reduced it to 1/2 c to let the lovely cream cheese flavour come through, and I eliminated the nuts and butter.

To those having problems with the centre caving in, I would suggest having all your ingredients ready beforehand, and add the baking powder and soda at the end. Baking soda starts rising immediately and if it's added before you've grated your carrots or chopped your pecans, it will have used and lost some of its rising abilities before going in the oven.

I followed this recipe exactly and was quite disappointed with the flavour. To be fair, the texture was nice, crisp on top, moist inside, but the taste of Baking Soda was overpowering everything. I'm really surprised after reading so many rave reviews. Is there something I don't understand? Is Carrot Cake meant to taste of baking soda?

A wonderful, "true" old-fashioned carrot cake. (no pineapple!) I DID modern it up a bit by replacing half the oil with applesauce. I had a special request from a birthday boy for carrot cake LAYER CAKE! I only have 8" rounds so I poured the extra batter into a loaf pan and all came out fine in about 45 min. I would suggest 9" rounds if you want a layer cake! Big cake. Plenty of batter, plenty of icing! Thanks!

I have made this twice now, but I have adapted it to be Gluten Free and dairy free.  It was incredibly good.  if you are a GF eater like my husband, this will make your jaw drop!  In place of the 2 cups of flour, Here is my GF mix i use: 1/3 cup almond flour (cheap at trader joes or you can grind your own) 2/3 cup brown rice flour, 1/3 cup white rice flour, 1/2 cup tapioca flour, 1/6 cup of sweet sorghum flour or sweet white rice flour. (this is a staple GF mix that i have used to replace the wheat flour in other recipes, i keep a big tupperware of it already mixed in the fridge so all i have to do is take out two cups of my "GF mix".  Beyond the flour, the other adjustements i did were to follow what other reviewers have suggested, cutting the oil to 3/4 cup and using 1/2 cup apple sauce. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white. added a pinch of nutmeg, about 1/2 cup of crushed pineapple (drained of liquid- i think next time i'll add more it was hard to tell it was there.) and then a mix of chopped pecans and walnuts.  I'm telling you, this was the best cake we've had in a long time.  I served it to 8 adult for my husband on his birthday, he is the only Gluten free one, but everyone loved it.  No one could tell it was GF which says a lot right there!  oh, also for the frosting to keep with the dairy free theme, i used "tofutti" a cream cheese made from tofu.  I made a much smaller portion that the frosting recipe with this cake, and just drizzled it over the cake.

I have never made nor tried carrot cake before. This was very easy to make and turned out delicious! I followed gneebeanie suggestions although I did not add the crushed pineapple. I think I would add 1C. oil and 1/2C. applesauce the next time as I thought it could be a bit moister.  I was told by my friends that this was the best carrot cake they had ever had! This is a definite keeper!

A little taste of heaven...one of the best cakes I've ever eaten.

TIP:  The icing looks much prettier if you finely chop pecans beforehand and sprinkle on top of the cake AFTER spreading.  Oh, and one cup of sugar for the icing will suffice.

Although it was difficult to refrain from making ingredient changes based on all the advice from previous reviews, I ultimately decided to stick to the original recipe. It is absolutely the most delicious, moist, flavorful, perfect carrot cake! Nothing needs to be added or taken away or substituted. Made this recipe as cupcakes for the Hubster's birthday since he requested carrot cake, and we absolutely loved them! The frosting is FABULOUS! I halved the recipe and it made 12 decadent cupcakes (baked at 350 for 20 minutes) with just the perfect amount of frosting. Thanks you so much, Tammy, for an awesome recipe! :)

PLEASE, SOMEONE TELL ME WHAT I DID WRONG!! I made the cake exactly as the recipe states, put in 2 9" round pans. It boiled over the sides, which isn't so bad, but when I took it out of the oven the middle of both cakes where sunken in. I am sure it is baking error, but not sure what it could be. Otherwise, the cake tasted great!!

Very good cake. I generally don't like carrot cake because of the "extras" that go in it. I made this cake and left out the pecans and it was great. I also added a few more sprinkles of cinnamon for extra flavor. I will definitely make this one again.

This recipe is so good!  I don't consider myself a "baker," but it turned out great.  I made the modifications suggested by S.Warren, which are: instead of using 1 1/4 C oil, I used 3/4 C oil and 1/2 C applesauce; instead of 2 C white sugar, used 1 C white and 1 C brown; added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. When making the frosting, use 3 C of confectioners' sugar instead of 4.  The cake and icing were perfect.  Thanks!

Very soft and moist even better after keeping for 1 day! I added some nutmeg and used the cream cheese II recipe but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I made this into 21 medium cupcakes(abt 2.5 inch diameter) baked for 30mins at 180 degrees C. Initially I found it to be abit sweet but after keeping overnight the sweetness has reduced and it is just right. These cakes are super soft so let them cool before attempting to remove from the pan otherwise it falls apart. After cooling they will be firmer but still very moist. I did not have a problem with the appearing greasy. Be sure to beat the liquid ingredients well so that the egg and oil is well blended and you shouldn't have a problem. I only had double acting baking powder on hand and I found that the second tray that I baked turned out better and rose more evenly after the mixture had time to sit for about 30 mins. The first tray I baked immediately did not rise as evenly and had some pockmarks on the surface. Not a big issue since I covered them with frosting. I would make this again but probably reduce the baking soda and baking powder abit.

I'm giving this four stars because, despite the fact that the product of my baking was the best carrot cake I've ever tasted, I made several changes to the recipe at the suggestion of other reviewers. I replaced the recommended amount of oil with 1/2 cup of oil and 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce, and substituted 1 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar. I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1 cup of golden raisins. For the frosting, 2 cups of confectioner's sugar was plenty. I had to bake the cake for an hour, but that could be because of the insulated pan I was using.

I decided to make carrot cupcakes - everything is better bite-size! The recipe yielded about 24 yummy cupcakes. Watch the baking time, though, they only took about 20 minutes. Enjoy!!

my first carrot cake attempt and i'm pleased with the moist and tasty flavor. i made some changes though - separated the eggs and beat whites till stiff and fold into complete batter at the end, used 3/4 melted butter and 1/4 cup applesauce, used 1/4cup less sugar (and mixed in some brown sugar too), 1.5tsp cinnamon and added 1/2tsp nutmeg.  for the frosting i reduced sugar to 2 cups. i find the frosting makes way too much though.
i also omitted the nuts as i don't have them on hand... i will make this again, and with nuts too!

Excellent and easy recipe! It was a hit, I can't wait to make it again!  Just an fyi...the icing recipe makes a huge amount of frosting.  If you're not going to layer the cake then you may want to rethink the amount of the ingredients.

The icing calls for 4 cups of icing sugar!!! I found this to be a lot. I tried it with 3 cups and it is still very sweet. I would even suggest reducing the amount of icing sugar by one half!

This is the best carrot cake recipe I've found so far. My children often request this for their birthdays (sans nuts). I use a 16oz bag of baby carrots and shred them in the food processor, then give them a light chop so there are no big long strips. My children actually prefer this with half whole wheat flour (for flavor...not health reasons, we seem to like the complexity that it adds). I also add another teaspoon of cinnamon. I usually make a three layer cake, lining the pans with parchment paper and then frost with a cream cheese frosting with less sugar. The sweetness in this one is overwhelming to my family. We like a bit of the tang from the cream cheese to compliment the sweet cake. ****My professor at culinary school suggested repacing some of the oil with melted butter, I used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup melted butter last time I made it.....better than ever!  Thank you!

The bad news about this recipe is that once you make it, you'll be asked to bring it to every family event. The good news is that it's delicious. I use all the changes suggested in the review marked "most helpful." I just want to add that I always make these as cupcakes, baking at 350 for about 20 minutes.

I've tried this recipe four times and every time I do it sinks and splits.    I'm not new to baking, either.  My oven temp is accurate and I follow the recipe exactly as written.

Best recipe on this site so far!  I followed this recipe almost to a T and the cake turned out moist and wonderful!  The only change was that I added about 1/4 cup of raisins and did not add pecans to the icing.  The cake is moist, flavorful and tastes even better a day later once the flavors have properly soaked in.  This is also an incredibly easy recipe to make.  Two thumbs up!

I must have done something wrong.  It came out collapsed in the middle.  Just to be sure, I made it a second time and it came out the same.  It was too heavy and there is way too much oil in this recipe.  The flavor was just ok.

AMAZING!  I was asked to make a carrot cake for a family member's birthday.  Three of the six of us who celebrated (including myself) do not like carrot cake but we are all converts now!  It was fabulous!    I made a 9" 2-layer cake (baked for 35 minutes) and doubled the frosting recipe.    Thanks for this keeper!!!

I was looking forward to making this cake for my birthday.  I followed the directions specifically and it overflowed and was to thin in the middle.  There was no way I could cook it for 40 to 50 minutes.  It burned in the middle and messed up my oven.

This was excellent.  I  don't like my carrot cake too dense so the light fluffiness was perfect.  

I did make a few changes to the recipe.  Instead of white sugar I used all brown sugar and based on previous reviews I substituted the oil with only 3/4 C oil and 1/2 C applesauce.  I used my own homemade applesauce (Peel, core and slice 4 apples, add 3/4 C water, cover and bring to boil over medium heat for 15-20 minutes, then mash).  I added walnuts instead of pecans. 

I also didn't have any cream cheese so I didn't make the frosting but it still made a wonderful breakfast treat and was gone in a day.

I plan to make this recipe again soon with the frosting!

This is my husband's favorite cake but we always purchased one from a bakery.  So I was very intimidated trying this not only for him but for Christmas day with his family! The instructions were to the point and very easy to follow but most importantly it was an absolute HIT!! Everyone loved it especially my better half! I'd recommend this recipe to any and everyone! 


Sn: The middle took a little longer to cook than expected. I lowered the heat to about 250 degrees to let the inside cook without the  top getting over cooked.

Not sure what went wrong...I bake a lot and have never had anything turn out so bad. It was really oily and had no good flavor at all...I tried making cupcakes so maybe that contributed, but I would never make this again.

Yes, it is all that! Everything you want in a carrot cake. I like using brown sugar as do other reviewers. Here's my way to "grate" all those carrots. Peel and chop the carrots in chunks. Put 1/3 of them in the blender and cover with water about 2 inches above the carrots. Blend/pulse  until finely chopped then pour into a fine sieve and drain well. Repeat the the rest of the carrots. Voila!

Best carrot cake recipe ever!  People who don't usually like carrot cake LOVE it.  I make cake and cupcakes with this recipe.  Cupcakes cook for about 25 - 30 minutes and make a ton of them, medium sized about 30 cupcakes.  I add more spices because I like it spicy, about 3 tsp cinnamon, about 1/2 tsp allspice, and about 1/4 fresh nutmeg.  I also use less sugar for the icing about 3 cups but I start with 2 cups and taste it until it is just right.  This icing is a HUGE hit with everyone, even people who don't usually like cream cheese icing.  The cake is really moist and I have always used parchament paper so I have no problems getting the cake out of the pan.  Best carrot cake recipe ever!!!!

I made this carrot cake for the first time on 09/25/07.  I took the suggestion of others and modified the recipe by reducing the oil to 3/4 cup, adding 1/2 cup of apple sauce, reducing the white sugar to 1 cup and adding 1 cup of light brown sugar.  I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I did not add pecans or any nuts to the cake or frosting.  The only change I made to the frosting was reducing the cofectioners' sugar to 3 cups.  I chose to cook the cake in 2 9" round cake pans to make sure there wasn't any problems with the cake cooking through in the middle.  It came out perfect!  I would consider myself more of a beginner level cook!

Excellent recipe - the cake tastes even better the next day!  I followed others' suggestions and reduced oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce.  I added finely chopped walnuts instead of pecans.  For personal preference, I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups (using 1 cup brown) and added another 1/2 cup grated carrots.  For the frosting, I halved the recipe (using 2 cups conf. sugar), and I didn't find it to be too sweet.  It was more than enough to frost the top of the 13 X 9 cake.  Next time I will further reduce the oil in the cake and add more applesauce - and perhaps try using some egg whites instead of whole eggs?  This is truly the best carrot cake I have made.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!    -Reena

Yummy. I made a few minor changes here and there (including seperating the wet and dry, them folding the wet into the dry via quick bread method for a more delicate cake), omitted the pecans, replace 1/2 of the sugar with brown sugar, and used a different frosting recipe, but it still turned out great! Thak you.

This cake recipe did not work.  I followed the instructions perfectly.  I'm so dissapointed because it was a waste of my time and energy, not to mention my ingredients.  It rose too high in a 9x13 pan and was too moist and sunk in the middle!

This is by far the best carrot cake that I've ever made - moist, flavourful, no funky additions - perfect for the carrot cake purist.  It tastes like an actual carrot cake, not a spice cake or a sort-of-fruit cake.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, but used the full amount of oil (did not substitute applesauce) as I wanted to ensure that the cake was very moist.  It was, and next time I'll use half applesauce and half oil.  I made a layer cake (two 8 inch pans) and used less sugar for the icing.  I also used walnuts in place of pecans.  Terrific cake, and one that I'll be making again soon!

Excellent cake for a basis to put your own spin on it...did not fall in the middle like some reported, but that is because someone usually over-beats the cake batter.  Put it in a 13x9 pan and it baked beautifully in 40 minutes...When making cakes with lots of spice, I usually split the sugar between white and light brown...gives the cake depths of flavor...usually, I add more vanilla (homemade, of course), cinnamon, allspice, ground cloves, and nutmeg to put it over the top.  As a professional private caterer, I must make sure that the majority of people who eat my food are satisfied...This cake will do that!  Baking IS a science...but the flavors are up to the individual.

This is a great recipe to modify to make healthier while maintaining the flavor of the carrot cake. Instead of 1 1/4C oil, I used 1/2C of oil and 1 mashed banana. The recipe has all the fat it requires from the 4 eggs. In fact I have even used 3 eggs before and it still turns out moist and delicious. I use 2C of whole wheat flour (you can't tell) and about 1/4C-1/2C of ground flax. In addition to the cinnamon, I added about 1-2 tsp of cloves (to my liking). I also had 1/2 a zucchini left in teh fridge so I also grated that in there (ususally I don't include it but yesterday I thought why not!). I found that using 1 1/2C of sugar was plenty sweet already so I may decrease that by 1/4C since the banana was very ripe. I should also mention I used granulated cane sugar with a few drops of molasses instead of the while sugar. Brown sugar gives it more depth so using the cane with the molasses will get you there while using a higher quality of sugar. So with this carrot cake, you can sure get your serving of fruits and vegetables and yet make it healthy. These modifications can help you cut serious calories, increase your fibre intake, and still using high quality ingredients. I always get compliments on this cake and ladies in the office find it a perfect treat without the guilt.

After reading many reviews from others, I have decided to do the following:  •	substituted oil content with 1/2 cup of Applesauce & 1/3 cup of oil. •	reduced sugar to 1 cup of brown sugar & 1/2 cup of white sugar. •	added a additional tsp of vanilla, a can of crushed pineapple & 1/2 cup of raisins.  I baked mine for 35 minutes as cake tester came out clean. As for the frosting, I halved the recipe and only used 1 cup of icing sugar to reduce the overall sweetness and save some CAL! My cake came out beautifully without sagging, but it was too moist and lacked the usual cake fluffiness. It's yummy though but still way too sweet for us. A 4-star for now but next time I guess I'll just reduce total sugar to only 1 cup, omit crushed pineapple and bake for additional 5 minutes... just to ensure that it is fluffy in the end! Thanks Tammy for the yummy recipe:)) UPDATES: Made this again on the night of Oct 27 09. I halved the recipe for an 8" round pan, reduced oil to 1/2 cup, subbed brown sugar for white with only 1 cup in total, added 1/2 cup of raisins (soaked in hot water, dried on paper tower and tossed with flour). Cake turned out to be so fluffy and yummy and not overly-sweet that I have immediately regretted of halving the recipe upon 1st bite! A 5-Star now...

Love this carrot cake!  Read all the reviews and condensed it down to these changes to make it as guilt free as possible, while adding a little extra spice: 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce (instead of 1.25 cup oil), 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white suager (instead of 2 cps white sugar), 2 tsp vanilla (instead of 1 tsp), 1.5 cups flour and 1/2 cup ground flaxseed or grounded LSA (instead of 2 cups white flour), 3 tsp cinnamon (instead of 2 tsp), and EXTRAS were 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.

I've never made carrot cake before this & it turned out great!  I did change a few things like some other people-1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup oil & 3/4 cup cinnamon applesauce, 3 tsp cinnamon and I substituted walnuts for the pecans.  I also agree that 4 cups of confectioners sugar is probably a bit much, since I ended up using only 3 cups and it was perfect!  I made a layer cake instead of a 9x13 and added walnuts to the sides.  I think next time I would make more frosting, since the amount the recipe called for is really for a sheet cake.  Otherwise, it was fantastic!  My husband is strictly a chocolate cake/chocolate frosting guy and he could not say enough about how great he thought the cake was!  I will definitely make this cake again!

This was my first time making carrot cake.  I made it for my step daughter's birthday and it turned out wonderful.  I made it the night before and it was very moist and yummy for the party.  I didn't add the pecans because she doesn't like them.  I also used one of the other recipes for the cream cheese frosting.  So I can't comment on the icing.  The one I used had a little less sugar and no pecans.  Will definitely make again. 

Instead of a 9x13 pan I backed in 2, 9inch round pans for approx 20-25min.  I was also careful not to over mix after reading some of the other reviews.  

As a side note, I appreciate it when other reviewers review recipes using the actual recipe.  It would be nice if others would make the actual recipe then give suggestions for if it was to dry for example. But it doesn't help me to know if I want to try a recipe out when the reviewers haven't either.   OK off my soapbox now.  thanks

5 for taste but the cake soesn't turn out well. i follwed the directions exactly and was dissapointed when the cake had a giant sinkhole in the middle.
Due to the order of the directions, the cake is likely to come out looking like a sinkhole. If you’re going to make this cake: mix all the wet ingredients in a medium bowl. Then mix all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Make a ‘well’ in the center of the big bowl (a hole that allows the wet ingredients to touch as much surface area as possible) and pour the wet ingredients into the well. Mix in with a spoon. Fold in carrots and nuts if you want any. Lumps in the batter are a good thing as long as they are peas sized or smaller. Treat this cake like a quick bread and don’t use an electric beater. This should stop the sinkhole effect. Good luck.

The Most Moist and Delicious Carrot Cake! I did double the recipe and did not add nuts to the mix. I put them on the side of the round cake. i also made these changes, 1) using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 3) adding 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (I squeezed out most of the juice before adding it, I didn't want any extra fluids in the cake) 4) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 5) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 6) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. The result came out incredibly delicious - the cake was very flavorful and moist. For the frosting, I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar.

This recipe is ok as is, but 5 stars with changes. I sub walnuts for the pecans, sub brown sugar for white, add 1/2 t. nutmeg, sprinkle the walnuts on (not in) the icing, halve the sugar in the icing, and sub applesauce for 1/2 c. of the oil. I like carrot cakes that are spicy and simple, so I avoid the recipes that have raisins, pineapple and other oddball additions. Oh, I also increase the cinnamon by 1 t., but I do that in virtually all my baking. A bundt pan is done in 45-50 minutes depending on your oven.

This carrot cake was a hit all around. I tried it once as written. Then the second time used 1 c white sugar & 1 c brown sugar (to replace 2 c white sugar) and 3/4 C oil & 1/2 C applesauce (to replace 1 1/4 c oil). I also added 8 oz crushed pineapple (drained) and 1/2 c dried currants, then baked as cupcakes (350 degrees F) for 18 minutes. I did need 1 1/2 times the written amount of frosting. Made 3 dozen delicious cupcakes.

WOW WOW WOW This was fantastic, once I followed the most suggested of reviews, I used 3/4 cup oil, and 1/2 c. applesauce, Increased the amounts of vanilla and cinnamon by one tsp.I also used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. For the frosting, 3c. of powdered sugar was fine for my liking. I tested this recipe today to make for Easter and I am SURE that it will be a hit. Oh, also I used 2-9inch cake rounds and the cake was done in just under 40 minutes ( about 37 )

This recipe was very dissapointing. After all of the 5 star reviews, I expected the cake to be perfect. Like some of the others, mine rose too high in the pan and then collapsed, leaving a rubbery mess. I followed the recipe exactly, including the pan size, and my oven is completely accurate. I never opened the oven door, and my levening agents are fresh. I wonder if the reason it didn't work out is that unlike the others, I DIDN'T modify ~ I noticed that others who complained about their cake falling also said the followed the recipe exactly as written.

I took gneebeanie's suggestions and added a few of my own personal things.  I addede 1/2 teaspoon of each - ground cloves and allspice as well as an extra 1/4 of nutmeg.  I like spiced carrot cakes.  I also added more applesauce than oil to cut down on the fattening factor.

The end result a super-flavorful and very moist cake.  The texture is great and the house smelled wonderful while the cake was baking.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

PS I did try the orginal recipe and it's great, too.  It's not as spiced as I like, but the flavor and moistness factor were awesome.  Oh, I always separate my egg yolks ad whites.  I whip the egg whites and add them last to give the cake an even more light texture.  It also helps your cakes rise taller!

Bake this cake and you will enjoy!

I changed the recipe up a little with the suggestions of others here, and a recipe book (see it at ldylvbgr.blogspot.com/)and it came out really good. I made these into 24 cupcakes, baked at 350' for 15 minutes. I added in some lemon juice to the frosting and it gave it a nice tang.

These turned out great!  The only change I made was to add 1/2 up applesauce and 3/4 cup vegetable oil instead of the whole amount in oil.  We also decided to make cupcakes, they were perfect cooked at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  It made 18 medium sized cupcakes and there was plenty of icing for all of them following the recipe.  These are going very fast and I am sure they will become a regular in our house.  Thank you

Fantastic carrot cake. This can easily hold up to cutting half the oil with applesauce, replacing the eggs with flax and water, and  using brown sugar in place of the white. Add nutmeg and crust the sides of the cake with a walnut or pecan and nutmeg mix and it's wonderful. Makes a nice 2 layer cake out of 2 9" to 10" round pans, baked for about 40 minutes.

I may have done something wrong, but the cake rose too much and never dried in the middle. I had to dump it in the garbage. What a waste! I'll try again to figure out what I did wrong. Maybe I should've used 2 pans instead of one.

Amazing cake! I had lost my recipe for carrot cake so I decided to try this one based on the positive reviews--and boy, I wasn't disappointed! It was so moist and flavorful. I substituted 1/4 C. applesauce for some of the oil and used walnuts instead, and it turned out superb.

Yummy!!! This was such a huge hit for Easter lunch. I did follow others suggestions and made the following changes:
1) use 1/2 c applesauce and 3/4 c oil
2) use 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar - this cake was very sweet and would suggest decreasing the total amount of sugar used by at least 1/2 c
3) add 8oz of crushed pineapple drained
4) use 1T cinnamon and 1/4 t nutmeg
5) use 4t vanilla

This came out great.  I am rating it 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons.  First, it came out a little too moist for my tastes, although my husband loved it.  This may be because I grated the carrots too small and they were a little mushy - I think next time I will follow the suggestion of using a larger cheese grater.  Second, the frosting was not as thick as I prefer.  I followed the recipe exactly with the following changes:  used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar, added an extra tsp. of vanilla and cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and used 3/4 c. canola oil and 1/2 c. applesauce instead of the vegetable oil.  For the frosting, I doubled the recipe and ended up with MORE than enough (I made a layer cake with 2 9.5 inch pans) and probably didn't need to do that.  For the doubled frosting, I used only 5 cups of sugar - would probably reduce by 1 cup next time.  I cooked at about 335 degrees for 35 minutes, and the cakes were cooked perfectly.

Update:  second time around I did not use the applesauce.  I bought 2 10oz bags of shredded carrots and chopped those in a blender, which was much easier than grating.  I also sifted the dry ingredients first.  I did not remember to check the bottom of the mixing bowl - remember to check this next time to make sure everything is well-mixed!  The cakes did not come out as "pretty" as last time but still taste wonderful.  I am changing my review to 5 stars. UPDATE: Made in 9x13 pan and it requires a large pan or overflows.

Just came back from a barbeque.  The cake turned out so well that I was not embarrassed to serve it, even without icing.  Scary though, not having a taste before serving it up to everyone.  Made it healthier by using half whole wheat flour, and added some flax seed meal as well. Used 1 c white, 1/2 c brown sugar.  Didn't even notice the extra sugar missing. Substituted oil with just 1/2 c olive oil and one and a half ground up apples, peels and all.  I actually used my newly purchased Cuisinart to make the whole thing.  First grated the carrots, set them aside, then popped the apples in to pulverize them, before adding all the wet ingredients directly into the bowl, including the carrots, and then all the dry ingredients were dumped on top in the bowl!!!, and the whole thing was then "processed."  Boy, do I love my new processor.  Baked only 35 minutes in my convection oven, and voila.  It looked much more even than my usual hand mixed version.  Did not add any walnuts.  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was AMAZING!!  I made it for my husband's birthday dinner and he loved it!  He's not really into frosting, so I skipped the cream cheese frosting and topped it with homemade whipped cream sweetened with honey.  It was so yummy!

Very, VERY good.  I did follow some other user recommendations with great success.  I used 1 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil instead of 1 and 1/4 cup oil.  I also used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  Finally, I make the frosting with only 3 cups of confestioner's sugar.  To make a prettier cake, I made it in a spring form pan.  This came out beautifully, however you will need to add about 10 minutes more to the cooking time.  Thanks.  This was a very nice Easter dessert

This was a miracle cake for my household! I can  never get my 5 yr old to eat carrots and even as she helped to grate the carrots she made faces, but with the finished product, she ate 4 pieces!!! A 'high 5' to you Tammy! I didn't find the cake to be oily at all, nor did it fall in the middle. I did leave out the pecans (allergies).

Update: Have now made this lower in calories by subsituting the sugar with Splenda and using applesauce in place of the oil. I also cut the icing ingredients in half and it was still enough for the cake. Very delish & friendly for those who count 'points'.

This cake has a good flavor and texture.  The icing is really very good and has a full rich flavor - but it is creamcheese!!  I omit the nuts from the icing as I loosely ground them up and press them into the sides - it looks really pretty.  You can also put a marzipan carrot on the top, or white chocolate shavings, or both - it really dresses this cake up to look very classy.  Also, I recommend baking this cake as two layers and icing the middle, and then the whole cake - put some nuts in the middle layer, and it's quite impressive when cut.
I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and used half applesauce, half oil, but I think you should use a little more oil than half as this cake was a little dry using half and half - but it could have been that I cooked the cake in layers and misjudged the oven temp.  Very good recipe to try though - not too expensive, and definitely cheaper than a bakery, while it looks and tastes just as good.

Very moist tasty cake. I added fresh grated ginger to carrots to add flavor and increased cinnamon just a bit, I use a vitamix so my carrots get pureed first rather than grated which provides a more uniform flavor and appearance.
I used almonds instead of peacans in cake and no nuts in frosting.
I omitted the butter from frosting and choose to use instead 2 8oz packages of light cream cheese and 2 cups sugar. My boys enjoyed licking the untensils after! 
Next time I will reduce fat more by using egg substitute and applesauce instead of oil. Decreasing the caloric value as much as possible is a must with this cake because it's just so good one can easily put on weight, you just can't stop eating it! lol
Great cake, exactly what I've been looking for! Thanks

I did not have a good experience with this carrot cake. It was VERY DRY and I regretted making it for a dinner party. It wasn't very pretty either. One final complaint: do not try and get the cake out of the pan 10 min. out of the oven. It's too hot and will crumble.

This is an great recipe. I've made this several times and it always comes out extremely moist (even when over cooked). I usually double the recipe for both cake and frosting, I cut 1-2 cups of the confectioners sugar and add more butter and cream cheese. It cuts the sweetnes and adds to the richness of the frosting.

I do not recommend this recipe at all. I did NOT alter the recipe at all. I made it exactly as written. I am not a beginner baker and have been baking over a decade. First of all, it comes out of the oven pretty unappealing:  very oily/greasy looking. The edges of the cake were more bubbly and the centre of the cake fell after while in the oven. My oven temperature is accurate, and all my ingredients are fresh, so I'm not sure why it happened. Not only that, it tasted like baking soda (my measurements were accurate), and weirdly also tasted like egg. I know that  I mixed my ingredients very well prior so there's explanation for the egg flavour.  The icing was delicious though I did use one less cup of icing sugar, but that's minor. Oh and, don't even think about trying to take it out of the pan after cooling only 10 minutes... what a nightmare. Even if you grease and flour the pan like I did, it still broke apart and made a huge crumbly mess. I'm made dozens of cakes over the years and never had issues flipping a cake out of a pan like this. I think there's issues with the amount of oil used in this recipe, some others have used applesauce and I think that's a good idea.

love this recipe.  Also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and substituted 1 cup of brown sugar for white sugar.  Other than that, followed the recipe verbatim.  Will definitely use this again.

FANtastic! My husband and I were so pleased with how this cake turned out. I did add a little extra vanilla and cinnamon, about 1/2 tsp more of each, and used 1/3 the fat cream cheese for the icing. The icing was about twice as much as the cake needed in my opinion so I did not use the entire amount. Bottom line I will absolutely be making this again in the future with the same tweaks. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cake the first time exactly as written, and at first taste the flavor was absolutely amazing. After a few seconds, though, the taste of baking soda at the back of my throat completely ruined the flavor of the cake. After reading over 100 reviews, I came across a post about baking soda needing an acidic agent to activate it, which is why you will see some of the reviews adding pineapple.

I made the cake a second time with the adjustments noted in the most popular review; 3/4 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown sugar, 3 tsp vanilla, 1 8-oz can crushed pineapple, and added 3 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. This cake was for a catering event, and the client wanted a 'healthy tasting' carrot cake; with these adjustments, everyone was raving about this cake.

This has to be the best carrot cake, I've ever had.  I made 24 cupcakes with this recipe.  Baked them at 350 for 20 mins or so..... Soooo yummy!!! :)  will definitely be making them again.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Except for the pecans in the frosting!

Made this cake for Thanksgiving and it was gone in no time even with other desserts to choose from.  My brother called me from Columbus and stated he didn't want a gift from me, he just wanted a cake for himself!!  It is a great moist cake without any changes. YUMMY!

I made this with modifications suggested by Gneebeanie because I wanted a really moist but not super sweet carrot cake.  Wow - this was a hit at Easter.  This was my first attempt at making this cake.  I made this in a 9x13 pan and there was more than enought frosting.  Would reduce by half next time.  Thank you!

This carrot cake received rave reviews from my family! We normally buy carrot cake from a local restaurant for my husband's birthday (their cake has been praised in many area newspapers), but this year I wanted to make it for him. I did do some things different: half brown sugar and half white sugar, added golden raisins, used almost 4 cups coarsely-grated carrots, reduced the oil to 3/4 c, and used applesauce for the other 1/2c, used 2 large eggs and 2 large egg whites. For the frosting, I used 4 cups powdered sugar and increased the cream cheese to 11 oz. This was enough to frost the two round cakes. Very Good!!

After reading reviews about this cake "falling" I descided to give it a try and it turned out FABULOUS! I followed the directions to a T and everyone is raving about it.  The only problem I had was it made too much frosting, but that just means I will make another one!  The recipe stated to use a 9x13 pan which I did, but I am thinking that if you make 2 rounds and then assemble the frosting would be a perfect amount.

I made this for my birthday because the reviews were so good and it was very similar to another recipe that I had.  UGH!  It was raw in the center after 1 hour 15 minutes.  (Do not have a problem with my oven and other baking.)  The part that did get done was okay and we picked at it.  Definitely removing this from my recipe box.

I have made this cake about a dozen times. The best cake I have ever had.  I do not make the frosting in this recipe. I use a frosting from Paula Dean on this cake.  I swear by it. Its the best. Not too sweet and you still have that nice flavor of the cream cheese.  Icing: 8-ounce package cream cheese, softened  1/2 cup butter or margarine, softened  2 cups sifted confectioners' sugar  1 teaspoon vanilla extract   To make the icing: Combine the cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Add the sugar and mix at low speed until combined. Stir in the vanilla and mix again. If you want a thicker and lighter frosting, I Folded in a whole tub of cool whip and put in fridge until ready to frost and serve.

Awesome!!! This was my first attempt at making carrot cake, and this recipe is the best! I did what some reviewers suggested and substituted half of the oil with applesauce (I just bought a small bottle of baby food) and it turned out great! Very dense, a heavy dessert, so definitely leave a lot of room for it! My mom even ate it for breakfast!

I don't know how this recipe has managed to get such good reviews.  It was bland, except for the overpowering flavour of vegetable oil.  It was spongy and greasy. I followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely terrible.

My birthday girls favorite cake is carrot and she flipped over this. I took everyone else's advice; cut back on the sugar, used applesauce in place of some of the oil, more vanilla, increased the cinnamon and added nutmeg. Wonderful recipe Tammy and thank you!!

I made the recipe AS IS, therefore my rating is accurate of the actual recipe and not my own version. I was excited to make this based on the reviews and boy was I disappointed. Not only did I waste a ton of materials, but the cake was almost inedible. I followed everything exactly and it tastes awful. Just a bland, tasteless cake. It resembles a mix of flour, water and sugar that was baked. FOR EVERYONE GIVING IT 5 STARS BASED ON THE 398570257039458 CHANGES YOU MADE, THANK YOU FOR MAKING ME WASTE MY GODDAMNED TIME. Please for the sake of everyone, RATE THE RECIPE AS IT IS, NOT YOUR OWN VERSION. !!!!!!!

Absolutly the best! I know some members don't like it when a good review includes some alterations but that it actually what I like so much about All Recipes. I made my cake a layer cake and instead of mixing the pecans into the icing I toasted them and pressed into the sides as another members picture showed.

This cake is phenomenal (and I *hate* carrots -- that oughta tell you just how darn good this cake truly is)!  Although the revisions suggested by others are also yummy (I've tried them as well), we prefer this cake pretty much just the way the recipe is written.  The only changes I make are to add an extra tsp of cinnamon to the batter and a bit of grated orange zest to the frosting.  I make either two or three round 9" layers (in my oven, approx. 40-45 mins for 2 layers and 30 mins for 3 layers).  I make 1-1/2 times the frosting so that we have plenty of that deliciousness to go with every bite.  The orange zest in the frosting is subtle and so complementary - doesn't compete with or overwhelm the flavor of the cake itself.  Once frosted, I sprinkle the remaining cup of chopped pecans atop the cake and press lightly onto the sides (using wax or parchment strips under edge of cake helps avoid goobering up the cake plate.)  Looks like something from a gourmet bakery, and it tastes far BETTER!  I suggest lining your cake pans with parchment, then greasing/flouring.  Because it's a moist cake, allow to cool nearly completely before turning out onto racks.  If necessary, refrigerate frosting for a while so that it's thick enough that your layers don't slide off one another (try a little dollop under bottom layer to "glue" it in place, too).  Tastes MUCH better as the days go by...I try to make at least a day ahead, if not two.  Thanks so much for this fabulous recipe! :)

This is the best carrot cake recipe I have ever made. I was a pastry chef for years and even the recipes from the hotels I worked in dont compare to this. The only change I made was a 1/2 cup of golden raisins for 1/2 cup of the nuts.

This was a big hit here with the family. Moist, mild flavor, not too sweet like I was afraid it might be with all the sugar. It wasn't fancy or loaded with a lot of stuff, but nonetheless it is carrot cake at it's best. I'm glad someone posted the tip about grating the carrots with the larger cheese sized holes as it came out perfect that way. The frosting was light, fluffy, and so creamy and had a great flavor. Not too cream cheesey, not too sweet. I followed the recipe as written. This got a high five from all of us here, Thanks for posting Tammy!

I promised someone at work for months that I would make him a carrot cake. I never really liked carrot cake myself because the first time I tried it, it was really dry, but after taking a bite of this, I have changed my mind about carrot cake!  
I substituted unsweetened applesauce for all of the vegetable oil in order to make it lower in fat and calories.  I also thinned the frosting with a little milk and drizzled it on the cake so that there wouldn't be as much frosting on it. 
This was a "smash hit" according to one of my co-workers which means it's amazing! 
This is a great recipe and I will be sure to make this again and again!

This is the perfect carrot cake. I used the cream cheese II recipe from this site but it would be great with no frosting at all. Very moist and a great flavor. Will be "my" recipe now!
UPDATED. I have used this SEVERAL times now. Sometimes with raisins instead, sometimes I even use the preshredded carrots from the produce isle and everyone that's tried it has asked for the recipe =)

I can't believe so many people rated this 5 stars, because I was one of the people that had a saggy middle in my cake. It was cooked all the way, but fell for some reason. I know my ingredients are all fresh, so who knows? Anyway, I couldn't give this cake any higher because it just didn't work for me.

This is a great recipe. I omit the pecans as a personal preference and put in a little more cinnamon. I've made it with just oil and found it to be a little greasy, so switched over to using 2/3 cup oil and 1/2 cup of grated apple, and that works just fine. I also use a mix of brown and white sugar-personal preference. Thanks for a yummy carrot cake!

I;ve been baking for years and have never had a cake fall before.  I thought maybe I did something wrong so I tried the recipe again and it fell in the middle again.  Quite frustrating after grating all of those carrots!  My husband loves carrot cake, so we still ate it.  I will try a differnt recipe next time, or try this recipe using applesauce instead of oil as some suggest.  Not a five star recipe in my book!

I also followed the someone's tip to use half the oil and use applesauce instead as well as added coconut. The applesauce really lightened this cake and everyone who ate this cake thought it was the lightest carrot cake they had ever eaten, it was gone in minutes. This is a keeper.

I loved this carrot cake. I had to send it to work with my hubby this morning to stop me from eating it all myself. I used half applesauce and half melted butter instead of oil, half whole wheat flour and a pinch of nutmeg. It was so moist and delicious. I think I might try making muffins with it next time. I also only used about 1 and a half cups of confectioners sugar in the frosting and it was great.

Its been years since I made carrot cake so I searched for the one with the most and highest reviews.  I can see why this cake has such rave reviews.  It was very simple to make, all ingredients were on hand which is important to me and it was basic enough for my 9 yr old son to do some hands on helping out.  BUT the best part of this cake is the taste....soooo good and the frosting...divine (maybe even a little too sweet, dare i say!)I will definetly hang on to this one.

This was phenomenal. It was so moist. Next time I'll do the suggested oil/apple sauce balance because it falls apart (not that I'm complaining too much). I only added 2 cups of sugar and that was plenty. Also, I folded 1 cup of crushed pineapples at the end before baking. Since this was a carrot cake, I substituted pineapple juice for lemon. Just tastes better IMO.

Tammy~  Thank you for a WONDERFUL recipe!  My whole family loved this cake.  I used 1/2 c cinnamon applesauce and 3/4 cup oil, 1 c white and 1c brown sugar and used Pampered Chef Cinnamon spice blend instead of just cinnamon.  I also decided to make a layer cake instead of a 9x13.  This is by far the best Carrot Cake I've ever tasted!

This was the best carrot cake I ever made.  I substituted applesauce for the oil to cut down on some calories, so I could add coconut to the recipe.  I also used 3-8" round cake pans and cooked for 35 minutes instead of 40.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with no changes at all, and it was amazing! Best carrot cake I've ever made. Thanks for this perfect recipe! Everyone in my family loved it (even my 7 year old who had to be forced to try it). It's so strange to me that so many people completely change then recipe, then rate it. If you've changed or substituted half the ingredients for something else, then you're not really rating this recipe at all. Just submit your own! Your version might be great, but it's a different recipe!

This is AWESOME! I did not use this cream cheese frosting recipe - it was for my son's first birthday - and I couldn't bring myself to put 4 cups of confectioners sugar in it. However, the cake was delicious and moist and didn't make it through the day. Everyone loved it.

I added raisins to this cake and coconut to the frosting and I think that they were welcome additions to the recipe.  This was really easy to make and it was very good but not out of this world.  Still, I would not hesitate to make it again if I needed an easy carrot cake recipe.

I'm only giving this three stars because I felt it needed changes. 
1. Half granulated and half brown sugar.
2. Half oil and half applesauce.
3. Raisins instead of nuts (could do both if you wanted).
4.  Added 1 teaspoon each of nutmeg and cloves and ½ teaspoon of allspice. MUCH BETTER.

I can't rate this recipe 5 stars, because I didn't make it as written.  I did however, test out three carrot cake recipes, and S.warren's changes made it the best. 

If you follow the modifications listed by s.warren's comment, it's a 5 star cake.  I'll copy and paste her directions here..."instead of using 1 1/4 C oil, I used 3/4 C oil and 1/2 C applesauce; instead of 2 C white sugar, used 1 C white and 1 C brown; used walnuts instead of pecans and added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg".  

The applesauce really cuts down on the greasy aspect.  Also, I am not a fan of pineapple taste or texture in my carrot cake.  So this is perfection.

Huge thumbs down. Followed recipe as written. Severely disappointed. Divided batter in half, but only good thing about this cake is the moisture. 

Texture: inside spongy & moist, outside dark brown and crunchy. 

Taste: overpowered by the abundance of oil and sugar. I can see the shredded carrots but cannot detect them one bit.

Frosting: too sweet. I tried cutting out 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, but still too sweet and not enough cream cheese taste.

I made 3 small changes but can still give the original recipe 5 stars because my changes weren't significant - I used half unsweetened applesauce / half oil, half white / half brown sugar, and doubled the frosting recipe but only used 4 cups sugar total - the full amount would have been way too sweet. The extra frosting wasn't actually needed, but really, one can never have too much cream cheese frosting in the house. I did leave out pecans as the author mentioned doing in the intro, no one here likes them. Everyone loves this cake and my 9 year old has requested it as his new birthday cake choice!

This was very good, I made it for my husband for his birthday cake since it is what he asked for.
I toasted some coconut and sprinkled it on top to make the icing look fancier.
Wasn't the very best carrot cake I've ever eaten but it was very good.

I love this recipe and have made it many times now. I add about 1.5 cups of raisins, and bake in a 9 x 13" pan. The frosting recipe makes considerably more than is needed for this single layer, and I don't use quite as much sugar as specified...about 3 cups is plenty for me. The cake is moist with lots of flavor.

so, i only give this four stars because when i baked it, it overflowed then sank flat in the middle. i figure its probably from using the recipie for cupcakes or the altitude but the frosting was great, i used it for another set of chocolate cupcakes i made.

DO NOT OVERMIX!!! I made the mistake of doing so and the cake sank in the center. I definitely recommend following gneebeanie's suggestions, but it's not required. If you're using this recipe for CUPCAKES, ONLY FILL MUFFIN PAPERS 1/2 FULL!!! If they're filled any higher than that, they will raise too high and overflow. Good luck!

I try a lot of Carrot Cake recipes as it is one of my favorite cakes!  I can say that I really like this one!  For the earlier comments on the cake colapsing, it is really important not to over mix the ingredients!  Also let the cake stand in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool!  The only thing that I modified was 1 cup fine sugar and 1 cup dark brown sugar and I grated some fresh ginger to give it a bit more flavor.  I added as well almost 4 cups of carrots.  This is a 'keeper'!

The changes I made were using chopped almonds (only in cake mix...not in frosting) instead of pecans and only 2 cups of confectioners sugar for the frosting. It turned out great and the frosting was perfect. I couldn't imagine using 4 cups of cs...too sweet.

Very good. I added some zucchini too. Used 1/2 applesauce and added crushed pineapple. Used 1/2 brown sugar, upped the vanilla. Next time, I would use a little less sugar, it's really pretty sweet, especially with the frosting. I'd make this again. We can't stop eating it. Made them into little mini cupcakes. Yum.

This cake is always a hit when I make it. It's moist and delicious.  I will say I didn't stay 100% true to the recipe and took the advice of a few other reviewers (substituting some applesauce, and brown sugar - and I think I added some spices that I thought would be yummy).  Either way, this is a fantastic foundation for a great carrot cake.  I have a recipe for a cream cheese frosting that I'm kind of partial to, so I skipped this one - but it looks like it would have been good :)

What a wonderful recipe!  Did use 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar instead of 2 cups white and 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce to cut the fat content.  Otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Loved it!!  Will definitely make it again!

Use only 2 cups of carrots and substitute the other cup for a cup of drained pineapples or dried coconut.
If only cutting out a cup of carrot and not adding pineapple or coconut increase the amount of sugar to 2 1/2 cups
Cut cinnamon to 1 teaspoon
Finally, for a prettier cake add the pecans to the already frosted cake and not directly to the frosting as stated in recipe

I wish I could give this like 10 stars! This was my first attempt at making a carrot cake for Easter. Nobody believed me because this was so incredibly good. This will be my only carrot cake recipe, my mother in law has already requested another one for her birthday!

Eh. I thought it was WAY too sweet. The texture was really good, and it smelled really good, but it was so sweet. The frosting was good but too thin. I will not be making this recipe again but will try another from this site. OR maybe I will make it again, but HALVE the sugar!

This recipe was right on. With no substitutions at all it was great. I made the recipe and remember I am a beginner baker and everything turned out just right. The portions was right and with the pecans it was awesome. The cooking time is right on spot. As long as you use the exact measurments of everything it will turn out okay. There are people in my family that are very picky eaters and they ate it up saying it was one of the best recipes they ever got to try. So go ahead and indulge and enjoy the recipe

Fabulous! I just made these moments ago. They are so great! I greased muffin tins and baked them for 25 minutes and they were perfect carrot cake muffins... almost too good. Like some others I made minor tweaks, ~ ~ ~

1 Cup White Sugar and 1 Cup Brown Sugar (Instead of the 2 Cups White Sugar) ~ ~ ~ 

3/4 Cup of Canola Oil and 1/2 Cup Unsweetened Apple Sauce (Instead of 1 1/4 Cup Vegetable Oil)
~ ~ ~
I also like spice, so I added a tiny bit more Cinnamon and 1/2 Teaspoon of Ground Cloves.
~ ~ ~
Even without the changes I'm sure they'd be good, but with the changes for me they were most delicious. Awesome recipe.

i have made this recipe about a dozen times. the first time i made it exactly as written and found it too oily/greasy for my tastes. from then on, the only thing i change is to half the oil and use apple sauce for the additional moisture. it comes out perfect every time and gets rave reviews. i would definitely recommend this recipe.

My mother and I really enjoyed this cake. It's very moist and not too dense or too airy. It has a nice balance. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I did not like the icing. The icing does not have a good consistency in my opinion, so I made my own which uses more butter than cream cheese. Also, for the cake I used half brown sugar and half white sugar and walnuts instead of pecans.

Holy Mama!  I just made this cake for a group of very serious dessert lovers and I am now a goddess.  Here's what I did to improve this recipe:  nothing, zilch, zero, nada.  Stand alone spectacular, nuts and all.  Tammy, I will never touch a thing.  Thanks so much for sharing this!  And, frankly, if you're commenting and adding pineapple or switching ingredients, you're talking about a different recipe entirely and should be listing it as a new recipe instead of rating the one that's posted.  Just sayin'. :)

I made this for my friend's birthday. It was devoured. I used 1c white sugar, 1c brown sugar. I always pulverize my nuts because I just can't stand chunky nuts in my cake, and I also added 3/4c of crushed pineapple (I squeezed out as much juice as possible and chopped it into finer pieces).  When you pour the batter into your pan, drop it once on the stove. This will get any air bubbles out of your cake and will help your cake not sinking in after you remove it from the oven. It's a trick that is proven. I accidentally forgot to add vanilla in the frosting, but nobody noticed.

I gave this one star because the system requires is, but I'm sorry, if it were allowed I just wouldn't give this recipe any stars.  I love carrot cake and so I had high hopes for this recipe based on the high rating.  I made the recipe as written, because I didn't want to review it based on modifications, but maybe I should have modified it!   First of all, during baking the batter spilled over the sides of the pan and all over the bottom of my oven. I managed to scrape it all up, put foil under and continue baking.  Once done the remaining cake was sunk in the middle, so there went presentation. The flavor is rather bland and the cake greasy.  I will not be making this one again, so much for my birthday cake!

The recipe is excellent as is with no substitutions or changes.  I made it for dessert for a Boyscout Court of Honor and everyone gobbled it up and went back for seconds.  The *only* thing I changed was in the frosting because I personally like a creamier less sweet flavor.  I used a full stick of butter, half the sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.

Yummy! I did like the others did; 1 cup wht sugar & 1 cup brn sugar, omitted the nuts from frosting, only 3 cups of sugar for frosting and cooked a little less...35min total. Ovens do vary and I didn't want the batter to get too dry.

SO GOOD!! I made this for my father on father's day now every time I come home he asks for it as does my boyfriend! I added another cup of carrots because I grated too much still came out amazing! Easy to make and very tasty! Also make cupcakes with this recipe cooked perfectly in 20 minutes.

This is AMAZING - AS IS! Do NOT make changes! I read another reviewers comments who said you can't give an honest opinion of a recipe when you make your own changes! This was wonderful. I had *several* people tell me this was the best carrot cake they had had in their lives!

This was disappointing to me. A little bland, and too oily for sure. I followed the recipe exactly, though, and normally I tweak them just a bit. With a few of the suggested changes it would have been great. More spice, applesauce instead of oil. Good start, though.

This cake was almost perfect- just a bit too sweet. I did use 1 c brown and 1 c white as suggested by others and may have packed the brown sugar too tightly, but still think only 1/2 c brown and 3/4 c white would be more than sufficient. Also, in the frosting I only used 1 c confectioner's sugar as that's all I had and that was just perfect. I like the flavour of cream cheese to really come thru, can't imagine how sweet it would have been with 3 or 4 cups! Only other changes were adding in fresh grated nutmeg and an extra teaspoon each of vanilla and cinnamon as recommended by others. For those with falling cakes, don't know if this is what helped, but I combined all dry ingredients in a separate bowl and mixed thoroughly with a fork, beat all wet ingredients really well with the mixer, then gradually added the dry to wet and beat by hand just until everything combined smoothly.  Cake rose perfectly. The texture of the cake was amazing as is, curious to know how it would have turned out with the applesauce and pineapple additions, will have to try it next time... Regardless, it's a way to get carrots voluntarily into my son, so definitely a keeper!

I had trouble getting this to cook all of the way through in a 9 x 13pan.  I was more successfull baking up as a layer cake.

This was a fantastic recipe.  We did deviate from the original a bit.  We made the cake into cupcakes first.  Secondly, we replaced the oil with 1C of unsweetened applesauce and 1/4C of canola oil.  We replaced all the white sugar with 1C brown sugar and 1C white sugar.  We added an extra tsp of vanilla, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and an extra tsp of cinnamon.  We also added 3/4C golden raisins.  We also used less sugar than called for in the frosting for a more cream cheesey taste.  These was such an incredibly moist cake!  Absolutely delicious!!  We will never ever buy a carrot cake again!  Thank you!

I'm not the biggest carrot cake fan but my husband is.  So, I picked this for his birthday cake.  I scaled the recipe by 1/2 since there are only 2 of us and the batter fit perfectly into a single 9" round cake pan.  I added a 1.5oz snack box of raisins to the batter. My husband thinks it's not carrot cake without the raisins so in they went.

This is without a doubt the best carrot cake ever. We've tried several variations and we think the best is definitely with the pecans in the cake but not in the frosting. If you want to put them in the frosting, be sure to chop them up fairly small. Blue Ribbon cake for sure!

There are already 1397 reviews for this recipe but I thought I'd add my own too.  I thought this recipe is awesome!!  The only changes that I made to the recipe was that I used 1 cup of whole wheat flour and 1 cup of all purpose flour instead of 2 cups of all purpose flour.  I didn't have any nuts so I omitted those.  The recipe pleased everyone in my family, and my 11 month old even got some vegi's out of it!!  I have an oven thermometer and it read exactly 350 degrees and I used a 9x13 cake pan.  I found that 40 minutes was more then enough time (I wouldn't recommend any longer).

This is a great tasting cake! I just needed to get rid of a bunch of carrots so I choose this recipe because it didn't call for pineapple. I was expecting a really dense texture due to the picture. The batter is really thick but don't let that fool you. It is very light and moist. I tried to make cupcakes. I over filled the cups so I'll try again. I agree with the person that said they don't need frosting. But who dosen't love cream cheese frosting? I might add some nutmeg next time.

Very good!! For the frosting I put in 3 cups of confectioner's sugar. I think next time I will put
even less, because it was still to sweet. I only had a tsp. of vanilla extract, so I put in a tsp.
almond extract, I would not suggest doing this!! It was still very good cake, just tasted 
different.

This is a great cake!!
The only thing I change was 1 1/4 cup honey for sugar and 3/4 cup applesauce for the oil. The second time I made this I added a 20oz can of pineapple drained! I made cream cheese frosting for the top. Just 2 cream cheese, 1/3 cup honey and a teaspoon of cinn. Thanks for the great recipe!

After realizing that the 9x13" cake that I had made wasn't going to be enough to feed all the mouths at my son's birthday party, I searched for a fast, easy cake to whip up.  The only change I made was to use 1 C applesauce and 1/4 C oil to cut down on the calories.  I am sure it would be great with extra cinnamon and nutmeg as others have suggested but it is wonderful as is.  Extremely moist.  I did not make the icing as we were expecting a guest with a milk allergy, instead mixing up a simple glaze to drizzle over the top and it was great!

This was my first attempt at carrot cake. I make it for my father-in-law and his family since it's his favorite. He is a carrot cake expert since he gets it everywhere he goes and he really loved this cake. The only thing is I don't think it had enough carrots in it but I think it's because I didn't mash them down at all when I measured. Next time I'll make sure to do that and then I think it'd be perfect!

I could really taste that oil. It's alot of oil. I was really looking forward to this cake, but didn't really like it. My husband said it is greasy as well. Will be looking for some recipe that doesnt require this much oil.

I totally agree with KAELHA who's review is on the first page under the recipe. You cannot rate a recipe objectively unless you make it as written! If you change too much stuff with it, and then rate poorly, well maybe your changes made it bad lool. Anyway, I made this recipe exactly as written, except that I made half with pecans and half without, because some people don't like them. Also, I took them to have at the park, so I did not make the icing for it, just plain. They were a HUGE hit! Everyone there loved them, and could not get enough.  Very moist and light. The pecans however do not stay crunchy, but that did not seem to be a problem. The turned dark as well, but as I could see on the submitted photos, I wasn't the only one with dark pecans in the cake! They were delicious though. Perfect carrot cake! Can't wait for a birthday so I can try the whipped cream cheese icing from this site with this cake!

I followed the alterations that "gneebeanie" included in the review, and the results were amazing! I substituted walnuts for the pecans (for the cake part) and used only 1/2 cup which I ground up in a cuisinart. Also, I only used 3 cups confectioner's sugar, and the frosting was still sweet! I think the final product tastes best after being refrigerated overnight. The frosting hardened a bit and the flavors were completely unified. Will definitely make again!!!

This recipe is great.  I followed another suggestion and used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white.  I also used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I upped the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp for my personal preference.  Other than that I left it alone and it was great.  My son said "This is the best carrot cake I have ever eaten".  And he has eaten a lot of carrot cake.

Following everyone's advice, I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar, added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract, added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, and used only 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting.  The cake came out incredibly well: it was moist and very flavorful.  Although it is a rather labor-intensive recipe, the result is definitely worth all the hard work!

This cake was amazing.  It's rare to find recipes with over 700 reviews and a 5 star rating. I have an old carrot cake recipe which was a signature dish and also very delicious, but I will abandon it for this one.  I also followed gneebeanie's recipe recommendations.  I excluded the pineapples just because the people I was baking for don't care very much for them.  Other than that it was perfect!  I made a 2 layer cake.  I used two 9 inch pans, sprayed them, floured them and lined them with parchment paper so it would release easily.  I baked them for about 35 minutes and let them cool in the pan.  I doubled the frosting recipe (I used 3/4 of it) but I only used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar.  I don't think it needs more than that, but that's my personal preference.  I frosted between the layers and on top as well as the sides.  This cake was super moist and a HUGE hit.  I will never use any other recipe!

Awesome cake! Per other reviewers, I made the following modifications: 1 c each brown and white sugar, added 1 extra t of cinammon and 1 t vanilla, and added 1/2 t of nutmeg, 1/4 t cloves, and  8 oz crushed pineapple, drained.  I also reduced oil to 3/4 c and added 1/2 c applesauce.  I mistakenly added an extra cup of carrots, but love it this way as well. :)

The frosting only needed 3 1/2 c of conf sugar, and one reviewer made an excellent modification of adding 2 T lime juice to the frosting to bring out the sweetness.  Fab job!

I made this cake for a Christmas potluck at work last week and everyone LOVED it!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY, but used 2 8inch round pans and a few less pecans.  This was the first cake I had ever made from scratch and it was absolutely PERFECT! The frosting was amazing! I had a little bit left over, but nothing crazy.

I loved this cake so much that I made this recipe into cupcakes over the weekend!  I made 24 of them and had a bit of batter left over, but found out in the end, I could of used all of it. So don't be scared to fill the muffin cups pretty much all the way. They will rise perfectly. I used only half of the frosting recipe this time and it was sufficient. I was told by my boyfriend's cousin that it was the best carrot cake she ever had!

I'm looking forward to making this many times, next time trying some of the suggested variations. Either way, I loved it as is! I highly recommend this recipe!

YUM!

This, like everyone else says, truly is the best. I used one of the commenters modifiers by subbing 1/2 cup oil for 1/2 c. applesause. Also, used 1 cup brown/1 white instead of two white. SO GOOD. The second time I made it, I added food coloring to frosting (3 red, 3 yellow) and used the 1/2 c. less confectioners sugar. I wanted to make a round cake, so I used two 8 inch round pans, and cooked them for 10 min less than the original time. Then, I frosted the bottom cake all around, with a little frosting on top, then the top cake, and added some sparkly sprinkles, walnuts and mellocreme pumpkins for that festive look!
The best cake ever!

Husband loved this.  I substituted 1/2 of the sugar (1 cup) with Splenda and the cake turned out great.  I used pre-shredded carrots from the grocery store and they worked well, too.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I decided to make cupcakes because I would have felt cheesy bringing a 9x13 as a birthday cake.  They were perfect after about 20 minutes.  These are A+ in my book.

After carefully reviewing the carrot cake recipes I decided to make this one and I will never search for another! It is so moist and full of flavor. I did a few changes: I used only 1 cup of oil and added 2/3 cup sour cream, I added a handful of raisins and used store bought cream cheese frosting. I took it out of the oven after @ 37-38 minutes and it was done so don't set the timer for 50 min and not check on it. I did have a little sinking in the middle that other people have talked about but after frosting it I couldn't tell. My husband couldn't stop telling how good it is and he is not a huge fan of carrot cake.

I could taste the baking soda or baking powder in the cake, so I think there may have been too much in this cake. It was also very dense, so I may add some sour cream to the next one I make.

After baking this cake, i rarely order a carrot cake outside the house. It's AWESOME (that's my son's comment)! I grate the carrots on the wide side. I used 1 cup suger instead of two. Used walenut instead of peacan. The frosting was two much, I used only 2/3 of it. the walenut in frosting is much, I used 2/3 only.

First time I made carrot cake and I followed this recipe. I'm a novice baker--and took the advice of the people who said to use applesauce in place of 1/2 the oil and it worked! I served it for a small dinner party and it was a HUGE hit. Thank you. Only small thing is I think I chopped the carrots too small and I could have used more carrots. Otherwise, perfect!

Perfect in every way - taste and consistency.  I made it with the 1 cup brown/1 cup white sugar and added 1 extra tsp of cinnamon but kept everything else in the cake the same.  For the frosting, I only used three cups of powdered sugar.  After two years of using this recipe, it is always extremely well-received.  It's  described as "amazing" and "the best".  It is the quintessential carrot cake - I doubt I will ever try any other carrot cake recipe.  I usually make two 9" rounds so I can layer, and they take about 31 minutes to bake in my oven.  I always make it the night before and it's perfect the next day and the day after that, as well.  Thank you!!!

I always have to chuckle when I read a review and it says "I made this recipe, except I changed this or that."  That's not actually trying the recipe.  Anyway, I made this carrot cake for Thanksgiving (exactly as it appears).  It has a really great flavor, and the icing is good and rich.  The cake was a little dry however, and next time I will alter it by using crushed pineapple.

This is yummy!! I followed the recipe exactly, but next time I think I will replace some of the oil with applesauce as suggested by other reviewers. All in all it was delicious and enjoyed by everyone!!

I gave this one 4 stars because of the flavor and because it was a simple carrot cake without extras like raisins, etc.  However, I cut the oil down to 3/4C and it was still too oily for my liking.  Next time I'll try 1/2C and applesauce as others have suggested.  Flavor was great though - I added a tsp of cinnamon, 2tsp of nutmeg and did 1C brown & 1Cwhite sugar.

As far as the frosting goes...I would highly suggest starting with 2 cups of powdered sugar, mix all well and taste.  That was PLENTY of sugar for me and I've never ever been known to say something was too sugary!  LOL  I can't imagine what 4 cups would taste like.  I also added an extra tsp of vanilla and crushed the pecans into very small crumbs and the frosting turned out REALLY fabulous.

I used a deep springform round cake pan and the middle never seemed to set, even after 50 minutes.  The top was browning too much so I pulled it out and the middle fell.  Still, I fixed that with icing and as I said, the taste is really good.  Another tip for sticking pans - spray pan with Pam and then line with parchment - mine came out great with no problems.  Next time, I'll probably try two rounds instead of one huge one with icing in the middle.

To sum up - great taste, but too much oil in the cake and too much sugar in the icing.

The flavor and moisture in this cake is great.  The only problem was that mine collapsed in the middle as another person's had, but once you flip it over and put frosting on it, it doesn't matter.

Good flavor, but I used applesauce instead of the oil and it came out too bottom heavy. Next time I will try 50/50 oil and applesauce.

I changed this recipe, merely because I had extra apple sauce, and I have an egg allergic baby.  So what I did was:  I used left over "sarah's applesauce" (from this site) for the oil & two ripe bananas for the 2 eggs (I cut the recipe in 1/2 & baked it in a 8X8).  We loved it.  I did cut down on the powdered sugar by 1/2 cup & added more cream cheese, but it was great.  This made alot of frosting, like to frost 1 1/2 (8x8) cakes, but we like it very frosted (although I'm gonna have to do an extra work out to get that off...again) worth it.  Thanks Tammy!!

I baked this in 2 8" layer pans and divided each in half to make 4 layers total.  I doubled the icing recipe (excluding pecans)and put a thin layer between each.  Then I toasted coconut and covered the sides with it.  It was a beautiful birthday cake that easily served 10-12 pp.  Everybody absolutely raved!

I made this cake exactly as it is written in the recipe (except for the nuts) for Easter. I'm a pastry chef in an upscale restaurant and everyone said what an exceptionally tasty carrot cake this was. I did end up adding additional cream cheese to the recipe to get the flavor I liked for the frosting on a smaller scale it'd be easier to reduce the amount of butter to 1/4 cup. Also using a combination of both powdered and brown sugar in the frosting is a nice touch.
This is my go to carrot cake recipe for or menu now. Yum yum!

I am vegan so I couldnt try this but it was my boyfriends birthday and this is one of his favorite cakes.  Since i couldnt try ANY of it during the process, I hoped for the best and relied on the 4.5 star rating.  It turned out amazing! I did something a little different and did two round 9in pans and did a double cake and he still loved it.  It needed 50 minutes but everything else was the same.  
Awesome recipe :D  I'll add it to my favorites!

I made this exactly as written for a Christmas party and it was a big hit.  It was very dense and moist.  My only issue was that I could taste a bit of the baking soda (despite sifting my dry ingredients together).  I might try to decrease it slightly next time.

This was fantastic! I adore carrot cake, but had never tried making one myself. This one turned out excellent.  A friend had told me the trick to a good carrot cake is to use a full pound of carrots, so I did that and everyone loved it.

The recipe is easy to follow and has a delicious taste to it when done. This is the second time my daughters and I have made it and we love it. It's great to bring to different holidays or special events. This is a great site for different recipes starting from scratch. But in my opinion, I think it is very rude of people changing the recipe, complaining about the original recipe, then giving it 5 stars for a rating. They're probably rating their own, not the original. As I said before, this is my second time making it, and I don't get "carrot juice" or it's not "too sweet" as other people are complaining about. But anyways! I think the recipe is perfect and it doesn't need any changes.

Great recipe made it for a family members birthday & it was loved even by a picky 3 yr old. I also use 3 cups confectioners' sugar & instead of all white sugar, used 1 cup dark & one white for a light brown sugar taste.I mix very fine grated nuts in the icing.I also made cupcakes & not one was left within 10 mins of putting them out at an event.Thank you for this good & simple recipe.

Worth your time to try it out but nothing oh my goodness spectacular. The taste is pretty good... better than alot of carrot cakes Ive had. I followed the recipe almost exactly... I left out the pecans and baked it in two 9" round pans so I could layer it. The cake is very moist and tasty but ended up pretty dense and heavy. I used store bought frosting and one container wasnt enough.... it was for at home eating so it didnt matter but if you are making this for something special you will need two containers of frosting if you dont make your own.

after reading so many mixed reviews I had to add mine because I made this, completely as-is, and it got screamingly rave reviews--I made it for a party and both kids and adults loved it and wanted seconds and thirds.  It was moist, just sweet enough, and went perfectly with both chocolate and vanilla cream cheese frosting.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. We loved it. I appreciate the fact there was no coconut or pineapple included, since I wanted a true carrot cake. It was moist and light, frosting wasn't really needed, a dusting of powered sugar would havd been good too. I'm going to try this recipe for muffins with a crumb topping.

I have never made a cake from scratch, the cake was delicious. I have my own take on doing icing so I did the icing and garnishing my way. Everyone loves it, Thank-you.

Love the texture and taste of this case.  I used part applesauce and part oil and part brown and part white sugar upon the recommendation of many other reviews, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.  This is now my go to Carrot Cake Recipe for my favorite flavor of cake!

Pretty good. Wanted a smaller cake and so just halved  the recipe. It's very sweet, even having halved again the sugar in the frosting. Have made a couple times and you can replace some of the oil with applesauce.

Yum! I've made this carrot cake for pretty much every family gathering. I use walnuts instead of pecans, and it's just as good. Very moist and not too sweet.

Great basic carrot cake recipe- used 1/2 cup less carrots and substituted for golden raisins and added 14/ cup chopped walnuts. Icing a little too sweet and fattening so used reduced fat cream cheese and halved the sugar- tasted delicious!

This recipe is awesome! I make it for people at work and my hubby, they all love it just the way it is. I don't eat cake, but I'm told it's super moist and super delicious - people beg me to make this. I don't make any substitutions and everyone loves it. What's the point in making substitutions and then rating this recipe? It's not the same recipe. I cannot stand seeing subs on a recipe and then rating it ~ doesn't make any sense at all.

This is a really good cake. Almost as easy as a box mix, but better. Way better. I was looking for something that didn't have raisins, and pineapple, and coconut, etc. This fit the bill. Just carrots (and some nuts). I did sub sliced almonds for the pecans since almonds were what I had on hand. My cake did also sink a bit in the middle, but I may have over-mixed. In any case, I don't care. The frosting levels it out ;) and it tastes great either way.

Delicious!  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, and added more cinnamon and vanilla extract (about 1 tsp more each).  I omitted the pecans from the frosting.  Everything else was as written.  I shredded my own carrots using the large size of a cheese grater, and it took about 8 medium sized carrots.  I baked for 45 minutes and it was perfect.

I am a strong believer in rating the actual recipe listed here and not rating based off of an altered recipe or the suggestions of others. I made this cake EXACTLY as it says and it came out amazing. I paired it up with the Cream Cheese Frosting II Recipe (also followed exactly) and this is truly a perfect combination. After making it one year for Thanksgiving several members of my family now request it for their birthday. I tell everyone to go to this site and follow Carrot Cake III and Cream Cheese Frosting II recipes to match the cake =)

Great recipe.  Always try creating a low fat dessert. Used 1-1/2 c white flour and 1/2 c whole wheat flour; 1-1/2 c white sugar & 1/2 c brown sugar; no oil but 1 c applesauce; 3 whole eggs and 2 egg whites.  Added 1 more teaspoon of cinnamon; 1/2 t. nutmeg; 1 cup drained pineapple and 1/2 c raisins.  Did not frost and wonderful!

I know there are a million reviews for this cake, and I don't know if anyone will care to read mine but i do want to say it is delicious. I wouldn't really change anything. I've never made carrot cake before, so i made it exactly as instructed. And it was fine! You can substitute things to make it slightly healthier, as you can any other food, but don't feel like you need to go crazy. I used a slightly different icing recipe that called for a little less sugar ( i like my icing more cream cheesy) but there is one thing I did that set my boyfriend (who is carrot cake crazy) over the edge: I coated the iced cake with heath bar bits (which are just toffee bits) that you can buy in a bag in the grocery store by the chocolate chips. They add a pleasant crunch (which were missing in my cake because I didn't have any nuts =(  and tasted really good!
The only other thing I would add is maybe a pinch of nutmeg. Also would recommend grating the carrots in small slivers so there aren't necessarily big pieces of carrot. 
Really good recipe!!! Will make it again and again.

Still not what I was looking for exactly...was a bit dry...but overall had better flavour than the Sams version on here! Next time I will omit the nuts though! Oh, I also added some nutmeg to the mix...it needs a bit more spice!

I made this cake and the icing and it was out of this world yummy, My husband want me to make it again and my sister want one also, I did not change anything about the recipe, but I would like to cut the sweetnes down on the icing, I only used 2 cups of powdered sugar and that seem to be too sweet fr me so maybe next time I will try using more cream cheese aand less sugar, but other it was yummy and out of this world good .....

Made this for my boss's birthday, and it turned out amazing. Didn't do any modifications for the cake, except for not adding the pecans, but I had to use a pre-made frosting as I didn't have time to make one myself. 

Everyone loved it and asked for a copy of the recipe. First rate!

My husband really wanted a carrot cake for his birthday so I thought I would try this one.  He was very please with it and so was everyone else.  The only thing different was with the frosting.  I used less sugar because 1 box of confectioners sugar is 3 3/4 cup and I didn't have anymore and it was still sweet enough. I also add the juice from one fresh squeezed orange. This gave the frosting just a little hint of orange flavor.

Wow!! I've never really baked a cake before but it turned out great. Carrot cake is my boyfriend's favorite so I decided to try it out. The directions were straightforward; no problems there. I will probably be making a Thanksgiving Carrot Cake for next week! Highly recommend for people who are new to baking like my lovely self ;)

I love the review feature of this site.  I never made this recipe as written.  (I can hear the purists booing and hissing...)  I used the "most referenced changes" except for the pineapple, and we LOVE it.  I've been looking for a go-to carrot cake, and this is it.  With the referenced changes, it's 5 stars.

Since making this cake the first time in April, I have had people asking me if they could order one.  Strangers at parties, think I bake professionally!  I just popped my 6th cake into the oven fo rmy Mom's 85th birthday, I just know she is going to love it.  BTW, I add a can of drained crushed pineapple.

I really enjoyed this cake.  I followed some of the other suggestions and substituted applesauce for a part of the oil and added a can of crushed pineapple.  My family doesn't love nuts so I didn't add the pecans to the frosting.  This is a keeper for me.

This is an awesome carrot cake!  The frosting made it hard to transport though, so I skipped it and added white chocolate chips to the cake for a similar punch of sweetness- so delicious!!!  Thanks!

Made the recipe with all the alterations, was very pleased with the end results, I used 4 eggs, 1cup of Canola oil, one cup of white sugar and one cup brown sugar, 3 teastoons of pure organic vanilla extract, 2cups of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons of baking soda, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 3 teaspoons of fresh ground cinnamon, 3 cups of graded carrots, 1 cup chopped pecans, 1 8oz can of crushed pineapple with most the juice strained out and set aside 1/4 cup of the juice to add in when mixing the ingridients, all so added 1/4 fresh ground nutmeg and 1/2 a cup of rasins. the frosting seemed to need to much confectioners sugar for my liking so i only added 2 1/2 cups. Folded in the graded carrots and raisans and pecans, baked at 325 degrees F, in two 9x1.5 in round pans greased the up but forgot to flour then up >.

amazing!!!!!!!
i made it for a small get together and people said it was the best carrot cake they have ever had, between 9 people, it was gone, people going up not even with a plate, just a fork, digging in like no tomorrow! anyways i did make some changes but good changes!
i added 3/4 of a can of pineapple
1 extra teaspoon of vanilla
1 extra tsp of cinnamon
and then for the icing, i recommend waiting for the cake to fully cool , i did not do that , and man does that icing melt quickly! o
overall...best cake i have ever made. and i am a professional baker.

This was good. I added 1 cup of sweetened flaked coconut, 1 cup of chopped pecans and 1 cup of drained crushed pineapple to the batter. Cut the shredded carrot down to 2 1/2 cups. Next time I will cut the powdered sugar in the frosting down to 3 cups from 4. It's a bit too sweet, and this is coming from a house of sweet tooths. I think without these modifications it would be good, but with the added ingredients it's over the top yummy!

Great recipe! This was extremely easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly, and it came out moist and delicious. The middle did collapse a little bit, but being a novice baker, perhaps I used the wrong kind of pan. 
I was debating how to make the frosting based on so many of the reviews. Here's what I found: if you prefer your frosting to taste a bit more on the tangy/cream cheese side, use 3 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar. If you prefer it sweeter, than go with the 4 cups. 
I feel like this is a foolproof recipe, so I would recommend this to any level of baker.

Great recipe... substituted half the oil for applesauce to cut down on calories and fat, otherwise followed directions exactly.  It was moist and I had no leftovers at a birthday party.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Prefect; I used this recipe for a cake order. The only thing I did was used mixed nuts & toasted them before I added them to the batter, Didnt have enough butter & didnt add all the confectioner's sugar for the frosting but it was still sweet & super yummy. Will use this recipe anything I have a carrot cake order. :]

Wow I have never ever made a carrot cake before and this recipe was phenomenal!

I agree with the other reviews I did 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup apple sauce (to make it healthier) and grated the carrots with the bigger hole of the grater. At first I was scared that the carrot strips would be too big but it was heavenly.

Everything about this recipe was so good. The cake was so moist and a bit dense in a good way. It melts in your mouth.

Great recipe!  As I tend to do, I used HALF the fat and substitute other half with applesauce, also I used HALF the sugar and it is still plenty sweet.. no icing necessary! :)  Made it a few times now, family loves it, thanks!

Delicious! I'm not a big cream cheese icing fan, so I made a yummy cinnamon buttercream icing instead. It was a hit! As for the changes I made, I used half brown sugar and white sugar and added some crushed pineapple. It was superb.

Great cake just the way it is!!  Moist and flavourful.  No need to change anything.  I agree with other reviewers...when you rate the recipe...rate it for what it is...not with all the changes you make.  That's a different recipe.  Submit it and share it with us instead :).

Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe Tammy :-)!!

Excellent carrot cake recipe (and there are a TON of them out there!)  However, never, EVER grease and FLOUR a pan -- especially one for cake or anything sweet.  Always grease and SUGAR.  It releases from the pan much easier and doesn't leave that ugly powder residue behind.

I followed this recipe exactly, and the cake turned out very bland and tasteless - virtually the only detectable taste was the taste of baking soda/powder. I chose this recipe based on the fact that upwards of 3100 people had reviewed it and the average rating was five stars. Unfortunately it appears that most of the reviewers made a number of modifications to this cake before giving it a rave review, so in the end, the five-star rating does not really reflect the quality of the original recipe. The cream cheese icing recipe that comes with this cake, however, is fantastic, but as another reviewer so aptly stated, the icing should complement the flavour of the cake, not mask the fact that the flavour is sorely lacking. I will continue to search for an excellent carrot cake recipe. I do not recommend this one.

Absolutely delicious! I tried to make it a bit healthier by using apple sauce instead of oil, 1 cup of brown sugar + 1/4 cup of white sugar, and reduced the sugar in the frosting to 2 cups. I also used half the amount of nuts and added 1/2 a can of crushed pineapple (strained out the juice). Everybody LOVED it and you would never know that I made healthy changes!!

THIS CARROT CAKE IS THE BOMB!!!!! I made the following changes to this recipes: 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg,added 8 oz of crushed pinapple(drained all the juice), added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract-to cake mix,& added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon. I also omitted the pecans from the icing! I used 9 inch round pans and made a 2 layered cake and it was so pretty and sooooo good, it didnt last but a day in the house! I think the icing is just perfect I think next time i  may add raisons! THis is A MUST TRY!

I just made this for the first time, and even though I used only 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce, I wish that I had used even less oil because it did come out quite oily. I'm not sure if the recipe calls for so much oil because that is what makes it moist, but I would think that adding sour cream (or more apple sauce) would be a better way to make a cake moist. Also, I was surprised that this cake lacks so much in flavor. I added the 2 tsps. of cinnamon PLUS 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg, but I found that it was still a bit bland. Also, I thought the 4 cups of powdered sugar sounded like way too much, so I used a different recipe for the frosting that only calls for 1/4 cup butter, 8 oz. crm. cheese, 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract and only ONE cup of powdered sugar. It was really good and I had more than enough to cover the entire cake with about 1/4 inch of frosting. I'm wondering if maybe there is a typo in the directions for the frosting, where it calls for FOUR CUPS of powdered sugar. That just seems like way too much! I also used pre-shredded carrots that I bought at the store. I was worried they wouldn't be as moist as if I had grated the carrots myself, but they seemed to work just fine. But I will most likely try to find a different recipe the next time I decide to make carrot cake. This one is much too bland... and oily.

This is the best carrot cake recipe!  I have made it three times and received a lot of compliments each time.  I made these into cupcakes (makes 24) and reduced the vegetable oil to 1 cup and added about 1/2 a cup of chopped pineapple. SO YUMMY! The chopped pineapple really adds and makes them so moist. Must try!

Absolutely the best carrot cake EVER. I used only 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans and made cupcakes (bake for 16-18 minutes at 350). I used all oil, extra vanilla, added nutmeg, and used half white & half brown sugar. Wonderful! I used a different frosting recipe. This recipe was immediately added to my (very exclusive) favourites binder!

I just made this for the second time and it was even better than the first. I made some changes to make it a little healthier and it came out extremely moist and spongy. It's still a little too sweet for our taste so next time I'll cut thing back even more. Here's what I did: I substituted half of the flour for white whole wheat, used unsweetened applesauce for the oil and cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added almost a 1/2 cup of honey. Next time I think I'll drop the sugar to 1/2 cup and try adding 1/4 or 1/3 cup of honey. The icing was also way too sweet so next time I think I'll try cutting back on the sugar and using more butter or maybe add in a little milk. I also only use organic ingredients these days and flavors seem to pop way more. Just a side, my three kids all hate carrots, but greedily ate their pieces up!

I liked the cake bit a lot, but I found the icing to be too sweet.  Also, I ended up with heaps more icing than I needed.  Next time, I'll cut back on the butter and sugar to get more of a cream cheese taste.  Great recipe however!

I made this cake exactly as written as I wanted to review this recipe with no alterations.  It is not a true review if changes are made.  I made this cake following the directions exactly.  The cake never rose in the center.  After all the time I spent shredding the carrots, etc. I was extremely dissappointed.  I had to question if my baking soda and baking powder were good, even though the expiration dates were 2012.  I baked another cake tonight (chocolate) using my bp and bs and it turned out great, so that was not the problem.  I did taste this cake, and it was very oily.  The other reviewers are probably right when they cut the oil down or substituted applesauce.  I will not be making this recipe again.  I have made Sam's Carrot Cake from this site and it is delicious.

I'm noticing a lot of changes being made to this recipe.  I was wondering are all these changes being made the 2nd time around after trying the original recipe or is everyone assuming it needs to be changed.  What if it's just perfect the way it is, you'd never know!!

This is 1 great cake. The only thing I did different was to add: 1/2t nutmeg (maybe I should go 1/4t), 1/4t ginger, & 1/4t clove. Because I like to make it very spicy. And I made my own frosting, that uses 1/2 the powder sugar this 1 calls for.

Really, really good.  Very moist.  My cake did fall in the middle after taking it out, but I think the problem is my oven or leavening, not the recipe.  Although I did have problems getting the middle to set; it took about 15 minutes longer than stated.  All that said, the cake was fantastic and its flaws were easily hidden with the generous amount of cream cheese frosting.  I cut down on the sugar to 2 3/4 cups and it was amazing.  My husband took it (all but two pieces) to work and it was gone by the end of the day, and everyone raved.  Thanks!

The only change I made was the usual healthy substitutions - whole wheat flour for white, applesauce for all but 1/4 c. of the oil, and reducing the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. PHENOM.

Everyone loved this. I halved the recipe, since we were a small crowed... and I hate carrot cake. Everyone enjoyed it, especially the frosting... which I used the ratio as written. I used walnuts instead of pecans, because it was what I had on hand. Great recipe!

Make it once and you will be back to make again and again. I forgot to put in the pecans in the cake mix and just mixed them in with the frosting. Either way this is a great recipe. Bravo to Tammy.....

Perfect, as is.  I've been trying for sometime to make a carrot cake everyone would love.  This is it.  I made a double layer cake and put the nuts on the sides of the iced cake and piped the traditional carrots on top.  My family said, "You finally got it right."

OK - I changed the carrots for zuccini, the oil for applesauce, the vanilla for almond extract, the flour for bulgar wheat, the sugar for salt, and barbequed the cake instead of baking it.  Well of course I'm just kidding, but I agree that changing the recipe dramatically is not as good as posting a new recipe with your own changes.   This is a five star recipe without all the changes.

I made this carrot cake for the first time to take to a potluck dinner. As a rule I never take something I have never made before to a potluck but I thought I would risk it anyway. I was a little worried because some of the reviews had pretty much rewritten the recipe. Anyway I did make it exactly as written and everyone raved about it, and I have already gotten a few requests for this recipe. It really was the best carrot cake I have ever made. It was light, very flavorful and not at all oily. Give it a try as written, I wouldn't change a thing....you don't need to.

I thought that the cake was great but I wish I followed the recipe and didnt substitute some of the oil with applesause like some of the reviews suggested. I did add rasins which added some flavor, and kept in mind that one reveiw stated that the frosting was too sweet so instead of 4 cups of confectioners sugar I  used 3 cups and did a taste test and it was perfect. I would definitly make this again.

First of all, I'd like to say that I MADE THIS RECIPE EXACTLY AS IT WAS WRITTEN and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!!!  I don't know how people can rate recipes, give it 4 or more stars, yet make so many modifications to them.  Anyway, my husband LOVES carrot cake and wanted me to make him one for his birthday.  He LOVED, LOVED this recipe - so did EVERYONE else who tasted it!!!  I don't believe it needs any changes at all.  It is one of the BEST and EASIEST carrot cake recipes I have ever tried.  Thank you for sharing it!!!

This cake is really good!! :) I made it as 30 cupcakes, and frosted them as directed. Delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, except I added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg like the other reviewers suggested and cooked them for 15 minutes. MMMMMM...i'm about to eat another one!

Just because it's called carrot cake does not mean it is going to be healthy and/or dry. This cake is very moist and flavorful (sinful). I made it last night for my husband's birthday and everyone said how delicious it was. The only things I changed was instead of 2 cups sugar I added 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, added one 8 oz can of crushed pineapples (drained) and instead of pecans I added 1 cup of raisins. Birthday boy doesn't like nuts. Like other reviewers I cut back on the powdered sugar in the frosting to a little less than 3 cups and it was perfect for us. My sister even said the frosting tasted light. :) Thanks for the delicious recipe Tammy. This one will be used over and over.

It was an awesome carrot cake recipe! I didn't put the nuts in it because I don't like nuts, but even without those, it tasted amazing! Thanks so much for this recipe, I will be using it in the future for sure!

I've tried numerous recipes on this site and have never had any issues with them.  However, this cake did not turn out at all.  I followed the recipe exactly, with no tweaks and it came out awful.  The edge of the cake was overcooked and hard and the middle fell flat and looked undercooked.  After tasting a bit of the edge, it was also way to sweet.  I didn't even get to make the frosting because the cake didn't turn out.  I'm not sure what I did wrong, but it was not good at all.

fantastic and easy!! the best carrot cake i've ever tried. I have made this cake twice already and every time i got tons of compliments.  I used an extra cup of carrots and a different frosting (1 stick of butter, 8 ounces of cream cheese, 1 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla)... soooo good! enjoy

This cake is very moist and flavorful, and the frosting was out of this world. (I added a dash of cinnamon) I added golden raisins  to the batter as well and it was a big hit.

Delicious!  One of the best ever.  I *did* add a tablespoon or so of milk to the frosting.  There was a *lot* of frosting for a 9 x 13 pan. But, can there ever be too much cream cheese frosting???

After making the orginal recipe, I have to give this four stars because it needed some adjusting. Here is my changes 1)3/4 cup oil 1/2 cup apple sauce 2)1 cup white sugar 1 cup brown 3) 8 ounces crushed pineapple well drained 4) extra cinnamon and 5) 1 cup raisins. No carrot cake is complete without them. After the changes 5 stars!!

Awesome carrot cake!! I'm always looking for new cakes to add to my rotation and although I never thought about carrot cake, this one got such rave reviews that i decided to try it. It was fantastic! i used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown and added another tsp of vanilla (as per some suggestions) and I also didn't have any pecans so i used walnuts. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!

We so enjoyed this carrot cake. I was happy to share it with everyone. I used all organic products to make it and no dairy. I used soy butter (Earth Balance) and soy cream cheese. It was just as moist and sweet as anything Grandma would have made. Thanks so much for your recipe help.

This was good. I suspect that I would have liked the addition of pineapple which many people recommended. I made half as muffins, and half as a loaf. I made them lighter by using egg beaters instead of whole eggs, apple sauce instead of oil, and only one cup of sugar though the apple sauce was sweetened so that added a bit of sugar. I had walnuts, not pecans, and also added raisins. The nutritional value with my adjustments came to 175 calories per serving.

I followed the consolidated advice (used nutmeg, crushed pineapple, extra cinammon/vanilla), and it turned out extremely moist.  But it tastes pretty much like any other carrot cake.

The amount of icing is waaaay too much for this recipe, it should be about a quarter of the amount called for.  I put most of the icing into a container and put it in the freezer for next time.

My family has been makeing this recipe for many years. It is perfect just as it is.  It does not call for pineapple - there are many other recipes that do.  why not try this one the way it is written.  I've never had anyone complain and everyone always asks for the recipe.

This was great! I made it exactly as recipe states, except for using 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I have never liked cakes from scratch, but this turned out really well. I made it in 2 9 inch rounds and they baked for about 35 minutes. I thought it was just sweet enough. I like the frosting to taste like cream cheese and not too terribly sweet so I only used 3 cups powdered sugar and it came out PERFECT--so good!

Um...what the HECK?! This is SO freaking good! I can't stop eating these! GAH! =)

I made the recipe according to instruction and it was AMAZING. The second time I added an extra tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg like other reviewers, and a dash of nutmeg. So. Freaking. GOOD. AAAH. THANK YOU.

Sorry, I guess I am in the minority here with my opinion of this recipe -  not good – way too OILY.  I followed it exactly and didn’t take other reviewers suggestions (using half APPLESAUCE for the oil is a must).  I also grated the carrots large, that too was a mistake, they should be small to mix in with the rest of the ingredients.  Did not like this one at all.  I tried another recipe on this site: Awesome Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting – but this time I took the suggestions of other reviewers – ½ APPLESAUCE for the oil, boiled raisins in rum before adding, added 1 c. sweet small flaked coconut and 1 large can crushed drained pineapple… much much much better!

This recipe was AMAZING!!!  I took it to a dinner party with friends, and they completely devoured it!  This recipe is SOOOOO easy to make, and beats anything that you could get out of a box.  An easy tip is to use a bag of shredded carrots in place of the grated carrots...makes it even more simple!

This was my first time making carrot cake and I LOVE carrot cake. I just thought it would be so complicated...boy was I wrong! This recipe was easy, delicious and completely satisfying. I didn't give it a 5 because I thought the frosting was a little runny, though the flavor was awesome. Could someone maybe recommend some adjustments or take a guess at where I went wrong?

I made this today and the boyfriend and I both loved it. I used the suggested changes in using 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce (cinnamon applesauce), and 1 cup white sugar and one cup brown.  I also used 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4.  I did extra vanilla and cinnamon.  Next time, I will probably stick to just 2 teaspoons cinnamon to suit my taste.  I wanted to make this a layer cake, so I used two 8" square pans. This meant I had to adjust the cooking time.  I baked at 325 for 25 minutes, and thet upped it to 350 for an additional 10.  This is a great cake!  My boyfriend said his new favorite. Thanks for sharing! ***UPDATE*** I made this again last night for my boyfriend's birthday.  Last time, I thought it was a bit sweet and spicy, so I made it exactly as the recipe stated (except the frosting).  WAY BETTER.  I should have just followed the original recipe the first time.  I will make it this way from now on.

This is delicious! I used applesauce instead of oil, so it's less fattening and I didn't make the frosting.

I loved this cake, it is very moist and even my 2 year old liked it which suprised me. I did use a lot of the suggestions for the recipe. I used 1c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar, I used 3/4 c veg oil and 1/2 c applesauce, added 8oz can of crushed pinapple(drained)and only used 3 1/2 c powdered sugar for frosting. Excellent recipe, I will be making this again for sure!

I can't really give this recipe as it is a 5-star rating because it is only great with the modifications suggested by all the other reviewers! I made it with all those changes and it was fabulous. What I made, while it was based on this recipe, was NOT actually the same cake. Follow the modifications given in that one review that compiles all of them together & it will be fine. Everyone loved it at my house!

Wow this was great! I followed the recipe changes of another reviewer, and this was good, I also cut the powdered sugar to two cups for the frosting. Still great. I took it to a potluck, the few pieces that were left were just as moist and flavorful as when I first served it!

This cake is very moist and delicious and with minor recommended adjustments it really is the best I've ever had. Would definitely recommend reducing oil and adding applesauce.

Changes Made: reduced oil to 3/4 cup, used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, added 1 cup crushed pineapple (well drained), 1/2 cup applesauce and a pinch of nutmeg. Because of family protests, I did not add the pecans. For frosting, 3 cups of sugar was plenty- I'll reduce that by 1/4 cup the next time I bake this cake. Also a little orange zest in frosting was perfect touch.

WOW this cake was so delicious and moist!!! I love this cake!! I read other viewer's suggestions and made small changes. I substituted 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar, 3/4 cup of oil, 1/2 cup of applesauce and 1/4 tspn of nutmeg to the batter, and on the frosting I only added 3 cups of confectioners sugar to the recipe. My family loved, loved this cake!! after 1 sitting there was nothing left!! This recipe is a must for Thanksgiving.

This carrot cake was delicious!!! I have been craving a great carrot cake for a while, so when I came across this recipe I was ecstatic. I took advice from others using 3/4 c. oil & 1/2 c.applesauce, 1 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown sugar, and I also used a little more than 3 cups carrots. I baked it in two round pans and the frosting (which I only put in 3 c. sugar instead of 4c.) was plenty to frost a layer in middle and frost top. My family loved it, I will definetly make again- Thank you for a great recipe!!!

I am giving this a 4 because it has a lot of potential to be a great cake. I'll just tell you this... DO NOT MAKE THIS IN A 9x13 in. PAN!!!! It came out flat and dry. I would recommend maybe two smaller square pans, or just a smaller rectangle pan instead. I will make it again and hope that it what it yields is worthy of at least a four star rating.

This turned out really good! My mixer caught on fire and I was unable to use it, but hand mixed the frosting instead. Was very creamy! Recieved rave reviews from family over the weekend. Will make again but his time will try and use to round cake pans and layer frosting in between and on all sides!!!

I hate to be the one who doesn't rate this a perfect 5 stars, but I have to say that, while the cake turned out ALMOST perfect, two teaspoons of baking soda AND two teaspoons of baking powder is a bit too much and I could taste/feel the soda in my mouth afterwards.  I've compared several other recipes, and no other recipe I can find calls for both - just one or the other.  Other than that, this recipe was great and I didn't deviate in any way.  

Thanks!

This was my first time making a carrot cake, and after rave reviews on here gave it a shot.

I modified the recipe a tad, using self raising flour and adding 100g of raisins. 

It was perfect, dense moist and flavourful

I served this cake at a bridal shower, and all the guests raved about it. I added 1 cup of chopped walnuts to the batter before baking. I baked the cake in two 9" rounds. I frosted the cake as instructed. It really was excellent! MUCH better than "The Best Carrot Cake Ever" from this site. I am now a die-hard carrot cake fan!

This is the best carrot cake I have ever had! Moist, with a perfect compliment of flavors.
I made this recipe with the changes suggested by others- applesauce, extra cinnamon etc.  I made cupcakes - made 18
Baked at 400 for 10 minutes, then at 350 for about 16-18 minutes.  They rised and made picture perfect cupcakes!
Absolutely delicious!

Fantastic! This was moist and very tasty. I followed the suggested changes of other reviewers by replacing part of the oil with apple sauce. It came out perfect. Only thing is, I felt there was too much frosting. I had a whole lot leftover even after frosting a thick layer over the entire cake.

This recipe is amazing.  It was very simple to make, and everyone loved it.  I substituted 1 cup of oil for 1 cup of applesauce and put 1 cup of brown sugar instead of one of the white sugars, as I read others had done.  I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Made this for my co-workers for a potluck and they liked it a lot. I'll definitely make this again. The frosting was pretty thick so I added just 1/2 tsp of milk and an extra 1/2 tsp of vanilla to thin it out and I left out the nuts. Another keeper. Thanks!

Very easy to make. Really moist. I added a small can of crushed pineapple (as i think carrot cake has to have pineapple in it-go figure!) The frosting was so creamy and i couldn,t decide which i liked best. together they are yummy. Took some to work to share and my coworkers said it was the best they had ever had. I will make over and over again.

Perfection! I brought this to work for a coworkers birthday party, and it was a hit. I was a little nervous, never having made carrot cake before but it was a, um, piece of cake to prepare (forgive the pun?), and very moist. Only revisions were to reduce the amt of oil to 3/4 c., and add 1/2 c. applesauce. Also used walnuts in leiu of pecans. I did follow the recipe exactly for the icing and, personally, I found it a tad too sweet. Next time I'll adjust down the confectioners a bit. But definitely a fantastic recipe, and one that will remain in the box for future repeated use.

I made this cake with a few changes and it was amazing. I have never had Carrot Cake that tasted so good. I substituted the oil for apple sauce and the pecans for walnuts and I added a cup of raisins. 
If you like carrot cake this is the best recipe I have ever found.

This was the best carrot cake I have ever had!  So moist and flavorful..perfect.  The only thing I did different was 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar instead of the 2 cups white.

Excellent recipe! I followed everything except for the oil, I minimized that and it still came out great! My husband loves it! Very easy for novice bakers, such as myself :-)

This is the absolutely BEST carrot cake EVER!!!
 I found this recipe on Thursday morning, took a chance and used it for a wedding cake I made for  Saturday and it was the biggest hit ever!!
IT is so moist and delicious. My husband, who is a chocoholic was so amazed with it, he's been having the leftover scraps  for breakfast. Thank you so much for this GREAT recipe!
I love this web site. Every recipe I have made from this site has been wonderful!

WOW, wonderful recipe! I made this carrot cake today for my husband's birthday. Carrot cake is his favorite cake in the world, and this was my first attempt ever making one. It turned out absolutely perfect, and he agreed. I baked it in silicone flute tube bakeware and had to bake it at 350 for 55 minutes.  It was perfect.  As others suggested, I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup veg oil.  For the frosting, I used only 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 and I added about 4 ounces of cream cheese.  This recipe is a definite keeper!!!

Made this for a birthday party and there was only a few pieces left (other desserts). I did cut back on the powdered sugar in the icing, I would have liked to have had more cream cheese for mine but didn't have extra. I will definitely be making again.

I made cup cakes with this recipe, they were very good but they seemed a bit too oily.  Next time I will use less oil and maybe add some applesauce like other reviewers have done.

Excellent recipe - very moist and tasty. I used 2 9" round pans and made a layer cake (baked in about 30 minutes) - turned out great!! This will be the recipe I use for carrot cake from now on.

I read as many as the reviews as I felt I needed.  I used the suggestions of 1c brown sugar,1c white sugar and the applesauce and oil combination.  I baked 2 9" rds for 34 min.  I lined the pans with parchment paper and sprayed that with a bit of Pam.  I brought the cake to work for a co-workers B-Day and it was a super hit.  The B-Day "boy" said, "it was the best carrot cake he has ever eaten.  Now it can't get any better than that.  He was not the only one to comment on this cake.  We have 9 people in our office and I left work with a empty cake plate.  Thank you very much!  Will make this recipe whenever I need a carrot cake.  For a lighter version of icing go to "Whipped cream cream cheese frosting" at this site.  Awesome! ***********

I should have reviewed this recipe months ago. I always wanted to make a carrot cake for our anniversary because we had a carrot cake for our wedding cake. Well, eleven years later, I finally did! I chose this recipe because it was a pure, unadulterated, carrot cake - no coconut, pineapple, or raisins. I cannot imagine how a carrot cake could taste any better (it was even better than our wedding cake, which was baked by a professional chef)!

This was really good!  I made a few substitions.  I only used one cup of oil, added an 8 oz can of pineapple that I pureed in the blender (had the consistancy of apple sauce), added a cup of shredded coconut, used a dash of nutmeg and allspice and doubled the cinnamon.  I also left out the nuts. . . I will add walnuts next time and make my husband pick them out!  I baked this in two 9 inch cake pans for about 45 minutes.  I will definitely keep this recipe!

I've had this recipe in my 'box' for ages, and had made the icing for another cake before.  For Christmas I asked my grandfather what he would like for desert and Carrot Cake was his choice so I tried the complete recipe, which was a great hit!  I made it as directed (no changes) and everyone loved it (especially the icing).  I felt there was something 'missing' in the cake, but it was delicious and very moist (and did I mention the icing is perfect?).  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for my mother's 61st birthday and received great reviews.  Very moist and delicious.  I followed Jonathan's advise and used 1 cup unsweetened applesauce and 1/2 cup of oil (for the oil), added 1/2 t. allspice and nutmeg and substituted walnuts for pecans for the cake and frosting.  Instead of mixing the walnuts with the frosting, pressed them on the sides.  I also made a layered cake.  It turned out great!! This is a keeper.  Thank you Tammy.

This too was my first try making Carrot Cake. I made it for Easter & everyone loved it!! I halved the recipe, since there was only 5 of us. And made a one layer 8" round. I did use the applesauce idea & it was simply wonderful & moist. I used walnuts in lieu of pecans & decorated the top & sides with the nuts. It looked as impressive as it tasted. Thank You Tammy for this recipe, my husband already "told me" I will be making it again! ;)

This was my first attempt at making a carrot cake from scratch.  I found this recipe easy to follow, and even implented some of the substitutions mentioned in other reviews.  First I replaced the oil with margarine, and using only half of that required amount and substituting the rest with applesauce. I also added about 1/8 of tsp of nutmeg, added pinepple, and substituted pecans for walnuts (which I already had on hand).  I made the frosting a little lighter on guilt : ) by using the lower fat cream cheese, only 1/4 cup (or less) of butter, and only 3 cups of powered sugar.  The cake ended up tremendously moist, and Oh-So Good!!  Next time around, I'll probably drain some of the pineapple juice off, and add cloves for a bit more flavor.

This cake was very moist and tasty and really easy to make. I baked it in 2 round baking tins and used another cream cheese icing recipe in the middle. It received rave reviews from all who tried it. I found that it is better if you let it sit overnight. It was a little crusty at the top and didn't smell as amazing as i expected when i took it out of the oven but the next morning it was soft and moist and and was really aromatic. (Perhaps the ingredients had a chance to mix and infuse)

I have a food processer for grating but I think carrot cake tastes much better with finely grated carrots so I take the extra time to grate by hand. My family loves this cake, especially with lots of cream cheese frosting!Instead of using all the oil, I use applesuace for half of it.

This is an excellent cake.  My mother throught it was the best carrot cake she had ever eaten.  I did have to increase the baking time an additional 10 minutes but I was using a somewhat heavy pan.  Thanks for such a great recipe.

Made using gneebeanie compiled modifications and it came out great. I doubled the frosting because I made it as a layered cake, but that proved unnecessary... the called-for frosting is plenty. I also used walnuts rather than pecans. 

The frosting is amazingly light and not overpoweringly sweet. It's just a really good, subtle flavor. The cake is fantastically moist and, again, not too sweet (particularly considering the quantity of sugar).  It's an overall amazing recipe. I plan to try it with fruits rather than carrots sometime to see what happens.

This recipe is VERY good. I didn't make any changes because none are necessary. Every recipe I see on this website, people in the reviews are always saying "I changed this, that, etc."...I never understand why, unless it's obvious that the regular recipe is lacking something, which this isn't. The final product is amazing. I did leave the pecans out, though, because I only like nuts by themselves, having them inside other foods ruins the texture for me. But anyway, this recipe is definitely a keeper. No changes necessary!

PS: If you have a food processor, put your carrots in there instead of using a grater, it's much quicker. I used a grater at first and it took ages.

I have made this cake 3 times now, and I love it! So does everyone else who has tried it. I make it for my dad's birthday, and he prefers walnuts, so I use walnuts instead of pecans and it comes out great. I saw another reviewer said they used this recipe specifically because it didn't have pineapple in it, and that's actually why I chose it also. I did find that even though I make a double batch of the cake, I only need a single batch of the icing for it.

This recipe is almost the same as "Gigi's Carrot Cake" recipe by Emeril Lagasse. I'm not sure which appeared first on the internet, either way, it sure is the best carrot cake I've ever made and eaten.
This is a very sweet cake, and I think the cream cheese frosting is way too sweet. When I make it next time, I'd cut down the amount of oil to 3/4C and add 1/4C of sour cream or yogurt. I will also add only 2C powdered sugar to the frosting, so the sweetest doesn't over power the tanginess of the cream cheese.

It easy and yummy. I added walnuts instead of pecans and it was perfect. The frosting was a little to sweet so I would suggest adding more cream cheese.

Simply amazing! I  made cupcakes with this recipe. Makes about  2 dozen. Baked them for 25 mins and they came out perfect. As suggested by other reviews, I made a few adjustments: 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white, 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg , 1 extra teaspoon vanilla. For the icing I used 1.5 cups of powdered sugar and added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Mmm this is now my go to recipe for carrot cake and cream cheese icing!

The center of the cakes turned a different color and the taste was bland and the cake was too oily.  If I could do over I would get rid of the baking soda, and replace some of the oil with applesauce.

Wonderful recipe - I made this for my husband's birthday and it came out great! The only reason I didn't give it a full 5 stars was because the frosting was a bit too sweet for our tastes. It was still great, but pretty sugary. Also, despite greasing and flouring my pans (I used two rounds), the cakes stuck quite a lot. I was able to pry it out and put it back together though. The cake was moist, flavorful but not too spicy and very light.

I've used this recipe for about 8 years and it's my husband's absolute favorite.  It is excellent as is, but what I've done a bit differently over the past couple of years is add 1/8 tsp cinnamon to the frosting and an extra tsp of vanilla.   I also add an extra tsp of vanilla to the cake mix.  I've also recently started using coconut oil (for baking) instead of vegetable and it's great.  It's an equal substitution with the oil.

This was the first time I've made carrot cake. I made the recipe as written and took it to Thanksgiving at my in-laws. It was a hit! Very moist and the frosting wasn't too sweet. I'll be making this again soon!

This recipe was simply divine! I made some adjustment as one of the reviewer suggested. Added crushed pineapple, some nutmeg, an extra tsp of V extract, and cinnamon. I also substituted one cup of white sugar with brown sugar. I like golden raisins so I added about 1/4 cup. This paired with cream cheese frosting was so good. Even my little ones gobbled them up.

I have tried much better carrot cakes. This one... without any change on the recipe was very oily and the center of the cake sank. The flavour... ok... but still I think it could have been much better. Probably won't do it again.

A lot of times I read the modifications suggested.  I did not this time based on the excellent ratings.  My cake fell, it was too oily and despite adding more cinnamon and some ginger it still didn't do it for me.  I have been baking for years and never had these issues.  I compared it to another recipe I have but did not use and it uses less oil and less sugar than this recipe.  Most likely I will not use this again.

I followed the recipe as directed above. Absolutely fantastic.I made them into cupcakes for breakfast without frosting. Beautiful balance with the spices and very moist. Shared them with neighbors family over coffee and the kids couldn't get enough. Great recipe don't change a thing.

The person posting the "original" recipe laid an awesome foundation.  (I'm pretty darn sure the recipe here has been modified dozens and dozens of times).  The person posting this recipe in my humble opinion laid a good foundation.  I did not have to re-invent the wheel.  I only had to make a few tweaks to suit my taste...Recipes are written for the most part as a guideline.  I for one benefit from knowing that sugar/oil can be reduced/substituted...to me it means I can increase the frosting!

Great recipe! I have used it for my birthday cake. I have followed the recipe scrupulously: it was delicious! All guests were delighted and took another slice although the rest of the meal was quite filling...
Thanks for sharing that recipe!

I followed the recipe as is except I didn't add raisins because our family doesn't like them. I also did two batches; one with the pecan and one without any nuts. Let me just say that both batches were So so so delicious and easy to make! The frosting is amazing,  you will want to take the extra few mind to make that :)

I use the left over grated carrots when I make carrot juice from my juicer.  I also cut down on the sugar.  You may also need to add extra baking time if you are using one large loaf pan.  When I used two smaller loaf pans the time was fine.  Overall love this cake very moist and tasty.

This is literally the best recipe ever for carrot cake. I was reading review after review and decided to give it a try. It came out perfect the first time. I especially love how the pecans were included on this. My family keeps on asking me to make it again.

This cake was fantastic.  Brought some to work and everyone thought it came from a professional cake shop.  Moist and delicious.  The frosting recipe will also be used for other cakes.  If you are looking for a cake recipe, make this one.

I made the recipe exactly as it was written except for the nuts because my husband cant eat them. This cake was unbelievably moist and delicious. I didn't give it 5 stars because of the amount of oil that is in the cake. Next time I make it I am going to substitute applesauce for some of the oil. It does not taste oily, just trying to live healthier. I did cream the eggs, oil, sugar and vanilla first, then in a separate bowl mixed together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon. Then added the flour mix to the wet. I stirred just enough to blend then folded the carrots in. I did it this way to minimize the amount of stirring while making sure all ingredients are fully mixed in. This was a very good recipe and I will absolutely make it again. Thank you very much for sharing!

I also chose this recipe because it didn't have pineapple in it (like one other reviewer).  It looked like it was the closest to my Mother's recipe, which I've lost.  I thought it was terrific!  I made it just as shown, and I can't imagine any carrot cake being better.  Thank you Tammy!

Excellent recipe. The cake was very moist and delicious and the frosting complimented it well. The only substitutions I made were 1 tsp each of baking powder and soda (instead of 2). For the frosting, I only used one cup of sugar (tasted as I went along and found one cup sweet enough). Definitely making this again.

It is an awesome cake. I changed the oil amount and added applesauce. I also changed the sugar to 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. It was very moist. I would definitely make it again

Recipe is delicious! But I've tried making them as cupcakes and they get huge and over flow. I recently tried only filling the liners half full and still too much. They also sink in the middle, again they are sill delicious just not nice to look at and very hard to get out of tins.

What a great recipe especially for a sweet tooth. Very easy to make. Loved grating the carrots. It's interesting to know that the cake browned to cinnamon and unfortunately not anything to do with carrots. I'd like to see something made naturally with them besides the carrots. Carrot juice for instance. For those who have difficulties getting the top to become stable, you could just turn the cake upside down, of course, after it cools, I've just made the mistake with the carrot cake, but it still looks good. You might want to think about the sugar amount though. I've been worried about all these sweet recipes and it doesn't seem to matter how much sugar is in something before it worries you and your teeth but I'd like for this to be more on the cream cheese side... Again there really wasn't anything wrong with this recipe because it's made and tastes exactly the way a store bought Carrot Cake would taste like....

This cake was delicious! !  I had to omit the pecans and added crushed pineapples and raisins because my grandson has a nut allergy and it was a special treat for him.   It was so moist!  I will definitely make this one again,  This one is a keeper!

Made this for my girlfriend for her birthday and everyone loved it! I did do a few changes and this is now our favorite cake recipe on the site. 1) did 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar. 2) did 1/2 cup canola oil and 1 8oz can crushed pineapple, drained, instead of the 1.25 cups oil it calls for. 3) +1 tspn cinnamon, vanilla. 4) used walnuts instead of pecans. 
For the frosting, I added a little less than 3 cups of powdered sugar and it was perfect to our liking! And plenty sweet. :) 
Great recipe!

Made this cake for my housemates and everyone loved it! Perfectly moist and not too sweet. Due to a lack of certain ingredients, I made just the basic cake, no pecans and no icing, but it was deliciously simple. Next time, I will go for the simple cake again, but with a side of ice cream or vanilla yogourt.

For all you that have sinking middle: 1. make sure your baking soda is fresh 2. don't over beat the batter 3. Don't add too much baking soda or powder. 4. Don't open your oven until the cake is at least 80% finished baking 5. Don't let your batter sit around, get it into a PRE-HEATED oven as soon as you are finish combining the ingredients.

I consider myself a pretty strong baker, but this recipe left me disappointed. Unfortunately, I followed the directions as written instead of reading page of reviews/revisions. While the flavor was okay, there was way too much of a baking soda flavor for me. I'm not sure why folks are rating it 5 stars, but it barely earns a 2 star rating. I'll keep searching for authentic 5 star carrot cake ratings.

VERY YUMMMY! I recommend to NOT change a thing, this recipe is amazing on its own! My mother in law even tried it and swore before trying it that the one in the 'joy of cooking' recipe book was the best, until she tried this! This was my very first time making it, I read many many reviews before and was a little hesitant as many people changed or added ingredients... I did NOT change a thing and it was perfect! I did use 2 9" round pans, and did the same as others, put it in for around 35 - 40 min (I live in the mountains so it took a little longer)

Everyone in our household loved this cake. No changes made, followed the recipe to a T and it turned out AMAZING! No oily taste, no baking powder/soda taste, it didn't rise too high and overflow, nor did it sink in the center. Will be saving this one and using it for years to come.

Good recipe for the home baker. But you won't get a nice domed top if that's what you're looking for; the recipe is a bit too wet. Plus it uses baking soda without an activator for it. Baking soda needs an acid such as lemon juice, buttermilk, vinegar, pineapple, brown sugar, etc. to make it work. I was making mini loaves from this recipe and wanted a nice domed top. So after some testing, I made the following modifications:

Add 1 cup additional flour
Add 1 tsp cider vinegar

These modifications gave me exactly what I was looking for. It firmed up the cake a bit, and gave me a nice domed top. Looks much nicer.

Update to previous review: some reviewers mentioned that the cake needed ginger/nutmeg, etc. I have now made this cake 3 times using 1t ground cinnamon, 1t Chinese five spice powder. Delicious. Also, I live in a part of the world where cream cheese is hard to come by so I never make the frosting. Doesn't need it.

I have made this recipe 3 time in 2 weeks it is the hit and requested "tastes like more" I didn't do anything different to the recipe. The only thing I did was used my baking skills and limited the mixing of the batter. I didn't have the cake center fall. It is most diffidently the easiest as well as the best I ever made and gave away (OK I had a  piece from each cake)

Beautiful, easy and delicious!  I did use half brown and white sugar and used 3/4 cup of oil with 1/2 cup of applesauce.  Thanks Tammy for the great recipe.

I think this is the first time I've reviewed a recipe on Allrecipes but this is the best carrot cake EVER EVER - everyone who tastes it absolutely raves about it - "To die for" is the most heard comment!!
And I have to agree with KAELHA's review - rate the recipe please! not your recipe after changing it! I have no issues with people changing/altering/improving - more power to you!! I just try the recipes as is - and let me say again - this is the best carrot cake EVER!!!

Really good carrot cake, according to my husband. :) All the kids devoured it, and he said it was one of the best he's had, and carrot cake happens to be one of his favorites. Only changes I made was to do half white/ half brown sugar, 3/4 cup olive oil, and 8 oz of crushed pineapple - and omit pecans due to preference. Thank you for a great recipe, I will be making again I am sure!

Baked my first carrot cake! I baked it in the form of cupcakes at 175 degrees C for 20-25 mins. The only modifications I made was add an extra teaspoon of cinamman and replaced pecans with walnuts. I didnt make the frosting though. 

The cake was good, soft and moist, and tasted better the next day! However I felt it was too oily as I could see oil at the bottom of the cupcake wrapper after eating the cake. So next time I will use less oil!

Apart from that it was a goooddd  carrot cake!

Great carrot cake! I halved the recipe and baked mine in a 9x9 pan for 40 min--perfect! I also substituted raisins for pecans because I didn't have any pecans on hand. Served with pineapple chunks. Sooo good!

I felt like this was missing something, and I made it exactly as written. The cake itself needed something, and was very oily. If I were to give this recipe another try (which I probably wont) I might use applesauce in place of some of the oil as some other reviews suggested. Also, the frosting was WAY too sweet and didn't taste like cream cheese enough. Use another recipe for the frosting.

Excellent cake. Its a pleaser. I didn't much care for the cream cheese frosting, but thats a personal preference because i dont really care for really sweet deserts. My husband who is a sweet eater fell in love with this and he hates carrots. I tried a little lemon juice on my peice to neautralize it a little, i loved it.

** Made the recipe exactly as stated with absolutely no substitutions **

Cake fell in the middle (good thing I'm frosting...) despite a perfect oven temperature (I always use a thermometer), perfectly done centers (tested), not opening my oven except at the end of cooking time, not beating too much air into the batter, brand new baking powder and soda, baking it right after mixing it, single layer baking (not stacked), handling the pans gently when removing, basically everything I know to do to help cakes not fall since other reviewers complained of similar problems. No idea why they fell, but I'm not upset about it since I'm frosting anyway:)

Tasted a lot like muffins. A very light texture, and not a lot of sweetness, made them taste more like muffins than cake. In my experience, carrot cakes have been heavier and denser. Not incredibly sweet, but definitely sweeter and more cake like.

Great tasting, but I'll keep looking for my perfect carrot cake recipe...

Absolutely amazing!  This will be my go-to carrot cake recipe from now on.  Followed the very helpful suggestions in the review by gneebeanie and it was the best ever!  I made it into cupcakes and it took a long time baking (almost 30 minutes), but they were very moist and delicious!

A friend of mine requested a Carrot Cake for his birthday. This recipe was recommended by several AR friends so I decided to give it a try. Beware if you try to use this recipe to make cupcakes only fill your cupcake liners half way or the batter will overflow during baking. The only thing I changed was I used my butter cream frosting as it is easier to decorate with. Thank you for the great recipe.

Thank you Tammy for a fantastic recipe!  I did not change a thing; it was for a birthday and it was a hit - moist and full of flavor.  It was like walking thru a land mine to locate the reviews of those who actually tried your recipe, but I believe those who followed your recipe really were in for a treat. I challenge you to try the unaltered revile of Tammy. Thanks again.  This is a keeper.

Amazing recipe, however, I used 1 more egg, and for the sugar I made it one brown 1 white. As well I added some raisins too, and lessened the amount of cinnamon. but it is totally good!
As well, I did not use any baking soda. My parents loved the cake and said it really tastes good. My brothers liked it too. 
Now it is my second time to make this cake and meanwhile am writing this I can smell the sweet aroma of my cake while it is baking! =D
Since my family prefers healthy recipes I don't really do the frosting. But still it is deliciously good!

Very delicious!! I am a novice cook and dislike cooking BUT it is my husbands bday and carrot cake is his fav. I followed the instructions exactly. The cake (including the batter), was great tasting and moist. The frosting was perfect for me, a little sweet for my husband. Would make it again - if I had to for the husband!

i made this exactly how it asked and it was wonderful with one problem... the hole in the middle.... think ill try the apple sauce that other ppl have suggested maybe the batter is too wet? other than that i ate too much of it.. once the cream cheese was on it ( even though it has plenty of flavor alone) i couldnt stop eating it :)

This was AWSOME! I did not change the recipe at all and it came out great. I think the only difference was that I used some dehydrated carrots (that were hydrated of course) and use almost 2x as much and I wouldnt have changed a thing. Thanks for this one I will be making this one again!

The best carrot cake ever!  My guests raved and there was no cake left by the end of the party.  Left out the nuts since my family was allergic.   Added 1 small Motts applesauce and it was so moist.  Made 2 - 9" round cakes.  There was not enough frosting to ice the sides.  Just put icing between the 2 cakes and on top.  But that was enough since the icing is very rich.  Make this carrot cake, I promise you won't be dissappointed!

This is the exact recipe my family has been using for generations.  It is absolutely perfect.  (In my opinion, pineapples and raisins in carrot cake is a sin.  The only changes I make are adding a full tablespoon of cinnamon and leaving the nuts out of the cake and just having it in the frosting, which I add an extra teaspoon of vanilla.)

This recipe is AWESOME as is. I made it because I don't like the pineapple in the others. This is my FOURTH time making it. I will never get a new recipe...ever. So thank you. Again, I wouldn't change a thing.

This is the best most moist carrot cake i've ever tasted! my friends and family love it and it lacks nothing. The only change I made was using one cup of brown sugar and one of white but I doubt using all white or all brown would make a huge difference in how AWESOME this cake is..

Amazing! My wife and I made this for thanksgiving dinner with the family, and it turned out great! Recipe made two 9" rounds. I made a couple other test batches and tried using less oil and supplementing it with apple sauce...worked pretty well, but not quite the same moistness. We made this again last night for some friends, but used sweet potato in stead of carrot...worked like a charm! 

The only thing I did change on purpose was the frosting.  We needed a little extra sugar (3/4 C.) to make the frosting a little more firm.

My first home-made carrot cake and it was FANTASTIC! I will never use a box cake again - this was too easy and so much more healthier without all those added preservatives! The few changes I made based on other reviews: 1 cup brown / 1 cup white sugar, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and used 3/4 oil & 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce. I cut down the sugar in the frosting to about 2 1/2 cups because I wanted to be able to taste the cream cheese - it was PERFECT! Made it for my husband's birthday yesterday and I had to force him to eat diiner before having another slice last night! I'll be surprised if there's any left when I get home from work today!

This carrot cake is wonderful with the few changes I made.  I used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 applesauce.  I split the sugar half white and half brown.   I used pear essence and added a half teaspoon nutmeg.  I grated the carrots on the large side of the grater.  This is my new go to carrot cake.  It did take about an hour and twenty minutes to bake though.

This recipe turned out well. I had no trouble with rising/falling at all. Good texture, nice and moist. I made them into cupcakes. Second time increased cinnamon to tbsp, plus 1 tsp each ginger, nutmeg and allspice. Omitted nuts in the batter, added to the sides. Wonderful!

This is a very tasty basic carrot cake recipe (no pineapple!). For those of you that have been having problems with the cake falling, it may be an altitude issue. I am at a little over 6,000 feet and it made the cake completely collapse the first time I tried the recipe. In order to compensate, I reduced the sugar to 1 and 1/2 cups, and the baking powder and baking soda to 1 teaspoon each instead of 2. It worked like a charm and the cake came out wonderfully the second time around!

I made this cake for a birthday party, and I thought it was AMAZING! The frosting was perfect, and the only adjustment I made to it was using 3.5 cups of sugar. i will definitely make this again although next time I think I will run the carrots through the food processor.

Love this recipe. Tasted like restaurant quality. I baked two cakes for 27 minutes in two round pans then layered them. Came out perfectly. Make sure to grease pans well.

My favorite mods: No nuts, only used 1 cup of oil, only used 1/2 stick butter in frosting, added powdered sugar to taste
A deliciously moist, flavorful carrot cake!  Using the full amount of oil (as I did the first time I made it) makes the cake rather greasy.

This really is the best carrot cake ever!  Make exactly like the recipe - don't even try to change it - it's perfection.  I put pecans in the cake, but not the icing.  My aunts, grandma, everyone wants this recipe.  Make sure to store in refrigerator.  Enjoy!!!

This was delicious.  I blended the ingredients in my food processor (3 step process) and shredded the carrots in it as well.  I used the applesauce/oil combo and used less nuts than it called for.  It was moist (yay!) and just delicious!  Used less sugar for the frosting and it was plenty sweet.

Followed the recipe exactly.  I am not fond of too sweet or oily cakes and found this to be very sweet (too much for me) and too oily.  Nevertheless my husband and daughter ate them all up.  I'll probably cut down the sugar and oil next time.

I was not even a fan of carrot cake until I tried this. My sister mentioned carrot cake was her favorite cake so on her birthday I baked this for her and everyone loved it including me. This was really delicious. I am going to use anyone's birthday as an excuse to make this again.

Delicious! I did use 1 c less icing sugar and used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar, and added some crushed pineapple. I did think the crushed pineapple was unecessary. The cake was almost too moist.

This is a delicious carrot cake recipe. I also substituted 1c brown sugar instead of 2c white sugar, extra teaspoon of vanilla, and 3/4c oil and 1/2c apple sauce. very moist cake. however, i only used 2c of powdered sugar for the frosting and it still came out too sweet for my taste.

Suuuuuuuperb!!!!! I love love it! Perfectly MOIST and crumb, a bit oily thought with the 3/4c oil and 1/2 cup homemade orange+berry sauce (just want I had, next time will try with some applesauce). Will also cut the sugar to 1/2C white and 1C brown, cus 2 cup came out too sweet for our taste. Not sure if it is a good thing or not but can't taste the carrot at all :) (I hate carrots). Otherwise, followed the recipe without top frosting (just too lazy).
18th of June: I made another batch yesturday with 2 cups of white sugar only and it turned out not as good as the 1 cup white and 1 cup brown I made last time. The sweetness was... plain, while with the brown sugar, it as more caramel like. Oh, I had no baking soda and used only 2 tsp bp and 1tsp instant yeast, it turned out ok! not as fluffy but ok :)

This carrot cake is really yummy. I've made it about 6 times. The first time I followed the recipe as written and it was really yummy but it fell in the middle. Since then, I've followed the suggestions of other reviewers and it's AMAZING. I do 1 c white sugar, 1 c brown sugar, add 1 extra t vanilla, add 1/4 t nutmeg, add 1 extra t cinnamon, no pecans.

I use 2 x 9 in round cake pans and baked for about 45 minutes. I also cut the sugar in the frosting down to 3 cups. Four is delish but everyone agreed that 3 cups is better and doesn't overpower the cake like 4 cups.

This is fantastic!!  The only change I made was to use cake flour (because I had it).  I didn't make the frosting either because we prefer to eat our cake without it, but otherwise the cake was made as written.  I used my Kitchen Aid shredder attachment and shredded the carrots finely.  Had no problems (mush as others have said).  

It is moist and delicious, if a little nutty.  I may half the nuts next time, or chop them more finely.  But we love this!!  Will definitely made again.

Everyone loved this cake on easter. I did follow others reviews and added the applesauce, extra cinnamon and vanilla.  What i got was a perfectly dense, moist, delicious carrot cake.  
I made the cake two days before easter and wrapped it tight in plastic wrap and stored it in a cool dry place.  On easter i unwrapped it and iced it.

I made this for Easter then brought the leftover to work.  Everyone loved it.  The only thing I did different was to make 1-1/2 batches of the frosting then I cut the cake in half and made a two layer square cake.  One woman at work even told me it was "as good as Mom's"

This carrot cake is super delicious! Follow the advice of the top review and you won't be disappointed! I also substituted 1/2 cup of the oil with applesauce, added an extra tsp vanilla, used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugars, and added a tsp (or more) of cinnamon along with a little nutmeg and touch of ginger. I did not add pineapple as that review suggested only because I don't care for pineapple. The frosting is perfect! You can adjust the sugar depending on your sweet tooth, but the measurements are just fine!
***Edit: 10/1/2015 - I have since made this multiple times adding the drained can of crushed pineapple, and it is even better! This is still my go to carrot cake recipe!

This is so easy to make and simply delicious! I took it to a work potluck and got many requests for the recipe. My only modifications were to substitute 3/4 cup of the vegetable oil for applesauce, and I added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg because I like spiciness. Even without my modifications, I think this would be an exceptional cake.

This was such a great carrot cake recipe...I turned it into cupcakes! It made 30! The only thing I changed was I substituted 1/2 cup of the white sugar for light brown sugar. I also used a food processor for the carrots...much easier. For the icing I only used 3 cups of confectioners sugar...was perfect for my taste....I only had 1/2 teaspoon left of vanilla so I used pure almond extract..about 1/4 teaspoon and I didn't have any real butter so I used Smart Balance...this icing was SO delicious...This will be the only carrot cake recipe I ever use!!

Made this cake today and it came out moist & yummy!  Did substitute 1 C of white sugar for brown as suggested by others.  For the frosting, I used 1 block of butter, about a cup of powdered sugar, 8oz of cream cheese, and 1 tsp. of vanilla.  I was able to frost my 13x9 generously.

Great recipe. The only changes I made was to replace half of the oil with applesauce, reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added an extra cup of carrots. The cake turned out very moist with lots of flavor.
I used this frosting recipe too  and only used 2 cups of powdered sugar - it was plenty sweet.
I also topped the cake with toasted pecans.

I have tried this recipe three times. Each time, I have had the same result. Cake rises, and overflows the pan all over my oven, then falls like a brick. I live in Colorado, don't know if the high altitude affected this but I followed the directions to the Tee. At this point, I would not reccomend this recipe.

Mmmm! I just finished a piece of this cake! 2nd time I have made it...Both times had to make 2 cakes! People at my work and my husband's BEG for it! FANTASTIC!! The only thing I change is I use 1/2 cup less oil and replace it with applesauce and use Walnuts instead of Pecans (personal preference). Recipe is perfect as is though! I love that it is a cake recipe for a 9x13 pan. So easy to make in a disposable foil pan and take/send somewhere. Love it! You can't go wrong!!

This was the first carrot cake I made. I used to buy cake mix in a box, never again! This was simple, delicious and a hit! My friends and hubby loved it, made it yesterday and both cakes are gone today. I read some other reviews and made only 2 changes. I used 1 1/2 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Instead of adding 1 cup of chopped pecan in the frosting mix. I simply sprinkle on top of the frosting. I used 1/2 cup instead of 1. I'm not a big fan of nuts. It was great I could have done with less pecans but everyone else said it was perfect. Also I had a lot of extra cream cheese frosting left after I piled on both cakes. Next time I'll cut the frosting recipe in half. Will definitely make this again.

Delicious!  Only things I did different were substitute 1/2 cup plain applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil to cut down oiliness, and I didn't add any nuts to the icing.  I baked it in a 9 x 13 pan as directed, then, after cake had cooled, I cut it in half and made a smaller, rectangular layer cake. I would recommend refrigerating the cake until serving to firm up the icing a little and then refrigerate leftovers (if you have any!) to keep the icing firm and prevent the butter in the icing from going rancid..not that it'll last that long though!  This was an excellent cake!

This was AMAZING, It won me first prize in a small cooking competition with some friends! a few of them said that they did not usually like carrot cake at all, but LOVED this one.  I omitted the pecans, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Thanks! I will def. make this again.

I searched all over to find a recipe that did not call for pineapple in it and finally found this recipe.  My only concern was all the oil so I simply substituted it for unsweetened apple sauce and it turned out great.  Will definitely be making this over and over again.

Wow, it was just PERFECT.I made just one change and used one cup brown sugar and one cup white sugar, instead of both white.Brown sugar gives it a perfect color.Cake turned out pretty soft and moist, though next time I will squeeze some of the juice out of the shredded carrots so the cake is a bit firm so when I cut it ,it doesnt brittle.

I only changed one thing on this recipe. I cut back the oil to 1/2 a cup and used 3/4 cup applesauce. I made this for my husbands birthday with cream cheese icing. It was perfect.....I think the best carrot cake I've made yet, and he love it! This recipe is definately a keeper for me!

I made this instead of pumpkin pie this year for Thanksgiving and boy did I make the right choice! I LOVE carrot cake but absolutely can't stand when there are raisins in my cake! This recipe was perfect because it didn't call for raisins! Very good. Highly recommend it!

I halved this recipe and got 10 cupcakes out of it. I also added an extra tsp cinnamon, some nutmeg and used 1/2 canola 1/2 applesauce (unsweetened). It turned out fantastic! Baked at 350 for 25 mins and they came out so nice and moist. I heeded the advice of others and made sure not to overbeat, that is key as I had never baked carrot cake before and was afraid my cupcakes would fall. The frosting included is delicious as well. I served them up to a friend on Christmas night and after a full meal of jalapeno poppers, chicken, potatoes and green beans, he scooped up 2 one right after the other eagerly! Wonderful recipe.

I followed the recipe as written, and it was absolutely delicious! This was the first time I made carrot cake from scratch, and I will definitely use this recipe again. I brought the cake to a birthday party and they all raved about it!

I have been cooking for over 40 years and tried many different carrot cake recipes.  Some were good, others not so much.  BUT - I have to admit - this one TAKES THE CAKE as the very best.  I made a few adjustments however, this cake is an absolute keeper recipe! Bar none, the VERY best I have found - and being from the 70's generation when it was the thing to make - I have had the time to experience many.  Very moist and great integration of flavors.  The adjustments I made are slight but I have listed them: 1 c. white and 1 cup drk brown sugar, extra pecans in cake.  I also added an extra 4 oz. cream cheese and reduced the powdered sugar to 3 c. for the icing.  I did not mix the pecans in but sprinkled them on top and they were only very roughly chopped.  I even left it in the 9 x 13 pan.  Leftovers didn't make it 2 days and that is only 3 people.  I know, rather like gluttony however, it was that good.  Even ate it for breakfast one morning and I am not a sweet eater!  Try this one!

This recipe was great; however, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar (instead of just white sugar), 1/2 cup vegetable oil and added 3/4 cup cinnamon applesauce.  I also used 1 teaspoon each of baking soda and baking powder.  For the frosting, I also decreased the powdered sugar to about 3.5 cups (since 4 cups was much too sweet).  This was absolutely delicious!!

Perfection!  I made the following changes:  3/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar, walnuts instead of pecans, and for the icing I used about 3.5 cups powdered sugar instead of 4 and I didn't stir any nuts into the icing.  I made 24 cupcakes out of it and baked it at 350 for about 18 minutes.  My coworkers went nuts for them!!

I was very disappointed with this recipe. I was right to hesitate using so much rising agent because the cake completely caved-in in the center. It ended up being really greasy (I knew it called for too much oil) and too sweet (I also thought it called for too much sugar. I don't know why it rec'd so many 5-star reviews? In the end I should have stuck with good old Betty Crocker.

This was a decent cake, but as I was making it I was really surprised at the amount of baking powder and baking soda in the recipe.  I was right to be hesitant because I could taste the baking soda when we ate the cake.  Overall the cake was good, but I'd reduce the amount of baking soda and powder.

I followed the recipe as is written and the middle of the cake sunk. I did not open the oven to "check" nor did I add extra ingredients. I do live a mile above sea level, which may have been the cause. However after reading several reviews it appears others had the same problem. I spent a lot of time (and money) preparing to make this cake for guests and am frustrated it didn't turn out well. Hope your luck is better than mine!

This is my first time making carrot cake.  I made them into cupcakes, and it turned out really well!  If you do cupcakes, be sure to check on them at 20 minutes because mine were done around then.  I used most of the suggestions from other reviews (I increased the cinnamon, subbed some brown sugar for white, added nutmeg, subbed some applesauce for the oil, and used crushed pineapple), and it came out fantastic.  However, next time, I'm going to skip the pineapple, as I thought it was gross getting little bits of pineapple in my cake.

This is a fabulous recipe!  I made this today and everyone loved it. I used nine inch round pans, this recipe was the perfect amount for that size. The only changes I made was the sugar, I used half brown and half white and I added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon. Thanks so much for sharing this delicious cake recipe!!

Excellent carrot cake, very moist and delecious!  The only change I made was to use one 1c. brown sugar with 1c. white sugar, only becuase I love brown sugar so much.  I used two 9" round cake pans, turned out beautifully.  The frosting is to die for as well!

I made this for my first Easter supper with my parents.  It was wonderful as written!!!!  My mom (who isn't a huge fan of carrot cake) was totally blown away by this recipe.  The leftovers went to other friends who also loved it!  Thank you Tammy for this recipe, it's been added to my "printed and personal" recipe book and there it will stay!

I made cupcakes from this recipe. The only thing I did differently was use 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar. They were very yummy and moist. Thanks for the great recipe!

Fantastic! I followed the directions exactly and it came out wonderfully. The best part was that all I had to get at the store was the cream cheese for the frosting. All of the ingredients are things that most of us have on hand anyway. My suggestion - try the recipe the way it was written before making any changes. You may find that it's perfect just the way it is.

I have never been fond of carrot cake, but this is "the one."  Easy to prepare; took me a little longer because I shredded the carrots just before combining the ingredients. I didn't think the 13x9 would be large enough for a work potluck, so I made a 2nd layer with box cake. Never again! The taste, texture and moistness of this cake put the box mix to shame. Only change was substituting brown sugar for white. Thanks for the phenomenal recipe!!

My boyfriend's favorite cake is carrot cake - so I decided to try this recipe for this birthday. I made just a few changes and it came out great. Instead of 2 cups of sugar, I did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar - it really added some great extra flavor. Also, instead of vegetable oil, I always use regular apple sauce. I do this for all of my cakes - its healthier and I think it comes out more moist. Also, I too added some pineapple. On a side note - the cream cheese frosting was WAY to sweet, so I had to go out and buy cream cheese frosting at the market, and it tasted just fine. I hope these suggestions help you! Yummy cake!!

This was absolutely amazing.  Moist and tasty...just perfect.  I wanted a recipe that DID NOT contain pineapple - this was one of the few that didn't.  Made the recipe just as written - and could not be happier with the results!!  One exception...I made it in a 9in springform and cut in half to add a layer of frosting between the layers and then all over the top.  I did make 1 1/2 times the frosting to accomodate the middle layer.  YUM!

I made no modifications and I like it plenty well as is.  Only thing is that I checked it after 40 minutes and opening the oven made the middle fall. I recommend waiting the full 50 minutes before you check it.

I do have to admit that I made some changes to this recipe but I also have to say that it is ridiculously good and I'm sure it would be even without them!! I used 1 c applesauce + 1/4 c coconut oil instead of veg oil, added 1 tsp almond extract, added 1/2 tsp allspice and a dash of ginger and nutmeg, used whole wheat flour instead of white, raw sugar instead of white, and 3.5 c confectioner's sugar instead of 4 for the icing which was plenty sweet enough. Oh, and no nuts. It was delicious (better than restaurant quality) and I would absolutely make it again!!

This cake is awesome as is...I was going to change it basd on what others recommended, lke using half brown sugar, applesce,pineapple and stuff...but i didnt have any of it on hand so i followed the recipe exacly the way its written and the resus are amazing!! SOOO much better than the box mixes and i didnt even make the frosting--to make it a low calorie and less fat. STILL YUMMY!!


i made this again today after a logn time, and i used the cream cheese frosting II on this stie by jannie. very good combo. love it.
--update....using half applesauce and half oil reduces the oilyness and greasyness of the cake the next day without taking away from the taste

I made these into cupcakes. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, and 2/3 cup oil and 1/3 cup applesauce. I also was very generous with the carrots and left out the pecans (although they would be better with them, I just didn't have any on hand.) These cupcakes were delicious and extremely moist! Next time I'll replace more of the oil with applesauce though to make it healthier and it didn't seem to have an effect on the taste or texture. This recipe made 24 good sized cupcakes.

The best carrot cake ever!  I made it as a birthday cake in a bundt pan.  It took an extra 10 minutes to bake.  I added a can of crushed pineapple like other reviewers suggested and 1 cup brown sugar in place of 1 cup white.  I also used 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil.

This is my third time making this cake and my husband loves it. The worst part however is the shredding. Here are some hints on shredding that I had to learn the hard way. :) 1. Don't buy baby carrots...it will take forever and you are more likely to cut your fingers! P.S. 4 large carrots = 3 cups. 2. Try holding two large carrots at once while rubbing over your shredder. 3. If you have a heavy duty food processor you can cut the carrots into little chunks and then put it in the processor. Mine isn't quite strong enough to handle this! 4. If all else fails buy pre-shredded, but it might be a little dry. Happy shredding!

I made loafs and a few muffins rather than a whole cake pan.  I added some raisins as well, and my husband and I LOVED it!  He's a fan of carrot cake, and this one definitely hit the spot.  Of course, this recipe called for quite a bit of sugar, which is my only problem with it, so we only had a little of it before bringing it over to my husband's medical school campus.  Let's just say the cake didn't hang around for longer before disappearing down med students' gullets:-)

OMIGOD! BEST CARROT CAKE EVER!!!! I was left speechless after tasting this cake I made. Couple things I did change per suggestions from other members: I used 1 CP white sugar and 1 CP brown sugar. I increased the vanilla to 1 TBSP (3 tsp). I increased the cinnamon to 1 TBSP (3 tsp). I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg. I used 3/4 CP oil and 1/2 CP unsweetened applesauce. The cake was so beautifully moist and spiced! Just perfect. I baked the cake in 2 round cake pans and stacked them with icing in the middle and on top. I doubled the icing, though, to make sure I had enough. I used only 5 CP of powdered sugar instead of 8 and it was plenty sweet. I also tripled the vanilla and left out the pecans. So good! I would give this 10 stars if I could!

I have only made one or two scratch cakes in my lifetime and this one was DELICIOUS! I made it for a birthday and it was a big hit.  I used walnuts instead of pecans, and added raisins and some orange zest. I also put coconut in the frosting. Thank you!! I will definitely make this one again!

This is a great cake. I made a layer cake out of mine, excellent. I don't generally change ingredients or make substitutions on a recipe until I've made it a few times, but I did reduce the amount of sugar I used in the frosting. Even with the reduction, it is VERY sweet...will use less next time, but that is a matter of taste. Still a great recipe!

I made this last night for my supervisor who wasn't at the office on Friday (Boss'Day).  I was very interested in all the reviews but I had to make it my own.  I took some of the ideas like the spices (always like more) and vanilla and I used the walnuts instead of the pecans.  But what my final version was adding only 3 cups of carrots, using 1/2 bag of coconut, 2 tbl of crushed pineapple and a hand full of raisins.  I also used less oil and added 1/2 buttermilk.  My supervisor and co-workers now rate this as #2 of the favorite cakes that I make for them (#1 is the Italian Cream Cake).  The middle did sink a little because I opened the door.  I will make this again and again.  Thanks for a Great Recipe, it's a keeper!!!!

I made this with all of gneebeanie's suggestions.  It was truly fantastic.  I baked it in three 8 inch layers.  I stacked and frosted two, kept the other layer for unfrosted (fewer calories).  It was light, moist, tasty, and a real winner!

Hint to avoid "clumped" carrots:  I shredded the carrots using my food processor twice.  First, through the top with the grater attachment.  Second in the lower part with the swirling blade.  This way I got finely shredded carrot pieces.  I added them slowly to the batter while mixing.  Worked fine!

It was easy to decide to try this recipe with all the 5 star reviews. I was not dissapointed! Best carrot cake ever, and did not make any changes. Thanks Tammy.

Very easy to make, delicious.  I tripled the recipe (abundance of carrots in this year's garden) and froze 2 cakes.

Really wonderful. I followed the advice of some other reviewers: 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar; substituted applesauce for half of the oil; and I left out the nuts. Very moist, and the frosting complemented really nicely. My boyfriend said it was the best carrot cake he had ever had, which is a high compliment. I will make this again.

I read the recipe and decided on it cause it sounded the best.  The frosting was delicious although I added about a cup less of confectionery sugar.  The cake itself however was a bit bland and not that moist.  I think after making it this time I'll probably replace the oil with an oil/applesauce mixture and also add some nutmeg.

I've made this cake twice now.  First time I made the 1 cup brown sugar/1 cup white sugar substitution and omitted the nuts.  The second time around, I reduced the oil by 1/4 cup (without substituting for anything for the oil), added some chopped walnuts, and made cupcakes instead.  Cooked at 350 degrees for 20-22 minutes.  Both times the cake was amazing - moist and delicious.

If there was a spot for more stars I would definitely add it!  My husband, who claimed that he didn't like carrot cake LOVED it.  The only subsitutions I made was walnuts instead of pecans (only because I was out of pecans).  The second thing I did, just because I was being creative, was to take 2 cups of raisins, soaked them in a amber rum until plump, drained and added them.  YUMMY!  Thank you Tammy!  This is definitely a keeper!

I LOVE THIS CAKE!!! I usually don't eat carrot cake, but I made one for my mom and I tried a piece and this is now a fav. The only thing I did was put 1/2c. applesauce and 1/2c. oil.

My 3 rating is rating this cake as written.  The only thing I did differently was use 1C white and 1C brown sugar,  a cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil (1 1/4 C oil is a lot of oil, so I was trying to cut down on fat) as well as some minor alterations to adjust for high altitude since I live about a mile high (raised temp 25 degrees, decreased sugar by 1 T, increased applesauce by 1T and decreased baking powder by 1/4 tsp).  I, also, made it in 2 9 inch pans (for about 25 minutes) and doubled the frosting to make a layered cake.  I tasted the batter after I'd made it as written and it was really bland.  So, I added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, another tsp of cinnamon and another tsp of vanilla.  With my changes, it was WONDERFUL!  I couldn't get my company to stop eating it.  I will definitely make this again!

the carrot cake was wonderful...HOWEVER, using my better judgement, i only used 1/2 the sugar called for in the frosting and thought it was still was way too sweet (and i have a big time sweet tooth!) i added more cream cheese to equal out the sweetness until i ran out of cream cheese and had to settle for what i had, which i still thought was too sweet.  I shared the finished product with our softball team for my bf's birthday and people were actually throwing away 1/2 eaten pieces stating it was too sweet!  my recommendation? only add a little sugar at a time to get it to how YOU like it.  you can always add more, but you cant take it out!

I made this the other day with the following 2 alterations: I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white, and I used 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 for the icing. While I know the recipe would be just fine with all white sugar, I like the added flavor of brown.  The recipe was delicious (even better the next day after everything has chilled).  I do think I would like to add some raisins and maybe use walnuts instead of pecans next time, but this is a fantastic base for anyone who likes their carrot cake with a few extras.  Thanks, this recipe is a keeper.

This is the most beautiful and delicious cakes!! It received rave reviews from EVERYONE who had a bite. I toasted the nuts and added extra toasted nuts to the iced sides of the cake for added taste and decoration. This is going to be the standard for which I judge all carrot cakes!

If I could give it ten stars, I would!  EVERYONE loves this cake.  I added a small can of pineapple (drained), extra vanilla and cinnamon, and 1/2 c spiced applesauce w/ 3/4 c vegetable oil instead of all oil.  I also did 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white.  People tell me I should open my own bakery when I make this cake!  It's that good.  Try it, you won't be dissapointed.  Thanks, Tammy, for a wonderful recipe.

Very delicious cake, and very easy to make. The only thing I changed was the eggs. My boyfriend is very allergic and since I wanted him to be able to eat some, I substituted 4 ripe bananas.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  I don't know where I went wrong :(.   I poured the mixture into a 9x13 baking pan just as the instructions specified - After 30 min,  I turned the oven light on and saw that the mixture had overflowed making a big mess inside my oven.  The cake was flat and messy,  the flavor was bland.  I was very disappointed because I was expecting an excellent result based on the reviews.

Wonderful carrot cake.  Very moist.  I used 1 C of oil and ½ C applesauce just to cut out some of the calories. I did as some others by using 1 C sugar and 1 C brown sugar. For personnel preference I added 1 C crushed pineapple, ½ C raisins and ½ C coconut.  This is the recipe that I will be using from now on.  Thank you.

The best carrot cake I've ever made/had, so good that I am making another one within 3 days! Also I took in the comments of adding pineapple (without the juice) and a bit of nutmeg. The best thing about this cake is it is so easy to make yet taste so good. Thanks for such an awesome recipe!

This cake needs more spice and flavour for me. The icing was also too sweet. Next time I will try it with some of the recommendations in the reviews.

Update: recommendations pay off! Please stop 5 starring recipes that you have to change so much though!!

This was absolutely delicious! Even when I accidentally kept it in the oven for too long the second time I was making it, it was still soft, moist, and scrumptious. Thank you for this amazing recipe!

This was good but not as spectacular as I was expecting. It was slightly eggy-tasting and not as spiced as I thought it would be. The frosting, however, was heavenly. I cut down the powdered sugar by about 1/2 cup and it was great!

There´s too much oil in this! And it is quite flavourless without the pineapple. I'll stick to the Awesome Carrot Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting, it's far tastier and smells less like fried carrots.

Cake turned out really well.  I read the reviews and adjusted like recommended 1) 3/4 cup oil + 1/2 cup apple sauce 2) 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar 3) 3 tsp cinnamon 4) 3 tsp vanilla 5) 1 cup crushed pinapple drained of fluids 6) 1/4 tsp nutmeg.   I made 2 x 9" cake pans of cake, I cooled it on rack and then cut it in half, then used the icing mixture in the middle and on top to make it a double layered carrot cake.  Oh, I also only used 2 cups of sifted icing for the frosting..I made it with 4 before and it was WAY too sweet.

I agree with SheilaP1 in I thought this recipe was bland.  I've made several carrot cakes recipes over the past several years, and opted to try this one given its "top 20" status.  The cream cheese icing saved this one for me.  As I was making it, I was astounded by the amount of sugar required, and the nutritional value chart - 582 calories per piece!!!  Just "OK" all around.

This recipe is DELICIOUS!! The first time i made it the center of the cake sunk. The second time i made it i replaced the vegetable oil with 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup olive oil, and the center did not sink. I also halved the recipe for the icing because i only like 1 layer of icing on my cake which was in a 9x13 pan. The icing was also great.

I made this carrot cake for Easter. I only made half a cake because there was only two of us. Grating the carrots was a pain, but the final product was worth it. It took 6 small to medium carrots to get 1 1/2 cups worth, so for a full recipe it would take about 12.

This recipe AS IS deserves 5 stars!!! Really simple and very delicious. I have also made various modifications (because I just always do) like adding nutmeg, some cloves, raisins and grated apple. I have also tried substituting 1/2 c. applesauce for oil and still the cake is great. I also cut the powdered sugar back by 1/2 c. the second time around. My advice is to remember to preheat your oven for at least 20 minutes to ensure even and thorough baking. Great recipe!

The best I ever made!!! In the kitchen I often make boo boos. This time I thought I was putting in my clear vanilla extract, but It actually was butter flavor extract. This was the best mistake I've ever made!! I will always use the butter extract now! I also followed other reviews and added  1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar 3 tbls. butter extract 8 oz. crushed pineapple 3 tsp. cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg left out the pecans and added them ontop with the icing as well as shaved coconut. Top notch!

Being that I've never made a carrot cake before, the recipe looked rather simple.  I would definitely recommend it.  The only thing is it could of been a tad bit more moist.  Other than that it was perfect.

This recipe was incredible.  I made it for Easter last year...my family, who are all used to great food thought it was the best carrot cake they had ever tasted.  It rivaled carrot cake that I've eaten in very fine restraunts.

My husband has eaten his fair share of carrot cake in his day.  He said this was by far the best.  Made it in two 8 inch layers with cream cheese icing.

This is the BEST carrot cake I have ever made. My husband doesn't like carrot cake and he LOVED this! Thank you Tammy! Followed advise of others. Decreased oil amount to  3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce. Used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar. Added 3/4 cup golden raisins. Decreased 10X sugar to 2 cups and still had leftover frosting. Used parchment paper on bottom of 13X9 pan -- a must to remove cake without breaking. Used glass pan so I lowered oven temp to 325* and baked about 45 minutes. After cooling cake for 10 minutes, put cooling rack on top of cake and turned cake out onto rack. Cool. Turn over again onto hard surface to frost and cut into pieces. Use spatula to lift pieces onto serving plate. You can then throw away parchment paper. No mess.

Need to add  applesauce or other mild fruit sauce in exchange for over half of  the the oil in this recipe  /I made as printed far to oily texture  I opened  new bottle of vegtable oil measured everything  as in recipe and this cake is overboard  oiley .  The moisture is oil.  I would add 1 extra  teaspoons of cinnamon.  No nutmeg in a carrot cake or pumpkin pie here.  I have noticed  all recipes have grate the carrots but no m ention of   what size grating is best even on a cheap grater they have  3 sizes .

This is the best recipe for carrot cake that I have found.  I followed the directions exactly other than leaving out the pecans.  It came out moist and delicious!  Even my brother, who doesn't like carrot cake, loved it.  Everyone who tried it thought it was excellent.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

If there were 10 stars, that's what I'd rate it. Served it to foodies, and they told me, unprompted, that it was the best carrot cake they'd ever had.

Great recipe! I did make some changes as suggested by other reviewers. For example: 1cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar . Very important to use the applesauce in replacement of all the oil suggested by the original recipe. Finally, the pecans are a great addition. The cake is nicely moist and great taste.

Per other suggestions, I substituted apple sauce for the oil, and used half brown sugar and half white. I also doubled the cinnamon and added a bit of nutmeg and a bit of ground cloves. The cake was extremely moist and delicious!!

This is another recipe that merits much more than five stars!!  This was one of the desserts that I served for Thanksgiving dinner, and it is outstanding.  Actually, this recipe very closely resembles one that I've used for quite a few years; the one exception being that my recipe calls for a tablespoon of cinnamon, which is what I used.  I did omit the pecans, but I like carrot cake to be just "carrot" cake.  Oh, and the frosting for this recipe is addicting.  Thanks for posting this recipe.  We all enjoyed this one.

Followed directions exactly. Best carrot cake recipe ever, extremely moist. Had to give 2/3's of it away to keep from eating the whole thing at one time. Got rave reviews from everyone that tried it.

Awesome! I omitted the nuts and added 8 oz of crushed pineapple (drained). Also substituted whole wheat flour, and used applesauce instead of oil.

This is by far the best carrot cake I've ever tasted.I read the reviews and made some changes and wow, fantastic. I added 1 8oz can of drained crushed pineapple & 1 cup of oil & added the drained pineapple juice. 2 cups of carrots with 3/4 cup of raisins.For the sugar 1 cup  white & 1 cup of light brown sugar.Also 1/2tsp nutmeg & 1/8tsp ground cloves. The frosting I used 2 1/2 cups of confectioners suger & 3tsp vanilla & 3/4 cup chopped pecans, let frosting stay a room temp.,this will make it easy to spread once cake is cool.Everything else stayed the same.Had to cook just alittle longer. This is a keeper.

Wow! This cake is AMAZING! I followed this recipe exactly except I used one cup of almonds and one cup of pecans, and I toasted them prior to adding to the batter and the icing. I mixed almonds with the batter and put pecans on the outside of the cake. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thank you!

P.S. Oh, and I also used two 9" round cake pans.

Ok I know this is the 1000th+ review, but I thought it deserved one more 5* rating. I used half white and half brown sugar and added some pumpkin pie spice, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe and it was delicious! I highly recommend!!!

Unbelievable!  I made a few changes myself based on previous reviews and have made this cake 3 times  now to rave reviews!!!   For oil, use 3/4 c. and add 1/2 c applesauce, instead of all white sugar, use 1c. white and 1c. brown sugar, use 3 t. vanilla, 3 t. cinnamon, add 1/4 t. nutmeg and 8 oz can of pineapple.  Fo9r the frsting, I use 3 c. conf. sugar instead of 4, and if making this a layer cake, double the frsoting recipe so that there is lots since that is the way we like it!  Can't go wrong with this recipe.

SUPERB!!!  Only few alterations to the original recipe : Split the sugar to 1 cup brown and 1 cup white and add 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  That's all.  My kids did NOT like the chopped nuts, so I made it again but this time I powdered the walnuts in my little chopper and told them that there were NO NUTS.  All the flavor but no nutty pieces!!!  I made a wonderful decoration but of course did not take a pic...will do next time and post.  Thanks!  Only one more note: for those who find the icing too sweet, no worries, just add 2 TBSP of lemon juice to original recipe and VOILA!  Try it it's amazing.

It is no wonder that this recipe has so many 5 star reviews! It is fantastic! I recommend not changing a thing except reducing the confectioners sugar to 2 cups for the frosting. Thank you so much!

With all the rave reviews this cake has I am sure it doesn't need anymore. I wanted to say it was just delicious! I made it for the Jewish holidays and  my cousin begged to take all the leftover cake home. There wasn't much left but he got his doggie bag!

Best cake ever. So moist.
Great icing but I add 1 tsp. orange juice. This icing is not as sweet as other cream cheese icing.  Delicious.

My family loves carrot cake. I have made this cake 4 times and follow recipe exactly, except leaving out the nuts in the frosting. (I think the cake looks nicer with out, and the cake has plenty) I will try other viewers sugestions next time and add pineapple. Thanks for this recipe Tammy!

Excellent! Made this in a 9 x 13 pyrex pan and it came out perfect! Easy cake to make, only thing I added was about a cup of raisins, which added a bit more sweetness. Highly recommend.

I stopped short of 5 stars because this was my first attempt. I'll try a couple more and likely come back and add another star, cuz this recipe kicked butt! Even the company I had that "didn't like carrot cake" gave it rave reviews. I made this sans the pecans and still loved it. Thanx

I tried to convert this into a little healthier version.  Only used 1 c sugar.  Instead of 2 c all purpose flour, I used 1 1/2 whole wheat and 1/2 all purpose.  I added 1/3 c wheat germ.  I grated a cup of apples and poured apple juice almost to the top level of the apples.  I used walnuts instead of pecans just because that is what is in my pantry.  I only made half as much of the frosting.  I still covered the whole cake adequately. I bet the original is more delicious with all those extras, but it was still good with the changes I madee and I will definitely make it again.

This turned out very moist and even after a few days still tastes fresh. 
Next time I make it I will not add as many nuts, and think I'll omit them completely from the frosting. 
I use splenda instead  of sugar, and also used it in place of the powdered sugar for the frosting but only used 1 1/2 cups then and it was sweet enough, also used fat free cream cheese. I added the crushed pineapple and next time think I'll double that.

I made this exactly the way the directions said to, except I baked it in a bundt pan for presentation. It was so good, my husband asked me to make it again the next weekend. The best carrot cake I've ever had!

This cake is amazing.  I made it because I have a ton of carrots to use up, even though I've never really cared for carrot cake before.  I made a few changes, I used some applesauce in place of some of the oil as other reviewers suggested, and I used 1 c of brown sugar in place of 1 c of regular sugar.  Made the frosting without the nuts, but kept the nuts in the cake.  Eating this fresh after cooling that same day, it was only ok.  But eating it from the fridge the next day?  Insanely heavenly.  I've never had a cake taste so much better the 2nd day.  Even my young daughters loved it, they want me to make it as their birthday cake...over chocolate!!  I can't wait to have an excuse to make this cake again.

I got numerous compliments about this cake.  It turned out very moist.  The only thing I would change next time is the amount of powdered sugar that's added in the frosting.  I will probably only go with 2 cups, 4 was a little much, but other than that it turned out great!!

I love this recipe! However I did add some ingredients to it to make it even more delicious (golden raisins, walnuts instead of pecans, crushed pineapple) and i used 1 cup white sugar & 1 cup brown.  For oil i used 3/4 canola and 1/2 apple sauce.  A family favorite!

This is an excellent recipe. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I used walnuts instead of pecans and I added a 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I used non-stick cake pans and used crisco SPRAY. I did not grease or flour cake pans, just sprayed with crisco spray. I mixed all my dry ingredients together and then added it to the batter. I hand grated my carrots for a finer texture. Making another one today. The cream cheese frosting is Perfect.

I didn't change this recipe too much except for the following: (1) Used half all-purpose and half whole-wheat flour; (2) Used only 1-1/2 cups sugar; (3) Used 3-1/2 cups grated carrots; (4) Used walnuts in place of pecans in the cake but not in the frosting; (5) Added allspice, ground nutmeg and clove as suggested by other reviewers; (6) Frosted with coconut extract-flavored buttercream frosting instead. The cake still turned out to be slightly sweet for me; I guess I'll reduce sugar to 1-1/3 cups next time. Other than that, it was a very moist spiced carrot cake! (If you add more spices as suggested by others.) Definitely a keeper!

This is a wonderful carrot cake recipe!! Changes: Added a dash of allspice and nutmeg, and a few drops of coconut extract. Used 3/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup applesauce. Reduced sugar to 1 1/3 cups. Omitted pecans from batter, made an orange cream cheese frosting and garnished with toasted pecans and coconut.
FROSTING: 1 (8-oz) package cream cheese, half stick of butter (softened), 1 1/4 cups powdered sugar, and 1 tsp. orange extract. (can add orange zest)
YUM! :)

I'm a newbie at cooking and love desserts.  So, I thought, let me try a few of these recipes.  I nailed this recipe the first time (following the recipe to the T).  Everyone that tasted it had the same look of disbelief, that I made something soooo good.  You will blow away your friends and family with this recipe.

Great recipe! However, I have several tricks...In lieu of fresh grated fresh carrots, I use baby food, 3 jars of carrots-Trust me, you'll never grate another carrot and in the cream cheese icing, i add the pith of one orange- it really brightens up the flavor and adds pretty orange specks!

I followed gneebeanie's recommendations and added a pinch of ginger, and the cake came out perfect. Incredibly moist, but still sturdy. And with wonderful flavor and textures (the carrot, nuts, pineapple, etc). I also prefer a less-sweet frosting, so I only use 2 cups of sugar when I make cream cheese frosting. By far the best recipe i've found. My husband's aunt called me after we left his family's Easter celebration just to tell me it was the best carrot cake she'd ever had. My husband was in shock because she's not one to compliment anyone. :)

This was my first attempt at homemade carrot cake, and I was so pleasantly suprised. This cake was so moist and delicious. After reading all the reviews I decided to make some of the suggested changes, however I feel that without them the recipe would still be awesome as the changes don't alter it much. First I decided to replace 1/2c of the oil with applesauce. I used 1c brown & 1c white sugar. Also I added 8oz crushed pineapple. With the frosting I cut the sugar to 2cups. It's a really delicious frosting recipe, but unless you like your frosting really really really sweet, 4cups is just too much. But all in all this is a fantastic recipe and will now be my go-to recipe for carrot cake, thanks!

Judging from the fact that the average rating of this recipe is 5 stars, I must have done something wrong but I don't know what. I followed the recipe exactly but I ended up with great TASTING cake that looks really bad. It's sunken-in in the middle and crusty around the edges. I'm really sad because I spent $20 on groceries to make it. Hope ya'll have better luck.

I made this with a few of the modifications listed.  I added half brown sugar and half white sugar, added a dash of nutmeg and since I was eating an orange at the time, I added some orange zest to the batter.  I did not use the frosting directions since I had some white frosting already in the fridge so I added some orange zest, cream cheese, milk, and powdered sugar to it.  This cake was very dense but so good and the next day after the frosting sat on it, it became much more moist.  I would definitely make this again.

Yum!  My daughter(age 17) was in the mood for carrot cake and decided to try this one.  She did replace half the oil with unsweetend applesauce and used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  She also reduced the amount of sugar in the frosting by 1 cup.  We will definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks!

This recipe is phenominal.  My husband who is a die hard carrot cake lover, said this is the best carrot cake he has ever had.
I also followed some of the substitutions, 1 cup brown, 1 cup white, added 1 8-oz can crushed pineapple, drained, used 3/4 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, an extra teaspoon of vanilla.  I also cut the confectioner's sugar to 3.5 cups.  
This comes out moist and so tasty, and the frosting is amazing.

This cake turned out perfect.  I made the suggestions (half brown suger and white sugar, added nutmeg and a little more vanilla and cinnamon) but I did not add applesauce and it still turned out wonderfully.  I made 2 for a larger birthday that fell close to Easter and tried a 9x13 cake pan and 2 9" round cake pans for a layered cake.  The 9" rounds turned out MUCH better.  The 9x13 seemed flat and the frosting overpowered the cake.  I will definitely continue to make it layered in the future.

So moist, so yummy...oh so good. I've made this quite a few times now. I prepared in 2 8in cake pans. I didn't line with parchment, but I use Bakers Joy spray that has flour in it, and it came out beautifully. I omitted the pecans and opted to chop walnuts and encrusted the side of the iced cake with walnuts instead. On occassion I also add premium raisins (Trader Joes are nice and plump), I didn't want raisins that were too dry to remove the moisture from the cake.

Holy cow! This cake was delicious! I'd never made a carrot cake before but I wanted to surprise my girlfriend with a cake when she returned from a business trip. She LOVES carrot cake. This seemed like a good recipe with a lot of good reviews. Especially helpful was the person who combined all the most-suggested alterations to the recipe. I was nervous when she first tried it but it came out perfect! So good. The only thing I'm going to do differently next time is make more frosting. There was enough, but I think I made the cake in a bigger pan than suggested so it was slightly thin on the icing.
I wanted to bring some cake into work for my coworkers since it was so good, but my girlfriend wouldn't let me! She wanted it all to herself.  It was a 9x13 cake. And she ate it all too in about 5 days. I'm telling you, this cake is f&@%ing good.

The basic cake recipe is pretty good.  I did change up some of the items though:
-Used 1/4 applesauce and cut back 1/4 on the oil.
-Can of crushed pineapple.
-Frosting:  Used 2 pkgs of 8oz Cream Cheese and 3 cups of powdered sugar.  This made the perfect amount for a circular layered cake.  It wasn't too sweet, just perfect.  I also didn't put the pecans in the frosting, I just put the chopped pecans on the sides of the cake and inside the batter.


I  made this for a poker party and it was a hit.

This was an awesome recipe! I added 2 cups of carrots and 1 cup strained crushed pinapple that I dried moderatly with paper towels. I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg, and I used walnuts since the grocery store was out of pecans. It came out wonderfully. I did have to bake it an extra 10 minutes to make sure the middle was cooked all the way through, but it is moist and firm. I also added just a pinch of lemon zest to the icing to give it a little zing. Wonderful cake, my husband loves it!

Just perfect! My idea of heaven on earth...  I served it at a family lunch and even had my male cousin say that it was the best he's ever had and that other carrot cakes are usually "heavy", but this one was moist and fluffy! Going by a few other peoples suggestions, I did cut down on the sugar in the icing and it was still great.

This is an AWESOME carrot cake recipe! It is not dense like the carrot cakes I'm used to eating (which is good).  It is moist and fluffy, especially right out of the oven. I made this for my girlfriend and she absolutely loved it! Like others, I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  I also added an extra tsp of cinnamon and vanilla.  Lastly, I used 1/4 cup apple juice and 1 cup of canola oil instead of the 1.25 cup of veggie oil. Excellent recipe!

Great recipe - i picked it b/c it was one of the few carrot cake recipes w/o canned pineapple (which i didn't have).  only changes i made were 1) substituted half of the oil with apple sauce, 2) used half the amt of sugar in the icing (i like mine a bit less sweet - it was perfect w/ 2 cups), and 3) sprinkled walnuts on top of the cake (instead of mixing them in).  so good - thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

This was a terrific cake. I followed the recipe completely except I used only 1 cup of oil. It came out very moist and tasty. I will definitely make this again. My husband and kids said give this recipe five stars.

Followed all of gneebeanie's modifications and the cake turned out beautifully!  It couldn't have been more moist and I was pleased to find out that the pineapple was not even noticeable.  Used the Cuisinart to shred the carrots and that made the job easier -- no excess juice like some posters have reported.  Will definetly use this recipe again!

Amazing!  This cake was such a hit.  I baked this cake as a birthday present for someone who absolutely loves carrot cake & he ate half of it in 1 sitting.  :)  I made a few suggested changes: used 1/2 c of applesauce instead of all the oil required, added a little more cinnamon & only used 2 1/2 c of confectioners' sugar for the icing.  It was perfect!  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

I am only giving this 4 stars, but only because, I along with everyone did not follow the recipe, By other reviews, I also used 1c white sugar and 1c Brown, I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and An extra teaspoon of vanilla, I did 3/4cup oil, and 1/2 cup applesauce, Originally I used all the oil, And I also had bigger grates of Carrots and my cake Caved in the center, I made it again with the applesauce and made my grated carrots smaller, and it did not cave, who knows though maybe someone ran in the kitchen to much, and thats why it caved. With the changes this cake is 5 stars, Everyone loves it!! I also Used 1 cup less sugar in the frosting.

I made it with all the revisions mentioned in the reviews and although it almost makes it a different cake, it was wonderful! I made it with two 9 inch cake pans, baked it for about 35 minutes and that was a bit too long. Start checking it around 25-30 minutes.

I followed all the advice and made the suggested changes.  I loved the frosting, my husband suggested some shredded carrots on the top and maybe add a cup of raisens and more carrot to the recipe.  I must admit, he ate it almost entirely before he made the suggestions. Thanks!

I added alittle extra carrots and the cake fell. It was still delecious and I will make again, just don't add any extra carrots.

EDIT: today I tried making cupcakes with this recipe. BAD idea. Don't try that again! Based on another review, I filled the cups full and they all rised too much and spilled over. The cupcakes fell and burnt on the edges of the overflowed parts. all in all, stick to making this a cake.

I also used the substitutions, 1/2 c applesauce and 3/4 c canola oil, 1 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white, and next time I will use 4 1/2 c of carrots and possibly more brown sugar and less white, I also added nutmeg, more vanilla and cinnamon, and used walnuts instead of pecans. I tried three variations, no nuts, chopped nuts, and powdered nuts (ground fine for taste without chunks).  Then I made them into cupcakes and frosted them and filled them using the Orange Cream Cheese Frosting recipe (without the nuts and use 1 1/2 tea zest instead of 2 unless you want a more orange zest flavor- it's still delicious, just takes away from the rest) and a pastry bag.  I poked a hole in the centers with a toothpick and "swirled" it inside to make room for the frosting to spread, while they were still warm.  I filled them, then put them in the fridge to cool, then took them out and frosted the tops.  They turned out wonderfully.  I'd have to say my favorite were the powdered nut ones, but I will double the amount next time (2 c. instead of 1).

This recipe is fantastic!  It is easy to make and my husband loves it.  I too followed the advice of reducing the sugar in the frosting recipe by to 3 cups and thought it was perfect.  The frosting is delicious.  I just made it again splitting it into two 9'' rounds to make a layer cake and reduced the bake time to 30 minutes.  I made a double batch of frosting to be sure I had enough for a thick center.  Probably too sweet for most but I'm a frosting lover and more is always better to me!

This cake was fantastic!  I made a few minor modifications based on other reviews.  I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  I also used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of apple sauce.  The end result was the best carrot cake I've ever had.  So moist and delicious!

I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe found on this site for the icing because I like a more "cream cheese" frosting and this one seemed too sweet.  I'd highly recommend trying it - it complemented the cake perfectly!

Absolutely delicious! First time I ever made carrot cake and I love it! I've only ever eaten carrot cake once before but don't remember liking it like I do this one. The frosting is perfect for this cake--I could sit and eat it straight from the mixing bowl with a big ole spoon. Will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was a fantastic recipe!! There were a few small things I altered though. I added an extra half cup of carrot, 1/2 cup of raisins, an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and all applesauce in place of oil. I also used a cinnamon flavored applesauce and the cake was absolutely delicious. The icing was a little sweet and thick so it had to be thinned with some milk as well.

I just made this tonight for the first time, and it was so good that I had to hop right on and review it. Easy recipe, easy to make--although next time I plan on buying shredded carrots, as I am never grating them again!

The cake was done in exactly 40 minutes, and as it cooks it acquires this heavenly slightly crisp outer layer. In my opinion, the icing isn't even needed, and if you exclude it you will cut out a bunch of calories and still have a delectable treat! Everyone loves it, huge success ;)

This was my first time baking a carrot cake, and it turned out great.  Although I'm not a big carrot cake connoisseur, my mother, who has eaten many-a-carrot-cake, said that it tasted gourmet and immediately asked for the recipe.  The procedure was simple, the ingredients basic, the taste sublime.  

Following almost all of gneebeanie's modifications, I was very pleased with the results.  I didn't add pineapple because I wanted a more traditional carrot cake, I didn't add pecans to the cake batter because I don't like crunchy things in my cake, and I didn't have nutmeg, so I added a bit of ground ginger (approx. 1/2 - 1 tsp) instead.  Instead of mixing the pecans in with the icing, I chopped them up and sprinkled/pressed them into the icing around the top of the cake.  It did look very gourmet, if I do say so myself, and it tasted grrrrrrrrrrrrreat!

The cake was absolutely moist and lightly fluffed. I used 3/4cup white sugar and 3/4 cup brown. It was still a little sweet for my liking though. And used 3 large eggs instead of 4, increased the cinnamon by 1 tsp, used 1 cup of canola oil and a cup of walnuts. U definitely have to squeeze the carrots and pineapple then add 2 tbs juice of each or u'll end up with a pudding-like super dense cake. I made 29 cupcakes and baked it for 20 mins at mid level. Make sure to fill the cupcakes slightly less than 3/4 full as it rises quite a bit. Thanks for this wonderful recipe!

First time making carrot cake and it came out great! Glad I checked out the reviews first. Made the following changes: 1c brown/white sugar, 1/2c. applesauce & 3/4c oil, and 2c powdered sugar for frosting. The sweetness for the frosting was good but a bit runny so I will use another 1/2-1c the next time. My husband loves carrot cake and will definitely make it again.

Yummy!  I never really liked carrot cake, but I was having my parents over for their birthday dinner and their favorite cake is carrot cake.  I was nervous about how it might come out after reading all the reviews, where some were disasters.  But, my cake was wonderful.  I used the alternates/additions to the recipe: applesauce & oil, brown & white sugar, more vanilla extract, more cinnamin, nutmeg, pineapple and raisins.  For the frosting, I used this recipe.  The only alteration I made was to add more cream cheese to total 12oz.  I sent some home with my parents and kept some for myself.  I must confess that I ate the rest all by myself!  I've been thinking of a good excuse to make another one soon!!  Thanks for the delicious recipe and thanks to all those who sent helpful reviews!!

I love this recipe and so does everyone I make it for!!  It's definitely become a friends and family favorite.  The only thing I do different is add a cup of golden raisins - but it's good without too!

I was in a hurry when I made this recipe and made it exactly as it said, except that I didn't have enough carrots so filled with raisins.  Then, while I was waiting for it to cool to frost it, I read some reviews and wondered if I should have made changes.  I did change the sugar in the frosting to 3 cups.  It was the most popular thing I've ever made.  People were begging for seconds.  Also, it seemed like it wasn't done after about 45 minutes, but it was dark and pulled away from the pan, so I took it out.  I left it in the pan, frosted it, and took it to work in the pan.  I also just sprayed the pan with Pam, and didn't flour the pan.

This is one of the moistest carrot cakes my husband and I have ever tasted!  I did substitute apple sauce for half of the required oil.    I made it in the 9X13 as suggested but it turned out really flat!  An inch at the thickest.  So I guess I need to double the recipe to make it a decent thickness.  There was a lot of icing, more than needed.  I didn't know this and poured the whole thing on the cake lol - luckily I love cream cheese icing but I think it would be too much for most people.  Will definitely make again but will double cake recipe and only use 3 or 3 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar.

LOVED IT!  I also went a little overboard with my shredded carrots- I had 4 cups, but it was amazing!  Everyone loved "my" carrot cake and wanted more!  I also cut the sugar down to 3 cups in the frosting, and I really think that it could have even been cut down to 2 cups, maybe 2 and a half.  Thank you for the suggestions about using 3/4c apple sauce and 1/2c oil. Thank you for sharing such a YUMMY recipe.

I received so many compliments on this cake! Very moist!!!I didn't use the cream cheese frosting because my son is allergic to dairy, so I made a cinnamon buttercream frosting with vanilla soymilk. The cake was so great, nobody noticed!

This carrot cake was light, moist, and delicious! I actually used the batter to make cupcakes for my friend's birthday. I left out the nuts and added 1/2 cup raisins. I will definitely make these again!

Awesome, this was sooo good, perfect, I sprinkled mine with some powdered sugar and it was fantastic, I preferred this over the chocolate cake I made the same day. It was worth the grating carrots experience.

Excellent Carrot Cake! I add about a teaspoon of Nutmeg and Ginger to it, and bake in a 9in Springform Pan. If you want to bake it that way, I usually have to increase my bake time to 80-90 mins @ 350°F. Icing is a little easier if you sprinkle the pecans on top of the cake after you ice it, rather than mix in. Great tasting cake!

After reading all of the reviews, I expected to enjoy the best carrot cake I've ever had. I found this cake to be pretty bland, and a little on the heavy side. I would have liked a richer, more textured and spicier flavor. At the end of the day, this wasn't much better than box mix, which takes a lot less work! I was disappointed.

A moist carrot cake at it's finest.  Everyone loves my baking, so I bake upon request for those up to the challenge that they can answer a tid bit of movie trivia. I bet my friend he didn't know the name of, what was later discovered to be, the inferno room from the movie beetlejuice.  He didn't know, but I felt bad beating him again at knowing comedy classic details, so I baked this anyway.  I highly recommend this one!!!

I made this recipe for a family Christmas party and it was the BEST carrot cake I have ever had. I did what others did and substituted applesauce instead of using the full amount of oil. The cake turned out moist and delicious with the frosting the perfect consistency and tasty. I will definitely be making this again for dessert, but instead I'll be keeping more for myself than sharing. :)

This was yummy!  I was a little turned off by the nuts in the frosting but it was a nice extra.  I would cut the frosting in half next time, it was too much.  The cake was nice and moist.  I would make it again and again and again.

I followed some of the other reviews and used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of cinnamon applesauce. I had chopped walnuts on hand so I used them instaed of pecans. The outcome....fantastic!! It was not too moist or dry as other reviewers stated. Thanks for sharing.

Very good! I don't bake - not my thing, but figured I would give it a try for Thanksgiving. I followed others tip and only used 3 cups of conf. sugar for frosting. Prob could of even used a little less, I prefer my frosting to have more of a cream chesse flavor. Added 1 cup of raisins instead of nuts. Everybody loved it!

This is the best carrot cake ever! I think the secret to it's moistness is the oil. I've made this cake several times, and always get compliments.I usually don't frost the cake, and we have ice cream with it!

We liked this so much that I didn't frost it the first time I made it! I didn't have quite enough carrots, so I added a cup of crushed pineapple. I also substituted walnuts for the pecans. It was delightfully moist and flavorful. I added a large pinch of nutmeg and a small pinch of allspice to the listed cinnamon. I rarely give top rating to recipes (as how can you show what you consider 'best' if you give them all top ratings?) This one deserves it, IMO.

I have to agree with another reviewer in that 2 cups of sugar is a better option.  As much as I *love* the frosting part of any cake, it was still too much.  My cake too sunk in the middle and although the toothpick came out clean, it was still too oily in the middle.  I did bake it on the convection setting for 35 minutes in the 9x13 pan.  **Updated 23MAR08: I just had to try this again with the "most helpful" poster.  What a difference!  It was cooked perfectly, again on convection bake at 325 degrees for 35 minutes.  I think the big difference was using 1/2 c applesauce and 3/4 c oil.  I'm glad I tried it again so I could up that star rating to a 5.

WOW, this was so good!! I made this for Easter dinner and everyone loved it. So moist. I replaced the recommended amount of oil with 1/2 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of applesauce, and substituted 1 cup of the white sugar for brown sugar. I also added 1 more tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1 cup of raisins. I did make a 2 layer 9 inch round cake so set the temp to 325 for about 38 mins like others suggested.

This is the perfect basic carrot cake if you don't like all the "extras" in your carrot cake i.e., raisins, pineapple, etc. I divided the batter in half and did 1/2 with nuts and 1/2 without. They were both great! The frosting really makes this cake.

So moist and light!!! A wonderfully simple carrot cake that was finished off way too soon. The only thing was i wasn't over impressed by the cream cheese frosting. Other that a fantastic carrot cake that will be made in my home for years to come.

I am a completely new baker/cook (a student too), and this came out *fantastic*. 
The only difference I did is lessen the icing to 1/4 cup butter, and 1 cup sugar, and didn't add pecans to the icing, as I felt the creaminess is enough (and enough pecans would be in the cake).

The cake was half eaten right away by roomates, and the next morning, with the icing chilled it was even better! 

One more thing I saw being done and wish I could do, is add raw pumpking seeds on top of the icing. I couldn't find any, but it tastes excellent.

Made this for my daughter's 12th birthday Party and believe me there were picking eaters amongst the party guests and after the cake was served I only got one piece. Each girl had two pieces and wanted more!! So yes this one is another winner and gets ten stars as far as I'm concerned!! Very moist and delicious!!! The frosting is fantastic as well!!

We've made this about 10 times now and it always gets compliments and requests for the recipe. We've made the frosting and tinted and used it to decorate. Works great in a decorating bag, too. I've used a finely chopped apple as a substitute for some of the oil and added more cinnamon, and about 1/4 tsp each nutmeg, allspice, and clove. Tastes better if you make the night before and then refrigerate. We used a 9 x 13 pyrex pan and it overflowed so now use 2 9" rounds or 3 8" squares.

This recipe makes an excellent carrot cake.  I was extremely pleased with the results.  I did, however, make a few changes.  I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups,used only 1 cup of oil, added 1 cup finely chopped apple, increased salt to 1 tsp and increased the cinnamon to 2 tbsp for kick.  I then baked it in 2 9 inch cake pans.  I didnt use the icing called for in the recipe, I used mine--2 8 oz pkgs cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 1 tsp vanilla and 3 cups icing sugar.  I then split the layers and filled and frosted them.  I was truly impressed and so were my guests who raved about it. I also found this cake is best made a day ahead and left in the refrigerator, as with most desserts--Its makes a difference in how the cake will taste.  Thanks for a keeper, Tammy.

Delicious! 
Frosting tip: I used 3 cups powdered sugar and 1/4 tsp more vanilla for the frosting instead of 4 cups powdered sugar. It was still yummy. Next time, I might even use less sugar and feel that 4 cups would be way too sweet.

Oh my mother of God!! Awesome recipe, no wonder it's number one.  My husband made this recipe for a coworker of mine's birthday and the entire office loved it, infact birthday boy ate two pieces.  This was my husband's first time baking carrot cake and has not even had a chance to try his own creation, I assured him it's great.  By the way, 3 people in my office are willing to pay my husband to make this cake for them.  Also, did not alter the cake recipe at all, but the cream cheese frosting he made with 3 cups confectioners sugar instead of 4.  Awesome!!!!

I tried it on the statement made by Tammy that she had "tried many carrot cakes, and this is my favorite recipe." I wanted to skip the "tried many" part and just have a favorite, and this recipe was delicious! A great way to use up extra carrots before they go bad.

My friend said this was so nice she didn't want to eat it! I substituted half the oil for applesauce, and used mixed spice instead of just cinamon, and it came out lovely. The icing however was the best icing I've ever tried. There was too much of it, but I just ate the leftover with a spoon.

Very good. My husband LOVED it. I think I'd prefer more carrots, but that's personal preference. I used 1/4 less oil and added a mashed banana (the hubby likes them). The flavors blend well, without the banana being too strong.

After making this cake just once, I have been asked to make it again for every party or event I go to.  It IS that good!  I didn't use a 9x13 pan, instead I used 2 round 8 inch pans.  I will be making this again very soon and the only difference I may make is with the frosting.  The first time I just added the ingredients.  This time I may add the sugar a little at a time to taste.  Also, I am one of those people who like a smooth carrot cake.  If you prefer a smooth texture, grate the carrots by hand.  This will give it a consistancy just above puree.

My family and co-workers loved this cake, as did I. I made the cake twice and personally I preferred the cake with only 1 cup of vegetable oli, instead of the 1.25 cups in the recipe. I also added raisins and walnuts (instead of peacans) and it turned out great. This is a great recipe, easy to make and tastes fantastic! Thank you.

I too had never made a carrot cake until I tried this.  It is the best carrot cake I have ever had. My family flipped over it. Definitely advise on cutting the oil to 1/2 cup and using 3/4 cup of applesauce.  I also cut the powdered sugar in half and it was fine.

I had made this for a Singles potluck and got nothing but praises. A few of the 
expressed how with cooking like this I wouldn't be single for long. Others fought
over the last piece. Thanks, my two boys couldn't  get enough.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I have probably made this cake 20+ times (without changing anything) and it is always a hit. I have adults and kids always asking me to make it for birthdays or other occasions. Sometimes I leave out the pecans in the frosting, depends on who the cake is for...it is delicious either way. I have also made it a couple times for my niece, who is allergic to eggs...when making it for her, I use flaxseed instead (1 tablespoon flaxseed and 3 tablespoons of water for each egg replaced). It turns out great with the flax as well!

After reading all the reviews and confusion "change this, add that, omit this, etc. " I decided it looked good on its own and I made it as written. This cake was wonderful as written. The only thing I left out was the nuts, otherwise, no changes. The cake is moist and delicious. Probably the best carrot cake we have had. Anywhere. I was a bit skeptical of the baking soda amount and the reviews stating their cake tasted like baking soda?! But there must be some mistake. There was no baking soda taste, just moist, flavorful carrot cake taste! I also had no collapsing of the middle as some described. You don't need pineapple to "balance" the baking soda, that is silly. There are many cakes made without an acid. I made this cake specifically because it had no pineapple in it. Why add it? It doesn't need it. I could go on after reading pages of reviews that changed this unnecessarily. Don't change a thing! Now for the frosting - wonderful. I would start with 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and taste it. If you want it sweeter add the last 1/2 cup. This will be my go to cream cheese frosting from now on.

This is by far the best carrot cake I've ever had or made. The batter rose about 2.5 times and the cake was moist and delicious. I didn't think it needed any modifications - it was good as it is. Some things are good because they are not overcomplicated with 50 different ingredients.  The frosting was creamy and tasted good. I followed advice from several comments and only used 3 cups of powdered sugar as i personally do not like it too sweet and it was plenty sweet and thick enough to hold it's "fluff".  I didn't have any pecans so I made it without them since the recipe said it was OK either way and it was still amazing. I'll definitely save this as my go to carrot cake recipe.

I suck at making cakes and this came out brilliantly. Followed reviewers recommendation of 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar, +1 tsp of vanilla extract, + 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and +1 tsp of cinnamon. My fiance complained that he couldn't taste the nutmeg, but as it's not even in the recipe, I have no complaints about it. Used 2 cups of walnuts as opposed to pecans. Split the batter between two 9 inch cake pans and baked at 350 for 35 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe and the great reviewer recommendations.

My family and friends loved this recipe so I'll definitely make this again. Followed one reviewer's consolidated suggestion of using 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar, additional pineapple, 1 tsp cinnamon and vanilla.  Also using only 3 cups of confectioner's sugar.

Wow.  I made this for a group of friends and it was DEVOURED.  I followed the suggestions in the "Most helpful positive review" as well as exchanging raisins for the pecans (just my preference) and it was the perfect carrot cake.  I would have taken a picture, but it didn't last long enough!

Perfection. For me, carrot cake is best with no yucky raisins or nuts or pineapple. I had to add a 1/2 tsp of allspice because I like it. And I used cake flour. Otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Love, love, love this. And, it is yummier the next day. All the spices seem to have time to develop flavor.

I have been using this recipe since 1964.  only we had a black walnut tree so we used black walnuts instead of the pecans.  gives it an unusually extra punch.

This is the one! I made this twice and each time it was the most delicious carrot cake. Making for Easter this year, can't wait!!! I used two 10 inch cake pans to make a layer cake which looks very impressive! I also followed advice from gbeanie:  1) using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract **3) I did not use pineapple**4) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 5) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 6) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.

I made this carrot cake as directed on the recipe and found that 1.25 cups of oil is WAAAAAAY too much.  I would say that 0.25 to 0.50 cups of oil would be plenty. But, it sure made the baking dish easy to clean!

With this recipe and made 2 delicious cakes  that came out better than i could have hoped! Instead of layering them, i made 2 separate cakes and there was more than enough frosting for both! This was the first carrot cake I've ever made, so i was very proud. Some changes i made to the recipe:

- i juiced carrots in the juicer and used the carrot pulp for the cake, much easier than grating carrots,and tastes just as good! 

- i added 1/2 cup of apple sauce

- i used 1/2 cup less sugar for cake 

The result was a moist, addicting cake that everyone loved!! I will be using this recipe again for sure.

I do not understand why anyone would modify this recipe.  It's wonderful just as it is.  And easy prep with simple ingredients.  Perhaps I am just a non-competitive person.  Or I don't feel threatened by the success of others.  Just make this cake as instructed and enjoy it!  It's fantastic!

I have made this recipe for years. Only giving 4 stars since my recipe calls for 1/1-2 cups of oil and 3/1-2 cups of grated carrots. This slight difference makes a big difference in how moist the cake is. Also I use chopped walnuts instead of pecans.

Taste wise this cake is lovely, however I found the sponge to be quite dense, I personally prefer a light, fluffy sponge. I'm not sure if I done something wrong during baking or whether everybody's cakes turned out like this! Definitely still worth making though as it's a very nice cake.

I made the cake according to the recipe and was pleasantly surprised how fluffy and light it was because I accidentally grounded rather than grated my carrots. (My all-in-one has circular openings that look like a grater, but actually grounds) Oh well. It's my first time making carrot cake at home, so I'm used to the dense, moist, almost-wet carrot cake you buy from the store. The recipe was simple & my friends loved it! I threw in a handful of raisins instead of the pecans. I didn't have time today, but next time, I'll soak them in rum first, add a little ginger, & . I haven't tasted the frosting yet though...

I just made this recipe and used cake flour instead of all purpose. I had one small issue in it overflowing and taking a bit longer than the recommended time to bake (it was still pretty raw by minute 30). I love carrot cake and I thought I would try it out. It is good, aside from a small bit of one note flavors (all I taste is egg and cinnamon). My recommendation is to use a really steep baking dish but other than that it came out pretty well. Looking forward to frosting it. Good recipe

have made this now about 4 times, and is one of my favorites, didn't alter a thing except added a little whipping cream on top for decoration purposes only.Very easy to make, was worried that it was too watery and would never set, but patience is a virtue.

Delicious!!! My husband loves carrot cake and asked me to make it for a dinner party. Between three adults they ate practically the entire cake. I made the cake exactly as written except I omitted the nuts due to little children who would be eating the cake. Making it again this weekend with the nuts.

Ah-MAY-zing!   This is the first cake I have successfully made from scratch!  I, like many people, read lots of reviews, and I did make a few tiny adjustments (more vanilla, more cinnamon, a hint of nutmeg, and half brown sugar), but I made no major changes to the recipe.  I even used the amount of oil called for....and it was perfect. Moist, spicy, flavorful, and the frosting was fabulous!  I used the exact amounts called for and whipped the fool out of it in the stand mixer. I have avoided cake making for a long time, because I had never been able to make a good one from scratch....that is, until today.  Thank you so much for the recipe and the confidence.  :-)

The only issue I've been having so far, is the cake is sticking to my pan. I really wanted to use a mini bundt cake pan to make individual carrot cakes and the cake crumbled. I also added raising and and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Going to make a 3rd attempt again.

I chose this recipe because it was as close to the one that I have been making for over 30 year. I lost all my recipes in when I moved from Georgia to Florida:-) I did make a few adjustment mainly to make it healthier! Lol 
I used whole wheat flour, used coconut oil and replaced a 1 tbs of the oil with 3 tbs of ground flax seeds. It didn't change the taste at all and almost all of the cake was eat at the dinner party I took it to.
Next Time I make it I think I'm going to reduce the sugar to 1 1/2 cups because it is so sweet. The cream chease icing I've been making it for so long. If you let your butter and cream cheese soften or microwave for about a minute it is much easer to mix. I sift and beat the whole box of C. Sugar into the mixture then add vanilla last. I also sift the flour in the cake mixture after I measure it first. This is an awesome cake as is:-) my family demolished it in one night!

Great carrot cake!  Did not use nuts due to allergies. Used 1/2 white and brown sugar, substituted applesauce for 1/2 cup of oil, added extra 1 tsp of vanilla and cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and 8oz of crushed pineapple (drained).  Delicious!

I've made this recipe several times because once someone tries it, they want me to make it again. No substitutions are needed. I have tried it with 1 c white and 1 cup brown sugar and it's great that way too.  Adding fresh grated nutmeg gives it another great flavor boost.  I've packed in extra carrots and extra pecans and last time I ran out of vegetable oil and used about 1/3 c canola to supplement. Still great!  It is a lot of oil, but not too much and the oil crisps up the edges of the cake.  The only thing I do differently is the frosting.  It falls in the center when you move it before it's done!  Let it cook! If it does fall, give the center to the frosting lovers. I don't like cream cheese frosting at all, so I use the recipe with a package of vanilla pudding whisked into 1 cup of milk, with an 8 oz tub of cool whip and a tsp 1 tsp of vanilla mixed in at the end.  That's my preference though and in no reflects the yumminess of the cake!

It's one of the best cakes I've ever made. I followed some reviews and doubled the spices and added raisins. And I put only 2 cups of sugar in the icing. My husband absolutely loved it!

It tastes like an overly sweet cinnamon bread.  Not enough cinnamon at that.  All the substitutions are necessary to make this cake even slightly enjoyable.

I've tried this recipe at least four times. Although it has turned out yummy and moist each time, I've still had to deal with the sinking in the center. This past week, when I made it for my birthday, I made a few changes that have resulted in an equally yummy cake without the sinking center. I replaced the 1-1/4 cups canola oil with 1 cup of grape seed oil (more healthy) and 1/2 cup of apple sauce. I also added 1/2 cup of finely chopped fresh pineapple. In terms of the grated carrot, I used a cheese grater on the largest setting. After grating the carrots, I then mince them further with a large knife. This really minimized the wetness of the grated carrots. The overall texture of the cake was a lot lighter than before. I'm very happy with the outcome.

This cake is truly the best carrot cake ever! I didn't have pecans and substituted nuts turned out just as good. I did also use a little less powder sugar cause I thought it would be to sweet for me and that too was just fine. Thank you Tammy!!!

I was seduced by all the glowing reviews.  I followed directions exactly without any modifications.  My cake pans were oiled and floured, but still very difficult to remove from pan and the layers are very thin.  Been baking for many years, but can't figure out what I did to get such disappointing results.

Full of flavour. Loved this recipes. I only changed a few things. Did not have any vanilla so omitted that. Used 1 c of brown sugar and 1 cup of splenda, used 3/4 c of canola oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. Added extra cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Also 1 8 oz can of crushed pineapple made a huge difference.

I made this for my grandmother's birthday. It was a huge hit! I didn't alter anything except I added walnuts instead of pecans and added raisins. The frosting had to be locked down to keep my kids out of it!!! Never had a carrot cake this delicious. Thank you for sharing your recipe!!!

Without modifications this recipe is too sweet and oily for my taste. I replaced half a cup of oil with unsweetened applesauce, decreased the sugar in the batter to 1c brown + 1/2c white, and decreased the sugar in the frosting to 2 1/2c. I also added 8oz crushed pineapple. I made cupcakes, which took 22 min to bake. They were plenty sweet and tasted amazing!

I made this carrot cake for my husband's birthday a few days ago. My first cake from scratch. Everyone at the party loved it and I have to say so did I! I made two 9'' rounds. The only change I would make next time is double the frosting. It got pretty thin as I was icing the outside. I like this recipe as is...they only things I did differently were: I squeezed excess water out of grated carrots in cheese cloth to prevent too much moisture in cake. I did 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. I subbed raisins for the nuts in the cake and re-hydrated them in some warm water before adding. The frosting was sweet enough for me after 3 1/2 cups of sugar. Delicious and will definitely make again! Crowd pleaser!!

Made this recipe exactly as it's written and it came out quite amazing.
Make one day ahead of time if you can!

The only change I made was i cut back on the sugar in the icing by half a cup. (We dont like things to be too sweet) and it came out delicious.

My family loves this carrot cake recipe.  I generally follow the recipe, as written.  The only changes I have made (and I've made it many times) are to add raisins when I don't quite have 3 cups of carrots and to double the icing so I can decorate the cake a bit with it.  (oh and sometimes I will do half brown sugar and half white) This recipe always turns out moist and delicious.  You can certainly tweak it for personal taste, but the recipe is great as written and is my go-to carrot cake recipe.

Fantastic! I substituted unsweetened apple sauce and gluten free flour (Cloud 9) and this cake turned out beautifully. Super moist, delicious and gluten free.

This was delicious and oh so moist.  Used 1cup white sugar and 1cup brown sugar and used 1/2 cup of applesauce and 3/4 cup oil.  Also, for the icing I did only use 3 cups of confectioners sugar.  Will be making this recipe again soon.

I made this for my mom's birthday and she loved it and wants me to give her the recipe. I used the modifications suggested in the top rated comments. I also squeezed the juice out of the carrots once they were shredded to avoid excess moisture.

Excellent! I halved the recipe and baked in a 9" round pan for 35 mins. I omitted the pecans only because I didn't have any.

I attempted to follow this recipe exactly so I could give an accurate review.  I omitted nuts from cake since some people couldn't eat them, so just sprinkled a few chopped walnuts on frosting.  For frosting, only used 2 cups confectioners sugar since that's all I had, and worked out well.  The cake was delicious!!  People raved about it, had seconds, and some even asked to take a piece home.  First time I made a carrot cake from scratch, so will definitely use this recipe again.  Thank you!

Very good cake as written.  My 17 year old daughter made this cake for Easter and I was going to have her make the cake with some of the changes that the reviewers had suggested but by the time I remembered she had already made the recipe as written.  I did have her throw in some golden raisins though.  This was terrific!  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved the cake. I used applesauce in lieu of oil. I added currants and nutmeg. I didn't like the frosting. Way too sweet.
Next time I will use half of the recommended sugar. 4 cups of confectioners sugar was way too Sweet!!

This is possibly the best carrot cake recipe I have found to date. Moist and delicious, and the icing is great too. I tried Sam's carrot cake recipe and it was good but this had more "wow!"  to it despite fewer ingredients.  I did a few changes recommended by others: 3/4 c oil and 1/2 c applesauce, 1 cup each white and brown sugar, and 1 extra tsp cinnamon and a dash of cloves, nutmeg and cardamom ( which I love in anything with cinnamon in it also). I also had to use 1 c wholewheat flour because I ran out of all purpose, and it had great texture. I will use this as my go-to recipe from now on!

I baked the cake as it was written. I liked it well enough, but it was almost too moist. It ended up kind of mushy textured for lack of a better way to describe it. It also didn't seem to have much carrot flavor, but it was a good spice cake. The frosting was also ok, not great but ok. As written it was a very thin/runny frosting and didn't really work for what I wanted. Worth trying if you like super moist spice cake with a hint of carrot. -1 star for not really being much of a carrot cake, and -1 star for it being a little too moist and the runny frosting.

I'm not a fan of carrot cake because it was the only cake my mom made when I was a kid. But my boyfriend loves them and I made these into cupcakes for his birthday. They were a big hit with the family and even I liked them.

This recipe is wonderful. Went through the reviews and the general consensus was to reduce the oil, substitute some of the white sugar for brown and extra the cinnamon and vanilla. I also added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg. So, I reduced the oil by 1/4 cup, did 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, added one extra tsp of cinnamon and vanilla, substituted walnuts for the pecans and it turned out great! Also for the icing I reduced the confectioners sugar to 3 cups instead of 4. The results were outstanding. I wasn't sure about the 3 cups of carrots, so I just added one pound. Next time I may just try 2 cups of confectioners sugar for icing. Happy baking!

I gave this five stars even tho I changed it a bit. I used 50/50 apple sauce grape seed oil and 50/50 white & brown sugar. I'm sure it would have been five stars as written because it was delicious. Dangerously so. I skipped the frosting b/c I didn't have cream cheese, just mixed some flour, sugar in the raw, cinnamon and melted butter and dabbed it on the top. Then I sprinkled the tiny remains from the walnut (didn't have pecans) chopping on that. Added a little more cinnamon and I added nutmeg.

I made this last night, in a bundt pan. A few changes, that made it better for our family, I added 1/2 cup grated fresh ginger, 1 cup of raisins, 1 t. Cardammon, 1/2 t. Allspice. Used one cup sugar, 1/2 cup brown sugar splenda, juice of one blood orange. less oil, for frosting I used 1 1/2 cup powered sugar, 1 stick of butter, 1 pack cream cheese. 

I wanted a more spice cake with carrots...this worked great for me.

This is the best carrot cake I have ever done.  I was going to have the same problem of it not baking well when I baked it in one 9 inch round. So I covered it with a round baking sheet after about 30 mins while it continued to bake in the oven not to burn the top.

I love this recipe, but I did not follow the recipe as written, because I do not use vegetable oil. I substituted 1 cup butter, and added 1/4-1/2 cup applesauce and decreased the sugar in the cake by 1/2 cup. I also added a sprinkling of allspice. It was fantastic! for the frosting, 4 cups of sugar waaaaay too much, so I decreased it by  half and doubled the other ingredients. It was perfect!

*Update* Many experience carrots turning green in carrot cake. I have experienced this as well, and as disconcerting as it was, I read many "options" to avoid this, but happily stumbled on the solution quite by accident...pineapple! I was missing applesauce one day, and in a pinch I pureed some pineapple in juice, added that, and for a while couldn't figure out why the carrots no longer turned green, until I realized that that was the only thing I changed and was the solution!

It's fabulous! To make it moist and heavenly as I've been told I added 5-6 cups of carrots instead of 3 (makes it super moist), an extra tsp of cinnamon, and extra tsp of vanilla and a pinch of nutmeg. Carrot cake connoisseurs think that this IS by far the BEST carrot cake they ever had. Bon appetite!

I love carrot cake, but I'm allergic to nuts and seldom find one without, also I am just starting to bake from scratch and have been very nervous about it.  This recipe was THE BEST EVER carrot cake I have ever tasted (not just saying that because it's mine-lol).  I read other reviews on this recipe and although there are some great suggestions, I followed this one just as is (minus the nuts of course)...and OhEmmGee just DELICIOUS.  I will surely make it again :-) Thank you much

I love this recipe! I have made this many many times. My husband begs me to make it. I change a couple of things just really because I can. I use one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white. I add nutmeg, and more vanilla and a bit more cinnamon. 
The icing is amazing with crushed pecans inside!!

I just made this carrot cake yesterday and both my boyfriend and I loved it and he's not one to like cakes. I followed the cake recipe exactly and it turned out so good. I did not follow the frosting recipe though as I used the frosting from Martha Stewart as I thought 4 cups of sugar was too much and I do have to say I think I was right, 1 cup of sugar seems to be enough for me.

I made this recipe, AS IS, other than I dividing it into two 9" round layers. I also doubled the frosting recipe but didnt end up needing it all. I just figured with the extra layer it might be called for.  The cake was moist and delicious.  Definitely a hit at Thanksgiving. I would definitely make this again!

I can't figure it out. To be fair this is my first carrot cake. I don't like the thought of carrots in my cake because I have a child's mentality when it comes to food. I cooked it twice...both times it was ugly as home made sin. I tried cupcakes instead of a cake. I would have thought it would be the same but My cupcake tops were not fluffed up, they puddled out. Then I threw all the batter in a loaf pan and figured it would be a shallow loaf...the middle was icky. My husband liked the flavor of the cake so he gets to gorge himself on unfrosted carrot puddle-cake since I didn't want anyone to see my shamefully ugly baked goods. 

I hate to do it but I am going to get a boxed mix carrot cake to bake so I can maybe have an idea of what it is supposed to be like. If the cake mix does a simular thing then I will know that carrot cake is supposed to be flat and ugly I guess.

Wow,we love this cake! This is the very first time ever i made a carrot cake like this and not from the Box. It  came out very good and moist, crispy on the outside and nice looking texture. And the icing....all i can say is: To die for...Love it, love it, love it!!!The butter in the icing gives it a good taste, almost like whipped butter cream . Happy Thanksgiving (2013) everyone. Enjoy!!

Great carrot cake! The frosting was a bit too sweet - so on the second try I made it with only one cup of confectioner's sugar and it was perfect. Many thanks for this delicious recipe!

I made this for a birthday in my office. Everyone gave it rave reviews, and one guy even said I have a future in cake baking! I was kind of worried about it because it sank in a bit after I pulled it out of the oven, but it wasn't anything a little icing couldn't cover.
I had also tried to make cupcakes with this recipe, but they also sank in, which is much harder to fix than cake. I don't think I'll be trying that again. But the cake was great!

A crowd-finger-licking-begging-for-more-pleaser!!  I substitute natural applesauce for oil (healthier) and one cup of brown and one cup of white sugar.  I also use walnuts instead of pecans (can't find them here) and a pinch of nutmeg and sometimes allspice. Sometimes I don't even make the frosting--people don't care, they love it however I make it!

Okay, I made this cake twice, I rated it on the actual recipe.  Here is what I think of the actual recipe: The cake is bland, there is WAY too much icing!!  Even my kids couldnt take it!  I read other reviews and tried it with these changes: I added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 extra tsp cinnamon, 1 extra tsp vanilla, 3/4cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  The cake was moist and perfect!  Then for the frosting, I just made half the recipe, it was perfect!  That is a 5 star cake!

I loved the cake but make a few modifications as follows: 1/4 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup oil (canola and coconut mixed). I left out the raisins, I used 2 packed cups of finely grated carrots (3 large carrots). Decreased sugar to 3/4 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. Increased spices to 1 tablespoon vanilla, Didn't have nutmeg so used 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice instead. I cooked it in a bundt pan in my toaster oven at 325 for 50 minutes. 

Cake was lovely but think that I will increase the amount of pumpkin pie spice (or just use nutmeg) next time and add in the raisins.

For the icing: 
I thought 4 cups sugar was too much so I only added 1 cup and thought it was sweet enough. I did think it was rather buttery and will decrease the butter to 1/4 cup next time.

This recipe gets an A from me. I love baking and this was my very first carrot cake from scratch. It was moist, sweet and very easy to make. I made it exactly as written. However, I didn't have any pecans on hand so I used walnuts. I also used the frosting recipe without the nuts and it turned out good. I used 2 9' round pans and baked for 35 mins. With that being said, goodbye box cake! This is now my go to carrot cake.

I took this to a potluck, and everyone loved it. I read a few of the many reviews and added my own touch. I used 1 cup of brown sugar in place of the white. I added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I used the 8 oz package of matchstick carrots, which was a real time saver. I put them in a bowl and microwaved them for a few minutes, so they were still a little crisp. For the frosting, i used the cream cheeese/greek yogurt combo as it has less fat. The result was a good, but not overly sweet frosting. I will make this cake again!

This carrot cake lacked a lot of depth. This meaning that there wasnt enough spices such as cloves, nutmeg, and allspice. As many reviewers mention the usage of two leavening agents was confusing especially if there isn't a reactor. I realized just because a recipe has many reviews does not make it 5 star rating. Please for those of you who change up the recipe DO YOUR POST please! There are many other recipes that I've used in the past that doesnt have a high rating but it was good.

Even people who claim not to like carrot cake ate this cake with pleasure and clamored for more. I substituted nutmeg, ground cloves, and ginger for the cinnamon, due to a food allergy. Luscious!

I've been a carrot cake lover since I had one as a boy from Greenwich Village in New York. My 12 -year-old asked me to make one for his birthday last week, so I chose this recipe after reviewing several here. The result?: OUTRAGEOUSLY DELICIOUS!!!!!! My baking cap is off to the creator.

I made cupcakes rather than a cake, and the original recipe yielded about thirty cupcakes. I included some changes I had seen in the reviews, including an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, a tiny bit of nutmeg, a 1/2 cup applesauce with 3/4 cup oil, one cup brown sugar and one cup white, and an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I used walnuts instead of pecans and baked the cupcakes for 22 to 25 minutes. The results were truly spectacular. I took them to work and my colleagues raved that these were my best cupcakes yet! Thank you!

So glad to find this recipe on All Recipes!  I've been making this cake for years from a recipe I clipped from the Washington Post about 20 years ago.

This is an old and excellent recipe. For anyone that didn't like it may I suggest that you bake just a bit longer and allow it to cool in the oven to prevent the middle sinking. I used to  make and serve this in my own cafe and customers told me it was the best ever carrot cake. Many needed their fix of it every other day. It is easy to make and has a lovely flavour. I used walnuts as I find they have more flavour than pecans. Also I would line the pan with parchment paper allowing me to lift the cake easily for even cutting and icing.

Holy cow! This recipe is incredible. I've never made carrot cake before & I'm so glad I chose this recipe as my first. And the icing is just the "icing on the cake"! So yummy! Thank you so much for sharing!!

I really liked this recipe- I did make some substitutions (3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of the cup and a half of oil) and i added extra cinammon and nutmeg. I made this as a bundt cake and it turned out moist. the flavor was rich and classic. The icing was absolutely delicious and we had more than enough. definitely worth trying and will definitely be made again!

I've tried several carrot cake recipes over the years and this one is a def keeper! Everyone one at work, particularly non-carrot cake eaters, raved about how moist it was and delicious it was. If you stick to the recipe as written, you will not be disappointed!

Read some of the other reviews, and made it with half a cup of brown sugar and half a cup of white. Also cut the amount of powdered sugar in the frosting to about a cup and a half. Cake turned out delicious but not nearly as moist as I was hoping/expecting. Not sure if I cooked it too long or maybe I needed to add more carrot. Will definitely be making this again so I will have to experiment. Thanks, Tammy!

I've been using this recipe for years and the cake is delicious!  It's very very moist and flavourful.   The only change is to use 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar in the cake and less than 4 cups of icing sugar in the frosting...start with 1.5-2 cups and try it, add a little more if needed but 4 cups is definitely way too sweet.

I followed this recipe to the 'T', but the batter seemed too oily and was too runny. The cake did not rise and it sloped in the middle. I was very disappointed because I was making it for a dinner party. I had no time to bake another recipe, so I ended up serving fruit. I have made carrot cakes in the past, but never did I have such miserable results than I had with this recipe. I will not use it again for sure.

Great recipe - I love carrot cakes like this (basic, carroty, and balanced). Too much soda and powder for my taste though.. I reduced it by half a tsp.

AMAZING!!!  Its dense and moist and absolutely perfect.  Not to mention easy to make.

The ONLY thing I changed, due to personal taste, is that I added 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla(to both cake and 1/2 tsp to frosting) and instead of 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, I did 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon nutmeg.

WOW.  Everyone loved this at my house and I've been asked to make more for New Year's.

Seriously the best carrot cake recipe out there.  Everyone raved about it and asks me to make often.  I'm a novice cook, but the cake imploded a little...but the taste was great!

This was the best carrot cake I have ever had. Period. I followed all of Gneebeanie's advise, I think the brown sugar added a nice darkness, although I did use all vegetable oil. I also wanted to throw in some coconut, so I left a tiny bit of carrot out so I didn't over load it, if that's even possible. It was moist and delicious and full of texture, which is what I LOVE about carrot cake. I could spend a lot of time browsing the internet for a carrot cake that calls for everything I want in it (pecans, crushed pineapple & coconut), but I just found that this recipe makes a wonderful base carrot cake recipe, with which you really can make it exactly to your own tastes. Just the best.

This is a very moist carrot cake. I omitted the pecans only because my husband doesn't like them. Otherwise I made it just as written. We liked the frosting too. It was plenty for a 9 x 13 pan cake. I will make this one again.

THIS IS THE BEST CARROT CAKE EVER!

I used walnuts instead of pecans.. chopped them up nicely and topped the cream cheese with walnuts for every small square I cut. 

My family loves this and I am doing this again for my churchs' fun fair!

Only difference is that I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Added 2 more tsps of cinnamon for a spicy cake! 

Don't hesitate to try it and if the top is getting burnt before it's done, cover with aluminium foil and you will be fine!

This is how my mom makes Carrot Cake.  I made this into 24 individual cakes for a friend's birthday.  They were enjoyed at "Girls Night Out" in August.  The texture is moist and heavy.  The frosting is sweet and delicious.  I did add the pecans to the cake portion, but not the frosting.  I liked the presentation of these made into individual cakes, but this would also be yummy as a 2-layer cake or a 13 x 9 cake.  Can't go wrong with Carrot Cake in my book.  It is my birthday cake of choice, every August!

This cake was excellent and well received.  The picture does not accurately portray the cake.  After reading the reviews...I made sure to mix the ingredients by hand so I wouldn't over mix it to avoid it from falling in the middle and that worked beautifully.  Also, the picture doesn't show the pecans with the frosting but I added them and received many compliments on how moist the cake was and the pecans with the frosting.  Highly recommend.

I made some of the suggested changes and some of my own. I used Olive Oil instead so that there was no hydrogenated oils in it (used the full 1 1/4 cups of Olive Oil) and added 1/2 cup of Apple Sauce. I also added a additional tsp of vanilla (for 3 tsp in the cake), added the additional tsp of cinnamon (for 3 tsp of cinnamon in the cake) and left out the nuts. Everything else I followed to direction. I made it for our national night out and everyone was raving about it. I was hoping to have some left over to bring home, but everyone at it all.

I would give this 10 stars if I could. No changes from recipe, as it should be. Some helpful things, use parchment paper and line the 9x13 pan, beat the icing for at least 3 minutes, gets it nice and creamy and 3 cups of carrots is about 5 long carrots. Absolutely delicious!!!!!

Delicious and moist! I had a bunch of cupcake liners lying around, so I made carrot cupcakes. I filled the cups about 1/2 to 3/4 full and baked for 20 min. I ended up not making the frosting because the cake itself was sweet enough for me & my family. Also, the first time I made them, the cupcake liners were pretty soaked in oil, so I cut down to 1 cup veg oil for my second try. Still came out moist, but less greasy!

Delicious! I substituted half of the oil with applesauce and used a little less sugar.  Easily one of the best carrot cakes I've ever had.

Good and simple recipe but the timing is off. I used a 9x13 pan like the instructions say, but if I'd left it 40-50 minutes, it would've burned! I took it out after 35 and it was dark (and no, I didn't use a glass pan).

Didnt use peacans. But still was amazing. My first carrot cake from scratch and its so delicious. Next time I might look for a recipe with fewer calories since this is so good you definitely want more than one serving.

Fantastic! very moist and super yummy!  I followed some of the suggestions made by the other reviewers. I used 1/2 brown sugar and added in 8 oz of drained crushed pineapple.  I have gotten so many compliments on this carrot cake!!!

Absolutely decadent!  Only change was 3/4 c. light olive oil and 1/2 c. unsweetened applesauce in place of the 1 1/4 cup oil.  Left the pecans out of the frosting, as I did not see that ingredient until the cake was frosted!  Never had a carrot cake this delicious!  Added this one to my favorites, as I know I will be making this one for as long as I am baking.

the minute I walked thru the door, this cake was gobbled up. This was my very first carrot cake from scratch and it was a big hit!! I eyeballed the amount of carrots and cinnamon I used and added walnuts instead of pecans. My husband said it was the lightest and the most moist carrot cake he had ever eaten...and he doesn't even like carrot cake.

This recipe is 5 stars! Actually, it's 10 stars! This is the ONLY recipe I will continue to use. The only change I make is swapping out half of the vegetable oil for unsweetened apple sauce (makes it super moist too!!) and I use 1 cup of white sugar 1 cup of brown - I also add a bit of extra cinnamon and I grate the carrots with a smaller microplane by hand, saving half of the juice that I then re-add to the batter.

It's a great recipe, and the cake turned out perfect! The only alteration I made was replacing half the pecans with walnuts and raisins (50/50). For the frosting, I only used 2.5 cups of icing sugar instead of 4. Other than that, the recipe is perfect as is. Thank you very much!

The icing in on this is amazing - not too sweet, not too thick like cream cheese icing sometimes is. The cake came out a little tough and not as moist as I would have liked, but that may have been my own fault since I replaced some of the oil with applesauce. I'll be making it again without the replacement to see what happens.

I made this cake for my son's 12th birthday party and was a big hit - everyone loved it and some came back for seconds!  It was easy to make, I had all the ingredients in my pantry (and frig), and it was delicious!  Highly recommend this recipe!

Really delicious! I chose this one because I didn't think I would care for any coconut or pineapple.  I used the grater attachment on my food processor and grating the carrots was a snap! Mine took a little longer to cook, but I just kept checking it until the toothpick came out clean. I did decrease the sugar amount in the icing a little bit.  I also decided to leave the nuts out of the icing as well.

This cake was great; I made if for Easter. I used fresh pineapple, because I did not have canned and used walnuts, finely chopped, because we did not have pecans. My father-n-law raved about it and he is a wonderful cook! I also used the cream cheese frosting II from this website to top it off..........yummy!

Very good!  Nice and moist.  I used a food processor to shred my carrots and it worked well.  I was a bit over 3 cups, but it didn't make a difference.  I think it may have been good with some raisins in it.  When I made the frosting I only used 3 cups powdered sugar because we don't like things overly sweet here.  The frosting was divine!  Cake was a big hit at Easter!

Followed ingredients and directions as listed and it came out delicious.  I have two slices left and made it yesterday.  I've never made carrot cake before and I really enjoyed it.  I didn't have any regular carrots on hand only 2 bags of baby carrots.  I only needed 1 1/2 bags of baby carrots for this recipe and it came out great!  Husband and 1 year old daughter love it (she hasn't really eaten the icing only the cake).  I will make this again!

This carrot cake was a BIG hit at my party, it was all gone before the end of the party!! I followed instructions with a few minor simple changes after reading different reviews. I strained the grated carrot as much as I could by hang to reduce adding any extra added carrot juice to make cake extra moist. I also did 1 1/2cup white sugar, and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I added 1/2 cup walnuts (instead of pecans) 1 cup raisins, and 3/4 cup of canned chunk pineapple (without juice). I let it cool outside of refrigerator over night but covered it to stay fresh. I chilled the frosting overnight to make a creamier texture and frosted cake in morning. Cake was perfectly moist when we ate and it was delicious. ALso, modified frosting to 3cups powd.sugar instead of 4. I only had to bake 45mins and it was perfect time. My oven is pretty standard.

I made this cake for Easter.  I was happy with the results, however I may try another recipe because even after following it to a "T" with all fresh ingredients it fell somewhat in the middle.  I used crushed walnuts on top for preference.  No nuts in the batter.  My guests complimented it said they loved how it was a little crisp on the bottom.  The frosting was yummy but makes almost double.

Based on a large amount of reviews, I decided on this recipe for my sons birthday party. I guess I should have tried it prior to counting on it for company. It was disaster!  The spice was great and that's it!  It fell horribly in middle and was super crispy on the outer edge. And I know how to bake a cake.. No over mixing.. Opening oven door.. Taking out too early.. And so on. This upsets me as most reviewers base a review on THEIR changes!  Some even change almost every single ingredient!  Wish people would PLEASE base reviews on original recipe. Then maybe make suggestions AFTER a proper/fair review.

Ok first let me say how much I hate carrot cake, but my family insisted I find and bake them a delicious carrot cake for a reunion so after lots of researching I found this recipe. I still don't like carrot cake but this recipe was so good that not only did my family rave about it, but I actually enjoyed it  myself! Very moist and tasty. And then I topped it off with cream cheese frosting and it just made you want to melt inside! Very good. I followed the recipe exact and it turned out wonderfully.

Very good icing.  Cake needs 1/2 cup of applesauce to give it moisture.

Best carrot cake ever!
It's the first time I've made carrot cake from scratch and I was surprised how easy it was. I especially liked the frosting, and the pecans were a great touch; I'm not a raisin fan, and the added texture was great.
For a shortcut I purchased pre-shredded carrots by the bag which I then chopped into smaller pieces to avoid those long stringy pieces you sometimes find in homemade carrot cakes. It was still a lot better than having to grate 3 cups by hand!
This cake is best served at room temperature; after you refrigerate it you'll want to give the frosting a chance to soften for the best experience.
I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to impress their company!

I made this cake for Girls night, and so much for being 18 servings, I think it was about 12! They couldn't get enough of it -  really moist and tasty -  I used walnuts instead of pecans (can't get pecans here in Italy) I'll add a picture of how I decorated it, if I can...

I cut this recipe in half and made in a 9" square pan... maybe that changed the outcome.  The cake didn't just sink in the middle, it is like a crater.  I've never had that happen before and I even used some apple sauce in place of oil as suggested by another baker.  It also is very brown, unlike the picture.  My daughter asked where the carrots were because you can't see them.  I will say though the frosting is the best!

This cake was fabulous!  My kids do not like cakes so for their birthdays I've always made Cookie cakes.  This year my son finally told me he likes Carrot cake so I made this cake and the WHOLE family loved it!  In fact, we've been enjoying the leftovers, something we never do.

I didn't want to alter the recipe but when I saw some people were using brown sugar (which I love), I decided to use 1 cup white/1 cup brown.  I'm sure it would be just as delicous in it's original plan.  Thank you so much for sharing!!!

This is outstanding. Made one for Christmas and now everyone requests this for their birthday. This is hands down one of the most delicious cakes I have ever made. Go heavy on the carrots (4 c.).

I followed the suggestions of the other users and reduced the amount of oil used (I used 2/3 cup oil and 2 packets/cups of motts apple sauce). I used walnuts instead of pecans. Turned out great!

I bumped up my oven to 350 as others recommended and did not use the put in freezer afterwards bc as someone else commented i didn't need my freezer defrosting.  I thought this was delicious even wo the frosting.

I made one alteration to the original recipe, I used 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup white. It was moist and came out perfect in 45 minutes, but I only gave it four stars because the cake needed more spice. I'm not a fan of cream cheese so I iced with White Cake Frosting I. It worked well with the carrot cake.

This recipe was awesome & easy! Thank you for the recipe!! It's a huge hit!!! Below are some slight changes I made due to reading reviews and to my liking :o) 

Cake Mix:
Ommited Pecans
Used 1 Cup Brown Sugar, 1 Cup White Sugar
Used 3/4 Cup Oil, 1/2 Cup Apple Sauce

Baking Time: 
Approx. 40 mins ( I kept checking back) 
Its best not to shake the pan too much to check if its done because the MIDDLE will definitely sink in! 

Frosting: 
I used 2 and a Half cups of powdered sugar

I baked this cake for a friends' birthday a couple weeks ago and it was great! Everyone loved it. I made a couple changes, which were cutting out the oil completely and replacing it with one cup of no sugar added applesauce, as well as omitting the pecans since I don't like them. I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site, which has been my staple cream cheese frosting recipe for quite some time now. I will make this cake again for sure. It was excellent.

Wow! I don't even like carrot cake and I couldn't stop eating this one! Made some changes that were suggested by others: used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar; added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon. Also, didn't use the frosting recipe, I used one from Barefoot Cantessa instead. The best carrot cake I've ever had!

For lack of a better way of putting it, this cake is "just right." Just the right moisture, just the right carrot flavor, just the right amount of cinnamon flavor, just the right sweetness. Wouldn't change a thing. I made it as written, and we both loved it. That's saying a lot for my husband who isn't the biggest carrot cake fan. This recipe is also pretty forgiving if you don't have everything on hand. The second time I made it I was short half a cup of carrots, so I added just a bit of milk to make up for moisture content. Still turned out scrumptious.

I made this for Christmas dessert and it was delicious!  I am known for messing up cakes, but this one got rave reviews.  I added a bit of crushed pineapple and used a little less oil.  Also, per other reviewers, added 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and an extra tsp of cinnamon.  The recipe adjusted beautifully for high altitude - awesome!

Excellent cake! I used most of the modifications suggested by gneebeanie and baked two 9" rounds for 33 mins. The cake was dense but not overly sweet. It took a double batch of frosting to cover the cake when layered. I used only 2 cups of confectioners' sugar per batch - it lightly sweetened the frosting without making it overly sweet. I already have plans to make again.

Only carrot cake recipe I use.  This is so moist and flavorful that it can be eaten without the frosting.  

I did use a few of gneebeanie's suggestions, such as the brown/white sugar split, and oil/applesauce split, and the extra tsp vanilla, nutmeg and cinnamon.

used changes by gneebeanie except only 1 tsp of baking soda/powerder. Bet recipe is great as is.
This was too easy. The batter was runny so I was worried but it turned out great.

After reading one reviewers comments on collecting all the alterations made to the recipe by other reviewers, and then giving their selection on what worked, the cake came out perfect.  It was the first time I had ever made a carrot cake and the recipe made me look like a pro.  Very tasty, moist and was a hit! I will definitely be making it again!

I chose this carrot cake recipe because it was the only one whose ingredients I had in my kitchen at the time (I didn't have all of the spices called for in others).  It was my first time making carrot cake.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out excellent!  Will definitely make again!  First time making cream cheese icing and wasn't sure I was doing it right at the beginning, but after a few minutes it came together really well.

My bf made this cake for me and I loved it! It's moist, fluffy and a beautiful brown color. He added raisins since I like them. The frosting was delish, though he used only 2.5 cups of sugar. Overall, it's a total success. I want to brag about it.

Most carrot cake recipes include pineapple, which I can't have, so I'm glad I found this one. As many other reviewers, I also tweaked this recipe using 1 C. of white sugar and 1 C. of brown sugar. I also used walnuts because I had some in my freezer. I used 2 9-inch round pans and baked at 350 for 30 mins. then rotated the pans (because I did notice the middle sinking a bit) for an additional 10 mins. The cake is pretty dense but has a great flavor...tastes like carrot cake lol! Overall, I'm happy :) Thanks for sharing the recipe!!

Everyone loves this carrot cake, it's the best one I've found so far! And, I don't even like carrot cake. I just top it with my cream cheese. This cake is very flavorful. This only change I make is I prefer to toast my pecans before I add them.

This was excellent.  Made into muffins to share with neighbors so we wouldn't eat it all!  I used half white sugar, half brown sugar and half white flour, half whole wheat flour.  It was very moist and full of flavor.  This one will go into the keeper file.

WOW! This was the best cake I have ever made from scratch, and is really easy!  My husband took some to work today and he keeps sending me messages about how yummy the cake is. I made this as a double layer cake and left out the pecans because we don't care for them.  Other than that, I made this recipe exactly as written. Baked at 350 for 35 min. Make this cake and you will LOVE yourself for it.

Yum! This was a huge hit at my pot luck. The frosting was a little too buttery for my taste (I really despise butter) but everyone else was ranting and raving about it. I will definitely make this again.

I made this cake this weekend and let me say - it was fantastic!  It was my first attempt at baking something from scratch so I was a little nervous, but it turned out delicious.  I'm not a fan of pecans so I omitted them but otherwise MADE THE RECEIPE AS LISTED.  I'm throwing a baby shower this fall and will try making these in mini cupcake tins.  YUM!

This is a moist, sweet, cake. This is *not* the carrot cake I thought I was going to get, though.  I don't know why but after looking at other recipes and mods now, I'm assuming I wanted something with brown sugar and perhaps applesauce.  Not the recipe's fault but if you're looking for that "traditional carrot cake with cream cheese frosting" this isn't it.

Cake tastes good. Followed directions exactly, but center fell (which seems to be a common problem after reading other reviews) and cake stuck to the pan which ripped the top off. Will probably try again mainly because I want to conquer this recipe!!

An excellent, easy recipe! My husband came home from work and "suggested" we have carrot cake for dessert. I whipped this up in no time! The only change I made was to halve the recipe and leave out the pecans because I had none on hand. Will definitely make again! A nice change from all the pineapple-infused recipes floating around.

The cake was wonderful, most moist carrot cake i have ever had!  However, try this for the MOST amazing frosting:
2 pk cream cheese (room temp)
2 cups icing sugar
1/2 cup margarine (soft, room temp)
the icing is what made this cake 5 stars!!!

This was great! It was so moist. The only changes I made was to use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and used half the amount of sugar.

The only thing I do differently is reduce the oil to 1c.  You don't need to add anything to substitute either!
Optional: Substitute 2/3c caster sugar with 2/3c packed brown for a deeper flavour. 
Optional to add a tin of chopped pineapple or some poppy/pumpkin seeds or orange zest.
SO Yummmmy!

PS if you're out of cream cheese, just take a cup of icing sugar and add a few drops of lemon/lime juice (& zest) to make a paste. Not the same but compliments this cake.

Really nice, easy recipe.  The day I made it, it was light and fluffy.  The next day, after being covered with plastic wrap over night, it was soft and moist.  I'm not a frosting person so this rating is for the cake only as I didn't make the topping.  :o)

I made this cake according to the directions the first time then made it again with a few adjustments.  I would have liked to have given it 5 stars on its own merit; however, it got better reviews after the adjustments.  I followed what a few others did and used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup canola oil.  I also added an extra tsp. each of vanilla and cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I omitted the nuts since nobody in my family wanted them.  I wound up having to use 2 packages of cream cheese in the frosting because it was too runny but after adding the extra cream cheese it came out perfect.

All and all with the few minor changes it was a very moist, flavorful cake.  I even made cupcakes and they were wonderful.  I'll be making this again for sure.

very good!! I made it into muffins for a family BBQ, all were gone quickly, a bit heavy on the oil I would probably sub  1/4 cup of the oil with apple sauce next time, and a dash of all spice were my only suggestions otherwise delicious

Loved it. Simple as that! Very very moist, and so good. I did however, substitute the oil for melted margarine, because I didn't have any on me at the time, and it came out perfect! :) Next time, I'll be sure to use the oil, and see how that turns out.

This is seriously the best carrot cake on the planet (with some minor tweaking).  If you follow all of the changes that gneebeanie made, you can't go wrong.  I make this every Easter, and leftovers are hard to come by! :~)

Moist & Flavorful!  I made some of the popular changes too - 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil, 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar instead of 2 cups white sugar, and an extra teaspoon of vanilla.

Unfortunately, I didn't get to try the frosting!  Cooking lesson - label your containers.  I accidentally used cake flour instead of powdered sugar so no go on the frosting.

2 1/2 stars would be more accurate of our opinion of this cake.  Did not like this cake!  I followed the cake recipe with the exception of using 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce, I made no other changes.  I thought the cake turned out dry and bland, tasted like a bland spice cake.  Edible but not good.  I also did not like the frosting.  I followed the frosting recipe exactly and I didn't like it.  It tasted too "cheesecake-y", which just wasn't right for this cake.  I took a lot of time and money to make this cake and it would have been much better and so much easier (and cheaper) if I would have just used a store bought boxed cake and frosting.  I expected it to be better considering all the 5 star ratings. We are big desert people here and no one wanted seconds of this cake. I won't make this again.

BEST carrot cake I've ever tasted! I am gluten free so I use this recipe with gluten free flour and it is AMAZING! So moist! You can also make cupcakes with it and put them on the same oven temp. for about 20 min. (frequently check them) This recipe is GENIUS! I don't know what I would do without it! I never used to like carrot cake until i tried this recipie..:DDDDD It was soooooo good!

I used this recipe to make 18 large muffins.
I halved the oil and sugar, used brown sugar not white, 2 1/4 cups whole wheat flour, 2 tsps baking powder, 1/2 tsp baking soda, omitted salt, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice, 6 large carrots finely grated and omitted nuts.
Baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes, excellent healthy muffin for my sons lunches and snacks.

This carrot cake is extremely moist and delicious!

We used a food processor to shred the carrots instead of grate them, and it worked perfect.  We put it in the oven for 50 min at 350 and it was gorgeous.  A tad crunchy on the outside, perfectly cooked through and moist on the inside.

We only used 1 cup of oil and omitted the additional 1/4C- no need for it.  Instead of this icing, I made my own Espresso Crunch icing with instant coffee grinds, vanilla extract, cream cheese and butter.  Absolutely out of this world!!!!

Texture and moisture were great! Although I was a bit weary using that much oil. Too sweet for my tastes though. Will use half the sugar next time.

Very good for how easy it was.  I was scared about the frosting based on the reviews that it was too sweet - but didn't think so at all.  I still prefer a carrot cake loaded with pineapple, nuts, raisins etc etc - but for a super quick one - great!

Perfect, moist cake with perfect frosting! Made for sons 1st birthday party, I did cupcakes and one smash cake for my son. Everyone loved it! I did do 1 cup brown sugar & 1 cup white & added 1 tsp nutmeg. I didn't use the nuts. On the frosting I reduced the powdered sugar to 3 1/2 cups. Super hit recipe!!! Thank you!!

Let me tell you.....this was my first time making carrot cake. I have always loved carrot cake and thought why don't I  make it for Passover dessert. Let me just say I was wowwed! Completely satisfied my tastebuds. Loved it just the way it is written. The only thing if I may say preference wise for myself is the icing was a little sweet for  my tooth but the best cream cheese forsting I have ever tasted also. This is five stars in my book. If anyone says different.......I don't know why they would. A must to have in anyone's recipe book collection.

I made this for Easter and it was wonderful!  I made it exactly by the recipe except I used  3.5 cups of confectioners' sugar. This was my first ever from scratch carrot cake and everyone that tried it said it was great.  I'm making it next week for my son's band concert party.  I think I will try adding nutmeg, more cinnamon and vanills extract as other readers have suggested.

Tried carrot cake for the first time using THIS recipe, and--oh my goodness--SO good! I did not have enough carrots, but I was craving carrot cake, so I did this: The recipe calls for 3 cups of grated carrots but I only had 1, so I added 1/2 cup of shredded unsweetened coconut and 1/2 cup of raisins, along with 1 cup of shredded APPLE.  I did make the few changes as many have suggested--Reducing oil to 3/4 cups and substituting the rest with 1/2 cup homemade chunky applesauce (with molasses), increasing cinnamon from 2 tsp to 4, and increasing vanilla from 2 tsp to 3. I also added a pinch of allspice. The cake was soft, moist but flaky at the same time, had a hint of spice and vanilla which wasn't too strong but just perfect, but still had that scrumptious carrot flavour with a touch of apple, and I also did not have enough cream cheese so I made a thick cream cheese glaze using the confectioner's sugar instead = yummy. It may be a little too sweet for some people, so I tried this recipe a second time and reduced sugar from 2 cups to 1 3/4 cups; the cake was not as dark but it was still very good. Overall, fantastic results and everyone loved it. Saying that this was one of the best recipes I have ever tried would be an understatement!

AMAZING!! I made this for Easter this past weekend and it was to die for. I also used 1c white and 1c brown sugar and 3.5 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting, this cake was so good! Everyone loved it and even though they were so full, it was gone by the end of the night - serving 6 people!

I actually had to make this cake twice, since I forgot the carrots the first time and didn't realize it until the cake was in the oven. LOL. I am actually glad I made the mistake, though, because I liked it better without the carrots. (I left out the nuts. My husband hates them.)
 
It was almost perfect without the carrots. Unfortunately, when the carrots were added, the raisins where in too high of proportion. It could also do with more spice. Now I know the carrot flavor depends on the carrots you use, and mine were getting a little aged, but next time I make it, I may add some carrot puree to amp up the carrot flavor. I am pretty sure I will make it without carrots again, though. (I have not decided yet if I will add more spice to that one.)

Overall, pretty good cake. Really easy to make. Thank you Tammy.

This was the first time I'd ever made a carrot cake. I made it exactly as instructed, except made it a layer cake using 2 round cake pans. My husband and friends said it's the BEST carrot cake they've ever had! I just made it again yesterday for Easter dinner and it got the same rave reviews as being the absolute BEST! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

This is absolutely the best carrot cake recipe! It's so easy that my 12 year old daughter can make it, too. We just modified it a tiny bit, by cutting down on the confectioner's sugar for the frosting. Usually we just use 2.5 cups, and it tastes perfect- not too sweet, right in the middle. A great cake to make for Easter, as well!

GREAT! I did as many other users suggested and did 1 cup of regular sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar.  I added the 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg as well.  I also chose to not follow the oil as many other did; I did 3/4 cup butter and 1/2 applesauce.  The cake was very moist and delicious!!  Only had to bake it 40 minutes.  The only thing I plan to do differently next time is either cut wayyy back on the pecans, or actually completely omit them.  Pecans give a strong flavor (stronger than many other nuts) and my family felt this was a flavor that wasn't bad, but took away from the flavor of the actual cake.

The frosting is delicious too!  Followed it exactly!  I didn't use the bar/block of cream cheese though, I just scooped it from the large tubs they sell at Costco.  Not sure if that makes a difference.  (Next time I will probably omit the nuts from it too though, for the same reasons as the cake).

1 star.  I understand that carrot cake is made many many different ways and to ones liking.  To me a good carrot cake is a dark moist cake that is spicy almost like a pumpkin cake.  This is "ok" cake as far as cakes are concerned.  However to pawn this off as a 5 star carrot cake is crazy. When you bake it, your kitchen should smell like your cooking a carrot cake, not baking cookies. No cloves,nutmeg, allspice, mace or ginger.  To me this tasted like a snickerdoodle recipe made into a cake. Very bland but moist cake. Tasted more like a dessert bread.  Icing was great though. If you like a dark spicy carrot cake, stay away!

I also found this while searching for a no-pineapple recipe. And as KAELHA said, it's not fair to make a gazillion changes, THEN rate it! ;-p This recipe is totally delish as is!  Making again to share with a neighbor who is allergic to cinnamon, this time I used 1 1/2 tsp freshly-grated nutmeg and 1/2 tsp ginger. For the more adventuresome of you, I also traded out 2 T dark sesame oil for the veggie oil. YUM!!

This is the carrot cake/cream cheese icing combination I craved while I was pregnant and never found.  It is perfect!  The cake texture is moist and not lumpy or too dense.  The icing is a perfect combitation of sweetness and cream cheeseness.  I halved the oil and applesauce.  Perfect recipe!!!!  Thanks!

I made this recipe for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was AWESOME! I thought the amount of oil was a lot, so I only used 3/4c. I didn't change anything else besides leaving out the pecans. The recipe made 48 cupcakes and the amount of frosting was perfect. Thanks so much - I will definitely make this again!!

Simply AMAZING!  I've baked many carrot cakes from various sources, and this one is by far the best yet....I made a few substitutions as suggested by "gneebeanie" (I followed substitutions 1-6 in her comments) which I definately recommend everyone do!  I finished the top of my cake (baked in 2 9" round cake pans and iced according to the directions) with candied pecan halves!  The result (looks and taste) was stunning! This recipe is definately a KEEPER!

Totally delicious and I made a low fat version (used applesauce instead of oil, egg beaters instead of eggs and cut sugar by about a third based on preferences) of cupcakes (cook about 20 minutes).   If I wasn't dieting, I'd make as is for a totally sinful, delicious treat!

Best carrot cake i've ever had! I did every thing the recipe said except 1 1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar. Turned out great! Thanx for the recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly (except skipped the butter in the frosting) and it was great!  The cake is wonderful.  It did fall a little in the center and I'm not sure why.  I stirred by hand, so maybe I should have beat it with my mixer?  Either way, once the frosting went on, it was beautiful and yummy!

This is the same recipe my mom used forever.  My favorite cake (have had people that didn't like carrot cake like this one)  I usually leave the pecans out of the cake and either just mix them with the icing, or press them into the sides of the frosted cake.  Can also substitute all or part of the oil with applesauce to save alot of fat/calories and still taste great.  I've also used lower fat cream cheese (don't use fat free).  Great recipe!

This has been an amazing cake numerous times! I've done a couple things differently a couple different times. I have followed "gneebeanie" with their sugar, vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon; I've used 1/2 cup oil with 20 oz of drained crushed pineapple; I've used 2.25 cups powdered sugar in the frosting; and I've also served with cake with just whip cream and no frosting. I've probably used walnuts instead of pecans, and Light Smart Balance instead of butter, at times, too.

Awesome recipe "as is".   So good, in fact, that the husband asked I never make it again, as he will eat the whole thing.  :) 

Since the recipe didn't clarify how thick to grate the carrots, I used the "fine" side on my grater.  Carrots seemed to disappear into the cake after baking, which I preferred.     I also omitted the nuts as I don't like them. 

Family and friends loved this cake!

I halved the recipe and made cupcakes, it turned out to 12 cupcakes. It was quick and easy to make, though I found that it was too much oil. Even after baking there was a little extra oil on the bottom of the cupcakes, so I think next time I'll take others suggestions and use some apple sauce instead of some of the oil. The icing was awesome though, really tasty. Overall a really tasty cake recipe, will make again :)

I followed suggestions as compiled by gneebeanie.  I did strain pineapple first (8 oz can).  Other difference is I used 3/4 c. applesauce 1/2 c. canola oil.  The frosting was not my favorite but the cake was wonderful!

I'll add my 5-star rating. Made it as a birthday cake and everyone ... absolutely everyone ... loved it. Used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup vegetable oil instead of the recipe amount. Also grated some fresh nutmeg into it. Baked in 2 8" square pans so cooked only 40 minutes (til tester came out clean). Made the frosting per recipe, covering the top with crushed walnuts. Awesome!

Made this today for my daughter's birthday. It was delish - everyone really liked it. I took a few ideas from other reviewers and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown; 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce; 1/4 tsp nutmeg; omitted the nuts and kept the rest the same. I baked it in a bundt pan and it took about 45 min. Iced 2/3 of the cake with my own cream cheese frosting and left the rest plain - birthday girl does not like frosting. It was so very moist and yummy!

I have been baking this cake for several years now and no others can compare.  I don't put nuts in it but chop walnuts up real fine and sprinkle on top.  This cake is a no-fail, real dessert pleaser!

This was fabulous! I stuck right to the original recipe and it came out perfectly! It was moist and flavourful. I did leave out the nuts, due to an allergy.  The only thing I changed, was by using a different frosting. I used the allspice cream cheese frosting fromt the site.  My 11 yr old who doesn't like cake, requested that I make this for his birthday.  Excellent recipe!

After forgetting to thin my carrot section in the garden a few summers ago, I had any overflowing amount of small carrots! I found this recipe and make six cakes, Freezing 5 of them to save for later. I use this recipe all the time now, and the family and friends absolutly love it!

This was soooo good :) 

I made it exactly as written but divided the batter into 2 9inch cake pans and made it a layer cake.  It took 40 min at 350 degrees and it turned out perfect!

Loved it and I hate cakes! This is the most amazing carrot cake out there. I like the fact that it did not call for baby food.... I like seeing the carrots. I didn't have any pecans so I added raisins instead at it rocked! Even my son loved it and he does not like cream cheese. Thanks so much for the recipe it's a keeper for sure.... As a matter of fact my husband just ate the last piece and asked me to make another!

I made this cake to take to work with me and everybody loved it!  They are still talking about it.  I added more cinnamon (about 1/2 teasp. more), 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, and 1 more teaspoon of vanilla (I read that others liked this).  I would definitely make this again...well worth trying.

Fantastic!  Used whole wheat flour + 1/2 c flax seed, used 1 c. applesauce and reduced the oil to 1/2 cup.  Also used fat free cream cheese and no butter in the frosting.

I followed the recipe as listed and it was by far the best carrot cake I have ever eaten. My favorite part of all was adding the pecans in the frosting instead of on top. It made the cake BEAUTIFUL! Also, after the cake cooled I cut it in half and frosted the center too. It made for the double dose of frosting. Yum! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was the most delicious carrot I ever had!  I chose to make it a layer cake instead, so I baked it in two 9" cake pans for 40 minutes.  I also only put 2 1/2 cups of confectioner's sugar in the frosting which, for my taste, was perfect.  I followed the rest of the recipe exact.  I made it for a holiday and everyone loved it.  A definite keeper!

Excellent cake but I thought it could use a little more spice. Added a little nutmeg in the second one and that was perfect.

This cake is slap yo' momma good.  Ok, you may not slap her, but you will shake your finger at her (LOL).  This is one of the best carrot cakes I've made.  I made exactly per dircections, but added small can of crushed pineapple with a little juice.  Cake came out moist. I also did a bourbon cream cheese frosting.  Delicious!

For our family, this cake was simply too oily. The taste of the fat overwhelmed the whole thing and the carrot flavour was masked. I would never make this again or I would scale way back on the oil, we found it tasted oily. Because of the addition of carrots usually less oil fat is required to make a cake moist. This recipe calls for more than half of the flour quantity in oil-I should have known better. I think that the reviewers who used applesauce probably had better success. Thank you for sharing anyway.

I've made this cake TWICE after thinking that I must have done something wrong the first time when it completely SANK in the middle. Nope, followed recipe EXACTLY the second time too and it also sank!! UGH, a lot of time and money wasted! Seems to call for a lot of leavening agent..maybe it has something to do with altitude too, I don't know, but this was a complete FAILURE! I've never had this happen with a cake before.

Whenever I make this cake, I feel like a genius! It is SO moist and tastes SO good. I subbed applesauce for half the oil and only used two cups of powdered sugar in the frosting, which was perfect. NOTE: I recommend sifting the powdered sugar. I couldn't get the tiny lumps out! I finally put it in the blender and that worked great, though!

I made this last night and it was delicious. as per some other people's suggestions, I cut down the sugar and used 1 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also only used 1 cup of oil, that was plenty and the cake was still moist! For the frosting I sued 3 cups of sugar instead of 4 but next time I think I will only use 2 cups. It was super sweet with 3 cups of sugar.

This cake tasted amazing but the only problem was that it cooked funny. I don't know if it was just me doing something wrong in the recipe but it seemed to flatten and almost boil over in the pan on the sides. It was also rather hard to get out of the pan.

Very good cake! Moist and light. The only thing I would change is the amount of sure. Next time I will definately use less sugar, perhaps even half of the suggested amount. Also, I added 125gms (approx. 4 ounces) more of cream cheese to the frosting.

Best Carrot cake ever!  Only thing I would mention is to make sure you oven rack is directly in the middle of the oven.  I had to leave mine in the oven an extra 10 minutes or so and I added a little more cinnamon than the recipe called for and 1 tsp Nutmeg.  My boyfriend loved it so much he suggested we make it for thanksgiving dinner dessert.

My family and I enjoyed this very much.  We didn't frost it as it was good plain.  Gave it a 4 as the bottom seemed oily as opposed to being overly moist.  Will make again, but plan to substitute some applesauce for oil and some brown sugar for the white sugar.

So good!  My whole family loved it.  I would add a little bit more spice.. some ground ginger and a pinch of nutmeg.  I was also thinking next time I'll add a handful of raisins.  We cut out the nuts as noone in our family like nuts in our carrot cake.  Definately we will use this recipe again and again. :)

I got many compliments on my cake, however I did use many suggestions from the top rated reviewer (used a can of pineapple, 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, extra cinnamon and extra vanilla).  Also I didn't use pecans in case of an allergy.  Ok, so I made quite a few changes, but it was delicious anyway!

I'm of the mind that you rate a recipe based on the recipe itself, not the changes you made.  I made this recipe as is for my sister-in-law's birthday and it turned out perfect!  The whole family loved it.  My husband took it took work and a coworker said it was the best he ever had, simply because it wasn't as spicy as most carrot cakes.  The flavor of the cake is subtle and enjoyable - so I would not recommend changing the vanilla or cinnamon measurements, or adding any other spices.    If you want a simple carrot cake that will please everyone, this is definitely for you.

FABULOUS MOIST CAKE! I made this cake a couple of days ago and the only thing I changed was 1c white sugar & 1c brown sugar. Other then that, everything was the same (IMO it's just plain nasty to add applesauce or pineapple to a CARROT cake - I've never even heard of pineapple carrot cake or applesauce carrot cake - EEW!) and it was PERFECT! I made this into a 2 layer cake using two 9" round cake pans. I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, not the frosting listed with this recipe, and it was MAG-NE-FEEK! lol :-) This is my staple now!

DELICIOUS! This was an awesome carrot cake recipe and my family was amazed I made this from scratch. I didn't have enough carrots, almost 2 1/2 cups and it still tasted very much like carrot cake. I did read several reviews before making this recipe and made some modifications. For a much healthier version, I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 canola oil. Trust me, you won't miss the rest of the oil, it is extremely moist. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 3/4 cup white sugar. I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla extract. I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. And I used 3/4 cup walnuts. For the frosting, I softened 6-7 ounces neufchatel cheese and mixed 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and about 1/2 cup powdered sugar. It was enough frosting for the top. After calculating the calories, the cake was around 274 calories! When I tried this cake the first day, I felt like it was missing some sort of spice. But the next day, all the flavors came together perfectly and it was PERFECT.

AWESOME CAKE!  As much as I hate when people make changes instead of rating the original recipe... I did use half white/half brown sugar. Otherwise I didn't change any ingredients, I just baked it in 2- 9" cake pans instead of the 9x13. I've made this several times now and everyone always loves it! Even my husband who thought he hated carrot cake is a big fan.  The frosting is also the perfect ratio of butter/sugar/cream cheese.

After reading the reviews, I decided to use all brown sugar to make the cake moister. Also, when I measured the flour, I spooned it into the cup and then leveled with a knife: this way you get less flour and as a result, lowers the ratio of dry : wet ingredients. The cake was very moist and delicious with 1/2 cup of raisins (coated with flour to prevent sinking). But a tad more cinnamon would have made the cake even better.

Self-proclaimed carrot cake aficionados have said this is the best carrot cake they've ever had.  People have requested I make this for their birthday cakes.  This recipe makes me really happy.  :)  The only thing I change is the amount of confectioner's sugar in the frosting...I just do 2 to 2.25 cups instead of the 4.  I feel it makes the most perfect cream cheese frosting and it compliments the best carrot cake ever very well.

This recipe was amazing.  It has to be one of the most delicious recipes I have ever tasted.  I subsituted the oil, with 1/2 cup apple sauce and used only 3/4 cup veg oil and a tin of crushed pineapples (minus the juice) and added more peacan nuts. It came out wonderfully even with my little daughter assisting!

This is a brilliant recipe! I made this cake incredibly healthy, though! I halved the recipe, used apple sauce instead of oil, used half brown half white sugar, and omitted a cream cheese topping ( my family's lactose intolerant ).  This cake came out incredibly moist and delicious!

Wow. this was worth grating all those carrots(about 5 small-medium carrots=3 cups)! I used all the changes gneebeanie mentioned. Applesauce was Sarah's apple sauce from this website. Subbed pecans with walnuts, added in pineapples and baked in 2 9inch pans for apporx 30min.  As for the frosting i kind of eyeballed it..I used less cream cheese because that was all i had and it STILL turned out yummy :) love it!

Oh boy, this cake is good!  I made this for my father's birthday a month ago.  I think the only change I made was to substitute some applesauce for some of the oil (to try to be healthy).  My husband and I couldn't get stop taking tastes every time we walked by it!  My six y.o. didn't care for the nuts in it, but that was okay - more for us!  I'm making this again, by request, for my sister's b-day.  Another great excuse to eat this again.  It was actually pretty easy to make, too.

I made this exactly as stated except I used fresh ground whole wheat flour and raw sugar.  Turned out awesome! **The frosting was way too much for a 9x13 though!

Oh my word! This was my first attempt at carrot cake and its DIVINE!! It is so deliciously moist! I only used 1.5 cups of grated carrot, but no alterations necessary as this recipe is 10/10! My family went nuts over it!

I give this 10 stars!!! This was my first time making Carrot Cake and it was the BEST.  It was so moist.  My kids say they do not like carrots but they like this cake.  I will make this again.  I decided to use Cream Cheese icing from the store but next time will try to make the icing myself.

Holy Yumminess!! This is the best carrot cake ever! It was a tremendous hit with the crowd that ate it and everyone raved. Now I don't like to rate something and then include all the changes I made, but - put the soapbox away - the only change I made was to the oil component. I used two jars of carrot baby food, and added the remainder of the 1 1/4 cups in oil. Well, I also left out the nuts and added crushed pineapple and raisins - put that's to my taste :). It was simply marvelous! My husband is a huge carrot cake fan - I will definitely be making this for his birthday. Thank you, thank you!!

This is by far the best carrot cake that I have ever tasted.  It stayed moist for a full week!! (I doubled the recipe and made a layer cake, which ended up being HUGE).  This has now turned into the birthday cake of choice at my house.  Absolutley fabulous recipe.  Don't change a thing.

I took the suggestions of another reviewer and did the following: 1) Added 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 2) Added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 3) Added almost 1 teaspoon of cinnamon 4) Used 3/4cup oil and 1/2 cup Golden sauce 5) Only 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 cups of brown sugar (no white sugar) I skipped nuts and the frosting 'cause I felt this cake didn't require it!  I baked a few of these as mini-muffins and used the rest to bake a 9x9 cake. TOTALLY out of this world. It made my Easter very Eastery! :D Thank you Tammy! :)

I am not a baker and this was my very first cake that I made from scratch and it came out very moist and delicious.   I took the advice of others to cut some of the oil and substitute it with apple sauce and it worked out great!!!!.  I will definitely keep this and will make again.

This is very similar to the carrot cake we serve in our restaurant.  We bake the cake in 9" layers and serve it in wedges.  Everyone loves it, it is the most requested dessert we serve.

I've made this recipe four times.  I've made it as a 9" layer cake, and as cupcakes.  It does fall in the middle somewhat, even when baking at a higher temp.  Almost too moist, but very delicious.  Received rave reviews.  Tried the 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 white sugar version, but didn't like it as well.  I settled on 3/4 white, 1/4 brown, plus some freshly ground nutmeg as my final version.

i made some common adjustments.  I used walnuts instead of pecans (they're cheaper).  I sub'd 3/4c apple sauce for 3/4c of the oil to cut the fat, used half white / half brown sugar.  I also used 3 cups of icing sugar in the frosting and it was perfectly sweet and yummy.  I took this cake to a dinner party and everyone LOVED it!  This is for sure a keeper!!  I give it 5 stars even with my changes as I think it would still be awesome with no changes.  Thanks for sharing!

This cake is fabulous.  I made it for Easter and everyone loved it.  I used half white, half brown sugar as many others suggested.  I also used only 3 cups of confectioners sugar for the frosting.  I think 4 cups would have been way too sweet.  This is the only carrot cake recipe I'll use from now on.

I didn't try the frosting this time (had a can of store-bought), so this review is of the cake only.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions and used 1 c. brown sugar & 1 cup white, subbed 1/2 c. applesauce for the oil, added 1 8 oz. can drained crushed pineapple, and added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I used 1 pound of carrots to get exactly 3 cups of big shreds (no juice problem). Baked it in 2 oiled and floured 9" rounds for 40 minutes at 350. Even after flouring the pans, the cakes were hard to get out (and my pan sides come off!) so next time I will flour better.  Needed to cook another 5 minutes to get the middles done, or might be better in a 9" x 13" pan.  Outstanding flavor and texture (the done parts, anyway)! The carrot and pineapple chunks look big, but this is the best carrot cake I've ever ha - super moist!  A definite keeper!

This was fantastic. I made it fo Easter to bring to my boyfriend's families house. It was my first time making anything for them so I wanted to impress and this surely did the trick. I did follow other suggestions and did half brown sugar/half white, added a little extra cinnamon and a teaspoon of nutmeg. My boyfriend's mother said it was the best carrot cake she had ever had and asked for the recipe!

Fantastic.  I made the cake in 2 rounds, I did have to bake them longer and keep a watch on them.  I also made it nut free.

I only bake for special occasion.  And this recipe never fails me.  The last time I use this recipe was 3 years ago and it was a hit.  I baked the cake yesterday for Easter day and it was a hit again.  Gone in a flash.  I made few adjustments especially on the sugar, I reduce it to 1 1/4 cup. And as for the frosting I reduce the confectioner's sugar to 2 cups.  However, the portion of the frosting is too much for one cake.   I served the cake with less icing frosting on top and serve the rest of the frosting in another bowl so that any guests who has sweet tooth can opt for more frosting. I LOVE this recipe is the best.

I've never even eaten carrot cake before, but I thought that I would make it for my family for Easter dinner. Everyone loved it, I did a few modifications like the previous reviews have suggested, like less pecans (would eliminate next time), Applesauce, and added brown sugar. I even liked it. Great recipe. Thank you for posting!!

Absolutely delicious.  I have tasted many carrot cakes, but this surpasses all.  This is one of my daughter-in-law's favorite cakes and since she does not care for frostings,I opted to not put any on this cake. I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was scrumptious!  No need to frost. I will treasure this recipe.  Thanks, Tammy.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great every time. I only halved the sugar in the icing and I think next time I might try using a bit less than half since it was too rich and sweet anyways. My whole family and friends loved this cake.

I made this last year and it was my first homemade cake.  It is now a family favorite and I'm asked to bring it to every get together.    Try Cream Cheese Frosting II also from this website.  The 2 recipes together are out of this world.

This cake is delicious! Don't use an insulated baking pan. I tested this recipe as I plan to make it next weekend. It's a good thing it was only a test because I made it in an insulated 9x13 baking pan. It took 1 hour and 5 minutes to bake and the centre caved in a bit. I waited over 30 minutes to remove it from the pan and when I did, it fell apart! There was a small area in the centre that was stuck to the pan even though I had sprayed the pan beforehand with cooking spray. We think the long baking time and even the falling apart might be because I used an insulated baking pan. I am going to try it again using a noninsulated one. The cake is so good that I am determined to make it work! I would like to hear from others if they have made this in an insulated pan.

UPDATE: I made this again using a NON insulated baking pan and it turned out perfectly!. It was done in 50 minutes. The only changes I made to the recipe was I reduced the amount of oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup applesauce. I also used 1 cup brown sugar and one cup white sugar. I omitted the pecans.
Delicious!

I'm not lying - this was the best carrot cake I've ever had, and possibly one of the best things I've ever baked - and I'm an avid baker. I made them as cupcakes (19 minutes bake time) and made the recipe as shown except I only put nuts in the batter, I didn't put them into the frosting. They were so moist and had great flavor and texture.

I used all the modifications provided by gneebeanie except I didn't use pineapple (I didn't have it on hand), and used all the pecans called for (I love pecans). It was a hit at my son's birthday party, and my MIL asked for the recipe. :) Thanks for sharing!!

I wish I could give this cake 10 stars. Wow. I made it this weekend and it was truly one of the best cakes I have ever had. It was so incredibly moist. I left out the pecans. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly.

Good basic carrot cake recipe.  Cream cheese icing was great, although more icing than the cake really needed.

This was my very first attempt at baking anything from scratch. It turned out excellent! I read tons of reviews and made a few changes: Instead of 1 1/4 cup vegetable oil I used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. Instead of 2 cups white sugar I used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown. I also added 3 tablespoons vanilla extract instead of 2. Also substituted chopped walnuts for pecans. For the icing I did not use 4 cups confectioner's sugar as I did not have enough. I ended up using a little over 3 cups and it tasted great. I think 4 cups might be too sweet. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I made this cake tonight and it was a hit. The recipe was simple and didn't require any alteration. I especially appreciated the frosting since I do not like cream cheese. The frosting was great with a hint of cream cheese flavor. Thanks for sharing. I will be making this again.

This cake was excellent. I followed the directions with the exception of adding another tsp. of cinnamon (to make 3 total). I shredded my carrots with my food processor, and then placed them on a paper towel to absorb any excess water. Instead of baking the cake in a pan, I used my mini-muffin pan. The muffins were fairly soft, so instead of frosting them with an offset spatula (which was tearing up the muffins), I put the frosting in a pastry bag with a large star tip adn piped it on. The results were beautiful, delicious, mini carrot cakes!

Great flavor.  The only issue I had was it overflowed out of my pan.  It seems to be more than 9x13.  Don't know what happen but it grew to be huge.  Tasted good though!

This was the an outstanding Carrot Cake Recipe. I did use half white sugar and half brown sugar and some crushed pineapple. I made this for desert after a huge dinner, and still the cake was almost gone! My uncle said that his favorite cake is carrot cake and this was the best he has ever eaten!! Looking forward to making it again!

This was great with the changes others suggested (more cinnamon, add a smidge of nutmeg, half brown sugar instead of all white, less oil).  Also, I took a tip from America's Test Kitchen and always use the largest grate on the carrots so it's not too wet.  Everyone who ate this was beyond satisfied.  I don't even like carrot cake but found this amazing and kept sneaking more pieces.  Thanks and thanks to all the other reviewers who always manage to take a great recipe and make it even better!

You have to bake this in the 9 x 13 pan. I tried splitting it between to 9 inch pans and it ran over and made a HUGE mess in my oven!

This cake was delicious.  It was extremely moist.  I replace the grated carrots with about 2 cups of baby food carrots, which adds to the moistness.

I have made this countless times! By far the best carrot cake ever. Don't change a thing! It even took me a year to share the recipe. It's the only carrot cake I will ever eat!

I have been baking this recipe for years & this is my most requested cake.  You can actually tone down the oil to 3/4 cup.  It will still come out moist.

Best carrot cake!!!! I prepared the recipe just the way it was written & it was delicious. I used 2 round 9 inch pans instead of the 9x13. I recommend using parchment paper as mine stuck to the bottom of the pan.

Yum, used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce,1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. This cake is sooooo good and the icing is irresistable.

Excellent recipe. I made a few changes as written by another reviewer and it was the best carrot cake I have ever had. I did the following: 1.) used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 2.) added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 3.) added 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (I squeezed out most of the juice before adding it) 4.) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 5.) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 6.) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. The result came out incredibly delicious - the cake was very flavorful and moist. For the frosting, I only used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar, and it was more than sweet enough, with a nicely balanced cream cheese vs. sweet flavor. I can't wait to make this again.

I made this carrot cake AS IS, except I didn't hand grate the carrots, I just used a food processor.  I also used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar instead of using only white sugar.  It turned out very moist and perfectly sweet, balanced out nicely by the cream cheese frosting.  I only wish it had more texture, so next time I'll grate chunkier carrots and add in golden raisins.

I did not make any changes to the original cake recipe although I opted to omit the pecans. I think the cake is delicious as is, defiantly the best carrot cake I have ever made and I have made A LOT of them (I make it every year for my hubby's b-day).   I did however, make adjustments to the icing. I started out following it exactly but as many others said, it was WAY to sweet. I suggest the following:  1) use only half the butter (1/4 cup).   2) use 12oz cream cheese (the extra bite of the cream cheese cuts the sweetness)  3) use an extra tsp vanilla (2 tsp total)

I made this for my friend's birthday because she doesn't like any cake except carrot cake.  It was the first cake I have ever made from scratch and it came out wonderfully!  I did use the alterations suggested by some other reviews such as subbing apple sauce for some of the oil and adding crushed pineapple.  I accidentally cooked it a little longer than I intended because I was going off of the time listed even though I was using two 8 inch rounds, but it was still super moist and everyone loved it!  I also added a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the icing.

Simply wonderful! I love carrot cake and has been wanting to try making my own. I read through some suggestions before tackling the task. The changes i made was 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 3 tbs vanilla instead of 2, 3 tbs cinnamon instead of 2, 3/4 cup oil with 1/2 cup apple sauce instead of just the 1 1/4 cup oil. I baked then in 2 9in round pans for 35min in 350 degree. I also used walnuts instead of pecans. For the icing i only used 3 cups confectioners sugar and omitted adding more nuts. My first attempt came out very moist and tasty. Even my 4 year old is asking for more. I will definitely make this again and next time i will add some raisins.

I also added about a teaspoon each of nutmeg and ginger powder.  Highly recommended!  Also, I made it into cupcakes and baked them about 18 minutes.

Very good... it seemed like quite a bit of oil for a cake though. Next time I would like to try subbing in applesauce or something similar for the oil.

This was SO moist, I couldn't believe it!  My husband went nuts (ha).  Here are the errors I made and my overally thoughts: I did add pineapple and my husband loved it.  I, on the other hand would have really preferred this recipe as-is.  If you do add the pineapple, you may need to extend the cook time 10-15 mins...or maybe it was just my oven OR the fact that I used a ceramic pan.  I did not turn the cake out to cool but left it in the pan and piled the frosting high.  With regards to the frosting...I added about two table spoons of melted white chocolate and two table spoons of heavy cream while I was whipping.  I got this from another recipe on this sight.  It also called for orange extract, which once again, my husband loved but I would omit next time.  I did not put the nuts in the frosting.  My final thoughts about THIS recipe (forget all my own alterations), It is absolutely a keeper.  I do think that I would reduce down the sugar in the cake, it was a little sweet for my taste, maybe by about a half a cup.  I know some people swapped the white sugar and used brown (at least partially) I don't think I'll do that, I liked the flavor without the molasis punch that brown sugar delivers.  Also, I don't think I'll ever put nuts in my frosting.  I love a good, smooth, frosting.

Only change I made to this recipe was to substitute 2 cups of white sugar for 1 cup white 1 cup brown.  Since I didn't want a cake, I made 24 cupcakes and must say they are delicious.    *For the icing I only needed 2 cups of confectioners sugar.

This was the first carrot cake that I have ever made and it was fantastic. Moist, soft, and delicious. I did cut down the sugar to just 2/3 cups of white and brown sugar, I used 1 cup of apple sauce and 1/4 cup of oil. I lost count on putting in the teaspoons of cinnamon. I think it was just a tad more than 2 teaspoons since I was measuring them half a teaspoon at a time. I will be making this for my boyfriend's birthday.

Excellent recipe, I prefer to use Cream Cheese Frosting II with a dash of allspice added for a less sweet, deliciously cream-cheesey frosting.

Absolutely delicious but next time I will use less oil, as it was a little too heavy for me but everyone raved about it!

I made 9 servings and put it in a loaf pan. Also, I left out the nuts on the topping. This was really good! Lastly, I used fresh picked baby carrots from the garden.

This is a very good carrot cake.  I made it for my husbands birthday and everyone loved it!  The only alterations I made were substituting wheat flour for the flour and adding 1/2 cup ground flax in place of 1/2 cup flour.  This does not change much of the taste but adds some nutrition.  I also think I accidentally added a little extra cinnamon, but it was still really good.  Will keep and make again and again!

This is the most awesome carrot cake there is. I took this to my husbands work for his birthday. Everyone said it was the best they ever had. It needs nothing added or taken away. If I could I'd give it 10 stars.  MomTeresa

My favorite! I used no nuts. My family doesn't like them, and I used olive oil instead of canola. That is all I had. It turned out perfect. Only 3.5 cups of icing sugar for the frosting and it was still crazy-sweet. I would not go any sweeter. I think I'll use 3 cups next time. Delicious!

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it turned out fabulous. Even those that responded with 'meh' at the suggestion of carrot cake loved it - and devoured the cake. I prefer to try and rate a recipe as given, not modify half the recipe and then give it a review. (I think another reviewer stated this as well.) Nonetheless, this is an impressive and delicious carrot cake - true to what it should taste like.

This was a very good carrot cake.  I had some trouble on the baking time and my cake came out a little too brown for my liking.  I was watching it the whole time and the outside browned as the center was still not set.  It cooked for quite a bit less than recommended.  I used a glass pan and have a gas oven, so it could just be my setup.  I did use 1c brown and 1c white, used a little more vanilla, and only had walnuts on hand.  Very good overall and we enjoyed the cake.

I used all of the modifications suggested (add brn sugar, pineapple, vanilla, applesauce etc.) and this was the best carrot cake I have ever made. One of my guests who didn't even like carrot cake LOVED it!  It also made a nice big pan.  This is perfect for potlucks too!  (Also a great use for cinnamon applesauce that no one at my house seems to like)

This is a really good recipe and I think you could chop and change things easily to add variety.  I thought it was really nice the first day but the second day, the taste was even better and still very moist.  It didn't even get iced before it was gone...lol.

this was my first carrot cake from scratch and it turned out beautifully!  the only thing i would change is the amount of frosting on it (next time i will at least half it).  It was very moist and i got plenty of complements!

6 cups of sugar to make a cake! WOW! I bet you could scale it down to 1/2 cup and leave out the icing. Also, cutting down the oil to 1/2 cup. Besides that, good recipe.

This cake is delicious! I substituted/reduced a little bit the oil by adding 1/2 cup sour cream and unsweetened 1/2 cup of apple sauce for moisture and fluffiness.  I highly recommend you al to try it. Is a hit whenever I bring it to a party or putluck :-))

Flavor-wise, I love this recipe except sort of oily for my taste. I usually sub apple sauce like a lot of the reviewers. On another note, I can't make this cake without it falling in the center and I've made it several times. I bake a lot of cakes each week and this is the only one I can't figure out. I'll have to keep looking.

i made the cake in a bunt pan and it turned out pretty and delicious! I used coconut oil and limited the sugar to 1 cup brown and 1/2 cup white in the cake.  The cake turned out delicious- very moist. For the frosting I cut the powdered sugar in half to 2 cups. It was the BEST cream cheese frosting I've ever had- and still very sweet! Next time I will add even less powdered sugar.  I did not use walnuts.  I highly recommend this recipe for families since it doesn't have raisins, coconut, or pineapple- as long as everyone likes carrots no one will be picking anything out!

this is my all time favorite carrot cake recipe.  well not ver batum of the recipe, but minor tweaks here and there as noted by previous reviews.  1) use only half of the oil and replace the other half with apple sauce 2)use 1 cup of the white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar (light or dark, in order of preference) 3) walnuts are a must, but raisins, pineapples, and other dried fruit or nuts are totally optional i found this recipe best cooked in two 9 inch baking pans.  that way it's easier to set up as a two layered cake.

Amazing carrot cake, but the recipe makes way too much frosting, in my opinion. I only used half of what the recipe made and it still covered the entire cake with about a half inch of frosting! (but the frosting is delicious!)

Absolutely delicious. Everyone in my family agreed that it was the best they've ever had, and now I've found myself making it constantly upon request! I get lazy and buy shredded carrots, mix it into the wet ingredients, then put it in a blender. It works just fine, too. Other than that I pretty much follow the recipe to a T. This is my go-to cake recipe. :)

Awesome recipe!!! I replaced some of the oil with applesauce & didn't use as much powdered sugar for frosting.

I used a few of the other reviewers recommendations (for example, half white half brown sugar)and this cake turned out fabulous!  The whole point of me coming to this site and reading reviews is to learn how to better tweak a recipe for individual taste.  So far, I have not been let down! The cake was very moist with the addition of pineapple (but not too much so) and surprisingly, it was still a lighter cake than I would have expected.  I didn't have pecans which i do love, but used walnuts instead and it was just fine.  Five stars from me!

I absolutely love this recipe and so does my boyfriend. I just put 4 cups of grated carrots instead of the listed 3 cups. For special occasions I do a double layer with icing in the middle and it is always a hit. Thank you so very much for this recipe.

This is a great carrot cake. We have found that it is even better with 1/2 brown sugar.

Made this for a friends birthday, was told best carrot cake ever had. Took left overs to work.... not a crumb remains. I made a layer cake since it was for a birthday on Friday and it is good for days, it actually improves, keep it wrapped up and in the fridge. This is the perfect recipe as is. If you make layers bake layers 30-40 min. Will make this again soon.

This is the first cake I've ever made and it came out delicious! I read the reviews and I tweaked the recipe according to some of the suggestions. To make it a little bit healthier I used wheat flour instead of all-purpose; I used 3/4 cups of vegetable oil and 1/4 of applesauce instead of 1 1/4 cup of vegetable oil; I also reduced the pecans to 1/2 cup and added 1/2 cup of raisins. Also for those who want to bake but do not have the equipment (i.e. a mixer or a food processor) fear not because all you need is a large mixing bowl, a whisk and a little bit of muscle.

OMG!!! This Cake is sooo Delicious, That it was gone in a matter of 2 days, with only a few people eating it. I do like to use apple sauce in recipes that call for oil, to reduce a little of the fat in the recipe. So i used 3/4 Cups of Apple sauce and 1/2 cup of oil. This is the best carrot cake recipe that I have ever made. It is going in my Favorites! Thanks!!

I made all the alterations to the recipe suggested by gneebeanie (Dec. 8, 2006). Draining the unsweetened, crushed pineapple, I soaked 1 cup of raisins in the juice then drained them before adding.  I also reduced the nuts to 1/2 cup, using walnuts.  The cake is so flavorful, the next time around, I'm going to replace the 1 cup of granulated sugar with 1 cup of Splenda to help reduce calories.  With all the alterations, in the end, it's an entirely different recipe but a gourmet treat.

Wow this cake is amazing! It tastes like a professional bakery made it. I did sub half of the oil with apple sauce and used low fat cream cheese to make me feel a little better.

With the modifications suggested by other reviewers (e.g., add nutmug, more cinnamon, applesauce, etc) this cake is DELICIOUS! I made it without any of the recommendations and it was average. With the changes, best cake I've ever had (and everyone who tries it says the same)!

Like this recipe needs another review!  Let me say, I ONLY eat sweets that have chocolate in them, but this....OMG!  It is UNBELIEVABLE!  I used the suggestions from the top reviewer and used half applesauce, pineapple(which you really don't taste but it makes the cake sooo moist!) added extra vanilla, etc.  You must use her alterations, because this cake is absolutely fantastic!  I made this for my hubby for his bday.  My mother in law took one bite, looked up at me, and said, OMG, I've been cooking for 40 years and now you are going to teach ME how to cook!  What a compliment!  PLEASE try this cake everyone.  It really is to DIE for! Thank you so much for making me look like the worlds best baker! =)

Can I give it 6 stars? This is by far the best cake I've ever had, period (all flavors included). My 68 year old father said he'd had none better, and it was my first time making carrot cake, so that's a testament to how easy to follow this recipe is. Like others here, I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown. Also I cut the oil to 3/4 cup and used 1/2 cup applesauce to supplement, and added a little nutmeg into the mix. If there is any problem with this cake it is that the total thing (with frosting) I calculated out to be about 7600 Calories. Split it to 8 pieces, that's just under 1000 Calories a slice, or in other words, 50-75% of one's daily recommended intake. Because of that this cake will only be made for very special occasions, otherwise I would have it weekly. Oh god it is so MOIST! n_n

I am embarrassed to say that this was the first time I had ever made a cake from scratch, oh, except for a cheescake which I have made about 3-4 times.  Up to this point every other cake I have made has come from a box. This carrot cake was awesome!  I looked at some reviews and the only changes I made were adding a teaspoon more cinnamon than was called for and reducing the sugar for the frosting by 1/2 cup. This cake was devoured in record time.  I will be making another one later this week.  It was so awesome.  I love AllRecipes because they make me look so good!  When friends and family are gushing with delight over the goodies that I make I give a secret thanks to you AllRecipes!

So, I made this without realizing that I had made this recipe before exactly as written and didn't really care for it. But this time just by chance I made the changes recommended by one reviewer (gneebeanie). MUCH better!! Took it to a dinner party and everyone loved it! Thanks, gneebeanie!

Original Review:
I was not impressed. I've made much better carrot cake recipes. The flavour was on the bland side - I think it needs much more spice (more cinnamon, some nutmeg or cloves). It was just OK.

the frosting is especially good.  I need to find a substitution for all the oil and butter.  Will try maybe banana or yogurt.

After reading a few reviews, I substituted 1 cup oil for apple sauce (used only 1/4 cup oil), reduced the sugar to 1 cup (instead of 2), doubled the vanilla and cinnamon, added some nutmeg and passed on the icing.  Not only was it perfect, one of the best tasting carrot cakes ever, per piece (18 servings), the calories were reduced from 500+ to less than 200!  Now that's sweet!!

Yup. This was really, really good. I brought this for Easter dinner at my sisters. The next day she phoned me and asked for the recipe and then said that it's the kind of cake she'd pay to have a slice of. My alterations: I used the 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce combo as suggested. I also used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown as was also suggested. I used walnuts instead of pecans and I added a tsp. of allspice. For the icing, I only used 3 cups of icing sugar. Again, that was another suggestion by another user. I'm actually going to make it again today for Easter dinner with the in-laws - it was that good. Thanks for a great recipe!

I forgot how much I loved cake batter. There were some modifications, mostly based on other reviewer's suggestions which are summarized nicely at the top. I did muffins because they are portable and easier for groups, read: my coworkers. This makes about 28 muffins - bake at 30 min and use the muffin pan liners. Muffin makers also note you can cut the icing in half if you make muffins. Pineapple may have been too juicy for muffins but overall this was moist and lightly sweet and spiced. Thanks!

I did what others suggested and used 3/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce. I kept everything else the same. It was a perfectly texture cake. A real carrot cake as opposed to a carrot muffin or morning glory muffin. Richly flavored and wonderful even without frosting.

I found this recipe when searching for one that didn't need pineapple or raisins (which I didn't have). This is a wonderful, moist cake and the frosting is decadent. A great alternative to my usual recipe.

Oooops!  I wrote a review for this recipe and after I had posted it I realized that I reviewed the wrong recipe.  I did Not serve this with crusty bread and grated cheddar.  This carrot cake was excellent!  I used 2 round pans and made it as a double layer cake.  I substituted 1/2c apple sauce in place of 1/2c oil.  Cooked them for about 25 min. until knife came out clean.  There was enough frosting to put between the layers.  Will definately make this again.

This was so good! I made a 4 layer cake for my moms birthday. It held together well and the icing was amazing. I didn't put pecans in the batter....only around the outside of the cake. I also dyed the frosting lavender. Great recipe!

This is a great recipe...very light and yet moist too! I usually make Sam's Carrot Cake from this site (which is also awesome), but did not have pineapple, so I made this one instead. I am glad I did. (Oh and I too used 1/2 cup of applesauce instead of all the oil)

Excellent cake!  No problems with the cake falling; it had a wonderful texture.  I used the smallest holes to grate the carrot and had no problems with liquid.  I only used about 2 3/4 cups sugar in the frosting and it was delicious.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!!

This was my first attempt at Carrot Cake and it was great!  I toasted the pecans for the icing and sprinkled them on top instead of mixing them in the icing.  I may never have to buy carrot cake from the store ever again!

I made this recipe twice, once exactly as is, and once with the changes other reviews suggested.  It was pretty much the same both ways, except the second time you could notice the extra spices, which was nice.  Either way, just an average recipe.  I've had just as good or better results adding carrots and nuts to a boxed spice cake mix.

I made half batch for 10 muffins. Baked for 22 mins. They were moist & yummy. No cream cheese on hand, used peanut butter frosting from this site. Good. Followup: Made this again. This time I used 3/4c white & 1/2c brown sugar to subs. 2c white sugar. For the frosting, 1 & 3/4c icing sugar is sweet enough for my taste. As another viewer mentioned, I add 1 tbsp lemon juice to the frosting. It balances the sweetness and bring up more flavor. Baked 6 Xlarge and 10 large in one batch.

This was a very very good recipe, I took the recommendations of other reviewers and it came out so good! Although the posted recipe probably would have been just as good this was awesome. I brought it over to our church Valentines party and it was gone, no seconds and everyone kept complimenting the cake and frosting! You will not be disappointed with this recipe!

This is such a moist cake!  The only thing I did differently was to add more spices like nutmeg, cloves, and a little more cinnamon.  It smelled wonderful baking in the oven.  Instead of baking in a 9x13 dish, I made 2 small 8" cakes and placed a cheesecake layer in the middle.  My friends love this "carrot cake cheesecake" combination.  After all, what better combo than carrot cake and cream cheese?!?!? Makes a nice presentation too.  UPDATE: Made this again, and a friend who hates carrot cake actually enjoyed this one.  Go figure!

For GF diet folks: I substituted a packaged gluten-free flour mix plus 1/2 t. xanthan gum for the flour but otherwise followed the recipe. Everyone at the party said this was, hands-down, the best carrot cake they ever had.

made the following changes: 50% olive oil and 50% applesauce, 1C wht sugar and 1C brn sugar, 3 tsp vanilla, 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup pastry/cake flour, 3 tsp cinnamon, added in a can of pineapples, and only 1/2 cup of pecans. I bake for 45min and it was just right. came out moist and delicious! i made 1/2 the frosting but i dont think this recipe really needs it...it's sweet enough as is. i think next time i might cut down on the sugar even more. i will definitely be making this again! thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best carrot cake on the face of this planet - who knew it was so simple to make such delicious carrot cake when the stores charge you an arm and a leg! The entire family loved it and stuffed it into their bellies after a huge dinner. Thank you so much!

I read that this is the rock star of carrot cakes so I just had to try it.  It was superb.  I also added the recommendations of nutmeg and pineapple - super moist and perfect taste.  I really wish I hadn't added the frosting because it is more delicious on it's own merits.

Gorgeous!! No wonder it's the best-rated carrot cake recipe on this site. Ever since my first taste of carrot cake at an exclusive bakery I've tried to find a recipe that yields the same magic...and here it is! I've made this cake a few times now - even in a ring cake tin - and it impresses every time. Stick to the recipe 'as is'...you won't go wrong. Although I did have to bake mine a little longer with some aluminium foil on top (to prevent burning), but that's because my oven has seen better days and tends to be unreliable and heats unevenly.

UPDATE: though I said it's a great recipe 'as is', I've tried it with toasted walnuts (skin blanched off) and nutmeg as suggested by many others (for me nutmeg is a must in a carrot cake) and the taste just gets better. Hmm...I drool just thinking of this cake. Makes me wanna open my own carrot cake shop!!

This was absolutely fantastic! As suggested by previous reviewers, I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg for additional flavor. I also subsituted walnuts for pecans and added an 8 oz. can of drained crushed pineapple. I don't have a grater or a food processor so I chopped up several carrots and used the "Grind" option on my blender. 
I made two round cakes with it, but take heed to the fact that if you're using round cake pans, 35 minutes in the oven should be enough. I baked mine for 45 min and the tops came out slightly burned. Despite that, the cake was still moist and delicious. Another problem I had was with the frosting. It was way too sweet, so I would suggest cutting the confectioner's sugar down to three cups. Otherwise, I would definitely reccommend this to everyone!

I read some reviews and made the proposed changes: substituted some oil for apple sauce, added extra cinnamon and nutmeg, used brown and white sugar.  I still found that although the cake was moist, it still lacked flavor.  I may try the recipe again using pineapple as well, but I'm leaning more towards finding a new recipe all together.

I have made this several times.  Made exactly to specifications, it is very very good.  After reading the reviews, I made the following changes, which we now prefer:  (1) use 1 cup white and 1 cup dark brown sugar; (2) add a little extra vanilla; (3) add some rehydrated raisins (maybe 3/4 cup); and (4) add 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  These are not required, but we like it even better with these changes.

This recipe was great! My dad has a insatiable sweet tooth, and carrot cake is his favorite desert. I've been trying to find a good recipe for years, but they'd either come out too dry or too wet. And the ones that did come out relatively okay weren't up to par with my dad discerning palate. This one, with a few personal adjustments of mine, has turned out to be a favorite. So much so that my dad, who rarely bakes, asked me for the recipe. Believe me, that is not a small compliment. Anyway, the adjustments I made are: 1 c white sugar/1 c light brown sugar. I reduced the oil to 1 c(2 sticks), and instead used real, unsalted butter. Not necessarily the healthy choice, but it does make for a nice flavor. Also, added 2 tsp nutmeg, just for that extra bite of spice. With or without my adjustments, this cake is still wonderful. I will be using both versions for years to come! Thanks so much for sharing this with all of us!!!

If I could give this one 6 stars I would!  It is EXCELLENT...my husband is a firefighter and the guys love it when I bring this down for them to snack on.  The only thing I do different is I add about 1/8 cup syrup (whatever kind I have) to the batter and blend it up prior to putting it in the dish-an idea from another recipe.  I also add about 1.5 tbsp to the frosting.  Makes it earn that extra star.  I have made this a few times-to die for!

Incredible recipe. The icing is so good, especially if you reduce the sugar by a cup to bring out the cheese flavor. I'll be making this icing for other cakes too.

Great recipe!! I followed the altered recipe from another reviewer and the cake turned out perfect. Next time I will use about 1 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar in the frosting since friends/family said it was a little sweet.

Very good.  Not quite as dense as I recall carrot cakes...but very good.  I cut the sugar in the cake to one cup white and one-half cup brown to cut carbs, and also cut the sugar in the frosting to three cups, just because the frosting was the right consistency at three cups.  Did not use nuts due to allergies.

After all of the rave reviews, I was really disappointed by this recipe. I love sweet things but even though I followed others' suggestions and decreased the powdered sugar in the frosting recipe by 1/2 cup, it was still way too sweet. I ended up having to add more cream cheese and butter to cut the sweetness. The cake itself was moist and good tasting, but you really couldn't taste the carrots much. It just tasted like spice cake.

This is by far the BEST carrot cake recipe I've ever tried.  I've made it a dozen times in the past few months and everyone raves about it.  Moist, not heavy like most.  I add a teaspoon of nutmeg and a bit extra cinnamon, and scale back on the confectioners sugar in the icing.  Try this recipe...you won't regret it!!

Good LORD! This was amazing!  My sister requested a carrot cake for her 20th b-day so I searched for a recipe, and this ended up being the winning entry:) My first attempt at a carrot cake ever, and as a professional pastry chef I must say I was mighty impressed!  Very moist, the frosting was to die for and just yum.  I will note that I omitted the pecans in the frosting, those in the cake were nutty enough for us, and also if you DON'T like a really thick frosting, scale it down accordingly because you get a nice thick lawn of cream cheese frosting here!  Also the 18 portions in the original recipe are more than generous, so if you intend on feeding a smaller crowd I would consider scaling down.  Thanks!

Five stars for the cake itself!!! I'd probably only give it four stars if this was just the icing recipe-it was waaaay too sweet-but the cake was delicious. Next time I'm considering simply using a light sugar glaze instead of all-out frosting.

Excellent.  I made it exactly as written - I agree with another reviewer that you can't rate a recipe if you've made changes to it because it's not the same recipe.  It turned out wonderful and is nice and moist.  There is more than enough icing however and it could probably have been halfed.  Thank you!

Great recipe! I followed the recipe ingredient for ingredient except when it came to the carrots. I added 1 c. of pineapple with juice and 2 cups of carrot (instead of 3 c. carrot) which my mom always did in her carrot cake. Delicious!

The cake was okay, but not the best.  I would take out a cup or two of batter, so you will not have to cook it too long to cook the middle.  You can make cupcakes with the extra batter.  I will try another recipe next time.

I divided this recipe into 2 round cake pans and then made double icing (not adding as much icing sugar as called for) and made a layer cake!!  It is so beautiful..who wants to eat it! yeah right!! I did as recomended by others and added nutmeg and did half brown and white sugars. I also grated fresh nutmeg on top as a garnish!

This recipe is a great way to start! I made my first Carrot Cake a few days ago. I started with the recipe, read the other reviewers' alterations and came up with my own variant. Instead of using so much oil, I substituted 1/2 cup oil and 1/2 cup fresh chopped apples. I also threw in about 1/2 cup crushed pineapple. I used 1 Tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 tablespoon of vanilla (instead of two teaspoons each.) I used half white sugar and half brown sugar. I added a small handful of flaked coconut to the cake ingredients. For the frosting, I omitted the nuts, and I added the zest from one lemon instead. I received rave reviews and many requests for the recipe. I can't say my variant qualifies as a new recipe altogether because I did start with the Carrot Cake III recipe here. Thanks for the help!

this recipe was just awesome.  First time I ever did carrot cake and my husband who is very blunt about his comments loved it.  I followed the suggestions of most of the reviewers, I added extra cinammon and extra vanilla.  i used half a cup of applesauce and a stick of butter(i had an accident and the bowl i was using broke so I lost the canol oil that I had in it and it was the last I had.) i am going to make this recipe again tomorrow with some of the other recommendations.  i am not sure if it can taste any better but I am striving for perfection.

This was a simple cake to make and is absolutely delicious!  I followed some of the previous suggestions and did the following:
(1) Used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar
(2) Added 1/4 tsp nutmeg
(3) Added an additional 1 tsp vanilla
(4) Added 8oz drained crushed pineapple.
I hand-grated the carrots for large slices.  I also purchased a jar of ready-made Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting to hurry the process!
I suggest frosting the pieces as you serve them, so you don't have leftover cake with the cream cheese frosting sitting on it.  Then you can store the frosting in the fridge and frost as you eat for a fresher taste.  Enjoy!

Very good recipe. The icing, however, is too sweet. I used only 2 1/2 cups of sugar, instead of 4, but it was still too much. Next time I will use 2 cups tops.

Thank you!

SUPERB CAKE!  I made this using the recommended changes:  used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, added 1/2 t nutmeg, added 1 c pineapple, added 1 c raisins, made in bundt pan (350 degrees, 50 min) and topped with cream cheese glaze, cinnamon sugar and chopped pecans. Cake was dense, full-bodied and very flavorful.  Family and co-workers fought over it!  Thanks for both the original recipe and all of the recommended revisions - you can't go wrong with any of them.

With the substitutions given from the member below it was the best carrot I have ever had. My fiance's family loved it so much, they are requesting it for  birthdays now.

These simple modifications make a huge difference in the overall outcome of the cake. 

•3/4 cups canola oil 
•2 cups sugar (1 cup white, 1 cup brown)
•3 teaspoons vanilla extract
•¼ teaspoon nutmeg 
•½ cup apple sauce
•1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple

I would also recommend only using 3.5 cups of sugar for the frosting because 4 cups seemed a bit too sweet for my preference.

It came out superb, but too sweet for my tooth. Next time to reduce sugar in frosting and main ingredients, reduce cinnamon to 1 1/2t, vegetable oil tp 1 cup, baking soda to 1 1/2t, otherwise it was a great! The family loved it. Will definately do it again soon!

Awesome! My husband doesn't usually eat sweets, he ate half of the cake! 
Yum-ola! I didn't have any nutmeg on hand so i left it out and substituted apple sauce for oil, like so viewers recommended, so delicious and you can't even tell!

I followed recipe fairly close except for a few add-ins of raisin, coconut and nutmeg.  I think this was a really good recipe, but mine was a tad dry.  I only baked it for 43 minutes.  It's always hard when you have a gap of 10 minutes to decide if it's ready.  next time I will try with the pineapple... Seems like people get good results with it!  Marvelous frosting; I only used 3 cups of the powder sugar.  Taste best cold from the fridge!

I lost my grandmother's (excellent) carrot cake recipe, so was looking for a good one to make for my boyfriend's b'day/family cookout.  Because of the rave reviews, I tried this recipe.  Imagine my horror when I realize I'd forgotten the baking soda, after it had been in the oven too long to do anything about it--yikes!  No choice but to serve it anyway, and it got nothing but RAVE reviews.  I've had several requests for the recipe (have said baking soda is optional! :) and will make this again...and again...and again!   Absolutely delicious.

Y-U-M!!!  I made a recipe a few years ago that everyone LOVED, and then I lost the recipe!  I think this may have been it, and with the changes that everyone suggested, it was the best I've ever had!  Made 4 small cakes for a friend to have; they froze great and tasted just as good once they were defrosted!!

This was the best cake ever.  I got tired of grating carrots and just got out the blender.  The blender chopped it, but made carrot juice as well.  I just poured it all in.  The cake was really moist.  It did take a little longer to get done, maybe because of the extra liquid.  I will make it again and again!

Good carrot cake recipe - I like a spicy carrot cake so I added another 1/4 t. of allspice, ground clove, nutmeg and ginger as well as an extra t. of cinnamon.  It is a little bland without these additions.  I also exchanged half of the oil for applesauce to make it a little healthier.

I love, love, love this recipe. I make it all the time and get so many compliments--it is my specialty. However, none of my success would be possible without gneebeanie's changes... they make the cake incredible. I have made layer cakes as well as cupcakes with this recipe, and every time they come out moist and flavorful. I bake the cupcakes for 25 mins and the cake for 35-40. The frosting is amazing as well. Perfect recipe; thanks!

This carrot cake is the best I have EVER had by far. I have tried many from different restaurants and bakeries, and I was always turned off by the overly sweet frosting, with the lack of cream cheese taste, or by the dryness of the cake. This one was excellent! Extremely moist, dense and delicious! I followed the suggestions posted by the previous reviewers, but I did omit the pineapple. I think it was fantastic without it. I also cut the confectioner's sugar down to 2.5 to 2 3/4 cups, and it was perfectly sweet, with the cream cheese shining through. This cake is also so easy to make! My whole family loved it, even self proclaimed "non-likers" of carrot cake. Thanks for the recipe.

Phenomenal recipe. I used this for my boyfriend's birthday because he loves carrot cake. He raved to his family about how I make a great carrot cake! Thank you!

This carrot cake was good and the frosting was creamy, sweet, and delicious. However,the next time i make this cake I am going to continually check the carrot cake while cooking because i left mine in for 40 minutes and if i left it in there a little longer it would be on the verge of burning. It kinda had a sinkhole in the middle, but with extra frosting nobody noticed. I'm not sure if I'll make it again. I tried carrot cake for the first time a few years ago and this cake doesn't quite match that one, but for my first attempt to make it homemade by myself pretty good.Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was wonderful and so easy to make. My eight year old daughter made it exactly as it was written (minus the pecans). It was moist and delicious. We did cheat and use a tub of store bought frosting because we didn't have the ingredients to make our own but it was so good anyways. She is so proud of herself and cannot wait to make another. Thank you!!

This was much too greasy for me, it almost tasted "fried" around the edges. It would probably be better made with applesauce.

This cake was amazing!  I've never made carrot cake and I certainly chose the best recipe.  I followed exactly except omitted the nuts both in the cake and frosting.  Even my picky son liked it!  Thanks for a great recipe!  I'll make again and again.

Delish!  Omitted the topping because we don't like it too sweet. It was great all by itself.  Will make again.

I made this for Father's Day and it was such a huge hit that I just made it again for my mom's bday.  I made the following modifications:  Used 1/2 brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar, added applesauce, crushed pineapple, nutmeg, raisins and walnuts. Also increased the amount of vanilla and cinnamon.  I halved the recipe each time.  Perfect.  Amazing carrot cake.

I made this cake for my mother-in-law and her birthday.  It was a hit!  Very moist and not overly spicy; the frosting compliments it very well (I only used 3 cups confectioners' sugar).  I really missed the pecans and will more than likely use them the next time I make this cake...I had left them out because my six year old has a strong aversion to nuts.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This turns out perfect every single time I make it. I add a little more cinnamon and vanilla. Best carrot cake recipe out there, no joke. 

Trust me on this on ethough: Lemon cream cheese frosting and carrot cake = DIVINE.

I just made this cake for a leaving party at work yesterday! Excellent! Went down a treat!
I took some of the advice and used only 1 cup of oil.. Amazing!
I used creme fraiche instead of cream cheese and i only used 1/2 cup of sugar, which i melted in the butter and whisked the butter and sugar mixture while it was cooling. Went into a lovely smooth butterry sauce! I then added this to the creme fraiche and then let it harden in the fridge for 30-50 mins!

Great recipe thanks!

I've made this cake twice now, following gneebeanie's recommendations (except the crushed pineapple) - and it is a fabulously dense and flavourful cake. The cream cheese frosting II is perfect with it. 
I would highly recommend using the right pan -at least a 9 X 13" - so that the cake can cook evenly.

THIS WAS AWESOME!!!! I went by some of the suggestions of cutting back 1/4C of oil but adding 1 8oz can of crushed pineapple. Worked soo well.  HAd great taste. I dont think it wouldve hurt it either with the extra 1/4 cup of oil, just would have made it more moist.  The frosting was good, but I only needed 2 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar.  GREAT RECIPE!!!THANKS

Very good.  I used 3/4 cup vegetable oil and increased the grated carrots to 3 1/2 cups (I didn't have any applesauce!).  I decreased the sugar to 1.5 cups and used all brown sugar.  I also added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon.  I got a very moist, delicious cake!  Next time I will add in some nutmeg as well.  This freezes very well.  Right now I've got some bite size pieces in my fridge!

Oh My yum.. Sinfully devine. There is nothing more that I can say but perfect. It is moist, not to rich with no touch ups and no add ins. Perfect recipe. Will make this recipe over and over again.. I feel better about making this cake other than other cakes cause I am getting my vegetables too. Ha!

The original recipe was way too sweet for my liking so I cut the sugar by 1/2 cup. It was also too oily so I substituted 1/2 cup of oil with low-fat milk. The end result was a fluffy, moist and flavorful cake. Very delicious and smells wonderful! It's quick and easy to make too.

This was a great recipe to follow, I made a few alterations similar to other readers... 3/4c oil & 3/4c apple sauce, 1c white sugar & 1c brown sugar, extra tsp of vanilla and cinnamon, 1 1/2c finely chopped pecans and lke other readers I used the cheese grater method for shredding my carrots. With the frosting I doubled the recipe since I was making a volcono and needed to ice between 4 layers. I only used 5c powdered sugar though, so that would be 2.5 for a normal cake and it was plenty sweet. 
I loved this carrot cake and so did everyone who ate it at the party I took it to, even my boyfriend who had never liked carrot cake! I made this into a volcano shape using a bundt pan, pyrex bowl, and cupcakes for a coupls that was getting married on a volcano in 
Hawaii.

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and substituted 3/4c applesauce + 1/2c oil, and 3/4c white sugar + 1/2c brown sugar. I also added in 1/4tsp of nutmeg, and a dash each of ground ginger and cloves. The result was a moist, flavorful cake, but I think because I tried to split the recipe into two, 9-inch round pans I had issues that I wouldn't have using a 13x9 baking pan. First of all, the batter is NOT enough to make two round cakes. Also, it took far less than the 40-50 minutes called for in the recipe. I checked it after just 25 minutes, and the edges of my cake were burnt.

So, double the recipe if you want to make a layer cake, and check it before half the recommended time has elapsed. Other than that, great texture and flavor and I'll definitely make it again with the alterations.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I didn't add the nuts to the frosting (didin't seem necessary since the cake has nuts in it).  The result was really nice... a very rich, moist cake that everyone enjoyed.  But, beware, it is really heavy and loaded with fat.

with a few added suggestions from the users below, such as walnuts rather than pecans, half powdered sugar, and crushed pineapple, it was the best carrot cake I've ever had.

!/2 Brown sugar, 1/2 white; extra t of vanilla and of cinnamon, and I made without nuts- this is a fantastic recipe, don't think I will ever need another one for carrot cake.  It is moist and soft and delicately flavored.  It's even quite nice for tea without the frosting.  Wonderful.

Have to agree with everyone else. This cake is awesome! It was moist and flavoursome. I was out of pecans and so used walnuts instead but otherwise didn't change a thing. This will be my carrot cake recipe from now on.

I am not a huge fan of carrot cake. I made this for my bf who is always begging for anything not chocolate.  I used the suggestions from gneebeanie and it turned out amazing.  Initially, I had just a tiny piece, but had to back for more.  This recipe made me a carrot cake lover, thank you!

Delicious!  Baked cake in two 8" round pans. I too used 1/2 cup white, 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Added 8 ounces of crushed pineapple, and a dash of nutmeg.  Didn't add pecans to the cream cheese frosting, used them to decorate the sides of the cake.  Don't forget to add a thin-medium layer of cream cheese in between the layers.

no one in my imediate family likes carrot cake, It is, however, my brother's favorite, so for his birthday, I made this recipe, and took it to him. Since I had a little extra batter, I made a small cake for us. Needless to say, we all have changed our minds about carrot cake. My husband, who complained about the perfect waste of ingredients when he saw me baking the cake, finished ours off the first day, and asked for more.

Yay!  This was my first carrot cake recipe and I don't think I need to try any others.  I did walnuts (finely diced) instead of pecans, a bit less than a cup, and I also added some shredded coconut (not sure how much, until it tasted right) which really adds some nice flavor.

This recipe is the greatest, with the adaptations by gneebeanie.  I applied all of them, but did add raisins also, because I like them.  Great raves by one and all

I made some of the changes that were suggested by others - replaced 1/2 cup oil with apple sauce and added nutmeg. (I can't imagine this cake without nutmeg). Also, I used only 2cups of confectioners' sugar for the frosting. I actually ran out, but I'm glad I did. The frosting was more than sweet enough. My family absolutely loved it, including my father, the chef of the family.

Made this 3 times.  The first time in a 9 x 13 pan and it turned out great.  The second time I made it in 6 inch pans and it was a disaster.  I thought the cakes were done because the toothpick came out clean and they sprung back when touched.  As soon as they were out of the oven, they started to sink.  When I tried to turn one of the cakes out, it ripped and you could see the middle of the cake was still completely raw.  Dumped the cake back in the pan, put all the cakes back in the oven and let them cook for at least another 20 minutes.  In the end I couldn't use them for the birthday cake I was planning because they looked so horrible.  But my husband was very happy because even though they were a wreck, it still tasted really good.  I tried again today and was meticulous with every step & ingredient.  I baked them 10 minuted longer than I thought I should before I even tested them.  This time I did an internal temp and made sure it was at least 190 degrees.  Once I took them out, I said a prayer and walked away for 15 minutes.  When I came back one sunk just a tiny bit and both came out of the pan well.  I think I finally have usable cake for the birthday party.  In the end I would give this recipe 3 1/2 stars.  Flavor is great but the recipe may be a bit temperamental.

This is the BEST carrot cake!!! Hubby LOVES it.  I halved the recipe and used a 9" round pan - just right for the two of us! I've also made the double layer 9" round.  It never lasts long at our house!

This was the best carrot cake I've had, the only thing I changed was the sugar. I used one cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and I baked it in two 9" round pans for the shortest recommended time. Because of other reviews I cut back on the sugar for the icing. I used 3 cups powdered sugar. It was perfect, it had the right amount of sweetness combined with the cream cheese. Mmmmmmmm!

Great Recipe!  Like others, I substituted some of the oil for apple sauce and added a can of pinneaple.  I used a round spring form pan and it took me quite a while for the middle to cook-maybe close to 1 hour.  I was worried that because of the length of time, it wasn't going to taste that great, but I was wrong.  I took the cake to a dinner party and it got rave reviews.  Many people asked for the recipe.  I definitely will make this one again.

An excellent recipe, very moist and delicious.  I used half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour and also added 1 tsp of nutmeg.  I baked it in a bundt pan and it came out perfect.  Based on others' suggestions, I reduced the icing sugar in the frosting to three cups.

This was an awesome cake!  I loved it, super simple to make, my husband loved it, and had no idea what was in it, since he always claimed he hated carrot cake.....right......and the 3 little ones loved it too.  I did alter it after reading the reviews, and used 3/4c oil, 1/2c applesauce, added an extra tsp of both the vanilla and cinnamon.  For some reason it did dip in the middle when it came out, but who cares, it was AWESOME!  For the icing I used only about 3cups or even a little less than that with the powdered sugar.  Thanks, this is for sure a lifetime keeper!!!

It was so moist! I will use this recipe over, and over again!!!

This carrot cake is wonderful. Follow gneebeanie's list and it will turn out perfect. However, I did use walnuts instead of pecans. I baked in two 9" cake pans for about 30-40 minutes. You will not be disappointed. I can't wait to make another one.

Yummy!  This was delicious and my dear boss loved it so much she asked for the recipe.  I did follow other's suggestions by using only 1/2 c of oil and 1/2 c of applesauce.  Otherwise everything else was the same.  Everyone was super impressed by the substitution and say it made it even more appealing!  Thanks for helping me impress.

My five year old son won't eat anything these days.  He loves this!  The only change I made to it was adding a 1/2 cup of mini-chocolate chips.  A half cup is not much, just enough to let him think he is getting away with eating "chocolate"!!!

OMG! This was a total hit with friends and family - they said that this was the best cake they ever had.  However, I did do some improvising like a few others did.  I put one cup brown sugar and 1 cup sugar.  I did use 8 oz. crushed pineapple. (get most of the juice out) and added 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  I did bake in (2) 9 inch cake pans and baked for around 20 minutes or till toothpick comes out clean.  I did also use a cream cheese frosting recipe that I have which was also a huge hit.  Any cream cheese frosting recipe will do.  I sell cakes on the side and this one will definately be a hit!

Awesome.  I made this for my fiancé's birthday.  I don't really even care for carrot cake and I thought it was delicious.  I used most of the other reviewers' alterations, except I left out the pineapple.  I also used only 3 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting and it was plenty sweet.  I also left the nuts out of the frosting.

I've made this carrot cake a few times over the last year and it came out AMAZING the very first time I made it. I made it with no adjustments aside from leaving out the pecans (in case of allergies). It's been a hit at every BBQ and work event (and been highly requested)! Great recipe Tammy. Thanks!

5 stars for flavour, but it needs alteration.  CUT THE OIL to 1 cup or less.  Mine had oil on the bottom.  You can also get by with half the amount of icing.

My husband is a carrot cake junkie and this is the best-ever.  I used some other posters' suggestions as follows: 1/2 c applesauce and 3/4 c Canola, used Brown Sugar (cake only), 3 t Vanilla Extract,3 t Ground Cinnamon,8oz Crushed pineapple drained very well and I didnt use the suggestion of 1/4 Nutmeg but I did give 3-4 good shakes of Pumpkin Pie Spice.  The frosting was to die for by using 16oz Cream Cheese and start slowly with the Confectoners Sugar, I used about 1/4 Cup- but add slowly and taste along the way to get it right- it is the crown on this incredible treat!

yes, this cake was delicious.  i made it for my husband's birthday and everyone loved it.  i don't usually like carrot cake at all, but i liked this.  i used these suggestions from other reviews:  half white, half brown sugar; 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of full amount of oil; only about 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting.  i had lots of frosting left over, but my husband says i didn't put enough on the cake and has been putting the extra on each individual piece he eats!  this recipe does have a lot of nuts, so if you aren't a big fan of them, you should probably cut back on the pecans in the cake and the frosting.  i really liked them, though.  thanks a bunch for this recipe!

This was the best recipe ever.  All I did was substitute the sugar with brown sugar, used 1 cup whole wheat flour with a tad bit of rye flour, used only applesauce for the oil, used 3 1/2 cups carrots and one jar baby food carrots, toasted walnuts with a mix of pecans, added a can of crushed pineapple (don't forget to drain the juice!), added one cup of golden raisins, two teaspoons of imported cinnamon and madagascar bourbon vanilla.  For the frosting I used low-fat cream cheese, real butter, Pastry Pride and powdered sugar with the madagascar bourbon vanilla.  The results were AMAZING!!  I would make this recipe again and again!!!!

I made half the recipe and baked it in a 9 inch springform pan.  Iced it with Cream Cheese Frosting II ~ it was exceptionally good.  Will definitely make again, thank you.

I was a bit apprehensive when I read some of the (really) negative comments here. This is my first time making a carrot cake, and I wanted sth that works.

Nonetheless, I went ahead n chose this recipe because of all the good reviews it received. I used all the most popular modifications suggested here & made my first ever carrot cake.

And voila! The cake definitely tasted great, but the texture was a bit off (only slightly dry) and the sides were kinda hard (slightly, but definitely noticeable). But the taste, NO REGRETS. 

So I decided to give it another try and tried to figure out what went wrong. My second time, I decided to be bold (perhaps stupid?) and decided to bake three more carrot cakes for the party I was throwing. So folks, this is what i've discovered (those of u who r already experts need not read hehe):

1) Use the 1/1 cup white/brown sugar as recommended. Don't reduce it.

2) When they say squeeze out the pineapple juice, don't do what I did - I actually really, really squeezed 'em dry. I placed the pineapple cubes in a kitchen towel and squeeze 'em till I was only left with the fibers. A waste of my time and energy. It's ok to have some moisture left in them. 

3) If you're using 9" square (read: not rectangle) pans, use deep pans instead of shallow ones because with this recipe's portion, it bakes better. 

4) My own modification - I used less than 1/2 c applesauce coz I was running out on my 2nd and 3rd cakes (yes, i mixed them separately because i wanted

This is one of the top carrot cake recipes out here. I used 1/2 of applesauce and 1/3 cup of canola oil as many of you have recommended. The only critic I had from a person who tried it was that it tasted too cinamony, but I personally though it tasted great and so did the other 15 people there.

OMG!!!! AWESOME RECIPE! The entire cake flew off the platter in a matter of seconds! I had people mad at me because there wasn't enough to go around the 2nd time! I did add about 1 cup of sunmaid raisin & cranberry mix also 1 small can of dole crushed pineapple (juice included) that made it so soft & juicy! GREAT recipe that will be made over & over again by me!!! LOVED it! Thanks again! ;-)

Absolutely the best carrot cake of all time.  Now the favorite birthday cake of my college kids.  (I did not alter the recipe at all except to exclude the nuts.) You can't go wrong with this recipe!

My boyfriend said I should give this recipe seven stars.  It's the best carrot cake we've ever had.  I made a few changes:  I used whole wheat flour, which worked great.  I added 8 ounces of squeezed-dry crushed pineapple and omitted the pecans.  I used 3/4 c oil and 2/3 c applesauce.  I used about 3 c sugar in the frosting and reduced fat cream cheese (not fat free).  I also used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar. And since I used organic carrots, I didn't peel them.   I froze some and it thawed well.  Wonderful recipe.

This is a very tasty cake. The frosting has way too much sugar as stated, and I suggest that you use less (taste test as you go). I also used cake flour instead of AP, applesauce for 1/3 of the oil, and sultana raisins for half of the nuts--the combination was superb.

This recipe is great.  I'm embarrassed to say that since I only had reosmary flavored olive oil in the house, I substituted melted butter instead of oil.  Well - if you only make cake for special occasions, why not?  It was superb. I was looking for a carrot cake recipe to use for a wedding cake and this is the one.

I found this recipe after trying a failed recipe from a book.  
This was a great recipe to start from.  After reading many reviews, here are the substitutions I made-
part applesauce/part vegetable oil
used cinnamon applesauce
half brown sugar/half white sugar
added 8oz. can of crushed pineapple with part of the juice as needed. I also did not use an electric mixer, which may have been the reason for my first cake failing.  I did divide this batter into 2 9inch rounds. 

This cake was so moist, and delicious.  I can't imagine anyone not liking this cake!

This was my first time making a carrot cake. After reading other reviews i did use 3/4 cup of canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1 1/4 cup of oil.  i don't like cake too sweet so i reduced the sugar to just 1 cup.  Used 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg, 3 cup of confectioner's sugar for the frosting instead of 4.  The cake turned out wonderful. so moist and the cream cheese frosting is to die for.  i might add a bit more carrot next time, but this recipe's a keeper:)

Followed the advice of those on the site and increased cinnamon. Also added a bit of fresh grated nutmeg and ginger. I highly suggest using the 3/4 cup of apple sauce because it doesn't jeopardize flavor or moisture but reduces calories. 2 cups of white sugar also works well, brown is not absolutely needed but I haven't tried the recipe with 1 cup of both. Delicious with or without cream cheese icing.

I used the substitutions/modifications listed in gneebeanie's post and it was fabulous! I made 10 two layer 4x8 cakes to sell at a bake sale. A local coffee shop owner bought 2 and said they were the best carrot cakes she'd ever had! I won't even try another recipe for carrot cake, this one will do for life.

I made this cake following the suggestion of many others using a cup of white and a cup of brown sugar.  My family raved over this cake and I've had numerous requests for it since.  I love the cream cheese icing that goes along with the cake although I usually cut back on the confectioner's sugar since the icing can be a little sweet.

Absolutely Delicious!! I followed the changes other members suggested and now I am hooked! I have never been a big fan of carrot cake, but I decided to give it a try for Easter and it is now going to become an Easter tradition. The cake was so moist and the frosting was incredible! My boyfriend's family kept asking if I had bought the cake from the store, that's how good it was!
Thank you for sharing this yummy yummy recipe!!

I think that this recipe is perfect as is.  Nothing needs to be changed to make a moist delicious cake.  I make my own recipe, which is identical, every Thanksgiving using one can of pumpkin in place of the carrots.  I also make it as a nine inch layer cake so I have more frosting in each bite.  To do this, I generally increase the cream cheese frosting by 1 1/2.  However, I believe it is terrific exactly as written.

I made this recipe as it was listed in my Better Homes & Gardens cookbook, which was exactly the same except it used 3/4 cup oil and  1/2 tsp baking soda. It was the best carrot cake I've ever had, very moist and not too dense. The cream cheese icing is very good too. I don't think it would have been nearly as good without the adjustments I made.

I didn't like it when I tried it straight out of the oven but it tasted great cold and even better with the icing. I also used more carrot than required (1.5 cups more) due to difficulty reading my fading measuring cup.

My husband is a carrot cake afficionado and he thought this recipe was the best he's ever had.  I halved the recipe since it's just the 2 of us and baked it in a bread loaf pan.  Then I sliced it into 3 layers horizontally and frosted between each layer.  I also made a few small changes in the recipe itself.  I used 1-1/2 tsp of cinnamon (instead of 1 tsp), I added 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg and ~1.5-2 Tbsp of diced crystallized ginger.  It turned out great!

Made this as a surprise to cheer up my mother-in-law who loves carrot cake and it was a disaster, I was really upset! It just collapsed in the middle and even after an extra 10 mins- totaling 1 hour in the oven it was still a lump of goo. I showed my mother-in-law and she said it needed to be cooked at a lower temperature for longer. Very disappointed :(

I followed the cake recipe exactly and left out the nuts for the frosting and it came out great! I served it with vanilla ice cream and the 2 together went perfectly! I served it for a birthday at work and people have been talking about it all down the halls, days after the party. Everyone loved it and said it was the best carrot cake they have had! It was my first time making carrot cake too!

I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and replaced half the oil with applesauce. The cake turned out light and moist. The It did need a longer cooking time than stated (we halved the recipe and had to cook it for 70minutes). My only complaint is that the texture was a bit rubbery at the bottom of the cake but I have had this problem with cake recipes before. I am a novice baker so it could just be something I am doing wrong.

I used this recipe for my mother's 92nd birthday party. One of the best things about the recipe is that it is very easy to "customize" and still come out with a great tasting product. I grated a bunch of carrots and when all was said and done I had 4 cups instead of 3 but I put them all in. Like others have suggested, I substituted unsweetened applesauce for some of the oil. I also put in about a cup of raisins instead of the nuts. It was fabulous!! Dense, super moist but not oily. Even my 11 year old grandson who said that he didn't like carrot cake decided to try a little piece. He gave it 2 thumbs up and requested seconds. The old carrot cake recipe I had has been thrown away. This is a keeper. I also used the recipe for the frosting, but I only put in 3 cups of powdered sugar and not 4 and it tasted perfect, sweet but not too sweet.

This deserves more than just 5 stars!  I had never made a carrot cake before, decided I'd try it out on my family.  We all really enjoyed it.  My grandmother couldn't stop complimenting me on it.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I just made this recipe for a party I am going to tonight but I put a bit of the batter in a tiny pan so that I could try it so I know it's okay and also so my kids could have a taste!

My kids loved it and I loved it too.  I followed the suggestions of greenbean I think the reviewer was?

Next time I think I will add even more nutmeg than 1/4 tsp and add some ginger as well.

It was light and yummy and very good but not necessarily the spiciest carrot cake I've had, even with the extra 1 tsp of cinnamon and bit of nutmeg added again.

I also was too lazy to make the icing but had bought a container of ready made cream cheese icing that turned out to be too sweet and not cream cheese-like enough for me so I added in a block of light cream cheese and beat it up and with that it was very good.

Next time will try the icing that was with the recipe, was just hoping to save a step this time.

Great Carrot Cake recipe.  Turned out very moist. I added about 1/2 cup of raisins.  Didn't seem right to have carrot cake with no raisins.  The icing was also very good.  Family loved it as well.

The cake tasted awsome, I took the advice of adding applesauce and using less oil and it was delicous! I did have one problem both time I made it the middle sunk in pretty deep, not sure if it's colorado or just because it turned out so moist. Either was it was awsome!

Very moist light cake.  Instead of adding pecans I added some raisins.  I also used a bit less oil and added some crushed pineapple.  It worked out well.

Absolutely amazing carrot cake! First carrot cake I've ever made. Replaced all of the vegetable oil with applesauce (used 1 1/2 cups of applesauce), used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup white flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, and only 2 cups of confectioners' sugar in the frosting. Turned out incredibly moist - 30 minutes in the convection oven was more than enough (would probably check on it around 25 minutes). Had a difficult time getting frosting perfectly smoot, but it was still delicious! Amazing, easy cake!!!

Awesome! Easy to make and great results. I did use 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white instead of 2 white. what a wonderful flavor. I thought a 'from scratch' cake and frosting was out of my league, but as it turns out, this recipe is a no brainer. It will be a keeper in our family.

I've just recently re-discovered the joy of baking and this was the first cake I tried baking in quite a few years- it was amazing! This recipe should be the definition of carrot cake.  I really would recommend to anyone.

I made this and brought it into work, and everyone loved it.  I left out the nuts in the cake and the icing.  I also followed other reviewers recommendation to use much less powedered sugar in the frosting (about 3 cups was plenty) and replace 1/2 the oil with applesauce.  I don't know what it's like with just oil, but with half applesauce it is amazingly moist.

This recipe was phenominal!  I added a cup of raisins, and 1-400g can of crushed pineapple (well drained, with almost no juice), and cooked for 55 mins.  It had a delicious flavour and was moist.  Perfect!

This was a delicious and moist cake, but I missed the fruit. Next time I would add raisens or pineapple. Highly enjoyed!

This was a great recipe. I liked the idea of the pecans in the frosting. I will make this again and again.

Wonderful!!

**update**

I made this Cake in 2006 and again in 2011 (b/c I remembered that I had a perfect Carrot Cake recipe from 5 years prior). Don't change a thing- it's perfect! I hope I get a chance to make it more often!

The best carrot cake ever. Husband loved it.This is in regular demand now. My Husband liked it with all the sugar in the frosting though I would have liked much lesser. Thanks so much.

this cake was fabulous. i made it for easter and everyone loved it!!  very moist and flavorful. i made it in two 8 inch round pans instead of the 9x13 and they came out perfectly.  also, i left out the pecans in the icing and added a few dashes of cinnamon instead.  also, fyi, 3 cups of carrots was about 4 grated.  yum!

I made this cake as a bundt style for Easter and everyone loved it.  I thought it was very light and extremely moist.  The frosting was also delicious and everyone couldn't believe I made it from scratch!
Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

Tasted great but failed utterly at high altitude (approx. 5000 ft.) even though I made all the common high altitude adjustments.  Maybe it would work out better if the oven temperature was higher.  I'll have to try it again sometime when I'm down where the rest of the world lives.

This is one fantastic recipe.  This is the best carrot cake I've ever made.  I put the pecans into the cake rather than into the frosting.   One thing I found was that the frosting was rather thick and I had problems spreading and keeping it on the cake.  When slicing, I found that the frosting lifted off rather easily.  I am going to search for a different frosting recipe for this cake. 
This is absolutely better the 2nd day and it keeps getting better the longer it sits.  Keep it cold in the fridge.  If it lasts long enough .

Perfection!  I made this for the first time for my mom's birthday a few weeks ago.  It turned out so moist and delicious.  The whole thing was eaten up in no time.  My husband has asked me to make it again for his upcoming birthday.  Gladly!

I made this cake for my co-workers yesterday and they absolutely loved it. I had to increase recipe to 27 servings. Seems like a lot but I baked it in 2 parchment lined 9" springform pans for 38 minutes, greased and floured sides.  I used 1 cup veg oil, 3/4 cup applesauce, 1 cup white sugar,  1 1/2 cups lt brown sugar, 2 1/2 Tablespoons Vanilla extract,  2 1/2 Tablespoons ground cinnamon, 3/4 tsp nutmeg, grated orange rind.   For the frosting I increased the  softened cream cheese to 28 ounces. Because of the reviews saying it could use more flavor, I did a little tweaking of this recipe. I had 1 piece left over to take home, and the next day after sitting, it even had more flavor, Awesome!   Lorraine

I had never baked or tried a carrot cake before but I totally fell in love with this recipe (and the result!). And the frosting is great too! I substituted the oil for applesauce, added 1/2 cup sultanas and used a mix of nuts since I didn't have enough pecans and it was great! Thanks for posting this recipe.

I just finished eating this cake 2 hours after I made it.  This is my first time making carrot cake.  I followed the exact recipe except for 2 1/2 cups of icing sugar for the icing.  The apperence was fantastic.  It did not sink in the middle like other reveiwers have said.  I should of read the reveiws before making it cause I found it quite heavy to eat.  I believe it was the amount of oil in the recipe.  It was moist and overall okay.  I will make it many more times and use this recipe as a base.  Thanks Tammy

I haven't done many reviews, but this one is definitely worthy of praise.  I did sub the vegetable oil with applesauce and the cake came out wonderfully!  I made it just last week for a halloween cake walk for my daughter's school and have been hounded by mothers for the recipe ever since!  Great recipe!

This was the first carrot cake recipe I've ever tried and its amazing! The only changes I made were 1/2 cup oil and 3/4 cup apple sauce (instead of the full amt of oil); 1 3/4 cup white sugar; and 3 cups powdered sugar for the frosting. 
This cake is dense and so moist.
I had no idea I could love carrot cake so much! 
I did make the mistake of buying baby carrots cause they were on sale, and after grating the first few its pretty obvious that you definetly want to use full sized carrots!
The frosting recipe that accompanies the cake is the perfect addition.

I made this for hubby's birthday, and everyone loved it!  Really good carrot cake!  I did make some adjustments based on other reviews and it turned out great.  Used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, and then cut down the powdered sugar in the frosting to just 3 cups instead of 4.  That was plenty of sweetness!  Yum!

I have made this recipe at least 10 times and it always comes out perfect. I love a moist, dense carrot cake and this one is really the bomb.  I hate reviewers who change people's recipes and give it bad reviews...but I have to have coconut and pineapple in my carrot cake.  I always add ½ cup crushed pineapple (drain most of the liquid) and ½ cup sweetened coconut.  Thanks for a great recipe Tammy!!!  UPDATE:  After reading all the reviews again I noticed that occasionally my cake does sink a little in the center so I followed several reviewers recommendations and perfection!   #1  I did NOT open the oven door at all and made sure I was preheated to 350.  #2  I did NOT over beat the ingredients, as a matter of fact, I always hand mix this cake (I whisk the wet ingredients and use a wooden spoon to stir/incorporate dry ingredients )as not to introduce a lot of air.  I baked for 40 minutes and the cake is picture perfect.  I also always pulse my carrots in a food processor (after grating them) to make them a little finer because I don't like stringy, big pieces of carrot in my cake.

I made this cake for a few people who love carrot cake.  They all really enjoyed it, but I wasn't ecstatic about it myself.  It tasted great!  But, it just wasn't what I am used to in a carrot cake.  Still, I will probably make it again.  I did make a couple, small, changes - I used walnuts instead of pecans (just my personal preference) and I added another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar to the frosting.  TIP: Cream the butter and cream cheese together in a blender or food processor.  It will make your life so much easier.  Then, once mixed, add the vanilla and powdered sugar by hand.

I love this cake every time I make it and have gotten tons of compliments, but as usual I changed the recipe according to reviews!  I use only 1/2 cup oil but 5 cups of carrots to keep the moisture (works great and much better for you!).  No pecans (I don't like nuts in cakes).  For 1 cup of the all-purpose flour I substitute whole wheat flour.  For 1 cup of the white sugar I use brown sugar instead. And to up the flavor I use 3 teaspoons of vanilla and 3 teaspoons of cinnamon.  Mostly I don't ice the cake but when I do I use the Whipped Cream - Cream Cheese Frosting from this site.  I love to make it in two round or square pans and freeze one for emergencies.

This was the first carrot cake I ever made and it was absolutely declicious.  The only change that I made to the cake recipe was to use walnuts instead of pecans.  I found that a one-pound bag of carrots yielded the three cups of shredded carrots the recipe calls for.  I baked the batter in two 9" round shiny metal cake pans in a convection oven at 325 degrees for 38 minutes.  Instead of using the traditional cream cheese frosting included in this recipe, I followed the advice of a previous reviewer and used the Whipped Cream Cheese frosting recipe from this website.  My guests raved!

Great recipe! I was surprised at how easy it was to make. I followed the suggestions of others and used 1/3 c. applesauce instead of the full amt of oil and only one cup of sugar in the frosting. I also folded in one cup of fresh whipped cream into the frosting because it was a little too dense. I will definitely be making this again!

I live in Taiwan, and I've made this dessert countless times for my Chinese co-workers.  They LOVE it...and they're usually picky about sweets!  I always add raisins and sometimes 1/2 cup of crushed pineapples instead of the pecans, since I can't find those here.

Also, I like to add 2 tbsp. of cinnamon to the frosting.  It's delicious!

Didn't translate well into large muffins.  Was moist but not very flavourful.  Would try again with double the cinnamon and less oil.

This is a good one, for sure. I'm eating it now, without having even waited for the cake to cool! I had to make a few modifications, but even without baking soda and powder, the cake is good. I added raisins, a half teaspoon of allspice and a dash of nutmeg; also doubled the cinnamon and halved the oil, as some others suggested. Also substituted a bit of brown sugar for white, and the cake is still up to par. Hope there's some left for tomorrow!

What can I say about this recipe other than that if you want to blow away your dinner party here it is! The only change I made was that I withheld the nuts from the frosting and added a cup of toasted coconut to the nuts and pressed then into the sides and top of the cake. I then piped the cream cheese in swirls around the top edge. Very pretty presentation and a knock out dessert that went well with our Columbian coffee. I would give this 12 stars if I could.

YUMMY! YUMMY! YUMMY! My family and I absolutely loved loved it. I'm not a baker, but I love to bake! This recipe was so easy and simple.  However the middle of my cake collapsed too as some reviewers mentioned, but it wasn't too bad. It tasted so good, no one even noticed. I substituted walnuts for the pecans and it was great! We finished it in one night and I just had to make another one the next day because I was craving it so bad!! Thanks! This is a keeper!

This cake was so good! My first carrot cake. I made it for my father in laws Birthday cake and everyone was raving over it.  The cream cheese frosting was the best part. I will make this cake again and again.

I made it exactly as the recipe says but without the nuts, and in two 9" round pans.  I took it to dessert with some friends for Easter.  Someone who said he didn't eat things with cream cheese frosting ended up having a piece because of other people's raving.  Great recipe!

This is the best carrot cake recipe!  I followed the suggestion to cut the oil down to 1 cup, which makes the cake moist but not greasy.  Also, I don't like my frosting too sweet, so I cut the powdered sugar in the frosting in half and it's just right.  All my friends ask me to make this!

Great carrot cake here but here's the BEST SECRET! On a whim I substituted 3 cups of chopped apples (1/4") for the carrots and ended up w/ THE BEST APPLE CAKE EVER INVENTED!!! Instead of the cream cheese frosting, do this: 
Melt one stick of butter on medium flame. Add 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup of heavy cream. Stir slightly and bring to a boil. Simmer for ten (10)minutes- DO NOT STIR! Remove from heat and add 2 tsp of vanilla. Stir in and let cool slightly. Pour/drizzle over cake. Almost too good!

Perfect carrot cake. Well, actually, the cake by itself is a bit bland, even with extra cinnamon, and the frosting is a bit knock-you-off-your-feet-sweet, but together, they're absolutely perfect. They compliment eachother beautifully. If I had known carrot cake was this easy to make, I don't think I would have waited so long to try it, especially since I can pronounce every ingredient, unlike boxed cake mixes.

Wow! I made this for a dinner party and boy, was it a hit!  One thing I may try next time is adding a little orange juice to the frosting...soon after I made mine someone made carrot cake with a little orange juice in the frosting...it was really good, even better than this frosting.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

WOW! I receive rave reviews every time I bake this! I've had  friends tell me this is the best carrot cake they've ever eaten. I bake in 2 9" round pans and after frosting finely chop pecans and place around sides of the cake. Makes for an impressive presentation.

I used this recipe 7 times in order to make a 14 inch, 11 inch and a 9 inch cake (3-tier wedding cake). The cakes were very moist, kept their shape and, the best part, I made it a week in advance.

I made this cake for our Easter dessert and everyone raved up & down about it!  I didn't use the pecans and only used 1 cup oil.  Also, I did add a bit more cinammon and 1 cup of raisins.  With the frosting I used low fat cream cheese and 3 cups powdered sugar.  The cake was very moist!  I'll be making this again!

Sooooo good!  I made this for Easter and it was gone that day.  Out of 6 adults and 4 kids, all loved it.  It is moist and delicious.  As far as the other reviews: yes it does need a day for the flavors to blend, I made it Saturday and it was pretty good, but by Sunday wow!  I also took the other advice and used applesauce for half the oil, and used brown sugar for half of the white.  For the frosting, I also only used half of the powdered sugar.  It was perfect.  The cake was very moist!  Thank you so much for this recipe Tammy!  I have tried to make carrot cake 3 times and it always turned out bad.  No more!  :)

What a terrific recipe.  I live in Athens, Greece, I have made this cake on many occasions and you will be pleased to know that it is a HUGE hit with everyone who tastes it.  Even the most difficult of eaters have found it moist and delicious.  Who knows in a few years all of Greece will be familiar with your wonderful carrot cake.  Moist people are shocked when i tell them it has carrots in it.  I did not modify this recipe in one way. I will like to thank you again.

I am sending out a GREAT BIG THANK YOU! Every carrot cake recipe I have calls for coconut and for some reason if you leave it out of my recipes then the cake is too loose. I am highly allergic to coconut and now you have solved my problem.  Thank you so very much Tammy. Sincerly, Laurie

absolutely awesome. I added some grated fresh ginger. You can judge how much to grate. Also you can add an 8 oz can of crushed pineapple with juice like a couple of the recipes on this site ask for. I loooove this carrot cake. I donate it to my kids school for bake sale. They can't get enough. THANKS Tammy Elliott!!!

Wonderful cake!  I have never made a carrot cake before, and I am so glad I tried this recipe first!  It was very moist and I did add 1 cup of coconut and 1 cup of raisens.  I also used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead of all white sugar.  Not sure if this made a difference or not.

I'm used to carrot cakes that taste like spice cake, but my husband loved this. The texture is nice. I liked the healthy substitutions, although I'd probably stick to real cream cheese for flavor next time but make less frosting and use a bundt pan.

Tasted better and better each day.  Very moist, yet not too heavy.  I added orange zest to the batter and frosting, a little tip from my pastry chef friend at the Ritz Carlton.  I substituted 1/4 cup of the oil for 1/4 cup of fresh pineapple juice.  It still came out very moist, and you could not taste the pineapple at all.

This is only the second time I've baked a carrot cake from scratch. The first one was great, but this one was heavenly. Very moist and tasty, without being overly rich. In the future I'd cut down on the oil, and half the confectioners sugar for the icing.

I really enjoyed this carrot cake.  I used 1 cup of applesauce in place of the oil, 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar, and King Arthur's White Whole Wheat flour.  Still came out really good.  Must be exceptional without substitutions!  I ate it icingless, but plan to make the icing tonight.

Great cake!  I also pureed the carrots in my Vita-Mix and halved the amount of frosting.  Very moist.  Good for muffins as well.

EXCELLENT.  Like many of the others I substituted applesauce for the oil and it was fantastic.  Definitely will make this again!  Thank you Tammy!

I admit I didn't use the frosting recipe--I bought some pre-made at the store. But I didn't like the cake part very well. It was rather bland, not sweet enough, and I wasn't too happy with the texture either.

This is the best cake I've ever had...let alone ever made!  It was super moist and flavorful.  I used applesauce to replace some oil as suggested by other reviewers.  I added nutmeg to the batter and frosting.  I also cut the sugar in the frosting to 2 cups and it was perfect!  I love this cake and will make again and again.  Thanks!

This cake looked great and tasted so good!! I followed previous advice and used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce,I also used half white sugar and half brown.(I added a little nutmeg to the cake also.)For the frosting I cut the sugar down to 3 cups,but may use 2 1/2 cups next time---also I added 2 tablespoons of thawed orange juice concentrate and 1/4 teaspoon allspice.The frosting turned out nice and creamy,and I loved the addition of the orange!Will be making again!!

I had to try this after reading all the great reviews.  My cake was awesome!  I had to make 2 cakes.  One for home and one to take to a church gathering.  I did cut the frosting sugar in half and added more cream cheese and it tastes wonderful.  Next time I make it,  I will cut back on the oil and try the applesauce.  Great recipe!

This was an awesome recipe. So moist, and so easy to make! Easy on the frosting, though, very rich. (I cut the icing sugar in half) The cake was delicious even plain! It's been out for about two hours and it's already half gone! I shall remain faithful to this recipe forever! :o)

Yummy Yummy Carrot Cake!!! This was the first time I've made carrot cake and I was surprised this tasted sooooo good! Even without the icing! I didn't have any pecans nor did I have cream cheese AND I only had 3 eggs left so I halved the recipe, no pecans added and no icing. It tasted wonderful! Only, instead of the 1 cup of white sugar, I put half a cup white sugar and half a cup of brown sugar. Also, instead of half the oil I needed, I only used 1/2cup of oil. I made mine in a loaf pan. One word I would describe this recipe? Yummy. Definately a keeper in my recipe book!

I combined the wet ingredients and dry separately. Then I folded the wet into the dry by hand. Then folded the carrots, and then folded the pecans. Cut the frosting recipe in half. Used a 8 inch lined springform pan.

Everyone is bashing on the reviewers who are updating their reviews and comments with tips and tricks. Personally, I’m thankful for the ones who do this. Low on oil? I was able to use apple sauce thanks to a top review for this recipe. If you have issues with these reviews, don’t read it and don’t do it. Anyways, this recipe really was a great foundation and thank you all for the tips!

Made it with the recipe as is.  My only hack was to buy shredded carrots and run them through my chopper.  Worked out well!  Rave reviews from all - even my MIL who doesn’t like carrot cake !

Changes ahead...hang on to your soap boxes. The base recipe is great AND I used all of the changes from the premier review (applesauce, brown sugar, extra vanilla and cinnamon). I got rave reviews from my eaters. 
I don't understand all of the complaints about changes--that is what cooking and baking is all about. You have certain things on hand or don't like ingredients and so you make changes. Personally, I want to hear about how that process works for others. Until AR recipes provides some new widget to allow people to declare"made as shown" or "made with changes" let's be thankful for the brave bakers out there.

A very well put together carrot cake. I’m just happy we were able to find a vegan recipe for our cousin’s foreign exchange student, Jarnathan. He is apparently very picky and needs his food to be vegan. So, i this recipe was PERFECT for this use, no milk or meat, whew!

I have now made this twice and my husband and son say it is the best they have ever had! I had to make two batches of the frosting the second time as they both complained there was not enough. Only a Thin layer in center, top covered but not the sides. So today, double frosting and happy men in my family!

I loved this recipe. The only changes I made was to use more cinnamon and I used avocado oil. It was so moist and light I had to be careful putting on the cream cheese icing. My family hates nuts and fruit in cake, and this cake had plenty of flavour without them.

Can’t imagine why some reviewers didn’t like this recipie. Didn’t change much except that I ran out of white sugar and used 1 cup white 1 cup brown sugar. Very moist cake baked for 35 minutes and it was perfect but I used a shallow sheet pan. Frosting was delicious as well not very sweet.

Best carrot cake I have ever made. Be careful though when its done just let heat out of oven and leave cake to cool slowly inside. Could need an extra few mins and go for the full cooking time. Oven dependent of course

The video instructs you to wait until you get the wet and dry ingredients mixed together before grating the carrots- don't do that. Once the leavening ingredients (baking soda and baking powder) are wet -they start to active. Have your carrots grated and ready to go first. I grate mine before I start to do anything. Then you can mix the wet with the dry ingredients, then add your  waiting carrots, and then get your cake right in the oven! Someone else already suggested adding 1 cup crushed pineapple and I wholeheartedly agree- OMG, so good....

I made this as-is and it was GREAT. It's so unnecessary to modify it with pineapple and what-not.. Then you'd be making a whole different kind of cake. I've made many a carrot cake of different recipes and all came out yummy. Zero complaints, countless compliments. Stop trying to be fancy and just make the cake!

Unfortunately I did not make the recipe as is.  Browsing through the other reviews I did as they suggested.  The changes I made:
- 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar (next time I make this I may just use brown sugar as I found this was too sweet for our diabetic household)
- 3 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp nutmeg
- 1 tsp ground clove
- 1 tsp all spice
- 3 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 apple sauce and 3/4 vegetable oil (using the apple sauce will help get rid of the baking soda/powder taste)
- I grated the carrots using the larger holes on yh grater

I made mini cupcakes and came out with 72 perfect bite sized cupcakes.  Baked them for 20 min and they came out perfectly. 

For the frosting I used light cream cheese instead of regular and used 2 cups of sugar. 

Loved the adjustments reccomemed. Will be making this again this week!

This recipe is excellent as is. No need to change it. I made this for a party & wanted a big impressive cake, so I multiplied everything by 1.5 & made it a 3-layer cake. Excellent, everyone raved over it. Decorated top of cake with a ring of pecan halves & it was beautiful as well as delicious.

My review is on the batter because I didn't have the ingredients to make the frosting. Luckily I had a jar of cream cheese frosting in my pantry. Let me start by saying I hate carrot cake. I've had many kinds because I never want to offend someone by not trying it, but I have never had any that I liked. The only reason why I decided to make this was because my roommate asked if I would make him a carrot cake sometime, and I just bought a new KitchenAid mixer. I had all the ingredients, so I went ahead and started grating the carrots. I read some reviews where many people changed one thing or another. I decided to just stick to the original recipie first and see how it came out, and I'm glad I did. This cake is amazing! My roommate said it was "f**king delicious!" I actually ate two pieces because I liked it so much. Thanks for a great recipie and for making me like carrot cake :)

I have been making this recipe for about the past 4 birthdays for my husband. He loves it and even though I'm not a huge fan of carrot cake, I like it too! :) I do usually split the oil to be half oil half applesauce. I also add a bit of extra cinnamon and nutmeg. A couple of times I've made 2 9" rounds to make a layer cake instead (no adjustment to amounts in the recipe). This is a standby!

This is my new go to for carrot cake. I made this in a 9x13 pan and baked it for 60 minutes which was perfect. No changes are needed to this recipe. It's delicious as written and that's what I rated.

I made this recipe "as is" and I was happy with the results!  When I choose a recipe I typically trust the number of high reviews and this one was not disappointing...I don't understand why someone would say this was "not good," unless they are just really finicky...you can't please everyone!

This is my first attempt of baking a carrot cake. I mixed both white and raw sugar of 1 cup each, and used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil. It's moist and tasty. Will do it again.

My favorite carrot cake recipe. I make no substitutions other than half as much frosting. I like just a light layer.

This recipe is a staple for me. I have made this cake probably 30 to 40 times over the years. 
I have noticed people commenting here about ppl making changes and acting like it is a huge improvement. They are upset with this practice and I do agree. Part of the problem is that this site specifically asks if you have made any changes when you are reviewing a recipe and perhaps that encourages them. I have done plenty of things to this recipe like adding shredded coconut, crushed pineapple, broken almonds because someone was allergic to pecans and walnuts but not almonds. I have substituted brown for white sugar mostly because I was out of white.  But the real truth is that no matter what I do with this recipe and in particular even just following it exactly, all my friends basically lose their mind over it and almost all say it is the best carrot cake they have ever had. It is simple and fantastic. Period.

I made this recipe 3x before I got it right. The only thing I feel is necessary to mention is omitting the baking soda. When I used it, my center collapsed after removing it from the oven. Once I took another reviewer's suggestion to instead use double the baking powder and no soda, it turned out absolutely perfect! If you find grating carrots annoying, just buy one of those pre-shredded bags in the produce section. Next time, I'm going to try it without pecans in the frosting (there are a lot), just to see. This recipe is pretty rad, especially for those that don't care for the cake with pineapple in it. Happy baking! :)

This was delicous!  I took others advice and added 20 oz can of crushed pinapple drained and I only had walnuts so I crushed those up and added them.  Next time I will use pecans to see which is better.  Instead of using 2 cups of white sugar I substituted one cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white.  Great carrot cake!

I made this cake today.

The only changes I made were:
I used walnuts instead of pecans, because that's what we had, and prefer.
Even my neighbour loves this carrot cake...with the walnuts.

I also cut the recipe in half, and used a 9-inch cake pan, just in case we didn't like the cake, and wouldn't waste so much.
I cooked the 9-inch cake for 30-35 mins. 

Edit: I've made this cake many times now, using the whole 9x13 recipe. I still cook it in two 9-inch pans, and take one to my neighbour. He says you really can't taste the cinnamon in it, and he's right. I'm not a fan of cinnamon and was worried two teaspoons would stand out in flavour. It didn't, luckily.

It came out very moist, and did not sink in the centre.
It was my first time making carrot cake from scratch.

I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, that's why I made a smaller one. I did like this one, though. 
However, my husband really loved it. 
Maybe next time, I will make the 9x13 inch cake and freeze pieces for him to take to work.

Nothing in this recipe needs to be changed at all.

This is a really good recipe, but it is even better with a the changes that others have recommended. The original recipe is delicious but it is more moist you substitute the white sugar for 1 c white and 1 c brown and use 1/2 c applesauce and 3/4 c vegetable oil. I also caramelize pecans with butter and brown sugar to top the cake. It is gorgeous and delicious.

Great recipe. However, I used white spelt flour, l  cup grape seed oil because that's all I had, and less processed cane sugar. The sugar had a sugar cane smell to it, so I was concerned about the flavor, but it turned out perfect. I also only used 2 cups of grated carrots and that was 4 carrots. I've been making carrot cake for many years but hadn't made one within the past year. The only drawback is that I think I'll eat too much of it because it's delicious. One more note, to shred my carrots I use the grater disk with my food processor and then I place the S blade in the container and process them again no more than one minute until they're just well grated but not mushy. This works well for me.

I just made this for my family - what a hit!  This recipe made me look like a carrot cake hero!  I pretty much did everything exactly, except I did add an extra tsp. of cinnamon (so 3 tsps.) and for the frosting I only put in 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4, and I still thought it was very sweet - this recipe is going in my saved "golden" recipes for sure.  There's a reason why this cake is so popular - trust me - you can't lose!

The cake was really easy to make and had great flavor. I did add a generous cup of golden raisins per my husband's request. I made in two 9inch pans as well. My only complaint was the center of the cake sank in. I made this twice and it did the same thing on both cakes. Visually annoying when you serve. I did also use one cup less of sugar for frosting and was plenty sweet. Will continue to make per my husbands request.

I have never made a carrot cake from scratch. My sister who is home from college has asked me to make her one, so here I am. This looks like a great recipe so I will give it a try... without all the changes that others are making. Well all wish me luck!!!!! I will come back and let you know how it came out.

Made it as directed, but left out the pecans!  I felt like I tasted a lot of egg-like a scrambled egg flavor.  It may need more spice but I still like it as it is.  Perfect directions.

My cake got hard or carmelized edge.  I hope it softens up after the icing is applied.  I only used 3 cups of confect. sugar, by accident.  It was still perfect.

This carrot cake is so delicious.  I didn't realize I had never reviewed it.  I just made it again and it sure doesn't last long.  I do cut back a little on the sugar and oil and use white whole wheat flour.  This recipe is a real keeper.  Thanks Tammy Elliott for a great recipe.

No complaints about this yummy cake! Made very few changes, of which I doubt if I didn't make them, it would have been any different. Had to sub a few canned apricots diced up for the applesauce b/c I didn't have any. Added an extra tbsp of vanilla. Rest was pretty much as written. It is tasty and moist and delicious. Made the icing too and that was good. Next time will make w/out the icing b/c it does overpower the cake just a tad and is too sweet for our tastes.

Too sweet. ..I am not an expert in cake so I followed the recipe 100% and I believe it has too much sugar both in the cake and the frosty. Loved the texture and how soft it was and I will try again with less sugar and with a dark chocolate on the top.

Totally delicious!  I made this exactly as stated and it was perfect.  I made it for the first time for Easter - company and all - and everyone loved it. The pecans in the icing was a huge hit. This is a keeper!

I've eaten plenty of carrot cake but NONE of them were as good as this one.   Some people at our BBQ said it was impresionante.  It's sooo moist and as one little friend of  min e would say its "Yummylicious"

I made this following the recipe exactly and it turned out DELICIOUS. I'm a huge carrot cake fan and this is by far the yummiest one I've ever had. I left out the nuts and was glad I did, the decadence in the basic recipe is by far more than enough. Only tip is make sure to dry the carrots after washing and peeling before grating, and use a coarser grade for the grating. I think that may explain some of the extra "juice" others were mentioning. Awesome recipe, thank you!!

This was the best carrot cake ever, so moist and flavorful.  I made no changes to the recipe and follow the directions exactly as written. The only problem I had is that I should of made two of them because it went very quickly at our Easter dinner gathering. :) Will definitely be making this again.

followed most of gneebeanie suggestions except I didn't use the pineapples they suggested.  I did the following
1) using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 
2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 
3) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 
4) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 
5) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce
6) For the frosting, 3.5 cups of powdered sugar

I made this for my family's Easter brunch dessert and it was a hit! I made the alterations suggested by many of the reviewers and summed up by "gneebeanie"(thank you!) and it was moist with just the right amount of sweetness. I did not use pineapple however due to allergies and added a little more apple sauce as a sub. I will definitely make it again.

I have been making this recipe for a few years now and my whole family LOVES it! They request me to make it for them all the time in fact my cousin asked me to make cupcakes for their baby shower coming up. The only change I've made was to cut the icing recipe in half because I leave it in the pan and always had way too much left over =)

I made this cake for my mother in law's birthday this week. I had never made a cake from scratch before, but carrot cake is her favorite and making it from a box sounded terrible to me. I followed this recipe with the consolidated list of changes a user posted because I'm not one of those salty people who complain about reviewers offering suggested changes. The cake was absolutely delicious!! The frosting is definitely very sweet, I used 3.5 cups sugar. The cake overall was very sweet and VERY good. And the recipe was easy enough for a first time cake baked to follow. Great recipe :)

I made some of the substitutions suggested by other reviewers -- 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup applesauce, nutmeg -- and I think the cake came out fine, but I would hardly say it was fantastic.  Maybe the original would have been better; it's hard to say.  I tried these without the icing and they pretty much tasted like muffins.  But I do like how they weren't too sweet!

Ii tried this recipe and follow word for word. Its nice but a little dry than most carrot cake that I tasted before. After reading most reviews, I think I will add an applesauce or more oil next time to make it moister. It still taste good though. :)

This is my go to recipe for a quick cake. I love how moist it is and its always a hit. I've always doubled the recipe so we have enough for the next day! I never add the raisins or pecans, but if you like those ingredients, then I'm sure they compliment the flavor.

Delicious! Easy to make, fabulous recipe! Followed recipe as written only slight tweaking, white + brown sugar 50/50 and a 1 Tb.spoon of yogurt( I don't know if it really makes any difference, always add it when I use baking soda). Thank you so much Tammy for sharing it with all of us!

I love this recipe. My modifications. I use a food processor to totally crumble my carrots and I end up with like 5 cups of carrots. This helps keep it moist. I also, depending on the time of year will split the sugar half white/brown and add extra spice. I also substitute 1/2 cup crushed walnuts in the cake batter. Delish since I'm  not huge on huge pieces of nuts. For frosting I cut half the sugar out and again I crush the pecans so its almost a nut powder. People beg me to make this cake , I've given them recipe with mods. but Still they want me to make it. I always oblige because its sooooo yummy. Thank you for this recipe
p.s I do not recommend cutting the oil. Carrot cake is suppose to moist or else you end up with a loaf or dry muffin style cake. Extra fresh carrots are always a nice addition too.

1. Way too much leavening agents and the wrong kind for this recipe: I suggest just the baking powd.
2. Not enough moisture: I would increase the carrots to about 3.5 cups.
3. Frosting is way too sweet.

Incredible recipe, thank you for sharing. This is the first time I've made a carrot cake and it turned out perfect. I did use a couple of tips from other reviewers which were; I boiled the raisins in orange juice, added 1/8tsp of nutmeg, used two 8" rounds and reduced cooking time by 15 minutes. I also drained the crushed pineapple and reduced the amount of cocoanut but only because of personal taste

I made this recipe yesterday for a co-worker that was having a "going away party" and i decided to make this recipe into 24 cupcakes... the taste is AMAZING but i only filled the cups about half way and they rose completely over the top and stuck to the top of the cupcake pan. When i tried to get them out, the tops broke off so needless to say i couldn't bring them into work but i made the frosting and gave them all to my parents and brother.. the cupcakes were a huge hit with them! I will make this recipe again but in a 13x9 pan just like the recipe called for. Awesome recipe!!!

Made as written exactly.  Fairly dry.  While I like the frosting, others thought too sweet.  Sorry, won't make again.

I made it with half ingredients of the recipe in a 9x5 loaf pan for 60min. 
I made some subs: 1 cups brown sugar, same amount of greek yogurt for oil, 3/4cup wholemeal flour, and no pecan since it is for my neighbouring babies. 
It turned out beautifully !! Very moist and healthy :) Thanks !

Super! No need to change a thing! I do have to eliminate the pecans because of a tree nut allergy in my home. I add raisins instead. That's it! I'm sure it would still be wonderful with the pecans. I've had many complements on this cake. It's a keeper!

Easy cake.. Followed recipe as is.. Skipped pecans though.. Used pulp from juicer after making some carrot apple juice.. Only used about 3 cups of powdered sugar for frosting and it turned out nice and fluffy.

I have made this cake two years in a row for my boyfriend's birthday and he really does enjoy it.  I also like it and carrot cake is not my first choice.  The only reason I am not giving it a 5 is because he told me this year that it could use a little more carrot; so next time I make it I will just add 4 cups instead of 3 cups.  The frosting is delicious as well and it comes out very moist and tasty.  Would definitely recommend it.

The first time I made this, I had everything gathered, when I realized I only had about a 1/3 cup of oil. I substituted the remainder with pumpkin pie mix, & it was excellent! Now I make it like this every time!

I followed recipe to a T.  All fresh ingredients, preheated my oven for 30 mins and still the sides raised too much and middle fell super flat.  I did let it cool and tasted before making frosting and it's AWEFUL.  Has a taste of too much baking powder.  I noticed all the bad reviews are from people who followed the recipe exactly.  Next time I find a recipe I will start by reading the bad reviews first.

This is one of the best cakes I've ever made,only made few modifications: decreased sugar amount to one cup and It is still sweet to my taste, I also skipped pecans because we don't have it in our country. Mine came out great, I highly recommend everyone to try it once.

Amazing! Perfectly dense and full of carrot cake goodness.

1 change:
-1/3 cup oil + 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce

Too much oil in the original recipe and even in some of the revisions.

This recipe was amazing.  Made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  Someone commented "this would be on the menu at my restaurant".  Even my lactose intolerant cousin couldn't resist and after one piece said it was so worth eating that she had seconds.  The best carrot cake ever!

I made it almost as written, we didn't have pecans so I added another cup of carrots. It is excellent, even better the next day. The flavor of the frosting is great, the texture a little grainy, that's my mistake, didn't beat it long enough I think. It would be helpful to know how long to whip it.

I have made this Carrot Cake lll many times exactly as the recipe is written.  EVERYONE loves it and is always requesting it all year around. I can truly give it five stars because I feel that when a reviewer is giving a 5 star review it means the recipe as written is worth it. So, now let the person who shared with us this wonderful recipe for carrot cake get the credit for a really awesome recipe as written. Thank you Tammy Elliott!

This must be a great recipe as it is. I made a few major changes to make it a bit more nutritionally friendly. It turned out denser than probably expected but very flavorful. I split the flour with cashew meal/flour, used coconut oil, and coconut sugar. I used lemon extract plus a ½ t instead of vanilla in the frosting to go with all the coconut flavor from the cake. Personally, I didn't eat much frosting because of the butter, but I tasted and I liked it and more important, I got good feedback from the carrot cake fans. Consider this carrot cake LVIX.

fantastic recipe that tasted soft and moist overnight in the fridge! I used 150g brown sugar and 150g white sugar. For the frosting, i cut down the sugar to 100g and that was enough for though it wasn't as fluffy as it would"ve been in I'd used the full amount (blek! too sweet!)it was fluffy enough and stiff enough and spreadable! Thanks for the recipe!

Help I followed this recipe and after 50 minutes of baking I opened the oven and a third of the mixture has spilled out and the top looked brown and cooked but the whole cake inside is still all wet and uncooked.  What do i do?

Embarrassing as it may be -- I can literally burn water :-)  On a scale from 1-10 -- my level of baking skill is 0.

So when it came to preparing this cake I was a little intimated but I followed the directions and it turned to be a great hit!  I followed gneebeanie's December 8, 2006 recommendations to make it a little healthier but otherwise an awesome recipe.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!  Everyone loved it!  A keeper for our family!

This was a good, basic carrot cake recipe.  Nothing special here and if it was my recipe I would reduce the sugar in both the cake and the frosting.  I put 3 instead of 4 cups of sugar in the frosting and it was still way too sweet for my taste.  I think carrot cake is pretty hard to screw up so if you are looking for a basic, no frills cake this is fine but just know there are plenty like this out there that lack the overdose of sugar that this one contains.

I double the recipe. I made some changes. 6 eggs instead 8 eggs (original recipe use 4 in each batch). I used almond extract (i didn't have vanilla). I also add dried grapes. I baked 6 pans, Three batches in total, more than 80 persons were agree that it was delicious. I used Vanilla frosty and ground walnut for decoration.

This cake was absolutely delicious! I cut down on the carrots so it would add some moistness to it, and I did not add the pineapple. I used this for a Father's Day picnic.

I was given 20 lbs. of carrots and didn't know what to do with so many, so I started searching for carrot cake recipes. When I came across this one I decided to try and was not disappointed. It turned out awesome! I followed recipe exactly and I made a double batch because my family devoured it.

My family loved this cake.  I made it for Father's Day.  The only change I made was subbing raisins for the pecans because I don't like nuts.  Will definitely make again!

I added an extra tsp of vanilla, a cup of coconut, 4 oz of drained crushed pineapple, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and I used walnuts instead of pecans... Absolutely delicious... The coconut, pineapple and nuts are really what gives it that carrot cake you loved from the bakery taste...

This was a tasty carrot cake, but a bit sweet.  If I made it again I might dial bake a little on the sugar.  I also omitted pecans from the batter, because I dislike nuts in my cake.  Overall, a delicious recipe.

This cake is by far my fave. I have made lots of carrot cakes over the years. I did like others suggested add an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and also 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. I also added to the 2 tsp of vanilla, a tsp of rum flavoring. I also used 3/4 cup melted coconut oil and 1/2 cup butter!

This is hands down the most delicious and best carrot cake recipe ever! Once, I made it vegan, by substituting flax seeds for the eggs, and it was still great. Another time, I made it for my diabetic friend, so I used either Splenda,Stevia, or Truvia, and added yogurt for moisture, plus one other suggestion on the sugar substitute package. I  must have added too much extra liquid, so I ended up baking it an additional 30 minutes, until it wasn't liquid in the middle. It turned out to be the best cake ever! Everyone (3 men and one boy) one ate it right then and there, there were no left overs!

Waw, this carrot cake is amazing !
I have already tried other recepts, but this one is clearly one of the best ! I didn't make the frosting, but i'm sure it's still better that way ;-). I only added almonds and hazelnuts, and I put honey and brown sugar instead of white sugar. Its give more subtle flavor. Let's try !

Thanks this recipe is really good! I've made it already a couple of times for me and my roommates with and we all find it amazingly delicious. I try to make it every time we have some leftover carrots lying around before they go bad. 
For those of you who would like to add a special taste to the cake I would recommend adding some extra spices like ground ginger, nutmeg, and doubling the amount of cinnamon.

I made as written. The texture was perfect and it was moist but I thought the flavor of the cake was missing something - not the best carrot cake I have ever had. The frosting was the perfect amount of sweetness for the cake. I made two 9" rounds which cooked perfectly at 40 minutes.

I made this cake exactly as the recipe is here, but adjusted the baking time by about 10 minutes less because I made a 2 layer cake. I also made an extra half batch of frosting, cuz let's be honest, it's really the best part of a cake. The cake though is awesome. Very flavorful and moist. I highly recommend and will definitely be making this one again.,

This cake turned out great. I omitted the pecans because my boyfriend is allergic, but otherwise I stuck to the recipe. We've since used the cream cheese frosting recipe for many other treats, and I've found that the butter can easily be left out for an equally delicious, lower fat option.

This was really good, my family loved it!  I made the following substitutions:  Out of necessity, used 1C brown and 1C white sugar rather than all white (I was running low on white).  From a calorie standpoint I used 1/2 C applesauce and 3/4 C oil in place of all oil.  Added just a 1/2 t ginger, because I love the stuff, and no nuts, because my kids aren't crazy about them.  Made 2 nine-inch round layers, which did sink just a bit in the middle, but it wasn't noticable once frosted.  Plenty moist and very delicious--even son #3 liked it, in spite of the carrots!  :) For frosting--added extra 4 oz cream cheese to this recipe, as I prefer that ratio of "tang".  Perfection, definite keeper.  Thanks!

I made this recipe exactly the way it calls I only added a little more vanilla ( I normally do to any recipes that call for vanilla). Everyone LOVED IT! No problems like some of the other reviewers had, mine did not collapse and wasn't dry at all. I also take a little corn syrup and a drop of water and brush it on the cake after it's out of the oven helps with keeping the cake moist. Thank you:)

I actually only needed the icing part of this recipe. Simple and cream cheesy deliciousness. I even ended up adding those pecans cause I thought the picture was pretty. One day when I have time to make a homemade from scratch cake, I will give this a go. Family loved it.

I made this as my first carrot cake ever for a family easter party, surprisingly it was enough for my big family and they all loved it! I told them all to give me honest answers and they all said it tasted amazing, mine i put into 2, 9 in. Pans and put icing in the middle and on top and i put pecans around the edge and then some near the middle and crushed walnuts sprinkled on top of the cake also i substituted all the pecans for walnuts

Very moist cake. I decreased the confectioners sugar to 11/2 cps. , since I didn't like it too sweet.

I followed the directions of the commenter who had summarized all their changes so I can't comment on the original recipe. The cake turned out delicious and was a big hit at Easter - carrot cake and bunnies just go together!

PERFECT AS IS!!!  I made NO alterations and the cake is fantastic.  Better than any restaurant cake, best carrot cake I've ever had, and I'm always in search of a good carrot cake. Make alterations if you must, but rest assured, as is, its delicious.

This is my all time favourite Carrot cake recipe! First time I baked it, it turned out really delicious but was a bit too soft that the piece would kinda fall apart. So when I baked it for the second time I added 1/2 cup of flour, and it turned out to be perfect!!!! I normally skip the frosting and have it with tea. 5+++++ recipe!

I have tried three other recipes here but for me, this one is the best so far. my husband loved it. I used walnuts instead of pecans and used one cup of dark brown sugar and one of the regular sugar. I added half a cup of raisins. It came out great, rich and moist. Do not over cook.

I just tried this recipe, I baked it in three small pans and the middle was all squishy and the cake looks super oily. the flavor is pretty ok, but the texture is just really weird. I've been baking for a while and I know it had nothing to do with the way I mixed everything together. I followed gneebeanie's tips except for the apple sauce part. Maybe that will make a difference, I just don't know if I want to waste so many ingredients again

I have been making this recipe for years. People rave over how delicious it is. A few notes: If the cake will be frosted, I reduce the sugar to 1 cup. Also I reduce the oil to 1 cup. I find that 1 1/4 makes the cake almost wet. Lastly, sometimes the cake makes my tongue feel weird. Possibly the baking powder is too much.

This recipe was perfect the way it was written. It was the first carrot cake I have made, and I didn't do any alterations. The recipe was extremely easy to follow and the whole family loved it! I'm definitely saving this one.

This was an awesome carrot cake!! I don't like pineapple, raisins or applesauce in cakes, If I wanted all that I'd make a fruitcake. Make it just as stated and you won't be disappointed.

This is my first time making carrot cake and am so glad it was an epic WIN. Made it  for my hubby's bday in sept and he loved it, so I decided to double it and make 2 cakes for Thanksgiving (had 15 people at my house). EVERYONE loved it. The frosting definitely makes it :)

Great recipe. I didn't have walnuts so I used almonds. I also used raisins as another review suggested. I ran out of sugar so I used part sugar and part stevia. I also only used stevia in the cream frosting. I didn't have nutmeg, so I used pumpkin and cinnamon spice. It was good!

I liked a lot this cake.. yesterday I baked it and it turned out with a sunken center. but it wasn't that noticeable with the frosting . It was a pretty tasty cake. but i thought that it was too much baking soda so I just  added one teaspoon I also added a pinch of nutmeg, clove and allspice  . I definitely recommended this cake . just beware with the amounts of baking soda and make sure to bake it properly.

Great recipe...added half brown sugar instead of all white and added 1/4 nutmeg. I didn't use all of the icing sugar because I wanted a bit more cream cheese flavour. I'd say I used about 3/4 of what was recommended. Thank you so much!! LOVED THIS. Note: I did not add the pineapple or applesauce as some suggested and I'm really happy that I didn't.

I've made this recipe twice now, once in mini loaf pans and once as cupcakes - both times with outstanding results. I added golden raisins and used walnuts instead of pecans.  The taste and texture of the cake is far superior to grocery store bakery carrot cakes.  The frosting is luscious and divine.  No need to add other spices or fussy ingredients - this superb recipe stands on its own!

This was very yummy! I even subbed 1 cup of the shredded carrot for 1 cup of shredded yellow crookneck squash. I'll sub that for 1 cup shredded zucchini next time :) Definitely a keeper!

I believe this is my first from scratch cake. I did use half brown packed sugar and half white sugar. I also didn't use any nuts, although I may try that!  Son C and I picked fresh carrots from our garden, and all the boys took turns shredding carrots to make packed cups to go into this cake. All of the kids and I loved this recipe! I did use 2 round cake pans and baked for 35 mins. I used fat free cream cheese, and may have used more powdered sugar than originally called for. After I frosted the cake I put in the fridge to set up a bit.

Really nice recipe. It works as is and it's nice if you tweak it a little too. With this cake, I like using all brown sugar, adding an extra tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg and a little honey. I made these as cupcakes too; in the dark tins, they took ~ 20 mins, in aluminum (light) tins they took ~ 22, and in silicone ~ 24. Made 28 (1/4 cup when wet) cupcakes. This recipe is definitely worth a try.

This was the best carrot cake recipe I've ever tried! Everyone that tried my carrot cake thought it was amazing. Admittedly I'm afraid of trying recipes that are not rated well, but I can now tell why most people love it.

Long time lover of carrot cake, first time baking it from scratch.  Made no changes to this recipe and it is delicious.  9 x 13 Pyrex baking dish.  I was worried about all the oil, but it came out perfect.  Light, fluffy, flavorful, not at all oily.  I'll use less sugar next time, but I prefer all my deserts less sweet than most people do.  I'm a cream cheese frosting addict, so I made extra.   Yummy!

I have much better recipes for carrot cake. I used a 9X13 baking pan and it boiled over. It was not a very moist and didn't taste like carrot cake at all. The only change I made was to reduce the baking soda and baking powder due to my elevation, but the cake still fell in the middle. All in all, didn't really like the cake and won't be making this again.

This was absolutely wonderful! It was moist and tasted amazing. Even the frosting was great. I omitted the pecans and just added some chopped to the top for decoration. I cooked mine in two 9" round pans for 40 minutes. I also upped the cinnamon to 3 tsp and added 2 tsp allspice and 2 tsp nutmeg. I put in 3/4 cups oil and 1/2 cup (one single serving) of applesauce instead of all that oil. I also put in 3 1/2 cups of grated carrots. I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is super easy, and it turned out great. I've made it twice, and the second time I made some of my own changes. 

I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla to the batter and used gluten free flour. I think the gluten free flour made the cake stick to the pan less, and made it less dense. 

The frosting is much better with only 2 cups of confectioners sugar. It's lighter and fluffier.

Best carrot cake ever!!! I used a 6 inch round cake pan to make layers. Even though the pan was smaller, it still took 45 minutes to bake. It turned out moist and delicious.

OMG! So good! literally just made this and it's cooling now..it's so good!  I haven't even frosted yet! Only thing I changed was 1c brown sugar and 1c white, i love adding extra flavors so i added about 2 tbs vanilla heaping 2 tsp cinnamon + about tsp nutmeg. I dont really like adding extra weird flavors to anything..( like pineapple to a "carrot cake" but never tried.. Prob wont.

Fantastic recipe!!! I followed the recipe exactly, but decided not to add pecans to the cake batter (only the icing) and thought it was excellent. Cake was very moist and flavorful. I ended up giving the recipe out to everyone who tasted this cake! Will most definitely be making this for years to come; thanks for the recipe!

Most amazing carrot cake ever. I buy the pre-bagged matchstick carrots and then hand crush them to smaller pieces. It's so moist and delicious. I have been asked for this recipe more than anything else I've ever made. Ever.

I followed the recipe exactly (because it has good reviews, meaning the recipe as written should be good). It bubbled over massively and I had to clean it up, yet it sunk in the middle. Every cake I've ever made has domed, never sunk.

40 minutes into "baking" I tested it, because the outside looked dark. It wasn't burnt, just caramelized and the center was literally liquid. After "baking," aside from the very center (which is the consistency of oil after 50 minutes in the oven), the rest of the cake is caramelized. The cake tastes like caramelized vegetable oil.

I used packed cups of carrots, 1/3rd cup crushed drained pineapple, 1/3rd cup raisins soaked in pineapple juice, 3/4th cup oil + 1/2 cup applesauce, 1cup brown sugar 1 cup white sugar. I used two round pans + a loaf pan for baking. My cake broke when I cooked it till just set in the center, but if I let it go for a bit longer, it does not break.

Love this recipe, took it to a church fellowship dinner and every one loved it.  Today I cut the recipe in half due to the fact I do not like thick cakes and this makes a lot of batter.  Love the frosting recipe too and I add pecans to it too.

I use this recipe over and over again and everyone loves it. The only difference is that i spread the chopped pecans on top of half the cake batter coz i like crunchy pecans. The other half has no nuts at all coz my kids don;t like nuts with their cake :) Fail-proof recipe for sure.
Oh. i should mention that i use half the baking soda only coz i dont like the after-taste of baking soda.

This cake was incredibly moist and sweet, and the cream cheese frosting was deeeelicious. I used two 9-inch rounds instead of a 9x13 and baked for 50 minutes and it was superb. There wasn't a crumb left when I took it to work with me!

I made this thanks to the good reviews. I had no problems with the cake coming out thick and moist, but the oil was a bit much. I prefer lighter, fluffier, moist cake. This was just heavy.

I personally think that it would have been better with 1 1/2 cups of sugar, it was a little too sweet. I also think that it would have been better if you had split the oil in half, by using half oil half butter. Other than that it was FANTASTIC!!!! I never liked Carrot Cake until I tried this recipe!

I have made this several times with great results. I used the changes in the "Most Helpful Positve Review". That would be:  using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 3) adding 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (I squeezed out most of the juice before adding it, I didn't want any extra fluids in the cake) 4) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 5) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 6) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. 
For the frosting, I only used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar, and it was more than sweet enough, with a nicely balanced cream cheese vs. sweet flavor. I also omitted the pecans from the frosting. 
My husband said this is the best cake he has ever eaten.

I left out the nuts, used 4c. carrots, and cut down the oil like others; turned out very well (if a bit too moist).

Over the 2 week period I made 3 carrot cakes for various parties from this recipe and stayed with the recipe not changing a single thing. Everyone loved it and was asking for the recipe.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  I found the icing recipe was enough for two cakes. Delicious!!!!

Ive been a member of this website for a few years but actually found this recipe in the preview of the new magazine that's coming out. This is thee best carrot cake recipe ever!! Very moist and flavorful. I wouldn't change a thing. Ok, maybe I did change something. I left out the pecans and it was marvelous! My daughter was thrilled with it as well, she's very suspicious of any cake that contains veggies. I may have converted her...well at least with this recipe anyway. Thanks!

Very good, but I thought it needed more spice.  Next time I'll add some nutmeg and clove.

I made this recipe without the OIL! and no substitute for oil either.  I doubled it, so with all the eggs, and juicy carrots, no need for that oily flavor.  Just fresh, yummy, sweet carrot cake.   It was FABULOUS!

Never made a carrot cake in my life...You would have thought I was a professional baker... Subbed walnuts for pecans, just because that is what we had in the house.  Skipped the nuts in the frosting.  Cooked in a glass 9 x 13, only took 40 minutes.

I have used the same carrot cake recipe for years.  I love it but it takes forever to bake.  So I thought I would give this one a try.  It was great! I did however make a few changes per the other reviews.  I am making a note of them and this will be my new carrot cake recipe.  I used 3 eggs not 4. I used 3/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce.  I used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown. 1/4 tsp salt. And I added 1 1/2 cup walnuts!  I think this recipe will make excellent muffins too!!  Thank you for the recipe and thank you for the reviews!  Allrecipes.com is Great!!!

This recipe is great! I didnt have oil so I substituted banilla (banana vanilla) yogurt for the entire amount of oil and they really were awesome and moist. The yogurt flavor was very subtle and cut back on calories as well. My family was digging into them before I could prepare the icing! I would make these again and again and serve them muffin style next time. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was very delicious and moist. After reading pages of reviews, I made the following changes:
Used 5/6 cup (1/2 + 1/3) oil and 2/3 cup drained crushed pineapple in place of all the oil the recipe calls for. Increased cinnamon to 3 tsp. Used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. Frosting: used 3 1/4 cup conf sugar. 
Baked 37 min. Perfect! Received many compliments. Will definitely make again.

First carrot cake that I have made and I did not &  would not change anything.  It was moist and delicious.  The frosting is perfection and I will keep for other cakes in future since I love cream cheese frosting.  This cake will be my yearly Easter cake.  Thank you!

I transferred this cake into cupcakes, since I love cupcakes, and there was barely enough frosting for each cake. If you choose to make cupcakes, don't use too much on each cake. The cake was fluffy and light and the frosting was creamy and delicious. This cake is very good! I recommend it!

I have tried this recipe and it is the only carrot cake recipe I use. I made a few of my own changes.  Instead of pecans, I use walnuts, the taste combination is better to me.....although, pecans are good, I prefer walnuts.  I also grease and SUGAR and pan and NOT grease and FLOUR the pan.  Once cooled, I turn it out onto a platter so that the sugar coating is on the outside of the cake.  I make the frosting and pour it over the cake and spread it around.  PERFECT!!!

This recipe was in a mailer soliciting the new AR magazine so I tried it without any frosting which adds a lot of calories and fat. And it came out great. Only change was using raw turbinado sugar for white. Only add was 1/2 C of honey (to your taste and adds shelf life moisture) and I threw in 1 C of raisins to give a chew factor. Next time will experiment with some fresh ginger. Frosting would have detracted from the taste

Easy and delicious. The carrots should be grated or chopped very fine for best results. I chopped mine in the food processor and it turned out perfectly.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, using walnuts in place of pecans.  The walnuts were very good, and the cake was good, but noticeably oily for my taste. I will make it again, but use butter instead of oil, and less than called for. I think it was lacking carrot flavor as well. Next time, more carrots.

Great cake! The only thing I changed was instead of adding pecans to the frosting I toasted them in butter/brown sugar and put in between the two layers of the cake. I used two 9" round pans to make a layer cake and only cooked for 30 mins.

I have made this recipe many times, both with and without nuts, and it is always delicious! I have come up a modified version that is lower in fat, but still retains all the deliciousness. It is even good without the frosting, but be warned, if you do make the frosting you won't be able to go back to the unfrosted version. Here are the modifications: 3 eggs instead of 4, 3/4 cup oil instead of 1.5, add 1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown instead of 2 cups white, 3 teaspoons cinnamon instead of 2, add 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I am working on perfecting a version for cooking in muffin cups...will post when I'm happy with it.

Best Carrot Cake recipe!  This is a very versatile recipe too.  I only made it because I had leftover carrots and cream cheese frosting from the holidays.  I boiled a package of baby carrots in lightly sugared water until soft, then mashed.  I don't like nuts in my desserts so I omitted them and replaced with about a cup of golden raisins.  While I was measuring the dry ingredients I realized I didn't have baking powder so I replaced with 1/4ts baking soda (in addition to what it called for), 1/2ts cream of tartar and 1/4ts cornstarch.  Since I had some cream cheese frosting on hand, I didn't prepare the frosting called for in the recipe.  It turned out so incredibly tasty.  I will never make any other kind of carrot cake - ever!

I made this carrot cake exactly as the recipe was written, and it is the best carrot cake I have ever had! Everyone loved it, and I will make it again and again. I grated the carrots finely (I dont like big chunks of carrot in my cake) and the cake was so moist as a result. Big tip though, the carrots stain your hands so use a pair of gloves while grating if you have them. Enjoy

Followed the exact recipe and it came out awesome. Thank you! It is becoming very annoying when people are not rating the actual recipe. Before even trying the highlighted recipe  they are making all of these changes and then have the nerve to rate the recipe and how it turned out based on their own modifications. Really? Post your own recipe or  rate  the original one and then say what you might do next time. It's really getting old!

I'm a huge fan of another carrot cake recipe on this website but this one is just as good! I added one cup of plumped golden raisins since I had them in the pantry.

Came out sweet and moist. I did make a couple alterations, though.
(A) 
Substituted half the oil and half the sugar with about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of homemade applebutter. 
(B) 
Also, juiced carrots and used 3 cups of the "pulp" then added in enough juice to make a good cake batter consistency.


RESULT: Every time I walk into the firehouse for a visit, I am asked to bring more carrot cake. One of the very few things to-date to be requested again and the only one to be requested emphatically.

This is the first time I tried a carrot cake! Don't need to try any other.  Loved it. I did add a cup of crushed pineapple and a cup of crushed walnuts.  I also did 1/2 granulated sugar and 1/2 brown sugar and 3 tsp vanilla. For the frosting I did 3 cup powder sugar, I don't like frostings too sweet.

Definitely got eaten!  My only thing is the amount of oil in this cake.  This will be a very occasional indulgence.  I know that a lot of oil in carrot cake is pretty standard but once I actually made the cake I pretty much let everyone else do the eating.

Everyone told me this was the best carrot cake they've ever had. The only changes I made were 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar jut because I felt like it was way too much sugar and I used crushed walnuts instead of pecans. A few times I added raisens, that depends on if you like raisins or not though. I made it in a bundt pan and sprinkles some crushed walnuts on top of the frosting. :)

This is a good starter recipe. I've altered it to my own taste. I use 3/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugar (I always reduce the sugar in my dessert recipes), used walnuts instead of pecans and added  1/2 cup raisins and a 1/4 cup carrot juice. I grated the carrots too.
The result is a delicious super moist carrot cake, that's just a bit healthier than the original.

This was excellent, simply excellent. Accidentally put 2T instead of 2t of vanilla extract... and it turned out awesome anyway :D The only helpful input I can give would be: don't skip the cream cheese frosting; it was undoubtedly the best part of this recipe.

This cake was AMAZING!  i did see how the it might be better to use the bigger slots for grating the carrots in stead of the smaller, it came out os very finely shredded cheese, BUT, i think it also helped my kids like it more because they couldn't really SEE the carrots.  They LOVE it and keep asking for more!!  the frosting, started out looking liek a glaze.  so i placed it in the fridge for 30 minutes to get a bit firmer, and then frosted the cake.  MUCH better!  also, i used less sugar, about 3 cups instead of 4.  Will definitely make this again!!

An EXCELLENT carrot cake.  While I've tried a lot of different carrot cakes, this is the first time I've made one myself, and it blows all the other carrot cakes away.  I'm definitely going to make this recipe again!

Best Carrot Cake EVER!
I have to watch that I don't overbake it.
I make 2- 9 inch pans- 40 minute cooking time is perfect. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was an excellent and easy recipe! I did go half and half on the sugar, substituting a cup of brown sugar for the second cup of regular. Also, I added a bit of nutmeg to the cake, and lemon zest to the cream cheese frosting (maybe a teaspoon of each). It was absolutely delicious! My dad and everyone in his office loved it.

I put the carrots through the juicer and added half of the juice back into the pulp, it made the cake SUPER moist!  I also like a little nutmeg in my carrot cake, so I added about 1/4 tsp. With the icing I added 2 1/2 T of OJ concentrate. It turned out so delicious my kids are begging me to make it again already!

This was my first attempt at a carrot cake, and it turned out great.  Simple and delicious.  I didn't have enough pecans, so I made up the difference in raisins within the cake, and left them out of the frosting.  It was still a hit!

Great recipe.  It´s easy to follow and turns out delicious.  I made some changes like using only brown sugar and used one teaspoon of cinnammon and one of all spice.  Will make it again.

Amazing cake. I used all of the changes listed in the first review (extra vanilla, extra cinnamon, crushed pineapple, apple sauce + oil, 1 cup brown, 1 cup white sugar, etc). It turned out perfectly. The only thing I would say is that the icing is very sweet. I would almost cut some of the sugar next time I make it, but the cake itself is perfect sweetness, almost not sweet. I baked it for about 42 minutes and it was perfectly moist. I didn't put pecans in the icing, I just sprinkled some on top of the cake after icing it. Great recipe!

This is the first cake I ever made, and I made it for my girlfriend's birthday. It went better than I could have hoped. My girlfriend loved the cake and I scored major points. Simple, easy directions, the only thing I did differently was used 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar.

I have tried twice to make this cake and have failed both times. I am not sure what I am doing wrong, but I was told to "never make it again."

Whipped this out last evening for the family. Everyone quite enjoyed it, saying it was well-made, and I agreed with them as I dug into it myself. I'm only giving four of five stars for the reason that I did not make the frosting along with this recipe and so have not created and tried the whole work as it was likely intended to be made. Also worth noting is that I replaced vegetable oil with olive oil.

Loved it!  I would add golden raisins next time, just because that is how I remember eating it as a kid.  Very yummy!  I also toasted the pecans before adding them to the frosting.  I left them out of the cake.

My family loved this carrot cake and said it was the best they've ever had.  I did make minor changes. The batter seemed too thick so I addded milk to get it to the right consistency. And instead of 4 cups of powdered sugar, I added 3 for the frosting. This recipe is a keeper!!

Just made this today. The cake was good, but 4 cups of icing sugar for the frosting was way too sweet. 1 cup should probably suffice =)

I LOOOOVE THIS RECIPE!!! Amazing!!! A friend of mine's boyfriend made it and I fell in love and so I made it. This is the first carrott cake I have ever attempted and it turned out perfect. HOWEVER, I did make one adjustment that he told me to do...substitute 1 of the cups of sugar with brown sugar. I am not sure what difference it makes..but it was amazing!! I recommend this to anyone and everyone who loves carrot cake!

Great recipe! I`ve adapted this with olive oil instead of vegetable, and 1/2 cup less of sugar. I use Almonds instead of pecans, and I`m toying with the idea of adding orange zest to the next one.

I cut this recipe in half because I only wanted a small cake. The center did sink but I think it's because the pan I used might've been a little too big for it. I also used walnuts instead of pecans because I had those on hand. I added a bit more cinnamon than required and a smidgen of nutmeg. The cake + frosting came out really great! It was my first time making it and my husband and I loved it! Will definitely make again.

I made this carrot cake in a bunt pan for an Easter potluck and it turned out so delicious!  I made the cake part just as listed, but I left out nuts because I have a little one who won't eat nuts.  For the frosting, I just couldn't bring myself to add another cup of sugar to it, so I only added 3 cups (and no nuts).  Delicious!  I will be making this again (and soon!)

This recipe was absolutely excellent.  I halved the recipe and made cupcakes instead of a cake.  Everyone that has eaten one has been completely satisfied.  The cake is very moist and frosting is just creamy goodness.

PHENOMENAL!!!!  my first attempt at homemade carrot cake, and it was amazing.  for some reason this was one type of cake i've never made, and decided to give it a go for easter.  i made two 8" sqaures and layered them, and instead of mixing the nuts into the frosting, i pressed them into the sides of the cake once frosted.  very moist, flavorful, and delicious!

Awesome.  This cake is a perfect balance if cinnamon carrots and sweetness.  The half white and half brown sugar is key.  Mix the icing carefully to only add enough sugar to meet your taste.  For my family to balance the sweetness of the cake we do 3 cups powder sugar.

Excellent, excellent!  I've always shied away from making from-scratch cakes, because I've had trouble getting them to taste right or to be moist enough.  But this cake was wonderful.  (I didn't make the icing, so I can't speak to that.)  In the interest of lowering the fat content, I reduced the oil a little and adding some applesauce and crushed pineapple.  The cake came out plenty moist and rich, so I might be a little bolder in replacing some of the oil with applesauce next time.  The pineapple was yummy, but I may try it without next time--just depends on what you're in the mood for.  I made a layer cake with 9-inch round pans and baked them for 40 minutes at 350.

My husband loves carrot cake, and he said this was the best he ever had! It was so moist and crumbly. Warm out of the oven, I don't think I've ever had such a delicious experience. Also, it's great for cake pops, when mixed with the cream cheese icing. YUM!

Awesome Cake!!!  I have dehydrated foods, so I used some of my dehydrated carrots.  2 c dehydrated carrots, 4 c water, soak for 20 minutes, pour off excess water, then add the hydrated carrots to the recipe as if you had just shredded them. mmm

this is quick and easy, made it in cupcakes. My family loved them. Just an addition, my sis doesn't eat cream cheese so what I did was use Betty Crocker whipped topping, vanilla and chopped some additional pecans to sprinkle on top then shaved some white chocolate over it. Big hit tanks!

Great recipe. I added half an orange from the blender and the cake is delicious. No pecans for me though. Thanks so much!

I love the way my carrot cake turned out fluffy and moist,, i did make a few changes only used 1 and half cups white sugar as that is plenty believe me,, 1 table spn baking powder and 1 table spn corn starch didnt use baking soda,, and vanilla powder 1 tsp rather than the  extract ,,,and i used chopped almonds as thats what i had at the time,,, and it was a fluffy and right sweetness and tastes yummmy for us :)

This is a sensational recipe! Like other reviewers, my cake did cave in a little at the centre and I needed to up the cooking time to just over an hour. Also, I didn't have cream cheese so made the frosting with fat free greek yoghurt. Despite this, the resulting flavour was outstanding!

I have not tried the cake yet, but the frosting is too sweet for my liking even though I only added less than 2 cups of icing sugar.. I made a small 6 inch cake and the rest of the batter into 10 small cupcakes.. Decorated the cake with roasted walnuts and made cute little carrots with marzipan tinted orange and parsley.. Very lovely!

I made the changes that another reviewer suggested: added crushed pineapple, more vanilla and changed it to 1 c. white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I also added some nutmeg and more cinnamon. This is the best carrot cake I have ever had! I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe from this site that is more cream cheesey instead of sweet which is what I like. I will definitely make this again! Thanks!

This was great! I replaced about half of the white sugar with dark brown (only because I was running low on white), and it was still delicious. Of note: I halved the icing recipe, which gave me just the right amount for the 9x13 cake.

Thanks KAELHA! I also want a review of the recipe as is. I am usually in a hurry and need it fast, so don't have time to sift through many reviews all of which seem to change the original recipe which makes me assume it is no good. This was great as written! LIke you I had the wrong nuts (walnuts) but I don't believe that changed the outcome.

Awesome carrot cake...but be warned - the frosting is extremely sweet due to it calling for 4 cups of sugar.  For me, the sweetness actually detracted from the overall flavor. Next time I'll make the frosting with more cream cheese and much less sugar. Other than that, it's a winner!

This carrot cake was wonderful.  I made some changes based on personal preference and the other review- no pecans, 1/2 cup applesauce & 3/4 cup oil instead of all oil, 1 cup white & 1 cup dark brown sugar, added 1/4 t each - nutmeg, allspice & cloves.  I baked it in a 8in springform pan for about 60 minutes.  It was quite the hit.  I have never made a cake from scratch, this will definitely be my go-to carrot cake though I think I will look for a different frosting recipe but there was nothing wrong with this one.  For the reviewers complaining about the changes people make-  Cooking is an art, not an carbon copy of someone else's creation.  I, personally, enjoy reading reviews by others for inspiration.  Even without the changes I made to this recipe it would have been great.

I only made the frosting from this recipe and it was fabulous. I don't use all the sugar called for, but add and taste as I go until I get the sweetness level I want. I've used this frosting on all different flavors of cakes. So easy and delicious.

I'm giving it only 4 stars as I have never ate or made a carrot cake before and I didn't use the cream cheese frosting recipe listed, as I already have a good recipe for that. :)  As for the cake (which I made late last night) I only upped the vanilla to 1TBSP (I like lots of vanilla in my baked goods) and with a lot of reviews stating that they spiced it up a little, I also added 1/8 tsp nutmeg.  I make a very spiced pumpkin cake,bread,bar, cookie recipe that is a big hit here and even though a lot of reviews stated adding more spice I want to keep this close to the original recipe and tasted the batter before adding it and felt it just needed a LITTLE more spice.  :)  I also left out the nuts in the cake part and sub pecans for walnuts that I placed onto the sides of the frosted cake (hubby ate all the pecans).  My recently turned 4yr old said she wanted it for her next birthday cake, until she got to the edge with the nuts.  LOL.  Over all  with my slight changes it is a great tasting cake. :)  Thanks for sharing!

too much baking soda. Fluffy like sponge cake, unlike the usual moist carrot cake texture. I Cut the sugar down on the cake and frosting,  still delicious.So, not sweeter, the better.

This was my first time making this recipe so I made it exactly as written. It was great! However, just to change it up a little, next time I will try some of the changes suggested by other reviewers, such as subbing brown sugar for some of the white sugar and adding a bit of nutmeg and a bit more cinnamon. Overall it's a good recipe!

I love this recipe! I followed it exactly (reduced the sugar and oil a bit) and got a very moist and flavorful cake! Thanks!

The 2tsp of powder and soda surprised me but my daughter, who has never baked before, followed the recipe cutting back only a little sugar in the icing. The result was a moist delicious cake!

1 star,  I am not sure what happened but I followed this recipe exactly and the batter tasted good prior to baking.  However after baking it, it tasted of saly and flour so bad I couldn't serve it.  I read the recipe to my mother and she said 2 teaspoons of baking soda and baking powder is to much.  I wish I would have consulted her first.:(
I frosting is very good will freeze  for another time.

Did anyone else have a problem with the icing? Perhaps I didn't let the butter or cream cheese soften enough but I had to add some milk to make the icing edible.

This is the first carrot cake I've ever made, and it will be the only one.  AMAZING reviews from friends and family, and I couldn't believe how easy.  I used raisins, instead of pecans (not a fan of nuts).  SO moist and wonderful!!!!

This was the first recipe I came across when I started looking for carrot cake recipes. I figured I had so many to choose from if this one was not good. I looked no further when I had the first bite. This cake is super delicious. It has become a favorite in my house.

This is an EXCELLENT recipe as is. The ONLY thing that I changed was the frosting.  I used 3 cups instead of 4 cups of confectioner's sugar. I had coworkers that claim to "not like sweets" fighting for the last few pieces. I'm going to make it again next week for a holiday party at work.

Had to make changes to this one - used 3/4 oil and 1/2 apple sauce. 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar. And only 2.5 cups of sugar for the frosting. 4 cups - waay too sweet. !!

This cake is so wonderful, best carrot cake I've ever had.  It is so moist and just the right amount of sweetness.  I did add a can of crushed pineapple that I squeezed the excess juice from, but I don't think the cake had to have it, I just love pineapple!  Give this one a try, so easy and so good!  I used 3 - 8" round pans so I could stack it nice and high and doubled the frosting recipe.  Had some frosting left over but I wanted plenty for each layer and to frost the entire thing.

Great recipe I changed a few things that I think make it even better... Instead of 2 cups white sugar
1 cup white sugar 
1 cup light brown sugar (lightly packed)
And instead of 1 cup pecans 
1 1/4 cups walnuts & pecans mixed
Perfecto!

I made this recently for my mom's birthday and it was fantastic! It was the first time I'd ever made carrot cake, and everyone absolutely LOVED it! Although I'm still only 16, I love baking and I do have quite a bit of experience since I bake so much, and without exaggeration, my family thought this was the best cake I've ever made. I didn't make any changes at all to the recipe, and it turned out perfect, I highly recommend this cake!

This recipe was a great help and my cake came out moist and delicious.  I did make 2 minor changes, and I suggest everyone try them because the cake was to die for!  Instead of grated carrots, I pureed the carrots and added pure prune juice!

This recipe rocks!  Got rave reviews from the co-workers.  I picked up the pan (made in 13x9) and expected this to be very dense but the cake was very moist and surprisingly not-dense.  I questioned the 3 whole cups of carrot but went for it.  Fantastic.  It's about the only way I'm going to eat cooked carrot!

omg.... sooo good!! I even had to lick the bowl!!! I did as others had suggested, and used 1 cup white/1 cup brown sugar, and I used some fresh ground nutmeg as well, and omitted the pecans, since I didn't have any on hand.  Delish!!! I will definately put this in my recipe box and use it again!!

This was my first attempt at carrot cake. I no longer need to search for the perfect recipe because this is it!! If you like dense, moist cake, this is the recipe for you. I only made some very minor changes after reading other reviews. I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar as suggested and I added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. I also only used 1/2 cup oil and 3/4 cup applesauce. I really think this is what helped make it so moist and yummy (and less calories and fat!!). I made it the night before and frosted it and covered it and stored it in the fridge till the next evening. Pulled it out an hour before serving and it was FABULOUS!! Rave reviews from all . . .even my picky kids! Will definitely make this one again!

I love this, although I didn't make the frosting. I also left out the pecans and I didn't have any vanilla either. It was moist and yummy. I will absolutely make this recipe for carrot cake again.

Yum! Lots of pecans, which my family loves--if yours doesn't, you might want to cut back on those. I think this is the third year in a row that my mom has requested this for her birthday.

My first time making carrot cake and it turned out perfect. I made a layer cake using 2 8"round pans & cooked at 350F for 50 minutes. Put walnuts instead. Great recipe and easy to make. Will make again soon.

Carrot cake was a special request by my husband for his birthday. I am NOT domestic and am terrified when special requests come my way! Luckily baking is my stronger suit. I followed another members suggestions to combine all of the other tweaks (except for adding pineapple) and made my own tweak to the icing. I doubled the recipe since I was making a double layer round cake. My recipe was; 1 cup butter, 16 oz cream cheese, 16 oz light sour cream, 2/3 cup confectioners sugar, blend. My husband usually doesn't like cake due to the overly sweet icing. THIS WAS PERFECT!! Very cream cheesy! He love love loved it!

Excellent, moist carrot cake -- maybe the best I've ever had (no credit to me; the recipe is excellent).  My husband even loved it and he normally doesn't like carrot cake! I did add 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg for a little extra flavor.  Also, I used the recipe for Cream Cheese Frosting II instead of the one included.  Perfection!

I couldn't find Mom's recipe so I shot from the hip with this one for Dad's birthday.  Dad loved it, I loved it, my wife loved it, and her best friend said it was better than his Grandma's.  Great recipe!  Thank you.  I'm contemplating adding raisins next time.

I made this recipe once for my family, they loved it so much i ended up making it for my job and an event for my family which i got the first prize for the best dessert! I dont put all the sugar in the icing because i like it to be more cream cheasy, and i also add some nutmeg to the cake to give it a more earthy flavor~

I made this recipe into muffins-substituting 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup apple sauce for some of the oil.  I left out the pecans so the kids could take them in their lunches.  They were delicious, definitely a recipe I will turn to often.

Made NO changes to the recipe and it was wonderful! We all loved it, including my 5 year old grandson who thought he would not like it (he does not like carrots). He gobbled his piece down. It could not have been easier, either. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

Delicious!  Just made this last night...added a tsp of cinnamon and vanilla and swapped a cup of white sugar for brown sugar.  Also decreased the sugar in the frosting by 1/2 cup; next time I'll decrease by a cup.  So good! Thanks for a great recipe!

Almost every thing I bake is a flop...just don't have that 'thing' some women have and figured I was doomed to have rotten desserts!  BUT, I JUST made this cake and LOVED IT!!  Yay! There IS hope :)

Normally, i hate when people rate a recipe with so many changes that it's a completely different recipe.  But, i did take suggestions found in the reviews (sub'd some apple sauce for some oil, added more vanilla, added more cinnamon and some nutmeg, and the crushed pineapples..see the review below).  it was moist and delicious!  Can't wait until my husband gets home from work...he won't believe that i actually made a yummy dessert ;)

oh, one thing...next time i WILL lower pecan count.  little too nutty.

delish!
i used a springform pan (had to bake a little longer than instructions- about 1 hr total) and layered it with the frosting- moist and tasty.
will definitely make again!

This is my favorite go-to recipe for all the carrot cake lovers in my family.  The only thing I alter is how finely I might chop the pecans before adding.

I have made this twice and both times followed recipe except the first time didn't have any pecans.  It is lovely and moist and everybody loves it.  It did take a lot longer to bake in my oven, but I have a stupid oven anyway.  It makes a lot of frosting and could be halved, though I like a lot of frosting.  All in all a terrific cake, which I will cook again.

I found the cake to be quite dry and bland, I prefer a moister cake than this recipe makes. The icing was very good but didnt quite make up for the cakes lack of flavor.

I have never made carrot cake before but was just craving it so I found this recipe. Wow so delicious. My boyfriend claimed he doesn't like carrot-cake, but he ate 3 slices! I didn't even have the nuts on hands, which would definitly add a nice texture but it was still very yummy. Definitly will be making this again.

I don't eat carrot cake, but I made this for Father's Day and everyone loved it. One person told me it was the best carrot cake he's ever eaten. I gave it five stars for the simplicity of making it. I followed the recipe almost exactly. I used walnuts instead of pecans and I didn't add them to the icing, but topped the cake with them. Lastly, I baked it in a springform pan so I had to cook it an extra 20 minutes.

Best carrotcake ever!! As a lot of users, I replaced part of the oil by apple juice and it was great. I left out the pecans because I am not a fan of nuts.

3.5 to be more accurate. The frosting was way too sweet. If you do not intend to put any pecans, 2 cups of confectioners' sugar for the frosting is more than enough. I have no idea why they call for 4 cups. It is way, way too sweet! Other than that, the recipe is quite good.

This cake was so yummy and so easy! My husband is a health nut so I put in 4 egg whites plus 1 egg, 1/2 cup applesauce, and reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. It came out so perfect and so moist! Thank you!!

This is an amazing carrot cake. It is extremely rich so one piece is just enough. I made it in a 13'9 pan, let it cool, then flipped upside down. I cut the cake into two pieces and put the frosting on the inside and outside. Sooooo good!

This is the absolute best thing I think I've ever eaten.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar and it still ended up super moist, probably because of the oil.  LOVE THIS!!!

Thank you for a great recipe! Sorry about the rating with a lot of changes, but they were successful, so I wanted to let others know. I needed to have my (carrot) cake, and eat it, too! I cut the oil in half and added 3/4 c crush pinapplee, drained. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and I used "white" whole wheat flour. Added a little fresh nutmeg and walnuts, might do raisins next time. Added a couple of minutes to the bake time and it was still moist. This was great by itself, and w/crean cheese frosting. Everyone loved it!

Delish!- I switched up some ingredients to make it healthier by adding low-fat yogurt and apple sauce for the oil, came out great!

Absolutely fantastic!  I also added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and a half teaspoon of nutmeg, plus I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar instead of all white sugar. With the frosting, I added a little orange zest to the frosting which gave it just a touch of spice.  This was an absolutely amazing cake!!!

This version of your Carrot Cake is truly amazing.  My husbank always ask me to make this.  He loves that I add the pecans to the icing.

My first attempt at carrot cake and it turned out great. I used the suggested alterations from gneebeanie and skipped the nuts. I could see where the pineapple added great flavor, but for those who do not like this idea, it's okay to omit. The nutmeg and additional cinnamon are essential. The next time I make this, and I will, I may double the nutmeg to 1/4 tsp and cinnamon to 4 tsp. Instead of grating carrots, the food processor made quick work without the mush other reviewers mentioned. Excellent cake!

This cake is excellent with the changes suggested by other reviewers (replace some oil with applesauce, use 1c white sugar and 1c brown sugar), which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5.  I made it into a layer cake using 8 inch round pans and it came out very nicely.  It was very moist and had a great flavor.  It got lots of compliments at Easter.

This cake got rave reviews from my friends!!  They all loved it.  To cut down on the fat I substituted half of the oil with applesauce which also made it really, really moist.  I also used a less fattening cream cheese frosting.

There are no words for how amazing this cake is!!!
It turned out absolutely flawless. I followed a few suggestions (additional cinnamon, added nutmeg, used brown & granulated sugar), but I think this recipe would have been just as good as directed. I omitted the nuts & skipped the suggestion to add pineapple to make it a little more child-friendly.... Now I'm looking for excuses to bake another! HEAVEN!

Too oily, sweet and bland as written. Icing overkill. You absolutely must make changes to this recipe to get a good cake(more spice, less sugar, 1/2 the icing, and replacing much of the oil with applesauce and pineapple). Then let the cake sit for two days before you eat it. Then it's perfect!

This was my first attempt at making carrot cake and it was a success! I substitued all white sugar for half white and half brown. I also added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg for more "spice". The cake was moist and flavorful! One tip: Don't overbeat the batter!

Great recipe! I used this recipe for my Easter dinner this past weekend and was very pleased with the results. 

The only issue I had was with the center falling, but I'm sure that had more to do with the fact I had to bake it in my RV oven. Most things take a bit longer to bake in it due to the smaller amount of space for heat to circulate.

I followed the recipe exactly as it is, too.

I have made this recipe several times with rave reviews!  I cut down the oil to 1 cup.  Still moist but not as oily.  For the frosting, I use 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar, 4 cups is a little much.  And I substitute the pecans for walnuts.  Will make this cake for any occasion.  It's delicious!

I am making this cake for the second time, it was soooo good the first time.

I took recommendations and replaced half the oil for apple sauce.  I also subbed in 1/2 cup whole wheat plus 1 and 1/2 cup all purpose flour.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon ginger and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.

I have added an additional cup of carrots before and it came out perfectly.  I have a feeling the quantity of carrots is flexible.  I put the batter into 2-9 inch rounds for 45 mins.

I doubled the cream cheese frosting but halved the amour of icing sugar.  When I made the cake the first time, there wasnt enough frosting for the 4 layers, top and sides.  It was skimpy ;). And I like a fair amount of cream cheese frosting, and my carrot cake tall and layered!

This recipe is a keeper, and is flexible to any persons taste.  Was glad to find a recipe without pineapple, but flexible on the nuts and raisins.  Right now, our toddler is in an anti texture mood.  This cake fits the bill!

Everyone enjoyed this one. Made 2 changes though and that was to completey sub the oil for all applesauce. I also used 1 1/2c of Ideal sugar substitute instead of pure sugar. Cake rose beautifully and was moist. Since we are watching weight here it was important to semi-indulge for the holiday but not feel completely guilty. I didn't feel this way after eating this. I really liked it! I used low fat cream cheese too for the frosting.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious! My 4 year old asked me to make a carrot cake for Easter. I never made one before so I took a chance on this recipe. A real winner!  Everyone loved it!  Some changes made:  used 3/4 cup of canola oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce, 1 cup AP flour and 1 cup white whole wheat flour plus added about 1 cup of sweetened flaked coconut.  For the frosting I used neufchatel cream cheese for less fat and omitted the pecans. I also added about 1/3 cup of ground flax seed.  Next time I'll try using a little more applesauce and a little less oil and all white whole wheat flour.  Thanks for such a great recipe!  Now I can sneak carrots into my carrot hating 6 year old's muffins ;)

I can't belive how many positive reviews this cake has.  The baking time is way too long.  The cake crumbled to pieces when I turned it out onto the cooling rack.  The taste was bland at best.  It was a bad experience all around.  I'm off to try the next carrot cake recipe here.

I thought this cake was good but not as great as I would have hoped for.  I made cupcakes and the papers were very greasy at the bottom.  It was kind of displeasing and if I make this again will find a way to not use so much oil (maybe applesauce like other reviews).  I added more cinammon and a pinch of nutmeg and didn't find it to have much spice still.  It was good but not great.

Fiance put it best "THIS IS THE BEST FREAKING CARROT CAKE I HAVE EVER HAD"  lol. Frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II by Janni. So very super moist, sweet and rich. I did add additional cinnamon (3 tsp) but I always add more cinnamon than called for.

This was the perfect carrot cake recipe, but instead of making a whole cake, I halved the recipe and still was able to make 13 normal sized cupcakes. I have to praise this recipe for being easy and simple... and of course delicious! The only changes I made was leaving out the pecans (I'm not a nut lover) and adding a dash of nutmeg. I baked the cupcakes for a little less than 40 minutes and they turned out nice and slightly moist, which was perfect. To frost the cupcakes, I used the recipe "cream cheese frosting II" instead. This was a great recipe for a delicious carrot cake!

Delicious and very moist! I omitted the pecans and used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar. I made them into 24 cupcakes, but I slightly overfilled the muffin cups. They overflowed while baking and later sunk in the middle, but were still delicious. Next time I will soak up all the carrot juice before throwing them in the batter! I covered the tops with icing and green flaked coconut (for Easter) and everyone loved them! If you make cupcakes with this recipe, only fill the muffin cups 2/3 full and you should get at least 26 cupcakes.

I followed the first commetns I saw - adding applesauce (or grated apple) instead of all the oil, used half and half sugars
but recipe is great! would make again!
Less powdered sugar and icing is wonderful 
With the leftover icing i made the pumpkin roll cake from another all recipes recipe!

Excellent recipe I have used several times now I believe it is almost fool-proof. I let the carrots soak in the vegetable oil with all the seasonings while I get everything ready. In addition to 2Tbsp vanilla extract I added a Tbsp of butter extract, I have tried maple extract but found it too overpowering. I also add 2Tblsp of 5-spice seasoning, a tsp of nutmeg as well as a tsp of ginger (neither were in the 5-spice blend sometimes they are) and an additional tsp of cinnamon. I often incorporate raisins or diced dried pineapple along with the nuts and butterscotch chips also work very well in this cake. The dry ingredients I keep the same as the recipe calls for this last time I did add a regular box of instant vanilla pudding just to see the difference but to be honest unless your cake tends to dry out quickly I don't think it will be around long after its done. It did make it a bit more moist and I would only add it again if not making layers I think it was harder to get them out of the pans. Everyone who I have made this cake for agrees it is one of the best they've had. I think the original recipe has a great foundation but the spices really add the gusto. Also not all carrots are created equal - the nice big restaurant quality ones have the most flavor, others tend to have very little taste or even a musty one so be choosy, many people think they will use their 'old' carrots to make this cake and it just isn't always a good idea. Fresh ones are best. Good Luck!

Oh yeah!!!!!!  This is a winner.  OMG!!  It is so delicious and moist.  I reduced the recipe to 5 servings; it is only for my husband and I.  I skipped the frosting/icing because my hubby does not like it.

I liked this a lot. I expected a little more flavor, but it's a carrot cake and not a spice cake. My family was very pleased. I used my own buttercream frosting since my hubby migraines to cream cheese.

Yeah! I found the PERFECT carrot cake  recipe! My husband and kids made this for my birthday and it was fabulous, to put it mildly! They used the changes/additions suggested by the top reviewer of this recipe "gneebeanie." 40 minutes in our oven was all that was needed. LOVED it!!!

Amazing recipe!!! Moist, great after taste and easy to play around with. I subbed 1/4 cup of applesauce from the oil and subbed 1 cup whole wheat flour for the flour in the recipe. I also used a egg replacer and it worked like a charm and subbed 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. Excellent recipe!!!

That was some good cake! Brought it to my mom's 60th birthday party and it disappeared! I took some recommendations and used brown and white sugar, 3/4 c applesauce and 1/2 c vegetable oil and added an additional 1 tsp of vanilla extract to both batter and icing. Also added can of drained pineapple and dash of nutmeg. Used two 9" pans and baked at 350 for about 45 minutes. Yummy!

I made this cake exactly as written with the exception of adding 1 cup of raisins & substituted walnuts for the pecans...This was the best Carrot Cake i have ever eaten.  I took this to work for a co-workers birthday and EVERYONE just raved about how moist and delicious it was!  I have never had some many compliments on a dish before! I will be making this again & again & again.

Great cake! Just a tad too sweet. As per suggestions, I added canned pineapple (juice drained). Also used crushed walnuts instead of pecans.  Remember to not grate the carrots too finely!

When I made this cake for my father-in-law's birthday I was told "this cake is bangin'" and I am not a great baker..so even I was impressed!  It was quite good.  It practically disappeared before my eyes.  I diligently followed the recipe...no substitutions on the cake ingredients.  I wasn't so happy with the icing recipe though.. but then I did use fat-free cream cheese rather than the regular kind.  Learned that lesson!

I must say,  am not a carrot cake, and was making this for a friend, but this was wonderful.  I am giving it 4 stars because I did not like the pecan taste so I will use walnuts next time.  Also, I used a bundt pan and baked it for 75 minutes, but it fell ever so slight in the middle; which is probably my fault, as I opened the oven door to soon, but once you turned it over, you could not tell; but I knew! Since it fell, I brought it to work and my co-workers thought it was devine!!

While all of the suggestions make a terrific traditional carrot cake recipe, I think the idea behind this cake was to diverge from traditional.   I did use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar, and added a 1/4 tsp. of nutmeg and it was the best carrot cake I've ever had. Though there was a little too much confectioner's sugar in the frosting.  I also made the cake using the revisions suggested, but it was too sweet and mushy for my taste.

I made this but did add more spices and used half oil and applesauce.  I did you have brown sugar and white sugar.  I also split the flour.  I used the cream cheese frosting from the recipe.  My 2 yr old daughter loved helping me make this for her Daddy's birthday.  Everyone loved this cake.  Thanks so much for posting.

I've made this carrot cake twice now.  The first time I made it as a sheet cake, and the second time as cupcakes.  The sheet broke in half, and I just assumed that was my lack of baking skills; however, when the cupacake broke apart, I knew something else is wrong (maybe the oven?).  I still gave it 5 stars b/c  it is a tasty carrot cake.  The frosting also adds a rich sweet taste.

Hi there, i followed some of the other reviewers and used 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup white. I found the cake to be a little on the dry side, and i only cooked it for 40 mins. The icing was amazing though!

BEST CAKE IN THE UNIVERSE! My boyfriend made this for my birthday and I thought I had died and gone to heaven. He didn't have the right grater and ended up grating the carrot very finely, and I think it really added to the taste. The frosting is VERY sweet and you can't eat more than one slice because of it, but it would be perfect without frosting as well! When we get married, this is going to be our wedding cake! Delicious! I make him make it for me on special occasions I horde it in the freezer. I think I'll have a slice tonight. LOVE IT!

O.M.G.! Best carrot cake ever!!!!  I've made like 3 times soo far.. its delicious! Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. The cake is moist and hardy. The frosting and sweet and creamy. YUM!  Except i do make a few adjustments.. I add coconut flakes, walnuts, pineapple chunks into the batter and 1/4 C. of pineapple juice from the can I used the chunks from.  For the frosting, I add a teaspoon or so of coconut extract. its delicious! When the cake is baking, i put the frosting in the fridge, until the cake is done baking and fully cooled... then the frosting will be nice and stiffened.. a dream to frost! To finish it all up... I decorate all w/ coconut flakes & cut up pineapple chunks! This is totally a cake I advise everyone to make, a favorite in my opinion! Thanks so much Tammy for the cake recipe! :)

I love this recipe. I've made it several times for my family. The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar on the cream cheese icing. I only use one cup and it still tastes great.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake turned out delicious!  I was really surprised how good it came out being my first try at baking a cake from scratch.  The only 2 things I did different from the recipe was flouring the cake pans and reducing the amount of powdered sugar I put in the icing.  I put about 3.5 cups of sugar instead of the 4 the recipe called for but the icing was still too sweet.  Next time I'll probably try 2 cups of sugar in the icing.  Otherwise, everything was perfect and very tasty!

great recipe, and very easy to make.  however the amount of cake is too much for a normal cake size it needs to be changed to 12 people although doing this does not make a clean distribution of ingredients.

Excellent! The first few times I made this my layer cakes were perfect. When I made cupcakes, they kept sinking in the middle. I was so frustrated I quit making them for several months. Not finding another recipe to match this one in taste, I was determined to figure this out. This time I did everything perfectly, preheating the oven extra early, bringing the eggs to room temp, and using my stand mixer for the eggs, sugar, oil and vanilla. The rest of the mixing I did with a wooden spoon, being careful to not over mix and in fact, I added the carrots and nuts before I had all of the flour mixed in.By the time I had them mixed in, so was the flour. I also filled my paper liners 1/2 full and no more.  I use the match stix cut carrots in the little bags instead of grated carrots. I chop them very small and I think it makes a difference in the taste & texture because I think the grated can get sort of lost. The main difference I made was checking the container of baking powder. Although it wasn't due to expire for several months, I still decided to pitch it and open the new can. Thanks Tammy for the best carrot cake ever!

I made this recipe for a my informative speech (how to) for Communications class. I made the recipe exactly as written and everyone in class complimented me on how good it was, including my instructor! I only put in 2 cups of the confectioners sugar because personally I like the cream cheese taste. Thank you so much in allowing me to bake something so delicious!

LOVE....This recipe!!!! Didn't change much to this great recipe except leaving the pecans out, using Olive oil instead of vegetable oil, reducing the powder sugar in the frosting to 2 Cups & use a food processor to finely chop my carrots (Don't know about you but I don't like stringy grated carrots in my cake)
 I don't no why everyone keeps changing this recipe and added things like pineapple Yuk! I have never had a problem w/ my cake flopping in the middle or it turn out dry!!!  Have made this recipe for lots of Birthday party's,etc. Everyone love's it!   This is a mouth watering Yummy Cake! My 4 girls love this Carrot Cake & so does Mom & Dad :)

Cooked this the other day, compared to the other carrot cake I made, this recipe is moist and soft, and I will use this recipe again. I just cut the sugar to half since I know the icing will be sweet.

I love carrot cake but have never made one.  So I came to allrecipes.com looking and came across this one.  Not only was it easy to make, but it is absolutely incredible tasting.  My kids ate half a cake the first night and I didn't even frost it.  If you are looking for easy and great tasting this one is it.  Thank you!

I loved this recipe! It was easy to follow and easy to personalize. I followed some of the suggestions here (I did 1 cup white sugar and 1 part brown sugar, I also added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and an extra tsp of vanilla extract). The cake turned out so moist and tasty, and it was just the nice balance of sweet and spice. I omitted the nuts.  As for the frosting, I thinking that even three cups of the confectioner's sugar is too much. Next time, I'll cut it down to 2 1/4 - 2 1/2 cups. I cut the sweetness by folding in 3 tsp of calamansi juice. (It's a citrus fruit that's a cross between a lime and a tangerine that's very prevalent in Southeast Asian cooking - particularly with Filipino cuisine) The addition of the citrus flavor worked marvelously in cutting the sweetness and introducing notes of lightness and freshness in a very rich and thick frosting.   Thank you for sharing this recipe. :)

I found the cake as good, but not as amazing as I was expecting it to be. I followed the following suggestions: using 2/3 cup oil & 1/2 cup applesauce, 1 cup white & 1 cup brown sugar, and 3 tsp each of vanilla and cinnamon. I have also tried it using oil and crushed pineapple. Its good, but still feels like something is missing. Will try adding some nutmeg next time.  Thanks for sharing the recipe

This carrot cake was very moist and delicious.  The only thing I changed was to add a little extra cinnamon and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg.  Instead of the frosting recipe given, I used my own maple cream cheese.

First, it's really really easy. My first time baking a cake from scratch and it came out great! I will add more pineapple the next time. i used pineapple "pieces" and they pretty much disappeared in the process of baking. tho i could taste the sweetness from the pineapple, i think i will use bigger chunks next time to actually see the chunks.  the frosting way too "buttery" tasting in my opinion. next time, i will use more cream cheese so that it has a cheesy/frosting taste to it.   overall, it was easy and delicious! will definitely be making it again.

Awesome!  I get raves for my carrot cake.   I make in 2 8 inch round pans.  I cut each layer in half and make the cake in 4 layers.  I have to double the icing for the extra layers though!  It never fails!

This is the worst cake failure I have ever had.  This cake fell.  I was worried when I poured it into the pan because it looked too watery. I should have trown it down the disposal. I do NOT recommend this cake.  Find another site.

I registered for this site just to rate this carrot cake. I've followed many internet recipes, but this is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review.  When my boyfriend and I took our first bite, we  looked at each other and said, "wow." It is so good. It's not a very "busy" carrot cake compared to other recipes (which is partly why I chose it), but it nonetheless delivers simple carrot-cake flavor and a perfect texture. The sweetness is spot-on. I'm not a baker, but I found the recipe easy to follow. I'd make again in a heartbeat.

I substituted one cup white sugar, one cup brown sugar, added one can of well-drained crushed pineapple. I ground fresh cinnamon and used Canola oil.  My family couldn't stop eating the cake--my son said it was "dangerous" it was so good. It made a lot of cake--I created two layers, and found that I needed a tad more cream cheese frosting.

I followed the directions ALMOST exactly. I used less carrots then said simply because I do not like to taste carrot bits when I chew it, but besides that I did as the directions said to. The cake came out great!! It was very moist, did sink a little in the center but the frosting hid it. As for the frosting, it was kind of "runny" I was worried but after frosting the cake, I let it set for an hour before serving. Glad I did because it "harden" up a bit. Tasted great! This is a winner of a recipe!

I made these for my husband's birthday and they were so good I had to make them again the next week. I subbed cinnamon apple sauce for 1/2c of oil and one cup each of white and brown sugar. I also added a few gratings of nutmeg. I made these into cupcakes. When I filled the muffin tins 1/2 full these cooked in about 12-15 minutes. I accidentally overfilled some and they turned out like big muffins after cooking about 18 minutes. I made these with my oven at 325 (I think my oven may run hot so I automatically turn it down a little when baking anything). My husband and all of his family loved them. The cream cheese frosting is excellent. This is one to keep on hand for sure.

After following the recipe as written, my cake was a gummy mess that sunk in the middle.  Taste was one dimensional.  The only flavor I could discern was baking powder/soda.  I checked this recipe against Betty Crocker, ingredients and method are the same, proportions way off.

I used this recipe to make my first ever carrot cake. I changed very little about it, just split the sugar 1/2 brown and white instead of just white. I also grated the carrots instead of shredding them, other reviewers said if you do grate them the cake would come out too moist so I just squeezed thejuice out of the grated carrot and it came out wonderful...definitly competes with bakery carrot cake. The icing however was just a little too sweet so I will cut the powdered sugar to 2 cups next time. I also sprinkled finely chopped walnuts on top instead of mixing them in. I'm going to make them into muffins next. My family loved it! So yummy!

My boyfriend is a huge fan of carrot cake, so this was my first attempt making one for him. Only put 1.5 cups confectioner's sugar in which produced a fluffier, more cream cheese-flavored icing which he loved. "It was delicious," he said. "It blew me away."

This was great, but I of course made it my own by doing the following: 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup light brown sugar, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, added an extra 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and used 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce with 1/2 cup oil. I also made a cream cheese glaze as follows: 4 oz cream cheese, 3/4 cup confectioners sugar, 1 tsp finely grated lemon zest, and a little bit of water to make it into a glaze-like consistency. It was very good, and I will definitely be making it again.

This cake is always a hit with my husband. He doesn't like heavy frosting so I used the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting recipe instead and he LOVED it. I recommend substituting that frosting, much lighter and the flavor is awesome!

Simply the BEST carrot cake recipe you will ever find. I did some modifications based on other reviews: 1) I used applesauce for a portion of the fat, 2) I used a small can of drained, crushed pineapple. I couldn't find my 9" rounds, so I cooked this in a 9x13" pan and when it was cooled I took the cake out of the pan, frosted it with the cream cheese frosting and covered the sides with chopped pecans. I took this to a luncheon my grandma and her friends invited me to and many of the ladies told me it was not only the best dessert there, but the best carrot cake they had ever had! That is quite a compliment from a room full of experienced cooks and bakers. This recipe is a a guaranteed success if you know what you are doing!

When it was cooking in the oven the center sunk, which might have been caused by high altitude.  The frosting was good, but became drippy when put on the cake.

This was a wonderful cake! The only change I made was reducing the sugar in the frosting from 4 cups to 2, but only because I love a real cream cheese taste. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

the first two times i made this it was amazing! however the last three times it smelt and tasted like burnt egg? i used two 9" pans and cooked for 35 mins as recommended. I even bought new eggs, baking soda & powder to rectify the issue but it still is not coming out right.

This is a wonderful moist cake, I only added 1 more tsp of vanilla and put 3/4 oil and 1/2 applesauce and added 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I used walnuts (1 cup), coconut (1 cup), and Rasins (3/4 cup).  I was so good next time I will try it without coconut and use your recommended pecans!! I baked in a 9x13 pan carrots were finely grated and drained very well.  After 43 minutes in the oven, I put it straight in the freezer for 20-30min to make moist. This is the only recipe I have gave five stars.  We all may make a few changes to it but the Base of the recipe is YOURS! and without it, my cake would not have been this great!  Thank you

The family completely freaked out over how good this cake was. Made by request for my husband's birthday and for the first time ever making this kind of cake, it made me a star contributor to his party. People said things like, "this beats every store-bought carrot cake I've ever had" and "I don't usually like cake but I inhaled that cake." And my brother-in-law said he'd invite me to his birthday party so he could have that cake again. Needless to say, this is a "keeper" for sure!

Excellent and very easy to make! I did add about 1/2 of the pineapple juice from the can into the cake batter mixture. For the icing, it does make alot but I like to save it for other recipes. I did have to add more milk to make it smoother.

This is a great base for a carrot cake recipe. I substituted half wheat/half white flour and half white/half brown sugar and added drained crushed pineapple, flaked coconut, raisins and walnuts (instead of pecans). Made it for my boyfriend's birthday and he loved it!

This came out very good and everyone loved it.  The only thing I would say is I baked according to the directions and the bottom burned slightly.  Also, it tastes best to serve warm.  Will be making this again!

The cake was too light that it fell apart even though it fell in the center. There is no richness or depth of flavor. The only good thing about this cake was the frosting.

Awesome cake recipe! I made this at a lodge for the guests and they all loved it. Don't worry if you think there are a lot of carrots. I definately thought it was too much in the batter, but it turned out yummy!

I had never made a carrot cake before and followed the recipe exactly as it was originally (but without nuts) and it came out pretty amazing.  The cake did sink a little in the middle but I don't care about beauty, just flavor.  The icing was a little sweet and made way too much in my opinion but I saved it to use on something else.  Everyone loved it but next time I will try the modifications suggested by other reviewers to see if this awesome cake can really be made better.  We ate it at room temp but later I had it refrigerated and it tasted even better.

I totally agree with KAELHA in that a recipe should be rated as is. I was reading through the reviews here and a few people (you know who you are) changed it up so much it hardly seemed like the same recipe. Write your own!   With that being said, I have this carrot cake in the oven, just as it was written :)  and it smells fantastic! I wanted to get this written while I was thinking about it though, so I'll add a side-note when it gets done as to how it turns out. Side-note: The cake turned out delicious! I have to admit though, after bringing up about people changing up recipe's, I did make one change to this. I used Extra Virgin olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Everything else remained the same, only the oil's name had been changed ;)

This is one of the best base recipes for carrot cake, I made this for someone that is diabetic so I subsituted the white sugar for 1c. Splenda and 1c. Splenda brown sugar and it was just as good as if I made it with regular sugar.  I also followed some of the other suggestions like 3/4c. oil and 1/2c. of apple sauce, 1c. of raisins and 1/2tsp. of nutmeg. Absolutely amazing cake!!

The center kept falling so in the end I used instructions from another recipe (same ingredients different quantities) and then added the carrots and the nuts. 4 stars cause I loved the frosting, tasted great with the cake.

My family and I agree that this is the best carrot cake we've ever had. Perfectly moist, sweet and nutty, and the frosting goes with it so well!  Instead of using vegetable oil I melted 2-1/2 sticks of butter, and I also used walnuts instead of pecans and added 1/2 cup of raisins. Thank you so much for posting-- I created an account just to write this! So easy to make, and so delicious.

PERFECT. I did add a few dashes of nutmeg and all spice but even without this I think it is just fabulous! Great carrot cake recipe. It's my go to recipe from now on!

A very good and very easy recipe! I made this for my fiance who is diabetic but loves carrot cake. To cut down on the carbs, I reduced the sugar in the frosting by half by substituting Splenda for confectioners sugar.  I knew this would give the frosting a different texture since it is not as fine of a granule as confectioners sugar.  To disguise this, I added 1/2 C of shredded coconut to the frosting and it was wonderful! I will definitely make this again.

This was a delicious and moist cake.  I prefer to rate recipes on how it was written (too many adjustments and you are no longer rating the original recipe, but your own).  I made the cake exactly as the recipe instructed, omitting the pecans, and it was fantastic.  In fact, I am making a larger cake for a crowd of 40 this weekend.  Definitely give it a try!

I made this cake for a baby shower and it was a great hit.  This is one of the best carrot cakes I've ever had.  The steps of this recipe are really easy to follow and I made it myself and I'm only 12 years old.

WOW! Are you kidding me? I had no idea this was going to taste as delicious as other reviewers had said! The frosting was to die for! I cut the cake in half and layered it with frosting in between. Two cups of powdered sugar in the frosting is plenty and I doubled the recipe. I used a little extra vanilla in the frosting too. The cake didn't need very much altering at all. I used about two cups of carrots. I rate this A+

My standby carrot cake.  I also add shredded coconut, because I love it.  Sub applesauce for vegetable oil for a bit less fat and good, moist flavor.  This makes great carrot cake cupcakes.

No complaints at all about the flavour.  This recipe tasted better than I could have hoped for - forget about going to the local bakery for fresh baked goods, this trumps it hands down.  The only 2 issues I had with this recipe:  1) Half the amount of icing would have been plenty.  I used only half and I'll probably make another cake for the other half of the icing.  Can you imagine...4 cups of sugar on top of a sugar loaded cake?  Yikes, can't do that.  2) My cake slightly caved in the center. Delicious flavour though!

Delicious!! My first time making carrot cake and it was a hit! My mother who is an amazing cook/bakery tasted it and thought that I bought it at a bakery. One thing I did change was that I added a single cup of pineapple. I would suggest chopping it in a food processor and draining some of the liquid to avoid big chunks. Happy Baking!

I prepared this recipe as written, and I found it to be mediocre.  It wasn't bad, but it lacked a certain punch.  I definitely think it needs more spices.  I also found that it was very oily.  It leaves visible smears of oil on the plate.    The icing was very tasty, although I'd recommend using an electric mixer when preparing it.  I tried to whip it by hand at first, and it was kind of lumpy.  It smooths out very well when using an electric mixer, and I like that even when it's been refrigerated, it is still soft enough to spread.

I have been making this cake every year for my husband for the last 3 years, he absolutely loves it. It IS really good carrot cake, a little on the heavy side but really good. I do add about a cup of golden raisins to it which give it an extra pop of flavor.

Sorry, tried this as is and the taste isn't that great.  It's very soft and moist with a good texture, just don't like the flavor.  Then again, I am not big into carrot cake.  Ok, I gave this one more star because the texture and moistness really are fantastic.  The flavor is good, but not great.

I made this as a birthday cake for a friend who loves carrot cake and she thought it was great! The recipe is the perfect amount for two 9 inch rounds for a layered cake. I made the recipe as is except for just a couple minor tweaks: To cut down on fat, I halved the oil with applesauce and used half brown sugar and half white. I left the pecans out because I wasn't sure if my friend liked nuts in the cake and the flavor was very nice even without them! I ended up just rimming the cake with the pecans as I've seen many others do, but after tasting the combination with the nuts, I will be definitely adding them to the batter next time. So good!  The frosting recipe is great, but I cut back on the sugar by a cup just because I prefer it a little less sweet. Also, if you like a thicker frosting I would suggest doubling the recipe, which is what I plan to do next time. It was so delicious!  Also, my cakes were done after about 20 min. of baking, so make sure to keep an eye on it and don't let it overbake! Overall, this was a wonderful recipe and I plan on making another with the ingredients I have left over soon! Thanks so much for sharing!

This recipe is so good I almost hate making it- because everyone asks for it again and again. I changed a few things like others suggested. Like half applesauce half oil. More cinnamon and vanilla. 8 oz of crushed pineapple. I also use carrots that are ready to go shredded and bagged at the grocery store.

Needed a little more oil when using splenda for the cake mixture.  Also a little less sugar in the frosting.  Otherwise, my son loved it!

This was fantastic!  I made it for my baby's 1st birthday. I used a little less sugar and cut the oil by a little bit, substituting apple sauce.  Best carrot cake ever!

Best Carrot Cake I ever had. I made it for Easter and brought to my in-laws brunch and my parent's dinner. Both families loved it, even the people who normally don't like carrot cake.  Only thing I couldn't do was cool it on a wire rack since I don't have. And I think I should have turned it out onto my serving plates because the middle caved in.  Still tasted the best and the icing was to die for. YUM

My family LOVED this recipe. I think it was gone in less that 24 hours! The cake was moist and rich. The icing was smooth and creamy. My mom has forbidden me to make this again because she ate so much of it!

This cake was good.. my 14 year old made it for a birthday... seemed to me to be needing a bit more spice.. we also did the 3/4 c applesauce.. 1/2 c oil and 1 c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar... no nuts and used 1 can crushed pineapple drained...maybe because we didn't use the recipe icing and just used canned that made a difference. Will for sure try this again though..

This was absolutely fantastic! I poured into two 8" rounds and baked them one at a time. Next time I'll probably use 9" because the first one had a hard time getting done in the middle. Make sure you towel off the carrots after you grate them! It took me a little less than a pound of fresh carrots. The icing was delicious..I did only use about 3-3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar. I followed gneebeanie's review.

I'm not giving it a five because I did substitute. I didn't have pecans so I used crushed about 1/4 cup of peanuts. Also I used 1 cup of sugar and 1 cup of brown like the others. I also grated the carrots larger like other recommended. And lastly I use a can of crushed pineapple and only about 1 1/2 tblsp of the juice. The final result was to die for!!! This will easily rival my mom's carrot cake! Thanks for all the tips! =)

Everyone  always requests this cake it is so delicious and easy to make. The only changes I do are to use 3/4 cup unsweetened appleauce and 1/2 cup oil, also I cut the icing in half I find there is to much.

excellent carrot cake!! made exactly as written except i made it allergy friendly for my son: substitute the eggs for flax+water mix, butter for vegan butter and the flour for a gluten free flour blend.  i had to bake it 25 mins longer due to the flax mix. it was really moist. my kids, husband and i give it 2 thumbs up!

This was DELICIOUS!!!! I didn't make any changes; just followed the recipe as stated. It turned out perfect! My Sardinian husband, our 16 year old, 14 year old, (and of course me) all approved! I was really glad I shredded the carrots by hand and used the larger shredding holes from our cheese shredder. They were the perfect consistency.

This is the best carrot cake. My grandpa's favorite dessert is carrot cake and he has had his share but he says this is his favorite by far. I also took this to a bake sell, selling per slice and all I got was raves and it was the first to go. I did use a lot of suggestions that other people posted. Instead of all of the oil I used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup unsweetened apple sauce. 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. 1/4 tea nutmeg, and 1/2 cup raisins. For the frosting I used 1 less cup of sugar and usually doubled the recipe so I could have lots of frosting and a layer in between the two cakes. Yummy!!

Made the cake as directed without the pecans and it was very moist but not that sweet.  Thought the icing would have been too sweet if I used that much powdered sugar so I increased the cream cheese and decreased the sugar.

I made this for my boyfriend for his birthday and he loved it! He said it was the best carrot cake he's ever had!  I made one 9x13 round and 12 mini cupcakes with the left over batter.  The cupcakes came out so delicious that I think I will make them next week for everyone at work.  The only things I changed were subbing 1/3 cup of the oil for applesauce and replacing the 2 teaspoons of cinnamon with 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and 1 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice.

I made this exactly as written (minus all of the pecans) and it came out delicious! The cake was not overly-sweet and had a nice texture and appearance. My entire family loved it! I will say that I found the frosting to be way too sweet, but no one else had that complaint. I would probably reduce the amount of confectioners' sugar in the frosting drastically next time that I make this to suit my own taste. I can't wait to try it with pecans and less sugar in the frosting next time. Thank you for a wonderful (and pretty easy) recipe.

Yummy recipe! I made this a few times for friends and family and they loved it! The frosting was a little to sweet so I cut the sugar down to 3 cups. I also didnt have pecans so I used walnuts instead and added a handful of raisins. I baked it in a bundt pan and it came out beautiful!

This cake is absolutely amazing!  After reading some of the others suggestions, the only change I made was walnuts instead of pecans, 3 tsp. vanilla, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and a brown/white sugar mix.  The results, yum yum!  I will be making this one over and over again.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us.   Oh, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II reciped for this cake.....I highly recommend it!

I followed the directions exactly.  My cake flopped in the middle.  I did use a convection oven...not sure if that made the difference or not.  The icing makes WAY too much.  Probably a good amount for a double layer cake, but for an 8 x 13, it needs halved.  The taste, however was good.  I probably won't use this recipe in the future.

I've tried many carrot cakes and this is by far the best. The cake is super moist, it can stand on it's own with or without the icing. Delish!

I'd never made carrot cake before, so when my boyfriend asked for one for his birthday I came here and found the one with the best reviews. This cake definitely lives up to its rating. Everyone loved it. I used walnuts instead of pecans.

I made this for Easter this year for my husband's side of the family. I LOVE to cook, HATE to bake, actually not good at baking at all.   I prefer it when people rate the actual recipe, not their own spin on it. LEAVE THIS RECIPE ALONE. It is PERFECT! I can't believe how easy of a recipe.   By far, everyone that ate it (even non carrot cake fans) said it was the best they ever have had.   Yes, the frosting is VERY sweet, too sweet for my taste, but good carrot cakes are sweet.   I can't tell you how good this recipe is. My mother ate it two days later and still said it was the best she has ever had and my Mamma is the most critical person when it comes to food.   Thank you SO much Tammy...

Amazing!!!  I left out the nuts, used half brown sugar and half white. I used some applesauce to replace the oil because I don't like using that much oil if I can avoid it. For the frosting, I mixed the cream cheese, butter, and vanilla together, adding powdered sugar until I was happy with the taste and consistency. I made 24 cupcakes at 350 for 25 minutes. DELICIOUS!!!

i couldn't find any pecans, so just followed the recipe without. Only made two changes: 1c white sugar and 1c brown sugar for the cake part, and only used 3c of confectioner's sugar for the icing part. I loved the perfect balance of sweet and savory with the icing on the cake. Everyone who tried this cake had seconds (some thirds and fourths too!). The cake is moist but oily. Still, I give it 5 stars! Thanks to Tammy Elliot for sharing this recipe with us.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was a HUGE HIT! It's a super moist & delicious cake (although I made cupcakes baked at 350 for about 30 mins) I will definitely make this again.

A crowd-pleaser as modified. Used 3/4 cup oil and 1 cup drained, crushed pineapple.  Added more cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg.  Used 3.5 cups carrot, shredded in my Cuisinart.  Rather than adding nuts into the cake, I dusted the frosting with finely chopped pecans for an easy, pretty finish.

Very moist!  I took other's suggestions and added pineapple as well....but I think it drowned out the spicy flavor carrot cake should have.  Next time, I will either omit the pineapple or double spices.  Good nonetheless!  Thanks for sharing!!!

I have never made a carrot cake before and wasn't sure how it would turn out.  It came out great and was simpler than I thought.  My family loved it.  The frosting was great too.  Would definitely make this again.

This was amazing! Better than a very popular place in town to go for dessert. My family raved about it. I used 1 c.packed brown sugar and 1 c. white. I only had 2 cups worth of grated carrots on hand. I grated my carrots in the magic bullet with water covering them, then strained well. I omitted the pecans from the frosting but loved them in the cake!!!

Absolutely delicious!  Very easy to make.  Took the advice of another reviewer and used Cream Cheese Frosting II.  Did not add pecans, I just don't care for them in a cake.  Got lots of compliments at Easter dinner.

Oh my...this was the BEST carrot cake I have ever tasted or made for that matter! I used this recipe to fill a bunny-shaped cake pan for Easter brunch which worked out very well.  My family enjoyed the cake very much.  Nice & moist..and the frosting was amazing :)

Great Carrot cake. I made it for Easter dinner last night and everyone loved. I used the suggestions from a previous author to include crushed pineapple, applesauce in place of some of the oil, and no pecans in the icing.  I will do some cupcakes/muffins next time.

Absolutely fabulous! This was my first carrot cake from scratch and it was delicious. My husband doesn't like (or didn't think he did) carrot cake. He really liked this one. I like that it didn't have all the other stuff like coconut, raisins, etc. This was perfect, thank you for such a great recipe! It is definitely a keeper!

This cake is amazing! It taste like something you would get at a gourmet bakery. Moist, perfect amount of sweetness. I did not put in any nuts because I am not a fan so that was the only thing I did different. Used Cream Cheese Frosting II and it was perfect. This is a keeper!

I made this recipe for my dad's birthday and it came out great!  It was delicious and had a "real food" quality which was great.  I love carrot cake and this one was every thing you could want from a carrot cake.  The only change I made was a little bit of cloves for spice, which is unusual because I am terrible at following recipes.  I admit I used store bought frosting because I'm not big on making my own.  I recommend this  for anyone who likes real carrot cake.

This is the first time I've ever made a carrot cake from scratch, and I WAS a bit leary about how much oil went into the recipe...however, the cake came out amazing :)    I took some of the tips other reviewers had mentioned (using half brown and half white sugar, adding more cinnamon and nutmeg) and the cake was delicious, even without the frosting! I was a bit concerned about how dark the cake became during baking, but I figured it was because I used brown sugar.    This recipe is a keeper! No more Duncan Hines cakes for us :)

Best carrot cake!  My 10 year old daughter made it for my birthday (with help)- used walnuts in place of pecans and only used 2 C powdered sugar for icing.  SO GOOD!

This cake was amazing.  I read all of gneebeanie's suggestions, and followed them except for adding pineapple and nutmeg (which I didn't have).  It still came out incredibly moist, and the person I baked it for described it as a "great, dense, carrot-flavored cake."  That may not sound too great, but we're scientists!

I have made this carrot cake on many occasions now, and every time I literally have people with their mouth full going, "Oh my god, this is amazing!" After taking all the credit, I smile inside thinking how EASY this recipe is.  Everyone else on here seems to alter so many things. I grate my carrot on the small side of the grater and I don't change the sugar. I only add more vanilla (because I love it) and I always leave out of the nuts. The cake comes out moist and beautiful every time.   I have also made these into cupcakes - rave reviews from my boyfriend and roommate (it's his number one baking request).  Of course, If you want to be healthy, alter it. But if you don't eat it every day, just keep it the same and you won't be disappointed!

I had my 72 year old mother tell me that this was the best carrot cake she's ever had.  That's pretty amazing.  Great recipe....I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown.  Very yummy.

The only thing I did different than what the recipie dictated (based on several other reviews) was to use a combo of brown sugar and white sugar.  However, I did not use 2 cups total.  I used about 3/4 cup of white and 3/4 cups of brown.  Next time I will try even less as it was sweet enough for my family even with this reduction.  I gave 4 stars and not 5 because of the frosting.  It is just okay.  The cake recipie is wonderful and can easily be eaten without the frosting for a bread/muffin like cake.  The frosting is just way too sweet, plus it does not taste like the frosting on carrot cake should.  I am not an expert so I am not sure what it is missing, but it is just not quite right.  Beware, the measurements called for in the frosting make A LOT of frosting.  I only needed about half of what I made.

Super moist, tasty cake! Here's my trick for 'grating' all those carrots - peel and chop the carrots in chunks. Put a third of the carrots in the blender and cover with water about 2 inches above the carrots -- then blend until the carrots are finely chopped. Pour into a fine sieve and drain well. Repeat until all the carrots are done. Voila.

WOW!!! This carrot cake was fabulous!!! Made it for a co workers birthday and everyone loved it. Most told me it was the best they had ever had. It was unbelievably moist. Loved the pecans in both cake and frosting. The only changes I made were as some suggested I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar and I also cut back the powdered sugar in the frosting by a cup. This recipe is an absolute keeper! Thanks for the awesome recipe!!!

My husband loved it so much he asked me to bake another batch before it was done.  I've substituted the veg oil for olive oil and used 1.5 cup of sugar.  It was still sweet (because of the icing) and super moist.

I made this today, and it is absolutely wonderful!! I followed the recipe exactly (although I did not add the nuts, just because I didnt have any) and it was insanely delicious!! I will definitely make this again!! Thank you so much for such a great recipe Tammy!!
****Update****  I have now baked this cake about 10 times!!  For family events, personal friend requests, etc.  For my sisters wedding shower, I added rum-cream to the icing mixture instead of vanilla... TO DIE FOR!! To top it off, I caramelized some carrots (in butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla) and sprinkled it on top!! It was absolutely beautiful! Thanks again Tammy for a wonderful post!!

I made this cake for my birthday today!  My entire family said it was the best carrot cake they had ever tasted.  I was tempted to add pineapple, then I decided not to change one thing in this recipe so I could honestly review it.  If I had changed it, it would be a different recipe right?  Absolutely wonderful.  I'm looking forward to a slice tomorrow with a cup of tea.  This is now the recipe I will use whenever I make carrot cake.

this recipe took forever to make (as do most carrot cake recipes), when I was finished I thought it tasted like a tasty healthy snack. not cake. (I wish Dom the cat stole my snack. that sneaky cat. That will show that sneaky cat. He'll never steal my snack again....see nick jr.) haha

Amazing! I didn't have enough carrots so I decided to cut the recipe in half and bake it in a loaf pan. I also passed on the frosting and it was perfect without it. I wrapped it in plastic wrap to maintain the moistness. I haven't been able to put it down.

I followed this recipe for my first carrot cake - my Fiance (and I) LOVED it! :D  I read through some of the reviews and did change a few things. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. I also used only 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce.. and added some crushed pineapple.  I will definitely make again, real soon!

This carrot cake will always be my go to dessert.  I made it for a super bowl Sunday treat.  It was so easy and the taste was fantastic -- really!  I reduced the oil to one cup and added a bit more cinnamon.  I paired this with my own cream cheese frosting recipe...it was sooooo good!

This was great!! I made this while I was living in Japan and all my friends never thought this would be good....they loved it! They said the icing was a bit sweet...I loved the cream cheese icing. I didn´t put nuts or pineapple in it...I´m not a fan of nuts in baked goods.

I followed the recipe and CYNJAMS advice 100% but my poor darlin' still fell, the first time I made it. Second time around, I added a titch of ginger & nutmeg. I also didn't test it until 50 full minutes had passed; it tried to deflate a little, but it was done at 55". Delicate little flower! I am not a huge fan of how sweet it is, but everyone else seems to like it just fine. May add honey, lemon juice and subtract sugar, next time around.

My first time to make carrot cake. It was very moist and tasty. My husband thought the cream cheese frosting was a little to thick and sweet, it didn't bother me. Carrot cake is very rich and sweet so maybe serve small portions

WOW, I made this for a work birthday/potluck. Every one loved it. There were 3 small pieces left. Personally, I would like more spice. I frosted sides and coated sides with crushed walnuts. It made a great presentation. Don't try to save by using less expensive cream cheese. Use the best...the flavor will pay you back!!!!!! I will make this again.

This was a wonderful carrot cake.  Unfortunately, I was out of vanilla and had to use rum extract but it still was delicious. This cake could not have been any more moist.  I will definitely make this cake again!!!

A very special cake.  We made it as a family project with the kids and grandma, who loves carrot cake.  We prefer walnuts so used those instead.  Used 3/4 cup oil, 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, 8 oz. crushed pineapple, and included the pineapple juice (we needed more liquid since we cut down on the oil). Included 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg.  Otherwise, we followed the recipe.  Really delicious and incredibly moist.

Amazing! My friends who don't even like carrot cake really enjoyed this one! I added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg which you can really taste! Instead of taking the time to grate carrots, I just used baby carrots and grind it in the blender. Quicker and easier!

This is really good. My first time making carrot cake.  Few things though.  I'm not sure why it's just me but I was beating my frosting for a while and nothing was going on other than large chunks even though everything was room temp so I added a bit of milk to make it spreadable.  Worked immediately so I'll do the same next time.  I also added walnuts instead of pecans (personal preference) but I only used it in the batter because I agree that nuts in the frosting is strange.  I do think the nuts add a nice addition to the cake itself.  Last thing, I'm not trying to rain on anyone's parade but substituting applesauce/pineapple instead of oil, yes you are decreasing the fat but you're increasing the sugar on an already sugary cake so it's not exactly a healthy tradeoff.  If you want healthy, skip the cake ;)

This has now become my go-to recipe. My mother, father and husband all request carrot cake on their birthday. I used a recipe for years that was tasty but was missing something. This recipe is INCREDIBLE as well as addicting. This may now be my cake of choice as well! The only alteration I make is to add 1/2 a cup of golden raisins in with the nuts simply due to personal preference. Thank you for submitting this outstanding cake recipe.

This carrot cake was AMAZING! I made it with a few modifications at the suggestion of other reviewers (I used 3/4 c. oil and 1/2 c. chunky applesauce; 1c. brown sugar and 1 c. white sugar, added extra vanilla, nutmeg, and cinnamon; and added a can of crushed pineapple to keep it moist) and folded 3/4 c. raisins into the mixture. I also used neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese for the frosting to cut a few of the calories (not many :)).   It was PHENOMENAL. Everyone who tried it loved it (even my picky friend who hates carrot cake admitted it wasn't bad), and several people told me it was the best carrot cake they had ever had. DEFINITELY going to make this one again!

I looked for this recipe because of my bf's request. The first time I followed everything that mentioned, except the vegetable oil. I added too little oil by mistake and the cake turned out a bit dry. No surprise, hah! The second time I added exact amount of oil as the recipe called for. All of my family and friends didn't like it at all. It was too oily and tasteless. They preferred the first one if I could make it a bit moister. So the third time I added 1/8 cup or 30 ml of oil. Guess what?! It turned out perfect!

5 Stars i made it twice in two days, needles to say it was a big hit. I was having comany over and wanted it to look fancy so i baked it in two rounds for approx. 30 minutes and stacked the layers to make two tiers, i put the cream cheese icingin the middle and on top. To have enough cream cheese for the middle and top i doubled the cream cheese recepi. I will make this recepi again thanks.

Very delicious recipe! The cake turned out moist and delicious. I went with the suggestion of others by adding applesauce and crushed pineapples. I also added a tsp of nutmeg. I baked it in two 9 inch round pans for 40 minutes. I brought the cake to a party and it was gone in minutes. Many people went back for seconds. This is a definite must try recipe!

This earned all the 5 stars! I tried many Carrot cakes before. Found this one and made this as is written with the topping from this recipe too, except I cut the amount of butter in topping in half! Super yummy, moist and even better the next day!!!

This cake turned out amazing. This was my first time making it (or any carrot cake for that matter) so i followed the recipe to a T. The only think I skipped was putting the nuts into the icing. I made it for a work potluck. My new manager informed me that he "hates" carrot cake (lost points for that one) but then he said this cake was AMAZING- he even stopped talking (a first) while he devoured it. So it gets 5 starts. Easy enough directions to follow, simple ingredients & tastes great.

Fantastic. Best served chilled, in my opinion.  Also left an entire cup of powdered sugar out of the frosting and beat it well for a light, not overly-sweet topping.

ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! First time i baked this cake and am also very amateur cook. However it is one of the best cakes i have ever tasted. My whole family agreed. I also input ingredients for 9 instead of 18 servings and it came out fine.

This was great! I followed the recipe to a T and although my center did fall a bit - I just used more frosting. :) Everyone loved it.  I also had left over pecans so I threw them on the top, and it looked great as well as tasted great.  It was moist and dense, which I love.  Next time I will add some raisins, but I thought it was great as is!

I made this a recipe exactly as is but made one minor change, I didn't add nuts to the frosting. I just don't care for a crunchy frosting. What a great carrot cake. I took it into my inlaws house and everyone raved. The cake was nice and moist and the frosting wasn't too sweet. Everyone like it so much I was told I HAVE to bring it for our New Years Day dinner. So try the recipe as it states before you change anything. It's really good.

Very nice. I made this when I got bored (Im 13, you can guess my baking skills aren't as high as others here) and when I was alone. It works wonders with Cream Cheese frosting. My father who dosen't even like Carrot cake adored this cake. One of the best cakes, period.

What a great carrot cake recipe! I made this into cupcakes for work and it was a hit! I love that the frosting ingredients were built right into this one ~ so yummy and a perfect topping too. I will definitely use this exact recipe again!

This was great - moist and had a good flavor.  I read the reviews and used half brown sugar and half white.  I wanted to add nutmeg but I didn't have any, so I sprinkled a tiny amount of allspice in the batter.  Also, I didn't squeeze the water out of my shredded carrots and it worked just fine!

I'm reviewing this second hand, since I made it for my grandmother and didn't have any.  My only change was to only put nuts into the cake batter, because I didn't have enough to top it as well.  I personally loved the icing recipe that goes with this and didn't change any amounts.  My gran told me it was a wonderful cake; soft and moist.  She has a real sweet tooth, so there was no mention that anything was too sweet.  I'll make this again when I have all the ingredients!

It can be the foundation of a good carrot cake, but as is I didn't like it.  Far too greasy.  I agree with another reviewer who said the reviews should be on the recipe as is.  Most of the reviews here seem to make modifications, and it's frustrating to have seen a 5-star recipe w/ 2,177 reviews and not be able to take the recipe to the bank.  I didn't have time to cull through the reviews, company for dinner, lots of carrots in the fridge, and figured:  sure bet!    Next time I also would change the sugar mix to add brown, use applesauce or at least less oil, and ramp up the spices.  I'll also add soaked raisins.

this tastes like the carrot cake your mind fantasizes about! I added a package of vanilla pudding to the dry mix for super-moistyness. Made all the difference.

this carrot cake was delicious, but I am rating it based on using the suggestions of other reviewers and not the actual directions I used 3/4 cup of oil, and 1/2 cup of applesauce. I threw in a handful of raisins and about 1/4 pecans ( all I had). It was very moist and had great flavor. I made the frosting as directed,except I omitted the nuts ( I ran out) The flavor of the icing was perfect for my taste.

I made this cake (as directed) for a Christmas luncheon at work.  I was not impressed.  Someone else brought in another carrot cake that had WAY MORE flavor.  Made it in a 9 x 13 pan and frosted with Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site, which is very good.  The cake didn't have enough flavor and was blah.  Sorry.

Absolutely delicious carrot cake!  I made carrot cake muffins/cupcakes at 350 degrees F for 18-20 minutes.  I also followed some suggestions made by some reviewers: used 3/4 C veg oil, 1/2 C unsweetened apple sauce (instead of the 1 1/4 veg oil); used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar (instead of 2 cup white), 3 tsp vanilla, 3 tsp ground cinnamon, and added  approx 1/4 tsp nutmeg, allspice and ground cloves.  So delicious and moist!  My family and I are not big on cream cheese tasting frosting but made the frosting as is in the recipe except using 3.5 cups confectioner sugar.  The frosting tasted better the second day as the cream cheese taste dulled a bit in the fridge.  if you make cupcakes/muffins, use cupcake liners for an absolute easy clean up!  So yummy and delicious - will definately make again and again.

this cake was moist but lacked flavour. I was very upset since I was making this cake for my school's charity bake sale and I wanted to impress people. Where I live, carrot cake isn't common and people grimace at the thought of having vegetables in a cake, so I wanted to make people eat it and then they would realise how good it was. The problem was that it wasn't good, and one more time, chocolate was the most popular cake, and my cake was ignored.

This cake came out SOO great!! USE SOME (not even half a cup) BABY FOOD AS WELL AS GRATED CARROTS- it came out so moist that way. I took out the nuts because I had some pecan allergies in the family, but kept everything else the same and it still came out tasty. Gneebeanie's review REALLY helped- she gave some good tips on extra additions. DELICIOUS and easy!

It's perfect just the way it is, very moist. I did some changes to make it a bit healthier (I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar). I followed some of the other readers sugestions. My husband loves it too!! Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful carrot cake! Moist and yummy. Don't hesitate to give this recipe a try. I did make a couple of small changes by adding nutmeg to the cake and reducing the amount of icing sugar to 2 cups with respect to the frosting. This is a keeper.

Very good!  I took the advice of other raters and added some extra stuff.  Everyone loved and they thought it was so fancy with the nuts sprinkled on the top.  I actually thought the cake tasted better after sitting in the fridge overnight.

Really really good carrot cake.  I modified the recipe to be more diabetic friendly, and even with the modifications it was super good.  I substituted spelt flower for regular flower, and xylitol for sugar.

Ok...I made this Carrot Cake for my son's 5th birthday party. The following day I had several phone calls asking if there was any left over that I would share. I even impressed my Father-In-Law, whom I vowed to never cook for again...He actually said it was "Out of this world". Thanks for sharing the recipe! This is the only one I will use from now on.

Great cake! I utilized some of the other reviewers suggestions and also used brown sugar splenda in the recipe it was wonderful. I made the  bourbon cream cheese icing recipe from this site.....used butterscotch schnaps instead of bourbon and reduced the p. sugar to 2.5 cups.....was WONDERFUL!!!!  Thank you!

A really good recipe.  The first time that I prepared this recipe, I had too much batter.  I halved the recipe and was able to get two cakes from round pans.  This made it much more manageable.

Very good and easy to make. It stayed moist for days! I made it without pecans and with extra carrots, which worked out great. However, it needed to cook much longer than indicated in the recipe.

This was a hit for our early Thanksgiving meal. I added 1/2 cup of drained crushed pineapple and 1/2 cup of raisins. I used three small round cake pans for a triple layer.

Made this for a spring picnic and got rave reviews.  One guy even called his mother and told her he found a better carrot cake, I think I'm in trouble... Everyone volunteered to take home extra, and 6 months later I still get called the Carrot Cake guy in conversations...

I read all these great reviews and couldn't believe people didn't mention how oily the cake was. Too much oil. Too much salt. I'll try it again substituting some of the oil and with less salt, and see how that goes.

I previously reviewed this recipe and wanted to add a note out here as I made the cake again, but this time with a change to substitute pumpkin puree from a can instead of using the oil and it was even better!  I did the substitution so I could reduce the calories, but to be honest, I liked it better than the oil since the oil made it a little heavy and overly moist.  Now if I could only reduce the calories of the frosting waaaaaayyy down!

I've tried various carrot cake recipes and i thought this one was very good! I didn't have any pecans so i used walnuts! Even without the topping its tasty..but i would recommend using a pinch of salt instead of 1/2tsp of salt, if not adding the topping. Up the cinnamon to 3 tsps like others have suggested.Fool proof recipe. Definitely a keeper!

Great carrot cake...I also did 1 cup white sugar & 1 Cup brown sugar and upped the spices..the only thing I had a problem with is the middle of my cakes fell down. I followed the directions..preheated my oven and never opened the door until the timer went off.. Oh well..still very yummy though.

Oh. My. God.  This is heavenly.  Carrot cake is my favourite kind of cake, but here's how I changed it a bit: I did as others suggested and used half white and half brown sugar and used more spice, increasing the cinnamon by only 1/2 a tsp, then added 1 tsp of allspice and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg.  I also cut the oil down to 1 cup, and used a big more carrot.  I didn't add any extra fluid, though.  I had to substitute walnuts for pecans, but I roasted them first to bring out more flavour.  Finally, I made a much simpler cream cheese frosting: mix 200g cream cheese with 1 1/4 cup icing sugar and add some vanilla. et voila, perfect icing!  I don't like butter in my cream cheese icing :)  It's plenty sweet with tons of the cream cheese flavour this way.

Instead of making one two layer cakes, I separated the layers out.  Then I accidentally ate one of the layers.  Didnt make that many changes, but did add the 8 oz can of crushed pineapple.  I think the frosting did it - I used less sugar, but it was still great.

I messed the recipe up (added 2cps pecans to batter) and it was still phenomenal!  Prior to this I felt that nothing topped my Cheesecake Factory Experience, but this is definitely a recipe to take notice of.  Yum!

Great recipe!!! I did make a few minor changes after reading many reviews. Instead of 2 cups of white sugar I used 1 each of brown and white, added and extra tsp of each vanilla and cinnamon. It was moist and delicious and really doesn't even need frosting although the frosting is great minus that 1 cup of powdered sugar as others have suggested. I have made this recipe twice in less than a month and it never lasts more than two days. Everyone loves it!

I made this recipe as cupcakes for my children's pre-school class. They made a great alternative to the usual sugar-laden store-bought cupcakes. They were a hit with the kids, the teachers and the parents! The only change I made was to substitute apple sauce for half of the oil. Great recipe! Will use it again!

HIGH ALTITUDE DETAILS: I live in Denver, and the only thing to be wary of is the cooking time, it really only needed about 30 minutes, so be careful. This was greatl Made it for my office and my fiance. They all loved it! I didn't put nuts in the frosting though, however I put a little extra in the cake part. Turned out wonderful.

RAVE reviews all around the office! I made half the sugar brown instead off all white like others said. I also added 1 C. coconut and a small can of (squeezed) crushed pineapple and substituted walnuts for the pecans. I made it into a round layer cake; the 2- 9" layers were dense, but I think I would have liked it to be a little higher- maybe next time I will do a double recipe and make 4 layers... leaving one to keep at home ;)  Oh, I almost forgot, I sub'd 1/2 C. applesauce for 1/2 C. of the oil like many others did. Thank you, Tammy!

Incredible!  Instead of making this in a cake pan, I made 24 cupcakes.    I made the recipe with the changes that the previous reviewer "gneebeanie" used and it turned out excellent!  It's moist, and very flavorful.  I used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 for the frosting and it's just the right taste.    The whole family loves it and I will use this recipe from now on when making my carrot cake!  It's much better tasting than anything you buy in a store bakery and better than any box mix. Thanks so much for sharing.

Great! I love carrot cake and this is wonderful. For the icing I listen to everyone else and used only 3 cups of sugar. The receipe calls for 1 cup of peacans. I wished I had not used peacans in the icing. It was tooooo much. I would only suggest using peacan in the cake. My husband didn't like all then uts. Each day the cake was better. I would make it the night before the actual event in the future.

This is the BEST carrot cake recipe ever!! I'm a novice baker and it has turned out perfectly for me twice now. I will always use this recipe for carrot cake - it's always a HUGE hit! Just a couple of things that I found I liked. I leave OUT the chopped pecans from the cake and leave them IN the frosting. YUM! I also have used 3/4 c. vegetable oil and 1/2 c. applesauce to make it have a little less fat and I couldn't tell any difference. Both times I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown (rather than 2 c. white) for the "spice cake" sort of taste and added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg. The first time I tried 1/2 all-purpose flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour. It turned out just fine, but I liked the flavor a little better with only all-purpose flour. Also - my oven cooked it completely in 35 minutes, so check it early or it may overcook! Highly recommed!

This is an absolutely amazing recipe! However, I did make a few adjustments. I only used 200g of brown sugar for the cake and about 180g of icing (confectioner's) sugar for the icing. I only added about 40g of butter to the icing, which I felt was more than enough (115g was excessive in my opinion). I also added one more teaspoon of vanilla essence to the cake, as well as some chopped (and squeezed of the excess juice) canned pineapple. Delightfully moist and super delicious! The cream cheese icing contrasts beautifully with the best Carrot Cake I've ever tasted! 5 stars for sure!

WOW!  What a cake!  My husband and everyone who tried it.  I changed the recipe based on a consolidated review and it worked out great!  I followed it except for adding the 1/4 tsp of nutmeg.  I will try to lessen the fat content by using more applesauce or making other substitutions.  This recipe is a keeper.

Hi...This is an Excellent recipe. I made it and having never made carrot cake before, it came out divine! I like more cinnamon so I added 1 tsp more to the mix. The cake was moist yet firm. Frosting: Unbelievably good! Thank you very much for this recipe. Guy

I made this for my husband's birthday cake. He always asks for carrot cake.  Everyone loved it!  I substituted half the white sugar for brown sugar, added a little pumpkin pie spice, and added one can of crushed pineapple (squeezed out the juice).  It was so moist!  Please note that you should really make sure the cake is cooked in the centre before you remove it from the oven.  I had to bake mine for an hour before it was completely set... but still very moist!  Also, this is way too much frosting... I froze some (it's too good to throw away).

Delicious cake! By far one of the best carrot cakes I've tried. I followed the recipe as it is I just substituted pacans with raisins. Everyone at home loved it. I will definitely be making this cake again soon. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I have made this cake several times.   It has been a hit everytime.  If you are making this cake for the first time, I recommend that you don't change any of the cake measurements, but that you gradually add the confectioners sugar to the frosting mixture to get the right level of sweetness for you.  I did this the 2nd time I made the cake and found that 2 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar gave me the perfect amount of sweetness to pair with the cake.

One of the best carrot cake recipes ever.  I made most of the changes suggested by other reviewers - reducing oil to 3/4 c. and adding 1/2 c. applesauce - a biggie.  The cake was still amazingly moist and yummy. Also, used only 3 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting - perfect.  Boyfriend loved his Birthday cake.  Thanks to all.

I made this as a birthday cake for my mother, and she loved it! I followed gneebeanie's recipe alterations almost exactly. The only change I made was instead of 3/4 cup of canola oil I only used 1/2 cup, with a full cup of applesauce. I didn't add the pineapple juice either, but it was perfect. Moist and flavorful, and the cream cheese frosting is just sweet enough without being total overkill.

Ok, so this recipe came out good. I made a lot of alterations though to cut down on fat and calories. 1. Replace eggs with distilled white vinegar, one tbsp for each egg so 4 tbsp total. 2. Replce oil completely with unsweetened applesauce, equal conversion. 3. Cut sugar in half, and used brown instead of white. Even though applesauce is unsweetened it adds enough sweet taste. Other reviews helpful with a lil more vanilla and touch of nutmeg. I also tossed in raisins 'cuz, well I'm jsut used to that in carrot cake. Also, a little bit of water (less than 1/3 cup) was added. Cake came out very nice!! Didn't get around to doing with frosting yet.

My husband's favorite cake is carrot cake & he loves this recipe(even though he hates carrots!)  The only changes I made were to add a little nutmeg and ginger & I shaved the carrots down (like I was peeling them) & then put them in the food processor. This is the cake I make for all of his special days.

Simple and delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.  When I made it, I cut the recipe in half, poured the batter into a 9in round pan and put it in the toaster oven on 1000W for 15 minutes... then brought the temperature down to 500W and cooked for another 10 minutes.  It came out perfect.  So good!

Very delicious & moist I did use some applesauce instead of all the oil & it came out great. Would not change a thing. I only frosted the top & a layer in between the cake layers & it was the perfect sweetness

I love, love, love this recipe and so did everyone that I shared it with! Everyone thought it was bakery-made!! It is a recipe I'm keeping and will make over and over. I will use a little less oil next time though. To try and make it healthier!!

This is a VERY delicious recipe. I made it for my grandpa's girlfriend's daughter's birthday and it sure was a hit. The only thing I did differently was I used a different cream cheese frosting (which really wouldn't have made a difference) and I used a little more cinnamon because I am a NUT with cinnamon. The cake was a little bit too wet and then a little to crispy on the outside, but overall I give it a thumbs up.

When my husband requested carrot cake for his birthday dinner and I knew I had already lost my favorite recipe years ago, I jumped to the computer and got this one, served it up to my family the same evening warm from the oven and there was not a crumb left!!  I took someone's advise and increased the cinnamon, left out the nuts, and cut the sugar down to 1/2.

Great Carrot Cake! I did use half brown sugar for the sugar. Loved everything about it. Great texture, very easy to make and great flavor. My husband's favorite.

My recipe is the same, except it has:   1 8-oz. can crushed pineapple, drained, and    1 1/3 cup toasted coconut. These add extra texture and interest, if you like coconut and pineapple.  Drain the pineapple really well if you use it.  I make it in 3 8" layer pans and decorate with orange and green cream cheese carrots.  I tint some of the frosting and squeeze it out of a Ziploc.  Makes a nice cake for company.

AMAZING!  I made this for my boyfriend's birthday and he LOVED it (and so did I).  I also used some drained, crushed pineapple (I love pineapple in my carrot cake too!!) and frosted it with cream cheese frosting. I meant to use part brown sugar, but forgot after I dumped in the full amount of white sugar...it still tasted great.  I will without a doubt use this recipe again...maybe my favorite one from this website so far!

After saving this to my recipe box I FINALLY made it about a year later! I was a bit scared as I had never made carrot cake before but it was actually easy. I didn't have a grater so I just used carrot peels and cut them smaller. If I make again I think it would be better as a layer cake so you get more of the frosting in each bite. I also would skip the pecans in the frosting..I love pecans but it was a bit too much crunch for me. Great recipe!

AMAZING!  This carrot cake is great...even better when made the day before.  Made the recipe as written, but did use 1/2c. of applesauce to reduce the oil.  Used 2 round cake pans to make the cake layered.  Wonderful....thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe and have even added unsweetened coconut to the batter (have not perfected this, the extra moisture needs to be adjusted for).  I took several of the pieces of advice given below and incorporated them in.  Instead of 2 cups white sugar, I use one cup brown sugar and one cup white sugar, I also add 1 tsp Vanilla, 1/4 tsp Nutmeg and 1 tsp Cinnamon...and sometimes a bit of ginger.  I don't add the pecans and I always drain the carrots (squish them) well.

I'm would have given it a five for taste, but i knocked a star off because it's so hard to work with. I can't believe i'm the only one who had trouble with this recipe.   i had to make this twice because the first batch collapsed. i baked it last night in two 8 inch rounds at 350 for 50 minutes, the toothpick came out clean, i let it cool for half hour and when i came back in the kitchen to make the frosting, they had completely collapsed in the middle. the cake was not even close to being done. My oven is true to temp, and i bake all the time so i was baffled.   i wouldn't have wasted my time making it again, but i tasted a chunk from around the edge and it was so good i had to. I was making it for a birthday today so i made it again this afternoon. i baked them for 60 minutes and they were still not quite done so i turned the oven off and left them alone for two hours.   I pulled them out of the oven and let them cool for 20 minutes and then ran a knife around the edge before turning them out. the first round broke in half and stuck to the bottom of the pan. i was more careful with the second one and it came out better, but it was still mangled, which only made it harder to frost. This cake is like a brick it's so heavy.   but it is delicious!

It turned out great even w/o frosting.  Even my daughter, who almost didn't try a piece b/c of the carrots, loved it.  I left out the nuts (kids won't eat them) and used 1/2 brown & 1/2 white sugar but otherwise stuck to the recipe.  I would like to try using some applesauce in this as other reviewers suggested, just to make it a tad healthier.

Wow! Thank you for this recipe Tammy! This is soooo simple and turns up trumps! The only thing I did differently to the recipe was using nuts that I had on hand, a smashed mix of hazlenuts, brazil, cashew, almonds and walnuts. My whanau (family) polished this off in one sitting! Kiaora!

I used all the substitutions suggested by the previous user (pineapple, applesauce, etc).  WOW what a great carrot cake.  I made a wedding cake out of this lovely recipe, and filled the inside with pineapple whipped cream.  Delicious.  Everyone raved about it for weeks.

This was such an excellent recipe. I did not change one thing except for omitting the pecans in the frosting and only using 3 cups of the confectioners sugar. Also, in my oven it needed to cook the full 50 minutes. It was the best carrot cake I have ever made. Thank you!

I expected to get a more of a carrot taste, but I guess carrots taste more like carrots when raw. I halved the recipe and added more vanilla, cinnamon and extra nutmeg as some reviewers suggested. And left out the nuts. But I should have also substituted applesauce.  The cake is a bit greasy and the frosting too sweet, even though i lessened the confectioner's sugar.

I added whipped cream to the frosting to make it lighter (because it's so darn hot out), and substituted 7/8 cup whole wheat flour for each 1 cup of all-purpose flour in the cake. It was *divine*. Raisins, had I had them on hand, would also have been awesome!

I have made this cake plenty of times and it is wonderful. The only changes I made was I left out the pecans and I only used 1 cup of confectioner's sugar for the icing. When 4 cups are used it overwhelms the cream cheese and you can barely taste it.

I also cut down the oil, i added 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup oil, couldnt even tell the difference. the cake still turned out extremely moist and delicious. I added some fresh grated nutmeg and doubled the cinnamon, because i like it spicy.

Mmmm Mmmm, this Carrot Cake is YUMMY! I did make some changes though. I love brown sugar so I did 1 cup brown sugar 1 cup white sugar and I substituted the oil with apple sauce and it still tasted great!

For a healther option, but yet still absolutly yummy and incredibly moist, subsitute the oil for 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil. Also it is sweet enough with the apple sauce to leave off the frosting!

The best carrot cake ever!!! Great with the full amount of oil, but subbing half for applesauce works fine too.  I didn't add the walnuts, but it was still moist and delicious!

Super moist!!  The flavor of the cake was really good but mellow.  Needed something, perhaps more spice?  ***UPDATE: I have to say, this cake was even better the second and third day!  Definitely keeping this recipe.

THIS IS AN AMAZING RECIPE!! Its my husbands favorite! I also added nutmeg (its an excellent addition!) It does take FOREVER to grate the carrots, but it is well worth it! Hang in there! It makes an awesome birthday cake, but the trick is to keep others from swiping their fingers in the decadent frosting!!

With 1,000+ plus good reviews, does it really need to be said?! Absolutely wonderful. Only thing I changed was adding 1/2 tsp of cloves for some extra oomph. Left out nuts because I don't like them. AMAZING! Thanks for sharing!

The best carrot cake recipe EVER - I did take a shortcut and use already cut matchstick carrots, but that's a preference, it makes the cake a bit heartier. Other than that I did not change a thing on the cake recipe, my family thinks it's the best carrot cake (kids say cake in general) I've ever made. For the frosting I used Cream Cheese Frosting II because I like a more cream cheese frosting on carrot cake.

Made this cake for my son's first birthday as I wanted to try this recipe for a long time.  I followed people's recommendations (1 c brown and 1 c white sugar, more vanilla, added crushed pineapple, added nutmeg, more cinnamon, used applesauce to decrease the amount of oil, and cut the icing sugar to 3 cups).  Baked the cake in two 9 inch pans for ~35 minutes.  The cake was delicious!  So moist and flavorful.  My husband said it was the best carrot cake he's ever had and my relatives all thought it was very good.  I would definitely make this again.

This is a great, fluffy, and flavorful carrot cake.  Everyone that's tried this loves it and asks for seconds (or thirds).  I sub 3/4 of the oil with a peeled, grated apple.  I've never tried the frosting. I use 1 8-oz block of cream cheese, 1/2 stick of butter and about a 1/2 t. vanilla extract, beaten until very light and fluffy.  Then I add powdered sugar until I get the consistency and sweetness that I like.  Thanks for such an amazing recipe!

I am so glad to have this recipe!  I made it for my nephew's birthday, not knowing carrot cake was his favorite.  He was so thrilled, and I was praying it tasted good when we cut it...and it came through!  He's already designated this cake as his birthday cake from now on.  It is really fabulous. Thanks for the recipe!

I just made this cake last week and it was so delicious. Very moist and the icing was awesome. The only thing i did different was i used hazelnuts instead of pecans (personal preference) and i made the cake in a bundt pan. I heating up the icing a little bit in the microwave so i could pour the icing over the cake. very delicious!!!

I have never made a carrot cake, especially from scratch, but my best friend's birthday was the other day, and his favorite cake is Carrot.  I did not make any adjustments to the recipe, and it turned out beautifully!  This is one recipe that will be added to my favorites!  Thank you so very much for sharing!

Made as said in the original recipe and was a hit at a party.  It tastes best after it's been in the fridge.  Don't over bake it.

I added the pineapple as suggested in other reviews as well as added more vanilla and cinnamon. Next time I will divide the white and brown sugars. My oven only required 35 minutes baking time in two 9" round pans. As the case in most recipes the flavor was even BETTER the next day so would suggest making the cake day before you are serving it!

I used unbleached WHOLE WHEAT FLOUR to up the nutritional value and it still came out fantastic.  I like more of a cream cheese flavor in my frosting so I used only 1 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar with the 8 oz. of cream cheese, and the 1/2 cup whipped butter. I too followed suit with 1/2 cup applesauce with 3/4 cup canola oil, 3 teaspoons vanilla, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. Added 1/2 cup of raisins and 3/4 cup walnuts instead of pecans. YUM.

This is a very moist and flavourful cake. Even people who "don't like" carrot cake eat this up.

This is a GREAT carrot cake!  I made this for a co-workers birthday and he (and everybody else) is on their 2nd or 3rd piece.  He had never heard of putting crushed pineapple or coconut into a carrot cake, so here I went on search of a new recipe - thanks to everybody who raved about this one because it convinced me to try it.  I made it as the recipe stated and wouldn't change a darn thing!

This was the most awesome carrot cake I've ever made!  Everyone loved it, so tender and moist...the frosting is to die for.  Didn't use nuts (allergic), made with increased cinnamon and vanilla, per other suggestions.  Scrumptious!

Very good and not too hard to make. Mine fell a little in the middle, but I just filled in the indentation with more scrumptious icing. Like others, I used 3.5 cups icing sugar. I also toasted the pecans for the icing and sprinkled them on top rather than mixing them in. Thanks!

This is an awesome carrot cake. The first time I made it this week I didn't have any applesauce in the house so I used a cup of the oil and it was plenty, there isn't any need for that amount of oil. I didn't use nuts only because I just don't like nuts mixed in food. I did follow the suggestion of 1/2 brown sugar and added a touch more cinnamon, yummy, my family ate the entire cake in two days and bugged me to make it again. I did it this time with applesauce and my picky DH didn't even notice. Also the first time the centers dropped, I used 2 9", this time I beat it less and I think without the oil helped, it came out beautiful the second time. This is a keeper and my 3 y/o asked if I can make it for his birthday cake in a few weeks, how darn cute is that. Thank you for the great recipe!

I made the recipe as written, except I used walnuts instead of pecans. It was definitely a good cake, but next time I think I'll increase the amount of grated carrots and use a lot less vegetable oil (the cake was incredibly moist, even after dehydrating the carrots). The cream cheese frosting was superb.

I made this for Easter and was very happy with the recipe. I used half white and half brown sugar and replaced 1/4 cup of oil with unsweetened applesauce. Greated the carrots on a cheese grater and added a little more vanilla. I used only three cups of sifted confectioners' sugar and no nuts in the frosting. Very nice results. Thanks.

I used half white flour and half whole wheat....awesome!!  Used 3/4 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar, because I knew the frosting would make it sweet enough.  1/2 c. oil and 3/4 c. milk. More spices. No nuts, it was for a birthday, and I didn't know who could eat nuts, so I just topped the frosted cake with chopped walnuts.   For the frosting: 1/4 c. butter, 4 oz. cream cheese, about 3 c. powdered sugar, 1 tsp. vanilla, and a bit of milk as needed to make up for the lower amount of butter and cream cheese.

OHMYGOODNESS.  Perfect carrot cake.  I made two substitutions which, I think, only made it better.  1. half brown, half white sugar.  2. half oil/half applesauce.  That's it. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMY.

absolutly AWSOME !!! I totally followed the recipe and the few additions were a 1/2 cup of Risings , 2 teaspoons of ground cardamom , 2 teaspoons of ground Anise ... skipped the frosting for a 1/2 cup of grated coconut sprinkled over the top before baking to kill some calories ^_^ , and the smell filled the house was HEAVEN ... as for the taste.  thank you for sharing this great recipe !

This cake was easy to make and the result tasted marvelous. I received many compliments, in fact most people thought I had bought, not made this delicious dessert. I highly recommend this recipe!  I took special care in decorating this since it was the centerpiece for a big dinner I was hosting:  I made a double-layer carrot cake with circular pans with this recipe. I made a little extra icing for between the layers and the decorations on top, but I discovered that the original amount probably would have been enough.  Instead of mixing all the leftover pecans into the icing, I mixed a few into the icing, sprinkled a few in the center of the top of the cake, and pressed the remainder into the sides of the cake.  I then used the technique illustrated in a video on here how to create carrots out of icing to decorate the top.

I had never made a Carrot Cake before and I made this one for Easter. My family couldn't believe that it wasn't bought in a bakery! It was the best tasting Carrot Cake! The icing was perfect too. I used alot of the revisions that were mentioned in a couple of other reviews and it turned out perfect!

This was my first attempt at carrot cake from scratch and this turned out wonderful. I made this for my mother on her birthday and she said it was the best carrot cake she ever had. It was a huge hit with everyone else, too. I had zero problems with the recipe, it came out beautifully. I will definitely make this again!

Awesome cake.  I made it for easter and everybody loved the cake and the frosting.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I made 1 small change: I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown.  I followed the recipe for everything else.

Made this for my Dad's 61st birthday.  Carrot cake is his favorite and he really enjoyed this one.  I left the nuts out due to personal preferance.  I only had about 3 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting but it seemed to turn out just fine.  Will most likely be making this at least once a year!

Perfect! I used my own recipe for the icing (cream cheese, of course). Instead of making it a 9x13, I made it a three-layer cake, and put a thin layer of icing, and crushed pecans between each layer. It was a HUGE hit!

This cake was excellent. I was never really into carrot cakes, but made this one for my son-in-law when I was out in Seattle last year. They loved it. I have since made it several times, everyone loves it. It is a keeper.

Delicious and a bit hit with everyone who tried it.  I did make some of the same changes others made:  (1) Only 3/4 cup oil (2) Added 1/2 cup applesauce (3) Only 1 cup white sugar (4) Added 1 cup brown sugar (5) Increased vanilla to 3 tsp (6) Increased cinnamon to 3 tsp (7) added 1/4 tsp nutmeg (8) Added 8 oz crushed pineapple with the juice squeezed out.  Finally, I used the "Cream Cheese Frosting II" recipe from this site.  I baked in 2 9-inch round pans for 40 minutes.

This is the best carrot cake I've ever tried!  I made my first cake just as the recipe says, then I made my second one by substituting 2 cups all purpose flour for only 1 cup and 1 cup whole wheat flour. I also replaced one of the carrot cups for diced apples, added more cinnamon and some raisins! Moist & Delicious!

I followed it exactly and took the cake out after 40 minutes, glad I did cause it was a little dry and it sunk in the middle.  The frosting was too sweet, would definetly reduce the sugar by half.  The cake is better the day after and the day after that.

I made this for easter dinner and my whole family loved it. I didn't change a thing except I added half a cup of pecans to the frosting. It was amazing!

Wow!! I took this to Easter dinner at my grandmothers and EVERYONE loved it. Some people compared it to carrot cakes from restaurants; which made me feel GREAT!  A yummy, moist cake that is worth the time spent.

This is a fantastic cake. I made it for easter dinner and everybody enjoyed it. I did make a few changes after reading other readers reviews. I added some nutmeg and used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar. I also used whole wheat flour. It was delish!!

FABULOUS!!!!Only one thing would make this better-1 cup of golden raisins! I used post of gneebeanie (who read all reviews-thanks!) I made these for Easter dinner this year. Can't wait to see how my grown up children will like these. (I dont expect grandkids will like them because of nus!) But so far my husband and I cant stop eating them!So I will post what I did:  First I made cupcakes-recipe makes 3 1/2 dozen, And I cooked them at 350 for 20 minutes. Fill cups 2/3 full  Ingredients:  4 eggs 3/4 c canola oil 1/2 c apple sauce 1 c brown sugar 1c white sugar 3t. vanilla extract 2 cups flour 2t. baking soda 2t. baking powder 1/2 t salt 3t. ground cinnamon 8 oz. crushed pineapple(drain well) 24 oz. grated baby carrots 1 c. chopped pecans  Frosting 1/2 c softened butter 8 oz cream cheese, softened 1t vanilla extract  I did not use pecans in frosting but instead put a 1/2 walnut on top of each cupcake for decoration. 3 1/2 c powdered sugar

AWESOME!  I made this cake yesterday and it's gone this morning, all of it.  I did use applesauce in place of half of the oil and added more cinnamon.  My husband and I also like a cheesier frosting so I actually only used about 120 grams of powdered sugar and it's plenty sweet enough.  Again, excellent recipe!!

After a week of searching for the perfect recipe, I finally chose this one, and I'm glad I did!! I used the suggestions of past reviewers. The cake came out moist and flavorful, and all the different colors in it are so pretty. The frosting was a bit too heavy for me, but I may have used too much cream cheese. Overall, this carrot cake is absolutely delicious!

Great cake, really hit the spot and was easy to make.  My center fell, too, but I didn't care.  I just filled it in with more frosting!

Update: I found an almost identical recipe that calls for a cup each of white and brown sugar  (also an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4th teaspoon nutmeg).  I think the brown sugar really improved the texture of the cake and I'll be making it that way from now on.  Also, the other recipe only called for two cups confectioners sugar in the frosting and it was perfect--this from a sugar freak.

I love this cake. It is moist and I my family and friends love it too. It's just that, here in Malaysia this recipe is a bit too sweet for us. So next time I need to reduce the amount of sugar..in both cake and frosting. Other than that this is a superb carrot cake. Well done!!:)

This is a 5 star recipe with adjustments.  I rated it 4 since it would have been too sweet if I had followed the recipe as is.  I made the following modifications: 1) substituted most of the vegetable oil with unsweetened applesauce  2) halved the sugar in both the cake and the frosting as I don't like cakes which are too sweet 3) used a 50/50 mix of brown sugar and white sugar 4) used a 50/50 mix of white flour and whole wheat flour 5) increased the cinnamon by 50% 6) added some nutmeg 7) added raisins along with the pecans  After the modifications, this was one of the best cakes I have made.  My kids were asking me to make it again after eating it for the first time.  I did not add pecans to the frosting since I thought that the pecans in the cake were enough.  I am glad I made that change.

This carrot cake is absolutely delicious! I followed some other reviewers tips and used 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar.  I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, and a half teaspoon of ground ginger. I left the nuts out of the batter, but sprinkled some on top of the frosted cake. I baked the cake in 2 9in cake pans. They did sink in the middle, but I 1 1/2x the frosting recipe and gooped it into the middle of the cake. I LOVE cream cheese frosting, so the extra in the middle was a total bonus.

I have been baking for over 20 years, and this definitely rates as the best carrot cake I have ever made or tasted.  I made this and took it to work, and got rave reviews.  Everyone is asking me to make it again.  Thanks Tammy, great recipe!

Wonderful.  It was so moist and great flavor.  I could have done with half the recipe for frosting, though.  It will be my only carrot cake recipe from now on.

Warning:  I used a springform pan and the batter ran over and all over the baking sheet underneath.  I also baked it almost 2 hours.  But, although messy, it's still the best tasting Carrot Cake Recipe I've ever had.  Using 3 cake pans is actually just the right size.

Phenomenal response from this cake!   I don’t care for carrot cake, but couldn’t stop eating this one!  Made it for my boyfriend’s birthday and this recipe got me raving complements from a pastry chef!  I modified the cream cheese icing a little for decorating purposes by adding a little meringue powder and more confectioners sugar.  Worked out perfectly!

Made this cake yesterday and it's really good.  I prefer carrot cakes without pineapple.  I think next time I will make it double layer (just looks prettier!).  I would also recommend toasting the pecans first--both for the cake and the frosting.

I've made several carrot cakes and must say that this one is extraordinarily moist and flavorful. I made this into cupcakes and everyone loved them! I used half white and half brown sugar, according to the suggestions of some others. Everything else I kept the same. Yum!

Made this today for my mom's birthday. I did not make the frosting, so it might have affected my rating for it. I found it a tad too sweet for my taste but overall it was good. My mom liked it, so everything's good. Next time i'll make it with frosting and less sugar =)

Good carrot cake though it turned out a bit different than I expected. First I followed the top review by gneebeanie. The cake turned out darker and drier than I wanted it to. I ended up taking it out of the oven after 40 min (thinking 35 min would have been perfect). Icing was amazing. Lots of pecans in this recipe, I would ask around an confirm that the majority like nuts. After a night of settling the consensus was this cake was very good. Would make again I would just check to make sure cake is not overdone.

Fantastic recipe, very moist and full of flavor.  As others did I substituted 1C of oil for unsweetened applesauce and reduced the sugar as well, but otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Next time I may add some additional spices.  The cake got rave reviews from all of my guests, thank you for a great recipe.

I made this exactly as stated ingredient-wise, but used a bundt pan for 55 min.  After reading another reviewer's comment that it didn't need frosting, I served this without.  I brought it to work and put it in the break room at 8:30.  It was gone before lunch, disappointing those who thought they'd wait and have some for dessert.  It was perfect for those of us who like muffins (or cookies or anything on the sweet side) for breakfast, although it would be good at ANY time.

This is so good, moist and has lots of flavour. The frosting is quite good as well, I didn't put the pecans in the frosting I sprinkled them on top after I frosted...very nice!!

I like this recipe just the way it is. I followed it exactly and it turned out great. I have made this about 4 times. Had a little trouble one time with the cake not rising in the middle. but this was an error on my behalf. Every other time the cake has turned out wonderful.  VERY GOOD CARROT CAKE RECIPE:-)

I made this one at school :) And while the others were baking pizza, I tried out this carrot cake. It turned absolutely wonderful.  Oh, yeah, I added a little more of pecans, and maybe more vanilla extract and cinnamon powder... I guess I even put (accidentally of course) much more cane sugar than the required, haha. But even then, everyone who tasted it had a big smile after the first bite, so I recommend it hugely.

This is a top notch recipe for carrot cake. In my opinion it really needs cream cheese frosting....and thats coming from someone that HATES frosting. These can be really good without frosting, but only right out of the oven. When I make these I usually get an "I love you" from someone (even my fellow college classmates when I bring them to lab!)

after reading a couple reviews i replaced the 2 cups of white sugar with one cup white, and one cup light brown sugar. i made this for my fathers birthday and the first time ever i made cake from scratch. it was amazing! it was so delicious and everyone loved it. although there was a lot of icing so next time i'm gonna cut down the amount of ingredients to maybe half. but other than that it was absolutely scrumptious and i'll definitely bake it again =).

This is a tried and true recipe.  I don't use any other carrot cake recipe since coming across this one.  I have made it with and without the pecans and it always comes out a hit.  If you like carrot cake, this is the best!!

The cake itself is good, but I add a little more spice to it now that I've made it a few times.  The frosting however, is divine! :)

I must've measured wrong or took it out too soon.  It looked burnt on top but wasn't done inside.  Maybe I'll try to cook it slower next time.

I made this for a New Year's potluck dinner Dec 31 2008. I used all the recommendations of gneebeanie (she consolidated the amendments of 1600+ reviews.) I too got rave reviews and people wanting seconds. However, to my mind it was a bit too sweet and fragrant -- another time I would revert to the original 2 tsp cinnamon and 2 tsp vanilla (she recommended increasing each to 3) and would cut down a bit on the sugar, both in the cake and in the icing (though I only iced the top, as I brought it still in the 9x13 pan -- if I had turned it out and iced all around I'd probably need the whole icing recipe.) I also incorporated the walnuts (instead of pecans) into the cake rather than putting on the icing, though it could be both. 
It was easy to make, however, and made a lovely, moist, chewy cake that was enjoyed even by people who said they don't usually like carrot cake.

Yummy!  This was great!  I scoped out the other reviews and went with the majority.  Applesauce for 50% of the oil.  Dash of nutmeg.  Upped the vanilla.  Added a small can of crushed pineapple (drained).  I also added some extra shredded carrot - just because I had so many in my produce basket!  It came out super moist and super delish.  After my husband - who isn't a huge fan of carrot cake to begin with - polished off a layered round, I made some loafs to pop into the freezer for emergencies.

Yummy. My family is not big on sweet things, so I left out the frosting. Vanilla and Cinnamon increased, 1/2 cup applesauce substitute for oil and added a cup of raisins. End result was light, moist, and full of carrots.

This is my first time making a carrot cake and this recipe was extremely easy.  My family loves it because of the great taste and it does not have pineapples in it.  I will be making it again.

This cake is always requested at holiday gatherings.  I did like others--used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown.  I also added a dash of apple pie spice.  The frosting, as others noted, could be halved with plenty to spare--but it's REALLY good, so making all of it is just fine also!  Excellent recipe.

I've received great reviews from everyone who has tasted this cake. I have followed others advice and slightly altered the cake and it's absolutely perfect.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 c. canola and substituted the rest (1/2 c.) with unsweetened apple sauce. Instead of 2 cups white sugar, I used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown.  Also, for the frosting, I reduced the confectioners sugar to 2 cups.  It's sweet enough with just 2 cups. Wonderful! Thank you.

I had to use 2 cups of whole wheat flour in this recipe instead of the all-purpose flour because that's all that was in the house. That's why I'm giving it four stars...I did not find the recipe as moist as others have described and the cake seemed dense--i assume this is because of the w.w. flour. The other changes I made based on the other reviews I've read: 1c brown sugar/1 c white, extra tsp vanilla, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, extra tsp cinnamon and 3/4 c canola/1/2 cup applesauce instead of 1 and 1/4 cups of oil. The flavor of the cake is very good, I just don't think it's as moist as I expected. Will definitely try again with white flour.

The icing is excellent--I used 3 cups of confectioners' sugar instead of 4 and didn't add nuts to the icing because I felt there were enough nuts in the cake already.

My mom & aunt love it though--but they are health buffs.

Wow... I messed up.  I scaled the reciepe for 30 and instead of 3/4 teaspoon of salt I put in 1 Tablespoon.  I was preparing the dry mix so I could assemble the next day when I realized my mess.  I just added enough mixture for 90 servings to help keep it from tasting like a salt bomb.  Next day I began to make the cake with shredded carrots I picked up from the 99 Cent store.  it was like making a box cake it was so easy.  I ran out of oil so I used 3/4 cup of crisco butter flavor and 1 cup oil.  Then I used splenda 1 cup and 1 cup of sugar.  First time with out pineapple the cake was sooooo good the crust was kind of stick crunch taste it was my best.  However it fell in the middle not used to that.  Thank you for the sharing the recipe.

Excellent recipe! The cake turned out wonderfully and everyone enjoyed it. I followed tips provided by another reviewer, see gneebeanie's review dated
Dec. 8, 2006. The cake could not have turned out or tasted any better... five stars all the way!

OMG...THE BEST. JUST DID COUPLE THINGS DIFFERENT. FOR THE MOST MOIST CAKE, ADD 1/2 SOUR CREAM AFTER ALL INGREDIENTS ADDED. AND ALSO, LEAVE OUT NUTS, ADD RAISINS AND 1 TSP SPICE SEASONING. BEST BY FAR

This is a great recipe! I also made it with the few changes suggested by many of the reviewers here and the cake turned out wonderfully - taste and texture. I was actually happy you can't really taste the carrots inside, the cake simply has that nutty/carrot cake flavor, moist and so very yummy. I guess everybody has his/her preference when it comes to food.

As far as oven time, my cake took about 1 hour and a half to bake (which made me worry a bit about the success of this cake) but I realized that I made a mistake that could have lead to a baking disaster. Since my oven does not have a way to set or control temperature, I have to use guessing when it comes to baking. Well, the temperature was higher and it caused the cake to crust faster on the outside but not bake properly on the inside. When I realized this was the issue, I turned the heat down but it had to bake way longer then the time the recipe stated. So if your cake starts burning on the sides but does not cook in the center, high oven temperature must be the issue: simply turn it down a tad and let it bake longer.

I also made sure to grate the carrots on the side of the grater used for cheese, so I had no problems with carrot lumps or juices.

This cake raises quite a bit while in the oven, so make sure you put it in the right size pan to avoid spilling-over.

My only wish is that the frosting would be stiffer (I used 3 cups of sugar) so I can decorate the cake for more of a festive Christmas dinner.

GREAT cake.  I just made this a week ago and am already having requests to make it again.  I replaced one cup of white sugar with a cup of brown sugar, and didn't change much else.  The cake and frosting are terrific!

I am pretty sure this recipe would have turned out great however I never got to see the end result of my mixing.Make sure you put the mix in an appropriate sized pan other wise when the cake rises and spills over it becomes very flamably. On account of all the oil this recipe requires.Once it spills over onto the oven bottom and becomes hot enough it will ignite.Creating a of caution.If you've ever seen the movie Backdraft, just picture that in your oven.Thanks.

I was very disappointed in this recipe, even after using all the modifications recommended by other reviews. It was not very moist considering all the oil in this cake. Even after adding extra cinnamon, vanilla and a mix of brown and white sugars it had no flavor. You really miss the pineapple and coconut..  Keep looking for the perfect carrot cake recipe!

Delicious and very moist! I subbed 1 cup pineapple for 1 cup oil as suggested by another reviewer. Used 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of four, and added flaked coconut to the sides of the cake. It added a wonderfully tropical twist :P

I've made this cake for the last 6 or 7 years and it hasn't failed me yet.  I follow the recipe and have always had a perfect cake.  I've even had people ask me to package and sell it.  Of course I haven't but that is the kind of results I've had from this cake.  Thank you for posting it.  It will remain one of my favorites.

This recipe was very good, the texture and flavour was excellent however the cake took a long time to bake and then made the edges and bottom a bit crispy. I added walnuts instead or pecans and used raisins in it. Happy Baking!

I loved this recipe, but my daughter, who hates cream cheese tasted the frosting while the cake was baking. She hated it, so I increased the powdered sugar 1 cup and added 3/4 cup milk, similar to the recipe on the back of the sugar box. It sweetened up enough for her, and still had that great cheesecake frosting flavor I love.

I made this cake for a small gathering - it was definitely a hit!  Even my friend who doesn't usually eat carrot cake said it was so moist and tasty!  I made a few adjustments as recommended by previous reviewers: 1) 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 applesauce, 2) added an extra 1/2 cup of carrots, 3) added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 4) 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, 5) extra cinnamon, 6) 1 cup white sugar/1 cup light brown sugar.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!  I'll definitely be making this again!

This turned out sooo good. Although I baked a two layer round cake and used more cream cheese in the frosting ( I thought it was waaay too sugary )The cake its self was moist and flavorful and had a great balance; it wasnt too sweet or to savory ! yumm.. but i would suggest using 14oz cream cheese in the frosting and an extra tsp of vanilla.

I followed the receipe; right down the last ingredient and I should have read the reviews and made the changes because my carrot cake was a big FLOP!  I made muffins and they all fell in the middle.  Next time; I will follow the reviews of others and make the changes!

I used the suggestions made by the other reviewers and made carrot cake cupcakes. They were moist and delicious. Everyone thought they were fantastic. 

I cooked the cupcakes for 17 minutes.

This cake was excellent! After reading the reviews, I used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I cut the frosting recipe in half and sprinkled coconut on top of the cake when it was done and frosted. This is the best carrot cake I've had in a very long time! Thanks!

I didn't rate it five stars, because I had to do some modifications. Once I did that then the carrot cake turned out great. I followed others' reviews and use less oil (I used 1 cup instead of 1 1/4 cup). I would like to use apple sauce, but I didn't have any on hand so next time I will use 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce). When making the frosting I used less powdered sugar (I used 3 cups instead of 4). After I frosted my carrot cake with a fair amount of frosting, I still have a lot left over. Next time I will cut the butter in half (use 1/4 cup instead of 1/2 cup) and cut the powered sugar in half as well (use 2 cups instead of 4 cups). After the cake is frosted, I sprinkled finely chopped pecans on it...it looks so much better than just plain white frosting. I made a 9 x 13 cake.

My Husband and two boys were dancing around the kitchen eating this. My children were shouting how much they loved me! I enjoyed it, too. I suggest you add a little bit of orange zest to the frosting!
I didn't want to mess around, so I followed the suggestions from a user before me - 1) 3/4 C. Canola oil, 2) 1/2 C. apple sauce 3) 1 cup white/1 cup brown sugar 4) 3 tsp. vanilla 5) 1/4 tsp. nutmeg 6) 3 tsp. cinnamon 7) 8 oz. pineapple

I have tried and failed many times in my efforts to make the perfect carrot cake, which is my hubby's fave cake. This recipe is wonderful! I only used 3/4 cup oil and added 1/2 cup sour milk. It came out beautifully. This recipe is a keeper!!

This recipe was great! I thought that if it didn't use canned pineapple it might go dry but it was lovely and everyone enjoyed it! I didn't use pecans in my icing.

OK. THIS CAKE IS THE REEEEEEEAL DEAL. 
this is THE SINGLE BEST CARROT CAKE IN THE WORLD. 
I have tried it just as the recipe says, and with little modifications. 
It was fabulous both times, but I prefered the texture with my changes. 
Use 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white. If you like a perfect smooth texture grate your carrots. If you like to see the carrots, then grate them thicker!
My only problem with this cake is that it is a bit too greasy. but its wonderfull so next time im going to use 3/4 cups vegetable oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  
As for the frosting, 2 cups of sugar is enough.. the cake is pretty sweet and is perfect without the frosting
Oh! you can also use chopped walnuts instead of pecans. 
update: I made cupcakes with this recipe, they came out great! I halved the recipe and had 15 normal sized cupcakes! oh! and I never have that problem with the extra liquid grating the carrots!  i think the texture is great!

Great Recipe! I made this recipe exactly as posted... the only thing I would change is the icing. I love sweet icing, but this was a little too sweet. Next time I will reduce the cups of Conf. Sugar.

This is the first time I've ever reviewed and online recipe.  This carrot cake turned out so good!  I'll definately make it again.  The only thing is it took at least 60 min to bake rather than the 40-50 min like the recipe says.  One of the best carrot cakes I've ever made!

Super carrot cake, and easy to make too.   After reading reviews I added an extra tsp. of vanilla and an extra tsp. of cinnamon and it was perfect.  I also replaced the nuts with 1 c plumped raisins.  To me it's not carrot cake without raisins!!!  I just plumped them in a saucepan on med. heat.
The cake was very moist but did brown on the edges before it was fully cooked.  It didn't interfere with the taste of look of the cake though.  I did notice it didn't quite rise all the way in the middle, as others had mentioned ~ but once again, it didn't mess up the cake.  It was a great cake and the person I made it for said it was the best carrot cake they had ever had in all their 81 years!
I used the Cream Cheese Frosing II ~ Not to sugary and really creamy and wonderful.

If you want to keep it extra moist,I make the cake at night, let it cool off about 20 minutes and then place them in gallon zip locks overnight and then frost them in the morning and keep refrigerated.

Very good cake.  Moist and tender crumb and not too sweet. I added 1 cup of drained pineapple and increased vanilla to 3 teaspoons, reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cup.   For the frosting,  I only used 2 cups of sugar and it was perfect.

I made this and my daughter took it to work; people that usually do not like carrot cake raved about it.  I decreased the oil by 1/4 c., added 1/4 c. pineapple juice and 2/3 c. drained, crushed pineapple.

Fabulous! This was the first time I have ever mmade a carrot cake. So easy, so moist, and YUMMY! I would not have put as many nuts as it calls for in the icing. I will either finally chop them or put 1/2 the amount next time. I also "minced" the carrots in a small food processor. Good call on my mom's suggestion. It scared me at first b/c the batter was thicker than a normal cake batter, but did not change anything. So, go for it SOOOOO Good!

I made this recipe following the directions and it turned out great. That being said next time I think I will make it with raisins instead of pecans and use half white half brown sugar and add some nutmeg just because I would prefer these flavors in my carrot cake. But this recipe is great as is.

AWESOME.  The changes I made were: replaced half of the oil with applesauce, replaced 1/2 cup white flour with whole wheat flour, added 1 extra tsp vanilla.  I baked it in two 9" cake pans approx 35 min and layered them when I was icing.  I also used only 3 cups of powdered sugar in the icing and it was plenty.

Made this for my daughter's first birthday and it was EXCELLENT. My husband had never had carrot cake before because of a nut allergy and this has become his favorite cake. I followed a few of the suggestions, substituting 1 cup of white sugar for brown, extra vanilla and cinnamon and it definitely added to the flavor. Overall great recipe!

Very good recipe.  I did 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, doubled the vanilla and cinnamon.  Replaced 1/2 cup of oil with applesauce and it was perfectly moist and dense.  Baked 2 - 9" rounds at 325 for 32-35 minutes.  I added an apricot filling in the middle of my 2 cakes.  I used about 1/2 up of the icing and mixed in 1/2 cup of apricot jam.  The frosting is wonderful, keep it as is!

This was a good carrot cake. And was even better the next day. The first day I thought it had a bit of a salty/baking soda taste.

Best cake ever!  I read in the reviews that it freezes well so I made the cake for my baby's birth about a week before my due date and froze the two layers.  I put them in the fridge before going to the hospital and my mom frosted it and brought it to the hospital the next day for the "birth day" party.  It was so good I can't imagine how it could be any better if it were freshly made when we ate it.  All of our visitors raved about it too!  Will make again for her 1st birthday!

I really had high expectations for this cake and it was very good, but not the best carrot cake I've ever had. I thought it was a tiny bit drier than most CC's. I think next time I will add a little more oil for that dense texture. The frosting was fabulous but I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar.

This is a great carrot cake! It's not very spicy,  So I loved it. If you like a more zingy cake, you may want to add more cinnamon  and some nutmeg. Very simple to make.

Excellent recipe, the cake was moist and very flavorful.  I followed the advice of others and used brown and white sugar.  I also used 1/2 as much oil as it called for and added some crushed drained pineapple.  I brought this cake to a work birthday luncheon.  It was devoured.

This cake is amazing! Wow. This is the first time I made carrot cake. I shredded almost a full bag of small carrots to make 3 cups. I also added a dash of all spice and a small amount of cloves. I did not have vegetable oil, so I used corn oil and I didn't add salt because I didn't have any. The icing recipe is on this site, but the confectioners sugar is half the amount. I prefer it that way. It tastes perfect! I think 3 or 4 cups would be too sweet. I did add the pecans on top, but just a little for a nice presentation. Thanks for sharing!
Made again on Easter withour realizing I've used this recipe before. EXCELLENT!! But this time I added 2 (8oz.) cream cheese to the frosting and a capful of vanilla extract. Then the icing was perfect!!! The icing is not good as written, it's way too thick and sweet. This recipe is delicious.

Awesome - great way to use up all those fresh carrots from the garden.
Halve the ingredients and you can make 12 cupcakes/muffins - bake for approx 25 minutes.

My boyfriend loved this recipe!  I went ahead and used some of the previous suggestions like: substituting half of the vegetable oil with apple sauce and adding  one can of crushed pineapple to it.  I noticed that when I used crushed pineapple that it increased the moistness of the cake compared to the second time when I did not add the pineapple.  I also used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and added 1 tsp of nutmeg.  The amount of powdered sugar was too much for the cream cheese frosting so I only used 2 cups, which made it much better!

I have made this a few times, and everyone loves it.  I did follow the substitutions of another reviewer as follows: 1 cup brown, 1 cup white
added 1 8-oz can crushed pineapple, drained, used 3/4 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, added 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, an extra teaspoon of vanilla. And cut the confectioner's sugar to 3.5 cups.

I substituted apple sauce for 2/3 of the oil and put less sugar.  The recipe was still fantastic!

I wasn't a member of allrecipes until we made this cake.  I had my daughter follow gneebeanie's suggestions for the recipe and yesterday she won grand champion at the county fair with that  recipe!  I didn't get to tast it, but I'm going to have her make it again so I can.  She put it in two layered cake pans and iced it with a honey-cinnamon frosting since we couldn't use a cream cheese due to 4-H rules.  We were all thrilled!  Thank you gneebeanie!!!

Wow - the cake was simply the best I've ever tasted! 
The icing was too sweet for me, but that's just personal preference. 
5 STARS!

Wow!  This recipe is totally a keeper!  My secret ingredient is the addition of 1/2 t. of pumpkin pie spice.  Instead of the 2 cups of white sugar, I used 1 c. white and 1 c. brown.  When it called for vanilla, I only had the cheap stuff, so I always use an extra tablespoon whenever it called for it.  Instaed of cream cheese in the frosting, I used the Neufatchel cheese which has a 1/3 less fat.

This is a great recipe! My first time making carrot cake and it came out really good. I would do the following tweaks for it to be perfect. Cake: More cinnamon, vanilla, swapped some applesauce for oil(you can alter portions as needed), nutmeg, ginger, allspice or pumpkin pie spice(these as liked for really good flavour), tad more carrots and didn't have pecans so used walnuts. Icing: Use LESS sugar(about 2 cups and add to taste). I think it should taste cheesier but the recipe icing was very, very sweet. A great recipe that I will make again!

I am giving this recipe 4 stars because I made some changes to make it a 5 star recipe. First off, I did as other reviewers and changed the 2 cups of white sugar to 1 cup white and 1 cup brown. Also for the 2 cups of flour, I used 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup white. For the oil I used 1/2 cup cinnamon applesauce, 1/3 cup oil, 3 Tbsp of milled flax seed, and about another 1/4 cup of the shredded carrots. I also added another teaspon of cinnamon, added alittle nutmeg and cloves. So I changed the recipe quite a bit but there was so much flavor to it this way. I also almost 1/2 the powdered sugar in the frosting to be able to taste the cream cheese more. This cake went fast in my house. I am sure the original recipe would too, however I had to cut back on that oil and make it alittle more healthier, not much though!!

First carrot cake I made and it was absolutely delicious. The only thing I would change is probably the frosting.. it was a bit too sweet for my taste, I would add a little less powdered sugar and maybe more vanilla extract. Other then that, the cake was very flavorful and moist! I will definitely be making this again.

Very tasty and moist.  Lots of compliments.  Used 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar.  Used 1/2 applesauce instead of oil.  I like sweet icing, so I used all the icing sugar, if not a little more (I don't really measure)  Yummy!  Looking forward to another piece tonight!

I tried this recipe for the first time from the first allrecipe cookbook.  I made it for Thanksgiving about 3 years ago and since then family members and friends beg for it year round.  I, too, chose it due to the lack of pineapple.  It's just a wonderful basic recipe that will never go out of style or let you down.  Wonderful!

This is the first carrot cake I have ever baked and it`s amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly as directed and it came out like one of those gourmet pieces you get at great cafes.  I added a bit of changes though to the cream cheese frosting :

- I added a bit of rum
- Sprinkled a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon in it

It is delicious!  The frosting really made the cake.

Next time I make it, I might add some raisins.  The reason I didn`t add raisins this first time around, is bc my boyfriend who hate carrot cakes wanted to try it.  In so many ways, this cake was a means to convince him that carrot cakes can be  delicious.  Guess what?  He absolutely loves it and is having his 2nd piece with his coffee!

I loved this carrot cake recipe.  It was very moist and delicious.The frosting, however, was way too sweet.  After making the frosting and tasting it, I added another 12 ounces of cream cheese and then it was just right.  Next time I would start off with 2 1/2 cups of confectioners sugar and add as needed.

This is a very simple, yet very delicious recipe. It seems to get better each day in the fridge, so it's also a great make-ahead cake. I've made it twice in the last month--my family loves it!

Like some of the other reviewers, I am confused as to why this cake has received such high marks from so many.  My cake turned out dense and dry and I don't think that it was anything that I did.  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and I substituted 1/2 c applesauce for 1/2 c of the oil.  I also added a little nutmeg.  I used 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar for the icing because that was all that I had on hand, and decided that it needed a lot more, due to being very runny.  I don't know how some cooks are getting by with less.  The cake had a good taste, just not a very good texture.  I was hoping for a lighter cake.  I will keep trying to find the perfect recipe.

This was a huge recipe ..... I ended up with 2, two tier cakes . also i added one drained can of pineapple and for the frosting I used 1 cup less of the powdered sugar and it tasted more like cheese cake. I made this for my Fiance's birthday and it was gone in 2 days he and all his friends loved it.

Another winner in my book! I made this recipe into cupcakes and they came out moist and delicious!  I think next time I may add some raisins to the batter for a little extra kick.  I may also try some other peoples suggestions and add a little more spice as well, but overall this is a great recipe!

The cake is tasty but not extremely so. Mine came out a tad dry (probably my fault), and the cream is a pain in the butt to whip my hand. :)

This recipe is pretty good. However, I found that it's a bit crumpy, as the cake breaks off quite easily. It doesn't stay in one piece. But the over taste, texture is very good!

Thought I'd add my 2 cents to the pile of positive reviews.  Fantastic!
Added a 1/4 tsp. nutmeg for a bit more spice, and replaced some of the oil for applesauce.  
This is the first cake I've ever made where I was tasting the batter before it was cooked!  I've never made carrot cake before and I'm glad I tried it.  
Unlike almost everyone else, I ADDED sugar to the frosting to make it a bit sweeter.

The only issue I had is that the frosting makes WAY too much!  I got 2 cakes using loaf pans and I have about 3 cups frosting left over.

I have made this cake so many times for so many different people and every single time I have been asked for the recipe.  This cake will not fail you.  The only change I made was reduce the sugar a bit.  I give it 10 stars. Thanks Tammy for sharing!!

Loved this recipe!  I did read other reviews and did make some adjustments that others made.  I used half brown sugar and half white sugar, 1 can of crushed pineapple without the juice, and added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon.  I think this cake is probably great without adding these things and I agree with one reviewer that you should rate the recipe as is without adding substitutions, but, I love pineapple and thought it would add to the moistness of the cake.  I made this for friends as a trial to a bridal shower cake I am making this weekend and it was a big hit.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Yummy! This was the first cake I've ever baked from scratch! Thank you for an easy recipe that was also good. (I made it exactly as written - less the nuts) and it was light, fluffy and yum-o!

This is an excellent recipe. I made all the recommended changes, although if I make it again I will omit the pineapple as I didn't like that flavor.

I was looking for a carrot cake recipe to make for
my dad for Father's day, and boy did I find one! I
see why this recipe is so highly rated, it's so good.
Followed the recipe to a tee, other than using half
brown sugar and half white sugar (as others have
shared), and pumpkin spice for the cinnamon. And,
I left the nuts out of the frosting and just sprinkled
them on top. The frosting is easier to spread that
way. Five stars and highly recommended!

Fantastic cake!  Carrot cake is my dad's favorite so I made it for him, he LOVED it!
I only made a few changes, mostly after reading numerous reviews:  added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, used 3 tsp cinnamon, used walnuts instead of pecans, used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and for the frosting I only used 1/4 cup butter, 2 cups sugar, and omitted the nuts, though I may try those next time. All in all, a wonderful cake!

This is the best carrot cake i have ever had. It is so easy to make and I have made it about 5 times now. I cook it in 2 round pans and then make a layered cake. I always make sure and take it out while it still looks uncooked in the middle and then will usually let it sit in frig overnight before icing it. It stays moist for days ( if it lasts that long). Thanks for this great recipe!

I made this for my mom's birthday (carrot cake is her favorite).  I didn't like carrot cake before, but I had multiple slices of this it was so good.  I added a can of crushed pineapple and made 3 thin layers of cake filled with a less sweet cheesecake filling I made up.  It was amazing.

I was very disappointed given the rave reviews. I was expecting a moist cake with lots of flavor, but instead it was dry and bland.  Just a typical carrot cake in my book. I'm going to stick with my Grandma's 75-year-old tried and true recipe.

This is the best carrot cake ever, and I am asked for the recipe over and over
Only thing i changed is to swop pecans for 60g walnuts and 60g raisins.  Also icing makes enough for a double batch!!

The cake and icing were yummy. We used applesauce in place of the oil, and substituted 1 cup of brown sugar, instead of 1 cup of white. Just for kicks, we also added 1 can of crushed pineapple with some of the juice.

Wow!  This turned out to be a big hit with everyone at a birthday party!  I took the cake suggestions from gneebeenie and added 1 cup of crushed pineapple, extra vanilla and also nutmeg.  I also added orange zest and some squeezed orange juice to the cream cheese frosting which added some flavor.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I volunteered to make the cake for my friend's 40th birthday bash, and he requested carrot cake with cream cheese frosting.  What I didn't realize at the time was that I was making cake for over FIFTY people!  I used this recipe exactly to the letter (four times), half with pecans and half without.  I made one traditional cake in a baking dish, and the rest I made into carrot cupcakes.  Everyone at the party raved about them!  The ones who had been there all day smelling them bake and looking at them on the counter couldn't resist and ate dessert first.  :) Thanks!

This was my first attempt at carrot cake and it was a huge hit with friends and co-workers.  I followed the less oil/applesauce tip and used only 1/4 cup butter and 2.5 cups icing sugar for the frosting.  I omit the nuts but added some golden raisins.

This was my first time making carrot cake and it turned out wonderful! I halved the oil and added applesauce to replace the rest of the oil to cut down on the fat. Thank you for the recipe. I will be making it again.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I made into a layer cake.  I used 3- 9 inch round cake pans and doubled the icing recipe.  I used the icing recipe as my filling also.  WONDERFUL..nothing but compliments

Amazing!  I modified the recipe as suggested by others (1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 c oil, 1/2 cup apple sauce, extra teaspoon of vanilla).  They turned out moist and delicious.  Someone claimed it was the best carrot cake they had ever had!

The cake turned out beautifully. I was grossed out by the idea of using so much oil, so instead I used 1/4 cup veg oil and 1 cup of applesauce. 

I also subbed whole wheat flour, and for the sugars I used 1 c. sucanat and 1 c. turbinado. I added about 10 oz of crushed pineapple and 1 cup of raisins.

Superb.

I made this cake for a family birthday celebration.  I did change a few things however, I cut down on the oil as others had suggested and I made a cream cheese icing. It was a hit! It was moist and not too sweet!  I definately will be making this again!!

Great! I will be keeping this one around for sure! As suggested, I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg and it added a great little kick! I also used less oil as suggested by another reviewer and the cake was moist and fluffy! Next time I will use a little less powdered sugar in the icing because I like mine to taste a bit more cream cheese like. But overall a great cake!

This was the BEST!  I took others' advice and used 1/2 oil, 1/2 applesauce, 1 cup whitesugar, 1 cup brown sugar, added nutmeg and extra cinnamon, used walnuts instead of pecans.  I made this in 2 round cake pans, baked at 350 for 35 minutes and they were perfect!!  I did not make the frosting in this recipe, I used a different cream cheese frosting from this site.  The only change I will make next time is to cut back on the walnuts a bit and NOT add them into the frosting. This was very dense and moist and full of flavor.

this recipe is very easy and utterly delicious!  I made it into cupcakes -they took around 20 minutes to cook - before piping the cream-cheese icing onto them. My friends raved that they were absolutely amazing..and they don't even like carrot cake. It's super moist and very tasty!

UPDATE:  Made carrot muffins and used whole wheat flour, Splenda brown sugar blend, all applesauce (no oil, no walnut) and egg beaters.  AWESOME.  Just as good and will make again.  Thank you.

Changes I made: used half oil and half applesauce, white and brown sugar, 8 oz crushed pineapple, walnuts in cake only.  I reduced the sugar in the frosting to 2 cups and it was perfect.  It was very easy to make and it tastes great.  Thank you.

I followed the recipe with all of the changes given by other members. It was great. After I iced the cake I topped it with toasted coconut. The coconut really made it special. My family loved it!

The carrot cake is amazing! My husband asked for a carrot cake for his birthday and this one was better than store-bought. I made it with the suggested changes (1/2 cup applesauce and less oil, 3 teaspoons cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg). We gave some to our neighbors and they said it was restaurant-quality. Thanks to Tammy for a fantastic recipe and to other reviewers for the extra touches.

This is the best carrot cake ever. I made one mistake when I put all the nuts in the cake itself and none in the icing. It turned out perfect, not even too nutty. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The icing goes very well with the cake, and both by themselves tasted excellent also.

Tastes like a carrot cake.  Nothing spectacular.  I found the amount of spices a little overwhelming.  Also, I only used about 2.5 cups powdered sugar for the frosting and it was plenty sweet.  It didn't have that "carrot cake frosting" taste I was looking for.  Just tasted like a sugar frosting.

If you're looking for an average recipe, this is it.  Nothing wrong with it, just average.

I needed another dessert for Easter dinner, and I went looking for a carrot cake recipe to make cupcakes from.  I used this one because it didn't call for pineapple.  I halved it and made it almost exactly as the recipe was, except I added a little nutmeg and allspice.  I halved the icing recipe, as well (and had a ton left).  I watched them as they baked, and the cupcakes took about 22 minutes - they were AWESOME.  I won't be changing this recipe at all.  My father actually called me just yesterday to tell me that he was made "because the cupcakes you made were terrific and you only sent me one home!"

This cake turned out very well. The cake itself was moist and not too sweet. The frosting wasnt as thick as I wouldve wanted, but the taste was very good. Excellent recipe, will make again!

I made this for easter, following several adaptations, of which I think the cup of brown sugar and extra vanilla is key. I got rave reviews, and both my fiance and fiance's father told me it was the best carrot cake they'd ever had (and carrot cake happens to be my future father-in-law's favorite dessert). I'll definately make this again - it's a keeper.

Excellent Carrot Cake, My only suggestion is to omit the nuts from the frosting, I found it to be too many.  If I make it a round cake next time then I will put the nuts on the outside. Otherwise I'll just leave them out of the frosting.

I received many compliments after making this cake.  It was very good.  The only difference is that I added about 1 cup of raisins; used melted butter instead of cooking oil; and sprinkled a dash of nutmeg and ginger in as well.

I will never buy a carrot cake from the bakery again!!!  This was a smashing hit with everyone at my Easter Dinner table!  First carrot cake recipe I ever tried and the only one I will ever use!    I made a few changes to the original recipe to help us cut out some fats and calories.   Heres my changes: 
In place of the oil I used about 3/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, added a can of drained crushed pinapples, replaced the sugar with Splenda.  For the frosting I reduced the sugar by about a cup.  Also used two 8 inch cake pans and baked for 35 minutes.     Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Thanks!

The carrot cake itself was excellent however the frosting wasn't what I was hoping for so when making it a second time I had to make up my own frosting recipe to get that traditional carrotcake taste, so only 4 stars from me due to that. I also cooked the cake in two 9 inch round pans for 35 min. and they turned out great. The first time I made the frosting I decided to double the recipe to ensure I'd have enough for a stacked cake and I got about 3 cups of sugar into the mix with 2 pkgs of cream cheese and decided that was more than enough. It was already over sweet and I can't imagine what it would've been like if I went with all 8 cups of sugar. It wouldn't have been the traditional carrotcake creamcheese icing flavor just an extra sweet sugar frosting. After making the cake a second time I found 2 packages of cream cheese and 2 cups of sugar and 1/8 cup of butter was my perfect frosting for a round stacked cake. It was fantastic that way!

This is the best homemade carrot cake I have ever had.  I got tons of compliments after making it for Easter dinner.  Consider substituting applesauce for half of the oil to make it less unhealthy.

This is a great recipe.  It's the first time I've made carrot cake and I like it.  I used the other members modifications and also used a Splenda sugar mix for the white and brown sugar (1/2 cup Splenda sugar mix = 1 cup sugar).  I also added a cup of raisins, and used walnuts instead of pecans.  No pecans in the frosting either, and I just used 3 cups of sugar, because I like my carrot cake frosting really tart.  I'll use this recipe again!

Isn’t this the way it always goes? Hubby eyeballs the purchase of a pretty (and expensive) carrot cake, displayed in the grocery at Easter. I veto it, but tell him I would make one. Then I find out he’s not sure if he even likes carrot cake! But he did like this one. It came out beautifully. I don’t do much baking. Sweets as a constant around the house only add to the waistline and the grocery budget these days is better spent on food for meals instead of treats. I made the cake and the icing exactly as the recipe said but left out the pecans. Great recipe, not too difficult, tastes great. Mildly spiced, I personally might try varying it next time using some brown sugar, more vanilla and maybe some nutmeg as others suggested. I was trying to remember that it was carrot CAKE and not a spicy sweet bread like pumpkin or banana bread. Also I don’t usually comment about the timing shown in the recipe because I rarely keep track, always marred by distractions and interruptions and cleanup anyway. For the goof this once I did time myself from greasing the pan to the time I popped the pan into the oven. It was EXACTLY 30 minutes like it says. That included shredding the carrots and almost all the getting out and putting away the ingredients and cleanup of the prep utensils. (Not making the icing though. That whipped up fast and yummy, in no time, later.) I’ll make this cake again. Hubby ate 2 pieces!

I went to the reviews and sorted them by helpfulness.  I made the cake with the changes according to the most helpful review and it turned out wonderful.  I don't like nuts in baked goods, so I omitted that.  I baked the recipe in 2 8-inch pans for ~30 min. :)

This was possibly the best cake I've ever made! My husband loved it. Incredibly moist and airy...not dense at all!
I made considerable alterations to the recipe, which I've listed below. It was a bit of work, but definitely worth it. I used the cream cheese frosting recipe provided as a guide, but essentially made my own.

-instead of all that oil, I used 3/4 oil (canola) and made my own (unsweetened) applesauce to account for the 1/2 cup oil I omitted.

-1 cup white & 1 cup brown sugar

-1/4 tsp nutmeg added as well as a dash of ground cloves and allspice

-I used 2 cups of grated carrots and 1 cup of pineapple that I crushed up in the food processor. This made for really MOIST cake!

-**I separated the yolks from egg whites. Took the egg whites separately with a bit of the sugar (maybe 1/4 cup or less) and whipped them up until frothy with the hand mixer.  I added the yolks to the mix first and then at the very end I mixed in the whites. I think this is partially to credit for the fluffiness of the cake!

-I baked mine in 2 8" round pans (the disposable aluminum kind) that were greased & floured. I would have used parchment rounds in the bottom, but I was out of parchment..

-I found it took about 45 minutes in the oven, but I did elect to cook my cakes at about 325' instead as my oven runs on the hot side...

For the frosting:

-I used about 8.5 oz of cream cheese 

-I only used 1 1/2 cups of confectioner's/icing sugar.

-Added an additional 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract

-Om

Awesome! Very easy too. Made the substitutions others made: 3/4 C oil + 1/2 C apple sauce. Added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg and 1/8 tsp. cloves. Used 1 C brown and 1 C white sugar. Only used 2 3/4 C confectioner's sugar for the icing and it was PLENTY sweet enough.

Would have given five stars if there had been less oil in the recipe. Cake shouldn't leave an oily residue on a napkin. I will look for a recipe that contains buttermilk or milk and less oil.

We followed all of the gneebeanie review summary suggestions. Only changes were halving the nuts in the cake, and adding an equivalent amount of raisins. Also omitted the nuts from the frosting. This cake was excellent!

I made this for an early Easter dinner with my family and it turned out wonderfully! I did deviate a bit with the frosting recipe as i'm not a huge fan of cream cheese frosting. For the icing I used 1/2 cup butter, 6 oz. cream cheese, 4 cups powdered sugar, and 2 T. vanilla - and I even loved it! Definately A keeper!

Carrot cake is my favorite, favorite cake ever and this recipe is awesome. I've never made one before (somehow) and was a little worried, but this was so easy...it's hard to make this one go wrong. I did cut the oil half and half with water (applesauce isn't something I can find here, unfortunately, but water worked just as well) and made the frosting with 1/2 powdered sugar, 1/2 splenda-like stuff. It came out amazing. Soft, moist, not too sweet. It was a definite crowd-pleaser...I took it to some friends' house for dinner and they asked to keep the leftovers and are seriously considering buying an oven just so I can teach them how to make it.

Thanks so much for this awesome recipe! Even though I made adjustments, I found it the perfect base from which to work. Here is what I changed, if anyone is curious:

I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so reduced the sugar to a scant 1 cup and used original, unrefined Sucanat (minimally processed sugar with the molasses stream still intact) instead, which contributed a rich caramel quality as well as minerals. Also used 3/4 cup of melted sweet butter and about 3 tablespoons of virgin coconut oil for the "oil" portion, and it was plenty. I'm kind of a geek and grind my own flour, and in this case freshly ground 2 cups of organic soft white wheat berries after having soaked and dehydrated them the day before. Given the low gluten content, it made for a moist and tender cake. I added a couple of mashed Barhi dates to the mix, too. They have a distinct, maple-y flavour that complemented the rest of the ingredients beautifully. Definitely use organic carrots if they are available to you. 

Baked the cake for 40 minutes in a clear glass, 9" x 13" dish. It was cooked through and didn't sink in the centre. For the frosting, I parted with the recipe completely and used homemade neufchâtel (we have a dairy cow and the cheese was sitting around the refrigerator after I made it yesterday). If I'd had cream cheese on hand, I would have used it instead. But the slightly tangy taste of the creamy neufchâtel is really lovely against the gentle but dark sweetness of the cake. As for the swee

Really good...with just a few adjustments for our tastes. I used olive oil and applesauce to make 1 1/4 cups and only one cup of raw sugar. Icing was kept the same, but sprinkled a bunch of cinnamon like our local coffee shop does. Will make again. Simple and good.

There should be more than 5 stars for this one!! What a delicious carrot cake! Made it for the 1st time Friday night and it's gone already! I used other reviewers suggestions and substituted some oil for unsweetened apple sauce, used about 1/2 cup of coconut and 3 cups of confectioners sugar for the icing. Turned out great and just sweet enough.
Thanks for this great recipe..it's a keeper!

This recipe is fantastic!!! I followed the advise of some other viewers and used 1/2 applesauce, 1/2 oil (the amount of oil seemed a bit much), 1/2 whole wheat flour and a smidge of nutmeg.  I also cut the recipe in half and baked in an 8x8 pan for ~40min.  It was extremely moist and very tasty.  I will def. make this again & again!!!

This is the BEST carrot cake EVER.  Several coworkers at work have requested that I bring it in as a "treat" every now & then.  There is a local restaurant that is known for its carrot cake - but opinions of coworkers has this recipe rated as #1 with the restaurant at #2.  GOOD JOB!

I would like to add that while using this recipe I baked it in a rectangular pyrex pan that I layered w/ aluminum foil for easy clean up afterwards, well when it baked It kind of bubbled over the pan which was my mistake and should've used a bigger pan, but the excess carmelized and I broke off a piece to taste it and it was like a tastey chewy cookie, so now I will take the batter from this recipe and fill a frosting bag and form cookies on a baking sheet and see how they come out, though I might add a pinch more flour to make better thicker, but I imagine it they will turn out to be very tasty cookies (just wanteed to share my discovery) thanks again for this wonderful cake recipe that I've already added to my recipe box for future use.

This cake was YUMMY!!!I followed the advice of others in attempt to make it a bit healthier, I used a professional cake pan and it didn't cook as well as I had hoped, the center sunk...but taste wise it was delish! The frosting was a smidge too sweet for me, and I only used 3 cups and had about 1/2 cup leftover. I think the cake recipe would make great morning muffins w/ some raisins, wheat germ/flax seed and adding in some whole wheat flour. Thanks for sharing!

I used one cup white/ one cup brown sugar; added 8 oz can pineapple, about one cup of shredded coconut; used 1/2 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup veg oil; used a little extra vanilla and cinnamon.  Omitted pecans. Also used only 3 cups of confectioner's sugar in frosting.  I got raves for this cake.

I followed others advice and changed up sugar to half white and half brown, added nutmeg and more vanilla. No applesauce or pineapple, more walnuts. It is excellent. Not sure if I love the frosting, too much powdered sugar you can taste that over the cream cheese. But GOOD CAKE!

I made this exactly as the recipe said- But I kindof forgot about it in the oven and it was in there for about an hour, so the outside was kindof hard.  But the inside was good, moist.  I havent ever tried carrot cake before, and it was great.  I like sweet frosting, and the frosing was so good, I ate about a 1/2 cup before my husband started teasing me.  (I'm pregnant with our 4th child and love frosting!)  Anyway, it did not taste oily at all to me.  I did beat the frosting for a good 5 minutes in my mixer.  Very good!

I made 1/2 the recipe originally calls for.  The cake turned out VERY moist, it must be the applesauce and carrot juices.  The frosting was still too sweet for me even with the recommended changes but tasted good nonetheless, just spread the portion of my liking.

awesome!  Used 1/2 cup less oil but replaced it with a jar of carrot baby food.  Added cup of coconut (will put it in the food processor next time as the coconut 'threads' were distracting).

The icing does not need nearly so much sugar...I used half the amount and it was fine.

THE best carrot cake ever!  Like other reviewers, I used brown sugar and very little white and added nutmeg.  To the frosting, I used 12 oz. of cream cheese and less sugar so that it wouldn't be too sweet!  I've made it twice in a weeks time, does that tell you how much my family loves it?

This really was a great cake. However I did tweak it a bit. I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla, switched out the white sugar for brown, and left out the nuts. Instead of 1and1/4 cup of oil I added about 3/4 cup canned pumpkin, 1/2 cup ground flax and 3/4 cup butter flavored crisco. Then I divided the batter between 2 9x13 pans to make it a layer cake.

WOW!  This is the best carrot cake I've ever eaten.  I made it as a layer cake and it was phenomenal.  I followed other reviewers recommendations, did 3/4 canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce... 1 cup brown and 1 cup white sugar, extra tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg... YUM.  I used 2 9" square pans and layered them, the frosting amount was just perfect (probably would be too much if it wasn't a layer cake) but I love frosting so layer cakes are the best!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I have been making my great aunt's recipe for years, as has my mother.  This is similar, but far better.  I made it for my husband's birthday, and everyone said that it was the best carrot cake they had tasted.  I followed the recipe exactly.  Even my kids kept asking if there was more left, and they are probably the pickiest eaters in the world.  I will be making this cake often!

This is an excellent recipe, One of the best for carrot cakes I've ever used, I didn't make many substitutions and I think I added too many pecans but I think it turned out ok ^ ^;

I usually make "Awesome Carrot Cake" (from this site), but didn't have pineapple on hand and needed make a cake before I would have had time to go to the store. It turned out good. It's not as moist as the other recipe, but still VERY good!

I cut the recipe in 1/2, used a 8 inch greased/floured pan. Subbed brown sugar, crushed well drained pineapple, and yummy!! Next time I'll make a full recipe............oh my poor hips!

The only problems I had was that it spilled everywhere in the oven and it broke when I tried to get it out of the pans!  I'm assuming that my round pans were not big enough.  Once I finally pieced it back together, I took it to my husband's boss' house for dinner and no one could get enough!  I followed the most common suggestions (applesauce, etc.) and it was great.  My husband had no problem cleaning up the crumbs, even without the frosting.  I have no problem making this recipe again.  Next time, I'll just put a cookie sheet on the lower rack of the oven!

Absolutely delicious! I halved the recipe since I was making it for only my husband and myself.  I also substituted 1/2 the oil with pureed prunes.  The result was a dense moist carrot cake that was filling but not to heavy!  It was the perfect Christmas dessert!

Brilliant cake!!  Of course, many of us tweak these recipes a bit, and here are my tweaks.  First, I didn't want a large cake, so I scaled it to half size using the servings & scaling button on the recipe page.  Though the scaled recipe still said to use a 9"x13" pan, I figured that was a mistake and used a 9"x9" pan.  I used the small holes on my grater and had no mush and no excess liquid.  It was fine!  I replaced a few tablespoons of the oil with applesauce, but next time I would try drained crushed pineapple.  And I used only half (again) of the sugar in the frosting -- it was lightly sweet, a bit tangy, and very creamy.  Delicious!  Froze the leftovers and they are great right out of the freezer!!

WOW!  Never made carrot cake from scratch, but will never go back!  This was the best carrot cake I have ever tasted.  Added a couple handfuls of raisins.  Thank you for a fantastic recipe! (followed suggestions of other reviewers re: applesauce, pineapple and brown sugar.)

LOVED it!  It was such a big hit at Thanksgiving dinner tonight!  As others suggested, I made the following substitutions: 1) 1/2 c cinnamon applesauce and 3/4 c canola, 2) 1 c brown sugar, 1 c white sugar 3) used 3 t vanilla, but only 1 t cinnamon bc I used cinnamon applesauce, 4) 1/2 t nutmeg, 5) no nuts.  For the frosting, I only used 2 1/2 c sugar which was plenty.  Everyone loved this!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Carrot cake is my husband's favorite and he had been talking about it for weeks before I finally decided to make some for him. Found this VERY easy recipe and measured everything in half since only two of us would be eating. So far I've baked three times over the past two weeks and the cake came out perfect every time!  ! It takes less than 90 minutes to prepare and bake. LOVE IT!

This was the best carrot cake I have ever had! I am usually not a huge fan of carrot cake, but my mom is. I made this for her birthday in early October. I must have made it 10 times since! It is a big hit at bake sales and gatherings too!! I very much recommend it! I beat the eggs and such with a mixer! turns out great!

I have used a very close variation of this recipe for years and have always had great results.  I use 1 and 1/2 cups oil or even sub. applesause for some of the oil. I bake this at least twice a year for my Dad (Father's Day and his Birthday in November).  I won a baking contest at work with this cake as well.  What more can I say???  It's a super recipe!!

Made this twice so far using a lot of the most commonly suggested modifications...WOW this is a good moist carrot cake!  It always turns out huge but it falls (I live near Denver so it could be due to the elevation).  It is hard enough to get a lid or plastic wrap on it as is (toothpicks didn't help a lot) so I'm kind of glad that it falls...besides, you can't tell once the frosting's on it.  I usually get a lot of comments on how good this is.  It's a lot of work but definitely worth it.

This recipe was great.  As I do with most recipes, and as many reviewers suggested I used 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white.  I also only did 1 cup of canola oil.  I made these in a muffin tin and didn't even bother with the frosting.  My children LOVED them and will be taking them all week as snacks.  The recipe yielded 24 perfect sized "muffins".

Wow - what a cake. I followed reviewers advice and used 1/2 c. applesauce and 3/4 c. oil, one cup white sugar and one cup brown, added a dash of nutmeg, and grated the carrots coarsely. With these changes it was superb! I wanted it dairy free so I used the vanilla glaze on this site. A winner.

Not perfect, but quite near... A bit too dry for my taste. The first cake was terrible, it just rised and rised an rised... and ran over from the pan. The second time I used only (2 tsp baking and) one teaspoon of baking soda. It still raised little too much. I baked the cake in two pans (diameters 9 and 11 inches) and piled them. I made 1,5 portion of frosting, which was a bit too much, and decorated with pink paste (confentioners sugar & black currant juice), the cake became awfully cute.

I used glutenfree flour mix as usual, margarine instead of oil and a lot of cinnamon.

I followed the recipe as written, except for reducing the amount of confectioner's sugar to 2 1/2 cups instead of four.  I've had experience with frostings that are too sweet, so this recommendation made intuitive sense.  There was one segment of the cake--near the middle--which sunk in.  No problem; I just added more frosting on that portion to build it up to the same level as the rest of the cake.  Somebody will get an extra dose of frosting.  This cake and frosting are splendid (I could make a nice snack of frosting alone, mmm), individually and collectively.

I don't like carrot cake but I had some extra carrots in the fridge and thought I'd give this recipe a try. Much to my surprise, I really liked it! I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup, because I didn't want the cake to be soggy. It was perfect! I used the cream cheese II frosting recipe but used 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar instead of just 2. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe. I added about 7 oz can of crushed pineapple with some juice. My cake fell just a bit in the middle so maybe I'll add less juice next time. It was already very very moist. I also did 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar. Everyone LOVED it!!

This cake has become the go to for any birthday party in the family.  It is requested often and always gone with in a day.  tip... toast some pecans for 5-10 min and put thtem on top so the kids that dont like nuts can get um out easy- also add a zuccini from time to time for color and a different flavor- just experiment with it and have fun!  Great cake!!!

Excellent.  I followed the recommendations made by gneebeanie but instead of using 1 cup of pecans, I used 1/2 cup of pecans and 1/2 cup of raisins.

Delicious recipe.  We cut the sugar in the icing in half - gave a great cream cheese taste without being too sweet.  We also traded pecans for walnuts.  Mmmmmm...

Tasty, moist and so very easy to make!! Made with all the changes that everyone suggested and it's by far the best we have ever had.  Stick with the 3 cups of powdered sugar..it makes for a perfect frosting!!

Good recipe.  My cake turned out a bit dry and condensed but it could have been my own fault.  I'm gonna try it again since the flavor was good.  I did add extra cinnamon and next time I'll add even more.

I like my cakes smooth and my breads chunky, so I opted to not add the nuts.  I also found that the cream cheese frosting was plenty for the recipe.  A nice, light cake.

I'm not a carrot cake fan. But after I tried this recipe, I loved it. Everyone who tasted this cake just fell in love with it even those who doesn't eat carrot cake. I'm not a fan of cinnamon so I cut it into 1 tsp. Very moist and made it few times already. Always turned out the best. I also added some raisins. Thanks for sharing.

I followed everyone else's suggestions and used part applesauce, nutmeg, extra cinnamon, canola oil, pineapple, less powdered sugar, etc. It turned out FABULOUS. I was told it tasted like a $100 cake. It was so moist and delicious. I am making again next week for my best friend, who is a carrot cake expert. She won't be disappointed either. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made 1.5 portion of the cake recipe to fill two 9" round pans and make a double layered cake, witI swapped 1c white sugar for 1c brown sugar, and made the following additions: 1) 1.5 tsp cinnamon 2) 1.5 tsp vanilla extract 3) 1 well-drained 8oz. can of crushed pineapple 4) 3/8 tsp nutmeg.  It came out well in the oven putting the pans side by side & using the same baking directions.  Instead of the recipe's frosting, though, I followed the directions in Cream Cheese II frosting exactly; it made just enough frosting to generously coat the cakes and in between.  I tricked it out by spreading a can of dulce de leche (actually made by boiling an unopened can of condensed milk in water for 4 hours--no, it doesn't explode) on both layers.  It was a wonderful hit.  The cakes came out perfectly moist, not dense.  I think the trick here is to use large holes when grating the carrot, so you have large shreds to work with instead of pudding.

500+ five star ratings cannot be wrong! This was GREAT! I made the same changes as others recommended: 1/2c. applesauce inplace of some of the vegetable oil, used half brown sugar, half white. And I went a little nutty with the food processor and added WAY more than three cups of carrots (it was only my third time using the darned machine & I got carried away). But it still did not overwhlem. It was pretty and super-good!

I followed all of the recommendations (with the exception of the nutmeg because I didn't have any) and this cake was amazing!  Next time I'll probably cut back on the pecans but other than that, this was the best carrot cake recipe ever!  My husband's grandfather said that I should make these cakes and sell them!  =]

I followed the suggestions in the reviews (1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar), and just 2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting. I also bought a bag of shredded carrots ($1.99) and then grabbed a wad and cut it in half with scissors. Saved me a lot of time. I am happy with the cake because it did not require a lot of effort or money and everyone liked it. However i'm going to give it 4 stars because if I had followed the directions with 4 cups of sugar in the icing (!), it would have been nasty.

This recipe always comes out perfect. Honestly, I've had professionally baked carrot cakes and this one is still better. I tend to find icing too sweet, so I cut the icig sugar in half-just my thing :)
Thanks for the post!

This cake was AMAZING - I made it for my dad, because I usually don't like carrot cake... And we BOTTH LOVED IT!!! I only made a few minor changes - one tablespoon of vanilla extract, olive oil instead of vegetable, and because I didn't have any cinnamon I used nutmeg instead. I was planning on following your frosting recipe when I realized I had JUST run out of confectioner's sugar, so I used about 3/4 cup white sugar and 3 or 4 tbsp of pure maple syrup (I'm guestimating cuz I didn't actually measure)... And it still came out great, and it wasn't too sweet. The middle of my cake fell in so I had to cut out the sides and rebake the middle, but I think I overbeated my batter. Thank you so much for a GREAT recipe!!!!!

Excellent recipe, moist & delicious. Best carrot cake I've had in quite a while.

I made a slightly different version of the cream cheese frosting with whipped cream in place of the butter.

After a few changes of my own, this was GREAT!!!  I added 1/2 cut raisins, 8oz of crushed pineapple, ALOT MORE CINNAMON, (love cinnamon!) 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and used a combination of pecans and walnuts.  I followed everything else...it came out so moist and crumbly.  Also I used all 4 cups of powdered sugar for the icing and alittle more cream cheese, I will def make this one again!!!

Great cake!  I hate baking but this was super easy and a big hit for some of my picky eaters. I followed all the alterations recommended by greenbeanie and it was perfect, only I didn't mix the nuts right into the frosting.  I Used some pecan halves and let the kids I keep spell out "MOM" on top for her birthday. Less nutty and a message that comes from the heart!

This was my first attempt at making a carrot cake from scratch. I received rave reviews for this recipe!! It was so easy to make and the frosting came together beautifully. I didn't make many changes...used 1 tablespoon of vanilla in the batter and frosting and used walnuts. Great recipe!!

Very good.  I, too, used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of the 2 cups of white sugar.

Since I was making a 9 in two layer cake I needed more frosting and added another 8 oz pkg of cream cheese.  I also only used 3 cups of powdered sugar and it was perfect.  4 cups sounded a bit too sweet.  THANKS!

This was excellent.  I made one minor adjustment.  I exchanged plain applesauce for 1 cup of the oil and baked it for slightly less time.  It was great and cut out a little of the fat.

Excellent!  Received rave reviews.  I made a few slight changes as recommended, 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  For the frosting only used close to 3 cups of powdered sugar and probably could have used a little less but it was still GREAT!

The cake recipe wasn't the best and i followed it exactly. I've honestly had much better. My favorite Carrot Cake recipe is in Southern living cookbook, i think i'll stick with that in the future. The frosting recipe was good though. This recipe could definately be better but still pretty yummy.

Delicious, I took the recommendation of others and used 3/4 cup of apple sauce & 1/2 cup of oil. It was very moist! And very easy! This was the first Carrot Cake I have ever made.

I also used some brown sugar, 3/4 cup of oil, 1/2 cup applesauce..  I omitted the pecans from the icing (thought it'd have too much crunch) It turned out perfect.  Yum yum yum.

When you can get 10 firefighters to go back for seconds, you know you have a good thing. Our Saturday night tradition of a homemade dessert will include this recipe many times in the future.
Followed other suggestions and added extra walnuts and 1/2 cup brown sugar.

very yummy!  The cream cheese frosting with only 3 cups confectioners sugar was the best cream cheese frosting out there.  You could actually taste the cream cheese instead of just sugar!  The carrot cake was good also but I added extra spices....1/4 tsp cloves and 1/2 teaspon nutmeg I also used the applesauce oil exchange like others posted.

The first time I made this I had only one cup of all-purpose flour, so I used wheat flour and it was great! Just a little more dense but wonderful. My family loved it. I have made it again the way the recipe calls and still raves from my family.  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!

I have made this cake twice this week.  I am currently living in Chile and made it for some friends, they loved it so much they asked me to make it for our big weekend asada, so in short, this is an international hit and I translating the recipe for them!!  I did use the oil/apple sauce combo as suggested by several reviews.  Thanks for sharing this great cake.

Yummy!  Followed the advice of several reviewers.  Used 1 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil. Reduced sugar to 1 cup 1/2.
Added 1/2 cup raisins.  For the frosting, I used light cream cheese and 1/2 of powdered sugar so 2 cups.  Made 1 dozen cupcakes and a 9 X 9 cake.  Turned out moist and not too sweet.
Very tasty!  Satisfied my craving for carrot cake!  Thx for sharing!

I did two eight inch rounds and decreased the oil by about 1/4 cup, as some reviewers said it turned out oily. It was good, but I think next time I'll use the full amount of oil and possibly decrease the cooking time because I thought it was a little dry/ overdone...carrot cake is supposed to be very moist!  I also added about 1/8 c. brown sugar. Still, very good! My husband claims to hate carrot cake, and did not eat this when it was initially served, as he had a choice of two desserts. However, he called me at work the next morning after eating it for breakfast and raved about it. The following morning, upon finding that I had brought the rest of the cake to work, he called and complained because he couldn't eat it for breakfast again! 
I used a different cream cheese frosting recipe (from this site) which had a lot less sugar so I can't comment on the frosting here.

According to my easter table, this carrot cake is 30 thumbs up! EVERYONE loved it. Even the people that weren't fans of carrot cake loved it! I subbed 3/4 c of the oil for cinnamon applesauce, and upped the cinnamon and added some nutmeg, and also spiced up the icing with the same spices. Excellent!

the frosting was amazing. Cake was stupendous. My whole family loved it at Easter. Very moist, flavorful...and heavy. I left it right in the 9x13" pan and served from there.

Best Ever!  I did two 9" round layers for my cake as I like round cakes, I'm funny like that. I also left out the pecans as I didn't have them at home, but still it was fab-u-lous.  One other little thing was that my frosting was a bit thick so I added a couple teaspoons of milk.

whoa!  unbelievable.  i never just "buy" carrot cake, because it's not my favorite - i made this for someone who loves carrot cake and it was absolutely amazing.  the pecans and the frosting make all the difference.  i cannot emphasize the yum factor.

I gave a piece of this cake for my husband to take to work and he called me after he had finished eating it and said it was the best carrot cake he's ever had, he said it was even better than his dad's, (who used to be a chef!).

The cake turned out looking beautiful. It has the perfect amount of moisture to it. The problem is that there just isn't any taste to it. It's kind of blah, even following the recipe to the letter.

Absoloutley fantastic.  I was looking all over for a great carrot cake recipe for my boyfriend's 18th and happened to stumble across this website and then, this recipe.  It took about an hour in the oven but it was well worth it.  Smelt great, looked great, tasted great and my boyfriend loved it. Will definately be making it again, maybe together tomorrow!

This was excellent! I made it a day ahead, refrigerated it and then frosted it. I added a small can of crushed pineapple and cut the oil to 1 cup.The flavor was sensational. I used 3 cups sugar in the frosting and an extra teaspoon of vanilla.It makes way too much frosting so I used the extra on store bought cookies. Yum!

Every single time I make this cake, people say it's the best carrot cake thay have ever had.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions to reduce the amount of sugar in the frosting to 3 cups.  That was so good, I decided to try using only 2 cups and it is still sweet enough. The cream cheese taste really comes through. This is an awesome recipe...thanks for sharing it!

WOW!  I cheated and used the store bought cream cheese frosting and just stirred in pecan chips.  People thought the frosting was homemade as well, so that was my little secret.It was so good we ate it for breakfast this morning!!!  Very moist.

I made this to bring to my in-laws for Easter dinner, and it was a big hit.  My husband and mother-in-law both proclaimed it the "best carrot cake they had ever had."  I did make a couple of small changes after reading through the reviews.  I used 1/2 cup of oil and 3/4 cup of applesauce instead of all oil, one cup of white sugar and one of brown instead of all white, added an extra tsp of cinnamon and a tsp of nutmeg.  With the frosting, I used 3 cups of sugar as I hate too-sweet frosting, and it turned out excellent.  I also used 2 round cake pans and made a layer cake instead of one flat sheet cake.  Excellent recipe that I will use again and again!  (My husband requested this on his birthday).

This is the best carrot cake ever!!  It is so moist and delicious.  The only changes I made was that I baked it in 3 round 8" cake pans, and I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar in the icing, instead of 4.  My cake came out perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

Really good cake.  I ended up cooking it in 2 round cake pans to make 2 layers, for prettier presentation.  I followed the recipe exactly except for increasing the cinnamon a bit.  Would definitely make again!

I baked the Carrot Cake III for a Ladies Luncheon and Fashion show sponsored by our Catholic Women's League.  I have never been successful with Carrot Cake recipes but this one was "EXCELLENT".  I reduced the vegetable oil to 3/4 cup, instead of 2 cups of white sugar I added 1 cup of white and 1 cup of brown sugar.  I added 1/2 tsp of nutmeg and a pinch of allspice.  I also added 1 cup of crushed drained pineapple.  Awesome recipe.  Will certainly bake again and have made it my favorite Carrot Cake. 
Thanks again!

I usually make my mother's recipe for pineapple carrot cake, but this time I decided to try this recipe. I made the changes to the amt. of oil and sugar (I used both white and brown sugar in the mix) and used 3 cups of icing sugar for the frosting. I absolutely love this cake. My husband and son agreed this was the best carrot cake ever!!! I am amazed, it was so moist and tasted phenomenal.

This was absolutely the best carrot cake I have ever had.  Made it for a dinenr party and was loved by all (even the kids.)  A few changes...I used 3 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, and use 2 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar...it made the frosting pefect and not tooth-aching sweet.  Will definately make this again and again.

I was worried at first that this would be a little dry (I have no idea why!).  However, it turned out moist and delicious; it was the best carrot cake I've ever eaten.  I made it for my boyfriend for his birthday, and everyone loved it so much!  Even my sister-in-law, who says she doesn't like carrot cake, ate a piece and loved it.  This one is a real keeper.

I chose this recipe because it was a simple carrot cake, without all the raisins and pineapple and extras.  
I did make a few modifications as per other reviews.  I added another tsp of cinnamon and 2 tsp of nutmeg.  Used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  Used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white.  Added an extra cup of grated carrot.  I also added the grated rind of one orange.  I omitted the nuts.
The cake was done to perfection in 50 mins.  The icing was delicious.  Everyone devoured this right away and gave it rave reviews!!

Excellent carrot cake recipe. I like the fact that it doesn't have pineaplle. I left the pecans out (because my husband doesn't like nuts) and it still tasted great. I will definetly keep this recipe handy.

I couldn't believe how perfect this turned out! I made it for Easter brunch, and everyone adored it. I really hate using oil in recipes, especially so much, so I substituted the exact amount of oil with baby food prunes instead. It works like a charm, and cuts down so much fat! I also didn't add any nuts, and used a bit less icing sugar (I thought it might be too sweet). Overall, this was seriously awesome.

This is the absolute best carrot cake recipe I've ever made! It was so moist and delicious, not to mention EASY! I made it for myself for my birthday a few weeks ago, and we're having it again tonight! Sometime I think I might even try substituting half the carrots with zucchini, just to change the taste a bit. Thanks so much!

Tried with oil and applesauce, good healthwise and soft too, but overall the one with all oil had tremendous ovation. It is soo good, simply made and delish. Used self raising flour + 1 tsp baking powder and 3/4 brown sugar and the rest white; doubled the cinnamon and more vanilla, too. The frosting however is too sweet for me so I used 16oz cream cheese (room temperature), 2Tbs. butter, 2Tbs icing sugar and just add enough maple syrup (log cabin butter flavoured) - whipped thoroughly and it is so fluffy and thick, no lumps. Suggestions: Do try adding a bit of nutmeg powder too, or chopped crystallized ginger, or golden raisins, for a change. Thanks Tammy for posting it here. Real beauty. Love it.

Yummy!!  This cake was a huge success.  I made it in two 9" round pans.  Between the layers I put skor bits on top of the frosting, and also put skor bits on top of the cake.  Soooo good!  Everybody raved!

This cake was so~ good! i will definately make this again. i made two cakes and they were gone in two days. The only thing i changed was the amount of sugar that goes into the frosting...i used only 3 cups and i didn't put any pecans in the cake or frosting... still it came out great.

This is a wonderful recipe!  I did make some changes that worked out very well.  I added some currants, a diced Granny Smith apple, and left out the pecans. Also reduced the oil to 1 cup.  I did put the pecans in the frosting, but used a recipe that was similar that called for 1/4 c. butter and 3 cups confectioners sugar. VERY DELICIOUS!!  Was a huge hit!!

This recipe was terrific.   I made it exactly as shown and I wouldn't change a thing. I made it for my daughter-in-laws birthday because carrot cake is her favorite and the family loved it.
Will definitely use this recipe again.

People ask me all the time to bring this cake over, ever since I made it for the first time about 2 years ago.  Its the best carrot cake recipe. It is not dry and its very tasty.  The cream cheese frosting is great too.

Awesome cake! This was my forst carrot cake. I brought it in for a staff lunch and they went wild over it! Moist, flavorful, firm. I added a dash of nutmeg(mostly because I love nutmeg). Cream cheese frosting easy and great tasting too. I added a few more pecans than the recipe called for, more nuts is a good thing. Thanks for the great recipe.

..At my first attempt my rating is rather low.  It is cooking in the oven at the moment, but the middle seems to not be cooking.  I was wondering what i have done.  I dont usually use 'cups' for cooking, and i was wondering how BIG are cups? Might of added too much carrots.  I'll let you know when its cooked and what its like! But at the moment it isnt very promising.  It must be just the way i made it, because so many people have said how good it is.

Fabulous cake.  I also followed the advice and substituted applesauce for half the oil.  I also added about an 1/8 tsp each of allspice, nutmeg and ground cloves because I'm nuts for a spice flavor.  I used 2 cups of powdered sugar for the icing.  Everyone was wild for the cake.  A few people said it was the best they ever had.  Just great.  I'll be keeping this recipe in my collection and will definitely make it again.

i just made this for my sister's birthday, it was so easy and it turned out terrific! i used 1 cup white sugar and one cup brown, omitted the nuts and reduced the oil to 1 cup and it was still extremely moist. i think it can still be reduced to as low as 3/4 of a cup. i didn't even like carrot cake until i tried this recipe.

Oh my god! Such an excellent cake. It was so moist and not too full of spices. I find the reason I dislike some carrot cakes has to do with nutmeg or cloves. This cake tasted great without them. I threw a little coconut into the batter as well. The frosting was great- I will use it to top other cakes too!

One of my co workers was looking for a carrot cake recipe that was easy to make, and didn't crumble alot when cut.  This one is perfect, even after I added coconut to the recipe.  I took one to to work and it was gobbled up in no time!

This carrot cake was so delicious. I halved the recipe and filled an 8" round pan but there was still batter left over so I put the rest in a muffin tin and got 4 big muffins out of it. I cooked the muffins for 20 minutes and the cake for 40. I didn't add pecans to the icing because I didn't think it needed them. I may put some pecans or coconut on top of the iced cake next time for decoration.

There is no such thing as too much icing in my book.  : )  I have made many other carrot cakes in my career, but this one is one I'll definitely make again and again.  Haven't tried the applesauce trick, but will do so down the line.  Thanks for taking my carrot cake up a notch!

Was absolutely delicious, especially the frosting, but my cake sunk in the middle.  Probably my fault though, as no one else said this happened to them.  I did reduce the carrots by half so maybe that had something to do with it.  It didn't matter, though, because I covered it up with frosting and my husband gobbled it up.  This is the best cream cheese frosting I have ever tried and will use it again on other things.

This is absolutely the best carrot cake ever. Everytime I make it I get rave reviews. It is very easy but makes a pretty big cake so sometimes I only make half.

I was searching for a carrot cake recipe, saw all the excellent reviews for this one, and decided to try it.  I'm so glad I did!  It came out moist and delicious and everyone absolutely loved it.  I did use the tip suggested by other reviewers and substituted applesause for half the oil.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!

This was the first carrot cake I've ever baked and it was awesome! The recipe's easy to follow and it comes out moist and beautiful. I used a 10 inch bundt pan, greased well and lightly floured. I frosted the cake without the nuts and garnished the top with whole pecans. Beautiful!!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! The first carrot cake I ever made -I ended up having to make a second cake because my husband and I kept stealing slices from the first one.  I took it to a party and everyone just loved it! Great with or without the frosting.

This was THE best carrot cake I've ever eaten, bar none.  It beat the store-bought cake by a mile!  To top it off, this was the first non-mix cake I've ever made, and it was so incredibly easy...thanks, Tammy!

This is the perfect carrot cake and I have made it several times.  I make it in an 18 x 10 roasting dish which means that it is only about 2 inches deep.  This way, you can get 40, easy to serve portions.  Cant quite bring myself to try the other carrot cake recipes as I don't wqnt to be disappointed!

I've tried several recipes for carrot cake and this one was the best.  As with other carrot cake recipes, I reduced the amount of oil down to 1/2 cup. I also replaced one cup of the white sugar with brown sugar.  The cake's texture was fluffy and moist and the flavor was excellent.  I didn't even get a chance to ice it before it was half gone! Thanks, Tammy for a great recipe.

This was an excellent carrott cake recipie.  I used half the oil called for and substituted the other half with apple sauce as someone suggested and it turned out great.  I also only used 2 cups of sugar in the frosting and it was still yummy.  This cake smelled so good cooking too with the apple sauce and cinnamon wafting through the house!  Thanks for sharing this one!

I made two of these cakes for a co-workers birthday (one with and one without nuts) and received rave reviews.  I had one person tell me that they have eaten lots of carrot cake and this is the best one!  3 cups of powdered sugar made the perfect icing.  I'll definately be making this again.

I can't say enough about this recipe!  It was just fabulous!  I've made it 3 times already both with and without pecans and everyone just loves it.  The frosting is to die for.  Thanks so much!  It will be very difficult to get me to try another carrot cake recipe while I've got this one in my box.

terrible cake. I really think it's just too much egg really. way to light and airy(I made sure not to over stir). too sweet and not hearty like most carrot cakes.

This cake was amazing! The only thing I did different was coconut oil instead of vegetable oil and not as much pecans. I made this by request for my 21 year old son's birthday today. We all ate too much but it was worth it. Thank you!

This is very good and I received compliments from everyone I served this to. I’d suggest doubling the vanilla in the frosting.

Made this with zero alterations to the recipe. I gave it 5 stars because it was exactly what I wanted from a carrot cake. My cake was moist and nutty. It reminded me of a banana nut bread, and it was delicious! My cake did fall in the middle, but I was not very careful when measuring thr flour. I'm also high altitude, and I wonder if that affected anything. Next time I will more carefully measure the flour.  Loved this cake!

Used the cranberries instead of pecan. The batter turned out to be a little dry so I added some milk to make it more liquidish. It was still delish. 
I will definitely use this recipe again

I made this for my husband's birthday, carrot cake is his favorite. This one was very good just as it is and he absolutely loved it! I'm with all the other reviewers that said you shouldn't give it a 5 star review and then list all the changes you made to it, that's not a fair rating of the recipe. Make it as the recipe shows or post your own version separately.

This is my go to recipe for carrot cake. I don’t know how many times I’ve made it. I do doctor up the frosting by adding a little rum extract, and today, a little fresh grated ginger

Nope. This cake overflowed and collapsed in the oven, came out chewy, and tasted like  - duh- way too much baking soda. But the icing was perfect. So get a better cake recipe and put this icing on it.

This is by far the best carrot cake I've ever made! It was perfectly moist and tasted spectacular. I did substitute each egg for a tablespoon of applesauce and added a splash of soy milk, I also did not add all the baking soda. I will certainly make this again!

I have never made it but I have eaten all kinds, with and without nuts, with pineapple.  This was my brother's wedding cake!  Mom made it and we drove it cross country on the roof of the car. The rack came off and we had to retrieve everything from the middle of the road, but the cake was not damaged! It was in a cooler I believe, so that helped.

It says 40-50 minutes, I opened the door at 45- it wasn't done so I put it another 5 minutes and it completely flopped in the middle! What went wrong here - everything was fine - maybe the baking soda?

Made this with the suggestions from reviewers - extra cinnamon, add nutmeg, sub 1/2 cup applesauce for oil, half brown sugar, half white. It turned out just OK. The cake just doesn't have much flavor, so it's a good thing it has the frosting on top. We ate it, but I won't make again.

i made this cake because i thought it was the recipe i’d used before. however, the middle sunk all the way down and the exterior was extremely crunchy all the way around. assuming i had made a mistake, i made it again. with the same results, i was extremely frustrated and moved to a new recipe. wouldn’t recommend.

It was delicious. I made it for my friend's birthday. She loved it. The topping is very sweet. Next time I try to prepare it with less ice sugar. But the cake was really amazing. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

AMAZING!! My husband requested it for his bday this year and said this may have been the best cake I've made, that means a lot!
I used another viewers suggestions: 1) using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 3) adding 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (I squeezed out most of the juice before adding it, I didn't want any extra fluids in the cake) 4) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 5) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 6) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. The result came out incredibly delicious - the cake was very flavorful and moist. For the frosting, I only used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar, and it was more than sweet enough, with a nicely balanced cream cheese vs. sweet flavor.
*still, I cut down on sugar even more, I just did a heaping C of brown-it was plenty sweet!
for the frosting, next time I would use only 2C of powdered, it was way too sweet. 
This recipe is a keeper!!

This was so good and loved by all my dinner guests. I used 2 round pans and stacked them with frosting in between layers rather than the 9x13 pan. Either way it's moist and so easy to make.

I've been making this carrot cake for 11 years.  Had to bring something to my first ever work holiday potluck back in 2008.  Frantically googled and this is the first carrot cake recipe I found.  I had little to no baking equipment - mixed the frosting with a fork - it was a hit.   I've been making it for potlucks and family get togethers ever since.  It gets requested all the time.  I swap a little white flour for wheat, a little oil for apple sauce, and use walnuts instead of pecans.  I'm making it this week for a baking contest  - fingers crossed!

I made this cake following the directions, only substituting walnuts for the pecans and everyone loved it. It’s delicious as is.

It was nice and moist but waaaaaay too sweet. Too much icing too, should’ve made half the amount. Won’t make again. Nobody really enjoyed it.

Made this today and it was AMAZING.
I incorporated the highest rated edits.
Plus I only used 2 cups of powered sugar for the frosting and it was sweet enough. Adding the crushed pineapple gave it just the right amount of moisture. 
My husband and I are not a fan of nuts, so we left them out.
It was still delicious!

I modify this, extra carrots, extra pecans (1.5 c) and 1 c dried pineapple.  I cut the oil and sugar a bit to compensate for the modifications.

I make this for my mom every year for her birthday.  We lost my grandma’s recipe and this is just as good.  Now my son wants it for his birthday and my daughter’s friends are asking for it!  I sometimes make this in a larger pan and make 1 and 1/2 times for larger crowd.

This is my absolute favourite carrot cake recipe!! I've been using it for about 10 years now and it's wonderful as is. I don't make any changes to it and it always turns out great. I love making this in the winter, everyone will take a slice in the morning as breakfast with a coffee or tea.

First time ever making carrot cake from scratch. I don't bake much because bf is not big on sweets and I don't need all that sugar! Turned out to be the best carrot cake we've ever had and carrot cake is the only cake bf likes. He LOVED this and I did too. Halved the recipe and followed exactly EXCEPT did not add nuts and did not have a full cup of white sugar left. Used 1/2 white, 1/2 light brown. Baked in a glass 8x8 @ 325 for 38 minutes. Did not specify type of butter in frosting so used unsalted. A little goes a long way! Was amazing and will definitely make again!

Made it as is (increased recipe by 50% to serve 27). The only thing I did differently was I added about 6 oz. of crushed pineapple and swapped out one of the 3 cups of white sugar for light brown sugar. SInce this was a birthday cake I used round/springform pans (1-6.5" and 1-9.5"). The larger pan certainly had to cook longer than the stated 40-50 minutes. 30 minutes in, the middle was still soupy (just like the batter was) and I panicked, but after about an hour it was cooked through. The cake was a hit at my daughter's birthday party!

I didn't make any changes,  and should have because I live at 8,000 ft in elevation. Oops. The cake rose so quick that it spilled all over the oven. With the amount of smoke that this created, I thought surely it was ruined. However, I'm glad I stuck it out and let it finish baking... IT IS DELICIOUS! Its moist and sweet. Besides being a little sunken, due to the mass that had spilled over into the bottom of the oven, this recipe is one I would highly recommend!

I made it today. It was really good. I made a few modifications. Ran out of granulated sugar, so I used honey and it did nicely for making the cake.  The icing was good but a little too sweet for me. The recipe called for the whole bag (4 cups) of the confectioners sugar which made it super sweet.

All in all in was good recipe and I would make it again with a modification on the icing. The cake was so good that it would be no problem eating it by itself as well!

Will definitely make it again.  after reading comments, I grated the carrots with the larger side of grater in order to avoid carrot "mush".  My family thought the consistency of the cake would be better with "mush"! :)

Absolutely Incredible! This recipe far exceeds any other carrot cake my husband and I have ever eaten. Very moist and full of flavor! I added a smidge more cinnamon to the batter and also added cinnamon, unsweetened shredded coconut, and the pecans to the frosting while
mixing. I used about 1/2-3/4 of the amount of sugar required for the frosting because we prefer our frosting to be less sweet and it turned out to be the perfect level of sweetness to compliment the cake, which I baked as muffins and cupcakes! Definitely plan on making this recipe again, perhaps for Thanksgiving!

I followed gneebeanies notes for the cake, used walnuts instead of pecans, and skipped the butter in the frosting. Its a family favorite and the only carrot cake recipe the world needs.

The cake is delicious and moist. Tip make sure you sift dry ingredients at least twice before mixing. It helps with the texture of all homemade cakes

It is perfect. I did make some changes because my husband cannot eat salt, nor cinnamon :(  I blended a tangerine, with the peel and no seeds.  I think was fine.

There are other recipes similar to this one that are better. I did not alter the recipe in any way. Mine collapsed as I see several others did as well.  So it could be lots of things (too much baking power, no apple sauce - too much oil, perhaps over mixing the wet/dry some). Who will know as the written recipe doesn't seem to be what most are actually loving.

Too much oil and baking powder in this cake for my liking. The texture is odd also. The only positive for me was the frosting.

I didn't make any changes to this recipe, and was not a fan. It has a very noticeable oily flavor, and is lacking in spice and acidity (doesn't need much, but the flavor falls flat without it).

Nope! I've tried this recipe twice now, and I followed it word-to-word, to the 'letter', but I found the resulting cake to be far too dense for my liking. It was like biting into cold meatlioaf! To achieve something that would be more cake-like, I think it would require far less carrots, less oil and more flour.

This recipe makes a very moist carrot cake. I followed this recipe 2 times and the cake was good. However, everyone has their own likeness or not for certain ingredients. Now I use a different different nut, cut back on the sugar (i use brown) and add little pineapple. This works better for me. But this recipe still make a moist and good carrot cake.

I DIDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING! Very simple tasty BASIC carrot cake. For  the frosting I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar simply because I prefer my cream cheese frosting a little more cream cheesy than sugary. VERY good!

Ok I don’t usually write reviews but I had to on this one. I normally do not like carrot cake but this was amazing just the way it was. I did it in 2 8in round pans for a layer cake and I didn’t put the pecans inside the frosting (the kids wanted it smooth to be able to decorate) but we sprinkled them on top in a pattern instead (a 2&5 yr old were decorating for Dad). Everyone raved about this cake and said it was the best they ever had. Again I changed NOTHING for the actual cake  itself and the pecans were just on top of the cake instead of folded in the frosting so pretty much the same.

Followed the suggestions for half white sugar, half brown sugar, and using 3/4 canola oil with a half of cp of applesauce.. Added nutmeg, cinnamon and another tsp of vanilla extract and only used 3.5 cps sugar for frosting. Turned out amazing

Carrot is my husband’s favorite kind of cake, but he doesn’t like added nuts or raisins. I simply left out the pecans. It was delicious! He said it’s the best carrot cake he’s ever had!

My favorite carrot cake recipe. I do make adjustments. I use 1/2c of pecans instead of 1 cup. I add 1c of coconut and 1/2c of drained crushed pineapple. The cake was perfect!!!! I get so many compliments every year I make it.

I made it twice in 24hrs for my daughter's bday . The first time, got too dark around the edges . The second time I lowered the temp a bit and watched it closely. The color was better but the cake was still a bit dry.

I was so excited to make this but I just do not love it. I feel like it is missing something. I think that there is too much baking soda taste on it.

So easy and so moist!! I felt like there was too much icing so I cut my cake horizontally and placed a layer of the cream cheese icing in the middle and I still had plenty left over for the top!! P.S. my family loved it!! Will definitely make this again.

I really wanted to like this but couldn’t. It tasted more like cinnamon cake than carrot cake. I used half the amount of sugar for the frosting and it was still too sweet.

Light, delicious frosting!! Most cakes’s frosting is way too sweet for my preference but this recipe’s not!  The cake was moist and not too sweet either.  Will definitely try again with more frosting in the middle if the cake!

Turned out great! Family loved it as an Easter cake. However, need directions as to alternative pan sizes in order to make it a double deck cake. This was the first cake I’ve ever made.

I made this recipe exactly as written, with no changes other than omitting the pecans from the frosting. 

The cake is wonderfully moist as is, and would make great muffins. Just the right amount of dense and light that I like in a carrot cake, and not all the extras that I don't (I dont care for raisins, pineapple or the like in my carrot cake). Just the right amount of spice. 

The frosting was just a tad sweeter than I like, I think next time I will reduce the powdered sugar by about half a cup next time.

The cake its self was great and moist, but I found that the cakes stuck to the pan and crumbled when taking  them out of the pan.  Lining the pans with Parchment paper  could possibly help with that issue. Not sure if I would make it again but it was ok.

Overall, this is a really nice carrot cake recipe! I did notice that it was tricky to get out of the pan and just as hard to flip. It took a bit of effort, but I managed alright; you just have to be extra firm when removing it from the pan and light and quick when flipping it, as it appears to be prone to tear easily. The cake is moist and works beautifully with the cream cheese icing. I did add a teaspoon of nutmeg and about an eighth of a teaspoon of allspice to the cake mix, as I prefer my desserts to have a bit more spice than was in the original recipe. I would recommend this recipe highly and cannot wait to finish eating this cake!

Used Stevia instead of sugar and added raisins ‘cause I like ‘em!
Will definitely make this again, not just because I have an abundance of carrots.

everything was perfect with this recipe! my friend and i are making a layer cake with this recipe and when making the frosting, it may seem a lot of confectionary sugar but you just have to keep mixing. the texture turns out smooth and the cake was fantastic!

Great recipe. I do suggest squeezing the shredded carrots to let most of the juice out. I made extra frosting because who doesn’t like extra frosting :) perfect cake.

I made this as cupcakes, and not only did the centers fall, the batter oozed out all over the top of the pan making it extremely hard to take them out (they were in papers).  The flavor is fine (nothing special), but the texture is just weird - like injera - bubbled up and soft and squishy - not at all like any cake texture I've ever had.

I have mad this cake four times and it just gets better and better every time. Its simple and easy and everybody can enjoy it even if they never like carrots to begin with. The frosting is delicious as well. The only thing I have to say it make sure you add the right amount of baking powder and soda or else the end result won't be pretty.

Pretty good cake! I did make a few changes by using brown sugar in place of white (and less sugar overall), 3/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup yogurt in place of oil, added in a bit more spices, and a little orange zest. I made it into a 3 layer, 6", Easter bunny cake, and it was great! Thank you!

The first time I’ve made carrot cake and it was really good! I personally am not a fan of carrot cake but many friends and family are. It was requested so I chose this recipe. I followed it and it really was a hit! I did not substitute anything.

You can only imagine the tears that came out of my eyes after spending over an hour preparing this disgusting carrot cake for my mother to come home to. Just like the others, my cake fell in the middle and it tasted like baking soda. I followed the EXACT recipe, even double checking that I used teaspoons and not tablespoons. Carrot cake? More like chemical cake. Bad aftertaste, bad look, bad recipe. 
Find another carrot cake recipe and then double check the reviews to be legit cause these aren’t. This is a ZERO star carrot cake recipe. Time, money, and energy wasted.

I omit the pecans, and I only use the recipe for the cake (numerous times now), and it always turns out fantastic. It's always moist and the right amount of sweetness.

The flavor and texture were good, however I've used this recipe a few times and am not satisfied for a couple reasons. This cake is personally too sweet, especially because the cream cheese frosting is already very rich. Also, my layers always cave with this one and to level a carrot cake this chunky is difficult without taking off more than intended. This recipe is ok, but I'll be looking for another one next time.

In the middle of mixing up the batter, I decided to read the reviews, and was worried that the cake wasn't as good as the rating stars indicated, since so many people added pineapple, applesauce, more spices, etc.  But, there was no turning back!  I made the cake exactly like the recipe said, and it was very good!   I will make it again.  Fewer ingredients made it quick to mix up, and my birthday boy (husband) loved it!

I make this a lot and I love it. It is definitely my go-to carrot cake recipe, and carrot cake is my FAVORITE! Yes, I deducted one star, but that's just because I did make the changes found in the top helpful review. I think the recipe is good, but the additions/changes make it out of this world!

I have made this recipe as written several times and it is great.  I love how the outside is almost caramelized.  It is so good and moist.  Other times I have omitted nuts or used walnuts.  Add extra cinnamon and/or vanilla.  It is great as is or easily changed up.

Fam and friends loved it, everyone wants me to make them a carrot cake for their bdays. It was my first time following a recepie from allreceipes and although I added the butter that was meant to be for the frosting, to the cake, by mistake, it came out super moist and deliciuos...Everyone like it, and it was super easy to make for a beginner baker :)

I added more nuts, and doubled the frosting recipe.  I will definitely make again, but with less confectioners sugar.

The only thing I did differently was subtract the chopped pecans. This cake was amazing and the frosting was outstanding. the recipe was easy to follow. I'm a beginner when it comes to baking and this cake came out perfectly. It was still moist after a week. If you're looking for a great and simple carrot cake, I highly recommend.

I did not put pecans into it. I also halved the icing which was plenty to top the cake in the pan. Delicious!

Delicious! I took a suggestion from a reviewer and used 3.5c confectioners sugar in the icing and it was still a bit too sweet. I’d use a little less next time. My 8 year old daughter preferred the cake WITHOUT the icing! I will definitely make this again. My first attempt at making carrot cake and very happy with the results.

Don't make it... it doesn't bake correctly, always caves in in the center, tastes of baking soda and bubbles over and out. I thought it was my error the first time but after reading reviews and attempting again, it still came out the same way.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  The flavor isn’t that outstanding and it’s super oily. 1 1/4 cups of vegetable oil does seem like a lot.  I literally feel like I have grease coming out of my pores after I ate a piece.  I definitely won’t be making this again.  (Edit here....so, my husband and kids ate this and LOVED it!  They think I’ve lost my mind.  My husband said it was the best carrot cake he’s ever had.  So I took my stars from a 2 to a 4.  He still thinks this recipe deserves a 5).

I made this for my husband’s Birthday. He loves carrot cake, but is very picky about it. This game out great! We absolutely LOVE it! I did not add the pecans, though. And I made them as cupcakes instead. The frosting is yummy, but very sweet. If you don’t like sweeter frosting, add a bit more cream cheese (about 3-4 more oz. would be perfect) The cupcakes were moist and delicious! I will definitely make them again!

I made this many times and always received rave reviews!   The only change I made is decreasing the sugar to 1/2 cup or less since I don’t like the cake too sweet.  You can always adjust the cream cheese frosting to get it to the level you’re comfortable with.   Delicious!!

Fabulous recipe! Easy and fast. The only change I made was putting it into two 9 in circular pans and turned it into a layer cake. The icing was a bit sticky to make but overall real delicious. Made for my ma’s birthday and it was a hit!!!! Will for sure make again!

This was a really easy and yummy recipe. The cake was moist!  The first time I made it I thought it was too moist for MY liking but everyone really raved, I also wanted a little more spice to it (personal preference).  The 2nd time around I added some extra cinnamon and cooked it longer than the last time...too dry!  LOL. Don't time it.  When a toothpick comes out clean, it's DONE!  LOL  I made this in a 1" high half sheet pan and it fit like a dream!!  I wasn't a huge fan of the frosting but again, personal preference bc everyone else liked it LOL!!  I have already had several requests for this cake again. Great recipe!

I am a HUGE fan of carrot cake. The best I ever had was at 2 Sisters Deli in Mystic, CT. (They closed up shop and went away decades ago). Their carrot cake was moist and rich... And the closest I've ever come to that mouth-watering goodness was this recipe. It was so GOOD! It was dark and moist and flavorful with just the right amount of crunch from the nuts. Sure I spilled a little extra vanilla in (who doesn't?) but you really don't have to change a thing. This recipe is the real deal.

I made what appear to be the standard substitutions: 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown, 1/2 cup applesauce in place of that much oil, extra vanilla and cinnamon as well as 1/4 tsp each of nutmeg and allspice. Used only 1/2 cup pecans and threw in 1/2 shredded coconut. Baked at 350 in two 9 inch pans for 40 minutes. PERFECTION. And hey, if the recipe is improved by crowdsourcing—why not?

It was so easy! I like my carrot cake simple, so I was happy to find a recipe that excluded the coconut, raisins, and pineapples. I suggest using a cup of brown and a cup of white sugar like the other reviewers suggest and shift the flour 3x to make the cake more fluffy. Made at the last second for my sister’s birthday instead of the box, and there was NO leftovers.

This recipe got rave reviews but I did change it. Every single person present said it was the best, fluffiest, moist carrot cake they ever had. They were kind of freaking out. These are the changes I made:
Sub organic pure cane turbinado sugar
2 c carrot and 1 c zucchini
2 - 9 in rounds , 30-35 mins

Also, I think next time I will reduce the oil by 1/4-1/2 cup and try to replace it with applesauce b/c, oil. And I will only use 3/4 c nuts next time.

Added a little milk to the frosting to loosen it up as it stiffened quickly. Other than that, such a hit.

Ok ya'll, I need help. We absolutely love this recipe. The taste is spot on. However,  as you can see from the picture I can't get my temp/oven to cooperate. Even when I bake this as a cake the edges always are done before the center or is kind of a tougher texture. What can I do? It doesnt taste burnt and like i said we dont want to change any ingredients so I really feel like it has to be my baking. TIA!

Gluten free I get this as a request when we are invited out now all the time!  It is a crowd pleaser I make it regular flour too, depending on who I’m serving it too,  it never fails.

This was probably the best and easiest baked good I've ever made. It was so easy to get the cakes out of the pan and onto my mini cake stand. I followed the instructions to a T and it turned out amazing!! Everyone enjoyed it very much. I'll be making this again!!

Made it twice in one week. Very tasty. After making it (and thoroughly enjoying it) for a family birthday party, we decided it was the right cake to bring to a friend's renewing of marriage vows ceremony and dinner party. It was a big hit there as well, with numerous comments of how excellent it was! So we think this will be our go to cake for future events. It is very easy to make.

I hate to be one of *those* people, but I did make a couple changes to this recipe. (But only a couple! This carrot cake recipe is totally solid on its own.) I added a lil' nutmeg to give the cake a bit more kick. I also reduced the amount of powdered sugar that was called for, partially because I wanted to retain more of the cream cheese flavor, but mostly just to reduce the amount of frosting that would be produced. (This recipe makes waaaayyyyyy too much frosting if you follow it.) The cake turned out really well. Highly recommend this recipe.

Added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon &  1/2 tsp nutmeg. I may change the oil next time to 1 cup instead 1 1/4 cups.I used two 9 inch round pans. I also used the full box of powered sugar for the frosting which was almost equal to what the recipe called for and extra vanilla. Very moist!!

Using pumpkin pie spice would replace nutmeg and ginger and some cinnamon! Add more cinnamon and that’s it as far as spices in this or any carrot cake or pumpkin cream cheese roll ups!

I have made this cake twice already, and I can't get enough of it! I'm usually not the biggest cake fan, but this was so moist and the flavors were delicious! Others have had issues with a sinking middle, but I used this recipe to make a 9-inch layer cake, so I was able to level the cake and get rid of any sagging. Overall, a great cake that you will love! I definitely recommend.

It was a good classic carrot cake, nothing too fancy but a good standard cake. Next time I'll try some of the suggested alterations.

Made cake as posted.  It was easy but found it to be a bit dry.  The icing helped combat that.  Don’t think the high calorie count is quite worth it.

This cake though.. so moist. Not too sweet. I was too lazy to measure out two separate sugar so I just used brown sugar. It was awesome.

Everything tasted perfect.  It was the first time I made a carrot cake.  The recipe was so easy to follow and the video was a bonus.  My only  variance was that I used 2-9" pans and for that more icing would have been better.

I integrated some of the tips the other suggested like using brown sugar and pineapple.

This is the absolute best carrot cake recipe! Moist and delicious with just the right amount of spice. I added one cup each of crushed pineapple drained well and shredded sweetened coconut. I baked this in two 8 inch layers and the icing recipe was adequate for generous frosting.

I have never had a cake turn out like this one did. I don't even know what went wrong, but I ended up with a one inch ring of cakeish product on the edge of the pan and then an almost cookie like consistency in the middle. It quickly went into the garbage where it made the kitchen smell like rotten eggs for the rest of the day. I think that the failure was due to a problem in the recipe as well as mistake by me.

I've made this cake about 5 times now and absolutely love it!  I add raisins, but the only other adjustment is using 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.  Further changes not required!  Great job on the recipe!

This is a very basic carrot cake recipe. We omitted the pecans because we didn’t have any on hand but other than that we followed the recipe to the tee.  Very fluffy and not to sweet.  Cream cheese frosting was great. In our family this is a keeper.

I put 1 and a half cups of sugar in, because it is very sweet. It's the best carrot I've ever add and people often ask me to make it for them.

Amazing. I had never made it before and was afraid it wouldn't turn out so good. But it was amazing. The frosting could be a little less sweet (just don't add so much sugar) but overall truly amazing. Follow the directions and you're set.

This carrot cake is not only the best carrot cake I've had, but the best cake I've had PERIOD. The cake is really moist! Although I must warn you that the icing is very very sweet so if you don't like very sweet cakes, I'd definitely cut the sugar, but the cake itself is not very sweet.

I cooked it for 45 minutes and it smelled/looked done. Insert toothpick, came out clean. I went to slice it and the cake was undercooked in the middle. Frosting was a bit too sugary.

I haven't made this recipe. I agree with TraceyH. It's crazy that people make all of these changes and base the review on their own recipe.  This makes the ratings on the exact recipe false. Post your own recipe and rate it.

This recipe is pretty much perfect. I can't believe that I get constant requests from people to make carrot cake! Last time I made it, my mom told me that it was the only cake she'd ever eaten that was even better than the icing.

Like some other reviewers, I do half brown and half white sugar, and an additional teaspoon of vanilla. I also use cake flour instead of all purpose, to give it a moister texture. Also - and this is purely out of personal preference - I add about a cup of raisins, and a generous amount of ginger, which gives it a spicier taste, with hints of tart from the raisins. Even without any of those changes, though, it's a fantastic recipe.

A fabulous carrot cake! I cut the recipe in half and it still was wonderful! I followed the recipe. It was moist with a lot of flavor and the cream cheese frosting was the icing on the cake. (Sorry. I couldn't resist.)

I adjusted ingredients and I heard rave reviews. 
I added 4 eggs.  I used SoftSilk cake flour.
 Instead of oil I used 4 small , individual cups of applesauce, about 1 cup and a scant more. 
I added a small can of crushed pineapple, juice included. 
I baked in a 13x 9 , following directions to use non stick spray, flour the bottom and use waxed paper.    
My oven runs hot so my time was less. 
The creme cheese frosting was super. 
I added shredded carrots and some pecans on top.  
I'm giving it 5 stars from the compliments.   It went so fast I never tasted it!  
Deeeelicious!

So good and textured! My last carrot cake was gummy and dense! This recipe is really great though! I ran out of eggs, however, and had to use 1/2 cup of applesauce in replace of 2 eggs! Still tasted great, light, and moist. I want another piece!

Best carrot cake I've ever had! everyone loves it. Thank you for this recipe!  Oh all I really did different was add a cinnamon sugar mix to the sides of the buttered pan instead of just spraying it.

Sponge was perfect. For the icing, I halved the sugar and added 4 extra ounces of cream cheese. Turned out great.

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfect! I can normally take or leave carrot cake. I made this for my husband because Carrot Cake is his favorite. I went nuts over this cake it is so good. We shared it with friends who also raved over it. I will definitely make this again! Soon!

Evidently a few others have had the same problem I did with the center sinking and not rising with the rest of the cake. To say this is disappointing is an understatement.  I baked this for father’s day for my husband. Looking at this I’m ashamed to serve it.  I read what others have said for correcting this problem and none of it applies to me.  I didn’t underbeat or overheat the batter.  I used fresh everything down to the salt.  I’ve been baking for over 40 years and know a bad recipe when I see it. I will not be making this again.

I made this cake exactly as written. Twice. The first cake the outside was overcooked and the middle was still completely uncooked. The second time 12hours later I made exactlywhat as written again. The center mostly cooked them fell. Tried to fix with icing cover but was very dry.

Wonderful cake but difficult for the average (inexperienced) baker.  Lots of ingredients. and somewhat costly and time consuming.  I would make this recipe again since it came out fantastic, but only for special occasion.  I shredded my carrots and also used the 1/2 brown, 1/2 white sugar.  Also, I subbed the apple sauce for part of the oil.   Everyone loved it.

yummy.  I used all the changes recommended by readers in addition to adding one cup of raisins and orange zest.  I took it to a memorial day party.  It was a huge hit.

This carrot cake is WAY TOO SWEET! It made me nauseous. I followed the recipe exactly, and I've definitely had better. The only thing I changed was that I used half the nuts it suggested (and it was still pretty nutty). Next time i will definitely tweak it a bit (or a lot), and use maybe half the sugar it says to put. After all, 2 whole cups of sugar is a lot for a 9x5 cake.. Especially for carrot cake. I think brown sugar would've been better, but definitely not 2 cups. I think the amount of vegetable oil was a lot too.. 1 & 1/4 cups? Geez, talk about heart attack. The frosting is even too sweet. I'm not a huge baker so I couldn't really tell how sweet it would end up being. It seemed like a lot of sugar from the beginning though. I feel like this recipe is just really unhealthy.. like I'm kind of afraid to eat it. I LOVE desserts and I'm a big foodie, but I'll tweak this recipe next time to make it healthier and less sweet (or I'll find a healthier recipe). If you like really sweet stuff, then this recipe is good the way it is... With a glass a milk for sure. But for me it tasted like I was eating sugar - in cake form. And I love cake. This recipe has good reviews but most of those five star reviews are from people who completely changed the recipe. That's so misleading! And I found this out AFTER I made it. So sad. What a waste. Why would you completely change the recipe and then give it five stars?! Makes no sense, people!!

Made this but cut in half for 8x8. Also used 2 part apple sauce and 1 part oil along with some crushed pineapple. Used brown sugar and apple pie spice. Turned out so moist and tasty. Making for friends this week-end ...so much fun !!

Made it for the first time and 48 minutes in, the edges were way too dry and the middle was uncooked. It came to a point where the middle of it actually began to crack and sink. Would definitely not try this recipe again.

This was perfect!!! I left out the pecans and I made this with two 9" round pans (I wish I paid attention to the cooking time) and added 1/2 more of all of the frosting ingredients to have enough to frost the sides and fill the middle and I had just a little left over. This is the only carrot cake recipe I have tried and I honestly don't plan on trying any others. (I wish I had a better picture but my husband butchered the right side of it.)

This recipe was awful. I tried making a two tiered cake. While baking one of the cakes blew up in my oven, essentially, and the other one domed in.  I thought perhaps I had done something wrong, then my husband tried. His, too, was awful. This cake tastes like baking powder.  It's great that other people have been able to amend the recipe, but I'm not looking to make substitutions. I want a recipe that's going to make an amazing cake without any changes. 

TLDR; This cake baked horribly, tasted awful, and looked tragic. Don't use this recipe if you want to enjoy a nice cake.

I made this almost completely according to the recipe. (I added raisins before I realized it didn't call for them.) The frosting tasted great by itself but when added to the cake I thought it was too sweet. I don't make cakes often and overall this is an easy to follow, solid recipe that with some minor adjustments will align with my taste profile. Thank you for sharing!

This is a good, basic carrot cake recipe.  I don't like pineapple or raisins in carrot cake, so it was just right for us.  I do like to soak a half cup of dried cranberries in either orange juice or something stronger, and add them to the mix.  The simple frosting was perfect topper.

I’ve made it several times now. Here’s my two cents... it’s awesome. It’s better a day or two later, so bake it early and save it in the fridge. The icing is great as written. Beat it a ton. And I personally think the oil could be reduced. It is incredibly most and is still great with less oil.

I didn’t get to cool down my cake completely because my husband and daughter were too impatient, so the icing melted a little bit. I used half the sugar called for and used cane sugar. It was delicious and very moist. This is the second time I’ve used this recipe and we all just love it.

This recipe is great as is! I make it as cupcakes for my niece's first birthday party and it went over like gangbusters! The only change I made was omitting the pecans but I'm sure it would be delightful with them too!

This is really authentic carrot cake, no raisins or pineapple. This is the same recipe that my grandmother used to make for me over 60 years ago & the one I still use to this day including the cream cheese frosting with the nuts in it instead of in the cake. It is delicious & dense, so if you want fluffy this is not for you. You can substitute a little of the oil with applesauce, but not too much or it changes the taste & becomes more like spice cake. My family loves it just the way it is, no changes.

I made this for my Mom’s birthday, everyone loved it! Nice and moist, beautiful color. I doubled the recipe so I could make a bigger cake and it worked just fine. I also switched out the pecans for walnuts.

This was my first time making carrot cake.  The only changes I made were I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white. And I used walnuts just because that’s what I had. I took it to a potluck and got rave reviews. Two different people told me it was the best cake they ever had!  I didn’t use this frosting recipe, but it was very similar and people loved that, too. I will definitely make it again.

I've made this recipe twice - once as suggested and once subbing in stevia for the sugar. I liked it both ways, but my husband and kids preferred the original recipe.

This was just ok to me as well as to my family. Cake was very dense and not as moist as I would have hoped for. Thankfully I had made a second dessert when I served this on Easter. My search for a good carrot cake continues.

Made the cake recipe as written, with the exception of the nuts since I thought I had them and didn't.  Family raved about it.  A few thought the addition of the nuts would be nice next time, but some liked it so much they said not to change it.  I did put less amount of sugar in the frosting, since we like more of the cream cheese taste to come out.  I used about 2 1/3 cups of sugar in it.  I made mine in 2 nine inch pans, cooked 37 minutes and they were great - no fall in the middle.  It is a rich, heavy cake so make sure you test it with a toothpick and take it out when the toothpick is clean.  I had my time set for 35 minutes then waited a few more till it was done.  Entire cake was eaten yesterday and my family wants another today!!!

I made this for Easter and followed the recipe as written. I wasn't impressed. Given the high reviews I expected a great cake but found it to have too many nuts and wasn't moist. No one cared for it but thankfully I made a pound cake that they all ate instead.

Great recipe, the only thing I changed was I placed the pecans on the sideds of the cake instead of mixing them in with the frosting. I also added my own design / decoration on top.
The center did fall on me, but once I flipped it over to decorate it I had no issues.

This was ok, but not my favorite. I’ll use my old recipe with the pineapple in it next time. I like the moister version. Had no trouble with baking time, being done, etc. Good recipe, just a matter of personal preference.

Okay, so I made this recipe with NO changes. I followed it exactly as the recipe was written. I am no beginner Baker, but I don’t make carrot cake often. I thought with a 4.5 star review and THOUSANDS of people making this recipe... why not? 

Here’s why not. This cake lacks in flavor. I mean SERIOUSLY lacks in flavor. The most flavor you get is from the pecans and the frosting. It’s not very good. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not a “bad” cake... but if you are looking for a flavorful carrot cake, this is NOT the cake for you. 

I won’t be making this recipe again. I’ve made it, it’s decent enough (Walmart carrot cake has more flavor than this recipe) but now I am off to find a better recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, except added a 1/4 tsp nutmeg and replaced the sugar with 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.

In 9 inch cake pans I used all of the batter except for a tiny tiny bit since some people said it overflowed. It cooked for about 38 minutes. I cut circles of parchment paper for the bottom of the pans and sprayed them with cooking spray. It slid right out perfectly.

It was so moist and delicious. Thank you for this very very delicious recipe.

I made this for my grandpa's birthday and everyone loved it! The only change I made, aside from a different frosting, was that I substituted applesauce for 1 cup of the oil (which kept it moist even after over baking). This already went into my recipe box, I will definitely be making it again!

First time making this and it didn’t disappoint. It was excellent. Was tired of making banana cake with cream cheese icing so I asked neighbor what her favorite flavor was as she said carrot cake. I picked this particular recipe because it didn’t require pineapple which I didn’t have on hand or any other odd ingredients. I had everything on hand in pantry. I did leave out nuts for my Neighbor isn’t a fan. I will make again, maybe add less oil and some applesauce in its place. Plus I don’t think it needs all that sugar because the icing is sweet. My husband always says follow recipe once and tweek what you don’t like next time. Baking it’s hard to do that.

This recipe is tremendous! I made cupcakes (30 total) and they were a hit at work. I substituted cake flour and baked them just over 20 minutes. I thought that 2 teaspoons of  cinnamon would be too much, but not at all! I will absolutely make this recipe again. Thank you!

Horrible instructions.  Doesn’t say where  the frosting begins and cakes ends.  I just added 4 cups of sugar  and the butter to in the batter mix. Don’t say to combine everything on the list then put cake and frosting ingredients all on same list. Some of us aren't full time bakers and know how to read between the lines.

A good recipe, although I wound up being a little short on carrots and needed to adjust the baking time because I used a loaf pan. In any case, I added a 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the ingredients as well for a bit of extra spice and really enjoyed it. I'd make it again!

I used the recipe as it was just added nutmeg.  Came out great!  There was left over batter that I used to make muffins.

I followed the recipe exactly and the cake tasted bland. It didn't taste like any spice nor carrots.

This carrot cake is awesome! I made two nine inch round layers, and it worked out perfectly. The amount of icing was just fine also, without any editing.  Instead of white sugar in the cake batter, I went with 1/2 c dark brown sugar and used coarse natural sugar for the remainder (think Sugar in the Raw). I loved the deeper flavor this imparted in the finished cake. Also, I added a couple tablespoons of honey in the icing which complimented the flavor profile of the cake. Overall, this recipe is a winner!

If I were to only rate this on taste, it would get 4.5 stars.  This has a wonderfully sweet flavor and was not incredibly dense.  Due to a sensitivity, I did not use the nuts.  Instead I put them around the outside after the cake was frosted.  I had one bite that had a bitter taste of baking soda, but it was not throughout the cake.  The middle did sink.  That was kind of a bummer.  Thus the 3 stars.

Made this as-is without the cream cheese frosting, but used muffin pan for an easier grab-and-go snack for us (just adjusted baking time) and it turned out ok.  Maybe I'm used to eating a more flavorful carrot cake so I will try to do some of the suggestions from other reviews next time. But overall, I'm happy with the outcome.

OMG this is in the oven right now, and it smells heavenly. We used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of 2 cups  of white sugar. Also, we added extra cinnamon and vanilla extract. However, we graded 3 cups of carrots and it took like 1 1/2 hours, so I suggest you get some extra help with that if you are doing it by hand.

This is the 3rd time I've made this cake !  Everyone in my family loves it ! And I always take a portion to a lady I work with.  This is her favorite cake and the only dessert that doesn't spike her blood sugar.  I have not made any changes to this recipe.
Perfect the way it is !

I loved it just the way it is. Kudos to those of you who dislike people changing the whole recipe then commenting on their own recipe. It really bugs me. I just skip them & go to others. Thank you for a delicious carrot cake recipe.

This cake was very simple to make and wasn't gonna take as much time as I thought it would. The cream cheese frosting recipe was great, but it was a little too sweet for me and my family so I lowered it to 3 cups and a little less butter and cream cheese. The cake itself was really good and my family enjoyed it a lot. It was moist and didn't take a very long time to cool. One change I would make to the cake batter is to add a little less salt and vanilla, everything else was just perfect and it fit my tastebuds. I will definitely make this recipe again in the future :)

Easily the best carrot cake I've ever had. It was moist and delicious, and I loved how many nuts there were (I'm a nut fan though!)

The recipe made too much for my 9" round cake pans, so it overflowed. It stuck and tore a little to the pan when trying to remove it, but it wasn't noticeable once I put the icing on. Next time I'll sprinkle the pecans on top of the cake instead of mixing them into the icing.

Great recipe, can really taste every ingredient. The only thing I will do differently next time is put the pecans on top of the icing rather than in it. It was a little difficult to ice the cake with the pecans. So it's not the prettiest cake ever, but it's  SO moist and tasty!

I love this recipe. The cake always comes out moist and has great flavor. I made it in a 9x13 pan but didn't turn it out to cool. Honestly I frosted it right in the pan and ate it out of the pan (perks of not sharing). Only changes I made were to the frosting because I wanted less sugar. I used 3 cups instead of 4 and doubled the vanilla. Even with less sugar I had more than enough frosting with some left over.

Definitely would make again but would add the can of crushed pineapple as suggested by top reviewer, as cake was a bit dry; I went with all the other  top reviewer’s suggestions.  If you’re making a 9x13. I think you could cut the frosting down  by 1/3.

I made this recipe as it was written (unlike the seeming majority of reviewers, who altered It beyond recognition in many cases) and it came out delicious. I had to leave out the nuts because we have some no-nut people in our house, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly. This was a challenge for me because I thought the CUP of vegetable oil was really too much, and worried the cake would be greasy and heavy. However, the end result tasted like a restaurant dessert. I iced the entire thing with a traditional cream cheese frosting. I will definitely make it again, possibly reducing the oil content and adding some powdered ginger and nutmeg to boost the spiciness.

My boyfriend asked me to bake a carrot cake for his mother over Thanksgiving because it's her favorite. I had never made it before and looked up a few different recipes to make sure I didn't disappoint. I did tweak the recipe a little as listed below (changes/additions marked with ***). His mother said it's the best carrot cake she's ever had in her life!


Ingredients: 
4 eggs, 
3/4 cups vegetable oil***, 
1/2 cup of applesauce***, 
 8 oz crushed pineapple (drained)***,
 1 cups white sugar***, 
1 cup of brown sugar***, 
2 teaspoons vanilla extract,  
2 cups all-purpose flour, 
2 teaspoons baking soda, 
2 teaspoons baking powder, 
1/2 teaspoon salt, 
1 tablespoon ground cinnamon***,
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg***,

I LOVE this recipe. I decided to make it for my boyfriend and I for our little thanksgiving alone this year. And oh my god I think it’s the best thing I’ve ever baked! We’ve already eaten half the cake in two days time! (We dug in the night before thanksgiving) I only tweaked a few things but generally kept everything the same. I added more cinnamon to the cake because I love strong cinnamon flavor in cake, a bit more powdered sugar into the icing and put less pecans in the batter with none on top, and a dusting of cinnamon on top.

I find this always turns out nice if you follow the recipe.  But I halve the amount of sugar. If we don't have pecans , walnuts are nice too.

I wanted to review this recipe as I too get really tired of people changing it and then reviewing it.   I like to read what they think of the exact recipe as written.    I did follow this to the letter and it was excellent .   Of course you can tweak with any recipe but this is just wonderful as is.     Beginners be sure and try this and you will not fail!!!!!!!

This recipe is wonderful just as it is!!!! I didn't make any changes but only made half the amount of icing as the full amount was to much for me (and left the nuts out completely). I always get rave reviews every time I make it!

I made a bunch of the recommended changes, and ugh, it didn't come out right at all. The outer edges burned while the inner parts were gooey. I suspect it might be because of my oven, which is pretty low quality. That said, I guess I won't be making this recipe again. I do, by the way, love the frosting! I am pretty much eating it off my weirdo cake.

I will start with saying that carrot cake is my favourite cake. I am sorry I did change the tiniest things mainly out of necessity. I used half white half brown sugar only because I strongly believe carrot cake needs the caramelly flavour of brown  in it. I was making it with a 7 year old who doesn't like nuts so I added chocolate chunks (not necessary in my opinion but they worked beautifully) and because I was playing at the same time with said 7 year old I FORGOT to put in the cinnamon. I could have kicked myself and I put some on top while the cake was cooling before frosting it. I have to say in spite of this it was still one of the best carrot cakes ever. Beautifully moist and delicious and the texture was perfect. I preferred it the next day when the frosting had really set. I actually don't think I'd use another recipe thank you so much!!

I love this recipe.  My mom made it for my family every Easter for as long as I can remember.  After I took over making it for Easter, I substituted 1/2 c. of the oil for apple sauce, because as an adult, I didn't like that oily texture.   It took out the oily feel without sacrificing moisture or taste.  My family still loves it and looks forward to it every Easter :)

Everyone in the family loved this one, right down to the dogs who stole the rest of the pecans off the pantry shelf. I used the 3 cups of carrots, I also used 1 cup of brown sugar & 1 cup of white sugar. I also took the advice of other users and used half a cup of Whipping Cream. I had to get the kids from school so It sat in the fridge for about 4 hours. I didn't find the frosting to be too runny. It was really nice, really light and fluffy! I live at 9,200 ft so I added two tbs of extra flour. Next time I will adjust and add vanilla pudding to keep it a little more moist at this altitude.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was amazing! I didn't have pecans, but it's delicious without them. I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I was able to make 4 small 8 inch cakes with one batch. It was perfect.

I loved it but made a few changes. I reduced the sugar to 1 cup of brown sugar and 3/4 cup of white sugar . I also ommited the nuts because they are horrendously expensive in Nigeria. It was a hit.

I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I changed was to add 1/2 cup of raisins. I also only had 4oz of cream cheese, so I halved the frosting recipe and it was more than enough for a 9" x 13" cake. It's a keeper!

Wow! Excellent cake!  I didn't change anything, except skipping nuts in cake batter, and only adding them to outer vertical edge of the frosting.  I also stacked two nine inch rounds, but I don't consider that a recipe change.  I wanted to rate the recipe as is, though it was tempting to make changes after reading other comments, but honestly, it was so good as is, that I'll do the same thing next time I make it.  I failed to grease my pans before flouring, because I used silicone pans, and my cakes stuck a little in the corners, my bad.  I'll add an update after serving it to my mother for her birthday in two days. She requested a carrot cake with cream cheese frosting, and this was perfect (and relatively simple)!  Thank you so much!!!

This is a great cake! I needed to make it gluten free so I used a gluten free all purpose flour and it turned out amazing. I also prefer more of a cream cheese flavor to my icing so I used 2 blocks of cream cheese with the butter and only 2 cups of confectioners sugar. Will definitely be making this again!

Substituted 1 cup of white sugar with brown as suggested by other reviewers. Added a little bit of milk into the mixture. Used a little extra cream cheese in the frosting.  Tasted great , but the cake sunk a bit in the middle.

This carrot cake is really really yummy!!! I added one cup of drained crushed pineapple, used one cup white sugar, one cup brown sugar, I also added 1/2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg, also I used a total of 3 tsp cinnamon. I also decided to make this gluten free so I used Cup-for-Cup gluten free flour blend. I had everyone at the party loving it and saying it was the best carrot cake they had ever had!!

The recipe is great but for some reason mine didn't come out very well. I think it may be because I baked it in a bundt pan instead of 2 round pans. I don't know but it tastes good.

To be honest, I didn't bake it as it was written by the original poster. I baked it with the suggestions from the comments as posted by gneebeanie and it was amazing! I'm not usually a fan of carrot cake (or carrots at all for that matter!) but this was delicious with the alterations.

I've tried many carrot cakes but this one takes the prize.  This is the only recipe I use when making a carrot cake.  The only thing I don't like are nuts.  I just eliminate them from the recipe and it is wonderful.  I highly recommend it to everyone.

It's a great recipe.  It's so soft and moist, and the taste is just perfect. Everyone in my family loves it. I made it several times, but since I don't like cream cheese, I make vanilla pudding cream instead.

I'm not a fan of carrot cake, however I have to make this for a friend. The cake was fluffy and moist and the frosting was wonderful. 

 Here are a few changes I made;
1)  separated egg whites, beat to stiff peaks and fold in egg whites at the end of the recipe. 
2) replace 1/2 cup of olive oil with one stick of butter 
3)added 1/2 cup of chopped golden raisins

The best carrot cake recipe ever. Have made a few times to take to functions and always get positive reviews. Stays moist for over a week and also works well as a cupcake recipe

I tried this recipe twice. The first time I could taste baking powder.I assumed that I had made a mistake. However the second time around it still tastes like baking powder. Otherwise the texture and flavor was fine.

Made the recipe as it is stated and it was a flop. The flavour was good but the cake didn't turn out looking nice and was deflated in the centre...so was disappointing. I'd look for a different recipe for next time.

I've made this recipe twice, at the same time. My dad is celiac, so I made a gluten free version, and a regular version, and honestly, the gluten free version came out much better. It was denser (most gluten free baked goods tend to be) but it also didn't have the "airy" or strong baking powder taste the regular ones had. They also tasted a lot sweeter. I'm not sure why, because I followed the recipe to a T for both, besides using gluten free flour. My suggestion would be to probably add less baking soda and powder, or up the sweetness a touch ?

This recipe was made as is. However I had to cook it longer because it didn't seem to cook as well as I was hoping. Still the best carrot cake I've had to date.

I've made this cake 3 times now. It's so amazing! I don't change a single thing. To all the people saying this recipe is terrible, dry, and doesn't cook correctly is just doing it wrong. Gotta layer those flavors, and not over mix. I also think doing 2 - 9" rounds is much better then a 9x13 every time. Never just set your timer and forget all about your cake, let the cake tell you when its done. I have to cook mine like 10 mins less.

I made this this past weekend and it was a huge hit!!!! I made the recipe as is, except I didn't use all of the sugar in both the cake and the icing that the recipe called for. I probably only used about 1 1/2 cups of sugar in the cake and about 2 cups of the confectioner's sugar in the icing. Four cups seemed like it would be too sweet and it tasted just fine with half the sugar. Also, I used walnuts instead of pecans, as I had those on hand. 
My only critique is I think it needs more spice. Next time, I may try adding a little nutmeg. Will definitely make again!

Really enjoyed this recipe however the changes I made were to hopefully lower the fat content a bit for medical reasons.....i used olive oil, omitted the nuts and actually used about a 1/4 cup of light mayo to moisten the cake itself. I didn't make the icing for 1st bake.  I wanted to taste the cake alone and get its true flavor to start.  The outcome was pretty darn good.  Will make again. Figured I'd drop a star-rating because of my alterations,  to be fair.

Will definitely be making this again!  I did add one small tin of crushed pineapple (well drained), used one cup white sugar and one cup brown.  I didn't have pecans so used walnuts.  It tasted wonderful fresh but even better day two and three.  Even the two and three year old grandchildren loved it. Thanks for a great  recipe.

This is a great carrot cake. I have never made a carrot cake before and this was easy. Moist and great flavour.

The Cream Cheese Icing needs some work, not a big fan. I will swap it out next time for a different recipe.

This carrot cake is amazing! I followed most of gneebeanie's suggestions (check out her review). I did not include pecans in the cake - just on top as a decorative element. I also did not include the pineapple some have suggested as my wife is allergic. It still was the best carrot cake I have ever had.

Amazing! Perfect the way it is written.
Also amazing when I added 3/4 c unsweetened coconut, 3/4 c raisins and more pecans and walnuts. So delicious and moist. Will make this again and again.

This carrot cake is delicious and my favorite!  I always am complemented on my baking skills (little do they know:))  I dont alter the recipe much except adding a bit more cinnamon, reducing the oil by 1/4 cup, and making sure the 3 cups of carrots are packed full.  The result is the best carrot cake I have ever tasted!!  The only problem I have come across is the cream cheese frosting--we dont have philadelphia cream cheese here in Turkey so I have to use Labneh.  It runs all over the place when I go to spread it, but once it stays in the fridge for a night the final outcome is delish!  Thank you for sharing  a recipe that  is a must to pass on to my daughter!

This recipe was easy to follow and the result was very tasty. I ended up with a lot of frosting left over, which will be used on Graham cracker snacks.

Bugs Bunny's mom would take notes on how to make this truly delicious cake. I followed Dneebeanie recommendations: 1. Half white sugar half brown sugar 2. Use 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting mix 3. Added 8 oz. can of crushed pineapple which I drained and I didn't add pecans to the frosting just the cake. I used the larger holes on the grater to grate the carrots  as other reviewers suggested. I baked it in an 9x13 pan. The finished product made me scream "Holy Carrots"! It's that good. Carrot cake is not my go to - but it was Easter and my family loves it so had to give this one a go. Glllllaaaaaaaad I did. Even my kids liked it and what kid likes carrot cake?? Do yourself a favor and make this cake and don't skip the frosting. This is the best cream cheese frosting I've ever had. Will use this for a red velvet cake I foresee in the future.

I used some applesauce and I wish I could've tried 1 can of pineapple too. Replaced pecans with walnuts and almonds. Also, I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla, and reduced the sugar for the frosting. Added some raisins and shredded coconut and all done. Didn't last long. Amazing texture!

I LOVE this recipe!!! Not only do I love it, but everyone I have made this for loves it. Thank you so much for posting it. It's such an amazing and versatile cake!
I have made this a bunch of times, I've baked it using the recipe as is, I've made it using vegan ingredients and I have made it using recommendations from other reviews. The big changes I made were mostly done for personal preference. I followed Gnee Beanie's recommendations and in addition I added a handful of shredded coconut to the cake mix and frosting. Finally,  I decorated it by loosely piling some carrots that have been candied in brown sugar and maple syrup and then curled around the handle of a spoon. (Super easy! I used a recipe from Epicurus)
I'd like to offer some  cake advice, When you take your cake pan out of the oven, let it rest for a minute, then put the pan in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to cool. This makes cakes, fantastically moist and it pops out of the pan when you're ready to ice it. No more cracks!
Despite the all the changes I've made, this really is the most amazing carrot cake I've ever had! Thank you so much for posting it.

I broke a personal rule, based on reviews I altered the original recipe the first time I made it . The recipe sounded yummy however, I knew it had too much oil and sugar for my family's diet.  As suggested: combo of white/brown sugar, substituted applesauce for some of the oil, extra spices, drained pineapple. After all the additions, I found I needed to add an extra cup of flour. The cake was DELICIOUS! Extremely moist and flavorful. 
I agree with a comment made, someone needs to post the revised recipe as Carrot Cake IV.  It's a keeper!

The flavor was very good, but it came out very oily and dense. I think it needs more flour or less oil.

My 11year old daughter made this by herself. I only helped shred the carrots. It was the best carrot cake I have ever eaten. Altering the recipe  slightly by exchanging vegetable oil with coconut oil. The cake was super moist and delicious.

It was very very OK. It tasted more of a spice cake than a carrot cake. I may use this recipe again, but if I do I'll use a cup or more of grated carrots. Very moist, though!

This is the first carrot cake I ever made way back in 1977.  It came from a La Leche League cookbook and was sooo good.  As with ANY recipe, you can always tweak it to your liking.  I don't like nuts therefore I don't use them. I love raisins, so you guessed it, in they went.  More spice, less spice, more oil less oil, whatever.  If you are a decent cook than any recipe can be made into just what you are looking for.

My 12 year old made this recipe today and followed it exactly as  it was stated. She's not a big improviser and doesn't eyeball ingredients so everything was measured to a tee. The biggest problem we encountered was that she filled the 9x13 pan as instructed in the recipe and put it in the oven.  I checked in on it about 15 minutes into baking and it was bubbling over.  It had a strange fizzing quality that I attributed to too much baking soda. I rechecked her amount and she assured me she used only what was in the recipe.  It was liquid enough that I used a ladle and scooped out about 2 cups of batter . 2 cups of batter too much? It had almost a foamy quality so once it settled it wasn't actually 2 cups but baking in the oven it would have continued overflowing.  I don't know what was wrong but I'm guessing something between baking soda and/or baking powder reacting to something in the recipe? 
Taste: It tastes good! A little bland for my particular carrot cake taste but good texture and moisture! A  little clove, all spice, nutmeg, or more cinnamon wouldn't have hurt. Mainly I just didn't appreciate the emergency of scooping out hot batter before it dripped all over my oven.  Anybody else had this happen? Thanks.

I made this yesterday as a practice for Easter. I cut the recipe in half and served it to my dinner guests. They loved it and asked me to make it for our Easter potluck. I thought the icing was a bit too sweet. I will modify it next time.

First I'm embarrassed to say I am a advent baker of many decades, however, I hope this carrot cake turns out. The directions and ingredient list are terrible. First, the ingredients are not in order, dah, listing 1/2 cup soften butter at the end of list plus directions did not say to mix the butter with the eggs & oil, therefore I missed it! Had to pull my cake out of the oven after 5 mins in to now add the butter! Plus directions do not say to add the carrots! I did remember that thou. 
Very poor proof read of directions on your end. 
If, big if,  if cake turns out after all my frustrations and error, I will rewrite the list of ingredients in the correct order and include all the steps that should of been in there to begin with. 
Fingers crossed.

This cake is simply delicious! It turned out tremendously right.
My only question is about refrigerating it or not, for the frost is made of cream cheese, which is generally kept in the fridge...
I'd rather not, because I'm not very fond of cakes that need refrigeration.

This was fantastic! I made a few changes per the most helpful review that I read and this turned out amazing. My family was raving about it and they are very honest! Here is what I did different:
1) using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 
2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 
3) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 
4) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 
5) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. 

For the frosting, I only used 3-3.5 cups of powdered sugar, and it was more than sweet enough, with a nicely balanced cream cheese vs. sweet flavor. Aldo use large cheese grater to grate the carrots!

I thought  this was a very good cake. However I felt the icing was very very sweet. I think the next time I make this I may start with half the sugar then go from there. However  I was very pleased with the overall results as written.

I have never written a review before but this was a disaster. Fell in the middle and crumbled. I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews.

Awesomely moist! I did follow other's advice and added an extra teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon, substituted 1/2 cup of oil for applesauce and added a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg. It was great.  My kids 8-13 loved it too. Now part of my "best of the best" collection.

This really is the best carrot cake recipe!! I have made many throughout the years and this will be one I use from now on.  I ground the pecans into smaller pieces and toasted in the microwave for a couple of minutes and cooled before adding them. I also used part brown sugar and a cup of drained crushed pineapple. The cake got rave reviews from all!

This is essentially the same recipe I use; I got mine from Better Homes and Gardens cookbook, and mine doesn't call for pecans (of course you can add them in, or walnuts would be good too). Everyone who eats it, praises the moistness and carrot-y flavor. One tip: I buy a 1 lb. bag of baby cut carrots and put them in the food processor. It come out to pretty near 3 cups.

When I was a child I made scrumptious carrot cake using vegetable oil, but lost the recipe my Mother gave me.  I looked for many years to find another one and tried others not calling for vegetable oil - I found them heavy alternatives.  So I was delighted to find this one, and immediately tried it.  The children and I simply loved this cake.  It was very close if not equal to the one I had.  

Some modifications - I replaced the pecans with raisins, and from a health perspective chose not to make the cream cheese frosting.  I also used cane sugar and reduced the amount added knowing the raisins would provide their own sweetness, and it worked out perfectly.  I will be making this again for sure, and if you try it, the family hopes you also enjoy it.

This tasted really good, the only tiny issue I had with it was it was slightly too moist (verging on wet would be more accurate), but I think that's because I needed to squeeze more juice out of the carrots before adding them. The flavor was great and the texture didn't bother anyone else, I'm just picky about my baking.

This was absolutely delicious! Tasted better every day! I used walnuts instead of pecans and next time I might use some more spices, but overall very pleased. Will be making this for my husband's birthday every year now :)

Followed this recipe exactly and was super disappointed.  It was spongy and tasteless.  I felt like it was a waste of my time and ingredients.   I'm disappointed that it won't be eaten and will end up in the trash.

I cut the recipe by half because I didn't have a big enough pan, and it turned out delicious! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as is, except I cut back on the sugar by nearly half and it was still sweet enough for me. Will definitely make again.

I'm really upset with this recipe. I picked it based on the star rating. And while it wasn't inedible, I certainly won't be making it again. I'm really irritated. One shouldn't have to read through a thousand comments to figure out it's crappy except for to change this and add that and completely change the recipe to  make it a five star rated cake.  I bake A LOT and I've never had a cake fall like this.  It was fairly tasteless, a box  mix would've been better. Like I said, not inedible, but not worth it to make.

Very moist and tasty! I ground my carrots with half a can of pineapple which made it tastier, and added a little crushed almond. Less sugar, and perfection! Very delicious!

I love this recipe I halved it and it was fantastic. I skipped the nuts but I'm certain it would have been great with them too.

The best carrot cake recipe by far!! I use walnuts instead of pecans and I think they are necessary to balance out the sweet of the cream cheese frosting...which is amazing by the way! (The only way to make carrot cake!)

I used the 'most helpful positive review' and made these changes: 1) using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 2) used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 white flour, 3)added 1T vanilla 4) adding 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (drained) 5) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 6) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 7) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.   I made cupcakes.  Baked at 350 for 15.5 minutes.  It made 31, but they were a little full.  Might be able to stretch out to 3 dozen.  I left pecans out of the frosting, personal preference.

This was incredibly fabulous!  I followed the first reviewers. (gneebeannie),  advise as she had gone thru 4-5 pages of reviews and the cake turned out great!   I believe this cake is about the best carrot cake I've eaten.

I made this as a birthday cake for a friend who absolutely loves carrot cake. It's her favourite. I do a lot of baking but this was my first carrot cake... Everyone at the party was asking who made the cake and they all said it was amazing. nice and moist. I made one change which was substitute 1/2 the pecans for walnuts (in the cake mix and the icing).

This recipe has gone into my recipe book. it's not too sweet and apart from the Icing it was lactose friendly which was better for my friend :)

This cake tasted good.  But, I made it twice, once as cupcakes and once as a layer cake, both fell in the middle.  I bake quite a bit so am not new to baking.  Because of a not so nice appearance I could only rate as three stars.

I'm giving this recipe only 2 stars although the end result was good. I just had to make too many alterations to the original for it to be good. I have to point out though, that us Europeans don't like our pastries as sweet as Americans and that might distort my view of this recipe.

Luckily I read the reviews before I started. I'm sure it would have been awful if I had trusted the recipe blindly. I made a lot of alterations and if I make it again I will be making even more changes. 1) It is WAY too sweet. I cut the sugar for the cake by a fourth and I still think it's too sweet. As someone suggested, I used 50/50 brown sugar and white sugar which was really good 2) I added a teaspoon of vanilla, half a teaspoon of cinnamon, and 1/4 tsp nutmeg. 3) I used less pecans. And the frosting: I cut the sugar by a third and it was still very sweet. I added 3 tbsp lemon juice to make it more balanced.

Made my very first carrot cake with this recipe, and even my fussy hubby said "It's good!". It took exactly 50 min for toothpick came out clean, rose beautifully and did not sink in the middle. The recipe amount fits my springform pan just right (9" wide, 4" tall). I dont like my cakes too sweet, so I used only 2.5 cups of icing sugar for the frosting, and for the batter I cut down oil to 1 cup, replaced 1 cup of white sugar with brown sugar, cut down baking soda to 1 tsp, added 1/2 cup of drained crushed pineapple (from a can) and slightly increased the amt of cinnamon to 2.5 tsp instead. Dont fancy pecans so I caramelised some chopped walnuts and almonds for the topping. But strange the 1/2 cup of walnuts that I added to the batter was close to getting burnt though, not sure why, but good thing it didnt affect our enjoyment of the cake. Thanks for the recipe!

No changes necessary! Everyone loves it

I've made this many times, and usually I will do half brown sugar, half white sugar. I'm not sure it makes a huge difference, and I've done it with white sugar-only several times, too.

People go wild for this carrot cake. I've had many many people tell me things like, "I don't usually like carrot cake, but I like this one!" and "This is the best carrot cake I've ever had." Nothing else I've ever made has ever garnered the praise that this carrot cake does. I'm always embarrassed to tell people it's just 'Carrot Cake III' from AllRecipes.

The amounts listed for the frosting are way too much, though. I've been making this for years, and I'm surprised it hasn't been corrected. Clearly, you shouldn't need 4 cups of confectioners sugar to make frosting for a single cake.

This recipe was amazing! Everyone enjoyed it very much.
But, I made my cream cheese frosting with only three cups of confectioners sugar and margarine instead of butter, and the frosting turned out phenomenal

Five stars all around. I made this as a birthday cake for my husband, but considering two people alone should not be allowed to hoard the calorific cake to ourselves, I split up the remainder to my work bistro and workmates. It was a hit! I personally adored the cake, but I think the icing came off a bit too overwhelmingly sweet to some here in the UK--the bistro chef here suggested adding some lemon next time to the icing, but gave a thumbs-up to the cake itself. A lovely recipe for fans of carrot cake!

Moist, lots of taste and easy to make! 
I added 1 extra tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg, and 1 cup of white and one of brown sugar. Saved myself grating by using the Thermomix (smooth from 2 to 5). 
Fantastic recipe!!

DELICIOUS!!!!

Adding the crushed pineapple (8 ounces & squeeze out most of juice) gives it such a wonderful and moist texture! Loved the recommendation to use 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Also, I used 3/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce. Added extra vanilla & cinnamon to taste. I used only 1 cup of sugar for my frosting and found it to be a good balance.

This was by far the best carrot cake I have ever made!  I added 1 can of diced pineapples to the cake batter and to 1/4 of the frosting.  I will be making this many times again.

I followed the recipe, didnt make any changes. I personally didn't like it, cinnamon flavor is strong, it is also too sweet for my taste. The texture is good. It took 50min. 
It's so sweet and the cinnamon is so strong that my husband couldn't tell it was a carrot cake. I made it for his birthday and it's his favorite so it surprised me that he couldn't tell.

Very moist and delicious cake! Stayed fresh in sealed container in fridge for several days. I reduced the powdered sugar in the icing to 3 cups, and was still a little sweet to me, but I don't like super sweet in general (my husband thought the sweetness was perfect)

I followed this recipe from start to finish (no changes or substitutions), and even substituted gluten free one-to-one flour...my family and friends say it's the best carrot cake they have ever tasted!  I have made it twice now and both times it was perfect. Moist, flavorful.  The second time, I used two rounds instead of one "rectangle" and make a two-layer cake with the frosting in the middle.  Even better than the first time. 

Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

This recipe tastes great however I've made it twice and the center of the cake sinks. Does anyone know how to prevent the sinking of the center?

I followed the recipe exactly as it is written and it was a great success! I grated the carrots in my food processor on the smaller setting and found this to be the perfect texture once baked. This recipe worked beautifully in a bundt pan. It is a definite keeper!

Since I made a lot of changes, it doesn't feel right to give this recipe five stars (even though the cake I made was definitely worthy of that rating). The changes I made are: 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white, +1 teaspoon of vanilla, +1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg. I had wanted to use 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce since I saw many reviews recommending to do so, but I didn't have any applesauce! So I used the amount of oil listed in the original recipe and it was great! Not oily, just moist and delicious.

Like many of the comments, after making a few adjustments, the cake came out delicious (for the cake: adding 1 extra tsp vanilla, 1/4 nutmeg, instead of 2 cups of white sugar... add 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar, and no pecans | for frosting: add 2 1/2 cups of granulated sugar instead of 4 cups) OH AND TIP: if you are using a dark pan, bake at 325 degrees for 45 minutes. And add eggs one at a time into mixture. Overall, it was pure perfection!

I used cake flour to make the cake a bit softer and cut the sugar in half to let the natural sweetness of the carrots come out.

The best carrot cake ever! This was my first time making a carrot cake from scratch and it was amazing. I used the recipe along with the suggested changes plus a couple of my own so that it would suit my family's taste. I used fresh pineapple... half of what the recipe called for and I only put a sprinkling of nuts over the frosted cake. I used more cinnamon and less nutmeg as well.
I think that a recipe is a guide not an absolute. We should be free to make it our own and still rate the guide recipe as a great one because without it we would not have the end result.

I was forced to add 1 cup of shredded sweet potatoes, because i only had 2 cups of carrots.  Same sweet and moister content so figured it really didn't matter.  It was one BIG cake.  The icing wasn't enough so I had to add 2 more 8 oz. pkgs. of cream cheese, but I didn't add any more suger to the icing (I like it a little more tart).  But very moist and I have added it to my favorite cookbook recipes.

As much as I hate leaving bad reviews, this carrot cake isn't very good.  I made it exactly to specs, and it was mediocre at best.  It also took much too long to cook (over 60 minutes) and, despite using a bundt-style pan, the center was still very gooey and uncooked.   I'm a very experienced baker (almost 40 years of baking), and keep my oven calibrated so I know it wasn't  a temperature issue.  

It also just tasted blah.  Almost had no flavor at all.  I would recommend a couple of teaspoons of lemon extract instead of the vanilla in the cake, using 3/4 cups apple sauce in lieu of the oil, and maybe adding a teaspoon or two each of ground clove, nutmeg,  And allspice in addition to the cinnamon.  

Even the icing was no good as written.   I also made it to specs and let the family taste it before I iced the cake.  No one liked it.  WAAAAY too sweet and no real cream cheese taste.  It was also very thin and wouldn't have spread well.  So I had to add 16 oz. more of cream cheese and about  1 tbsp of cornstarch just to get it stiff enough to spread well without dripping.

My first attempt at carrot cake was a success! I made some of the slight modifications others did to this recipe. I used 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup apple sauce, I used half brown and half white sugar, I added a half teaspoon of nutmeg, and I left out the pecans. I baked two cake rounds at 350 for 40 minutes (checked with toothpick). The cake was a huge hit! I will make again except I might be tempted to add some more cinnamon and maybe Allspice next time.

This carrot is is Awesome!......as good as any fine restaurant!  The only modifications I made were cutting down on the sugar a little bit, using 3/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugar AND I always use applesauce in my recipes, so I added 2 small 4 oz containers which makes the cake healthier and very moist!

Amazing carrot cake!  I made this twice for two birthday parties and it was a huge hit.  I added 1/4 cup molasses to the wet mixture and it gave the cake an extra layer of flavor, and darkened the color.  I also substituted 2 cups of sugar with 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.

I love this cake! I did not change any of the ingredients or steps. The cake is moist and delicious. The frosting too. My only complaint (my own fault really) is that I had way too much batter for my size cake pan, and it kind of oozed out onto the bottom of my oven as it was rising! I was able to salvage most of it and learned to half all the ingredients for next time (or until I get a bigger pan). Love it!

I tried recipe after reading so many great reviews. I added pineapple and graded apples as well. Instead of adding 1 cup of white sugar, I added only 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 of brown sugar. Cake was a hit!!

I tried this recipe despite of already having a pretty awesome one...I've got to say it definitely surpass my previous recipe (one I had saved from many years back, not this one).  I did add 1/4 cup of pineapple juice, as well as small pineapples chunks and raisins.  The cake was neither dry nor too moist.  My husbands co-workers raved that it was the best carrot cake they had ever eaten, and suggested I sell this cake!  I usually make carrot cake, when in the mood for carrot juice.  I take advantage of already having  the shavings from my juicer. I'm not trying to one up the original recipe, or take merit from it...that goes to all the negative people who've left bad comments about people changing the recipe...my advice is skip it, you dont HAVE to read it. I incorporate what "I like into what I eat" My notes are for those who've tried the original recipe,  but would be open to make additions that maybe they TOO like. The hostility on here is insane! Let's keep the focus on this recipe, and find something better to do with time.

I followed the recommendations on the most rated comments ; pineapple,  applesauce,  brown add white sugar.  As well as reduced the powdered sugar in the icing.  My family thought this was amazing!

This was my first carrot it turned out perfect! color, height, no sinking no issues. My only concern was the taste of baking powder even after it had cooled. I will trying it with less baking powder/soda but otherwise everything else is great

This turned out great! Everyone said it was he best carrot cake they had eaten! I didn't make any changes to the ingredients in the recipe, but I did halve the cake portion (to make 2 x 6" cake rounds for a small layer cake) and I made 1.5x the frosting portion (so there was enough for my layer cake). It was fantastic, and just the right size for our family!

I have made this cake a few times. I substitute the oil for banana. I also use 1 cup sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and a bit of extra cinnamon.  Last time I kept 1/8 of the oil. I baked it for just under 40 mins in a square pan. Update: for cupcakes I did the recipe for 27 servings and it made 32 mostly large cupcakes. I just used white sugar and about 2 and a half cups of sugar. I also used mostly bananas with about a TB of oil only.

I really liked this cake, as well as my family. My dad is a sucker for carrot cakes and he was ecstatic when I made it. Although, I added a cup of raisins to also cook in, and did 1/4 less cup of sugar, but that didn't really make a difference. It came out really moist, and so far has stayed pretty moist. I've been storing it in the fridge, because I used cream cheese icing on it. (Just a normal cream cheese recipe) DEFIANTLY RECOMMEND IT!

My husband requests a carrot cake for his birthday every year and I've tried a few already from this site.  This was the first time I've made this one, and it will be the one I use from now on.  Everyone raved about how good it was.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, except I made it in 3 layers and used walnuts instead of pecans.  I made it a few hours ahead of time so it would have plenty of time to chill in the refrigerator, just the way he likes it.  It was a huge hit, and was just as good (if not better) the second day!

I lost count of how many times I made this recipe without making any changes and its simply delicious. Moisty and very rich in flavor. The only way that I make a change is if I'm making it as a snack for my kid that I reduce the amount of sugar to 1 C, but that change is just because I want to reduce the amount of sugars that my kid eat. People keep asking me to make this recipe all the time.

I used 3 1/2 cups of carrots, and I used 1 cup of white sugar and 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I also omitted the pecans in the frosting, and only used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar. I baked it in a 9'' round pan, then cut it in half and made a layered cake. There wasn't quite enough frosting  to do a crumb coat and a second coat of frosting, but I didn't make more because the frosting was still quite sweet, and I wanted the delicious cake to shine through. The result? moist, delicious, nutty carrot cake.

I made this cake given the amount of ratings and reviews it received. It was so dense and unlike any carrot cake I've ever tasted before- and never want to taste again. We all spit it out. This recipe needs some fine tuning. Highly discourage it.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious.  Because I made it in a 9X13 I had lots of frosting leftover but would have used it all on a 2 layer cake.  Thank you, Tammy, for this great recipe.

Delicious. We make mini "cupcakes" with this recipe, baked for 20 minutes at 315 degrees and they come out spectacular. I always put less sugar in the frosting but probably because I'm catering to kids... but I also don't think it needs quite that much. So good!

Amazing on its own. I only tweek to fit my personal palate. Added raisins, switched half the white sugar with brown sugar, and my four-year-old added eggshells which tastes great! It's the memories that matter.

It's really good but then it better be because it calls for pecans. I was lucky that I had some left over from Christmas. I ran out of icing sugar so I was a little short, so I didn't use as much cream cheese as directed. So, the icing wasn't as thick as it should have been and it wasn't as sweet either. But, all in all, it's a very tasty cake, so the mistakes were barely noticeable.

I would definitely make this carrot cake again, and make sure I have everything for it before I make it.

It's so tasty (I had a taste test) that I want to have my desert for dinner.
PS: I didn't change the recipe on purpose. I ran out of icing sugar. But, with all of the ingredients, it will be amazing.

The cake part was ok the first time I made it, hence the 3 star review. Nothing too speacial. I then replaced 1 cup of sugar with dark brown sugar, added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla and it was much better. I'm really not a fan of the frosting though

I made this a day before my wife and kids flew out for a family emergency, which meant I got to eat it every day with every meal until it was gone. It was so good I almost made another just to keep up my solo tradition.

I made this cake for my parents 50th wedding anniversary recently and it was DELICIOUS!  I made it EXACTLY as the directions say making NO additions to the recipe.  It has an excellent taste and was super moist.  I had so many compliments on how great it tasted.  I am adding it to my recipes for sure.

I've made this many times and it's always a hit.
There are two substitutions I make:
First, I use a 2-1 ratio of applesauce to oil as I felt that all oil tasted too "greasy".
Second, instead of 2 tsp cinnamon, I use 1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice.

I used self rising flour since it was all I had and cut out the baking soda and salt. It took me an hour to mix the ingredients when I count the time it took me to grate the carrots. Taste is great! I was disappointed that the image associated with this cake did not match the recipe.

I went through reviews, to get a better idea of what to and not to do. I ended up adding 1 cup of apple sauce and instead of the normal amount of oil i used 1/2 a cup of oil, (not including the pineapple people recommended) and then added the 1 cup of brown sugar with 1 cup of regular sugar. I also added in extra teaspoons of vanilla and cinnamon. Then to really jazz it up i shredded the carrots then steamed them to slightly soften (still some crunch) with some brown sugar and cinnamon incorporated in the water. Smelt amazing and made the perfect texture (nobody likes to crunchy of a carrot) I strained most of the water out but left a little bit of the cinnamon sugar water with the carrots to mix into the cake. I also separated the eggs and whipped the egg whites. Folded them into the batter last. The cake turned out delicious with a classic flavor! Paired perfectly with my cream cheese frosting and was easy to frost with, not to crumby very moist! tasted good refrigerated the next day to. I made it for a family gathering and it disappeared. I recommend my alterations to make the perfect cake. Thanks the only thing that could be a preference issue to people is that the cake is on the dense side more.

This cake turned out beautifully! My husband requested a carrot cake for his birthday (today) so I made the cake last night and the frosting today. I made the recipe as is but didn't have the proper pan size so I used a 9 inch square pan and had enough for eight cupcakes. My husband and 20 month old daughter blew out the candles together and shared a nice piece (her first time eating cake!). My husband said to save this recipe and not to change a thing!!!

Made it as directed except used walnuts instead of pecans and it only needed 35 mins @ 350. Husband said it was the "best carrot cake" he has ever had! Super moist and frosting was not overly sweet.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

I've been baking for 35 years.  This is hands down the BEST carrot cake recipe I've ever used.  I followed it to a T, it needs NO modification. The recipe and instructions are very simple and it works!   Also in the past I've struggled with getting the right texture on cream cheese frosting.  This recipe is simple and straight forward and is absolutely the best I've ever used.  Frosting was velvety

Excellent! Nice, moist cake, and great taste. Added a dash of ground ginger along with the cinnamon. My husband raved about this cake, after rolling his eyes when I told him I was baking a cake with veggies in it.

This cake is AMAZING! I did not change anything, did not add the pecans. Can't wait to make it again! My picture is the one that my daughter decorated saying Happy Birthday Grammy :)

I made this for my husband's birthday - he said it was awesome!  I have to agree!  I made half the recipe and used apple sauce for half the oil.  I also only put 3/4 tsp of baking soda and powder to avoid the weird taste I've had in previous tries.  Everything else was done according to the original recipe.  The cake was dense, moist and delicious!

I give it a 4, because I made the changes user "gneebeanie" made! The cake came out really great! I've never made carrot cake before, I'll be making it again though. For carrots I bought pre shredded ones from the grocery store, than chopped them up in a food processor! The frosting was great! I also didn't put pecans in the mix, cause I think the focus should be on the carrots more. Though I bought some pre-bagged glazed pecans, which I chopped up in the processor and sprinkled around the edge of the cake! DELICIOUS!

Everyone says it's the best ever!  It's pretty nutty- maybe because I chop them coarsely. I like the texture that gives.  It gets a scrumptious crispness/caramelization on the edges.  I will leave nuts out of the frosting if I'm doing cupcakes., as it looks prettier!  For cupcakes I cook about 20-25 minutes.  I've made this recipe probably 20 times as is- twice for friend's weddings.  My husband gets it every year on his birthday- it's a requirement!

I used pecans instead of walnuts and it turned out great. I also didnt add nuts to the frosting and I am happy with the results. This was delicious! I have made it twice. Make sure to pack down the carrots.

This cake is super sticky, so if you want to pop it out of a pan, I recommend lining the pan with wax paper. Pam does not cut it. It is not too sweet, which pairs well with the supersweet frosting. I grated the carrots on the same side I use for cheese and it worked well. My cakes did fall despite properly measuring and not overmixing. That is not a big deal if you make the 9x13 as described in the instructions.  Next time I may switch out some of the oil as I felt that caused the sticky edges. The cake tastes great. Seems more like a loaf cake recipe though.

I baked it in 4 8-inch pans and it spilled all over the edges but that's ok. The cake itself is moist with a crunchy carmelized edge. This is not going to last long!

Made it just like the recipe. It's delicious. For my taste it's too much frosting. I didn't have a pan that big so i used a smaller one, but it grows a lot and it spilled out. Beside the mess it was delicious! The little burned up pieces that fall out were delicious and crunchy! 
Half the frosting in the recipe is enough. Next time i think i'll do half the recipe so it's smaller and crunchier! But make no mistakes... it's a moist cake and that part is delicious too.

I'm not sure how issues are coming up about making this recipe. It is super easy and very good. I kept the recipe as is, only omitting the pecans since I just don't like them.  Try making the recipe as written and then you have a good starting point for next time if you want to change something. I'm not going to make a list of changes since that would be rating myself. For this recipe…as is…very good and moist.

I added chopped walnuts instead of pecans, because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise the cake was made as written. I grated my carrots with a cheese grater, and mixed it all by hand (no electric mixer). A couple of family members who thought they did not like carrot cake loved this one, so it's a keeper in my book.

Turned out really good, but really sweet. 
It is probably the same level of sweetness that you would get at a western restaurant, but if that's too much for you (like it is for me), cut down on the sugar level a bit. 
This is after I made the following changes:
1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar instead of 2 cups white sugar for cake. 
2 cups icing sugar instead of 4 cups icing sugar for the frosting.

I used  gneebeanie's changes, for the most part, and the cake turned out phenomenal.
For the frosting, I only used 2 C of sugar. 4 C just seems ridiculous. Mine was tangy and slightly sweet- perfect.

Recipe was awesome. Cake was moist and tasty. However it was a bit too sweet for my liking. Will reduce the sugar next time. 
The cream cheese frosting was also too sweet will certainly reduce the sugar for that.

I followed the original recipe, and the cake turned out great. I chose this recipe at the first place because it's simple and did not require apple juice nor pineapples. Cut my ingredients half for 4-6 servings. I used a 5x9 inches pan for baking.

I left out the nuts (crunchy cake isn't my thing) and my wife said it was the best dessert I'd ever made her. There were many moaning noises coming from her end of the table. Let's just say - big win! :)

I liked the flavor of the cake, but mine fell in the center a bit. I will keep looking for another recipe.

This cake was a total hit!  As is, it works wonderfully, but I made it with a few additional changes and everyone said it was the best cake they have ever had.  Biggest changes: a buttermilk glaze and an almond buttercream frosting,  this cake was like no carrot cake I've had before!  Divine!
Details:
(1) - Reduced oil to 3/4 cup and added 1 cup of drained crushed pineapple
(2) - I did two round cakes, and out of the oven drizzled with the following buttermilk glaze and then let cool completely 
*1 cup sugar
*1/2 cup buttermilk
*1 1/2 tsp baking soda
*1/2 cup butter
*1 tb corn syrup
*splash vanilla extract

*****Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir for 4 minutes or until the syrup is light golden.
 
(3) I had a specific request for buttermilk frosting (NO cream cheese) so I tripled the "Quick and Almost-Professional" recipe from Allrecipes with a splash of almond extract and used it for the layered cake.  I was liberal with the frosting, chilled it overnight and it was seriously amazing.

Too heavy and tastes like baking soda. I think it could be good with a little more flour (1/4 to 1/2 C more ) and be sure not to pack the carrots at all when you measure. Frosting tasted good and was easy.

This recipe is great! I made it exactly as the recipe calls for., except I used rapeseed oil since I live in Finland, and we don't have "vegetable oil"here. Everyone who tried the cake, loved it.  The cake itself was very moist. The frosting was very good. The only thing I noticed was that I had WAY too much frosting. There was about a cup left after I was done covering the entire cake in a think layer. The only reason to have that much would be if you are  making 2 layers and need some in between. I just cooked mine in a rectangular pan (9x13in).

I also want to mention that the pecans were great. I really enjoyed the flavor of them in the cake.

My family loved this cake. For all the people who left negative feedback all I can say is "Food Scale". Imho baking never turns out well unless you weight your ingredients. (Plus I'm too lazy to sift flour.) I did use two nine inch rounds instead of a 9x11 pan. Also I've found when baking veggie cakes and cookies it really helps to line the pan with parchment paper so they release properly.

Wonderful carrot cake! I doubled the recipe in a 1/2 sheet pan because I was making it for husband's birthday party. I added a regular size can of crushed pineapple, and folded in a cup of baking raisins. I left the nuts out but I took about a cup of walnuts and processed them into a cornmeal texture and sprinkled them on top of the cake.

I have never had such a hard time with a cake cooking. The center fell and it took about an additional hour covered in foil to get it to cook. Once cooked, the carrot cake was very dense but tasted fine. I think there may be way too much oil. (I can't rate the icing, I screwed it up)

I am giving 4 stars because the icing is a bit too sweet. The cake is scrumptious and don't get me wrong the icing is good but next time I am going to reduce the amount of powdered sugar used and then just do a taste test as I go until it's just right!

I've made this, up in the mountains while camping. Followed the recipe to the letter, except for the cooking method. I poured out into a cake a square pan and placed it in a large 14" lodge camp dutch oven. Worked beautifully and tasted great!

This was delicious.  I didn't change anything on purpose, but I did use margarine instead of butter because I didn't realize I was out of butter.  Turned out just fine.  

It was my first time baking carrot cake, the consistency was different than I expected and it didn't rise as much as I thought it would.  I baked this in 2 8-inch cake pans plus still had some for a small loaf pan, I possibly could have pulled off filling the 8-inch cake pans more, but I'm still not sure I could have fit all of the batter in them without them overflowing.  

I also ran low on nuts toward the end.  I didn't have a full cup of nuts for the icing (but did have a full cup in the cake mix) so instead of mixing the nuts into the icing, I just sprinkled them on top, I think I liked that better than if I mixed them in anyway.   I probably won't use a full cup of nuts with the icing in the future either, I think it might be too many nuts then.

Love this recipe, but based on other reviews I do make the following additions  to a full recipe (I would just make a note of these not in a review--for future reference--but the notes function seems to have gone with the old look of Allrecipes):  Made half of the sugar brown sugar, added 8 oz can of drained crushed pineapple, 1/4 tsp nutmeg and an extra tsp of cinnamon.  

This time I made a half recipe for two 6" layers (had some leftovers for a few cupcakes--probably 1/3 recipe would be perfect).  Bake time was then reduced to about 20 min.  I paired this with a full recipe of the frosting (I like my frosting), but would probably reduce that next time to about 2/3 or perhaps 3/4 of the original recipe.

I made no changes besides taking out all nuts(allergies and dislikes in the family towards nuts) and it came out perfect. I didn't make the frosting because i had my own recipe, but if that was anything like the cake it'd be a 5/5 too

This is an excellent carrot cake. Moist not to heavy, center did not fall, not to much baking soda flavor as some stated. I love carrot cake and this is the first one I made from scratch and feel like it was just what I was expecting it to be. Will definitely make again!

I needed to make a gluten free, egg free dessert so I altered this recipe.  I used 2 cups of rice flour in place of the all purpose flour, 1 cup of unsweetened applesauce in place if the 4 eggs and added 1/2 tsp of baking powder to make a total of 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder.  It was great!  no one could believe that it was gf and egg free, everyone loved it. I had made the regular recipe in the past and it was a hit as well. The only thing I would change is the amount of sugar in the icing.  It was a bit too sweet. If it wasn't for the sweet icing I would have given it 5 stars.

Excellent cake! If you like cake with a pleasant, not overwhelmingly sweet flavor, this is for you. 

Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great. I finely shredded the carrots and cooked in two round cake pans @ 350 for 30min.
The cream cheese frosting was a tad thick and hard to spread, but that may have been my fault for not letting it soften quite enough. ;)

My husband, who hated carrot cake after a terrible carrot cake disappointment as a child, quite enjoyed it. ;)

Much respect to this recipe but made some changes with the help of other reviews plus dairy intolerance of cheese. Only 2 c of squeezed out carrots (grating size small was ok) with cheese cloth prior marinating with brown sugar. May be able to add only 1 -1.5 c of sugar cause it's sweet. Hydrated 1/2 c raisins with warm rum and pineapple juices. Baked 51 mins. It was heavy with the ingredients, was afraid the cake was going to cake in while cooling but it held up enough. With my dairy intolerance I settled for Swiss meringue with 1t agave syrup,1t vanilla bean paste, 3-5t orange juice- it took it to a orangey cream flavor!

Turned out very well. Only used a cup of canola oil instead of the 5/4ths vegetable oil. Still turned out very well.

I've never made a carrot cake before (although I've eaten many!) and this is a fantastic recipe. Disclaimer: I used gneebeanie's helpful suggestions and they were spot on.  Instead of frosting the cake with the heavy, sweet cream cheese icing that's typically used on carrot cakes, I used Tom's Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting found on this site...much lighter texture and went very well with the cake. Tammy, thank you so much for sharing this amazing recipe!

I will make this carrot cake again, using olive oil, 1.5 cups of brown sugar (it's darker than white sugar cake), and walnuts.  My husband and I just had a warm piece with frosting, and it was good!  It may be better after being refrigerated so the flavors have a chance to meld, too.  I prefer olive oil, since it is not as greasy as bad-for-us canola or corn oils.

Best carrot cake recipe I have found! I made a few small changes. I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. I added an extra tsp of vanilla extract, an extra tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, and an 8oz can of crushed pineapple with most of the juice squeezed out.

We made it without the nuts (used our own frosting) and had to add 1 more egg and a quarter cup milk as it was too dry. Turned out delicious.  Almost like a spice cake meets carrot cake

I made this Gluten free & almost dairy free and it was great! It did cave in a little in the middle. I baked it at 350 for 30 minutes in 2 round cake pans. I had trouble getting it out of the pan though I had greased & floured. after it cooled completly I had to hit the pans pretty hard against the counter with the cooling rack on the other side. I used Bobs Red Mill GF Flour that had xatham gum in it. I also used a dairy free cream cheese in a tub for the frosting. I used the large grater holes for the carrots.

As written it's about 3.5 stars. Not too bad just bland. I made it a second time with minor modifications and it was amazing. Add an extra tsp of cinnamon, a half tsp of nutmeg, and sub applesauce for half the oil. Leaves you with a very moist even cake. Thank you for posting.

I've experimented with carrot cake only twice. It came out great both times. I've decided that this cake is delicious no matter how it is made. It can be altered here and there based on your taste, really; but it still tastes great. One thing I've learned is that this cake tastes better the next day, and even better the third day. I personally add nutmeg and cardamom along with the cinnamon.  It is a cake I think almost anyone would like.

I followed the recipe as written with 3 minor changes which did not affect the true recipe.  The first change was that I did not have enough ground cinnamon so I ended up doing about 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon & 1-1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  The second change was that I used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand.  The third change was that I used two round cake pans instead of the 9 x 13 as I wanted to make a 4-layer cake.  Everything else, though, I followed exactly (including the frosting).  The cake turned out beautifully!  NOTE:  I used the large grate (like grating cheese) for the carrots and I really pushed them down/compacted them into the measuring vessels.  I wanted to get in as many carrots as I could.  No straining necessary.  
I will post pictures of how it turned out.  It was a delicious!

This carrot cake recipe is the best! I've made it for church functions and other special occasions.  It always gets requested to be made again. It also tastes delicious without the pecans if anyone doesn't like them. One thing that I like most (besides the awesome taste) is that it can be made from things that most people usually have in their kitchen. No special trip to get this dessert done. I'm from the south and I like this recipe without any alterations.

Too many pecans! Too much sugar! I used half brown. Pineapple or raisins would improve this. 
Did not need all of icing, a little more than half was used.

This is now in my recipe card box. My kids loved it and so did my work.

I did not make any changes to the cake portion (I left out the optional nuts) though I did make a change to the icing. I used 2 - 2 1/2 cups icing sugar to balance the cream cheese and sweetness. But this was personal preference. If you like sweet icing, I'm sure it's perfect as listed!

This recipe is OK as is. It tasted a little eggy and not very spicy. I'm also not thrilled with the amount of oil called for. I'm going to look for another recipe that is darker, denser and spicier.

I've made this several times and it always gets rave reviews. I do use 3/4 C applesauce and 1/4C oil. (I just cant wrap my head around that much oil) I have some people in my life who don't like nuts, it comes out great that way as well. I personally think it taste better the next day.

The cake is too dry. Other recipes call for pineapple, coconut and more liquid. I would opt for one of them.

I made this recipe exactly as written. To say I had high expectations due to the numerous 5 star reviews is an understatement. However, I was very disappointed. The cake made exactly as written... Is very bland. It lacks flavor and depth. I will try other recipes from this site but it is hard to go by the reviews when everyone rates a recipe based on the changes they made.

I followed the recipe without any any change, the texture looked normal but after 50 minutes in oven the center of the cake was still row
It tastes fine at the edges , maybe i will give it another chance.

Great cake but not frosting. The frosting had way to much powdered sugar, it was over powing. I would definatly make this cake again, but use another recipe for frosting.

I have made this countless times, and each time, someone asks for the recipe. It is THAT good. One change I did make: only 1 cup of powdered sugar instead of 4 for the icing.

I have made this cake 4 times, exactly as directed. It is very good and everyone loves it. I have had no problems with it being too greasy, or falling as others have. Sometimes it sticks to the pan, but just use parchment paper. It is moist, without too much competing flavour or additions. I specifically chose this recipe because it is a true carrot cake, not pineapple, not raisin etc.  Very good cake, with perfect flavour.  The icing is sweet, but I make it in 2 X9inch pans and layer it and it is perfect. I do not add the chopped pecans in the icing, but decorate with pecan halves instead.  Next time I will try it with applesauce to reduce some oil, but it doesn't need it.

This recipe is always a great success. We even substitute sweet potato for the carrots sometimes...also delicious.

Loved this recipe. Though it had  too much sugar and oil for my liking . I stuck to the recipe just reduced sugar - both in the icing and the cake. I used half cup less than what the recipe asks for and it came out great. Also I don't like pecans so used walnuts instead and they worked well.

I made it once and followed the revisions. I used less sugar and apple sauce. It turned out horrible. Tasted fully like salt. This time I only changed a few things .I used sunflower oil. Ran out and only had 3/4 cup if oil, so added 2 heaping tbsp of butter. Added extra tsp of vanilla(love vanilla!) Extra tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tspnutmeg and 1/2 cloves I love it spicy too. So this time I tasted my batter and could still detect a hint of salt. Added 2 heaping tbps of honey at the end. No pecans don't like them. Made muffins they cooked in 17 minutes dark brown the result was very moist but extremely fluffy. Fluffy rich goodness. Omg.  Cream cheese icing with melted white choclate to follow. Merry Christmas

Prefer bread-like vegetable goods (think loaf over cake- loaves are usually richer). Substituted equal parts ground cloves and allspice for cinnamon. Used Bob's Red Mill 100% Stone Ground Whole Wheat Flour. Used 0.75 tsp salt (Himalayan rock salt, unbleached, kosher, uniodized, because I did not want anti-caking agents in the dough). Halved white sugar content, compensated with 0.5 cp Dark Muscovado sugar. Excluded nuts. Mixed baking soda and powder as instructed. Quickly added 2 tsp Cream of Tartar right  before baking. Mixed by folding batter. Resulted in darker brown cake with evenly distributed carrots and sweet slightly sticky top  in loaf, cake, muffin, and mini-muffin forms. Omitted butter from frosting and substituted with 2 tbs 2% milk.

I made this for me fiancés birthday and received so many compliments! Everyone told me it was the best carrot cake they've ever had by a long shot. I made a few modifications based on reviews: 1) 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar 2) an extra teaspoon vanilla 3) one can crushed pineapple 4) 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 5) 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 5) 1/2 cup coconut. 
It made two 9" rounds and 4 small heart shaped pans. I will never buy another carrot cake again!

I've just made this today. I had reduced the recipe to serve 5. I didn't want to make a whole cake as it was only for me and the Husband. Flavour wise was wonderful, I had added other spices on my own to my liking and substituted apple sauce for oil as I didn't have any flavourless oil on hand. The cake baked perfectly, rose well in the middle and cake tester came out clean. However, the cake began to sink as it cooled. When I cut into it, it was kinda gummy in the middle.

I'm still going to have it for breakfast tomorrow though. Not going to waste food. But any ideas why it sank while cooling? I love the flavour of the cake and how easy it was to make. Would make it again if I know what to look out for to avoid another sinking cake. 

Thank for the recipe!

I made this without changing a single thing about the recipes.  I'm not even a fan of carrot cake, made it because my boyfriend is a big fan.  It was so good I almost didn't want to share.  I love this recipes, thanks for sharing!

Will definitely make this again! Delicious and easy! I did one thing different: 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. Brown sugar is necessary in good carrot cake which is why I added it regardless of the reviews. I think extra cinnamon and added nutmeg is a matter of personal taste but I didn't  add any extra cinnamon or nutmeg my first time around. Absolutely wonderful carrot cake. I HIGHLY recommend making this 1 or 2 days prior to serving because I swear this cake gets better as it sits (in the fridge).  I also trimmed the edges of the cake rounds because they were more stiff than the rest of the cake. I iced just the tops of the cakes and let the icing drip down...very pretty.

Sub half oil with applesause, add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, increase vanilla to 3 tsp.  use 1 c. white sugar, 1 c. brown sugar.  add drained 8 oz. crushed pineapple.  If making cupcakes bake 350 for 28 minutes.  This review is really more for my own notes, not trying to take anything from the submitter's orignal recipe.

I've tried many recipes and this one is the easiest and best so far.  I added a pinch of salt to the frosting and to the batter as well to offset the sweetness a bit. I didn't have brown sugar this time so I used the white but next time I will use 1/2 brown sugar.

All of my family loved this cake.  I found that 4 cups of sugar for the frosting would have made it too sweet so I only added 2 cups and it was good.

This is the cake my dad requests every year for his birthday.  You can safely decrease the oil by 1/4 cup without changing the texture. It's also important to hand mix this cake. My dad likes added sweetened coconut and raisins.

I turned this into a bundt cake 50 min bake time.  I'm Southern so bI added an extra tsp of everything & 1tsp nutmeg.  I reserved 1\4  of the chopped pecans because the cream cheese frosting wanted them on top.  I haven't had good luck with bundt's I usually thgem them cool & try to get them out..fail so, I looked up a tip that said to invert it right out of the oven so I did that on a cookie sheet & as the tip suggested I wrapped a clean hot damp towel all over the bundt as it's upside down waited the suggested 10 minutes and there it was as flawless as it gets :). I always make those closest in my life a home made from scratch no good acceptable cake for their Birthdays & I made this for my Daughter In Law & it's now my favorite :) Great recipe for Carrot Cake especially for people who don't like raisins.

Delicious! I cut back on the sugar a little bit (1.5 cups instead of 2) and made as muffins. Haven't made the cream cheese frosting yet but these muffins are disappearing fast! Hubby ate 3 at lunch and my brother stopped by and ate 2. My 3 year old loves them too!

Very good recipe.  I chose this recipe because it had a large amount of carrots in it. I prefer carrot cake to be very moist And heavy almost like a bar.  This recipe met my expectations for the perfect carrot cake.

I made this cake since I liked the proportions of the recipe. I did change the flour for whole wheat white flour and reduced the sugar to 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar, but I always reduce the sugar in most recipes.  
Made it in a smaller round 6 inch cake pan and made 6 muffin size cakes with the rest of the batter (adding 1/2 cup of raisins and 1/2 cup shredded coconut just to the muffins). This allowed me to make/cut  the cake into 4 layers with three icing interlayers and cover it too,(followed a Zoe bakes video on icing on Youtube),  sprinkling with the chopped pecans.
I cut it the day after and it was delicious, gets really good the second day since the icing fats kind of migrate into the cake layers.
I could probably reduce the sugar even more to just 1 cup when icing , since the icing will compensate for the sweetness. Altough I had never iced before and I will do it only as a treat for special occasions. (Just because of the caloric intake, is hard not to keep eating it!) 

I allready copied the recipe to make it again in the future with or without icing!

This recipe is just great!! Everybody in my family loves it! We're even doing it for my father's birthday as to him, this is the yummiest cake ever. On a side note, adding 1 cup of raisin to the ingredients would make this recipe simply perfect :)

4* As is, really loved it, can't go wrong.  Made it with all the additions as suggested, but that was overly spiced in my opinion.  I liked best with suggested 4 cup carrots, 3t cinnamon, 1t nutmeg and only 1/4 t allspice and put all 2c pecans in the mix, none if frosting, I like smooth frosting. Best if made and cooled overnight, but I cooled my frosting overnight and it was hard to spread.  So this time I frosted it in morning and served in evening.  Perfect. Feel no need to try the brown sugar substitution at this time.

Excellent.  My husband has been jonesin' for his favorite cake so I settled on this one.  We loved it.  I made it exactly as written except I didn't put the pecans in the frosting, just the cake.  Also, I left it in the 13 x 9 pan instead of turning it out as I would have nowhere to store it that way.  A keeper for sure!

I made this recipe with the modifications listed in other reviews. 3/4 cup oil , 1/2 c applesauce, 3 tbsp cinnamon, I c white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg 1/2 tsp allspice and 3/4 c chopped walnuts cause that's all I had. It turned out great, moist. Next time I will decrease the sugar, 2 c is to sweet in any recipe if you ask me. I would probably add more spices. But overall, with the icing tasted like any carrot cake you buy from the store. Will defiantly make this again.

Excellent recipe, I have made this now twice and the look on my grandmothers face (the baker of the family) was just wonderful. She was just raving about it :) I used whole wheat flour and omitted the pecans and it was still fantastic!

This cake tasted good, but there's too much baking powder in it, which causes it too rise too fast and then collapse.  The baking powder also creates a coarser crumb than most cake, and it can leave a bitter taste. Next time I'll leave the powder out completely and just add 1 t. baking soda. The frosting also had a "fatty" taste that coated my mouth, so I added about a teaspoon of lemon juice. That really brightened up the taste of the frosting. I would probably do the same next time but also use low-fat cream cheese.

I have never made a Carrot cake but I was asked to make it for a birthday. First thing I saw was that it was asking for only white sugar & I've had too many cakes issues with just using white sugar, so I used 1 cup white & 1 cup brown. I did add an extra teaspoon of vanilla & cinnamon & 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg for the cake. 


My only issue is the frosting. It tastes great but I can't seem to get the consistency right. It's a bit too liquidity but I put it in the freezer to see if that helps.

I didn't add nuts, and it was still perfect. I also added a little extra butter, tasted even better, and more powdered sugar, for thickness, to the frosting. It was an amazing cake, and it was honestly as good, if not better, than a carrot cake from a great restaurant. This was one of the best carrot cakes I've ever had, and my whole family loved it. They make me make it all the time! I completely recommend making it.

I gave this recipe 4 stars instead of 5 as it is a good recipe, but simply tweaks could be made to improve it. For instance, the taste of cinnamon was too light, so I used 1 tbsp instead of 2 tsp. White sugar generally works fine, but to give the cake a richer flavour, I used 1-3/4 cup white sugar + 1 tbsp molasses (you could also sub 1 cup of white sugar with brown but I didn't have any brown sugar on hand). For those who prefer a less oily cake, the oil can be reduced to 1 cup without compromising on the moistness - my cake was still incredibly moist. In fact, it was still so moist that I had to let it cool in the pan or it would crumble  if I wasn't careful in removing it. I made my own cream cheese frosting as the frosting recipe here looked insanely sweet! I used 1/2 cup butter, 1 block cream cheese, 2/3 cup confectioner's sugar and 1 tsp vanilla essence - it was wonderful! Frosting aside, it is not an amazing carrot cake, but with some tweaking to suit your individual tastes, it can easily be.

So delicious! However, as some people suggested, I only used 1.5 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting and another teaspoon of vanilla. I also put twice the amount of cinnamon,a bit of nutmeg, substitute pecans for walnuts, 1/4 cup of sour cream (moisture and density) and added a cup of raisins! I made the cake yesterday, and it's almost completely gobbled up. My boyfriend hates cake, but he actually loved this one!

I followed the recipe almost exactly as described (Used walnuts rather then pecans), I haven't made the frosting yet, the cake has a good flavor but a strange after taste, I think it might be the baking powder. When I make carrot cake again I am definitely going to find a recipe that doesn't use baking powder, or just omit it all together, because that after taste is just too strange for me. Hopefully the taste of the frosting masks it.  I used 2 round 9" pans and it flowed over, and got all over the oven, It also sank in the middle, I think it was too dense, I might cut back on the oil next time. Also do not attempt to take the cake out of the pan after only 10 min it will crumble, wait 20-30 min.  :/

Why are people complaining about changing the recipe. When you cook or bake it should be fun and guilt-free. Not worrying about this ingredient or that ingredient. We make and use what works for us. We all don't like the same thing. Stop being Debbie Downers and Negative Nancies. Just enjoy the  cake smh.

It was good but a little plain.  I did use 3/4 C oil and 1/2 C applesauce.  Next time I'll add in more cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.

Thank you TracyH!!! I totally agree. I want to know how the recipe rates exactly as written. Not with all of these stupid comments and changes people love to brag about as if they know what other people would like. They end up changing almost the entire recipe to where it is a completely different dish. People, if you are so inclined to make all of these changes, put your own recipe out there for us to rate. Otherwise keep your changes to yourselves. Stop messing with other peoples ideas. This cake was outstanding exactly as the recipe was written.

I made this as written as I agree with others that far too many changes are made on the existing recipe leaving me puzzled on how to make a recipe that has gone through so many changes. This is a good cake as written.  The center did collapse which would keep me from making this for company and lowered my rating as I noted this happened to others.  It was moist and had a good flavor.  Now if I WAS going to change anything I would add a little more spice but that's just my preference.

I changed nothing and it was fabulous! So moist! I baked it in a 10" springform pan for  50 minutes.
Oh...I did add a generous cup of golden raisins since that's what we're accustomed having in a carrot cake, but as for the other ingredients, don't mess with perfection! :)

Made this for the first time this evening. I'm glad I tried it before I frosted it. It was not that good. It needs some tweaking for sure. Will not use this recipe again, but will adapt it or go with a completely different recipe.

I added all the oil EXCEPT for about 1-2 tablespoons and cut the sugar back to about 1 1/2  cups.  Delicious!  Not overly sweet, but sweet enough to eat without the added cream cheese frosting.  LOVED it!

WAY too much sugar in original recipe.  I cut the frosting to 2 cups of sugar and the cake to 1.5 cups of brown sugar, and that's plenty of sweet for most people.  Also, added more vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg like previous reviews suggested.

I made this as a birthday layer cake.  It was perfect and everyone loved it.   I did you 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white but left everything else the same.  I doubled the frosting recipe so I could have enough for the layer and for decorating and used 6 cups (instead of 8) of the confection sugar and it was plenty sweet.

I decided to try this recipe because it didn't require pineapple. I divided this in half, and made them into cupcakes, very tasty and moist. No need to change anything.

This recipe had way too much oil. You could see the oil that had drained out when you lifted a piece of cake from the serving plate. However, I thought the taste was good. I would add more carrot and flour. Or decrease amount of oil instead of adding flour. Will try making it again with these changes! Friends liked it, especially the frosting.

This recipe made as is = 4*s
It's a perfect base for opportunity depending on your tastes and preferences. With minor adjustments, this cake can be as versatile as you need it to be. Anyone can make this their own 5* cake. I do, every year.
Thank you, Tammy Elliott, for sharing this recipe. You are the reason so many of us are enjoying our own perfect version of this delicious cake.

Absolutely perfect! I hate when folks change up a recipe after saying 'it was perfect!'.  I followed this one and everyone loved it!  The only thing was that I accidently preheated my convection oven to 375 instead of 350 :) but I am at high altitude so don't know if that made a difference! Either way, cake was wonderful.  Icing = perfect.  Winner winner in my book!

I made  a small cake with half the recipe and it was gone in a couple days. I did make a few substitutions: whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose, half evaporated cane juice and half brown sugar as the sugar.  Next time I might use walnuts instead of pecans but the pecans were well liked anyway! I topped it with brown sugar cream cheese frosting also from allrecipes.

This is a great Carrot cake! Only thing I did different was I made more (1 1/2 times everything) so I could make 3 layers. I used 1/2white sugar 1/2 brown sugar, golden raisins and walnuts. It came out great! 
I also made this yummy frosting. Not too sweet. I also crush the walnuts for the outside of the cake. It looked very pretty and was very moist. I have made this recipe3 or 4 times now and have't changed much besides the sugar. . Everyone tells me it's the best Carrot cake ever. Keeper recipe.

Best carrot cake ever!  I have always been able to take or leave carrot cake - but this one leaves me craving it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner - so be warned - it's addictive!  Husband who is usually a man of few words -ha- raved about it as did co-workers who got a piece.  Delicious!

This cakes was amazing. It baked up really nicely and tasted amazing.. I did substitute 1 cup of applesauce  in place of the oil for extra moistness (which worked!!) and I added raisins.. Will be using this again

Just what I have been searching for!  I used to be known for my yummy scratch carrot cake.  After a move and retyping my beat up recipe cards, I knew something was missing.  Now I see what I've been missing!!  Thanks.  This cake gave me a very nice crisp edge, which makes dividing into 4 layers and over icing only the centers, perfect.  When I try this recipe again, i will try the suggested substitution of part of the white for brown sugar.  HINT - in case you have a husband who cannot tolerate nuts - I chopped the pecans, dropped the mix into half of the pans, then added pecans to the second half of the batter and dropped that into the other side.  It baked perfectly and I stacked the layers matching up the nut side. A bit tricky, but my husbands diverticulitis thanks me!!

This is one of the best carrot cakes I've ever tasted. My family loves it and I bake it for most family get-togethers. There are several reviews that suggest substitutions for oil and other content. However, this is a traditional carrot cake with a recipe similar to those found in some of the best restaurants.

I followed this recipe exactly as it is stated- YUM! It was for a birthday and it turned out just lovely. I like to make birthday cakes from scratch to add to the occasion. I did not use a 9x13 pan though. I used 2 9" round pans & I think I should have made 3 pans, as it almost baked over! I used the icing and made a layer between the two cakes as well as all over the entire stack. I used fresh carrots from a local farmers market. If you like carrot cake- this one is wonderful.

This carrot cake was perfectly moist and tasted wonderful. I did add some adjustments like adding 1/4 tsp nutmeg and an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract and cinnamon. I used the pecans and I think it made it better! Definitely would make this again.

My sister had told me about this recipe, where she just used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar, I went exactly by the recipe and made if for my husband for his birthday just yesterday.  I put pecans in the cake and decorated the cake with them because we love pecans.  It was so moist!!  I will be making this cake again.

This was awesome. I sprinkled my nuts over the icing instead off mixing it in. Not a big difference in taste from original recipe just a little more décor to the eye. Adding pineapples would also benefit to the texture adding a little something to chew on.

I have made this recipe loads and its a hit! I add cranberries to walnuts instead of pecans. its moist , no sink holes, and absoloutly the way a carrot cake should taste. I recomend buying measuring spoons in order to get it right...a set cost $1 at any dollar shop...

I made a half batch and baked in an 8x8" pan.   Everyone loved it.   It is much lighter than most dense/heavy carrot cakes.

This recipe is great as is. I followed some of the suggestions & added the extra teaspoon vanilla & it was too much. I will NOT do that next time. I like a little vanilla in my carrot cake, as opposed to a little carrot cake in my vanilla.

I've been making this recipe since 2004, and it has been my husband's de facto birthday cake (he insists) every year since.  Anyone lucky enough to share the cake says it's the best they've ever had. I have never changed the ingredients for the cake, only the way I bake it: in two 8" round cake pans.  I use frosting in between the layers, and additional coarsely ground pecans on the finished outer frosting (no need to make more than the recipe calls for). I've also made cupcakes, just as successfully, without changing a thing.  Tammy Elliott, you are famous in my family even though we don't know you.  This cake will never leave us!

Was a really great recipe without pineapple but a bit too oily. Next time i will modify it to be bit less oily and maintain it's fluffiness. This cake is even better the next day after juices have settled a bit.

I've made this exactly per the recipe and it is very good!  However, for my personal preference I find we  prefer it with and extra tsp of vanilla and cinnamon.  Also made the sugar half brown/half white.  Once I started getting my ingredients together only to realize I had no fresh carrots but did have a can of carrots.  I took a chance, drained them well, slightly mashed them and dumped them into the mixer.  Since then I've done this a couple of times.  It is a bit moister but just as much flavor but do drain them well!

Have made it numerous times and it was fantastic and people constantly ask me to make it for things. I agree with the addition of nutmeg which is what I do and I up the nuts on the outer edge of the frosting and do not mix them in. It's prettier this way. I am going to try the half and half of sugars and the applesauce.

Great recipe! Everyone loved it! I had 1.5 cups of sugar in the cake and 3 cups in the frosting. Next time I will put less in the frosting, A friend's mum even asked where she can buy one! 

Thanks for the excellent recipe! I will definitely make again :)

I incorporated gneebeanie's suggestions (except the pineapple) and was absolutely thrilled with the result.  This is one of the lightest and most delicious carrot cake recipes I've ever tried.  I doubled the recipe and used half for the 9x13" cake, and the other half for muffins.

I decided to make this carrot cake for a small gathering my mother was having and everyone loved it ! I made it exactly how the recipe said but I added a cup of milk and it was pretty great. I was asked a couple of times if Im a baker (LOL) The cake was gone almost as fast as I set it on the table! Thank you for a great recipe and making me look like a good baker!

An excellent recipe. I've made it many times and only failed once (because of a defective oven, it wasn't the cake's fault). The cake is moist and dense and sweet and spicy and just what I like a carrot cake to be, and it has been rapturously received by others every time I've served it. I agree with the people who say to use half brown sugar and half white, and on one occasion I didn't have enough cinnamon and substituted mixed spice and was very pleased with the result, so that's my regular version of the recipe. The icing quantities given yield so much that it's easy to make a layer cake and ice it top, sides and middle. Roasted pumpkin seeds make a tasty decoration, too.

This recipe (as written) is missing several key ingredients that are essential to obtaining the proper taste of carrot cake. Such as brown sugar, and nutmeg or ginger. It also came out very dry for me, I believe this is due to the fact that it is missing some form of fat (such as butter, yogurt or sour cream) to lock in moisture. I suppose it does the trick if you're in a tough spot or don't have many ingredients on hand.

This was a very good cake recipe and I would definitely make it again.  I would advise not making this cream cheese frosting recipe though.  The cake is very sweet, and I didn't even attempt to make the frosting with that amount of sugar.  I ended up making a huge batch of frosting because I made the cake double layered.  My frosting had 3 packages of cream cheese, a teaspoon of vanilla, and only about 2 cups of confectioners' sugar.  This was still very sweet, but it wasn't sickly sweet when eating it with the sugary cake.  So, unless you like extremely sweet cake AND frosting, make a less sugary frosting.

Everyone was absolutely heads over heels for this recipe. the only changes i made it that i omitted the 1/4 cup of vegetable oil because i felt that the recipe didn't need as much oil, and for the frosting i placed 3 instead of 4 cups of sugar. the recipe turned out more than perfect. Next time ill do them in a cupcake form, since they're easier to bake and eat.

Great recipe and very easy to prepare. I used cake flour in place of all purpose flour and prepared it as a double layer cake in two round pans. I added about a cup of drained crushed pineapples and maybe half cup of raisins and substituted walnuts for the pecans. I multiplied the frosting recipe by 1.5 (since there is NEVER enough frosting). It came out absolutely fantastic.

I absolutely loved this recipe, although the first time I made it I found it too sweet. I now only use 1 1/2 cups of white sugar. Also I found that adding a citrus zest either to the frosting or to the actual cake mix gives it an extra kick! Now my go to recipe!

Made this recipe as written and it was very well received.  The person I made it for said it needed a little bit more cinnamon but she must have liked it because she told another lady how wonderful my cake was :)  I made it a second time with more cinnamon and added a little nutmeg and ginger and it made it more flavorful. I frosted it with a white chocolate cream cheese frosting (Yum!). I will definitely make this again.

great! at first i thought there was too much carrots when i was actually mixing it but then it turned out perfect. the cake itself is not sweet enough but topped with the frosting it's just right. one minor tweak i made was adding a bit more cinnamon to the batter because it didn't taste "carrot cakey" enough to me. overall great recipe and not very hard to make.

I was pleasantly surprised to love this cake this much on the first try. I added an extra half teaspoon each of vanilla, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg since I love spicey spice cakes. In a large rectangle pan I baked for about 45/50 min.

I love this cake so much, but I can't seem to make it without it falling in the middle. Not sure what I am doing wrong, but I will keep trying because it is that good. I have make in glass 9x12 pan and in 2 9" rounds; it fell both times. Any suggestions?

I added fresh grated ginger to the mixture and it was really nice. I didn't have pecans so I chopped up walnuts and it was so good. Next time I'll try to get pecans and try it that way, definitely with ginger too. This is a great recipe!

I made cupcakes for a wedding dessert table.(Doubled this recipe)  My first tray I baked was a total failure (filled 2/3 the way up and baked way over the top of the muffin tin) and I kinda freaked because I didn't have a back up recipe in case this one didn't work.  The next tray I just filled 1/2 way and they were fine. A little smaller then what I wanted, but by the time I added the frosting it was fine. I baked about 15-20 min testing after the 15 min mark.  Nice & moist.  I made the recipe as stated (except for the nuts).I did add 1/4 t. nutmeg to each recipe because I felt it just needed something because I left the nuts out.  All & all a good recipe - if you are making cupcakes, just maybe do a test one to see how full you need to fill them.  : )

I've made this quite a few times as a carrot cake, always using half the oil. It is a medium grade carrot cake, nothing special, but nothing bad either.  However, this recipe does not work as cupcakes.  The middle seems to always sink in, like it is too dense.  I wish I knew how to fix this, maybe less carrots when in cupcake form?

Made this as written (except sprinkled the nuts on top of the frosting instead of mixing them into the frosting). Everyone loved this. The only thing I might do differently might be to add a few more spices to the batter -- cloves, nutmeg and/or cinnamon. But this recipe is really excellent exactly as written.

This was the first cake I have ever made from scratch and let me tell you something, it tasted great! My family loved it, especially that cream cheese frosting. I added a cup of chunky pineapple as well and it was a great touch! Next time I am doing it with raisins.

This is a very easy recipe to make - my kind of baking!  My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I made some minor modifications as per gneebeanie's suggestions (except the applesauce and pineapple - I didn't have any).  I also added raisins although next time I'll try tossing them in flour so they hopefully won't sink to the bottom.  The cake had a nice, light flavour and texture.  It's one of the best carrot cakes we've had!

it may have been personal mistake, but mine overflowed and came out tasting like baking soda. so sad. other than that, it was an average recipe. i will have to try the other ones with pineapple. i like more texture in my carrot cake.

It raised beautifully. I reduced the baking soda to 1 tsp nd the baking powder to 1 ½ tsp as today's products are much more efficient than in the past. Excellent!!!

Made the recipe exactly as it is posted and was disappointed.  Should have read the comments first.  The cake was a bit bland and the frosting was sweet.  I will take the comments into consideration and try again, adding raisins, which my family really missed.

I omitted the pecans and used this recipe to make cake balls. OMG, they were amazing! The flavor was fantastic, and the cake itself (before being made into balls) was moist and delicious. Thanks!

my first carrot cake and it was a big success.  i made the recipe as is, other than omitting the pecans from the batter and using different pan sizes.  baked the batter in two 8x8 pans for approximately 40mins.  the frosting was amazing also.  cream cheese and butter... don't think you can go wrong there.  i topped the cakes with crushed pecans, making sure to sift the pecans prior to for a cleaner presentation.  i will be baking this again over the weekend, since i was only able to have a small sliver to taste and am now craving this.  the rest was polished before i could go for seconds.  i should mention that i am not a big fan of carrot cake, but this has definitely changed my mind or should i say palate.  a definite keeper for me.

Made cake for mother's day.  delicious.  For the frosting, I used 2.5 cups of conf. sugar and it was plenty sweet.  would not add more.    The frosting was also a little soft.   Used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white instead of 2 cups white.  easy to make!

I followed the recipe for the cake exactly as written.  This carrot cake was so good and moist.  I used the cream cheese II frosting recipe on allrecipes.  I used a 9x13 pan, and the middle of my cake did fall, but that's okay because I just filled in more frosting to even it out. :) I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe turned out great for me after reading reviews and making a few suggested changes. I used half brown half white sugar, added crushed pineapple, raisins, nutmeg, and pumpkin pie spice in addition to the extra cinnamon, and I substituted apple sauce for half of the oil that the recipe called for. The cake came out moist, delicious, and perfect. I would have loved the addition of walnuts or pecans but the person I was preparing it for has a nut allergy.

in the cake recipe i only used 1 cup of sugar added raisins and crushed pineapple. And for the topping i only used one cup of sugar. I keep getting rave reviews from my friends. I have never been a carrot cake lover i made it for my husband but it has made me a lover of carrot cake. People like the fact that its not so sweet. Oh and i used walnuts instead of pecans. and added whipped topping to the frosting.

Moist and delicious, we loved this recipe. I had to leave out the nuts so my son could have some too, I think it was just fine without them.
I'll probably make this one again!

Absolutely awesome with the adjustments made by gneebeanie. I haven't tried it with the pineapple yet but that's because I don't have any crushed!

I made this last night for our Easter brunch today... it smelled and looked so tasty, it was torture to keep it in the fridge overnight! It was moist, full of flavor, and everyone loved it. It was my first time making one so I was nervous, but this recipe was not only easy, but delicious (and made me look like an expert baked!) Thank you!

I made this for my mother-in-law's birthday yesterday. It turned out pretty good! I made the cake the day before and then put the icing on yesterday. Depending on your oven you may want to leave it in longer. I first took it out after 45 minutes and the middle was jello! Another 10+ minutes did the trick though. I didn`t read the recipe and because I didn`t have enough walnuts, I threw in some chopped almonds.

For the icing, you can get away with just one cup of icing sugar, maybe 1 and a bit. 4 cups seems like an excessive amount! And if you find it too stiff, you can dash in some milk until you get the consistency you desire.

Other than that, this was a good cake! Was liked by everyone who had a piece. :)

First time trying this recipe and its really awesome! Made it into cupcakes, and used diabetic sugar instead of white sugar! I made some alterations, and added around half a cup of raisins and 3 and half cups of carrot! Definitely making these moist and flavourful carrot cake again! (:

I have been making this same carrot cake for over 30 yrs. and my family has always loved it.  I do use walnuts and coconut in the frosting. My kids have had me make it for their co-workers etc.

I was asked to make dessert this year for Easter.....the catch?  It had to b a vegan dessert.  I found this recipe and converted it to a vegan carrot cake........absolutely delicious!!!!!!!  I used applesauce instead of eggs, raw sugar in place of white, and vegan cream cheese/vegan butter.  My husband, who is not a vegan LOVED this cake!

Perfect! Made as written except for the frosting. I halved the recipe because I was short on ingredients and I was still able to frost 3/4+ of the cake with about 1/2" thick frosting. I did use the whip attachment on my mixer. Absolutely fantastic!

I made the "healthy" version as soon as I received your All Recipes Magazine.  I increased carrots to 4 cups (that's what I had shredded), increased cinnamon to 2 Tablespoons, added 1c. raisins, omitted nuts and:  WOW!  GREAT recipe!

I have made better carrot cake.  This got good reviews so I tried it but it was rather bland all you taste is the icing.  I guess I will go back to my great grandmothers recipe.

first cake I ever made, it was great not much of a sweet bread cake eater other then white wedding cake. took this to a Cr meeting and they loved it a few wanted the recipe.  I directed them to Allrecipes guess there's something about  printed over directions to the place!  I used walnuts in place of the peacans. infact made two of these in one week! 1 for CR and 1 for Bible study. my carrots was a prebagged shredded kind, dried out a bit, mybe not as moist as fresh carrots, none the less this is a great RECIPE. even for a beginner like me I am into grilling and pizza.

Fantastic recipe first time I've made carrot cake even though its my favorite.  My kids were skeptical since it had carrots in it.  But they were constantly in the kitchen sneaking bites.  I used a different frosting as we like a lot but the cake could have stood on its own.  Only lasted two days in the house, will save for special occasions as its probably high in calories with the frosting.

VERY extremely yummy cake!! after trying this one, ive been SO SO picking about carrot cake! i cannot eat any store-bought or in any coffe-shop carrot cake because this one is as far the best!! Also, i've alterned a bit the recipe by following GneeBeanie for a healthier-moister cake! i also added more carrot :)

Very good cake and excellent frosting.  Only change I made was walnuts in the batter (not frosting), instead of pecans.  Either would be great.  My oven may be hot, so 40 minutes was a tad too long.  Will watch it after 35 minutes next time.  Cake appeared a little overdone at 40, but inside was still moist. Definitely worth making.

Really good.  I added 2/3 cup of crushed pineapple and 1/4 cup of shredded cocnut as well.  With the added liquid of the pineapple, I put in approx 1/4 cup more flour too.  I decreased the confections sugar in frosting to 3 cups as I thought it was sweet enough .  Will definatly make this again.

This recipe is great, I've used it numerous times. I find adding 3-4 teaspoons of ground cinnamon instead of 2, as well as using 1 1/4 white sugar and 1/4 brown sugar instead of just 2 cups of white sugar definitely makes the flavour pop a little more!

The recipe is good. I like my carrot cake a bit spicier so I add mixed spice and some ground cloves. I put my eggs, sugar, oil and baking soda in the blender so that you don't get a baking soda taste. I do this with most cakes.

My niece requested carrot cake for her birthday, so I used this recipe, adding the pineapple and other ingredients as suggested. I reduced the powdered sugar drastically (if I recall, I only used half) and it was perfect. I made it the day ahead and it was truly a delicious cake. Usually I end up throwing some cake out but there was absolutely none left. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this tonight to be part of our Christmas feast tomorrow.  Naturally I had to trim up the edges, so we got to taste the cake before the crowd tomorrow ;)  Absolutely divine with no changes or substitutions. Loved that it didn't have pineapple!  Thank you so much for sharing this terrific recipe.  There's even enough icing left over for use with - oh, perhaps muffins.  I can just imagine a dab on top of my freshly baked apple oatmeal muffins.  Mmmmm...  p.s. Now I'll have to cut back on the turkey and mashed potatoes so I'll have room for cake!  Ah well, one must make sacrifices, eh?

Tried this recipe last night and its a winner.  I did use 1 cup white/1 cup brown sugar for the cake and only used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar for the frosting.  Turned out just like my grandmother used to make.

Amazing!! I just made it and...yummy! I made the half portion, so I used all the ingredients in half. I live in Greece and this is my first attempt to cook something besides my mom's and grandmom's recipes and I m absolutely thrilled! Very light, delicious and easy :) thank you!!

My nine year old daughter and I made this today,it was very good. We stuck with the recipe with very slight changes. We used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup dark brown sugar.

My daughter wanted cupcakes instead so we used 2 cupcake pans making 2 dozen cupcakes. It cooked in half the time, so if you plan to make cupcakes with this recipe, remove from the oven after 20 minutes.

We also used 3 cups of icing sugar. After tasting it as we were mixing we decided it was already very sweet (my nine year old loves sugar and she found it too sweet) I would also cut the frosting mix in half since we had so much left over and each cupcake had a very healthy serving of frosting.

We will definitely make this again!

This was my first time making carrot cake, it was absolutely delicious! I added a cup of raisins because all the carrot cake I've had, included raisins. Key, use golden raisins, nice and plump. I also added half can of crushed pineapples (at suggestion of some comments)in its own juice, drained.I did not have baking soda, just used baking powder, didn't miss it.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. My boyfriend and I found it to be too sweet, but I think it was the frosting that was too rich. Overall, the cake tasted fine, but it wasn't outstanding. I used the smallest holes on my cheese grater for the carrots and next time I will definitely make the carrots thicker. I ended up with the same sink hole in the cake after baking it as others have mentioned. I baked it for 40 minutes and it was perfectly moist. Hope my review is helpful.

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving.  It was loved by all.  I cut the recipe in half, but will definitely make the large cake for Christmas.  The frosting is very rich so I will go easy on the frosting.

I tried it. I haven't had much experience baking but I followed the recipe and everybody said it was gorgeous. I had a few requests for the recipe- a great confidence boost for a baking beginner!
WARNING- A LOT of self control is needed when applying the icing! It's fab.

I made this exactly as written last year for Thanksgiving at my In-Laws.  It is now a required item!  I made it into cupcakes and what wasn't eaten there was taken home by others, no left overs.  I now make it for Thanksgiving at the IN-Laws and Christmas at my home.

I absolutely loved this cake. I hate baking because nothing I've ever baked before has tasted good. This cake was just amazing. I must say next time I make it, I will use brown sugar and less pecans as it was a bit too nutty for my taste. I will also be making half the frosting as it was way too much the first time (I like thin layers of frosting, only). I think I will also add a bit of nutmeg. You may think it's too many alterations but honestly, the way the recipe is written is excellent. I'm just trying to go a bit wild with my first delicious baking experience!

The recipe as is merits 4 stars. Almost perfect. However, I caved and changed things up quite a bit. I used half white and half light brown sugar, used 1/2C. applesauce and the rest of the oil, added 1C. raisins and 1/4t. nutmeg.

I took the advice of other posters and used half brown sugar/half white, and subbed 1/2 cup of apple sauce for half cup of the oil.  i also omitted the nuts. i did feel the frosting recipe made too much, and was a bit too sweet, but that could just be a matter of preference. overall a very delicious and easy cake!

This was a great start to my carrot cake. I did follow the suggestions of others and used nutmeg, brown sugar and applesauce.  I also added rasins to mine. Can't wait to make this again. I would suggest to divide the batter into two cake pans. I had no problem getting the cake out of the pan when (due to me lining the cake pan with parchment paper) and had no problem with uneven cooking.

I loved the altered version of this recipe from gneebeanie's review, except I kept the pineapple juice.  In addition, I sprinkled a portion of the white sugar over the carrots and sat aside while preparing the rest of the ingredients and added raisins.  The cake is moist and tasteful.  I baked the cake for forty minutes at 350 degrees  in a parchment lined airbake pan.  Delicious.

Delicious! I'm not a carrot cake fan. I made it under someone's request, and I Love it. I did found the icing too sweet for me though, so probably next time i'll just use 3 1/2 cups of icing sugar. Great recipe.

I made this for a friend's birthday. I used 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup brown sugar..and only 1/2 cup finely chopped pecans. Everyone raved about how moist it was. I couldn't imagine adding crushed pineapple like some people recommend...ick! Don't overmix and don't overbake! It will be plenty moist! I did not make the frosting recipe from here..I made my own "crusting" cream cheese frosting to get a real smooth finish.

I made this recipe into cupcakes and LOVED it! Even my husband who doesn't like carrot cake ate a ton of them and raved about it! I split the sugar into white and brown (half each), increased the cinnamon a bit, added a bit of nutmeg, used walnuts instead of pecans, used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil (healthier), and halved the baking powder and baking soda (based on other reviews). Also, when I mixed all the ingredients the batter looked incredibly thick, so i added a cup of yogurt and a few drops of milk. The result was amazing, moist carrot cake. Thank you for this recipe... will definitely make it again!

I halved the portion and made 6 cupcakes and 12 mini cupcakes. My family doesn't like cakes too sweet so I only used 1/2 cup of sugar (half of the halved portion). I found the frosting too sweet even after I've decreased the icing sugar to 1 cup (half of the halved portion). Easy adjustment was to add more cream cheese. At 350F, the mini cupcakes took 10 min and the normal size cupcakes took 20 min. The end product was so delicious!

Love it! But I tweaked it to my family's liking, decreased cinnamon to 1 teaspoon and added 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of ginger. Omitted pecans and did walnuts and no nuts in frosting! Great recipe will make it often!  Also will try with light brown sugar next time.

Great stuff!(made with suggestions in most popular rating) This cake didn't have a chance! It was gone in a matter of HOURS! (there are only four of us) It was so moist and flavorful. I added crushed and drained pineapple because carrot cake(to me) tastes best with pineapple tartness. SO GOOD! can't say it enough.....I'm making ANOTHER!!!! keeper? YES!!!

Absolutely my favorite recipe... I use this as my base reference for making carrot cake, but then change it up- alot, just to experiment. The recipe itself doesn't need changing to taste better, but if you want to make it healthier, take out about 1 quarter of the sugar, and do 1/2 bran, 1/2 flour.... This hardly changes the taste... I make it differently every time and every-time its amazing- a family favorite!

This is my go to carrot cake recipe.  I normally use it for cupcakes, but it bakes up just as nicely for a layered cake.  I don't change a thing with about the recipe.  Yummy with or without frosting.

I 1/2 this recipe and it made just over 12 cupcakes.  AND THEY WERE WONDERFUL!!  I don't even care for carrot cake!   I also made the frosting but omitted the butter and just did 4 oz cream cheese, vanilla, and powdered sugar.  it was great!  sprinkled with a dash of cinnamon.  they were very pretty.  Thank you for the great recipe

Fantastic. I brought this carrot cake to a picnic with friends and when I left there was only one piece still on the plate. I substituted walnuts for pecans and added dates. The icing recipe made a lot more icing than I needed for the cake. I'd probably halve the icing.

Yum!  I didn't change a thing for the cake, and it was delicious! I had a pre-made Pillsbury frosting, so I didn't try the frosting recipe.  We ate this warm, and it was soooooo good.  Definitely my favorite carrot cake recipe!

This is my go to recipe for Carrot cake! It is so good and easy to make- I do however make a few substitutions when I make it; 1 cup of white sugar & 1 cup of brown, and I sub apple sauce for entire oil 1 and a 1/4 cups. I also add a pinch of nutmeg. I make this often and everyone LOVES it! Thank you!

Following the advice of the top-rated review, this was an excellent cake. I did only add 3 cups of icing sugar to the icing and I still found it a bit sweet. Will definitely make again.

I make this for our family birthdays. I sub Spelt Flour in place of all-purpose (virtually no gluten) and it still turns out beautifully. I take out 1/2 cup sugar.  Moist and tasty. Everyone always raves.

I made this cake exactly as written.  I think it is way too heavy on the baking soda/baking powder.

LOVE this recipe! I followed some of the suggestions: apple sauce and oil (instead of oil) 8oz. crushed pineapple (with some juice, not all) and 1/4 t of nutmeg.  I've been making this for a long time and it's a HUGE crowd pleaser!

Turned out ok. I think the only way to make it better is to use a butter based recipe. But for dairy-free, this is a very good carrot cake recipe.

Now THIS is a carrot cake! The cake itself is not that sweet, so the cream cheese icing complements it perfectly. I only made two modifications: 1.) I used cashews instead of pecans, and 2.) I didn't add nuts to the icing. I do believe those changes do not greatly affect the overall outcome of the cake.

My kids and I prepared this a few nights ago.  We had fun making it a family affair.  I did not have any nuts so I prepared sans nuts.  However this was one of the best carrot cakes I ever had.  It is not very sweet but the frosting more than takes up for that.  I think I will find a less sweet frosting recipe.  We can't seem to stop eating this cake. I doubled the recipe and we still don't have enough!

I made this as my first homemade cake.  It was surprisingly easy, considering the circumstances.  I was making the cake for my husband for his birthday, carrot cake is his favorite, however, he didn't like it...  
I gave it a three b/c I did like it, but it was not the best I've ever had by a long shot.  I made the recipe exactly as directed (w/o pecans) and found the cake to be a little bland and the icing to be way too sweet.  These two problems balanced each other out, which is why I kind of liked it.  Next time I need to spruce up the cake and maybe add more cream cheese to the icing.

I made this and though it was extremly easy I should have followed the other reviewers tips and used applesauce,but I had none on hand so I used all the oil as called for. You can literally taste the oil in the cake, it's very dissapointing. Also wheres the raisins in all these recipes? carrot cake is better with raisins!!

Did I do something wrong?? I thought this was nowhere near carrot-y enough for a carrot cake.  Mine looked like the picture at the top -- like a spice cake with some carrots in it.  It actually tasted pretty bland, even though I upped the spices.  The batter tasted amazing so I was quite disappointed.  Maybe my expectations of a carrot cake are different to the other reviewers...?

Tastes great. Very moist. I baked it for 45 mins the top of the cake sunk in. Perhaps cooking it a bit longer would have let it rise.

The best carrot cake in my opinion.  I made this for the family and it was so good that I made one for my husband's pot luck @ work.  He said that it was gone in no time and everyone was raving about it!  Didn't change a thing.  Wonderful as is.

After much anticipation to bake this cake, it turned out terrible. It calls for 2 tspn of baking soda AND baking powder!!? Not realizing this is WAY too much, I followed the recipe. Based on other recipes, it should only 2 tspn of one or the other. It was like I was eating baking soda, not a cake.

I followed this recipe 100%. It seemed like too much oil, but I did exactly what the recipe says, and I usually have good luck baking! I didn't overmix, properly preheated... and they FLOPPED! Seemed really oily and not enough flour or something. I coursely grated the carrots, didn't seem like they were watery or anything. Usually when I bake with soda/powder - I notice the reaction taking place, but I didn't notice that when I made these. So frustrating, had to make box cake last minute for birthday. (i made cupcakes initially, assume that shoudn't matter). I think applesauce  would work out better for some of the oil.

This is the best carrot cake I have had after I adjusted the recipe. I used the following instead: 4 eggs, 3/4 cup of oil, 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white sugar,2 1/2 tsps of vanilla extract, 2 cups all-purpose flour, 2 tsps baking soda, 2 tsps of baking powder, 1/2 tsp of salt, 2 1/2 tsp. of ground cinnamon,3 cups of grated carrots, 1 cup of chopped pecans, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/2 of a cup of applesauce.I gathered these from several other suggested. It is delicious. I have been making it for the last 3 years and my family keeps asking for more.

Made it for my moms birthday, it was simple after I read through the recommendations & left out nuts to accommodate my family.
My mom loved it & so did my kids! I would make this cake again.

This was scrumptious! I confess I made it according to the changes suggested in the "most helpful" comment, all except for the added pineapple, and it was gorgeous! A very moist, flavorful cake! I sent it to work with my hubby and received tons of wonderful comments back telling me what an amazing baker I am. Hahahha! Gotta love recipes that make you out to be fabulous!

This was an awesome carrot cake!  My 9 & 8 year old sons and 8 & 11 year old niece and nephew LOVED it too! I did tweak a few things: I used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg & reduced the pecans to about 3/4 cup. Very moist and delicious!

Delicious! I made this for a pot luck dinner and received rave reviews.  I was told it was even better than the local gourmet bakery!  I made it in 2 round pans, baked for 40 min.  Frosting - left out the vanilla as the confectioners' sugar made it sweet enough.  Was asked immediately for the recipe. Thank you!

Rave reviews..have made this twice and feedback the same...best ever carrot cake! You cannot get a better cake, and the frosting is just perfect! I would not even bother looking any further...agree that toasting the pecans first adds to the depth of flavor!

It took me awhile to figure out how to grate the carrots, but I finally used my food processor and that worked really well.   Otherwise, the recipe was easy to follow and I got so many compliments on this cake.  I don't even like carrot cake usually (I made this for a birthday party) but even I ate multiple pieces!

Wonderful and oh so simple!!! I whipped it up an hour before leaving for a dinner party and it was a real hit (though transporting a hot cake was not such an easy feat!). However, I did substitute walnuts for pecans, as here in Greece we don't have pecans, and I love the bitter edge of walnuts in sweet recipes. Thanks for sharing!!!

I have never had carrot cake before, but my husband wanted one for his Birthday. I followed this recipe exactly how it is written and he said it was the best carrot cake he has ever had. It is creamy and rich. I now love carrot cake :)  I made 1 and a half batches of the frosting because I made it circular layered cake. The frosting was suprisingly easy to make without an electric mixer of any sort. I just used a fork to cream it all together and it turned out perfect. Thank you so much for posting this!

I try this recipe yesterday, followed the recipe to a T. Although it tasted Awesome, it wasn't as fluffy as others I have tasted and the walnuts settled to the bottom which became the top. I cooked it in a pyrex casserole dish. Can someone shed some light on what the possible cause's could be.  Thanks!

Absolutely love this recipe. I omit the pecans and reduce the powdered sugar to 3 cups. My family doesn't like nuts in things and I like the tartness of the cream cheese. This wins rave reviews every time I make it for whomever I make it.

Slightly drier than I hoped, but I only had one cup of carrots. I used half applesauce and half oil. It was still delicious. Next time I will add the can of crushed pineapple.

I made this for my mom's birthday and I followed the recipe exactly.  My entire family loved it and my mom said she thinks it was the best carrot cake she's ever had.  I also think it's the best carrot cake I've ever had.  Nice and dense/moist and the pecans were a great addition.

Never made a carrot cake and rarely do I cook.  This recipe was easy for a newbie like me.  It was absolutely delicious!  Made it for my husband for his birthday -he was so surprised and we both loved it!

I made a few alterations to this recipe: 
Cake: I made the batter into cupcakes instead of a cake. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of grouind nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger. the cupcakes came out a bit oily...but I'm sure if I'd read the reviews before I would have found an alternative that would not have let this happen.

Icing: I have my own recipe for cream cheese Icing that my family loves: 8 oz cream cheese, 1/2 cup butter, 1 teaspoon vanilla, 2 cups powdered sugar... :)

Enjoy!

I made this for my birthday and frosted it with a carmel-cream cheese buttercream frosting that I whipped up.  Good cake, nice and moist, but not as oily-gooey as some others I've had.

This is the best carrot cake I've had.  Made this for my daughters graduation and everyone loved it.  the only thing I did different is bake it at 325 degrees.  I've been told by my cake decorating instructor that you should always bake your cakes at this temperature to keep them moist.

I made it without any changes.  I bought the pre-packaged bag of carrot "matchsticks" at the grocery store. It looked close to three cups, so I threw the whole thing in there. I brought it to work and they went crazy for it. Even those who don't like carrot had seconds.

Very tasty cake, I made a 2 layered 9 inch cake w/ a center layer of cheesecake for my husband's birthday, got rave reviews. My cakes did fall, but may have been the pans i used, still turned out most delish! My husband has now requested I make this for his birthday every year, will definitely use again!

I thought this was excellent!! Very most and tasty.  I made the recipe plus another half-recipe for a three nine-inch round tiers. I pretty much followed the recipe, but was short a little oil, so used some applesauce. Also, I did add extra cinnamon and about 1/2 tsp nutmeg.

 I made 1.5 times the frosting, which worked fine for filling the layers and a crumb coat (I applied fondant to the outside of the cake). For only cream cheese frosting, I think I will need to double the frosting ingredients.

Hello! I have made this cake several times and the taste is the best carrot cake ever.... but my only problem with this is that it always sink in the middle while it is still in the oven (the last cooking minutes)... Does anyone have the same problem? can anyone tell me what I might be doing wrong?

This needs no alterations! this was so delicious...I did do some oil and some applesauce, but I do that with most baking recipes.  It took me about 9 medium carrots to get the 3 cups.  Seriously, try to follow the recipes first before changing it if you have not tried this yet.  So moist and delicious- took exactly 40 min in a 9x13 metal pan

This is a wonderful recipe for Carrot Cake. It's so moisture, rich and tasty... 

I live in Germany and most people know the "American version" of Carrot Cake from coffee houses like Starbucks. So they usually never had a homemade one... 

The cake itself comes out tender and moist with a wonderful taste and smell of the pecans and cinnamon. 

The frosting is rich & creamy - the perfect addition to a special cake.

As many people before already wrote - it's great to add some crushed pineapples (but you don't have to - it's still great without them).

Definitely a 5* recipe. 
Easy, fast and tasteful.

Excellent! I made a few changes- the first is that I used 1tbsp cinnamon, then added 1tsp each giner, all spice, and nutmeg. The second is that I a sprinkled chopped pecans on top of the cake after I frosted it, and I didn't use the cream cheese frosting, I made a classic white frosting.

This is a fantastic recipe.  I used walnuts instead of pecans (that's what I had on hand) and only used the nuts in the cake.  The cake was moist and not too sweet which balanced perfectly with the rich cream cheese frosting.

This cake was delicious! I followed gneebeanie review. Currently the 1st review. The only thing I changed because I was out of oil was I used 1/4 cup oil and 1 cup applesauce and I used better crocker cream cheese because I had it on hand. YUMMY. Cooked for 45 middle did not fall. Thank you so much. The family loved it.

I really love this carrot cake, following others' recommendation, the cake turned out very moist, not to sweet, and love the pecan addition instead of the usual walnut. This recipe serves big portions of cakes, would probably halved it if not using 9x13in pan.

Loved it!!!! Best carrot cake I have evr made.  Entire family loved it.  The only thing I did was add 1/4tsp of nutmeg and 1/4 tsp of  All Spice in place of 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I also used glazed walnuts instead of pecans.  It was moist and easy to make.  The icing was awesome also.  A bit sweet but great.

I made this for today's Easter and it was a huge hit. Everyone loved it and I wish I got more then one piece of it! I will be making it again for next weekend for our other family dinner. I did not change the recipe at all (except left the nuts out due to allergy) and it turned out amazing!

This recipes was perfect! I used this recipe and it was so delicious. I didn't use pecans in the frosting though as I'm not huge on nuts instead I sprinkled a few on top. Nobody believed me when I said it was my first time with this recipe. I will DEFINITELY be making this again!!!!!

This cake is pretty good but not the best carrot cake i have ever had. I wish i would have added raisins. Also the frosting gets hard and thick in the fridge when in my opinion should be light and fluffy. Over all not bad.

I have tried several carrot cake recipes from this site and this one is definitely the best.  I used the cream cheese frosting with brown butter and bourbon from this site and it really took it to the next level.  I make a carrot cake for Easter every year and this is the first time that I saved a recipe to use for next year.  EDIT! I just tried to do half brown sugar half white like many other reviewers and it is not HALF as good...STICK TO THE RECIPE!!!

Best carrot cake I have ever had.  I made it the first time as is, then the next time made two changes. First I used half brown sugar, half regular and I honestly couldn't tell the difference.  Then I cut down on the powdered sugar in the icing the second time because it is REALLY sweet and takes away from the cake.

I loved this. I made some of the changes I read in the reviews here. Subbing half the oil for applesauce and adding just a bit of nutmeg. Wow, I've never seen my family tear through a cake so fast! I did this in 2 9x9 inch pans and did a tiered cake. I only baked for 32 minutes. YUM! I didn't put the pecans IN the frosting but stuck them around the outer edges as a decoration. Also, I did not have to double to frosting, this made PLENTY but mine came out a little thick an I thinned it with about 1 teaspoon of milk for the perfect spreadable consistency! WHAT A WINNER!

This is a fantastic EASY recipe.  I found using the oil blend (Smart Balance) makes the cake just a little lighter.  I also add an extra tsp of cinnamon.  This makes excellent cupcake and always disappears quickly when I bring it to work.

This was a great cake! Followed some suggestions to use 1/2 cup applesauce in place of some of the oil, just because it sounded like it would add some extra flavor! I loved the wonderful frosting too!

This was the best carrot cake I have ever had, I followed the recipe exactly except I let my daughter put raisins around the cake when we frosted it. It's moist, has perfect spicing, and was finished by morning. This deserves 10 stars! Thank You for sharing this recipe...

Otherwise fantastic!

This is the first time ever I baked a cake and it came out perfect. After reading the reviews i changed the recipe according to gneebeanies recommendations. For the frosting I used the one for the "clone of a cinnabon". This was just enough to cover te cake and I liked it that way (sweet enough). Thanks for this great recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Cooking in high altitude with an oven that is On or Off with no baking powder, I figured this cake would be a disaster.  NO!  Not only was it moist and spongy but the flavor was so amazing that I had at least three people ask for the recipe!

wow, this cake is amazing.  i made them into cupcakes and although they don't rise much, they were a hit.  i used a different frosting recipe that called for a 1/4 tsp of salt and only 1 1/2 tsp of butter and 1 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and that worked out great.  it was a lot creamier and not as heavy.  i think i'm going to be making a lot of carrot cake this spring...

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. I followed the recipe exactly, opting out of the pecans. It was one of the best from scratch cakes I've ever made!!! My husband loved it, and myself, not being a big fan of carrot cake, actually went for a second piece! It was moist and flavorful.

Awesome!!! Awesome!!!! No words describe how wonderful this recipe was. My husband loved it, and he is the worst food critic. The cake was so moist. I did follow a few changes from other reviews. I added 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar. Added 1/2 cup of applesauce and small can of crushed pineapples. I also used canola oil instead.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!  I have been making this recipe over a number of years for Thanksgiving.  The first time I made it was around 2008.  It has become a part of the holiday tradition. I made one change and used butter instead of oil.

YUMMY but only with the CHANGES that I made (according to other reviewers & my personal taste). I felt that the original recipe would be TOO sweet. I wanted genuine taste, and not bake a cake that would be too sweet and taste like store-bought.

These were the changes: 
For the cake: 3/4 cups oil, 1.5 cups brown sugar, 1 extra teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 cup applesauce & I didn't add pecans because I didn't have any.

For the frosting: 2 cups powdered sugar (too sweet, in my opinion. For the next bake, I would only add 1.5 cups - this also brings out the cheese taste which is great) & I didn't add pecans because I didn't have any.

I baked on the top rack of my oven at exactly 40 minutes (but do the toothpick test since your oven may be different from mine). I baked in a 9x13 inch pan & cooled completely. I then cut the cake in half and made a layer cake with the frosting. I put it in the fridge for about 4 hours and served. It was delicious and moist. Everyone at home and my friends loved it :)

The flavor is awesome. however after making cupcakes and the centers falling, I read one of the reviews by" Reviewed on Mar. 30, 2007 by CYNJAMS, I thought back on how I made mine. I did not overbeat, used the exact measurements. BUT, I do live above 7000 feet, so for the batter I have left i am going to add just a touch more flour. Will see how that works...Great light flavorful carrot cake....

This cake is very moist and flavorful, but I found that it could have used a bit more salt. I omitted the pecans and added some crushed pineapple and a bit of nutmeg. Mine also turned out very dark, not at all like the picture, but my family loved it. If you're going to make this, I suggest adding about twice the amount of salt it calls for. Overall a delicious cake.

I'm not a big fan of carrot cake, but apparently I'm the only one in my family who isn't. I made this for a birthday and followed the recipe as written using the author's option to leave out the pecans. (I didn't have any.) I used 8 inch rounds and had two full layers & a third slightly shorter layer, which I froze. I believe I would have had enough icing if my kids had stayed out of it until the end. But layers use a little more and we tend to be a bit generous with it anyway. 

 I did not find this cake to be greasy or oily and my family raved about how moist it was. Judging by the way they inhaled it, it must have been fine. It certainly smelled wonderful. I foresee more of these in my future.

Delicious!!. it's light and fluffy and moist...I would rate 5 star but I too change a couple of things..3/4c oil & 1/2c apple sauce aswell 1c brown sugar , 1/2c white & 1/4c apple butter , I also added 1/2tsp nutmeg.  Instead of using a cake pan i made xlarge cupcakes it made 12 full cups and baked 25 min
I tweeked the icing as well and halfed everything but the cream cheese

This is incredible! I am 18 years old and have never made a carrot cake in my life. However, I had a random craving and decided to give this recipe a shot. It might honestly be the best carrot cake I have ever had. I didn't have cream cheese, so I actually used vanilla frosting that I whipped up using a different recipe. However, I used to cake recipe as is, and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out! My dad doesn't even like carrot cake, and he actually liked this! Haha! Thanks so much for the terrific recipe!

I was looking for a recipe to send a birthday cake to my son at college, and this was perfect.  I baked it in a disposable 9x13 pan, let it cool in the pan, then placed the pan into the second pan that came in the package.  I frosted it with canned cream cheese frosting (figuring the chemicals/preservatives would travel better than cream cheese), my daughter decorated it, and then covered it with the plastic cover that came with the pans.  It fit perfectly snugly in the fedex box, with some stuffing at one end, and I shipped it 2-day - still  cheaper than having a cake delivered by a bakery.  My son said it was perfect - still moist and delicious after 2 days, and of course lasted less than an hour once it arrived.  He and his friends loved that it was homemade and could basically eat it out of the pan.  Will be an annual birthday tradition for my 3 college kids!

I've been wanting some carrot cake for a long while.  I can't just buy an already baked one, because of the nuts.  I'm allergic.  So, I found this recipe, which had rave reviews, made without the nuts.  It came out delicious.  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, only because I ran out of white sugar.  It tasted great to me; so I will use that from now on...because I'll be making it again.  It was quick and easy, and the icing makes it even better!

Excellent!!This recipe is definitely a keeper.This is the first time i ever made a cake without cake mix and was really surprised with the outcome.The cake had just the right amount of everything.(The only alteration i did was using 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar)But i am sure the cake would be delicious if the exact recipe is followed. Thanks so much for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

no need to change this recipe, everyone loves it. The only change I made was I cut the fat by substituting apple sauce for half the oil since my love is on a fat restricted diet.

This cake by itself was lacking a little something. I made the recipe exactly as is, and  felt the cake itself could have been sweeter. However, the flavor was still good, and the cake was nice and moist. The icing was the best part. It was fantastic! I may try this one again, but if I do I'll take the suggestions of others and use brown sugar and/ or crushed pineapples.

Great recipe.  Instead of nuts, I added raisins.  I am always looking for sweets for my husband to satisfy a sweet tooth without putting him in diabetic shock.  To make the cake more diabetic friendly, cut back real sugar by half and add 1 cup artificial sweetener (splenda).  I haven't found any way to reduce the confectioners sugar in frosting and keep the right flavor... but with this cake, you don't need a thick layer of icing.  It's moist and has a great flavor without drowning it with icing.   About a 1/4 inch is plenty to compliment with that rich cream cheese flavor.

I made it as written and it was wonderful.  Mine did fall just a tad, but I did step away from the mixer for a minute and probably mixed it slightly too long.  It was moist and had just the right amount of sweetness.  Thanks for a great recipe!

It tasted AMAZING!!! I put in 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. Mine did fall, but that was because I didn't cook the centre enough. We stuck a toothpick in the center, it came out clean, but still not cooked enough. Oh well, my family did not judge on presentation, but the taste was fabulous!!

I made this carrot cake for my daughter's first birthday and everyone loved it!  Excellent recipe.  I left out the pecans.  I only used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and added 1 cup of applesauce.

I made this cake for Christmas dinner. No nuts because I have 2 under 2, so I subbed 1 tbsp of hazelnut coffee syrup for the nutty flavor.  I also took the advice of others and used 1/4 c oil and 1 cup of applesauce. It was fantastic and VERY moist. this is a keeper

The cake was passable, but not really as a carrot cake.  The good: it was light and fluffy.  The bad: too oily, and not nearly enough carrots.  Perhaps this cake is usually carried by the frosting, but I didn't make any for mine and so can't say anything about it.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

This is the first carrot cake I've ever made and it turned out quite well. I used a round spring form pan (which was smaller in diameter and deeper), since I didn't have a 9x13, so I baked at 325 for 60mins, turned out great. And the frosting is fantastic! Also, after reading some reviews I decided to use an extra teaspoon of vanilla, and like I said, it tastes great! Definitely using this one again.

This is so fantastic , i honestly did not think that this cake would come out this good. I did add crushed pineapples to the recipe and instead of pecans used walnuts, it was wonderful. I honestly never really liked carrot cakes until i tasted this one. The only regret i have is not hiding it away in my room..  it was completely devoured in less than 2 days  :'(

I love this recipe! Every time I make this, everyone loves and compliments on how delicious the cake is. I did add modifications to the recipe. Instead of using 1 1/4 cups vegetable oil, I substituted the 1 cup of oil for 1 cup of applesauce. With sweetened applesauce, I used 1 cup of sugar rather than 2 cups of sugar. The cake came out moist & delicious without the extra oil.

The cake turned out really moist, texture was on the dot.  I substituted walnuts for pecans and added 1/3 cup of coconut shreds which turned out really nice.  However, I find this recipe to be way too sweet for me.  I added 1 cup of sugar instead of the recommended 2 cups and it was still too sweet.

This cake is very moist and has a wonderful, classic  flavor!  I used the large grater to grate amazingly sweet, flavorful carrots.  I baked it in two round cake pans for 40 minutes and stacked them once they cooled for a better presentation.  I made sure to whip the frosting until is was light and fluffy (without the nuts).  I would recommend this cake to anyone.

I joined this website specifically to review this cake.. Ihave made this cake about 15 times, and each time I am told it's the best carrot cake they have ever had.  I never tried carrot cake until I made this, and I wont eat any other!  I do not use pecans, I use walnuts.. and I also do not put as much walnuts in the frosting because i find it makes it harder to frost.  Anyone who says this cake isn't good isn't making it the right way!  I use two round pans, and i bake two cakes.  I use the frosting to pile them ontop of eachother making one round cake. Comes out perfect everytime!

Excellent cake, great flavor.  What ever you do, don't try making it in two rounds.  I did and the batter fit fine, but once in the oven it rose beyond the rim of the pan and boy do I have a mess in my oven to clean up!  My fault though.... Otherwise, will make it again! :)

This was simply divine.  I'm giving it 4 -stars because I used all of the revisions made by gneebeanie in a 2008 review, so I don't feel like I can give full credit to the original.  I also used my own cream cheese frosting recipe.  This one has way too much sugar for my taste.

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday cake and he LOVED it! He is a huge carrot cake fan and said this was very good.  I left out the pecans and instead of a 9"x13" pan, I used a 9" round cake pan and made a two-layer cake. I love love love this recipe!

Wonderful recipe.  My brother wanted me to make a carrot cake as his wedding cake.  I made the recipe first for a church function and it got rave reviews.  I did add some crushed pineapple, cutting back a little on the oil for balance and omitted the pecans since not everyone likes nuts. Then I tripled the recipe with some different sized round pans; added some pink heart-shaped marzipan and decorative almonds.  Perfect- especially the frosting.  Thanks so much for posting!

All in all very tasty. Our party seemed to really enjoy it! Add a little food coloring to the frosting and make it a little thicker with the sugar and you can decorate it very cute! This is my husbands favorite.

I made this for my mothers birthday - came out great!! I left out the pecans entirely, and also took the advice of others, such as replacing some of the oil with applesauce, and using 1 cup white and 1 cup brown sugar.  The frosting is amazing! great recipe!

This cake is moist and delicious and the frosting is to die for the perfect cream cheese frosting. I followed all the advice of reviewer "gneebeanie" and added a little more cinnamon and around 3/4 c. of raisins, as my hubby loves thim in his carrot cake. Also added an 8 oz can of pineapple tidbits that I chopped in the chopper for about 3-4 pulses. Also, added the nuts (walnuts  not pecans) to the cake and left the icing nice and smooth. This cake is dense without being too sweet and just plain delicious. Did have a little problem getting out of the pan so make sure to grease and flour very well, so just left it in the pan to cool and frost. Will definitely make again!!

Very good however I did use all of geneebeanie's suggestions. Came out very moist. I didnt find it overly oily. It made two 9inch layers and about 5 or 6 cupcakes. Very moist with the suggestions! I didn't find it to have too many nuts but I didnt add any to the frosting.

I made this for a party and it was a big hit. I did not find the icing too sweet like many people commented (but I like sweet icing) and to reduce the oiliness that some people reported, I used 1 cup of oil instead of the full amount and the zest and juice of 1 orange (about 1/4 cup). The cake was still dense and moist with a hint of orange flavour.

This is an absolutely fantastic cake. I only changed the Pecan nuts which are extremely expensive here where I live with normal hazel nuts, very finely grated. The cake is moist, soft, with a very delicate taste, even without frostin (my daughter is very picky with cheese of all sorts, even sweet ones :-) I will definitely repeat the experiment

i didn't change a thing about the actual recipe and it was fantastic! the only "problem" was that i didn't use all the icing it made. i baked in two 9 in. round pans for approx 30 minutes. the presentation of a layer cake made it gorgeous as well as tasty.

It was the first time I ever made a carrot cake, and the recipe was clear and very easy to follow.   The taste was awesome, but the cake was way too oily (compared to all the other carrot cakes I've had, home made by friends or bought in pastry shops). I don't know if it has anything to do with the fact I used the metric conversion supplied on the page. It did seem like a lot of oil at the time when I was making the cake, but I still went ahead.   And once the cake was baked, if you pressed on it gently, you could literally see oil seeping out. Too bad, cause the taste was lovely! I'll definitely do it again, but with about 1/3 less oil.

This recipe is a decent tasting recipe, but it is not at all good for you!  4 cups of confectioner's sugar is WAY TOO MUCH! Not necessary.  If you want a sweet satisfying icing without the sugar spike, diabetes, tooth decay etc.... try using the same amount of cream cheese, butter and vanilla and add only one cup of powdered (I used a coffee grinder to powder mine) xilitol or birch sugar.  Available at health food stores like Vitamin Shoppe.   I added one cup xilitol and one cup Organic cane sugar to the cake.  You can use rapadura instead as well.

I make this every Easter to rave reviews! Its the perfect carrot cake for someone who doesn't like pineapple. I add a little more cream cheese and a little less powdered sugar to the icing to give it more of a tangy cream cheese taste.

I made this cake today for a birthday. I added an extra tsp of cinnamon and a bit of nutmeg. It came out great! Everyone was asking for the recipe.  Instead of grating my own carrots, I used julianned carrots from the grocery store.

I did everything to prevent from falling in the middle, I preheated the oven for 30 minutes, baked it at 360 for 50 minutes, was very careful about all of the ingredients and it still fell in the middle.  I even was very careful and only mixed it barely with my kitchenaide stand mixer!!!  Darn it!

I loved making this recipe with my daughter. It was easy and delicious. The cream cheese frosting was the best. We save a little on the side, used food coloring and decorated by making orange frosting and making little carrots on top.

Every single time I make this, I get SO many compliments about how it's the best carrot cake they've ever eaten. I love it too. Probably one of my favorite cakes to make. Also, sometimes I like to add maple syrup in place of sugar. I usually double the recipe and do 3 cups sugar and 1 cup of maple syrup. It adds moisture to the cake and a hint of maple flavor. SUPER TASTY!!! THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!

WOW! I used a lot of tips from other posters including the applesauce one.  I also added raisens and skipped the nuts.  My hubby doesn't like nuts and carrot cake just isn't carrot cake to me without raisens lol.  After a few days sitting in the fridge (I'm in Arizona) the flavor just got better! DEF a keeper!

This was my 1st time making this cake, and I really enjoyed just taking my time. Wow, it came out really good. It was nice and fluffy, and very crunchy at the same time. I loved it. My family enjoyed it. :)

Perfect recipe!  I didn't have pecans available, but the taste was devine!  I used unsweetend apple sauce for half of the measured amount of oil.  Taste and texture was perfect!  I also used raw cane sugar, which is a bit sweeter than refined white sugar, so you could possible cut the amount down a bit.  1/4 tsp of nutmeg gave it the perfect kick!

Delicious!!!  So moist- I actually ending up shredding than chopping the carrots in a food processor for extra-fine texture.  Also subbed 1 4oz jar of baby pears (that's what I had on hand instead of applesauce or pureed carrots) instead of all that oil.  DELISH!

Good taste, but it is more like bread than cake.  Mine also sunk in in the middle, and I made sure not to overmix or undermix.  It seems to dense to be a cake.

Every single time I make this, I cannot get enough of it. It comes out perfect! The ONLY thing I do different is judge how much carrots I use. Usually 2 and a half cups is plenty. Then the rest of the carrot I sprinkle on top of the frosting to add decor.

This was a DELICIOUS carrot cake! I made it last night at 8pm and it was already half gone by this morning!  I followed many of the suggestions and added an extra 1t each of vanilla and cinnamon to the cake. I also added 4t of ground ginger and substituted walnuts for pecans.  The only downside (not really a downside) is I personally think there was too much frosting for the cake. Next time I'll make 3/4 as much!

It was my 1st time making Carrot cake. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar, and apple sauce as others suggested. It turned so yummy!! My husband and me ate without frosting (we couldn't wait!)

An other recipe that worked perfectly for me but I really don't have a sweettooth so for me it was way too sweet and all my family agreed, so I think I will put 1 cup of sugar next time and I also think it requires more cinnamon...

With the icing it's five stars, but the cake on its own is quite bland and only worth three stars.  I'm going to try it again using a bit more spice and some minced pineapple.

I'm a college student and carrot cake is by far my favorite and had never attempted to make it myself. I followed this recipe but did not have baking soda so left that out and added a can of crushed pineapple and it was awesome!! I shared it with roommate and sorority sisters and everyone loved it. Will definitely make again!

WONDERFUL. I followed the cake recipe exactly - I had zero problems with the amount of baking soda/powder called for.  I did make two 9-inch round cakes instead of a 9x13 because I wanted to serve as a layer cake.   For the frosting I only used 3.5 cups of confectioners' sugar - just add half a cup at a time once you've added 2 cups so that you get the flavor your family loves. We love sweet frosting with a hint of cream cheese, not super tangy or overly sweet either.  You may find that you need to add a couple tablespoons of milk to reach a good spreading consistency (I did).  Cannot stress what rave reviews this received!  Plates were (literally) licked clean :)

Oh my gosh that is heavenly carrot cake... I haven't even frosted yet! I made these into cupcakes (I got 26 total, baked for 20 minutes at 350) and will be using my own cream cheese frosting and serving to some hungry Marines tomorrow who I'm sure will enjoy them as much as I am! I used 1 cup veggie oil and 1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce and left the pecans out and otherwise followed the recipe precisely. It is moist and has a wonderful mild flavor. My first time making homemade carrot cake, and I'm in love. :)

This is the most moist and delicious carrot cake, ever!  It is also the first one that I've ever made.  I did make a couple of minor changes... I added a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, used 3/4 cup of veg. oil and 1/2 c. of applesauce, and used chopped walnuts instead of pecans.  DELICIOUS!!! :)

Great carrot cake! I cut the recipe in half, which made a nice 8" round cake, cut it into 2 layers and frosted in the middle. I kept the frosting  recipe in full amount, which gave me enough frosting to frost it in the middle, on top of the cake and make some decorations on top (my 6 year-old was thrilled to make carrots out of icing). Very moist, not too sweet, just perfect!

AMAZING!!! I love to bake and before this recipe I had never made carrot cake. I have to say that it is the best I have ever had, you have to try it. My husband said he was not a huge fan of carrot cake, then after taking a bite and a boyish grin said "this is one of my favorite cakes" ;)...well worth it!!!!...Jen

Four cups of confectioner's sugar gave me entirely too much icing. Maybe three cups. Otherwise, this recipe was wonderful. I took it to Sunday dinner, and it was gone in less time than it took for me to bake it. For anybody trying to step up their chef game, this is a great place to start.

This was excellent; I had to refridgerate it for two days before serving b/c I didn't have time to make it the day of the event and it still tasted great.  I made it for my fiance's family and got lots of compliments.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I did incorporate changes by other reviewers - used half white and half brown sugar, apple sauce instead of full amount of oil, extra vanilla, and less pecans.  For the icing, I found it made too much for one cake, but it's better to have extra than not enough.

best carrot cake recipe i have found, I added some extra spices and uses whole grain pastry flour. I think the recipe needs some acid to activate the baking soda and alow the cake to rise alittle more.

Very tasty! I didn't change a thing (except for a dash of nutmeg) Next time I make it I might try using more cinnamon and nutmeg for a little more spice.

I LOVE this carrot cake but since I don't like my cake too sweet, I down the white sugar to 3/4 of a cup and use 1/2 of brown sugar and 1/4 white sugar instead of all white.  On the frosting, I only use 1 cup of confectioner's sugar instead of 4, and I still find it a tab sweet, so next time I probably only use 3/4 cup instead of 1. And cut the butter to about 1/3 or even 1/4.    Since I have an electric oven, I don't think it needs 30-40 mins, probably 25 should be plenty.  Will def make it again soon!!

i made this thinking it was going to be great with 5 stars. i read the reviews and saw people made modifications but i also some people who said they made this the way its supposed to be made and it turned out great. not the case. i made cupcakes out of this recipe. filled it 3/4th and it was the biggest muffin top ever! so i only filled it half way the next time, they came out to be a better size but the top was crispy and hard while the middle sank. no flavor what so ever.

This recipe was incredible! It was the perfect texture and sweetness. The only little changes I made were: I used 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar instead. Also, I used 1/2 tsp baking soda and 1 and 1/2 tsp baking powder because I dislike the taste of baking soda in my cakes (it still raised nicely). Instead of using 1/2 cup oil, I used 1/4 cup oil and 1/4 cup sour cream. Lastly, I made these into cupcakes so I obviously adjusted the baking time. Honestly, my family and I all thought they were just perfect.

This is the bes carrot cake i've tried. I made this for the people at my work and everyone just loved it! I got so many people tell me that they hated carrot cake untill they tried the one I made them. I added alittle extra cinnamon  but left everything else the same. I highly recomend this recipe to anyone.

This cake, as is, is deliciously beautiful. I only made the following changes:  1/2 cup white sugar & 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 cups of grated carrots vs 3 cups  I found that the cake was a TEENY bit dry. Other than that, the cake, spices, frosting complement beautifully. I will make it again!!!

Absolute favorite carrot cake recipe. Like many others I adjust the recipe by using half white/half brown sugar (mellows the sweetness a tad), replaced 1/2 cup oil with applesauce (reduces the fat), and added nutmeg (balances the cinnamon-carrot flavor nicely). And I prefer a smooth frosting, so I leave the pecans out (they still come through in the cake itself, where I use finely diced pecans). But even without these changes the recipe stands as a delicious, moist, classic carrot cake (hence the 5-star rating). Make it a day ahead, because it only gets better with age.

Nothing spectacular.  Just a basic spice cake.  Doesn't warrant 5 stars by any means.  It's ok, but I've had better.

I made this cake for my family. They all loved it and we usually don't like carrot cake. We fought over the last piece :)

I made this cake twice in the past month. One for my family and the other for my family and work place. We all love it so much. Thanks Tammy, & no changes needed at all.

This cake is really good! Maybe could have been a little more moist (I cooked it for 40 min). I didn't change anything about the recipe, so I'm rating the actual recipe, and not my rendition of it :) I'll make it again, perhaps using some of the other reviewer's revisions.

This was really good. All of the pecans made me think of a banana nut bread, but it was tasty. I was glad to find a recipe for "carrot" cake and not a cake with carrot and pineapple. Thank you for a great recipe - definitely a keeper.

Excellent and amazingly moist without being oily!  I used unsweetened applesauce for nearly half the oil and half white, half brown sugar and added some nutmeg and an 8oz can of crushed pineapple drained and dried on paper towels. Baked about 35 minutes in 2 round pans.

Very good, moist and nutty.  I may try adding raisins next time for an additional texture in the cake.  ALso try some nutmeg in along with the cinnamon for more spice flavor

First time i tried it it was a mess because I measured wrong the baking powder and the cake ended up all over the oven... however, what stayed in the pan was great.... 2 days after this my husband was begging for more!!!! :)  I made two changes.  1) brown sugar instead of white sugar 2) more cinnamon!  it was absolutely delicious!!!!

mmmm so good.  I halved the recipe and made cupcakes 12 of them for 30 minutes.  Also, I didn't have any oil so I melted half butter and used the other half applesauce.

I made cupcakes with this recipe, took them to work and everyone loved them.  The only thing I had to change was the oven temperature, 25 degrees less, so that they wouldn't continue getting a little burnt on the bottom.  They only reason I didn't give it five stars, is because only  my sister's recipe is worth five stars.  I will be making this again.

My family loved this carrot cake. It was my first homemade carrot cake I've made and everyone loved it. The only thing that I did different was I cut the frosting recipe in half. The very first time I made it I had a ton of the frosting left over. But other than that the recipe is perfect!!

It was good, kind of light on flavor.  I added a bit of nutmeg and allspice which gave it more taste.

I liked this recipe.   I did tweak the recipe a little by adding 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. The frosting on the other hand wasn't too good I need to find a better recipe for that.

I made this as sugar-free muffins and also as written.  The sugar-free version was pretty good.  I substituted Splenda for sugar in baking the cake recipe and in the frosting.  Add 1/2 extra tsp baking soda and 1-2 tablespoons honey to the cake batter to compensate for the Splenda.  Was pleased with how it came out for a sugar-free recipe.  For muffins I baked about 20 minutes and that did the trick.  The regular (with sugar / as written) recipe I think was just average.  It was a good cake, but as others have written VERY VERY VERY bland.   I doubled the cinnamon called for and added nutmeg and the cake had very little flavor.  I was very disappointed in the lack of taste compared to the version I'm used to (my mom's recipe).   The icing is great.  I think it's just your basic cream cheese frosting recipe.  It really helps "doll up" the cake (which is so bland I couldn't really eat it without a lot of icing).   Also the amount of oil called for is WAAAAAAAY too much for this cake.  It was very moist - almost too much so.   I put it in a cake plate with a paper towel under it and within minutes the paper towel was soaked in oil.

I can only give this 3 stars because I changed the recipe slightly...I added 1 cup of purred pumpkin  and 1/4 cup apple sauce in place of the oil.  I did not have any cinnamon but used 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  They were awesome, moist an flavorful!

I am not one to use people receipes being from the caribbean we like flavourful food and scrumptious deserts. My boyfriends favorite thing is carrot cake and I was looking for an easy recipe that I hoped would be great (cause I am not a cook or baker) and this receipe was all of that easy and great....I scored big points for this so thank you Ms. Elliot great recipe.... One more thing I added a little bit of raisins cause besides pleasing him I wanted to please my sweet tooth and it still was great......Kudos to you Tammy....

I made this yesterday using the recommendations of 3/4 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, extra teaspoon of vanilla and cinnamon, added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg, and only used 3.5 cups of powdered sugar. The cake is incredibly moist and delicious. The frosting was a little on the sweet side, I will probably only use 3 cups of powdered sugar next time.   LOVED IT!!!

An amazing recipe! This was the first time I tried making carrot cake, and it was wonderful. My friends, who are also big carrot cake fans absolutely loved this cake. As some others here have suggested - instead of 1 1/4 cups oil, I used 1/2 cup oil & a can of drained crushed pineapple. I also used 2 cups of confectioners sugar instead of 4 (and it was still a bit two sweet for my taste!)

It was my first carrot cake I've made and it was wonderful. But next time I will definitely use less sugar powder, because frosting was too sweet for me though I used 1,5 cup white sugar for the cake.

GREAT recipe! Only used three cups of the sugar in the icing and it was definitely sweet enough! Yum!

Made a 2 layer cake with this recipe and it turned out wonderful. I did follow some other reviewers changes with the brown sugar and substituting some of the oil. I also left out the raisins only because of personal preference. I will definitely be making this again as it has been requested by my coworkers.

I felt this cake was heavy and dense. I would have preferred a light and airy cake. Though I should never expect a carrot cake to be light and airy, it was way to heavy for an enjoyable cake.

I can't even begin to tell you how incredible this cake is!! I made one yesterday for a birthday party and it was a good thing that I double the recipe because there were no leftovers. I did add a can of pineapple and raisins and I finely grated the carrots.

The taste of the cake was great but it did fall in the center. The icing was a little too sweet for me.

I made this for a family which have various members disliking chocolate, banana, mango, durian, raisins, pineapples and such, resulting in extremely limited cake choices during birthdays.  Followed the recipe except for a few changes due to lack of ingredients: used all brown sugar (no white at home), omitted cinnamon and used almonds instead of pecans (can't find them in the store), and used self-raising flour instead of plain flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt (cos that's what's left at home)  Halved the recipe and made an 8-inch round cake plus 2 cupcakes for trying. The cupcakes turned out perfect, but I overbaked the main cake so that was a little dry - no fault to the recipe, it was the chef... Everyone raved about the frosting. This recipe is definitely a keeper for my troublesome family!

I made this for my boss for his birthday, and everyone in the office was raving about how great it was! Grating the carrots and chopping the pecans by hand was the most time consuming. I will use the food processor next time:) Otherwise, it is a very simple recipe to follow that is DELICIOUS!

I tried this recipe 2 weeks ago, with the frosting and without. Without the frosting the cake is just OK, but the frosting really makes it WOW! (I thought the 4 cups of sugar to be too much, and only used half the amount)  Frosting aside, I still found the cake too oily, and not spicy enough for me. It also lacked a strong carrot taste.  Despite all else my husband, coworkers and everyone else loved it.  Will definitely make it again, with apple sauce as suggested and more cinnamon and nutmeg.

Excellent carrot cake.  I did follow others suggestions and add more cinnamon and nutmeg.  Perfectly moist and soft.  Flavor got even better the second day.  Didn't last longer than that.

I made this into cupcakes, HUGE hit!! Everyone loved the taste and moistness.  My only issue was what many reviewers have said about the frosting, way too sweet as is, I kept adding more cream cheese to balance it out, I'd say start with just 1 cup of sugar and add more to your taste.

This cake is amazing! Every time I make it people can't just get over how delicious it is!  I use whole wheat flour and also add some ground cloves to it.  Instead of using oil all the way I use one cup of apple sauce and some oil for balance.  I will always use this recipe!!!

Perfect.  I love the pineapple versions of carrot cake, but was looking for a lighter, more traditional version.  This recipe did not disappoint!  The flavors are balanced and the texture is great!  I will be using this as my staple carrot cake from now on.  Thank you for sharing!

I have never done any baking before so I was taking a huge risk offering to bake a cake for a party. I chose this because it looked like the simplest of all the recipes I compared it to. I used walnuts instead of pecans but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was a hit! Moist and delicious. And it really was very easy to make. If you are new to baking: all those changes other people made to the recipe are not neccessary! It's great just as it is.

Delicious! I've made this twice, the first time, I used someone's suggestion to used applesauce instead of half of the oil, it turned out just a little flat, wasn't sure why, but still good. The second time, I only needed a small cake, so I halved the recipe (used all ingredients as written), and used a small round springform pan. It turned out wonderful!  I used the original amount of frosting though, and put a layer of frosting in the middle of the cake as well... I also mixed in walnuts and raisins into the frosting, YUM!

I halved the amount of sugar used in the icing since it allows the flavor of the cream cheese to be more prominent. Also, I added an extra cup of grated carrots to the cake for added texture.

Wonderful frosting, I did do some mods so am giving it only 4 starts as I decreased the sugar and went with 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg otherwise this one is a keeper! If making a layer cake I would double the frosting recipe as it would not be enough.

Oh my gosh!!! The best carrot cake I have ever eaten. I will always use this recipe! I would give it 10 stars. I did add 1 cup of rasins, but that is the only change I made to the recipe. I did make it in 2 9inch cake pans and layerd it. So yummy!!

When I made this carrot cake with all the adjustments from below... divine! No other way to put it. The best cake I have ever had. I also made them into big cupcakes which were a huge hit with my guests!

Awesome! the recipe as it is with absolutely no changes. My husband loved it and my daughter had almost 1/3 of it in a day. Made it again for a lunch gathering with some relatives and they loved it. Its very easy to make.

We tried this recipe in a dutch oven and baked it outside on our patio! This was an experiment for us, and now we plan to use it when we go camping. Not only was it delicious and a success, I must add that it rose nicely in the pan, almost double. It smelled absolutely wonderful while it was cooking outside, (our neighbors informed us)  I have no doubts that when we go camping, the whole campground will be able to smell it baking... Instead of the traditional frosting, we were content to sprinkle it with powdered sugar (to be more compatible for  when we are camping).  Also, this recipe was easy enough that my 11 year old son put it together. He did add a bit of fresh ground nutmeg to it, and a handful of golden raisins. Dutch Oven approved by a mother of 6.  Thanks!

This cake was very good and very moist. I did make some of the modifications other reviewers suggested such as substituting some of the oil for apple sauce and adding crushed pineapple.

lovely cake - I made it using some of the reviewers suggestions - I used 1 1/2 cups brown sugar - no white and added a well drained and squeezed tin of crushed pineapple, I also used much less oil. The result is gorgeous - very moist, plenty of sweetness despite halving the sugar, and I cannot wait to share the result with my friends tonight - thank you :o)[edit]my friends absolutely adored this cake - all that was left to offer my 3 hungry children was a small wedge. You couldn't find a nicer carrot cake recipe anywhere

For a lower calorie version I used 1/2 cup sugar, 1/2 cup baking splenda, 1/2 cup vegetable oil, 5 tbsp margarine, 8 oz low-fat cream cheese, and 2 1/2 cup powdered sugar. Make sure to bake less time (

DELICIOUS AND MOIST! I made this recipe for my son's first birthday.  We had 30 people so I made 60 portions (3 times the recipe - a triple 9x13 with a bunny drawn on top) and 4 times the icing as I also used it for decorating.  Their was plenty left over so I put aluminum foil on the table for anyone who wanted to take some home. People were like bees around a honey comb!! You will not be sorry!

Made for husband's 40th Bday, so opted to make it healthy... used 1/2 cup brown sugar and about 1/3 c granulated sugar.  Used 1/2 cup whole wheat pastry and 1/2 c AP flour and used applesauce for all the oil. Came out moist and delicious... On the frosting only used 1 cup powdered sugar since we don't like things too sweet.  IT WAS DELICIOUS!  WILL  DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN! BTW, hubby LOVED it!

Not amazing!  Tastes like your basic spice cake, it is really lacking in the flavor department.  The frosting was okay if you like the taste of powdered sugar A LOT.  I wouldn't make this again.

This came out amazing. I am not really that big on carrot cake but this may be one of the best cakes I've had. Took it to an easter dinner. It was a huge hit. I pureed the carrots in my blender which made the cake incredibly smooth. Also I made the frosting in my blender and blended in the pecans so the frosting would be completely smooth. DELICIOUS!!!

Used some of the other suggestions:  - 1 C brown, 1 C white sugar - 14oz can of crushed pineapple (drained) - 1 extra tsp cinnamon - applesauce instead of oil - 1 C coconut - 1 C raisins - frosting - 3.5 C icing sugar - grated carrots with cheese grater  Fantastic cake! I got tons of compliments on it. Will definitely make again.

Wonderful recipe. I just finished baking this carrot cake (see my profile picture for final product). I did, however, bake this cake in two 9' cake pans. The cooking time ended up being 34 minutes. The Pam cooking spray with flour worked wonderfully and this cake did not stick at all! Thanks so much!

I made this cake just like the recipe. I thought it was good but my boyfriend said it didn't taste "carroty" enough. I also thought the cream cheese icing tasted like butter, not icing. I might make the cake again but not the icing.

The cake was very good but it did not come out as a thick cake, My family thought it was too thin. It seems to have too much oil. I did use the right size pan and did what other viewers suggested and it still caved in the middle. Next time I will use less oil and maybe double the bath to see if it will be a thicker cake. Over all it was very good and tasty.

I made this carrot cake before and it wasn't the best I ever had.  The best would be by Emeril, "Gigi's Carrot Cake".  If you aren't happy with this one, try Emerils under that title.

This is  a wonderful cake, moist and simple to make.  I have a friend that donates carrots to us for our dog, ( dog eats carrots as a daily treat).  It was her birthday and I decided to thank her from our dog and make her a carrot cake! Since I did not have a carrot cake pan, I got a template off the inter-net of a carrot and just traced around the carrot and dyed the frosting green for the top and  orange for the  bottom.  Everyone got a chuckle out of this and were really impressed with flavor and moistness of this cake. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone!

Works well with 1/2 C sugar and 1-1/2 C spenda in the batter. I also recommend finely grating the carrots. This recipe makes a delicious moist cake. My coworkers (even the ones who "hate" carrot cake) obliterated it in no time!

Excellent recipe!  It got devoured at a party I went to even though there were many other desserts.  I used Whipped Cream Cheese frosting from this site.  I also substiuted 1 cup brown sugar for white, only 1 tsp vanilla, half oil/half applesauce and added pineapple.  I didn't drain the pineapple good enough, so it took extra long to bake.  Delcious!  Thanks for sharing.

WONDERFUL! I think next time I will use less powderd sugar in the frosting as we thought it was a bit too sweet.. I will leave the pecans out of the frosting also, was a pain in the butt to spread it around...  I may try it with rasins next time also.. but overall it was awesome just the way it was

I made this cake for my mom's birthday and my whole family loved it. Even my sister who doesn't like cream cheese icing ate it. Its' not too cream cheesy. I did use the large grater side and thought as I was mixing that they looked big, but they shrink after cooking. Other than that made exactly as written.

What a yummy yummy cake! It was my first ever carrot cake. I dared a couple changes to make it super healty and dietary: used only wholemeal flower and brown sugar, and substituted the oil for apple pulp. It didn't rise as much as it probably could have with white flower, but it was perfectly moist and not overly sweet. Definitely a keeper! Thanks Tammy.

This cake was a hit. I made it for a co-worker's birthday and everyone at work loved it. It was my first time ever making a carrot cake so I was a bit nervous but all of the reviews convinced me. I used 3/4 cup vegetable oil and 1/2 cup applesauce; 1/4 tsp nutmeg; 3 tsp vanilla; 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar. I left out the pecans and put them on the side as an option for those who wanted them. I also used Cream Cheese Frosting II. The cake was incredibley moist and sooo good. I will definitely be making this cake again. Thanks!!!

This is a delicious cake. It is moist and has a fairly rich taste. The topping is very tasty. We have made it with walnuts instead of pecans and don't notice much difference.

I have been looking for a carrot cake recipe for a long time and have always been nervous of all the oil and sugar but I made some adjustments and WOW, it was barely out of the oven and I already had it cut to try it out.  Super yummy and it doensn't even have the icing on it yet.  I made 2 changes.  I cut the oil down to 3/4 cup and 1/2 cup applesauce and decreased the sugar to 1 1/2 cups.  turned out perfect.  this will go into my recipe box to make again and again.  Thanks

Very nice. I made the changes in the comments. I also didn't have enough all purpose flour so I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat and some bread flour. It worked just fine.

Very moist and delicious!  I omitted the nuts, because these were for my daughter's friends and some have nut allergies.  I also cut the oil down to 3/4 cup.  I didn't add anything to make up for it.  And, I used 3/4 cup natural cane sugar and 3/4 brown sugar instead of the 2 cups white.  I used 1 Tablespoon vanilla instead of 2 teaspoons.  I made 2 dozen cupcakes instead of a full size cake.  The cakes were plenty sweet and moist even after I reduced the oil and sugar.  I made the icing (save the pecans) according to recipe, and it was very sweet, so I used it sparingly and the cupcakes came out just wonderfully!

Awesome!! This was my first try at carrot cake and it turned out fabulous.  My family loved it, even the non-carrot cake eaters.  I used my small food processor to shred the carrots which was quick and easy.  I did half white, half brown sugar as others suggested.  I did add about 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of nutmeg but may leave it out next time.  It was just a tad strong for me, though no one else noticed.  The frosting was a perfect complement with creamy sweetness.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I think this is a great recipe especially because you can tweak the sugar and flour to your dietary needs, but still, as is, it is fantastic and I highly recommend you trying it.

Outstanding! I needed something for a group of people, so I baked it in a sheet pan for 23 minutes and drizzled the frosting over it using a plastic bag. Fantastic recipe just as it is. Thanks so much!!

It tasted great, but too much oil. I had to wipe my hands and the table from the oil marks. I will opt to make it with applesauce and less oil next time.

Simply outstanding.  I made mine in a rabbit cake pan for a little Easter treat.  Definitely will make it again and again with these modifications: used unrefined sugar instead of white, added more cinnamon, no pecans for either the cake or the icing, and used significantly less sugar in icing (cake is perfectly sweet as it is).

OMG! I made this for our Easter Sunday gathering. So glad I used this recipe! I got so many compliments on this! I made 2 cakes, one with nuts and one without. My personal preference was the one without nuts, but both equally got rave reviews. I used a different cream cheese frosting other than the one listed here, so I can't rate that. Great recipe! This is my new go to carrot cake recipe!! YUM!

I made this recipe just as it was written and brought it to an Easter brunch.  Eveyone loved it - kids and adults.  I will definitely make it again.  Next time I may opt to decrease the powered sugar by 1 cup and omit the pecans in the frosting.

Used recipe as-is, plus just a little ginger paste and cardamom for flavor in the batter.  Added lemon and orange zest to frosting.  Didn't feel this warranted a whole new recipe on here, but the little bits of spice added nice complexity to a wonderfully textured and moist cake.  Thanks for sharing recipe!

Awesome cake!!!  If I could give it 10 stars I would....Made a few changes though.  I substituted 3/4 cup of oil with applesauce, changed to 3 tablespoons of cinnamon, added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg and 1/2 teaspoon of ginger, substituted 1/2 of the white sugar with brown sugar and added raisins. For the cream cheese frosting I only added 2 1/2 cups of the sugar and added 2 tablespoons of heavy cream.  While the cake was cooling I had the frosting cooling in the freezer.  It gave it the perfect consistancy for spreading.  This will definately be my one and only Carrot Cake I will ever do...Thank you for sharing!!!

This was a great dessert for an Easter dinner.  The pan quickly disappeared even though the word "carrot" is in the title.  Was a fast recipe to prepare, took the suggestions and carefully mixed it as to not overdo it.  Could have used some raisins for texture. But otherwise excellent.

This was a raved about cake, I did use olive oil and applesauce, did add the pineapple, brown and white sugar, as suggested by other reviewers and this cake was very moist and tasty. Thanks Tammy!

I cut this down to 6 servings for a small dinner party but followed the directions and ingredients to the T.  It turned out perfectly!!  We are not cake eaters, but we all love carrot cake and this was definitely top notch.

Thank you for your recipe! This cake was simple to make and tastes great! I do have to say, I put it into the fridge because I live in a hot climate and it actually tasted better cold! The icing makes nearly enough for 2 cakes so next time I make this I will halve the recipe. I did make a few changes, adding more cinnamon, some fresh ground nutmeg and 1/4 cup less flour. I also used a mix of walnuts and hazelnuts. Five stars for this cake though....excellent!!!

Nice cake, but needs double the spice, and half the amount of sugar.   Apart from this I followed the recipe. I would recommend a smaller tin, as I believe a carrot cake should be deeper.  Not bad but not great either, sorry!

Wow this was a moist cake, maybe to moist. We all enjoyed the flavor but it fell apart on the plate. Don't try to make a 2 layer cake there is to much batter, make a 3 layer cake instead of the sheet cake. I was surprised to see how 3 cups of shredded carrots worked in this cake. I may make again using a little less. But overall the cake was good.

I made this for a family Easter dinner. This is my husband's favorite cake. We changed the frosting to the type of frosting you put on a german chocolate cake. Got that recipe from this site too (it didn't turn out-was really runny, never thickened, so I poked holes all over the cake and poured the topping on-this way the liquid was absorbed by the cake) this turned out fabulous

I really really liked this carrot cake, and I am picky about my carrot cake.  It seemed like a lot of carrots when I dumped them it, but it turned out great.  Also, rather than grating them I just threw them in the food processor which saved tons of time!

I am just learning how to cook and bake on my own, and I love carrot cake. I was always put off by other carrot cake recipes because they looked very complicated, lots of ingredients, and I was not sure they'd end up being moist. This recipe was so easy to follow, I just substituted pecans with walnuts and it turned out great!  Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make it again!

I didn't add nuts because I didn't have any on hand and I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar (brown sugar and spice cake just GO together). My mom came over during the mixing process and tossed in another shake or so of cinnamon and a good shake of allspice, since she insisted it wasn't spice cake with just cinnamon, and it was delicious! I really don't think you need to use less confectioner's sugar in the frosting like some people in their reviews said. I thought it was perfect just like the recipe says.

I baked this for our Easter dinner and I have to say that the cake itself is excellent. I also substituted 1 of the cups of sugar with brown sugar. The only thing that I think can be improved upon is the frosting. I love cream cheese frosting but this one is way too sweet. This is my all time favorite that you might want to try it instead: 1 8 oz cream cheese, 2 teas. butter creamed together. Add: 1 teas. vanilla, 1 1/2 cups  powdered sugar, 1/2 c chopped pecans.

Super delicious! I do agree that you should use half white sugar and half brown sugar, and add one more tsp of cinnamon and vanilla. I did not use nuts in the icing due to the amount of nuts in the cake. My husband loves carrot cake, and this is his new favorite!

I followed this recipe exactly because I've never made a carrot cake.  I took it to Easter dinner and everyone seemed to like it.  I enjoyed it although it tasted very sweet to me.  I think the pieces were cut too large for how sweet the cake was.  I would definitely make it again, however, I think I might try a different cream cheese frosting recipe that wasn't quite as sweet.

I haven't eaten many carrot cakes in my life, but I have eaten a lot of cakes, and as far as cakes go, this one was pretty tough and chewy. The frosting on top though was PERFECT. I'll be keeping this recipe just for the frosting.

Rather disappointing after all the rave reviews. There was no distinct carrot flavor as the cinnamon overpowered the cake. It tastes more like a spiced cake than carrot cake.

This carrot cake recipe tasted great, but like some users I had issues with the center of the cake sinking. I followed other users' suggestion on making sure the temp was right and not beating the mixture too much but it still sank in the middle. Luckily I was able to even the layers out with the frosting.

What else can you say besides 'perfection'. I did about half oil half applesauce. I also doubled the frosting, it was loaded up, definitely a lot, but there's no such thing as too much frosting in my world!

Cut recipe in half (8x8) and followed instructions as written except added a dash of nutmeg.  Excellent results! Moist and tastes great!

I am very perticular about my carrot cake due to it being my favorite cake. I don't like pineapple in it and I don't like a spice cake. This was exactly what I wanted! Perfect!!!! I agree that you shouldn't change a recipe a ton and then review it, with that said I did substitute apple sauce for the oil, only because I have to watch my calories, and I made the frosting dairy free-Tofu cream cheese and shortening instead of butter (I have a dairy allergy). I wish I could have it as is, but I did have to change it for my dietary needs. IT WAS GREAT-Thank you!

This was the best carrot cake ive ever had! After reading a few pages of reviews i did change the recipe to 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and added 2 more tsps of cinnamon. The first time i used this recipe the cake tasted of nothing but oil. so the second i made it i used 3/4 cup oil and 3/4 cup milk. it came out more moist and flavorful than the first time. i also used the recipe cream cheese frosting II from this website. Would recommend this recipe for sure!

A very flavorful cake that my family enjoyed so much it was gone in only a few hours. I changed a few things to fit my taste which turned into a great success. I used a mixture of white flour and unbleached wheat flour, used 3/4 C. brown sugar and 3/4 C. white sugar, and added 1/2 C milk. I took the suggestion of using 3 tsp. cinnamon from one of the other reviews and lastly I used pine nuts instead of pecans.

I made this yesterday for Easter weekend.  It was wonderful.  Very moist and tasty.  I didn't have enough carrots, so I added cranberries to make up the difference (probably 1 1/2 cups.  I also didn't have pecans, so I used hazelnuts.

Awesome.  Nothing but compliments on this one.  I made cupcakes and cooked for approx. 22 minutes per pan.  Used brown sugar and white sugar in equal parts.  Used 1/4 cup vegetable oil and 1 c. cinnamon flavored applesauce.  Kept full amount of cinnamon (even a lil extra).  Frosting was perfect!

I made this several days ago, and let me tell you... I will NEVER make another carrot cake box mix EVER AGAIN!!! This recipe is just wonderful.. I only made one change: I swapped half of the white sugar for brown sugar. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Its been a couple days now, and whats left (which isn't much, this was a HUGE hit) is still moist, and yummy... didn't dry out or anything. I'm DEF saving this for future reference. Thanks Tammy for completely changing the way my family sees carrot cake!!!

very, very good.  i usually cut the oil back a little, by maybe 4 tablespoons.    the batch is big so i always make an extra cake for my husband to take into work.  we live abroad and they think it's INSANE to eat a cake made of carrots, so he calls it "California Cake" (after my homeland!) and they devour it.

Amazing recipe.  I was looking for a recipe for carrot cake that was moist and tasty without using pineapples as we don't like the fruit.  I hit the jackpot with this recipe!  I have now baked this cake for both my husband and my baby's birthdays.   For my 1 year old's birthday, I baked this as a 2 layer round cake and garnished with sweetened shredded coconut and silver balls.  So pretty and yummy!  We didn't have a scrap left!  (picture attached)  I prefer it spicier so I add 1/4 tsp cloves and substitute brown sugar for the white to add depth to the flavour.  This is now my go-to cake for entertaining.

I'm not much of a carrot cake fan, but this was delicious.  Even though I messed up and used the wrong measuring spoon for the baking powder (tbs insted of tsp).  It was gone in almost 24 hours.  My husband and kids have been bugging me to make another.  Can't wait to try it without the screwup.

SOOOO good!!! I chose this because it didn't have pineapple, and was not disappointed! It was moist  and delicious, even though I sadly didn't have any pecans on hand. I followed other recommendations of 1c white sugar 1c brown and a dash of nutmeg. Also, I had to use frozen carrots, which were very soggy when they went in, but happily made them kind of disappear in the cake (DH HATES the texture of the carrot strands, but couldn't even notice them here and LOVED the cake, so maybe try that if you have family who doesn't like the carroty-ness of cake) *EDIT: Made again with pecans - even better!!!

Loved this and made it to take to a potluck but ended up eating it all ourselves and skipped the potluck.  Changes made: Used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil.  Used freshly ground wheat flour and omitted the pecans.  It was very dark due to my changes but tasted wonderful.

This is the best carrot cake ever, I made it for a friend's reunion and got an overwhelming ovation! Definitely one of my new favorites. Didn't add the walnuts and it wasn't noticed. Just a wonderful recipe!

Amazing and easy to make. I cut out 1/4 cup of oil and added a small amount of crushed pineapple. Yum! I also made them into cupcakes and they turned out great. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a fab recipe!  the only thing I did was add extra spices, pressed some pinabble to get extra juice out and added that, while leaving the nuts out (we don't care for nuts in our food) but it was great and easy

It's very good but I would use a little less sugar on the frosting. I cook for a lioving and I bring a lot of my dishes the restuarant with me. Everyone raved about it, and also agreed a little less sugar to the frosting. It was still amazingly good.

I've made this cake three times.  All three the cake turned out wonderful (as written).  One time my icing was a bit watery but was probably my doing.  5 star recipe as written!

I used on cup of brown sugar and one cup of sugar instead of 2 cups white sugar - turned out very well and I think helped keep the cake more moist.   Absolutely delicious!

This is my absolute favorite carrot cake recipe! I've probably made it half a dozen times with only tiny alterations, instead of pecans I use walnuts and probably more like 1 1/2 cups, and when I put the batter into the cake pan (just before it goes into the oven) I sprinkle some extra cinnamon and sugar onto it, just for a little extra something. The icing for this recipe is to die for! I always have a little left over, which is fine by me! I've also used the icing on sugar cookies!

I liked this recipe, I pretty much followed it exactly but I left out the pecans from the icing and baked the cake in a heart shaped pan.  I had to bake the cake for about an hour, the cake browned much too quickly, about 25 mins into baking though the batter was still not wobbly and not cooked, so I turned down the oven to 175C and covered the cake with foil.  It's a nice cake, but I might try adding orange zest to it, it was missing something. The frosting is a bit too rich and sweet, so next time around, I'll reduce both the butter and sugar.

Delicious and easy to come together.  Added grated orange rind and !/4 cup orange juice. Only used 1 cup of oil and it was still very moist.  Also used half brown and half with sugar.

READ BEFORE MAKING i made the recipe just like it said but when i flipped it after ten minutes it came out in many pieces, i did a bit of research on it it and found out that  if you put parchment paper at the bottum before putting the batter in the pan  and leave it much longer it should come out clean  and the flavor was great!! i will try this one again

This was so good! I made it today for a co-worker's birthday and EVERYBODY loved it! I will definitely make it again.  I followed a few of the changes suggested by others (like adding pineapple and using less pecans) and it turned out perfect. Thanks so much!!

Best carrot cake ever BAR NONE! The only change I made was to dry out the carrots with paper towel to make the cake drier (as in other tips via reviewers comments) and I only used 2 cups confectioners icing and it was still amazing. thanks for an awesome recipe!!

I did use some review suggestions, I added a small can of very well drained crushed pineapple, used half white/half brown sugar and substituted 1/2 cup of oil with applesause. also cooked in two 9in. rounds for a round layer cake.  also, I was short on time, so i took a bag of matchstick carrots and chopped across twice or so instead of grating 3 cups.  it turned out perfectly.  also, the icing came out great and was easy to make, but it didn't taste remarkably different from the canned icing so I think you could interchange if in a rush.

Wonderfully moist and scrumptious! Thank you for sharing this terrific recipe!! I love that my 3 yr old got a good serving of carrots and nuts with it without even knowing. Like a lot of readers, I did do 1 c brown sugar and 1 c white sugar, 1/4 c unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 c oil. If you're looking to reduce sugar in your diet, don't be afraid to cut the sugar. I mean, it's delicious with 2 cups of sugar, but it's sweet enough that it won't be bland with less than 2c. Finally, I probably put 4 cups of grated carrot. My cake did sag a little in the middle after coming out of the oven, but I put that down to a baking error on my part (not sure what), not this excellent recipe!

Great recipe! I made this for my daughter's first birthday and was a hit with the little ones and the adults :) I omitted the nuts. Fantastic and icing was perfect!

Made this incorporating the following change: reduced oil to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup of applesauce; used 1 cup white, one cup light brown sugar. This cake was very light in texture, and the taste was perfect. RAVE reviews from friends. It's a keeper.

Very nice simple recipe. But way too sweet for me. think about reducing the sugar a bit especially with the frosting, could have used 380grams instead of 480gs. The cream cheese taste totally obscured by the sugar. Otherwise great.

I chose this because of all the excellent reviews and made it sans changes, however my husband did not even finish his piece because it was too bland. He said there was no point to eating it. Next time, I will use some of the suggestions. So I am rating the recipe as it is written.

This carrot cake recipe is absolutely fantastic. I followed it exactly, no substitutions, and it turned out perfect. Made it for work and it was a huge hit. I try as much as possible to make a recipe as directed and then make changes the next time. I might try some suggestions by other reviewers like do half white sugar and half brown sugar; add nutmeg; replace some of the oil with applesauce. Anyway, this recipe is great as is ... a must for those who love carrot cakes.

I LOVE the flavor of the batter and it smells so good.  Unfortunately, when made according to original recipe, it was a sunken mess for me.  I live at a very high altitude and guess this is one of those recipes that may need some adjusting.  I will try again with some changes because the batter really is THAT good.  I hate to rate it low when all I want to do is give a heads up to others at high altitudes.  (I am assuming that it is altitude anyway!)

This review is for the cake only. I think that my baking powder might be stale. My cake didn't raise that high. It turned out a little flat. I added a little nutmeg, ginger and cloves and omitted the pecans. (Husband dosen't care for them.) I frosted this with a canned cream cheese frosting because that was all I had. I feel that did this cake a disservice. I'd like to try this recipe again with fresh baking powder and a real cream cheese frosting. Then, I will re-rate.

well my cake turned out alright. I've made better...I did everything to the T..Too greasy for my taste.The only thing I changed was I only had 1/4 cup of pecans for the cake part and 3 cups of  leftover carrots pulp from my Jack LALane jucier. For the frosting, I only had 4 oz cream cheese, 2 cps of conf. sugar, and  1 teaspoon vanilla. I added a dash of nutmeg and cinnamon in the frosting. Frosting was great. not over baring.My borfriend said it was ok. I will added half brown and 1/2 white sugar, shredded carrots and less oil.

FRIGGIN AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! We cooked this for 14,000 troops here in Iraq and it disapeared like it was a prop in a magic act. It was light and fluffy but still solid and thick perfect consitancy and sweetness factor was just enough. This is a keeper! The frosting was a perfect fit for it as well. Major applaus on this one Tammy!

Delicious!   Added a little bit of crushed pineapple and added walnuts to the frosting because I ran out of pecans, but otherwise made just as written.  Very tasty and VERY moist cake!  Excellent will be an addition to my recipe book!  Thank you!

Everyone that has tried this has asked for the recipe. This is a wonderful carrot cake!  The only change I made was to eliminate the pecans in the frosting.  It was fantastic!

This recipe is perfect just the way it is!! If you're looking for a good carrot cake recipe, you've found it! The cake is moist and the icing isn't too sweet. My only problem is the icing recipe makes a bit too much icing for my taste. Next time I'll cut the recipe down by 25%. Thanks for a great recipe!!

May I just say....YUM!  I completely agree with other reviewers that a recipe should be judged on its own merits and not on the changes you make.  Otherwise, the ratings don't make any sense.

I've used this recipe a few times now, and my family loves it!  Other than dark chocolate cake, carrot cake is my favorite and i think the recipe AS IS hits the spot perfectly!  It's moist and flavorful and it cures my cravings for sweets! I wouldn't change a thing!

Cake was very simple to make, the reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars was because of the changes I made as everyone suggested 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce. 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar. I baked this in 2 9" rounds. I found that I almost didnt have enough icing when using it in the layered cake. The cake was very moist and delicious. Not too sweet just the right balance. I had it baking for about 30 mins. It came out perfect. Thanks so much Tammy for submitting!

This makes an awesome cake! I did use the mix of brown & white sugar mentioned in other reviews. Plus, I added a cup golden raisins & an 8oz. can crushed pineapple, drained.

I've never made carrot cake before.  I had no problems with this recipe, I feel that it turned out well.  Everyone seemed to enjoy it, but I didn't get the over-the-top reviews.  I thought it was good.

This cake is absolutely delicious!!! After reading some of the other reviews I made the following changes: 1) 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, 2) 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 3) 3 tsp cinnamon, 4) 2/3 cp canola oil and 1/2 cp natural applesauce, 5) 12-15oz drained crushed pnieapple. I made the icing as the original recipe called for! I also omitted the nuts from the recipe, due to some allergies in the family. The cake was amazing and I received high praise from the family! I will make this again!!!

I liked this recipe but for some reason mine spilled over the top of the bundt pan.  It ended up being fine though and the taste was very good.

My first carrot cake from scratch and it was GOOOOD!  I subbed applesauce for some oil, added nutmeg and extra cinnamon to the mix and did not put nuts in the icing (only because I didn't want bumpy icing).  Everything else was the same and it came out perfect.  Will make again for sure!

I followed gneebeanie's suggested changes - but left out the nuts because some don't like them - and it's excellent. Everyone loves it. It's been my dessert for three Thanksgiving dinners and today's Christmas Eve dinner. I made it once without the pineapple and it wasn't quite as good.

Phenomenal cake!  I made it for a special supper and my family kept going back for “a sliver more” and it was gone by the next morning.  Definitely a keeper!

The carrot cake turned out quite well.  I made some modifications such as: reducing the oil to 3/4 cup and adding 1/4 cup yogurt.  The cake was really moist.  I also used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, which is just enough sweetness.  I would add 1/4 tsp nutmeg for a spicier & more improved flavor because I found that even though I added 3 tsp of vanilla extract and 3 tsp of ground cinnamon, it still seemed like something was missing.  I omitted the nuts too.  I'd make this cake again.  Btw, this recipe was enough to make 2 small bundt cakes.

2000+ rave reviews couldn't be wrong, right?  TRUE!  This is the best carrot cake I've ever made.  I did as others suggested and added a can of crushed pineapple and split the sugar into half white and half brown.  Also I made two 9-inch rounds, doubled the icing and made a two-layer cake topped with some toasted coconut.  Everyone couldn't believe it was not a fancy bakery cake.  Worth the effort to make from scratch for sure!

I don't like carrot cake...in fact, I can usually stand it.  Decided to make this for my husband and my father and I'm really impressed.  Not only did they love it...I did too.  Who knew?

I just made this today and it turned out very good.  I made 1/2 the recipe, used brown sugar instead of white and sprinkled the nuts on half because I can't eat them.  It was super soft and moist....but I gave it only 4 stars because I felt it lacked a bit in the flavour department.  I make a vegan carrot cake and that's packed with so much flavour.  This one is good but a little plain.  It leaves room for additions so that's good.  Maybe raisins, coconut, pineapple, nutmeg, etc.  I forgot to add that I didn't use any frosting because we prefer our cakes without.

I baked this as directed, substituting only walnuts for the pecans.  Best carrot cake I've ever eaten.  We cut into it the same day, and it was good, but after refrigerating overnight it was perfection. Next time (which will be soon), I'll cut back on the frosting by half to fit my family's preference.

Made this for Thanksgiving. While it was very easy and looked pretty, it was lacking in taste.  I guess that is why everyone is making all the substitutions.  I followed the directions exactly. IF I make it again, I would certainly use others suggestions.

The first time I made this, a year ago, I followed the recipe to a T, but the icing turned out extremely clumpy and gross. I still gave the recipe 5* since the cake is so good.

This second time, I followed the recipe, with the addition of 1/4 t of nutmeg. I baked it on 2 9" pans for 31 minutes at 350, rotating the pans half way through.

Again though the icing turned out crappy and clumpy. But I wasn't going to take it lying down, so I threw it out and looked up how to make cream cheese icing on youtube. The trick is you have to mix the butter and cream cheese and vanilla into a beautiful froth before you add any sugar. I put all but the sugar in the large stand mixer bowl, and after it was gorgeous I used a strainer and added the sugar a half cup at a time. It was amazing.

Now the frosting procedures are a new issue. I greased the pans, so the cake was really domed and I debated using a serrated knife to flatten it. But since the top is the best part I kept it, and it looks fine. My frosting job was good, but not gorgeous, and next time I'll def add more in the middle.

Delicious rating coming after Jade's graduation

Thank goodness for a recipe that doesn't call for pineapples or raisins, just carrots! I love this cake, I was a little wary that it wasn't going to be moist since I used the big side of the grater, but it came out perfect! I did everything as instructed, except that I didn't add pecans and I used 16 oz. of confectioners sugar (for some reason I thought it said 1 box of c. sugar lol) and I forgot to add the vanilla in the icing. This recipe is scrumptious! *Before changing anything to the recipe try it out first, because in the end you are rating your recipe not the one that was actually provided* Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This cake was delicious. I used safflower oil which is good for baking and a much lighter oil. I used 3 cups of sugar in the flosting, added 1/4 cup of sour cream and two tablespoons more butter to reduce the sweetness. The cake was very light and flavorable.

I had some problems with this cake, but I'm almost positive it was my own fault. My cakes sunk while they were in the oven, woops! I leveled them out and froze them, then I tried to torte them (I lost a layer because I din 't let the cake thaw long enough!). The edges were very hard and crispy, which also made it hard to torte. 3 layers survived and I made a double batch of the icing to frost and fill the entire cake. I let it chill, then took it to my Wilton class and decorated it with icing from a piping bag (little carrots). I took it to a family gathering for Thanksgiving and it was very well received. Perhaps if I had not felt so rushed and paid better attention, it wouldn't have given me so much trouble. Oh, and I give it 4 stars because I didn't care for the nuts in the cake, and I left them out of the icing.

excellent flavor and texture.  I did the 1/2 applesauce 1/2 oil substitution.  I also baked it as cupcakes (made 24)  20 minutes per tray at 350.  Everyone loved them!  Definite make again!

It was amazing! I went into it thinking it would be sort of dry, but it was moist and delicious. I halved the amount of confectioner's and added some milk because the frosting is really sweet, but otherwise perfection!

Simply delicious. So classic, so awesome. ALL of my friends have asked for the recipe and it's now in all permanently in their recipe books. Everyone swarms to this cake when i arrive at parties. I even made it for my 3-tiered wedding cake! My only suggestion is that I reduce the icing sugar in the frosting to 3 cups. Thanks Tammy!!

Made the frosting, not the cake. Good but a little too sweet, I would probably use 3 cups sugar next time rather than 4. Very easy to mix up.

Great recipe without changes. I think that a recipe should be reviewed for it's own merits with "minimal changes" Too many changes messes up the rating system

This is a great carrot cake recipe.  We followed it exactly with the added 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.  It did not come out oily as some reviewers have stated.  It came out moist and delicious.  We did not however, use the frosting recipe.  But thank you for sharing this fantastic carrot cake with AR!

I've made this recipe twice in two weeks! The first time, I made it exactly to specs, but felt guilty for eating half the cake myself. The second time, I used only 1 cup sugar, 1 cup oil and 1/4 cup milk. Still delicious! Even my picky toddlers who can detect vegetable molecules devour this.

I wish we could give stars by half steps instead of whole ones. I give this recipe 4.5 stars. I did add about a cup of crushed pineapple to help make it more moist (I cut the oil back to 1 C and will cut to about 3/4 C next time) and I substituted wheat flour for half of the all-purpose. I also added some ground ginger and a small amount of nutmeg to perk up the flavor. My husband the birthday boy loved this, as did everyone who tried it. Thanks for a delicious recipe! This one will stay in my permanent file.

5 star with changes. Used another reviewers tips: 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar. 3 teaspoons of vanilla, 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple drained, 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, 3 tsp of cinnamon, 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. I also added walnuts instead of pecans, and I added 1 cup of shredded coconut. I shredded carrots small, and they did not sink at all. I reduced powdered sugar to 3 cups and it came out perfect.

I'm really not a carrot cake fan, but my boyfriend is so I made this for his birthday. And wow! It's made me into a carrot cake convert. And it definitely pleased his pallette as well. I added a touch extra cinnamon and think it could've used even a little more, but it was great as-is!

Oh.  My.  Goodness.  Deserves a solid 5 star rating!  I added additional vanilla as suggested, but I disagree with all the comments to add pineapple.  The flavor was perfect without that additional tang, which would change it to a whole different cake in my opinion.  For those who don't like the pecans, try omitting them from the frosting.  The pecans add a depth to the cake and then NOT having them in the frosting makes a delightful contrast in texture.  Wonderful recipe -- thanks!!

I substituted a cup of brown sugar for a cup of white sugar.  It really made for a nice added flavour in the crust.  Thinking of maybe spreakling brown sugar chunk on top instead of icing.

This was the first carrot cake that I've ever made.  I used all of gneebeanie's suggestions and I left out the pecans.  I also frosted and filled it with my own cream cheese icing recipe. Everybody loved it and said it was one of the best carrot cakes they had ever had. They all took pieces home for later too.  Great recipe, definitely a keeper.

I followed the recipe exactly as written except, I didn't completely drain my pineapple . a week later. My family and neighbors are still raving about how wonderful it was. It is the best carrot cake recipe that I have ever made. I will make only this one from now on. I have found MY carrot cake recipe to pass on for generations to come

I decided to stick with the original recipe and directions. It came out Incredible. I'm amazed and grateful for the recipe, thank you!! I baked mine at 330ish degrees and was able to insert and pull out a clean toothpick after 32 minutes of baking. the carrot cake itself is nice and sweet and although the frosting may be a little too sweet for me, I just putted a light coating so that it was just right. Thank you very much for the recipe I will make it again and again!

VERY GOOD!  My whole family loved it!  I followed the recipe exactly for the cake.  I only used 3 cups of powdered sugar in the icing and it was wonderful!It is definately a keeper!

I made this one replacing apple sauce for 1/2 of the oil, as suggested on a previous review, and since I didn't have any butter on hand, I used cool whip on the frosting. It had a sweet but lighter taste. Also added an extra teaspoon of cinn.,vannila and one of nutmeg. It turned out great and not greasy. Thanks for all the suggestions....

i halved this recipe and I made 18 cupcakes out of it. I omitted the nuts (picky eaters) and added a little extra carrots (sneak them in when while i can). Was so good!! I could not stop eating them... I added the frosting as we ate them. I can not wait to try this recipe with some zucchini! thanks for sharing, will make this a lot!

I made this almost as written, though I put in a good bit of nutmeg (maybe a tsp). Baked in 2 9in pans for a layered cake and added a touch of amaretto in the frosting.   Many happy eaters couldn't stop eating this cake even after a very full meal.   Will definitely make this again.

This is now my favorite dessert, with mods of course. I used 1/2 white and 1/2 brown sugar. I added 1 c raisins. I could cut down on the raisins next time. I only put 1/8 cup on pecans in the frosting as the cake had enough nuts in it. I put the batter in 2 8 inch pans for 38 min. Beautiful layered cake.

Saying "Wow this one of the best cakes I have ever tried", would be a sure understatement. This was sooo delicious! So moist and rich and I make "my own version" of the cream cheese frosting and the combination of textures is too die for! Sooo good. And I don't feel TOO guilty eating it due to the fact that you put so much arm work into grating all of those carrots(:! I made two layers and in between layers and on top of the cake, I sprinkled glazed pecans and all I can say is "Yummo!"

I have made this recipe twice.  Once with all the changes suggested---added cinnamon, allspice, pineapple etc and it was very good but a bit too spiced for my tastes.    Then I made this recipe as written (o.k. I subbed apple sauce for oil) and I love it.  My kids love it and my Bunko group seemed happy.

This was a great recipe I made it almost exactly as what the recipe calls for and it came out very moist and yummy. It's very sweet and the only thing I changed was I used 3 cups of confectioner's sugar instead of 4. I still had a lot of icing left over. I think it would taste even better with raisins in it and if I was to cut back on the pecan's. I would use 1/2 cup of pecans in the cake mix plus 1/2 a cup of raisins and no pecans in the icing. This was a great recipe, make it and find out for yourself.

This cake was yummy. I used an already made frosting but will try the frosting in this recipe at a later date. It did sag in the middle much like other reviews but I was feeding it to boys who didn't seem to notice :)Overall, this cake was very moist and flavorful.

This was my first time making carrot cake and it was FANTASTIC! I took it to work and I had to hide it to ensure everyone in the office had a chance to sample it. I used applesauce instead of oil. I also used golden raisins and walnuts. I didnt think the frosting would be enough for 2 layers so I skimped with the frosting between both layers. But I eneded up having more than enough. My neighbor just had a baby I am going to make it for her family next week. Def a keeper! My employees are still raving about it and asking when I am going to make another. Thanks Tammy!

I loved this recipe.  I followed the advice about 3 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting and replacing some of the oil with applesauce.  It was really really moist and perfect, I thought it was wonderful.  It was my first made from scratch cake and it made me feel like I am a good baker.  I love that!

This is good basic recipe, but I followed the advice of others and used both brown and white sugars.  Also, I thought 1 1/4 cups of oil sounded like just too much, so I used 1 cup of applesauce and 1/4 cup of oil and since no one in my family likes walnuts, I just left them out.  Turned out very moist, not too sweet.

Yummy!  I made this a heart-healthy recipe using 4 egg whites, same amount applesauce rather than oil, splenda brown sugar blend (1 cup instead of 2 cups), nonfat cream cheese (two), and only 1/2 stick of light margarine.  Also cut the powdered sugar to 1.5 cups.  Substituted raisins for pecans.  Baked in 8 inch rounds for 30 minutes.  So moist and tasty, you would never know it is almost fat free and sugar free!  One of the best recipes!!!

My family loved this, but the reason I'm giving it only 4 stars is even though I cooked it for the min. cook time, it was still too long. I don't know if my oven is off or something, but 5 minutes less would have been perfect.

Amazing carrot cake.  We loved it.  I followed the consolidated advice of gneebeanie by adding 8 oz. crushed and drained pineapple.  I substituted 1 of the cups of white sugar with brown sugar. I also added nutmeg.  For the frosting I cut down on the powdered sugar (3.5 cups).  This is an amazing recipe as it is too.  Thanks for sharing!

This was not a favorite of mine. I thought from the reviews that it would be fantastic, but found it really quite bland and tasteless. My family all agreed. Have used much better recipes before. Will not make again.

Tammy Elliot you are awesome! THANKS!! If rebellious me can do it, it will be a piece of cake for you the reader. I hate following recipe, I did this time and it worked ... theN I alter it a bit and it worked too! I have just finished baking my fourth carrot cake since Saturday, August 29. I can't keep them  because people can't stop eating them.  I made a few alterations. I used only 100ml of sugar, less than one cup of canola oil, used one teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg in addition to cinnamon, I added half cup of raisins, half cup dried cranberries and I used one cup of walnuts.  I will suggest that you whip the oil and sugar very well first, then gradually add eggs and vanilla, whip very well again. Then gently mix wet and dry ingredients (by hand or by spatula). DO NOT OVERMIX. My cakes came out of the oven perfect after 50 minutes (I preheated the oven for 30 minutes, cranked the oven to 400F for the first 10 minutes of preheat and then 350F). I encourage everyone to try this healthy carrot cake recipe soon ...

MMM.. SO delicious.. When it came to the icing I cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups to give it more of a cream cheese flavor.

This cake is wonderful! I followed the recipe as is. The only change I made was that I reduced how much powdered sugar went into the frosting. I think the frosting is what makes this cake so good! I will definitely make this cake again.

Tastes great! But the frosting could use less powdered sugar, it's way too sweet.

EXCELLENT recipe!! I had never made a carrot cake, and I made this recipe for my husband's birthday because its his favorite. Let me tell you, it was delicious! Very dense and had great flavor. When I was preparing it, it seemed to have an awful lot of carrot in it, but it was just right. On the first bite my husband raved about it, and I agreed it was moister and tastier than any I've ever had. The only small modification was I uses about 3 cups of confectioner's sugar, because it was all I had left. It was great. I will make this again and again. But next time I'll wait til we have company because it made a ton of cake. I would highly recommend this recipe to everyone!

Loved this!  I was looking for a recipe that didn't call for pineapple and this fit the bill.  I did add 1/4 t. of nutmeg- just cause I love the flavor of it. It was delicious!  I couldn't stop eating it and I didn't even frost it.  I imagine with the cream cheese frosting I would have eaten the whole thing alone.

Fabulous! I upped the recipe by half so I could make a triple layer cake and it worked perfectly. (Baked all 3 at 350 for about 30 minutes) The only thing I changed was used half brown sugar, half white sugar, and added a 20 oz can of drained crushed pineapple because I LOVE pineapple in my carrot cake. This was a wonderful recipe.... the sweet icing was a nice compliment to the not too sweet cake.

great as written.  I always add a dash of pumpkin pie spice to baked goods with cinnamon, just my thing I like the spice.  1/2 the recipe in a 9x9 pan took 35 minutes.  Omited nuts, didnt have any.  I also let my carrot shreds sit on a papertowl to absorb the excess moisture since they were literally right out of the ground.  Very tasty will make again soon.

I made this into mini cupcakes to bring to a function and they turned out great. Cooking time was 18 minutes. The only changes i made were to use 1/2 applesauce for the oil and add a 8 oz. can of drained crushed pineapple. I was worried because the batter was very thin but the end result was a moist, delicious cupcake!

I used whole wheat flour instead of white. I also substituted half of the sugar for brown. I left it in the pan so I only needed half the icing to frost the top. Delicious!

A neighbor gave us a bag of fresh picked carrots and we had no idea what to do with so many. I wanted the recipe that used the most amount of carrots. Needless to say, we came across this recipe and the carrots are now gone! We made this cake about 4 times. A neighbor even requested this as a birthday cake, wich they loved! The cake itself came out very moist with a great texture. I did change the sugar for one cup of brown sugar and one cup of white sugar, i added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract, and omitted the pecans because i didn't have any in hand. This recipe is a keeper!

This was yummy!! I followed gneebeanie's changes, it turned out great. The only thing Ill do next time is add less sugar to the frosting. Maybe cut sugar in half. Was too sweet for my tastes. But my kids LOVED it.

I am a lover of carrot cake and I have never tried to bake one before.  However, tonight I made my second cake using this recipe.  Makes me feel like a pro!  The recipe is excellent.  I shared the first cake I made with my staff and they were extremely impressed.  Moist, colourful and tasty!  Incidentally, tonight I was short of carrot and used 2 cups instead of three.  While the result was good, with 3 cups the cake was much more moist and tastier I think.  Someone suggested that I should try brown sugar instead of white sugar.  Not sure about that ... I love the recipe as it is!  Thanks for sharing.  By the way, I am a male, 40+ years old and not a great cook or baker.  This recipe makes it seem so easy!

Simply the best carrot cake ever. I made this for a girl once - the night went well, to say the least. The best thing is, it's very easy to make and impossible to screw up! I cut the cake into generous slices and carefully stuffed them into freezer bags and I enjoyed perfect carrot cake for a couple weeks.

I took it work and one of my coworkers called me evil... the other one said "you know.. I could have eaten that whole cake!" I did what some of the other people did: 3 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 c canola, 3/4 c unsweetened applesauce, and I added raisins because I love them. I cheated and bought already shredded matchstick carrots and just cut most of them in 1/2.  I subbed neufatel cheese and low fat butter for the full fat versions in the icing.  My husband's coming home tonight from being out of town so I left 1/2 of it at home for him.  I hope I can control myself when I get home!

I don't make carrot cake often but I needed a good recipe for a friend's birthday cake. This one was awesome! I made 2 changes, for the cake I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar instead of all white sugar, and to the frosting I added 1/2 stick butter (I made it as written but it was too sweet for my taste; the extra butter did the trick). Wonderful!

So Yum! I used 1 cup white sugar/1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup all-purpose flour/1 cup whole wheat flour, and substituted unsweetened applesauce for all of the oil.  I also added raisins, and didn't make any frosting.  This cake is satisfyingly sweet and yummmy even without frosting.  My family loved it, and my dad requested that I bake this one again.

Absolutely amazing, however  1) using 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar 2) adding an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract 3) Added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg 5) added 1 extra teaspoon of cinnamon 6) used 3/4 cup canola oil and 1/2 cup applesauce. The result came out incredibly delicious - the cake was very flavorful and moist. I followed another reviewer's suggestion of grating the carrots with the large grater side (the one you use for cheese) so that you don't end up with a bunch of carrot mush and juice that can't be used.

I have never cared for carrot cake but my daughter loves it. I can honestly say this is one of the best recipes for carrot cake I have ever tried. I believe I am a lover of carrot cake now! I did shred the carrots instead of grate them, though. This recipe is a keeper! Thank you!!!

this was so good but found it was missing something that makes carrot cake actually taste like carrot cake:nutmeg! i added some and tasted a lot better it smelled so good but when i ate it it it tasted so eggy and oily but the flavor was so good but the egg and oil part was nasty. i dont know what happened but i will try it again someday.

This is prally the best cake I have ever made- although I'll admit I didn't like the sounds of white sugar and white flour, so I used a little less but brown sugar and an equal amount of all-purpose whole wheat. I was left with a still very moist cake that was a bit more filling, but I just made the pieces smaller. I also recommend using the "larger" side to the shredder for bigger chunks of carrot- I loved the result. Thank You Tammy!!

i gave this 4 stars just because i have another recipe that is much better, but this one is still great!  i used shredded carrots and would suggest chopping them up into smaller pieces.  instead of 1 1/4 cup vegetable oil, i used part oil and part applesauce.  i didnt add any pecans.  i think what made this recipe is actually the frosting, which makes it addictive.  cake was moist and very good.  thanks for the recipe!

Everyone in my family loved this cake! Even though adding pecans is optional, I highly suggest it. The pecans add wonderful texture to the cake and balance the sweetness of the frosting (you know what I mean...super sweet then the neutral taste of the pecans-perfect) I was so busy that I ended up using pre-made cheesecake frosting (the cheap store brand kind) and the cake was still excellent.  Next time I will make the frosting from scratch! THanks for the recipe...it's a keeper

I made this recipe very much like the original recipe except I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar and it turned out great. It was extremely moist and my family loved it. I did not find that it was too oily or sweet. I did make it as a layer cake using 2 nine inch pans. I will definitely make it again!

This carrot cake was awesome!  It was moist and wasn't too sweet.  I only made one change to the original recipe.  I, too, added 3/4 c of oil and 1/2 c of applesauce.  It was a big hit on Father's Day!

I LOVE carrot cake.  I have never made cake from scratch so I decided to venture out and make a carrot cake.  This recipe is to DIE for!!  Very rich and delicious!  The only addition that I made was to add 1 c. of golden raisins.  The icing is great.  After the cake had cooled, I split the 9 x 13 cake in half, and frosted the tops of both and put together to make a 2 layer carrot cake.  I will definitely be using this as my carrot cake recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe was pretty good and super easy.  The recipe called for putting the nuts in the frosting, but I just sprinkled them on top.  I made it in a 13x9 pan and it turned out fine.  It was pretty dense, but still good. The frosting was delish.

This is the best recipe I have found for Carrot cake and is always a hit when I make it.  I made small changes that makes the cake more to my family's taste. 1. substituted the veg. oil for equal parts olive oil and coconut oil (both unrefined)  2. Cut the frosting sugar by a cup and used coconut oil instead of butter. YUM YUM

AMAZING!!  I made a few modifications.  I added 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg, an extra teaspoon of cinnamon, an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract to the cake, and used walnuts instead of pecans.  For the frosting, I reduced the powdered sugar by 1 cup so I used only 3 cups and I omitted the pecans.  I made these modifications based on other reviews.  This was perfect, amazing, and immediately eaten by all.

I agree with the others! This is the best carrot cake I've ever had. I also took the advise of others and added extra cinnamon and some nutmeg. I used walnuts as they are hubby's favorite. I also added some coconut to the frosting, then sprinkled a good amount of nuts on top. It was a very impressive looking cake also. Absolutely delicious! I will  definately make again!

Delicious.  I agree would likely be even better with addition of pineapple (I've done that in the past) as well as applesauce.

SOOOOOOOO Yummy!! This recipe has become a staple of mine at pot lucks and holiday parties...i made a few changes to the original to cut fat/calories such as switching out 1/2 the oil for apple sauce and using a combo of half white/brown sugar and adding the crushed pineapple. Everything else was left as is on the original recipe.  This was my first attempt at making Carrot Cake and it came out soo good that I shall never have to search for another recipe again.

I've never been into carrot cake until I tried this one.  Its was great, and everyone loved it... I made it twice in one week. :)  The only thing I did different was I used honey nut cream cheese, because I did'nt have regular cream cheese when I begin making it.  Still a great cake.

Wonderful!  I just wish I had figured out before I grated all the carrots by hand that you can do it in the food processor much more easily.  I made it dairy-free using substitutes (allergies in my family) and everyone loved it!

I followed the recipe and it was too fluffy. I think I'll try raisins and pineapple next time and three eggs instead of four.

This is by far the best carrot cake I have ever tasted.  I made this cake for Easter and followed the recipe as written. Next time I will try some of the changes, but find it difficult to believe this cake could get any better.

It was good, but I didn't think it had enough carrot flavor.  It is more like a spice cake.  But, I usually make my foods healthier than the recipe calls for.  I stuck to the recipe this time.  I will add more carrot next time.

This recipe is by far THE BEST! Don't like pineapple. Don't use nuts. I cut the oil to 1 cup and sometimes will use up to a 2 lb bag of carrots. The frosting is fabulous.

I love this recipe. For Thanksgiving I made it in a bundt pan, and then covered it with cream cheese frosting and use the kraft foods website to decorate it to look like a pumpkin, stem and all! made it in a normal spring-form pan for easter and it wasn't as great... definitely better in the bundt pan. none the less a delicious recipe.

I used the advice of others for this recipe plus my own - here is what I used 1) 3 eggs + 2 egg whites 2) 3/4 c. coconut oil + 3/4 c. applesauce 3) 1 cup of white & brown sugar 4) 3 tsp vanilla 5) 2 c. whole wheat flour.  For the icing I reduced the icing sugar to 2 cups and whipped all the ingredients until it was light and fluffy.  Simply deeelish!!!  Will definitely make this one again!

this was a fantastic cake! after my first carrot cake i got from another website ended up with an awful aftertaste i tried this one and was amazed at how soft and light it was! It kept well for a week. I followed all the advice from others and used half applesauce instead of all that oil and also put some raisins in for extra sweetness. Definately one to make again!

This was a hit this mothers day.  I did only use 3 cups of powder sugar in the frosting and it was still too sweet for my liking and I LOVE sweet things.  Also I did one cup of sugar and one cup of brown sugar in the cake.

Everything in this cake is sublime! The only thing I did different was to add 1/2 cup of coconut in the batter (so I put the carrots down to 2 1/2c so that the texture wouldn't be off) and I added coconut to the icing. (The icing, might I add is astoundingly good!) Thank you for this recipe, I will use it forever!

This recipe was perfect as is...made it for my brother's birthday this morning, comes out nicely moist, but not overly so, with good flavour and texture!  Awesome!!!  I do have to admit that I used whole wheat flour and egg substitute because I happened to have those ingredients, and didn't want to have to buy new...but again, the results were excellent.  I don't think there is any need to modify the recipe, unless you desire a decrease in fat or calories.

I made this cake with the Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site. I added 8 ozs of crushed pineapple and substituted some of the oil with applesauce per the suggestions of other reviewers. The cake turned out wonderfully! Rave reviews from everyone who ate it. This is a keeper!

This is by far the best carrot cake I have ever tasted! And it's the first one I've ever made. I did use the suggestions of 1c sugar/ 1c brown sugar and used 1-1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/2tsp nutmeg and 1/2tsp allspice.  I also used walnuts(because that is what I had on hand).  I was also pretty heavy handed with the nuts and the raisins.   I just dusted the top with powdered sugar instead of frosting. This cake is so moist and delicious. I can't wait to make it again!

This cake was very good! I had baked this cake when we had guests over & they were raving about the cake. I also gave them some home. I liked the fact that we didn't have to use butter in this recipe, was not feeling that guilty splurging on it; also I made this with Canola oil. I simply like the combination of nuts in the cake & a great cinnamon flavor. Hats off! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was my first attempt at making carrot cake.  I made it for Easter Sunday dinner.  It was incredibly good - and even my family - not fans of carrot cake - loved it.  I used a food chopper to chop everything up and that worked great.  I will definately be making this recipe again in the future!

This was my first attempt at making a carrot cake. I was really craving some and it was so yummy. In order to get it out of my house so I didn't eat it all I took it to work where everyone had two or three pieces! They though it was store bought. I had high praise for this cake!

The absolute best carrot cake recipe, hands down. I made all the substitutions recommended (brown sugar, pineapple, etc.) and have had nothing but raves for this cake.

This cake and frosting was fabulous! I substituted 1/2 the oil with applesauce and couldn't tell at all. We had extra frosting left over and my husband made me save it so he could eat the rest. It was so good! Thanks!

If i could give more stars I would.  I live in Greece and everywhere i take the cake, it gets gobbled up and people want the recipe. I have been using this recipe for years.  The only thing you can say i changed is that I use is extra virgin olive oil because of location and its PERFECT.  Thank You Thank You for such a wonderful recipe.

Very, very easy and VERY Delicious. My husband said it was an awesome cake!  It turned out really moist too.  I chopped the carrots instead of grated, just because it seemed easier. I also added a touch of Nutmeg, because I love nutmeg. Everything else was right to this recipe.

I changed it with the 1 cup brown sugar, 1 cup white and added more cinnamon and nutmeg into it.  It was just semi - sweet but I frosted it with Vanilla frosting, it was excellent!

I made this cake for this past Easter and it was a BIG hit. Every single person in my family loved it. The only thing I changed was I used half the oil asked for and replaced the rest with apple sauce. I will be making this cake again really soon since there wasn't much leftover! :)

WONDERFULL!! I used half the sugar (Splenda) and NO oil, but sub'd freshed pineapple pureed w/a little applesauce (still chunky).  No nuts instead I used raisens...hate to make changed, but I always sub oil and dropped the nuts because I was feeding 3 babies/toddlers.  I just sprinkled the topw/ powdered sugar...YUMMY!

I have never eaen carrot cake, or made one until I tried this one. I thought you'd be able to taste the carrots, but you couldn't-they just made it nice and moist, which was perfect. I used a cup of brown and a cup of white sugar and skipped the nuts. Amazing! Made a great Easter time dessert. Thank you!

I have made this cake 3 times now, and it is a hit every time. I usually add raisins and walnuts (per my boyfriends request), but it very tasty with out them as well. The frosting is heavenly, and I love it warmed up for breakfast! Thanks for sharing this delight:)

This is a fantastic recipe! My first attempt at making a cake from scratch and it turned out wonderful- everyone loved it! I made the cake exactly as in recipe, except used walnuts instead of pecans. I did use a different version of the cream cheese icing though. I used 1 and 1/2 blocks (12 oz.) of cream cheese, 5 tbsp of butter and 2 cups of powdered sugar. It was excellent! Four cups of powdered sugar just seemed too much for me. I will definitely be making this cake again!

Awesome! I did what most people did: applesauce in place of oil, white and brown sugar, and additional spices. it was fantastic! i made cupcakes for Easter and they were amazing. the only thing is i used 2 cups of sugar for the icing and for me it was still a little too sweet. definitely don't use four!

This carrot cake was outstanding!!! THe only thing I will change next time is the icing. It was a little too thick and not much of a cream cheese taste. Will cut the amout of powdered sugar next time.

I made this for Easter and my husband said it was the best carrot cake he'd tasted.  I put in half brown sugar and half white granulated to total about 1-1/2 cups. 1 extra tsp. vanilla, 1/2 tsp. more cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg and used walnuts. Since I am lactose intolerant I used "tofutti" soy cream cheese for the frosting, along with only 2 cups of sugar.  It was not overly sweet, just right. That's why my dh loved it so much.  Thanks for a great recipe.  A keeper.

I did take the advice of many previous posters to make the PERFECT carrot cake. (1 cup of brown/I cup white sugar, extra tsp cinammon and vanilla, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp cloves, 3/4 oil 1/2 apple sauce) And like many others found the icing too sweet with even 2.5 cups sugar. I only used 1.5 cups of the confectioners sugar and that was perfect for me. I have a 'weekly' request for carrot cake from the coworkers.

Excellent carrot cake. I change a few minor things. 1/2 cup applesauce and 3/4 cup oil. 1/4 tsp nutmeg. EXCELLENT CAKE! I did NOT want to put in all that oil! Please do use applesauce! I love it. I wish I had more cake for leftovers!

This cake was delicious! I didn't have any plain pecans, so I added candied pecans my mother in law had given us from her trees down in Texas - they were a delicious addition! Also, I did not have enough powdered sugar by a long shot, so I added some whipped vanilla frosting (storebought) to the cream cheese and it was very light and fluffy - Yum!  We loved this cake.

I hate to be a party pooper, but the cake did not turn out that great.  First, 6 cups of carrots was way too much and it definitely could have used more of a spice, not sure which spice.  I'll make it again, but will tweek it by reviewing other suggestions.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made 2 9" cakes and made a little extra frosting.  I also followed another reviewer's advice and used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar and added strained crushed pineapple (1 cup?) and 1 tsp extra vanilla.  I also squeezed out the shredded carrots to prevent the cakes from being too moist.  Everyone at my Easter dinner raved, saying I should sell this cake.  Thanks!!

Really good cake!! The only feedback I recieved from Easter dinner was that it had a bit too much cinnamon I would have to agree.  I see others added extra. No way..and I like cinnamon.  Also sprinkled the pecans on the frosting instead of mixing them in.  My 2 yeaty old halped make this so not hard to follow.  Will use again and maybe make it an Easter tradition. Thanks for the great recipe

I made some modifications to this recipe based on other reviews. I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon and vanilla and 8 oz of drained crushed pineapple. I also reduced the sugar to a 1/2C brown and 1/2C white sugar. I also substituted walnuts for pecans. The cake turned out very well and I received a lot of compliments at Easter dinner. Great taste.

I think I have a new all time favorite dessert!  I didn't even know I liked Carrot Cake, but I thought it would be appropriate for Easter, so I made one.  The only problem was I completely messed up the recipe.  I was following the suggestions of other reviewers, I did 1 cup white sugar, 1 cup of brown, 3/4 cup oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, and extra teaspon of cinnamon, and a teaspoon of nutmeg, and used walnuts instead of pecans--so this portion of my recipe was right, but somehow the main recipe had been adjusted to a half batch, so the rest of my cake was only half the ingredients--half the flour, half the carrots, half the egg, half the baking powder/soda/salt, etc...  I realized it when I went to make the frosting and fretted all day on what the result of this cake I was serving for Easter was going to be.  Surprisingly, it was an amazing mistake!  It was the best carrot cake I have ever had, very moist, very sweet, and very delicious!   I also slightly altered the frosting.  3.5 cups of powdered sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar.  It was EXCELLENT!  Everyone that ate it LOVED the whole thing.  So, if you like a sweet cake, give my mistake a try.  You won't be disappointed.

WOW! Made this for Easter and everyone LOVED it- me too! The only modification I made was to add a little bit another teaspoon of cinnamon.  I'm afraid to try any of the other modifications because it was really just perfect! As a side note, I thought it smelled a little funny when it was baking.  That made me nervous, but it really could not have been better!

Unfortunately I can't give the recipe five stars, but I think if the recipe is followed and not altered, it might be a five star. I changed a few ingredients from other recommendations (using part applesauce instead of all oil & using part brown sugar instead of all white). It turned a bit too dry for my taste. I think next time I will followi the recipe as written and hopefully will be able to change my rating to give it a five. All in all, it was still a good cake, even with the alterations.

Rave review from my family.  I did a few minor changes.  Used 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 cup of oil.  It was somewhat difficult cooking - took longer than expected and the middle did sink in, but that's nothing that frosting won't cover.  After reading some reviews, I do believe I overmixed the batter.  Oh, for the icing, I made lemon cream cheese that turned out perfectly and added a nice hint of flavor.  I used 1 1/2 packages of cream cheese (softened), 1 1/2 sticks butter (softened), 2 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, dash of lemon extract, and 3 3/4 cups of confectioners sugar.  My husband and family loved it.  Again, rave reviews from people who normally don't even like Carrot Cake.  This will be a new Easter Dessert favorite, I can assure you.  My two year old kept repeating, "More Carrot Cake".

This was a big hit at work and with the family.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I put my carrots in a chopper so they would be finely minced (I don't like biting into a big piece of carrot).  Fabulous.

The final product of this recipe was great. I followed the recipe exactly minus the nuts and made cup cakes instead of a cake (18 min). The frosting was also delicious. After I frosted them white, I made orange icing to make a little carrot and then made another small batch of green icing to make the top of the carrot. They tasted as good as they looked.

Yum! I didn't make any major changes, just used half brown & half white sugar and reduced the sugar in the frosting to about 2.5 cups. I made them into mini cupcakes and piped the frosting (first time and looked great! I will never put frost another way!) and reduced the cooking time to about 28 minutes to compensate. The cake itself was fairly moist, but I think it lacked a bit of flavor-maybe I'll use applesauce in place of some of the oil next time and up the spice (maybe a bit of nutmeg?).  However, the frosting was DELICIOUS! Also, two culinary school graduates tried them and raved, so I upped the rating from a 4 to a 5. Will definitely make again!

Made this for easter...just today! Turned out AWESOME! I did sub about 1/2 cup flax seed oil, 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup canola oil for the 1 1/4 cup veg oil. It is moist and very good! I did have to up the cook time about 10 - 15 minutes. OH I also cooked in 2 9" round pans so I had a layer cake. The icing for this is kinda sweet, but very good. It made PLENTY to use for filling and to ice the entire cake. Overall and AWESOME recipe. Well worth a try!

This was such a great carrot cake.  I did make some substitutions though!  I used apple sauce instead of oil, I used an equal mix of all purpose and whole wheat flour, and an equal mix of brown sugar and white sugar.   It was awesome.  A lady who hates carrot cake tasted it and loved it!  Thanks for the recipe.  i will use it again and again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the result was kinda disappointing. While my cake was moist it was lacking the flavor of both the carrot and spice that I am used to.  In defense of the cake I looked at other carrot cake recipes and they were quite similar to this recipe. I don't know what I could have done differently but this is not the taste of carrot cake that I remember.

I made this cake for my family's Easter dinner and it was amazing.  I didn't alter the ingredients in any way - it is wonderful just the way it is.  I had a beautiful round cake plate, so I made a layer cake instead of a rectangular cake.  I shortened the baking time to 35 minutes and it was perfect.  I will definitely make this cake again!

This cake is absolutely fantastic!  I received so many positive comments.  I changed it a little, too.  I used walnuts instead of pecans, four cups of carrots instead of three, and added extra cinnamon.  I also sprinkled the walnuts on top of the frosting instead of mixing them into the frosting.

I made this late at night as a last minute dessert to bring, and it is REALLY a good carrot cake! I was out of vegetable oil so I had to improvise and used 2 sticks of melted margarine instead. The frosting isn't stiff enough for my preference, and is a bit too sweet. I may look for a different frosting recipe next time. LOVE IT!

This was the first carrot cake I ever made since I don't like carrot cake.  This is now my FAVE cake ever!  I made it as is, followed the original recipe exactly.  Spectacular! I will be making this often.  It counts as a vegetable, right?

Moist and delicious!  I also think this is the best carrot cake I've ever had and everyone who ate it called it "fabulous" or "fantastic".  I added a little nutmeg and in the future I might cut the oil and use some applesauce like someone else suggested, but it was really delicious.  Making my boyfriend grate the carrots cut out 1/2 hour of prep.

Amazing! I had all of my corridor mates drooling for a slice of this delicious cake. It is a bit on the sweet side, however, so you may want to consider cutting down the powdered sugar in the frosting, or something. But really, it is sooo scrumptious! :)

I have made this several times, both as cake and as cupcakes. Every time, it's a huge hit! (I always substitute applesauce for about 1/3 to 1/2 of the oil.)

I made this following the recipe exactly, except that I used 2 9" round cake pans (I adjusted the time accordingly).  I have to say that I was very disappointed with the look of the cake when I took it out of the oven.  Both of the cakes had collapsed in the middle.  So, of course, when I frosted it it was concave in the middle.  Which, of course, made everyone at the b-day party pick on me, until they tasted it!  It was great!  The taste was awesome, just wish I could figure out what happened with the presentation!  Anyway, taste would be 5 stars but for presentation I had to go 4...  Great recipe.  Thank you!

It is a great recipe if you use all the alternations suggested above. I do cut on oil, just 1 cup is fine and instead add apple sauce. Everybody who tried the cake keep asking for a recipe.

great recipe, i didnt even read the reviews, just thought i would try it and all i can say is WOW, my girlfriend almost bit my hand off when i tried to take her plate away from her ha ha.. only by the fact i didnt have enough brown sugar i used 1 1/2 cups white sugar and substituted 1/2 cup light brown sugar and it was just amazing. i also used 5 eggs instead of 4 because the eggs in japan tend to be a little smaller more along the medium size. i will never buy carrot cake in a box again!

This is one of the best carrot cakes I have ever had.  It was moist and chewy, not dry like most of the ones I have eaten in the past.  The frosting is really sweet, but it's a great compliment to the cake (which I didn't think was too sweet at all).   I will make this again for sure!

I don't like cake.  I don't like carrot cake.  HOWEVER...this one is to die for.  You have to make the icing from scratch as well - don't cheat and buy a can!  It takes 2 minutes to whip up the icing.  I like this cake because the cake itself is moist and not too terribly sweet (which is why I don't like most cakes...they're just too sweet).  I used half oil and half natural applesauce instead of all that oil, and it turned out just fine.  Everyone went back for seconds.  Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe!!!

Good but it wasn't as good as I was expecting. The icing is the perfect proportions and I wouldn't change a thing about it. However, I found the cake to have too much sugar and it seemed to be missing something. That said, it was very moist and everyone enjoyed it. I'll use the icing recipe again, but will probably look for an alternative cake.

You must try this recipe!!  Absolutely delicious, so moist, so flavorful - everyone, including those who say they don't like carrot cake, love this cake!  Also, the best cream cheese frosting recipe I've ever made.  A definite keeper!  The only substitution I made was replacing 1/4 cup of the oil (used canola oil) with applesauce.

Made this now several times to exact portions and with some mods. First time I over mixed but second time forward perfect and made several times since! Some tips: I use my juicer to shred the carrots but retain all the juice and mix both with all the other wet ingredients before adding in the dry. It's finer but I can't be asked to shred by hand. What results is a superb moist cake to which you can add raisins, walnuts or other candied citrus peel (tried orange). Additional cinnamon or nutmeg to taste. Also tried soaking the raisins in some brandy or grand marnier. Provides a nice counterpoint to the carrot and/or nuts.

This is fantastic- both elements, the frosting and the cake, work really well as directed.  The cake is the moistest I have ever made-- almost verging on too moist, but it's not too moist. Super recipe, definitely the carrot cake standard.

Fantastic! When my boyfriend saw the recipe, he said, "what possessed person number 1,472 to decide to write a review? didn't they think there were enough?" Well, i'm going to add as well. It's just that good! Also used part applesauce and part canola oil and replaced most of white sugar with brown sugar (ran out of white!).   For the frosting I only used about 2 3/4 cup powdered sugar. Had a great cream cheese flavor.   My cake also cooked REALLY fast. Done in about 30 minutes in a 13 x 9 pan. It's not the oven - used it a lot. So watch the cake!

I really don't like carrot cake but my husband asked for it for his birthday so I couldn't really say no.  I was amazed because I really liked it too!!!!  The next day it took half of it to work and the guys actualy fought over it!  It was that good!

By far the best carrot cake ever!  Followed the recipe exactly (except I  omitted the pecans) and it turned out perfect!  Would recommend half the amount of icing sugar for the icing as it's quite sweet.

This recipe has been made in my family since I was little.  It's fabulous, moist, delicious, and if you don't have pecans...it doesn't matter...it still tastes great! (i usually never add the pecans) I always get compliments on this cake.

My husband had been buying Carrot Cake at the grocery store for a few months for him. I take a few bites, but it is so dry, and terrible. I told him I bet I can make a better cake then the grocery store..........and did! This is the best carrot cake.  I did use the big side of the grater for the carrots, and I used the apple sauce instead of all the oil. It was so moist, and yummy yummy yummy!!!

I used non-stick cooking spray instead of actually greasing the cake pan and my cake stuck to the pan.  The middle of the cake also "sunk". I'm not sure if I'll try it again...my own fault.

I thought this came out decent overall, but not as moist as I would have liked. Also, the frosting was way too sweet! Would've been better with half the amount of sugar I think.

This was very good.  I loved the homey texture and crusty top.  This could be improved by the addition of cloves or allspice.

This is by far the best carrot cake ever.  I make it for all my kids' birthdats.  I do add extra vanilla, nutmeg, cinnamon and do the oil and applesauce as previously stated.  I also add raisins and only one fourth of the amount of sugar and i use brown sugar.(my husband's not big on sweets but the raisins make up for it; use a mix of golden and regular grapes for color).  walnuts are yummy in it too.You must try it!!!!

My husband's favorite cake is carrot cake so I have always been afraid to try to make a homemade carrot cake for fear of letting him down. I found this great recipe and knowing it had 5 stars and after reading the raving reviews, I decided to make the cake. My husband was so impressed with the taste that he is already asking me to make another one! Thanks so  much for sharing this recipe!!

I'm new at making cakes from scratch. I followed this recipe exactly except for the vanilla. I only had 1 tsp of vanilla. I added a few drops of lemon extract.  I poured the batter into a 9x11 pan. It fell in the middle. It tastes good, but is very heavy.  Is that because of the 1 1/4 cups oil?  Is there any way it could be made with less oil?

This was really yummy!  I did add 1/8 tsp of nutmeg just because I like it. I didn't make the frosting, just used canned because I was in a hurry.  Thanks for the great carrot cake...with no pineapple!! :)

Made this cake last night for bf's birthday. It was actually the first oven cake I've ever made so I don't have much to compare it to, but it was better than bought carrot cakes I've tasted. Easy to make. Great flavours. Loved the nuttiness. Stuck to original recipe (apart from only using 2 and 1/2 cups sugar in icing) and it was great. I wouldn't change a thing.

Very delicious!  I used 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar.  I also used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 oil.  This worked out to be a very moist and tasty cake!

It was good, my husband loved it but i wasn't especially pleased with it.  I used two round cake pans and the middle dipped a little...the taste was spicy but i think i keep looking for the "perfect" recipe.

I did use some of the suggestions from other reviewers, and I found this to be the best carrot cake I have ever made! But I think that even without the revisions, it would be a phenomenal cake. Thank you for sharing!

This is an EXCELLENT recipe! I followed all the suggested edits found in the first review direclty under the the recipe and got rave reviews. I would however use a lot less sugar in the icing. Next time I will make it with 2 1/2 cups.

I followed the recipe exactly as written with the exception of leaving out the nuts (hubby doesn't like them).  It is an excellent basic recipe and is moist and delicious.  You could use this as a jumping off board for further alterations, but as a carrot cake lover I like it just as it was intended to be.

Absolutely fantastic! Read what most of the other reviews and decreased the amount of cooking oil and added apple sauce instead.  Also turned down the sweetness in the cream cheese frosting by halving the sugar. Turned out so well, I'm making this again next week!

This was my first attempt at a carrot cake and it was so delicious!  The cake was fluffy and moist.  I did shred about a 1/2 cup too many carrots and added it anyway, and did add a bit more vanilla and cinnamon (I don't know if it made a significant difference).  The icing was yummy, too!  My only problem was that the cake didn't set well in the middle, so I wasn't able to take it out of the glass pan as it stuck even though I greased and floured it plenty (maybe if I'd used metal?). I had to bake it for about 10 extra minutes since it was still wobbly in the center.  I didn't take it out of the pan and just cooled and frosted it in there.  I will definitely make it again!

Baked this a few days ago :) tasted great as always... i added 1 cup of white sugar and 1 brown sugar which intensifies the taste of the cake.. i also added 4 tsp of cinnamon i love alot of it... I also used 1 cup of oil only instead of 1&1/4 cups.
Great recipe!

The I didn't have quite enough flour for all of my dishes (making Thanksgiving dinner) so I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2  wheat flour.   Ugh, that may not have been a good choice.  My husband loves carrot cake and he was only so-so with this one.  He loved the frosting though.  I'll try one more time with only all purpose flour.

Being the party pooper here and giving it only 4 stars.  After reading the breathless reviews of how great this cake was going to be, thought I would make it for my husband's 35th b-day yesterday.  It was a great cake, but not the best, the most delicious, the most penultimate ever, the take-me-to-the-moon cake I was expecting after reading the reviews.  That carrot cake would have been made by the "Carrot Cake Man" in West Philadelphia, a type of cake I've been searching for years. In the end, hubby and guests liked it.  I was less than impressed as I like a denser carrot cake and expected to swoon with delicious delight.  No swooning.  Mine looked just exactly like the picture here, but I didn't add nuts.  Grated the carrots not only the smallest grate and not one that we would use for cheese, but the medium side. That worked out well as there was virtually no carrot juice and yet there was still texture.  Good cake and one that will certainly get the baker compliments,  but I won't be making this particular recipe again.  Back on the quest for the perfect carrot cake on allrecipes site!

I added a can of crushed pineapple, a handful of raisins, and a little less than 1 oz. of grand mariner for extra flavor.  Also, I guess b/c of the additions, I had lots of batter.  So I made 2 9 in. cake pans + 5 cupcakes. My husband loved this!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake was delicious!
I made half recipe in a 9x9 square pan
I used less oil, approximately 1/4 c. as well as less sugar, about 1/3 c. 
I also substituted walnuts for pecans.
My family ate it in about 1 day.

I followed this recipe exactly and was very happy with the results.  I originally made this cake 2 months ago for a party and everyone enjoyed it.  One person didn't even like carrot cake but tried it because everyone was raving about it.  I was asked to make it for Thanksgiving.  I think I did add a little less powdered sugar than was called for, but other than that, I followed it exactly.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written.  I agree that you cannot truely judge a recipe if you change any of the ingredients. With that being said, this was an okay recipe. I won't be making it again.  It came out not dry, but it isn't as moist as I like my carrot cake to be. The flavor of the cake was a bit bland to me.  The frosting was good, but maybe a little too thick.  My kids loved it though!

Just- amazing. It's so light, fluffy and MOIST. It's the perfect carrot cake! Just one odd thing happened to me: I didn't peel my carrots and I had green flecks in my carrot cake. Honest (I have witnesses.) The carrots were just bought and gorgeous with beautifully bright, clean, peels, so I just scrubbed them and grated them unpeeled. I think the peel portion oxidized or something. So peel your carrots! As for the icing, it was delicious, but it was very sweet, even when I cut down on the sugar, and then the icing was runnier than I think it should have been. I am going to look for a cheesier recipe with less sugar. Nobody complained, though- my hubby and company were moaning with pleasure as they ate!

Excellent recipe but... it incorporates way too much sugar and ends up with a ton of icing - I'd say plenty for at least two cakes. Using half the sugar for the icing is more reasonable. I also decreased the amount of sugar in the cake batter.

I did not make the cake but I did however make the frosting to my own personal cake recipe, and it was really good, but what I did differently is cut the confectioners sugar in half, because honestly if I kept it at 4 cups I would have died from how sweet it would have tasted.

This was a very easy recipe and very satisfying.  My husband liked it because it didn't have alot of frou-frou ingredients.  If he's gonna have carrot cake, he want carrot cake, plain and simple. 

I liked it because it was a great use for shredded carrots that I had in abundance when my freezer let go this past week.  Let them eat cake.

I never liked carrot cake but my bf does, so i made this recipe w/ a few changes that others mentioned on this site. We both loved it but next time i wont use so many nuts bc bf does not like them, i did tho. Dont be afraid to put in pineapple, i drained most of the fluid out and i thought it really helped bring out all the flavors of the cake. Also used 2 10'' pans and it was done in almost half the time! Dust pans w/ flour, both my cakes came right out.This recipe made a believer out of me!

It is dense, but completely fool-proof. I DON'T know how to bake and it turned out perfect. Read plenty of reviews and made these changes: half white half brown sugar, 1 cup oil, 2 cups carrots and 1 cup of sweetened coconut. For the frosting, I used 2 cups of confectioner sugar. Since I didn't have a 9x13 pan, I used half the batter for an 8x8 pan and the other half to fill a 6-muffins pan. I put BOTH pans in the oven at 350 for 35 minutes. Did not collapse in the middle. I am very much impress with myself :)

This cake is so good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely but did heed a few suggestions.  I used 1 cup brown sugar + 1 cup white sugar; used 1 tbs. cinnamon; and 3/4 cup oil + 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I also added about 1/3 cup crushed pineapple (squeezed of most juice).  My husband's coworkers said it was one of the most moist cakes they've ever had.  Oh, and I also divided the batter between (3) 9" round cake pans and reduced the time in the oven slightly.  I did this because my husband's family likes a greater icing to cake ratio.  This is my go-to recipe for carrot cake!

this cake is really good- of course, i did follow a few suggestions! ;-) definitely sub out 1/2 cup of the oil with unsweetened applesauce- i'll actually increase that to 3/4 cup next time. it really is so moist that you'll have no idea the fat's been reduced. also, i did sub out half the white sugar with light brown, added 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a pinch of ground cloves. truly delicious- but, fyi- very sweet. i added some tang (grated lemon peel) to the frosting to mellow out the sugar just a touch. Oh! and i baked the cake as THREE 8.5 inch layers. make this for a birthday or special gathering with no second guessing!

This recipe was great.  So easy and yet so moist and delicious.  I made it for a birthday at work and they said it was the best they had ever had.  

This is now my only recipe for Carrot Cake. 

Thanks!

This makes a nice moist cake. I used a small electric chopper to speed up grating the carrots. The texture is similar to grated carrot with much less time and effort (especially when using small carrots).

I made this recipe for my mom's birthday because carrot cake is the only cake she likes.  Not only did she LOVE it, but my 2 nieces, 2 nephews, and both of my sisters-in-law loved it!  It was so moist.  It was much better than the last one I did.  My suggestion would be to use only 2 to 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar for the frosting.  Any more than that and I think the frosting would be too sweet and take away from the cream cheese.  Great recipe!!

Delicious.  The frosting was really good and I used only half the sugar.  I probably won't make this too often because it's a lot of work to grate carrots!

incredibly delish! I just made this for my daughter's 1st bday and it was an absolute hit. Everybody loved it, including those who didn't even like carrot cake! Granted I did sub 1/2 cup applesauce & 1/2 cup coconut oil with a little oo in place of the oil and it did cause some issues with the crust, it was still super moist and not a single piece was left over.

First time I've made carrot cake from scratch.  This was awesome.  Used 1/2 cup brn sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup splenda.  Used 8 oz applesauce and 1/4 cup oil.  Used cream cheese frosting II.  Used 1/2 the amt of sugar and substituted splenda for that.  This is for my small group - and I can't wait to serve it!  Thank-you so much for this recipe.

OMG these are awsome!!!!! I've had many carrot cakes but these are the best. I did change it slightly though. I used 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup oil, and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup each white and brown sugar(did this because the icing is very sweet). Icing came out perfect too. I made them as mini muffins and only takes about 8 min to bake.

This carrot cake was one of the best I've had, however I can't give it a full 5 stars. The cake was extremely moist, almost too moist. I had a hard time telling it was done baking because the toothpick I inserted in the center to test with, wasn't exactly dry and clean but it wasn't gummy either. It didn't come out dry and clean because the cake is so wet. I actually had to cut a little chunk out of the middle to see that it actually was fully baked. I will definately replace my old carrot cake recipe with this one, just perhaps I'll cut down on the oil a bit. I also replaced the pecans in this recipe with walnuts because walnuts were cheaper. Also I had never had carrot cake with pecans before, only walnuts.

I can't give a reciipe 5 stars if I modify it but the tweaked recipe was almost a 5.  I lost my mother's recipe and this one was almosst as good.  I used 1c sugar, 1c brown sugar, extra tsp vanilla, extra tsp cinnamon and added 1/4 tsp nutmet (all following other reviews).  I didn't have enough white flour so I used 2 1/2c flour and 1/2c whole wheat flour.  Husband loved it.  Thanks for a great carrot cake!

I thought this carrot cake was good, but not amazingly, overwhelmingly awesome (which is why I couldn't rate it 5 stars).  There was just something about the blend of spices that left me thinking that I've had better carrot cake in my life.  I will continue to look around for other carrot cake recipes.  The icing, however, was great!  Such a good, all-around crowd-pleasing cream cheese icing.  Thanks for posting!

I followed this recipe exactly and must say I was a little disappointed.  The reviews were so good I was expecting a lot more.  I found that I had to cook it an extra 7 minutes for the center to be done and by that time the edges were very dry.  We cut into it for desert and i tried it with and w/o icing was just ok.  I put the leftovers in the fridge and it did taste better cold the next day.  I probably won't make this again.

This is a really good carrot cake recipe, but I would follow the suggestions of using 1C regular sugar and 1C brown sugar and adding 1 tbsp of nutmeg.  I also added crazins which adds a great taste and some fun color to the cake.  It is very decadent so don't plan on eating a huge piece!

This cake is fantastic! I did use suggestions from previous reviews:  used part applesause, 1/2 white, 1/2 brown sugar, added extra vanilla and cinnamon).
I will never use another carrot cake recipe again.  This came out so moist and perfect, with wonderful flavor.  The frosting is delish too!

This is the simplest and most delicious recipe ever! But I've made some variations: I use corn oil instead of vegetable, 3 tsps of cinammon instead of 2, and I've also added an ESSENTIAL ingredient: 1.5 teaspoon of NUTMEG!! (IT'S A MUST and makes a world of difference!). For the frosting, I soften the cream cheese and then add 2 cups of the the powdered, and then add the third cup little by little till I get JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF SWEETNESS BUT THE CREAM CHEESE STILL BEING THE DOMINANT FLAVOR. Trust me, the cake tastes much better when the frosting is less sweet; people that don't like carrot cake have tried this recipe and loved it!!!

Extraordinary recipe!  Moist and absolutely delicious.  I've made this three times now, including once as my own birthday cake.

The icing is excellent as well but I do add a lot less sugar, about half of what is called for - just my own preference.

This was ok, but would be much better with crushed pineapple and maybe a little nutmeg.

This is the first review I've submitted.  This cake was OUTSTANDING!!  My mom said it was the best carrot cake she's ever tasted.  I read through a great deal of reviews and picked what I thought would work for me.  I will definitely make this cake again!!

I usually bake the triple-layer carrot cake recipe that's on epicurious.com, but I needed something quick and easy to bring to a funeral, and this really fit the bill. I like my cake with a little more spice to it and usually add crushed pineapple, but people ate this up. It was the first dessert to go, and people loved it. I like it that it's in a 9x13" pan, so it's easily transported. I'd make this again for another potluck type event.

This is by far the best Carrot Cake I have ever tasted. It was so moist and delicious. I didn't have any nuts, so I added chopped coconut and raisins. It was perfect. My fiance loved it. I will be making this again and again!

My boyfriend and I really loved this cake. I made it because he had been pestering me to, and he thought it was rather daring of me to attempt one from scratch. I think he might have been worried that it was not going to turn out very well, but I followed the recipe to a T and it was perfect. The frosting however came out a little to cream-cheesy for me, so I did at another teaspoon and a half of vanilla (very good real vanilla)  more confectioners sugar, and a few teaspoons of cream. I am glad I did because the consistency was still a little thick and i was almost short on frosting the cake. I would highly recommend this recipe to anyone, and it is very easy to prepare. It baked up beautifully and was perfect in texture.

Wow! This was the BEST carrot cake (or even any CAKE) I have ever made. DO NOT make any changes to the recipe.  Make this AS STATED, and you will have a moist delicious carrot cake.  The only bad part was it's so good, and I've eaten too much! Not good for the diet...but great for the taste buds. AMAZING!

I have to consider myself a carrot cake expert because i have eaten it everywhere they serve it!  I love carrot cake!  this is the BEST carrot cake i every ate!!  its going to be hard to top this one!  the recipe is easy to follow and the outcome is worth the work!  after frosting the cake i put chopped pecans all around the edge of the cake to give a restaurant appearance.  Everyone at the office loved it!!

Great recipe Tammy!  I too followed some of the others suggestions and used half white and half brown sugar.  I also omitted the nuts from the icing and replaced it with a small can of crushed pineapple.  I topped it with toasted coconut and pecans. DELICIOUS!

This was the first time I ever made a carrot cake. I am rating this a 4 because my cake sunk a little in the middle and was a little more done around the edges. This is an excellent recipe and I recommend it to anyone considering making a carrot cake. The only thing I did differently was add raisins.

My 11 year old daughter used this recipe yesterday to make a carrot cake for her dad for Father's Day (carrot cake is his favorite). The recipe was easy for her to follow and the cake came out wonderful! It was moist and flavorful. We will definitely be using this one again.

A little disappointed. My cake started to fall in the middle so I waited 10 minutes and inverted onto a plate. Half stuck in the pan. Didn't over beat and greased and floured pan. Tastes good but looks terrible.

This was my first carrot cake (to make and eat) and it turned out perfectly. I skipped the frosting because we're not frosting people, halved the recipe, and used less sugar and carrots. It smelled wonderful, looked so pretty and tasted delicious. Will definitely be making more of this!

Best ever! I dont really like carrot cake but my 12 year old loves it. He requested that I make it for his birthday minus the nuts. It came out wonderfully! It was my first cake that I made from scratch and everyone loved it. I will make it again. I will eat this recipe!

DELICIOUS!  --- 3 cups of grated carrots is around 4 or 5 carrots depending on the size.  --- use a sieve and spoon portions of crushed pineapple at a time to drain the liquid.  --- yielded 29 muffins with 20 minute baking time

I made this a couple times for friendly gatherings.  Our guests raved about this cake (even a couple people who normally do not like carrot cake).  Excellent recipe!

I made this exactly the way it was posted, no nuts, and a little less sugar on the icing, and it was AMAZING! Everyone absolutely loved it. not the healthiest thing in the world, i think i'll try some of the modifications others suggested to make it a little healthier next time. but if it doesn't come out the same it won't be worth it because this carrot cake beats out any other that i've tried.

My husbad asked for carrot cake for his birthday, so I used this recipe, replacing part of the oil with applesauce, as some reviewers suggested. He loved it!

WOW...wow wow wow. This is so yummy. I even messed it up and it was yummy. I thought I had carrots, and in fact only had about 10 of already shredded carrots. Tried it anyways and it was AWESOME. I used some of the hints/tips of other reviewers- 1 cup white, 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup canola oil, 1/2 cup applesauce, and less sugar in the frosting and a teaspoon more of vanilla and cinnamon. I ate a quarter of the cake myself. I'll definitely be making this again...and soon!

I absolutely love this carrot cake recipe!  The only thing I do differently is add crushed pineapples to my mixture, it makes it very moist.

YUM! My 15-year-old daughter made this cake for me for Mother's Day. She used 3/4 cup oil and 3 1/2 cups of carrots instead of the amount of oil it called for.  She also added nutmeg and used a little bit more vanilla extract. YUM!

This cake was just okay.  I didn't think it was outstanding at all and was surprised at so many rave reviews.  I made some of the changes suggested by other reviewers... applesauce in place of half the oil; brown sugar in place of half the white sugar, crushed pineapple, cinnamon, etc.  I still found it to be very average.  It is a VERY dense cake and maybe that was part of what I didn't care for.  I was looking for something a bit lighter.  I took it to work for a birthday and it did get rave reviews and it was gone really quickly, so maybe it was just my taste.

Ok, I don't know what happened but I have never seen a cake behave this way in the oven before. Not only did it start oozing over the sides but it got crunchy on the top and almost caramelized. Very strange. I did give it the two stars because although very sweet it does have a good flavor. The inside ov the cake was moist once you got past the crunchy part. I will try it again with a slightly different method and see if I can get it to come out better. With taste like this it is worth a try.

Excellent, delicious. I read several of the comments which helped me a lot. I added 3 tsp of cinnamon and vanilla instead of 2 and I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. On the frosting I only used 2 cups of the sugar needed and it tasted sort of like cheesecake it was delicious.

Unfortunately, this was not the best carrot cake I have ever had as I was hoping, based on previous reviews. I (and 4 of my friends) thought the cake was dry and bland, however, the frosting was delicious to me and not too sweet. However, my friend commented it was too sweet for him.  It just depends on your personal preference.

This was my second time making this cake just to try it out again with some adjustments (like using some applesauce, increasing the spices, etc). This cake was not for us. My family didn't even eat a whole piece. We much prefer the Martha Stewart orange carrot cake.

This was soooo good!!! I did however take the advice of other reviewers and made a few changes. I did use brown sugar as well as white sugar, I didn't use as much oil, I added more cinnamon and some nutmeg, I did only use 3.5 cups sugar otherwise its too sweet. I made this for my host family in Japan and a few of my classmates and they all thought it was the best carrot cake they ever had. My boyfriend who is also a picky eater when it comes to sweets couldn't believe how yummy a carrot cake could be. LOVED IT!

I made changes as suggested 
- I used 1/2 cup veggie oil and 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce.
- I used 1-1/2 cups sugar
- added in some nutmeg
- for the frosting I also use less sugar

What didnt I like? It wasn't "carrot-y enough" and was still too sweet. I will try another cake next time. Nice consistency though.

Having never made (or even eaten) carrot cake before, I don't have much to compare to but this was really good!  I followed the modifications recommended by gneebeanie and was happy with how the cake turned out.  I wasn't a big fan of the icing however insofar as it came out thinner than I'd like.  I topped with shredded coconut and the family loved it.  I'll definitely make this again - but with a different icing :)

This carrot cake is absolutely delicious. I made it for a luncheon party and there was nothing left over. The only change I made was in the icing. I used half the butter and less than half of the sugar than called for and it still turned out terrific!

This cake was incredible. I think it is unfair to rate a recipe when several changes have been made but this time I'm making an exception. I followed gneebeanie's advice (but left out the nuts) and it was a hit. If you are looking for the BEST carrot cake recipe then follow gneebeanie’s modifications. AWESOME!!

This was delicious.  I followed the review with all the changes like apple sauce and brown sugar.
I made it for Easter, in a bundt pan and cut it in the shape of a bunny.  My kids kept coming back for more,
Thanks for sharing.

This was so wonderful!  The cake is very moist and had a great texture.  The frosting was perfectly sweet.  

I made two cakes, each with 2 layers for an office work party and got rave reviews.  I did follow some of the reviewer suggestions and substituted some of the oil with natural applesauce, used 1 c. brown & 1 c. white sugar and for the frosting, I used 3 cups of conf. sugar instead of 4, still very sweet and light/fluffy.  A definite keeper!

My family really like the recipe.  The only changes we will make for the next time is adding raisins.  I also made a few of the adjustments like adding extra tsp of vanilla, cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also exchanged one of the cups of white sugar for brown.  And the icing was out of sight.  We loved it.  I only used 2 cups of sugar for that.  But my family absolutely loved the icing.  

Just an update.  The second time I made this I added raisins as that was a request from the family.  They love it even more.  It is also still very moist and delicious.  Great recipe.

I made this for my dad's birthday, and it was a HUGE HIT!  I'd never made carrot cake before, but decided to try other people's modifications with a few of my own: 1) 1 c brown sugar & 1 c white, 2) added extra tsp of vanilla, 3) added 1 c raisins, 4) added 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 5) added 1 extra tsp cinnamon, 6) used 3/4 c applesauce and 1/2 c oil, 7) subst. 1c chopped walnuts.  Fabulous & a new family favorite!

AWESOME!!!!  Made it the first time for Easter and made it again the next weekend for my family, mom, neighbor and co-workers!!
I do recommend cutting the powder sugar way down though, I am cutting to 1 cup this time (used 2 cups before and it was still very sweet).  The only other major change I made was substituting 1/2 cup of the veg. oil for 2 jars of carrot baby food, makes it just a bit healthier and doesn't loose any flavor or moisture.
This is definitely a recipe I will use again and again and again......

This was my first time making carrot cake.  The cake and the frosting are both delicious!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just as good as any carrot cake I've ever had, even from a bakery.  I used two 8" round pans and made it as a layered cake with more nuts all around the sides.  There was more than enough frosting.  Make this cake, you won't be disappointed. :o)

Absolutely THE best carrot cake recipe I have come across so far.  The cake was so moist and not too dense.  For me, this made 1 cake made in two 9x13 round pans, as well as 6 cupcakes (I just took the cupcake pan out earlier so they wouldn't burn).  Did the 3/4 cup Oil, 3/4 cup Apple sauce hint as well.

As far as the icing goes, I added 1-2 TBSP of milk on top of the rest of the ingredient to make it a little more spreadable.

Best carrot cake I've had! I made it for Easter (and shaped it into a bunny) and it was delicious! I added cinnamon to the recipe. Also, I tried to skimp on the powdered sugar in the frosting which only left me with very thin icing. I'll using this recipe again.

The was very easy to make. I added a tsp more vanilla to the cake. Instead of useing the full amount of oil I used half oil and half applesauce. It turned out great.

Awesome cake! My Mother who is visiting from New York fell in love... with your carrot cake III, and she asked me for the recipe. 

If you are on a diet...  I wonder if it packs a la ton of calories... I love it anyway, and you all will too!

This is by far THE BEST carrot cake I have ever tasted and I was proud to say I made it. I followed the adjustments that were suggested in the reviews and I was extremely pleased with the results. I used a bundt cake pan and therefore used a fraction of the frosting.

This was good. I used canned cream cheese frosting b/c I didn't have a lot of time, and I prefer walnuts. Not the moistest carrot cake I have made, but overall very good

I too used gneebeanie's recommendations, and I absolutely loved the cake. I only used about 1 1/2 to 2 cups of powdered sugar in the frosting and I thought it was perfect.

This cake is Marvelous!!!!  I used the substitutions posted by gneebeanie and it turned out great.  I used my salad shooter with the large grater to grate the carrots and it worked wonderfully.   I made a smaller cake and some cupcakes.  They were all a hit.  I will definitely  make this recipe over and over again!!!

This receipe was amazing!  This was the first time I made carrot cake, and it is my husbab=nds favorite desert, so I was nervous to see how he would like it.  I made it fr a friends dinner party.  My husband came up to me, and said "Now keep in mind, I am very picky about my carrot cake.....and this was the best I ever tasted!"  The only thing I changed was the frosting - I made one with whipped heavy cream, confec. sugar & cream cheese.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  I baked it in two 9 inch rounds (although, there was a little too much batter, so I also made a little mini cake).  The frosting was also really good (lots of compliments!).  The leftover cake was still moist 4 days later.  
I followed the recipe almost exactly - I just used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown and also added 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  It was really tasty - I will be adding this one to my repertoire for sure!

I followed this recipe strictly and used exact measurements... and the batter was delicious! However, I was unsure as to cooking time as it stated to bake for 40-50 minutes. At 40 minutes, the cake was not done and at 50 minutes, the cake had burned a bit at the bottom. I used a nonstick pan and greased it, however the cake still stuck (perhaps because it had overcooked).. Also I think I should have used less than 2 tsp baking soda; the cake had bubbles at the top.. Nonetheless, it was still edible and tasty!!! I used another icing recipe I found on the web site... Cream Cheese Icing II.. and it was fantastic.. used only 2 cups confectioner's sugar, 2 8 oz portions of cream cheese, 1/2 cup unsalted butter, and 1 tsp vanilla essence!! perfect, hope it's a hit at the DISH PARTY!

This was my first carrot cake and it was great.  Used the modifications by gneebeanie.  Did not put nuts in frosting.  Cake and frosting were delicious.  Adding to my first review...my best friend asked me to make this cake for her wedding cake and not only did the guests love it, it looked beautiful too.

I had high hopes for this recipe since it got such great reviews, but I was disappointed after taking my first bite.  The cake was very dry, not moist at all.  I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil and only used 3/4 C of oil and a 1/2 C of applesauce.  Maybe that's why?

I made this cake for Easter.  My dad and my aunt love carrrot cake!  This cake came out absolutely delicious.  Even the frosting which I made right before I put the cake on the table was the best!  No more boxed carrot cake for me.

I used this recipe for carrot cupcakes, and they were really good! Very moist and flavourful! I set the recipe to 10 servings and got 33 cupcakes out of it. I used 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, I substituted some of the oil for apple sauce and I used walnuts. Everybody enjoyed them and I will definitely make them again!

This is a really good cake. I accidentally put in 4 c. carrot but i guess that only made it better b.c it was very moist. I love the nuts so added them inside and on top. Also per other reviewers added 1/4 tsp nutmeg. Didn't bother with extra vanilla or pineapple. It smelled heavenly while baking.

I was asked to bring a carrot cake for a dinner we went to.  Having never made carrot cake before, I started doing some online searching for one.  I came across this one and made it.

I kid you not, this recipe was to die for!  I'm not even a huge carrot cake lover...but this was so moist and tasty!  Everyone went back for seconds and thirds and there was nothing left.  They have all asked for the recipe.

I kept mine in the pan and frosted the top, instead of cooling on a wire rack.  It was still tasty! :)

Wonderful! We made it for Easter brunch and it turned out perfectly. I changed the recipe slightly: I changed the oil to 1/2 c. applesauce and 3/4 c. oil, only used 1/2 c. pecans, added 1/4 t. nutmeg and used 1 c. white sugar and 1 c. brown sugar.

Like others reviewers, I specifically chose this recipe because it doesn't call for pineapples, coconut, etc. I'm a purist when it comes to carrot cake. I used only a little over 1/2 a cup of the nuts (a cup is too much for us) and I used Cream Cheese Frosting II from this site (the one for cream cheese lovers - like me!) and it was perfect. People fought for a slice of this cake at work and at an Easter Dinner party I attended. I'll post pictures soon.

I have made this twice in the last week and it turned out excellent both times. I've gotten many compliments. I haven't modified the recipe at all because it turned out so well the first time. One note though- with my electric oven, it takes longer than suggested: About an hour.

Wonderful! I made this AS IS and it was great! I made it in 2 9 inch round pans and I did omit the nuts. It failed to rise much in the oven and was sunken down looking in the middle but it was still cooked through and the taste was still wonderful. I will surely make this again. I used the recipe as is for the frosting also, although I didn't measure out the confectioners sugar, I just eyed it and taste tested it!!! I served this up after Easter dinner and it was a hit! Next time I might try it with other suggestions using brown sugar, nutmeg, etc. just to see which way I prefer. But this is worth making!!!

I have made this twice, and it is phenomenal!  First time I made as posted and it was great.  Yesterday I changed it up to make it a little healthier.  I used half brown, half white sugar and used two small jars of carrot baby food plus a half cup oil instead of the 1 1/4 cups of oil called for. It was delish and very moist.  Frosting I used cuts the sugar down: I stick butter, 8 oz. cream cheese, 1 tap. vanilla and only 2 cups of powdered sugar.  People couldn't stop eating it.

Made for Easter dinner & it was great!  LOVE the frosting!!!  I only used 2 cups of shredded carrots - couldn't tell that anything was missing.  Will make again for sure!
Made for a coworkers birthday & got a lot of compliments!  Left out the nuts this time for allergies & no-nut people at work.  Still very good!  I did try a different frosting recipe this time & that was very good too!

What a great, solid recipe- the cake has a wonderful moist texture, and the cream cheese frosting complements it well. I made these as cupcakes, baking at 350 degrees for 25 minutes; made good-sized 20 cupcakes. This may be my go-to carrot cake recipe from now on!

This was my first time making the recipe, so I followed it exactly.  However, I would follow the applesauce substitutions that others have mentioned - it's got a gob of oil.  Less powdered sugar in the icing would also work- it just seems like a TON of sugar.  Also, take the cake out right at the 40 minute mark.  I made the cake last night and when I went to ice it this morning, it seemed a little dry.  I cooked it for 45 minutes and may have slightly overdone it.

This is the first time I made a carrot cake. I made this cake for my son's first birthday. It was gone the same day. I made it into 2 layered cake. It's so good I can't stop thinking about it still now. I'll definitely make it again SOON.

I made this cake for a Palm Sunday dinner with part of our family. It was moist and delicious. The only change I made was using 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce, and adding 1/4 teasp. of nutmeg. I kept the rest the same. The frosting was excellent - very creamy and not too sweet. I will make it again for Easter dinner with the other half of our family. Thanks for the recipe.

i gave this cake 4 stars mainly because this was the first time i've ever eaten carrot cake so i'm not sure how it is 'supposed to' taste. nevertheless, i liked it very much and it wasn't hard to make at all! so 4 stars it is.

Yummy!  Made this just like the recipe says.  I did add coconut and golden raisons and it was super tasty.  The frosting is fabulous!  Made this for my hubby as he wanted a carrot cake and the cake was gone that night.  A keeper.

I made this cake for my mother's birthday.  It was my first homemade carrot cake.  It was much lighter than other carrot cakes I've tried - not heavy at all.  I thought the cake was good, but I wish I had made it a day ahead.  Spice cakes always taste better the next day, in my opinion.  It could have been a bit more moist, but that may have been a result of substituting applesauce for half of the oil.  I've made this substitution with other cake recipes without any problem, though.  I may try a little crushed pineapple (drained) next time to add a little moistness.  The best part of the cake was the delicious cream cheese icing.  It was the perfect consistency - cream without being too thin.  I'll make this cake again, and I think I've found my "go to" recipe for cream cheese frosting!

I had bake this cake for over 3 times now, my family and co-workers loved it, but I have to low the calories for my and my daugther to enjoy without feel guilty, so I had substitute 1 cup sugar sustitute, 1 cup & 1/4 soy oil (in mexico it calls nutrioli) 1 cup whole wheat flour and increase the grated carrots up to four cups, I baked them in tuna fish can's for individual cakes on a cookie sheet for 60 minutes due to the extra carrot added, they turn out fluppy and very yummy. I gave it five starts due to the sustituve ingredients still the same nice carrot cake.

absolutely delish!! I did as others have suggested. I did the 3/4c oil and 1/2c apple sauce. I also used 1/2c of bread/pastry flour to give it a bit more structure. I used the 1/4tsp of nutmeg and an extra splash of vanilla. I ended up making muffins with the batter and baked them for about 12 minutes and i only made 1/2 the icing and it was plenty.

i used this recipe when my inlaws came to our house for the first time for dinner. i made this carrot cake for dessert. its was a great recipe, except the mixture kind of overflowed my cake pans and onto the bottom of my oven. but it tasted great! and the frosting was amazing.

This carrot cake was absolutely marvelous! I added about 1 1/2 cups of sugar instead of the two, just because I am not really a sugar person. When it came out, it was great and very moist! Thanks for that great recipe!

I followed what everyone else had to say.  I added and omitted here and there.  And it came out great.  My husband loves carrot cake and this one to boot.  I didn't make the frosting and it was still good.

I followed the adjustments by other reviewers; added apple sauce, nutmeg, brown sugar, extra vanilla and instead of crushed pineapple, I added raisins that were cooked in orange juice and drained.  I baked it in the late afternoon, served it at night at a party.  Although the frosting was delicious, it didn't wow me or my friends that time.  It was too fluffy and didn't have much flavor.  I was very disappointed and took back the left over which was a lot.  Next night, other friends came over and we tried it again and somehow it was better.  Moist and settled, I guess. So I will give 4 stars instead of 3.  Still I think I wanted it to have more taste of carrot.  I wonder if I should have "packed" the carrot and maybe used organic.

I've made this a couple of times.  I'd say its a 4 1/2 star recipe.  The cream cheese icing needs more cream cheese or less icing sugar.  I highly suggest you bake it the day before you plan to eat it.  It is sooooo great the 2nd day!  Worth the wait.

I've done my fair share of baking and this cake, by far, is the best thing I've ever made! I used the recommended changes that are listed in the number 1 post.  It was very moist and had a well balanced spicy and sweet taste.  Absolutely amazing! I have a new staple for potlucks, birthdays or days that I have a sweet tooth craving!

This was absolutely delicious!!!!  I didn't tweak the recipe ingredients at all.  The only thing I found different was that I had to bake it for 60 minutes.
I would recommend that you line your pan with parchment paper though for easier removal.  My mother-in-law makes the best homemade carrot cake and this is just as good.

Wow, this cake was great!  The only things I changed were to do it in 2 round pans instead of a 13x9, I added about 1/4 c. brown sugar to the cake and I didn't stir the nuts into the frosting, I put them all over the frosted cake.  It looked really pretty and tasted SO good!

Wow! That's what everybody who tasted this cake said! The cake tasted amazing...even better than the one that I had from a bakery. The cake raised beautifully and was extrremely moist and fluffy! And the topping was heavenly, too...turned out awesome! A must-try for all the carrot cake lovers! :)

All I can say is, WOW!  My husband is a really big fan of carrot cake and I just sort of liked it.  Well, not anymore!!  This cake is fantastic!  I did make a few small changes.  I added a teaspoon of nutmeg.  Then I only used 1 cup of oil.  For the frosting, I only used 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar.  But without the changes, it still would have been great.  Very easy to make, also!  Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was delicious.  I was very nervous because our guests weren't exactly the 'veggie' type and I was worried that they wouldn't enjoy 'carrot cake'.  Everyone loved it!  I've read reviews recommending to decrease the amount of sugar in the frosting but I think it is perfect!  I did add extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  And instead of mixing the nuts in with the frosting I decorated the sides of the cake by pressing the nuts into the frosting (as shown in some pictures).

Fabulous, moist, flavorful cake.  Grating carrots is a big, fat, pain...but the payoff is really great.

Very moist and just a right amount of sweetness!  This is definitely a keeper!  I didn't make any frosting and it was still delicious, but next time I will.

Absolutely delicious! I used only a cup of vegetable oil, three teaspoons of vanilla extract and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg as recommended by a fellow member. I sprinkled on some coconut flakes after I frosted the cake with Cream Cheese Frosting II, found on this site.

This was just okay.  I found it rose way too much and took alot longer to cook in the oven.  I cut the oil down to 3/4 cups and found it still to greasy.  Personally I think this would make better carrot muffins than a cake.

I followed gneebeanie revisions, however I would leave out the pineapple next time I made this. I did not like that additional taste at all. Everything else was amazing.

Very flavorful...I changed only a couple things, I used shredded carrots that I bought at the store that way, store bought whipped cream cheese frosting, and I used walnuts instead of pecans and added more than recommended (I love walnuts).  It was excellent.  I made it for my mom for her birthday and she loved it as well!

I really liked it. I added apple sauce as others recommended and I just put 2 cups of sugar instead of 4 cups for topping. It came out really good.I also used walnut instead of pecans.

Very good.Had people over and they loved it.Not too sweet as I would of thought or too oily.Didn't put the baking soda,cause I forgot to buy it, but it was delicious anyway.Think the icing could be done differently without the butter, but I'll try it next time.Anyway I suggest it to try this recipe for those especially that like healthy cakes.

I can't even remember, for what occasion did I first made this recipe, but it was a rioten! Since then I made it many many times with the same result - once it disapeared much sooner on a birthday party than a cake from Hungary's best confectionary :) Thank you for sharing it!

I was given this recipe with a few minor changes and it is to die for! Increased the vegetable oil to 1 1/2 C, decreased sugar to 1 1/2 C, omitted baking powder and added 2 t allspice and 1 C raisins. For the frosting the only change that was made was to decrease the powdered sugar to 2 C. This was even better the next day!

This cake was wonderful. I took the advice of other reviewers and made a few changes: I used 2 9'inch cake pans, 3/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup of applesause, 1 cup of white sugar and 1 cup of brown sugar, 3 t vanilla extract, 3 t of cinnamon, 1/4 t nutmeg, and 1 8oz. can of crushed pineapple (don't use the juice).  In addition to these changes, for the frosting, I only used 3 cups of sugar intead of 4.  You will not be dissappointed in this cake.  My co-worker says it's the best carrot cake that she has ever tasted. It was very moist and beautiful.

Made this for Thanksgiving as an alternative to Pumpkin Pie (since it had all the same wonderful "fall" spices). I followed the recipe exactly and everything came out perfect-O. I took out a couple spoonfuls of frosting and colored one orange and one green and piped out a big carrot & leaf on top.

This is the best carrot cake I've ever had in my life, and it's so easy to make!I followed others advice about using 1/2 c applesauce and 3/4 c vegetable oil + 1 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar + 2 1/2 c confectioners sugar in the frosting. BUT, I also exchaned the pecans for toasted walnuts in the cake/frosting, and it was great. The toasted nuts add a great, richer flavor.

This was my first time making carrot cake and this recipe was very easy and tasty.  I'm making it for Thanksgiving, and wanted to try it out ahead of time.  The frosting was amazing...I had to keep my fiance away from it because all he wanted to do was eat it!!  The cake was very good, but definately needs some more spice.  I added a couple sprinkles of nutmeg, but next time I will add more and another teaspoon of cinnamon.  All in all, this is a great recipe!

My daughter wanted a carrot cake for her birthday so i decided on this recipe. I followed the instructions step by step, only changing some minor ingredients recommended by fellow reviewers. When I first read the reviews, I didn't know what they meant when they said HEAVY cake. Now I know. Mine was so heavy..meaning it weight a ton! Overall, it turned out okay, but I wouldn't do it again, only because it was too time consuming. It's just not worth it.

Excellent recipe for Carrot Cake!  I made this for a co-worker's birthday, and everyone said it was the best they'd had!  I did notice that many reviewers made adjustments and substitutions, but I decided to follow the recipe without making any changes.  The only thing I might recommend changing is the amount of confectioners sugar in the icing.  4 cups made for a very sweet cream cheese frosting.  Half of that amount of sugar would probably be plenty.  I also saved a lot of time by buying a 1 pound bag of baby carrots.  I just tossed them through the shredder of my food processor, perfect!  No peeling, no hand grating.  Try this recipe, its wonderful!

This cake was very moist and would definately makek again.  I used the suggestions from other on using oil and applesauce plus used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup brown sugar.  I forgot to add pineapple but it still came out very good.  The icing you may want to cut down in portion for there was quite abit left over.

My family enjoyed the cake and said it was very good and moist. I will make the cake again but i will add more cinnamon and alot more spice. I also love frosting but would not use the whole recipe for the frosting. The cake just needs a little more spice.

So moist---absolutely the best carrot cake I've ever had---and I wasn't the only one who felt this way.  Everybody who had a slice was blown away.

I followed the recipe,
with these changes I read in other reviews:
1.Substituted 2 cups white sugar for 1 cup brown sugar/1 cup white sugar.
2.The 1 1/4 cups oil changed to 1/2 cup applesauce & 3/4 cup oil.

Also used the larger side of grater to grate carrots.  And put it into 2 8-inch cake pans, shortening baking time by about 10 min., approx.

This cake is just too good. Will be making this one again---and throwing out all the old carrot cake recipes.

This cake came out of the oven and simply smelled heavenly. I made a couple of the adjustments other people suggested, but only out of personal preference. Sent it to my husband's office, and none of it came home!

Best ever carrot cake.  Because I find cream cheese frosting incredibly sweet, I add a teaspoon of grated lemon rind.  It goes really well with the whole cake.  My family wants this cake every Sunday!!!

Awesome recipe! I altered the recipe a little, based on the other reviews. Turned out amazing. Next time I won't make the icing, I found it too sweet even though I took 1 cup of sugar out. Anyways, thanks for the recipe!

Absolutely delicious, i just added an extra teaspoon of vanilla extract as well as the the cinnamon and i didnt put in any pecans. Thanks to another reviewer's  suggestion i only used 3 1/2 cups of confectioners' sugar and it turned out great.

Fantastic recipe.  Practically all who ate the cake asked for the recipe.  Thanks a million!!!
The changes I made was actually opting for brown sugar instead of white (for the cake) - the kids who don't like carrot won't be able to see them when baked.  And I cut down the amount of sugar for the topping to 2/3.  Yet I have enough topping for 2 cakes.  Thanks!!

Really great recipe!  I made some alterations to make it lower carb: substitute flour for 1 c. coconut flour, sugar for 2 t. of bulk Stevia plus 2 t maple syrup, omitted sugar in icing. I also subbed veg oil for coconut oil, used pumpkin pie spice instead of just cinammon (doubled amount) and added walnuts and raisins. Very tasty, will make again.

I was so dissapointed when I made this cake!  I totally expected it to be AWESOME after reading all of the reviews. I used many of the changes suggested by other reviewers - 1/2 applesauce & 1/2 oil,  1 c brown sugar, 1 cup white, etc.   However, mine turned out tasting kind of fishy (maybe from so much baking soda/powder?)and was almost too moist.  It did taste a little better after sitting for a couple of days, but was definately not as good as I had hoped.

I actually had to make this twice, but I'm glad that I did. The first time, I followed the original recipe exactly, and it turned out a complete mess. The middle sank in, and the cake stuck to the bottom of the pan. In my second attempt, I followed suggestions from other reviews - using 1/2 brown sugar, 1/2 applesauce(instead of oil) and adding extra flavoring (cinnamon/nutmeg). I also lined the bottom of my pan with wax paper, just to be sure. The 2nd cake turned out perfectly. I iced with Cream Cheese Icing II and it was a big hit at my Mom's birthday.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I saved time by purchasing grated carrots in the produce section at my local supercenter..talk about a time saver! I also roasted my pecans before starting on making the cake. As I do not care for heavy cream cheese frosting, which I think tends to overpower, I used the Buttermilk Glaze that another reviewer used.

I thought the cake part was great, but the frosting was seriously lacking to me and my family. My cake also dipped, but I didn't care about that so much as the outer part overcooking. I've never had such trouble with a cake before. That said, when it was all said and done, the cake tasted great. I didn't use a cheese grater, I just ended up using the peeler. I used paper towels to soak up extra juice so I didn't end up with a 'mushy' cake. Mine didn't taste like baking soda at all, or fish! It was really good.

Now, the frosting, awful! I used other posters ideas on using less sugar, and it was still bad. 

Next time I will split the cake into two pans, and either find another frosting recipe, or just break down and use store bought. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe. Easy to prepare and straight forward instructions. I used wholemeal flour to give a little texture and a handful of saltanas. If you want a carrot cake that will blow your socks off with flavour this is the one.

This was a very good cake. I took the suggestions of using part apple sauce and part oil, as well as half regular flour and half whole wheat. Also, I cut the sugar in the icing to 3 cups and it was still plenty sweet.

This is absolutley scrumptous!  I made a few changes only because I was short on ingredients and I needed to double the recipe.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar.  I only had enough carrots for one recipe so I used 3 c. grated carrots and 1 small jar of carrot baby food.  The cake is delicious and so is the icing!!!

Fantastic!  Made this for Easter and everyone loved it.  Only change I would make next time would be to 'more finely' chop the pecans used in the frosting.  I used the store bought 'chopped' ones and it was a little too chunky.  This recipe is a keeper!

I had never made carrot cake before, so i was worried, but everyone who tried it said it was the best carrot cake they had ever had! (I also made it with whole wheat flour for a little healthier version)

This came out so good! I used the 1/2 cup of applesauce replacement like everyone else seems to have done. I made it for our Easter family dinner and everyone loved it! Delicious frosting too!

I cooked this today for Easter, it turned out terrible.  I actually had to throw it away.  It was under cooked in the middle and it sunk after I took it out of the oven.  I made this before with half applesauce and it was better.  I will not use this recipe unless I use aplesauce.

Excellent recipe.  I was lamenting that I couldn't use my usual carrot cake recipe because it's packed away in storage back in the U.S., but in the end I am glad to have found this recipe.  Like others I subbed applesausce for half the oil and used half whole wheat flour.  You can't tell the difference and it's less unhealthy. I used cream cheese frosting II from this website.

I used this recipe for my husband's birthday and it was a big hit. I only used half the suggested oil and replaced it with applesauce as others have suggested and added more cinnamon, some nutmeg and ginger. I also left the carrots a little on the big side for texture.  it turned out just fine and although the cake did sink a little in the middle it will not hinder us from devouring it.

This carrot cake was alright. I will make it again but not use soo much oil or sub the oil entirley for applesauce or something. It was just a little too high fat for me and i felt soo guilty eating it that i ended up wasting half the cake. It was good but I will definatly make it again a healthier way.

After reading the rave reviews of this cake, I was sure I had a winner.  I am so disappointed.  I did the recommeded mods.  1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white.  Added applesauce for some of the oil.  I followed the recipe exactly (other than the mods recommended).  The cake was dry and flavorless.  I will try it again though, I am not totally convinced that maybe I messed up or something!

This recipe is amazing. So moist and delicious! I got so many compliments! Everyone who ate it told me it was the best carrot cake they've ever eaten, and two of the people who said this also said that carrot cake is their favorite cake anyway...so I trust they know what they're talking about. Will definitely become a family recipe! Thanks!

This is a really light and not too sickly carrot cake, I did cut down a little on the oil (just a little more than one cup).  I also used the mixture to produce some small cakes for halloween (fairy size) I reduced the oven temp. by about 20C and cooked for just 20 minutes - they were fantastic and went within seconds!

This is the best cake...my dh always says, "you shouldn't make such big cakes for just the two of us...", and guess what...it is gone in a couple of days!  Everytime I turn around he is getting another piece.  I do put a little less oil in though...carrot cake is fattening enough...who needs any extra?  Will make everytime we have leftover carrots...thanks for the amazing recipe...

This was very good.  I used chopped walnuts instead. Next time I will use less walnuts. The frosting was very sweet.  Must have a sweet tooth for this one.

A very moist, not too dense carrot cake!  I added more carrots, decreased oil to 1 cup and used a single serve size of Motts Peach Mango Applesauce (it's all I had, I just couldn't use that much oil!) decreased the sugar to 1 3/4 cups and ommitted the nuts.  The cream cheese frosting is excellent.  I also used less powdered sugar, about 3 1/2 cups.  I will be making again!

This cake turns out fabulously every time I make it--moist and tasty. Olivia loves it, her aunt loves it, Amy and Tiffany love it, and they keep spreading it around. This carrot cake is definitely a recipe to be proud of!

This is the best carrot cake I have ever had! I've baked it countless times and it's always turned out excellent. People who don't even like carrot cake have tried it and they loved it! My boyfriend hides it in the oven so other people can't eat it. Awesome recipe.

This was excellent!!!  I love carrot cake and this was exactly everything that I love about carrot cake.  The only thing I changed was that I did one and a half the cream cheese icing because I LOVE IT!!!  I have made this twice now and probably would have made it more often if I didn't have to grate three cups of carrots!!!!! but it was worth it:)

This cake is excellent! It is perfectly moist and the amount of frosting for the cake is just right (not too much, not too little). I left the pecans out but I am sure that it is equally good with them. Bon apetit!

This was good.  It was a little oily and the batter was heavy...it fell in the middle after it came out of the oven.  But overall it tasted good, and the icing was delicious.

I made this for Easter and it tasted great!!  The only thing I will do different next time is follow the instructions about the 9 x 13 pan because I used 2 round cake pans and my cake fell a bit in the middle but I managed to fix it up with the icing.

I have made this carrot cake many times and I love it. It's very moist and delicious. I prefer using walnuts instead pf pecans though. My husband doesn't like carrot cake (the thought of carrots in a cake) so I share this with family. I did almost get him to try it by telling him it was a spice cake, but he figured it out. Thanks for the great recipe.

I made this recipe for my roommates' baby's first birthday. When you omit the nuts it's quite kid friendly. :) I've also made it with fructose (in the cake, not the frosting) and had it turn out fine.

Cake is very soft and moist, although the middle did collaspe even though I cooled it down slowly.  I used only half the icing, and the amount was just right.

I think this was good, but personally prefer walnuts to pecans in carrot cakes (didn't know that until now).  Also prefer frosting with more cream cheese and less butter.  The cake wasn't as moist as I like either.  But it does have a nice flavor for what it is.

Great recipe, I did change it too though, didn't have any oil so I used 1 C of butter and I used 1c dark brown sugar and 1c white, I also added one zucchini shredded as well as the 3c carrots and some raisins instead of the nuts..very moist and delicious with cinnamon icing.

I made this for my family on thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made seperate minicakes and some with icing and others I sprinkled with confectionate sugar.(gave a fancy touch). When I made the batter it was really thin so I added some more flour. Overall this cake was very moist and yummy. I will make this again.

I've made this recipe about four times now. Every time, it's fallen some in the middle. I might try pairing this frosting with a different carrot cake recipe. Thanks for sharing....it still tastes good, I just can't seem to keep it
from falling.

An enjoyable recipe. The cake came out moist and springy, yum! To make it healthier, I substituted the all-purpose flour with whole wheat and it tasted amazing! I also followed the advice of adding one more teaspoon of cinnamon for more flavour. Excellent recipe! ;)

Amazing!!!  I added 1 tsp. of nutmeg, increased cinnamin to 3tsp. and reduced the white sugar by 3/4 C. and adding 3/4 C. of brown sugar.  I also used 3 tsp. of vanilla in the frosting and reduced the powdered sugar to 3 C.   I believe that even without changes this cake would have been fine.  I made one cake just to keep around in case company dropped by but my family like it so much I had to make another the next week for my brother's birthday party.  I made 2 9" round cakes.  So so so good.  Will make over and over.

I made this recipe for a party and it was wonderful!  I followed what others have said--decrease the powdered sugar in the icing, increase the cinnamon by a 1/4 tsp (I used the Pampered Chef cinnamon), and I added a little nutmeg as well.  I made mine in two 9" pans, and next time, I will make more icing.  My husband ordered carrot cake at a restaurant this week and flat out told me mine was better!

This cake is awesome!! My daughter who doesn't like sweets could not stop eating this cake.  I'd give it more stars if I could.  So versatile too, you can add goodies to the frosting or not ie; choc. chips, coconut, nuts, etc.

Wow, carrot cake!! We made it for my husband's birthday-party. When we mentioned carrot cake, no one wanted to try (in Dutch it doesn't sound very good!)but when the first one tasted the cake.........!! Everyone was surprised you can't taste carrots in it.
I like the frosting very much. The only thing is, I won't eat the cake the day it is made, because the next day it(because of cinnamon & nutmeg)tastes MUCH better!!!

Thanx,
Caroline

Awesome Cake!  I did as others suggested and used applesauce in place of some of the oil and it turned our moist, not too heavy, very flavorful.  Frosting was a great compliment to the cake! Thanks for a great recipe

This is an absolutely delightful recipe, SO yummy in the tummy.  :)  I made the cake late, late night on Friday and by mid Saturday morning, half of it was gone!
I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and it still turned out kudos.  However, next time, I would use less of oil and add more carrots.
I am definitely making this cake again.  :)

Terrific carrot cake!! The only changes I made were to substitute 3/4 cup of the oil for apple sauce and then have only 1/2 cup oil and increase the cinnamon. This makes for less fat and a lighter cake. I didn't remove the cake from the pan and used less frosting.Like others, I left the nuts out of the frosting. I like to refrigerate the cake so the frosting stays thick. Will use this recipe every time!

I followed this recipe exactly as written, but it was very dry. I omitted the pecans and don't know if this may have altered the result (although it is suggested that they can be left out). I will not make this again.

This is the best carrot cake recipe!  I've made this many many times, I've made cakes and cupcakes.  It ALWAYS gets rave reviews.  You can also use store bought cream cheese frosting (I add chopped pecans to them)if you don't have alot of time.  Thank you for this recipe.

I just finished baking this cake and I'm not understanding the rave reviews it is getting.  It just seems bland with nothing really special to it.  I bake quite often and I am really good at following recipes and this one didn't impress me.  The icing was good but I found it wasn't enough.  I also added a touch of lemon to the icing and its really good.  Next time I'll try added raisens and pinapple.

WONDERFUL! I made this for our family Easter dinner and received MANY compliments on it! This carrot cake and frosting were great! The frosting was not too sweet but was the perfect mixture of cream cheese & powdered sugar. The only thing I did different was I added Pampered Chef's Cinnamon Plus instead of regular cinnamong. Yum! Yum!

This is an excellent carrot cake!  The icing is perfect.  My mom prefers this over birthday cake for her!  The only thing I add is a half teaspoon of nutmeg.  I have made this recipe many times, and will make it many more in the future.

Very good. I'm not a big fan of carrot cake but i liked it. I made it because my boyfriend loves carrot cake but is very picky about how it is made. I made this recipe exactly as is and he loved it. He really loved the pecans in the frosting.

This is so delicious! I could eat the whole pan in one sitting. The frosting is a tad bit too sweet but I wouldn't change it as it's a good contrast to the cake. I used 1 cup butter instead of vegetable oil. My husband who is very picky about carrot cake really loved it! Very easy to make. Try it!

Wow. Wow. Wow. I can't help having one more serving after another. The recipe is definitely awesome! The cake tasted just right. Instead of the pecans, I stirred a bit of walnut in the mix and added more to the top of the cake after about 10 minutes of baking. It was done in 50 minutes.
Thanks Tammy!

I made this for my dad's birthday last night and everyone raved. I also substituted 1 cup of white sugar for brown sugar and applesauce for some of the oil. I also added some orange zest to both the cake and the icing and squeezed a bit of the orange's juice into the icing. everyone noticed the yummy orange taste in the icing as well.

Easy to make, came out great, 2 thumbs up from the entire family, even my carrot cake hating husband.  I made one small change:  I substituted the cream cheese for Tofutti Cream Cheese which is a non-dairy cream 'cheese'.   Man!  It was GOOD!

I used 3 cups of powdered sugar instead of 4 cups and omitted the pecans from the frosting only.

I, too, added raisins to my cake and it was DELICIOUS!  My brother, who is very conscious about what he eats and usually passes up dessert completely, came back for seconds and even took a big piece home for later!  That is a HUGE compliment!

Nice texture and good flavor.  I might add some raisins next time.  I didn't put the nuts in the batter, I put them on the outside of the frosting incase anyone doesn't like them, they can be easily scraped off.  I will make this again.

This cake was awesome!  I did make a couple of changes though after reading the other reviews.  I only used 1/2 cup of oil for the cake and I doubled the cream cheese for the icing.  It was great...extremely moist!

I had never made carrot cake before... But now I had 5lbs of carrot I had to do something with!! So I decided to make a cake and I found this recipe... It is REALLY good! I substituted about 1/3 of the oil for unsweetened apple sauce. Also, I had twice the amount of icing I needed. I really recommend this cake to anyone and everyone!

This is the best carrot cake I've ever had.  I made for a co-worker's birthday and got raves over it.  I did, however, omit the pecans from the frosting, decreased the confectioner's sugar to 3 cups and doubled the cream cheese.  It was perfect!!!

Wow!! This is it!! Great test, keep moist for days and the flavor can't be compare! Thanks for a no risk recipe. I added some raisins and drained pineapple chucks tossed first in flour before mixing it to the batter.
I reduced the oil as other reviews indicated and also the sugar on the frosting.
A must keep recipe, everyone in the family loved it!

This was recipe reflects old fashion taste and quality. I made the cake for my family and for our german babysitters to try.. they raved about the flavor, it was a new experience for them.I can not wait to have an opportunity to make this cake for a social function.
