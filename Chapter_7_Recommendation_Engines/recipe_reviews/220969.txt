It was very delicious but you can't let it sit at all before serving as it really congealed.

Made it without the raisins - Picky Eaters - but it worked out lovely - I saw another review that said it congealed but I did not have that happen as it was piping hot when served - All my Xmas Dinner Guests loved it - Thanks!
