So delicious!  I used bread and butter pickles as that is what I had and green onion as I like the milder taste.  I made it with all egg whites--ate it ALL for breakfast by myself.  Delish!

Unbelievable! This tasted better than actual egg salad and it's filled with so much protein. I used less onion (just 1 tablespoon) and it didn't compromise the taste at all! I also added dried basil seasoning. Fresh basil works too!

This recipe provides a great framework, but you should definitely put your own spin on it.  I doubled onion, parsley, yogurt and mustard called for.  I also substituted pickled radishes for the relish because it was what I had on hand.  After those modifications, it turned out great!

Very, very good!  I like the avocado in it.  I felt it needed a little more zest, though, so I added a pinch of cayenne pepper to give it a salty-sweet flavor, which blended with the avocado nicely.  I thought about even adding a tad of cumin to give it more of a southwestern flavor.  I may try this next.  I also only had dijon mustard on hand, which ended up working well.

The recipe by itself was good. I like a little ground celery seed in mine. It was a hit with my husband, he said someone finally found a use for Greek yogurt, because it is gross by itself.

Really good! I added the whole avocado instead of just half, and it was great. A pastry blender worked well to mash everything together.
