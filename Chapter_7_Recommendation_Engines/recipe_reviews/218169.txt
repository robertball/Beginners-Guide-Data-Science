Cake is nice and fluffy, frosting is addictive.  I do miss a little more spiciness and more density. Cake is not dry, but just very light and soft. It just was not what I typically expect in carrot cake.  Next time I would like to use natural peanut better instead of Jif or Skippy, and also pineapple chunks, rather than crushed pineapple.

this was my first try ever at carrot cake and it was PHENOMENAL. both my family and my boyfriend's family absolutely raved over it. the frosting and drizzle topped if off quite nicely. also, based off the previous review, i used chunked pineapple instead of crushed and added an extra egg.
