I did not have all these ingredients so I used parsnips, sweet potatoes and asparagus tips. Instead of the cheese suggested, I used shredded Parmesan, yet not as much as they said. Just a sprinkle, as I was trying to keep it lighter. This dish was truly amazing! Next time I would put the asparagus in at the halfway point because it was a bit mooshy, but truly a delightful dish!! It's great paired with grilled chicken!
