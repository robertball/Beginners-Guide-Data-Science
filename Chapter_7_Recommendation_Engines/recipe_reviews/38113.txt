The whole family enjoyed. I only made half the rice for the three of us. Next time I will add some green peppers or other vegetables and I might add a little more of the chile pepper. Also I didn't cook the tomatoes on high for 10 min. I only cooked them for a few minutes.

I enjoyed this dish. Browned the meat and sauteed the onion, garlic, seasonings, etc. in the same pan. Transferred everything to my slow cooker then added the soup, tomatoes and water. I also added snow peas and bell pepper (red & yellow) because I felt it needed veggies. Cooked on high for several hours & served with rice noodles. Hubby said it was good enough to eat again. Good thing because daughter and I LOVED it! :)

Nice one. I made the recepe without the onion soup and it worked out great. I do recommend to use canned peeled tomatoes or peeld ripe fresh tomatoes not any possible peplacements. The recepe combines beef and ginger something barely found on this site. It's well balanced and I'd recommend it with some full-bodied red. Thank you Jennie

We really enjoyed this recipe. I only substituted a couple of things. Olive and sesame oil for the peanut oil and top round steak for the flank steak. It only took half an hour to cook. Will make again.

I wasn't sure how this was going to turn out. All in all, it was just ok, I guess. I recommend omitting the salt - the soup provides more than enough. I ended up adding a little V8 juice because it got a bit dry. I didn't have time to make rice so I just served it with some steamed broccoli and cauli. I won't be making it again, but thanks anyway!

This was so easy yet still delicious! The ginger root I had only made about two and a half teaspoons of grated ginger... I can't wait to try it next time with the full amount! Yum.

This is an excellent recipe. The flank steak was so tender it was falling apart. Will make this one of my regular recipes.

My family and I really loved the way this recipe came out. I was short on time so after browning the steak strips and the tomato I dumped everything into my pressure cooker and cooked it for 15 minutes and it came out really really tender. Next time I will add even more ginger and maybe a touch of hot sauce. I think the name is not quiet accurate though. It's more like a ginger beef stew.

Nope Not very good. Not terrible enough to throw out but won't make ever again. Not worth the amount of time it takes to make this. I followed the recipe exactly with poor results

This was absolutely divine. Took a while to make but it was well worth it. It was a snowy wintery night when we had this and it warmed us all right up.

I used round steak and it was wonderful. I will add more veggies next time as we like a crispy veggie mix. Great recipe!

We really liked this recipe but I made a few changes.  I first saluted the meat, then added the turmeric, pepper flakes and onions, stirring for about two minutes.  Then I added the garlic, ginger,  some sliced peppers and chopped fresh tomatoes instead of canned.  I don't love onion soup mix, so omitted that and added 3 tablespoons of soy sauce instead.  It simmered for about 5 minutes and was done.  I served it with Coconut lemongrass rice (recipe on this site) and it was a flavourful, spicy and delicious meal!

Made it today with venison. Used 1 1/2 lbs of meat and made it exactly as in instructions. I cooked it 1hour and 30 minutes added a little water after 1 hour. The meat was very tender with delicious flavor. I will make it again. Thank you for the nice and easy recipe.

Everyone in my home loved this recipe. I added green and red peppers and some mushrooms that I had in my fridge. I had to leave the meat to cook for two hours to make it tender.It was perfect!!! This is definitely a keeper!!!

This was delicious! I marinated the meat/veg (I added yellow and red bell pepper) mixture over night and it soaked up all that yummy flavor. I made it exactly as written except at the very end (I couldn't help myself!) I added a tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter and about 3/4 cup coconut milk. Those are big changes but I tasted it before adding those and it was already great. I will definitely be making this one again!

I did not follow the recipe but give it 5* for being a great starter. I don’t have Lipton onion soup stuff here. I read what Sandy did and was like. “Yeah!”  Good news, my technique took about 30 minutes.                  I started the rice. I crushed the garlic, shallots, turmeric and 1chili. I skipped the salt in favor of soy sauce at the table. I sliced the partly still frozen beef super thin then rubbed in the spice with my clean hands which thawed the beef completely. I sat it aside.                I cooked mushrooms, a small onion, a green onion, chopped eggplant and tomatoes in coconut oil made by a Balinese woman (I live there), then at the last minute added a large mild chili, realizing this was going to be more food than expected. I cooked it to the consistency I like, and poured it in a bowl for a moment.       I cooked the spiced beef quickly. As soon as I flattened them out, that side was were done. I turned them over and poured the veggies back on top of it and mixed it.  Twalla.   I brought 3 condiments to the table. It wasn’t spicy enough for me so I added Sambal Asli and soy sauce. I had the kecap Manis which I will probably put on it tomorrow with the sambal asli. (Kecap manis is like a sweet molasses mixed with soy sauce? Maybe.  It’s really good, but I don’t know if it’s available in the States.)

Just made this tonight for dinner. My husband liked it and I will definitely make it again. Didn't have any condensed onion soup so I used part of a packet of Lipton Onion Soup mix. Used some of the reserved tomato juice for the liquid.

So I didn't have some of the ingredients but it sounded really good! I used beef stew meat cut into strips and ground ginger. I only a little onion so I used some bell peppers too. I didn't have any turmeric so I skiped it. I used cream of mushroom soup instead because that's all I had. I also added a little onion powder and some cayenne powder. I like spicy but I didn't add too much. I only had a cup and a little rice but I just mixed it all together and let it simmer. Turned out great! I do want to try the real recipe though can't wait!! Thanks a bunch!!

I made this because it contained turmeric and ginger which are good for you. It turned out pretty good too. I didn't drain the tomatoes and added 1 cup of uncooked brown rice to the pot.

This was quite tasty...a lot of different flavors. After the 'marinate' - which I'd increase next time to a few hours I heated a pan with some coconut oil very hot and browned the meat quickly. So many diced onions and tomatoes produced a soup base so I drained much of it off (keeping it for another day as a yummy tomato-based broth). The pressure cooker worked fine to cook the meat & onions in about 20-25 minutes (my cooker has a three-ringed pin in the pressure stopper that rises with increased pressure. The pin went up to the bottom ring and then I turned it off and waited for it to go down w/o releasing any pressure - the meat was great). My rice cooked with a little chicken bouillon and the canned tomatoes and onion soup provided PLENTY of salt so I didn't add any. As others mentioned the recipe needs veggies. In a separate pan I steamed carrots red and green bell peppers and broccoli (all cut in med chunks) and then added them to the finished (and drained) meat/onion mixture. It was delicious and I'll cook this again. Ginger onion garlic and turmeric are VERY good for you too so this is a 5-star recipe for us!

This was excellent! It's very zesty and if you don't like spicy foods this may not be for you but we loved it! Wouldn't change a thing!
