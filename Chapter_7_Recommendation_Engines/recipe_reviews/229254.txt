This is my second time commenting on this in a week! I made these again in my crock pot, and they came out even better! I definitely recommend doing it that way!

This is a great one. It is simple, but adds a lot of flavor to the pork. I did omit the ground mustard, and used cinnamon applesauce instead of cinnamon and applesauce. Worked well! Great with some garlic-onion mashed potatoes and green beans!

Just made these, and they are soooo good!  Instead of cooking in the oven, I added a cup of apple juice and simmered covered on the stove, and they came out so juicy, flavorful, and tasty!!!  I would recommend this to anyone who is tired of the same old same old pork chops!!!

I'm tired of making pork chops the same old way, with breadcrumbs and either fired or baked. I just tried this recipe and I'm VERY disappointed!

This dish was very good. I made it exactly as called for,but I used an oven proof skillet instead of transferring to a 9x9 pan. Saved washing an extra pan.

This recipe is fantastic!  The pork chops were so tender and flavorful.  The onions and spices mixed with the apples and applesauce were a delicious combination that were the perfect compliment to the pork.  The recipe was easy to follow and quick to put together. This will definitely become a family favorite.

I really loved this recipe. I hardly ever cook pork, so I was afraid I'd overcook it, but it turned out great. Firstly, I doubled the recipe so my fiance and I would have leftovers for the next day. Instead of using canned applesauce, I just bought a few extra apples, diced them, heated on a skillet until tender, and then added about 2 tbsp (i may have gone overboard ;) of brown sugar to make the applesauce (i'm not a huge fan of cinnamon, so I didn't add any to that). Then, instead of using butter to cook the apple/onion mixture, I used vegetable oil. I followed the rest of the recipe as-is, and man did they turn out awesome. The cook time was about 35 minutes in the oven on 375.

Those were awesome, and so easy!  I added a little bit of apple cider vinegar (maybe about 2 tbs) to offset the sweetness in the sauce, and seasoned the chops with thyme before browning them.  I did not have an apple on hand so I left that out and it was still delicious.

What a quick, yummy meal. My husband and teenage kids loved it! Used red onion, added the perfect flavor. Kids don't like onions, however, they never said a word with this dish. Paired it with stuffing, and asparagus. Very yummy, very quick. Thank you!

Although I was a little wary on the onions and apple flavors together I must now say WOW, this is good. The taste is not what one would expect and blend well together. Great for a time starved chef, pun intended. Only change I would make is using a sweet onion type such as a red or vadailia, but this is just my opinion. And for those of us on a low sodium diet like me just leave out the salt, it still was great.

This was delicious! We had some leftover apple sauce (that had been cooked with the pork) that we were able to use in another recipe too, which added a nice smokey flavor.

I tried this recipe expecting to love it but I wasn't sure about my hubby and kids. I was so pleased when the table was completely quiet...I knew then that it was a hit! I received several compliments about how delicious the chops turned out. I will definitely be doing this again. One note I should make is that I didn't have the mustard the recipe recommended so I just used regular mustard and I added cumin to the salt and pepper when I seasoned the chops. Like many others, I also seasoned my chops before browning them.

I changed some things around, but this recipe will be going directly into the menu rotation! I cut the applesauce back to 1c, and used prepared spicy brown mustard, instead of dry.

I also prepared a spice rub, with cumin, salt, pepper, parsley, tarragon, oregano, cinnamon, and cayenne, for the chops. After the rub, they were seared to seal in the spicy flavor, before going into the pan for baking. They turned out moist and delicious, and morre flavorful than I could even describe. Huge hit in my house!

I tried this recipe last night and it was aboslutely delish.  I doubled the recipe since I was using 4 large pork chops.  I also added about a 1/4 tsp of nutmeg as per my husband's request.  I served it up with potatoes mashed up with a tsp of minced garlic, and some sliced carrots cooked in brown sugar & butter.

Very good.  I browned the chops with black pepper and onion powder. I put them in the crock pot. I used homemade applesauce that already had brown sugar and cinnamon. I did add dry mustard ( read it wrong), small amount of salt, little more pepper and onion powder.  Cooked on low for four hours.

I sliced the apples the long way as well as the onions and this dish was so pretty!  My teenage son and husband looked at me with the are you kidding me face when I told them what was for dinner.  They both took the tiniest portion but went back for more!  So tasty and moist!  Perfect for a fall dinner.

Absolutely love this, but because I altered the recipe, I am giving it 4 stars. I reduced the sugar by half and used an unsweetened, drier homemade applesauce and it was still very sweet (I added a pinch more mustard to try to balance it better). It was enjoyed by all.   I will make this again with the sugar reduced further, or skip the sugar and use sweetened applesauce.

Pork chops were tough as leather and tasteless.  Followed the directions to the letter with zero success.  My husband ate his chop, but then he likes Spam.  After a few bites everyone else at the table stopped eating them.

This was a quick tasty dish.  I would add less applesauce & more apples the next time.  The flavor was good but just a little too much applesauce.

We really enjoyed this! I made it w/thin chops only because that's all I had. They were dry but that's not the recipe's fault. Served w/mashed potatoes & steamed broccoli.

Huge hit in my home! I have a picky 11 yr old and 8 yr old. I did substitute onion powder for the onions since they are not a fan of the consistency and they loved it! I have two little babies also, so I like to make foods that are quick and easy to throw together. This certainly was a recipe to do over again and again! 5 stars!

I really liked this recipe especially since I could taste the flavor of apples and cinnamon in the pork chops. I wanted the meat to be very tender so I cooked it closer to an hour. A great entree to usher in the fall season.

This is a great recipe!  My wife is allergic to onions, so I omitted that, and it still tasted great.  The apples were soft, and the pork chops moist.  I'm making it for the second time in two weeks.  It's definitely going into my regular menu rotation.

These were super easy and tasty for a quick weeknight dinner.  The pork chops were overcooked at 30 minutes though, next time i will only put them in the oven for about 20 minutes.  I used a stainless steel frying pan and went straight from stovetop to oven making for easy clean up.

I made this recipe several times and if you add 1/4 cup bbq sauce to the applesauce mixture, it turns out AMAZING! It'll give the pork chops a sweet, savory & smoky flavor- a big hit with the family.

This turned out great. My chops were thick, and I seared the edges on them, too. Followed the directions, checked the inside temp at the 30 minute mark, and they were done. Will definitely make again.

My family gobbled these up! I omitted the brown sugar and used no sugar added applesauce and I'm so glad I did because they were perfect  as they were, otherwise I think they would have been overly sweet.

I tried this  recipe a few days ago .   I forgot to purchase applesauce, so I used apple butter.  The meal was phenomenal!  I was delighted by the tenderness of the chops and the flavor apple butter.

I found that the amount of apple sauce, in addition to the fresh apples, used in this recipe made everything soupy.  I also thought the addition of brown sugar made everything too sweet.

I followed the recipe closely. Have not cooked pork chops much and stayed on the low end of all cook times as it seemed excessive and I don't like overcooked meat.

I seared meat about half the time advised, and cooked just under 30 minutes (recipe called for 30-45 minutes in oven)

The meat was DRY DRY DRY. 

I did enjoy the applesauce mix topping. Will try this recipe again regarding the topping but follow different cooking methods.

Changed up the cooking method slightly (browned chops first in the skillet, then cooked up the onions / apples in that same skillet after). This was delicious! Easy for a week night, and the sauce was tasty and kept the chops moist.

I substituted roasted granulated onion powder and Penzey’s Sunny Paris instead of onion, salt and pepper. If you have chunky cinnamon applesauce you can skip the brown sugar and chopping up an apple.

This was a nice combination of flavor. Maybe use boneless, so you don't have to remove the apples to look for the bone to cut.

This was fair. A nice change from BBQ pork chops. The apples were super mushy, and the flavor was pleasant, but not spicy enough for my taste. Kind of bland. I might make them again, as my two-year-old loved them.

I used olive oil in the place of the butter and since I was using sweetened applesauce I did not use brown sugar.  Very tender pork chops.   I will make it again for sure.

I made this with four 1/2"  center cut chops. There was plenty of the flavorful sauce to go around. The flavor was good, but I think next time I will add a touch of apple cider vinegar. I will make it again.

Even with reduced cooking times, both searing and baking, the pork was overdone and tough as usual. Served with Uncle Ben's Jasmine Rice Express and roasted brussels sprouts.  The rice and the sprouts and the apple mixture went together great and saved the meal in my opinion.  I won't be repeating this one but I have tried lots of pork chop recipes that left the pork dried out and tough so perhaps it's the cut of meat that I will quit buying.

Quick and easy to make, but I didn't care for the flavor. They were too sweet yet very bland, if that makes any sense. They were definitely missing savory undertones. My husband and son said they were good, but, they might have been sparing my feelings. I probably won't make these again. There's too much that needs tweaked.

My only real complaint is that I ended up with a LOT more sauce than I would normally like. I think I'll probably cut the apple sauce in half next time I make it, almost could've gone without and just had the apples. Otherwise a good recipe, I usually overcook pork chops but these ones came out just about perfect. Maybe five minutes less next time.

The flavor profile for these chops is spot on when you are craving fall flavor! I did use only one tablespoon of brown sugar and I used sugar free applesauce and the sauce was still  fantastic. One issue I had was that the chops I bought were 1/2 inch at the bone....and 1/4 inch at the loin. Next time I will ask the  butcher for 1/2 cut chops and not just buy from the case.  
While I only cooked them for 3 minutes in the pan and 30 minutes in the oven they were dry...even with all the moisture. Therefore, if you are like me and like your meat juicy err on less minutes, even with a 1 inch chop. You can always cook it more...but you can't take it back. :) 
Having said all that I will certainly do this recipe again! I served it with roasted brussel sprouts and glazed acorn squash for a nicely balanced taste of fall.

this recipe is definitely a winner, might start making this every week.  I did change a few things.  first, I quickly made some fresh applesauce before starting anything, I think I made maybe a cup. then I sauteed a whole onion and 2 apples in a cast iron pan.  I then seared the pork chops on all sides. meanwhile, I mixed the brown sugar with 1 1/2 teaspoons of whole seed mustard(the good stuff) to the applesauce mixture.  finally, I called the applesauce under the pork chops and baked it for 30 minutes.  the only thing I would have done differently is cut the cooking time. the pork chops can out a little dry but it was no big deal since I had so much delicious onion applesauce!!

Family loved it! Made it as shown in my cast iron skillet. A little rough on my blood-sugar level , but not bad

I didn’t have mustard powder so I used regular mustard and it turned out fine. Just delicious! I will certainly make this again.

I peeled and chopped the apples and onions ahead of time, as well as assembling the sauce.  At dinnertime, I fried everything in an oven proof skillet, making cook time and cleanup quick and easy.  I stuck a couple sweet potatoes in the hot oven while the chops and apples were being fried, then left them there to finish baking with the chops.  A side salad completed this easy, but delicious meal.

This recipe has great flavor and moist porkchops! I would suggest uncovering the baking dish about half way through; as my glaze turned out juicy more so than a thick glaze.  This recipe is ertainly a keeper!

Excellent! I don't know why it took me so long to try this recipe. It was quick and easy to make; and I had all the ingredients in house. It turned out excellent! I will definitely add this to my " Go To" list.

Excellent recipe. I made it as submitted, except I used four pork chops and two apples. I am not generally a big fan of meat and fruit dishes, but I knew pork and applesauce was a classic food pairing, so I gave this a try. I did salt and pepper the chops quite heavily during the searing stage. And I was careful not to overcook the chops in the oven. Very nice dish.

I made a double serving so we can have leftovers tomorrow for lunch and kept to the posted recipe. I use, as you can see, cast iron pans so from the stove to the oven. My girlfriend loved it and I did too!

Love this recipe. As I grew up with plain applesauce on pork chops, found this recipe. Great addition for a more flavourable taste. Recommend.

This recipe wasn't good at all. The flavors didn't blend together. It was too sweet. The pork chops still tasted dry despite the applesauce. We won't be trying this again. :(

Great apple and pork chop recipe, I haven’t made many but this was delicious and moist. I almost missed the directions to “cover it” really glad I didn’t I think this made the difference, as I heard other comments were dry, I also checked it after 20minutes and it was done! Yummy!

I made this tonight and omg was it good! I doubled everything and might have went a little crazy with the onions and brown sugar due to eyeballing the quantities of each. Next time I'll just have to add an extra apple. I think I'll cube the apples rather than slicing them so it spreads more evenly and also use a bit more applesauce.

I also cooked them at 375 for about an hour. Could have used even more time in my opinion. With the apple and onion spread, plus the baking dish being covered, it's hard to overcook the chops or dry them out.

My chops were still a bit frozen after 2 days defrosting in the fridge, which is why I seared them longer and gave them extra time in the oven.

Unlike the oven baked chicken I made the other night, the prep and wait time was well worth it for this entree.

To summarize my modifications:
-Doubled all ingredients (4 chops)
-Extra apples (3 or 4 total)
-Cut apples into cubes
-A bit more applesauce
-Sear a bit longer
-One pinch of salt and pepper on both sides dispersed evenly
-1 hour or more oven cook time

Perfection!

I doubled this for 4 of us and it was perfect!  Moist, very flavorful.  Served with baked sweet potatoes, fresh homemade applesauce and a green salad.  Our guests loved it.  This is a keeper.

My mamma is diabetic type 2 with kidney issues so she is on a very restrictive diet. I substituted s/f applesauce and Splenda brown sugar. Apples have carbs which make sugar so I had to cut those down. But she is a bit picky and she loved it so I will add it to her Davita recipes! Thank you

These were gobbled down with glee so quickly that I didn't have time to take a picture (will have to do that next time)! I used boneless chops and honeycrisp apples. I didn't have ground mustard on hand so I substituted it with a teaspoon of dijon and a pair of crossed fingers. It worked out well, served this dish with green beans and smashed potatoes on the side.

I did have to do some substitutions, not being much of a cook, didn't have everything I needed, so used honey instead of brown sugar and honey mustard instead of ground mustard.  But, it tasted great.  Easy to make and  enjoyed them very much!

Tried this for company at it was delicious! I did read the reviews first and wish that I would have seasoned the chops well before hand, but otherwise it was great! Fork tender and juicy. I serve them with garlic Parmesan mashed potatoes and broccoli.

Delicious! Took other's advice and modified as follows: used 1 c applesauce; seasoned chops when browning with salt, pepper, thyme. Added dash vinegar, mustard, cinnamon to applesauce. Used cast iron skillet on stove then added applesauce, onion, apple and baked for 30 minutes. So good!

This was so easy!  Our chops were very tender and delicious.  The only thing I did differently was to eliminate the sugar since the apples were so sweet.

Very tasty and simple but check it at about 20 minutes.   30 minutes was way too long.

Turned out great! I omitted the ground mustard and brown sugar (I thought it might make it too sweet). I paired this dish with my own baked mash potatoes and sautéed green beans. Definitely going to do this dish again in the future.

Not a fan of this recipe.  I am not a meat eater so I base my reviews on my husband.  He would only eat one of them.  and I'm sure the other will get thrown out.  I tried the sauce and it does need some tweaking but the chops were so bland it 's not worth it.  Sorry

Thank u to all the reveiwers. wow, I really loved this dish but I did make a lot of changes and was glad I read many reviews. I seasoned chops with tarragon, oregano, garlic N onion powder, saltNpepper. I used a granny smith apple for tartness, added a minced clove of garlic, 2 t cider vinegar and sherry, only 1 teaspoon of br. sugar and only 1/3 c of apple sauce. This is my favorite recipe for pork rite now, no wonder apples N pork is a classic. I served it with fresh green beans and roasted sweet potato. Thank u, it was delicious.

So glad I chose this recipe to make for it turned out really good.  My husband like it a lot.  We did not have plain applesauce so used cinnamon applesauce which was fine.  I seasoned the boneless chops before browning them.  Served with asparagus and stuffing.
Cooked on 325 for almost 35 min. Definitely will make this dish again!

Unfortunately I didn't realize I didn't have some of the ingredients until I had already starting cooking.  I did not have the mustard, brown sugar,  cinnamon, or apple.  I used 4 pork chops instead of 2 & just doubled everything else in the recipe.  I also seasoned the pork chops with salt & a good amount of pepper.  They turned out wonderfully (I was worried about missing several ingredients)!  They were so moist & flavorful.  I actually impressed myself (lol) & my guests were very happy.  It was easy to make, and ready in about an hour.  I definitely recommend this recipe.

This is a great option when you need something different to do with pork chops in the winter.

Made this without chunks of apple. I used very thin pork chops, heated the oven to 350 and placed everything in the oven just for 5min mainly for heating the applesauce glaze up over the pork. Made the meal a 30min dish! Served it with corn and horseradish-mashed potatoes! Turned out great!

This was a huge hit!  I had 4 pork chops, so I doubled the recipe, but otherwise made it as written.  Loved the flavor, and the pork chops were tender and moist.  I'll definitely make this one again.

This was fine for a weekday meal. I made the recipe as-is.  I found the pork to be tough, and the applesauce/apple/onion mixture was like soup in the pan, but there was a nice glaze on the top. Maybe I overcooked them to explain the toughness (40 min).  I would consider this again, but may use the skillet method instead.

The recipe was fairly easy to make and delicious.  I would sear the pork for less time and bake it for 35 minutes.

I think the only thing different I did that helped with flavor is to season up the chops with salt and pepper before searing.  Other than that, great recipe!

The apple/onion/applesauce mixture was delicious, but the pork chops were dry on the inside. I followed the recipe as written, so I browned them for a total of 10 minutes before baking them. Most skillet pork chop recipes I've seen cook them for 5-8 minutes total (even without baking them after), so if I make it again, I'll brown them for 2 or 3 minutes per side next time. Hopefully that will keep them from drying out.

very tasty and tender pork chops! I followed the recipe until the end. After browning the cops in the skillet, I added about a 1/4 cup of chardonnay and reduced that with the brown bits in the pan. Then I added the sauce made from the applesauce, apples, spices and onions and let that simmer for a bit. Then I poured that over the cops in a baking dish, covered it with foil, and baked in the oven for about 25 min. It was absolutely fabulous! My kids loved it and said the fish was a nice change from my normal tough, oven-fried chops! #momwin

I made this exactly as written, even thought I might have overseasoned, but....I gave 3 stars because my family said they loved it, but for me it fell a little on the "bland" side, if anyone has any idea how to make it better, I am definitely open to suggestions. I've always wanted to try Pork chops, and apple sauce, because they are  supposed to compliment each other well. But was too afraid to try till tonight,  it looked and smelled awesome, but I just couldn't really taste the apple or sauce at all...is that the way it's supposed to be? I may try in a crock pot or with a tarter apple, does anyone know if that makes a difference? Anyway, was a success with most, I guess I just like a little more savory flavor with a meat dish.  Thank you for sharing, it WAS quick and easy.

No leftovers here! Made this tonight for dinner and the whole family loved it. Made it with three pork chops and doubled the sauce (I like extra sauce)  We had gone to the apple orchard and needed to use up extra apples, so I made my own applesauce with a splash of apple cider , so it may have been a bit more watery than store bought. Even though I over did the pork chops a bit, my six year old son asked for seconds and thirds and was even dipping his green beans in the sauce.

The pork chops turned out really moist and had a good balance of sweet and savory flavors. I only added a few things. Prior to adding the pork chops to the pan i sessoned them with lawrys sessoning salt and thyme. I also used spiced apple sauce. I have tried the recipe as is but definitely like the addition of the thyme better. Great recipe!

Just made this for dinner.  As a few others,  I just continued to cook on the stovetop, covered, rather than in the oven.  I put garlic powder, salt, pepper and thyme on both sides of the pork chops before cooking them.  I doubled the sauce...which is really delicious.  I like flavor in my chops, and these were not so much, and they tended to be a bit chewy, but not dry.  I've decided that next time I will use shake n' bake, or panko and herbs and cook the chops in the oven and the sauce separately and then pour the sauce over each chop before serving.  My sig other really liked it, however, tonight.  I'm more hard to please...I know the chops can be more flavorful.

It's not that these were bad, they just weren't to our taste.  I did add some apple cider vinegar to the recipe based on another review, but we found them a little too sweet.  The chops were very tender however.

Husband said this is a "keeper." I came across this recipe looking for something to do with the 3 loin chops (not thick like recipe recommends) I had in fridge. I was in a bit of a hurry to get it ready and didn't have my glasses on so missed the "peel" the apple part, but it didn't take away anything and actually gave it a bit of color (it was a red apple). Followed all the directions (except for peeling) and as I added the apple mixture to the top of the browned pork chops, I realized that I did not have enough liquid in the bottom of the pan to keep it from burning, in my opinion. So I quickly grabbed white wine out of the fridge (don't know how it got there) and splashed about a 1/2 cup (or so) into the bottom of the pan and let it "simmer" just a bit to "deglaze" the pan. Put the lid on and put in oven on 200 degrees for 1-1.5 hours, since they were not thick loin chops. They were tender and flavorful. Made pasta to help slop up the sauce/au jus.

I generally LOVE pork and apples together, so I was really excited to see the recipe.  But, my chops were quite overcooked after 30 minutes, and the applesauce was just too sweet directly on the pork.

I used this recipe and made 4 boneless pork chops. I doubled all the ingredients (only used 1 apple). However, I managed to over cook the chops. Did 5 minutes on each side then baked for 30 minutes at 375. Still edible, the apple mix was perfect, just enough salty & sweet. The husband loved it!

Made this recipe. I doubled it because I used 4 pork chops. My husband said they were the best pork chops he has ever eaten. They were so tender, juicy, and flavorful. Very easy to make.

This was good.  I made in the crock pot and omitted the mustard.  I also used red onion as someone else recommended.  I only had unsweetened applesauce, which I think is what the recipe was lacking in the end, sweetness.

Made this without the onion. They turned out tasty. My son is a picky eater and he loved the apples. They also turned out moist. In the future, I will cook them in a crock pot.

Love this recipe! I didn't have an apple this time so I just went with the rest. Also, no need to bother with another dish to clean. Simply use an oven proof skillet . Great!

I was looking specifically for a recipe with pork and apples to mimic something I had in a restaurant once as a kid, and this came pretty close! I used unsweetened applesauce and a Macintosh apple. The only mistake I made was tossing in a sliced green pepper that needed to get used; that changed the flavor more than I expected, so next time I'll just follow the recipe. It was a little sweet but pretty tasty!

Easy, Simple and Delicious! I omitted the ground mustard just because I did not have any, and I added a pinch of thyme for a bit more flavor. It was the perfect easy dinner when cooking for one!

I used home made Pumpkin Spiced Apple sauce. I also did not have the mustard powder, so I excluded it. My wife and I dug this so much. We will make again.

This was very good. In my opinion applesauce and pork are meant for each other. I didn't have any ground mustard so I threw in a bit of paprika. The aroma from this dish is heavenly. Even my son who didn't like the idea ate two chops!

Just fixed this tonight.  The applesauce was delicious (we didn't add onions), but I found the pork chops dry.  Overall it was good, but I will probably try a different recipe.

This was very easy and quick to put together. It definitely wasn't bad, but I wasn't that into the onion flavor with apple. Next time, I think I'll do without the onions or maybe just try it with less.

It tastes pretty good but not that great. I think I have concluded that after trying out various apples and pork recipes, I am after all not a fan of that combination... But if you are, this might be a delightful recipe for you.

Great recipe!  My husband and I loved it! Only things I did different was that I seasoned the porkchops with salt and a little garlic powder while browning in the skillet and I used cinnamon applesauce instead of regular applesauce.
