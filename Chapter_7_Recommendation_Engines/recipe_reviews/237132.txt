I'm giving this 5 stars for one reason: my kids LOVED it. They thought the pancakes and bacon together was awesome, and they loved the syrup/sauce. If I were to rate this for the adults in my family, it would be a 4-star recipe. It was good, but nothing special. I'd just as soon eat my bacon on the side. The only modifications I made were: 1) I added a little extra flour to the batter because I thought it was too runny, and 2) I cut the long bacon strips in have and made regular round pancakes around each. Thanks for the fun idea.

FLEURDELISAHOLIC - I found your review offensive - was it really necessary to make the comment about stupidity? Shame on you.

I just made this for everyone this morning and everyone really enjoyed it.  I did, however, add a wee bit more flour (as another reviewer suggested). We really liked the syrupy peanut buttery sauce - yummy!  For the person who gave this recipe 5 stars without even trying it YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF.  It's not fair for you to give a rating/review when you haven't even made the recipe.

Cutting the bacon strips in half made the pancake size more manageable. Combined with the peanut butter syrup this was delicious!!!

My son absolutely loved the pancakes. I did not make the sauce.  I however did put additional pancake mix on-top of the bacon.

Very easy to make and tasty. Hubby did say the sauce was a bit too peanut butter-y.

Made it this morning with rave reviews, for the syrup. Really that's what this recipe is about. I didn't measure (didn't want to clean measuring cups of pb), but just added the syrup ingredients to the pot, until it was the consistency I wanted. I used my own (whole wheat) pancake mix, and did cook the bacon on the side (picky eaters). But we ended up dipping the bacon in syrup or crumbling it and adding it to the top of the pancakes. Thanks for sharing! Will definitely make again.

This recipe was O.K. at best. The sauce was flavorful, but way too thick. I would either use less peanut butter or more syrup if I were to make it again. Also, I would do what another reviewer mentioned, cut bacon in half and form round pancakes. The long cakes are difficult to turn and in my first batch, the bacon separated from the pancake. Very cumbersome. Also, it was extremely rich and I am a HUGH sweets eater so that's saying something from me.
