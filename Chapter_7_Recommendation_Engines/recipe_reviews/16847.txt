I had no red wine vinegar so I put the spices in with the vegetables while they cooked and then tossed with plain olive oil. Very easy, very good. I also added mushrooms and asparagus. yummy.

I love pasta and veggie dishes like this. I didn't have either color of bell pepper but my kids don't like them anyways. I didn't add the two full tablespoons of red wine vinegar just a splash.

I used my own choice of veggies, 1/2 large eggplant, 1 zucchini, 1 red pepper, 4 small portabella mushrooms, 6 large olives all chopped and 2 garlic minced.  This recipe is the best pasta primavera I have ever made.  I sprinkled a little grated romano cheese and it was delicious!  Definitely make this again!  YUMMY!!!

This was excellent but I did change some things.  I didn't use any peppers or broccoli.  Instead I added zucchini, leeks and carrots and I have to say it was a great choice I also skipped vinegar and used canola oil (about 1/4 of a cup) instead of olive. I added parsley and a sprinkle of cayenne pepper to the oil/herb mixture.  Great and healthy recipe and an awesome way to use left over pasta.

Tried this recipe as a simple and quick Friday night dinner for the family.  

I took the advice of others and cut down on the amount of oil (I used about 4.5-5 Tbsp.), and I thought that was enough, though I might consider adding just a splash more vinegar next time -- it adds a nice component to the dish that I would have liked more of (especially since I added a sprinkle of non-dairy parmesan, which further dampens what the vinegar adds). 

It takes a while for the dried herbs to really integrate with the oil/vinegar, so definitely make the dressing first. We used carrots, mushrooms, yellow squash and zucchini as our veggies.

Dish's flavors are kind of mild/subtle for my taste, so I also added a little garlic salt when cooking the veggies. Also added grilled chicken breast tenders on the side. With the sprinkle of parmesan at the end, the result was yummy and satisfying. We'll be making this again. Good recipe!

I love the taste of the final product. I am a novice cook, however, so chopping all the fresh vegetables took me longer than I would have liked. I'll definitely start chopping before I'm hungry next time.

Quite good!  I used a little less olive oil - 4 Tbsp instead of 1/3c - which was plenty, I thought.  I also put a lid on the broccoli for a couple of minutes to steam them a bit, so they were softened, but still toothy.  We added a little shredded Parmesan cheese, which really made the flavors pop.

This tastes great, I think I will be making it often! It was fast and easy. One thing I love is that I always have the ingredients on hand. I always have frozen broccoli florets and frozen chopped peppers in the freezer. I always have carrots and jarred garlic in the fridge. I always have some type of noodles (this time I used egg noodles), the herbs and the red wine vinegar in the pantry. So thankful for a recipe that doesn't require me to run to the store. I imagine that you could use any veggies you like, and any shaped pasta. Thank you!

This was very, very bland. I followed the directions, but I had to add a lot of extra seasoning, oil and salad dressing.  And it still wasn't quite right.  It needs something like a chicken broth or another added flavor but I'm not sure what.

This is very good and nutritious, but Oregano is a very strong herb so I only added 1/2 tsp and it was more than enough. Also, I cut the olive oil down to 1/4 cup.
Pretty simple recipe that is easy to tweek based on the veggies and pasta type you and your family enjoy. Simple but very filling and delicious!

We made this recipe, just as written and it was very good.  Only 4 stars because I felt it could use a little less olive oil (just personal preference).  The recipe itself is very flexible as you can use many different types of veggies.  Next time I will use fresh spices instead of dried and maybe add some grated parmesan cheese Mmmmmm.

I made my own tomato sauce using tomatoes that I stewed in olive oil and then added basil oregano and garlic powder. That way it was healthier and had a great tomato taste. I also added zucchini, broccoli and carrots and and sautéed them all together. Delicious!

This wasn't anything extra special, but I liked it. I made it pretty much as written, except that the broccoli was only slightly blanched as I already had everything else going by the time I noticed that ingredient. This made a good amount, enough for several meals, and I always like rotini. It was only slightly odd in that this reminded me of somewhat similar cold pasta salads, except that this was served hot. Filling and fairly healthy, and it was worth trying.

Love this recipe. Used zucchini, summer squash, carrots, mushrooms, and baby corn. The herb and oil vinegar is a great combo. Very versatile recipe.

This recipe was excellent. The ratio for pasta and vegetables can be tweaked a little - more vegetable/pasta ratio. 

The bell peppers, carrot, and broccoli cooked nicely, nice and tender. 

I also cooked the rotini pasta for 2 extra minutes, than the specified 7 minutes.

It turned out great! Will make it again. Just with more vegetables next time.

I had some vegetables that needed to be used so I roasted them the day before...I tend to buy more than I can use at the farmers market.  I was looking for a quick pasta dish to  use them in and came across this one.  I added parmesan  cheese when I served it.  Great way to use just about any vegetable...

A solid, simple recipe.  I was afraid the vinaigrette would be overpowering but it was just right as is.  I added onion, shrimp and parm cheese and it worked out very well.

My two kids recently had to go without dairy due to a virus so this was a great dish for their needs! I didn't think it would be as good as it turned out to be. The only thing that would have made it a 5-star rating would be adding some chicken or grated cheese to it for a little more dimension.

My family really enjoyed this.  I added smoked turkey sausage because my husband always wants meat with a meal.  Perfect addition.  Will have this again and again.

Good basic recipe. Peppers were not the best addition but it's easy to see how you can adjust this to your liking and whatever you have available. Good staple.

My husband loves this so much...he says he would eat it "all day long, hot or cold."  And so easy, plus I use up all my leftover veggies!  Thanks for sharing!

this is a great recipe, it is so versatile. the second time I made it i added smoked angus sausage and cooked the veggies in the pan i used for the sausage. gave an incredible smokey flavor. I also switched up the red wine vinegar for balsamic vinegar.  WOW. this was great!!  I will make this all the time.

This recipe was the reminder I needed for simple pasta with veggies.  Like the intro says, use pretty much whatever veggies are in your fridge or garden. Asparagus is in season where I live so that was my go to then added the peppers, garlic, carrots and some snow peas. For 4 servings I would not cut back on the dressing and I often use white wine vinegar instead of red for a lighter flavor.

I loved it but I made a lot of modifications.  I left out the vingar, carrots, and brocoli.  In place of those things I used a fresh roma tomato for moisture, fresh baby bella mushrooms-sliced, and lots of fresh spinach.  After I removed it from the heat I add LOTS of parmesean.  I appreciate the idea and love it after I fine tuned it for me and hubby.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  I can see adding other protein to it for variation.  I cut down just slightly on the oil for the vinaigrette but that was it.  Will definitely make it again.

really liked this, though I did add more red wine vinegar because I like the tangy flavor.

Instead of broccoli I just add some feta cheese on top of each bowl after serving. A great meal that doesn't take too long to make.
