I took the advice of the reviews and went for more flavor so I omitted the tomato sauce and paste but used diced tomatoes with chilies. Added a cup of heavy cream, mushrooms , Italian cheese mix, red pepper flakes, Italian seasoning and seasoning salt instead of regular salt. It was a hit.

I was a little leery about trying this recipe since I don't usually prepare kielbasa in a red sauce, but I'm glad I gave it a try.  It was a hit with my family and we all agreed that the 2nd day leftovers were just as good (if not better).  I will definitely make this again.

Sausage Stir-Fry w/ Bow Tie Pasta Haiku: "A keeper indeed. Made mine like a casserole, did ahead of time." I didn't change a thing about this recipe other than prepping in advance and putting it in a large round Pyrex dish; w/ a little Parmesan and mozzarella sprinkled on top, I put it in oven at 350 for about 25-30 min. just to melt the cheese and re-warm it through. UMMM Wow, I know that my method defeated the quick purpose of the "stir-fry", but we really loved this meal!

Only gave it a three because the sausage added some flavor. Otherwise very boring and bland!! Would not make again.

WOW, what a great flavor.  I did make a few changes.  I got most of it ready and stirred it into a big pot. I also added black olives. I greased up a casserole dish and turned the oven on at 375. I poured it into the casserole dish and, added chedder cheese to the top. I baked it for 30 mniutes.  Fantastic and will definitely make again.

We really liked this. I had a lot of  tomatoes, so I replaced the diced tomatoes & paste with diced fresh. And I made cauliflower rice instead of pasta. It was a delicious combination. I would definitely make this again.

This is not a good recipe as is. First off the picture shows a pasta dish with no red sauce. I'd highly recommend replacing the canned tomatoes, tomato sauce and tomato paste with 1 cup of chicken broth instead. The red sauce is not cooked long enough to have any flavor develop and the flavor it does add covers up all the good flavors from the sausage, mushrooms, olive oil, etc.  I would not reccommend this as is.

Pretty much followed the recipe as written and it turned out really well, but I did use two 12oz sausages  and probably not enough vegetables. Leftovers seemed to have too much pasta and not enough everything else. Was best when made fresh, but leftovers were good. Will make again and again as whole family enjoyed it!

I followed the recipe as written, except I omitted the mushrooms since I'm not a big mushroom fan.   My husband and I thought it had great flavor, a nice amount of heat, and it was pretty quick and easy to make.  I will definitely make this again!

I substituted broccoli instead of mushrooms and squash. Used two pounds of kielbasa.  Also used about 8 ounces of chicken broth and served over brown rice.  A big hit with my family and leftovers for later!

Very good! Make sure you have a big enough skillet though One thing I'd probably change is instead of using just 1 package of sausage, to use 2!
