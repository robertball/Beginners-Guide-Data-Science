I have never added citrus to my homemade apple juice, always mixed with raspberry, cranberry, etc. but this was delicious, thanks Swchef. Kids enjoyed as is, I enjoyed with a little extra-liquids. I loved this recipe before it became famous.

I made this for neighbors at Thanksgiving and they took some to their friends.  I heard they all raved about it.  My neighbor reduced the leftover cider and used it to baste a pork loin roast.

The amount of orange juice overpowered this.  More like orange cider.  But I'd try it again but much less orange juice.

This turned out nice, but I did leave out the grapefruit juice; I just thought that would be too sour. I added extra orange juice to make up for the grapefruit, but I wouldn't do that next time. I added extra cloves. It was a nice warm drink.

As is, this recipe is not very sweet. I feel it tastes better with an extra 1/2 cup or full cup of sugar (depending on your sweetness preference).
