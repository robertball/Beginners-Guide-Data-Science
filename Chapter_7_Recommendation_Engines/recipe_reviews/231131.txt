This was a fantastic sauce. I halved the recipe for just the two of us, but kept the chili sauce at the original amount. I threw in some fresh parsley also. Was great on grilled salmon and fruit kabobs (and half was plenty for three filets, and six kabobs). This would be terrific on chicken or pork also. A keeper in this household!

This is off the hook! Made it and put it on some spare ribs, baked them and wow. I'll never buy or make another sauce. Thanks!

Love this sauce! I am a vegetarian and I use this sauce when making a Korean BBQ sandwich for my family. They all love it including the 7 year old! It's a little spicy so I go light for the kids.
I strain the sauce before using it too.

Great, nice balance of flavors. I used half the siracha and it had just a nice hint of heat. I also used splenda brown and that worked fine. I marinated boneless chicken thighs in bottled teriyaki (overnight), then grilled them and hit them with the sauce the last couple of minutes and passed the sauce at the table, everyone loved it. One suggestion - you really do not need to make a slurry with the cornstarch/water and add it in. Just stir in the cornstarch with everything else before you put it on the heat and it comes out fine.

Fantastic sauce! I scaled it down to two servings to try. It produces a nice, thick sauce after you boil it. When poured over some stir-fried some veggies (onion, celery, mushroom, broccoli), it liquefied more and all was great over rice. Would be good to keep on hand in the fridge to throw something together when you're short on time using chicken, beef, seafood, or pork as the author mentioned. Thanks for sharing your recipe, holmes416. It's a keeper!

4-Star, as I save 5-star ratings when my socks are blown off... this recipe didn't so much.    I like oriental, and this marinade/sauce was very good...the end didn't look like the picture, as mine was thicker (too much corn starch maybe?), was pretty sweet and salty (I added more vinegar to cut down the sweetness, and next time will use low-sodium soy sauce).  One tbsp of Sriracha was just right, as I like heat, maybe next time add a tad of chili-garlic paste to up the ante.  Marinaded sliced pork sausage and veggies, skewered them, and grilled the works....was quite tasty.  I based the kabobs as they grilled and warmed a small bowl of marinade as a dipping sauce.  Doing all of this, the flavor wasn't overpowering.  Next time, I'll make the adjustments as mentioned above.  If you enjoy oriental food, try this sauce ... a nice base to venture on to be creative.

It was amazing though I added a bit of thai sweet chilli sauce to it. I made it for hamburgers with grilled mushrooms and it knocked my socks off.

Literally made an account just to comment on this recipe. I lived in Florida for a couple years and was absolutely addicted to Tropical Smoothie's Korean BBQ Steak Tacos; I moved back North and there aren't any Tropical Smoothies around. This recipe makes for a perfect recreation of those addictive tacos. I used powdered ginger instead of fresh, but otherwise completely followed this recipe to a T. Perfect balance of salty, sweet, and acidic.

I recommend using this to marinade thin strips of beef, then combining that with cucumbers, kale, shredded carrots, and scallions in a flour taco shell. To die for.

We did a side by side comparison and this was much better than the bottled sauce from the grocery store (much more flavorful).  I followed the recipe exactly (made a half-batch but stuck to the proportions listed here.

Amazing recipe! Added an extra 1/2 tablespoon siriacha for an extra hot experience, result was awesome. Boiled it for about 6 minutes but going to extend the boiling time for the next batch to get an even thicker sauce.

I put a little bit more siriacha in there for a bit more heat. I used it on chicken wings at my last BBQ. The next day two of my buds called me and asked about the sauce...Fire!

Easy as pie. Used it as a marinade for  yellowfin tuna, then grilled the fish.  Left the cornstarch out for the marinade. Made a second batch as directed to serve with the fish. Came out excellent!

This sauce is delicious! I made it as written (I did add some toasted sesame  seeds at the end) and it was so flavorful. My only recommendation, no additional salt is needed in seasoning either this sauce or whatever you are applying this sauce to. It was a little salty for my palate and I feel like I have a fairly high tolerance for salt. To use this sauce we added a red onion and chuck to a crockpot poured this sauce over cooked for 8 hours, took the beef out about an hour before serving, shredded it, added it back to crockpot. We made tacos but would be a delicious sandwich or served with rice or potatoes!

1 cup of soy sauce sounds like way too much sodium. I’ll try a few tablespoons and see how that works out.

I normally buy a shop bought brand and forgot to get it......this is by far the best recipe - I was short  on brown sugar and added two tablespoons honey. ...... would give it 10 stars if I could.  Went so well with my pork tacos.

I made this sauce today, doubled the recipe and thought I had it perfect! Not so fast, my friend! I really struggled getting the flavor profile but kept working with it until it was down right delicious. The black pepper was way too overpowering so if you don’t want a peppery flavor, back off on the pepps. Other than that, it’s a fantastic sauce. Extremely versatile and I will definitely make it again.

I've used this sauce recipe forever and I've always loved it. I add 3/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup water to reduce the saltiness a bit, but I've always done that. Also, if you're having trouble with overly thick sauce, it could be your climate. Since moving to a high altitude, cornstarch just acts funny with me. Try making a slurry with 2 tbs all-purpose flour and a bit of water instead of using the cornstarch, I've found that it doesn't over-thicken.

I had some sliced smoked pork butt to use and I wanted to make Korean barbecue sauce quickly. The sauce was great. I even made it in the microwave. I brought it to a boil in the microwave, stirred up the cornstarch and water, stirred into the sauce and then cooked it by about 20 second increments. When it was completely stirred in then I let it cook for about a minute in the microwave and it thickened up nicely. I added some Korean chili powder to it to make it extra hot. Then I put it over my meat and broiled it. It was delicious.

I've made this multiple times and every time have loved it. Whenever I make it, I put it on chicken and noodles. The first time I made it I used rice noodles. I excluded the chile-garlic sauce as I'm not too much of a fan of spice. However, the rice noodles seemed to soak in all of the spice from assumedly the pepper. Even with that it tasted great. The second time, I used spaghetti noodles for lack of any others. And the last time I made it, I used lo mein noodles, and they tasted amazing! Great recipe.

I didn't have a cup of soy sauce, so I used half soy and the other half teriyaki sauce. Also used Thai chili sauce for the heat. Sauce was wonderful!!!

This is so good!   I like a little more heat so I added more Sriracha and more red pepper flake.  Thank you!

Overall good ingredients for the sauce, however, 1 cup of soy sauce is far too much. Even 1/2 cup made it salty. I doctored it up with at least 8 tablespoons of cornstarch and water to thicken it up. The taste was not bad. Definitely recommend over rice and beef

Used less sugar - 1/2 cup and doubled rice wine and sesame. Saves in the fridge well.

I usually don't follow recipes, but I followed this one exactly, as I have no experience with making a Korean BBQ sauce. It turned out absolutely wonderful!!! I do love cooking Asian cuisine, so these were all ingredients I happened to have on hand, so that was an added bonus. I used it on some baby back ribs and I wanted an alternative to the super sweet, thick, ketchup based BBQ sauces that are popular in Texas where I live and this was perfect. The only tips I have to give are to add the chili garlic sauce last because you can add less or more depending on your personal spice preferences. I personally liked the amount that the recipe called for, but I would consider adding more depending on the dish. Also, fresh ginger can be put in the freezer for months without going bad or losing its flavor, so it's easy to keep on hand. Thanks for the great recipe!

My first impression of this bbq sauce is:  Intense!  I did use low sodium soy sauce, but the soy flavor was still very, very intense.  I liked the balance of the other flavor additions, but I would cut back on the soy to let the other flavors shine more.

I would have given this five stars but the apple jelly made it too sweet.  Next time I make it, I won't put it in.  I also used reduced sodium soy sauce.

I made it as stated, and used it over bone in pork chops in the slow cooker, 4 hours on high and 1 hour on low. The meat falls off the bone reminds me of Maui Ribs .    Great over rice or vermicelli noodles, just add your veggies of choice.   House smells awesome as well!

I made it just the way it is. I used half of it for a veggie stir fry and it was great. Later in week  my daughter used the other half on a large salmon fillet and baked it. The family loved both dishes.

Made this sauce to serve over kalua pig for a weekend luau and it was delish!  My new favorite Asian sauce.
Great combo of garlic, ginger, hot pepper, tart and sweetness.

I used coconut aminos in place of soy sauce- less salty that way.

This was delicious!  Everyone loved it, even the fussy kids.  I used VERY loosely packed brown sugar and it was plenty sweet.    The only change I made was I used rice vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar, since I didn't have any, but I love the taste of rice vinegar so I use it in everything.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved the recipe but too salty. I added puréed apple and plum to balance the salt.  Next time I will decrease the soy sauce to 3/4 cup.  The fruit gives it a flavorful balance.

I made this with thick strips of tenderloin pork.  After I sautéed & browned the pork I added all the sauce ingredients right into the pan.  I did cut the recipe in half for the 2 of us, kept the chili sauce the same, added less brown sugar, and did not add any cornstarch.  The sauce nicely thickened and caramelized without it.  We thought it was great and very similar to our favorite Korean restaurant item.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I made it exactly per the recipe - it was VERY hot!!!  I toned it down with a bit of lime juice, ketchup, coconut cream and peanut butter.  Not really the recipe anymore, but a great start !  Perhaps you could start with just 1 tbsp of minced garlic . . .

I knew the moment I read this recipe I was gonna love it.. And I was right! Made exactly as written (used low sodium soy sauce). Mixed up the sauce (minus the cornstarch) and poured over my back ribs in the slow cooker. Cooked on high for 3.5 hours. Removed my ribs and placed on a foil lined sheet pan and skimmed the fat of the juices and sauce and placed some in a small saucepan and let reduce for about 15 minutes. Thickened up with cornstarch and brused on top of my ribs. Cooked ribs in a 400 degree oven for 15 minutes to crisp. Will be making again :)

This was very good! I halved the black pepper and chili paste because I was concerned it would be too hot, as we eat our rice with Sambal, I will try the full amount next time. The weather did not cooperate for me to BBQ so I baked my ribs in the oven at 250 degrees for 2 1/2 hours, drained off the drippings, poured the sauce over the ribs, and continued to bake for another 2 1/2 hours turning the ribs over and basting about once an hour. Enjoyed by my family, thanks!

I absolutely love this Korean BBQ sauce.  I use it on salt and pepper wings and cannot get enough of it!  I did not use the optional chile-garlic sauce however used ground red pepper for the heat.  Super good sauce.

I made this sauce for the first time around two years ago and since then it has become a regular addition in our meals.  The sweet and spicy combination is fantastic!  We've used this on fried rice, hibachi style meals, grilled chicken wings (they've been the best we've made, and my favorite on roasted broccoli.  I like the versatility of this sauce and will continue to use it again and again.  Fantastic recipe - so glad I stumbled upon this!

This is the best recipe for an oriental-style BBQ sauce that I have ever tried.  I had a chicken teriyaki recipe that we loved, but after trying this, I don't think I will ever make the chicken teriyaki again!  Followed this recipe with the exception of the sesame oil (didn't have any).  Did not substitute the oil with anything else and it turned out just fine.  I poured the sauce over 10 bone-in, skinless chicken thighs and let it bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  AMAZING!!  Thank you for the recipe!

I used garlic powder and ground ginger instead of fresh to make the sauce less chunky. I am not a fan of biting into bits of garlic or ginger lol but it was still AMAZING!

Wow. Made this and used it on beef ribs and it is fantastic. Cant wait to try it on pork ribs which I usually smoke. Nice kick to it.

Delicious recipe! I like to cook a pork shoulder in the crock pot and make mini Korean BBQ pulled pork tacos using wonton wrappers and an Asian salad. Top with this sauce and OOOOHHHHH MAN! That's good!

Loved this sauce. Was just a bit too much garlic for me.  Put it on a apple marinaded pork tenderloin and smoked with Applewood. I let it grill very slow and basted with the sauce.  FANTASTIC!!!!! Next time, and there will be a next time, I will use only one tablespoon garlic and go from there.

I have tried this twice, both times on ribs that got overcooked.  The sauce seemed  too salty and peppery.  I need to try again without overcooking the meat.

Delicious! We had this with Pork ribs-amazing taste. When I made it I didn't think it smelled too good and I was nervous about trying it, but it turned out to taste so good! This will be my go-to recipe for BBQ sauce from now on.

Outstanding and simple. I used mine with diced firm tofu. I substituted orange juice for the brown sugar.

Pretty good. Put this on a thick pork steak cooked on the grill and was real good. Kinda sweet, a little spicy, a little Asian. Good stuff.
