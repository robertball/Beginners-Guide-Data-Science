Yum! I added more powdered sugar because I needed a larger quantity. Fluffy and yummy. Also used it in homemade oatmeal cream pies.

I admit that I was skeptical about a buttercream that uses SO MUCH butter and SO LITTLE powdered sugar! However, the marshmallow creme stirs in like a dream and adds a fluffiness that I've never see in a buttercream! This frosting melts in your mouth and the almond flavor is delectable. I was looking for a delicious, light textured frosting for delicate, tiny sandwich cookies I'm making for a wedding. This is marvelous, and I will use it again and again! SIX YEARS LATER: I’ve used this incredible buttercream recipe for every single cake I’ve made, from my signature carrot cake to my grandchildren’s birthday cakes, and it ALWAYS turns out perfect, makes a huge quantity, tastes delicious, decorates beautifully! I just made it again today for my carrot cake! A lifetime recipe, in my opinion! (At times I use 1/2 almond extract and 1/2 vanilla extract, just as my mood dictates.)

I was so excited to try this recipe.  I love marshmallow and buttercream so I thought this was a match made in heaven.  I was so disappointed.  It was so sickening sweet, I wouldn't even use it as-is.  Even having read the reviews, I used short cups of powdered sugar, so probably used about an 1/8 - 1/4 cup less than the recipe called for.  In an attempt to salvage all these ingredients, I bought another small jar of marshmallow cream and folded that into the frosting.  That did help mellow out super sweet powdered sugar taste a little.  My advice to anyone making the 1st time it is to add only 2 cups (or less) or powdered sugar.  Then at the end set maybe a 1/4 of the butter/sugar mixture off the side.  Add the marshmallow cream to the remaining butter/sugar mixture.  If it not too sweet, fold some of the butter/sugar mixture back into the marshmallow cream mixture.  That way you can better control the sweetness level.  This recipe makes so much, you probably won't miss any extra butter/sugar you don't use. If you have extra, you can always adjust your recipe for next time.

I've made the version on the Land o Lakes website for Lamb Cupcakes. I love the consistency, taste, and the fact that it's pure white so easy to dye. Also, nothing needs refrigeration, so leaving leftover frosting out isn't a concern. The proportions on their site are 1.5c butter, 2c powdered sugar, 2 tsp vanilla, and 2 (7 oz) jars marshmallow creme. I'm going to try adding cocoa powder for a chocolate version, so I'm glad to see someone else had success with that.

My new go-to cupcake recipe-  Pipes beautifully.  To make Mocha Marshmallow cupcakes add cocoa in with the powdered sugar and a bit of espresso powder.  I add powdered sugar in until the consistency seems right, usually more than the recipe calls for.  Makes a lot, I frosted 50+ cupcakes generously.

good recipe I did tweek it a bit. the first batch I followed directions exactly, it didn't hold shape very well and I found out I didn't like almond extract. so I used vanilla instead and used 1 cup of butter and 1 cup of Crisco holds shape alot better and didn't hurt the taste.

With my changes this is a five star recipe, and the BEST white frosting I've ever tried! Normally I don't like to rate recipes after I've made so many changes, however this gave me such a good base that I wanted to share. Also there was plenty of frosting for my cake which I made in a 9x13 pan. Now for my changes: first I only used 1 cup (2 sticks) of room temperature butter, decreased the confectioners sugar to 2 cups, added 1/2 tsp of "clear" vanilla (instead of almond), and only one 7 1/2 oz  jar of marshmallow cream. I mixed the butter and confectioners sugar together until well blended, then added the vanilla, mixed again, lastly I added the marshmallow cream and blended it together with my mixer. This was easy and ready to frost my (cooled) cake. This frosting came out white, soft, and was very light (not a heavy frosting at all). It was a BIG hit with my family! This is definitely now my go to recipe for white frosting. I might even try adding 1/2 cup cocoa powder for a chocolate version next time. Enjoy!
Even though I made many changes I want to thank Staci for sharing your recipe. I never thought of adding marshmallow cream to my buttercream frosting, and I think it made all the difference. :-)

Good, but extremely sweet for me, and I normall love sweet desserts. It didn't really have a marshmallow taste to it at all. I may try to take away half a cup of the confectioner's sugar and use only 1 cup of butter for a fluffier frosting with more marshmallow taste.

Oh, and this recipe leaves you with enough frosting to do a huge double layer cake!

This is one of my favorite recipes for frosting! For most it is extremely sweet, but when paired with a less sweet chocolate cupcake, it makes the perfect match! One thing I would change though would be folding in the marshmallow creme. I found that when I only folded it in, the icing separated. Instead I mixed it for a couple seconds and was pleasently surprised that it held together much better! Hope that this was helpful!

I am not a frosting person, but i decided to give this a try...and OMG I LOVE this frosting!!! I was making a caramel frosting for a banana cake so I added some homemade caramel before adding the marshmallow and it was AMAZING. I will make this pretty much every time i need frosting. It is HEADS AND TAILS BETTER than any other frosting i have ever had..EVER.

I was afraid that the marshmallow creme would be hard to incorporate, but, it folded in beautifully.  This is a really soft and fluffy frosting!  I don't think I would use it as my go to icing, but, it was good and the hint of almond was a nice touch.

Made this to top the birthday cupcakes my son took to preschool today.  It was very easy to make and so fluffy. When I picked up my son after school the preschool teachers immediately asked me for the recipe for the frosting and admitted to each eating two cupcakes because it was so good. Thanks for the great recipe.  This is my new go-to frosting.

This makes a LOT of frosting.   I put this on a 9x13 cake, and had about half of it leftover.  I used it on a cake called, "Too Much Chocolate Cake," and it was Heavenly.   BUT under the cake, I put a graham cracker crust.   This made it like a S'mores cake!
It was a hit, people loved it.

I liked it. But, I really thought it was really buttery. I could definitely taste the buttery. Either less butter more more sugar.

New favorite frosting recipe! It's easy and delicious, much lighter and fluffier than regular butter cream frosting and I love the marshmallow flavor. Followed the recipe exactly but subbed vanilla for almond extract since I hate almond extract. Piped it onto cupcakes.

This frosting is sweet, but it is also fluffy, buttery and full of flavor. I used clear vanilla rather than almond as I was frosting a red velvet cake. This recipe makes a huge amount. Probably enough for a triple-decker cake. I'm not sure how often I will make this because of the fat content, but I really love how it tastes and looks.

OMG this was the most amazing buttercream that I have ever made!!  The marshmallow cut the sweetness down.  Kids and adults loved it. I just added 2 tablespoons of corn starch. I didn't refrigerate this icing all day.

There is no way you need 2 cups of butter! That’s all I could taste was butter & my niece who is 6 yr. old said the same thing. I have to believe the writer of this recipe meant 2 sticks of butter. I’ll try it again but this time I’ll use 2 STICKS of butter.

Thank you Staci!  I halved the recipe and I still had enough to frost a double-layer 9" cake.  The frosting comes together beautifully within minutes.  It didn't have a strong marshmallow taste, so the next time we make this we will double the marshmallow creme.

Yum and yum! This is a really tasty frosting a bit messy to make but well worth it. I did cut it in half to just frost a regular 9x13 chocolate cake. I also added about 2tbs of milk just to loosen the frosting a bit.  Will certainly be making this one again.

It comes out very loose. If you are piping it I suggest adding more confectioners sugar... a lot more. Taste is okay. I was hoping for something more marshmallowy.

I did 1/2 recipe for a boxed cake mix  in a  13x9 pan.  It is amazing!  Make sure not to soften the butter too much or it will be too thin.  I did 1 stick butter, 1C confectioner's sugar, 1/2 tsp almond extract, one 7 oz container Marshmallow creme.  I thought it tasted great.  It is a bit of a sticky mess, though, and I had some go flying since it creeped up the electric beaters but other than that was delicious.

This is probably the best buttercream I’ve ever had. So good! It comes out perfectly stiff for decorating, and was the perfect amount of sweetness. The recipe didn’t specify what kind of butter to use, so I used salted sweet cream butter, and it turned out great.

I love this recipe. I use it the most frequently for cupcakes and cakes I make. For my birthday cake this last year, I made a chocolate dream cake and even added some vanilla instead of almond extract and I added cocoa powder and some heavy cream to make chocolate marshmallow buttercream! It was delicious!!

This has been my go-to frosting recipe for nearly two years now. I used it for my wedding s'mores cupcakes and everyone raved over it. I now use it for every cake I make because I find regular buttercream far too sweet and overwhelming. The marshmallow cuts the sweetness and creates a beautiful fluffy frosting without the cloying sweetness of traditional buttercream.

Yummy. Used coconut extract and added toasted sweetened coconut flakes to the frosting at the end. Baked a lemon Bundt cake and piped in lemon curd throughout once cooled then frosted. So good.

This is super easy to make, but it makes a heck of a lot of frosting.  I actually used 1/2 the butter/powdered sugar/extract, and I used all of the marshmallow cream.  Nice, fluffy frosting that was the perfect amount for an oblong cake.  I used this on a homemade banana cake and topped with crushed walnuts.

Best frosting ever! Made this frosting to top the Hershey's "Perfectly Chocolate" chocolate cake. My husband isn't a huge cake person but once he tried the frosting g he couldn't resist and even had seconds.

I didn't think that I would like this because of the marshmallow. (I put it on chocolate cupcakes for my Granddaughter). When I tried it, it was really good! It didn't really have too much of a marshmallow taste! Plus it was one of the easiest buttercreams to pipe, and it looked pretty on the cupcakes. I didn't have any almond extract. I just used vanilla.

Light, fluffy and flavorful! I was looking for something lighter than buttercream for French Macarons. This works so well with the light meringue consistency of the macaron. I cut the recipe in half and used 1 teaspoon of Madagascar vanilla. No marshmallow taste at all. This recipe is a keeper.

AMAZZZZZING. I used about 1/2 the marshmallow fluff than called for, because it was all I had. I also added vanilla extract because I'm addicted to it.  I used this as the top layer for my Oreo cheesecake parfait cups. It was DELICIOUS!   One tip: make absolutely sure the butter is room temperature. This will not work well if you try to half soften it in the microwave  (you don't want any MELTED butter in it, and you don't want any hard chunks either).  This is now my ONE & ONLY frosting go-to!

This is the perfect icing for piping onto cupcakes!  I made 1/2 the recipe and it was enough for 18 cupcakes, with just a little left over.  I used vanilla extract instead of almond and sifted the powdered sugar, but other than that kept the recipe the same.  Looked great on the cupcakes and tasted great too!

I halved the recipe to cover a 13x9 cake. Love this frosting! I was looking for a frosting that would hold up to an outdoor summer party and this fit the bill. Very fluffy, light and delicious! I wanted to just spoon it in my mouth.

As with any frosting, I added the sugar gradually to suite my taste, and probably ended up using 1 1/4 cups. With the fluff(that's all I could find I)found I only needed half. Great addition to some GF carrot cupcakes:)

I made 1/2 the recipe.  My husband loved it .  Just being the two of us I often make a square cake for us.   He requested Marshmallow icing thinking I could not do it.   Just so happened I bought marshmallow topping  for his ice cream so looked this one up and I'm telling you he lick the bowl clean.

INCREDIBLY light and fluffy, the almond extract was a perfect addition and the frosting was just like eating a marshmallow. I used it to make s'mores cupcakes (chocolate cupcakes, this frosting, and graham cracker crumbs) and it was a big hit amongst me, my family, and neighbors! However, this recipe did make a lot more frosting than I thought, I had a ton left over after frosting 18 cupcakes, but considering how tasty it was I think I will have no problem finding a use for the rest!

I used 1 1/2  cups of butter instead of 2 cups and 2 cups of confectioner sugar instead of 2 1/2 cups.  I also used about 1/4 tsp of almond extract and 1 tsp of vanilla. I prefer vanilla over almond.   It was very easy to decorate the cake.  The consistency was perfect!

This is a very good frosting.  It is even better if a person uses half brown sugar and half confectioner's.  I use it on top of caramel cupcakes and it works very well, though I do use vanilla instead of almond extract.

Good base, I subbed vanilla for the almond extract, and I ended up adding a bit of milk to fluff it up. My son also wanted an Oreo cake, so I crushed up a bunch of Oreos and mixed those in with good results. A little too buttery for my husband's tastes, but I liked it.

It was more like cool whip than frosting. I substituted Almond Extract for 2 tsp of Vanilla Extract, because my best friend is allergic to tree nuts. This recipe was for her.

I feel like I did something wrong here, but I triple checked the recipe and I followed it to a T. I wish I had left out the almond extract, as it's a pretty strong flavor. I made this for a s'mores cake and I wish it had more of a plain marshmallow flavor. Should have listened to my gut. I also ended up using way more sugar than the recipe called for (probably almost seven cups), because it just tasted like butter. I am someone who hates oversweet frosting, so go fig. I am going to try this again, but am going to try less butter and no almond extract.

What a disaster.  I piped this mess onto cupcakes straight from the freezer and it immediately puddled.  I was tempted to add more powdered sugar before I ever folded in the marshmallow cream and I definitely should have.  This recipe needs serious revision.

I wanted a good icing for a "orange creamsicle" cake I was making and thought this would replicate the cream part of the popsicle.  Overall this recipe fit the bill! I halved the recipe and only used 1 cup of the confectioners sugar so it wouldn't be sickeningly sweet. The icing was nice and fluffy and really really good!

I chose this because I wanted a marshmallow frosting to go with a marshmallow Peeps decorated cake. And oh my goodness, so delicious! I will definitely make this again. It might just become my regular cake frosting, it's that yummy.

I have not tried to pipe it yet but it seems a good consistency to do so.  Its a bit on the sweet side, but once put on the cake I think it will balance out.

I did make a few changes. I ended up adding about 1.5 times the amount of powdered sugar because it still tasted too buttery before that and was really loose. I also added vanilla instead of almond extract to give it a more marshmallowy flavor. It turned out wonderful!

Marshmallow creme is already very sweet, so I cut the confectioner's sugar over half (about 1 cup total).  It was still very sweet.  I like the idea and how simple this is, but I will cut down the confectioner's sugar even more next time.  Probably to about 1/2-3/4 c.

I recommend reducing the portion of margarine or butter to 1 1/3 cups. 
I altered other ingredients portions:
2 cups of fluff
2 2/3 cups of confectionary sugar (sifted)
1.5 tsp of ow-fat milk to add a creamy consistency to the mixture (in place of all the spread)
1 tsp vanilla ( an absolute must!)

The absolute best frosting ever!  I am not a fan of frosting at all. However, I like whipped because it is so light, but buttercream decorates beautifully. This was a prefect happy medium. It decorates well and it is so light and fluffy without being too sweet! I also tried it with 1 cup cocoa powder to make chocolate. It was wonderful as well!

This frosting came out great!  With the amount of butter it called for, I was unsure if it would taste too rich...came out nice and light and paired well with a chocolate cake my son and I made:). We topped it with some graham cracker crumbs and called it our s'mores cake:)

Delicious and super easy to make. It is both buttery and sweet. If you use quality butter it will not be white, and it is very soft: I didn't try it in a decorator bag because it was so soft.

Based on the recommendations of other reviewers, I tweaked the proportions a little: I used 1 1/2 cups butter, 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar, and a 13 oz jar or marshmallow creme, and it turned out to be a delicious, fluffy icing that I would definitely use again. I also used peppermint extract in place of the almond to go with some chocolate peppermint cupcakes, but I think almost any flavoring would work. One recommendation I would make is to definitely use unsalted butter. I didn't because I only had salted on hand, and the icing ended up slightly more salty than I like. Overall, I think this is a great, versatile recipe that is easy to tweak to suit your personal tastes.

OMG! Love it. I have been looking for a good buttercream icing and this is it. I read the reviews before making, and cut out a cup of sugar, as I can't stand really sweet icing. It was awesome and I may even leave out another 1/2 cup of sugar next time.  This recipe rocks!

I made this as instructed with the exception of vanilla extract instead of almond. It was wonderful!   We used this as the filling for homemade oatmeal cream pies and everyone loved it!  I will definitely make again...maybe for chocolate cupcakes next time.

I used this recipe for a Girl Scout camping trip.  After we made cupcakes in a box oven, we made the frosting using 1 extra cup of powdered sugar, vanilla instead of almond and 50% more marshmallow creme.  We made chocolate too by adding 2/3 cup cocoa to another batch.  We topped with a small marshmallow, 1 hershey chocolate bar square and a pice of graham cracker.  They were awesome s'mores cupcakes!  This frosting is wonderful.  Everyone was asking for the recipe!  Will be making it again!

Incredibly sweet and decadent!  I used this as the filling for homemade twinkies and it was fabulous.  I used the Mamon (Sponge Cakes) recipe on this site along with my twinkie pan and made the best "twinkies" in the world.  I'm actually going to make a cake and use this as an old fashion icing, just on the top with fruit to cut the sweetness a little.  Some reviewers posted that is was too sweet but that's the point of frosting, right?  My husband ate it right out of the bowl.  Very good and will use again.

I used this on a lemon cake that had lemon curd filling. Everyone raved about the combination. It has become the most requested cake.

This frosting came out as a liquid, not a frosting.

I made this as a filling for whoopie pies.  I used my stand mixer for all but the marshmallow cream, then folded that in by hand.  I as worried it would be difficult to fold in the marshmallow, but it was surprisingly easy.  This frosting is delicious and works very nicely as a filling.  My family loved it and said it was better than the last time I made whoopie pies with a different filling.  I will definitely make this again and again.  The marshmallow seems to lighten the buttercream.  I substituted vanilla for almond extract, otherwise, followed the recipe to the letter.

This is a relatively easy recipe. I personally thought the almond extract was a little strong. I'm thinking I'll cut it back to a half teaspoon next time. I also added a half cup of cocoa powder. I didn't even have to add any additional sugar. I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.

Not only did this come together easily, it piped beautifully and covered about 30 cupcakes with extra swirling. It's light and fluffy and not too sweet. I didn't let the butter get to room temp, just sat out for a couple hours.

This was great - I cut the recipe in half and used it for sugar cookies at Christmas. The kids loved them.
