After reading the reviews I did the following - I bought 4 lb pork butt - a less expensive cut of meat.  I put the meat and broth in the slow cooker for 10 hours, shredded it right away (it shredded very easily) added 1 1/2 bottles of barbecue sauce and refrigerated it overnight.  The next day I put it back in the slow cooker for a couple of hours to reheat.  It was delicious, easy and inexpensive.

This is how I cook my bbq pork.  Recommendation for those who have used pork tenderloin, boneless pork chops, etc., - you're using an expensive cut of meat when the cheap cuts work as well.  Honestly, the pork will be very tender and the flavor rich.  It only takes a small amount of work to remove the bones & fat.  The meat itself remains reasonably lean.  You will save much money by trying the pork butt, pork roast, etc.

The way i made this turned out excellent!  I used approximately 5.5 lbs of pork ribs with the bone since i coulldn't find boneless.  

I made my own sauce from a Taste Of Home recipe i have for pork ribs.  Plain bottled sauce seemed like it wouldn't taste good.  

The recipe i used for the sauce is:

1/2 cup cider vinegar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup ketchup
1/4 cup chili sauce
1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce
2 tbsp chopped onions
1 tbsp lemon juice
1/2 tsp ground mustard
1 clove garlic, minced
dash cayenne pepper

Combine all sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally.

Here's a really good modification of this recipe.  Throw your pork in a slow cooker with no liquid (or maybe a little water if it's a really lean cut) and cook until it's done.  Then shred it and pour in a bottle of good vinegary barbeque sauce and most of a can of cola, and leave the top off the slow cooker (should still be at high) for about an hour to thicken the sauce.  This takes out the oven step, and the soda in it is surprisingly delicious.  Of course it smells so good I can hardly wait that last hour, so I sometimes speed things up in a big skillet.  Enjoy!

Really, really good.  Again, I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I make it and this time I was glad I had.  I was very tempted, like others, to just throw the sauced meat back into the crock pot--I mean, why mess up another pan, right?  Well I think it made a big, positive difference to the final product.  The time in the oven kindof browns the tips and makes it seem more like meat done on the grill.  I'd never used Sweet Baby Ray's before and it was good with the pork.  It was a little sweet, obviously--I may use Bullseye next time for a more savory change of pace.  I will definately be making this again.

Wow this BBQ was a huge hit.  Following the advice of my butcher I used Boston Butt instead of boneless ribs.  I cooked the meat for 8 hours the night before the party, drained and shredded it and stored it back in the crockpot overnight in the fridge.  About 4 hours before the event I added the Sweet Baby Ray's (don't settle for kc masterpiece - yuck) and some of the left over stock drained from the crock the night before.  So amazing, I will be making this again!

I followed the advice of another review and cooked the pork for 10 hours, pulled it and drained the broth, and then let the pork marinate in the BBQ sauce over night and reheated it the next day.  I would suggest the beginning part (cook the pork in the broth for about 10 hours and then pull the pork/drain the broth) but then I would mix the BBQ sauce right in and just warm it up....then eat it.  By marinating it over night and reheating it the pork became mush and there was hardly any texture.  I am a big texture person, so it was hard to eat that way.  I would rather have bigger chunks of pork than mush.  Otherwise, this was amazing, especially with the original Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce.  I would highly suggest making this and we will be making it again!

This recipe is impossible to screw up...also, everyone we've tried this (about ten times)on loves it.  After experimenting a bit, we've settled on the following: pepper then brown pork (shoulder or butt cut) chop med - large onion, put in bottom of slow cooker with browned meet on top, then pour on 1/2-3/4 bottle of smoke/bbq sauce, cook for 8-10 hours, remove bone(s) and large pieces of fat, shred meat, put back in the cooker, mix with the leftover bbq sauce then switch to high for 1/2-1 hr.  serve on rolls with beer

I used this recipe and the ideas of Jan's (submitted Feb.2001). It was absolutely delicious! Used a boneless shoulder cut of pork since it tends to be leaner. Peppered and seasoned pork using Lawry's seasoning, browned the meat. Chopped med onion added to bottom of slow cooker. Added one can of beef broth and 1/2cup of your favorite BBQ Sauce (a good sauce also makes the difference in taste, we prefer a sweet/spicy sauce)-cooked in slow cooker on low for 3-4 hours, until meat was tender and ready to fall apart. Drained broth, shredded the meat, mix rest of BBQ sauce, cooked to desired temp. approx 1/2-1 hour in cooker. This is definately a repeat recipe in our home for many years to come!

I made it the first time just as this recipe calls for and it was ok. I was expecting more than the bbq sauce having to give it the flavor, and plus my husband was not even interested in taking a 2nd sandwich. the second time i made it i used a 3 lb boston butt (pork shoulder) and rubbed it with 1tsp of each- seasoning salt, ground black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and sage. By the way sage goes great with pork! Then i put it in the crock pot with only 1 cup water. Didnt use beef broth because of the extra salt, water works just as perfect. let it cook on low 6-8 hrs until its fall apart perfect with a touch of the fork. take it out and let it sit for 10 minutes and discard the cooking liquids. Shred it up with 2 forks or your fingers. put it back in the crock pot, coat it with BBQ sauce (sweet baby rays :-)) and let it sit for 1 more hr on low. My husband will now eat half the pot!

Having made a variation of this many times, I can say that the step of cooking the meat in beef broth is unnecessary and though I did do that this time, I noticed no difference than had I not. I have always cooked the meat first with nothing added, shredded it, then returned it to the slow cooker with the BBQ sauce to cook another hour or so. I can also say that this is as good as the barbecue sauce used. In this case, I agree with hubs' comment that it was the "Jim Neely's Interstate Barbecue Sauce" we brought back from Memphis that made this so tasty.

Wow, this came out awesome.  I used 2lbs of Pork Roast Butt.  I did everything else nearly the same.  I increased the time in the crock pot by 1/2 hr on low, in addition to the 4hrs on high.  I also didn't have a cast iron skillet  or pan so I put the pulled pork in a prepared with Pam casserole dish.  My husband said it was the best pulled pork he ever had! He orders this all the time at restaurants and now said he doesn't like the restaurant ones nearly as much as this homemade version.  He had it again for breakfast the next day!  It was gone before you know it!   He said he wants me to make this for him every week.  It was so easy to make, the only thing that took any time was pulling the pork apart with forks.  This was no effort and no time.  I love this recipe and so does my husband.  Thank you for posting it!    UPDATE:  I made this again several times, but this last time I used a beef chuck roast, 2lbs and WOW it was so good!  We had friends over and they just died over how freakin good this is and how easy!  I did nothing at all different!  I just made sure that when I pulled apart the beef I got rid of as much of the fat as possible and it was super wonderful.  Also, I used 3 different BBQ sauces,  about 16ounces for 2 lbs each time I did this.  The extra BBQ sauce is real important because when it goes in the oven for the last 30minutes (which you gotta do to get those brown tips, mmm) anyway, in the oven step, the heat from the oven sucks out some of the juices.

I love this two step method of cooking - the slow cooker makes it tender and the black skillet oven time enhances the texture and provides those delicious little "burnt ends" that we all love. A good tip: after removing the meat from the slow cooker and pulling it and blending it with the sauce, I add about 1/4 c of the juices from the cooker to the meat before turning it into the skillet (which I already have hot by warming in the oven during the pre-heat.)  This aids the charring and caramelizing while helping to keep the bulk of the meat juicy tender.   Taste is subject to your seasoning and sauce; for mine I use half Bull's Eye Original and half Moonlite BBQ (local specialty from Owensboro, KY) plus 3T molasses or brown sugar, and 1T Frank's hot sauce for a spicy-sweet flavor. I also add one whole sweet onion (sliced very thin) to the slow cooker pot before the meat goes in, plus 1/2 tsp liquid smoke to the beef broth/ beer / cola.  No matter which cut of meat I've used, or which form of liquid, as long as I've stayed true to the method, I've ALWAYS produced a crowd pleaser with this recipe. Thank you KMB233 for sharing!

Super Good!!!! I used a pork butt instead of the ribs -- cheaper and just as good, as others have mentioned.  I omitted the beef broth, as my butt had enough fat on it already *blushing*.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I used Sweet Baby Ray’s bbq sauce (my fave) and did the oven thingy.  I think baking it in the oven for the last 30 minutes is a crucial step; it just gives it a wonderful texture so it’s not so soupy after slow cooking all day.  I served over toasted hamburger buns, with a green salad on the side.  Even my 17 year-old-daughter (who hates everything and everybody) loooved it :)  I would definitely make this again.

This continues to be a family favorite - to the point where I gave both of my adult sons a cast iron skillet, a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce, and the recipe typed on a card as an extra Christmas gift.  It's delicious,and easy.  Using a pork butt is the trick -- cheaper and meatier.  One son prefers Jack Daniels BBQ sauce. I would suggest having the bottle at the table as well.  I cook it for 10 hours on low and the meat shreds perfectly - comes out a bit chunky, which is what I prefer.  The last 30 minutes in the oven is the trick -- the sauce sticks better to the pork.  My mouth is watering as I'm typing this!

This was absolutely delicious! I used a 4 lb. pork butt which was less expensive and just as good. Seasoned the meat generously with salt, pepper and garlic powder. I then sliced one onion and put it under the meat with the beef broth. After 5 hours on high the meat shredded beautifully. I mixed 1 1/2 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce into the pulled pork before putting it in the oven as directed for 20 minutes. Do not skip this step! The sauce caramelizes and becomes the perfect consistency. I served the pulled pork on potato roll buns with a side of baked beans. This was better than any pulled pork I've ever had before. I had a house full of happy guys.

The recipe I used for the sauce is: 1/2 cup cider vinegar --- 1/2 cup brown sugar --- 1/2 cup ketchup --- 1 tsp chili powder --- 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce --- 2 tbsp chopped onions --- 1 tbsp lemon juice --- 1/2 tsp ground mustard (substitute with premade mustard) --- 1 clove garlic --- dash cayenne pepper. Threw sauce and pork ribs in slow cooker for 6 hours then I shredded the meat. Last of all, I made the drippings thicker by adding cornstarch after cooking the pork.

This recipe was amazing!  My guests all went back for seconds, but I did make a few changes.  I used 4 lbs. of pork shoulder, which I rubbed with a mix of the following:  3 tablespoons brown sugar, 2 tablespoons Emeril's Essence seasoning, 1 tablespoon salt,1 tablespoon ground cumin,1 tablespoon paprika,1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper,1 tablespoon cayenne.  I let it sit overnight, then cooked it on low for 9 hours with 1/2 can of beef broth.  Then I strained the liquid, shredded the pork, removed the bones and fat, mixed in a bottle of bbq sauce, and then put it back in the slow cooker until warm.  Served on potato rolls with cole slaw and corn and black bean salad.

I don't often use a crockpot, but this is one recipe that I will keep.  It is perfect for days when you know that you will be late getting home and yet you still want to feed your famaily a good hearty meal.  Just add a tossed salad on the side and maybe some corn and you're good to go. I make my own barbeque sauce in gallon quantities that I am partial to. Before I started making my own sauce, I found that Sweet Baby Ray's is one of the best on the market and am sure that it would definately do this recipe justice.  Please don't ruin this recipe by using KC Masterpiece, you might as well throw in ketchup, mustard and brown sugar. Ick

This is incredible!  I used 3 1/2 lb. of pork loin (because I had it in the freezer), and added an onion to the crock pot.  I drained pot after 4 1/2 hours on high, shredded the meat and added a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, an extra 1/2 cup or so of a Chipotle Citrus bbq sauce and about 1/2 cup of the broth.  I thought my boyfriend was going to explode he loved it so much!  PERFECT food for football Saturday's!

I don't see how this could be much easier.  I put the ribs in the crockpot on low and cooked them overnight.  I used the beef broth, some chopped onion and 1 teaspoon of liquid smoke.  This morning I drained the liquid, shredded the meat and then added the BBQ sauce.  Put back in the clean crock pot and heated for 2 more hours.  Delicious!!

This is fool proof.  I loved it. I find that recipes like this are only as good as your BBQ sauce, and everyone has different opinions about how a BBQ sauce should be. Use your favorite sauce and you will love this recipe!

I served this for my daughters 1st birthday party where there were over 20 people. It went over really well. I did change things a little bit. I used a 7lb pork roast ($1.98/lb) and put it in the slow cooker for about 10 hours or so. After that, I shredded it and added the bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Rays in my case) and put it in the fridge over night. The next day I put it all in a 13 x 9 and added more bbq and baked it at 400 for about 40 minutes. Then I served it in the crock to keep it warm. Turned out great, takes a bit of planning time-wise but is easy and very economical.

My husband has said my pulled pork could easily win contests. I buy 3 lbs pork shoulder and sprinkle jerk seasoning and french thyme very heavily on the shoulder as a rub and chop a medium white onion, throw that into the pot/partially on top of shoulder and pour 1.5 cups cola over the entire thing. set it on low to cook 8.5 hours, then cut the cord and hand pull the pork to a thick--medium consistency and return it to the crock pot, pour 2 cups sweet baby ray's bbq over everything and set it on high to cook 30-40 mins. serve on hamburger buns with twice baked potatoes and a bud lite and you've got yourself an amazing dinner, plus about 4 lunches and 2 more dinners worth of appetizers. that is if its just you and your hubby ;)

I have tried different barbeque recipes and never found a good one until this one. It is super easy and delicious! My kids (ages 2 and 4) never eat barbeque in the restaurant, but both of them ate this. It was SO easy. My only complaint is the price - it cost over $11 for 3 lbs. of boneless pork ribs. Next time I might buy a boston butt and cut it instead. :) I will definitely use this recipe again, though.

Wow, this was way better than I was expecting, and I was expecting it to be delicious. I couldn't stop eating little pieces of meat after dinner, it made me quite carnivorous. Here's what we did:  Boston Pork Butt (paid $4.60) Thawed in Fridge overnight (ours was frozen) Put in slow cooker on low Covered with 1 can of beef broth and 1 cup of water that I dissolved 2 beef bouillon cubes in with a spoonful of jarred minced garlic. I put it in right before work and DH shred it with a fork at 4:30 (9 hours). The 20-30 minutes in the oven is like the icing on the cake, makes it crispy around the edges. Don't skip that part. Thanks the the person who submitted this original recipe, it's awesome!!!

This is great for a party!  It's easy to double (if you have a large crock pot), and easy to make ahead of time.  I cooked the pork the day before (using a few cuts of pork roast, in addition to boneless ribs), shredded it the morning of the party, and reheated it in the crock pot with the barbeque sauce and some of the beef broth for a few hours before the party.  Other than the shredding, it's a quick and easy meal!

Edit: Have made this many times over, and still the best and easiest pulled pork bbq ever!  Use the cheap cuts of pork, as it will just fall apart and be super easy to shred.  Try different sauces with this.  Our favorite now is to mix two sauces: Jack Daniels hickory and Texas Mopping Sauce.  Topped with coleslaw I'd give this ten stars if I could! Original review: This is the absolute BEST barbecue ever!  It was so easy to fix, too!  All three of my boys ate this up, even the pickiest of the bunch!  I used KC Masterpiece original sauce to finish it up, and that added just enough sweetness to make this delicious.  This would be great with some coleslaw added to the sandwich, or on the side, and some good fries.  Happy eating with this recipe!  Thanks KK!

This was really good.  My husband loved it and even took some to work for lunch the next day.  He had mentioned right before I made this that he despised pulled pork.  I served it with homemade cole slaw and chips. I used a homemade ketchup-based bbq sauce that was very thick.  When I baked it, I added a ladle or two of the broth.  It gave it a very rich flavor.  I used boneless country ribs.  I'll definitely make this again soon and freeze batches of it for quick weekend meals.

Foolproof recipe for cooking tender pork!  To ease the shredding process, I added some of the broth back as I worked to help keep the pork moist and easy to work with.  It's great with your favorite barbecue sauce - For sweet and spicy flavor, I tried a mild honey barbecue sauce with a dash of black pepper, garlic flakes and a heaping tablespoon of diced hot cherry peppers. It turned out great!

This is easy and fool proof. I cooked the pork and shredded it one day, then the next all I had to do was mix in the BBQ sauce and heat it up-that made for a quick meak! I will try it with different sauces to find my family's absolute favorite.

DELICIOUS!  I followed reviewer Ginger's advice and went with a 4lb Pork Butt instead of ribs.  Cooked with broth for 8 hours on low in the crock pot, removed and shredded, drained the broth and replaced the meat then dumped a bottle of barbecue sauce on top and continued cooking on low until dinner time (about 2 more hours).  I didn't start the meat the night before as Ginger had suggested, but it still turned out awesome, tender and delicious!

good because it tastes good, but it's just so easy to make.  Good BBQ sauce makes or breaks it.  Use fresh rolls from your local store bakery.   I topped with red onions, pickles, and jalepenos.

This was my first time trying BBQ Pork and OH MY OH MY was it delicious. I took a look at the other reviews before I settled on my switch-up recipe. I got the thick slabs of boneless ribs, I would have gotten shoulder/butt, however it was like 8lbs. (too large for my little family). I put it all in the crock-pot, popped open a bottle of budlite, poured it in along with 1/3cup of Sweet-Baby Ray's and let it go on LOW for about 10 hours without messing with it. It stopped cooking in the middle of the night and I let it sit till the morning - then I shredded it, cut a whole white onion put it on the bottom of the crock-pot put the pork right on top and put another good bit of Sweet-Baby Ray's on top and let it cook on LOW another 3-4 hours. You're talking good -- The last suggestion I would make would be adding some Texas Pete Hot sauce on top just to give it a zip and I like my sandwhich prepared with coleslaw and the pork on a toasted bun. This recipe is delicious and now one of my fave's!

I loved this recipe.  It was so easy, and the pork was very tender and flavorful.  I used Pork Sirloin Roast, and cooked on low for an additional 3 hours.  It was very easy to shred.  I used KC Masterpiece Spicy Recipe BBQ sauce, but it would probably be even better with a homemade sauce.

I love this recipe.  Used it for my son's 4th birthday party to feed the adults.  I did use a pork loin that I had on hand already instead of buying ribs to use.  Many complimented & asked how I made it because the flavor, texture, and tenderness was just so good.  I think the secret to this recipe is actually the sauce you use--be sure you use a sauce you like best.  I used Cattleman's honey bbq sauce with mine.   Thank you for sharing such a simple and yummy recipe!!

This is so simple, and SO good!  Like I always do when making something for the first time, I followed the recipe to the letter.  I used boneless pork ribs, and KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce.  The meat fell apart when I took it out of the slow cooker.  I had no problem, at all, shredding it.  The time in the oven really did it justice.  Those who skipped this step missed out.  I am definitely going to make this again!  Probably soon!

I have not tried beef broth. I use root beer, even flat root beer, and candied ginger. After cooking, drain, shred and cover with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and heat. Yummm!

This was great, added some steakhouse seasoning we had in the pantry, garlic salt and lemon pepper to the crock pot along with the beef broth.  The pork was easy to shred and was great with BBQ sauce.

I love pulled pork and never knew I could make it at home, without a big smoke pit in the backyard! I used a 3 lb boneless pork shoulder. It was in the crock pot for 10 hrs on low, since I was gone that long - I think 8 or 9 hrs would have been great. It was so easy to shred with a fork, and easy to remove the fat at the same time. Finished in the oven with the Sweet Baby Rays. I lightly buttered some large bakery hamburger buns and set them under the broiler just until they were toasty. Piled on the meat, added a slice of oinion and a few dill pickle slices. Served with cole slaw and french fries. My husband said it was the best pork sandwich he'd ever had. Wasn't sure how my friend's 11 year daughter would like it, but she ate the entire sandwich in no time and reported it great. Thanks so much for posting this recipe. I will definitely be making this again and again!

Just finished eating this for dinner and it was a huge hit!  I followed the directions almost to a T, except I added a little beer to the beef broth for the first 4 hours and after shredding I put on the stove top instead of the oven.  Used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was so easy to make! I used 3.5 lb of petite roast for pulled pork, and I had this in my slow cooker for 10 hours. By that time the meat was so easy to shred! The pork was so good by itself I almost didn't want to put BBQ sauce on it LOL. So easy and yummy! Def a keeper :)

I must have done something wrong ... the meat was very tough and impossible to cut.  Ended up throwing it out.

This is a great way to make pulled pork!  My fiance and I both enjoyed it.  Works well with any cut of pork you use.

I will do what someone said- 4 lb pork butt - a less expensive cut of meat. the meat and broth in the slow cooker for 10 hours, shredded it right away (it shredded very easily) added 1 1/2 bottles of barbecue sauce and refrigerated it overnight. The next day I put it back in the slow cooker for a couple of hours to reheat. It was delicious, easy and inexpensive.  pork butt or pork roast

Excellent! Started with a 4 1/4 lb pork loin roast (was on sale) & cut in half to fit the slow cooker; put a Montreal Seasoning rub into it & cooked on high for 3 1/2 hrs. before shredding it; drained the broth & added 1 1/2 bottles of Famous Dave's BBQ Sauce right back into the slow cooker before adding the shredded pork back in. Let it simmer on high another hour then kept on warm thru an extended dinner. Served it up on bakery sub rolls. Perfection!

I have made some good BBQ in my 40 years.  I have to say that this is the greatest recipe ever.  I used Maurice Bessingers Sauce and it tasted better than the restaurant.  I worked there for 1 1/2 years and I would eat this over theirs anytime!  BRAVO!!!!!

If you like bland than this recipe is for you...99% of the people that rated this 4 or more stars changed the recipe so much that it's not even close to the original...I made it as written...then I deleted it from my recipe box!

Very good, and very easy!!  Actually froze some of the meat afterwards, and used it a few weeks later, and it tasted just like the first day I made it.

This sounded way too easy to be so good, but it's true.  I have used both pork roast and sirloin chops and had very good results with both.  So little work, such a great meal.

This is a VERY easy recipe and I used Pork Butt, which is very inexpensive.  It turned out really good and I received several compliments.  I suggest using original sweet baby rays bbq sauce.

We've used this recipe a few times and it's fantastic.  We use Wegman's Memphis BBQ sauce and we finish it in the crock pot.  No need to even dirty another pot.  We even get asked for the recipe.  Thank you for sharing.

This was so delicious! Made a couple easy changes: I used pork tenderloin and it was fantastic. I seasoned it with montreal steak seasoning and seared it for a couple minutes on each side. Put in the crock pot with the can of beef broth and about half of an onion (sliced however you like). It was ready to shred after 4 hours on high. I dumped the onions out with the used broth. Then I dumped a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays on it, put it back in the crock pot on low for an hour and bam, ready to go. We like to add a little Famous Dave's "Devil's Spit" sauce on each individual sandwich. My husband thinks this is even better the next day after it's been in the fridge. Make it with some baked beans and potato salad and it's a great BBQ meal!

This is a great recipe. Part of me longs for more smokey flavor. Next time I think I will put the meat on my grill with some smoke chips after it has cooked in the slow cooker.

I did a 7lb pork butt in the crock pot with a can of beer.  Cooked it all day long.  Came home, shredded it, mixed it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, baked it for 30 minutes on a cookie sheet, and YUMM-O!  The family asks for it every week!!  What a great way to do pulled pork!

I never made pork BBQ before, and this was so easy! I seared my pork before putting it in the crock pot, in beef broth for 10 hours. I shredded it mixed in BBQ sauce and next day reheated in the oven. I also added a small onion and some liquid smoke to my crock pot.

we love pulled pork sandwhiches and also ribs so i thought this would be a great dinner for us to try out, well i followed the recipe to the letter, but the ribs, after i took them of the bone were so greasy!! i couldnt even finish the sandwich and had an upset stomach from all the grease and fat for a day. i would not recomend using ribs, just stick to the pork roast.

I used Bob Evans Wildfire BBQ sauce. Also, instead of ending up in the oven, I drained all the fat out of the meat, returned it to the crock pot with the BBQ sauce, and let it simmer. That way, my family with several different schedules can all eat whenever. Excellent on a toasted roll.

Great recipe for pulled pork!  I have never tried this version before of using the beef broth.  But it sure seemed to make that pork tender!  I used a 2 lb. pork loin and cooked it on low for an hour and high the last 3 hours.  After shredding I poured out most of the broth and added just enough to moisten the meat.  Instead of putting it in the oven I just dumped some bbq sauce in the crock and let it heat thru.  I may try the oven next time because Im sure the higher heat will help the bbq sauce to really get thick and caramelize.  Thanks for the recipe!  I definitely will use this method again to make juicy, tender crockpot pork!

Deeeelicious! I couldn't find any bone-out pork ribs, so I settled with bone-in. Next time, I think I'll use a buttroast or something like that, because I encountered way too many little bone shards after the meal was finished and prepared. Impossible to spot when covered in bbq sauce. Aside from that, LOVED it!

This is the only way I do bbq pork. So easy. However, I always use a pork butt and I skip the oven part cause I like it better soft, not crispy. Thanks!

Phenomenal! I made this exactly like it was prescribed, and it came out amazing. I used a pork tenderloin b/c it was the cheapest reasonably sized slab of meat at the grocery store. We added another half a bottle of bbq sauce because we like it smothered in sauce. But it seriously was fantastic.

Perfection. I followed the directions to the T. I used a Carolina bbq sauce. It was a little too sweet and thick so I added a lot of white vinegar. Paired it with Restaurant Style Coleslaw I, and it was a huge hit. Made enough for about 8 sandwiches-- would be a great potluck dish to make!

This was awesome.  I used a 3# boneless pork butt and served barbeque sauce on the side since my family likes pulled pork sandwiches without the sauce mixed in.  Will be making again and again!

I followed the recipe to the tee and it turned out great.  I used boneless pork ribs and Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  I wouldn't change a thing.  This is going in my "keepers" box.

I made this with Famous Dave's BBQ sauce and it is delicious.  I did not put the pork into the oven rather I put it back in the slow cooker on low for 30-60 min and it is just perfect.  This tastes great with baked beans.  5 stars!

This is tasty and extremely simple.  We've made it many times just following the recipe given here.  People may try to dress it up, but if you buy a BBQ sauce you like (like Sweet Baby Rays), it comes out tasting great.

I used the Boston butt instead (5lbs). Added two bottles of root beer and cooked for 7 hours. Once it was done I drained the juice and shredded the meat. It was so easy and the bone pulled out of the meat with nothing on it. I then added my BBQ sauce and cooked on low for 35 more min. We had so much meat left over we were able to freeze half of it. Next time I may add some additional seasoning, like brown sugar or a rub, but you cannot go wrong with this!!

I hate when people adjust the recipe and then reate it but, I followed the suggestion to put in crock pot the night before.  I cooked it on low all night and woke up to a very tender pork butt, it was cheaper, I pulled the fat off easily and I didn't even have to shread it because it just fell apart.  Placed in fridge until about 3 hours before we were going to eat, added the BBQ sauce then set it on low.  My family can't stop talking about how good this was.  Will be making again and again

I've made this 3 times now (doubling the recipe one time) and can attest to how easy and yummy this recipe is.  On the advice of other reviewers, I used bone-in pork shoulder because of the cost.  I am a fanatic about removing the fat, and after this last time, I think I may use a leaner cut of pork if I can find it on sale.  Only reason being it made a super quick and easy recipe more tedious and time consuming than necessary.  Of course, if you don't mind some fat in your pork or don't mind picking it all out, then the cost difference is worth it.  The flavor is great and the recipe couldn't be easier.  I put a 3-1/2 to 4 lb pork shoulder, along with the beef broth, into a 6 qt slow cooker.  I cooked it on low for 10 hours, turning it once.  I then removed the pork, and shredded and de-fatted it with 2 forks.  Like I said, the de-fatting part was time consuming, but the meat just fell apart...so easy.  I rinsed out the crockpot, returned the pork to it,added my bbq sauce and let sit in the fridge over-night.  A couple hours before serving, I put it back on the crockpot on "warm" and served on warmed Hawaiian Rolls.  YUM!!  Tried Stubbs and Sweet Baby Rays...much prefer the SBR and will use that from now on.

This recipe is good everytime, but the cut of meat is important.  I look for country style pork ribs with the least amount of fat possible.  The more fat, the worse the house smells during cooking.  I made the mistake once of getting some fatty ribs and the house smelled like a rendering plant.  Since then my husband makes me use the slow cooker out in the garage for this recipe.

This recipe is great, but very expensive and time-consuming!  It uses a lot of meat and barbecue sauce, when it's much easier and cheaper to purchase already-made pulled pork from the grocery store, and it tastes the same.

I misread someone elses review and decided to add BOTH a can of cola and a can of beef broth. Fate? I think so. Taste was exquisite. I put the cola, broth, and pork BUTT in the slow cooker and set it at 6 hours on high. Meat fell off the bone VERY easily. After shredding the meat (and removing the bone), I added the bottle of BBQ sauce (sweet baby rays). Set it the low @ 12 hours setting...WITHOUT the lid (until the sauce thickens). After it thickened...BAM!!! Yummy goodness! Thank you for the suggestions and recipe!

As others have suggested, it is not necessary to use ribs.  I used a pork shoulder roast that I purchased on sale.  Instead of a whole can of beef broth, I used 1 cup and reserved the rest.  I cooked the roast on low in the slow cooker for about 8 hours, drained all the liquid, removed the bone and any fat, and shredded the meat.  I then added the reserved beef broth and a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and cooked another hour on low.  Yum!

Fantastic!  I just left it in the crock and served it.  I wasn't quite sure whether to drain the broth or not, but I did drain most of it before adding the sweet baby rays.  Very easy and got rave reviews at our super bowel, eh hem, bowl party.  Thanks KK!

This couldn't be easier.  I made this recipe for a birthday party, and it was a hit.  I used a pork roast instead of ribs.  This is a recipe that you can't mess up.  Yum!

WOW!!This is a great and easy recipe to make.  I read lots of reviews before making this, glad I did.  I used 3lbs pork butt instead cause it was cheaper and it tasted great. I added one onion sliced to the bottom of the crock pot, also added salt, pepper and garlic salt to pork. I don't use BBQ sauce often so I took the advice of many and used 1 bottle of Sweet baby Rays sweet n spicey sauce and 1/2 bottle Jack Daniels original sauce. Next time I will use 2 bottles of sweet baby rays! My husband went back for 3rds, even my 2 year old ate all of his. Great recipe will make again!!!!!

For this recipe I tend to use a whole cut of pork rather than ribs (like a roast) simply because it's much easier to pull apart. A very easy recipe!

This is soooo good! Now I have to go out and buy a crockpot; I borrowed my neighbor's to make this both times. I followed other reviews and used a 3 lb roast along with low sodium beef broth.  The roast fell apart beautifully at 4 hours in the crockpot.  The first time I made it I used sweet baby rays, and it was good.  However, we are partial to nc bbq (vinegar based sauce) and sweet baby rays just didn't fit the bill.  The second time I used bone suckin sauce, and it turned out fantastic.  I will be making this often.

I love this recipe. I make it all the time. I use it with other types of cuts of pork. I put it in the crock pot and keep it on low for 6-8 hours and be sure not to over cook it and my family loves this. He says I make better barbq ribs than a famous rib place in town. Its so easy too! Thanks for the recipe.

I used one pound of boneless pork ribs, and 1 can of beef broth. I also added a little salt & pepper. I cooked it for 8 hours on low, then shredded it and added Al's KC sauce from this website and it was SO good! So easy, and yummy, I will be making this a lot!

I used boneless pork sirloin roast that was on sale and it came out perfect!  Great recipe and super easy.  The pork just fell apart while I was shredding it.  I did sprinkle with grill seasoning for more flavor.

Very good; very easy to prepare. My entire family really enjoyed these sandwiches. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy barbecue sauce and I used a bone-in pork butt roast instead of pork ribs. This cut of pork worked out perfectly. I'll be making this meal on a regular basis.

Used a 4lb pork butt, slow-cooked on high for 4 hours, shredded the pork, drained the broth and fat, mixed in BBQ sauce and put back in the slow cooker on low for 1 hour. YUM!

This was amazing.  I forgot to put it in the slow cooker before I left for work so I pressure cooked for 90 min instead.  Followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  Used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce.  Wow.  This was incredible.  Possibly even better the next day.

Being from Michigan, I'm not too familiar with pulled pork recipes... however, my husband is from Alabama and absolutely LOVES Big Bob Gibson's Restraunt.. I guess they have awesome pork sandwiches?? Well, I attempted to make this recipe, not having any knowledge of what it was supposed to be like and followed it almost to a T. He took one bite and fell in LOVE with these sandwiches! THANK GOODNESS haha.

I accidentally bought bone in ribs, but 3 pounds still made enough to feed all four guys.  No left over.  They loved it.  Used Sweet Baby Rays sauce.  Don't skimp on the BBQ sauce, get a premium brand.

I used Country boneless ribs. I put them in the crockpot, with a can of beef broth, half of a large chopped white onion, garlic powder, and a little sea salt. I cooked on high for 3 1/2 hours. By this time they were falling apart. I scooped all the meat up, separated it (it falls apart), put it in a dish and drenched it with my own personal barbecue sauce (If you don't make your own barbecue sauce, I suggest you use Sweet Baby Ray's. ). Put in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. Serve on warm buns with a side of barbecue sauce. My family loved this recipe and I will be using it at least once a month.

I am not big on pork but my husband had been begging me to make pulled pork sandwhiches.  Thank you for a great recipe!  I did a couple things different though based on other suggestions.  I bought a lean pork roast and chopped 1 med onion in the bottom of the crock pot.  I seasoned the meat with salt and pepper and then put in in the skillet just to brown the outside.  Then put in in the crock pot and poured can of broth on top and 1/2 cup BBQ sauce.  I cooked it on low in crock pot for 4 hours.  Drained and shredded meat...I also kept some of the onions with the meat for extra flavor.  Then I transferred it back in the crock pot and poured the remainder of the BBQ sauce in it and let it cook for 1 hour.  Hubby thought it was delicious served with potato salad and I even tried some and it was very very tasty.

This recipe was delicious and affordable! We bought pork ribs (with the bone) and the total for all of the ingredients was about 12 dollars. We had friends over and after feeding four people, with two servings each, we still had leftovers! I highly recommend this recipe! We all loved it!

This was so simple and delicious. I used pork shoulder (still 3 pounds) because it was cheaper, but it still worked perfectly, and it was even better the next day. I wouldn't change a thing!

I tasted the meat before I added the bbq sauce and couldn't stop sampling it. Soooo good and tender. It shredded very easily. I used Sweet Baby Ray's and it turned out perfectly.

Delicious!  I made it for a party and served it on a grilled bun with macaroni salad on the side. It was a hit.  My husband likes to save some of the broth and add it to it after it's been baked.  we also Add extra bbq sauce.

Very good and easy.  I used chicken stock and sweet baby rays and it was really sweet will try another not as sweet BBQ sauce next time but very yummy and will freeze left overs.

This was the first time I've ever cooked pork ribs. I wasn't expecting to like it much at all...not a big pork fan, but my husband loves pulled pork, so I gave it a try. It gets five stars for simplicity alone...it fell off the bone after cooking in the broth. I didn't cook it in the oven after shredding...that seemed like a totally unnecessary step. I just put it back in the crock pot, added the sauce and let it cook until we were ready to eat. Served it on buns with cole slaw, which it definitely needed to cut the sweet/fat of the pork and sauce.

Couldn't find boneless ribs, so used the "country style pork ribs" and the bones just fell out anyway.  Cooked in the Crock Pot overnight  on LOW, about 9 hours.  Used KC Masterpiece Hickory Brown Sugar bbq sauce.  So tender and yummy!  Made this for a friend, and she and her husband loved it, too.

This deserves to be rated as a 5-Star recipe because it was delicious!!  The recipe was very easy to follow and the ingredients very easy to find.  The only thing I did different was marinate the meat in a rib rub I put together with ingredients in my cupboard (brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, ground mustard, paprika, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt).  I let it sit in the refrigerator for a few hours.  I then followed the recipe as listed.   I think it's important to choose a good quality sauce that tastes great! I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original both times I made this.  I may use the spicy one next time.  This is so good that I will no longer buy a pulled pork sandwich when I go out to eat...because I know I can make a better one right at home.  This is my new favorite recipe!

I was skeptical, but wanted to try it this way without complicating it like I usually do – the slow-cooker is supposed to make life easier! I didn't make a rub, I didn't marinate, I didn't make a BBQ sauce from scratch, and it was delicious. I used a 4.5 lb. butt roast, 10-hrs on low. MUST bake in oven for 30-min. to "crisp" it up a bit as recipe states. MUST serve with cole-slaw on soft rolls!

I have made this twice now-the first time I skipped the oven step and the second time I didn't (totally makes a difference-don't skip it!). The baking step gave it a nice texture and really brought out the flavor of the pork. I used a pork shoulder and just made sure I removed all of the fat before shredding. After shredding it and covering it with only a half bottle of sauce I let it sit overnight and baked it the next day. Really yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

A great recipe but I have one issue with some of the reviewers recommendations re: sauce.  I can find only a very few sauces that do not  have high fructose corn syrup as a main ingredient.  All that I read about this ingredient says AVOID.  Thus - I have found a couple of good ones that do not have that ingredient.  Georgia South BBQ sauce and Chocktaw Willies sauces.  Have tried the GA South and it's very good.  Will try CW's in a few days.  It sounds good as well.  And just maybe it's better for you.  Course - bbq can only be so good for you since it is sooooo good period......

We've used this recipe many times and have changed it up with different types of meat (chicken, beef),broth (veggie, chicken) and BBQ sauce (too many to list).  EVERY time it has turned out perfect.  If it isn't on the menu in our house, someone is craving it anyway. 
Note: It is easier to skip the baking and dutch oven part and just transfer the meat back to (clean) Crock Pot after shredding.  
Great original recipe and versatile as well!  Love it KK!

Wow, this was so easy, and it turned out fantastic!  I never need to buy BBQ pork again!  I used 4 lb of pork butt, trimmed the fat and bones, and cooked it for 5 hours on high.  After shredding the meat, I took another reviewer's suggestion and put it back in the slow cooker with the KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and 2 ladles of broth.  Then I let it cook for 1 hour on low, and it was scrumptious!  Thanks!  I will definitely make this again.

Very Yummy! After I shredded the meat, I just put it back in the crock pot with some Kraft Original barbecue sauce and 2 ladle-fulls of the broth. The broth added into the sauce seems to make a huge difference! So good!

Awesome! I used a 7 lb. Boston butt as a reviewer mentioned. Put in crock pot along with broth. Cooked on low over night. Shredded the next morning, and left in crock pot on low with a little broth while at church. Added two bottles Sticky Fingers sauce and popped in oven for 30 minutes. Made fabulous sandwiches! This is a keeper!

I followed Ginger's advice with using the pork butt and her cooking times/variations.  My husband said it was the best pulled pork he has ever tasted.  And he's tasted a lot of pulled pork!! :)  We will definitely be having this again!!

yum yum yum! If you use pork ribs, the meat is really tender. However, using pork shoulder is just as good and it is cheap!

Althogh I am not big on Pork this did make for a tasty sandwich. I find that canned products contain to much sodium, MSG, so I opt for an organic beef or vegetable broth, easy to find at my local Whole Foods or neighbourhood market.

This was great.  The only thing we did different was to coat the buns with the barbeque sauce and not the meat.  The natural flavors are delicious and less sodium

Excellent recipe! I added the barbecue sauce to the slow cooker. Then I drained the liquid and added more barbecue sauce and let the pork steep in the sauce for an hour or so on warm.

Well, after seeing 5 stars, I had high hopes, unfortunately, this was WAY TOO MOIST, and I cooked it for at least 45 minutes in the oven uncovered.  I used a Boston Butt, and I should have known better than to put all that stock back into the pork, but I'm kinda a stickler for following the recipes instructions the first time, as it drives me nuts to see people rate something real high or real low and see where they changed half the recipe.  I liked the flavors though and took the leftovers and put in a toaster oven on a cooking sheet and cooked them for another 30 minutes and they turned out much much better, but as written, be careful, pour out half the stock, chop it up and then evaluate, you can always take that leftover stock and wet it afterwards if its a bit too dry once it comes out of the oven.  I think it needed a touch of garlic and a bit more complex flavors, but it was not bad, but definitely not worthy of 5 stars.

Whooaaaa...

So if you can't tell by my screen name, I'm a vegetarian. I was planning a huge co ed baby shower luau and was trying to figure out a way to feed 30 carnivorous friends without breaking the bank. 

I used a 12 lb pork shoulder butt, 1 bottle of beer, and one can of beef broth and cooked it on low for 10 hours. 

Instead of bottled barbeque sauce I made my own Hawaiian bbq sauce with pineapple juice, teriyaki sauce, ketchup, fresh garlic, minced shallots, and fresh ginger. 

My hubby shredded it for me, I stirred in the sauce and refridgerated it until 30 min before the guests arrived. Heated it for 30 min in the oven, and served with mini Hawaiian rolls.

It was a BIG hit! And so easy...

If a vegetarian can pull this off, so can you!

This was my first attempt at pulled pork, & the first time I've taken out my slow cooker in years. I'm glad I dusted off the Crock Pot, because this was tasty & easy! I used pork chops instead of the ribs, which was my only change. And I served on a pita.

Very good recipe. Instead of adding beef broth from a can I made my own broth. Just added 14oz of water and added some garlic salt and pepper for flavor. Delicious! I'm sure it cuts out some sodium also.

ABSOLUTELY the best and the easiest recipe for a busy week night dinner!  I followed the recipe as it is and it turned out just great.  The beef broth is important because it keeps the pork juicy and tender. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

So easy!  I LOVE slow cooker recipes with few ingredients and minimal work.  I used a center cut roast since that's what I could find.  Instead of using the oven (and dirtying another dish) I dumped out the broth, shredded the chicken and added the BBQ sauce right in the slow cooker.  Set it on warm for another 2 hours and it was good to go!

Great recipe! Also works well if rootbeer is substituted for the beef broth! (gives the pork slightly sweeter taste)

This recipe is excellent! I used chicken broth instead of beef broth and it came out beautifully. The pork is very tender and easier to shred than a pork roast. It could be spiced up with green chilis and chili powder for port tacos as well as being served with BBQ sauce.

My husband is always begging me to make this. I'm not a fan of BBQ but  I make it for his lunch sometimes.(It'll give him a couple of days off from lunch meat) This time I tried a butt this time and it is more tender than last time. It just melts... really good!

Set crock pot on high and cooked for a little under 4 hours.  Removed, deboned, shredded added a little Baby Ray's and put in oven for about 15 min.  Very tender and tastey.

This was good. I think maybe it needed a bbq sauce that had more mesquite or smoke flavor because in the end to me it just tasted like glorified sloppy joe's. I had to keep tweeking it by adding liquid smoke and finally it was decent. My husband liked it but he will eat anything. I was looking for good smoky flavor so any suggestions on a good bbq sauce that has a ton of smoke flavor I usually make homemade sauce so I never know which ones are good!

5 stars for just how simple this is.  You can't got wrong with this recipe.  I usually omit the beef broth and just use meat and a bottle of sauce and it still comes out great.  Also, I don't finish it in the oven.  I just put it back into the crock pot for about 30-60 mins. and occasionally add a little more BBQ sauce.  Do use a good quality BBQ sauce since it's the only ingredient for flavor.  This makes excellent sandwiches.    A variation: I use 4 frozen boneless chicken breasts and about 1/2 a bottle of BBQ sauce to make great sandwiches as well and super quick.  I always have a bag of frozen chicken in the freezer.

I found 1 1/2 lbs of boneless ribs, perfect size for me, hubby and for some leftovers but I forgot to adjust the cooking time so it came out tough. Didn't think that could happen in a slow cooker or maybe I added too much broth. Not sure...but I'm sure it would have came out perfect. Very easy concept, I give it five (can't rate it worse because of my own beginners mistakes!) Next time I will use the a pork butt or shoulder,

Great recipe ~ Very easy to make.   I used a pork shoulder (6 lbs) and it took about 5.5 hours on high heat to cook it through.  I put it with a vinegar based bbq sauce and it's fabulous!

Fantastic!!! LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this! Only suggestion I have is don't use bone in pork.  I used country style ribs and by accident bought bone in. I was picking little pieces of bone out while shredding, and still got one in my sandwich.  Was a huge hit with the fam!

This is simply delicious.  I found an Applewood Smoke rub to put on the roast before placing in the crockpot.  Used a combo of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chipotle and Hickory Brown Sugar as the sauce.  Soooo good!

This was a hit for my football party! I used a pork shoulder (cause that's what was on sale) and put it in the crock pot with the broth for 4 hours on low and 1 on high. Then drained the juices, removed the excess fat and then chopped the meat.  I used the Famous Dave's Sweet and Sassy sauce for the oven cooking.  The meat turned out beautiful!

This was the first time I had used boneless pork ribs for pulled pork sandwiches.  Turned out awesome, the meat melted in our mouths.  I cooked mine on low for 8 hours, then the oven for 45 mins after adding the sauce. Loved it, thanks so much :)

What can I say..this is an awesome recipe.  I made it the first time using the boneless ribs, but the second time, I used a lean pork roast, which ended up being cheaper, and more lean.  This is a keeper!

This was ok. I was expecting more because of all the good reviews but like the one's who rated it lower, it was just too sweet for us. We like more zing- more of a vineagar. It was SUPER easy and we will make it again BUT try a smokey BBQ sauce and instead of the bneeth broth we will try beer as someone suggested. Maybe even add a splash of white vineager and see how it turns out.

This BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwiches are fantastic! I recommend making them with baked sweet potato fries and having an extra bottle of BBQ sauce for diping. We ended up a little short on BBQ.

If you're looking for an easy pulled pork, this is it.  you can also use the recipe minus the bbq sauce to make carnitas for taquitos.

So easy, so good!  Plus, leftover taste just as good.  Really, nothing bad to say about this recipe.

This is excellent...probably our favorite meal.  I use a pork loin instead of ribs and I use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  So easy and FANTASTIC!

Very good, quick and easy. I shredded the meat with a hand mixer, which took about one minute. My entire family enjoyed this recipe.

FANTASTIC! I used Pork Shoulder - 3.5 lbs sprinkled with salt, pepper and garlic powder. Browned all sides in a little oil in medium hot skillet , then added the pork to crock pot with sliced onions underneath the pork. Didn't have beef broth so I added 1/2 to 3/4 c water to the pan I browned the pork in and scraped up the browned bits on the bottom. Dumped this in the crock pot as well. Cooked on low 7 hours. Meat was so flavorful and just melted apart. The juices were phenomenal too. Used half the meat for soft tacos. Best I've had! Added warmed BBQ sauce to the other half and toasted buns for sandwiches. Thank you for such a versatile, easy, delicious recipe.

This was my first attempt at pulled pork.  I followed some of the suggestions below because they made sense to me.  Bought a 4lb pork butt at what I think was a reasonable price (dunno, never bought the stuff before).  Cut once to let it fit in the slow cooker.  Used two cans of beer for the liquid, and slow cooked for 10 hours.  Checked on it a few times at that time and pressed down to keep the meat under the liquid.  After the time was up, pulled the meat out of the liquid, grabbing any obvious fat globs and discarding with liquid.  Pulled apart using two forks, and again removed obviously over fatty parts.  Added about 1.5 bottles of BBQ sauce to taste, probably could have used more.  Let sit in fridge a day (I hear that pulled pork is better day old).  After which got some buns, browned on stove top, served meat reheated with thick onions, dill pickles, and mustard.  For a bachelor like me, big success for little work.  Awesome.

Easy and tasty! It is not necessary to use ribs as they are more expensive, but you'll get more meat for your money...

This was delicious! I used pork butt or pork shoulder and it is so incredibly cheap and it feeds an army.  I usually get a 7 pounder and cook it for about ten to twelve hours on low.  First I season the pork with garlic powder, onion powder, pepper and adobe.  I put it in the slow cooker and cover it with beef broth and let it cook for ten hours.  During this time i make my own bbq sauce (compliments of amethystshells review - which is amazing) -1/2 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 cup ketchup 1/4 cup chili sauce 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 tbsp chopped onions 1 tbsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp ground mustard 1 clove garlic, minced dash cayenne pepper Combine all sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally.    I pour that over the pulled pork when done and heat it in the oven for an hour. Don't forget to serve with coleslaw!

DELICIOUS and SIMPLE!!!  I had this recipe in my box for some time and wanted to try it using a less expensive cut of meat.  Was at our local butcher's today and they had pork butt on sale for $1.99 a pound.  After reading the reviews many used a pork butt so I decided to give it a try.  Put the pork in the crockpot at midnight with the beef broth ONLY for 10 hours.  Shredded the meat while still warm.  I was surprised at the amount of fat there was with this boneless 4.5 pork butt.  The meat tasted so good without the bbq sauce !!!  After shredding I ladling a few cups of the beef broth onto the meat to keep from drying out.  I topped with Big Al's BBQ sauce recipe.  I will definitely make this again soon!

Great! Followed the advice of others, and used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce for the first time. I set the pork and beef stock on high for 5 hours, pulled the 2-lb pork roast apart with a fork, drained the beef stock, and dumped the bbq sauce in. Left in the crockpot on high for another hour. It was tender and delicious. Even better the next day. Served on toasted Kaiser rolls. Thanks for the recipe!

This is an excellent and easy recipe!  Step one is the key to many other recipes as well.  Only change I made was to use pork butt - after 4 hrs it was perfect to shred and I had about twice as much meat as I needed.  Took about half of the meat and put it in a cast iron skillet with the BBQ sauce for super delicious sandwiches.  Saved the other half and two days later put it in the oven with green chili sauce for 1/2 hr and used it as the main ingredient to make scrumptious enchiladas!  You can't go wrong with this one!

More than 5 stars!  Absolutely fabulous.  I had a big party so I got two huge pork shoulders from Costco for cheap and used two crock pots and put one in each.  10:00 the night before I put in crockpot on low with the broth and the next morn at 8am the meat was shredding right off. I threw out the fatty parts(don't like) and emptied out the broth and returned the shredded meat adding a bottle of my favorite BBQ sauce to each crock pot.  I covered and let sit until an hour before the party and put back on low to warm.  I added in more sauce to my liking.  YUMMY YUMMY!!  Great share.

Giving this only 4 stars as I didnt follow the recipe:  
I got a 3LB boneless pork shoulder or butt roast (whatever is available) from my local asian market butcher counter.  Dont waste your $$ on an expensive cut of meat - The crockpot will make the meat tender anyway.  I've found that for a cheaper cut of meat, the asian market butcher counter is the best place to go.  Most chain grocrey stores only sell 7+lb bone-in roasts which is too much for my family.  Anyway, I seasoned the meat with pepper and mrs dash and placed it in the crockpot with NO liquid.  The meat will create its own drippings.  Cook on low for 10hrs.  Remove meat from crockpot, drain (save drippings), and shred meat removing as much fat from it as possible.  Place shredded meat back in the crockpot changing the setting to warm.  Some may let the drippings cool, even putting it in the freezer to make skimming off the fat easier.  But since I've got a hungry troop to feed, I dont wait and just spoon the fat off the top and pour the remaining back over the meat.  
I either make my own BBQ sauce (Recipe from Brisket with BBQ Sauce) or heat up some original Sweet Baby Ray's sauce in a saucepan.  I let everyone add however much sauce they want on their individual portions.  
Very tasty and very easy recipe!

YUM!  Everyone enjoyed this dish.  The easiest thing i have ever made!  I bought a 5 pounds pork loin roast at Costco and threw it in my Crock Pot on low for 7 hrs.  Added 2 cans of beef broth because i used so much meat.  I also sliced up 1/2 a yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic and addded it to the beef broth.  Left in in the crock pot for 7 hrs on low and the meat just fell apart!!  added the BBQ sauce (made my own) and it was to die for!  Served on buttered and toasted hamburger buns... DELISH!  would recommend this recipe to anyone!! By the way... the 5 lb made enough for 12 sandwiches... I only had 4 people eating... but everyone ate 2!!  The leftovers were even better the next day!

WOW!!!  This recipe is FANTASTIC!  My husband prepared it with a little direction from me.  You have to understand that he does *not* cook. ;)  It was just the best BBQ that we have ever tasted....and that includes the BBQ we ate in Memphis that, until making this recipe, was our favorite.  We made the recipe using 5 lbs. of boneless pork loin which was on sale for $1.89 per pound at our market.  We just put that in the crock pot with two cans of beef stock and let it cook for about 6 hours on high.  Then, we removed all visible fat and shredded the meat.  (The meat was SUPER easy to shred.)  We then put it in the oven as stated in the recipe.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's original sauce as recommended by many other reviewers.  It came out absolutely PERFECT!  We will be making this again and again and definately will use it when whole, boneless pork loins are on sale! Tons of awesome food for very little money! Thanks for a GREAT recipe!

Really easy, really good. I don't do the oven step tho, drain off the liquid and put the pork (I use country style pork ribs) back in the crockpot with the Sweet Baby Ray's and set it on warm until it's time to eat.  Would be great for feeding a big group, or cut it down for just 2 of us, with leftovers, of course:)

This was a great easy recipe. I bought bone-in pork ribs as I couldn't find boneless. I took other reviewer's advice and added onion to the bottom of the crock pot. The meat was falling off the bone after 4.5hrs! great recipe.

I put my own lil spin on it, but this was GREAT.  I used Boston Butt, seared it in a skillet on all sides before putting it in the slow cooker.  I first cut up half a sweet yellow onion and a couple cloves of fresh garlic.  Next time I'm using the whole onion because I mixed it in with the shredded meat and they were like bbq candy surprises when you bit into one on your sandwich.  I also added a little bit of brown sugar and distilled white vinegar while it cooked.  Fabulous!

Made this for dinner last night and my picky husband loved it. I used pork butt and added an onion but other than that made it as written. I used Jack Daniels barbeque sauce. Would definitely recommend this recipe.

Delicious! I put a 5 lb. pork shoulder in the crock pot with about a cup of chicken broth and a diced onion and let it cook on low overnight (About 10 hours).  In the morning I trimmed off all the fat, shredded it and added Sweet Baby Ray's regular BBQ sauce. The secret is definitely cooking it in the oven for the extra 30 minutes! I added a little of the broth from the crock pot, plus the diced onion and the flavors melded together sooo well!  My boyfriend said this was better than pulled pork sandwiches he's eaten at restaurants!  Will definitely make again!

I used pork shoulder. And I added a little liquid smoke. It was very tender. Everyone loved it.

I used pork country ribs and cooked on low 8-10 hours (in broth).  Pulling and putting it in the oven to bake for 30 minutes in the bbq sauce really pulled the "crock pot" flavor out of the meat.  This is super easy and a great recipe. 2nd time, I cooked on high 4 hours and proceeded as written.  Again, no "crock pot" flavor!

I slow cooked the pork for 4.5 hours on high and 2 hours on low, this was very tender but not overly moist. I shredded the meat and mixed it in sweet baby rays bbq sauce, then let it sit in the fridge overnight. It had a decent flavor but overall... I wasn't wild about the meat. I have high standards when it comes to food and this wasn't anything to write home to mom about. It wasn't horrible... it just wasn't my favorite. However, this was for a work pot luck and they seemed to like it :)

I followed the recipe but cooked it on low for 4 hours and high for 2.  I started it late so I had to improvise.  I am not a pulled pork person and I had thirds!  I didn't change a thing with the recipe and I wouldn't change a thing!  Definitely a keeper.

Even though there are tons of reviews on this one, I had to throw my 2 cents in! This recipe came to my rescue tonight. Several weeks ago, I'd bought a 2-lb "value pack of assorted pork cuts" from my grocery store, HEB, at a huge discount. I thawed them out the other day and absolutely had to cook them tonight. I didn't quite know what to do with it. It's was a pkg of bone-in chops - thick and thin, boneless chops, pork shoulder steaks, and other cuts I couldn't identify. I came across this recipe and thought I'd give it a shot. I used a beef buillion cube in 12oz of water to simmer them in the crockpot for 4 hours. Then I broke up the meat with my fingers, combined it with half a jar of Nick's BBQ Sauce (great sauce from Carlisle, AK), 1/3c of the simmering liquid, and baked it in a glass dish sprayed with PAM for 30 mins. I just threw it on hamburger buns and it was unbelievably tasty and moist. I can't thank you enough for this quick and easy recipe. I'll be looking for those value packs again. Even now as I type this, hubby is heading back to the kitchen for another sandwich....and he's already had two!

Great easy BBQ, it's a wonderful thing. I cook on slow for 8 hours and use Famous Daves Sweet and Zesty BBQ sauce. It's wonderful!

can't believe how easy and delicious this was!  threw a frozen 3 lb boneless pork loin along w/ the beef broth in the crock pot on low before bed.  shredded it the next morning and continued cooking on low.  served for lunch straight from the crock pot and let people add their own bbq sauce.  made 10 big sandwiches and it was so good!  will be making this again and again!

Super easy to make & everyone loved it! I quartered a small onion & placed it under the 3lb pork shoulder. I cooked it on high for about 4 hrs, then drained the juice from the crock pot. I shredded the meat with my fingers, just seemed easier than with a fork. I returned the shreaded meat to the crockpot & mixed in two types of BBQ sauce, turned to low heat and left it there for about another hour before finishing it off in the oven for 30 mins. Plan to make it again but instead of using the oven for the last part, I plan to put it on the BBQ grill for 15 mins to get that true smoky flavor.

I followed the recipe exactly and used Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce.  I have a family of picky eaters, and they thought it was good.  I thought it was GREAT, so I am giving it 5 stars!

My husband is a bbq snob and he never eats pork cooked in a crock pot. He loved this and ate two sandwiches. It's also crazy easy to make.  I followed the recipe to a tee, except instead of baking it, I microwaved it for a couple of minutes because husband was about to eat his own arm and wouldn't wait 30 minutes.

After reading many of the other reviews I purchased a 5lb pork butt, I rubbed it down with smoked paprika, pepper, lawrys season all,garlic powder, and a little brown sugar. I placed chopped onions in the bottom of the crock pot, and used the beef broth..it took about 5 hours to cook and I mixed 4 bbq sauces together (kraft: hickory smoke, hickory smoke with honey, HOT, and thick and spicy original) it was AMAZING! The 30 minutes in the stove really did it justice! Definitely will be making it again!

So easy and so delicious. This is the such a nice dish to make for a crowd because everyone loves it. Use the best quality BBQ sauce you find (or make your own). I also serve extra BBQ sauce with it for those that like it really saucy.

YUM! Who knew pulled pork could be so easy? I made the pork the night before and let it marinade in the bbq sauce in the fridge overnight. In retrospect I think it made the pork kind of mushy and lacking texture. Will definitely be making again but won't add the bbq sauce until I'm ready to bake.

this is fantastic! everyone asks for the recipes. I add a dash of liquid smoke to the broth to give that delicious smokey flavor. Pork tenderloin is what I use. Don't skip the oven step, it's KEY :)

Very good. I used a 3 lb "pork end roast" that included bones. I set the crock pot on 10 hours on low, but pulled it out after 9 and it was done. I used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory and Brown Sugar Sauce.

Everyone Loved it. I used Sweet Baby Rays for sauce. I did use pork butt instead of ribs which will make it slightly fattyer but not enough to make much difference.

delicious!  I have made these several times.  They are good with beer or beef broth.  To top it off, drizzle some olive oil on you rolls and toast or grill them.  The crunchy texture just makes the sandwich that much better!

Good tasting, but the pork we bought was hard to pull apart.  I think I will try it with different cut next time, and more BBQ sauce.

EASY!  The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.  I decided to buy the pork that was on sale the next time (because it really doesn't matter what cut you use). This is fantastic for hungry crowds!

This recipe was really great! It was so easy to make. Just wish I would have found less fatty shoulder ribs. The only problem I had was the sauce, and i blame myself for the choice. Other than that, the recipe as written is phenomenal. Thank you so much for the recipe :)

Absolutely LOVE this recipe. I followed the instructions all the way through and have to agree that using two dishes makes the meal. I use crock pot bags anyways so it would be more of a hassle to leave it in the crock put and shred. I also used Sweet Baby Rays, per a review and loved it. My husband thinks I am fabulous.

I just did the most simple version of this just as a test. Instead of ribs I used Pork loin and I just added Kroger brand bar-b-cue sauce. I put it in the crockpot most of the day and it came out so tender. Everyone in my family loved it! I can't wait to try it again and doctor it up.

very simple, very good. wow... i usually buy a boston butt because it is cheaper, this time i bought the tenderloin the quality was way better and i think i might just spend the extra for the better BBQ unless i am just broke.

I'm not known for being great in the kitchen. I'd never tried anything like this before, so I was wary all afternoon and checked the cooker constantly. No need!  It was tough to shred but came out nice and soft after being in the oven.  Everyone loved this, and I was super excited. I will definitely make this again. Try it out!

I used Pork Spare Ribs.  Doubled the beef broth in the croc pot to ensure the ribs get tender and cooked for 5 hours on high heat.  I found that it was easier to let the ribs cool a bit and then use my fingers to separate the meat from the bones and fat.  I used Sweet Baby Rays (sweet and spicy) BBQ sauce.  Served on buttered and toasted buns.  Very tasty but no better than City BBQ's pulled pork.  Great satisfaction from making my own pulled pork but for the amount of time it took plus the cost of ingredients, I may just buy it from City BBQ by the pound ($11/lb).  1 rack of fibs + Sauce + broth means I saved about $10 over purchasing the same amount from the restuarant.  When I make it next time I'll make a homemade BBQ sauce...I think it would have made all the difference!  Also, to save money, use the leftover beef broth as the base for beef stew for the next evening!

Good, but a little too liquidy. The flavor of the BBQ sauce was watered down by all the broth. Next time I'll cook the pork and then remove most of the liquid before adding the sauce.

I did this recipe with chicken and chicken broth and Sonny's barbeque sauce and it was AMAZING!! My entire family loved it and the 3 pounds of chicken were gone in a snap.  My only regret was that I didn't make more.  This is a definite simple, but delicious keeper recipe!! A+++

Made this recipe with a pork loin instead of ribs to cut down on fat.  It was delicious!  Very, very tender.

Superb! I used boneless skinless chicken breasts, chicken broth, and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Cooked on high for 4 hours and it was perfect! Such an easy meal on a busy Saturday! Will DEFINITELY make again!

I didn't have the beef broth so I just used water and my ribs had the bone in.  I didn't even need 2 forks to shred, it was so tender it fell apart!  Followed the rest of the recipe and all I can say is, I thought my way of doing this was good...but your version has replaced mine in the recipe box!  Thank you for sharing!

Delightful!  I modified slightly to make TexMex carnitas.  I used pork butt instead and coated in salt and pepper before pan searing and putting it in the crockpot with onions and a cup of water. After 6 hours on High in the slowcooker, I removed the pork (so soft) and shredded it with forks and chopped it with kitchen scissors. I took the remaining liquid and reduced it by simmering in a fry pan.  Then I added to the shredded pork and served in small soft taco tortillas with fresh cilantro, diced purple onion, salsa and sour cream.  Tasted amazing and now we have tons of leftovers. And it all came from a $5 piece of meat.

My family loves this recipe. It has been one of those meals that I've been serving all summer long. I cook the pork for 8-10 hrs on low then let it soak in Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce overnight-improves the flavor. This is a keeper.

I used a 3.50 lb pork roast, I was a little worried about all the fat on the meat but it fell right off the roast.  I cooked this pork on low for 8 hours and the meat turned out perfectly.  Shredding the meat was easy and the end result was delicious.

This has become a staple in our house. Definitely cook on low for 10 hrs and it just falls apart. If you cook on high for 4 it is too tough to separate.

We loved this recipe! We used a pork roast & Sweet baby Ray's BBQ sauce and it turned out so tender. A 2 pound roast made about 12 sandwhichs for us. The best part was that it was so easy and had virtually no clean up using the slow cooker bags! Will be making again frequently.

Pretty good, especially if you don't have access to a smoker or don't want to keep your oven on for hours. I used bone-in spare ribs - that's all that was left at the grocery store at 5 PM on New Year's Eve - and not such good ones at that :( After a lot of cleaning, (removing fat and silverskin), I cooked them for 4 hrs. in the crockpot with low sodium beef broth, shredded the meat, mixed it with just under an 18 oz bottle of Sweet Baby Rays and finished it in the oven as the recipe stated. It came out hot and a little crusty but still tender (kinda like the crispy "ends" of BBQ, which I prefer. I like a little chew to pulled pork). Served w/cole slaw on hamburger buns, kids loved it, ate two sandwiches each. 10 - 12 servings from 3 lbs of meat will make small sandwiches - take note. I did feed six for about $10, so...that works, eh?

Amazing! I put a whole, bone in, 5 lb pork shoulder (after cutting off a good bit of the fat) into my crockpot at around 11:00 pm last night. At 9:00 am this morning I lifted the bone, and yes, the meat literally slid right off! Shredding the meat was a breeze... I read the reviews about leaving some chunks, but my meat was so tender that just stirring it broke it apart. I used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory Brown Sugar and it is perfect. I skipped the oven step and just let the meat hang out with the sauce in the crock pot. I'm serving this on potato rolls with a dollop of cole slaw on the sandwich. Thank you for an easy and really inexpensive recipe!

I bought 5 lbs. of Country Pork Style Ribs.  It was basically boneless (just 3 or 4 bones total.  I read all reviews and decided to put 2 cans of beef broth, one chopped onion, one chopped green pepper, 5 or 6 chopped garlic cloves.  I cooked for 4 hours.  I took the meat out of the crockpot.  Very easy to take off the few bones I had.  I also was able to cut away the fat easily.  Instead of putting back in the crockpot, I put the shredded pork in a cast iron skilled.  I put a little broth from the crockpot in the skillet plus all of the vegetables (onions, green peppers and garlic) in the skillet.  I used a jar of Stubb's Barbeque Sauce Spicy and a little left over of another sauce.  I blended it with a spoon and put in the oven for 30 minutes on 350 degrees.  This was truly wonderful barbeque.  My husband loved it.  Will definately make this again.  But next time I think I will add a little liquid smoke.

Absolutely easy to make and came out so good! My critics at home liked it. Followed the recipe exactly like it says... Used the 50% less sodium broth and cut the boneless ribs in a few pieces and also added the onions at the bottom like other reviews mentioned. I threw ingredients in and left it on high for 4.5 hours. Pork just fell apart. I used Garland Jacks Secret Six brown sugar BBQ sauce and it just made it even better. I will definitely make this recipe again!  Texas approved!! Have the buns, pickles, and onions ready.

I cooked this a little differently than the directions. I did the first part the same, cooked on high for 4 hours. But then I discarded the broth and added the barbeque sauce and cooked on high for another 30 minutes. It turned out great! My family loved it

After reading several reviews for not only this recipe, but the other similar recipe on this site using root beer, I decided to attempt making my first crock pot dish. I bought a 5.24 lb Pork shoulder butt. I put about half an onion on the bottom of the crock. I threw the pork on top which i had cut in half to fit in there, and completely covered it in water and two cups of beef broth. I set it on low for 10 hours. Took it out, shredded it, mixed in 28 ounces of Sweet Rays BBQ sauce and threw it in the oven. Served on kaiser rolls. It was sooo delicious even my picky boyfriend said it was "better than restaurant quality."

Made this for the first time for my sons birthday party. It was a HIT! Everyone raved about it and gobbled it up. Whatever was left was taken home as left overs! Easy simple recipe to follow with great results, you can't go wrong. I used pork shoulder with bone in. I cut off the skin and fat from the top, placed it in the slow cooker with the bone. When it was done, the meat fell of the bone, and I shredded it. It was only .79 a pound for the pork shoulder. Ibought 17 lbs and used 2 slow cookers. It was 2 shoulders about 8lbs each.

I, like others, used a 3lb pork butt roast instead of ribs.  Cooked it in the crockpot with the beef broth on high for 4 hours.  Then I turned it down to low for 2 more hours.  So tender I had to remove it from the crockpot with a slotted spoon!  I pulled it apart, emptied the broth from the crockpot.  Then I decided to play with my cheap honey bbq sauce.  I added about 1/4-1/2 cup of cider vinegar to it, to make it taste more like my husband's native North Carolina bbq sauce.  HUGE hit!!!  Hubby and son ate til they were sick, lol!  Will definitely make again!!

I ruined this recipe by putting it in the oven for the last 30 minutes, as stated in directions. Meat became stringy and icky. 

It was perfect before putting it in oven. I cooked on High for 4 hours; turned crockpot off and then had to leave the house unexpectedly. 3 hours later I came home and shredded the meat (which was still hot) It was *PERFECT* at that point so I shouldn't have cooked it in oven. Should've just added BBQ sauce & served right away.

I'm giving it 4 stars since the texture is worse after baking, if you follow the directions.

Yayyyy!  My husband said to add this to the rotation.  So it's a keeper!  I cooked it on low for 8 - 10 hours.  I used a 2.27 lb pork shoulder and skipped the beef broth.  Shredded it and added the Sweet Baby Ray's, then baked for the suggested 30 minutes.  Still not quite sure what baking it did?

I made this exactly as the recipe states. I used the cheaper cut of pork, which shredded easily. I used a quality BBQ sauce, and results were spectacular.

I am not one to cook a lot, so this recipe was perfect for me! I threw in the pork ribs at noon and was ready for dinner by 5. I suggest using Billy Ray's BBQ sauce. As a side, I made T's Sweet Potato Fries, also delicious.

I am not an expert cook and am constantly trying out new recipes on my fiance. And he LOVED this one and after my first try too. I followed the recipe almost exactly and used the Bullseye Kansas City sauce which had just the right balance of smoky and sweet but did not use the whole bottle. I wanted to make sure the flavor of the pork would still come through. I added my own touch by adding cheese on top of the meat and then low broiling for 2 minutes on top of the hamburger bun and broiled the other half of the bun also...nothing beat the smell of slow cooking pork all afternoon and knowing you'll have leftovers all week.  The leftovers I just added some extra bbq sauce before i microwaved it. Had sides of baked beans and potato salad. Fiance added extra hot sauce to his burger to spice it up.

Thank you! First time  making bbq and turned out great! Glad to use boneless ribs as it made it easier to remove the fat while shredding
 which makes me gag. Halved the recipe and used half beef stock n half root beer...half an onion too... drained juice before baking w/bbq...great!

This is a perfect base recipe. I used a cheaper cut of meat but followed the instructions exactly and was very pleased. When I cook this again, I may tweak it a bit, but this was a very good base to start with.

I used a 4lb Boston butt.  It was delicious!!!!  Next time, I will cook a 30 minutes less in the crockpot as it was almost too mushy.  I used Kraft original BBQ sauce because that's what I prefer.  I loved it.  My daughter has even taken it for lunch a few days.

I marinated my pork in a bag of spices and a little barbecue sauce for one whole day before cooking, to really get that flavor in there. I cooked my boneless ribs overnight (10 hours) in the broth. This morning I shredded it and stored in the fridge. For dinner, I mixed in Sweet Baby Ray's and baked it for 20 mins and it turned out DELICIOUS! Will definitely be making it this way from here on out. Thanks for sharing!

Try this on croissants (cut in half). It gives it a buttery flavor.  The combination is great. More moist than on a regular bun.

Yum! This is delicious even before I add the BBQ sauce! I used chicken broth because its all I had on hand and put it in the slow cooker for about 6 hours. Plan to mix it with BBQ sce and some of the reserved liquid from cooking and warm it in the crockpot for an hour or two while we head out to church and when we get back home tonight it will be perfect!

Love love love it! I followed Ginger's advice and used pork butt. One thing worthy of mentioning -- this freezes really well. I just put servings into those disposable containers and froze them. I pull them out the day before I want to use it. So, if you can't eat 12 servings at once, think about freezing.

I use this recipe every time I make pulled pork now. I make a huge batch and the left overs freeze beautifully! I really like to mix a honey BBQ sauce with a Bold one to get some really good flavor. Perfect to pop in the slow cooker before work and finish in the evening. I also like to toast the buns, put the pork on the bun, a slice of cheese and under the broiler until it melts.... makes it even more delish!

These were very tasty! I didn't pay attention to the time or heat but left them in the slow cooker for six hours on low. It was so easy to shred. I'll use more bbq sauce next time. Not sure what size bottle I used but I usually make my own anyway.

I decided to try this recipe today. although I am partial to the Allrecipe recipe "Slow-Cooked Pork Barbecue," this one is good to. I followed the ingredients and directions, just using low-sodium broth. For some reason though the other recipe reminds me a lot more of a slow cooked smoked pork. It might be the meat cut or the sauce I normally use. This recipe called for 18oz of sauce. There was only one brand in 18oz so I went with it. It was a little more thick, spicy, and sweet than I prefer. I normally use Sauers bbq sauce, which is more of a North Carolina vinegar based sauce. Either way, it was tasty, reheats well, and it made a quick and easy bbq sandwich without a whole lot of work. TY

This was a fabulous recipe. I used boneless ribs, and cooked it for around 6 hours. After shredding the meat, I discarded the broth. Placed the meat back into the cooker and added one bottle of Toms hot barbeque sauce and 1 can of coca cola.
Set the cooker to high and let it cook for another hour. Everyone loved it!

Good stuff and really easy to make.  Used a bottle of dark beer instead of broth, and used 
Sweet Baby Ray's Spicy BBQ Sauce.  Made fabulous sandwiches!!!

Fantastic!  I used two pounds of ribs for a smaller serving amount.  Easy, inexpensive, and tastes great!  Served with The Original Potato Salad and chips.

We followed the recipe and turned out to be WAY to much BBQ sauce. It was easy and tasted great but next time I will use 1/2 the BBQ sauce.

This was amazing. I used the boneless pork ribs, like the recipe says, and put them in the crock pot before work with the beef broth. I had it on high for four hours and then on low until I got home. The meat just shredded apart so easily. I then mixed it with 18oz of Sticky Fingers Sweet Carolina BBQ sauce (I added a little more from a second bottle). I put it in the oven to warm it back up and add some crispiness. It was absolutely fantastic! My husband says it was the best pulled pork sandwich he has ever had. I was worried that the 2lbs of meat wouldn't be enough, but it really was. We gorged on it for dinner and then ate it for lunch for the next two days. Easy and yummy recipe! Thanks for posting!

This was quite good. I will certainly make it again.  Lots of leftovers meant we made bbq pork tacos and nachos in the following days which were also very good.  I just realized that I forgot to do the oven part of the recipe....oops.

Thanks to ginger, I followed her advice and used a pork butt instead and I cooked it for 10 hours, shredded it and refrigerated overnight and reheated for 2 hours the next day.  
My changes: I used 2 cans of beef broth to cover it better then drained all but about a 1/4 cup of the broth before refrgerating.   The next day I added the bbq sauce (I prefer Maull's sweet & smoky) and also a generous splash of beer.  Turned out great and making it the day before was super easy for entertaining.

I've made this recipe a lot since I've discovered this recipe, and my husband and I love it! the only change I would make is to add a tablespoon or so of the juice from the crockpot to the pork in the skillet before you put it in the oven. Makes the pork a lot more juicy, and not as dry.

Very good. I used some Sweet Baby Rays we had in the refrigerator. My BF and his dad enjoyed this and it was SUPER easy since I had running around to do. I liked it even better without the barbecue sauce! I think I may have to try a different sauce next time or make my own but the meat turned out great. Thanks for sharing!

Excellent! I changed this up a bit because I can't have BBQ sauce due to the tomato. Others I serve this too can have BBQ so I planed to pull out meat for me before adding the BBQ sauce.

Changes:
While in the crockpot I added in one garlic clove, dried parsley, dried cilantro, peppercorn. Cooked it on low for 2 hours and then on high for 4 hours. 

After shredding I put my meat in a skillet and the other meat in another skillet. For both I added a little juice from the crockpot. For mine I added in cayanne pepper and syrup because I love a sweetened pork sandwich! For the other meat added in Bourbon BBQ sauce and a little syrup. Cooked both until most of the juice was gone and the meat had little crispy bits. 

Mine tasted great! I am guessing the other was great as my family didn't even talk while eating and my brother ate his so fast I didn't even see him eat it! My son asked for leftovers the next day.

Very simple and flavor can be adjusted easily by adding different bbq sauces.  Putting this in the oven really does something for this dish.

I goofed on the recipe (forgot the broth, just covered in bbq sauce and cooked all day). I should have looked over it again before making this dish; but it still turned out good. It still would have been better had I turned the crockpot off after about 8 hours, before the bbq sauce burned. Even still, it is still good and I have a TON. Used a pork shoulder roast. I'll put quite a bit of it back to use in bbq beans,etc. Great recipe. I can't wait to try it the right way. Super easy and delish!

The recipe was overall very easy to follow with three main ingredient. This definitely has room to grow with, allowing one to tweak it to their taste buds. We added onion powder and garlic salt for seasoning. My husband added some apple juice to the broth to help tenderize and flavor the meat. Could use more sauce and flavoring, but that is something that can easily be adjusted, so we will definitely make this recipe again. Will be keeping this in the recipe box.

2/1/13
We made this recipe many times since our first try. It is definitely worth 5 stars for how easy it is. And we found using country style boneless ribs to be the best for this recipe. I tried doing different seasonings and found one that works best for our family. Oh, and apple vinegar is much better than apple juice.  I originally rated this 4 stars and changed it to 5 because it wasn't the recipes fault that I felt it needed more flavor and sauce.  So after tweaking it up a bit to our liking we think it taste better than any restaurants pull pork we ever had.

All I can say is WOW! I've never had pork so tender in my life. My husband loves pulled pork sandwiches. Slow cooked for 4 hrs as directed, and the meat fell apart as soon as my fork touched it. Instead of putting it in the oven I drained the juices out of the crock pot, shredded the meat and put it back in the crock pot with the bbq sauce. Will definitely be making this again!!

This is a great recipe if you cant find boneless pork ribs I highly suggest pork tenderloin also sold as boneless pockchops. Very easy to shred after cooking in the crockpot. Also use a good quality BBQ sauce. I always seem to use more then called for because I like the sauce I use.

I'm not a very big fan of pork, but this was amazing.  (And what's better is it was super simple to make.)  It tasted just like it came from a BBQ restaurant.  I browned one onion in a pan and then added the onion and a tablespoon of liquid smoke to the broth.  I will definitely make this again.

This is excellent. PLEASE use QUALITY BBQ sauce for this, not that cheap kraft stuff.  The cheap stuff thins into water and is just nasty. If you want a good meal you will have to fork out a few extra bucks, but worth it all the less.  Any cut of meat will do as well. I have also tried this with beef, added mushrooms and peppers- All excellent.

I used boneless pork chops as that was all I had.  I chopped the fat off of it.  I followed this recipe to the letter besides that.  Delicious!  My husband, who loves to eat, but doesn't get enthusiastic about food, said this was "restaurant" quality and the best I'd ever made.  I will make this again!

Made this with chicken, chicken broth, and Bandana's Sweet and Smoky BBQ Sauce. Was absolutely amazing!!! My family loves Sweet Baby Ray's but I went with Bandana's because of no high fructose corn syrup. Served on whole wheat buns with some shredded cheddar cheese on top then put a little more sauce. So good!

I tried the latter part of this recipe on leftovers of a crock pot pork loin that hadn't gone over so well at the dinner table.  I shredded the pork, mixed it with BBQ sauce, and baked it in the oven.  It was a superb makeover of leftovers!  And the BBQ sauce can be selected based on your BBQ flavor preference.  Next time I'll probably use a sweeter, tangier sauce instead of the mesquite one I used this time.

so...i asked my butcher if i could use a pork tenderloin to make this because i hate fatty meat.  she said "absolutely not, it would be rubbery".  so, i decided that i would try it anyway.  i did not really follow this recipe because i think that just beef broth was not enough flavoring.  i put the pork tenderloins in my crockpot (about 2.5 pounds), added 3 T. liquid smoke, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. black pepper, 3 large cloves garlic, minced, and 1 onion, finely chopped.  I poured that all over the pork, then i added just enough beef broth to cover the bottom.  i cooked it on high for 4 1/2 hours.  IT WAS WONDERFUL!  Tender, moist, shredded right apart with two forks, not rubbery at all, and HEALTHIER!  I made my own BBQ sauce and added it to the mixture.  DELISH!!!!

Good recipe. Make sure to use Baby Rays!! I would also add more flavor to the pork if you like a lot of flavor. I rubbed liquid smoke, garlic, and lawrys on the picnic shoulder. I also used 1 cup of beef broth.

Very Nice Recipe.  I cooked this in the crockpot with beef broth and coke on low for 10 hours.  I then strained out the juices and stored it in the refrigerator over night.  I added Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce and reheated the next night for dinner.

This was delicious.  I didn't know if I should have transferred juices with the pork, I did and it was good but very messy but the juices were delicious.  Either way, whatever it is...was easy and delicious and i would say the best crock pot meal I have ever made

This is one of my family's favorite dishes of all time.  All 3 of my picky-eater kids (ranging from 17 to 4yrs) will eat it and go back for seconds.  I've used it for countless parties where a large dish was needed and many people have asked where I ordered from!  I use the Sweet Baby Ray's Barbecue Sauce and it is delicious!  I also use a Pork Loin or Butt as other reviewers said.

I did as others suggested and chopped about 1/3 cup of onion to place on the bottom of the slow cooker before adding the pork. I also seasoned the pork with garlic powder and black pepper before placing it in the cooker. I dislike shredding meat (it's a tedious job) but it was worth the effort - I toasted a hoagie bun with provolone and piled the barbequed meat on top and it was great!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

I have made this so many times and it is a hit everytime I serve it.  I even made it for my husbands lodge night and all the men raved about it.  It one of our favourites.  Really good for superbowl and parties too.  We use the leftovers to make pulled pork pizza, with red onions and the barbeque sauce again.  Great.

WARNING: Be sure to DRAIN the beef before adding the BBQ sauce.  The first time I wasn't paying attention and I accidentally added the BBQ sauce and it was (obviously) super watery.  Second time I made this I drained the beef, but I still felt like it wasn't enough and when I froze/thawed it out the beef was still in a watery bbq-sauce.  Short of patting the  beef dry (which I'll probably do on my third attempt), I would recommend drying out your crockpot before putting the beef back in, then adding the BBQ sauce.

I didn't end up putting the meat in a dutch oven but instead cooked the pork on low in the crock pot for 6 hours with the beef broth, then drained the broth,and added bbq sauce. I shredded the meat and continued to cook it in the crock pot for another 1 hour on low. Great recipe, thanks!

this was good and easy.  I put my roast in the crockpot for 12 hours on low then took it out and shredded it.  Mixed with "A very popular BBQ Sauce" recipe on this website and put it back in the crockpot for 1-2 hours more.  Served on onion buns with shredded cabbage. YUM!

This recipe is bone-head simple and SO delicious!   I made this for Christmas dinner (along with a beef brisket and cheesy potatoes - yum!).  My brother walked in my house and said, "It smells like pulled pork!" and then proceeded to sit down and eat seconds, thirds, fourths of it until all platters were empty.  He wasn't the only one to get a second helping, either.  And my aunt has asked me for "my" recipe.  :)  Slight changes:  I use bullion & water instead of canned broth - because that is what we have on hand.  I used a pork shoulder instead of ribs because it was what I found, and very affordable.  And since I have neither a dutch oven or iron skillet, I simply put the meat on a baking tray when it comes to the oven step.  I've made this recipe twice already with excellent results.  Try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed!

I used a 7 lb pork butt.  I first cut all visible fat and then. cooked it on high in the crock for about 8 hours.  In the crock I put a layer of sliced onion rings on the bottom, then the pork, then I used a few dashes of worshteshire sauce, liquid smoke, and a tsp. of minced garlic.  Poured 16 oz. of low salt beef broth over it.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce but my advice to you is to use whatever bbq sauce you enjoy.  After removing, I shredded it and removed any visible fat I saw that remained, no big deal and easy to do.   I do believe the oven step is important to give a little browning to the beef which greatly adds to the texture.  This is EXCELLENT bbq pork and makes a generous amount, would be great for tailgates or parties.  I will no longer be buying it already made at my local butcher for $10/lb!  I have been looking for a recipe like this for ages, thanks so much!

Sooo good!  I used a 7 lb, trimmed bone-in pork butt, cooked it on low for 9 hrs and went easy on the bbq and set a bottle of sauce out in case people wanted more.

Absolutely wonderful.  I used the least expensive cut of pork I could find and cooked on low for 8 hours.  I also didn't have the canned beef broth so I used beef bouillon granules mixed with water to make my own.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ after shredding the pork and let it sit overnight.  Amazing and so easy.  I will definitely be making this again and again.

Good recipe but I followed other suggestions. I cooked the pork ribs overnight with onion, beer and 1/2 cup bbq sauce. Drained well and shredded the pork and added a can of coke and a bottle of bbq sauce. Cooked on low heat for an additional 2 hours. Did not bake but I will try that next time. Turned out great!!

This was great!  Please take the time to put the pork in the oven with the sauce as this allows the sauce to almost caramelize and really soak into the meat.  I found that my meat needed 10 hours in the crock pot (I used a 4lb shoulder roast) but I didn't have 10 hours so when I found it wasn't done at 8 hours I simmered it on the stove top for about 40 min and it was perfectly tender but not mushy.  Something to add:  I put a layer of thickly sliced onions on the bottom of the crock just for flavor and to keep the meat from sticking to the bottom. I also think I will leave out the broth next time and just use water and season my meat!  So good and cheap!

I will never make Pulled Pork any other way !  This was FAB ! I added 1 large Vidalia onion chopped into the Crock Pot.  I used Bulls Eye Sweet and Tangy BBQ sauce for the sauce.  Better than any sandwich I've had in a BBQ Restaurant.  Next time we will try it with my husband's home made Bourbon BBQ Sauce.  Served with Sweet Potato Fries, Cole Slaw and Corn on the Cob for our  Memorial Day BBQ.

Easy and delicious.  I used a 6lb pork butt and cooked on low for 9 and a half hours with 2 cans of reduced sodium beef broth, 1/2 cup Sweet Baby Ray's and large slices of onion.  The meat just fell apart and right off the bone. I then baked it for 1/2 hour with 40oz of Sweet Baby Ray's.  I served with white and whole buns.  Everyone loved them.  My 6 yr old even loved them & they made great leftovers.  I highly recommend this recipe.  Especially w/ Sweet Baby Ray's.  It is one of the only BBQ sauces I like.

I modified some parts of this recipe for a quicker meal and less dishes. First I purchased pork butt for the recipe instead of the chops. With the economy nowadays I need to pinch every penny I have. I trimmed about 75% of the fat off of the meat before putting it in the slow cooker with the beef broth. I added a dash of brown sugar (just a tiny amount..it makes the meat even more tender and sweet). After cooking about four hours on low I removed the meat and shredded it. I emptied to crock pot of juices and put meat back in crock. I added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, Bullseye BBQ sauce, and some Frank's red hot sauce.

The end product was amazing. I just finished my meal and ate way too much but it felt so good! This will become a regular in my meals!

This is so easy and so good. I have made the recipe as written, but to save time and dishes, I prefer to put the meat in the crockpot with the bbq sauce (no broth) and then shred it after a while. I leave it in until it's dinner time. No extra dishes!

Absolutely fabulous.  I used the cheapest piece of pork I could find (pork butt roast), so there was a lot of fat that I had to take out when I shredded the pork.  I had the meat in the crock pot for about 4 hours on low and 2 hours on high, and there was no problem shredding the meat, and the fat just fell off.

I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce as well.  Great recipe for a busy night!!

I also used a cheaper cut (pork butt) and cooked this in my crock-pot all day (9hrs). I then removed the pork, shredded it and placed it back into the crock pot with about 2 cups of bar-b-q sauce.  Everyone who's had it loved it.  Also, the best way to recreate it is to save and freeze all the liquid the pork was simmering in for next time you make the recipe

I've made this recipe  a number of times.  So easy, so very good.  After I shred the pork I add the Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and then add 1/4 to 1/2 can of beef broth to keep the taste richer and a little less of just the BBQ flavor. I add it back into the crock pot and let it cook 15 minutes more.  yummy

This was delicious!! We used almost 9 pounds of boneless pork tenderloin. We sliced an onion on the bottom of the crockpot, then slit the meat and put whole cloves of garlic throughout the meat for extra flavor. We put one more onion sliced on the top of the meat and then poured 2 cups of beef broth over. Then we covered and let it cook on high for 1 hour and a half and then rest on 7 hours on low. We used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce of course which made it absolutely delicious. Served with baked beans and corn on the cob. Perfect meal which was greatly enjoyed by everyone.. and plenty of leftovers for at least 2 different nights for 5 adults.

I made this for a family dinner and it was VERY well received.  I used the Kraft Brown Sugar BBQ sauce others had mentioned and I did the entire process in the crock pot and did not use the oven.  It was fine that way.  Thanks for posting this great and easy recipe!

This was delicious and easy!  I used the Whole Foods 365 brand chipotle barbecue sauce.  It gave it a nice tang.   I also used an inexpensive 2.5 lb boneless pork shoulder I think.

This recipe was perfect!  That said, I altered it a little according to the reviews I read before starting.  First off, I coarsly chopped an onion and added it and a peeled clove of garlic to the beef broth.  I used pork shoulder, and used a pork rub on it before putting it together.  It cooked on high for about an hour, then on low for another 5-6 hours, and the meat was falling off the bone.  If it wasn't hot, I wouldn't have needed forks to shred it.  I used a doctored-up barbeque sauce, adding a little vinager and whatever else I had lying around that sounded good.  Overall, a fantastic recipe - definitely one I'll keep around and do again frequently.  Thank you!

Although this was a flop for me I give it four stars because it has potential and I messed it up.  First of all I use Sweet Baby Ray's all the time but it did not taste right in this sandwich.  Also, I over-shredded the meat.  I should have left some chunks of meat in there because I cannot stress enough how nasty this looked.  I made it to take to a party but I had to take something else because I knew one look at this and no one in their right mind would touch it.  So go easy on the shredding.  I will make this again but with a different sauce.

AWESOME! I made it in the crockpot on low with the beef broth for 8 hours, then took it out and pulled it apart with two forks, and poured the liquid into a bowl.  i put the pork BACK IN the crockpot becasue I didnt want to be bothered with cleaning another pan!  i poured bbq sauce - sweet baby rays - and most of the beef broth back in and let it cook for about half an hour.  Heated some rolls in the oven and served with homemade french fries.... yummy!

This is the best recipe.  I don't even like pork and I make this at least once a month. My husband asks me to make this for every party that we attend.  I let the pork sit in the crook pot for about 10 hours in the broth with a clove of garlic to add more flavor.  The BBQ sauce does make the difference so choose carefully.  I like the Jack Daniels Original.  Thanks for this easy and great recipe.

We enjoyed this recipe.  Very easy, simple to do!  I did put back in crock-pot after adding just enough BBQ to coat meat and 4 or 5 tablespoons of the beef broth too.  Stirred and cooked on low until ready to eat.  I used country-style ribs and only about half the amount of ribs called for, made enough for two people with some leftover.  Cooked on Low about 6 hours.  Very moist.  Thanks KK.

Great recipe. I'm from the south, but now live in the north, and every now and then I get a craving for BBQ pork sandwiches... but have noticed the north lacks the BBQ restaurants so prevalent in the south. This recipe tastes a lot like the sandwiches from a restaurant I used to visit in the south. I used 4.5 pounds of boneless pork ribs, but only used one 18 ounce bottle of Kraft Original BBQ sauce. I also mixed in some of the leftover beef broth to make it a little more moist, and let the mixture heat up in the slow cooker rather than in the oven. I'm not a huge fan of BBQ sauce, so I think the 18 ounce bottle to only 3 pounds would have been way too much for my tastes. One bottle to 4.5 pounds had just a hint of BBQ flavoring that wasn't too little or too overpowering. I noticed everyone here is using Sweet Baby Ray's, but I thought the Kraft tasted just fine (I would imagine if you like a lot of BBQ sauce, then the brand/taste would matter more.) If you're like me, I'd recommend adding the sauce a little at a time and taste testing rather than dumping the entire bottle in.

This is awesome.  I used boneless pork ribs.  The only thing I did different, was to sprinkle meat with garlic powder added diced green pepper and 1 medium onion. Let the meat cook in the slow cooker for four hours on high, drained juice, reserving 1/2 cup otherwise it comes out to runny.  Shredded pork and added it along with the peppers and onions back to crockpot with reserved juice, 1 1/2 bottles of Famous Daves bold barbeque sauce and let cook for another two hours on low to blend flavors. Make sure you stir every 20 to 30 minutes after adding the sauce so it don't burn.  My co-workers loved it and you have less dishes to clean up. Thanks for the post, this is great.

Absolutely delicious and way too easy!  I used a boneless pork loin and cooked for 8 hours on low.  I then drained the meat, shredded it, and put it back in the slow cooker with an 18 oz. bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's.  I wish, however, that I had another bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's on hand to add a little extra to my sandwich to make it super sloppy!  We used regular old hamburger buns with sesame seeds, and I served the sandwiches with potato chips and Restaurant-Style Coleslaw-I from this site. What a spectacular meal for a Sunday afternoon watching football!  Thanks for the recipe--who would have known something so simple could be so outrageously yummy?!

This was awesome!  I made this on Saturday for dinner.  I put the roast (pork picnic shoulder) in the crock pot at 8am on low.  At 4pm, I drained the liquid, shredded the pork with 2 foks (it came apart very easily) and put it back on the crock pot on Warm for another hour with some more bbq sauce only.  Served on Kaisers with fries.  FANTASTIC!!  Will definitely make this again.  My boyfriend loved it.  The meat almost melted in your mouth, it was so tender!  Thank you KK!

One of the easiest and best recipes in my collection, and so delicious that I will search no more for a bbq pork recipe.  It's very versatile and can be adapted to your personal taste just by the sauce you choose to use.  I was pressed for time, so I cooked/shredded it one night, and baked it with the sauce the next.  Thanks for sharing what will become a standard dish in our house!

This was amazing!  I used a boston butt roast, chicken stock, water, and onion.  Once meat was done, I took it out of the slow cooker, pulled it, poured the sauce over it, and finished it in the oven like the recipe recommended.  It is tempting to just add sauce to the slow cooker, but let me tell you, like many of the other reviewers, baking it makes it so much better!  Don't skip this step, it is worth washing another pan!

I combined some other reviews. I used pork shoulder for a cheaper cut and cooked it for 11 hours on low with a bottle of beer instead of broth. Then shredded and mixed with BBQ sauce. Next day, put it back in the slow cooker til noon. Everyone gobbled it down on toasted buns with chips and fruit. Not my favorite slow cooked pork but definitely the easiest and plenty good.

SO easy & super yummy! My Texan in laws (Texans love their BBQ) raved about it, & my mom who hates everything LOVED it. Great for company! Much easier though if you just get a roast, that way you don't have to fuss with bones at all. I've tried it both ways & it tasted the same to me!

I used a pork butt, too, and a rub with no liquid in the crock pot! Turned out GREAT - definitely needed that last half hour in the oven with the bbq sauce. The reviews here were really helpful! I would suggest reading through a bunch. This recipe IS as easy as it looks!!

My daughter's first words after her first bite were, "This is good. Mom, you've outdone yourself." For a girl who often doesn't finish everything on her plate, this was music to my ears! Thank you!
Like others, I changed it a bit: I added more broth, used a pork loin, put onion slices in the bottom of the crock pot and cooked it all day. Then made a batch with the onions mixed in and one without. Used Stubb's Original BBQ sauce. Piled it on soft fresh kaisers -- Delish!

This is really simple and easy to do.

I would say to leave the pork in the crock pot for at least 7hrs. I used 3lb. pork shoulder before and around 7hrs it was still stringy, but you were able to pull it apart. 

I tried it again, but left the pork in for 9hrs and it was perfect. Very soft and tender when it came out.

Can't go wrong with this recipe!

This is a good recipe, but try making your own barbq sauce with Root Beer or Cola.

Cook your pork in 1/2 c. rootbeer or cola in the slow cooker til it falls apart.   while that is cooking, in saucepan, pour one can rootbeer, bottle of chili sauce, and simmer covered for 30 minutes.  take off lid and cook longer to reduce, if you want it thicker. 

Once your pork is done in the slow cooker, shred and put the pork in the sauce and let it sit to absorb more flavor.  yummy!

Same as everyone else says, it's awsome.  I got 3lbs boneless pork ribs at Wegmans for $9 which I thought was reasonable.  Only cooked in crockpot 3 hours.  I kept thinking it was too simple and must need more seasoning but it was perfect.

I use 3 lbs. boneless country ribs with a cup or so of broth in slow cooker. Usually put on at night before bed and in the a.m. (10-12 hours) I let cool and shred.  I add 1 1/2 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and a little of the broth and mix well and put in a 9x13 pan. I leave in the fridge all day while at work and then bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes, stirring every once in awhile. I prefer serving on potato buns, but is delicious no matter what-even not on a bun!  Except for removing the fat and shredding it couldn't be easier or more delicious!

These are super easy, tender & very yummy! I used pork butt ribs, 2 C. beef broth & cooked on high in crock-pot for about 5-6 hrs. These were falling apart when transferred to skillet to coook w/ BBQ sauce in oven. Made with cole slaw & baked beans. Makes a lot for get togethers.

Made this for our safari birthday party (except we called it BBQ'd Water Buffalo!). It was awesome.  We bought 3 huge pork butts, cheaper cut, took a while cutting some fat off of them, threw them in the crock pot with beef broth (bouillon cube style), shredded with forks, drained the broth off put it in the fridge, reheated it the day of the party (putting sauce on right before people got there) and people cleaned this stuff up.  About 5 or 6 people asked me how to make it. Used Super Smokers sauce (original recipe), everyone loved it.

This was good and easy.  I cooked the pork and shredded, then put in fridge overnight and finished next day.  Used a local BBQ sauce, was very good.  Makes a LOT.  Froze half for another day.  Thanks for the recipe!

Nice and easy, very tasty, and for variety just use different barbecue sauces and rolls. A good standby.

So simple, I always get rave reviews for this. Try using the small Hawaiian Rolls to make Pulled Pork Sliders...topped with Coleslaw, they are amazing!

Wonderful! The garlic is pretty stout, though. We drained the meat and cleaned the chunks of onion and garlic off then added our favorite bbq sauce to the crock pot and the shredded pork and heated up for an additional 30 minutes. Great!

Followed the recipe exactly but used a pork butt roast (cheaper).  It's the best Pork I've ever made.  The whole family loved it.  I'm excited I found this recipe.

I realized when I got home from the store I didn't buy enough pork, which meant I had to kind of eyeball the bbq sauce. I should have added more. I use Famous Dave's Sweet & Sassy, our favorite. Hard to go wrong with this recipe if you like your bbq sauce. It was really great!

This was very good! I wouldn't say this is the best pulled pork I've had, but I would make it again.  I added onions to the liquid and used the bourbon whiskey BBQ sauce from this site.  Do not skip the oven baking step, it adds a little something to the meat!

after reading the reviews n seeing the popularity of this dish, i thot it wld really b super awesome. well, it wasn't bad, but neither did it deserve such rave reviews i think. actually i didn't really understand y i had to cook in beef broth, because as it turned out, after cooking the pork overnight in beef broth, and aft smothering all the bbq sauce on the meat, i cld only taste the bbq sauce with pork. there was no hint of beef on the meat at all. in essence, i cld hv jus boiled the meat in water until its soft enough to be shredded and then smother the bbq sauce on it...i don't think there's gonna b much of a diff in taste. overall, not a super great recipe, but not that bad so just 3 stars fm me!

I made it similar to the suggested method, but cooked it much longer in the slow cooker.  I think it was in for 12 hours under beef broth then another 5 hours only 1/2 submerged in the broth.  

It turned out so good that I think I will never purchase a pork BBQ sandwich at the fairs again.  This was much better.  

I mixed the BBQ with the "big al's kc bar-b-q sauce" recipe from here on AR.  Try it all together and you will be amazed.

It's hard to get me to like something with BBQ, and let me say, this is amazing! 

I added one packaged of onion soup mix, a full onion, and used Sweet Baby Ray's.  I added 1/4 cup of the BBQ sauce with cooking it with the pork, onion soup mix, beef broth and onion. I will be using this recipe again!

I didn't have a can of beef broth, so I crushed 2 beef bouillon cubes and added water. I chose to use a honey BBQ sauce and it was delicious! My meat-loving boyfriend was done with his first serving before I was able to sit down! We used this on sandwiches for the following few days. It was also great to come home to smell dinner ready after a long Monday at work. Will use again!

I made this yesterday. Followed exactly as written. The Hubby loved it. I must say I did not. Maybe it was the BBQ sauce I used. Budweiser BBQ Sauce. I gave it 5 stars because he liked it so much and the ease of making it. I may try again and use a different sauce.

Hubby said was delicious and he is hard to please!  I will definitely make again.  I used herb gravy mix for beef and 1 cup water instead of beef broth.

This port is perfect for football season!  

If you are questioning the pork ribs, please don't.  Turned out PERFECT.  

I had about four pounds of meat, instead of three, I added a can of beer to the stock.  I also used unsalted stock and added salt to taste with the sauce before going into oven.

Thanks KMB233!

The meat turned out pretty good.  The only thing that needs to be worked on is finding the perfect bbq sauce.  A great dish to make a head

I found pork loin on sale and had the butcer cut it into "ribs"...I placed in crock pot with the beef broth and a little pepper and put crock pot on high.  About 5 hours later I grabbed a fork and it just fell apart as I put the fork to it.  I added the BBQ sauce and let it simmer for about an hour...it was Delicious and so simple...dinner was on the table in minutes...BBQ sandwiches wit coleslaw!  Thanks for this simple recipe!  I will be making this on a regular basis!!!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and my wife and I think it's better than any restaurant or even street side smoker shacks.  We live in in Virginia and have traveled the east coast from Florida to VA and it beats them all.  I used carolina style sauce and a homemade mayonnaise-less cole slaw also from this site and it was A+.  This is my first review and this will be a staple because of its ease to make and incredible taste.  Thank you for this recipe.

Made this for the first time today and it turned out great.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I also didn't have a dutch oven so I covered the removable part of the crock pot and placed that in the oven.  I don't if it had the same effect but eventually I will invest in a dutch oven.  Overall everyone enjoyed and I will definitely make this again!

It doesn't get much easier then this. (Especially if you use a crock pot liner to begin with!)  The amount of reviews this recipe has received, speaks for itself.  What a great recipe.  Everyone loved it.

This is the best dinner I've made yet! The entire family loved it! I used boneless porkloin and after pulling it I added salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I used Jack Daniels original BBQ sauce. It was delicious and easy and I will be making this again and again!

I just made couple changes the first time I made this. I bought a 3 lb. pork loin (bone in) because there are only two of us.  I cooked it on high for 4 hours and then on low for 3. When I switched it to low I added one packet of onion soup mix, started to shred the pork and flipped it over so the top wouldn't dry out. Then when it was done in the slow cooker I finished shredding it and put it in the dutch oven. I saved some of the juice from the crockpot and put it in the bottom of the dutch oven because I was worried about it drying out in the 30 minutes, added my pork and one bottle of Sweet baby rays. Turned out perfect and juicy!!

So simple, yet so good. I used Bubba's Best BBQ Sauce, another allrecipes choice which I have used for other BBQ projects. It made for a good pairing. This recipe will be a staple when I want something delicious and easy out of my slow cooker.

This was absolutely amazing! We followed the recipe exactly since it was our first time with this recipe and I wouldn't change a thing! The spare ribs might be more money but they are worth it since we have never had such success with using a roast. This will definitely be made many more times!

I really liked it but Nick is not a huge fan of pork.  This made great leftovers for sandwiches and it was super easy to make as it just sat in broth all day then ripped apart and tossed in BBQ sauce.

Holy moly, was this recipe good! I used a 3 lb pork butt roast, a can of low sodium beef broth and Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar barbecue sauce. I removed as much of the fat as possible before cooking. The meat was so tender it kept falling apart while trying to take it out of the crock pot. Everyone loved it and hubby will even eat it as leftovers! He never does leftovers so I know this one is a winner.

This is a huge hit at our house. I use beer in place of the beef broth. I've been trying different kinds. IPA's and darks. Each one leaves a little flavor behind. So good!!! and Baby Rays bbq sauce!
My daughter who refuses to eat meat loves this.

Really good, moist shredded pork.  I used pork shoulder because its what the store had.  I put it in the crock pot with only the broth and cooked on low for 10 hours (overnight).  I took it out and shredded it.  I tossed out the liquid in the crock pot, put the pork back in and poured the bbq sauce over it.  I heated it up and served it on hamburger buns.  So good!!

My only issue is that the recipe title and picture calls for a sandwich. However, the recipe does not include the buns. Once you include the buns this is no longer a low-carb recipe (which is what I'm browsing for). Could make for an interesting wrap using low-carb wraps.

Super easy recipe to make.  Taste was good, but not as tangy as some pulled pork sandwiches I've had.  May depend on the BBQ sauce you use.  I used Stubb's.

I've made this a couple times, and it always comes out great! The first time, I followed the recipe exactly and bought the boneless pork ribs. They, of course, were delicious. After that first time, I've been using pork butt, and it comes out just as good - much cheaper and more available too. Like other reviewers, I don't think 4 hours is long enough. I let mine sit for at least 8 hours. Thanks for the recipe!

Really this is awesome!  However, the time to shred the meat took longer than expected.  Next time, I'll buy the pre-shredded pork at the store, and slow cook it in the crock pot.

Pork turned out well.  Was not able to get boneless roast, so took much longer to cook.  Used less of the broth..and will probably use 1 cup next time as it would have been better if thicker.

Where I went to college (Idaho) this was simply called "BBQ" I've always wanted to try this and it was the first recipe I tried from this site. It was fantastic! I especially love using the BBQ sauce you can get at Costco called "sweet baby rays" its fantastic! and you don't need the whole bottle.

First time cooking pork in a slow cooker and was very nervous I'd screw it up somehow. Used a pork butt, as others suggested. After I shredded it I draiend the excess liquid, places back in slow cooker, added bbq sauce and a bit of beef broth I had remaining. Everyone loved it! Will definately make again.

I added additional items, as several others did.  We like our bbq tangy, so I added lemon juice, hot sauce, brown sugar, garlic salt & cajun seasoning, along with the bbq sauce.  We let that all cook together with the meat for approximately 3 hours after breaking meat apart.  The flavor was great!

This was fantastic!  I used a 3 lb boneless pork roast instead and cooked it in the beef broth for 4 hours, then let sit in the fridge overnight.  I put it back on high in the morning for 1 hour, then removed the roast and dumped out the liquid.  I shredded the meat, put back in the crockpot, then added 2 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Chitpotle barbecue sauce and turned it on low until heated through.  I served on mini asiago cheese rolls.  The kids loved it!  Will definately be making again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'd really give this more like 4.5 stars if that were an option! Made it for a quick and easy dinner, and everyone loved it. All I did was set the meat in the crock pot and left it for the day - when I came home it was ready and pretty much shredded as I pulled it out. SOOO easy and good! We also had a lot of leftovers which my family was happy for as well!

Used pork butt roast and slow cooked thru the night before, and put it in the fridge before leaving for work.  When I got home, I skimmed the fat, and removed the larger pieces of fat from the roast.  They came off eailsy, in big chunks.  I Turned he cooker on high, and let it cook for an hour or so.  After pulling the roast apart with 2 forks, I added enough room-temp Stubbs BBQ sauce to make it nice and saucey.  Skipped the oven, served on potato rolls with coleslaw.  Perf!

I forget which cut of pork I used, but it comes in a net - maybe butt.  I put this in the slow cooker with beef broth and a 1/2 bottle of beer for 8 hours on low.  Shredded it up and added Barbecue sauce then refrigerated overnight.  The next day I put it back in the slow cooker for 4 more hours and....Wow!

Tastes better than the bbq joints' version! My crock pot is huge so I do this on the stove. I use pork stew meat and add beef broth. Cook on low heat for 3 hours. Transfer pork to baking dish and cover in bbq sauce. I use sweet baby ray's. Cook 30 minutes! SOOOOOO yummy. My changes are minor and out of necessity, really.

These turned out delicious!!! I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce. It added a good sweetness to it. I also threw the pork on the grill for a few minutes for some charred ends.

I've made this recipe multiple times and it hasn't failed me yet! I add chopped onion to the pork and broth. I'm a fan of using Sweet Baby Rays (original) or Stubbs for the BBQ sauce. It is a must to put it in the oven, just so the pork gets a little crisp (makes a nice texture difference). I usually put 3/4 of the sauce in at first, then once it is done, put the rest in. So easy and so yummy! Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is so easy to make, I substituted the beef broth with beer as another reviewer did and it worked out wonderful.  I also kept mine in the crock pot for about 6 hours on high.  Meat was super tender and was a huge hit with my husband.  I'm  planning on using this for my next pot luck at work since it was so tasty..

This was excellent.  Cooked with 12 oz of beer and then added 2 oz of beef broth.  Added onion powder, garlic powder and an onion.  Cooked on high 4 hrs then cooked on low for 3 hrs in the crockpot.  Fell apart super easy.  Used Budweiser Barbeque sauce along with Cattleman's Barbeque sauce.  It was to die for.  Thanks for sharing.

These were good.  I also would suggest draining very well before adding sauce, and not shredding very much before mixing...

Didn't change a thing on the recipe and it came out very tasty.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (our favorite).  Served this to 4 adults and everyone had seconds, and there is still plenty left for two more sandwiches for my husband and I.

So, I had  2 1/2 lbs of pork shoulder country style  ribs to use up.  I followed the directions, but used 12 oz of beer instead of beef broth which I didn't have.  I rubbed the ribs the day before with some granulated garlic and some Emirils Rib Rub. Cooked it for 5 hours on high in the crock pot. I just shreddded the meat and it's delicious.  Just waiting now until dinner time to finish it up in the over.

So simple, and delicious.  Great the way it is, but you can also leave the BBQ sauce off, and let people put their own on, though I like it mixed up.

This is an awesome recipe for a no fuss meal.  So quick and tasteful the way it is.  Don't alter it at all! Just make sure you use the Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  Our family of four got two dinners out of this.  This has become a family favorite!

Easy Tastsatisfied my family!  What more could you ask for.  I too did not put the pork in the oven I just put itback in the crock pot and cooked on low for about an hour.  I did add a little of the liquid that I drained out about 2 ladles full.

Very good!  Don't put the pork back in the crock pot after you add the sauce.  Put it in the oven as the recipe calls for.  The pork gets so good.

I made this for my family for New Years. I used 0ne can of beer in the slow cooker instead of broth. Cooked in slow cooker for 3 and a half hours on high. It was so tender you can split it with a fork. I pulled it apart, mixed it with bbq sauce and put in the over for the 30 minutes. It was the best pulled pork sandwiches we ever had! THANK YOU for this great recipe. Will make again.

Ridiculously easy and delicious!  You can really use almost any cut of pork and it is always great cooked longer too.  I set mine for 6 hours, pulled it out at 5 hrs, shredded it and returned it to simmer for the last hour.

OMG  this was so good. I used boneless pork shoulder. I added 3 cans of the beef broth. I wanted the broth to cover most of the meat. When it was time to take it out the meat just fell apart! I didn't do step 2 and 3. I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce like others said and it was just right! Will be making this again!!!

Very good.  I took other reviewer's suggestions and used a pork butt.  I cooked the pork for 10 hours in the crock pot and it shredded very easily.  I let it marinate in the BBQ sauce overnight and warmed it in the crockpot the next day.

I could not say enough about this.  My family went CRAZY for it.  It is so simple yet delicious.  I have also made this with beef, and it was just as yummy.  This is a sure keeper.  I am sure my family and I will be having this for years and years.  Thanks a bunch for this one!  p.s I love Sweet Baby Rays and would never use any other bbq sauce, for anything.  All of you that have not tried it, its a must!

This was good and simple. Tip: If you want to make it for two, you need only 1lb. of pork, and even that leaves leftovers. The pork will cook in about two hours instead of 4. Also, be choosy about the type of BBQ sauch you use. It's really the main taste of this dish so you should be aware of which you prefer; hickory, honey, etc. Great recipe.

I LOVE this recipe! It is so practical! I like to cook it on LOW for 7-8 hours so that I can have it cook while I'm at work. When I get home, I shred it, pop it in the oven, and in 30 minutes, it's ready! Thanks for this great recipe!

This recipe is great, but I had a bit of a disaster with it, as I bought 3 lbs. of ribs with the bone in.  By the time it comes to adding the bbq sauce, they're super juicy, and the bbq sauce doesn't stick at all to the meat, which you have to eat off the bone or spend too long cutting it off.  Not the same.  Be sure to use BONELESS ribs, so that the meat can shred like it should, and not be so juicy that all the flavorful drippings slide right off!

This was amazing and will be a regular recipe for family meals! All my store had was bone-in pork shoulder butt which worked extremely well. I added a few shakes of liquid smoke into the beef broth. It ended up cooking on high for about 10 hours before it was done. I removed the meat (no juices) from the crockpot and put it in the fridge overnight. About noon the next day I took it out, shredded the meat with my fingers, added 3 bottles BBQ sauce (it was a lot of meat!) and a few more shakes of liquid smoke. I cooked it on low in the crockpot with the lid OFF until dinner time. It had a great texture (not mushy) and a great smoky BBQ flavor.

EXCELLENT!!  I used 4 lbs of pork shoulder picnic roast (it was on sale) and it worked out wonderfully because it was fairly lean, only a bit of fat to trim off.  I used Baby Ray's Original BBQ sauce and followed the directions exactly, except I cooked for 4 hours on high, then 2 hours on low.  This will be added to my weekly meals, the kids gobbled up

My family loves pulled pork, especially the NC vinegar version. I made this just as suggested, with Baby Rays sauce, which I have never used before. Had unexpected company and served it for them. Everyone loved it, and all were BBQ lovers. the beauty is that it is so simple you cannot go wrong. I will make this again, and probably not even bother to try to improve it! Loved it as it was!

I love making this for my family! I added chopped onion, green bell pepper and garlic in the slow cooker. YUM! It gave the pork so much flavor that we only added a little BBQ sauce.

This turned out really well. I used "Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce" from this site.  Baking the sauce on in the oven made this far superior to my other attempts at bbq pork sandwiches.

Wow! Was this ever yummy!!! Made BBQ pork sandwiches for dinner Wed. night. I put everything (i.e. 3.5 lb. "family size" pkg. of pork shoulder / western style ribs & a 14 oz. can beef broth) in my slow cooker around 10 AM and set to cook on LOW for 9 hrs. When I got home around 2:30, my sc was off (argh!)!!! Since the meat was hot to the touch, I figured it couldn't have been off for too long.... Unsure of whether that was the case or not, I re-programmed my sc to cook on HIGH for another 4 hrs. As a result, my meat was tender and VERY easy to shred. I did as KMB233 recommended and baked my pork in a 350 degree oven for 30 min. My bf & I found the meat to be a tad dry, so I suggest anyone using the oven to reduce the baking time to 15-20 min. MAX. Having said that, I DO think this step is critical in order to get that "from the grill" texture as SKANDREWS mentioned - simmering in a sc is "OK," but won't yield the same end result. The same goes for the BBQ sauce you use (I suggest a VERY good quality store-bought sauce or your favorite homemade recipe). I used Sweet Baby Ray's hickory & brown sugar sauce which was ABSOLUTELY delicious. Served "generous" helpings on sesame sandwich buns w/ Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I by Marsha, BBQ kettle chips and a my last 2 bottles of Goose Island orange cream soda to wash it all down! Thx. for sharing :)

Thanks for a great recipe.  I followed this pretty closely.  Cooked country style ribs in beef broth for about 6 hours.  At that point the pork was very tender but still had texture.  I combined Austin's Own Chipolte and Sweet Baby Rays Sauces for the last step.  This was a good combination of sweet and hot.  This could be a great prepare ahead meal.  My southern hubby thought it was as good as any pulled pork that he has ever had and he has had a lot!

This recipe is by far the best one and the easiest one. Like many of the others I used a Boson Butt. It's much cheaper and extremely flavorful. I threw a 6-7 lb. butt in the crock pot with 2 cans of beef broth early evening and by morning (12 hrs later) it was done. The meat was so moist and tender it was already off the bone. What's so nice about this recipe is you can use whatever sauce you would like as there are so many different kinds of bbq sauces out there. I have made this recipe 3 times in the last several months and everyone just loves it.

This pork is absolutely delicious. I've done it twice now, once with a rolled pork butt, and once with shoulder chops. Both worked well - the shoulder chops were a bit easier because they had much less fat, but they were more expensive, too. Either works great. I really don't think there's a cut of pork that wouldn't work.  In the slow cooker, I used beef broth once, and beer once, and both were great.   For the baking step I used plain ol' Heinz Sweet and Spicy BBQ sauce, in a cast iron pan in the oven for 30-40 minutes. I can't recommend highly enough to not skip this step - it really seals in the flavour and makes for some dark, crunchy, baked bits. Gives more texture and much better flavour.   This recipe rules. I found it pretty messy on a bun, so I ate it wrapped up in tortillas with coleslaw. Faaaaaantastic.

This was the easiest, best BBQ I have ever made.  I was tempted to throw in an onion, because I was afraid it would not have enough flavor.  However, I decided not to and didn't miss it at all.  It was very flavorful.  I made it in the Crock Pot, just cooked it on low for 6-8 hours, drained the juice, added BBQ sauce and let it sit on "warm" for an hour or two.  We had nothing left over and I can't wait to make it again.

This truly is an unbelievable recipe.  I used a 3 lb pork butt cooked on low for 9 hours.  I assembled the sandwich with two Vlasic stacker pickles on a sesame seed hamburger bun.  I used 1 bottle of Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  How something this easy and inexpensive can taste this good is beyond me.

Really great recipe, but needed to add more bbq sauce than what was called for. In fact about another half bottle which made this dish perfect!

Excellent!  My entire family LOVED this recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, but didn't need to bake for the extra 30 minutes, only about five.

Delicious! However, I do highly recommend using beef bouillon instead of broth. I didn't have beef broth one time that I made this, so I substituted bouillon granules. It came out incredibly, and better than the times I used broth (which was still really good). I highly recommend pairing this recipe with the recipe for "Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce" found here. It is well worth the time to make this sauce. The two combined taste like restaurant pulled BBQ. (I halved the sauce recipe, and had plenty for 4 lbs of pork.)

This recipe is simple and awesome. My wife and I received our Hamilton Beach slow cooker (with interchangeable 2, 4 & 6 quart crocks) the other day and this was the first recipe we tried with it. Nancy picked up a 5lb pork butt from our local Genuardi's supermarket, and had the butcher remove the bone (he also trimmed the fat!). We used the 6 quart crock. Started at 8PM. Put 2 cans of broth in just to be safe (but after cooking realised 1 was enough) and then put in the 5lb slab of pork. Set it on low, and this morning at 6:15AM got up and it was so tender it shredded so easily! I didn't put it in the oven to do the final step. Just poured 1 bottle of BBQ sauce over half that we shredded, and froze the other non-shredded half. For 3 of us (my wife and our 1 yr old son) 5 lbs is going to go a long way! I know we're going to love this, haven't tried it yet, but will be enjoyng it at lunch for the next few days I can guarantee!

This recipe got emailed to me and so I decided to try it. I had a bunch of boneless pork chops in my freezer, so I decided to use those. I only had 1 can of beef broth on hand, and after reading the reviews wanted to make sure it didn't get dried out. So I decided to use a bottle of beer (like another reviewer had done) with the beef broth. I cooked it on low for 7 hours. It shredded very easily. I baked in a glass baking dish with a cover using Sweet Baby Rays. I put them on Hawaiian rolls that I grilled with a little margarine (IN-N-OUT style). I had seen them done like this as sliders at Ruby's Restaurant. Very delicious. Even my picky kids ate 3 of them!!

Wow...so easy and so good! I had a family pack of 7 Bone In Chops, but there is only 3 of us, so thought this was a good idea to use the whole pack at once. I put one can of broth in the crock. Sprinkled each chop, both sides, with Bad Byron's Butt Rub. (Can be found at some Kroger Stores.) Put it on low at 7 am, then at 7:30 pm, I used tongs to pull the chops and bones out into a pan lined with foil. The chops were so tender, I didn't even have to shred....just fell apart as I tried to lift it out of the crock! A local BBQ joint, Hog Wild, sells their BBQ Sauce in squeeze bottles, so I squeezed about 3/4 bottle onto the shredded pork, stuck it in the oven, and OH MY! The pork was good before I even put the sauce on it! We have enough left, I plan to use the rest tomorrow for Pulled Pork Fajitas!

This is SO EASY!  You can use roast instead of ribs.  Put the roast and broth in the crock pot for about 6-8 hours.  Then take the meat out and shred it with a fork.  Add your favorite bottled sauce and put it in the oven for about 30 minutes.  This is perfect if you know you're going to have a busy day and won't want to cook dinner later.  Just buy some baked beans and potato salad or chips and you have an easy dinner!

AWESOME recipe!  Not only is it easy  to make but it is absolutely delicious!  We do not like a lot of sauce on our barbecue so I only used about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of  Sweet Baby Ray Barbecue Sauce in the shredded pork.  I put the rest of the sauce out in case anyone wanted additional.  I followed the recipe exactly but next time I will try it with a Pork Butt or Shoulder instead of the boneless pork ribs.  Thanks for sharing!

Oh my goodness, this was my first time pulling pork and I am still amazed at how great it came out. I just used regular bone-in country style ribs. I like cooking with the bones, it imparts much more flavor. It'so tender by the time you pull it the fat separates itself from the meat and a lot of the bones fell out into the bottom of the cooker!

This makes a great sandwich! I didn't transfer the meat to the oven. I drained the juice, shredded the meat and returned it to the crock pot with the BBQ sauce for another hour. I served on toasted fresh dinner rolls (HEB has soft fluffy ones and they are perfect kid size..) and my husband ate 3!! My kids took them in their lunches the next day! I did season the meat (pork loin roast) with salt and pepper, dry mustard, garlic and paprika before I put it in the crock pot. De-lish!! Must have recipe esp. for busy weeks!!

This isn't quite what you get by smoking the meat for 6 hours in a smoker, but it's close.  I added a couple of shots of liquid smoke.  Very good and very easy.

VERY Good! I used a regular boneless pork rump roast and cooked it for a few hours longer in the crock pot. It just fell apart as I shredded it. Hubby said it was some of the best BBQ meat he's had. This BBQ is only as good as the sauce, though, so don't get a mediocre brand.

This was amazing! I was a little skeptical before making this recipe since it was so easy and I was afraid that it was "too good to be true". It turned out great! I served these on Colombo Sweet Rolls and I made 2 pounds of meat that was enough to feed about 4 of us. I skipped the step about putting it in the oven and instead I just put the shredded pork and BBQ sauce back in the crock pot and left it on low for 1 hour. I also used Kraft Brown Sugar BBQ sauce....the "thick and rich" version...

This recipe works beautifully with a good Carolina barbeque sauce.  This site doesn't have a very good authentic recipe for BBQ sauce, so I used my own.  A pork shoulder works just fine.  Skip the ribs, save some money.

EXCELLENT! I WAS RAISED IN THE SOUTH ON PORK BBQ & MY HUSBAND WAS INTRODUCED TO PORK BBQ IN THE LAST FEW YEARS(IN TEXAS BBQ IS BEEF, NOT PORK). WE BOTH ENJOYED THIS DISH. HE REALLY LOVED IT. ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT JUST LIKE MEMPHIS-STYLE PORK BBQ, IT IS EXTREMELY CLOSE! I USED A PORK SHOULDER ROAST WITH BONE (COULDN'T FIND BONELESS) AND COOKED IT FOR 6 HRS IN THE CROCKPOT. I TOOK PREVIOUS ADVICE AND TORE IT INTO CHUNKS (INSTEAD OF SHREDDING IT). IT JUST FELL OFF THE BONE. THEN I RETURNED IT TO THE CROCKPOT WITH 4T OF THE BROTH AND A BOTTLE OF SWEET BABY RAY'S SAUCE FOR AN HOUR. IT REALLY TURNED OUT DELICIOUS. THIS WILL DEFINITELY BE A FAMILY FAVORITE. I LOOK FORWARD TO SERVING THIS TO A LARGE PARTY OF GUESTS THIS SUMMER- IT WAS VERY VERY EASY TO MAKE.

This was really good! I used a pork rub on a 4.5 lb pork butt the night before & cooked in 2 cups beef broth for 6 hrs on high. Very little shredding was needed, it pretty much fell apart. I drained the broth, reserving about 4 tbs, which I put back in the crockpot with the meat & BBQ sauce. I turned the crockpot back on for about an hour to warm up sauce. Yum! Served on toasted rolls - - 3 guy-friends tried it and all loved it! Thanks for the recipe!!!!

This is a simple recipe.  I used pork loin roast instead of ribs and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, it came out great.  But next time I will make it a little bit chunkier, and not shred it so much.

This was a great recipe.  I used a pork loin roast and the meat just fell apart when I shredded it.  Put the shredded pork in the oven with a litte ElPaso BBQ sauce mixed in and it was wonderful!  My picky husband requested it for dinner again tonight.  Definately a hit and so very easy!

I used a 3 lb boneless pork loin instead and it was fabulous. I also used 2 beef bouillon cubes with 2 cups of water. I shredded up the pork and then added just a little BBQ sauce so that everyone could add as much as they wanted or use different flavors.

So simple and so good. I cooked it on low for about 8 hours, and then just put it back into the slow cooker with the barbeque sauce instead of in the oven. Used Famous Dave's Sweet and Zesty Barbeque sauce.

Thank you for this simple and great recipe.  I modified a few ingredients personally.  I used Pork Sirloin Tip Roast from Costco (very cheap $) and K.C. Masterpiece BBQ Sauce.  I used 2 cups of boiling water and 2 beef bullion cubes in place of the canned broth.  Finally, I made a dry rub from combining grill mates BBQ seasoning, Montréal steak seasoning, and garlic powder which I rubbed in really good before setting into the crock put/broth.  4 hours on high made it shred perfectly by stirring it with a fork (just like the recipe) and then like other reviewers I just drained the excess broth, put the BBQ sauce right in the crock pot, and set it to low for 30 minutes.  Perfecto!  This is an awesome recipe, and tastes great!  Use your favorite BBQ sauce, and next time I am going to experiment with adding smoke flavors and hot sauce =)  Thanks!

I've been eating this for a week now.  I made a big batch for my bunco club.  It was a hit.  Freezes well, so you can have a sandwich when the BBQ craving hits.  Boneless pork ribs go by the name "country style ribs" out here.

Tender and delicious! I doubled the recipe, using two 4-lb. pork shoulders (considering fat content and a little bone). I trimmed as much visible fat as I could before slow-cooking, and only used one can of broth. It worked great to put it on at bedtime. In the morning, I shredded it, rinsed the meat lightly with hot water to remove excess fat, and then added the BBQ sauce. It almost filled a 9"x13" pan and made 5 lbs. of meat w/sauce. Not counting the slow-cooking, it took less than 45 minutes to shred and prepare. I refrigerated it, then reheated the meat before serving later that day. Great recipe!

I LOVE THIS!! It's such a great, quick, simple recipe. I usually use a really cheap roast, around the 2½ - 3 pound range, instead of ribs. I also use a higher quality BBQ sauce than I use when grilling (I've tried Kraft sauces, and they just don't do the recipe justice.. Cattlemen's and Bullseye sauces are a lot better). Once the meat is cooked, I remove it from the cooker, empty the cooker of the broth, shred the meat, and then I put the meat BACK in the cooker with the BBQ sauce. I let it heat up for maybe another 45 minutes or an hour on high (check it after a while, and see if it's heating well), and it's good to go. Excellent with fries or chips and some salad. Thanks KK!!

This makes an exceptional BBQ sandwich.  The only alternation that I made was that I used a pressure cooker to cook the ribs with the beef broth.  I also added 3 cans of water to the pressure cooker.  The pressure cooker makes the meat so tender that it falls apart.  You can cook the meet in the pressure cooker for about 30 minutes on medium once the steam begins to rise.

Wow, this is one great recipe.  I do not have a slow cooker, so I cooked it in the oven (tightly covered) at 275 for about six hours.   It smelled soooo good.   For a real taste treat, serve it on Potluck Pan Rolls from this site.  It's downright howl at the moon wonderful!

Used a 5# bnls cc pork loin roast, left the fat on, it slid off after cooking. put onion on the bottom, covered the meat with broth, added garlic and pork seasoning mix. Cooked on low for 10 hours, shredded very easy. mixed with 3 bottles of KC Masterpiece let sit over night. Reheated the next day in the crockpot,
held great all afternoon at a party.
Thanks for a great idea.

The recipe is not only foolproof but also quite deliscious.I used a slowcooker, placed thick onion slices under the meat,then added the beef broth and cooked it on High for six hours for 4 lbs. boneless country ribs.

I just drained the liquid out then added the BBQ sauce to the crock pot for a half hour on low. I used pork chops because it was easier to trim the fat. Absolutely great!!!

I have tried many recipes and this is the first I am rating.  This was fantastic!  I made is for my sons birthday party and everyone loved it!  I made about 15lbs of ribs (using mostly trimmed boneless country style) the night before, cooking for 8 hours on low.  After shredding, I put it in a large tupperware bowl, added 3 ladels full of the broth and 3 bottles of bbq sauce.  I shook it until it was kind of blended and let it sit overnight.  I put it back in the crockpot the next morning and let it heat on low for about 4 hours.
I will be making this again and again and again!

I used a 4lb, bone-in pork shoulder. I slow cooked for 9 hours, drained broth/liquid & fat, shredded meet, removed more fat & bone, poured in bbq sauce, reheated and served on toasty buns. Excellent dinner, we both enjoyed it!

I don't have a butcher, I have a walmart. That's the type of city I live in so I make do. I couldn't find a cut of butt under 5 lbs, and it being just me at home (meal planning for the next week or so) I got another type of roast in 3 lbs. Cooked it according to the recipe, except the skillet / oven part, put it back into the slower cooker for that part, on high for one hour to two hours with bbq sauce and some of cooking liquid. Cook until liquid cooks down and thickens and pork starts to brown on the bottom. 18 oz is NO WHERE near enough sauce for this recipe. Went out to get another bottle.  Without the other bottle it's good, with the extra it's better though.  I do want to try this with a homemade bbq recipe though. Sweet baby rays is amazeballs, but I bet the spices come through stronger and more complex when it's fresh.

This was amazing, by FAR the best pulled pork I've ever made and definitely husband approved. I use sweet baby rays bbq sauce and buy boneless country style ribs from Sams club (they're dirt cheap there) and make enough to use in several meals over the next week, like pulled pork tacos and pulled pork nachos.

I have made this recipe exactly as instructed several times and each time I am impressed with how good it is.  Everyone loves it.  It is so easy to make.  Using the bbq sauce that your family enjoys makes the recipe yours.  Great Recipe KMB223, thanks for sharing.

I followed what other reviewers said and used a less expensive cut of meat (pork shoulder butt).  Put it in the slow cooker for 9+ hours and thought that may have been a little long because when I used two forks to shred (which was really easy, by the way), I felt like the meat was a little too overworked.  Did it the day before, added bbq sauce and put in fridge.  The day of the party I pulled it out a few hours ahead of time to reheat but ended up zapping in the microwave because it wasn't heating fast enough and guests were on their way.  Still, everyone (and I mean everyone) raved about it!!

This is now my go-to recipe for BBQ pork.  So easy...I slow cook in either beer or broth depending on what I have on hand.  My family loves it.  I bake in a 9x13 pan lined with tinfoil so there's no extra cleanup afterwards.  Any solid chunk of pork seems to work.

I was looking for something quick and easy to do with some boneless pork ribs I bought on clearance. I did add some extra spices to the cooking liquid but otherwise kept it the same. We just loved this and 10 stars for how darn easy it is to make.

I used an old potato masher to shred the meat and it worked great.  I make my own BBQ sauce and the meat was done way before 4 hours were up.  I liked the texture of the finished product using the boneless ribs.  Was nice and moist - not dry.

After reading the reviews I followed previous advice and bought a 4 lb pork butt. I put the meat and broth in the slow cooker for 10-11 hours, shredded it right away added the barbecue sauce and refrigerated it for a couple of hours. I put it back in the slow cooker for a couple of hours to reheat. It was delicious and very easy.  I have enough to make a second meal.

I made this for our 4th of July cookout and it was amazing.  I did two 5 lb pork butts in two separate crockpots.  I cooked them on high for 5 1/2 hours due to the bigger size but kept the beef broth to one can in each pot.  I shredded one by hand with two forks (took about 15 minutes), and the other one went into the food processor on shred (took about 30 seconds). Shredding one of the roasts in the food processor was a HUGE time saver, however, I would not recommend doing this for the entirety of the recipe though because it is a much finer chop and would probably taste very mushy without the larger hand shredded pieces to balance it out.  I then mixed both the chopped and shredded meat  together and returned them to the crockpot.  The meat fit into one crockpot once all the fat and bones were removed.  I stirred in 2 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Sweet and Spicy and One bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Original.  I set the crockpot on warm and left it in for the entirety of the cookout.  The meat went back into the crockpot at about 5 pm and stayed on the warm setting unil about 1 am.  No mushiness whatsoever.  This made TONS of barbecue so we were able to enjoy leftovers the next day and they were still fabulous!.  This recipe will DEFINITELY be a fixture at all our regular summer get togethers!

I love pulled-pork BBQ, but had never made it myself.  I couldn't believe how easy it was and how great it turned out!  Following the advice of other reviewers, I used a 4lb boneless pork loin roast and Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

Just ok for us.  Pork is quite tender, but not a lot of flavor.  I prefer to have seasoned meat & the BBQ sauce as a condiment.

The meat came out fine but it was totally bland.  I used a chipotle flavored bbq sauce and there was not enough flavor for me.  It needs something like red pepper flakes, apple cider vinegar, onion, chili sauce...something to give it a kick b/c it's just boring pork.

I used a 3.5 lb pork butt. I cooked it in my slow cooker for 4 hrs. I drained the broth and shredded the pork. I added the pork back into my slow cooker with approximately 1.5 cups of bbq sauce. I set the slow cooker on warm and warmed it up for 30 minutes then served. The pork was cooked perfectly. I added more bbq sauce on the pork sandwiches so everyone could have their choice of hot bbq sauce, mild bbq sauce or honey bbq sauce. For how easy this recipe is to make and the few ingredients required to make it, this really is a great recipe. A keeper! Especially for the nights I don't feel like cooking! Great leftovers too!

Really like it but it needs more... and less bbq. Use pork butt, much cheaper, add diced red onion and some minced garlic and about 1/4 less BBQ. Also serve topped with French fried onions on a wheat or onion roll.

SOOOOOO Mouthwateringly good!!! I used a  3.5lb pork shoulder, (pork Butt)  and 1 can of beef broth. Set it on low for 8 hrs in the crockpot and it was done! Shredding it was so easy, it literally fell apart to the touch. Just took out the bone and fat and it was amazing with the Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Also added about a 1/2 cup of remaining broth. (Extra tip: I strained the liquid and had amazing pork broth. Used it to make split pea soup! Best I ever made. Its a huge difference from using the chicken or vegetable broth. Has that really authentic pork flavor.)

I used "country style ribs" which were very inexpensive.  Followed the directions, added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, and had some of the best pulled pork ever!  I didn't believe the other reviews, but it was super simple, and delicious!

Like many other reviewers here, I used a boston butt instead of the boneless ribs. I soaked the meat in a brine solution overnight, then put a generous amount of dry rub on it before putting it in the crock pot. I also cut up an onion in thick slices and placed in the bottom of the crock. I placed the meat in fat side up. After cooking it on low for about 10 hours, I removed the bone (came out effortlessly!), let the crock cool and then placed the whole thing in the fridge. The next morning, I removed the cold fat off the top of the crock, then pulled the fat off the meat. I used forks to shred the meat, then added the sauce. Covered the pan with aluminum foil, placed in oven at 350 degrees to reheat. Made the sides while it reheated (used the leftover broth to cook rice in), family said it was the best bbq'd pork they've ever had. Since then, I have made the recipe as written, with soaking meat in brine the night before as the only adjustment. Just as good! Even though I followed the suggestions of others originally, with a few changes of my own, I still think this is the best pork recipe on the entire site. This one is definitely a keeper!!!

Absolutely THE BEST pulled pork I've ever had!  I've taken this pork to a birthday party and a family reunion, and I get rave reviews every time.  I never go home with much, even though I always double the recipe for company.  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is because I've been having a hard time choosing a barbecue sauce.  I love Sweet Baby Ray's, but it's just too sweet for me on pulled pork; I liked pulled pork to have a kick.  The best one in their line for this recipe is the Honey Chipotle version.  Jack Daniels was a little too salty.

Excellent!  I made this the day before in the crock pot on low for maybe 8 hours.  In addition to the broth I put some BBQ sauce in right away too. Before putting it in the fridge for the night I drained a lot of the liquid.  The next day I just restarted in the crockpot and it was great.  I skipped the oven part because I didn't want the extra work and it was great without!

This was pretty good, and very, very easy to prepare.  I prepared this around noon and turned it to high for the first four hours, and then after that it was on low for about another three hours, and this turned out so tender and delicious. Also a very economical meal since it makes a lot! Thank you for the recipe, and I'm sure I will probably make this again soon.

I used pork butt instead of ribs and and made my own bbq sauce out of ketchup, water, brown sugar, granulated sugar, black pepper, onion powder, dry mustard powder, fresh lemon juice, worcestershire sauce, apple-cider vinegar, corn syrup and paprika.   Turned out great.  My husband loved and son loved it.   I think that making the bbq sauce vs using bottled bbq sauce, made all the difference.

These were delicious! The leftovers made awesome quesadillas too. I added the leftovers to sauted red pepper and garlic, spread it onto tortillas and topped with cheese, green onion and cilantro. Placed another tortilla on top and heated it on the George Forman.  Yum!

Yum, Yum, Yum!  I used to cook my pork in the crock pot, drain the liquid, shred the pork, then pour the sauce into the crock pot.  It was good, but ended up being mush.  This method is so much better.  We loved it and will use it from now on!

Everytime I make this I get rave reviews!!!  And so easy.  I always use a pork loin. I toast the hamburger buns in a skillet, slice up some fresh sweet onion and put on the plate with a dill pickle spear.  My husband likes some sweet relish on his sandwich and serve with either potato chips or cole slaw.  5 star all the way.

I don't think I've ever made such a great meal that took so little effort, I almost had to laugh at how easy it is.  When I took the meat out of the slow cooker it was already shredding on its own, it was so tender.  I followed this recipe exactly except I added one thing....I put a baster full of the juice/broth into the empty barbecue sauce bottle, shook it up and emptied it into the meat and stirred it in before baking in the oven.  It just seemed a touch dry and I didn't have more bbq sauce to add.  Turned out fabulous.

This turned out so delicious!  Not mushy like other BBQ pork I have tried.  I used a Pork Butt and it worked like a charm.  Also, I prefer my BBQ a little spicy, so for the BBQ sauce I used Famous Dave's Texas Pit.  My husband and 5 year both had seconds.  I will make this again for sure!

My family really loves this recipe.  We like the pork cooked on low in a slow cooker for approx 8 -9 hours.  Very tender.

Don't skip the oven part!
I used a less-expensive cut of pork with great results!

I took other reviewer's suggestions and cooked a pork butt with no liquid on high for 4-5 hours, shredded it, drained the crock pot, and put it back in for an hour with some Bulls Eye bar-b-q sauce.  I've made it twice and everyone raves.  Can't believe how easy this is and how delicious!

Cooked in crockpot and must admit this did not look good at all until I pulled the meat out and started shredding it.  We shredded the pork, refrigerated overnight, then finished the recipe the next day.  Didn't use the whole bottle of sauce because it looked like it was going to be too goopy. Took a bit longer than 30 minutes in the oven- around 40 minutes.  Topped with coleslaw (a la Uncle Billy's).  Delicious!

This turned out really great! My husband has been really wanting me to make pulled pork for the longest time and I have been hesitant to try, but this recipe ended up making it much much easier than I expected. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and bought a pork roast (about 4lbs) I put in in the crock pot with a bottle of beer and about 2 cups of beef broth. I cooked it four about 5.5 hours (looking back, that was probably a about 1 hour too long). Then, I removed the roast, transferred it to a large glass baking dish and shredded it. Then I mixed in a 32 oz bottle of BBQ sauce (smoky-sweet worked great!) and put it in a 375 degree oven for about 15-20 minutes. IT WAS GREAT!! My husband loved it. And it made plenty, enough for several meals. The only thing I wished was that the meat was slightly more tender and juicy. It may have been the cut, or that I let it cook too long, as mentioned previously, but regardless it was great and I will be doing it again soon.

This recipe is perfect. The only thing I changed was added half a can of broth, and half a bottle of BBQ sauce in the Crock Pot so it would cook with the BBQ sauce flavor. The Pork was ready after 6 hours. (I used a nice pork roast) I moved it to a baking pan and shredded all of it, then added the rest of the BBQ sauce, stirred it all up and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. NOTE: Whenever I use bottled BBQ sauce, I always add to it, as it never seems tasty enough for me. I pour it into a bowl, then add a little of each until I'm happy with the results: cayenne pepper, hot sauce (Tapatio, Chalula, or Tabasco) garlic salt, crushed peppers (like the kind you get with pizza) Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper and whatever else you like to taste in your BBQ sauce. You also could add some beer, Whiskey, Bourbon, etc....

This is THE BEST pulled pork I have ever made. It just falls apart, I really don't have to do anything.  I use the boneless country style ribs, wine and beef bullion with some spices at 275 for 4-5 hours.  Then just a hint of BBQ.  I have some snobby, picky foodies in my family and they can't get enough of this.  Thanks for posting this, so easy too.

Super easy, I really thought I'd have to do more, but squeezed in some Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce after slow cooking 2 1/2 lbs of pork for 4 hours on high, put it in the oven just like it said in my Creuset, and called it a day. Never made it before but I'll certainly be making it again!

Recipes should be reviewed based on the original recipe.  I made this tonight as written, not taking any advice (I usually do take the advice though, but thought I'd try it without once), and it was not that great.  It was really dry and there was just not enough bbq sauce using an 18 ounce bottle.  I cooked it for the 4 hours on high and it was too dry and stringy.  Next time I'll try cooking it longer I guess.

The BBQ pork turned out wonderfully!  My husband even liked it, and he's a hard critic.  I ate it with the buns and a little mayo, my husband had his BBQ pork with rice.  Easy and delicious!  I followed the original recipe.

This was my first time making pulled pork.  It was super easy and turned out delicious HOWEVER after an hour I added to the broth portion with a can of tomato sauce, some brown sugar, mustard and bbq seasoning.  The broth just wasn't cutting it.  It came out awesome!

I make this AT LEAST once a month!!!  I took someone's suggestion and bought 4lbs pork roast and cook it for 10 hrs, other than that I keep to the regular recipe.  It is amazing!  Great for celebrations...when my family of three has it we always have tons of left overs which we usually share with friends.  It is easy, has a great taste, and is juicy.  A must make!

Made to serve at a party and got rave reviews!  Used 6lbs boneless ribs, 2 cans of beef broth and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce.  Followed others suggestions and added sliced onion to the bottom of the crockpot.  Seasoned ribs with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and chili powder.  Cooked on high for 7ish hours. Meat shredded easily.  Added BBQ sause and put in frig till next day.  Reheated in over.  DEElicious!

This was like real barbecue. Even my nephew who works in a BBQ restaurant went back for seconds!

I used a 2.5 lb boneless Boston Butt (pork shoulder). I would say that the 2.5 lb Boston Butt made about 5-6 sandwiches. 

I seasoned it with pepper and Lawry's seasoning salt, then browned all the sides in a pan. I put an onion, cut into big chunks, in the bottom of the crock pot and a can of low sodium beef broth, then put the meat on top. I let it run on LOW for 8 hours, and it was perfect. I just unplugged the crock pot when it was done and let it sit in there for 6 hours until I was ready to do the remaining steps. 

The pork looked good when it was pulled and had the barbecue sauce mixed in. It looked even better after it came out of the oven. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey Barbecue sauce (the whole bottle) and added some Cattleman's Memphis Sweet bbq sauce. 

This was a very easy meal for a party--make the pork, buy sandwich buns and potato salad, open up a can of beans, buy chips and veggies with dip, pickles, onions, and extra bbq sauce, and you're set.

Love this recipe.  I just use plain water and cook on high for 4-5 hours.  We eat this almost once a week.  I always use a boston butt or pork butt.  It is excellent.

We made this for Memorial Day and it was awesome. I put it in the slow cooker for 8 hours and it pulled apart so easily. I followed the other instructions as written. I also used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce. It is one of my top 3 favorite recipes!!!!

Very easy pulled pork recipe. I normally use my own bbq sauce but Bullseye Memphis style sauce was on sale for 99 cents when I was shopping. Came out quite good. 

Next time around I am going to use a pork butt and slow cook overnight. Then mix with a Carolina vinegar based bbq sauce I got from a buddy.

Instead of broth, i use root beer! its surprisingly reaaally good. makes it tender. And add barbeque sauce after draining. (usually baby rays). But this was also very good.

My family LOVES this!  I followed the recipe exactly as written except that I purchased a pork butt as many others suggested.  Meat fell off the bones after cooking in crock pot all day on low.  Used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and it was a hit.  Froze some for future use and that tasted great as well.  Already have a request to bring it for a party next weekend!

Thanks for a great recipe.  I agree with others that the particular cut of pork isn't so important.  I used a cheaper cut and it turned out great.  Also, the barbeque sauce I used was a bit on the sweet side.  To balance it out and add a little kick, I added about 1/4 cup hot sauce.  Delicious!!!

This pork was soooo good. We used a pork butt, added some beer while it was cooking and used sweet baby ray's bbq sauce. This pork is great to freeze and reheat. We just added a little extra sauce so it wouldn't get dried out while reheating.

I'm from North Carolina originally, and I thought this was an abomination of real barbeque. Two stars because my husband liked it. I will not make this again.

I have made this recipe several times and it's now one of my boyfriends favorites. The only thing I do different is add basic seasonings like salt, pepper and garlic and also add a half can or so of root beer. It sounds weird but it's awesome!. We use Sweet Baby Ray's for the BBQ sauce. SO GOOD!

I left the pork in the crock pot for just over 4 hours, but it didn't shred as easily as I was expecting it to. However, I put it in the oven for about 40 minutes and that made it all the difference. It was very tasty, even though I prefer BBQ Beef. My husband really enjoyed it and was able to have leftovers for his lunch for a few days.

This BBQ recipe with the Big Al's KC BBQ sauce listed on this site as the BBQ sauce needed for this and you have a top quality restaurant meal. I made this several times with store bought sauces and it was good. The sauce you use makes or breaks this recipe. Two of the store bought sauces I used weren't appealing to this recipe and one was good but with Big Al's it is PERFECT and a big hit in my house and at family gatherings. Thank you for the recipe.

All I can say is wow!  I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and bought a 4lb pork butt.  I cooked it on low in the slow cooker for 10 hoursand it shredded super easily.  I think baking it made a big difference.  Everyone couldn't stop raving about it!

Is this an innovative recipe? No.  Does it depend mainly on the type of BBQ sauce? Of course, there are only 3 ingredients!  Yet, it still deserves 5 stars. Why?  Because it is simple, cheap, and tasty!  Took past suggestions and cooked pork/broth in crock pot (low) for 7hr, added BBQ (Jack Daniel's Honey Smokehouse) and put in fridge for about 7hr, then added lit more BBQ than recipe called for (when I tasted it it was a bit light) & warmed up in crockpot for about 3hrs (2high, 1warm). Will mention that I am not sure if cooking it this way improved it from the stated directions but what I do know was it was very tasty.

This was a big hit with my family.  The butcher told me to use a pork roast and to add 2 teaspoons of rice vinegar to the crockpot (he said the sweet vinegar helps the meat absorb the seasoning).  We ate on this meal for two days and my kids were still asking for it several days later.  It was delicious and I will definately make it again.

This was so yummy, and so easy!  I did modify it slightly using beer instead of the beef broth.  I also added half an onion and some rosemary to the crockpot and let it cook all day.  I used my roasting pan in the oven with the top off and it worked great!  The whole family loved it!

Excellent!  I just used a 3 pound pork loin roast and it turned out wonderful.  Very tender and tasty.  It's also simple and pleases picky eaters!

I had a craving for a BBQ sandwich and this totally rocked.  Followed a review sugesstion and used 1/2 can of beer instead of the beef broth.  Slow Cooked for 4 hrs on high, pulled and mixed in bbq sauce and heated another 30 mins.  Yummy!

Very good!  Followed the cooking instructions exactly but threw in sliced red onion, garlic and a little seasoning salt in the crock pot. Husband loved it - will definitely make it again.

Excellent! I may have done it a little different but it worked. I put a sirloin pork roast in the crock pot with chicken stock and half an onion chopped up. When I got home I shredded the pork, put it in a roasting pan and drizzled the juices from the pan over it. I then mixed in this great BBQ sauce recipe (that I received from the ratings reviews) over it:    The recipe i used for the sauce is: 1/2 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 cup ketchup 1/4 cup chili sauce 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 tbsp chopped onions 1 tbsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp ground mustard 1 clove garlic, minced dash cayenne pepper Combine all sauce ingredients in a saucepan. Simmer, uncovered, for 1 hour or until slightly thickened, stirring occasionally. The only tweak I did to it was double the vinegar part.  I baked the shredded, BBQ sauce drenched meat for an hour to 'crisp the edges' and forced my guests to add coleslaw to the sammich and it was a hit!  Thanks!

My favorite new recipe. Could not be easier. I used 2 1/2 lbs of pork butt. The only thing I am not crazy about is the smell while it is cooking in the crock pot (stinky feet anyone?). Used Trader Joe's BBQ sauce. My whole family gobbled it all up. Thank you for sharing!

A hit, especially with the guys!  Very easy too.  The hardest part was selecting the meat from the butcher and pulling out the fat when separating the cooked meat.

Mouth Watering just thinking about this...I used a cheaper piece of meat as others suggested and I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce.  Can't get any easier, we ate this on PoBoy Bread.

Those of you that start with a roast - I think you're missing the point of this recipe - which I believe is ease in preparation.  It's perfect the way it is - don't change a thing!

It was really good!! I made a few changes to suit mine and my family's tastes. I added 1/4 cup of onions in with the beef broth. Then I added a dry rub of McCormick Slow Cooker Pulled Pork Seasoning with 4 Tablespoons of brown sugar mixed in. I added ribs with another can of beef broth ad poured the rest of the seasoning on top. Then I followed the rest of the recipe exactly. I agree with others that it does make a difference what BBQ sauce you use. Love the recipe!!

My hard to please son and 8 others enjoyed this.  Some went back for seconds without the bread.  I used an inexpensive 3.75 lb. pork butt, garlic and 1 cup of broth which was plenty.  I could probably just use 1/2 cup or even water.  For a mixed age group, I needed 6oz. of raw pork butt/person.  I used a great, Hawaiian-style sauce Kona Coast Tropical Sweet 'n Spicy.  Cook it on low for 8 hours at which time it will shred easily.  Drain most if not all of the liquid and save it as stock.  Add some sauce and oven cook it to dry it  for sandwiches so the bread doesn't get soggy.  Serve some sauce on the side for those who want extra!

I like a couple other reviewers don't understand the rave reviews.It was tender but it didn't taste like much of anything. It needed more seasoning. This recipe was not the bbq I was looking for.

I proclaim every Sunday "SCS" (Slow Cooker Sunday).  Tried this today, and my husband said this was his favorite recipe yet.  I used a pork butt and a good, quality BBQ sauce (make sure you have extra).  Served on fresh rolls and a side of cole slaw and chips.  YUM!!!

This was rated 5 stars by my husband.  Made first time following recipie.  Second time was even better using 1 cup of dark beer and 1 cup of beef broth.  I also used some of the drippings from the crock pot (about 1 1/2 cups) and mixed with about 1/2 cup of bbq sauce to bake it, this gave it just a hint of bbq flavor.  Then each person could top their own sandwich with amount of sauce they wanted.  Tasted just like the smokehouse bbq at a local resturant.

Wow. The easiest and the best recipe (for anything) I've found in a LONG time. I used some sort of cheap big cut of pork and a bottle of sauce and it was DELICIOUS. I dont put the shredded pork in the oven- just back in the crockpot. My husband asks for it all of the time!

Loved this!  I used leaner, very thick, loin chops and added some finely chopped onion. Slow cooked on low for only 4-1/2 hours. I served it on fresh French-bread rolls with Provolone, dill pickle slices, mustard and a side of creamy, red-skin potato salad, fresh pineapple and cottage cheese, and an apple crisp drizzled with icing for an outstanding lunch. Oh YUM!  Thank you, for an easy and delicious recipe, KMB233 and AR's cook Celeste, for being so helpful for sugggesting the perfect recipe, for what I was looking for. =)

This was the easiest pulled pork ever and very delicious.  My husband loved it. One change I made to make it very fast, was to cook it in my pressure cooker.  It cut the cooking time to 1 hour and 15 minutes.  I then pulled the pork and put it in the oven for 10 minutes with the BBQ sauce.  Perfection!

Just finished my last bit of leftovers and wish I had more.  I used a 5 lb pork butt and Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  Ate with the Sauteed Apples recipe and mac'n'cheese...SO YUMMY.  Can't wait to make it again!

Didn't think something this simple would taste this good!  Followed the recipe exactly except for using butt cut (sorry...juvenile but I couldn't resist!).  Used Sweet Baby Rays Hickory & Brown Sugar bbq sauce.  Might try a few drops of liquid smoke added to the beef broth the next time...but it was delicious just as is.  Thanks for sharing!

I'm already making this a 2nd time, so simple and so good!  I didn't have beef broth the first, so I used powderedbeef broth soup mixed with water.  I still forgot the beef broth, so tonight I'm using chicken stock.  Hope it turns out as well.  Oh, and I also got the Sweet Ray's sauce.  Yum!!

I made 4 lbs of pork butt in the crock pot for 10 hours, it came out a little too tender.  I served it on home made buns and it was delishious! I added some boars head horse radish sauce and that made it awsome!!! I highly reccomend horse radish on the side with this.

So tender & juicy! I can see we will be eating this weekly haha. I love it with the beef broth but I also sometimes make it for cheaper using apple juice in place of the beef broth & it is also amazing!

What an easy crowdpleaser. I used a shoulder roast. I cooked it on low for maybe five hours. I kept checking, wanting to avoid any mushiness. Its tempting to want to skip the oven step, but DONT DO IT!! Thats the part that sets this recipe apart, makes it unique,and taste real bbbq right off the grill. Incredible. I used Bullseye hickory sauce and loved it. We toasted the buns too.

This has become a weekly staple in my home-- with a few modifications. :) Used 1+ cups chicken stock and 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar instead of beef broth, dusted all with garlic powder and cumin before covering, cooking for 6-8 hours.  Used less than a cup of our favorite BBQ sauce (from Shane's Rib Shack!) after shredding, served on Texas toast.  A keeper!

The most delicious pulled pork ever!  I too recommend, as others have so helpfully, the pork butt cut (cheaper and so perfect) and to cook longer if you can.  I did 8 hours instead of 4, and it was so juicy and succulent!    Also, finding the right sauce is key.  Err on the sweet side.  You can always add honey to make it sweeter.  I like Cattleman's original with some added honey.  Yum!

Very good. I would follow users suggestions and after pulling the pork return it to the crock pot with the BBQ sauce.  It seamed like the oven dried the pork out...

Yummy! This is a good one. I followed the recipe exactly the first time, exept I was in a hurry and I skipped the oven part all together. I think it is pretty unnecessary. I took the meat out, mixed in the BBQ sauce, and put it right on a bun! I am making this again as we speak, and this time I added a little bit of cola to the beef broth before putting in the pork. We'll see...

This recipe was a big hit with family and friends! I used boneless country style pork ribs. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce because we enjoy the sweet tasting sauce. It was as good (if not better) as any restaurant's pulled pork. Planning to make this again and again!

Easy to make, doesn't heat up my kitchen in the hot summer, what more could I ask for?  The end result is only going to be as good as the bbq sauce you use, though!  We used Sweet Baby Rays, our favorite of the bottled varieties.  I look forward to trying this with some homemade sauces in the future.

So tasty and so easy!  I used a 5 pound pork shoulder and cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low the day before.  Shredded the meat and stuck it in the fridge.  The next day I mixed in the BBQ sauce and cooked in the oven.  The edges get crispy just as if the pork was cooked on the grill.

First time I used a slow cooker and it turned out great.  Cooked 2lbs ribs on low for 6 hours.  Ribs were more than done.  Forgot to get BBQ sauce at store - used double recipe of Debi K's BBQ sauce from this site.  My 9 year old said "Why haven't you made this before?"

Read all the reviews and helpful hints... combined what I thought were the best of the best... and voila... wonderful, tender pulled pork which easily tasted just like my favorite restaurant.  I didn't have a can of beef broth, so I used Lipton's  Beefy Onion Soup Mix and one cup of water.  I used a 2 pound pork shoulder roast which I sliced into 1" thick slabs. and cooked them on my crock pot's high setting.  After five hours it was very tender. All I had to do was shredd the meat and add barbecue sauce.  I used Sweet Baby Rays which is dee-licous.

This was great and so versatile!  I used a pork roast instead of pork ribs and I added a packet of dry onion soup mix & some garlic to the slow cooker.  It was super moist and I almost didn't want to add the BBQ sauce because it was so flavorful without it!  I'm glad I did though because it made for a tasty meal.  Will definitely make this again!

Why mess with a good thing.  This was so good.  Try it the way it is written first then tweek if you want to save time in a crockpot at the end.... If you tweeded first and not as good don't rate poorly because you didn't follow the recipe:)

Fantastic!  I used a pork roast and cooked about 10 hours in the slow cooker on low heat with the beef broth.  When I got home I simply took it out of the slow cooker, shredded, added BBQ sauce and put it in the oven for 30 minutes.  I do believe the last 30 minutes in the oven is what took it over the top. I received great reviews from all family members. This is even better tasting the next day if you are fortunate enough to have leftovers. It's a keeper for sure!

I didn't have beef broth, but had beer, so used it as CookingMama suggested; otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It's the only way I'll make BBQ pork sandwiches from now on! (Make sure you use a BBQ sauce you like- it could make it or break it for you)

I never tried to make pulle4d pork sandwiches. This recipe was EASY ! When it was finished I added some purchased Bar-B-Q sauce to the meat along with some of the juice.  Served with rolls & additional Bar-B-Q sauce and cole-slaw. Got rave reviews from our Thursday lunch crowd at work.

OMG this is soooooo good. Better than most restaurants. I have made it several times since. I buy the pork roast/shoulder/butt. Don't worry about buying the expensive leaner cut because the fast literally falls off the meat. You can use a spicy bar-b-que to add a little zest too. This is one of our regulars now!

I took the advice of others and we bought a really inexpensive roast. It was 3lbs and about $3.50 and it was a butt roast. Instead of putting it in the crockpot on high, I started it in the morning and put it on low for 8 hours. Usually when you do this the meat falls apart a LOT easier than if you were to cook it fast on high. We used Cattleman's BBQ and my husband RAVED about them. I really enjoyed these too. So simple! We only put them in the oven for 10 minutes instead of 30 for fear it would dry out the roast.

You will love this recipe!  I throw my ribs on the grill for about 5 minutes per side for a smoky flavor and then throw in the crockpot.  I also use the beer instead of beef broth while cooking.  You might want to brush/spray a little olive oil on the ribs before throwing on the grill b/c they are fairly dry.  I do once a month cooking, and I have incorporated this recipe into my freezer cooking.  I freeze the meat/sauce mixture and reheat portions later!  Yum!

I know a 1 star rating is not the typical reaction to this recipe, however, I did not like it. My boyfriend LOVED this meal and if he was rating this recipe, he would give it 5 stars. We doubled the recipe, so we used 6 lbs. of boneless western style pork ribs , 2 cans of beef broth, and a mixture of 3 different bbq sauces (Sweet Baby Ray: Honey, Open Pit: Original, and Kraft: Thick N' Spicy). We took the meat out of the slow cooker after 4 hours, shredded it, added the mixture of bbq sauces, and put it in the oven for 30 minutes. I think the problem is I am not a huge fan of things cooked with beef broth. It makes food tastes funny to me. The meat was also fatty, which was not appealing. I could only eat half of the sandwich. I won't be making this again.

I also used Cattleman's BBQ and it was great.  I also placed it in the slow cooker and left it for 10 hours (overnight).  I did the cooking it in the oven step, but I don't know how much difference that step makes.  I used 1 1/2 bottles of the bbq sauce to make it more moist.  Yum.

This is a first rate recipe, simple prep and ohhhh, so good!  I bought a boston butt roast 4+ lbs) and cooked it exactly as indicated. I used the Big Al's KC BBQ sauce from this site, scaled it to 12 servings.  Can't wait to have friends in for this one!

I used a pork shoulder roast, and seared it on the stove before adding it to the crock pot. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Original BBQ Sauce, which was perfect. I skipped the oven step and just cooked it on high for 5 hours, shredded it, then cooked it on low another 3 hours...I'm not usually a pork person, but this was great! This will be my go-to recipe whenever pork roasts are on sale, thanks!

This recipe rocks!!  Buy your meat on sale and this is a cheap meal.  I had a couple of beef roasts in the freezer and so I used them.  It turned out great, I froze the leftovers and the next week I made bbq pizza.

I too use less expensive cuts of pork.  Pretty much the 'likableness' of the recipe is dependent on your choice of BBQ sauce - so choose carefully!!

**MUST PUT IN OVEN** It soaks up the excess BBQ sauce so your meat isn't goopy..... so good! I used a pork tenderloin (2lbs) bc it is what I had. I used a blend of BBQ sauces so I could throw out all the misc. bottles I had in the fridge. Came out just like at a resturant.

This is EXCELLENT! I make this all the time. I use the shoulder, cook it overnight on low for 10 hours. The meat is so tender it just falls apart! I throw it back in the crock pot with Famous Daves BBQ sauce. Serve with "Restaurant-Style Coleslaw I" and cornbread. YUM!

This was great!  As someone who is not a big fan of BBQ I specifically made this to feed to my family and not myself.   After tasting it I became a fan!   My husband said it is better than well known restaurants in our city.

The BEST BBQ pork sandwich I have ever had.  After reading the reviews I made the following adjustments; covered the bottom of the crock pot with onion. Then, added 1 can of beer.  Cooked the Pork Roast (3 3/4 lbs.) on low for 8 1/2 hours.  Covered with Cattleman's BBQ sauce and baked @ 350 degrees for 20 minutes.  Baking in the oven is the trick to this recipe.....Again, the BEST BBQ sandwich my family and I have EVER had.  Thanks!

What a great tasting and easy recipe. Never used a pork butt roast before and it was well worth the difference in the price. (pork butt @ 2.89 per pound or boneless pork ribs @ 5.49 per pound). Thank you for the recipe KMB233.  iota

I made this on Saturday night.  First, I rubbed a 4 lb pork butt with mccormick grill mates pork rub.  Then, I added the rubbed pork butt, 1/2 diced vidalia onion, 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar and 1/4 cup of beef broth to a crockpot.  I let this all cook on low for 8.5 hours.  Then, I took out the pork butt and onion and discarded the liquid.  I pulled the meat from the bone and put the pulled pork and onion back in the crockpot with a bottle of Sticky Fingers Memphis BBQ sauce and a teaspoon of liquid smoke and let this all cook on low for 1 hour.  The liquid smoke really made a difference.  Then we made sandwiches with potato rolls.  It was excellent.

I made this a few weeks ago for a group of friends.  It was AWSOME!!  There wasn't any left (I think my husband was dissapointed that there wasn't leftovers).  After reading the reviews I used the shoulder-butt and Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  Everyone loved it!  SO EASY!!!

This is very easy and very good!  Pulling the pork was my favorite part.  I used Bullseye BBQ, but next time I'll try a sauce from scratch.  I will definitely be making this again.  Update: Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce bumped my rating up from a 4 to a 5!

Oh YUM! I LOVE slow-cooker meals! I made this last night! I used Reynolds oven bags and lined my crockpot to make clean up a breeze and I followed the recipe except I liberally seasoned the pork shoulder with salt, pepper, and about 2TBSP minced garlic.  I also doused it with about 1/2C Worcestershire sauce. You could probably use pork broth-they sell the pork bullion cubes in the ethnic or Hispanic isle at the grocery store. I chopped half an onion and into 4 quarters and added it to the pot.  I cooked it on high for 1hr and then put it on low to cook overnight. I woke up this morning to a great smelling house and the meat was so tender it fell off the bone.  I drained the liquid, pulled the pork off the bone and added it back to the crockpot with the BBQ sauce turning it to coat. Left it in the crockpot on low until I was finished getting dressed for work and made quite a lunch for my husband and me.  I also made coleslaw the night before to top the sandwiches with and had hamburger pickles and fresh sliced onion on the side and regular Lays potato chips DELICIOUS!!!

I made this back in May I believe and I forgot to review it!  I love love love Pork BBQ and this really hit the spot.  I cooked the pork in the slow cooker in the broth for about 8 hours, then drained almost all of it except for a little bit to keep some of the flavor, dumped in the bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's towards the end and it was great by the time my fiance got home from work!  We got great Kaiser rolls from the deli and toasted them under the broiler too which added a little bit of a crunch.  Really good!

Excellent!  This was so easy.. I skipped the last part in the oven, and just dumped the BBQ sauce in the crockpot (after draining out broth) and put it on warm for 30 minutes.  I used pork shoulder (removed bones and fat) and Bull's Eye Chipotle Sauce and it was great!  Served with grilled onions and shredded cheddar cheese.  Will make again!

This turned out beautifully!  There are only two of us, so I used 1.5lbs of pork loin and some Famous Daves barbeque sauce to finish it off.  We served it on whole wheat buns with mac and cheese - great, simple supper!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

By far and away the BEST BBQ pork sandwiches ever!  My husband has been a cook (and now manager) of a BBQ resturant here in Texas and this blows their recipe out of the water.  Sweet Baby Ray's is the best BBQ to use with this recipe too.

This was simple and good. I actually cooked it in the oven at 300 degrees F. for 3 hours, in a covered braising pot. I cooked it in beef base and beer, I also put half in BBQ sauce and the other half in au jus. Delish!

This was great!  Used pork shoulder and sweet baby rays BBQ sauce.  Like everyone says, even those who don't like pork, like it like this!  Only problem is cleaning my crock pot afterwards!

Excellent! I used a cheaper cut of meat - pork roast - and it turned out perfect. I served it on toasted, buttered buns. Yum!

This tastes awesome! I'll tell you my secret. This may sound weird, but... I put my pork butt in the crockpot, cover with water and about a cup of strong coffee. YES, I said coffee! I let it cook overnight and then in the morning I remove the pork, shred it, add a bottle of good quality BBQ sauce (don't use a cheap brand) and place on homemade buns (squash rolls from allrecipes is awesome). 

I love this recipe! It's very filling, and for my husband and myself... we don't eat much pork... so this is a treat!

This is such a simple recipe with only 3 ingredients.  We got the crock pot started late so I cooked it on High for 2 hours, and low for 2 hours and it turned out fine.  The hardest part is shredding the pork.  After we put it in the oven it came out a little crispy on the outside and moist underneath.  Yum!  We used Kraft BBQ sauce, not the highest quality sauce but still turned out super tasty.

This is a great easy recipe.  I used 2 pork roasts and enough beef broth to just about cover them. Cooked on low for 8 hours. After I shredded the pork I added Jack Daniel's Honey Smokehouse BBQ sauce, a little extra honey, and some of the juices from the crock pot to the casserole dish before placing in the oven. Came out as good as what we get in a restaurant. Serve on a buttered and toasted roll, can't be beat. This will be a well used recipe especially in the summer for picnics and parties!

I butter the buns and throw them on the griddle to toast them.  Great with Big Al's K.C Bar-B-Q Sauce (half recipe) from this site.

So easy, so moist, so delicious!  I tried two different meats to see how they would turn out, and they were both awesome.  One had quite a bit of fat on it, but the meat just fell apart when it was done so I was able to easily tease the fatty parts off.  I'm definitely making this again and again and again . . .

So easy! I used pork butt, broth, and a little liquid smoke.  I like my BBQ pork sandwiches dry, with mayo, pickles, and COLESLAW only...so we skipped the BBQ sauce altogether.

Thanks!

ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!  I put some liquid smoke in with the beef broth while the pork is in the crock pot, shred, mix the bbq sauce with some liquid smoke in the crock pot, put the shredded meat back in and let it heat through.  (Don't overmix the shredded pork or else you'll end up with something resembling wallpaper paste - still good but the texture leaves something to be desired needless to say :) ) This also works well with chicken. I like serving with the Awesome and Easy Creamy Corn Casserole also on this site.  YUM!

As others have said, I use a 3-4 lb pork roast as it is a cheaper cut of meat that gives you fabulous results.  I put the pork in my slow cooker, toss in some chopped onions, beef broth and a large bottle of bbq sauce (Ken Davis Sweet and Zesty is my favorite) a splash of liquid smoke and cook on low for 10-12 hours.  Remove the pork and shred with 2 forks.  I scoop out as much of the fat that has cooked out of the pork and toss it out.  Yes, you do lose a fair amount of sauce, but after putting the shredded pork back into the crockpot I add a smaller bottle of bbq sauce (I add Ken Davis Bold and Zesty) and heat through.  The pork ends up being a little sweet with a  bbq flavor that appeals to almost everyone.  It so easy to make the night before and then add the 2nd bottle of bbq sauce the next day when reheating.

Loved this! I used a 5lb pork shoulder roast and used 4 cups of beef broth with a bay leaf a few cloves of garlic and half an onion and whole peppercorns and put in the slow cooker for 5 hours on high. The meat literally fell of the bone and shredding it was no problem. My DH rated it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. This was so easy. I served it with baked beans, cole slaw, and fries. I will use this recipe for company too!

We made this last night for the first time and everyone agreed that it was awesome!

Did a few things a little different for convenience..  we used pork butt steaks with the bone in (it came out very easily once the meat was cooked).  We also cooked the meat in both the broth AND barbecue sauce.

Came out very tasty!

I put the meat on the bottom portion of a kaiser roll, topped it with shredded cheddar cheese, and placed that and the buttered top (sprinkled with a little garlic powder) under the broiler in a toaster oven for a few minutes.  Excellent recipe, thanks for sharing it, I will be making it for many years to come!

I have lived in Memphis and Texas, both famous for bbq. This recipe rates amoung the best and the easiest. When I first took the ribs out of the crock pot, they did not seem all that tender, but then I pulled them apart with a fork - and Wow! They were easy to tear apart and just the right amount of tenderness! The first time I made this I used an original Kraft bbq sauce and it was to DIE for! The second time I used another more expensive brand, and it was not near as good. I say KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid!). This is such a quick, easy recipe. Very few steps, cooks on its own, and the taste is out of this world! I made it for my in-laws and VERY picky husband. They loved it! My father-in-law is from the Memphis area and bbqs all the time. He was even impressed and wanted the recipe. Thanks for sharing!!!!!!!

Great and very easy recipe.  I used the crock pot only.  You don't really need to transfer to the oven, just drain most of the broth and add bbq sauce to crock pot.  I took the advice from someone else and quartered my pork loin before cooking, which helped make shreding easier.  I will always use this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I had a lot left over from a recipe I made yesterday (Kalua Pig in the Slow Cooker) so I was looking for a way to change it a bit so that it didn't seem like we were just having left overs.  This was a great way to do it!  Every one really enjoyed it.  We had it with Honey Wheat Sandwich Rolls from this site.

I cook for a bunch of men.  'Manly' men.  So, naturally, I put a bottle of beer (usually a lager) in with the roast instead of broth before the bbq sauce and just cooked longer to reduce to good thickness.  Also, I always use a cheaper cut, like other reviewers.  Turns out perfect every time!!  This is great on it's own or as a starter recipe.  Thank you for the post.

Delicious! The only thing I did differently was cook the meat for 8 hours on low rather than 4 hours on high. Shredding the meat was effortless- the meat was already falling apart.

When I was attempting this recipe for the first time, my husband moaned and groaned a bit. He doesn't like pork, but said he would try it. I put   pork from Costco in the crock pot before leaving for work and came home to such a wonderful aroma. My husband even raved when he came home.  I pulled the meat out of the crock pot and pulled it apart, then put it back in the crock pot with a bottle of Annie's Naturals Smokey Maple BBQ Sauce. My doubting husband and I both loved the flavor. He loved it so much that he's requested it several times and it has now become one of our staple recipes. It's such a bonus that it's probably the easiest recipe I've ever made.

I recommend Kraft Brown Sugar BBQ sauce. I have tried some pretty expensive, fancy brands and Kraft Brown sugar is simply the best in this recipe in my opinion.

Recipe was excellent.  Did make a few changes...added chopped apples and onions and fresh parsley while cooking and left it in the mixture, then added the bbq sauce all in the crock pot.  Didn't put in oven.  Also used organic chicken broth didn't have any beef on hand.  Meal was fantastic! I plan on serving it on mini bread squares at my next party! Thanks!

I cooked the ribs for ~8hrs at low, and shreded and baked in a 13*9 pan at 315 deg F for ~40min. While making mashed potatos. And frozed the dripping to remove fat, then used the remaining dripping to make gravy! Fantastic while being so easy!

This is the best and easiest recipe ever, i used a pork roast instead of the ribs and I used a little liquid smoke in it. I also didn't have any beef broth on hand so I used a packet of au ju gravy mix, it was so good i didn't want to share. I will be making this religously!!

Excellent! I used a pork shoulder and put onions on the bottom then crocked on high for 4-5 hours, shredded it, and poured in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  I then heated it through in the crock pot for another hour.

YUM!! Don't skip the oven step.  I seasoned my ribs with season salt & pepper before they went in the crockpot. I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ Sauce and added a few shakes of Tabasco to it for a little kick.

Used chicken broth instead of beef, sprinkled salt, pepper & garlic powder over ribs and cooked on low all day (about 10 hours).  Fantastic!!!  Will make again!

This was very good!  We don't eat beef, so I used chicken broth and per other reviewers' suggestion, I used the Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce.  We ate it with Kaiser rolls, and it truly was delicious, aside from the fact that I started it in the morning and it was done in the evening.  Couldn't be easier!!

This recipe was outstanding! I slow cooked it on low for about 10 hours and hardly needed to use the forks to shred it! I also used a dry rub on a pork roast before cooking it and then used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ sauce at the end and it rocked!

This is too easy to mess up. And it tastes great. Will use again. Update: Just made this again with a pork butt. Yes, its a cheaper meat. But, there is a whole lot of fat on it and not to mention I feel like my fingers are still wrapped around the fork from shreading..lol..So, alot more work as well. I think I will definitely will keep using the loin as it is leaner. Just thought I would throw that out there.:)

Very good!  And I don't really even like barbeque.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's original BBQ sauce with a dash of the honey kind.  Recommend getting two bottles of whatever you decide to use so you can put some on the buns too.  I didn't put in the oven, but as per some reviews, I drained, shredded and put back in the slow cooker with the barbeque sauce.  I was a little worried about it burning the sauce, but it was fine and heated up fairly fast. Toasted kaiser buns, with sliced pickles...mmmmmmm.

Loved it!  Didn't change a thing, except cooked it on low for about 10 hours.  I lived in Memphis and consider myself a BBQ pork snob, and I thought this recipe was perfect.  SO EASY AND YUMMY!

I give this 5 stars but it really does depend on the BBQ sauce you use. Kraft seems to be the worst. I used "Big Bubba's Bad BBQ Sauce" (from a local place) and used about 4 lbs of pork shoulder (and 2 cans of broth because I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be covered) and I got 17 servings for well under $10. It was so delicious that my cat went to great lengths to lick the plate clean, and now won't leave us alone anytime he smells it. And best of all, the man of the house approves tremendously.

This recipe worked out well.  I changed the cut of meat to a pork butt roast since they were on sale.  Very juicy and very good.

BBQ doesn't get any better than this.  Baking the pork for 30 minutes in the oven is a must!  It took me about 15 minutes to shred the pork and get rid of the fat, but so worth the effort of getting it into the oven.  Will use this recipe again and again.

I used a boneless pork roast and cooked it all day in the crockpot with the broth.  It shredded up great.  Just added bbq sauce and made sandwiches.  Thanks.

First experience using my mom's red/orange 80's era crock pot.  This recipe is as easy anything I've ever made.  I used sweet baby ray's original and used pork with bones, which came right off when I pulled the pork!

This was the easiest most delish meal.  I put my pork in frozen and turned it on high for about 2 hrs then turned it down to low for the rest of the time. The pork was very moist and very easy to shred.  I took some to a friend who is recovering from surgery and she loved it to.  I added some season salt and garlic other than that I stuck to the recipe. It was fantastic. Thanks for sharing this great one.

This recipe was so easy and tasted terrific!  Usually, I make my pork sandwiches in the oven with a dry rub, but it takes forever!  I just put my ribs into the slow cooker for the whole day, and when we were ready to eat it was perfect!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's honey bbq, and it was awesome!

I loved this recipe.  I gave it a 5 for being so easy to make.  I like that you can change the flavor by simply changing your bbq sauce.  Sweet one day and savory the next.  Thanks for an easy and good bbq recipe

Everyone loved this recipe! Simple to prepare. I used boneless country style ribs. Next time, I will just do a pork loin or pork butt. Used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce.

This is a fantastic recipe that works for beef too!  I use a jerk rub on my pork/beef roast and then follow the recipe.  I put it right back in the crockpot after shredding & add BBQ sauce.
Tastes great & very easy.

Delicious! I used pork shoulder instead of the rib but this was so very easy to make and tasted great!  It's best fresh out of the oven when the top layer of pork has a slight crunch.

Great simple recipe. Cooked pork roast (shoulder was on sale I believe) overnight in the crockpot, then just threw the crock in the fridge for the day. When I got home, I shredded and baked for that perfect finish. Loved it.

Subbed a 4 lb pork butt and used Zippy Barbecue Sauce from this site.  Also used Nana's Southern Coleslaw to complete the sandwiches.  Everyone raved over how good these sandwiches were.

When I first opened the slow cooker to shred the pork, I was like "oh great another recipe wasted." But like the directions say, it will seem like it's not working but it does. I just pulled it apart by hand. Next time, I will trim the meat also, but that's a reflection on my abilities, not the recipe. Very easy to put together and can reflect different flavors based on what kind of BBQ sauce the cook likes.

I made this in the oven because I didnt have time to use the crock pot.. :/
It took half the time @ 325*...It was still delicious.. I added half a chopped onion..

I also made a coleslaw for on top and served it on sesame seed buns with a side of homemade garlic fries ...A delicious meal!!

Good recipe.  I used Boston Pork Butt instead of pork ribs.  Meat was tender and delicious.  I am not a big meat lover probably one of the reasons I didn't give it five stars.  Well another reason, need to find the right barbecue sauce to give it that special kick.  I used Kraft Honey Barbecue.....it was good but still not 100% satisfied.  I will keep looking for that special sauce.

I used boneless country ribs and the meat shredded beautifully and was tender after exactly 4 hours in the crockpot. We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, but still looking for the perfect bottled bbq sauce. Will serve again, but for a family of 3, will make only 1/2 next time.

This was a hit!  I've now made it for two different gatherings and it's been very well-received.  I use whatever cheapest cut of pork is on sale because I cook it in the crockpot overnight on low, which makes it literally fall apart.

This BBQ is sooo delicious! I too bought a Boston butt, which is much cheaper and goes a long way.  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. I buy small reusable containers that are just the right size for a meal for my husband and myself.  It makes a lot, so I have several perfect meals to pull out in a moments notice.  Pop it in the microwave, and it is as good as it was right out of the crockpot.  It is the best weeknight dinner ever.  My in-laws are my neighbors, so they expect to receive a good portion as well. This recipe deserves a 5 star rating for sure.

I've been making pulled pork in the crock pot forever.  Toss it in with a bottle of bbq sauce.  Serve it on a bun at the end of the day.  This didn't taste much different, but involved an extra step (and dirty pot).  It was good - but more work.  And I would definitely add an onion and a bell pepper to the crock pot (gives it so much more depth of flavor).

At the suggestion of another reviewer I used pork butt instead.  I slow cooked it for 8 hours and it shredded so easy. I added the bbq sauce and marinated it over night then 4 hours before dinner I put it back in the slow cooker. 

 I will say it was really mushy though. It tastes amazing but the texture is off. I have no problem with texture (I'd never be able to eat sushi if I did) but if that is something that is important to you, I suggest following the recipe and bake it in the oven. I may do that next time around instead of slow cooking it for so long.

Skipped the oven part, but added in some liquid smoke, tomato paste and some spice halfway through  and it was awesome! Also, added in some lime juice (any acid) to help break down the meat while it cooked in the beef broth. Serve in a hawaiian role with bbq sauce and slaw - the best!

Fantastic. I used about 7 lbs of the boneless pork ribs, put on low in the slow cooker for 10 hours and it shredded super easily. Put it in the fridge over night and then addedd Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, popped it in the oven at 350 degrees for 30 minutes the next morning and transferred it back in the slow cooker on low for ~ 2 hours. BIG hit at a football party, very moist and good flavor. Made a great sandwich with a dash of horseradish.

Sooo easy and sooo good!! I used a boston butt cut and put it in the crock pot in the morning with chicken stock (all I had), salt and pepper. Left it on low all day, then shredded it, added a bottle of sauce, put it in a 9x13 dish in the over for 30 minutes....was so tasty!

I used pork loin roast because that was all that the store had; 4.8 lbs. Lined the bottom of the crockpot with sliced yellow onion, rubbed the outside of the roast with black pepper and Stubbs BBQ Rub. Placed the roast on the onion and poured two cans of beer around the edges. Cooked on low for 7.5 hours. 

Took it out, shredded it with two forks; it just fell apart. I put in in a large freezer container and added two bottles of Stubb's Spicy BBQ Sauce, covered and put in the fridge for lunch later. 

My husband wouldn't stop picking at it while I was preparing it! He loves it! I will bake up portions as we need them as there are only two of us. Turned out AMAZING!

I didn't use my good ribs for this, instead I picked up the cheapest cut of pork I could find.  After being in the slow cooker, it's so tender, so you don't need to buy the expensive meat.  For the sauce I did a mix of Kraft chicken and rib and Diana great western smokehouse.  Everyone at dinner asked for the recipe, this is a winner for sure!

This recipe was so simple and the pork turned out really well.  I made a pork sandwich for my son who is a chef and he loved it.  His wife loved it too and she is a real picky eater.

This was excellent! Best thing about this recipe: VERY EASY AND QUICK! I actually found a couple of 2 lb. boneless pork roasts at Target for $3.50 each since it was close to the Use By date! Threw them in with some beef stock and cooked on low for 5-6 hours, and it fell apart all on its own. Easy to pull into pieces. My seasoning was a personal preference- some pre-made sauce that had a smoked flavor to it, plus a little ketchup, a tiny bit of salt and pepper, and some garlic powder. It was ready instantly, and just fine for us without further cooking or marinating. My girlfriend loved it!

Perfect, perfect, perfect! The meat just falls apart, and it's so tasty when it's all finished. The nice thing about this recipe is you can make it your own by adding whatever type of bbq sauce you'd like. I'm from the south and love to use Rudy's bbq sauce with this!

This turned out delicious! I used a 4-pack from Costco so I'm not sure how many pounds it was but it almost filled my 5-quart crock pot. I also added 1 cup of Apricot Preserves to the broth before I poured it over the pork. We have been eating this all week and have yet to run out of ideas for new ways to serve it!! Def went into my recipe box!

I used country style pork ribs.. wasnt sure what to buy, but it turned out AWESOME!!  I used about 3 1/2 lbs of meat, cooked in the crockpot on high for about 4 1/2 hrs. If I knew pulled pork was so easy, I would have made it years ago! Fed this to the fam for Fathers Day, everyone was happy.

AWESOME! Loved it! We used a boneless pork but. Only slow cooked it on low for about 4-5 ish hours and it was done. I guess it depends on your slow cooker. SOOOOOOOOO easy! We used leftovers for tacos and wraps.

I made this pork and it was delicious. I did listen to some of the reviewers though and bought a pork shoulder because I couldn't find boneless ribs. This made the recipe take about 8 hrs in the crockpot total, so it would work out perfectly to make when busy. The boys loved it!

Easiest meal for large groups. I used beer instead of beef broth and pork butt instead of boneless pork ribs (cheaper and more flavorful!!). I put the pork butt and beer in the slow cooker over night on low setting. The next morning, I drained all the liquid from the slow cooker, pulled the pork apart (which if fell apart on its own), and put back in the slow cooker with the bbq sauce on warm for the rest of the afternoon, stirring occasionally throughout the day until the guests arrived. Everyone raved about it!!!

This was my first attempt to make bbq pulled pork sandwiches i used boneless pork shoulder ribs, they came in big strips AMAZING. I cooked them in my crockpot for 4 hours meat came apart so easily so tender and I used STUBBS bbq mesquite sauce my family loved it.

This is the best recipe for pulled pork!  It was so tender and delicious.  I received many compliments and was told it was better than what you would get at a restauarant or fair.  I used Dinosaur BBQ sauce and it was excellent.

AWESOME!  I use pork shoulder aka pork butt when I make this also.  Before placing the meat in the roaster, I add the broth, chopped onion & minced garlic.  I season the pork with Sweet Mesquite Seasoning (Costco) and Liquid Smoke.  I don't add the BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Rays original) until after I shred it.  I cook this for about 12-16 hours, drain the excess liquid because the fat cooks off.

It was excellent but I did use a rub on the meat a day before for extra flavor. The rest of the recipe was followed exactly with 10 hrs of crock pot time. Will definitely be doing this again.

This meal has everything to do with the bbq sauce you use.  Don't just use a run-of-the mill brand.  I trippled the recipe and used two different types.  The sauce makes a HUGE difference.  One pan was great, the other so-so.

5 Stars all the way!! Followed the recipe exactly, used a local favorite bbq sauce and was not disappointed! The meat was tender and falling apart after being in the slow cooker on high for four hours. We will be making this again and again. Thanks so much!

I tried this for the first time today...so easy. Pulled apart the pork ribs and poured the sauce over it. Then, because no one else was home to eat it, had to cover it and walk away. It was so good that I was afraid there wouldn't be any left for dinner if I didn't stop picking & eating. Delicious and easy, doesn't get any better than that! I bought coleslaw to put on top. Had a pulled pork sandwich that way once and thought it added a crunchy bit of extra flavor. Yum. 7/22/11 Have to update this. Both my son and husband said this is the BEST BBQ pulled pork ever. When you realize how easy it is, it makes it even more outstanding. Thank you again.

This is so good! I used pork loin (it was on sale) and threw it in the slow cooker for about 8 hours. Make sure you use a bbq sauce you love - I made my own using Big Al's KC BBQ sauce from this site, it's the best.

Very good. Will make again. I cooked it in the crockpot for 10 hours. Then I drained the broth and added jack daniels bbq sauce. Let it set over night in fridge and cooked it for 4 hours on low. Yum.

Okay, my husband thought this roast pork was awesome. I will even add a bit more sauce the next time around. I get the feeling this will be something we make all summer long.

Used pork butt. (Cheaper cut). Slow cooker whole way, sort time in the oven with bottled bbq sauce. Good, simple, boys ate it up but I was less impressed. It was a bit dry all said and done.

I used half the amount of beef broth and substituted a little over half a bottle of beer. I also added several spices and herbs while the meat cooked, including onion, garlic, rosemary and bay leaves. Very good, served on whole grain rolls, with mac-n-cheese. Next time i will definitely bake it for longer in the oven, or in a more shallow dish.

Very good!  I cooked a pork butt in chicken broth because that's what I had.  Other than that, I followed the directions.  Will definitely make again.  Update: I recently tried this with a beef rump roast (added saute'd onions before baking), and it was also very good.  I agree with SKANDREWS that baking in the oven per the directions is better than finishing in the crockpot.

This is a simple and easy way to make BBQ Pork.  On the advice of others on this site, I used Sweet Baby Rays Original BBQ sauce. If you are like my husband and prefer sweeter-tasting BBQ, you probably will love this.  However, since I like  more of a "smokey" flavor, I think next time I will try Bull's Eye BBQ sauce but either way, this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks!

Without a doubt the easiest thing you can make in a slowcooker. I used pork butt to save money and it was fantastic. This is in the rotation at my house.

This was my first time making barbecue, and I have no reason to ever try any other recipe.  This was delicious...everyone loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did put a chopped onion in the bottom of the slow cooker before I put the pork in.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion to heat the cast iron skillet in the oven as it was preheating.  The barbecue really sizzled when I added it to the skillet.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Barbecue Sauce.  Thanks for a recipe that is as easy as it is delicious!

I just made this 2 days ago and I was amazed by how delicious and how easy it really is. I've always wanted to learn how to make pulled pork bbq sandwiches and I am grateful for this recipe. I used a little more than 3lb of country style ribs (they are the ribs cut with most meat). After rinsing and drying the meat, I sprayed my slow cooker and placed the ribs, fitting them tightly. I added on can (it;'s actually 14 oz) of beef stock - next time I'll make my own stock, it's worth it.  After reading the reviews I decied to cook the ribs on low for about 8 hours. In the morning the meat was falling off the bones, I pulled them with two forks and then added less than a bottle of Sweet Ray's BBQ sauce, original recipe. I putted in the refrigerator and ate at night, warming it up on the microwave -- sorry I was hungry and in a hurry! Can't wait for the Spring/summer BBQs so I can do this for a crowd!

This dish is fantastic and SO EASY. I bought a 4 lb Boston Butt Pork Roast, threw it in with half a chopped up onion on the roast and the beef brother. Cook for 5 hours only b/c we weren't home sooner and threw it in the overn for 30 minutes. Just follow the directions from the start and you'll have fantastic  BBQ Pork! Can't say how easy this was, great for moms!

Perfect!  I used 3.5 lbs of pork butt which is a much cheaper cut of meat, and it still turned out fantastic.  Put in slow cooker with the beef broth for 5 hours on hi and 3 hours on low.  Then pulled out the meat and shredded it  - but it was so tender it literally shredded itself.  I also separated out all the fat.  Then into the dutch oven with Ray's BBQ sauce for 1 hour.  Served on toasted buns with coleslaw and baked beans.  Oh and don't forget the Eastern Carolina vinegar sauce on top!  This is very simple and easy to follow for a beginner - and the results are almost guaranteed!  Made enough for 2 full dinners for 4 people.

I put it on high for 8 hours instead. It could use a bit more sauce and the beef broth was slightly over spiced, but all in all a good recipe.

2/10 amy, ruth lunch..the smallest boneless roast in store was 5.5 lbs.  it stuck out the top a little. i cooked on low for 16 hours (only because it was overnight, it wasn't done by the time i went to bed and i read that refrig it and then recook not so good so i left it on low all night.  made this bbq sauce recipe: 1/2 cup cider vinegar 1/2 cup packed brown sugar 1/2 cup ketchup 1/4 cup chili sauce 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce 2 tbsp chopped onions 1 tbsp lemon juice 1/2 tsp ground mustard 1 clove garlic, minced dash cayenne pepper Combine all sauce ingredients in a saucepan. shred pork, and then put back in crock pot withe the sauce on low for a few more hours (1 would have been fine).  this was't enough sauce i had to add a bottle of jack daniels bbq sauce.  it was very tasty!!lots of leftovers. good with coleslaw.

"this stuff is amazing" my boyfriend said.  That's amazing coming from him because he's what I call a food snob; very picky.  The whole family enjoyed this a lot and I was thrilled at how easy it is to make and cleanup.  This is awesome for informal gatherings, too.  I made it for my son's birthday party and served it with store bought potato salad.  It was the least stressful gathering I've ever done.  Thanks!

This is a fantastic recipe. I have made this several times and my husband says it is better than any BBQ restaurant he has eaten at. I make it as written and use Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. The sandwiches are tender and taste great!!

I give this dish 4 stars because it is sooo easy and satisfying. I cooked on low for about 10 hours as suggested by other reviewers, and it just fell apart deliciously. I made it for a couple of friends coming over for dinner and they loved it.

Hard to rate when you modify someone's recipe. I gave this a four due to not following it to a T.  Something was missing and I can't imagine how it would have taste,  if I didn't alter it.  I placed sliced onions in bottom of crockpot, and seasoned meat with garlic powder, ground blk pepper, and a tad of sea salt.  Used our Sweet Baby Ray's (never fails us) however something was missing.  We don't like original coleslaw.  So we substituted shredded coleslaw (cabbage only) for a bit of crunch.  Was good and will make again.  Gonna put my palet to work on this one.  Could it be because I didn't have a dutch oven or cast iron skillet.  Don't think so.....thanks for the recipe it was good just not a five star.

Mmmm...everyone loves this recipe and it is so easy.    I actually smoked pork tenderloin (I like a lean cut) overnight on my gas grill at 200 degrees using hickory chips on the hot side and meat on the cold side and put it in the crock pot, then oven to finish it up the next day.  This is so easy to do on a gas grill...I put it on in the evening and just made sure the temp stayed around 200 and took it off in the morning.  I have made it without smoking it first and it is delicious either way.  However, my mom swears it is so much better when I smoke the meat first.

This was the best pulled pork I have ever made! I used a Boston butt roast, 4.5 lb.My family loved it. I cooked it for 8 hrs. in crook pot with onion slices in bottom of pot, removed to pull the pork, placed in my cast iron skillet, mixed in Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and cooked in over for 30 min more.  The  Iron fry pan and oven roasting did the trick...don't leave out this step!

This was delicious & easy! I used 3 lbs of boneless loin of pork ribs. I did not have a can of beef broth so I put some water in the bottom of the crockpot under the pork. I cooked it on low for 5 hours, took the pork out, shredded it, added a little salt & pepper & put it back in the crockpot. I poured honey bbq sauce over it & cooked it on low for another hour. PERFECT!

I slow cooked the pork on the stove top for 2 1/2 hrs. Shred then drain is needed. I add an up to 1 extra bottle of BBQ sauce and continue cooking the meat for 30 mins.

I had this for a bookclub meeting and everyone loved it.  I put it in the morning and let is cook until all of the beef brth was absorbed or evaporated before I put in the BBQ sauce.  We ate it a 7:00pm so it cokked for over 10 hours with the BBQ for about 3 hours in the crockpot instead of putting in the oven.  If you have the time it is worth the wait!

I used a pork loin, which was low in fat but still shredded fine without being dry. I added a ton of balsamic vinegar to store-bought BBQ sauce with great results.

Very tasty! The BBQ sauce is key though. My favorite is a combo of Jack Daniel's Original No. 7 sauce & Sweet Baby Ray's Award Winning Sauce with a dash of Garlic Salt mixed in. Yummy.

Really easy and yummy. You can use your favorite BBQ sauce to make it taste however you want, but I used Bullseye Sweet and Tangy, and it tasted great. The baking in the oven is a great step beyond just the crockpot way, because it makes the tips crispy.

I have used this recipe for the past 3 years to feed 80 - 100 kids from our Church Youth group.  It is easy, I use 2 large crock pots, cook pork shoulders (I buy them in packs of two at Costco) all night, shred them in the morning and add Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  Then I put the meat in the refrigerator, then back in the crock pot a few hours before serving to get it warm.  It is a great way to serve a large crowd of hungry teenagers!

Great recipe to follow! I used a pork butt, great with one bottle of beer or the can of beef broth.  Cooked on low overnight (7-9 hours), turned off cooker for hour for meat to cool, then trimmed fat and shredded/pulled pork.  Can then be refrigerated with or without bottle of sauce (more or less sauce depending on taste and amount of meat).  Or can be put back on low with sauce for 2 hours or so, maybe longer if coming from refrigerator.  Excellent taste! especially with Sweet Baby Ray's.  Very tender and got rave reviews!

I used the boneless ribs for BBQ, added 1 bottle of beer as the broth did not cover all the meat...left on high for 6 hours...the meat fell apart, it was very easy to remove any fat, I shredded it, used baby rays bbq sauce as recommended by others and served on potato rolls.  So easy and really tasty.  5 stars for ease definately!  will be making again.

I always follow the recipe exactly the first time I make something, and this recipe did not disapoint! It was very simple and my fiance and friends thought it to be better than most restaurants they've had pulled pork at! I used pork butt and the sweet baby rays bbq sauce, which I did not find to be too sweet (although I tend to like my sauce on the sweet side). I will definitely be making this again in the future, and may play with the ingredients a bit, but it is great as is

I have made this twice so far. The only change I made was adding some minced garlic and pepper to the slow cooker and I used chicken broth because that's all I had in the house. The prok I used was marinated in garlic and onion marinade.  Also I cooked the pork for almost 6 1/2 hours just because I wasn't home all day. Served it on kaiser rolls and it was just as amazing as the first time I made it! The prok literally melts apart after you take it out of the slow cooker to shred. Delish!

Excellent and simple!  Instead of broth I used an India Pale ale beer (1 1/2 cans) and cattleboyz barbaque sauce and it was amazing.  First time I made it and my guests ate it all!  Dellicious!

I made this exactly as written.  Excellent!  I used the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ as some suggested and it was wonderful.  My husband said it was the best BBQ sandwich he ever had.  Will make again and again.

As you can see from the ratings, this is truly one of the best pork bbq recipes.  It's easy and fool proof.  I usually add a few fresh crushed garlic to this. Also, be sure to spoon some broth over the meat when cooking it in the oven in the final step.  I have even used this same exact recipe to make ribs and pulled chicken.

Wow! Was this good and super simple. I loved the taste that came from baking it in the oven. I think baking it causes the sugars in the sauce to caramlize? I did bake mine a bit hotter (400 degrees). I also used a pork butt roast, which was pretty fatty, but was able to pick out much of it before baking it.  I used Annie's BBQ sauce which I think are wonderful.

This was AMAZING! I did it a little differently from the instructions. After cooking it in the crock pot, I shredded it in a separate bowl, emptied the broth out of the crock pot, then put the shredded pork back in the crock pot with a smidge of liquid smoke and the BBQ sauce until the rest of the meal was ready. That turned out well, and I didn't have to fire up the oven.

This recipe is so easy, and super yummy! Instead of ribs, I use either a pork shoulder or butt and it falls apart when finished.

This was soo great and easy! It really doesnt matter how long u put the pork in for your just going to shred it anyways. I used a pork loin roast and put on low for 6hrs. Than took it out saved the broth, threw meat back in with like 1/2 cup of broth and it soaked it right up. Added some spices. Than barbaque sauce and put on warm for a few hours. Didnt have the greatest sauce so I had to throw other ingre. in to livin it up but its not the recipes fault. Put on some buns with some horseradish. Just excellent!! Ive never liked pulled pork but now I do!:)

I've made A LOT of different recipes for pulled pork.  This recipe is so simple but it is really the best I've had.  I didn't change a thing and it was fantastic.  We do the South Beach Diet so I found the lowest sugar BBQ sauce I could (which happened to be Famous Daves) and served it on a whole wheat bun.  Thanks for this great recipe!

Best pulled pork sandwich!! This was my first time making bbq pork sandwiches and it was so easy! I followed the directions almost exactly, except that I used pork ribs and had to pull the pork off the bone. I also let the pork cook about 6 hours, which made it sooo tender and easy to pull off the bone. Def. put in oven before serving!!!!

First time I have ever made anything like this. It was easy and very very delicious.I used 3.62 lbs. of pork rib. I did the broth and then 2 hours into I added half a can a beer. It was falling apart by the time the 4 hours came around. I used Hunts Hickory Honey BBQ sauce and it was actually really good. Next time I'll try the Sweet Baby Ray's every one is talking about.

Excellent recipe! Great for those days where you need to do a few things and want to come home to dinner. I made a few changes to the recipe. Another reviewer suggested using a pork butt or shoulder so I did. I added 1 sliced yellow onion to the bottom of the crockpot. I also seasoned the meat with garlic powder, salt and peper rub. Then put in in the crock pot with the beef broth for 4 hours on high. After 4 hours I removed the meet and onions poured out the juice and shreded the meat. Then put the onions and pork into the crock pot w/ 1/2 a bottle of BB-Q sauce on low for 1 hour. Served as suggested -- it was perfect!

Great recipe!  And so easy.  Like some others, I transferred the shredded meat back to the crockpot instead of finishing it in the oven.  I also used a pork butt instead.  Everyone loved it!

I made this yesterday for dinner last night and the 3 of us have almost finished it off! I used a 4# pork loin and it cooked to fork tender in 6 hrs. on high. I did put it in the oven afterwards with the BBQ sauce and it turned out great! Very easy and low mess. I will be making this again!

YUUUUUUMMMMY!!!!  I used a 4.5 lb. pork butt roast, cooked in the crock pot for 5 hours on high, and it was perfect!  I used Big Al's K.C. BBQ sauce from this site (which is my new favorite sauce) and it was fabulous!

WOW! Some of the best BBQ I've ever had and I can't believe how easy it was! I used a 4.5 lb pork roast and cooked it on high for 6 hrs. Meat fell apart. Used Sweet Baby Ray BBQ sauce which is my favorite. Thank you for sharing this AMAZING recipe!

Awesome!  I can't believe how the meat was just falling apart after 4 hours in a crockpot!  I cooked the meat in beer instead of broth because it's all I had on hand.  I rubbed the meat down with texjoy/pepper and used Sweet Baby Rays original.

So incredibly easy! Tastes like the stuff you buy in the tub at the store, but a wee bit cheaper, with less additives and the satisfaction you get of cooking for yourself. Pork butt or shoulder have both worked very well, both have been inexpensive. I have tried it with the beef broth or a can of beer, both were good but I prefer the beer simmered taste. Then it's mixed with Sweet Baby Rays sauce, hickory & brown sugar. I make sliders using hawaiian sweet rolls, and take them to work for lunch all week. I never get sick of 'em!

This recipe was awesome! I made it for dinner yesterday and everyone said it was amazing! I used a 4 lb pork shoulder(boneless) and through it into the crockpot with 14oz of beef broth, onions and a bottle of Jack Daniel's original BBQ sauce! I cooked it about 7 hrs on low and shredded it and cooked it another 2.5 hrs. Perfect!!

This is a super easy recipe.  BBQ sauce is so important.  I used Stub's bbq sauce & found that it lacked flavor.  For some reason it didn't compliment the pork the way I thought it would...Yeah, go figure? Cooking in the oven for 30 minutes makes the edges nice and krisp.  So, next time I will use regular Kraft & will cook in the oven a little longer for more krispness.

Feeding a family of 8, while being able to kick it up a notch to this recipe I use a large, yet inexpensive pork roast.  I dump in a 40 oz bottle of Kraft barbecue sauce. (Sweet Baby Ray's isn't bad either.)  Dump in 1 can of Coca Cola. (If your slow cooker is large enough, add 2 cans of Coke)  Add 1 (8 ounce) can of mandarin oranges with juice.  Add 1/2 cup brown sugar.  Finally I add to that a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes.  Simmer overnight, remove pork and shred, return to the mixture, and serve over homemade rolls.

Added red pepper flakes, a clove of garlic. I go alittle bit light on the bbq sauce and then serve some on the side for those who like a very "saucy" sandwich. Cole slaw is a MUST with pulled pork - here in Maryland it's generally put right on the sandwich. This recipe was great!

My whole family loves this recipe! I threw in a can of beer because I had a pretty darn big roast and I wanted enought liquid. The house still smells good, and I made this last night! Next time I will use more than 18oz bbq sauce, and I am not sure if I will bake it because I prefer juicy meat and the baking dries it out and even burned parts after 30 mins. Still....this is a wonderful dinner!

Awesome recipe! I took Amethystshells' recipe for the bbq sauce and it was AMAZING! The only other alteration I made was to cut the brown sugar and ketchup in half. Instead I added in some broth from the slow cooker to make up for the lost ketchup. It makes it less sweet and still really delicious.

We also used the Butt roast. It pulled apart easily. I added Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and returned meat to slow cooker on low for another hour before serving same day for dinner. My kids loved it, we loved it. It lasted for days as left overs and the kids still ate it.

My husband would say it's a 5 star recipe, but for me, maybe just a four. Not a big fan of pork myself. Still, it was super easy. I put it in the slow cooker with beef broth and some garlic and onion for about 11hrs on low, drained it, pulled it, then back in the slow cooker with the BBQ sauce (Bull's eye spicy cajun) for another 3 hrs.

WOW......This was the BEST BBQ I have had in a long time.  I did follow the recipe and used 3 pounds of country style ribs, with 1 can beef broth.  The ribs were falling apart as I took them out of the crockpot.  Shredding them was no problem, there was hardly any fat at all. The pork was so moist.  I did put it in a dutch oven uncovered for about 35 minutes.  I added extra sauce, we like ours saucy.  Glad I did, because they came out PERFECT.  I made the "Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce" from this site.  I am so glad I did.  Not only have I found my new pork Sandwich recipe, but also a new BBQ Sauce recipe. They compliment each other nicely.  I served on jumbo sandwich buns, with coleslaw and baked beans.  My husband said it was better than going down the street to one of the local BBQ places. I have been craving a Great BBQ sandwich for a couple of weeks now, this definitely hit the spot.  Thanks so much for this FABULOUS Recipe.

I was told by everyone who tried this that it is my best BBQ sandwich yet.  I did modify the recipe a bit.  I used a 3.5 lb pork shoulder instead of ribs.  I put the pork in the slow cooker with a can of beef broth, 1/2 yellow onion and 2 cloves of garlic.  I followed the recipe from there and used my hubby's homemade BBQ sauce on the meat before I baked it in the iron skillet.  After baking it, I put it back in the slow cooker with  1/4 cup red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup ketchup, 1/2 cup chili sauce, 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp lemon juice, 2 tsp lime juice, 1/2 tsp dijon mustard, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper sauce, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes, 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp Maggi seasoning.  It tasted wonderful!  I have already had requests for it again.

This is really good. Exactly how it should taste. I accidentally bought vegetable broth and that worked fine. Cooked on low for 10 hours and then put it in the oven as specified. Yum!

This was soo good & easy! Use a good BBQ sauce though as this will affect the final taste. Like others I used beer, also sprinkled garlic powder on a pork loin before cooking. Once shredded I just returned it to the crockpot, cooked on high about 1/2 hour.

I used a 4lb pork shoulder, and 1 bottle of beer instead of the broth.  Drained the meat, shredded the meat, added a bottle of Baby Ray BBQ sauce and threw back into the crockpot for an hour.  My husband and I LOVED it.  Highly recommend!

I used a 5 lb pork butt and cooked on low for 8 hours.  I shredded and pulled out the chunks of fat.  I made a BBQ sauce from a recipe on this site called "Big Al's KC Bar-B-Que Sauce" It was awesome.  That sauce has some awesome flavor.  For recipies like this you have to have a great sauce.  No store bought kind will do it justice.  Thanks for such a simple yummy recipe!

THIS WAS AMAZING!!! I followed the recip exactly excep that I think my ribs stayed in the crockpot for about 9 hours total and then towards the end of their bout in the oven I turned it to broil to get the top a little more done. I used Bullseye original bbq sauce because it's our favorite, and we needed just under a full bottle. It tastes amazing and I have a feeling this will be a staple in my house for the rest of my life. My future children are thanking you!!!

This is such a great easy recipe that feeds an army. Even with three kids, we can make this meal last for days. Before I put in the bbq sauce, I save half of the meat to make shredded pork tacos (add taco seasoning of course!) for the next day. Thanks for the great recipe!

As per previous recommendations, I used a cheaper cut of pork (Publix euphemistically refers to it as the 'Picnic Cut') and cooked it with beef broth.  I did add a cup of coffee that is mentioned in a separate recipe and it was great!  Deboned the pork, shredded it, put it in the fridge overnight with some BBQ sauce then reheated the next day.  AWESOME!

I used pork butt for this recipe.  I put it in the crock pot for 10 hours on low with beef broth & one beer.  After 10 hours I took it out, shredded the meat, added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce then spread it into a 9x9 baking pan.  I didn't have a ton of time (everyone was getting hungry)so I just put the meat under the broiler for a few minutes to get the meat a little crispy without having to wait another 30 minutes.  I will definetly make this again!  My husband & brother would not stop talking about how great the sandwiches were that I made.  And what girl doesn't like a little praise?  ;-)

This was delicious.  It was a huge hit at my daughters birthday party.  Will definitely make again.  Used some beer along with the broth and used Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce with a couple dashes of hot sauce.

DELICIOUS!!  My crockpot was buried in a cabinet, so I made a few adjustments.  I used about 3 1/2 lbs of boneless ribs.  In a pot, I added the ribs, 3/4 can of low sodium beef broth, 3/4 can of beer, garlic powder, onion powder and black pepper.  I let it cook (covered) low and slow in the oven - about 3 hours at 250 degrees.  I pulled the pork apart with two forks (soooo tender), drained about 1/2 the liquid and added about 2 bottles of BBQ sauce (1 Jack Daniels & 1 Cattleman's - it's what I had on hand).  I stuck it back in the oven at 325 degrees for 30 minutes.  My husband and teenage son couldn't get enough!  Still have a ton left over and hope it freezes well for another meal!

This was the first time I ever made BBQ pulled pork sandwiches and it was so easy and came out delicious! I only had a pound of pork loins, so I just used that but I still used the whole can of beef broth in the slow with a dash of s&P and garlic. They shredded very easily and  I used about 3/4 a bottle of sweet baby ray's hickory & brown sugar BBQ sauce and put in the oven for only 15 mins at 350. I served with mac and cheese and corn on the cob, the pound served 4 people with a little leftovers. Will absolutely use this recipe time and time again.

AWESOME recipe....my husband is the pickiest easter I know, and he LOVED this pork.  I went with what some of the other reviewers said and used a pork roast, I let it cook in the crockpot with a very minimal amount of water, rubbed some dry seasoning on it and cooked it for about 8 hours.  It literally fell apart when I took it out!  Then we actually kept it in the  fridge overnight and cooked it in the iron skillet the next day.  DELICIOUS!!  Will use this recipe again!

Yum!  So simple and yet so tasty!  I used a sweet thick barbeque sauce with it, it made a ton of food and I had my coworker I let taste a bite of my leftovers ask for the recipe.  Will definitely make again!

This is a very easy recipe and everyone, even the kids liked it. The only changes I made were I kept the pork in for 6 hours, I used beef stock (the whole 32 ounces), and I was very generouse with the bbq sauce. I dont have a dutch oven or an iron skillet so I just put it in a cake pan and covered with tin-foil.

This was fantastic. Followed recipe exactly for ingredients.  Used pork loin boneless country style ribs which were on sale and our favorite, Jack Daniel's original No. 7 bbq sauce. Cooked on low in crock pot about 6 to 7 hours and then 30 minutes in oven. Will stock up on meat when it's on sale and make this regularly - so easy for such great taste.

This was my first try at BBQ pork and I know I will never have to search for another recipe.  Both my husband and I agreed it was the best we had ever had.  I did use a bottle of Sam Adams beer instead of beef broth, and baked in oven as suggested.   Amazing.  Better than restaurants.

Awsome!!  I took this to a Super Bowl party and it was the hit of the food table.  Took the advice of the other reviewers and used beef broth and beer in the slow cooker and used a boston butt (trimming off the fat first).  Cooked it the day before, put it in the fridge, then added barbecue sauce and popped it in the oven 30 minutes before we left for the party.

This BBQ is unbelievable! My husband says it is the best he has ever had. I personally think it is second to my favorite local BBQ joint, but I absolutely LOVE their pulled pork. We have made this 3 times in the last month. So easy! Used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. Only change was adding a few dashes of liquid smoke to the beef broth.

Oh baby this is good! I didn't have any beef broth, so I used chicken stock w/ one beef boullion cbe disolved in it. I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. I didn't have quite enough, so I made some homemade to mix w/ it ( Delicious bbq sauce from this site). It was wonderful! I also didn't have pork ribs, so I used a pork roast that I had. Cooked it from frozen in my crock pot all day on low. Came out perfect! Will be making this again for sure. :)

This was wonderful!  5-stars for taste and 5-stars for simplicity.  I used country ribs on the bone because that's all my store had.  It wasn't a problem though b/c when I was ready to shred it, it fell right off the bone.  Will be making this one regularly.  Thanks!

This recipe was super easy and outstanding!  The meat was so tendered it took no time at all to shred.  I followed instructions using Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Yum, yum!

Excellent!!  We had enough left-overs for the rest of the week.  I decided to cook a butt roast for 10 hours in the beef broth.  Then I pulled it apart and mixed it with our bbq sauce and put it back in the crock pot for another 30 minutes on low.  Sandwiches were amazing, we chopped up jaleps and topped the sandwiches off with them and some swiss cheese!

As long as you use a bbq sauce you love, you can't really go wrong w/this recipe! Doesn't get any easier!! I always use a cheap pork roast when making this-whatever's on sale!

I made this last night and all my guest loved it. I used haIf bottle of a darker beer and 1 can of beef broth. I tried Baby Ray's Honey BBQ like many suggested and it was great. I tried the leftover pork for dinner tonight using Jack Daniels Hickory Brown Sugar and I would definitely recommend Jack Daniel's. My husband agreed. I also added caramelized onions before putting it in the oven. Served it with provolone cheese and hamburger buns. Delish!!! Tasty and easy. Thank you for sharing.

Kind of like the "baby back ribs" recipe, this is more about the cooking process than the actual ingredients - and its important!  I always just poured a bottle of BBQ over some pork and left it in the slow cooker, shredded and plopped it on a roll.  This is sooooo much better.  You get rid of the fat, you get a nice texture from baking, and its just so worth it!!!  BBQ sauce ideas - Sweet Baby Ray's is just too sweet for me, Jack Daniels Hickory Smoke is ok... I prefer Cattlemans so far!

Added whole cloves of garlic with the pork.  Used 4 lb. pork shoulder, Red Tail Ale BBQ Sauce from Whole Foods, and served with sweet potato fries.  Very good!

Really really yummy!

I made this exactly, except that I used an inexpensive 4.5 lb bone-in pork shoulder.  I cooked it 4 hrs on high, but it wasn't really shredding, so I left it in for another hour on low.  The meat totally fell of the bone and pretty much shredded itself!  Oh, and stick with the Baby Rays BBQ sauce!!

I have made pulled pork dozens of times, but have never added beef broth.  This makes a WORLD of difference - absolutely exceptional recipe.  I didn't use ribs, but used an inexpensive pork roast, with the fat trimmed, and it was still very tender.

This was absolutely delicious!!! I follewed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing. I read other reviews and everyone mentioned to use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, so I made sure to pick some up & use for this recipe. (I had never tried it before) It is great and would recommend it to anyone to go along with this recipe. Simply delicious & a great dish to make for watching football on Sunday!!!!

I used a 3lb pork butt roast with bone in (bc it was on sale at the store), put it in the crock pot all day, turning it over halfway through the day so it would cook properly, and it was very easy to pull out and shred with a fork, removing the bone and fat. Then transferred all the shredded pork to a oven-safe glass casserole dish poured the bbq sauce allover, covered with foil and baked. My husband RAVED about it!!!

I give this just 3 stars. It wasn't that appealing to me. The difference was that I used pork chops instead of pork ribs, beer in place of beef broth (as per Jen's post) and used Kraft original BBQ sauce. Guess it needs a difference sauce? I do want to try it again just so I can taste 5 stars.

So yummy and delicious, my husband said it was time open a restaurant! I used 4 lbs boneless pork shoulder, cooked it on low for about 10 hours with the beef broth. Then I mixed it with 24 oz of Jack Daniels honey smokehouse bbq sauce and threw it in the oven for 30 minutes. It was so easy, we'll definitely be eating this again soon!

I followed some of the recommendations of other reviewers...I couldn't find boneless pork ribs so I used pork on the bone. I cooked it in a slow cooker for 10 hours which made the pork fall right off the bone and it was very easy to separate. I used beer as a substitute for beef broth and I made the barbeque sauce from another recipe (Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce) and I LOVED it. Both recipes took very little time and I highly recommend the combination!

WOW! This is fantastic!  After only trying this recipe three weeks ago, my husband has requested it every week. As others suggested I use a pork butt roast, and my butcher removes the bone for me.  I have only made one other change to the recipe, and only because I like a really wet bbq.  Once the pork is ready, I remove it from the slow cooker, pull it apart, and add the bbq sauce. I don't put it in the oven, otherwise no matter how much sauce I add, it seems to make it a little too thick for my liking.  We have it on buttered pan fried sourdough bread, topped with cole slaw and sliced pickles. This recipe is sooo easy and tastes sooo good. If I could, I would rate it a ten!

Okay, I did not have beef broth, but I used chicken broth (one can) with a pork roast (2 lbs or so, I think), and half an onion, thinly sliced. It slow-cooked for about 5 hours, and then I did the shred, cover with BBQ sauce & bake thing. It was awesome!! I almost didn't make it because of the lack of beef broth, but I'm so glad I did! We had sandwiches with homemade coleslaw and sweet potato fries. YUM!

Fantastic!  I didn't have beef broth on hand, but had lots of beer.  So I did what another reviewer did and used beer instead.  Came out great!  I'm also dieting, so to limit my intake, I had mine on two large whole wheat crackers.

Very good and it was so easy!  I used the whole bottle of BBQ sauce, but will use less next time.  My husband is picky and loved it also!

Was very good and filling, though I cooked much longer than recommended. It fell apart in the cooker. I drained half of the broth off and then added the BBQ sauce and kept it in the slow cooker. Was awesome, though my hubby suggested adding a bit of hot sauce or jalapeno next time.

I made this for dinner tonight, it was so easy and so good. I don't have a crockpot so I had to cook it in the oven. So what I did was, I put 2 cups of beef broth in a casserole dish, sprinkled the pork ribs with garlic & onion powder, placed the ribs in the dish, covered it and baked it at 300 degrees for 3 hours. They were so tender, it didn't take hardly anytime to pull them apart, after that I put them in another casserole dish poured my homemade bbq sauce on them gave them a couple of good stirs, covered it and put it in the oven at 325 degrees for 30 min. They were fantastic!!! Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with all of us, will be making this again real soon!!!

I made this yesterday for a bbq.  It was a big hit! Everyone loved it. I used a 5-6 pd. boneless pork butt.  Cooked it for 5 hours on high.  I wanted to make homemade bbq sauce but time was an issue so I used Sticky Fingers Tennesse Whiskey bbq sauce, it was excellent.  I mixed the sauce and shredded pork in a dutch oven and heated it in the oven.  I also made Sweet retaurant slaw (from this site) to go with it. I would definitely make this again. It was nice to have something a little different than just burgers and hot dogs at this point in the bbq season. I ended up with a lot of left over hamburgers!

This is a really great recipe.  I recommend using Big Al K.C. bbq sauce recipe to make this outstanding.  Like others I used a 4lb pork roast butt and it worked out perfectly.  Also, I would recommend cutting the cooking time to 3.5 hours since you will baking it in the oven for another 30 minutes.

Used boneless pork butt on low for 6 hours. Gave the butt a little rinse and pat dry with a good peppering before placing in the beef broth bath. This thing just fell apart when I took it out. Shredding was easy...trimmed the fat...added sweet baby ray's and let it sit for another half hour on low before serving. Served on whole wheat buns that were toasted under the broiler. So yummy!

delicious

i've made this several times.  so easy, turns out moist, flavourful, just great.  don't ruin all your time (it's not a lot of work) and douse it in a 'so-so' bbq sauce... use something you really love, or try making one from scratch.  great recipe

This made wonderful sandwiches! I used a few packages of thinly sliced pork chops, which may not be the cheapest way to go but it was certainly lower in fat since I was able to cut all the extra fat off. I cooked them on high for 4 hours and they was so tender and delicious. I would definitely recommend this to anyone. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious! Not to mention incredibly simple. Everyone who's tried these have been in love with them. I've made this several times, and I've used the "shoulder butt" cut every time (ask the meat counter to debone the meat for you before you leave the store. It's a breeze for them and free for you). The shoulder butt is a great cut for the crock pot - cheap but still comes out incredibly tender and shreds like a dream. The only downside of the shoulder butt is that it can be quite fatty, but it's not difficult to trim the fat off before throwing in it the crock pot. I serve these on toasted hamburger buns with slice a slice of American cheese and seasoned steak fries on the side. Yum!

Delicious! We followed the recipe but didn't put in the oven. Instead, we put the shredded pork in a pot and added bbq sauce (chris & pitts), garlic salt, 4 oz of Chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (ran through food processor); mixed it all well. Toasted Kaiser roll buns, added the bbq porked, topped with aged swiss cheese and French Fried Onions (sauteed onions might work even better). It was delicious! My picky eater had just shredded pork sandwiches with A1 sauce...he loved them. We accompanied them w/baked beans, fresh veggies (broccoli, carrots & baby spinach) dipped in ranch dressing.

Best ever pork sandwiches!!!  I used a pork shoulder roast.  I cooked the meat for 12 hours in beef broth and beer and then cooked it in Sweet Baby Rays in the oven for 30 minutes.  Turned out great!!  Husband says to definitely make this again!!

This is "OMG!" good!  I used two 2-lb. pork roasts (they were on sale) and used garlic powder, salt and pepper rub on roasts before adding to beef broth in crock pot.  I cooked on high for 4 hours and the meat was incredibly tender and moist.  After I shredded the meat, I emptied crock pot of broth and added shredded pork and barbeque sauce to heat on low for 5-8 minutes while I prepared the sides.  Finally, I used the "Sweet Restaurant Slaw" recipe on here by Sandi Johnson (made it this morning when I put pork in crock pot) and topped it on the pork and made pork sandwiches.  The slaw was also a 5+ and tasted as good as, or better, than the one that large chicken chain serves.  I highly recommend both!!

I LOVE this BBQ recipe! The pork is unbelievably moist and tender.  It has awesome flavor, and it is extremely easy to pull apart.  I used the sauce recipe that was given on the review by amethystshells and it was INCREDIBLE!  I've already passed this recipe along to many, many people!

This was AMAZING. I cooked it in the crockpot on high for 8 hours then added the bbq sauce and cooked another 20.  There's no need to cook it in the oven.  I normally make this with chuck roast, but not anymore! This was so tender and wonderful!!!

Very good and easy to make.  I used a pork roast.  I poured 1/2 of the barbecue sauce into the crockpot with the beef broth and left it to cook for 8 hours.  I then removed the pork from the crockpot and shreded it and placed it in a casserole dish in the oven with the rest of the sauce and a little of the broth from the crockpot for 30 minutes.  I took it to a potluck and it was a hit!

This was the best!!!  I took the advise of others and used a pork roast and Sweet Baby Rays Sauce.  I did however use 2 bottles of the sauce we like ours super saucy!!  Pork roast is fairly inexpensive and I didn't have to deal with any bones.  I made this picnic style, corn on the cob, french fries and a great corn bread recipe from this site.  Will definatley make again.

The beef broth is not "needed" since the fat from the meat provides more than enough liquid to keep the pork from drying out...however it does add subtle depth and flavor to the meat.  There are plently of good homemade BBQ sauce recipes on this site...try something new instead of grabbing a bottle at the store....use a pork butt...it's easier.

Definitely a keeper! I usually don't like pork BBQ, but this recipe has changed my mind. The entire family LOVED this on kaiser rolls w/fries. So easy and delicious (Try Sticky Fingers Carolina Sweet Sauce).

wow! this is super easy and goof-proof. i used lean pork loin chops ( because that's what I had in the freezer), and it still worked great. my husband said he wanted this dish every week! I used a can of beer in place of the broth, and it added great flavor! thanks so much for this great recipe that can be made low fat.

This is a 5 star recipe because it is very simple, requires only 3 ingredients and is tasty. I cooked my pork for 4.5 hours and it shredded just fine. I also used Hunts Original bbq sacue- it is very simple and not overpowering. I have found that when you are serving many people, a recipe like this is best. People can always add more bbq, hot sauce, cole slaw etc.

This was actually my Christmas lunch for the family and it was a big success. I used about 5 lbs of bone-in pork butt roast, and cooked it on high for about 4.5 hours; it shredded beautifully.  After shredding I put it in a glad container with about 1.25 bottles of KC Masterpiece Hickory bbq sauce, put it in the fridge overnight then heated it up the next day.  It was even better by itself - not as a sandwich!

I did exactly as the recipe called for - EXCEPT - I used a cheap, bone-in blade cut shoulder pork roast.  After cooking in the c/p I drained, shredded and put into an 9x13 pan with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ and baked.  Everyone just raved about how good it was, thanks for sharing such a great and easy recipe!

Very yummy! I use to just put bbq sauce and pork in crockpot and cook for a few hours but this way is much better. I cook these overnight, in the morning I shred the pork then I let them cook til half hour before dinner then I add bbq sauce to crockpot. Whole family loves this recipe.

I don't think this could be any easier. I bought a pork butt which was only 20 cents a pound cheaper then a pork roast and found it to be really really fatty, with even a few bone chips. But....it was fabulous. I used Sweet Baby Rays as others mentioned and served it on Ciabatti rolls and it was great. I wish I would have gotten the bigger bottle of BBQ sauce though so it would have been a little more moist.

I used a prok shoulder which I slow cooked for 12hours in the BBQ sauce and broth mixture. I then shredded it with a fork and then mixed it with a fresh bottle of BBQ sauce. Made it a day ahead and reheated it. Everyone loved it!!

This recipe was the best. I used pork shoulder because I couldn't find pork ribs. I used 3.5lbs and used one can of low sodium beef broth. It helped I think to cut the pork shoulder up first into 4 or 5 large pieces before putting it in the cooker. This made for easier shredding. I cooked on high for 3 hours and then on low for 2 hours. YUMMY!!! What an easy and economical dish. Both my kids loved it and I will definitely make again and again. Can't wait to make for a crowd. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!!

This recipe is amazing!  I'm not a fan of pork and since I read all the great reviews I thought I would try it.  I bought boneless country style ribs and cooked them on low in crockpot for 8 hours.  I drained the juice and shredded the meat which just fell apart so easy then added the Jack Daniels bbq sauce and put it all back in the crockpot for another hour on low.  DELICIOUS!!!!  Can't wait to make it again for company.

DELICIOUS.
I slow cooked the pork on low for 10 hours, like I read that someone else did, and it was so tender that I couldn't pick it up out of the pot without the help of a spoon!
My husband LOVED it.

After I took out the larger clumps of fat (highly recommend doing) and shredded the pork, I spooned a little of the pot's beef broth juices over the pork to make it real juicy (careful not to make it too juicy though!)

For the BBQ, I mixed some Corky's Smokin Hot BBQ sauce into some KC Masterpiece Original BBQ sauce. The Corky's sauce added a little bite to it-it turned out perfect!

Served on a whole wheat bun with baked beans and cole slaw-what an easy and delicious meal!

My husband and I now want to invite people over for a BBQ with this recipe!
FANTASTIC.

This recipe was fantastic!!  Try it!
I went to Rib-fest not that long ago and had the best pulled-pork sandwiches I had ever eaten.  I tried to replicate and could not. Until now!!  I used a half a pork roast (all I had) and put it in the slow cooker with the broth (all I had was chicken but I tried it anway).  The result was a very moist chunk of meat that shredded in no time.  I added a bottle of Kraft's Brown Sugar BBQ sauce (yes, it's sweet but brown sugar is a main ingredient in great pulled pork sandwiches!).
The quality of your sandiches will largely depend on your choice of BBQ sauce so pick wisely!!

FIFTEEN STARS!!  Perfect meal.  I only made one pound becuase I was unsure how I would like it, I should have cooked all three!  It fell apart and just metled in your mouth.  I put them on buns that I buttered and put in the oven to make nice and toasty. My boyfriend  and my roomates loved it too. Thanks so much!

We really enjoyed this, especially the fact that it is so easy!  I didn't love the bbq sauce I chose to use, but that was my fault and not the recipe.  I used boneless ribs, and after 2 hours in the crockpot on high and another 2 on low they fell apart easily.  Definately a keeper, thanks KK!

This was so easy and good. We used a cheap cut of pork and some bottled sauce and it turned out just as good as any barbecue I've had in restaurants. I did put it in the oven and I think it definitely added a certain texture to the meat that made it so much better than it would have been had I just put it back in the crockpot and it didn't make it any more work.

Freakin delicious. I used hogy rolls to put the meat onto and also spread olive oil over the bread and broiled them until golden brown. It was without a doubt my favorite recipe so far!

All I can say is "WOW"! This one deserves even more than 5 stars. For 2 reasons; simplicity and flavor! It's about one of the easiest recipes I've ever encountered and the pork comes out yummy and moist! I worried that putting it in the oven for the last 30 minutes might dry it out but no, not at all. I served it to company along with homemade potato salad and it was a big hit. Very, very good indeed... I wouldn't change a thing. (Except next time, I will buy a bigger pork roast to make a larger portion!)

AWESOME!  This was SO easy to make and I got great results.  The night I made this, on Emeril Live was a similar recipe which used pork butt.  This was alot easier - especially to find in a grocery store.  I recommend trying this recipe.  I had a nothing but positive experience.  Thanks for sharing this.

I made this last night for dinner, and  I have none leftover! It was really good! I didn't think it would have much flavor with just the beef broth, but it did. I also used Open Pit Honey BBQ sauce. I have been talking about it all day! This one is worth it! thanks

Easy and Wonderful! I used my own homemade bbq sauce with brown sugar, honey, masterpiece bbq, and ketchup. My husband loved it!

Outstanding!  I only used half of the bottle of sauce mixed with one cup of the broth to retain the flavor of the pork.

This was really good.  I used a 4 lb. pork rump roast as I couldn't find boneless pork ribs.  It was very tender after the 4 hours on high.  I used the sweet and smoky barbecue sauce from Bandana's (a barbecue chain restaurant around here) which gave the meat a nice smoky taste.

Made this last week for dinner using a less expensive cut of meat.  Absolutely delicious!  I guess this is one of those recipes that you really can't go wrong with if you buy your favorite barbecue sauce. Quick and Simple!!  Thanks!

Made this the other day, but omitted the beef broth and used about 5lbs of pork butt roast.  I cooked in the crockpot on low for 9 hours, but it was probably done at or before 8 hours.  Man was it good!  I pulled it apart, removed all the fat and then mixed in some BBQ sauce in half the meat and froze the other half (that will be used in enchiladas next week!).  Served on toasted kaiser rolls with french fries.  Very yummy!  I'll make it again!

Very tasty.  The changes I made:  added a dash of onion powder to the shredded pork, and I did NOT use a whole bottle of bbq sauce.  I suggest adding and tasting.

Delicious and easy. I used pork tenderloin and Sweet Baby Rays sauce. I added a sliced onion to the crockpot and skipped the oven. Just shredded and put back in crockpot with sauce.

I have never made this before so I wasn't sure how it would come out.  But it was GREAT!!!  I will be using this recipe for house parties and cookouts!!  The only change I made was to add two cans of broth and cook for 8 hours only because I was at work that whole time!!!!

SOOO good.  I used chicken broth instead of beef (my husband doesn't eat beef) and cooked the pork on low for eight hours.  It fell apart easily, and mixed with a thick smoky sauce, it was delicious.  My husband (a good ol' southern boy) raved!

With a solid 5-star rating after 355 reviews, I figured this must be some good BBQ.  Well they were right, add me as number 356.  Fantastic recipe and simple to make!  

I used about 6 lbs of meat - a 3 lb boneless pork loin and a 3 lb boneless pork butt.  I simered the meat with 2 cans of beef broth, diced onions, and diced garlic for just over 4 hours.  I flipped in the pot a couple of times to ensure an even cook.  When done, it was so delicious even before the bbq sauce.  It shredded with ease.  I then mixed it all together with Kraft original BBQ sauce and cooked uncovered in the oven for 30-40 minutes at 350, stirring once.

The only change I would consider is the BBQ sauce.  I think it actually subdued some of the great flavor of the pork.  Other than that, a big thumbs up on this one!!!

This was easy and tasty. I used a boneless pork shoulder roast as others mentioned and added some garlic. Used Sweet Baby Ray's. I cooked on low for about 10 hours and the meat shredded easily. Hubby wasn't as impressed as I was but he is a picky eater. Will make again.

Loved it!  My entire family begged for me to make it again and again.  I used Sweet Baby Rays mixed with a local bbq sauce.  Next time I think I'll add a little liquid smoke to the crock pot, during the cooking time.  Also, I cooked it for 5 hours on high on accident, but it came out great!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is awesome, Make sure you dont add too much barbeque sauce because then it doesnt get the right texture after you bake it. If you want it more saucy I would add extra after baking.

Excellent! My husband and I don't like the same foods ... I made this for him, as I am not a big fan of BBQ. Turns out I loved it too. I used the boneless ribs like the recipe calls for. They fell apart so easily. I used a Memphis style BBQ sauce. This is really delicious and simple, and will be a regular recipe of ours from now on.

I used a shoulder instead of ribs and also used Stubb's BBQ sauce, it was YUMMY! I think the BBQ sauce you use would make a big difference, this one is alittle pricer than others, but it's worth it!

I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, which was fantastic!  I used pork butt shoulder which worked great.  Also added a package of Good Seasons Italian Dressing Mix to crockpot.  I cooked mine overnight since I used 8 lb. and needed it earlier in the day the next day.  My advice is not to overcook or overstir as texture can get pate-like, but still delicious!  To double, I doubled the meat, doubled the sauce, but still only used one can beef broth.

I took this basic recipe and jazzed it up a bit and it turned out amazing! First, slice on medium apple and place 1/2 of it on bottom of cooker, then slice a medium red onion and put 1/2 of the rings on bottom. Place your pork cut on top of apple and onion slices, then pour broth and BBQ sauce over, place remaining onion and apple on top. Slow cook all day and shred ...mmmmmmmmm....sooo good.

This was excellent!  I let mine cook for 8 hours on low instead.  Per someone elses suggestions I didn't shred too much.  While I was mixing in the BBQ sauce I thought I should put extra in, but decided not to on my first try.  After it was done cooking I realized that it really didn't need any extra sauce.  We had this on Kaiser Rolls, the whole family loved it!  Thanks!

What a great EASY meal!  I used a shoulder roast and added diced onion and a clove of garlic while in the crockpot.  Cooked on high one hour then low for about 6 hours and it was just falling apart.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent!  We used Sweet Baby Ray's honey BBQ sauce.  Very good.  I don't think you would have to put these into the oven.  Just drain the broth, shred the pork, add BBQ sauce, and continue cooking in the crock pot until the sauce is nice and hot.  These sandwiches are very good.

This is very easy and delicious.  Obviously you can't beat slow roasting on a smoker, but in the dead of Winter this hits the spot.  I seasoned the meat with some salt, pepper, garlic powder and sage prior to roasting.  I don't have a slow cooker so I roasted the meat covered in the oven at about 325 degrees.  Definitely the barbeque sauce will make or break this.  We like KC Masterpiece Original flavor.  It turned out great.

Excellent bbq sandwiches.  I cooked the pork on low for 8 hours in crockpot then baked it.  That is definitely the key to this great sandwich.  I will add a little more sauce the next time.  I also tried Sweet Baby Ray's sauce based on the other reviews and it is excellent on these sandwiches.

This recipe was a HIT!!!  I have fussy eaters in my family and this was one dish that no one complained about.  The kids even had second and third servings and asked if we had leftovers the next day.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

AMAZING! And o so easy! I made this recipe as is (I used Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce) for my husband's birthday dinner and he LOVED it!  He said it was just as good as his mother's:) I will definitely be making this again.

Excellent! Made this for a New Years lunch and EVERYONE loved it. I used Dinosaur which is a great bbq sauce if you can find it - was a very low stress easy meal to make and serve - I was actually able to hang out with my guests for the 1st time this holiday season and not spend the whole day in the kitchen! Thanks for the great recipe and all the helpful reviews!

Absolutely the best bbq pork that I ever had. The recipes is so easy to make, but instead of using ribs, I used a pork shoulder roast and it came out perfect. To top it off, I used for the first time, Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and the taste was outstanding. My son couldn't wait until dinner and was sneaking a taste here and there. I definite repeater!! Thanks

Great recipe.  I used almost 2 bottles of the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce ('Original' and 'Hickory & Brown Sugar')since I had 4 lbs. of boneless ribs and we like it kinda saucy.  Very good and very easy.  Cooked 4 hours on high and the meat tore apart easily.  Putting it in the oven is a must!  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a very easy recipe to make, and my entire family really enjoyed it, I used a boneless porkloin roast instead of the ribs and it worked very well.  And it all depends on the type of BBQ sauce, so use one that you really like.

My family came for dinner last night and this was what I served.  I previously cooked it in the crock pot for about 8 hours (i had a 7 lb pork shoulder roast).  when i took it out, i didn't have much shredding to do because it fell apart when the fork touched it.  i put it in the refrigerator with about a cup of the liquid.  the next day i mixed it with Grant's Famous Midnight Grill BBq Sauce and put it back in the crock pot for 3 hours.  we had fabulous sandwiches and i served it with extra sauce on the side.  awesome and easy recipe.

I used this recipe to make country style ribs for a large group.  I cooked them in aluminum pans covered with aluminum foil in the oven.  I started them at 400 degrees until they got hot then turned them down to 300.  Instead of pulling them apart I cut them into serving sized pieces.  They were a huge hit with my crowd.

This recipe was AWESOME! Delicious, delicious! The pork was so moist--everyone had seconds! Next time I will use a more tangy BBQ sauce. I just bought the store brand.

I was very pleased with this recipe as was my husband, it is definitely a keeper!  I had to use a pork loin roast as I was halving the recipe and couldn't find a package of ribs small enough.  I also realized at the last minute that I'd picked up vegetable broth instead of beef broth.  I was worried about the outcome but they were still fantastic.  Will make again and again!

Wonderful !!! Everyone in the family loved it. It's even better the next day !!! I bought my first crock pit yesterday & this was my first recipe. I added pepper to the meat before cooking and used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. Never heard of it before. But there it was on the shelf. Might add a bit of garlic next time. 

This was really, really good.

Thanks !!! Jen

Made this yesterday in the crockpot. Used a pork loin, a little over 4lbs., two cans of beef broth, and put sliced onion under and on top of loin while cooking.  It took longer to cook than expected,(left pork loin whole)I started on high for two hours then low the rest of the time.  (Should have left it on high with whole loin).  Heard so much in the reviews about Sweet Baby Rays that I bought some and other reviewers were right, wonderful.  I used one whole 18oz. bottle and probably 1/3rd of a second bottle of original after I shredded it.  I also put about 2/3 of a cup reserved broth back in and cooked for about 2 hours on low.  Wonderful, wonderful.  Served with cole slaw, bread and butter pickles and chips.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

Very good pulled pork! Prior to putting the boneless pork ribs in the broth, I rubbed Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic powder and pepper into them. I cooked them in crock pot on high for 5 hours, and they pulled apart very easily. I added my favorite Kansas City BBQ sauce that I purchased from a local BBQ restaurant. (most BBQ houses sell their secret sauce if you ask.) I served it to my hungry Hubby along with baked beans, potato salad and an ice cold beer when he got home from a hard day at work.

So easy and perfect for a crowd.  On my first batch I made the mistake of tearing the pork apart while it was in the broth and letting it simmer for awhile.  It came out with the consistency of wet newspaper.  Second batch I did pull it apart until after draining - much better.  I got tons of compliments on that one!

In a word, Awesome. Like everyone else I sauced it up with Sweet baby Ray's, although on the buns I used some Famous Dave's Smokey Chipotle, which I love. The meat just fell apart as soon as the fork touched it. Next I'll be trying this with chicken as some other reviewers have mentioned!

Oh yum...whenever my family craves bbq, this is the recipe we turn to.  Couldn't be any easier and it's sooooo good!  The only thing we change is rubbing the meat with Corky's bbq rub before placing it in the crock pot.  When it's done cooking, I take it out, shred it and put it back in the cleaned Crock pot with the bbq sauce and it's ready to go whenever anyone wants to eat.  We love it and have received great reviews from friends when they try it.

WOW!!!We moved from the south to the north and I have not been able to find good BBQ pork. So I decided to try myself. This was so easy and good. I put into crockpot overnight for 7 hours on low, then shredded and put back into crockpot with some of the broth & Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce for a couple hours more. PERFECT Can't wait to serve at a family party.

Delicious.  I brought it in to work and everyone loved it!  I used boneless pork shoulder instead and  it was great!  I drained most of the broth and put it back in the slow cooker with the bbq instead of the oven.

I've tried many recipes for pulled pork, and this one ranks right up there. I would make this for my co-woorkers and bring it in, crockpot and all. I used Sweet Baby Ray's ... one big bottle for the pork, with a spare for extra. Served on the brioche rolls from Trader Joe's, this makes one hefty and filling sandwich. All you need on the side is your favorite coleslaw, kettle chips and pickle spears.

I used a 3# pork butt roast - cooked on high in the crock pot for 5 hours with the broth and med chopped onion, then shredded.  Put back in the crockpot on low for 1 hr with lots of sauce (you may have to stir occasionally to be sure you have enough sauce on so it doesn't dry out) and served with whole wheat buns, Amish Slaw, and Basked Beans II all from this website.  Ate the slaw on the sandwhich.  Also habanero hot sauce from this site on the side so it was like the Smokey Bones experience for those who liked it hot - Everyone wanted the recipe(*s).

Excellent and super easy!  I used a boneless pork loin roast that I trimmed of fat and cut up into strips about the size of boneless country style ribs.  I used Emeril's Kicked Up BBQ sauce, which was very good, but I definitely agree with other reviewers that Sweet Baby Ray's is good as well.  Emeril was just on sale this week.  Either way, definitely a recipe to keep on hand.

I thought this was really good.  I couldn't find boneless pork ribs, so I grabbed some ribs that were on sale instead and it worked just fine.  I didn't have 3 lbs of meat, but since it had bones, I let it cook for about 3.5 hrs anyway.  It smelled pretty gross while cooking, and the meat was an unappealing grey color (that pork takes on when boiled).  BUT, once shredded and the sauce added, it looked and smelled *so* good.  Your results will depend largely on what sauce you use.  The recipe is easy, and a good way to get bbq sandwiches without a smoker.

This is a simple and delicious way for a great tasting dinner.  I use boneless country ribs when they are on sale (cheaper than boneless baby back ribs).  Be sure to pull out excess fat so you don't get a big glob on your sandwich.  Use your favorite barbecue sauce (I used Cattleman's or Sweet Baby Ray's).

A hit with my family everytime I make it.  Even my 5 year-old who doesn't like sandwiches loves these!  I make it exactly as written, and it turns out perfect each time.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's for the first time today.  Thanks for the tip.  It's tasty! (I had never heard of it here in Georgia, but I found it on the shelf at Publix.)

Just got back from a long weekend in Chicago, where we spent a day at Taste of Chicago. We loved the SBR "Boss" Pork Sandwiches, and my boyfriend asked me to figure out how we can make them at home. So I tried this recipe, using a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ Sauce, and it came out delicious. It looks gross while cooking, but after you take the meat out of the slow-cooker and shred it, it's fine. Also I didn't have a dutch oven so I just used a glass casserole dish. Delicious... I'll definitely make it again.

Great, I used boneless pork chops and they fell apart! I put peppercorns and parsley in with the broth for a little extra flavor. Super easy, great for summer.

wow, this simple recipe yields a very tasty sandwich! i boned western ribs ($2.00 per pound less expensive compared to the boneless variety) then cooked them as directed. previous reviews & curiousity led me to sweet baby ray's barbeque sauce. the original brand is rich & flavorful which complimented the shredded pork. serve on kaiser rolls. thank you kk!

I have made this recipe many times and it turns out great everytime, my neice always asks for it.  I use several different types of pork and they all work, I also just put it back in the slow cooker once i have shredded the pork and heat it up that way with the bbq sauce.  I have also left some of the liquid in the pot as we don't like it too dry and it gives it a nice flavour but thats a personal taste on our part

Of course, this recipe is only as good as your BBQ sauce.  But as far as amount of effort for how good it was, 5 stars all the way, baby!  I used 2 packages of country style ribs for a total of $8.  Put it in the slow cooker when they were still completely frozen.  Left the house for a social event and told hubby to follow the rest of the recipe with no guidance.  He was able to do it without calling me (good sign!), and I have yet another recipe that he can do!  Thanks again!

After cooking a pork loin in the slow cooker all day, I removed it, shredded it, added barbeque sauce and returned it to the slow cooker on low for a short time instead of putting in oven like recipe says.  It was wonderful.  My husband who is an avid barbeque lover, thought it was great.

The pork was tender but the taste was only okay.  We used our favorite BBQ sauce & served on rolls with cheddar & a side of coleslaw.  I think I would add some ingredients to the slow cooker if making this again.

Can I give this 10 stars?!  This was sooo good and easy, easy, to make! I used Sweet Baby Ray's Barbeque sauce which is our favorite. I had my mom over for dinner and she asked for the recipe right away.  She was shocked how easy it was. My husband and daughter loved it too. I'm so happy that I found this recipe.

UPDATE- Accidently bought regular pork ribs this time, the kind that have bones. What a mess trying to get all the bones out!  Will be more careful to make sure what I buy is boneless.  It was still just as good though, except for the tiny bones we hit!

This is a great recipe. I used boneless pork chops and honey bbq sauce. It was so good. I usually buy LLoyd's shredded BBQ pork but this is so easy and just as delicious if not better. Next time i will try it with chicken. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I used a pork shoulder roast for this recipe and Kraft Barbeque Sauce.  It was just OK.  Not yucky but not awesome either, just so-so.  Might try this again with a different Barbeque sauce though.  I liked the ease of preparation.

After I read some reviews, I made some changes. I substituted a bottle of beer for the beef broth, because I used a shoulder roast and it had plenty of fat that would negate using more "beef" broth. I also chopped up a whole green bell pepper and about 1/3 of a large onion. I poured the beer in the slow cooker, then the chopped up green pepper and onion then put in a 5.3# pork shoulder. Cooked on high for 4 1/2 hours. Took out the pork and shredded it. It was difficult to do and I was regretting using a cheaper cut, but I did get it all shredded and had about 1/3 of the roast that was fat and gristle which I threw away. Put the shredded pork in a large covered glass casserole bowl, added about a 1/4 cup or so of the remaining liquid. I also strained out the liquid from the pepper and onion pieces and put about half on top of the pork. Then I put in a whole bottle of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce on top and stirred it all together. Preheated oven 350 and have it about 30 minutes, stirring halfway through the time. The result was the best BBQ we ever tasted! 5 Stars! I am a retired male, my wife is still working so I do the cooking and she loves it!

My husband LOVES pulled pork, and this is the best recipe I have tried so far.  I used a 3-4 pound pork butt (shoulder) and rubbed it with with ground black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and sage. I chopped 1 medium onion for bottom of crock pot, added the meat and 1 cup water. I let it cook on low 10 hrs.  (5 hours on high) and took it out and let it sit for 10 minutes and discard the cooking liquids. I Shred it up with 2 forks and added BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) approx 1 1/2 bottles and baked it as in the recipe.  Loved the crispy ends.  Served on Publix fresh buns.  Served with homemade coleslaw.

When making pulled pork there is only one way to go, bone in Boston Butt, the best cut of meat for pulled pork. Season meat add onions and add two cups of water to a slow cooker. For a 5 lb. cut cook for 5 hours on low or until the meat begins to fall apart. Boston Butt makes a wonderful pulled pork.

Really easy and good. I used a cheaper cut - pork shoulder steak.  I had 3 1/2 pounds, but next time I'll make a couple pounds more so I can freeze some for another time.

Awesome, I used the BBQ sauce recipe that was in amethystshells review. All was great. I also used a pork butt and just trimmed the fat off. Will definitely make this again.

My all time favorite recipe for pulled pork. I always rub the meat down (a pork butt or pork ribs) with salt, pepper, garlic powder and minced onion for extra flavor. I place it in the slow cooker with the beef broth and cook as instructed. After shredding with the two forks, I throw it right back in the slow cooker (after draining the liquid out) with a mustard based barbecue sauce. Perfect every time!

This was a wonderful recipe for pork.  I used bone in pork ribs and added one medium sized onion cut into quarters.  Very tasty.  I serves this over rice with toasted naan bread on the side.

Excellent, easy recipe!  Family loved it so much that I took it to a potluck lunch at work where it was a huge hit!  I use my uncle's family BBQ sauce recipe, but I also tried it with Sweet Baby Ray's and it was very tasty.  The meat almost melts in your mouth.

Made this last night and my husband LOVED it.  I made a few changes though (kind of by mistake).  First I seasoned both sides of the pork (I used a cheaper cut as others have suggested) with a little bit of Worcestershire, salt and pepper before putting it into the crockpot.  I then misread the recipe and added the beef broth and BBQ sauce at the same time and cooked everything on low for 6 1/2 hrs.  After the pork was cooked through, we shredded it and put it in a baking dish and then just took a few spoonfuls of the sauce and drizzled it over the pork (enough to moisten but not have it soaking) & baked at 350.  We didn't bake for too long, probably only 10 mins.  When serving it, we added a little more sauce from the crockpot in the sandwich to make it nice and moist.  Delicious!!

Great recipe! I could not find boneless pork ribs so I used a Boston pork roast. I cut it into rib size pieces. They cooked in about 3 hours vs. 4 hours  stated in the directions, so keep an eye on them when cooking. BBQ turned out delicious!! Will definitey make again!

My husband is very picky when it comes to food. This recipe he liked it very much. I actually bought Pork loin short ribs, that are cut into strips. I thought I bought the right one. Then when actually watched the video. Nope, but it actually worked out great though.  It was my first time using a slow cooker. I kept checking on it! lol I am a nerd.  My husband bought more pork to make more!

Wow, yummy! I bought a 4lb "pork loin center cut boneless roast" and cut it in two (cause there are only 2 people eating dinner tonight). Then put the pork and broth in the crock pot for about 9 hours (while at work) then took it out, poured the whole 18 oz bottle of BBQ sauce over it and only put it in the oven (in a glass dish cause I don't have a cast iron) for 10 minutes to warm it up. It all depends upon the type of BBQ sauce you buy for flavor. But this was a simple, easy, and yummy way to make dinner!

I used a pork shoulder (Boston butt) for this recipe and bullseye BBQ sauce. My family LOVED it. There was no left overs remaining but they wished there was! Very simple and so good. Thank you!

This was hands down the best pulled pork ever. My mom even had to admit it was better than hers. I just cooked it for the times they recommended and used Jack Daniels Smokey Honey bbq. I will be using the recipe again and again

Great and easy recipe. The meat comes out very tender. The only thing I don't recommend is using sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, leaves it a little too sweet. Otherwise, it's great.

very good and very easy. Kind of sloppy with all the sauce. The kids really liked them.

2nd time I made- drained off liquid after cooking then added BBQ...see notes

The entire bottle of sauce was way too much. Good for as easy as it is. If you have a good sauce, it's hard to ruin it.

Absolutely amazing!! I could have ate the meat plan without any BBQ sauce. My husband and I have been dying to make it again. Honestly this is the best recipe for Pulled Pork sandwiches that I have every seen. I highly recommend

Really, really good.  I had some really rouch prok chops (boneless) and put them in the crockpot with the soup and cooked on low for 10 hours, then followed the rest of the recipe, shredding and then adding sauce and baking, Really great.  Almost no work.  Super!

My family absolutely loved this! I used 3lbs pork ribs and cooked on high for just over 4hrs and was so easy to shred. I used bulls-eye BBQ original sauce. Putting it in the oven for 30 min was the perfect touch. It did not dry the meat out at all like i thought it might.

Another Keeper!  Preteens, teen, and husband all loved this pork!  I did slice an onion for the bottom of the crock- Yummy!  After removing the meat and onions from the crock I strained the juice left and threw long grain rice in the crock with the juice (1/2 the amount of rice as juice) and left the crock on high.  Returned in an hour and the rice was perfect with nice flavors that was an easy side dish.  I'll try egg noodles next time maybe adding a few sliced veggies! The bbq also was good as bbq salad!  I also used Sweet baby Rays for the first time- It was a hit!

I used a 4-1/4 lb pork shoulder blade roast, which the butcher recommended.  Before cooking I removed about 1/2 lb fat, and there was still fat running through the roast (which I was able to remove a lot of while shredding later).  I don't know if this particular roast had more than usual, but I will not use this cut of pork again!  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was great - used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ sauce.  In a taste test, I don't  know if I'd be able to guess which is the Baby Ray's and which is the sauce I used to make, so why not save the time!!!

I'm rating 4 stars because this makes tasty sandwiches but it's not really a recipe.   I am still lookin for a crock pot pork bbq recipe that has originality.  This is a great quick dinner idea.

Such a fabulous recipe, and with only 3 ingredients!!!  We used Bull's Eye Memphis Style BBQ sauce, and it was delicious.  This would be an easy recipe to make for a party.  It made a lot for our family, so we will be freezing the rest to eat another week--looking forward to it!!!

Makes really great, tender meat. My only advice is to not use a sweet bbq sauce (like honey bbq) because it turns out WAY too sweet. Bullseye works much better.

It's important that you follow the directions exactly. The cooking time is key, if you slow cook it for 10+ hours it will be mushy. I've made this recipe a dozen times and followed many suggestions but none of them compare to the original posting.

So easy and so tasty!  Only made  a couple changes...ran out of bbq sauce so used ketchup (about 1/3 recipe).  Sweet BAby Ray's is our favorite bbq sauce.  Also, used pork loin because that's what I had here.

My family loved this!  I will definitely make again!  My son has already asked me to make it again and I just made it recently!   I didn't put in the crock pot because of time, but for next time, I will.  I also used a very thick bun, so they didn't fall apart.

I've made this many times and it is so good and easy. I don't put in the whole bottle of sauce. I just add a little at a time until I think it's enough.

Excellent although I have to review the process rather than the recipe as it was written.  Due to dietary concerns, I had to make a low-sugar barbecue sauce.  I also started the recipe late in the day and didn't have the time to make this is a crockpot.  I put a pork butt roast in a heavy pan along with beef broth and let it cook on the stove for 3-4 hours until the meat was tender.  I added my barbecue sauce after shredding the pork and did let it cook a little longer.  I think it will be even better after it sits.  Next time, I will make the meat a day ahead to allow for this.  I made the restaurant style cole slaw from AR as an excellent accompaniment.  My husband loves pulled pork and this was my first time trying such a recipe--it's definitely a keeper.  Thanks for a wonderful, easy recipe!

First time I made pulled pork.  Except for putting in an onion, I followed recipe as written....Cooked the pork in the slow cooker the day before.  The next day, I placed the pulled pork in the cooker, put in some of the natural juices/with half a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's on "Hi" for two hours.  I stirred a couple of times (the meat even browned).  Served with extra sauce (and cole slaw) on the side.  WONDERFUL!!!!!

This was great! Two things I different were: 1. cooked it for 8 hours in the crock pot and 2. use pork ribs with bone since my store didn't have any boneless.

This was fantastic and easy.  Coworkers were asking for a taste and the recipe at lunch.  I added a bottle of beer since I didn't have broth, which was a great choice.

Great recipe!  After reading several of the reviews regarding the cut of meat, I used a pork butt and it turned out great - really tender!  I shredded the pork and put it in a serving dish and mixed it with the sauce and kept it in the oven to keep warm.  Excellent!!

Make sure you choose a bbq sauce that has a flavor you really like since that is what you will taste. The meat came out so tender! Try topping with a little red coleslaw!

Absolutely hands-down the best pulled pork barbecue I've ever had!  I don't change anything.  I use Sweet Baby Ray's barbecue sauce.

Delicious and so easy!  I will definitely make this many more times in the future.  The only change I made was to add half a chopped white onion and a clove of crushed garlic to the meet in the crock pot.  We ate the leftovers for days!

I used pork butt instead of the ribs because the store was out of them, but it still turned out great. I cut up an onion and put the pork on top of that, then poured in about a cup of beef broth and 1/2 of a bottle of beer and cooked it on low for about 8 hours. I drained the juices and put the pork back in the crock pot with a bottle of BBQ sauce and let it cook for another hr or so. By that time I barely needed to shred the pork and it was perfect.

This was very easy and tasted great. I used bone-in pork ribs because that is what I had on hand. Make sure you put it in the oven as directed, that makes a huge difference!

Very very good. I used Bone Suckin Sauce with this and used the broiler to burn the tips of the pork a little bit and I used a Boston Butt portion of the pig. Excellent!

I loved this. This was ten times simpler and just as good as the recipe that I usually use. I followed other user suggestions and added onion and a can of beer to the crock pot. We used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce. Delicious.

This was so easy and very good! I used a 4lb roast and cooked it in the slow cooker for 6 hrs. The meat was so easy to shred, it pretty much fell apart when I took it out of the cooker. This is definitely a keeper!

This recipe is so easy and so delicious!  I'm not that creative in the kitchen, and I was a little intimidated about separating the meat from the fat and the bone (I followed an earlier suggestion of buying meat on the bone because it's cheaper), but it was so easy!  I put it in the crockpot for two hours on high and 6 hours on low, and the meat just fell off the bone.  The "pulling" part took way less time than I expected.  I love BBQ sandwiches, and I couldn't wait to taste a little before my husband got home.  It's out of this world!  I'm serving it tonight with Hidden Valley Ranch potatoes and green beans. I will definitely make this again for just the two of us, and I can't wait to make it for a crowd.

I'm on the same page as ginger with this recipe. Pork butt is a much cheaper cut of meat and it's tender as all get out with bone in. I use pork butt for any pulled pork recipe including this one.

So easy, and an endless variety of options to tweak it. I followed the recipe, except I did buy a cheaper cut. Got a 4 lb. shoulder roast, bone in. Shredded beautifully after 4 hours in the crock pot. Did the oven thing as stated-nicely done. Next time I'll try beer and then cola. Also I will vary the BBQ sauce-the one I used had a guy's pic on it and it said, "My life is in these bottles," but I forget what it was called. I'd say the flavor was okay, though my picky husband and 12 yr old daughter raved about it. I think there are ways to make it more flavorful, but I wouldn't want it to be spicy. So I'll play around. Our family of 5 ate all 4 lbs. in 2 days.

I used a picnic pork roast and it came out great!  This was such an easy recipe that you can change up according to your taste.  I used Sweet Baby Rays and this came out awesome!  Will make again.

I definitely changed this one up a bit, but it gets 5 stars none-the-less because it was so amazing. I agree, a cheap cut of pork works great for this.  I uses about a quart of beef stock as I wanted some to freeze for later cooking. I cooked it for about 7 hours, then added about 1/2 tablespoon of crushed garlic and 1/8 tsp liquid smoke. I let it simmer for another 1/2 hour. I served pulled pork sandwiches with bbq sauce on the side right away then saved the rest for enchiladas the next day. This is a great versatile recipe!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for and it turned out perfect!  It is a family favorite and now a staple dinner for us.  I froze the leftovers and it warms up terrific for a quick meal.  I buy the meat in about 7lb packages and make 2 batches.  It makes several meals for our family of four.

Outstanding! I made the bbq sauce from the recipe "Scott Hibb's Amazing Whiskey Grilled Baby Back Ribs" on Allrecipes for the sandwiches and I have never been more impressed.

Delicious! This was the best bbq pork ever! In the crock pot i put 1 sliced onion and a heaping tbl spoon of chopped garlic. Also, i spent a good 30 mins cutting all the fat off of the pork ribs before i put them in the crock pot. This way, nobody got a chunk of fat in their sandwich. 5 stars for sure!

Great recipe! I agree with a lot of reviewers that Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce is far better than any other bottle version I've tried! I'll never go back to any other brand!

Excellent! The only change I made to the recipe was to use a packet of Onion Soup mix instead of the beef broth. This keeps things from getting too "wet". Thanks for the recipe!

Very good and very easy.  There is no need to use an expensive cut of pork like tenderloin or boneless chops.  Use a pork roast or boston butt.  I used veggie broth and Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.

I've been using allrecipes.com for a years & have found so many wonderful recipes here!  This is the first time I'm rating something, though (I just now signed up to be a member so I can save recipes I want to try).  I'm not much of a writer, but I must say---this recipe is very easy & yummy.  The only thing that takes time (and not much of it) is shredding the pork.  This dish is one of my family's favorites.

I am not a fan of slow cooking, but I decided to pull out my 1970's slow cooker ( what goes around comes around!) and try this recipe. It was great. I added some onion  and beer to the liquid and then refridgerated the meat overnight before slicing and putting back in the slow cooker for it's final baptism in BBQ sauce. It sliced beautifully into nice big chunks and my daughter and her family gave it a thumbs up!

Simple, easy and yummy.  I love having dinner ready when I get home and this is one of those recipes that is easy for a busy mom to throw in the crock pot in the morning and feed a hungry family the instant you come home.  I can't live without these types of recipes.  I did use a pork shoulder instead of the more expensive meat.  Fell apart easily.

This was sooo good!  I used a boneless pork roast instead of the ribs.  I used a hickory flavoured bbq sauce.  One of my kids told me that I'd been holding out on them!!  Will definitely make this again....great idea for potlucks!

AMAZING, AMAZING, AMAZING!  I used a pork shoulder versus ribs.  Cooked in slow cooker on high for 1.5 hours then on low for 6.  Pulled apart nicely!  Used have Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and half Jack Daniels Original BBQ sauce.  Cannot wait to make it again for the Superbowl! (FYI - I used the leftovers for Pork Empanadas, yummm!)

Also used a cheaper cut of meat. Stir in some hot sauce if you like your meat to be a little spicier.

Rather than cooking it on high for 4 hours I cooked it on low for 8.  Worked out well, pork was moist and shredding it was a piece of cake.  Instead of using store bought sauce I made it with Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Back Ribs sauce that I also found on this site.

Amazing, I took the advice of a viewer and cooked the pork butt in the slow cooker for 10 hours and then  it shredded so nicely. I added the BBQ sauce and it was amazing!

This was EXCELLENT!  By mistake my husband brought home boneless short ribs but WOW, when I took out of the crockpot to shred they tasted incredible, almost didn't want to add bbq sauce but I added Rudy's bbq sauce for my husband and Sweet baby Rays for me and left in the oven for about 25' and the sandwiches were fabulous!  Oh I rubbed salt and pepper on the ribs before putting into the crockpot.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Its not that good.  Although it was very easy it just isn't that good, Especially if you can make a BBQ rub, which isn't that hard.  My husband, a very good eater, would not even finish one sandwich.

This is the real deal here folks!  I used pork shoulder and cooked in the crockpot for 6 hrs, its was so easy to shred I couldn't believe it.  I then put the pork in the fridge over night.  Mixed the bbq sause and baked in the oven.  Oh I used Sweet Baby Ray's sause and soft rolls.  AWESOME!

This is the best and easiest pulled pork recipe I have ever used/seen.  It is so easy to make for potlucks or large gatherings and I always get the best compliments.  I also buy pork butt/shoulder when on sale.  And I use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

This recipe is awesome!!!!  After the meat cooked for 4 hours I shredded it, drained the juice from the crock pot and put it back in the crock pot with the bbq sauce for 30 minutes on high.  We made sandwiches with some raw onion.  Very very good!

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner but tripled the recipe and used my large electric roaster.  It turned out GREAT!  I loved how easy it was and my mom loved how great her house smelled.  (And everyone else loved a yummy meal without having to cook.)

This was delicious.  I made a couple changes though.  I used a 7lb pork shoulder (only cost $10) and put it in the slow cooker with the broth overnight.  I cooked it for 11 hours and came out with the most delicious pork...and it fell right off the bone and shredded with ease.

Very yummy.  We did adapt slightly by adding a few more seasonings in the crockpot- minced garlic, onion powder and basil to taste.  It was absolutely delicious and heated up well also.  Plus the added bonus that it was very easy to make.  We will definitely be making this again.

A very simple and delicious recipe, but a little salty so I made a little adjustment. I skipped the beef broth and instead used apple juice; I also added chopped celery, onion and bell pepper in with the apple juice to add a little extra flavor. It was very tasty :)

This recipe was easy to put together.  The broth was really thin at the end of cooking, so I opened the lid and cooked on high for 1/2 hr to thicken it up.  Tasty sandwiches.

This turned out better than a restaurant! After reading the reviews, I used a rump roast, about 4 pounds or so. I used one can of beer, and a little water (1/4 cup or so), and put salt and pepper on the outside of the meat, and let it cook on LOW for 8 hours. Once it was done, I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce for the first time based on some suggestions... it was absolutely wonderful!

I made this recipe but I cooked in on low for a much longer period of time. The meat is much easier to shred when cooked with this method.

I tryed this recipe for my son who is so picky It's hard to find meals that he likes. He actually asked for seconds and it was so easy to prepare. I used "Sweet baby Ray's" barbeque sauce and it was delicious! Thanks, Barbie  p.s.  it sounds like Im speaking of a little boy but my son is a sophmore in college LOL

Absolutely awesome!! I followed the advice of other reviewers and bought a 4 lb. pork butt. Th meat turned out great and cost under $4.00. I followed the recipe only adding a little chopped onion for flavor and about 1/2 can of beer to help tenderlize the meat. I am making this for dinner tonight, my boyfriend and I just sampled the meat and it is sooo good! I recommend trying this recipe and I know I will be making it again!!

My husband is from Georgia - he's a BBQ fanatic.  He described this pork as "divine".  I chose Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce - I know my husband prefers a more vinegar-based sauce, but it's all I had.  Even still, the pork was fantastic.  Left overs were just as wonderful the next day, right out of the fridge.  By the way, I used 2 pounds of bone-in baby back ribs.  That's all my butcher had, but it worked out beautifully.

Added 2 tbs vinager to the beef broth, as we like vinager based bbq and followed the suggestion to leave the meat in the crock pot and thicken the sauce by removing lid and cooking on low for a couple hours.  Great for those with little time who want to serve a "real" meal at suppertime :)

this is an excellent, simple recipe, and once you find your go-to bbq sauce recipe or brand this will be an all time favorite. i personally like these sandwiches best served cold but are delicious either way.

Wowser! Only differences were I used a Honey BBQ Sauce and Country Style ribs that were steamed over a rack in an electric skillet to an internal temp of 160 in less than an hour. After shredding, pork was put into the slow cooker w/broth while side dishes were prepared. Went great with "Anytime Fruit Salad" as a wonderful taste contrast.

I followed the recipe exactly but used a pork shoulder (butt) roast and seasoned my roast with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Cooked it on low for 10 hrs and it was very easy to shred and pick out the fat.  Used Sweet Baby Rays and loved the flavor. Husband gave it 4 stars because putting it in the oven for 30 minutes dried it out a bit.  Good thing we had an extra bottle of bbq sauce to make it less dry.  I would definitely make it again.

Delicious! Make sure you pull all the fat off the ribs, which is kind of a pain, but worth it. Yummy! I didn't have any beef broth so I used a can of beef gravy and 3 seasoning packets from beef flavored ramen noodles (I know, ghetto) and water. Turned out perfect and my husband LOVED it!

Awesome… ridiculously easy recipe. Took advise of others and used a pork butt; a six pounder fills the Crockpot and made 16-18 good sized sandwiches-great on Bulky Rolls. Used enough broth to cover and added a beer and some brown sugar to the mix.  Two barbecued thumbs up on this one.

Great recipe!  I ended up using pork butt and some boneless ribs I found at the last minute.  I also ended up straining off most of the liquid and adding in another bottle of sauce to make it thicker in consistency.

This was certainly very easy!  Although somewhat bland, the meat was tender. As others suggested, I used a pork butt instead of ribs and cooked it on low for about 10 hours. It rendered a LOT of fat. I refrigerated it overnight and easily removed the fat after it hardened.  Instead of bottled, I used a homemade ketchup/vinegar/brown sugar/ground mustard, etc. BBQ sauce recommended by a previous reviewer.  Maybe the bottled would have been better.  I wound up having to do a lot of adding/adjusting of ingredients to get the taste right.  I had to thicken the sauce a bit with about 1/4 c. of instant potatoes.  This was also probably the result of my using the butt roast instead of ribs.  All in all, this is a good starter recipe that can be adapted to individual tastes.

The best.  The only thing I changed was that I added a bottle of beer I had in the fridge.  I cooked this in the crock one day, shredded and refrigerated until the next day.  I knew by how tender it was when it shredded that it was going to be a keeper.  Plus, it tasted great even before the bbq sauce.  Served with a cole slaw recipe from this site.  Great, EASY dinner.  Thank you!

Had these ready for trick or treat night and they were great. They were so easy. I used more BBQ sauce than called for because it was really absorbed in the meat.  I also used a pork shoulder roast and it worked fine.

This was awesome and very easy to make.  I followed the suggestions of some of the other members and cooked a pork shoulder in the crock pot with the beef broth.  Then mixed it with some of the left over cooking liquid and the (sweet and tangy BBQ sauce) recipe from this site the next day and warmed it up in the crock pot on high for about 2 hours.  Again this was very very good and easy to do, this will be a regular addition to my summer menu.

Great recipe- only thing I changed was I didn't use the oven I just put it back in the slow cooker on high for about an hour. Turned out good. Next time I will use a BBQ sauce with a little more kick-but thats what I prefer.

So good! I had never heard of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, but it is our new favorite. I did use 1/2 sliced onion and 1/4 cup BBQ sauce while cooking and cooked for 6 hours then used the oven following the rest of the directions. It turned out wonderful, no leftovers.

This is the first time I have ever made barbecue and my third time using my slow cooker. Definitely the best slow cooker recipe I have tried to far and super easy. We had dinner for 4 and I had enough for lunch for several days using a 4 lbs pork butt. Thanks!

This was DELICIOUS!!  My whole family loved it!  And it was incredibly easy.  I couldn't get pork ribs at the grocery store so I used a pork roast instead.  Instead of cooking on high for 4 hours, I set it to low all day because I wasn't going to be home until supper and it turned out great!  I will certainly be making this frequently!

Turned out really great!  Will make again!  I cooked the meat overnight and then ran out of time in the morning to shred it so I think having it cool in the fridge made it tougher to shred.  It was a little too salty as well.  Very yummy though.

I think if I lived anywhere else in the country, I would've appreciated this more. But being in North Carolina, we're used to a more vinegar-based sauce. This was still really good! Not what I was looking for, but really good, and super easy.

Really good. I just left the lid off the crock pot for the last hour, instead of transferring to the oven. I'm lazy.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  I used a can of beer in place of broth.  I would probably not do that again.  I also left it in the oven a little too long.  But over all my family liked it and it was easy.

The reviews are right.  This is a simple and wonderful recipe.  We fixed 100 lbs. for our son’s wedding and the guests gobbled it up.  I already had pork loins, bought pork butt to go with them and used cooking bags in the oven to help speed the time up.  Next time I will use all pork butts as the recipe calls for.  Thanks KMB233, this is a keeper for sure

This was absolutely delicious! I used a pork roast because it was cheaper and shredded so easily when it was done. It made my job easier. I seasoned it a little with garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. We used Bull's Eye BBQ sauce and these sandwiches were amazing! This is my Husband's new favorite.

This was ridiculously easy! I put a pork loin roast in the slow cooker for 10 hours on low in the beef broth. Then I made my own BBQ sauce. When the pork was done, it was falling apart. Shredding not even necessary!

Wow!!!!  Really wow!!  This is one of the best recipes I've made in the crockpot...not just in the crockpot, maybe ever.  This was fantastic! Made my own sauce for it from this site (Big Al's), made some creamy coleslaw, and served it up. Absolutely wonderful!

I made this for friends and family...so good!!! I used Dr. Pepper instead of beef broth, seasoned the ribs, and slow cooked 10 hours low, then added Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce and simmered LOW for 2 hours. I think I may  try oven next time instead of low simmer, meat was a little mushy...but still GOOD!

This is a wonderful, easy recipe. Virtually impossible to screw it up, unless you forget it in the crock pot. It's so simple and filling. I followed the recipe exactly and my only regret is that I didn't make two pounds of it for later lunches and snacks.

I followed this recipe exactly, with the exception that Pork Butt Roast was on sale, so I used that instead. It was absolutely delicious and it made so much we were able to eat this for a couple of days after. Excellent Recipe.

This was awesome! I had a large Boston butt that I had to cut in half to fit in my slow cooker. I ended up slow cooking half and cooking the other half in the oven (200 for 3 hours) and couldn't tell the difference between the two. I did include one cut up onion and a can of beer with the half of butt I slow cooked. I then mixed both together and with Sweet Baby Ray's and cooked in the oven. I really think this last step is necessary. It makes it seem more like pork that's been grilled or smoked and then barbecued.

This was so easy and very good!! I did change one thing like others, I used 6 lbs of pork shoulder and cooked it for about 8 hours in the crock pot. But then followed the rest of the recipe! Sweet Rays was perfect! I will definitely make this again!

VERY GOOD AND INEXPENSIVE! I WANTED TO TRY THIS BUT WAS LOW ON FUNDS SO I BOUGHT A 2 LB PORK ROAST FOR LESS THAN 5 BUCKS.  DIDNT BOTHER WITH THE BEEF BROTH BECAUSE I DIDNT HAVE ANY.  IT WAS GREAT WITH JUST WATER AND WAS DEVOURED, SERVED WITH BAKED BEANS AND POTATO SALAD. I WILL TRY IT AGAIN WITH BEEF BROTH

Super easy and way cheaper than buying pre-made shredded pork. This recipe is great as-is, but could also be a great base to add other things/flavors.

Super easy recipe.  I followed others suggestion and used pork shoulder instead of the more expensive cut called for in the recipe.  I threw in an onion and cooked on 4 hr HI, 2 hr LO, the refrigerated for 2 hrs and finished off in a dutch oven per the recipe.  My whole family loved it - my daughter said it was "Awesome".  I usually like my pork w/ more texture, so next time i'll stick to the 4 hrs.  This recipe will be a keeper!

Excellent. Very tender, very good! I used a pork loin and it turned out great.

This is very tasty and easy to make. I used a less expensive piece and spent extra time removing the fat. I will use a leaner cut next time.

this was so good. I added a diced onion and a diced green pepper to the slow cooker, cooked on low for 6 hours, drained, shredded the pork, added the bbq sauce (i used famous daves rich and sassy), let it sit in the fridge for two hours, then put it in the oven. i noticed that a lot of reviewers said they just put it back in the slow cooker after adding the bbq sauce. i'm sure that's still good, but i thought the oven really did wonders for the texture (i've noticed that slow cooker pulled pork is mushy sometimes, and this was anything but).

Tried this recipe the other night in the crockpot and it came out very tasty (with alterations)! My guyfriend even said this sandwich tasted better than what he might find at a restaurant. Nice compliment. :) Super-easy to make too!  I used pork butt (1.6 lbs.) and trimmed the fat before placing it in the crockpot along with approx. 1/2 can of beef broth, a few ounces of beer (1554 black ale), a smidgen of french onion soup dry mix, and a few sprinkles of garlic powder. For BBQ sauce, I used Famous Dave's Sweet & Zesty.   Made the perfect amount for 4-5 hoagie buns. I did finish cooking it in the oven and felt this improved the texture.   Thanks for the recipe! I never even realized I liked pulled pork sandwiches, but this convinced me. :)

So easy and delicious.  Baking the pork once the sauced is added makes all the difference in the world. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and made some tangy coleslaw to go with it.  Great dinner, thanks for submitting this recipe.

Excellent recipe, thank you.  I also recommend using a less expensive cut (i.e. pork butt)- nobody will ever be able to tell the difference!

Yummmmm! I made this for dinner and had leftovers for lunch. I love this recipe. I made it for my family when they came over and they loved it so much my mom and sister wanted the recipe. I have passed it on to them and a friend. It is now a staple for all of us! And a plus, the house smells sooooo yummy when I'm making this

The recipe was very easy and good which gives it a 5 * for me!  I am a sucker for smoked meat so I will add liquid smoke next time.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's, very tender!

This is fantastic! I listened to the previous suggestions and used a cheaper cut (only $1.59/#)! I used 2.5 lbs of meat and 16 oz. of broth, and cooked in crock-pot for 6 hrs on low. Then I shredded the meat (very tender and easy), and to keep the heat out of my kitchen in the summer, I mixed in the 1/2 jar of BBQ sauce and returned to the slow cooker for another 45 min. Turned out great, and everyone raved about it!

I got rave reviews on this.  I made this in a crockpot during vacation using 3 lbs pork roast (not tenderloin), due to kitchen restrictions I did not transfer to a cast iron skillet I just put it back in the crockpot, it was delicious but I will try the oven next time!

Excellent... Really no need to change the recipe at all! Sometimes boneless pork ribs are hard to find, but any kind of pork roast can be used (I find boneless pork ribs do come the best though).

I followed this recipe exactly (aside from using a trimmed butt roast) and it is absolutely perfect as is. DO NOT SKIP THE OVEN STEP! It is worth the extra dirty dish. The oven baking gives it a BBQ-like crispness that you can't get in the CP and it bakes in the flavour of the BBQ sauce. I want to try this with chicken and beef also, just for a different taste, but I'm sure it will be equally tasty and wonderful!

We have made this twice for parties at our home and because of its simplicity it was manageable with all the other dishes we served. We scaled the recipe up for serving forty people and there was hardly a scoop left. We used KC Masterpiece Original sauce.  I would have used something spicier for myself but not all our guest like heat. Great party dish!

After slow cooking for 8 hours on low heat, I shredded the pork and used salt & pepper to taste. I then stirred in the sauce and baked for about 20 min. My hubby ate it right up! Great recipe!

i season the pork w/ some salt, pepper, onion power, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, and paprika before i stick it in the crock pot w/ the broth. i've cooked this for 4 hrs and 10 hrs before and prefer the 4 hr version because it has more texture where the 10 hr is more mushy. lastly, i top the burger w/ coleslaw before i devour.

This was hands down one of the best Pulled Pork sandwich I have ever had. However, I was really disappointed with how the leftovers tasted the next day... honestly they tasted mediocre at best so when you make this I would really recommend not leaving any leftovers.

This was a big hit! Used the suggestion of beer, onion and some barbecue sauce in the slow cooker.  Used Sweet Baby Rays sauce. Used slider size buns for the kids. Definately a keeper.

This really depends greatly on using an awesome bbq sauce, so choose wisely! I loved the Jack's Smokehouse we used - delicious in a sandwich or over white rice.

Everybody gobbled this up. I used my hands to shread the pork, b/c it cooled to much. It was easier that way. Used Sweet Baby Ray's. Can't wait to make again.

Very good! I have made BBQ pork before and it took a very long time and was a lot of work. This recipe tasted just as great, and was so much simpler! I used a 2.5 lb shoulder, and cooked it on low for four hours and then on high for another two. Used the full bottle of BBQ sauce and it was excellent!   Next time I think I will skip the oven part though. It seemed to overcook the meat a little.

The concept of the recipe is good, I listened to other reviewers and bought a 4 pound pork butt, it wsa way to fatty and the pork lacked something. Family thought next time we should add liquid smoke.

This is great, but I use boneless butt and my personal Cajun BBQ recipe and serve on buns with dill pickles.  I have been selling my bbq sauce for thrity five years. The firehouse in Pompano Beach was a good customer of mine until I moved to TX.  At all of our patio parties, I serve it.

I also used beer instead of broth. These were good, but the meat was a little mushy.. I will try this again and cook it for a shorter amount of time

This is a keeper. Although there is nothing special about this BBQ Pork, it is traditional and the reason I gave it a 5 star was for the ease. I like that you can cook this is a slow cooker and the few minutes in the oven browns it up nicely. You really need a good "homemade" BBQ sauce most of the store baught sauces are too artificial tasting.

So easy and sooooo yummy! I cooked a pork loin in the slow cooker on low for 8 hours, then transferred to the oven with a bottle of "Saltgrass Original BBQ Sauce" (I think this might be only sold locally though in the central Texas area). Absolutely delicious, thanks for the recipe. The beef broth was an awesome idea! I'll be cooking this again and again!

This was great ! I had 3 1/2 lbs of boneless rib, cut them into 1/2's, added the broth, 2 tbps of hickory smoke flavored marinade, a cup of water &  1 beef bullion cube. Slow cooked in crockpot for 4 hrs. After shredding, I drained & put pork into a cast iron pot on stove top, added a bottle of vinegar based BBQ sauce & a few dashes of cayenne pepper. (E. Carolina style BBQ)Simmered for 1 hr, stirring about each 15 minutes. Great recipe. We served with cole slaw on buns with chips. Just my wife & I, froze the remainder in qt size freezer bags.

The only changes I made were adding a can of beer and I cooked it for 3 hours on low, then 2 hours on high and then another 3 hours on low.  The meat was so tender that I had no trouble shredding it.  I think the recipe could use more BBQ sauce, but that's just personal taste.  Delicious!

This totally fixed my prior problems with pork sandwiches.  It is a brilliant plan to add the sauce right toward the end.  These were moist and delicous on onion buns with chips.

I wanted something basic so I could cook up that stray "seasoned" pork loin that a family member had given me. I used my own beef broth(to cut down on salt) and I also added pepper and garlic/onion powder when I cooked the beef in the oven. I plan on serving it on hamburger buns with coleslaw on top. Super easy.

Didn't like this one too much. Overcooked the port, so it was mushy. Bottled BBQ sauce was too sweet. Just go with the sloppy joes.

Very easy and very tasty. I used a bottle and a half of Sam Adams instead of beef broth. Used Sweet Baby Rays as my bbq sauce and pork tenderloin as my cut. Tasted better than my aunts' cooking, will definitely make again.

I disagree with other posters, use a good cut of pork. I have tried it with pork shoulder & butt and it just doesn't turn out right. I think those cuts have a bitter..gross tasting flavor. I always get the bone in or boneless country style pork ribs and it turns out great! I love Ray's Own BBQ sauce over anything else. My advice is to not substitute a thing, this is the best recipe as is!

I followed the recipe exactly as is because I'm an inexperienced cook and it was amazing (although I did buy pork butt because I couldn't find boneless ribs)! Its easy and fun to make! Great with beans and coleslaw!

This turned out amazing! Laid down 1/2 an onion on the bottom of the crock pot. put in my seasoned pork shoulder (garlic powder, a little brown sugar, and salt), then added a 12 oz. beer and a little bit of water, cooked it for about 10 hours...it fell right apart! Cooked in our casket iron skillet in oven with one bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's hickory brown sugar BBQ sauce, and enjoyed for 3 days straight! Definitely a keeper!!

Do not substitute a lower cut of meat like some have suggested.  This recipe is perfect with the boneless rib meat.  I tried the shoulder as some said would turn out as good. HOGWASH!! People advocating a lesser cut may have weaker taste buds.  Even my kids could tell the difference.  I used the same exact recipe as always with one change, the shoulder cut.  Which by the way yielded much less meat and more fat with bones.  So it could have cost about the same or even more per pound.  Also, unless you like the smell of pork bones simmering in your house please don't do this!

This dish was seriously delicious.  I cooked a shoulder of pork in the slow cooker with beer as the liquid then shredded it and then mixed in a jack daniels barbecue sauce(going to try my own sauce next time) popped in the oven to crisp the edges a bit.  Everyone couldnt get enough i did it again and even left over cold bits were fantastic my husband just kept going in the fridge and getting bits to nibble.  Fabulous dish for a barbecue with friends goes a long way.

This was really good- I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and it turned out perfectly tender.  I was in a hurry and didn't want to go the whole dutch oven route, but definitely wanted a little crispiness so I just threw it into a ceramic casserole dish and baked that way.  Turned out well and still crunched up the sauce nicely.

So so EASY!  Followed recipe exactly and used recipe for BBQ sauce here at allrecipes.com :  Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce.  I only wished I had made more so next time I doubled the recipe.  then the 3rd time I used frozen pork and only cooked it 2 hours more.    Love it, love it, LOVE it!     BUT you HAVE to make the Big Al's sauce at least the day before if not a week or more before...it gets better with time!

So Easy.  I added 1.5 cans of beer and a bottle of bbq sauce while cooking, and then added more bbq sauce when I mixed it together and baked for 30 minutes.  My hubby loved it!

My favorite way to prepare this is with a picnic/butt cut of pork. After I shred the meat, I toss the meat back in the slow cooker (liquid poured out), add Stubb’s barbecue sauce (1/2 mesquite, 1/2 spicy), and cook on low until heated through. Excellent with some chips and restaurant-style (AR) coleslaw. Thank you, KMB233!

Oh my gosh!!!this was sooo yummy!It reminded me of a BBQ place we used to go to in college. I didn't have any beef broth so I used 1 can of beer just like someone else had mentioned. Super great flavor! top it off with your favorite BBQ sauce..and you have yourself  one heck of a great dinner!

Cooked this for Sunday dinner, it turned out well. I did not exactly follow the recipe as specified. I used a 5lb boneless pork shoulder instead of the ribs. Created a spice rub of garlic powder, onion powder, dried mustard, brown sugar, cayenne pepper, black pepper and kosher salt (about 2T each). Coated all sides of the meat and browned in a cast iron skillet before adding to the crockpot.  Added 2 chopped onions and 4 cloves of garlic to the bottom of the pot before adding the meat. I thought 4 cups of beef stock was to much, used only 3 cups with a couple of dashes of worcestershire sauce and liquid smoke. Cooked for 6 hours on low. Meat easily pulled apart with forks but I that it was too wet. Added 2 bottles of Jack Daniels Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ Sauce along with some a couple dashes of hot peper sauce, cayenne pepper and 1/2 cup of cooking liquid . Baked cover in a ceramic dish for 30 mins, removed lid and stirred meat to get more crispy piece. Put back in the stove for 20 mins uncovered. Family really liked it. Made plenty for leftovers, even froze a container full for a future date. Well use again with my additions.

Really great taste!  I used a pork roast & probably a little more BBQ sauce (KC Masterpiece). Husband might like more before cooked in the oven.

I absolutely love this recipe for pulled pork sandwiches.  It's SO simple to make, and tastes SO delicious with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  Everyone who has tried it has loved it, and I've given my family this recipe, too!

So easy, SO tasty.  I used to go thru all the steps and make my own sauce, etc.  I cannot believe that this recipe actually tasted better than my far more labor intensive version.  I used pork roast and followed recipe exact.  I had forgotten to put the roast in early in the morning, so I had to cook it on HIGH for 6 hours in order to have dinner at a reasonable time.  Well...it was so tender and delicious.  I can't remember which BBQ sauce I used...but it was a honey sweet version since my kids won't eat spicey.  So delicious on whole wheat buns!  Thanks!

I have to agree with the masses. So good! I wish people would say what kind of sauce they used, cause that makes or breaks this dish. I used pork shoulder butt roast, and used half Presidents choice smokin' habanero sauce and half bullseye original. I also added a couple squeezes of honey.

So simple and so so delicious. I have made this recipe at least a dozen times already. I do add about 6 chopped cloves of garlic and two thinly sliced onions which caramelize nicely in the slow cooker. With or with out these modifications you can't go wrong with this recipe.

This is a tried and true never fails crowd pleaser.  Great for the big game.  If your rooting for the Steelers this weekend then you have to put a Pennsylvania twist on this recipe.  Use Yuengling Lager BBQ sauce and a bottle of Yuengling Lager.  I know Wegman's has the sauce but buy the beer at your local distributor.  Serve it on a pretzel roll with slaw.  I also recommend using a slow cooker liner to make cleanup a little easier.

This is great, and very simple.  I've made it by transfering the pork into a pan and mixing in the sauce and then baking, and I've also just put the sauce in the crockpot with the pork and turned up the heat for about an hour.  Either way works well and tastes great.  I've used boston butts and tenderloins when on sale, either is fine for this recipe. Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ is the best!

i made this recipe only because it was so easy and only needed 3 ingredients. i thought it can't be that bad, to my surprise it was incredible!!  i love BBQ sandwiches but don't like to pay $3-4 dollars for one sandwich at food places.  with only $2 worth of pork (it was on sale) we made 5 sandwiches. the only thing i did different was after pulling the pork from the crock pot i added it to a sauce pan with a little hot sauce and BBQ sauce and heated it up on the top burners, (i was in a rush, and i had some hungry people waiting). my only regret was that i didn't make more.  can't wait to make it again for company that is coming from out of town, gonna make tons!!

This recipe is delicious.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed.  I took the suggestion to use beer instead of beef broth.  The meat was so tender.  I will definately make this many more times.

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  It turned out really well and it was really easy to make in the crock pot.  I think next time I will choose a cheaper cut of meat because it didn't make as much as I expected and was somewhat expensive with the boneless pork ribs.  I might also add more barbecue sauce after it is done cooking.

This recipe is amazing and SUPER EASY! The first time I tried it I couldn't believe that with so little effort I could get such a delicious meal. I used our favorite bottled barbecue sauce, "Sweet Baby Ray's," and it turned out great! I have made this recipe over and over and it has never failed me.

My family loved this. I cooked overnight in the crockpot (woke up about 3 am to a wonderful smell). Shred in the morning, cover in bbq sauce with some of the beef broth mixed in. Put in fridge. Transfered back to crock pot two hrs. prior to eathing. To DIE for! We will be making this again, and again, and... well you get the point!

It was good, I need to find a better BBQ sauce.  It was very simple and made an easy quick meal before I went to work.  Will do again.

Can't really add anything, except that this is so easy, and so good.  It is my standard recipe for BBQ now.  I'm glad I found this.

I made this exactly how the recipe instructed - using the cheapest pork I could find.  Everyone loved it!  I toasted some buns under the broiler, piled the meat on, and we dug in.  I just got a crockpot and this was the first recipe I tried in it.  It might be the only recipe I need!  Thanks!

I've made this twice now and it's awesome, my whole family enjoyed it! I used boneless pork shoulder, sprinkled it with Lawrys seasoning salt, added some garlic cloves and sliced onions in the crockpot. Once done, I added coleslaw inside the sandwich and it was delicious.

I needed a last minute dish for a party and could not get to town I had a 6# pork shoulder on hand and substitued for the ribs. The meat was absolutely the best I have fixed in 40 years that was before I put it in bbq sauce we live in alabama so Sweet Baby Rays is the sauce if you like it sweet I put some onion in  the little chopper and sauteed them in the micro a few minutes  and this was to die for.

wasnt bad but with the slow cook time I used I should have rubbed the meat and cranked up my Big Green Egg and threw in a couple of handfuls of hickory chips = a much more flavorful meat.Love sweet baby rays sauce for a red ,but try a western North Carolina vinegar based sauce found on this site from Doug.

I don't eat - and therefore don't cook - pork, but I decided to make this for a Holiday party.  It was ridiculously easy and according to all my guest, simply delicious! Everyone asked for (1) the recipe, and (2) if they could have the leftovers!  Thank you.  This one is a keeper.

Definitely need to bake for the last 30 min -- makes it awesome!  I cooked a 3 lb. shoulder with a can of beef broth, maybe 8 oz of beer, some minced dried onion, and onion salt for 10 hrs. then pulled the pork and stored in the fridge until the next day when I topped with bbq (Sweet Baby Ray's), and baked for 30 min.  So good on buns with provolone cheese and a slice of pineapple!

Great basic recipe.  Because we had some friends who keep Kosher joining us for dinner, I used a bottom round roast instead of the boneless pork ribs.  I created a dry rub for the meat using garlic salt, dried parsley, dried oregano, dried thyme, and black pepper.  I coated the outside of the meat with the dry rub and let it sit overnight.  In the morning, I seared the meat on all sides and then put it in the slow cooker and followed this recipe.  It was delicious!  Can't wait to hit those leftovers!

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could!  I can't even tell you the number of people who have asked me for it!  Use Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and you won't be disappointed!  I always use a few spoonfulls of the left over broth mixed in with the shredded meat for added moisture.  This pork is awesome on sandwiches, potatoes or just by itself!!  It doesn't get much easier or delicious than this!

We have made this 3 time in the last month.SO great! The key is to make sure you let it cook long enough. You will know when it is done when it is really easy to pull the meat off the bone! Definitely throw it in the oven of a little while. Best recipes off this site so far! (and we have had alot of good ones!)

I have made this several times and it's great for times when you are feeding a larger amount of people or when you have time constraints. I use boneless pork ribs, as it suggests and Trader Joe's spicy BBQ sauce. Don't omit the oven step, it's crucial if you want a great flavor and texture. I always side mine with coleslaw and my husband loves it. He requests if often.

So delicious. I used 1/2 bottle of beer and a can of beef broth.  Used CHEAP meat - whatever was on sale - pork butt and shoulder.  I just removed the fat before shredding the meat at the end.  I added almost a whole bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and heated a little longer.  Freezes perfectly! I will make this again for sure!

This recipe was delicious!  The only thing I did differently was cook it for 10 hours on low (while I was at work).  I've cooked it twice (in one week) and used a different type of bbq sauce each time.  The first time I used Kraft Hickory BBQ sauce - I really liked that because it was not as sweet.  The second time I used Sweet Baby Rays - this was also very good but gave the BBQ a much sweeter taste.  I served it on toasted hamburger buns with homemade sweet and spicy coleslaw and corn on the cob for sides.  Yummy!  Oh, I also agree that you should not skip putting it in the oven.  I stirred it every 10 minutes.

This was good and I don't think you could find a recipe any easier.  I didn't transfer it to the oven b/c I thought that may dry it out so I just cooked it in the crockpot for about 5 hours.  I used Sweet Baby Rays bbq sauce and it came out very tender and moist.  While this was good and easy, it tastes JUST like a pulled pork sandwich from any restaurant....no better, no worse.  I will definitely make it again though.

Thanks! SOOO easy and very yummy! 
I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (since most reviewers say to try it)and it has no soy in it (my son is allergic to soy) and it was YUMM! 
Will make again :)

This was really, really tasty! I took another reviewer's suggestion (since I don't have a crockpot yet) and baked it in a 325 degree oven for 3 1/2 hours, then drained it and pulled it apart. I smothered it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce (since most reviewers say to try it) and put it back in the oven for another 20 minutes. Loved the sauce, and loved how easy this recipe was!

Wow!  The only change I made was adding smoked paprika to the ribs before placing them in the crock pot.  Sensational flavor!  I recommend baking in cast iron as the recipe suggests - gives the dish that nice crunchy crusty texture.  Can't wait to make this again.

To be perfectly honest, this is some of the easiest, best BBQ pork I have ever made or had! It seems like magic how you can just put two ingredients in and come back to find BBQ pork that shreds so easily and tastes amazing! I usually do not put the pork in the oven like the recipe suggests, and this is still very yummy!

So simple you almost don't need the recipe. Still this turned out perfectly. I used a combination of pork and beef brisket and I really liked the combination of textures.

This recipe is simple delicious. I used a 2.5 lb. pork roast and followed the rest of the directions exactly. The results were  very moist and yummy sandwiches which will be a regular part of my menu. Thanks for sharing!

My family really liked this recipe.  You can really make this recipe stretch too if you use a pork roast. I removed the fat as I was shredding the roast. I am not much of a pork fan but I gave it 5 stars from the reviews my family gave it!

This is a great basic recipe.  Just throw in the beef broth and forget it.  I didn't have a chance to put it in the oven, which I'm sure would have been even better with the carmelization.  However, the meat was so tender, that I just added the BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) and it was great.  At first, I thought there was too much liquid, but I served it over rice and it was awesome.  Next time I will try it with the oven part too.  I used a pork butt for this recipe, but you could probably use anything.... beef, chicken, any cut of pork.  If you are a busy mom (or dad) this is a great timesaver and it makes the house smell great.

This recipe is so easy and excellent.  I used a pork shoulder instead of the ribs which turned out very tender.  I used Big Al's KC BBQ sauce recipe off this site which was also outstanding.  Will make again.

I made this for my family one night for dinner.  My sis is really picky and she loved it (very surprised).  I modified this recipe a lil due to what we had in the house.  I used a 5 pound pork roast and cooked it with 1 can of beef broth and 1 can of water.  I cooked it for 5-6 hours in the crock pot.  Then we added a full bottle of sweet baby rays regular and half bottle of sweet baby rays hot and spicy.  This gave it some flavor.  It was so delicious and gone within a few days!

Although this was a very easy recipe, it doesn't have much flair.  It really tastes like whichever BBQ sauce you use.  So its tasty but not exciting.  Maybe next time I'll use a homemade sauce as others have recommended.

This was great.  I only did 1.5 pounds of ribs and still used the whole bottle of bbq sauce.  It was not too much whatsoever.  I love how you get a lot of the fat out in the crockpot and then finish it off in the oven.  I served with the roasted cajun potatoes on this site (highly recommend) and some roasted corn on the cob.

Awesome recipe.  I used 4.25lb boneless pork ribs with 2 cups broth and cooked it on high 3 hours then low for 2 hours.  Turned out perfectly.  I also made the sauce amethystshells recommended, but I doubled it and used onion powder, added some paprika and simmered it while stirring regularly for 75 minutes.  Everything turned out great.  Thanks for the recipes.

I love this recipe! I took Ginger's advice and I used a pork butt (I have gone as big as 5lbs). When it was done I picked out all of the fat (took less than 10 Minutes) and placed pork in bowl. When I was done I added bbq sauce and mixed it in as I shredded the pork until it tasted terrific & that was it. It could not have been easier.

Awesome...so easy and soooo good.  Made for Father's Day picnic...everyone loved...my ten year old niece ate two big sandwiches!  Added just a little bit of brown sugar to the beef broth and like others, also used pork butt.

I followed the general advice with this and it came out fantastic, made a bunch of it for father's day for my dad. Put about 4 pounds of butt roast in slow cooker at midnight (lots of fat to trim off though) with the broth. Forked it at 10 am with it falling all apart. I do recommend doing the last 30 minutes in the oven, it makes the top nice and crispy and awesome. I used Sweet Baby Ray's for the first time and it is, duh, sweet, so had I realized that I would have went for something more mesquite.

We really liked this recipe!  I had to cook the pork ribs in beer, since we always have beer, not true with the beef broth!  I sprinkled some garlic powder and black pepper in with the beer and ribs. I cooked them 4 hours on low in my crockpot, shredded and baked.  I used a home made bbq sauce recipe from this site, it was a little too sweet, so I may try just bottled next time, since I know what to expect that way.  Maybe in the meantime I will find the perfect bbq for pork sandwiches!

It really all depends on the sauce you use - I think more than the cut of meat. Use your favorite recipe or, if going storebought, the Jack Daniels' brand is delish for this purpose.

Well, I used beef ribs and this was really fabulous. 3# beef country ribs, 1 12 oz. can of beer in my pampered chef covered baker, 350 degrees for 2.5-3 hours.  Broke apart easily with a fork and I let it cool to skim the fat.  Next day I made the sauce by amethystshells, I 1.5 timed the recipe, cooked in on the stovetop for a half hour added to the shredded beef, which still had some of the juice and put in a 350 degree oven with no lid for 45 min.  I will make this again, Thanks!

My husband LOVED this pork. I used a funky colored bbq sauce (kind of orange) so it looked funny.. but he said it tasted great.

I had some deer meat in the freezer I had to cook up, and since I dont eat deer meat I made this up for my husband to take to work for him and the guys at lunch.  It was a HUGE hit! Slow cooking it in the broth just  made the meat so tender and it just fell apart! The guys loved it and my mom tried a sandwich and she raved about it..  Huge hit and very easy to make!

Try it with "Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce" from this website. Seriously, it's incredible.

This is a very easy recipe & tastes great!  We used pork butt & cooked in the slow cooker for 10 hours (with 2 cans of beef broth - I'm always afraid of things being dry), shredded it immediately, added 1 bottle of barbecue sauce and stuck it in the oven at 170 degrees so my very active family could eat in shifts. We all loved it & this will be the only way I make BBQ pork from now on.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I loved this recipe, even though I had a little trouble shredding the pork.  I used the recipe "vinegar based BBQ Sauce" on this site and it was amazing.  I added some extra bottled barbecue sauce and it added another level of richness.  This pork was great and I got amazing reviews from all who tried it. 
EDIT
I tried this recipe again and used 3 bone-in pork but steaks and cooked them on LOW for 8 hours, they literally fell off the bone and I had to scoop them out they were so tender, used a mix of vinegar based BBQ sauce and KC Masterpiece Original bottled BBQ sauce and it turned out great.  Thanks for this recipe!

My husband loved this the second time around. The first batch I messed up because like one of the previous reviewers, I tried the sweet baby ray's sauce because of all the raves, and both my husband and I thought that the taste of it was really messed up. I am also a Southerner, so she may be right about it being a northern thing.

I used an 8lb pork shoulder roast and this was wonderful!  It took almost nine hours for it to fully cook but definitely worth the wait.  My family even had extra servings and I still have enough left over for another meal.

This was very good and so easy to make.  I love using my slow cooker...it makes me feel like I didn't have to work at cooking the evening meal!  I served this to family members who were visiting over Easter and it didn't last long enough for leftovers!  Thanks!

Quick and easy. I used Sweet Baby Rays and added a splash of worcestershire sauce and a little allspice.  Before putting it in the oven I added a diced onion. Thanks for the recipe!

is good but turns out plain until you add the sauce, so the BBQ sauce is the key.

I have made this three times and every time it is perfect!  I used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce.  I used a pork roast because my store didn't have any boneless ribs.  Putting it in the oven tops it off!  Delicious and extremely easy! This recipe is a keeper!!

This was awesome!  My family gobbled it up!  Was very similar to the bbq joint we have in town.  I followed a previous reviewer and added 1 tsp. liquid smoke to the slow cooker.  Next time I may add a little more for a "smokier" taste.  I also used a pork roast, since that's all I had on hand.  Turned out very tender and easy to shred.  We, too , are Sweet Baby Rays fans.  Thanks for the recipe!  It's a keeper!

Okay, this was about as easy as a meal is going to be!  Not only easy, but, good.  Hubby & kids loved it.  I made the Tasty Buns from this site---yummy combo.  And as an extra bonus this cut of meat is usually always marked down, so this is also a VERY economical meal.  Perfect choice to feed a crowd.

Very easy, very good.  My picky eaters loved it.  Next time I'm going to get an extra bottle of barbeque sauce, one wasn't quite enough.  After cooking it for 3 hours I got really nervous when the pork wasn't shredding, but at the end all was well.  I plan to make this again, soon.

I made this for my company and it turned out so tender and I got so many rave reviews.  The nice thing was, I got the ribs on sale and used KC Masterpiece brown sugar bbq sauce and cooked in a slow cooker again with the sauce and it turned out so good and so cheap!  For a lot of people this is the way to go!!

Fantastic.  I made this exactly as listed.   I sent it off with my husband to feed a crowd of guys.  Even though i doubled this not a drop came back.  I served with with cole slaw.  I made it all the night before then put it back into the crock pot the next day for a little while before he took it.  I will make this again and again.  VERY VERY simple.

Super easy and very good.  We used a pork roast as we didn't have ribs and it worked out great.  Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce is a good choice for pork.  We will have it again and again.

This recipe is too simple to be this great! It was the eaisest slow cooked pulled pork I've ever made. The only thing I did different was cook it on low for 10 hours (so it would be ready after I got back from work) and used bone-in country ribs because they were cheaper. This recipe is monkey proof. Anyone can do it, no matter their cooking experience.

Excellent and couldn't be any easier!  I add a little garlic powder and all-spice. I think you can eliminate the step of putting it in the oven, as you can just keep it in the slow cooker for a little while after adding the sauce.  Great for freezing dinner-sized portions!  This is now one of my 'regulars!'

This is delicious.  I have made it several times and even my 8 yr old loves it.  I use more bbq than states and add some garlic pdr to the meat.  Yummy!

This is how I always make mine...soo good!  I highly recommend using Sweet Baby Ray's brand BBQ Sauce of any variety.  I always get comments on it!  I also top the pork off with french fried onions.

I tried this after my parents insisted on it after seeing it on allrecipes.com.  It was super easy and a great dinner.  Would like to try it with different styles of bbq sauce to get different tastes!

I have been looking at this recipe for ages, and never got enough courage to try it until last night.  I made it for a holiday potluck, everyone LOVED it.  I used Famous Daves Sweet and Zesty BBQ sauce, and needed 2 bottles.  Thank you for such a great recipe!!!

WOW!  Awesome -- I didn't have time  to cook it in a slow cooker, so I just did it in a large cast iron skillet with cover.  It cooked for 3 hours and was as tender as can be!  We ate it for 3 days and my family wants it again this weekend.

Awesome!  I rub the pork with a combination (half and half) of brown sugar and cajun seasoning before I put it in the slow cooker.

Wow!  I made this with a pork shoulder roast and it was amazing!  My husband and I devoured it - it was so easy and so good.  I used two bottles of BBQ sauce, one spicy and one regular and served on kaiser rolls.  I also returned the meat/bbq sauce to the slow cooker after pulling (rather than putting in the oven) and it was excellent.  Thank you for such an easy and fabulous recipe!

I listened to previous users and tried two different roasts.  The first time I used a tenderloin roast (because that was in the freezer) and the next I used the shoulder roast.  I slow cooked in beer for both and they fell easily apart.  The only thing is the shoulder is very fatty so you have to pick more out.  I then drained half the liquid out and put it in a roaster in the oven with the bbq sauce uncovered at 350 for 30 min.  This really baked in the flavor.   Both were great, but I would have to say the shoulder was more flavorful. My family wolfed this down with large hamburg rolls,(canned) baked beans and a salad.

I used a beef roast instead instead of pork. I also forgot to buy a can of beef stock so I threw in water and 1 beef cube instead. It came out outstanding, family loved it.

YUMMY! This is the best pulled pork that I have ever had. Very moist, it literally just fell apart. I used a jamacian jerk BBQ sauce (Rasta Joes Island Fire) that I purchased at a ribfest earlier in the summer. It is to die for!!! Best of all it is easy and very inexpensive. Thanks for the great recipe.

I doubled this recipe and put about three pounds in each slow cooker. I used someone else's suggestion, and put a bottle of beer in each crock pot. One I did a Black Butte Porter and the other Bud Light. I used two different types of barbecue sauce too, one was Sweet Baby Ray's and the other was a Honey BBQ from Kraft. Both turned out great, but I was concerned they were a bit overcooked. Make sure not to overcook the pork!

5 stars and 1100+ reviews for a reason! This is by far the best bbq pork I have ever had... and I live in the south! Hubby raved and declared it better than the local smoke joint! This will be a regular on our menu. Even better over the next few days in the fridge! I also used a pork butt and half regular bbq sauce and half sweetened bbq sauce (Pat's Ho-made BBQ and Hunt's Hickory Brown Sugar). I used the Crockpot only. Tender and Scrumptious! I'd give it 10 stars if I could! ***Update: Still loving this recipe! Following other reviewers' suggestions, I have switched to Sweet Baby Ray's and never looked back. Awesome!

This is such an easy recipe and our entire family loves this.  I do modify this by using a roast instead of ribs.  Use your favorite BBQ sauce and you won't be disappointed!

I used a cheaper cut of pork for this recipe.  It was a pork loin.  I followed the directions for crock pot cooking and the meat shredded easily for me.  I wish that I had chosen a different BBQ sauce than I did, as the meat needed a little something; maybe an extra zip of flavor?  Some sort of seasoning?  All in all, it was fairly good and my husband liked it alot.

I just got done making this recipe.
I used a pork roast in my not so good slow cooker for a little less than 8 hours. I tasted the meat to see the texture and it was SO tender. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to take the meat out and just return it back to the slow cooker after I drained the broth.
I added in some of the BBQ sauce we got... I don't particularly like the sauce we did get though.. would've prefered the Carolina mustard based style with this sandwich or something a bit sweeter. 
We got one that's pretty spicy (fiance's choice).
But other than the mistep with the sauce, the meat is just absolutely deliscious!!

Not sure this is a 5 star recipe, but it is exactly what it said.  I used pork sirloins and it turned out good.  I didn't like the taste of the hickory bbq sauce on it though, may be a bad mixture with the beef broth?  Anyhow, it was overall good, family liked it and it was very easy.

We used Sweet Baby Rays barbeque sauce and it turned out so delicious.  Next time I think I will add a little more sauce than is called for but other than that, perfect.

OMGosh!! This is really good!! I didn't change anything in the recipe. Didn't need to. It was easy as pie & very yummy. I do suggest splurging on a really good BBQ sauce or it won't be as good.

Awesome recipe! So quick to put together, too. Just what I was looking for. Be sure to use a brand/flavor of barbecue sauce that you are familiar with and like. I tried something new - and I was missing the honey from my regular brand. Thanks for sharing this! Will make again and again.

Wonderful recipe! We ate it with coleslaw and iced tea. What a winner!!! We did use a picnic cut of meat but ended up cutting it off the bone. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly!! Also, I had enough for leftovers for 3 days, and we have 2 adults in our family, and one child. This could make a large amount of food. We probably got about 12 sandwiches out of this recipe.

This was just perfect.  It took a while to shred, but was worth it.  Really, really yummy... four of us ate all of it in one sitting. :)

Excellent!  Takes a while to shred, but worth it considering I had enough for 3 meals, so all I had to do was pop the leftovers in the microwave.  Will definately make again!

extremely easy and excellent!  a good variety dish to add to the week.  just make sure when you put it in the oven, to stir it at least once because mine burned a little on the bottom.  thanks so much for the recipe!

Tastes great... you can save a little time by throwing the pork, about a pound at a time, into a food processor with a dough blade.  Tears up the pork without really cutting through it.

Very Good! I followed the recipe but didn't put in the oven. I added bbq sauce to the shredded pork with a little of the reserved aujus added for moisture. I put it back in the crock pot for about 20min on low. This will be perfect during football season with friends over. Thanks!

My family LOVES this recipe.  I did use the boneless pork ribs, but I used a honey barbacue sauce.  It came out very juicy and tender.  We love it!  This will become a family favorite!  Thanks

I didn't use the same ingredients, but this was delicious!  I started with a trimmed 4lb pork sirloin roast, 14 oz of chicken broth, and about 1/2 cup BBQ sauce.  After cooking I drained the meat in a colander over a large bowl to catch the broth, then added 1 c BBQ sauce and 1/3 c broth to the shredded meat to moisten it and it was perfect.

I love this recipe! It is so easy. I use a pork butt or a chuck roast. There is an awesome bbq sauce recipe on this site for a kentuckey whiskey sauce that I use instead of bottled sauce. We make this at least 2-3 times a month; it is definatley a family hit.

With twin sons in the NICU this was such an easy meal to make in the morning before I left for the hospital and when I came back it took no effort to finish putting it together for a great meal when my husband came home from work. LOVE IT!!

Very simple.  I made bourbon whiskey bbq sauce (from this site) two days before just for this recipe.  I ended up buying a boneless pork shoulder and cooked that in the beef broth and a tablespoon of liquid smoke.  It was a little tough to tear apart at first, but then I threw it all back into the crockpot with two cups of my pre-made bbq sauce for about an hour until it was heated through.  It was very tender and delicious.

Too easy and delicious!!
I made this last night for the fire fighters and EMT I work, they thought it was "AWESOME". I followed the directions to a T, very moist and tender. I could barely lift the meat out of the crock without it falling apart. I don't particularly care for Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce but it was the only sauce I had in the fridge and it was pretty good! I will definitely make this again.

Used a pork rub to put a little spice to it and let it go in a crock pot for about 6 hours.  Made up the Bourbon whisky barbeque sauce recipe on this website and came out with a fantastic meal.  Easy to do!

I made this dish for entertaining purposes and my guests (not to mention my husband)absolutely loved it, and added that it was better BBQ than a local restaurant.

Oh yeah this is good!  I used Mildly Wild BBQ Sauce and  it was excellent!  This is an extremely easy recipe and will most definately make it again.  Even my picky 15 y/o son loved it.  Just thinking about it makes me want to eat more.  Thanks for a great recipe.

We didn't like this at all.  It was really bland. Maybe it was our barbeque sauce, but we've had much better. We didn't even eat the leftovers.

This was great!  I cooked the meat in the broth for about 10 hours on low.  Then I shredded the pork and put it back in the slow cooker with some of the broth and a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays.  It was great!

This was so good. I used ribs that had bones because it was what I could find. The meat fell off the bone and shredded very easily. I used less BBQ sauce and it was great!

DELICIOUS! Super easy.  I seasoned my pork with Adobo all purpose seasoning by McCormick before putting it in the crock pot.  I also used Sweet Baby Ray's B-B-Q Sauce.  Excellent.  Made it for a party and everyone loved it.

Excellent recipe.  Have made this a couple of times now.  I don't think the trip to the oven is necessary.  I usually use a pork roast in place of the boneless ribs and the meat just falls apart beautifully. So simple.

GREAT recipe! I followed the reviwer's suggestion and used coke.  I also skipped the oven part and just let it thicken in the crockpot with the lid off for the last part. This recipe was SO easy and good!

I'm going to give this a 5star because it's so easy!  This has a really nice flavor.  I will make this again and next time I make it I'm going to put it in a more shallow pan so the barbecue has a chance to 'stick' to the meat.  Mine turned out a little too juicy for my taste.  My 15 year old son asked that we add it to the rotation and my 3yr old even liked it.... an overall crowd pleaser

EXCELLENT!  I added a small onion and 1 cup of sweet bbq sauce to the broth and pork shoulder in the beginning.  It cooked on low for 10 hours (4-5 on hi).  I drained the broth off, added 1-1 1/2 cups more of sauce, and ENJOYED.  QUICK, EASY and DELICIOUS!!!

I made this for my inlaws and they both said it was the best pulled pork they have ever had!  I used 2 cans of beef stock and about 1 1/2 bottles of the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  I also toasted the rolls.  Very good!

As someone who craves pulled pork on a regular basis, I must say -- wow, this is too easy and delicious. I, after reading the reviews, season and brown the pork on both sides and add a chopped onion. I make this approximately every other week.

Deeeeee-licious!  I wanted something warm to come home to after an outdoor Christmas Eve service at church.  This was perfect.  I used a 4 lb. pork roast and cooked it in the crockpot for about 8 hours on Low with 16 oz. water mixed with dry onion soup mix and a diced onion.  When we got home from church, I shredded the meat and stirred in some Jack Daniels BBQ sauce and a splash (or two) of Louisiana Hot Sauce.  I didn't even have a chance to stick it in the oven.  My husband and 4 teenage boys gobbled it up.  I pulled out some store-bought mustard potato salad and coleslaw and I had a houseful of happy eaters.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!  I used a 4.5 lb pork loin roast and cooked it in the slow cooker for just about 10 hours on low.  It fell apart with hardly any assistance from me it was so tender!

I put about 1 cup of the broth into the broasting pan with the meat and approximately 20 oz of Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  Then, just like the recipe called for, I baked it for 30 minutes.  

It was phenomenal!  I will definitely be making this one again.

This was wonderful - the only thing different I added was garlic/pepper.  It turned out wonderful, was very moist.  A hit at my house!

This was excellent and SUPER easy! I basically followed the recipe, however, I took a few other reviewer's suggestions and browned the meat first (I used 2 Pork Picnic Roasts) and added an onion and some garlic to the slow cooker. The meat fell apart when I took it out. I put everything back in the slow cooker with a little of the broth and the bbq sauce. It was excellent and even better the next day as left overs! 

Thanks for the recipe!

Fantastic!  This is one of our favorite meals...I generally cut way back on the BBQ and usually use a couple of boneless loin chops from costco.

I have made this several times.  It is one of my favorites.  It is so easy and it comes out wonderful.  I always use boneless county style ribs.  They work great.  You can experiment with different BBQ sauces, but the pork always comes out perfect, juicy and tender.

This was AWESOME!  My 3 children also loved it. The flavor was just right.  Meat was easy to shred.  I just mashed it with a fork and it fell apart, but was still juicy.  Used a cast iron skillet to heat in the oven.  Leftovers also delicious...didn't last long at my house.  We served it on toasted buns.  Had coleslaw and pickles on the side. Excellent, Easy recipe.  Thank you!

This is my go to for last minute company. (If I find out that morning they are coming by)  I call it my 30 second life saver.  Because it only takes 30 seconds to put everything in a crock pot!  This is so good you will be a star with company.  Everyone thinks you cooked all day.

Made this for a party this past weekend - everyone loved it.  I was doing a triple batch, so I made the meat in advance and froze it until the day of the party.  Thawed it and put it in the crock pot w/some new beef broth  for moisture and added Sweet Baby Ray's sauce to taste.  Left the bottle out for guests to add more as needed. My husband and I will make this again for ourselves.

I was worried at first.  When I think of bbq, naturally a grill or smoker comes to mind.  I used 5 pounds of country style ribs, since I wanted the flavor from the bones.  I rubbed a little liquid smoke on them, then placed them in the crock pot along with the broth.  I let them cook on low for 5 hours, then shredded the meat and added about a half cup of Sweet Baby Ray's sauce.  I don't like my pork swimming, just a little moist taste works well for us.  The sandwiches came out delish!!  My girls who call everything "chicken" couldn't get enough!  Also, the meat flavored up some baked beans really well!  Great meal for a busy day or even company!

this is quick and easy.  what really makes it is the bbq sauce you put on it.  i can't find my favorite brand anymore, so i'm experimenting and didn't love the one i used, but it's not the recipe's fault.

Very Good!  I shredded the pork and returned it to the crock pot instead of the oven with the barbeque sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) and a bit of reserved beef broth to keep it moist.

This recipe was awesome! I work all day, so I put the ribs on low for 8 hours. I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, and the barbeque was perfect! I scooped about 1/4 cup of the broth back into the barbeque before baking it in the oven with the sauce. Hands down,the best barbeque recipe I've ever tried.

This is good and easy. I added about 4 tablespoons of liquid smoke to the beef broth, italian seasoning (Itlian seasoning always goes well with pork)and onion. I shredded the pork which consisted of stiring it, it was so tender, I kept in about 1/2 cup of the brooth and used Sweet Baby Rays and kept on warm for about 2 hours. Everybody loved it!! It's good with cole slaw on top and extra bar-b-que sauce. Will make again and again!! Thanks

This was just ok.  I found the pork very hard to shred.  As someone stated earlier, alot depends on the bbq sauce.  This just didn't have anything special that jumped out and said "wonderful".

This is the most delicious thing I have ever made!  I must admit, having never attempted anything like this before, I was nervous as to how it would turn out.  Followed the recipe to a T, using Sweet Baby Ray's and it was absolutely perfect.  Served on soft kaiser rolls, topped with coleslaw, with a side of potato wedges.  Deeeeelish!  My boyfriend and his friend were absolutely in heaven!!!  Thanks for the recipe, this is definitely going to be in the rotation!

This was the best and so simple to make.  I placed the ribs in a crock pot with beef STOCK, onion, garlic and diced carrots and cooked them on low all night.  In the morning the meat almost fell apart.  I added 3 to 4 ladles of the stock, Jack Daniels Original BBQ sauce as well as Sweet Baby Ray's Original and his new Hickory & Brown Sugar BBQ sauces. Refrigerated all day to blend flavors and reheated for about 45 min. before serving.  Served on Kaiser rolls with a side of cole slaw and dill pickles.  This is a keeper.....  YUM!

Excellent!  This was super easy to make and tasted fabulous as my boyfriend said over and over again.  I myself thought it was really good too, but it was a little to sweet for me.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's original, so I think next time I will try using another bbq sauce that is less sweet.  I took others advice and added chopped onion, green pepper and a little minced garlic to the broth before adding the pork loin roast.  I cooked everything on high for 5 hours and removed the meat and the veggies and  drained the liquid off before shredding.  I added the meat and cooked onion/green peppers back to the crock pot and mixed in the bbq sauce and cooked this on low for another hour before serving on wheat buns. I was told that this is a definite keeper, so I'll be making this again.

I don't think I am really a pulled pork kind of girl.  My husband loved it.  I might try it again with another brand of BBQ sauce.. it is quite obvious that this will make or break the recipe.  I used Kraft and it just wasn't good.

I was looking for something for dinner that didn't require the guys leaving the TV on race day, this recipe fit the bill. As an added bonus, it tasted great. I used fresh ham roast and a bottle of Budweiser(keeping with race day tradition) instead of the beef broth. The roast required a little more cooking time, 6 hours on high in the slow cooker instead of four, but the meat pulled apart effortlessly. I put the shredded pork back in the slow cooker and added thinly sliced onion, green pepper and red pepper along with the bbq sauce. I cooked it on low about an hour.

WONDERFUL and SO easy!  I used 1/2 Sweet Baby Ray's as suggested and used 1/2 Heinze 57 because the SBR is a little on the sweet side for me.  GREAT meal!

I made this for our Super Bowl party and everyone loved it!  I just used a pork roast.  It took a little time to pull it apart, but it was easy.
I made it with Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and it was a hit!
I cooked the roast for about 6 hours, took it out and pulled it apart and then put it back in the crock pot with the BBQ sauce for about 1-2 more hours.  The pork sucked up the BBQ sauce so I'm glad I had two bottles on hand.
I only did one other thing different.  Since I had a three pound roast, the beef broth didn't cover even half of the roast.  I was afraid the roast would burn so I wanted it to be completely submurged in liquid.  I didn't have any more beef broth so I filled my crockpot with water.  I added some garlic and onion slices to make sure it still had taste.  It still came out great!

So easy....and so good.  I make this when  have the guys over for a game when I announce it is ready the savages come running.  I of course already have my sandwich made to avoid the melee.

Seriousy though...this stuff is good.  Shredding is a little time consuming but not too bad.  I use Sweet Baby Rays, one bottle in the mix and then another standing by for a little extra on the sandwich.

This was super easy and super delicious.  I also removed the juices from the crock-pot, shredded the pork (pork loin) and then added two bottles of BBQ sauce (Sweet Baby Ray’s original & honey.)  I returned it back to the crock pot on low for another hour or so.  You must try this recipe!

I added some chopped onion to the bottom before putting the ribs in. I also salt (lightly) & peppered the onions prior to adding the beef stock.  My family loved this recipe!  This is a keeper.

WOW!  So easy and so good!  I was concerned that it might need more cooking time, but I cooked it for only 4 hours and it fell apart when shredding.  I put the shredded meat in a large skillet and added the sauce, stirring until warm.  May use more sauce as the pork soaks it up.

Made this recipe for a football party and it was a HUGE hit.  Served on sub rolls, everyone wore the evidence of having had some (not a "dainty" sandwich")  Almost everyone left with the recipe - absolutely a keeper!!

Used Cattlemans Honey BBQ sauce - stirred in just 1/2 the bottle at first then slowly added more to taste.   Very very simple to prepare and very tasty - would definitely prepare again.

These were very good.  However, I left the ribs whole as opposed to shredding them for sandwiches.  I don't care for Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce so we tried that new Cattlemen's Choice.  We're kind of spoiled on homemade sauce but my husband and I felt it was pretty good for being bottled.

This recipe is very easy and tastes like you spent the day slaving in the kitchen. After reading the other reviews I used the Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce, half original and half honey. I've made this twice so far, once with pork and once with chicken. Both turned out great.

This was really good. I used babyback ribs....with bones (they were on sale) The shredding part was a little time consuming. I really liked it alot. Hubby did not, he doesn't really like pork. Daughter kind of liked it. I also used sweet baby rays.

This was so easy to make and the flavor was great(even before adding bbq sauce)!  I let it cook overnight in the crockpot, then was able to let it sit in the refrigerator all day with the bbq sauce on it.

I don't have a crock pot so I cooked meat in a 225 degree oven for 6 hours.  I added onions & garlic, salt and pepper with the broth.  Great recipe to make ahead of time .   Tasted great on crusty rolls (warmed in the oven).

I used a beef bouillion cube to make the broth, simply bc that's what I had, and pork loin, also bc that's what I had, and it turned out great.  Oh, and I followed reviewers' advice and added both onion and garlic - and I'm glad I did.  I can't wait till I cook this for the kids bc this is just the kind of thing they like!

simply terrific!  I'm in Denver and had to cook it for 6 hours on high.  I also added a sliced onion on the suggestion of other reviewers.  Wonderful, can' miss, too easy to believe!

Excellent recipe.  Very similar to "pulled pork" by Sarge - the only difference being the coffee which I omitted this time.  I did put the pork back into the crock pot on low with my favorite sauce, Sweet Baby Rays.  The results were just delicious and we had plenty to leftovers!  Two thumbs up!!

Excellent!! I did add the onion and garlic and used a bonless pork loin. I cooked it overnight on low and it just fell apart!! Used my own homemade BBQ sauce that was perfect for this. Definite keeper.

This had great flavor and was super easy.  Keep in mind that the BBQ sauce you choose will totally affect the flavor, so please choose a good sauce.  I used Jack Daniels' Spicy BBQ Sauce Recipe and it was very tasty.  As other reviewers recommended, I added thick sliced onions and garlic to the slow cooker.

SOOO simple and very tasty!  I used 2 1/2 lbs. of pork tenderloin with this recipe.  Mixed the BBQ sauce in the crockpot, then heated it on low for 30 minutes.  Served it over baked potatoes with cheddar cheese on the side.  MMmmm.  Kid friendly and different!  Husband even commented on the creativity.  :)  Thanks for the easy recipe, KK.

This was the perfect way to slow-cook pork loin (my choice) to make it moist and tender (I was able to shred the pork by just pushing on it with a fork!).  I used the sauce from the Barbeque Pork Two Ways recipe, which was yummy.  Next time, I'll try this recipe with one of the mustard-based BBQ sauces from this site.

This is an easy way to make tender & tasty bbq sandwiches!  My usual routine is a lot more complicated, but I needed something quick for a potluck at work.  This did the trick!  Use a good quality bbq sauce and you can't go wrong.

Yummy, I made this for my father and grandparents. They loved it. I used sweet baby ray's honey barbeque, which was a little too honey and sweet tasting. Next time, I might use half regular and half honey barbeque sauce. Obviously this was not the recipies fault. The meat was tender and yummy! Will make again and again! Thanks

I followed this recipe exactly and it was excellent. Even my picky 8 year old granddaughter liked it. I used sweet baby Rays bbq sauce and shredded the meat in my kitchen aid mixer. I love easy recipes that taste great. This is definitely a keeper and I’m sure will make it into our regular rotation.

Yummy! Used 3.5 lbs of a cheaper cut of pork. Kept in the slow cooker for 6 hours and I barely had to pull apart the meat. I read through some reviews and decided to follow the recipe in regards to putting the pork in the oven. It turned out lovely! Nice crisp ends.

Super easy and cheap! I didn’t have a Dutch oven or iron skillet so for the baking portion I used a glass pan. Would bake a little longer to get it a little crispier, but other than that it’s awesome!

Used 4 pound pork butt with bbq rub in a ziplock bag overnight. Cooked in crockpot with 1/3 cup water about 10 hours in low. Removed excess broth and sprinkled red chipotle powder, sprinkle brown sugar, a few good of shakes of apple cider vinegar and 1/4 bottle hickory and brown sugar bbq sauce. My husband ate it by itself! It goes great with spicy dill pickles. I’ll try a dash of liquid smoke next time. It’s a keeper!

Made this exactly like the recipe calls for and it was pretty good. My 3 year old is on his 3rd sandwich lol.  Next time I might play with the sauce to make it a little more tasteful.

Cooked approx 5 lbs of pork butt (after trimming quite a bit of fat) in beef broth on high for 4.5 hours and had my guests pour on desired BBQ sauce. Worked great for me! If you're looking for the most basic recipe to do shredded pork--this is it. 
I will say that it took me a long time to trim the fat off before putting it in the crock pot, but I'm sure others would have a better technique. So make sure you reserve time for trimming just in case!

I used a 5 lb. pork roast, and added some salt and pepper. Slow cooked it on Low for 3 hours, and on High for another 2-3. Shredded it on the baking sheet and drizzled the juices over it before I crisped the tips in the oven for 25 minutes. It came out great, and everyone loved it! (Even my picky son and hubby.)

This couldn't be easier and turned out delicious.  I used pork loin and chicken stock since it's what I had on hand.  A good quality BBQ sauce makes a big difference.

So easy to make and delicious!! I used a 1/2 rack of bone in ribs since it was just for 2 of us. I cooked it for 4 hours on low heat in the slow cooker, then on high heat for an hour and it was perfect. I mixed it with Sweet Baby Rays sweet and spicy bbq sauce and put it in the cast iron skillet and in the oven for about 15 minutes. I toasted the buns and topped them with a little mayo, cheese, red onion, and pickles - yum!!

Followed recipe exactly! Came out awesome- except I will say cooking on high for 4hrs is nice when you are in a time crunch, but slow and low reveals more tender pork! I’ve made other recipes with the same cut of pork that felt a bit more tender. I like low 6-8 hrs vs the 4 on high. Adding the beef broth is genius. I used the oven and it really does make a HUGE difference! Stop putting your meat back in the crock pot! This will be my go-to recipe with the exception of cooking low vs high. I used Bull’s-Eye Original bbq sauce because my husband isn’t crazy about sweeter sauces, and served with salt and vinegar chips for lunch and it was so tasty!! We both had multiple helpings! I also saved the broth juice for our fur babies- we don’t feed them table scraps, but anytime I have broth left over, I mix it in with their dry dog food and they go bananas for it! Both are passed out happily sleeping with full bellies! We might be next!

My grocery store only had bone in pork country ribs so I put them in the Crock-Pot for 5hrs on high.  The meat literally fell off the bones!  Easy to shred and came out amazing.  Great recipe, thanks for sharing!

This is what I would call "Cheat BBQ" I made this as written. 
It is EASY, and SIMPLE! That is what I need sometimes.
I feel like the choice of broth and bbq sauce can make or break the recipe. Toasted hamburger buns pushes it over the top.
After making this for years.. the combo I love the most is homemade beef broth and Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. 

 I took off a star because the information on type of sauce and broth is missing...use the wrong kind and you'll have a bland meal not worth the cost of the pork.

I made a half recipe, cooked on high for an hour and then low for 3 hours (relatively new crockpot). Only 1.5 lbs of pork ribs, used one full beefy onion soup mix, half of a box of broth, and put a little steak sauce in for added smoky flavor. Turned out great, very tender.

I made this exactly like the recipe and we loved it! I used a cast iron skillet for the oven baking and it did taste like it was cooked on the grill.

I have two active kids who play sports, so I am always looking for a good slow cooker recipe that has dinner mostly completed by the time we get home to eat. I am at a loss as to how this recipe is so highly rated. As written, this lacks any flavor and I had to doctor the final result so much, it isn't even close to being what is written. Flavorless would be the best way to describe the Pork before you add the  barbecue sauce, and honestly, if the sauce is what gives it all the flavor, why not cut to the chase and just add a bottle of sauce and skip the slow cooker all together. And being from the South, adding a bottle of BBQ sauce is not what I consider a good barbecue recipe.  I added onion powder, garlic salt, a bottle of Not Your Father's root beer, and some hot sauce, and it was edible, but both kids and the husband said to throw the recipe away. I have to agree with another reviewer--the people who rated this highly doctored it well past the original recipe, and that is not a true reflection of what you will get if you follow the directions. Meat is expensive--save your money and try another recipe.

This was bangin. Although I did season the meat with a teaspoon of garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper beforehand, this was very easy to make and packed quite a lot of flavor. My dad said it was the best bbq sandwhich he'd had, and he has lived in North Carolina for over 30 years.

It was terrific!!  Followed the recipe exactly, with one exception.  I didn't use as much bbq sauce.  This wasn't intentional.  The bottle I bought had more than the recipe called for so I had to guess at the amount.  I guessed wrong by about 4 oz I'd say but it was great and I will, intentionally this time, use this lesser amount of sauce when I make it again.  So very easy to make and so tasty.  I served it with cole slaw.

Might be the best pulled pork I've ever had. Super easy. I added a little of the broth back into the pork after shredding it and reduced the amount of BBQ sauce by a few ounces. Can't wait until I'm hungry again!

As I used an 8 pound , bone in, pork shoulder, I doubled the broth.  I made my  own using 4 bullion cubes in 16 ounces of boiling water.  It took 7 hours on high in the slow cooker until it was fall off the bone tender.
After draining and shredding the meat we skipped the oven and cooked it on low in the slow cooker with 1.5 bottles of Sweet Baby Ray's Vidalia Onion BBQ sauce.  Our crew loved it on hamburger buns.

I would make it again  but definitely cook it longer. Was it done, yes but I had to fight to get it off the bone. Pork will fall off the bone if you cook it long enough.  Hindsight, put it in your slow cooker the night before on low.  Save yourself  a lot of work.  Cook in a can of beer.

I used a 4 lb pork butt and put it in the slow cooker with the broth on low for 10-12 hours. I also just heated up the shredded pork and bbq sauce back in the slow cooker.

Best pulled-pork I've ever made! I seasoned it with salt, garlic powder and a special seasoning I use. It was delicious with or without BBQ sauce. I Used a Kraft BBQ sauce that was somewhat sweet, yummy!

Instead of using 1 can of beef broth we used 2 cups of chicken broth.  We started off with 14 oz. of BBQ sauce and added more as we went along.  This was fantastic!  We used the slow cooker for 5-6 hours on low rather than high.

Super simple and delicious, I added an onion to the beef stock. Simmered on low in the crockpot for 8 hours and used pork butt. I also only used a third to half the bottle of barbecue sauce as I really don't see why you need the whole bottle. Was perfect for an easy meal up north. Served it with cucumber salad, baked beans and corn on the cob

Very easy and very good.....I used A 6 pound pork butt and one bottle of Black and Tan beer instead of the broth. In addition i added some of my rib rub on top of the pork and a little liquid smoke. Cooked over night in the crock pot. 

I used very little of the cooking liquid in the shredded pork and added sweet baby rays and apple cider vinegar to taste and cooked at 300 for another 45 minutes.

Salt, pepper, garlic powder, browned pork butt 10 lbs, put in crock pot with 1 can beef broth on low for 10 hours, flipped it over midpoint. Drained meat, fell apart tender, placed back in crock pot with 1 cup of the broth it was cooked in. Hubby made homemade BBQ sauce that was served on top of pulled pork. Amazing!!

The recipe was easy, but had little taste other than the barbecue sauce. The beef broth didn't seem to make a difference in the final outcome. Even after baking the barbecue in the oven for 30 minutes, it still seemed too mushy.

Used chicken stock and put sliced onion at the bottom of the slow cooker. Didn't add the onion to the shredded meat as the onion was too mushy. 4 lbs of Boston butt with 3/4 of a 12oz baby Ray bbq sauce. Everyone loved it!! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Very good and easy way to make bbq. I used pork tenderloin because that's what we had on hand. The sauce I used was Guy Fieri's Kansas City sauce and it was excellent. Do not skip the baking part, it makes the pork less soupy and gives it the browned tips and edges, so good!!!

I used a pork shoulder because it was on sale. In the crock pot I added 4 oz of water plus a little salt, pepper, and sage instead of beef stock.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly and used Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce. Served it on warm kaiser rolls. This was so delicious and juicy.

I debated on whether to give this recipe 3 stars or 4, and felt it was unfair to only give 3.  The end result really depends on which barbecue sauce that you pick.  Mine was a little bland and i had to douse it in more sauce to make it more edible.  I was really not that impressed but my husband and son where fine with it, although they had to add more sauce as well.  Overall I think that I will keep looking for a different recipe that will really give me the WOW factor that I am looking for.  Probably wont make this one again.

Really tasty. I used a roast and cooked 10 hours in the crockpot then just added barbecue sauce for 30 minutes. Fed it to the youth group and they gobbled it up.

I used the sweet version of Sticky Fingers sauce before & used the Carolina Classic version of Sticky Fingers today. My son rated the sweet sauce as 4 and the classic (yellow) sauce as 3.5. Also, I used pork shoulder instead of ribs.

Fantastic for such a quick make!

I used pork shoulder instead of ribs. If doing so, I used 2 lbs. shoulder and cut it into 4 chunks for an even cook.

My broth was actually 3 beef bullion cubs mixed with 24 oz. hot water. Works great!

I have made this pulled pork twice. I substituted a 3.5 lb Boston butt, but otherwise followed the ingredients and recipes. Got great reviews from guests.

Based on what I had in the house, and what was most cost effective, I did this: Used a 3.5 lb pork butt roast, and swapped the beef broth for Coca-Cola, and doubled it. I also had an onion that needed to get used, and I thought that would add some nice flavoring, so I sliced it up and threw it in with the meat. Based on our schedules, I let it go on high for 10 hrs. The meat was very tender and fell apart easily. The onions were soft, and sweet and tasted great with the meat. I drained the cola out, then put the meat and onions back in the slow cooker, and poured a full bottle of Sweet Baby Rays over everything, and then left the slow cooker on "keep warm" for about an hour and a half until we were ready to eat dinner. Served with toasted sesame seed buns, cole slaw, and chips.

I followed a few suggestions from previous reviews. I bought a Boston Butt, seasoned with rub a butt season and a little hickory. I cooked on high for 4 hours, cut, shredded and continued cooking in juice from beef broth on low over night. I drained the juices off meat and poured on a delicious mustard based sauce and continued to let simmer in crock pot. The meat melted in our mouth. Was AMAZING.  This will be a regular at my house. Made with my famous  potato salad, bison burgers and bratwurst.

Could use pork should or pork butt. I sliced an onion and put it into the slow cooker at the beginning with the pork and will do that again in the future. I would also use less barbecue sauce but obviously that's a personal preference.

Nothing gourmet but certainly satisfying and simple.  I added half an onion.  I did not put the pork in the oven but after reading a couple of reviews I will give that a try next time.

Yummy. This is super easy to make. I cut the serving size down to 4 because it was just for my husband and I. The pork took about 4 hours to cook to become tender. I used the Jack Daniel's bbq sauce. Use the bbq sauce you like! I served it on toasted buns and for a side, I made Coleslaw.

Turned out great...my husband loved it, and since cooking isn't my forte, I'm really glad to have another easy and tasty dish, especially one I can stick in the crock pot in the morning before work so we can eat as soon as we get home. Instead of cooking on high for four hours and then cooking in a Dutch oven or skillet, I just put all the ingredients in the crock pot in the morning for 8 hours on low.

Delish and sooooo easy to make. 

I followed the receipe except for 1 thing. As other people suggested, I put onions to the bottom of the crockpot. When it was time to put the pulled pork in the over with the BBQ sauce (I used Sweet Ray's), I added the onions. Taste great!

I cooked it for 4-5 hours on high and it shredded perfectly for me. It was a different tasting BBQ, since you have a hint of beef broth infused. I still prefer traditional smoked meats for BBQ, but this is great for a crock pot meal.

Very easy and very good.  The pork just fell apart after 4 hours on high.  My only complaint is the amount of servings it says it makes.  3 pounds seems like it would be enough for 12, but 3 pounds of meat is enough for about 10 sandwiches and they were so good everyone wanted 2.

yummy yummy, I seared the meat after agressively seasoning with salt and pepper.  Put the meat on top of some diced onions, poured a beer over and slathered on a bit of grainy mustard.  4 hours later on high, shredded everything and put in the fridge until dinner.  Then mixed in the Kathy's Award Winning Barbeque sauce from this site and baked in the oven for a bit to get the crusty edges.  Totally awesome and the meat was not mushy as it can sometimes get in the slow cooker.

Excellent recipe! I don't have a slow cooker, so I used my pressure cooker. It was falling apart after 35 minutes and ready for the oven. I'm from Louisiana, so of course I added some creole seasoning with a little garlic and onion salt. I put a pinch of salt in with Cattleman's BBQ sauce and it was absolutely delicious!!

Love this recipe, I have tried it twice now and followed what it said the first time. The second time I was in the mood to experiment and used beer like one of the past reviews. It turned out awesome and had a great flavor! I would recommend making sure that you cook the roast long enough though, so that it shreds easily. This last time I cooked it for 4 hours and it didn't shred so easily (25 min. to do it). Other than that just make sure you use a good hoppy beer and you are in business.

I used a 5 lb pork roast.  I am always looking for a good crock pot receipe and this is a good one.  Simple but really good, that's my kind of receipe.

excellent...super moist and shredded easily with a fork. I didn't overdo the barbeque sauce. I had alot of compliments on it and that people liked it without tons of bbq sauce.

I used chicken broth instead of beef broth since it was all that I had. I served them with mini dinner rolls to create "mini burger".  It still came out great! I made this for superbowl Sunday and it was a hit!

Really easy recipes! The meat was a little hard to get out of the slow cooker as it was just falling apart, which is not a complaint at all. The only thing I did differently was I only used one pound as that is what I had on hand instead of the three. Turned out really nice.

Edit: I made this for an Easter party and got great reviews from everyone! The night before I boiled the pork on the stove for about 3 hours on med-high heat and shredded it that night. I also used some of the broth to keep the pork moist overnight in the fridge. The next morning, I put the pork and the bbq sauce in the crock pot and left it on high til it got warm and switched it to low when the guests arrived. It's such an easy dish that can feed lots of people and I love it because it stays warm in the crock pot. I love this recipe! 


So easy!! It really is effortless! I used pork butt and only had it on high for about 2 hours and it came out juicy and tender. After shredding it, I rinsed out the pot and put it all back in with the bbq sauce. This would be great for parties since its so easy..

Fabulous! It really is as simple as it sounds. I choose to bake it with only a little BBQ sauce and let people put as much as they like on the sandwich.

this was one of the best recipes I've ever made. my husband kept saying over and over again, honey this is soooo good!. and that's saying something... he doesn't give compliments very often.  i did add some brown sugar and the BBQ sauce 2 hours into cook time tho... still turned out pretty dang good!

this was so good and it was so easy. I did the whole thing in the crock pot and slow cooked for 8 hours. Cooked in beef broth, after 8 hours  and cooking I drained the liquid then shredded with a fork. After shredded added favorite bbq sause.YUM!

I made this the other night, and it was wonderful!  I only changed one thing I kept it in the slow cooker for 10 hours on low and didn't use the oven.  The pork was even better the next night!!!  Thanks

Easy and good, though my husband prefers his pulled pork smoked.  Next time I think I'll just use a smokey BBQ sauce.

Wow, amazing pulled pork!  Delicious!  My boys LOVED it!  This is the best reciped ever!  The pork is sooo flavorful.  Definately don't skip the oven part (it REALLY infuses the flavor)!!!!!  I used "boneless pork country ribs" that I got at Winco on sale.  I suppose you could use any cut of meat (pork) but why would I when these turned out soooooooooooooooooo yummy!  I think I will stick with this cut of meat!  This is one of my new top recipes.  A frequent flyer at our house (especially on lazy Sunday afternoons after it cooks aaaaalllllll day).   Get good quality buns (not hamburger buns)..... this pork is worthy of it!  I used sweet baby Rays bbq sauce.    YUM!  YUM!   YUM!!!

This was absolutely the best pork BBQ we've ever had! I had never made it before, but my husband was craving it so I looked up a recipe to give it a try. I used Sweet Baby Ray's Hickory Brown Sugar BBQ sauce and made little sliders with some homemade rolls - they were to die for! The sauce was really perfect for pork BBQ too, in our opinion. Thanks for posting!

Great recipe!!!  I purchased pork baby ribs  by mistake.   Turned out fine.  I cooked the ribs for about 6 1/2 hours on high since the bone was in.

Followed the recipe accept that I set the crockpot to Low for 10 hours and I used a less expensive cut of meat. Finally, used a disposable aluminum tray (uncovered) instead of a dutch oven when following the last step as I wanted something to easily store any leftovers in.  This recipe was a hit with myself and the two guests that I had over for dinner last night. I'll certainly be making this again!

soooo good! the meat was wonderful. instead of boneless pork ribs (wat is that anyway?) i used a pork butt. soo much cheaper and just as good. doesnt take that much effort to trim off the fat, people! i served it on toasted potato buns (trust me, theyr to die for) and homemade potato salad. yum!

After 4 hours in the crock pot, the pork got shredded and tossed in the dutch oven with bbq sauce from our favorite local restaurant. It was simple and delicious. My husband finished his sandwich as I was not even halfway done with mine. Needless to say, he loved it. We will definitely make this again and keep with the original recipe. No need to modify.

This was so delicious and easy! Both the kids and grown-ups loved it!   I salt and peppered and browned the meat first and added sliced onion to the bottom of the crockpot. I placed the meat inside and topped with the beef broth and a cup of bbq sauce. Then I cooked it for a full 10 hours before shredding and adding more BBQ sauce. SOOOO delicious! We will make this again for sure.

Great recipe! I have never made BBQ pork before - but this was so easy and turned out so well!  I can't wait to make it again!  I did add salt/pepper to taste even though the recipe didn't call for it.

So, so easy yet very tasty! I did add some liquid smoke to give it a little more flavor, and put salt and pepper on the pork before putting in crock pot.  No need to put in in oven, just shred meat with two forks and put back in crock pot with barbeque sauce.

I am from the South myself, i grew up with NOT adding BBQ sauce to pork and meats when slow cooked or smoked. I did this one without the BBQ sauce as well. I added a '' secret '' dry rub to the meat and set in the frig for a few hours till i was ready to throw in the slow cooker. The meat is what you really want , NOT someone elses sauce poured all over your creation.

i put it on french bread and i let the meat soak overnight in the broth which made things way to easy perfect for a fast snack the next day or for lunch... and tender too!!

this recipe is way better than i had anticipated, i held off on some of the bbq sauce and let people add more if they wanted, otherwise i think the bbq would have just been too much. everyone that ate it really liked it which rarely happens. good and easy.

GREAT! I used 2 - 2.5 lb Pork Tenderloins. I read that this is like using T-Bone's to make hamburgers, but MAN tenderloin made great pork sandwiches! Wonderful and is enough to have food to eat for several days!

This was so easy and so very, very tasty. Make sure to use a barbecue sauce you love, because its flavor will determine how good the sandwich is.

I made this for my three sons and husband.  They loved it and kept making sandwich after sandwich.  I was lazy and used bottled BBQ sauce over the shredded meat.  Served with cole slaw on buns.  Excellent!!

This was super easy, and I love easy...then when it turns out yummy...YEA! I used the pork shoulder roast, as well as two cans of beef broth, but only because my crock pot it kind of big, so I wanted more coverage on the roast. Don't skip the oven part...it really infuses the bbq sauce into the meat. Yummy!

meat was tender and delicious. My family didn't really go crazy about it though, like I thought they would. It tasted like any other pretty good BBQ. I really liked it though.

Followed recipe exactly except cooked boneless ribs all day (about 10 hrs) on low in slow cooker (rather than 4 hrs on high as recipe called for).  Came out DELICIOUS!  Don't skip the oven part after, it helps make it even better!  This is a keeper!

I tried this recipe today for our church group and it was a BIG hit! I used a 6.5 lb. pork shoulder and seasoned it with salt,pepper & garlic powder. I cooked it in beef broth with a few minced cloves of garlic for 10 hours on low. The meat shredded SO easily. I added Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce and let it heat for another hour before I served. I served it on rolls with macaroni salad and sweet potatoes. SO DELISH.

It almost seems silly to review since it already has so many positive reviews, but I had to- it was just that good!  This was my first attempt at a slow cooker recipe.  I followed it without making any changes, and it was awesome!  I highly recommend!

So good, and so easy!  I followed the recipe fairly closely.  My only change was to use a Boston Butt instead of the ribs.  I cooked it on high high in my crockpot for 4 hours, then transferred it to my dutch oven where I shredded it, removed any excess fat, and mixed in my fave bbq sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's).  After that I put it in the fridge til the next day, when I warmed it in the oven at 350 for 1/2 hour.  I served it on rolls with cole slaw, and it was a huge hit.

I made this for dinner last night and it was pretty easy to make.  The meat was tender with a nice flavor because of the beef broth, the bbq sauce was easy to stir in and gave it a great flavor as well.  So everything was great until... I put it in the oven and it dried up.  I had to add a bit more bbq sauce to make it a bit juicier, so that's why I'm giving it 4 stars.

Came out a little bland. It needs a little something spicy in there. Make sure you use a QUALITY bbq sauce.

Easy, good recipe.  We added some extra spices and chilis to bump up the flavor- the hardest part is deciding on a BBQ sauce...  then let the slow cooker do the work!

We give this a four only because we added some things...but this was a great base to start. We added the beef broth but only had a 10 ounce can, so we added a couple shakes of liquid smoke and about half a bottle of hickory smoke A-1. Put it in the crock pot for fours hours and followed the instructions the rest of the way. It was AMAZING!!!! I would give the meal that came out 5 stars, but because we didn't stick to the recipe exact, I gave it 4...hope that makes sense.

I can't believe how easy and delicious this was...just use your favorite bbq sauce and use the amount that suits your personal taste.  There are some good sauce recipes on this site - I will definately make this again.  It freezes well too.

I cant cook, but I can cook this! I skipped the oven step but next time I wont and I am sure it will be even more delicious. I used a bottle of sauce and it still tasted delicious.

Although my husband initially complained about the smell of the pork cooking, there were certainly no complaints once the sandwiches were ready and he took that first bite. This was so easy to make, feeds an army if you use a shoulder cut, is really inexpensive on a per serving basis, and turns out to be really tasty. Thanks for the advice on Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. That and the Hawaiian bread rolls made for an even more delectable combo!

The only reason I gave it four was for the other reviews THAT OVERWHELMED ME!:) My husband always says Keep it simple. I read and read and then doubted. I used country style boneless pork. I followed the recipe as written. Awesome! I agree that the right cut of meat is imperative. I think the lemon is important as well. Helps tenderize the meat. Just don't get overwhelmed by all the reviews just follow it and you will not be dissapointed.

I liked this beacuse it is hard to find good crock recipes.  When I put it in the crock pot I layered the bottome with red onion.  I added garlic, salt and pepper worteshire sauce a dash of liquid smoke and a can of coke.  left on low all day then shredded and used origianl sweet baby rays.  Had over potatoe buns and coleslaw.  was very good

I made this recipe this past Sunday for the football games, and it was a hit!  The pork came out so nice and tender and putting it into the oven gave it a great flavor and texture.  This is definitely a meal you would want to serve if you need to serve a lot of people.  I will definitely make this again!

The only substitution I made was I used a pork tenderloin instead of the rubs. It was good and very tender. It was not outstanding though.

SOOOO good! I followed the recipe exactly as it said and used a really good smokey barbecue sauce from trader joes. definitely a good choice. I served them on whole wheat buns that were slightly toasted and very lightly buttered with carrots and sharp cheddar kettle chips and it was so good! It keeps well in the fridge and can be heated up by the microwave and still taste very good too! thanks!

This turned out very good, but I felt it needed to cook on low heat longer than 4 hours to be tender and fall apart. I also used a butt roast, so no need for the broth...

I used a shoulder as well, and wasn't sure about the cooking time to use.  I work for 7 hours, and couldn't turn it off after 4, so I cooked it on low setting.  When I cut into it, it wasn't quite ready, so I turned it up to high for another hour and 45 minutes, and it was perfect.  It shredded easily.  Next time I'll try a medium setting for the whole day. I followed the rest of the recipe, and cooked it in the oven 350, for 30 minutes.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce, and I have to say this turned out perfectly.  thanks for a great recipe!

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars!  I use pork tenderloin instead of ribs.  You can get the Homel Mesquite Barbecue flavor, or some grocery stores have their own brand - I know HEB in Texas does.  I can't tell you how many times I've passed this recipe on to friends and family!  You have to try this recipe!!

I have made this a few times and it is fabulous! The first time I made the recipe as it is and it was really good- the second time I didn't have any broth so I used half a can of beer. It was better than the first time! I do use Sweet Baby Rays for the sauce- the best!

Delicious cooked in beer. I used Corona and Guiness. I would say Corona is better. Both were great though!

I dont have a slow cooker, but used my dutch oven and added some garlic powder, mexican chili and onions and greenpeppers.  It came out really moist and delicious!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce but added some hot sauce so it wouldnt be so sweet.  Came out perfect and ate it with the sweet slaw recipe.  What a hit!

I added my usual seasonings... adobo & garlic powder. Came out amazing!! I put it in the oven and I think that helped the texture. Thanks for such a great recipe.

Great recipe!  I used a 2 lb. pork tenderloin.  This is so easy and you can make lots if you're serving a large group.

MMMMM VERY VERY GOOD and SUPER SIMPLE!!! I used Pork ribs Cut the meat off the bone and ended up marinating the meat overnight in the beef broth. Also i do not own a Dutch oven or Iron Skillet So i just placed them on a reg cookie sheet Spread it out and then baked it as directions Say. Turned out GREAT Had the Crispy ends but still really tender. Also used Sweet Baby Rays Sweet and Spicy BBQ. This is a make again for sure recipe.

This was great! Super easy! I used a can of cola and I used the pork roast instead of the pricier ribs. Everybody gave it two thumbs up.

I used boneless country ribs, as that was all I could locate at the grocery store in a hurry.  Rubbed with pepper, some garlic powder, and a bit of salt...cooked with the broth for 8 hours.  Used Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  Turned out wonderful! Thanks!

Love this recipe.  Made it for a group of men and they all loved it.  No need to add any addition flavors to this recipe.  Just make sure to use a good BBQ sauce.

Very yummy, but I had to add to the recipe to make it yummy.  I seasoned the pork with seasoning salt, garlic and onion powder, cumin and pepper.  I cut up 1 large onion and placed it at the bottom of my crock pot, putting the pork on top.  I don't think it would've been as yummy without the added flavors of the onion and seasoning.

This is the perfect recipe for BBQ pork. Truly, I don't much care for BBQ and I ate this as lunch leftovers everyday this week. It is absolutely necessary to choose a BBQ sauce that you enjoy, but this is a perfect cookinng method and it has the best flavor.

Used a 4.5 lb boston butt roast, cooked in the crock on med for about 8 hours. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. It was good, not great. A little to "mushy" for my liking.

This was by far the best pulled pork I've ever made. It was very tender and my family raved about it. With coleslaw on the sandwich, it was the most perfect BBQ pulled pork.

Extremely easy and very good with Cattleman's Smokehouse BBQ sauce.  Could use a little more kick though.  I used about 4.5 pounds of bone in ribs, which were pretty easy to remove from the bone prior to baking.

This was very tender and juicy! I found it a tad too salty for my taste (even without adding any salt), possibly due to the beef broth, so I may try only using half of the broth then adding in water. Once the pork was done (about 5.5 hours in the slowcooker on high for a 4 lb. pork shoulder butt), I toasted ciabatta rolls, then piled on the pork. Served with baked potato chips and a pickle slice... Yummy!

Wow, that was so easy and tasted fantastic!  I invited my parents over for dinner and served this with cole slaw and french fries.  My dad said it was better than the BBQ restaurant down the street.  I will make this again for sure.

DA BOMB!!!!!  So easy...your husband could make it. Meat is very tender and easily shreds with 2 forks. My husband raved about this one. I have made it once a week for the past month. I used a spicy honey BBQ sauce and it was delicious. Its even better the next day! Followed recipe exactly...very pleased! served with potato salad, wheat buns and sliced pickles n onions. Good stuff!

This was awesome!  I let it cook for about 6 hours, and it shredded very easily!  I also made Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce instead of a bottle- and it was WONDERFUL!!

Yummy!  Make it just as is-it's perfect.  Buy GOOD bbq sauce-it makes a huge difference.  On my second time making it, I was in a bit of a time crunch so I put the meat under the broiler for a few minutes instead of the 350 degree oven with similar results.  Thanks for this easy, yummy recipe!

I used a shoulder, like some of the other reviews said, and by the time i trimmed all the fat, it wasn't enough meat in comparison to the BBQ sauce and beef broth. It was also a little sweeter than i expected also, so pick your BBQ brand carefully!

This was a good recipe, but very basic. I cooked if for 5 hrs and the meat shredded very easy, I used 1 and a half bottles of bbq and added a little bit of hot sauce. I also browned the meat before putting it in the slower cooker. The left overs were better. I rated it a 4 star because thats what my boyfriend told me to rate it, I would rate it maybe a three star, because it was just all right.

This was delicious.  I changed it up by adding Vernors instead of broth.  I served it with some good, small fluffy white rolls and the kids LOVED it!! I will make this again.

Very tasty!!! They didn't have boneless pork ribs where I went so I got boneless carnitas and it worked very well. I also didn't have an iron skillet or dutch oven so I just used a glass 9x13 pan. Great recipe! Thanks!!!

The sauce is the key in this dish.  I tried used Kraft Hickory and it was gross.  Next time I'll make sure I pick something of more quality.  I did mine on low for 9 hours, then in the oven for 15 on 350.  The roast came out wonderfully, and you could even skip the oven step.  I didn't add the BBQ until then, so I wanted the flavors to meld some more.  Super easy. Thanks!

I've made this a couple times...it's fabulous.  I tried it with pork shoulder and it works great too.  I've also put some of the BBQ sauce in the slow cooker with it (and then add more after I remove it).  You can't go wrong either way!  Serve with some coleslaw on the side...so good!

I liked this recipe,easy to make,only we didn't put it in the oven,got to thinking that that maybe doing that would dry it out,so we had it right out of the slow cooker. Very good and very tasty.

I followed the suggestions to use pork butt roast and cooked the roast for 10 hours on low, placed in the fridge overnight, and then heated it up the following day for the meal.  I used Austin's Own BBQ Sauce for the first time... "Thick, rich, semi sweet flavor, encompassed by a a dark maroon color meshes with pulled pork like apples in an apple pie" was one reviewer's opinion of the sauce/pork combo.  Yum. Definitely making this again!

I slow-cooked a 2Lb pork sirloin roast for 3 hours on med-high, shredded, then cooked another 45min in the bbq sauce on low since the meat was already finished. For the sauce I used a bottle of cheap hickory honey bbq sauce, then added 1.5Tbs of Stubb's Inferno Chicken Wing Sauce (whoa! Added a nice kick!) and 2tsp white sugar. The meat was  deliciously tender, making for great sandwiches.  This is the 1st time I've cooked with this cut of meat, and I'll be using it for slow cooking roasts more often.

Fantastic!!!  Only modifications was using 1 12 oz. bottle of Firestone Double Barrel Ale in addition to the 14oz. of Beef Broth.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's as well.  I would keep extra on hand for those that like to sauce it up more.  I didn't have to switch to a pan as well.  Just drained the ceramic pot from the slow cooker, hand shredded the meat and put it back in the ceramic pot...mixed the sauce in and popped the inner pot into the oven for the 30 minutes.  Fantastic!!!  A definite keeper.  You cannot go wrong with this recipe at all.

Absolutely the best bbq pork you can make at home.  The meat was so tender when it came out of the slow cooker.  I almost skipped putting it in the oven, boy I'm glad I didn't.  It made the meat brown up a little.   The only thing I would do differently is to leave a little bit of sauce out in case anyone wanted to add some more to their sandwhich.

I made almost 10 lbs. of boston butt, cooked with a beer, and used the Vinegar Based BBQ sauce (from this site).  Everyone thought I had dinner catered!  I know this isn't exactly the recipe posted, but reading all the reviews got me to my 10 star pork dinner.  Thank you!

This is a wonderful recipe ~ so darn simple, but absolutely yummy!  I have made it at least a dozen times now and the family loves it.  If you don't have beef broth, use beer or cola (or a combination of any of these liquids).  For the sauce, I use a combination of Sweet Baby Ray's and Cattleman's Smokehouse ~  wonderful flavor!!!

The cut of pork I use varies but this recipe always comes out great! Do not skimp on the BBQ sauce, use the best quality one you can get your hands on.

Ok..I didn't make exactly...I used beer instead of broth and 4 lbs of pork butt (cheaper) on high for 6 hours. Finished baking it with Jack Daniels Original BBQ sauce and put on a kaiser roll. Mmmmm! One of the easiest to make and tastiest pulled pork recipes ever!

This is a good and easy recipe.  I used Boston Butt.  Of course whether it turns out truly tasty or not depends almost entirely on the type of BBQ sause used.  Like with so many recipes I found it did not make nearly as many servings as they said, and we really are not very big eaters.

Prepared this over the weekend with pork "picnic roast".  Turned out very nicely.  Cheap way to get lots of BBQ pork versus buying it from BBQ joint.  Being from Texas I prefer beef but this is very tasty.

I give this recipe 10 stars! Its SO yummy! We will definitely be making this more often! My husband loved it. I used the boneless ribs and cooked it in my crockpot on high for 3 hours then low for 2. It came out perfect! Just fell apart! I baked it with sweet baby rays. Thanks SO  much for this fabulous recipe!

I made the recipe exactly as stated and it was fantastic. My son asked me if I could make it more often. The pork pulled apart with barely a touch of the fork. I did use the boneless pork ribs which were very expensive, may try another cut next time. Highly recommended.

Very good and simple, I sauted green peppers and onions in a frying pan to add to the meat and it was delicious. I am going to make it using beef rump roast today and I'm sure it will be delicious also.

I used a four pound bag of boston butt (here in South Texas it's labelled "carnitas"). Cooked it on high for about five hours, and drained the liquid because there seemed like ALOT of liquid. Then I added a jar of Stubb's and threw it back in the Crock Pot for another 30-45 minutes. I thought it was dry (probably my bad) so after sending out DH for more sauce, it tasted pretty good. Probably would make again.

It was good I don't think you really need the beef broth.  If I make again I will try it without the broth.  I just shredded and put back in crock pot with bbq sauce for a bit longer.

Very tender & moist roast -- shredded easily. Some mixed feelings about adding the BBQ sauce, but may have been the brand we used. Kids liked it, but not as much of a hit as hoped. Will likely try again.

Made this yesterday for friends and got rave reviews.  I used boneless pork ribs and put it in the crockpot with a bottle of beer instead of beef broth for about four hours.  I used Budweiser smoked bbq sauce.  One of my guests told me he had pulled pork out Texas Roadhouse the day before and this was way better! So easy; I'll be making this again.

Living in eastern North Carolina, I wouldn't even think of using a barbecue sauce on my pork, so I tried this recipe a bit differently. I use a 16 oz bottle of apple cider vinegar instead of the beef broth, and let the pork sit in that over night in the refrigerator. The next morning I set the crock pot on low for about 10 hours. It didn't have enough bite to it, so I mixed about two tablespoons of red pepper with a half cup more of vinegar, and mixed that in with the shredded pork before putting it in the oven. It turned out really well.   I'll definitely be making this again and again. It's simple to make, and makes 8 sandwiches for a grand total of about $11 (including the buns).

This was great. I modified it a bit. I used an 8lb pork shoulder and cooked it in a crock pot with beef stock with chili powder and brown sugar on it's high setting for 10 hours. Then shredded it with forks, it fell off the bone and fat, and baked it in the oven for 30 min with sweet baby rays BBQ sauce mixed with brown sugar chili powder and hot sauce. Served it at a football party and everyone loved it.

Wonderful recipe.  So easy!  I couldn't find boneless pork ribs at the store so I purchased bone in.  The pork fell right off the bone and tasted moist and wonderful just after cooking it in the beef broth in the slow cooker.  Once added to the BBQ sauce it was perfect for the sandwich.  Great tasting.. the right BBQ will make the recipe stand out even more.  Definitely a recipe that will be used in my house often.. easy and delicious!

To Jill from New Jersey....if it was hard to shredd, then you didn't cook it long enough. When pork is cooked the proper length of time, it is always 'very' tender. I have been cooking for over 40 yrs., and the 'best' cut of pork for BBQ is always a Boston Butt. I have always cooked mine in my pressure cooker because it is so much quicker, but this recipe sounds good.

I have made this many times now, but have not gotten around to rating. I love  it, it also works well with roast or chops as long as they are boneless. This is always enjoyed when I make it for company/friends.

Really tasty.  I thought the meat was succulent and not to "saucy".

Very good flavor.  I used Baby Ray's barbecue sauce and it gave the meat a really good smoked flavor.  It did take the meat a little bit longer to cook for me (almost 6 hrs in the slow cooker)but it was well worth the wait.

For anyone else like me that is short on time...There is no need to stray from the recipe or create more work for yourself. Came out delicious just by following the recipe. I did like someones idea to substitute beer for the beef broth. May try that next time.

I got a 4.5 lb pork butt. Although next time I will go with a meat that is less fatty and will probably be easier to shred.  I cooked it with 12 oz of beer instead of beef broth in my slow cooker on high for 4 hours (internal temp was 160 degrees) and then coated it in cattlemans bbq sauce and put it in the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  Came out sooo moist. My fiance loved it. Definitely made enough for at least 6 sandwiches.

Very good! I added a whole white onion sliced with the meat. I took advice of other reviewer and added beer instead. Also I added some dry rub to meat before cooking. Very tasty

We tried this tonight and my family and I loved it.  It is definitely better than most or all restaurants that we have had.  I wish I had not kept it in the oven for the 25 minutes that I did.  I think it may have dried it out a little.  Next time I will do 15 or 20 minutes.

This was excellent and I believe that baking it in the oven did concentrate the BBQ flavors. I also added back some of the liquid from the crockpot before baking and the consistency was perfect. This will definitely be one that we use over and over, starting with Christmas day. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so good and SO EASY!  I put it in the crockpot before I left for work in the morning-took me less than 5 minutes.  I used a bone in pork roast (not sure what cut, but it was a cheaper cut of meat) and I cooked all day (10 hrs) on low.  Turned out perfect!

I have made this more than 2 times now, and it came out perfect everytime I make it. Boyfriend and his dad thought I was a superb cook! As per other reviewers' suggestion, I used a cheaper cut of pork like a butt roast.  I have also used pork tenderloin too. They both turn out good.  I put the roast in the slow cooker at about noon, let it cooked until about 4 p.m., drain, pulled it apart and put lots of bbq sauce over it and continue cooking it in the slow cooker. Served with a can of baked beans, a bag of slaw and bottled slaw dressing, and chips. DELICIOUS and EFFORTLESS!

Amazing!!!
Easy and very tasty, I followed the receipe exactly and it come out perfectly. After reading some of the other reviews, I had considered using a higher grade of pork but decided against it. After making the receipe, I can say that I am happy I used what the receipe called for. In addition, the 30 minutes int he oven added just the right amount of crispiness to the edges of the meat. My husband loved this as well and has already asked when we can add it to the grocery list again!

Yummy. I left the meat in chunks and used Sweet Baby Rays Honey BBQ Sauce. My hubby likes it that way.

I followed the recipe as stated except I used a butt roast that I already had.  I seasoned it with cajun seasoning then I followed the directions.  It was super easy and the sandwiches were great!  I made enough to freeze for another day.  I'll definitely be making this easy meal again!

I used a pork roast, and actually put it in frozen.  It came out wonderful.  I used Big Al's K.C. Bar-B-Q Sauce from this site.  DELISH! Hubby kept going back for more. Will make again.

Phenomenal!  Had extended family of 10 over and everone raved.  Husband said it was the best barbeque I have ever made.  I used Famous Dave's Rich and Sassy sauce.  I only used the crock pot.  I will definitely make this again.

WOW! This was easy and yummy!  I used a pork shoulder roast, but otherwise followed the recipe and it turned out beautifully. It was easy to remove the extra fat while I was pulling it so I think it turned out to be pretty lean.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.

Fabulous!  Very tasty, incredibly easy and inexpensive!  I love that I can use a pork butt cut instead of the ribs.  Mmm!  Will make again.

This could not have been simpler, and tasty as well.  It also freezes well for sandwiches later down the road.

This was excellent even without the bbq sauce.  It was simple to make and for that it deserves 10 stars!  I used "Big Al's" sauce.  Next time I will probably use a bottled sauce, just to keep it extra simple.

Amazing and so simple.  Sweet Baby Rays sauce made this really good.  I also used a Pork Rub on the meat and used the cheap pork butt.

Great recipe.  Couldn't find boneless so I used about 5lbs with bone in.  Turned out fantastic.  Also used a recipe for BBQ sauce that another reviewer had put on here.

Hubby loved this!  I made a small amount (1 lb. of boneless pork rib) but still left it in the crock pot for about 4 hours on high with beef broth (made from bouillon), then cooked with BBQ sauce as directed.  It was very tender and delicious.

Used a pork butt (much cheaper) this is a great way to feed a lot of people for a lower price.  For sure do the 10 hours on low...it is worth it!  I used a whole bottle of bbq sauce.  Next time I will try making my own.  I really liked putting it in the oven for a half hour, it made the pork less soggy

So good!! My husband was freaked about pork cooking in beef broth...but he was so happy with it he took all the leftovers to work. 

I disagree with the sweet baby rays, we just don't like it....but if you make your own sauce...it's awesome!!!

This recipe was very good and so easy to make.  I had never tried boneless ribs and always used roasts instead.  The boneless ribs were so much easier to shred!  Placing the pork in the oven with the barbecue sauce gave it a nice consistency as it wasn't soupy like some other recipes I have tried.  This one is a keeper.  Thank you!

I have cooked this meal 2 times now.  The first time I followed the recipe and it turned out great, except there was a few corners of the meat that got dried out as the broth evaporated.  The second time I cooked it in one of those oven/crock pot bags on med temp.  It cooked twice as fast that way and was super moist.  After I shred the meat I divide it in two seperate pans for the oven that way I can make a spicy bbq mix for my husband and a mild one for the kids and everyone gets what they want.

Used 5 lb. pork butt.  Cooked on high for 3 hours, then low 6 hours.  The meat shredded so easily.  I left most of the liquid in the crock pot, then added Sweet Baby Rays and cooked on high for another 45 minutes.  Husband thought it looked too watery, but after eating said it was really good.  Served with "Baked French Fries I".

A Success!  No left overs with this one either.  Baby Ray's BBQ sauce is the best!

Easy and simple.. the way I like it. People are so ready to throw in a million spices.. This is much more realistic especially for parents!
Big Baby Ray's?? Tried it.. must be a Northern thing because it wasnt like God's gift to BBQ sauce.
Would like to have a good reference for a mustard base BBQ sauce since Im a southerner.

Oh this was easy.  I used a 5lb boston butt pork roast.  I added a little liquid smoke.  Dont think it was needed though.  I ended up using a local bbq sauce from the supermarket.  Taste was wonderful.  I will be making batches of this for the freezer.

This is a staple in our house. I usually use country style pork ribs and beer instead of stock.  The hubby loves to add tons of fresh garlic and pickled sliced jalapenos.

These were so easy and a great hit. I did it a little different. I put them in the crockpot in the morning on low and then around 2 drained the water, added the bbq sauce and turned the crock pot to keep warm. This way it was done and ready for dinner. I never put them in the oven. It was awesome!

Simply the best BBQ pulled pork I've ever made. I made my own BBQ sauce for it and it turned out as good, if not better, than anything you'll find in a restaurant. Absolutely delicious.

Very flavorful--family loved it.  I won't change a thing.  I used boneless pork shoulder pieces and it worked beautifully.  Very little fat and it shredded easily.  I suggest having additional barbecue sauce available for those who prefer a "saucier" sandwich.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Quick and easy recipe for a busy mom.  I used a cheap cut of pork and seasoned it with salt and pepper prior to letting it cook in the stock.

I also filtered some of the stock to thin out the the bbq sauce since my family prefers less bbq flavor.

This was REALLY good! I'm not usually a BBQ eater (the husband is) but this was awesome! I did make a few changes- used pork butt, cooked for 4.5 hrs on HIGH, and when I added the BBQ sauce I put it back in the slow cooker for an hour on Low. Turned out very tender, and was easy to fork apart! Thanks for a great recipe!

Used a pork butt roast and added about 1/2 of vinegar.  So easy.  The shredding was the hardest part, but once I got started, was very easy.  Great recipe and everyone loved it.  Thanks!

This is so easy and really good. I put the pork in my slow cooker, had it on high until I went to bed, lowered the temp to low and let cook all night. In the morning before church I shredded the pork and put it back in the cooker with the BBQ sauce and left it on low. I used KC Masterpiece Original and next time will use a bolder, spicier sauce. This one was too sweet. BUT Oh YUM and so easy.

This is soooooo good!  I rubbed some garlic , salt and pepper on a pork shoulder and tossed it into the crock pot with a beef bouillon cube and some water.  It melts in your mouth!  I used "Sweet Baby Ray's" BBQ sauce.

My husband loved this.  I am not a big fan of BBQ, but I still enjoyed it.  I think it is important to use a good sauce.  Mine was not the best.  I will definently make again.  It was easy and made plenty for leftovers.  Like some others, I used a pork roast and it was still very tender as well as affordable.

This is a super simple recipe that tastes absolutely delicious!  The only thing I changed is I added a sliced onion to the crock pot.  Be sure and put the onion in the broth underneath the pork so it gets nice and tender.

Very very yummy! This was really easy and so simple. I  thought i bought boneless ribs but found out they weren't, so when they were cooking i was worried it wasnt going to work out, but it did. I used Tony Roma's honey bbq sauce and orginal as well and it turned out so yummy. Everyone loved it and leftover were really good too.

This is a really easy and delicious recipe.  I love anything that can cook itself in my crock pot!  With minimal work, I made one of my husband's favorite meals and had the leftovers the next day!  I split soft kaiser rolls, and put them under the broiler with a piece of American cheese just long enough to melt the cheese and toast teh roll.  Then I top with the BBQ Pork.  Yum!!!

I just used a regular pork roast, an inexpensive one at that.  It turned out very good and was incredibly easy.  I skipped the step of baking in the oven and just stuck the shredded pork back in the slow cooker for a hour.  Very tasty.

We get a half pig from our parents each year so I've tried many pulled pork recipes - this is my new favorite for the simple ingredients and easy preparation.

This recipe was wonderful. My whole family loved it, even my mother. I made homemade rolls to eat this on and it was great. It is definitely a keeper!

I love this recipe. The pork comes out very tender and easy to shred and the BBQ sauce doesnt get charred as it used to when I used to put it in the crock pot with the pork. Thank you for this recipe!!

This is a great recipe. I used a pork sholder. Shredding the meat took a little extra time. I just put the shredded pork back in the crock pot with the sauce for 15 mins. Turned out wonderful. It was a BIG hit for the picky 16 year old.

I thought this was decent but the sauce was too thick for my taste. I would have liked it better thinned out a bit.

very tasty!  I was cooking for a larger crowd, so I used 8lbs of bone-in pork shoulder butt, so only 1 1/2 cans of beef broth fit into the slow cooker.  Cooked it on low for 10 hours and it turned out great!

i was on a "memphis in may world championship" bbq team.  i never thought you could make bbq anyway other than on a smoker/grill.  well, i made this and it was the best pulled pork i've ever had.  i used a pork butt, and the only alteration i would make is to add about a tbsp of liquid smoke, to give it a smokier flavor.  to serve memphis style, put it on a bun and add coleslaw and a memphis style bbq sauce.  fantastic!!  i cooked it for 12 hours on low in the crock pot.

My husband is a HUGE BBQ fan and when he took his first bite he didn't even wait to swallow before he said, with his mouth full, "this is REALLY good".  I had a family size pack of boneless ribs (4.9 lbs)so I used 3 cups of beef broth and cooked on high for about 6 hours.  The meat was so tender that I could hardly get it out of the slow cooker because it kept falling apart.  Used two full bottles of bbq sauce and probably could have used a little more for those who like it really saucy.  This made a lot so I will freeze some for later. This is definitely going to be my go-to bbq pork recipe.

Made this for a quick and easy after trick-or-treating dinner.  YUMMY!  Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce (brown-sugar flavor) as suggested.  Definitely would recommend having two bottles instead of one.  Thanks for sharing this effortless recipe!

I've made this three times now.  It's so simple yet delicious.  Be sure to cook the pork until it's very tender.  Once I was short on time & only cooked my pork loin roast for 4 hrs.  The pork was not as succulent as when I cook it for 5 hrs.
My family really likes this with Famous Dave's bbq sauce.  Give this one a try--I'm certain it will become a favorite!

This is so simple to make and tastes quite good. I took others advice and added the shredded pork back into the slow cooker with the BBQ sauce for 30 minutes to warm instead of on the stove top.

These were fantastic!  The only change I made was to add a bay leaf to the beef broth.  The meat just fell apart with a fork.  Yummy!!

Wow, followed the recipe almost exactly, so good!  I had one package of boneless and one package of ribs with the bone to equal just over 3#.  It stayed in crockpot for five hours (I fell asleep) and it made no difference.   I also used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce and it was delicious.  I honestly believe it must go into the oven to really get the flavors etched into the meat. Really does seem fail-proof and it's ridiculously easy.  Hardest part was trying to find the boneless ribs for it.

This was so good and so easy!  We didn't even shred the meat - we used boneless ribs and just left them as is and dipped them in barbecue sauce (probably should have put the sauce on and thrown it in the oven - would've tasted even better!)

Yummy! We cooked it for 10 hours on low just due to not being home to put it in four hours before dinner and this sure made it ready to shread. We used Famous Dave's Devil's Spit bbq sauce which added a really nice kick to them. Perfect and we will be using this recipe again.

This makes the BEST barbeque you have ever eaten!  From NC, we know our BBQ, and this will keep us from eating it out from now on!!!  Use whichever sauce you prefer, depending on family favorite.  It is great with traditional bbq sauce as well as gold bbq sauce.  It makes over 3 pounds of bbq, and is very cost effective!!!  My family ate on this for days.  Thank you for the fast, easy and great recipe!!!

It was wonderful!  I live in the Southwest, so I'm no BBQ guru.  But it tasted like the BBQ I had during my whole trip in Memphis and when I went to Missouri.  So I was impressed!

This a favorite to make (easy) and my family loves it! When it's too hot to barbecue outside this makes up for it!
Also, gets better and better as a leftover. My only addition was a Bay Leaf to the meat and broth! MMMMM!

Easy meal that tastes great.  I did exactly what the recipe said - except I used almost 2 bottles of sauce..(just my preference).  I used one bottle of sweet BBQ sauce and about 3/4 bottle of spicy BBQ sauce.

Delicious!! Instead of cooking the pork in the oven, I emptied out the crock pot pot by straining the broth, pulled the pork apart, then put the pork back in the slow cooker with the barbeque sauce and let it heat through for about 30 minutes. Everyone loved it!

I used 3 lbs boneless pork ribs and it was incredible! I've never had any meat shred so easily. All I had to do was mash it with a fork. Leftovers were awesome too! So easy to make!

Came out great! I used a pork lion roast and sweet baby ray's BBQ sauce. I didn't put it back in the oven, I just placed it back in the crock pot for an addt'l hour or so. 

I also seasoned the meat while it was cooking the broth!

This was good, but not great.  It needed something more, but I'm not sure what.  I'm relatively new to cooking, so I'm still getting a feel for how to tweak recipes to my liking.  Overall, this was easy to make and tasted good, so I'll definitely be making it again.

OMG!!! Soo good and soo easy.I had been looking for easy recipes to use with my new slowcooker and this was it.I used the beef broth and 3 lbs of Butte Porter and let is slow cook for 4 hrs on high.I drained the broth except for about 1 cup (to keep it moist) and added Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce. It was a hit! Will defenitely be making often.

This was so easy and so delicious.  I used a high end bbq sauce with extra flavor which really added a punch.  I never use my slow cooker in the summer months, but this was a nice alternative for a quick and easy meal on a hot summer night!

Very good, but like others said no need to use an expensive cut of meat here.  Leftovers are excellent. I was hoping to freeze them for later meals, but there were none to freeze.

Really easy and yummy.  The taste is really going to depend on what BBQ sause you use.  I used the slow cooker with the beef broth and pork roast on high for 4 hours.  I then drained the broth and added the BBQ sause and shredded the meat.  Huge hit with the hubby and son.

I love simple recipes that don't involve much work but have people claiming that I'm an amazing cook. I also used a cheaper cut of meat (pork butt) and used maybe a tad less than the whole bottle of bbq sauce.  I've already passes this recipe along to several people I know.

Meat is excellent-quality of bbq sauce you use will determine how your sandwiches ultimately taste.

This was excellent.  I cooked it 10 hours on low and then shredded it and added BBQ sauce and then cooked on high for an hour.  Another great recipe to keep in the meal rotation.  If only every recipe was this easy!

This recipe worked great the way it is, I think I will try mixing the shredded pork with salsa for pork tacos/burritos.  Stays moist and tender great for hot summer meal when you don't want to use the oven.

I love the result when the pulled pork is baked in the oven with the BBQ sauce. Very tasty. I followed the recipe except I used a pork shoulder roast. A definite keeper. Thank you for the recipe!!

This meat fell apart with a fork! No need for the oven though- just throw it back in the crock pot on high until it is heated. Will make again for sure.

SOOOO easy and delicious. I used SWEET BABY RAY'S Barbecue Sauce.  Next time I will use the 28oz bottle for more sauce and cook it on top of the stove
stirring frequently.

I love the simplicity of this recipe, and it comes out perfect every time. I serve with a side of coleslaw (or add the coleslaw right to the sandwich). Great for when you are having people over and you don't a lot of time to cook. Throw it in the crock pot and let it cook while you are shopping! Enjoy..!

Made this last night and it was a big hit!!  Used 3 lbs pork butt roast which worked great in this recipe.  I used hickory smoked BBQ sauce and finished it off in the crockpot.  This is my favorite BBQ recipe by far.

This BBQ was very good, just remember to put on your favorite sauce.  I cooked the meat in the oven, it was tender, I did put extra sauce on the meat before putting in oven for 2nd time.  It was moist and very good.  Will make again.

This was easy and my husband liked it.  It seemed almost too tender to me, almost mushy.  I don't blame the recipe.  I consider myself a pretty good cook, but I've never been able to master BBQ.

The key to this recipe is choosing the right sauce.  I always make with the pork shoulder to save $$$.

This was so super and easy!  We loved it and will definitely make it again.  I didn't have any boneless pork ribs or boneless pork roasts, so I substituted pork shoulder roast and cooked it on high until it was falling off the bone tender.  I took the suggestions of the other reviews and used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  Amazing flavor and I am not even a huge pork fan.

Excellent.  My boyfriend loved it and said its the best bbq pulled sandwiches he's ever  had and he's from North Carolina.  The next day I made som brunswick stew with the leftover and that was great also, great way to have to  meals withouth so much cooking.  I seasoned the butt pork and used some garlic, and served with some kaiser rolls with coleslaw on top of it.  Great recipe, making another batch right now.

YUM! YUM! YUM! The night before I wanted to make this for dinner, I massaged the pork (I used top loin roast) with a little bit of butter and a pork rub. I popped it in the refrigerator and put it in the crockpot the next morning. I added a 14 oz can of beef broth, set the temp on low and let it do its thing. When I picked it up with a pair of tongs, it fell apart! So good and incredibly easy. Will be making this over and over again.

Great base recipe. Using suggestions in previous reviews, I used a whole pork roast, added extra broth, added time to the slow cooker, and made sure we had the barbeque sauce we liked. This was fabulous barbeque and very economical- fed our family of five twice on one roast! Thank you!

These were delicious! I made them for a group of hungry hunters and received rave reviews. I didn't change a thing.

This is a great recipe and if you have the time, just use the disposable crock pot bags so there is virtually no clean up during the 2 step process. I don't use the oven at all!!

This is the first time I've ever made BBQ and I followed the recipe exactly as provided.  My husband's constant moaning during the meal, means it will be made again and soon!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is due to the labor to shred the pork, it was actually very difficult!

So easy and super tasty.  It couldn't be any easier.  I think the bbq sauce you use could be the big determining factor for this recipe, so make sure to use one that you already know that you like.  I put my pork ribs in the slow cooker for about 7 hours on low and it was extremely easy to pull them apart.  Served on buns, and was the best pulled pork sandwiches I have ever made at home.

Worked like a charm. I did cook the pork on low for ~6 hours instead because I had errands to run. It was not difficult at all to pull the pork in how it described; it just fell apart.

This was my first time making barbecue, for a boyfriend who is quite the connoisseur, and it went over wonderfully.

I used it on sandwiches, as suggested, and also in baked potatoes.

I have made this probably a dozen times and each time my husband begs for more!  I double the recipe so we have leftovers and even those only last a day.  Thank you very much for this one!!

I used this recipe for BBQ sandwiches for a family reunion.  I used cheap chuck roasts, added broth and cooked in crock pot until falling apart.  Shredded and put in large plastic bags.  Day of reunion, added BBQ sauce, heated on top of stove and good to go!! Sooooo easy!

First, a lot depends on what sauce you pick.  Second--it looks like the ribs won't shred, but they practically did it themselves--what a great, simple recipe.  Foolishly easy.  I have made pulled pork in the past with a complicated recipe/process and this is every bit as good.

This was pretty good.  I used a pork roast and cooked all day in crock pot.  Meat was tender and made a tasty sandwich.

This recipe was great.  I used it on Easter so that we wouldn't have to cook.  I set before church and by the time we got back...had an egg hunt and spend some family time it was done.  Delicious.

Great recipe for pulled pork BBQ.  I don't use my crock pot that often, and I love it when I come across a recipe like this. It does make a lot, so I plan on freezing leftovers for a quick meal on a night I don't have a lot of time to cook.  Thanks!

I love how easy this recipe was to prepare! It didn't take the full 4 hours for the pork to finish in the crockpot, but I let it sit on low until the end time anyway and the pork turned out really nice and tender. I had an extra bottle of BBQ sauce on the table to serve with the sandwiches, and we had baked beans on the side. It was a yummy and easy meal with very few ingredients, which is very nice! It went over really well with my family. My 2-year old had a hard time holding her sandwich, but she seemed to enjoy the taste. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is easy and very tasty!!  Hubby loved it, can't wait for leftovers tomorrow.  I mixed 1/2 Honey BBQ and Reg BBQ, ended up with just the right tangy sauce.

I made this on Sunday and I was really unsure if it was going to work out. So I went to the store and got a back up. It was a hit! It was so easy and tasted so good! I will defiantly keep this one!
