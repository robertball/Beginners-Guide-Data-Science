Mmmmmm.. Absolutely wonderful.  The best I've had in a long time.  I substituted about 1 1/2 tbsp of dill relish for the pickle (to simplify the recipe) and used my decorator ball to fill the eggs.  You get a VERY generous amount of filling!!  I topped them with paprika and a sliced black olives.  They looked and tasted wonderful!  

If you have guests that don't like onion, you may want to substitute a bit of onion powder instead just to give it a bit more flavor.  Don't pass this recipe up!

I used a tablespoon of my own homemade dry ranch seasoning mix (combined with a couple tablespoons each of reduced fat mayonnaise and reduced fat sour cream), reduced fat cream cheese and I added a little fresh ground pepper and a dash of Frank's Hot Sauce. This is one of the best deviled eggs my family has ever had. As I was making them and setting the filled egg halves on the plate, my family was shoving them in their mouths. This recipe's a keeper.

OMG, this recipe was to die for and was a big hit at Thanksgiving.  I made a batch of this recipe and a batch of the regular deviled eggs and guess which ones went first...next time I'm only making this recipe.  2 Thumbs Up!

I loved these-so tired of the Same Old Deviled Eggs every time!  My husband, on the other hand hated them, but he's the type that WANTS everything to taste just like his mother made it for the last 100 years... 
I took these to a church function and was asked if I'd TRADE the very few leftovers (out of 5 dozen) for the leftover Honey Ham!  I'd say they liked them!!
In making so many, however, I did have to reduce the proportions of dressing and sour cream from the scaled amounts (and fewer onions for my own taste plus some fresh ground pepper) to keep it yummmy but not ovewhelming. Thanks for this recipe!

Made them for a neighboorhood picnic and everyone really liked the light, creamy taste!  Also, I garnished the eggs with paprika and slices of black olive.

These was okay... too many onions for my liking.  I brought them to Thanksgiving dinner (one of three varieties) - had much more of these left than the other two I made.

I can't say enough about this recipe.  Tried these the first time about a 1 1/2 years ago - big hit - all gone within an hour.  It has become a standard for any get togethers in our home.  Family members ALWAYS request them.  Had them as an appetizer for Thanksgiving today and I didn't even get to have one.  Great recipe - thanks!

Suberb!! An excellent alternative to ordinary deviled eggs! They disappeared at the picnic! I can't think of a better way to make eggs!

These weren't great.  The consistency was not to my liking, even with the pickle and onion chopped finely, and the onion was overpowering, despite the fact that I put in less than 1/2 c.  I don't think the ranch went well with the yolk, either, so I've got a plateful of deviled eggs in the fridge that no one in my family will eat.  The recipe sounded good, but unfortunately didn't end up well.

Simple and delicious. I made the following alterations: omitted the onion, added a Tbsp mayo to make it less dry. I topped each with a slice of olive and paprika. To save time in the future, I might replace the pickles with straight vinegar. For Easter, serve on a nice egg plate with pretty plastic eggs or dyed eggs mixed in for fun.

I made these as part of our Super Bowl fare. I personally would have given them a 3 because I prefer the more traditional egg but they were the first thing to go on a table of many choices -

I had mixed reviews on these eggs.  Half my party loved them and the others thought they were just ok.  I liked them so from now on I'll probably do half my eggs the traditional way and the other half like this.

I don't like deviled eggs and thought I'd try this for my hubby's sake, sans onion and pickle.  I actually ate one, which is saying alot.  My husband liked them, so that is his star rating.

I just made these since my Miracle whip was gone and I don't like mayo. I didn't have dill pickles, but I added horseradish. B/f tasted it right after filling the eggs and he said its the best filling he has ever had. I am sure it will get even better after refridgerating them for a while!  :)

I have never cared for Deviled Eggs, because I do not like mayo, mustard, or pickled relish. I now can enjoy what everyone else have been raving about. This recipe was very tasty to me.  I did add a little extra ranch dressing and my family, who all enjoy the traditional recipe, loved these as well.

I really liked this recipe...the yolk mixture was very light and creamy.  I did put a little twist on it, by using sweet relish, and bacon ranch salad dressing.  They turned out great.

Fabulous. I added 4 tablespoons of homemade salsa to the cream cheese and mixed well. Then I added all the other stuff and it was a huge hit. Thanks for the recipe!! It's a keeper.

I was expecting more after reading all of the reviews.  They were pretty good when I first made them, but seemed to be missing something. After I put them in the refrigerator the onions seemed to become stronger and overpowered the taste.

I have just finished making this recipe for guests tonight.  It is easy and the other reviews are right, it makes lots of filling, even enough leftover to taste; yummy! I am a big fan of ranch dressing so this is great.  Thanks

These are a staple in our house for every holiday dinner.  The only thing I changed is the onion bits, I use onion powder instead and also halved the recipe.

Ended up having to make egg salad out of it due to this being the first time I ever hard boiled eggs, and I tweaked the recipe a little bit. I left out the onion, but used Onion & Chive cream cheese. Also instead of Dill pickles, I used chopped up Gherkins. I also added a little mustard power for the sake of the traditional recipe. My husband and I absolutely love it! Its different, and if you're really unsure of it, make a small test batch.

A nice alternative to my regular recipe.  I'd cut down on the onion next time I make them, though.

Good.  Nice to have something different that the usual deviled eggs.  However, there is way too much onion in this.  Cut back.  Also needed to add black pepper for extra flavour.

Consistency was perfect for piping. I made the recipe per instructions, except using onion powder instead of onions, I also sprinkled eggs with chili powder. It was a little too ranchy until I topped them with the chili powder, evening out the flavors.

This recipe was very good.  We were a bit hesitant to stray from using mustard so we added a bit of dijon.

These are SO yummy! Made as stated, they are great - even better and better for you with these alterations: use neufatel cheese and low fat ranch, I use a bit less onion and add a tiny squirt of mustard, top half with sliced olives and half with sliced green onions then place on lettuce or spinach leaves for a beautiful presentation!

I thought these were very good. My husband hates all deviled eggs so he refused to even try them (hard-headed), but me and my twin two year old toddlers loved them. There were 12 egg halves and no leftovers.

Really a great recipe!  I halved the recipe for a small 4th of July gathering.  My husband loved them.  The texture was great for filling the whites.  Next time I make them I will add dry ranch dressing instead of the prepared ranch dressing, cracked black pepper, sweet pickles (rather than dill) and a little sweet pickle juice (just enough to get the texture necessary for filling the whites), and a slice of stuffed green olive for presentation.

These eggs were a great change from the ordinary recipe!  (If you are very picky about liking the usual recipe with mustard, mayo, etc, these might not be for you.)  I thought these were Soooo good!  I used dill relish instead of chopped pickle to save on time, still tastes the same.  Also used only 1 tbsp very finely chopped onion for the onion flavor.  I will make these every year!  New favorite!

These were a good change from the usual deviled egg recipes you usually make.  I used green onion instead of regular onion, and added about 1/2 cup of ranch dressing.  I also used sweet pickle relish instead of pickles.  Took them to a New Year's Eve Party and everyone really liked them.  Didn't come home with any leftovers.  Will make again.

These had a lot stronger flavor thirty minutes after I made them than twenty-four hours later, when we finished them up.  I advise making them ahead of when you want to eat them, as they were almost too strong (for my taste) right away.

Very good recipe.  Although I did do a few things different.  First of all I used a little more Ranch dressing about 2 or 3 tablespoons.  In our house Ranch is a food group.  Also I used some onion powder instead of the actual onion so it would not be so over bearing.

This recipe was pretty good. I added a little mustard for tang, and less onion.  Next time I'll add more pickle.  The cream cheese was a little thick and made them slightly bland.

These were a hit at my holiday party; they tasted great and were a little different from the standard deviled eggs. However, I gave it 4 stars because I had to add some mustard for moisture, because they were a little crumbly...

Yuck.  I didn't like these at all.  Next time I'll just eat my hard boiled eggs plain.  The combination of egg and ranch wasn't my favorite.

This was a nice change from the standard deviled eggs.  I used instant minced onions and only half of what the recipe called for.  They get softer and have less of a twang than real onions.  My kids liked the change and said would do them again sometime along with the standard deviled eggs.  No problem for me, these were good.

I liked em- but didn't love em. I don't care for crunchy onions in there. Used 2 T. dill relish.(easier) I did like the consistency. But a little too "cream cheesy." Maybe add a small amount of vinegar/mustard. I'm stll searching for the perfect deviled egg recipe!

I have to say I was rather dissapointed with this recipe.  To me the eggs had very little flavor and were quite plain.  They definitely need to be dressed up with some spices or something.  For now I'll be sticking with my usual recipe for deviled eggs.

Will never make them any other way!  Everyone raved and wanted the recipe.  I used 2 pickles because I love them and thought added crunch would be good.  I had left over cruched pecans from another dish so I sprinkled a few crumbs over them.  Thanks for the huge success!

This was wonderful.  I made it precisely as the recipe said the first time, and they were a hit.  The second time I left out the pickles and substituted horseradish and mayo mix.  It was also wonderful.  I love the cream cheese addition to the filling!

I guess I'm a die hard fan of classic deviled eggs because I don't think I'd make them again.  Thankfully I only made 3 eggs to try them to see if I wanted to make a whole dozen for our thanksgiving dinner this weekend.

I made these for my husband and he loved them. Gobbled them all up. I didn't use the onions and I did add some "slap ya momma" spices. This is a great recipe and will make again for another holiday or event.

I made these for Easter and thought they were a little bland.  The cream cheese didn't add anything but empty calories and my family thought the ranch was weird.  I didn't add onion but don't think it would've made a difference.  I'll stick with a classic recipe from now on

Although a lot of other people liked these deviled eggs, I didn't care for them very much at all, and neither did my boyfriend.  We did not like the pickle taste in the filling. When I filled the egg whites with it, they were very messy looking; not a good presentation at all.  The filling was runny, and when I tried to pipe it into the egg whites,it would not hold shape from the large star tip.
I don't even know why I'm giving this recipe 2 stars, but I am.  I'll have to find another deviled egg recipe that suits my taste.

I thought this was good, but I altered a little....I used a little less ranch dressing,  less cream cheese, some dill pickle relish, a dash of dijon mustard, and garlic powder, onion powder, celery salt, and fresh ground pepper to taste....and paprika and a black olive slice for presentation...kind of a mixture of other reviews, but it seems to work....one of those recipes that each person needs to adjust to their own taste.

These were very easy to make.  I used about half the amount of onion it called for and used a combination of sweet relish and regular relish instead of the chopped pickle.  I also topped them with a sprig of fresh dill.  Everyone said they were good.  I personally hate eggs, so I'm going by what they said :)

These are amazing. I never thought about using ranch dressing for deviled eggs. We just left the onion out. We aren't onion people. It was still scrumptious.

I made these with just a touch of Ranch and no onions. came out thick but i scooped the yolk mix with a cookie scooper and garnished with a half black olive on top of each. I'll definitely make these again, as I don't much like salad dressing.

These eggs got rave reviews from my family! I did have to substitute dry ranch dressing mix and sour cream for ranch dressing (didn't have dressing mixed up) and I added extra dill (1/2 tsp or so) but otherwise followed the recipe.

I ran out of mayo and looked up recipes for deviled eggs without it to fulfill my craving.  I didn't add the onions, but I followed the rest of the directions.  I really like the wasabi and regular kind, but to me, the cream cheese, ranch combo just tasted like a regular deviled egg gone bad.  I hope I didn't develop a taste aversion to deviled eggs, because I sure love the regular kind!
