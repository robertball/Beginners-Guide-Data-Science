These taste ok--especially if you're a fan of whole grain flavor. The problem with these is that 10 minutes is nowhere near long enough soak time for the steel cut oats. Even after soaking and baking for 20 minutes, the oats were solid. So I would either cook the steel cut oats until softened before using, or simply substitute rolled oats. And if you're not a fan of just the whole grain flavoring, I would definitely add in a teaspoon of vanilla extract or some cinnamon/nutmeg/allspice/cloves to up the flavor ante. I would also add more prunes--probably chopped instead of pureed--and use maple syrup in place of white sugar next time. Overall, I would make these again, but with adjustments.
