A very refreshing drink! I used Club Soda. It dilutes the juice and cuts the sweetness, while the bubbles refresh.The Club Soda is great to use with all flavors of fruit juice. Thanks Kara.

Great non-alcoholic drink, but of course I couldn't resist adding a shot of vodka to liven it up!

I have never in my life experienced a more wonderful drink! My kids are in love with it, and insist on drinking it everyday! I can't argue since it is so healthy. If it weren't so simple, I'd have thought a genius invented it. It has a perfect amount of everything! It made a difference in my life, and it can do the same for you.

If you want to cut the sweetness in a fruit juice, try this. I didn't notice any fizz, it just tasted like watered down juice.

The recipe submitter suggested we try this recipe using lemonade instead of cranberry juice, so I did. I like it. The carbonated water cuts the tartness and sweetness of the lemonade.

I didn't care for this.  It made me think of cranbery juice that has been diluted w/ melted ice. It would be okay for a kiddie cocktail I suppose.
