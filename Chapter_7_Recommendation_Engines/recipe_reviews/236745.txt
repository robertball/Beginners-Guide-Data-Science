This is an egg dish I make often and am very familiar with.  Guess I’ve been eating eggs prepared like this all my life!  (I’ve made converts of those who are suspicious of garlic in scrambled eggs!)  Today I had no mozzarella, so Cheddar filled in and I always prefer using butter in this instance rather than olive oil.  I also prefer the tomatoes sliced and on the side rather than in the eggs, but it’s good either way.  This is a breakfast you can eat and feel you’ve done your body good (as opposed to the ever and always delicious and tempting pancakes, Belgian waffles with strawberries and whipped cream, coffee cake, biscuits and sausage gravy, French toast, donuts, stratas, hash browns, cinnamon rolls, etc.)

Love this dish.  Made for dinner tonight.  A couple of minor tweeks we love mushrooms so I diced up 3 and add them with the onions to fry up.  Instead of using mozzarella I used fresh buratta cheese which is like soft mozzarella but has a cream centre.  Thank you for sharing this wonderful dish.

Hubby said these were the best eggs I've ever made. He doesn't care for onions or mushrooms and I didn't have garlic, so I omitted those and used about 1/8 tsp of garlic pepper in place of the salt. Seemed like a lot of oil; I used non-stick spray instead. Had shredded cheddar jack on hand, so subbed it in for the mozzerella. Used 4 extra large eggs minus one yolk, and it yielded more than the two of us could finish. So good, and it does look fancy!

This was simply delicious.  The only changes that I made was I used almond milk instead of regular milk.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used Hunt's diced tomatoes. I also omitted the spinach because I just didn't have it.  But will make again with spinach.  Thank you!!!!

I made this yesterday morning. I might add more tomatoes next time. I used a mix of mozzarella, Romano, Asiago, and Parmesan cheeses. Not only is it delicious, but it looks pretty when served.

I really liked it as a nice departure from the typical egg with mushrooms. I do however have to say that lacking a few ingredients which resulted on cutting off calories, did not make this recipe uninteresting at all. I only had parmesan so I used it to replace the mozzarella and I also did not have spinach so I used a few fresh basil leaves. This was absolutely delicious and totally worth it!

Delicious.  I used regular sliced tomatoes instead.  They didn’t hold hold together but the presentation was still appealing.

Really good.  Watch your veggies - be sure to let them release all/most of their moisture.  I made for 1 - just clicked the serving reduction, however I kept the veggies amount the same so that it was really nutrient packed. Will definitely make this again!

Very good.  Did make a couple changes (I know, I know, so not the same recipe) but stuck pretty close.  I left the mushrooms out as I cannot stand mushrooms and I used a shredded mix of itaian cheeses and doubled the cheese but only used 3 eggs for the two of us (6 eggs for two servings? wow).

What a delicious breakfast and looks so fancy too! Such an easy recipe to add more or less of what you happen to like.
