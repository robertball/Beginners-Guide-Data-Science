Pretty good.  I used plain cream cheese and added garlic salt as well as mushrooms and diced onions. Really good flavor. Put it on top of noodles and there you go.

This was good, not great.  As much as I love pork, I think the flavor would have been better with chicken.

This was awesome with a few changes! We used chicken instead of pork, and the store didn't have herb and garlic cream, so we used a small tub of the italian herbs and cheese, and a small tub of the savory garlic, and mixed it together. 

Overall, this was fantastic, the whole family loved it!

We really liked this!  Very simple.  I used Balsamic Vinegar instead of the salad dressing.  Didn't have Herb and Garlic Cream Cheese so instead used about 6 oz of regular cream cheese, and then added basil, rosemary, oregano, thyme, marjoram and garlic. Served over pasta.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe! I soaked some dried thyme in oil for about an hour and then used that to fry the pork, and I left out the basil as I didn't have any. The parmesan cheese was a little overpowering; I recommend using about half of the suggested amount. The end result, even with a little too much cheese, was delicious! Would definitely make again.
