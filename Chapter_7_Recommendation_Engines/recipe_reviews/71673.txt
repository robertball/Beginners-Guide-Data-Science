I would actually put this between 3 and 4 stars, but I'll rate it 4 for the potential. I made this recipe as directed using red peppers. It's a great idea, but it just seemed to be missing some "umph". I added a little more pesto and some salt and it helped, but I'm still not satisfied (but I'm a perfectionist with cooking :) I wonder if the Sun Dried Tomatoes would have been a better option than the red peppers to get that extra flavor it needed?!  The crackers may matter too. I ate it with Multigrain Wheat Thins and then tried it with some new Colby Cheese Wheat Thins and for some reason the flavors of the dip came out a lot more with the Colby ones. It was still not perfect, but a lot better. Also I used a hand blender to mix it a little better b/c it was too chunky for me.

Really easy and very tasty.  I added a jar of sundried tomato pesto instead of basil pesto.  Great change from regular homous

YUM! Don't change a thing... I did it with the Sun Dried Tomatoes and no red peppers.
