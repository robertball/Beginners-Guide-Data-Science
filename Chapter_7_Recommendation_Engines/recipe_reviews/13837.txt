My family and I actually had a contest who could make the best leftover turkey, and I won with this recipe. I did make a few changes...I add 1/2 cup sour cream to the cheese and onion mixture, I took someone's advice and cooked the turkey on medium heat in water and taco seasoning, I also added a small can of green chiles to the cheese mixture, which I sauteed with the onions before adding to the enchiladas. I also used corn tortillas. These were delicious!

I thought these were delicious.  I did make a few changes, and used what was on hand.  I took the turkey, shredded it and boiled it in taco seasoning, onions, and water for an hour.  It turned out moist and tender and very flavorful.  I also used flour tortillas and made my own enchilada sauce. Turned out very yummy!  Thanks

My wife loved this recipe.  She said they were the best enchiladas she has ever eaten.  I added about 1 1/2 cup sour cream to the turkey and onion mixture and used flour tortillas instead of corn.  This has become our new post-Thanksgiving tradition.

As written, this would have been quite bland for us, however, the basic recipe was a great use of my leftover roasted chicken. I added canned green chiles, mexican seasonings and refried beans to my chicken mixture. I didn't dip my tortillas in the enchilada sauce either, but just poured the sauce on the bottom of the pan and over the enchiladas. The end result was delicious. Thanks Marta!

Very good.  I did spice up the turkey with some garlic powder, chili powder and cumin.  Also added some chopped green chilies.  Definately need 2 cans of sauce - I used one can mild and one can 'hot' and add a little extra garlic powder, onion powder and chili powder to the sauce.  This is the best way to use up left-over turkey!

This was very simple, but I had to make a few small changes. It turned out to be dry so I just added a second can of sauce, 2 more cups of cheese, and more onion. I also did not roll the tortillas in the sauce the second time...I poured sauce in bottom of dish and again between each layer of tortillas. Also, add a few seasonings or may taste a bit bland. My family loved them!

I used Costco carnitas instead of turkey, and taco-size flour tortillas.  I threw about half the enchalada sauce into the filling as well, just for seasoning.  Since there was less sauce in the dish now, I covered it before cooking. Came out great.  Rarely do my wife and I agree on meals, but this one is good.

This sounds like an awesome recipe as written and I really wanted to try it.  That being said, I was too burned out on cooking after Thanksgiving to stand there and individually heat and roll all of those enchiladas so I made some adjustments.  Instead, I used the shells to make an enchilada lasagna. For the filling, I added 1 cup of both sour cream & green chilies to the original recipe. I didn't bother to heat the shells since I wasn't rolling them.  I put sauce in the bottom of a 13X9 pan, then a layer of 6 overlapping shells, more sauce to cover the shells, 1/2 the filling, repeat to end with shells and sauce on top.  I topped it with more cheese and baked for 30 minutes at 375. Lazy, but delicious.

Excellent! I have to say that this is probably the best recipe I have made with our leftover Thanksgiving turkey. I shredded the turkey and simmered it in a pot with a little water and some taco seasoning and onions before stuffing the tortillas. It was absolutely delicious.

This was yummy way to use last of turkey leftovers. I cooked the onions and green chillies together and added the chopped turkey, taco seasoning & half cup of sour cream. Then filled each tortilla with the turkey mixture, cheese & topped with sauce, cheese & olives. Served with fresh guacamole and beans it was a great Sunday night football meal.

This was very tasty. But I did fudge with the recipe a little bit.
I heated up the turkey with a jar of medium salsa and a couple Tablespoons of Cream of Onion Soup. I Sauteed onions with some fresh mushrooms add some red pepper and paprika then added it to the turkey. I used Green Chili Enchilada sauce and a shredded mexican cheese mixture.

Ok but needs to be jazzed up. Add some spice and other fresh veggies. I used two cans of enchilada sauce and felt that was enough. One can would be to little. Good for leftovers.

These are good but the turkey needs a little salt and another can of sauce would be helpful.

SOOOOOO Good! I tweaked it just a bit.  I will make it short. - Cooked the meat for about 4 hours on low in about 2 cups water with some cumin and chili powder. (to taste) Drained. added diced raw onion, pepper, 1 cup cheese and can of diced tomato. Finished the rest of the recipe per the directions. Used flour tortillas and a large can of green enchilada sauce.  We have a new tradition in our house!  I look forward to this now!  Thanks!

This was yummy.  Used the same ingredients plus sour cream, cumin and chili powder but prepared differently.  Sauteed onions in olive oil.  When slightly cooled, mixed with half cup light sour cream, tex mex cheese mixture, turkey and a few shakes of cumin.  Rolled into flour tortillas.  Enchilada sauce on bottom of dish and on top of enchiladas. Omitted olives cuz I don't like them.  Sprinkled a bit more cheese and chili powder on top. Very fast and easy to prepare and absolutely divine.  Thank You.

I really liked the idea of this recipe for using up my leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Instead of rolling the filling in the tortillas, I just layered the casserole "chiliquiles-style" (sauce, torn tortillas, filling, sauce torn tortillas, filling, sauce. I ended with a filling & sauce layer, then sprinkled a bit of shredded cheese over the top before baking). I also added some leftover red salsa and a can of diced green chilies to the filling mixture. The results were perfectly acceptable (my husband and I liked it, the kids didn't because they hate all casseroles). Note: It might be prettier rolled into enchiladas.

I used some of the suggestions on the reviews (such as putting some of the sauce on the bottom of the baking pan instead of dredging the tortillas) and it turned out great. I did modify it to the point that it may as well be a different recipe, though... I sauteed my veggies first and added one roma tomato, one jalapeno, and half a 6 oz can of olives, chopped - a healthy pinch of paprika, cumin, and chili powder - a smidge of salsa, and sauteed all that with the turkey and mixed in the cheese once off the heat (All 2 cups worth). I also topped the enchiladas with a little extra cheddar and the last half of the can of olives. For anyone complaining about the blandness of this recipe, try it this way and your taste buds will be dancing in delight!

Very delicious, and good use of leftover turkey.  I mixed the turkey, with the onion and 3/4 of the cheese, then spooned onto the "sauced" tortillas. Placed enchiladas on a cookie sheet to make only a single layer of enchiladas.  Lastly, I topped the enchiladas with the olives and remaining cheese and baked as directed.  Served with rice, beans and shredded lettuce (dressed with oil and vinegar) makes a fine Mexican meal.

I thought this was a good recipe - I used it as inspiration.  I started with ground turkey, and browned it with 1/2 c of onion, 1 tsp cumin, 1/2 tsp each paprika and chili powder and 1/4 tsp black pepper and some salt.  Once it was browned I added some green enchilada sauce (canned) and then rolled the mixture in 10 white corn tortillas, topping with more enchilada sauce and a little bit of cheese.  Baked 20 minutes at 350 and they were yummy.

You can make these lovely enchiladas in even less time if you not only use canned enchilada sauce, but instead of rolling each enchilada individually, you can layer them in a 9x13 pan....pour some sauce in the bottom, put one layer down, a little more sauce on the tortillas, then put your turkey, olives, cheese, top with another tortilla layer, sauce, turkey, chopped green chilis, cheese, last layer of tortillas, sauce and cheese to top it off......delicious, quick and easy...enjoy.

I omitted the black olives, cooked the onion with the turkey and taco seasoning and water.  it all came out great.  I used the green chili enchilada sauce which went really great with the turkey.  I made some with corn and some with flour tortillas and both came out tasting great.  excellent use for leftover turkey!!!! YUMMY!!

I'm sure a different brand of tortillas, and sauce might make a difference, but I won't be finding out because I won't be making this again.

So easy and delicious!  My modifications were made really for what I had available.  I had no black olives (my fave!) so I added a can of Ro-Tel.  Also added a bit of garlic and a dash of Chili and Cumin.  They turned out pretty hot (for me - husband loved them!) but they were really amazingly delicious!  Best use of turkey leftovers ever!

Totally loved this recipe.. Makes a TON of enchiladas!! I can't imagine though how the original poster used just a 19oz can of enchilada sauce. I went though most of a 28 oz can just dipping the fried tortillas and then used the rest of that can and half of a 19oz one to top everything off before cooking. One thing I didn't do is chop the onions fine enough. They aren't going to cook, so make sure the onion bits are little..

These were great - our family prefers green enchilada sauce, so I used that instead, but they were really good - a fabulous way to use up leftover turkey in a different way.

Yummy, classic enchiladas! I followed the suggestion of other reviewers and used twice the amount of enchilada sauce called for. I didn't think this recipe needed extra spice -- I liked the mild flavor of the dish, it's comfort food at its best.

Very good and easy. I never would have thought to use turkey leftovers in an enchilada. I omitted the step of dipping the tortillas in the sauce and put some in the bottom of the baking dish and poured it over the layers.  Next time I will use 2 jars of sauce as it was a little dry.

With some changes make it a 5!  Since I found this recipe making enchiladas is  a post Thanksgiving tradition for my family.    Not quite your authentic enchiladas but without a doubt it is definitely a winner in the family  WITH these few changes: 

1. Boil  the turkey for a few minutes, it moistens the turkey well
2. Re-season the meat with chili powder, garlic powder, and cumin.  Be generous.
3. Serve over lettuce and fresh tomatoes and sour cream. 
4. Add a few rings of jalapenos on top.
5. And yes, you will need more cans of enchilada sauce. 

You can use regular tortillas if you dont have the corn ones. It still comes out great. 

AND you can cook this in an iron skillet over the stove if you wish, it cooks well like that too.

This is a great recipe for using leftover turkey. I warmed my tortillas in the microwave to save time, but otherwise I followed this recipe exactly. My onions didn't soften, and I didn't like the crunch, so next time I might try cooking the turkey with the onion before filling the tortillas or maybe using green onion. I will definitely make again next time I have leftover turkey.

Great and so easy!  Used a homemade enchilada sauce that I had frozen and omitted the black olives.  Also added refried beans to stretch the turkey a bit more.  Was so yummy!  Will definitely make again.

I unfortunately did not think these were good -- they tasted like turkey with enchilada sauce on it -- which was not so appealing to me and my family.  This may just be because we just don't like turkey very much and I should just accept that we're going to throw it out after Thanksgiving!

Lower calorie version ~ I used taco seasoning to give the turkey some flavor.  I also microwaved the corn tortillas in a damp paper towel for 1 min instead of cooking them in oil.  I also poured some (heated)enchilada sauce in the bottom of the pan instead of dipping the tortillas in the sauce.  Very Tasty!

This turned out ok. I took the advice of other reviewers and simmered my turkey in taco seasoning but it didn't help as much as I would have liked. I think there is only so much you can do with turkey.

Boyfriend loved this. Had trouble frying the tortillas so skipped that part.  Hey...it worked out ok.  Perhaps I was supposed to use the hard tortillas; mine were soft corn tortillas and they fell apart.  But very good recipe anyway.

These were exceptional, but I definitely changed it to suit my tastes. I started out by sauteing onion, red bell pepper, and jalapeno. Then I cooked the turkey meat in the veggies, adding cumin, salt and pepper. I also fried the corn tortillas and dipped them as suggested, they were really good that way! Best homemade enchiladas I've had yet.

As written I give this recipe a 3, but with a few changes I'd give it at least a 4. I like a lot more flavor in meat fillings that just plain roasted turkey, so I cooked a few chicken breasts in the crockpot with some salsa which helped the flavor a lot. To do this, put a bit of jarred salsa on the bottom, frozen breasts over that, and poured a bit more salsa on the top. About 14 oz. salsa total. Cooked on low for 6 hours, and shredded with a fork - the chicken was super moist and tender with a good flavor. I also like a lot more olives than called for in the recipe, so I tripled the amount. I find that the Old El Paso brand (medium spicy) is a national brand that has good flavor and works well in this recipes. For the most authentic taste don't precook the onions - just chop them finely. Definitely serve with shredded (romaine or iceburg) lettuce, chopped tomatoes, sour cream, and avocado slices, if you've got them. It makes SUCH a difference. Thanks for the base recipe!

We varied by adding 4 or 5 green onions, 1 whole jalepeno and we used larger tortillas.  We also added fresh avacado for extra fat and flavor.  We skipped the cooking in oil and dipping in sauce steps.  We made 8 STUFFED enchiladas and loved them.  This makes a great left over dish as well.

Having never made enchiladas before I was a little scared. I used all of the ingredients plus added green chilies and salsa verde. While adding the filling to the tortillas, I drizzled a little enchilada sauce in it, then folded enchilada and placed in baking dish. I also used a combination of montery jack and sharp cheddar cheese to top it with. My husband who doesn't like "Mexican" food just loved it.

The enchiladas were very dry - you definitely need to use 2 cans of sauce.  We also found them to be extremely bland.  They need something to spice them up.  We won't be making them again.

Wonderful! great even as leftovers, if you are lucky enough to have some left. Flavors are authentic. I used more black olives.

I used this as a base, and did boil the turkey in a water and taco seasoning. I added refried beans in the mix. Then poured the sauce in the bottom and the top. I used flour tortillas. It was excellent. Would have been too plain for us without the spices that's why I didn't give 5 stars

As written, this was entirely too much work for a bland dish. I tried it a second time, sauteing the turkey and onions with garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, chopped bell pepper and 1 chopped jalapeno. Added the other ingredients, along with a 1/2 cup sour cream, and used 2 cans of enchilada sauce. These adjustments bring it up to 4 stars.

I followed many of the suggestions here:  I heated the turkey in water with taco seasoning for 1/2 hour, added plain greek yogurt to the cheese mixture, added 1/2 small can diced green chiles.  Finally, I was also too lazy to heat each tortilla and roll them, so I made a casserole as suggested and it was wonderful.  Will make again, definitely.  Best use of leftover turkey, IMO.  Excellent recipe!!

This was okay. Nothing to write home about. I cooked the onions before adding them to the mix, and seasoned the turkey somewhat liberally with taco seasoning. I also added refried beans to the mix and left out the olives (don't care for them), and green sauce. I feel like this recipe would be so much better if only it had that one thing. Can't put my finger on what, though..

Fabulous!-With a twist. This was absolutely de-licious and very filling!! I used this recipe as a good base. I cooked-down the turkey in 2 packs of taco seasoning, 1 onion, garlic and about 2 cups water for about 1/2 hour (this lets the seasoning work in, so the turkey isn't so bland). I also added tomatoes, black beans and jalapenos in addition to the cheese mixture for the filling. I used whole wheat flax wraps and didn't dip them before I wrapped it up. I just shredded marble cheese and olives on top (since I didn't want the melted cheese too onion-y). They were perfect and I was very happy I found a great alternative recipe for my turkey left-overs besides soup! :)

I used 2 cans green chili sauce instead of 1 red. sauteed the onions, added turkey and 1/2 pouch taco season with 1/2 c water for the meat mixture.  I also added about a Tbsp refried beans to the shell before adding the cheese and meat.  This is a great recipe for left over Turkey and I can't wait to use other meats too!

Tasted good, not sure about the red sauce I used. I purchased Las Palmas Enchiladas sauce. I added little less olives because my family doesn't like them. I added a little more cheese. My kids were not thrilled either way. They didn't go for seconds :)

Enchiladas are such a great vessel for all sorts of leftovers: turkey, chicken, pot roast, brisket, chili, taco soup - the list goes on and on! You can make them as spicy as you like by adding jalapenos or chipotle peppers in adobo sauce or even crushed red pepper. This recipe is a great base for many many leftovers!

A great way to use leftover turkey, but I've had better enchiladas. I didn't care for the enchilada sauce, next time will probably just make my own. :)

These were great and very quick and easy even with frying and dipping the tortilla's. I shredded the turkey and simmered it with a package of Chi Chi's taco seaoning, I also put the olives on after with scallions because not everyone on my family eats them. I added black beans as well....definately a keeper.

I had to make some changes to use what I had on hand and tried to incorporate some of the comments.  I gave the turkey, olives, sauteed onion, and cheese (1/2 mexican blend and 1/2 pepperjack) a whirl in my food processor with 1/2 cup of water and a few Tblsp of taco seasoning.  I just pulsed it -- not a puree!  Then I used 2 cans of enchilada sauce, one on the bottom of the pan and one over the top of the rolled enchiladas. I did not have time to heat/dip the tortilla shells.  I forgot to add more cheese to the top.  Good flavor. Served with sour cream and lettuce.  I think some black beans would've been good, too.  For the turkey, I used a leftover rotisserie turkey breast.  Good flavor, but I wanted some more zip. Maybe some green onions on top when I heat up my leftovers?

This was really good as a base recipe.  I used a 20 oz of sauce.  I mixed the turkey in a pot with a package of taco seasoning, about 1/2 cup sour cream, cheese, and a can of medium hatch chiles.  I didnt fry the corn tortillas in oil, just heated the enchilada sauce in a skilled and warmed them in the sauce before stuffing each one.  Next time I may just layer it flat.  Topped with the rest of enchilada sauce and cheese before baking, and sour cream before serving.

Fist off, I'm not a fan of corn tortillas so I made these with low-carb flour tortillas.  I decided to roll them instead of layer and prefered this much more.  I also used a mexican blend of cheese that had spices mixed in and this really helped perk up the flavor.  Over all, I enjoyed this meal.  My husband loved it and they smell great cooking.

I made these the day after Thanksgiving and my husband is still talking about them.  I made it more like a casserole (layerd the tortillas) instead of making them individually.  It was easier for me that way.  Turned out great!

I made really only one change, I added 8 oz. of cream cheese and 3/4 cup sour cream to the turkey mixture. I used a 29 oz, can of sauce (some on the bottom of pan) and it was enough to cover everything.  It was okay, but I went from a little leftover turkey to a pan of enchiladas.

Yum!  Thank goodness for another option on Thanksgiving leftovers.  You have to love turkey to want these, though.  The Mexi-flavor doesn't cover the strong turkey taste and my 8 year old passed on it.

Excellent use of leftover turkey.  Added some jalepenos to the turkey before assembling enchiladas and heated in microwave. My teenage sons loved it.

I added red bell pepper to turkey mixture. And more cheese on top. I had left over filling which I baked in ramekins. They were a great lunch on their own without Tortillas.

These were delicious!! I am not a turkey fan but I loved these enchiladas. My family gobbled these up. HA! I topped the enchiladas with diced tomatoes, peppers, onions, avocado & sour cream. Great way to use up leftover turkey from thanksgiving. Definitely going to make this again!

I cut the recipe in half (except for the black olives which we like), and the enchiladas came out well.  I prefer a green sauce, and will use it next time.  Good way to use leftover turkey.

I hope this tastes good. I see that most commenters did some fiddling with the recipe, which I didn't. My concern is I made half a recipe, and only had enough filling for four six inch corn tortillas. Certainly not enough ingredients for 24!!  So, beware. I know I won't use this one again, but I did want something different for the Thanksgiving leftovers.

Really delicious. Best use ever of leftover turkey. I used less cheese, maybe 4 or 5 oz, made 10 enchiladas, with flour tortillas. 

I’ll make this again for sure.

I made the most common changes suggested in other reviews. It was okay. It wasn't big on my family's taste buds, but it just might be that we might not like canned enchiladas sauce. (I am unsure since this is the first time I've tried this recipe and the first time I've had enchiladas sauce from a can. ) I might try it once more with homemade enchiladas sauce.

I made this with the leftover turkey breast from the slow cooker turkey breast recipe from this site. It was truly a fantastic and tasty recipe > I have made it with corn tortillas and flour tortillas. It was a wonderful recipe both ways. I also added some salsa and cheese to the chicken mixture to address  what some are saying is dry in the middle. Again this recipe is a 5 without any changes what so ever!

Excellent, I used some of the suggestions from the reviews and spiced it up a little more. I've never made Enchiladas before and this was really simple and a heck of a lot better than another bowl of Turkey soup!!!! NO BRAINER

Great way to use up leftover turkey! The only change I made was to pour some of the sauce on the bottom of the greased 9x13 dish before placing the enchiladas in it.

My husband goes for the ham at our Thanksgiving Table as he's not a turkey fan. After trying this leftover turkey recipe, however, he's calling me Queen of the Kitchen!i made modifications based on others' reports:  Pan Size: 11x5; Sauce: 1 can; Meat: 3 cups turkey simmered in 1 cup chicken broth and 1/2 pkg. taco seasoning; Cheese layer: 12 oz. sour cream, 2 cups cheese of choice, 1 4 oz. can green chilies; tortilla layer: corn tortillas, shredded cheese with habanero peppers. I created 2 complete layers---sauce, tortillas, cheesy layer, turkey layer and habanero cheese---and ended with a tortilla and habanero cheese layer. To keep the top from drying out, I poured about 1/3 cup of the turkey-taco broth over the final tortilla layer. Baked covered for 25 minutes and uncovered for 10 minutes. Absolutely incredible!

I opted to saute the onion in butter, first. I recommend this, as the shorter baking time doesn't allow the onions to lose their harsher raw flavor. I used the 5 oz can of olives, so I had plenty to top with.I also used 2 14 oz cans of enchilada sauce, which helped keep it moist.  Finally, I topped the casserole with 8 oz of Mexican cheese blend (shredded.) Over all, a hearty, tasty dish.

I made it with tomato sauce but added cumin to give it a spicy Mexican flavor with jalapeño flavored Monterey Jack.

This was a really delicious, easy recipe. I had some leftover pumpkin in my freezer from Fall and a frozen turkey too so I cleaned out the freezer and made these. I used corn tortillas and green onions instead of yellow onions (my daughter has a food sensitivities) and everybody raved about these. We ate them for two days and they were fantastic both times. We did top them with avocado and sour cream. So good. THANKS for sharing this!

Next time I will spice it up a lot more. I did take some reviewers advice and use wheat tortillas and skipped the dipping it in the sauce and just poured it on. Cooked the turkey in taco sauce the day before so I could throw it together fast after work. Otherwise followed the recipe. Turned out really good. Definitely play with the recipe and make it your own, to your taste ( I always do). But the basic recipe is enough info for a great way to get rid of leftovers, and if your like me...I never let anything go to waste! I will make it again. Next time probably after thanksgiving when everyone is sick of big meals and wants something different. Will be perfect then. Editing this after making this again.
No matter how many times i make this. It gets gobbled up!

I added a second can of enchilada sauce. (1 can was nowhere enough). By the time I had stuffed all of the enchiladas I didn't have enough to sufficiently cover the top. Added sour cream and cilantro to the cheese mix. People loved it! I will definitely be making it again with the above changes.

I made this with 2 cups turkey leftovers and 2 cups cooked (plain) beans to make it stretch (be sure to salt before stuffing tortillas).  I also used 10-inch flour tortillas and 3 cups mild cheddar cheese. I only used a single can of red enchilada sauce but I wish I had used more. It was good and very filling. But since I used the large tortillas,  I baked it for 30 minutes.
Oh! And if you cut up the onion small enough, it cooks in the oven. For my own personal taste, next time I would add MORE onion.

I also made a few changes to this recipe.  I added a package of taco seasoning to a pot with the turkey, onion and some water and let it simmer/slight boil for an hour.  Then i added a can of green chilies to the mix strained the mixture and added the cheese and mixture back into the pot.

I made this today and put the cooked turkey in prepared taco seasoning (with water) like others suggested and it was really tasty. I also put sliced jalapeños instead of olives because we do not like them. For some reason I did not use all of the shells (only made 15) but maybe because I overstuffed  them by accident. I ate a "test" one for lunch and I enjoyed them but our kids are overly picky so not sure if they will like them but they have surprised me before. We are also making the Goya Mexican rice to go with it.

Delicious! Used the ten minute enchilada sauce from this site and followed the recipe exactly. It was wonderful and a great way to use leftover turkey.!

This is a great base recipe. As others have suggested, I did add a half cup of sour cream to the cheese mixture, but next time I will likely double the cheese as well. I yielded 19 enchiladas. Also, I recommend sautéing the onions first. Additionally, I prepared the onions and turkey with a taco seasoning packet as directed. With these modifications I think the recipe was excellent.

Made this for the first time, I should have had double the cheese and sauce for this recipe.  My family loved it and are happy I have made enough for the next two days.  It yielded 22 enchiladas.  Delicious!

I made this last year and added refried beans to the mix. 
This year I added 1 cup of sour creme and a 2 ounce can of mild green chili to the cheese mixture. Shredded the turkey and simmered with 1 tbsp butter and the onions in 3 cups of water and taco seasoning. Simmered until the onions were clear. Spooned the meat and onion mixture onto the enchiladas, then a spoon of the cheese mixture. I can use the broth later too. Adding beans would of been good this year.

I liked it a lot, but my kids were not fans, maybe because the onion went in raw, so they were still pretty pungent, which I like. I would make it again.

I can't believe that after 28yrs of marriage I finally discover the best way to use up left over turkey!! I added a can of refried beans to this recipe (to create a few "vegetarian" rolls for my daughter) and the whole family was over the top with reviews!!!

Made my own enchilada sauce from allrecipes just cut the chili powder in half. I don't like things super spicy. Not huge fan of black olives so I replaced with green pepper which I had on hand. Family loved, best use for leftover turkey!

This was pretty good but a little bland for me.  The second time I made it I used chicken instead of turkey and I used flour tortillas instead of corn tortillas.  I also added a small can of green chiles and a tablespoon of taco seasoning mix.  No need to dip each tortilla into the enchilada sauce.  I just poured it over the top and put extra cheese on top.

I have to say, I am not a huge fan of left over turkey. This was a delicious way to use some of that left over turkey and I would consider this a keep recipe

This was good!  My modifications:  I sauteed the onions first, let them cool, added the olives, cheese, southwest seasoning, and some sour cream.  I only used 19 corn tortillas.  I used 20oz of canned enchilada sauce and thought it needed more so I made some more from tomato sauce and seasonings.

I agree with reviewer Mclean - good starter, needs to be spiced up. I added about a cup of salsa to a rice that I cooked separately ( Rice a Roni variety). I also added a can of pinto beans adopted from another recipe I've done. I added about half of the enchilada sauce to a cup of sour cream and then mixed in 1/2 my cheese to the meat/bean rice mixture. The other  half of the enchilada sauce on the bottom of the pan (with 12 lg. corn tortilas I use 2 pans) and over the top of course with remaining cheese.

We needed a quick cheap meal we could make with leftover turkey - this was great!  So easy, I can't believe I never thought of trying this before.  We left out the onions and olives, and served with sour cream. Next time we're going to add refried beans, and use 12" tortillas.  Make sure you use CORN tortillas.. sooo good!

We loved this. I didn't have enough filling for all 24 tortillas or enough enchilada sauce. I suppose it was just the way I was putting them together. What a really great way to use your leftover thanksgiving turkey. I'll use this for chicken too.

This recipe gets a thumbs up from me. After dealing with a "wild cats" situation and having to visit the animal shelter, I had this smell in my nose and didn't think anything turkey -- even enchiladas -- would taste good. I was wrong! These are good. I was lazier than this lady and made mine flat with the layers. It was great! And still good again today, as leftovers! Thumbs up!

Great recipe! What an excellent use of leftover Thanksgiving turkey. We spiced up the bland canned sauce with some chili power, cumin, hot sauce and garlic and used part pepper jack and part  cheddar cheese. Delicious! Even the kids went for it with gusto.

Thanks for the recipe!

Well, I made this last night, and for me it was ok. I was a good way to use leftover turkey, but I was pretty unimpressed with it over all. I didn't like the way the turkey tasted with the other ingredients. Just sorta blah, & I doctored up the turkey as other reviews suggested.

I don't know how you can fit all that turkey into corn tortillas!  If I ever make this again, it will be enchilada pie style-- stacked up with layers like lasagne.
