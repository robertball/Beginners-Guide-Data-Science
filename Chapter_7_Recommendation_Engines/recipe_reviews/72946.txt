Ok, for some strange reason, this recipe was edited.  If you need to thicken it, I said mix a little flour first with the coconut milk, or water, and stir it in, toward the end.  If you just dump flour into it, it'll go all lumpy and nasty.  Also, 2 lbs of chicken can be easily substituted.

This tasted fine, but it does not taste like Adobo. It tastes a lot more like ginataan, and is much too watery, although  I like a bit of sauce with my adobo. I would suggest frying the garlic first, and then add the meat, not the other way around. I would also add more soy sauce and less chicken broth. The coconut, not a usual addition to adobo was new and interesting, and while not traditional, still tastes good.

I grew up in Indonesia (neighboring the Phillipines) and this is very close to our recipe for Rendang. We just don't use the vinegar. We use less Chinese Soy Sauce but also add Kecap Manis Sweet Thick soy sauce. Adda boullion cube or two and it is just fantastic over rice. Wonderful job Metalmama!

I make this all the time with chicken.  I make big bathces, because it makes great leftovers.  It does have a lot of liquid, but the flour helps thicken it into a nice gravy-like sauce.  I've never had adobo so I can't comment on the authenticity of this recipe, but it definitely tastes great.

The chicken was tender and had great flavor.  It seemed to me that the sauce should have been thicker, but this was the first time that I'd had adobo.  My husband, who grew up in the Philippines, confessed that it wasn't quite like what he was used to.  Of course, the recipe does say that it's Americanized, so that's understandable.

I floured the meat before browning.  Made it the day before serving and refrigerated over-night.  Day of serving I added flour and coconut milk.  Served over rice.  It was very well received by the Superbowl fans I served it to.  The meat was very tender and I would serve it again.

I absolutely loved this recipe!  I did omit the coconut milk due to allergies.  It was great without it!  I added onion to it for my hubby but would still be good without it.  I wouldn't do anything to this recipe however, for those of you that don't like coconut don't pass this recipe up because the recipe can stand on it's own without it.

Very good. I made this recipe with chicken and the meat was tender and tasty. My husband liked it very much, but I wasn't in love with the sauce. I let the soy sauce, vinegar and broth (and bay leaves and garlic) reduce in the dutch oven, which worked wonders on the chicken, but I didn't feel that adding the coconut milk really improved anything other than thickening a sauce that didn't really work as a sauce for me.  I would make this again, because it flavored the meat so well, but maybe next time I'll serve the chicken without a pool of sauce to flavor it and the rice, if that makes sense.
Either way, Metalmommy, thank you for the recipe. I liked it very much, and I hope my comments don't seem to indicate otherwise :)

I did some research as some people were saying this wasn’t authentic adobo but it seems the addition of coconut milk is done in some regions. Even though this didn’t have as much tang as some adobo, this tasted very good and we did enjoy it.
