This chicken salad is wonderful!  I've made it twice and it's gone within two days.  You can alter the flavor slightly by using different flavored chutneys.  I like to layer it over field greens and top it off with crunchy chow mein noodles, mandarin oranges and dried cranberries.  It's so quick and easy and a great idea for using up grilled chicken left overs.

Have made this salad a number of times using your options by adding a large can of pineapple tidbits and toasted sliced almonds.  Great meal on a hot evening.

My husband really enjoyed this. Added some sliced seedless red grapes and slivered almonds. Used leftover roast chicken from Sams Club.

I changed it quite a bit, and it's probably not fair for me to even rate it, as I found out after I started making it that I didn't have any chutney.  I just increased the mayo to 1 cup, and doubled the amount of curry powder, aside from that I kept the dressing the same.  I added butter toffee almonds, diced celery, diced red onion, and a peeled chopped asian pear to the salad, and used canned chicken.  I put it on toasted sour dough.  We thoughly enjoyed it.  The leftovers were  good all by themselves.

Great recipe, even better the second day.  Like other reviewers I added and handful of golden raisons for a little sweetness.  My picky 9 year old even liked it.

This was super tasty! I tossed in a little diced celery, green onion, and fresh pineapple. Used leftover baked chicken, so there was a mixture of white and dark meat. Served over a bed of lettuce. Look forward to making this again. I think it would be great in pitas or wraps.

Well, I googled where to find Chutney at the grocery store, but failed to google what Chutney was, oops:)  I asked a gal I saw, she said it was kind of like relish, so I diced up some spicy pickles:)  I swear I'm not a novice cook, but no one at the grocery store knew what chutney was.  I also added bacon, everything tastes better with bacon, right??  So, I would say this turned out more savory then sweet, and it didn't have chutney in it so this probabl isn't a fair review, but maybe a new way to tweak an already good recipe:)

Delicious!  I used Miracle Whip instead of Mayo to cut down on fat/cal.  I didn't add the chutney, instead I served it with different chutneys on the side and let everyone add their fav chutney.  My favorite chutney for this was mint chutney.  I also tried it with Spicy Tomato Chutney from this site.  That was good.  This recipe is also good without any chutney at all.

I prepared like a tuna melt. Tiny bit of butter on good multigrain bread with cheddar cheese melted over the top and thrown in toaster. Very tasty. Also added chives and cayenne pepper to recipe.

I made this without the lime zest. Perhaps this is why it was good but not great. It was just too sweet. I was hoping it would have some zing to it but it didn't. I'll try it again but next time, with some lime zest.

I added raisins, green onions, celery, and toasted pecans to this recipe.  My husband, who is leery but tolerant of curry, half-jokingly accused me of being deceitful when he detected this flavor in the dish, but he warmed up to it once he'd gotten used to the idea.  If you like fruit/meat combinations and curry, this is a great one for you!

I'd give this 10 stars if I couold.  Wonderful meal for a very hot evening.  I substituted lemon juice for lime and added celery, seedless grapes, and sprinkled on chopped chopped cashews just before serving.  DH who HATES curry gives it 4.5 stars which is really saying something.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good recipe--a nice combination of flavors. I wasn't sure if my guests would like the curry flavor, so I cut the amount of curry powder to 1/2 tsp., and added 1 tbsp of honey. Also, I like "stuff" in a salad, so I added 1/2 cup of the following: craisins, chopped green onions, celery, and toasted slivered almonds. Delicious!

This definitely deserves 5 stars for both ease and taste.  I halved the recipe which was perfect for my husband and I as a meal.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the store.  I tossed it with mixed greens (with carrots), and added mandarin oranges, toasted almonds, a hard boiled egg, and tomatoes on top.  I used light mayo as well.  Delicious!!

This was delicious, and I only made a couple of small changes. I cut back a little bit on the lime juice and added a handful of chopped pecans for a little crunch. Next time, I'll add even more pecans, plus some red grapes. Thumbs up.

I didn't measure anything; I just kept tasting it to adjust to my liking. I used a mango-ginger chutney. I did half mayo half yogurt. I didnt have lime zest but did add lime juice. I also added diced celery, diced mandarian orange, and slivered almonds. Served on puff pastery... yum! Even my 1 year old ate her portion all up!

This is a great basic recipe!  To add some more substance to it, I added about a Tbls.  of finely diced celery and 2 T dried cranberries along with cooked and well-drained spaghetti noodles.  It was really good.

This was wonderful if you follow the recipe exactly.  I added toasted pistachios and it took it to a whole other level of yummy!  I used a spicy mango chutney and will surely be trying this again with different chutneys.  Great way to use of leftover roast chicken or even turkey.

This was absolutely delicious.  I made a half recipe and wish I would have made the whole thing.  My husband loved it, too - it was a wonderful, light main dish served over some romaine lettuce.  Thanks for sharing - will definitely make again.

Made as directed. Way too tart for me and I love citrus. I think this would be better with a LOT LESS lime juice and zest. I tried to fix it to no avail.  Thanks for sharing.

The best chicken salad I've ever made! Found it for my boyfriend who loves anything and everything curry, and he agrees!
Next time I may try adding some diced celery or bell peppers for a bit of crunch.

Wow! I made this for a party and served it on a hearty white bread as well as on low-carb wraps. The only change I made was adding some pre-sliced almonds. Several of my guests from that day have asked when I'll be making it again *lol* Oh! I almost forgot. I did not get out to get the chutney so I had to make it myself. I'm curious to find out how various chutnies will change this recipe. I look forward to finding out!

This was soo yummy!  I used a peach chutney I had bought at a farmers' market a while ago and it worked out great.  I didn't have a lime in the house so I just used good ole concentrated lime juice and a little extra to make up for the zest.  I had mine, as it the recipe was on french bread with lettuce.  I will definatly be making this again, a nice change to plain chicken salad!

I made this with left over peach and chili glazed grilled chicken, so I already had a fantastic start!  This was absolutely delicious.  I added a little diced granny smith apple for some additional tartness and texture, too.  Love this recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

DELISH! I kind of winged it a bit, but I think the recipe is definitely a winner. I used 2 cans of chx, which wasn't nearly 4 cups, so I eyeballed the amount of mayo, chutney, and lime juice to add, but kept it in proportion to the recipe I think. The lime juice adds a lot of liquid that isn't absorbed, so be careful. The chutney gave this an awesome flavor -- and of course the curry did, too. I added raisins and some pecans and it was perfect. Will make again very soon. Happened to have the chutney on hand left over from another recipe, but will definitely start carrying it as a pantry staple so I can make this recipe whenever the mood strikes.

I added some celery and halved red grapes and filled half a cantaloupe for a light summer dinner.  It was very good!

Step aside boring chicken salad. This recipe has some flavor. I let the chicken salad soak overnight before eating. You could eat it in a pita or something quick. I used sweet mango chutney, but you could always add something with a little more spice.

Made this with about 3 cups leftover beer-can chicken, and adjusted other ingredient amounts accordingly.  I don't like "soupy" chicken salad, so I try to minimize the use of mayonnaise; I used only 1/4 cup mayo at first, then added Greek yogurt later to adjust the texture to where I like it.  As others suggested, I folded in some diced celery and golden raisins -- spot on!  Finally, I used the zest and juice of 1/2 fresh lime.  Any zest (lemon or lime) needs time to blend with the other ingredients, or its flavor can be overwhelming, I let the mixed salad sit in the fridge for 4 hours before serving -- no in-your-face lime.  Served on toasted ciabatta rolls with lettuce and tomato slices.  OMG... to die for!!  Yep, this is one of those recipes.

Very tasty! I added shredded carrots, finely cubed red peppers, some leftover garbanzo beans, caramelized diced walnuts, dried cherries and fresh basil. I served it over baby spinach and with some flat bread. It was delicious, and I will definitely do it again.

I rate the success of my recipes based on my sister-in-law's reaction, as she is an outstanding cook.  She raved about this one and asked for for the recipe.  I used a whole chicken as one or two other reviewers recommended.  Buy a rotisserie chicken from the  supermarket and it's no trouble at all.

My husband has always resisted recipes with curry, but he loved this one.  I added onions, raisins and toasted almond slices.  We've made it twice in the last few weeks and I'm sure it will be a regular.  It's easy and made with things I usually have on hand.
