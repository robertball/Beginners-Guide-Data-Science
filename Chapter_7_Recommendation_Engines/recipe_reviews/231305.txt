Pretty tasty!  They aren't a very sweet roll, so if you like sweets for breakfast, you may want to add more sugar in the filling or perhaps in the dough itself.  I added some cinnamon to the filling and I think it was a good choice!

Really good! Just what I was craving. I took another userâ€™s recommendation and sprinkled some cinnamon in the filling, and it tasted great!

I added cinnamon to the filing.  Recipe had the right amount of orange flavor.

Delicious soft rolls. I wanted more orange flavor so I added a little orange extract to the icing. I didn't like the cream cheese flavor in the icing, so next time I'll make it without cream cheese.

These rolls were fabulous! They were exactly as I remembered enjoying in my childhood. I followed the recipe without substitutions and have none planned. This recipe is going in the collection! Thank you.
