I made these cookies according to the directions. The only change was I added an extra tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, and I refrigerated the dough longer than required. Taste was excellent, but they were a little soft so next time I will up the cooking time by a few more minutes. Absolutely delicious!

These are very tasty and extremely easy to whip up! I added cinnamon to the sugar before pressing the cookies down and it is delicious! The pumpkin spice flavor is subtle, I might add a little more next time.

The absolute best recipe you will find. Made this last Thanksgiving for myself and kids, sent some to work with hubby and I had people ORDERING these by the dozen for their Thanksgiving  feasts, will definitely be making these again.

I think 5-7 minutes in the oven might not be enough, since the cookies tasted exactly just like the dough and they were wayyy too soft. And maybe the recipe needs a bit more pumpkin pie spice, but overall, these were great.

Cute little cookies that spread a bit, so space them a bit apart but you can still get about 9 cookies to a sheet to bake.  I added the pumpkin pie spice to the sugar mixture because of a comment that you couldn't taste the spice much.  These are a tad too sweet with the extra sugar for my taste, but they are sugar cookies so it makes sense.  I baked for 10 minutes at 350 degrees instead of 7 minutes at 375.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made these according to directions and chilled them for over an hour.  I baked half the batch.  They ran together while baking.   I test tasted when they were done and found them fairly bland.  For the second half I added a little flour and added a teaspoon of Pumpkin Pie Spice,  and brown sugar for the top with a little cinnamon added to it to be pressed on top.  These had a little more flavor.  I may try them again but will tweak more.

we love these cookies! I did follow some of the other reviews and put 2 Tblsp. pumpkin pie spice and I rolled the cookies into balls and rolled them in sugar and cinnamon like a snickerdoodle. We baked them at 350° for 12 minutes. Awesome cookies!

Was looking for a Christmas cookie recipe that wasn’t a traditional sugar cookie and stumbled upon these. Made them with all-purpose gluten free flour instead and they turned out great! I did need to up the baking time to about 12min (that is normal for gluten free baking). One note, you could not taste the pumpkin spice, so if you are looking for a pumpkin cookie add triple the amount of spice. They actually tasted just like snickerdoodle cookies and were delicious!

These are SO good!  They're delicious as is, but I added some icing (confectioner's sugar, milk, dash of lemon extract) and now they're doubly delicious!

Made these for a funeral today, the only thing I did different was the last part where you only use sugar—I used a ton of cinnamon. These are perfect, thank you so much for your recipe.

I made these but I also added an EXTRA 1 tsp of pumpkin spice and added a ‘dash’ of cinnamon to the sugar coating when placing the cookies on the baking sheet.  Perfect and definitely a keeper.  While the recipe didn’t specify salted or unsalted butter, I had only salted onhand.  Like I said  - Cookies are a keeper and do-again!!

We LOVED these, especially the ones that needed to cook a bit longer.  The ones that I had cooked longer (about 8 minutes total cooking time) were soft but not quite as tasty as the gooey ones.  My son and I plan on adding a second tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice next time, like others have suggested.  My mind kept thinking that the under-cooked cookies needed a bowl of vanilla bean ice cream to be thrown in to to make a tasty dessert.

These were super good. These came out thinner and crispier then I thought they would be.  I think I pressed them too much. Also I didn't add enough citrus. But I took them to work and they were gone fast! Would make them again when I have extra egg yolks.
