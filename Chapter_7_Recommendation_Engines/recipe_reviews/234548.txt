I thought this tasted okay, out of the oven, but it was much better as it sat in the fridge overnight. My biggest change, and I am glad I did it, was to severely reduce the sugar in the recipe. I also followed the crust exactly, but did line an 8x8 pan with foil before greasing it. The center part I used 4 tablespoons of brown sugar instead of 2/3 cup of white. I also used 1/8 tsp of lemon extract for the zest and subbed all the spices with an equal amount of apple spice to save time. I decided to thicken it with a cornstarch slurry using the apple cooking liquid. I had 1/3 cup left dried cranberries and used that amount. I made this to use up some store bought apple granola. It didn't have almonds . So, I did 2 cups of the granola and 1/2 cup almonds I finally chopped in my Vitamix. To the topping I added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, for flavor, but left out the sugar. It is loaded with it. Cutting back all of the sugar saved this, but oddly it is still teeth bitingly sweet. That is my biggest issue with the recipe. Apples, sweetened cranberries, and packaged granola are already plenty sweet. This was fine, but I think I will stick to similar desserts just made with plain oats that have a preferred milder texture and taste. For baking, it took 18 minutes as the granola was starting to over brown by that point.
