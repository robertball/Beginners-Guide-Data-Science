This went great with the chicken I made tonight. I did add 2 T of butter and a squirt of lemon juice for added flavor. This is a quick easy dish to make.

Felt this needed more seasonings and definitely more garlic. I prefer to saute my garlic on top of the stove rather than the microwave. With some minor adjustments, a sprinkling of parm and a side of salad, my family was satisfied.
