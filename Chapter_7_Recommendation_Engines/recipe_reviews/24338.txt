These are not gumdroppy at all. Think set jell-o that was left out at room temp. Needs to cook longer, or like 3x as much gelatin or something. As written, these are pretty, but squishy and not workable.

This recipe didnt turn out for me at all, all i got was a sticky gelationous glob.  Followed this recipe by the letter, 15 minutes isnt long enough.  Maybe if i just cook it to 250 degrees instead of where it ended up (around 225).  Still, this is a good start, with some tinkering, im sure these gumdrops will be delicious!

This is perhaps the most epic recipe failure I have ever tried.  There is no specified pan size, which really threw me for one.  I had just about every square and rectangle pan ready because I wasn't sure how much this would yield.  Alsop the amount of gelatin seems a bit off - it seems standard to measure unflavored gelatin in 'packets', not tablespoons.  Needless to say, I will find a new recipe for gumdrops!

My Mom and I made these for the first time and they are delicious!  We made raspberry, orange and peppermint.. Didn't care for the peppermint but the others taste amazing!
