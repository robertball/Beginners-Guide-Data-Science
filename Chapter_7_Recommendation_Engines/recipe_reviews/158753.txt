I must say the balsamic vineagar is very strong, almost too strong for the meat. I added mushrooms and onions to the vineagar mix which ended up being the best part. I also agree with another reviewer, four minutes on each side isn't enough...of course it does depend on the thickness of the steak. I served this with baked potatoes and putting the balsamic mixture/onions/mushrooms/ was the best part. I'm not ready to give up on this recipe, but it needs some tinkering.

If yopu like a great seasoned steak try this.
Use the salad spritzers balsalmic vinegrete spray or salad dressing as your marinade.

I don't eat meat, but this was loved and devoured by my gang! I did this just a tad differently in that I reduced the balsamic in a separate sauce pan which ended up taking about a half hour to get to that sweet, syrupy stage. Once the meat was done and sliced I drizzled on the sauce. Rave reviews in this house Kmommyz and everyone here sends a hearty thank you!

This is a great dish.  Both my husband and I loved it.  It has great flavor and is attractive enough for guests.  To achieve a fabulous sauce, it is essential to reduce the sauce to a thick syrup consistency.

I tried this with a sirloin steak and it was okay. I added a bit extra garlic. I didn't know what else to do, the sauce/reduction was okay, not stellar by any means. I used a good quality B. Vinegar so I was a bit upset I wasted it but oh well, it sounded good.

Very good. As another reviewer mentioned, the quality of balsamic is important. I have often found that low ratings in a recipe such as this one are usually because of the vinegar being used. It's simply one ingredient worth paying for.

I will certainly make this again. I made this per the recipe but I recommend brushing the steak with olive oil and coating with peppercorns and salt then let it sit in the fridge for an hour or more prior to cooking. I have made several pepper steaks and I find that letting them "marinate" for some time helps. The balsamic vinegar sure smelled potent during and directly after cooking but it tasted just fine on the steak. Thanks

This was very easy and fast.  I think the "too vinegary" reviews may have been caused by not allowing the balsamic to reduce enough, because it was very sweet tasting if allowed to reduce about as much as the recipe says (by 1/2).  I used 3/4C of balsamic like other reviewers, so perhaps that was it.  Anyway, very easy and good weeknight dinner with sweet potatoes and corn!

Really good and easy! 4 minutes on each side wasn't quite long enough for us, but I did have rather large steaks. Thanks for the recipe - a keeper!

I use a cast iron skillet. I always get the steak to room temp and marinate in a vaccum sealer for about 45 minutes. If you do not have a vaccum unit, marinate for 2 hours in the frig and bring to room temp before cooking, al the rest is the way to do it. Great recipe.

This was outstanding! I experienced no complaints with a too vinegary tasting reduction. If cooked properly, this should be exactly as desribed in KMOMMYZ's description, "a sweet & savory syrup". The key is to reduce it to a thick syrup consistency. I also used only 3/4 cup balsamic vinegar.

this was good.  i seared and cooked the steak, removed from the pan and sauteed shallots and garlic for a minute or so.  after pouring in the balsamic vinegar, i added about a half cup of coarsely chopped grape tomatoes.  cooked that for about 15 minutes, and then pressed on the tomatoes with a spatula so they'd give up their juices.  reduced a bit more, then strained through cheese cloth.  used some of the reduction for a salad dressing, used the rest as directed.

simple, elegant dish.  the reduction is quite pungent, but sweet and compliments a rare steak.

This dish received rave reviews from my family.  I had to fry the steak about two extra minutes on each side to get it past raw in the middle but other than that, the recipe worked fabulously.  We'll definitely be having this again!

I made this last night for dinner. I only changed one thing and that was I used Cranberry Balsamic Vinegar. My family and I LOVED it! It was amazing and so easy to make. I think using cranberry balsamic was the key and my husband kept saying that the reduction really made the meal. I served it with roasted baby bella's and sauteed french green beans with sweet onions. FABULOUS!

WOW! The balsamic reduction is to die for! When you let it simmer and reduce by half, the taste is wonderful and even slightly sweet. It took a total of 10-15 minutes. I only had one 1 lb. steak, but made the full recipe for the sauce and had more than enough.  Served with baked potatoes and steamed broccoli. Can't wait to make it again!

Delicious.  A dish worth repeating. Balsamic reduction is wonderful... does need to be balsamic vinegar, and it does need to be reduced for full flavor.

My husband says I should use this for his steak gorgonzola instead of what I usually use.  I thought it was just ok.  The house definitely had a smell like it for many hours afterwards.

I don't think I put enough pepper on but it was still fantastic. I added mushrooms to the balsamic and it really enhanced the dish.  My boyfriend went back for seconds after warning me before dinner that he didn't think he was very hungry.  We will definitely make this again!

We made this last night with a garden salad and mashed potatoes. I cheated and bough a bit nicer steak that was already rolled in the crushed pepper.  I was a little worried about the balsamic reduction because it smelled SO pungent at first, but once it was down to the syrup stage it was FABULOUS.  Preparing it in the same pan as the steak gives it a hint of the pepper.  The kids really like this though they felt the steak was a bit too spicy with the peppercorns.  Next time, I may do some without the pepper.

this was great, both my wife and I loved it, at first I thought it would be too much pepper but with the balsamic it came out just fine.

I just cooked a regular cheap steak from the grocery store... but it was delicious!! Instead of slicing the steak, I made the reduction ahead of time, and used it as a dipping sauce so the steak wouldn't dry out. Also, I cooked the reduction a little longer until it was quite sweet, and it paired well.

This was really good.  We served it as a main dish, but I think next time I will make more of the balsamic reduction and put the meat on top of a cobb salad.  Great!

this was good but you have to be carefull with the sauce. it goes from being just right to overdone very quickly. and once it's over done, it gets VERY thick an is useless.

I used dried parsley, I added it during the "vinegar reduction" phase. It works if you don't have fresh parsley.  Also, I added onion slices.  Cook them at the very last with the "vinegar reduction."

Delicious!  Purely by circumstance, I had the steak seasoned and ended up not being able to cook it that night so it sat covered in the fridge for a day and a half so the pepper flavor in the meat was excellent! I'll do it intentionally next time. Wonderful recipe.  Thanks for sharing it with us.

My family really liked this recipe. Instead of pouring the sauce over I put it into dipping cups. My husband isn't a big fan of vinegar so he didn't use his and still loved the steak. Definitely will cook again.

Great recipe!  Really have patience with the balsamic reduction as it pays off.  I used a 1.25 lb strip of flat iron steak and cooked 4 minutes per side as directed - would probably up to 5 minutes per side next time to achieve a perfect medium rare.  Will be adding this to our regular rotation.

Four out of the six of us thought it was a bit too sweet and we loaded it with more pepper. One loved it and chowed down and one was too young to say much, but he didn't eat a ton of it either.

This was delicious! Made it for company the first time. I cooked the steaks in my George Foreman grill though, and made the balsamic reduction on the stove in a small iron skillet. It was a huge hit, that "sauce" they said was wonderful. Will serve again!

Very tasty dish. I tried it with heavy cream as well as the way it is written. I actually liked the way it was written a bit better. A nice variation for steak lovers.

We used New York Strip Steak instead of Flat Iron, and the spicing was great! Unfortunately, I followed the heating instructions for the balsamic reduction and I turned it into tar!! Fortunately, the recipe calls for them to be cooked separate, if not my steak would've been ruined! Careful with how hot your pan is... it was smelling so good, but a little too vinegary for my fiance's taste, so possibly cutting back the vinegar next time. But either way, it's a good recipe!

The balsamic vinegar and parsley gives it a nice tangy flavor.  The one thing I'd change is the cooking time.  Four minutes each side of the steak cooked it to medium well.  I'd reduce the cooking time per side if you're looking for medium-rare steaks.  This was a super easy recipe to make.

Wonderful, SO really loved it, is having leftovers for breakfast! The vinegar really does need to reduce by half, to get rid of the vinegar taste. When done correctly  the reduction will have a slightly sweet taste.

Really a 4-1/2 star meal.  The whole family enjoyed it to include my 2-1/2 year old son.

This is delicious. I skipped the first part and omitted the peppercorns only because my kids wouldn't eat it. I agree with others and cooked it a little longer on each side.

This had excellent flavor! Especially the Balsamic Reduction, that seemed to make the dish truly step up! The husband loved it... he even popped open a bottle of wine! Wish I doubled the reduction. My advice is to do the same and enjoy!

This is definitely a keeper. I listen to the reviews and reduce the balsamic vinegar and was careful with the peppers. My family loved it and came back for more! I also baked it in the oven for and hour to get the desire tenderness of the steak. Simply good!

Delicious.  I used flank steak b/c that's all the grocery store had and it still turned out amazing.  I served it with garlic mashed potatoes and marinated roasted red peppers.

This was just ok.  I 1/2ed the recipe and covered the steaks in the oil, then lightly sprinkled the pepper on top--didn't want to make them too spicy.  My hubby grilled the steak while I prepared the basalmic reduction on the stove.  It sounded great but tasted so-so.  Thanks anyway!

we used really thick ribeye steaks and followed the same directions.  AMAZING!! we used one suggestion and added cherry tomato halves towards the end of the reducing.  (we smooched them first to get extra water out).   yes, very balsamic-y, but we love that. we used 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1.  AMAZING!
