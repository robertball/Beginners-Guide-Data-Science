This was delicious.  I followed the recipe except for the tomatoes.  Instead I added some steamed kale.  It was excellent.

I've enjoyed this so much. First time making Mahi ever . Came out perfect.  Not overcooked and marinated it overnight. I added rice and polish sausage for a little fat

This turned out delicious! The only changes I made was that I used ahi tuna, because I had it on hand, and added in some fresh spinach to the sauce. I served it over a bed of long grain & wild rice and it looked beautiful! I will definitely be making this again!

Update - halved wine so mushrooms and tomatoes aren't  swimming. Doubled shallots, garlic and red pepper flakes for marinade (didn't double olive oil). And grilled Mahi Mahi separately. Perfection!!

Delicious and easy to make!  I didn't wish to add the tomatoes and just added a little more butter instead. My husband and I both loved it and are planning on having it really often!!

We enjoyed it!  Was the best recipe for this dense fish that I'v found so far.  Will fix again, next time we splurge on a fish this expensive.
