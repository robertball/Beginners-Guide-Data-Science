I submitted this recipe and I'm so glad that everyone seems to like it.  It was my mother's.  (She didn't make her mashed potatoes this way until I got married and moved out)!  I've noticed some are leaving out the egg.  The egg will make your potatoes even fluffier, and rise higher.  Leave in the egg, you'll see!  Enjoy! Please note***The recipe I submitted was to use 1 tablespoon grated onion not 1 whole grated onion!  That may be why the onion taste is overpowering to some.

These were wonderful ... much too quick and easy for the great results.  I made these Thursday eve for the next day.  When I put them in the baking dish, I was doubtful.  The next day, I stirred them up and made peaks with a fork.  An hour later, they were fluffy, and the tips were golden.  Rave reviews.  A definite keeper for any season or occasion.  Update: 11/04, I continue to use this recipe as the best I've ever found in do-ahead mashed potatoes, and the concensus is they're even better.  The recipe as written, including using Yukon Gold (as opposed to other varieties) is what makes it wonderful.   It's a no-fail for me.  Thanks again!

Do not make and bake this ahead of time or it will be dry and flat when reheated. DO MAKE IT and refrigerate it until you need it.  Then bake and serve it right away! Then it is very tasty, high and pretty!

We made the mashed potatoes ahead of time, refrigerated them, and baked them the next day.  They were very creamy and rich - perfect!

These are great!  Have made them twice, last night for a Christmas Party that I catered.  So much easier than mashing them right before dinner!  I made them the day before, put them in gallon bags & they tasted like I had just made them on the spot!  I did add a whole head of garlic that I pre roasted....yum!

These had a great texture - fluffy and light. It was a bit bland for me (I like really buttery potatoes), but I think some extra butter and onion will remedy that in the next batch.

These are my husband's absolute favourite way to eat mashed potatoes, and one of mine as well. I follow the recipe to a T. I serve them to company a lot. I love that you can make them ahead, put them in the fridge, and then about an hour before people arrive while you're busy preparing the rest of the meal, you just stick them in the oven. Awesome.

Fantastic recipe.  I modify it quite a bit based on the ingredients I have on hand, but they turn out well every time.  Suggested additions: fresh garlic, fresh parsley, medium cheddar cheese and chives.  You can also leave the skin on the potatoes if you like.  If you don't have time to bake them, just omit the egg and whip up the potateos with a mixer.  Makes great "dirty" mashed potatoes.

This recipe was soooo good. I added a clove of minced garlic for more flavor. Next time I want to try leaving out the egg and not bother to bake them, just do them on top of the stove.

This is a great twist to regular mashed potatoes and easier than Twice Baked.  I substituted 1 cup of sour cream for the cream cheese and added about 8 oz of shredded cheddar cheese to make a "Twice Baked" casserole.  It was delicious!

I make these by also adding 1 1/2 cups of sour cream.  I have made them up to 5 days ahead and I have also frozen them......no problems.  I also use onion salt instead of grated onion.  Sprinkle some dabs of butter and paprika on before baking. These are fabulous.

This was so easy and so delicious.   I used dried minced onion 2 tbls. in place of the minced onion. I put it together the day before and baked it the next day.  I wish I had made more, I didn't have any leftover.  Thanks for sharing.

Wish I'd taken a picture....these potatoes were pretty as a picture and they tasted even better! Everyone loved them.  Because they were baked it ony took a half hour.  They were just golden brown and piping hot. I sprinkled chives into mixture as I beat in the cream cheese and a little paprika on top right before I popped them in the oven. These will be a family favorite!

These mashed potatoes were SOOOOOOOO good! I love salt on everything, but I didn't think these potatoes needed much salt because of the onion, which gave it a delicious flavor. I also sprinkled paprika over them before baking. Delicious! I will definitely make these again.

If you follow the recipe exactly, these potatoes rock.  If you just HAVE to add sour cream then these potatoes steal the show.  For spices, I added garlic salt, pepper, parsley, and sub'd in onion powder.  I also dumped in about a cup of sour cream.  I just did everything to taste then added the egg and baked it.  

These are so good that my kids snagged a bowl before I added the egg.  This is my new favorite potato!!!

Oh wow!  If you want to impress someone, these are the right potatoes for the occasion!  I used the cream cheese that comes with onions and chives in it all ready instead of adding the grated onion.  I also had more than 8 ounces of cream cheese, and I think it came out fine.  Very crisp and delicious on the top and sides and creamy in the center.  Superb!

First, know that I am a carb LOVER so chances were good I'd like them, but WOW. I actually just now saw the submitter Nancy F's review, and realized that 1) there was a reason they tasted SO deliciously oniony even though the description doesn't mention it (she wrote it with a Tbsp, not a whole onion's worth!), and 2) in the extreme multi-tasking of Christmas dinner preparation I somehow left out the egg! Dang. I will definitely use this recipe again, and will happily add way more than 1Tbsp onion, but will actually get that egg in there to see how it affects the final result. I left my potato skins on, and didn't mash thoroughly since our family likes chunky taters. BTW, after an hour in the oven, the onions are a mellow and delicious undertone, not at all raw or sharp. These were delicious in the bottom of a bowl of beef stew, and I'm sure we'll find lots of other ways to enjoy these this winter.

Oh, we loved these!!!  There is nothing extra spectacular about the seasonings (just looking @ the recipe will tell you that); but the hero part of this dish is 1st) the make-ahead -- so easy to just pull them out the next day pop in the oven; and 2nd) the consistency and depth that the cream cheese adds, both for presentation and re-heating.  I could not stop dipping in for another bite -- even cold in the fridge!  So if you want more flavor, just add more seasoning!  This is an excellent base, and will become my holiday tradition mashed potatoes.

I LOVED these potatoes! I was a little skeptical at first but, they were so fluffy and delicious.  I added dried garlic and onion seasonings.   I was able to make them a couple hours in advance of when I needed them and just left them in a low temperature oven until we were ready to eat them.

I just have to mention how skeptical I was about making these...I was skeptical!  But the end result was very impressive.  When I was beating them, they were somewhat dry, so I wanted to keep adding milk, not to mention, they were taking a toll on my rickety old beaters (I didn't feel like messing up my kitchen aid as this dirtied 3 bowls as it was), BUT right out of the oven, they were soo creamy and yummy, I felt my butt growing after every bite ;) HA!  They did thicken up after they cooled, so keep that in mind.  My kids actually thought that because they were yellow....I was like NO!  Good potatoes, thanks Nancy!

This recipe is so simple, but much more interesting and special than plain old potatoes. The cream cheese adds a sinfully rich creaminess, and the baking time gives you a beautifully browned top. Not too much trouble, but oh so good.

These were so easy and so good!  I doubled the recipe for a large family gathering.  We had enough left over to feed the kids the next day and they still loved them.  My husband says we should always make potatoes this way.  Great recipe!

I decreased the amount of butter and cream cheese, increased the amount of milk and added green onions and this was the most creamy, wonderful dish I have ever served.  Melts in your mouth.  Be sure to use Yukon Gold potatoes- they really make a difference.

I thought this was a good recipe, I would recommend using a Ricer, and not a hand mixer for making mashed potatoes. For the people that thought it was bland, maybe add some garlic.

I am not a big mashed potato fan, but these were incredible!! and easy.  They were so fluffy and yummy. They rose like a cake, while baking!  Next time I will kick them up with garlic or horseradish!

shared with sharel for Thanksgiving so she wouldn't be mashing taters right before we were set to eat -- she said it was so easy and awesome and everyone loved them.  Saves on mess and time and stress!!  A keeper :)

These were so good! Made them for Thanksgiving dinner and what a good choice. Took Dawn's advice and added some Italian bread crumbs and grated parm to the top and wow! Great recipe. Thank you!!!

This is a great way to make the potatoes, I added a clove of minced garlic and sprinkled the top with bread crumbs and grated parmesan to give it a little more color and crunch, so it came out more like a twice baked potato without all the work

This is really a great recipe. The only change I made was to use red potatoes and a  muffin pan. So I had a number of individual servings. I made them about three hours before lunch, they tasted great on reheating. It's usually hard to get everone to eat, much less like mashed potatoes but these were really liked.

These potatoes were not very good. I followed the recipe to a tee. The texture was icky & the flavor was bland. This goes in my 'No' pile.

Made for Thanksgiving. Awesome! I made the potatoes before I started the turkey. I made them and place them in crockpot (instead of oven) on low until we ate (3 hours later). came out perfect. Saved tons of stress doing potatoes early. I used 9 regular potatoes (what I had in cupboard), added 1/4 cup extra milk, otherwise recipe the same. Will use every year from now on. yes, lighter and fluffier. Not too rich to me. Thanks so much for posting this.

Fantastic! The whole family loved this. The second time around I didn't have cream cheese so I substituted 1/2 c old cheddar and 5 processed cheese slices-another hit! Thanks for this recipe.

Forgot I had a potluck to go to and whipped this up in no time.  There wasn't a bite left afterward!  Made it exactly according to recipe.  No need to add extras, although a little cheddar sprinkled on top doesn't hurt.  A great recipe to have on hand!

Had been promising our 18 year old son I would make him 'real' mashed potatoes for some time.  When I saw this recipe, I just knew it would be a hit, and it was!  The flavors are perfect, and I'm thinking about making it again for Bible study in just a few days. I know they will love it as much as we did. Love that you can make it the day before, and bake it the following day.  So it is convenient, tastes good, and not too difficult to make!  Who doesn't love a recipe like that?!

My granddaughter and I made these potatoes for Christmas today (2011) and they were fantastic! The only thing we did different was instead of Yukon Gold potatoes we used red and used onion powder instead of grated onion. This recipe is a keeper! Grandma CB

This was so excellent!  Served it for Thanksgiving and heated it up while the turkey was resting out of the oven.  Only one problem with this recipe: No Leftovers!!! 5 stars.

This is a life saver!!! Love love love this recipe!!  Made it the night before Christmas, and baked them on Christmas.  It took about 2 hours to reheat since they were in fridge.  Everyone thought they were delicious! I didn't add the onion. I added garlic powder and mr.dash onion seasoning.

I halved the recipe and put a little shredded cheese on top during the last few minutes of baking.  Guaranteed NO LEFTOVERS when you serve these.  Puffed up a little and were just fluffy and yummy.

Very disappointed in the flavor. Other reviews raved about these potatoes. I did only add 1 Tblsp. of onion as reviews said the whole onion was a mistake in the ingredient list but I feel more onion would definitely add to it. I will make these again because I feel they would be very good with added flavor. UPDATE, changed to 4 stars, when reheating them in a frying pan with a little butter I added extra onion and salt & pepper, tasted better.

Yummy. Used Yukon potatoes. Cut them up in chunks and boiled till soft. 

Baked the mash potato mixture then 2/3 of the way through I added sharp freshly shredded cheddar cheese to the top. Continued to bake till cheese was slightly browned. 

After baking, I mixed the mashed potatoes in the baking dish to mix the cheese around. These were great. Added some roasted garlic too. Yuuuuum

I made these potatoes for my Christmas Eve dinner, and on Christmas night at my sister's house, as people were eating her mashed potatoes, instead of complimenting her on her food, they were still saying how wonderful the potatoes I made the night before were! LOL! (sorry sister)

Definitely a keeper recipe! I'll never make mashed potatoes any other way!

Yummy!  I used lowfat ingredients as well, and didn't think they were bland at all.  Potatoes need a LOT of salt, so that may have been some reviewers' problem - we loved these.  I made the whole recipe and used the leftovers for shepherd's pie, which was great.  This does make pretty stiff potatoes (especially the leftovers), so definitely add more milk if you like 'em fluffy.

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner!  It was a hit!!  I did add 8 oz. of sour cream as well.  Hint:  Saute onion w/butter before adding to potato mixture.  Next time I plan to saute until completely soft.  Very good and VERY easy to make.  Definite keeper! :)

Yummy! Used skim milk, fat free cream cheese and egg substitute to make it healthier-did use real butter though. I made the whole recipe and divided it into 2 dishes(froze the other one for another meal)I will make this again.

This was excellent.  I omitted the onion, and cooked several whole cloves of garlic with the potatoes, and mashed them together.  I prepared this the day before Thanksgiving, and baked it Thanksgiving day.  It was a huge hit!

I added a couple mashed cloves of homemade roasted garlic. Right before baking, I sprinkled a half cup of extra sharp white cheddar over the potatoes. My family inhaled these.

I made these last minute, so no time for the egg and bake. Also used garlic powder, they were smooth and tasty. I've never used cream cheese in mashed potatoes before, but will definately be doing so going forward.

Taste wise this recipe is 5 stars all the way. The one thing I really did not understand (yes, I know its in the title) is why they even have to be 'baked'. I did make this recipe exactly as written but next time, I think I'll just mix the ingredients and serve w/o baking. I really think it would have tasted just the same. It would save an hour of cooking time and I'm all for saving time when I can.

Made these for Thanksgiving and they were by far the best mashed potatoes I've had.  Everyone raved about them.  In addition you can make it ahead and bake about 1 hr prior to serving, and they come out piping hot and fluffy.  I followed the recipe to a "T".  Thanks Nancy F.

These were good. I added garlic powder to mine and a little grated cheese on top. They did save time and tasted good but you can achieve the same results by just mashing them yourself with the same ingredients and not baking them.

I was not all that impressed by these potatoes. They are too bland to be eaten plain, and once you put gravy on you can't tell them from regular mashed potatoes - they are just more work.

YUMMY! I used red bliss potatoes instead and didn't use the onion but they turned out fantastic! I made these the day before Thanksgiving so I wouldn't have to be mashing potatoes at the last minute and it made my life much easier. I will definitely make these again.

Amazing! This is my new mashed potato recipe. Everyone who tries is immediatley compliments it! The cream cheese makes them so moist and creamy! We add shredded cheese on top near the end of the cooking process for a nice gooey surprise on top!

I used regular baking potatoes that were on hand.  It turned out fine.  

Found an easy way to prepare 2 different sides @ once.  I followed the advice of other raters and split the recipe into two dishes, holding out the cream cheese from 1/2.  

I made a twice baked casserole by ADDING: 1c sour cream (NO cream cheese), ½ c real bacon bits, 1c shredded cheddar cheese and chives to ½ the potatoes.  After baking I garnished with a scant amount of cheddar, bacon bits and chives all over the top to dress it up, baked 5 min.  

The other half I proceeded as directed (cutting down the cream cheese, by half, to 4 oz).  This one I sprinkled the top with chives and 1/4c finely grated parmesan cheese.  

I also froze one and used it later, defrosted it in the fridge over night, mixed WELL, then cooked as stated in recipe!  Thank you Nancy!  Great recipe!!!

These were great!! I did add the egg even though
others had omitted it. When you add the egg the
texture changes completely. They were great warmed
the next day. We love potatoes and this will be
a regular dish for us!!

I omitted the egg and onion.  No problem.  I also had to hold these forever in the oven while waiting for guests - the recipe didn't suffer at all and they were devoured.  Very yummy.

I had followed the advice of a few other reviewers and added some extra pieces of butter on top before baking.  I don't think I will do that next time because it caused the entire mixture to be WAY too runy.  Had a great flavor though!  I omitted the egg, and added a couple of large spoonfuls of sour cream.  Also, I boiled the potatoes in veggie broth with a big spoonful of minced garlic (from the jar) thrown in.

These are really tasty - though next time I will add more onion and some garlic.  Also, I will probably use 4 oz of cream cheese and 4 oz of sour cream for a more interesting flavor.

Great! Thanks for a really good recipe.  I will never serve mashed potates, to a group, any other way.  Yukons makes it even better than Russet.
Have past it on to others and get many thank yous!

I used this recipe to make our 2001 Thanksgiving dinner mashed potatoes and it was A GREAT HIT!  Everyone loved them so much that all had seconds,including the children!  (I'll share a secret though, I substituted the milk with evaporated milk and omitted the egg.)  Fluffy, easy & delicious!!!  Thanks Nancy F!!!

These mashed potatoes were the absolute best I've ever had!  So easy, and you can make them the night before to save time.  Good idea using the Yukon Gold potatoes too.  This was such a big hit, I will make them again and again.  Thank you for making my dinner party a success!

I made this yesterday and served it on Thanksgiving Day!  I had 10 people over and they were almost all gone!  I creamed the cream cheese and butter together then added the egg.  After it was mixed, I added a few potatoes slowly.  I was able to get all five lbs of potatoes in my Kitchen Aid and mixed till fluffy with the skins on.  The next day, I removed from fridge and put them in the oven for one hour.  They were absolutely fabulous.

This is a great recipe and I use it every Christmas.  It is ideal as you can prepare ahead of time (do not bake ahead), put in fridge and when you take it out of the fridge the day of baking, let it stand until it comes to room temperature prior to putting it in the oven.
Less work on Christmas day or whatever day you choose to use it.

I do not like mashed potatoes (despise them), but I make them regularly for my family. After making this recipe I have changed my mind about mashed potatoes, these were great. I prepared them and put them in the fridge, cooked them the next day and turned out fabulous.
Thanks to whoever submitted the recipe!
(I omitted the onions, my kids dont like onions)

I joked with my family that "they are so good they don't even need gravy!" And they agree! Hands down best mashed potatoes I have ever had, and typically I am neutral, take it or leave it, about mashed potatoes.

I will be doing this one again, for sure. I used russet potatoes, subbed sour cream for the cream cheese, and used onion powder instead of a fresh onion, because those things are what I had on hand. I also added parsley and some pressed garlic. I was a bit worried that my main course was going to be finished and ready to eat before the egg had time to cook, so I left that out, and just baked the potatoes without it. I didn't need to worry though. Next time, I will cook and mash the potatoes ahead of time, and add the egg, so I can take the worry out and just pop it in the oven. These were delicious. Very flavorful, and although I did serve these with gravy, they could have been eaten without it. The leftovers will make a delicious shepherd's pie tomorrow night.

These were quite good. However, they seemed a bit dry for me. The weird thing is, my husband loved them and he usually loads his mashed potatoes with mayo to make them more moist and creamy (which i absolutely hate thus the reason for me doing this recipe) needless today, he used no mayo! So 5 stars from him i guess, but only 4 for me.

These were amazing. I followed the recipe pretty closely. Forgot the milk, but that didn't seem to matter. I topped them with low fat cheddar cheese towards the end. They were great the next day too!

This was excellent.  I did baked my potatoes first and then baked them again.  The cream cheese gave it a nice rich flavor.

Very good.   With so much to do for a big meal, you can prepare ahead of time and then bake later.

These turned out great.  So rich & creamy & delicious!  I left out the egg & onion, and they were still light & fluffy.  I made them earlier in the day & left them in the fridge until ready to bake.  I love that you can make them ahead of time. Easy & yummy recipe!

Yum!  Guests loved this.  I used 1 TBSP onion instead of a whole one. I also added about 2-3 TBS of horseradish sauce --gave it a little kick.  Easy to prepare ahead, which is so helpful for the holidays.

In the unlikely event that I would make these again, I would decrease the onion in half and surely saute them in butter to soften before adding to the potatoes.  It just had an overwhelming onion flavor.  I also didn't find this recipe to be as creamy and flavorful as most others have.  In fact, they're sort of on the dry side.  But, since I am enjoying them a tad more today leftover and the onion flavor is more mellow, I'm going to guess that making them the day before and refrigerating them is key.

This was pretty good.  I followed some suggested adjustments by other reviewers and it came out still needing some more salt--it was slightly bland.  I would definitely cook again though, everyone loved it & it makes plenty for leftovers!

I was pleasantly suprised. Turned out very light and fluffy, as well as tasty! My daughter won't eat mashed potatos without gravy, so I tried both with and without gravy, great both ways, but Ithink I prefered with gravy.

My husband LOVED - he's from Ireland where you "don't mess with the potatoes" and even though I "messed with the pototes" - he gave it 5 stars!  I did omit the onion, since that would be sac relig to the hubby.  I would have liked onion.

Yummy! I only have 2% so I used heavy whipping cream to add to its flavor. I also sprinkled some freshly grated parmesean cheese on top before I put it into the oven. I put it at 400F for 30 minutes to shorten the cooking time. It turned out great!

I thought the potatoes were extremely bland. As for physical appeal, they were quite pretty. I don't know why there was no flavor. Maybe it was because I used low fat cream cheese, butter, and milk. I wanted to cut some fat out, but if it also hurts the taste, then maybe next time I should lay off the fat-free ingredients.

Wow,these are fantastic. Didn't have the Yukon gold potatoes, so I used regular russets. Didn't have an onion either,so I added a little garlic. My hubby downed 1/2 of this. This is a keeper for sure.

I prefer light, fluffy mashed potatoes and so changed the process slightly.  I got the mashing process started with a masher, then finished it with a hand mixer.  I also added signifigantly more milk (at least 1 cup) than called for by eyeballing the potatoes for my desired consistency.  After peeling 5 pounds of small, Yukon Gold potatoes, I wasn't about to grate an onion.  I put an onion in our food processer.  I also used fat free cream cheese.  My husband and I loved it-a definite keeper!

These mashed potatoes are so scrumptious, delicious, rich, heavenly and wonderful that I eat what is left in the casserole at the end of the meal for dessert.  The golden brown edges are the best.  
I use heavy cream instead of milk, and add a bit of sour cream.  I only make these for holiday dinners because they are dangerous to my waistline, and I have no self control when it comes to this dish!

This was so easy and it puffs up like a souffle'. 
I didn't have any Yukon Gold potatoes on hand so I used 1/2 a box of instant potatoes. I cooked the potatoes with water only in the microwave then added the ingredients of the recipe, then baked.... it was a hit!

This is a great make ahead dish.  I used only half the cream cheese called for and only a 1/4 of a minced onion.  Everyone loved it!  Creamy, fluffy and tastey! mmm...

These were pretty tasty, but quite a bit of work to peel and cut them all (and a ton of potatoes for two people).  They were definitely fluffy, but a little drier than I would have liked.  The cream cheese and onion gave great taste, so maybe next time I'll just add those into my regular mashed spuds.  Thanks.

I could sit and eat this as a meal itself.  I have made something like this many times.  However,  I omit the egg and add a small container of sour cream.  I also added 1/2 sick of butter while reheating.   Good luck!

These were very good.  Since I use a ricer to mash my potatoes, it did take a while.  I made them for Thanksgiving and nobody guessed they were made ahead.  Very good.  Will definitely make again.

I made this recipe just as the directions stated with the exception of the onions, I used 1/4 cup of green onions. It was to die for. I made this as a side dish for cube steaks the gravy from the cube steak and these mashed potatoes was absolutely scrumptious..I will definitely make these again!!!

If I hadn’t added a lot more butter and 3/4 cup more milk before putting them in the oven,they would have been a disaster. Nor did they puff up like the recipe said. I will stick with my own tried and true recipe!

Made them for the first time.  Really good mashed potatoes.  I made them the night before and baked them for Thanksgiving.  I included fresh minced garlic along with the onions.

This has been my go-to recipe for mashed potatoes for awhile now. I sometimes mix a few parsnips in to give it a little bit of an earthier flavor but it’s good either way! Thank you for sharing! ??

Doesn’t need the egg, and doesn’t need to be baked. Extra stuff ruins a perfect dish. I tried it at both points in the recipe. It was better before the egg and before baking.

I have made these many times and usually a day ahead.  I don't bake until the following day. Don't over beat the potatoes.  I always add about a1/4 TSP of nutmeg. Just like all potatoes make sure to salt the water during the initial cooking and salt to taste after mashed in with  the other ingredients. These are always a hit.

I made this for our Thanksgiving meal.  The entire family said they were the best mashed potatoes ever!  Would definitely make this again.  
If you are worried about the grated onions - no one noticed they were there - they just added flavor!  
The leftovers also warm up well.

I made these with red potatoes, twondiced red onions, and 1 lb sour cream in place of cream cheese. (What I had on hand). The results were outstanding!! I will continue to use this recipe...the genius of adding the egg and baking have made these an automatic Holiday dish addition. And mind you....I made them on a hot July day for my daughter, who was coming off a stomach bug!!

I used russet potatoes and omitted the onion.  These potatoes are AMAZING.

Able to be made ahead same day ( I made it in the morning and let it rest on the counter).  Try using a couple of cloves of garlic- the taste is incredible.

I made it The day before with Yukon gold potatoes, as written, and it stored in a gallon  size freezer bag for travel.  Cooked it in the casserole dish at 350 for about 50 minutes.  Had a good looking crust and was well liked by the family.  My husband would eat it again and that is a great vote!

I boiled the potatoes with the skin on then cooled a bit before peeling. Mine needed a little more milk. Had an open can of evaporated so used a little of it. I think it made them richer. I also roasted a garlic bulb first and added it to the potatoes while mashing. I stirred in real bacon bits and chives from the garden before baking. Divided into 2 pans. Put one in the freezer, baked the other a couple hours later. Hopefully the freezer one will be as good as the other one.

Tried these for my family.  Not impressed---thick and yet dry more than creamy.  Would have enjoyed just mixing in more milk and butter, etc. whipping and serving--not baking.  Will not try again.

Very Good! Never baked mashed potatoes before. Perfect for making ahead and baking later! Refrigerated overnight and baked on Thanksgiving. Got puffy and light in texture, not dry. Will definitely do again!

I made the recipe with the following exceptions.
1. Only used 1 21g package of fresh chives (if my conversion was correct then the recipe called for about 56g of chives).
2. Only used 1 8 oz. package of shredded Parmesan cheese and not 2.
3. Only used 7 cloves of fresh garlic (as I didn't quite know how to identify a medium head of garlic I erred on making it less garlicky than it could have been).

First off, 5 lb. of mashed potatoes is a lot of potatoes (for 3 people), and next time I'll reduce the entire recipe by half to scale it correctly for 3 people -- FYI, I'm a newbie cook. The potatoes could have been moister -- I'm told I can do this by adding more milk. They were quite dense and could definitely have been less so, perhaps even "fluffy" more like traditional mashed potatoes -- I think I'll try using less cream cheese. Also, I'll try pre-mixing all the ingredients together separately from the potatoes and then add it to the potatoes. As for the garlic, the flavor was good and fairly subtle -- not so subtle as to say you couldn't tell there was garlic though but it could have had more, up to double the number of cloves.

Wonderful potatoes, very light and fluffy.  Didn't have any Yukon Gold potatoes so I used small red potatoes, scrubbed and with skins on.  Also used onion and chive cream cheese.  Made in the morning for dinner with friends that night.  Baked for 1 hour along with the rest of the meal and everyone enjoyed them.  Thank you for the recipe.

These were rather bland as written so I hope when I add more butter and salt next time it won't change the texture. The main thing I really like about this recipe is that I only have a hand mixer and mashing potatoes by hand takes me forever so the potatoes always get cold by the time they're smooth enough. Adding an egg and popping them in the oven warms them up without drying them out!Do NOT leave out the egg.

Made these to take to a Christmas lunch today. They were so yummy. I made no changes other than to use the 1 tbsp. dried onion flakes that the submitter of this recipe stated in the reviews was supposed to be listed in the ingredients. I would have tried it with a grated whole onion, but I had a fussy eater. I can't wait to make these again. Yumm-o!!

It was delicious, I added cheddar cheese on top in final 10 min that made a nice light brown layer. Cream cheese was a good addition!

This recipe was amazing! I tweaked it a bit! Instead of grating the onion I chopped it and 2 cloves of garlic together and added them plus real bacon bits (to taste I never measure bacon!!!!) then after the hour in the oven was up I shut off the oven and sprinkled grated cheese on top and let it melt!!!! My husband said they were better then TGIFridays loaders mashed potatoes!!!

Just another suggestion to make life easier. After refrigeration, bring to room temperature and put into a slow cooker. Spay cooker with Pam, and then heat on low 3-4 hrs. It frees up your oven for anything else you might be baking or roasting. It's a huge help when roasting a large turkey in particular.

Delicious.. I had to change the serving size on it, therefore I had to play with the measurements and texture. But once I baked the potatoes, it was YUMMY... **One more egg, added an extra YUMM to the potatoes**

I've made this recipe for every single family gathering from Easter to Christmas dinner. Everyone loves it. It's flavorful, light, and delicious. Sometimes when I grate the onions, it comes out just a watery mess. When this happens, I just use mainly the juice and its still a family favorite.

This was a great recipe.  I would only add half an onion instead of a full onion or maybe green onion.  However, I really liked putting the potatoes in the oven after mashing them.

Tasted great! I used 1 tbsp of onion powder instead of a grated onion, approx. 1/4 cup of fat-free sour cream and added some shredded cheddar cheese on top the last 10 minutes it was in the oven.

I was disappointed in this given all the rave reviews. I prepared the recipe one day, then baked it as directed the next.  It was not as rich as I'd expected given the cream cheese.  While I don't think its bad for make ahead potatoes, it wasn't anything special.  And when it came out of the oven, it was slightly browned and dry looking - did not look appetizing and my guests did not even try it.  The next day I took it to potluck dinner.  I reheated in microwave, added more milk, butter and chicken broth.  Then put back in the oven to finish warming and added fried onions to the top.  A big improvement, but I doubt I'll ever use this recipe again.

These were really tasty. I made them the day ahead and heated them up the day of and they were moist and creamy. I didn't read the review that pointed out the error (1 tbsp of grated onion, not a whole onion), but I didn't find the onion flavour overwhelming. Thanks for a great recipe.

Great Recipe! My son is not a fan of my mashed potatoes but, he cleaned his plate of these. They were incredibly fluffy and the onion added great flavor! Will make again!

These were pretty good. I just felt like they were missing something. Not as creamy as your typical mashed potato. Although we liked them, i'll stick with my recipe for Make-Ahead Mashed Potatoes. Thanks anyway!

This was great I did half the recipe and didn't add the onions.  It still turned out great.  I also added the cheese in the middle of cooking turned out wonderful!

Very tasty. Much more flavor than plain mashed potatoes - and we did not think they needed gravy at all. I used 1/2 cup of dried minced onion instead of grating one - because I was short on time. I thought it came out wonderfully and will continue to make it this way - much easier! I did think the leftovers the next day were very dry. Probably best used in another recipe or fried up as potato pancakes instead of reheated as is. My family enjoyed this dish very much and I will definitely be making it again.

Wonderful update on boring old mashed potatoes. The cream cheese makes for a nice subtle cheesy flavor, and the baking gives the dish a lovely crisp top. Thanks for the recipe!

i timed making this badly and didn't want to compete with my moms potatoe dish too so i almost didn't put this out. when more unexpeced guests arrived i had to pop it in the microwave instead of the oven at the last minute. i would love to make this again to see how awesome it turns out.  as it was it was still very very tasty, just obviously more dense aka not fluffy.  Will do again and edit review when i do:)

I loved this receipe! I was a big hit at Christmas.  I did change it a little.  I did not add the onion.  I did add cheddar cheese to the top of it for the last 5 minutes of cooking, just until it was melted.  YUMMY.  I might try putting bacon on top next time.

Not bad.  I brought this to a dinner party and people liked it.  Mine looked a little runny before putting in the oven but turned out great after baking and resting.

These potatoes rock! My husband and I love them and make them all the time. Works out great when he grills some meat b/c I can make this ahead of time, then throw it in the oven for an hour and hang out with him by the grill!

I never would have thought that I could eat mashed potatoes that were better than the ones I have made all my life. These however, were absolutely awesome. I used about 2/3 regular potatoes, and the other 1/3 I used sweet potatoes, since that is all I had on hand. My husband, who does not like mushy foods OR sweet potatoes, absolutely raved about these. Almost ate the entire tray himself! This is a keeper!

Made the recipe as listed. Was flavorful but dry. If I make it again, I would use a few less potatoes and add more milk and butter.

I thought they were just okay.  Tasted like regular mashed potatos almost too heavy for me.  Not a lot of flavor.  Boyfriend thought they were good but needed to add more butter.

Awesome! I didn't use Yukon Gold potatoes, but these were still great! So light and fluffy. I added some garlic and used onion powder with chives instead of an actual onion, but it still had great flavor. Does take a little longer, but definitely worth it.

This was a very good recipe, but I would not make it if you don't have a lot of time.  It takes awhile.  I would cook the potatoes a little longer next time until they're very tender.  Other than that it was very tasty.

Excellent potatoes. My husband said he would have given them 5 stars if there was garlic in it.  I will definitely make them again and would add some fresh garlic.

Good! Very simple recipe cream cheese gave it a nice gourmet flavor, I've substitute the onion. but overall good. Watch your potatoes in the oven.

These potatoes came out great.  I diced the onion up and it still had a great flavor.  I will keep this recipe handy!

These are the best mashed potatoes I have ever served.  The only change I made was to run the potatoes through a ricer after cooking instead of mashing.  These are destined to become a tradition at my house.

I made this a couple years ago for Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious. It's just a little tastier than the traditional mashed potatoes.

I halved the recipe for a family of 5 and it was plenty!  I followed the recipe but I used fat free cream cheese and fat free milk...but real butter!  Everyone agreed it was wonderful!  I did use the egg and they were just great...not dry at all!  And I paired it with Granny's Swiss Steak recipe which cooked along side it at the same temp for one hour and they both came out perfectly!  You really should try them together!  And don't forget the corn muffins!!!

I thought these were very good... I didn't have yukon gold so I used red potatoes - so maybe that made some difference - would still make again though.

excellent make ahead recipe.  I softened the onions in the butter while the potato's were draining and only added 1/2 the cream cheese to help cut down the cost and calories, still turned out great.

I am keeping this recipe.  It is a somewhat different way to prepare mashed potatoes. This potato dish is not really elegant, more of a comfort food.

Thank you for submitting Nancy!  I loved these potatoes.  This dish reminds me of eating a twice baked potato, but you get a heck of a lot more without the hassle!  I halved the recipe and ended up using one whole egg because some reviews complained of dryness.  I had no problems, and will make these potatoes often!

Sorry, we didn't care for these. Maybe I did something wrong.. I cut the recipe it half but followed the recipe otherwise. They were too dry. I'll make potato patties with the leftovers but I won't make this again. I'll stick with my own recipe.

This was really good.  I made this for Easter dinner at my inlaws and it was a hit.  I thought it tasted just a bit dry though.  Next time I might try adding just a bit of sour cream.

Really good, thank you!  Like another reviewer, I also cheated and used instant potatoes.  I didn't have any eggs so I left the egg out, and I didn't have an hour to wait, so I just mixed it up and then fried it a little in my electric frying pan... my kids LOVED it!

Thanks again for a great recipe! :)

I found these potatoes to be a bit dry although my guests loved them.  Next time, however, I'll probably stick to regular mashed potatoes instead of going through the trouble of baking these. . .
