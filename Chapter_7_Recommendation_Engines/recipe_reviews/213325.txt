I substituted the swiss cheese with shredded mild cheddar. I like this recipe with swiss too, but I think it was tastier with the cheddar cheese. ;)

YUM!!  I added about 1/4 cup of diced onions and topped with crumbled bacon before adding the remaining cheese.  So easy to make and I did this in advance of a weekend with friends, it carried over beautifully!

Made a variant of this last night using a can of spinach and peas. To say it came out perfect is an understatement, the picky teenagers loved it ,and I used up two cans of veggies. Perfect in the casserole dish, and have a slice leftover for breakfast. Pictures on my Facebook page. John price.
