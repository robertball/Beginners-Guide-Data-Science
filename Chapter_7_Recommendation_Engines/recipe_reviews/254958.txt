I had such high hopes for this recipe. I scaled it to 6 servings and followed the recipe to a "T", cooking this in my Instant Pot. It smelled wonderful, but I thought the flavors were lacking in the finished product. Almost too watered down tasting, which was surprising to me.

Turned out perfect - we loved it.  Using the pressure cooker was great and saved so much time.
