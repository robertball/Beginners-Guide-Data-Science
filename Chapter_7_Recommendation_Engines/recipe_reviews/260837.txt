Simple and really good, if you know what to expect from coconut milk and even if you don't. 

Caution to those new to using coconut milk though - it is much richer and thicker and creamier than your typical milk and you may not be able to drink a full mug (I can't). But it certainly hits the spot when you want to indulge a bit and are craving something chocolatey, dessert-y, creamy, and/or sweet. 

I added 1/2 cup of chocolate almond milk to make it go a little further and thin it out as my coconut milk was very thick to begin wtih. I also used dutch cocoa instead of dark chocolate.

For spices, I omitted curry, and added 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp cinnamon, a 1/4 tsp black pepper and a few sprinkles of all spice. I sweetened with stevia as I can't have sugar. 1/2 tsp for the batch did me fine. 

The whole batch gave me one very full mug's worth.

Wonderful! The curry powder is a lovely addition. I used a mini immersion blender. Thank you for the recipe.
