I originally gave this 3 stars, but I came back and upped it to 4 after tasting it again after it chilled overnight in the fridge. This is a lot tastier the second day. It really needed some time to let the flavors blend and mellow, otherwise, I only tasted a lot of lemon from the cake, and it overpowered everything else. By day two it was really smooth, light and refreshing, and something I think I will make again, but now I know to let it chill overnight before serving. Oh, and I used 12 oz. Cool Whip and it was almost too much, so I don't know why it calls for 16 oz. in the recipe, it would be spilling over the sides otherwise.

This cake was not bad, but did not have the flavor that I was expecting. I shared some of the cake with an elderly friend of mine, who was polite when asked how she liked it. Sorry Kim...

This is a great recipe. For variety try this:  I topped the crushed pineapple with banana slices, added a few drops of pina colada flavoring to the topping then garnished the top with shredded coconut, pineapple slices, and cherries. It was a big hit at our BBQ! A great summer dessert.

My Husband and I agreed that the cake had a good flavor (with the lemon and the pineapple juice) and the topping was delicious but we didn't like the texture of the pineapple. The cake was really moist and soft and then everyonce in awhile we would bite into a hard chunk of pineapple (and I had used the crushed). The cake was OK but I probably won't make it again.

This was a hit!! I have made it twice already for two different parties and everyone loved it.  I found you did not need 16oz of whipped topping 12oz was more than enough and you probably could get away with using 8oz.  Both times I let the cake chill overnight.

A cool, refreshing cake.  I toasted a little bit of coconut to sprinkle on top. Didn't last long at our family gathering!

very good! used lemon pudding and yellow cake mix, combined this recipe with 'lemon cake' from this site I think it was. I think different variants of pudding/cake mix could be used...lots of combinations! ALso, used oil instead of apple sauce. Thanks for the post!

it is very good but when eating you can tell its not real lemon. It's more of a pound cake with a hint of artificial lemon.

Great light dessert!  I served it with a choice of diced kiwi, strawberries and peaches just for color.  A big hit!

I thought this cake was absolutely great for summer. Delicious, but I changed a few things by making the lemon cake mix from scratch and instead of 1 box of pudding, I used 2. I kept it refrigerated until time to serve. The extra frosting my 6 year old son ate straight out of the bowl.

Just okay.  Some people suggested less cool whip so I used 8 oz. and it wasn't enough.  Use 12 oz. for sure.

I thought the taste should have been a little more intense.  It was ok, but I wouldn't make this again.

Love this cake ! so good I have to give most of it away or I will eat the entire thing myself! I will make this for parties it is a good one.The cake mix I used was Duncan Hines "Pineapple Supreme" and it was delicious . Also,I used lemon pudding for the frosting instead of vanilla and coconut on top . I prepared it with two layers with the pineapple and frosting in the center .Ok I guess I did not follow the recipe but loved it all the same . Thank you for the great ideas.

I've made this cake for countless barbeques since I first found this on allrecipes years ago.  It is always a hit and I get requests for it.  When I'm in a rush, I don't bother with the egg whites/applesauce, I just make it as directed on the box.  I have added fresh strawberries chopped small along with the pineapple which is also delish.  Toasted coconut on top has been a great addition too.

This was great! I used white cake mix instead, and then added lemon pudding mix into the cake batter. Will make again. Perfect for a light summer treat!

I made the pineapple cake with a box of Duncan Hines Lemon Cake and Jello lemon pudding, and a teaspoon of lemon extract then I made the frosting with lemon pudding and again with a teaspoon of lemon extract. It was wonderful it was moist and flavorful, my sisters loved it.

Its okay, but reminds me of the old Hawaiian wedding cake from years ago sans coconut and cherries and pecans.  I'd just as soon make that version.

This recipe is lovely and refreshing as it is.  The second time I made it, I changed it up a bit and used Pillsbury tropical mango cake mix.  And added the zest of an orange to the pudding and whipped cream. Used a little less than a full container 12 oz cool whip.  It was awesome!
