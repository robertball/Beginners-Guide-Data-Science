Perfect recipe. My hubby's new favourite pie! Can use canned peaches, but best fresh/frozen. Great tip is to turn oven off and open a crack when timer goes off. Let it cool in the oven for 1 hour before removing. Never a runny pie. Fantastic!

I made a variation of this pie and it turned out wonderful.  I used flour in place of the tapioca. I also used brown sugar in place of white and added a teaspoon of almond extract. I also used a can of blueberry pie filling because that is what I had on hand.  I read the reviews and found the comment tip about leaving the pie in the oven for an hour after you turn it off and it really made a huge difference.  Nice firm pie and very tasty already have requests to make it again. I did a crumb topping as well.

Make sure that you are using quick-cooking tapioca.  The pie is done when it bubbles through the slits in the top crust.  Follow this rule rather than a strict baking time.

I made this pie last night for my husband. I didn't have tapioca but after reading the other reviews I don't think that would have mattered.  I substituted 2 T of cornstarch and it did not get thick at all.  After looking at a peach pie recipe with the same amount of sugar, I think I will increase the cornstarch to 1/4 c. next time and that probably will do the trick. I will make it again as the taste was incredible - and I am NOT a pie eater.  I had one small piece at 9 pm last night.  There are only 2 pieces left - the hubby has eaten 5 pieces in about 16 hrs. - 2 for breakfast with vanilla ice cream.

Have made this pie 3 times in as many weeks.  Used a little over 3 cups peaches each time - only change.  Yummy delicious!  Made with the Short Sweet Pastry on this site as the crust.  So good.  Thanks for sharing!

I used frozen crust and frozen peaches & fresh blueberries. I thawed the peaches first and drained excess liquid from peaches before proceeding. Next time I will maybe try a crust from scratch - but the filling turned out really well and it was very popular.

Based on other reviewers' feedback, I adjusted the recipe to address the soupy results others had and it turned out perfectly. Instead of the tapioca, I used a little less than 1/4 cup of corn starch. I also only put about half of the liquid from the fruit and sugar mixture into the pie.  I let the pie rest in the oven for one hour after baking as others suggested. I found the 425 degree temp to be much too hot and even though my crust was protected by foil, it still got too dark. I will bake at 375 degrees next time and I think that will help. I also used a crumb topping. I brought to Easter dinner and even those who claimed they did not like fruit pie loved it!

Very yummy!  I used the refrigerated pie crusts and 1/4 c corn starch in lieu of tapioca.  My peaches were really juicy, South Carolina peaches and local blueberries which I had frozen.  I used a bit more fruit than called for and added 1/2 tbsp of apple pie spice and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon.  Pie set well after cooling.  Took to a friend's for dinner and it was a big hit, especially with vanilla ice cream on top.

I followed the recipe exactly, and ended up with a pie crust full of soupy peaches & blueberries, the flavor was delicious but I think something is missing, corn starch? flour?  I'm going to make it again and tweek the recipe by adding some starch. Next day after refrigeration the pie took shape!  I will make again and give it time to set in the refrigerator overnight

This is easy to make. I took suggestions from some comments about you can do frozen peaches. Flour instead of the tapioca. And let it cool in the oven for an hour. I did crack my oven door. It is delicious!

Nice combination of fruit, but I wish there was something other than tapioca that could be used to thicken it.  It's odd to see little tapioca pearls in the middle of a fruit pie.

This turned out just perfect! I made just a couple of minor changes: since others had mentioned that the pie was too runny, I drained the peaches in a colander for about 15 minutes after slicing, used 1/4 C flour instead of the tapioca and cooked at 400 degrees for 50 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

this turned out really nicely for me and was delicious. I used a butter crust, and used dried blueberries for part of the blueberry requirement. I tried substituting flour for tapioca and will probably not do that again. next time I will reduce to 3/4 cup sugar as well.

This is lovely. The peach and blueberry combo is light, sweet and just tastes like summer. I used a pint of blue berries. Peaches and blue berries are in season, so I cut back on the sugar. Like other reviewers, my pie was a bit runny, but mixed with a dollop of ice creme, who cares!

Didn't have quite enough peaches so, at my husband's suggestion added 2 cups of fresh ripe juicy sliced nectarines and the flavor turned out WON-derful!!  Also had to substitute flour for the tapioca. Spooned the fruit into the crust to avoid the extra cup of liquid that produced from the fruit. Forgot to add pats of butter but no one was the wiser. Perfect pie!

Turned out great, just a bit watery with the fruit juices. Any suggestions on how to decrease the juiciness?

This is my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE pie, a a lot of people get a watery pie if the peaches are juicy or berries are still wet after washing. If you're using them from a can pat the extra juice off before mixing ingredients. If when the filling mix is ready to go in the pie and there is a lot of juice still, the pie will come out watery. I also used flour to thicken instead of tapioca. The flavor is one of the best I have had in a pie even though it seems like a strange combination. It is one I'm keeping for my family recipe book.

Really enjoyed this recipe. I used two store bought pie crusts [cuz I was lazy] and laid the second one on top and pinched the edges together. It looked like a semi-professional job when I was done!
