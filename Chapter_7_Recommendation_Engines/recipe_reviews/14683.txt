I've been making this sauce for years.  First of all, I would double the recipe, second combine all ingredients in a sauce pan and bring to boil, the heat intensify the flavor, especially the garlic. I keep tasting it and adding more fish sauce, lime juice and sugar as needed until I like it.  Doing it this way, you also dissolve all the sugar, so the sugar wouldn't just settle to the bottom.

I'm feel bad giving this recipe such a bad rating. Vietnamese food is my favorite and this sauce did not taste right at all. The garlic over powered everything!!!!

Great sauce.  I especially like it because it isn't so salty like sauces that use soy sauce.
When making white rice I used half water and half this sauce.  Very tasty.

Just like the local Vietnamese restaurant!  The ratios are pretty spot on! [I left out the garlic as I don't normally see it in the sauces at the places I eat.]

This was..ok I thought. Personally preference I guess but I won't make it again. My son (who is the pickiest eater EVER) actually really liked it. But he won't notice if I dont make it again so I wont. It was just........bland to me.

I am by no means a fish sauce person, but I can tolerate it when made like this.  We served this with fried gourd and certainly a little goes a long way.  I would suggest adding a little pickled ginger (chop up fresh ginger into matchstrips and stuff into a jar...add enough regular vinegar to cover and let sit at least 30 minutes) to give it an extra layer of flavor...but it's good as is.  Thanks Maryellen.

A good start.  I found that heating the water in the microwave for 30 secs or so helped the sugar dissolve more easily. I added 1/4 cup more water and a pinch less garlic. Can substitute Sriracha hot sauce for red pepper flakes.

Great recipe.  There's no need to boil the sugar like a reviewer suggested, stirring does the trick.  Boiling will also change the flavor of the fresh garlic.

I used half the water, and still this was soooo bland. Nothing like I get in restaurants, and I love viet food. I would use almost no water next time. And more red pepper or use fresh for more hotness, and was too sugary. Not even sure that would help, the flavor was just wrong.

Tasted just like my local Vietnamese restaurants. I did just use 1/2 cup water and 1/2 clove of garlic. I also added a bit of shredded carrot. I added the water hot.

Good recipe. So simple. Per other reviewers, I reduced the garlic to 1/2 a clove and reduced water to 1/2 a cup.  Served with Vietnamese pork chops, rice, and fresh cucumber slices.  Tasted very much like the restaurants.  Now I can satisfy cravings at home!

instead of water, my mom adds 'coco soda' that you can buy at the market.  don't add too much or it'll be too sweet.

Don't follow the instructions. Just mortar three red chilies with a tablespoon of garlic and add lemon juice and fish sauce to taste. Done.

Not exactly what the restaurant gives you but the closest I have found.  I always heat mine up to dissolve the sugar.  just on low in a pot while everything else is being prepped.  Might try a little less fish sauce next time

Since it won't let me edit my review I will add another one. The second time I made this I thickened with corn starch stirred into part of the water. We liked it better this way. Bring to a boil until thickened.
