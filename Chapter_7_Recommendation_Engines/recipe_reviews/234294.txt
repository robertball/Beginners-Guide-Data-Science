This recipe is a great starting point. Because of the "or as needed" listed with the berries I was leery and added another cup and a half which was perfect (total 6 1/2 cups). I've never used tapioca before so I used 2 tbsp cornstarch mixed with the lemon juice and then I cooked the whole thing to thicken it. Once cooled I filled the pie. I omitted the butter and used a whole egg to brush the top (also sprinkled the sugar on right away) I baked it for 50 mins and it was perfect! Delicious. Jul/2016 Today I made this as tarts in muffin tins and it turned out delicious! Just cut large (4") circles of dough and fit into buttered muffin tins. Didn't bother with a top. Delish!

It turned out perfect. I too used about 6 1/2 cups of berries. I didn t have lemon juice so used lime juice and it was fine. I forgot the butter and brushed the top with milk instead of egg. The tapioca was just right for thickening and the right amount of sugar so it wasn t too sweet.

The berry: lemon: tapioca ratio also works great for any tart berry blend. I've used various amounts of toonberries currants pomegranate arils etc if I run out of frozen toonberries. If your berries start off frozen you don't need to cook them.

This is a good recipe. I also added more berries to fill my deep pie.

Just a note, British Columbia is a province in Canada, not a country. Alberta and Saskatchewan are considered prairie provinces in Canada, along with Manitoba. Otherwise my hometown's namesake pie is very delicious.
