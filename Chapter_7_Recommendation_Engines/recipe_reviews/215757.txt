This is similar to what I do - Instead of mincemeat I use turkey or ground beef. To add more flavor, i add garlic, diced tomatos, can of mushrooms, and a shake of red pepper flakes.  Fast way to jazz up a basic jar of sauce. Top with parmesan!

On pasta with just some cheese, I thought it was just ok. I didn't use a jar sauce but a homemade version of pasta sauce found on this website. I used canned mincemeat. Thank you kane for your recipe.
