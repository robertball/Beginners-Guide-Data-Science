This works perfectly.  I did use cocoa flavoured GF crispy rice cereal instead of Chex and cocoa powder and sugar.  It held up perfectly to my cheesecake.  Thanks Johnnycakes for this great idea! UPDATE 18/09/2014. This recipe works with GF corn flakes too!  I added 2 Tbsp of cocoa though. UPDATE 9 MARCH 2015: The best, tastiest, most versatile, fast and easy pie crust. Any gf cereal works. Today I made this instead of graham cracker crust by using gf rice krispies, adding cinnamon, a touch of ginger and brown sugar instead of white sugar and cocoa. It takes minutes to make and only about 15 minutes in the fridge to set, ready to be filled. Love this recipe!

I cannot add a rating or review because I have not made this, but unless Rice Krispies has changed their ingredients DO NOT use Rice Krispies it contains malt.  If you are on a gluten free diet you cannot eat anything that contains malt.

I used this GF pie crust for my Thanksgiving Pumpkin pie and it turned out great.   I used Maple flavoured Rice Chex omitting  the sugar since the cereal is already sweeten and omitting the coco powder again being the cereal was already flavoured ... Fantastic!

This is so simple and so good!   I used Chex Vanilla cereal and did not add any sugar.  Delicious!   Doubled the batch as some people didn't feel one batch was enough.  I had extra.  Used as a crunchy topping on a chocolate  silk pudding.  Wow was that devine!

I also had to make almost double the recipe to fill a 9-inch pie pan, but it was delicious.

This was so easy to make. My son who has Celiac loved that I made this for him so he can enjoy a delicious dessert along with Thanksgiving dinner. Thanks so much!

WARNING: Anyone who thinks that Rice Krispies are gluten free, they are not! If you have gluten allergies please use something else... like Rice Chex that are mentioned above!

Rice chex are fine. Rice krispies are not gluten free. They have malt in them, and malt is normally made from grains. When they remove the malt from rice krispies, then they will be gluten free. Otherwise, both brand name and grocery-store brand rice squares are okay. 
I certainly do wish rice krispies would find a way to dispense with the malt!  It's hard enough going gluten free without having to give up rice cereals as well. Or could they make malt from another grain?  Please, not corn or oats. Corn  and oats are as bad as wheat for me.  Something like amaranth, or quinoa?  Maybe teff?  I know buckwheat isn't really a grain, but can it be sprouted to make malt?  Too bad for me I became allergic to sorghum really quickly when I began baking gluten free bread with sorghum flour early on.  Just one more food allergy to go with eggs, beef and peppers, in addition to everything wheat, such as barley and those ancient forms of wheat, plus corn, oats, and sorghum.  I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting something.  I have a hard time keeping up. And lactose intolerance. Welcome, water kefir grains!

I had a 12" pie plate so I tripled the ingredients.  Very good and held up well.  I rarely make pie and even more rarely gluten free but I wouldn't hesitate to use this under any circumstances.  Many compliments on the crust.

Turned out pretty well. I added agave to make the crumble cereal more cohesive. Figure this could be done with any gluten free cereal. Planning on Cheerios next time.
