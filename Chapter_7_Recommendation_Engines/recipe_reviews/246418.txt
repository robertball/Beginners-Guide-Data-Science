So simple to make with great results. You can never use too much garlic. This easily adapts to a pressure cooker.

I added a package of Lipton onion soup mix halfway through the cooking time for additional flavor.  I also let sit overnight and we had it the following day, which improved the flavor.  In addition, I added 2 cupd of liquid, 1 water and 1 more of beef broth.  We liked this stew a lot, and froze 1/2 of it for later.  Next time I'll leave the tomato paste out of the recipe for a heartier flavor.
