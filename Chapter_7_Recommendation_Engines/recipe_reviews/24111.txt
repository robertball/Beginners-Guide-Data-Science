I did a modification on this one... I used an Oreo pre-made crust... I can't imagine it tasting any better! It was soo good and rich! My husband, who happens to be a peanut butter FANATIC, has claimed it to be better than any other he has tasted. Definitely a keeper recipe, I have already made it 5 times!

Delicious and easy. I used a graham cracker crust and didn't use as much whipped topping as suggested, also chopped reese's peanut butter cups and put on the top. Great for peanut butter lovers!

I have made this several times now and find it totally addicting! I go right by the recipe, except sometimes I use flavored pie crusts. Nice treat to have handy in the freezer...Just cut off your portion and let thaw.

This pie was delicious.  We served it on Christmas day and it was a huge hit with everyone!  It is very peanut buttery and creamy! YUM!

Try this pie with a graham cracker crust, it's just as good, and a little bit easier.

I love this pie. It is ridiculously easy to make. I used an Oreo pre-packaged pie crust, and drizzled the top with mixed chocolate chips and peanut butter chips. It tastes more like peanut butter than like sugar, which was what I was looking for in a peanut butter pie recipe... if you like that too, then I suggest adding 1/2 tsp of salt to the recipe to really bring up the peanut butter flavor. I am making it again this weekend... my husband loved it so much that he requested it for his birthday instead of cake.

Excellent Peanut Butter Pie, my husband and I are diabetic so I have to adapt each recipe that I use, but this one is the absolute best, and so easy.  I baked my first pie when I was 13 years old, it wasn't very good but I have made a lot of pies since then, and I must say this is the best and the easiest.  Three chears for Andrew.  I will make this pie again.  Thank you Allrecipes

I thought this was TOO "peanut buttery", was kinda thick and hard to eat. I think it could use a little more whipped topping for the filler. :)

Very easy.  Used a graham cracker crust and powdered sugar.  Definitely needs some chocolate in there somewhere - whether crumbled Reese's, chocolate chips, drizzled syrup or fudge topping.  I used what was on hand - drizzled chocolate syrup and chopped peanuts. But there was no 'wow' factor, probably won't make again.

I made this for my family Christmas party. Of all the desserts, this was the first and only to go. It was a huge hit! I got rave reviews on it. I do think the next time I make it I'll cut back on the amount of sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!! I also want to add that I used an Oreo cookie crust and drizzled melted chocolate on the top. Yummy!

I LOVE this recipe.  It was a huge hit with our Labor Day cookout.  I used a graham cracker crust instead of a traditional pie crust and drizzled chocolate syrup over the top.  Next time I might try using a chocolate graham cracker crust.  Yummy!  This one's a keeper!!

Very, very good.  Take just a sliver, it is very rich.  I used 1/2 cup sugar, plenty sweet enough.  I also used a chocolate graham crust, perfect.  My grandkids went nuts, and insist I make it again, and again.

Easy, delicious and impressive.  I used a pre-packaged oreo cookie crust, a little less whipped topping on top and drizzled with chocolate syrup.  It's always a hit!

this was a good recipe.  i used a keebler graham cracker crust because i was just looking for a quick & easy recipe.  at first i thought it looked pretty ugly with the filling in the pie shell when i chilled it for the first hour.  but after you cover it with the whipped topping, it looks fine.  and it tastes delicious.  it's really rich, so a little piece goes a long way :)  thanks for the recipe, andrew!  i'll make it again.

This was my first time making a pie (I'm only 20, lol) so I wanted something simple that everyone would like.  This was perfect!  It got good reactions from everyone who tried it.

Totally decadent! This is usually requested in place of birthday cakes now. I usually use a graham cracker crust or Oreo crust. I also always add chopped roasted peanuts and peanut butter cups on top. Sometimes with a drizzle of chocolate syrup. The great thing about this pie is you can really make it your own. And to the reviewer who suggested bananas  calling it Elvis pie is a riot!

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, used a chocolate cookie crust and added a layer of sliced bananas before the filling and miniture chocolate chips on top.
My grandkids call it the "Elvis Pie"

This recipe has a great peanut butter flavor. I made 1-1/2 times the recipe and it was the perfect amount for 2 store bought crumb crust. I used the chocolate crust. I can't believe how easy and delicious this is.

Awesome pie!  I made with a prepared oreo cookie crust & it was delicious. A big hit. I didn't use the 2nd container of cool whip, as I didn't think it needed it.  You can always add it to each piece.

Delicious!  I even topped it with some crumbled peanut butter cups for an added embellishment.  The extra slices didn't taste as well the next day though; best eaten the same day its created.  I will definitely be making this again!
