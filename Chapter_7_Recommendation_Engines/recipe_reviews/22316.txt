more like buttery sherpa mush (which isn't all bad). there's no mystery why this tastes good -- if you're making two servings there's half a stick of butter in here! way too much. and cooking them all together means the veggies are wilted and dead by the time the potatoes are ready. definitely needs onions, too. my recommendation for two servings would be to cut the butter in half and sautee the garlic in it. add the potatoes and cook for 5 minutes. add the carrots and cook for another 3 minutes. add the rest and cook for another 8-10 minutes. squeeze half a lemon into it, season with garlic salt, pepper, and a touch of cayenne. now it's a different recipe, but better, if you ask me!

Absolutely delicious!  I "doubled" the recipe and allowed veges to cook for 25 minutes rather than 15 (veges were still fresh, crisp but tender).  I recommend cutting all veges to a uniform size.  I always find measuring certain vegetables by cup measurements is difficult.  For those of you who can sympathize, I added the following measurements:  3 Tbsp butter, 2 cloves garlic, 1 large potato, 1/2 cup frozen peas, 1/2 pound broccoli, 4 carrots, 3 zucchini, 1 green pepper, 1/2 cup-3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  Following the recipe in this way, provides approximately 4 servings.  DELICIOUS!!

AWESOME!  A little touch of every thing right in 1 pan.  My daughter pretty much ate all of this (I made it 6 servings).  I actually didn't have time to cut the fresh veges that I bought, so I used a bag of frozen "capri style" veges (which contained carrots, zucchini, yellow squash, & french green beans), I left out the green pepper (because of the green bean addition), & I managed to dice the potatoes, chop the broccoli, and add the frozen peas.  Great recipe Barb, thanks!

This was pretty good. I think I need to cut the potato a little smaller so it cooks all the way through. Definately will make this again.

These were awesome! Omitted the peas and added some minced onion. Also, while they were cooking, I sprinkled a dash of garlic/onion powders overall. It wasn't until we were eating them that I realized I forgot about the cheese...oh well, these were great without it! Nobody could stop eating them! Thanks Barb!

Been making a variation of this for years!  Tastes even better when you add diced onions, and season with garlic salt and pepper to taste.

This rates five stars all the way around with me!  It's a terrific way to clean out the vegetable drawer in your fridge too.  A little of this and that turns out great.

Wah wah. /sad trombone sound./ At first glance, this recipe appeared to be something that I'd have thrown together in college, til I realized that I never would've had this many fresh vegetables on hand back then. Maybe I should've taken that as a sign to use canned veggies (to save on $$$ as well as all the chopping time) b/c I felt like it was wasted on this bland side dish, which BTW, was part overdone mush, part nowhere-near-done pebbles, even after 30 min. I chopped everything to near uniform size, as well as added onion, and sadly, we had to nuke everything in the microwave to have it ready w/ dinner, which resulted in a buttery mess. I saved it to the best of my ability - w/ a heavy splash of Texas Pete. On the other hand, my 3-year old gobbled her's up. If only I'd followed my 1st recipe instinct and just made a baked potato and done some simple steamed veggies on the side!

AWESOME!!  One of the best veggie sides that I've had with a meal.  I put the cheese on top while still in the pan and let it melt over the top & bind it all together.  I will definitely use this recipe many times in the future.  Well worth the prep work.

I'd actually give this about 3 1/2 stars.  The end taste was good.  However, I'd like to know the best kind of pan to make this in.  My pan is stainless steel and I kept having to add more butter because it was drying up too fast and sticking to the bottom.  The potatoes never did get brown, but I was surprised that they actually were the most tender part of it all.  I didn't have peas, zucchini, or bell pepper, and I used minced garlic instead of chopped.  But I added some baby spinach and garlic salt.  My husband said it was a keeper so I'll be making it (or variations of it) again.  Probably just in a different pan.

delicious - I started onions/garlic/potatoes/carrots early, added garlic powder, threw in some beet greens for the last couple of minutes, and melted cheese on top. 2 servings made one vegetarian dinner!

Made this last night and it was great. I didn't have zucchini (that would have been great too) so I added some celery finely chopped. I had a yellow bell so I used that, and added yellow onion as other readers suggested. Right before the cheese I threw in some fresh green onion and chives. Barb, Christian, thank you for the recipe.

I used this as a base for a healthy side dish to our salmon dinner tonight. I used two red potatoes, margarine, 4 garlic cloves, a red bell pepper, about 8 baby carrots, and some broccoli. I seasoned it with oregano, salt, pepper, and one juiced lemon. I left out the cheese.

I added salt while cooking and cucumber instead of zucchini as that is what I had. Added the cucumber in the end with the cheese.

Really good! I kept my veggie pieces a little larger to cut down on prep time and cooked them about 25 minutes, adding bits of butter as needed. I also added just a touch of soy sauce and sprinkled w/sunflower seed kernels. Tasty - and it cleaned out my veggie drawer!

This would be 5 stars with a few changes. I used only 1 tablespoon butter and added onion to the garlic/green bell pepper at the start. I followed another review that staggered the veggies so that they were all properly cooked (I used broccoli, carrots and potatoes since that's what I had on hand). I added a little water during the cooking process rather than adding more butter (I just drained the veggies in a colander at the end). I also omitted the shredded cheese and instead topped the veggies with the juice of half a lemon, salt, pepper and cayenne. It was delicious!

This is one of my most favorite go to recipes.  To avoid the "mush" I cook potatoes and carrots 5-10 minutes before adding the other veggies that cook quicker.  I always increase the amount of veggies, and often switch out different veggies (use mushrooms, onions, cauliflower, whatever you have available).  Also, it needs some seasoning including salt and pepper.  Great as side dish or main dish if cheese is increased and maybe bacon or ham is added.

I tripled the recipe - added 1/2 cup of diced onions - along with Peppr/Salt/Mrs. Dash/Tabasco/Worcestershire sauce - DELICIOUS!!! Like another reviewer says - great way to use up veggies that are maybe going to heaven. Will make this one again - maybe throw in some eggs to make a fritta. It's a keeper recipe for sure.

My husband and I were pleasantly surprised with how this dish tasted and how easy it was to prepare  I tripled the recipe (except for butter, only upped to 3 tablespoons total) to have enough for me and my husband because the recipe is only for one serving.  We ended up having one serving left over so the serving size holds true.  I cooked for 25 minutes b/c the potatoes were not soft enough at 15 min.  I added extra garlic and used reduced fat cheddar and it was yummy!!!  Adding this one to my recipe box.

I followed the recipe very closely although I didn't have any carrots on hand so I added string beans. I felt it needed seasoning quite a bit.  I added curry powder, cumin and black mustard seeds as well as salt.  I ended up liking it quite a bit.

Clean eating, simple prep and ingredients.  The cheese is a fun topping.  Reminds me of Marie Callendar's vegetable cheese dish.

I only used potatoes, green beans, and carrots.  It was a great side for meatloaf.  Can't wait to try the recipe the way it is listed.
