A simple and fast recipe with loads of yummy ingredients, but the end result was a little lackluster.  The flavors weren't popping and I disliked the texture of the polenta - if I made this again, I'd sear the polenta a bit on each side to cut the mushy-ness of the end result.  I added a little jalapeno for a kick too, that helped.

This has become one of my favorite appetizers to serve.  I love the cucumber in there!

Interesting combination but very good. Very Greek-inspired dish. We didn't have fresh tomatoes so used canned and it was still very good.

I made it without the olives since I don't like them, and without the cheese because I'm lactose-intolerant.  It was my first time making polenta, and it turned out great!

This recipe was really fast and simple, and was also a recipe I found I could easily tweak or add to without really ruining the taste.  I added a bit of jalapeno as well, and I used a jalapeno Havarti cheese to add a bit of zip to it.  Definitely will be having this again!

Made this for a quick lunch.  Added mozzarella on top instead of Parmesan and like the consistency. Only used one tiny can of olives and used more tomatoes than called for.  Overall a pretty good light meal.

Might be okay with homemade polenta; store-bought did not have right consistency

I made recipe exactly as written. The cheese was browned long before the polenta reached even lukewarm.  The topping was delicious - tasted fresh and summery - by itself, before putting it in the oven.  Might be great on bruschetta, but dish def became "lackluster" as another reviewer said once it went under the broiler.    Doesn't look anything like picture, as parmesan practically coats the veggies. May try to bake the leftovers to get polenta warmed.
