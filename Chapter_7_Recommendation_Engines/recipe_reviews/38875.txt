I consider myself a connoisseur of coconut cream pies and this is the best!  I accidently goofed on receipe and used one packet of vanilla pudding mix and one packet of coconut cream mix.  Wow!  I put low rating for kids, because I know most don't like coconut or nuts.  Also topped with Dream Whip and sprinkled with toasted coconut.

My 9 year old son made this with a little help fom me, using the mixer makes it fun! he cut it into slices and left them in the pie pan, taking out one slice at a time over a 1 week period and nuking it for 30 sec. Yum!

This was so very quick and easy.  i chose to use 1 pkg vanilla and 1 pkg coconut cream pudding & pie filling. I love the extra coconut flavor it gives.
