This was easy and tasty with a nice creamy texture! I made the recipe exactly as written, however instead of chopping the onion, I shredded it. I'm glad I did because I had a larger piece of onion in there that still had a bit of firmness to it.  I had this for dinner and it was really filling, and now I have some left for quick breakfasts this week!
