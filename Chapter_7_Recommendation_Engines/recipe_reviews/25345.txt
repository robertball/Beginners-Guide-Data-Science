The recipe is bland without some changes.  I made the following changes, and it was fabulous.  I added to the sauce mixture:  
1 tsp basil
1 tsp italian seasoning
2 cloves garlic
1 c. lowfat ricotta
1 sauteed zucchini
1 1/2 c. sauteed mushrooms
1/2 pack frozen spinach

and increased the spaghetti sauce to 2 cups, increased salt to 1/2 teaspoon.

I have used crumbled tofu in place of cottage cheese several times, and it always turns out great.  The key is to make the dish, such as lasagna, ahead of time, and let it set in the fridge overnight.  It allows the tofu to "soak up" the flavors from the dish, and masks the "tofu-y" flavor.  When you're ready to serve, just reheat it in the oven.

Made this again tonight.  Simpler this time around.  I layered my tofu btwn 2 plates wrapped in paper towel (changing often if they become wet)... I did this for about 30-45 min prior to making this whole thing.  The key is to NOT HAVE excess water in your sauce mixture--that's what makes it runny people!  Anyhoo after I dried my tofu I eyballed my spices in a lg bowl, parsley, basil, italian seasoning, oregano, pinch of garlic salt, lemon pepper, grated parm cheese (I'd rather use the fresh one, but wanted more flavor in this mix--fresh added later), minced garlic and a smidge of olive oil.  Mashed that all together the good old fashioned way (with my fingers--plus my toddler helped) and made it look like the consistency of ricotta cheese--amazing.  Still used that Costco size Ragu parm sauce for this-dumped the entire jar in.  Think it could be just a wee bit saucier, so I have a sm jar to pop open for the leftovers. Other than that...GREAT EASY RECIPE.  Oh yeah and hubby loved it last time... didn't suspect a thing!  My new way of making lasagna.

This is my FAVORITE recipe in the world! I make it all the time(i am having some tonight), the only problem is that you need almost twice as much sauce and cheese as it calls for and a bit more tofu, but it tastes amazing and even i can make it(i'm a 15 year old that can only make this and kraft dinner). try it, you'll love it!!!

Wow!  I just finished baking this lasagna and it is incredible.  I added ricotta and another cup of spaghetti sauce.  Also- for those new to tofu, make sure you press all the water out using clean dish towels or paper towels.  The "dryer" the tofu the more it can absorb all the good flavors of your recipe.

This receipe exceded my expectations.  I took some of the other reviewer's advice and added fresh onions and garlic to my sauce as well as doubling the cheese and using a whole jar of sauce.  Perfect!  If you like your lasagna juicy and cheesy you must use more cheese and definitely a whole jar of sauce.  I also used whole wheat lasagna instead of semolina, fat free mozz cheese and fat free pasta sauce (no one was the wiser, that's how good it was).  Definitely freezes well which is great when you are cooking for 1.  Next time will definitely add some spinach to the mix!

I love tofu, and I love lasagna ... I never thought this would taste soooo GOOD. I made some modifications to it based on other users reviews.  First I sprayed my pan with PAM.  In a large mixing bowl, I added a block of firm tofu (dried off w/ paper towel), 2 eggs, a couple gulgs of organic milk, kosher salt, italian seasoning, garlic powder, basil, nutmeg, blk pepper, mozz cheese, 3 cloves of fresh garlic chopped, and 1/2 a jar of Bertolli olive oil and mushroom sauce.  I smashed it all together for the ricotta consistency and then put this tofu mixture as my bottom layer.  I had 3 layers of noodles.  On my 1st layer, I put some sauce from the jar and some cheese; then the tofu mixture, then sauce/cheese.  I never measure my spices.  Just pour in a whole bunch cuz it tastes so good (or eyeball it, as Rachel Ray would say)!  Next time I may add some Boca ground meat sauteed in EVOO and garlic and add it as one of my layers.  Spinach sounds good too.  I bet my tofu-phobic husband will never know this lasagna was made with tofu!  Thanks for the great recipe! *UPDATE*: I successfully tricked my husband.  He LOVED the lasagna so I do not think I will ruin it for him by telling him about the tofu.  One thing I would probably try differently next time is to use plain sauce (not the tofu/sauce mixture) for the bottom layer.

I made this recipe for my meat-eating gf and myself. I was surprised at how much it makes.  I had plenty of leftovers.  However I strongly recommend that you follow what other reviews have suggested: a) use spaghetti sauce (I used a garlic & tomato one which was good) b) DOUBLE the amount of ingredients in the SAUCE mixture (I even think you could more than double it as I started to run out).  I didn’t use tofu but instead a meat substitute (Quorn Crumbles).  It is a good recipe and my gf was surprised that it tasted so good.  Next time I think I will add more (onions, garlic, maybe some vegetables).  Even the leftovers were good (I ate it all myself)

This was very bland. I did add more tomato sauce and of course I didn't saute the onion so I will next time. 
My husband said it needed some ricotta cheese... He said something was missing.

This was EXCELLENT.. and we're not vegetarians.  My 2 year old now has a new favorite -- she ate 3 servings!  The tofu almost faked my husband out (he thought it was ricotta) and he cringes at the thought of tofu! :)  He also had seconds.  I used Barilla no boil lasagne noodles (easy!), wound up using a whole jar of sauce (Ragu Robusto Garlic), almost doubled the mozarella.  Next time, I think I will add the spinach and artichokes, someone else mentioned, plus some ricotta cheese.  This was wonderful.. thanks for sharing your recipe!

No one in my family likes tofu.  I used the medium tofu recommended for lasagna and this recipe was given 5 stars by the family and they are willing to have this anytime I want to fix it.  WOW!

Made a few modifications as well - diced and sauted 3 cloves of garlic, and one each of the following: zuccini, onion, red pepper or green pepper, mushrooms with some olive oil and salt & pepper - then added it to the mixture of tofu, pasta sauce eggs and instead of milk i added light ricotta cheese. I baked this with whole wheat noodles and light mozza cheese - turned out fantastic, better than any beef or chicken lasagna! This has become a permanent recipe in my books!

I have been making this for a couple years now, and I still love it! We use brown rice lasagna noodles and I also add a zucchini, mushrooms, spinach, peppers and onion to the sauce mixture. I have fed this to many meat eaters who say they didn't even miss the meat AND they didn't even realize it was tofu! I usually can make two dishes (the second a smaller size) and freeze one for later. It is best cooked the day before and re-heated for dinner.

This lasagna is delicious! I've made it twice now (in 2 weeks). The first time I ended up with too-little sauce so the 2nd time I doubled everything except the tofu, noodles, eggs & milk.  2 cups of cheese seemed to be enough but you might want a touch more.  I added spinach (4-5 cups chopped), one onion and 2 cloves of pressed garlic. It is seriously the most delicious thing I've ever made but I highly recommend adding more ingredients.

I have read some recipes that advise to freeze tofu overnight to change the texture to more like feta or ricotta.

So I decided to make changes in the way I eat, this was my first Tofu "experiment" and I was very surprised with the outcome. Needless to say it came out fantastic and quite similar to the photo. I used shredded Parmesan instead of grated but it made no difference. My roommates and all our unexpected company enjoyed it as well. Def a must make again!

This was great! You couldn't even tell there was tofu in it! I did add about a 1/4c of lowfat cottage cheese in with the tofu mix. I loved it!

I added sauteed mushrooms, onions, zucchini and fresh spinach.  I agree that it is essential to press the water out of the tofu before combining it with other ingredients. I loved the richness of this dish but had trouble getting it to be flavorful enough. I added thyme, oregano, salt and pepper, but it was still a little bland.    All in all a great recipe!

We added two cloves of crushed garlic and about two tablespoons of red onion, and it came out wonderfully! We never would have known we were eating tofu (not that we have anything against tofu anyway!). Thanks for the great recipe.

This was amazing!  I took some recommendations below and added 1 tbsp dried basil, and also on my own advice 3/4 tbsp red pepper flakes and this was just absolutely perfect.  Decadent and wonderful vegetarian food, for sure!  5 stars!

With a few extras, this was fantastic! I took several other reviewers' advice and was very glad I did:  used a full jar of sauce, make sure the tofu is dried and doubled the cheese.  We also added a few of our favorite veggies: mushrooms, cauliflower, onions, zucchini as well as some Italian seasoning and red peppers. I think you could use whatever you wanted.  I added these raw to the mix and with a little extra cooking time, it came out great!  Will definitely be making again.

This is a pretty good recipe. I "healthied" it up a little bit more than it already is. I doubled the tomato sauce, added more spices (garlic, salt, oregano, etc), used 1 cup fat free ricotta, 1/2 cup low fat cottage cheese and also added half a pack of frozen spinach (thawed).   I also used fat free shredded mozarella cheese.  I turned out pretty tasty and now I have dinner all week (table for one)! I would definitely make this again for myself to have a nice, tasty, healthy meal but I don't think I would necessarily make it if I had dinner guests.

Believe it or not my husband recommended a 5star rating and he doesnt like tofu(really he doesnt like anything not "meat and potatoes"). I added a little more seasoning (garlic and onion powder) and it turned out great. Ill use tofu in my lasagnas from now on.

Great tofu dish. I also made a few changes like the others suggested:  drain tofu using paper-towels x 1 hour, add to the crumbled tofu  egg, 2 dollops sour cream (substituted for the milk), 3 crushed garlic cloves, pinch of rosemary, 2 TBSP parsley, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp basil, 1/4 tsp blk pepper & half of mozzarella (rest is used when layering). Also sautéed 1 onion and 8 oz mshrms in 2 tbsp olive oil and layered that in the first of the layers and used a whole jar of Newmans tomato and basil sauce (so about 3 cups).

passed with flying colors with my vegetarian sister. i would add more tofu and less layers of lasagna pasta to "beef" up the look of the lasagna.

This recipe is a keeper! I took the advice from other reviews & added more sauce & sauted veggies. This was only the second dish I have used tofu in & I am so pleased. The whole family loved it!

Very good recipe.  You really can't even tell that you're eating tofu.  I used a whole jar of pasta sauce instead of just 1 cup and I doubled the rest of the sauce ingredients as well.  I added fresh mushrooms, garlic, and chopped onions and it turned out fantastic!!  Try this one!!!

My carnivorous husband who won't touch tofu said it was delicious! good sauce is the key to all pasta so use your favorite. I used whole wheat lasagna noodles. I never pre-cook the noodles. I just rinse them in water and layer them on. Just make sure they are totally covered with sauce and will cook perfectly. I added 1 pkg of frozen spinach & 2 C of ricotta to make filling. Be sure to squeeze all the water out of the spinach and the tofu as was suggested above. These measures prevent runniness!

It's fantastic! I've cooked it for many of my friends and most of them couldn't tell that there's tofu in it! I usually add spinach, an onion, 3-4 cloves of garlic, shitake mushrooms to make it more favour. Thanks for the great recipe, Perry! =)

Tip:  Use oven ready noodles!  It soaks up the liquid nicely.  Let the lasagna sit for at least 15 minutes before serving.  Alone, this lasagna lacks flavour.  I added onion, garlic, fresh basil, mushrooms and ricotta cheese; I left out the milk.  Any changes you make to this recipe, will make it a 5 star!

Simply excellent!  Great flavor, easy to make, yields large quantity, and freezes well.  My only suggestion is to double the recipe in order to make 4 layers; as is, it only makes two layers which is thin for lasagna.

I hate tofu, but my husband is allergic to meat, so I decided to try this recipe.  I used the noodles you don't have to boil first. BIG MISTAKE! They turned out really chewy.  I really tried to forget there was tofu in it, but the texture was too gross. Definately needs more sauce. My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made. Good if you already like tofu, but not for me.

It was a pretty yummy recipe!  I used 1/2 of a jar of Ragu Extra Chunky Mushroom sauce (the big jar kind) and I should have doubled the mozarella cheese on top of the lasagna as well as in the sauce mixture because it simply didn't taste as cheesy as I thought lasagna should have tasted.  I also added 15 oz. of ricotta cheese to the sauce mix.  This recipe really had a lot of great potential, but it wasn't salty enough for me (next time I will double the salt) and it was really soggy.  I think that was just because I didn't pat the tofu dry enough.    I also added mushrooms and I think that if I hadn't added that, the lasagna would have gotten old really fast.  As it was, the mushrooms kept the taste interesting.  Next time, I will try adding zucchini or even cucumbers to see how it turns out!  This recipe tastes great as a leftover.  Definitely will try it again in the future and fine-tune it.  Also remember to really crumble the tofu up really well or it will just  have a weird texture in the lasagna (i.e.  be chunky and bland.)  I might also try making the sauce the night before and allowing the sauces and flavors to marinate the tofu.  Didn't really see the point of the nutmeg, but didn't see the harm either so I will continue to use it!

Great for first time tofu eaters.  I loved it.  I followed some of the reviewer's tips and doubled the sauce, as well as the cheese, and I added spinach.  It also freezes well.

Really tasty when pipin' hot and still melty.  I would recommend even adding fresh spinach in the layers or grated carrots for more volume and nutrition.  Really tasty- I think it ended up being even cheaper to make than regular lasagne too!

Since I can't eat too much cheese I thought I'd give this a try. Didn't tell the kids until they were halfway through about the tofu -- they loved it and now ask for it all the time for dinner!

DELICIOUS!!!! But I gave it only 4 stars because of the alterations needed.  1)Pressing the water out of the tofu is a must! 2) Definitely more sauce - especially with no-boil lasagna 3) More mozarella and add ricotta...  Okay, so basically I treated this as I would a "regular" lasagna. I crumbled the tofu and PAN FRIED it just as I would ground turkey- I even seasoned it the same. The only difference is I added the tofu to the cheese mixture instead of to the sauce.  I COMPLETELY fooled my husband (who does not like tofu) and the kids!!! Spectacular!!!! Will definitely make again, maybe even tonight!

So I'm not a big fan of tofu but...
I thought this was very good! I used the lite tofu, fat free cheese, wheat noodles (that you boil first) and used Mrs. Dash for seasoning.  I also threw in some eggplant, mushrooms and onion. I also had to increase the sauce, as others did.  It would be fantastic with spinach as well! My lighter version was definitely a winner and I'll be making it again!

I am going to give this a 5 stars. The lasagna is in the oven now. It was easy to throw together for sure. I forgot the nuymeg but I did add lots of garlic plus (hubbys must have) italian spices, onions, mushrooms spinach and salt and pepper. I also did not mix the tofu with anything but a little ricotta and spinach because I hoped to fool my husband into thinking it was ricotta. I used oven ready noodles. I made it early so the lasagna could "sit" in the flavors to be reheated in the microwave when everyone comes in at different times for supper. I hope this is a winner. I will let you know! UPDATE!!! After now eating this I can say I will make this again. It is so simple and it is tastely. Make at least 4 cups of sauce (possibly 6) and go to town on your favorite spices. The tofu tates likr cheese to me. I used mozza, riccotta and Parmesan liberally. In the end when we found it dry after doubling the sauce we reheated with V8 and added salt pepper and Franks red hot. It was very yummy with the dish taking on the flavors of the spices and seasonings that are your favorites. This was so easy and nutricious (I also use plenty of spinach) I will make again. You cant really taste the tofu unless you are just crazy picky (its all in your head) Every picky person in my house ate this and liked it. This works very nicely and I will definately whip this easy recipe up again due to the ease and nutricional value.  One last tip. Use extra firm Tofu and you wont have to worry. A winner

I didn't even recognize the tofu, so good!  I froze my tofu without the water overnight for texture.  Then I defrosted in the microwave for about 3.5 mins.  I then got all the water out with paper towels.  Many reviewers were saying they missed some seasoning, onion, & garlic...so I used roasted garlic & onion spaghetti sauce.  It was the perfect combination and I did not need to add anything else.  I did add 1/4 cup of cottage cheese and it added the texture needed.  I do recommend pouring your left over sauce in the bottom of the dish and stacking on top of that.  The noodles on the top were hard, next time I'll try baking covered.  You won't be dissapointed, my 4 year old even liked it. I will be making this again with my left over noodles.

Very easy to prepare this recipe. And its completely delicious too. Alterations: I added half a cup of fresh green vege.I don't think it was spinach but it tastes like spinach tho, added some fresh mushrooms, italian herbs, 4 cloves of garlic and one big onion which i chopped up.I didn't have any fancy cheese on hand so I used about 6 slices of kraft cheese. after each meat layer I would add that.WAs fantastic and not too caloric, best part, this made me not even miss meat lasagne. Enjoy!

Delicious!! I took the advice of previous reviews and doubled the sauce and all that was mixed with it.  Used a cup of lowfat ricotta to add with the tofu. Also added some mushrooms, spinach, couple cloves of minced garlic, basil and italian seasonings and some chopped onion.  Also, very important as stated previously..make sure the tofu is DRY.  This is a wonderful recipe and it will be used many times in the future.

I have never liked tofu but my 19 year old is a vegetarian so I made it for her... I loved it!!  Everyone that tried it thought the tofu was ricotta cheese. I mixed everything together and left in fridge overnight to let the tofu absorb the sauce then made the next morning.

I decided to follow LJ's advice, and added crushed garlic, half a pack of frozen spinach, one sauteed zucchini and a cup of sauteed mushrooms to the sauce mixture. I also used more spaghetti sauce and about 500gm of tofu. It turned out a little mushy but was still really tasty and pleased everyone. Try it out. You can mix and match with veggies that take your fancy.

Pretty good recipe but slightly bland.  I added a bunch of dried herbs/seasonings.  Also sprinkled some red pepper flakes on top when serving.  Definitely not enough sauce like other reviewers said - I used about 2.5 cups.  I got both kinds of reactions - one person said she'd still prefer it with meat, the other didn't realize it was tofu at all.  As for me, I like tofu and I'd definitely make this again.

I also added a number of ingredients and cut the cheese in half, and it turned out great! (fresh garlic, fresh basil and parsley, spinach, mushrooms, squash, fresh stewed tomatoes and paste to the sauce)

This was a great recipe. I did make the following changes: increased salt to 1/2 teaspoon; used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce. I also added 1 medium sized onion chopped; 3 cloves garlic minced; 1 Tablespoon fresh chopped basil; 1 Tablespoon dried basil; 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning; 1 teaspoon dried oregano; about 2/3 cup fresh spinach torn into pieces; pinch of crushed red pepper; extra cheese (both mozz. and parm.) Next time I will try adding about 1 cup lowfat ricotta. YUM!!

Great recipe, thank you.  I have made this recipe a couple of times and found the following changes to be useful: (1) I purchase the lasagna noodles that don't have to be pre-boiled.  This saves on time and dish washing.  (2) I use 1.5 to 2 jars of pasta sauce.  This adds moiture and flavor to the recipe.

There wasn't nearly enough sauce for the recipe, barely enough to cover two layers of noodles. I ended up dumping the sauce back in, emptying out the jar of spaghetti sauce and adding a 15 oz. container of ricotta cheese since I didn't have enough tofu for a double batch. I thankfully had bought two bags of shredded mozzarella as I used one in the sauce and  about 2/3 of the other for the topping. I also threw in some finely chopped garlic and it ended up tasting fantastic. It's a good base recipe but definitely needs some tweaking, hence only 3 stars

I'm only giving this 3 stars because there is no way that the sauce as written can adequately cover a lasagna in a 9*13 pan. I doubled the tomato sauce (using spaghetti sauce and basil to counter the blandness) and even then could have used some more. I ran the tofu through the processor and my husband thought it was cheese, lol. Overall a good way to use tofu, but if you like sauce in your lasagna, definitely increase the tomato sauce.

I haven't eaten tofu before so I was looking for a good recipe for my first experience.  This was easy and tasted great.  Thanks.  I will definitely continue to experiment with tofu.

Band! It needs onion and a lot more veggies and more garlic. I would also add more sauce and seasoning. However, it is a great start to a tofu veggie lasagna. I would not serve this to guests as is though.

I made this WITHOUT the cheese. I also did not mix the sauce and tofu. Instead I layered the tofu mixture, noodles and the sauce. My 2 and 7 year old LOVED it! I will make this again.

suprisingly good. I was given some tofu and had no idea what to do with it.  I tried a few recipes and most ended up in the garbage.  This one however was a keeper. Even my husband said you couln't tell it was in there.  I did add lots of extra seasoning to try to cover the taste of the tofu and I guess it worked.

This turned out to be absolutely delicious! I did feel the need to add some things; as written this would have been a bit bland for us. First of all, I did separate layers of sauce and tofu mixture (I guess just to make more work for myself. lol). I sauteed three cloves of garlic and plenty of fresh mushrooms in olive oil, then added 3 cups of spaghetti sauce and let it simmer together for a while. I squeezed by tofu out by hand before crumbling and didn't have any problem with the lasagna being watery. We absolutely loved this and I will definitely make it again. Thanks! :)

This review gets five stars for the fact that its the first time my husband and I tried tofu and it was totally "hidden" in the recipe and has gotten us to try tofu and get over our fear of it.  But to be honest if I just rated it for taste only, then it would probably get 3 stars.  As other reviewers have said, it far to plain and really needed some vegetables in it to bulk it up and make it more substantial.

Great use of tofu in this recipe that really gives it the same consistency as ricotta. You really do need to season to make up for the sweetness and saltiness that the ricotta usually provides.   While I enjoyed this recipe and plan to make it again with my own additions, I did find that the measurements weren't quite right. I would have used an additional package of tofu and a bit more seasoning. Still this is a great base to add your own items to.  p.s. to make the tofu less watery ... a couple hours before you make, press it between two paper towels and lay something heavy on the top (I use a plate and a book) to drain some of the water out.

I give 4 stars because of my modifications.  I sauted minced onion, carrot, bell pepper and garlic which I added to the tofu mixture, as well as one pack of spinach. I used 1/2 jar sauce in mixture and the rest for my layers. I omited the milk and used no boil noodles.  I made 3 layers, each time adding sauce to the top of the cheese.  I coated the bottom of the pan with sauce first.  I cooked 40 min covered and then 5 min uncovered.  WOW!  turned out yummy!!  I don't think the kids will be excited with the spinach, but its good for them, right!  Turned out being a cross between a lasagna and a quiche.  Tofu....what tofu....no one will know the difference!  This is one you can really play with.

Excellent recipe!  I did make a few changes though: instead of parsley, I used spinach and omitted the milk altogether.  I used very generous portions of cheddar with the mozzarella.  The crumbled tofu was mixed with tomato sauce and ricotta cheese and left to marinate for about an hour.

I will definitely make this again!

I really love this recipe, the only problem I had was finding vegetarian Parmesan cheese (none calf rennet) which doesn't seem to exist, at least in the UK, but I found Tesco in the UK do a good vegetarian substitute which tasted great! Thanks for the recipe.

It was pretty good. I doubled the filling/sauce recipe because, as others have noted, there simply wasn't enough. But I used a cup of lowfat cottage cheese to keep the saturated fat in check.

The taste factor was pretty good, I added a little mace to help highlight the nutmeg. The texture left me a little wanting. It felt like it needed a bit more substance, perhaps some cashew pieces (I've had great success with those in other lasagna dishes). 

This would, however, be an ideal dish or base dish for someone desiring to incorporate more tofu (i.e. lowfat protein) into their diet. I would suggest the addition of spinach or other substancial fiber or protein.

This was really good. I used a whole can of tomato sauce and still think it could have used some more. Next time I will also add more veggies, zucchini and mushrooms. UPDATE: Made this again, sauteed mush and zuc's with onion and garlic. So good! My hubs and 5 yr old love this too.

This was pretty good.  Only 4 stars because the tofu was a bit bland and not flavorful.  Needed some tweaking.  But because I didn't have any cottage cheese for the filling, the tofu was a good substitute.  At least the family ate it!

Loved it!  I made a mistake while halving the recipe and still added a cup of cheese to the mixture instead of 1/2 cup, but it was still amazing... maybe even better.  Friends loved it.  If you don't have any spaghetti sauce on hand, use canned tomato sauce.  Next time I might add vegetables, though.  But yes, I will be making it again and replacing it with any other lasagna recipe I was holding on to.  Thanks for sharing!

This is by far a much healthier version than the ricotta version we all know and love.  Make sure you pick up 2 jars of sauce.  Use some to pour into the tofu mix, and use the rest as you create your layers, finishing with a layer of sauce on the top followed by grated cheese.  The tofu itself is rather bland, so the sauce really helps to make it yummy.

I just finished eating this moments ago, and though it was great!  Based on other reviewers, I made a few changes.  I 1) used a whole bottle of speghetti sauce (Ragu- tomato, basil & onion), 2) I added 2 cups each of baby portabella's, zucchini, roma tomatoes, and eggplant, which I just sprinkled over top of the sauce in between layers, and 3) I covered the top with italian-seasoned bread crumbs and sprinkled some parmesan over top of that before I baked it, I think it added a little something extra.  With the addition of the veggies, I reccommend cooking it 35 - 40 minutes. The only thing I would really change is to attempt to get most of the moisture out of the tofu first, as this tended to water down the sauce and make it runny.  My roommates liked it as well (even though no one is vegetarian!)

A must-try for anyone who has not tried tofu and is reluctant to do so. It did turn out really good! I would recommend using a thicker tomato-y sauce, to make up for the fullness and texture the meat usually gives regular lasagna. If you are curious about tofu, give this a try---you will like it lots!

Really, really good! My only suggestion is an extra layer or two of marinara sauce because there is a lack of tomato taste. A sprinkling of Parmesan cheese also adds some zip. Wonderful texture though!

Delicious.  I loved this dish.  I have had a hard time in the past with Tofu.  Being a new vegetarian, I was looking for a tofu dish I would like, having failed in the past.  If it wasn't for me actually making it myself, I would have never known there was Tofu in it.  Thank you so much.

Very good!  I'm vegan so I used Daiya cheese in Place of mozzarella, and used nutritional yeast in place of Parmesan, and unsweetened soy in place of milk, and skipped the eggs.  I also added a lot more spaghetti sauce, probably almost an entire jar.  I brought it to work and shared it with my non vegan friends, and they couldn't get enough!

Like many other reviewers I had to add extra ingredients to give it more zing, and it needed a LOT more sauce. Luckily I had more in the house! It had a strong tofu flavor but was still very good.

So yummy! My kids said it was the best lasagna ever. We have never eaten tofu before. I did not fool around with the spices I just used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce. Next time I will double!

I will make this again but I do not suggest following the recipe exactly.  I used a can of sauce (always doctored-up with extra garli and wine, Newan's Own Traditional Herb Organic),omitted the nutmeg, and added lots of onion and peppers pre-cooked in olive oil with wilted spinach.  This recipe looked boring to me without the additions but it's a good base reference for a vegetarian dish like this one.

Very good base. No one knew tofu was in it. I followed other recommendations and added spinach, zucchini, onions and mushrooms. I doubled the sauce and cheese. I left the milk out and still found it to be too wet. I did drain tofu well. I added extra seasonings.  Its a base recipe. Do what you like. Get creative. I dont think you can go wrong.
Update:  no added milk.  Not too wet. My kids 9 and 14 actually fight over the leftovers. I made a pan for a friend and her boys 7 and 5 only want this lasagna from now on.

Tastes pretty close to regular lasagna.  The tofu almost seems like ricotta cheese.  Could definitely get used to this and very easy to make.  Will make again.

I found that I had to make so many alterations to this recipe to bring it up to standards - needed more sauce, more seasonings, more cheese, etc. - that by the time I was finished it was not even the same recipe anymore.

This was so simple and healthy, yet every bit as delicious as my standard lasagne.  I used whole wheat lasagne, 16 oz of tofu, a 12 oz jar of Bertolli sauce plus a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes, and 1 tsp of Italian seasoning (plus a handful of fresh basil from the garden).  I used colby jack in place of mozzerella, because that's what I had, and I used more than the recipe called for just to cover the pies.  I added about 3/4 lb of cooked ground meat to satisfy my husband, then I made it into two 12x9 pans.  It was great!!!

This is definitely a keeper.  I did freeze the tofu which helps the tofu to be firmer.  I used an extra cup of sauce and did not use the milk at all.  I also threw in a cup of ricotta (which I can't really get, so I really used a cup of cottage cheese), and the family said they couldn't tell that it had no meat.

This is a great recipe - but I agree w/other users that I needed more sauce (which I like lots of) and I added some additional spices/ingredients including choppoed spinach, garlic, onion, italian seasoning, basil and a little bit more salt.  An awesome dinner - thank you!

Per everyone else's suggestion, I used 2 jars of sauce and 2 cups of cheese for the sauce mixture. I also added a layer of spinach, mushrooms, onion and zucchini and increased the amount of spices. (used cinnamon instead of nutmeg w/no problem.) Turned out great.

This was good.  I added a whole vidalia onion, lots of mushrooms, olives sprinkled on top of the last layer of cheese, extra spices and used almost a whole jar of spaghetti sauce rather than just a cup.  It definitely NEEDS those added ingredients and more.  It did taste a little bland even with the extra stuff so next time I think I will add some more veggies, more spices and a whole jar plus half of another jar.  Then it will probably be PERFECTO!!!

I used other's suggestions of adding 1 tsp Italian seasoning and 1 tsp of basil.  I also added a small diced eggplant.  Very good!

i used soy cheese and added zuchinni and mushrooms, and also doubled the sauce. it definitely needs the veggies for substance. i thought this was fantastic, but got only "it was okay" from my family, hence the 4 stars. i would make this again, and continue to tweak it.

Would give it 6 stars if I could.  I have made this several times, added ingredients for a little more flavor as others have suggested, but anyway you do it turns out very enjoyable and such a  great tofu dish.  You honestly would never know it isn't ricotta cheese, my husbands Hates tofu and would eat this for days!

I love ricotta in my lasagna, so I tried most of the modifications suggested in LJ's review (below): added 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp italian seasoning, 2 cloves garlic to the tofu, then layered 2 c. sauce with the cheese/tofu mix. MMM!

i think this is a good starting base but it would benefit from adding more things. there was nowhere near enough sauce in the recipe and it tasted pretty bland. spices, some garlic, onion, mushrooms (and maybe spinach) would really make this delicious.

Fabulous veggie lasagna!  I used two jars of sauce, doubled the cheese and sauteed some mushrooms in a little olive oil and garlic and threw that in there with some extra spices--it was GREAT!!  My whole family (including two small children) loved it!  Tons of leftovers.  I will definitely make this again.

sooo easy and healthy and the tofu texture came out great!  My bf couldn't even tell the difference.  I used no boil lasagna noodles, added 1/2 lb ground chicken and mushrooms and only put cheese on top to cut down on fat.  A little more salt and pepper and definitely use 1-1.5 jars spaghetti sauce.  Great recipe!

I would never have thought to use tofu in place of ricotta cheese in lasagna! The consistency is very similar, but it's a little bland and definitely needs additional herbs and sauce.  Thanks, Michelle!

Absolutely delicious! I did what others recommended and doubled the cheese and used a full jar of spaghetti sauce. I also added some onions. Next time I will add some more veggies and double the sauce as well. My husband had no clue that I used tofu and he LOVED it! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

this was an easy, yummy recipe. I ended up making the filling one and half times with the normal amount of noodles and was glad i did because it filled it out more.

This was yummy!  Even my 5 yr old son who is a picky eater liked it!  This is a great way to get protein in a healthier way.  We did not miss the meat taste at all.  My husband would've liked more sauce so I'll double it next time.

Oh so yummy! I doubled up on the stuffings of this lasagna as suggested and it is wonderful. I made it for a friend who never had tofu and she said, "If we didn't know it was tofu, we wouldn't have been able to tell." Quite a compliment from a meat eater! My three year old son loves it also. Quite a winner in our house.

I had to add extra sauce and a little cottage cheese to stretch the mixture. I used 14oz of tofu and it was still barely enough for 3 layers in a 9x13 baking dish. Next time I will either double the filling recipe or use a smaller baking dish. The taste was good though.  I didn't have dried parsley so I used twice as much fresh minced parsley. I served it at a Christmas party and even the carnivores liked it.

Like everyone says, it needs more sauce.  Fine with the same amount of tofu and eggs, but double all the rest.  Adding vegies makes an already delicious meal even more tasty.  Thanks for the submission!

I made this tonight and had to stop myself from having FOURTHS!  Next time I make it (and I know I will), I'll add more sauce and more cheese to the "sauce mixture".  I used 16 oz. of tofu which I thought was plenty.  I also recommend adding a whole bottle of sauce to the recipe.  It was so delicious!  I can't wait to eat it again tomorrow and the next day...

Just made this for family and guests and they all loved it!  I didn't have some ingredients, so I did a few substitutions.  Sub ricotta cheese for mozarella and for the top layer of cheese, had to use monterey jack since I had no mozarella.  I added spinach and shredded carrots to the mixture and used 1 1/2 jar of spaghetti sauce.  They all ate the bottom layers but didn't really touch the top, I'm guessing the jack cheese didn't go too well with the recipe.  Anyhow, it was a hit and I'll be making again soon.  Thanks!

So, I have a household of 4 men who happen to be carnivores and they were floored that there was no meat in this lasagna!  They and I loved it so much that there was absolutely no left overs. The only things I did differently is sauteed 6 cloves of garlic with fresh mushrooms and used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce.  This is definitely a keeper and they requested I make this again and soon!

My five year-old nephew proclaimed this to be the best lasagna he'd ever eaten.  My omnivore family enjoyed it, never suspecting they were eating tofu!  ; )  I sauteed red peppers, onions, and garlic, I added (too little) chopped, steamed kale, and I used a whole jar of pasta sauce.  It certainly did help to press water out of the tofu, as others suggest.  I will be making this again, with more veggies.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this recipe exactly as is...it's delicious! I used a whole jar of spaghetti sauce...1 cup definitely wouldn't have been enough. Next time, I'll probably add spinach and some more spices to the mix. I used oven-ready lasagna noodles to save time.

I added a package of italian seasoning to the tomato sauce for extra flavor.  This is a really good base recipe and a good tofu recipe for those who may not like the original texture.  It does however need some vegetables or meat to make it less boring.

Very good! A wonderful healthy alternative. We used preseasoned tofu, and doubled the sauce. Will try adding roasted vegetables next time.

I made this receipe a couple of weeks ago for the first time and made the changes suggested by LJ (thanks) WOW, love it.  My husband is a big meat eater and wanted meat added but because the reviews were so good on this receipe I wanted to try it as is.  Well he had no complaints at all.  He had seconds and took some to work for lunch the next day.  It is easy enough and well worth it, but I recommend the added changes and you definitely need extra sauce.

This is the only way I can get my husband to eat, and LOVE, tofu. This recipe is truly fantastic. I add extra spaghetti sauce and some extra herbs & seasonings.

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be quite pleasant.  I was also a little leery about tofu, but was pleasantly surprised.  Next time I will use a full can of sauce.

I made a dairy free version of Tofu Lasagna and my dinner guests loved it!
Tofu Lasagna:  mash together one 1 lb. soft tofu, 1 lb. firm tofu, 1 T sugar, 1/4 cup soy milk, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, 2 T. lemon juice, 3 tsp. minced fresh basil and 2 tsp. salt.  The mixture should have a ricotta-like consistency.  Layer tomato sauce, cooked noodles, the tofu mixture and drained frozen spinach, ending with a layer of noodles, covered by tomato sauce.  Bake at 350 degrees for 25-30 minutes.

This lasagna is great.  Everyone I made it for ate at least 2 servings.  I added more sauce because it seemed dry.  I, also, added ricotta cheese to mask the tofu.  Nobody knew that it contained tofu.

I made no changes and was very happy with this Italian tofu dish. The only issue I had was that the breaking didn't stick well, but that could have been my fault.

This was awesome! My family hates tofu, but even they likes it. I used extra sauce, and added some cottage cheese and sautéed spinach and mushrooms. Perfect.

Needs more spices, it is bland.  I was desperate for something quick and easy for dinner, and I had a package of tofu, found this recipe.  I didn't have any mozzarella (shocking) but had fresh Parmesan and 75% reduced fat cheddar.  I shredded the cheddar and used the entire 2 cup pkg of Parmesan.  All I had was a combination of WW and white noodles, so they were used.  I did substitute garlic salt for regular and threw in the remains of a pkg. of sun dried tomatoes with peppers during the last minutes of cooking the noodles.  I used a whole jar of sauce, layering the sauce on the bottom of the pan, layering noodles/tofu mixture.  We had to sprinkle red pepper flakes on the finished product to jazz it up, but I'd make this again with sauted onions, garlic, peppers, etc.

I rarely rate recipes 5 stars. This tofu lasagna recipe is my new favorite recipe. I too was able to fool a meat lover family member with this. The comments in the other reviews are dead on. What really made this recipe awesome---I added spinach, sauted mushrooms, onions and garlic. I also used Classico Fire Roasted Tomato and Garlic sauce which gave this dish a kick with the chunky tomatoes. I used Lucerne Italian Four Cheese Blend. Be sure to drain your tofu usimg paper towels. try to get all of the water out of the tofu. Someone actually recommended doung so fir 35 minutes prior to preparing this dish. This is a must or ur lasagna is sure to be runny. Overall, I Lovvvvvveeeee this recipe. Everyone must try it.

This is pretty good; I doubled the cheese and more than doubled the spaghetti sauce, based on other reviews.  I used the pre-cooked Barilla lasagna noodles because I wanted the half-sized noodles to fit smaller casserole dishes.  Next time I'll try this with the Hunts Chunky Vegetable spaghetti sauce and add a few more vegetables.  Or just use my regular lasagna recipe and use the tofu in that recipe.  Love the idea, but it was okay, but not great, for us.

DELICIOUS - with some modifications. The modifications made it a 5 star meal. I used twice the mozzarella and an entire jar of spaghetti sauce. I added one jar of drained artichoke hearts, (roughly chopped), a couple cups of fresh baby spinach, and 5 cloves of garlic and 1/2 an onion, (chopped and sauteed in olive oil first.)  

Definitely a good base, but I feel like the modifications, (some based on others suggestions), definitely added to the flavor and the look.  

Enjoy!

I thought that it was OK, but not outstanding.  However my 17 month old thought that it was the best thing since chocolate.  She asked for thirds even though she was full.  I have not seen her eat so well in months.  I will definitly make this one again.

I am vegetarian and very familiar with tofu but this recipe was not good at all. I even tried adding sautéd mushrooms and zucchini and increased the cheese and salt and pepper.  Dry and could taste the tofu too much even the next day. Not worth the trouble. Unless you are vegan, just use low fat ricotta cheese.

I used trader joes red pepper sauce with the tofu. It added a really nice flavor.

I had bought tofu and was wondering what to make with it. I came across this wonderful recipe and decided to give it a try. I also had a few vegetables left like 1 carrot, 1 capsicum, a couple of other peppers and half a broccoli. I heated olive oil in a pan, added 5 cloves of garlic. Added the veggies. Sauteed it till broccoli was cooked. I followed the rest of recipe but forgot the milk. Added basil, Italian seasoning salt, oregano, garlic salt, onion salt and red chilli flakes. 

The lasagna held itself well. It tasted good, but some of the larger broccoli pieces tasted bitter. I would probably avoid broccoli next time and remember milk. Although i didnt miss it, i would like to see the difference.

So third times the charm when trying to make a review with out getting kicked out off the page. I added onion spinach cottage cheese and basil. I used more than the one cup that was recommended. I also used ready to bake noodles and cooked for 40 minutes.

I made this for the fam today, and we all loved it. Real comfort food. I did make a few changes as always. Per some of the comments, I drained the tofu,  and added the one cup of spaghetti sauce and some sauteed onions and garlic along with oregano and basil and some of the parmesan. I used the rest of the jar of sauce and layered it, starting and ending with the jarred sauce. It was so good! My brother-in-law was thrilled and instantly packed away a big serving for lunch the next day. He said "you can make that again"!!

We want to eat more vegetables and less animal products, so I'm testing vegan and vegetarian dishes. My first time ever cooking or eating tofu. My family doesn't want to ever eat it! And the kids dont like vegetables, but what they don't know.... I took the advice of other reviewers. 
I drained and dried the tofu with paper towels.  
Used Barilla gluten free oven-ready lasagne.  
Sauteed 3 tbsp of minced garlic, half a red onion diced, half a tomato diced, handful of spinach and a handful of diced mushrooms in olive oil.
Mixed the tofu, 3 tbsp ricotta, eggs, sauteed veggies, substituted the milk with heavy cream; salt, blk pepper, thyme, parsley, basil -all eyeballed.
Layered the baking dish: Muir Glen organic Fire Roasted Tomato pasta sauce, lasagne, tofu mixture, sauce, parmesan and mozzarella. Repeat 2x. Baked at 350 for 55 minutes (the pasta was still hard at 35 min). I made a small dish. My kids liked it. They don't know what tofu tastes like so they ate it. I froze half of it so my husband can try it when he gets back home. It was delicious!!! I will be making it again.

I love this recipe. I do use a whole jar of sauce, as it is a bit lacking as written. Sometimes I add cooked ground meat, sometimes not. It is amazing both ways. I also like to add in a layer of veggies such as mushrooms and spinach. I don't drain/dry the tofu first, and have never noticed problems with too much moisture or "tofu flavor". This is my go-to lasagna recipe, and easy to jazz up with additional flavors as well.

Very tasty. I added the rest of the jar of sauce as I layered. Don't forget to drain the tofu. I seasoned with Italian seasoning, garlic and onion powder, seasoned salt and the rest of the listed seasonings.

Like many had said, it was a very bland recipe. I had anticipated having to add spices etc. Added spinach and a mixture of spices. What really annoyed me was that even though I used a larger pan I had WAY too many noodles. No way you would ever use a box and a half for ANYTHING.

ADDED more sauce, 2/3 tbs of Italian seasoning, and 2/3tbs of garlic powder. Didn't have too mozzarella on hand, so I added mexican cheese and fresh parmesan in the layers. Came out pretty darn good. Next time, I will add mushroom and spinach :)

I added ricotta and it turned out ok, I would imagine it's delicious if you're used to tofu and not eating meat. I'm not sure I'll make it again.

My husband and I LOVE this dish. It tastes amazing and we love the fact that it doesn't have any meat. I doubled the sauce, added spinach, sautéed mushrooms and asparagus. I've made this dish 3 times and no matter how thin I spread the sauce I still end up with too many noodles. Next time I'm cooking half the amount in the recipe.

Loved this! Didn't change anything. Just think I may add a touch more marinara next time. Kids and husband devoured it! I liked another reviewer's idea to add some veggies in there so it is truly a complete meal. Thanks!

I loved this recipe, it was very tasty!  I didn't change anything, but I used organic cheddar cheese, added some more spices to wake up the flavor.  I will be making it again and I also I used Brown Rice lasagna noodles.  My husband loved it, which was a plus!!!!!!

This was a delicious recipe! I did make a few additions, however ,that I thought made it even tastier. I chopped onion, tomatoe, garlic, & mushrooms and sautéed them; then I poured the sauce over that and brought it to a boil. After letting the sauce cool down a bit I added to the mixture. I also added a cottage cheese layer. It was cheesy goodness!!

Just made this recipe. It was actually the first time I've ever made lasagna! Fabulous!! I changed it a tiny bit, like everyone else. I omitted the milk(just because it seemed kinda out of place, and I wanted to avoid the cheese and sauce mixture from becoming to watery), added a cup of boiled spinach, a couple of seasonings, extra mozarella,and extra sauce for on top, since there wasn't enough for the final layer. Perfect for meatless lasagna with a lot of protein!!

This was surprisingly very good. I expected it to be kinda gross as I'm not normally the biggest tofu fan!  I followed the directions as is but next time I will add at least twice the sauce and try adding some fresh garlic.

This is a great recipe! I made some adjustments as follows starting with the first time I made it based on my personal opinion and some reviews. I sauteed garlic, and mixed that with a couple cups of frozen spinach, the tofu, and some crushed red pepper. I mixed in one egg, some garlic salt and pepper, and 1/2 Cup grated Parmesan.  I then mixed in a little bit of spaghetti sauce and a little mozzarella. I used the rest of the sauce and mozzarella to make separate layers in the lasagna - tofu mixture, sauce, cheese, noodles, etc. The tofu mixture i got from a different recipe for tofu lasagna rolls, which I have been making for a while! It was great this way, and probably great the original way as well!

Delish! I took others suggestions and jazzed it up a bit with additional spices including red chili pepper flakes. More sauce and more cheese are definitely needed.  I did not tell my boys it had tofu in it and they both had second helpings. Leftovers were not great but I will absolutely make this again.

I made this for the family tonight and did not tell them what it was made from.  
They all loved it, from husband to kids not a complaint in the bunch.  
I did what IslandGirl05 suggested and drained the tofu well as well as adding extra sauce.  
I didn't have spinach so I steamed a bag of frozen broccoli and a carrot I had and then processed them in the food processor.  I had a few mushrooms in fridge and added them to the  tofu mixture in the food processor as well.  Only had one cup of mozzarella, so used a cup of cheddar as well.  
Delicious!

I really enjoyed this, however I can't give it five stars as I made too many of my own adjustments so I can't really say how the original recipe would have turned out. I made my own pasta sauce with about 4 garlic cloves and I used 3 cups of sauce. I used just a dash of the nutmeg on the tofu as I was not sure how I felt about it in the recipe. I made up for it by adding rosemary, oregano and basil to the mixture and instead of mozza I used cheddar as that was all I had on hand. I also sautéed some zucchini, onions and green pepper and added them to each layer as I though this recipe could use a few veggies. I would suggest making a tent with tin foil over the pan and bake for 15 - 20 minutes and then remove and bake for a remaining 10 minutes so that the top gets nice and brown. I will definitely make this again and again as it is a wonderful change from the same ol' tofu recipes.

The recommended amount of noodles is confusing in this recipe.  Once I figured that out, it turned out great.  A regular pkg. of lasagna noodles is 16 oz.  I used half, 8 oz., (as recommended on the box) for a 9 x 13 baking dish with three layers of noodles.  I also used a lot more sauce than called for--about 32 oz.  My 17 yr. old daughter loved it and had 3 servings.  I never told her about the tofu.  I will leave out the nutmeg the next time.  It seemed like a strange ingredient for lasagna.  I added a cup of fresh baby spinach to the center layer.

Thought this recipe was amazing!! Not a huge fan of tofu but when it's cooked you wouldn't even notice it. Took some suggestions and added garlic, onions and peppers to the mix. I also added a layer of lean ground beef.
Both my partner and I agreed it was delicious!! Definately will make again

Love sneaking tofu into dishes for the added protein and bulk! This is great. I followed the most helpful review by LJ in terms of spicing it up. Added sauteed onion, zucchini and a chunk of frozen spinach. I also used the no cook lasagna noodles. I'm guessing it'll be better tomorrow after the flavors have marinated overnight... looking forward to it!

I could easily double or triple this recipe and it still would just fill the pan.  I made it for my family and it received rave reviews!  I used 1.5 blocks of tofu, and water instead of milk.  I used cheddar because I didn't have any mozza onhand, as well as I topped it off with salsa because I didn't have enough spaghetti sauce.
