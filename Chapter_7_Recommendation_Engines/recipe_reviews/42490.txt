This turned out really well, great comfort food! I followed the advice of other reviewers and used two cans of soup, doubled the milk & added 3/4c chopped onion. I used Pillsbury Flaky Layers Biscuits instead of making my own, so therefore I turned the oven temp down to 350 degrees and followed the directions for the biscuits after I topped the casserole. I had used boneless, skinless chicken breasts that I simmered in some broth, let cool then cubed. This dish would be great for using leftover chicken or even turkey, it would be really quick to put together. I will definitely make this again, Thanks (:

I recently made this casserole for a small group Bible study Thanksgiving dinner, and it was amazing! Everyone loved it. I did make the following modifications to give it a personal touch: 1.frozen stir-fry vegetables 2.I cooked the chicken on a George Foreman 3.sharp cheddar cheese 4.jar of Real bacon bits (The complaint about the lack of flavor is resolved by simply using Real bacon bits and Sharp Cheddar Cheese.)

This recipe is great and simple.  I used fresh veggies from my garden, but frozen will work well too.  Next time, I might add a little salt.  I didn't have any biscuit mix so I used a can of pre-made biscuits and split them in half to have enough to cover the pan.  Delicious!

This recipe was simple. Not much flavor. I did not add the bacon slices. I added bacon bits(the good kind) to add flavor. I think it would have tasted like bacon too much with what it recommended. You need an extra can of cream of chicken.  It would be too dry without it. The french onions make it. It lacks flavor! No onions, no taste/flavor. I do not think I will make it again.

Instead of making the scratch biscuits, I put Pillsbury Biscuits on top for the last 20 minutes.  The biscuits didn't bake well on top of the mixture, do next time I'll bake the biscuits seperate or try the scratch.  Skipped the bacon & onions.

I didn't have biscuit mix so I used refrigerated ones...I wouldn't recommend doing that! Stick to the recipe! Had great potential but the biscuits really ruined it for us :(

My girlfriend and I made this yesterday, however we tweaked the recipe a little by cooking the chicken in a little blackening seasoning before adding to the mixture.  FANTASTIC!!  Gave a hint of spice and great flavor.  I will be making this again.

This was pretty good for a simple weeknight meal. Instead of mixed vegetables, I used all broccoli, and doubled the soup. I didn't use bacon, or french-fried onions since I didn't have either of them, but I think it would have added the "something" I thought it needed. I made my own biscuits instead of using a mix, and I had to bake them a bit longer to make sure they were done all the way through. Overall, we liked it, and I'll probably make it again.

It was easy to make and tasted great. I added less cheese to the top then it said to be on the healthier side and I didn't have any French-Fried onions around and it still was very tasty

I forgot to put in the chicken!  It was still really good!  I thought it was thin with only one can of soup, but it was light enough not to be overwhelmingly creamy, so I thought it was good.  I also used fresh veggies, 1 head broccoli, 4 carrots cut thin and a can of corn.

I would give this recipe 5 stars because it was so good.  However, I felt so guilty eating this extremely rich and calorie-filled dish, that I'm only giving it 4.  I used only fresh steamed broccoli and not frozen veggies.  The Bisquick biscuits turned out perfect and I did not have the problems that others had saying they were'nt cooked through.  I doubt I will make it again just because of the guilt factor.  Oh, I did double the soup and milk and added chopped onions.

Was ok.  The biscuits didn't rise very high for me.  Also - don't forget the chicken has to be cooked first!
I did use the bacon, but it still lacked flavor.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe. I'm making it tonight - it will be our 4th time in a couple of months. The only changes I make - and this is for our personal tastes, but again we REALLY like it - are: I add some diced onion to the veggie mixture - maybe one small onion. Then instead of putting shredded cheese on top, I use a package of cheddar-garlic biscuit mix (which you combine with water rather than the milk) and drop that by spoonfuls on top. Also, I've never been a big fan of french-fried onions, but DO NOT leave them out of this recipe. They really make the flavor of everything stand out.

This was pretty good, but I make some additions and changes.  I cooked 3 large chicken breasts in olive oil and seasonings in a skillet and chopped the breasts into bite sized pieces.  Because I thought I had more chicken than what the recipe called for, I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken and about 1 cup of milk.  I wanted to be sure that I had enough gravy.  I used more cheese than what the recipe called for also.  I also doubled the biscuits and followed the instructions on the box.  Since I made the dish so big, I should've used more bacon.  (btw, the real bacon bits in the package worked well and made things easier.)  I really like the the french fried onions on top.  My husband said this dish was "tasty" and my brother and his girlfried got seconds.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  The only complaint my husband had was "too many carrots" so I will change up the veggies that I use next time.  I also think it could use a little more seasoning - salt & pepper & some more onions.  I skipped the bacon, but may try it next time to pick up some of the saltiness.  Overall delicious, it's a keeper!

the recipe itself was good but the biscuits were not done on the bottom where they were in the mixture and were pretty much uncooked.  I would recommend baking the biscuits so they brown on the bottom prior to putting them on the casserole.

So easy the way it is AND so easy to modify!  Instead of cubing the chicken, once I cooked it, I just threw it in the food processor.  Had to substitute what I had in the house, so peas and corn instead of mixed veggies and cream of mushroom instead of cream of chicken.  A little extra milk since everyone was saying it needed two cans of soup but I only had one.  No bacon and I made homemade biscuits but I actually had some french-fried onions left over from Thanksgiving!  Only used half the can and that tasted perfect.  I think if I’d used the whole thing, it would have been too onion-y.  Just finished dinner and already looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

This is a great base recipe to customize to your taste.  Definitely use two cans of soup.  I use one cream of chicken and one cream of broccoli, a can of fresh peas instead of frozen veggies, cheddar French fried onions, no bacon, and refrigerated biscuits, everything else as written.  Very simple to mix together and throw in the oven and ready in just half an hour.  I'd highly recommend this as an easy weeknight dinner that you can customize exactly how you like it.

I made this for my boyfriend one night for dinner and he really liked it! I did like some people suggested an added an extra can of cream of chicken soup and it was perfect. The bacon and french onions give it a great taste. I'll definately make this again..

Freakin yum!!!! SO SO SO good!! We totally love this recipe. I gotta say my husband hates veggies and I don't really like them when they are in a liquid, so I just left them out, and it was perfect. I add a ton of garlic and dill(just because it is our favorite spice) and it is so good!! I do use refrigerated Pillsbury Grands rolls, because I don't like biscuits.  I do recommend starting your biscuits off on a pan, we had raw dough on the bottom the first time we made this, but it is very easily solved by baking them first.

My family loved this tonight. I modified it slightly--I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup (low sodium) and increased the milk to one cup. I used crushed potato chips instead of the french-fried onions. I also used refrigerated biscuits. It came out great. This recipe will now be part of our regular menu!

So yummy!  I make it a bit healthier by omitting the bacon, using half-fat soup and skim milk cheese!  This is a really popular recipe in my house and gets made a couple times a month!

This got rave reviews from husband and son.  I have to admit, I made a couple of changes~~I threw in some leftover chicken gravy with the milk/soup mixture.  I added fresh, uncooked mushrooms which cooked up nicely in the oven.  I didn't have much cheddar, so I layered some provolone over the casserole before dropping on the biscuits.  I also had no Bisquick, so I whipped up "E-Z Drop Biscuits" from this site, and this dish was a winner!  A quick and delicious way to use up leftovers.

This recipe is a staple at our house, especially on cold winter nights when the only decent veggies are in the freezer.  I omit the bacon solely for health reasons and we don't miss it a bit.  I also use reduced fat/sodium condensed soups and cut down on the cheese, and even my husband still thinks it's delish.  This is quick, easy, moderately healthy, wonderfully filling and satisfying, and makes great leftovers!

This was an excellent recipe and I cooked it exactly as written.  I didn't care for the leftovers so much because it's *so* much better with the crispy warm biscuits fresh out of the oven.  I think that next time I'll cut the recipe in half which would be just enough for our family of 4.  Thank you!!

Excellent!  I used canned biscuits, too.  I baked the biscuits according to the can (350 for 13 minutes) first.  Then I increased the heat to 400 and baked the chicken mixture for 35 minutes.  I topped the mixture with the biscuits, cheese and onions and baked another 5 to melt the cheese.  
I wish I would have added the bacon, I'll do that next time!

This was really really good.  The only thing that I will change next time I make it is adding another can of cream of chicken.  It just didn't seem that it was creamy/saucy enough to go with the biscuits.  Definetly will make again!!!

I wanted to like this recipe but if following the directions it's pretty bland. I added chopped cooked onion, & some chicken seasoning to give it a little flavor. Sorry but this wasn't the best chicken & biscuit recipe I've had.

I was viewing recipes that used up leftover chicken and stumbled upon this. I'm sure everyone has tried chicken and biscuits before, but this one was super easy and super good. The hubs raved about it so I knew I had to leave a review. I did not change a thing but really think it might have been a little heavy on the biscuits. The bacon, french fried onions and cheese really makes it great. A real keeper.

I didn't use the fried onions for this recipe, but without them this recipe is very bland. If you leave the onions off, then you should add other seasonings to give it flavor.

I didn't have everything for this dish.  I had to use canned veggies (1 can of each peas, corn and potatoes) because I didn't have a frozen mix.  I also used pre-packaged biscuits.  It took longer to cook than stated - my chicken was still raw after 20 minutes.  Next time, I'd like to make it all from scratch, with fresh veggies.  Overall, it was a tasty dish though!

Cream of X soups aren't usually in my repertoire, but I was craving comfort food and had all of the ingredients on hand, so I went for it. YUM! YUM! YUM! So tasty and creamy. I used 2 cans cream of chicken soup and 1 cup milk. Everything else was by the book. It was perfect. Glad I didn't half the recipe which had crossed my mind at one point. Will definitely make it again.

This was a great recipe overall and I didn't deviate at all. However, the biscuit mix caled for unsalted butter to actually make biscuits (I only have salted) and since the recipe didn't ask for it, I didn't add it and the biscuits were hard as rocks and not that flavorful, so next time I'm going to put the butter in the biscuit mix before dropping it into the pan, but we had no leftovers, so this was an overall hit.

I used store bought biscuits and just tore them in half, but they didn't cook in the allotted time.  The recipe was good, but I think next time I'll adjust the cooking times.

I knew my husband would like this because of the biscuits, I was right.  The total dish seemed a bit heavy to me and I think I will try it without the cheese next time and use the Cream of Chicken Soup with Herbs.  I will also saute onions and mushrooms after the bacon.

This was a great dinner: fast, easy & delicious. I cut the quantities in half since it was just for my husband & I. I also took some suggestions from other reviewers; I added a little garlic and onion powder to the biscuit mix as well as a handful of cheddar cheese. I didn't have any bacon, but hubby requested it for next time. :)

It was easy and the guys in the house liked it but, it really lacks flavor....even after I added garlic and basil, salt and pepper.  Took at least 30 minutes for the biscuits to be done.

This is really good if you want somthing fast and easy.  I used a mojo flavored rotiseree chicken and rip it up instead of cooking the chicken if I am really in a hurry and it is so good like that.

I don't have much time in the evenings and this recipe was a great answer for wanting something that wasn't fast food but still fast and simple. This recipe was just the warm, hearty food we needed for a rainy day. It was very easy to put together and bake time was nothing. I made the prep time even shorter by just plopping some Pillsbury Grands on top of the mixture and baked until golden brown. Yum!

This was delicious!  Everyone loved it, but some of us would have preferred a little less of the mixed vegetables. I might put in only 1/2 or 3/4's of the bag next time.  My picky kids even liked it. WOW!  I know I'll make it again.

Was looking for a quick and easy dinner for tonight...and this was it.  The only minor changes I made was that I added some garlic and onion powder and just a sprinkle of real bacon pieces.  My 5 year old didn't enjoy the mixed vegetables, but she had to eat them anyway.

I loved this recipe! I didn't use bacon (not a fan of bacon unless it is crispy)but still thought it tasted good with my variations.  I used cream of chicken and herb soup.  I also used sharp cheddar and added a little garlic powder to the biscuit mix. It also will need salt and pepper. I will definitely make this again!

I made this recipe with the condensed Chicken and Herb soup for flavor, included the bacon, and used frozen biscuits instead of a mix.  It turned out fantastic.   I will definitely make this again.

I've made this a couple of times now; made it with chicken from my freezer last time, I baked and cubed it the night before to save time!

Delicious, definitely add the bacon : )

This recipe is super simple and very tasty!  The bacon makes it so flavorful!  I don't change a thing and it's very filling!  I would recommend this to anybody!

I made this dish but my family did not like it, not much flavor. could not taste the bacon it seemed to get lost.
frozen veg were not good tasteing,maybe if you used fresh veg's it would be better.

It was decent, nothing extremely special. I made several changes though, like adding garlic since people said the flavor was bland, used fresh aspargus (if you do that boil it first- I didnt and it was kinda crunchy) instead of frozen mixed vegetables, and I doubled up the soup (which i would recommend because it looked really dry before I added a second can) so I cant entirely judge it.

This was pretty good.  I used a california veggie mix: cauliflowers, broccoli, and carrots.  I made my own biscuit dough and dropped it on top.  A whole watch was too much - would recommend only using 1/2 a batch, if you are making your own.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was enjoyed by everyone in the family.

I found this recipe years ago on a can of Durkee Fried Onions.  It's been a family favorite for years and I've been passing it along.  Glad to see it on allrecipes.  It's a definite keeper!

Great recipe!  Made it without the fried onions. Very tasy. My family loved it.
