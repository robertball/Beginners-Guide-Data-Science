This was really good!  I had read others suggestions and heres what I did.  I used more cheddar cheese on both the bottom and the top, I used a large can of spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato sauce and I put a layer of sliced olives on top of the cream cheese/sour cream mixture.  The result was so yummy!  I do admit though that leftovers are even BETTER so I think next time I will cook it the day before I want to serve it, then put it in the fridge and reheat it the following day. Pure comfort food that you and your family will love.

The hubby & I thought this was great.  I had some fresh pasta to use up so I decided to make this.  I sprinkled more cheese on top than what it called for and used half a tablespoon of sugar. I also used Chive & Onion cream cheese.  Yummy!

Wow, I was a little skeptical, but this worked out so well. Super easy to make. I put a little oregano on top of the tomato sauce and meat mixture for just a little extra flavor. For those who had trouble with spreading the cream cheese mixture over the noodles, I put dollops all over,and the heat from the pasta softened the dollops making it easy to spread out. Very good recipe, will definately make again!

I made this recipe for a crew of men helping to build a house.They loved it.I've also made it for a new mom and she loved it. It's really good.However,I used more cheese than it called for and used dried pasta instead of fresh. I will definately make this again.

Excellent recipe! I lightened it up by using 93% lean beef, fat free sour cream, fat free cream cheese, fat free cheddar cheese, and Splenda instead of sugar. I felt that it needed a bit more flavor, so I added a bit of basil, oregano, and garlic to the beef as I cooked it. The only fresh pasta that I could find was fettucini, and that worked great. THis is a definite make a again recipe. Thanks for sharing, Jo!

This was pretty good but I felt it needed a little tweaking, which is why I gave it only three stars.  The whole thing was a bit dry and think it's because there wasn't enough of the cheese/sour cream mixture for the noodles.  Next time I will double the cheese part of the recipe or not use a full pound of noodles.

I'd actually give this a 4.5 star rating.  I used a single pound of ground beef and added additional cheese.  I used wide egg noodles (not fresh) and regular onions instead of green onions.  I also added Italian seasoning and Creole Seasoning to the meat.  It was very good!

Turned out GREAT!  I used a hamburger/sausage mix, added some Italian seasoning and garlic powder to meat sauce, and used Fiori pasta.  Made it the night before and it was an excellent dinner.

My family loved it.  I did used spaghetti sauce which made it taste a lot like lasagna.  Will try it again and make it exactly like the recipe.  This one is a keeper!

I changed recipe a little, only cream cheese I had was a spinach/artichoke one so I used that along with some added chopped spinach to add some veggies for the kids.  Turned out great and kids(2 and 4) loved it!  I used dried spiral pasta, think might try with Italian sausage next time for little different flavor.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This most definitely made my favorites folder!!  I altered it a little.  I used an Italian blend of cheese in place of the cheddar and a can of chunky spaghetti sauce for more flavor.  Awesome result!  Tastes like lasagna but soooo much easier and quicker to assemble.  I've already passed this recipe on to my sister and I am now a big hit with my brother-in-law :)

YUM! Comfort food at its finest. Not as good as a lasagne, but I this can be put together in a flash. I used a bit more sauce and cheese as reviewers recommended, and I am glad I did. Otherwise, everything else stayed the same. Yummy, easy entree that kids will definitely adore! I didn't let it sit in the fridge overnight... I don't see the need to. BTW, I used wide egg noodles.

My toddler and I thought this recipe was great, although her dad was not overly impressed (doesn't care for cream cheese).  He did eat it twice and said it was much better the second day.  I added some spinach to the cream cheese layer to round it out and may add some zuchini next time.

I didn't have any green onion, so chopped up regular onion, along with chopped green pepper and garlic, and cooked those 3 things in with the ground beef. I also didn't have any fresh pasta, so used 8 oz. of dried egg noodles, just cooked them al dente before adding. Added more cheese than called for. If you don't like cream cheese, you are NOT going to like this(My husband hated it) but I thought it was quite good, although a little dry. I think it would go over well with most people though.

Made this 3 times; once according to recipe, twice with my own adaptations.Was good every time but better with my additions. I found fusili pasta worked the best. On top of the cream cheese/sour cream layer I sprinkled a small can of sliced black olives and a small can of kernel corn (both drained). I also used more cheddar in the recipe and on top. It was more colourful and filling with the additions but my guests loved it both ways. Excellent recipe, however, prep and clean-up are time consuming. Good job it isn't served until next day. Gives you a chance to recover.

This was NOT good.  After reading all the wonderful reviews, I was extremely disappointed.   I even tried it the next day hoping it would be better as some people sugggested, but it was still bad.

Excellent recipe. I took another person's advice and added olives and corn and that really made it special. Mine came out slightly dry, so I might try an extra small can of tomato sauce. Will make this again.

Very easy and very quick.  Not quite as good as full-blown lasagna but much quicker.  I also did not use fresh pasta and it turned out fine.  I added some minced garlic and marinara seasoning to the meat.

I have been using a similar recipe for years, and we just love it!  I mix the cream cheese and the onions in with the hot pasta. The cream cheese melts and is more evenly distributed through the pasta.

I loved it!! One of my new favorite recipes. I changed the ingredient of tomato sauce to canned tomato soup. It was AMAZING.
