Here is what I did (my mom makes a dish similar to this)and it came perfect, first of all double the potatoes (to 10) milk (to 1 cup) and butter (to 12 TBS) when the potatoes are mashed mix into it the cheese and bacon mixture. Then layer potato, noodle, potato, noodle, potato, noodle.  Top with 1 onion sauteed in 1/2 cup butter and cover with aluminum foil. Then bake covered. The noodles will not get hard and the dish will disappear before your eyes!! ;-) Thanks for the recipe!

I changed the method for this recipe quite a bit, so I hesitate to review it. I can't resist though because it was so good! Here's how I made it. First I doubled the recipe, but still used a 9x13 pan to make a thick casserole. I mixed the cheese in with the hot mashed potatoes to make a filling more like what I am used to in a pirogi. For the assembly, I layered 1/4 of the mashed potatoes, then a little bit of the onion mixture, and then noodles. Repeated four times, ending with onion mixture on top. Because I was making this for a number of meals, I lined the 9x13 pan with foil first, and after assembly, chilled it in the fridge. When chilled ans solid, I turned the whole casserole out of the pan, removed the foil, cut the casserole in quarters, wrapped each quarter for the freezer and froze them to bake later. Worked great! The only change I would make is to make twice the amount of onions this recipe calls for and perhaps omit or cut back on the bacon. Served with sauteed shredded cabbage and fruit salad.

Very good! I made this as a side dish for my Super Bowl party (GO STEELERS). I didn't follow the exact directions of the recipe. I folded the bacon, onion and garlic combination into the mashed potatoes. I then layered it with the cheddar cheese. I also added a layer of noodles to the bottom of the pan, because it didn't say to. I covered the pan with foil and baked it for 30 minutes so the noodles would not get hard. I then took the foil off the dish and baked it uncovered for an additional 15 minutes.

My family loved this.  I usually spend hours in the kitchen making pierogis with my mom and this was a perfect substitute.  It became my kids favorite in minutes and they wanted more.  I blend the bacon, a few tsp of grease and cheese in with the potatoes instead of butter, salt & pepper, then layer with more cheese.  Not so healthy w/grease, but so tasty!  Like the real thing.  So excited to have found it. Thanks!

This is a great recipe. I cheated and used instant potatoes and substituted shredded marble for the cheddar so the taste wouldn't be quite as sharp. I baked it for 20 minutes covered with aluminum foil (so the noodles wouldn't dry out) then removed the foil and baked for another 20 minutes. My family loved it and it even tasted great heated up in the microwave the next day! I definately am going to make this one again!

We loved this recipe.  It was easy to make and had all the flavor of the labor intesne pierogi.  We also added a layer of sauerkraut.

I have to admit, I was a little weary of trying this recipe...but it really turned out really good.  I added mushrooms and topped it with sour cream. Hubby says he would like to have it again...

Nice dish and loved by my family. After reading the other reviews I decided to make a cheese sauce for the top of the casserole to eliminate the problem of the noodles drying out. I simply made a roux, added milk, stirred until thickened and added shredded cheddar cheese. (the same recipe you would use for baked mac and cheese)

I made this pretty much as written except to cook a whole pound of bacon and put half of it right on in the mashed potatoes.  Also, I didn't brown the bacon in butter because, after all, it is bacon and it makes plenty of it's own grease.  I cooked the onions and garlic in the bacon grease after removing the bacon from the pan.  Other wise, I followed the recipe.  I liked it a lot, but my husband thought it was just okay.  We have tons of leftovers, so I guess I'll be eating this for breakfast for awhile.

I made this as it was stated and found it good, hearty and filling, but slightly heavy ( with the noodles ). and i missed the sour kraut, ( again another thing taught by Grandma ) , since we use a sweet / sour kraut recipe in our family for stuffing perogies. But i will try it again, ( sorry, but personal perfereance will mean adding my own touches ). all in all... good idea, great alternitive to hours of work, and this means i may have perogies more often!

Just ok.  I probably will not make again; not enough taste to justify the high calorie to low nutrient ratio.  I made according to directions, except I added a layer of whole wheat noodles as the bottom layer to prevent sticking.   I also used "real bacon pieces" instead of frying bacon (I added them to the onion garlic saute) and folded 1/2 of that mixture into the potatoes and used the other 1/2 on top (under the second 1/2 of the cheese).  Maybe it will be better left over for lunch tomorrow.  My husband liked it, so I'd probably actualy rate it about a 31/2.  Thanks for something different!

this dish is absolutely to die for. it tastes exactly like a pierogi, and i think i could eat it on a daily basis. having said that, i'd prefer not to have a heart attack before the age of 30, so i make a few changes to lighten the load a little - i always omit the bacon, i prefer it without. and i make it with 2% milk cheese, skim milk, fat free sour cream, and i can't believe it's not butter. it's not quite as rich this way, but still tastes delicious and comes without the guilt trip of the original recipe!!

This was de-lish!  I did add sauer kraut, which I won't do again, because it took away from the potato flavor.  I also used the Barilla no-cook noodles as suggested by another review, next time I'll use regular as the recipe called for, the no-ccok noodles were too thin for us.  Just shows you should stick to the recipe for the first time, and then tweak if you want to.  Thanks for the recipe, can't wait to make it exactly as you submitted it!!!  ;)

This is not a lot of trouble to make as one reader stated if you are using up leftovers......whenever I make lasagna I boil the entire box, and freeze the remaining noodles....then when I have leftover cream cheese-garlic mashed potatoes I make pierogi casserole......my family likes it this way:
 Dice an onion & cook in butter until softened. Pour a little on bottom of your casserole pan, then layer noodles, potatoes,  butter-onion & sliced Velveeta...we like Velveeta better than cheddar....keep making layers & bake in oven or it microwaves nicely.........this is a good dish when you are needing comfort food.....

My friends won't stop asking for this dish! I made it with vegetarian bacon and I was afraid that my meateater buddies wouldn't like it- but they loved it! I've even been able to use it as leverage for favors (teehee). Worthwhile and delicious.

My husband loves pierogis. I doubled the potatoes and did follow many reviewers suggestion to mix the bacon, onion and cheese in with the potatoes. Made it a lot easier to assemble. I did save some onion and cheese for the top. Because this takes some time to make and it is very rich, I made portions for the freezer. I lined a casserole with foil, cooled the casserole, pulled out the casserole and cut into portions. I put the portion I want in a loaf pan to cook. Nice to have a quick potato dish for a side. Thank you!

I would give this 10 stars if I could.  Absolutely perfect for a crowd.  This tasted exactly like a really good pierogi, and I'm going to be making it for a Halloween party next week, since it makes a ton.  Thank you! (I did double the bacon and added a bit more cheese.)

I made a big pan of this more than a week ago and I'm still thinking about it, if that's any indication of how much we liked it!  I  left out the bacon and made 10 servings of instant mashed potatoes (according to the package directions) in the pan with the sauteed onions and garlic.  If you choose to go the instant potato route (which tasted great with the onions mixed in), 10 servings is spot on!  I also stirred a 16 ounce container cottage cheese into the potatoes and onions.  I layered the lasagna noodles, potatoes, sauerkraut (used the normal sized can), noodles, potatoes, sauerkraut, noodles, potatoes and cheddar cheese and parsley on top.  My lasagna loving boyfriend and I both adored the casserole and feel the sauerkraut made it really special!  Cannot wait to make it again, thanks for the idea :oD

This recipe would be a dream come true if not for one thing. I did try it as is just to be sure but my Polish guilt forced me to make a second batch at the same time using real pierogi dough. I know it's much more filling, but it's worth it to whip the dough up yourself. I think mine is somewhere in the ballpark of 3 medium pastered eggs, a cup of sour cream, + or - 3 cups of flour, TBSP of baking powder, and a few pinches of salt. Make a well and generally proceed as though you were making lasagna. I can definitely see myself using this time saver instead of pinching dumplings all day.
Thanks for the thought. How did this never occur to me?

I took a short cut and used mini farfalle instead of lasagna noodles.  Used sour cream instead of milk to mash the potatoes, and seasoned them generously with salt, freshly ground pepper, and snipped chives.  I omitted the bacon and used a mixture of cheddar and mozzarella cheeses.  I've never tasted Pierogis before, but if they are as good as this casserole, they must be deelicious!

I know the reviews are good, and it probably is, but where are the pierogi?  I was brought up on Polish homemade periogi and have made them myself, but the dough for perogi is in no way as thick as Lasagne noodles.  Think that the title of this casserole needs changing.  Sorry

I make my own piroghy but thought I'd try this as a 'quick' alternative.  Not even close.  This is very doughy compared to my own egg yolk only dough which melts in the mouth.

I also made a few changes based on other reviews.  I used ALOT less bacon and onion than called for.  I didn't want a huge bacon or oniony taste--I used about 1/4 c bacon, and about 1/4 of a medium SWEET onion.  I also mixed the bacon/onion with the potaotes and cheese.  I used Barilla NO BOIL lasagna noodles and I baked it COVERED so the noodles would not dry out.  IT WAS EXCELLENT!   I made this a for a party and just about everyone asked for the recipe.  We are Polish and this is the next best thing to real pierogis--and alot less work!

To make this taste more like perogies add the cheddar to the mashed potatoes.  When layering add a layer of cottage cheese with a beaten egg added to it..also pour a little melted butter over the top layer of noodles to keep from getting hard.  I leave the bacon out, and serve bacon bits on the side. With these mods it becomes a five star.

FABULOUS! Or at least the idea was! I'm a pretty lazy cook, so I used leftover mashed potatoes (day old).  First sauteed a whole onion in one stick of real butter, then dumped it in with mashed potatoes, two large spoonfuls of sour cream, three heaping handfuls of grated cheese (I used cheddar), and a couple of dashes of seasoned salt.  Then did the noodle/potato mix/noodle layering.  Did not use bacon or garlic this time around and may never do so.  Oh my goodness, this is divine.  Five stars just for giving me the inspiration!  Foolproof for nearly every cook!

great recipe.
I changed it up a bit though.
For the potatoes.
I boiled 3 potatoes, 1 cup yam cut up,
1 cup cauliflower, 2 small carrots,
1 sweet potato and 1 cup butternut squash.
boil off the mixture and mash like you would just plain potatoes add butter and sour cream salt and pepper.
I have been making my potatoes like this for years just so the kids get extra veggies.
Set potatoes aside.
I browned some garlic and shallots
I also browned some turkey bacon 
and some pork sausages.
set all aside
Layering
first layer 
noodles sauerkraut onion garlic mixture
cheddar cheese sour cream
2nd layer
noodles, potatoe mixture cheddar cheese
sour cream
3rd layer 
noodles potatoe cheddar cheese sour cream
last layer the top
noodles
sausage bacon mixture onion garlic mixture
cheddar cheese and sour cream
i covered the dish with tin foil
baked 1 hr on 300 
It was delicious
my kids really did not like the sauerkraut but they still ate it.
thanks for the recipe.

I took advice from other reviewers and added cooked cabbage as a layer to the casserole. This recipe tastes just like pierogis to me. It was easy to fix because I used garlic instant mashed. I added cheddar cheese to the mashed also. Wonderful, different recipe. A definite keeper!!

I think the amount of butter in the recipe is incorrect. It calls for 1/2 TABLESPOON butter, melted; however, the instructions call for 6 Tablespoons of butter to be mashed with the potatoes and 2 Tablespoons for cooking the bacon and onion. That would add up to 8 Tbsp, or 1/2 cup.  Additionally, I didn't think there were enough potatoes, so I question whether it should say 5 potatoes or 5 pounds of potatoes.  Does anyone know?

Super delicious! My husband and toddler son loved it too. Next time, I'll add a couple more potatoes and an extra onion. I also would recommend doing at least two layers of the onion/bacon/garlic mixture instead of just the one toward the top. We loved it throughout.

I took another reviewers advice ... I just used perogies.  Fried them a bit in garlic butter and onions, just to make them a tiny bit crispy.  Half cooked my bacon. Laced the bottom of my 9x9 with bacon, then perogies & onions, cheese, more bacon and more cheese.  Sprinkle with pepper. Remove from oven at 350 for 15 mins and top with sour cream. AMAZING!!!

Wonderful! I layered it a little differently - I mixed 1 cup shredded cheddar with the cooked onion and bacon and the 8 oz sour cream. I then used this creamy mixture as a middle layer instead of just cheese. I made sure the top layer was mashed potatoes, then topped with the additional 1 cup cheddar. (This prevents the tough top noodle layer.) Will definitely make again!

This was wonderful! I have never had a pierogi, so I wasn´t sure what this should taste like, and the combination of ingredients sounded a little strange, but it was a big hit and I will be making it again! My husband liked it cold the next day. Yummy!!

Loved this recipe. I did combine the bacon, onion, and garlic into the mashed potatoes. Layered it lasagna, potato, cheese, lasagna, potato, cheese, lasagna, cheese. Cooked uncovered for 30 minutes and it turned out great! I actually doubled everything for the potatoes and kept 1/2 the potato mixture to freeze for some great mashed potatoes later.

Not good. Too much potato made it super heavy, and the bacon and cheese on top was just too much. I made the mistake of using no-bake lasagna noodles (my bad!), so the pasta was tough.  Even in spite of that, the whole thing just wasn't good.   Nothing like a pierogi. Sorry!

I gave this only a four star as I have mixed emotions.  1.  The taste is very good. 2. the texture of lasagna noodles and mashed potatoes is weird together.  I understand that is just a personal quirk, but it was strange to me.

Very disappointing; especially since we love pierogi. The top layer of noodles was so hard and dried that it was hard to cut through and chew. The flavor was pretty good, otherwise. Not sure if I'll make this again. :(

I don't believe in reviewing recipes if you make major changes, so I followed this recipe exactly. I found it bland, thin, and frankly, odd tasting. Only one person ate a full serving. Maybe doubling the potatoes and adding spices? I don't know, but I won't try again.

Pretty good casserole. I made a few adjustments as per other reviewers and made my own alterations. First, I combined the cheese, salt, and pepper with the potatoes. In the future, I will put the onions, bacon, and the garlic in with the potatoes as well. I layered the potato mixture and noodles until I was close to the top at which time I added one layer of bacon (I left them in slices) and then potatoes on top. To top it off, I put another layer of noodles and shredded cheese. After that, I sprinkled chives (can't remember if they were regular chives or garlic chives) on the top and baked it. Next time, I think I will add sour cream to the potato mix and perhaps mushroom soup or mushrooms (as suggested by another reviewer). Overall, I think this recipe is worth keeping in my collection!

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly.  I couldn't imagine using more than 5 large potatoes....it filled the dish.  I did add some bacon and onions to the middle layer.  I baked covered for 30 mins and uncovered for 15 mins.  The noodles were not hard.  We added some hot sauce to taste.

super cool idea, I loved it! I just added more potatoes and more cheese on top , for sure cover with tin foil. Also when I mash potatoes I dont use all butter , I use some milk, and sour cream in replacement for half the butter, saurkraut in the mixture is awsome as well!

This was very tasty. I carmelized the onions in the bacon drippings, and mixed them and the cheese and bacon into the mashed potatoes as others suggested. I used frozen Ore Ida potato mashers, and it saved the time of peeling and cleaning and boiling the potatoes. Great recipe that I'll be making again.

This is a great weekday meal.  Due to family members preferences, I made one 8x8 pan of potato pierogi and one of sweet potato.  I liked both, but I think I liked it with sweet potatoes better.  I know it isn't authentic, but traditional Polish cooking is most about thrift and versatility.  This will be a fun casserole to play around with more.

This is pretty good. It definitely tastes very fatty. I think you could cut down on the amount of butter. Even though we added salt and pepper, it tasted very greasy and bland. I think with some more seasoning and less butter it would be awesome.

Delectable and delightful!
I added frozen (drained first) spinach, bacon, mushroom and onions to the potato part. This way I could sneak some veggies into the meal. It also made this the main dish and we had salad, fruit and a light dessert. I recommend trying it!

This recipe was a huge hit!I sauteed the onions and garlic together and mixed with the mashed potatoes(doubled the potatoes as well).I left the bacon out as I was serving ham for dinner.I placed a layer of noodles on the bottom then layered with mashed potatoes and cheese.Baked covered 30 mins and uncovered for 10.What little was left over was even better the next day.

This is one of my family's favorite recipes now!  The only thing I do differently is adding a layer of bacon bits & onions after each potato layer, instead of one layer at the top.  Delicous!

Very good! This is nice twist to the normal dinner table with a lot of the basic ingredients that most everyone enjoys. The only change we made is substituted ranch dressing in place of sour cream since hubby won't eat sour cream. We also used about three times the amount of cheese that it called for and used mozzarella in place of cheddar. I might switch it up the next time I make it.

I enjoyed this dish and so did my picky husband. I did used 4 slices of bacon, 1 tablespoon of butter for the potatoes along with chicken stock instead of milk. I did cook the onion in the bacon, which was VERY yummy. I forgot to put noodles on the bottom, this recipe left it out.It seemed fine, just hard to get the potato out of the pan.

This was delicious!!!  If you like pierogis then you have to try this recipe.  I would add a few more potatoes and I would cover it with foil next time because the top noodles did get hard.  I also added a full pound of bacon and just realized it only called for 1/2 and I would go ahead and do the same again next time, too.  My husband, who prefers to have big chuncks of meat in everything he eats, even loved it as well as my VERY picky 9 year old.

Nice comforting dinner. Though it's strange for me to say this, I think it needs a little more cheese and possibly more bacon as well...I made a half recipe in my 8 inch square pan, using whole wheat lasagna noodles. Next time I will 'salt and pepper to taste' the potato layers, not the top. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was amazing!!!  Definitely a lot more work than just using frozen pierogies but it was worth it in the end.  A few recommendations:  (1) cook the bacon separate from the onions or it will never cook through properly; (2) add salt and pepper to the mashed potatoes; (3) leave out the garlic.  This was delish with sour cream and chopped green onions on top!

Even my husband who doesn't like pierogis loved this casserole!  Skipped the bacon and cut down the butter.  Mixed in the onion and sour cream with the mashed potatoes.  Reserved some of the potato mixture to put on top of the noodles as some suggested so it wouldn't harden.  Yum!

Excellent! Since my husband had to remove gluten from his diet, I've been on a mission to adjust his favorite foods to something he can eat. Pierogis were one food I could not make over ... until now! I just switched the lasagna noodles to the gluten free variety and he loved it! Thanks for the recipe!

made this for dinner tonight and it was pretty good. my picky 4 year old even liked it. i think the bacon needs to be cooked separately from the onion and garlic, or cook bacon for a few minutes first, then add onion and garlic. the onion and garlic  burned a little waiting for the bacon to cook through. i did mix the bacon/onion/garlic mixture in with the potatoes as previously suggested. overall it was good and id most likely make it again. oh and ive never even had a pierogi before!

Yum! I tweaked this recipe a bit, like another reviewer I prefer a thicker piece, so I made more mashed potatoes. I also stirred the onions and garlic into the mashed potatoes. I alternated potato, bacon, noodle and cheese in that order, X3, and also covered the dish with foil. I would also recommend baking for at least 45 minutes, 30 is not enough to warm the centre and melt the cheese topping.

I made this and it was a huge success at our Polish luncheon in honor of the Beatification of Pope John Paul II.  I did add an extra cup of the shredded cheese only because I had extra.  I made  2 recipes and it served 25 people.  If it had been the only entree, it would have served less.  I didn't know what to expect but it truly was very delicious and VERY rich.   I will make it again.

used fake bacon, it was delicious. how can it not be? cheese, potatoes, butter.... i also used oven ready lasagna noodles.. i think i'll go for the real thing next time because the top lyer of noodles (esp around the edges) was rock hard. i kept it covered with foil in the oven up until the last 10 mins, but yeah.. still hard. it was annoying to cut.

Delicious - very close to tasting like a real pierogi. I was skeptical but am sold and will be making it again. I made with 7 potatoes and mixed the bacon/onion/garlic into them - like a pierogi would be. I only made 2 layers of potato and lasagna noodles (6 noodles) in a 9X13 pan. Really could be made in a smaller pan if you wanted more layers.

this is really similar to a recipe that is a family tradition on christmas in my family. My grandma has made it for as long as I can remember.  I have never had bacon in it, but it would probably be good.  Instead of chives, my grandma caramelizes onions and uses them to soften the noodles and mix in the potatoes.

What a great new casserole. I cheated and used boxed mashed potatoes and it was still delish! I just followed the rest of the recipe and it came out great.

my kids loved this (and they are picky eaters!).  Have made this several times and it is always a hit, it is also a great way to use left over mashed potatoes!

This was quite delicious.  I did make the recipe according to the directions, as I always do making a recipe for the firs time. Next time I am going to layer the onion, garlic and bacon throughout instead of doing it as the top layer.   I think this will bring out the flavors more.  You do have to make sure that you season your potatoes well or it will be a bit bland, in my opinion.  Overall it is a definite 5 star recipe for taste and ease; a definite keeper.

I made this casserole as I had potatoes and a few other ingredients that I wanted to use up.    I thought it was really good, although I used "oven ready" lasagne noodles and they weren't soft enough.

This was delicious.  I layered the bacon and onion mixture as another reader suggested. I also put chives and sourcream in the mashed potatoe mixture, which gave it a bit more flavor. Served with a side salad, we were good to go!

I made this recipe twice this weekend and got rave reviews - once for home and once for a potluck.  Since I didn't have any lasagna noodles, I made my own using the Basic Pasta Recipe found on this site.  My only suggestion is to cook up lots of potatoes - maybe about 5 lbs worth since the original amount suggested barely covers the bottom of the pan.

This was easy to make and pretty good.  I used turkey bacon, but next time I'm going for the real stuff cause it's crispy.

I've had this recipe in my recipe box for over a year and jus now tried it...SHAME ON ME! This was sooooo good! I cheated and used instant mashed potatoes (2 bags, total 8 servings) and precooked bacon. I also threw sauerkraut on only 1/2 in case we didn't like it....HA! I had to put some on the other half. My husband had....wait for it.....6 helpings! Although we loved it as is, he would like for me to try throw some kielbasa in next time, or taking out the bacon and sauerkraut and putting a beef mix in stating it would be a twist on shephards pie. LOVED IT, THOUGHT ABOUT THE LEFTOVERS ALL DAY AT WORK, CAN'T WAIT TO MAKE IT AGAIN!!!!!

This recipie was great and easily substituted to each persons tastes.  I didn't add bacon because my bf despizes it.  And I agree with not needing all the butter, I used instant potatoes and there is really no need to add so much butter.  This recipie is a definate keeper!

This was so tasty!  I will cut back the butter next time (maybe even omit it all!) because you get enough moisture from the bacon and cheese.  I will also add more potatoes next time.

I cheated and used instant mashed potatoes, and i left out the bacon. And it was still delicous. I was telling my boyfriend that this recipe got good reviews and other people said that they were going to put it in their weekly rotation. Then i said that we didnt have a weekly rotation, but he said that we did, Pizza, macaroni and cheese, toast and cereal. So he said that it was a nice change. Will be making it again.

very good and hearty meal. I did double the potatoes and adjusted the butter.  I also made a cheese sauce (like what is used in homade mac and cheese)to place in between the layers and also on the top, it was wonderful.

Yum, yum, yum!  This was so delicious.  It is a bit time consuming, but worth it in the end.  I liked it even better the second day when the flavors seemed to blend more.  I will be making this again!  Thanks for a great comfort food meal!

I thought this recipe was good, but nothing to get excited over.  I might make it again, but my husband will probably never ask for it.  Doesn't make my top ten list, but not bad.

This was fabulous, although I made a few adjustments.  I put a head of roasted garlic and sour cream into the mashed potatoes.  I sprinkled blue cheese on top of the potatoes.  Then, I told it all with mushrooms and onions that I sauteed in butter and olive oil, and then simmered in white wine.  It was terrific, and my whole family loved it.  I can't wait to try other ingredients in this great dish.

This was pretty good but it took a lot of time to prepare and messed up too many dishes, so I don't know if I will make it again.  I agree with other reviews that the top layer of noodles get dried out - will leave that layer off if I ever make this again.

I was REALLY pressed for time, but wanted comfort food for dinner, so my shortcut was to use Betty Crocker Instant Potatoes rather that fresh and the second change that I made was to put the sauted onions and bacon and garlic right into the prepared potatoes.  This casserole was delicious even with my shortcuts !!!

i used this more as a starting point for what to make bf for lunch this week.. i used instant mashed potatoes and made them kind of runny and stirred some bacon ranch dressing into it.. i used chopped up pork chops in place of the bacon.. totally forgot the garlic and used sliced provolone for the cheese.. i also added a couple of layers of mixed frozen veggies to make it a bit healthier.. bf absolutely loved it.. ty for the inspiration

This dish was amazing!  Very easy to make and it actually tasted like pierogies.  

I wanted to make this again after the pan was gone.  One of the most amazing dishes I have ever tasted.

It was just "ok". Made it 2 ways.. Followed the recipe exact and also made a pan taking other suggestions and mixing all the ingredients into the potato mix. Mixing everything in the potato's made a much taster blend. However, my main issue with this recipe is the lasagna noodles. They really are just the wrong texture for this, too thick and bland. I'll make the potato mixture again (mashed potato's, bacon, onion, garlic, cheese, salt/pepper) but skip the noodles and it's a good side dish.

This recipe is a bit time consuming but we really enjoyed it. Even as a leftover it was pretty good. I didn't do it but know for next time, the whole top must be covered in cheese or the noodle gets rubbery. I think it was decided next time to add the bacon, onion mix and than cheese and skip the top noodle. I will be making this again and just working on execution. The sour cream on the top is what my hunny said brought the whole dish together for him.

This was very good, but very labor intensive.  I am not sure if I would make it again just because of how long it took, but I was glad I tried it.

Wonderful casserole, i did do a little twist on it. My husband made homemade lasagna noodles and we cooked them for about 3min. I sauted the onions and sauerkraut in the bacon fat after I cooked the bacon. I mixed the bacon and onions and cheese in the mashed potatoes. I put sliced kielbasa on the top and covered the casserole with foil for the first 30 min. It will be a keeper.

This is fabulous but I did change some stuff.  First, I use a container of Country Crock already made mashed potatoes.  They're real mashed and they make this recipe SO much easier and you'd never know the difference.  Also, once I made it and the store had NO lazagna noodles!  I got rotini noodles and that's how I always make it now.  The cheese and potato always stick in to the noodles.  Yum.  One more change!  I mix the garlic/onion/bacon mixture IN to the mashed potatoes before spreading.  My kids wouldn't eat it if all that was waiting for them in one big layer but mix it in and they don't know it's there, all they know is it makes it taste great!  They ask me to make this all the time.

I made this for an after church Fathers Day Lunch. My finicky eater father-in-law ate it and loved it. So so happy to have this recipe since it is so much easier than the alternative. It was a much easier way to turn my southern friends n family onto the Polish cuisine.

This is so much easier to make then pierogies, but it still takes some work.  I use a whole 1lb of peppered bacon because my husband loves bacon.  I also make a lighter version of this with 1% milk, reduced fat cheese and light sour cream, and there isn't much different from the original version.

this recipe is all noodle!  totally disproportionate in my opinion.  

BUT it was DELISH when i used 8 potatoes and extra cheese, and still cut it to only 6 noodles (two layers -- I spread the onion mixture just under the top noodles).  covered it when baking and wasn't dry at all.  good even without the bacon and lots of fresh chives on top. used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Mmmm.

As is I'd probably give it 3 stars but that's only because I'm used to my FIL's. Next time I make it, I'll be adding a lot more onion, maybe some sour cream to the potatoes and have extra butter to drizzle on after it's cooked to mimic the frying in butter we do to our peirogies - for me that'll take it up to 4/5 stars (along with my waistline!)

I made this for a family dinner as a side dish and everyone loved it!- Well, at least all of the adults.  The kids would prefer regular pierogies.  Next time I will definitely put a layer of noodles on the bottom and then continue from there.  Very good!

Very good!  Lots of steps; I might try no-bake noodles next time to get rid of that process.  Otherwise, very much like storebought pierogi and MUCH easier than homemade pierogi.

Soooo yummy. Only thing I changed was the layering, mixed cheese, bacon and onion into the potatoes (so hard to stop myself from eating it all on the spot while making it!). made it for a xmas party and everyone was asking for the recipe. will make again for sure!

I subbed for turkey bacon, I think it would be much better with normal bacon, but the meal was still delish. Since it's just the 2 of us, I made it in 2, 9 inch rounds and froze one for later.

I'm not sure about how healthy this is, but it tasted good. After reading some of the reviews, the changes I made were (1) adding some shredded cheese to the mashed potato, and (2) adding a cheesy white pasta sauce on to the top layer of lasagne noodles before covering in cheese (to soften it).

I was very pleased with this dish. Not only was it delicious, but there is so much room to add or exchange ingredients (i.e. eggs, ground beef, green beans).  The only thing is I used the oven ready lasagna noodles that don't need boiling, and the last layer was still hard. The in between layers were fine though.  I would recommend boiling the noodles first as you would a normal lasagna dish. I enjoyed this meal and will definately make again.

Delicious with one qualification!  While reading the recipe, what really stuck out to me was the garlic.  In my experience garlic is not something normally in a pierogi, but I tried it anyway.  I kinda wish I hadn't added it.  I love garlic, but feel it really doesn't belong in this recipe, or at least it should be very minimal.  Otherwise... very delicious and easy and I will be taking this to a holiday potluck.

With all the work that goes into this you could just have pierogis. They taste better in my opinion and are easy to make. Too greasy and too heavy. Will not make this again.

We are a family of 4.  2 like pierogis, 2 do not.  1 likes lasagna, 3 do not.  Everyone likes pasta & potatoes & onions & bacon.  I tried it.  It was devoured & I will make it again. Old adage - change the appearance of disliked foods & watch it disappear. Thanks for the recipe.-

I really wanted to love this recipe because all of the ingredients in it my entire family loves!  However, all of them together just didn't work for any of us!  I followed the recipe, too.  One son thought it needed more bacon...I thought the cheese on the top layer of noodles made the top too crisp.  I don't know; it was way too much work for a dinner that was basically a disappointment and for some reason just didn't come together.  I won't make it again.

Been making this for years and everyone loves it....for those that think it's bland, try a different cheese....Velveeta or Cooper Sharp. It's really simple, make a pot of mashed potatoes, add lots of cheese, fry onion, layer it all with the noodles, and bake! A great take-along dish!

This was okay.  We really like pierogis, so I thought that we would all like this.  Two of my kids, who happen to love potatoes and bacon, liked this, but the other one and my husband and I didn't really care for it.  I thought it was a little on the bland side with the noodles and potatoes, and my husband just didn't like it at all.

I love this simply, quick alternatve to the traditional Pierogi (I think it would even pass Babcia's approval).  I definitely followed advice from other reviewers such as: added onions and bacon right to mashed potatoes, made extra mashed potatoes, split the recipe into more layers, sprayed the 9X13 with cooking spray, covered w/ tin foil and added some of the bacon grease right to the mashed taters (Don't worry about the extra fat and calories, you're eating Pierogi's for goodness sakes).  The family loved it - I will definitely use this recipe again - you can't beat the simplicity while still acquiring the traditional Pierogi taste.

It was delicious, being that there is only 2 of us, we enjoyed this multiple evenings and I took some to my in laws and to work with me. Quite a heavy dish so I enjoyed it as my small main entree with a large side salad.

This was okay.  I probably liked this better than my husband did, but even I thought it was a little bland.  If I make this again I will try the advice of other reviewers who added the bacon mixture to the potatoes.  My husband added hot sauce to his and said it helped, but he adds hot sauce to everything!

I followed the recipe as written on this one and was not overly impressed. It was missing something that I couldn't quite put my finger on. (maybe more bacon would help?) It was okay/edible but I'm in no hurry to make it again. Maybe having an off-the-boat Polish grandma who made real homemade pierogies is clouding my judgement. Thanks anyway.

I didn't make any alterations on this and it was delicious. I did have a dry, hard top noodle and would adjust for that as suggested. Also I was a little concerned that this reads 40.7 grams of fat per serving. Surely that means for the entire casserole. My husband said it was better than his aunt's homemade pierogis and described it as light but filling. I would think it would be great for any kind of gathering. Also easy clean up.

This was yummy - a great comfort food but really bad on the nutrition. I would maybe make it again because my hubby went crazy for it but next time in going to try to cut out some of the butter.

This was okay. It could definitely use some improvements though. The first time, I chopped the bacon and cooked it as suggested. I had to toss it because it cooked so unevenly. It works much better to cook the bacon in strips, crumble, and return to the pan with the onion and garlic.   Next time, I will definitely try adding sauerkraut to give it more flavor. Also, BE SURE to add salt. It desperately needs it.

I was skeptical of this recipe because of the lack of vegetables and spices -- I was afraid it would lack flavor -- but it came out great! I substituted kielbasa for the bacon and grilled the meat, onions, and garlic.  The garlic and cheese match the potatoes and pasta nicely.  The leftovers kept really well, too.

Yum!  Eating this right now, and it's delish!  After reading a few reviews, I combined the mashed potatoes with the onion, bacon mixture and cheese and layered that with the noodles.  Then I sauteed a bit more onion in butter and put them on top.  This was pretty easy to make, and I'll definitely be making it again.  Next time I might try adding sauerkraut... maybe just on half, since my husband doesn't like it as much.

Oh my gosh!! This was soooo good. My Dad is Polish and I miss eating pierogis. I saw this and thought I would try it. My husband and I loved this dish! I followed the recipe exactly and it was so good. I did cover the casserole with foil so that the noodles wouldn't get hard.   Next time I make this I will probably use another onion and add it to one of the layers and I will probably use one or two more potatoes. I did let my onion caramelize and it was delicious!  This definitely wasn't a "quick casserole" though. It took a bit of time.

I made this for a church potluck and was very disappointed in it.  It was very bland and tasted nothing like any pierogies I've ever had.  Maybe a stronger tasting cheese would have improved the taste.  I'll never make it again though.

Very good.  The only thing I did differently was mix the onion, bacons and cheese into the mashed potatoes before spreading.  This just made it easier.  I am thing next time I may leave out the bacon and try it with ham.

I love pierogis.  I was introduced to them by my husbands grandma who is from Czech.  They were a big craving during my pregnancies!!  I was so excited to see this.  It was fun to do once and tasted fine.  I just felt so guilty eating all the carbs, not a lot of nutrition here.  The only issue was the top layer of noodles did not get completely covered with the remaining cheese etc., so it was just too tough to eat.  Otherwise, a tasty fun dish.

I grew eating fresh Pierogis but I've never once tried to make them. I happened upon this recipe and was determined to make it.  

I modified the recipe a bit.  I added a few more potatoes, a little more onion and 1 TBS of greek seasoning.

I put the bacon, butter and onion directly into the mashed potatoes instead of topping it.  

My family, which includes a 5 and 6 year old, loved it.  It's a very heavy dish and one that we don't make very frequently.  When I do make it I serve with something light - steamed veggies or a salad.

This was good, but I warn, do NOT use no-boil noodles.  You will have a hard mess on your hands.  I still gave it 5 starts because it would have been perfect had I followed the directions - lesson learned.

We loved this. It was a different way to enjoy an almost meatless meal. I used instant potatoes and it was very good, so fresh ones would be excellent. My husband, who isn't a fan of pasta, commented on how good it was.

This was sooo good! I sauted my onions seperatley and added them to the potatoes along with the cheese, I also added about 2 tbl spoons of cheese whiz to the potatoe mizxture. I cooked the bacon in the oven, I find it gets crispier this way and you can get rid of all the extra grease. I then cut the bacon and put a layer in the middle of the casserole and then topped it off with more cheese and the remaining bacon! Definatley a fatting recipe but you have to indulge sometime!Yummmm!

This was good- but I felt like it was missing something I couldn't put my finger on. But very tastey- hubby liked it as well. Good plain but better with the dab of sour cream and a bit of fresh salsa. Will likely make again.

This was a great meal!  My boyfriend ate it for every meal and snack until it was all gone.  I doubled the potatoes.  I think I doubled the milk also, but I think next time I would only use 3/4 cup milk.  I also added a little sour cream and feta cheese to the potatoes.  I also added garlic and a splash homemade tarragon vinegar to the onions.  I layered noodle, potatoes cheddar cheese, noodle, onion mixture and grilled chopped chicken breasts, noodle, potaoes cheddar cheese and topped with the bacon.  Served with sour cream.

Overall, This recipe was very good....a little involved and makes a lot of dishes.  We followed the suggestion of one reviewer that said to double the potatoes to 10.  I'm not sure if my potatoes we just big, but I had about 1.5 of potato/bacon/cheese mixture left. Also we prefered this recipe cooled a little.  When it just comes out of the oven it seemed a little (for lack of a better description) oozey.  After it had been out of the oven for awhile the potatoes set up and was just about perfect consistency.  Will be making this one again.

I thought this recipe was great!  It was very easy and everyone loved it!  Next time I would add more bacon mixture and give the potatoes a little more flavor, but it was like eating pierogies without all the effort!! Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME, this recipe is simply awesome. I only had the Barilla noodles that you don't have to boil, and I will never use those again for this recipe. I will definately keep the noodles you have to boil first on hand. I only put the bacon and onion layer on half teh casserole becasue I wasn't sure how the kids would like that part, and guess which side was gobbled down first? yeap the bacon and onion side. Hubby really isn't too big on leftovers, but the first thing he said was for me to make sure I save him the leftovers, and he wouldn't share them with anyone, so I would definately say this recipe is a keeper!

We had this at Easter with dinner, it was a nice change. The person who made it added sauerkaut to the bottom. To save time you can just use ready to use noodles and make the mash potatoes ahead or use leftovers.

This is a fun recipe and tastes like the real thing. I fiddled with the recipe, especially adding more cheese. My potatoes were a little thin but this is because I did not know exactly what size the 5 potatoes should be. Next time, and there will be a next time, I will add another potato to make them a little thicker.

My family loves this dish.  I have made a small change and that is I added steamed cabbage, a layer over the mashed potatoes. This dish is made almost monthly now.

This is a new family favorite. Froze the left overs and they are a great quick meal. I do think this recipe needs more bacon tho. This one is well worth trying!!!!!!

The potatoes need more seasoning.  Garlic and more bacon would probalby do the trick.  I added served with sour cream and that was good.  I don't know if I will ever make this again.

This was really good; my husband loved it!  However, the top noodles got really dried out in the oven.  I think next time I make it I'll use a little Alfredo sauce and substitute mushrooms for the bacon.

Made this for Christmas Eve dinner and there wasn’t even a spoonful left. Like others, I doubled the potatoes (10)  and milk and also mixed the cheese and bacon into the mashed potato mixture. I also used Oven ready Gluten Free noodles so added a bit of extra potato water on top before cooking I assembled the day before and cooked for 1.5 hours

I will make this again.  I used large shell pasta since its what we had.  Then after layering and forgetting the onion mixture decided to just give it a couple stirs, topped with cheese and a dollop of sour cream when served.  Very good.

between 3-4. I got the top a little crispy but it was yummy if you took that layer off.  It seemed like a lot of work but I also am super duper pregnant so that may have something to do with it.

This is very good, even though I had to leave out the bacon. I'm wishing I had replaced the bacon with something, not sure what for my vegetarian diet. Broccoli? Regardless, I'm glad I made it. Maybe next time I will use two smaller pans so hubby can have bacon in his half and I can experiment with my half.

I was really excited about this and really WANTED to like it. I fed this to my husband, two adult sons, and my daughter in laws---all who love pierogis. I had more than 3/4 of this casserole leftover. That does not happen at my house, EVER!  You might question if I made it correctly. I did. Not to brag, but I'm a darn good cook!  My family always enjoys my cooking. In fact, my husband has a culinary degree, but the family prefers my "down home cooking" that my grandmother taught me. So very sorry to the poster of this recipe. I won't be making this again. :-(

Really good.  I normally take all day to make perogies, and this was about 1.5 hours from start to eating.  Very tasty - check your seasoning so it tastes good to you!  Cover when baking for the first 30 minutes.

Awesome recipe! My daughter informed me that it was her fave new recipe!! Only changes were that I added cream cheese to the potato mix as I was a little short on cheddar. Baked for the full 45 mins.

WOW!! This was soooo good! Two bites in to his meal and my husband was already planning when I was going to make this again. I admit I have a hard time following recipes, I usually change things as I go a long depending on my taste at the time. I incorporated part of the sauteed onions/garlic mixture, sour cream, butter and preshredded Mexican Blend cheese into the mash potatoes to make it like a pierogi. I cooked the the bacon separate (but used the grease for the onions and garlic) so I could crumble it between layers but then I forgot to add it to the dish when I was putting it together. I'm glad I didn't put it in since it didn't need it in the end as this was very rich. I used paprika, the remainder of the sauteed onions/garlic and some shredded Pepper Jack cheese in between layers, and on top too. Honestly, I didn't think that it was going to taste as good as it did. YUMMMM!

This is a delicious substitutes to traditional pierogis!  I would suggest draining the bacon well since the bottom of my casserole was a bit oily.  Everyone in my family loved it.  I think you could modify the mixing and layering to your own liking and the dish will still turn out great. I would also recommend covering the dish while baking because my noodles were a bit hard around the edges.

Good recipe. I tried the following:
Adding a layer of saurkraut.
Leaving the bacon as a layer instead of mixed in.
Using Turkey Bacon.
Put cheese in the potato mixture.
Put Potato layer on top, covering all noodles.
Sprinkled seasoning salt on top when serving, just as I do with pierogies.
YUM!

One of my favorites. I made extra this last time and froze it, hoping it will be just as good the second time around. We'll see....I always use instant mashed potatoes, cuts the time in half,  and omit the bacon (just don't care for it) and it turns out great. Oh, one more thing..... the time I made this using "no-boil lasagne noodles" it did not work out so well for me. Not sure what I did wrong, but the noodles were super crunchy, it was like eating them straight out of the box! So, lesson learned, I boil the noodles as directed :)

This was really good. I followed the recipe with the exception that, I mixed the bacon, onion, garlic to the mashed potato mixture. I also mixed in some sourcream since I bought an 8oz container for this and didn't realize it was just for a topping. Will make again.

This was a great casserole tried at Christmas and then served for New Years dinner party with some changes
Changes are: increase potatoes to 8, mix sauted onions and bacon into potatoes.  I seasoned with McCormick Grill Mates, Montreal Steak seasoning and eliminated the garlic. Get you potatoes the way you like them before you assemble..lots of taste.  Then i just layered with the cheddar cheese but used swiss on the top final layer...it looks nicer.  I made this up the morning of the party and baked it that evening and it was great.
Keep it covered the whole time.

I scaled this recipe down because there are only three of us and left-overs aren't always eaten.  I should have paid more attention to the comment that about putting the noodles at the bottom and then the potatoes but I followed the recipe and ended up running out of mashed potatoes and only had one layer of noodles in the casserole.  I was a little disappointed that there was only one layer of noodles.  The taste was really good, however, so I rated it at four stars.  I may try it again and next time I will be able to fix the mistake in the directions of the recipe and put noodles first.

This was delicious. The only changes I made were to use extra sharp-expensive, white cheddar cheese, and more of it, AND I only used 3 cloves of garlic--and I also covered it with foil while baking. Thanks for the recipe!

This was gone in a second.  It was really good...but not great.  I would make it again...but with instant mashed potatoes for quicker prep.

I made this for my daughter's First Communion party and my Polish family LOVED it!  I suggest making sure the potatoes are flavored to your taste before you layer the casserole and I baked it covered in tin foil.  Delicious and super easy.

Mixed a bit of sour cream in with my mashed potatoes, and also added the bacon/onion mixture to the potatoes.  I love it. Different and comforting.  Thank you for the recipe.

This totally fit the bill for my pierogi craving (I can't find them here and have never made from scratch).  This was a little time-consuming to make (like any layered lasagna type dish) but very yummy.  I did take a short cut and make instant mashed potatoes (a cheat) and I did as some other reviewers and added the onions and bacons throughout the casserole.  This was very rich and pleasing and delish with some sour cream on the side.  Not good for the waistline, but a nice treat.  Thanks for the idea.

Again, I am reviewing this recipe based on differences between what I thought about the recipe and what my husband thought about the recipe. 

My husband thought it was "good". he did not thing it was good enough to make again. Even with the changes suggested by other reviewers. I expected it to be much better than it was based on the ingredients, but I did not like it. 

I have been married 13 years and have never really understood my husband's issues with food in which he thinks the flavor is good but he didn't like the consistency but did not want it eat it again because he did not like the consistency.  This is the first recipe that I understood that in all these years. 

I have loved pierogis since first introduced to me by a polish immigrant in childhood. Consistency aside, this did not taste anything like pierogis to me.

I wanted to love this recipe, but I'm just not all that thrilled with it and I'm not sure why. I love pierogi's and potatoes in general.. it just didn't remind me of a piergo. It pretty much just seemed like a mashed potato deluxe type dish. :(

This was just okay.  I am a garlic lover and I found there to be too strong of a garlic taste.  Would taste more like a perogie with less garlic.  Also I would put less milk if I made it again because I would have liked the potatoes a little thicker.  Other than that it wasn't bad.  I might make it again with some changes.

I left out the onions, and used two boxes of instant garlic mashed potatoes.  Easy.  will make again.
