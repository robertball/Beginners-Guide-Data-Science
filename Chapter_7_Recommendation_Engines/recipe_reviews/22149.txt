An easy meal to make in the slow cooker but not very tasty.  I probably won't make it again.

I enjoyed this recipe very much.  The sun-dried tomatoes and basil really perked things up and gave it a mediterranean feel.  This recipe will be a family regular.

The combination of flavors is divine. If you love white beans and this recipe is for you.  This turns out incredibly well and very tasty.  Just do not overcook the beans; cook for the minimum time suggested.  These beans freeze very well too.

Good recipe. I didn't have the oil-packed tomatoes so I just used regular dried and added them into the beans while they cooked. My beans were quite old and they took FOREVER to cook! :) Didn't have dried basil either so I used marjoram. They tasted good, very tasty and easy

We loved this recipe, although I did substitute kalamata olives for the plain canned type, and I added a little chopped fresh rosemary. Great slow cooker recipe.

This dish is OK.  There is some bitterness to the beans.
