I made this on a MUCH smaller scale (serves 1) with 1 oz of each of the ingredients!  I really like it, and wish I was at a Christmas party to share it with others!

Not having a large punch bowl, I made about 2/3 of this recipe and it was plenty for at least 20 people.  Strong stuff but delicious! Even those who did not like eggnog alone liked it. I called it White Russian Punch.

Great smooth drink for a Christmas party.  We added some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg which made it extra special along with a little more eggnog.  It was liked by all!

This was very tasty. I do NOT like to serve high octane to my party guests so I totally skipped the vodka using the suggested amounts of Kahlua and Baileys only. Without that extra bottle of vodka, it was still delish and had plenty of alcohol flavor without being over the top. Great way to use up leftover eggnog too.... Just scale it to two and use 1/2 cup eggnog and 3/4 oz each of kahlua and Baileys. Thanks for sharing!

Egg nog cant be found other than at xmas so simply use milk or cream with ice and 1 ounce of the vodka, kahlua and bailies/carolina/panama jack and its like a desert you want to have over and over again!  Yummy.
