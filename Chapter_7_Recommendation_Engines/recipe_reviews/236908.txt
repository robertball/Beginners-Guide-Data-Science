I've made this twice now for two different parties, and am making it again tonight for New Year's Eve. It's been a huge hit every time! For parties I make it with smaller "two bite" potatoes.

Tasty and easy to tweak with other toppings. can't go wrong and everyone will love them. I used regular potatoes because it was what I had on hand, just left a little extra pulp on it so the skin wouldn't tear.

It was a great hit. Everybody raved about it. I made a couple changes. I never put the bacon on it. I started with caramelized onions and then added all the rest of the ingredients. I made it spicier with extra black pepper and Cayanne pepper. Just before the second bake I put a V groove on the surface of the potato and filled that with more cheese and put Cayanne pepper and paprika  around the edges. Baked it until the cheese melted and then broiled it until browned and served with sour cream to top it.

Everyone loved them! I did low dairy, so I added coconut yogurt  instead of sour cream, and they were still pretty awesome.
