I've cooked mushrooms with white wine a bunch of times but never thought of using red. For this recipe I used a very robust Chianti, and it turned out fantastic! I added the garlic when the shrooms were partially softened - 10 minutes would have burned it horribly. Thanks!

A very simple recipe to mix up plain fried mushrooms. I used fresh basil instead. It turned out to be a very tasty sidedish that recieved more attention than the main. I'll try it again. Maybe white wine next time.

I live in an alcohol-free household, so I made these using vegetable broth in place of the wine, and served them over pasta with a little dusting of fresh-grated Parmesan cheese.  Absolutely marvelous, and I will make these again and again!

Simply lush and delicious - a pleasant surprise.  I used a little more butter but no other changes.  It takes awhile to cook down but with patience makes a beautiful, rich red wine reduction - but it's only as good as the wine you use.  Hubs chose a Columbia Valley cabernet for our dinner which he also used in the mushrooms.  This put our grilled steaks over the top!

I used a few splashes of balsamic vinegar the second time around because I didn't have any wine in the house. Still tasted good, but the wine was much better.

The Mushrooms were pretty good but the red wine can be a little over powering if not done right.

This was simple and tasty.  My son wanted sauteed mushrooms and had tried making some on his own, causing the smoke detector to go off in our kitchen. I pulled this recipe up for him to try so he could learn to saute.  He really liked it.  We ate them with spaghetti and meat sauce.

My dad makes the sauteed mushrooms using sweet vermouth as the wine, I have since adopted the tradition and it is my absolute favorite way to have mushrooms. We let the liquid evaporate almost completely to bring about a more caramelized and sweet flavor. They are so versatile too because they can accompany or top any meal or even replace the meat of a delicious mushroom sandwich or any other entree. YUM!!

I love it! The only thing I had to change was that I used chicken stock because my cooking wine had been used up.  My 9month old & my 2yr old ate it without any problems & the 2yo asked for more, eating them by itself.

This is a wonderful recipe and VERY easy.  I made it with beautiful mushroom caps that I decided not to stuff, and I'm glad I didn't.  I cooked this a little more slowly, so I wouldn't break up the caps. I used the ingredients as listed, but added 2 tbsp of EVOO.   Everyone raved.

Made these tonite on the side of our grilled steaks. So good, I wish I'd made more! Only thing I did differently was add a little bit of kosher salt. Thank you Amanda for sharing!

I didn't like this one as much as the Mushrooms with Soy Sauce Glaze recipe. Perhaps it was the wine that I used but I love mushrooms and garlic but it didn't hit a homerun. Sorry.

I used this recipe with sliced portabellas.  I added a tiny bit of soy sauce too (I like salty).  It was awesome!  I use red wine with just about everything and this fit right in.  I think I might try a little smoke sauce and maybe some onions in the next batch

I made this for New Year's Eve dinner and served the mushrooms over steaks. Very good! I would recommend using a dry red wine, I used a sweet one but dry would have been better, especially over the meat.

I made the mushroom dish tonight and served it on top of penne pasta made with veggies.  Instead of butter, I used truffle oil and instead of wine (because I didn't have any), I used chicken stock.  It was delish!  I will make this again.

Loved the wine paired with the mushrooms.  Gave them a good deep flavor with the yummy garlic.  I did 1/2 tbs butter and 1/2 tbs of olive oil.  These turned out great!

I was nervous about this recipe, because I had only ever used white wine when cooking mushrooms, but I'm so glad I tried it!!!  I used Pinot Noir and this came out EXCELLENT!!!!!

MMMMM....we LOVE mushrooms!  These were very yummy.  I used baby bellas, cut the recipe in half for just the 2 of us.  Did not add the garlic until closer to the end as you don't want it burnt and used an oak aged Malbec wine.  These were fantastic with our steaks!

If you you’re not into cooking with wine, just sauté in butter, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Garnish with beautiful Parsley! Very flavorful and only takes minutes to sauté before you serve the Mains. Or, can be an Entree (Starter) in of itself.

My family loved it. The red wine was a little overpowering for my taste, so I added another tablespoon of butter, and salt and pepper for more flavor. I would make it again...maybe use white wine.

We've been serving this at my restaurant for nearly 40 years. The only change is that I use small whole mushrooms and sprinkle garlic salt lightly over top just before serving. This dish has always been intended as an appetizer or a steak topping

Here's the scoop:
For moral reasons I don't eat beef. 
No big deal. It's personal. I really like cows. 
BUT I miss my dads steak and mushrooms. I dream about it sometimes. And when I crave it make this recipe with two tiny changes:
Cut the wine in half
Double the butter (ok...triple the butter. And use a great full fat butter, like that Irish stuff in the gold wrapper)
THEN I slice a few days old baguette (so it's chewy, not crunchy) into ten pieces, spread even more butter, and sprinkle some GOOD quality grated parmasean (the kind without the cow stomach. Duh. )
I spoon the mushrooms on top of the cheese/butter/bread and I swear it is better than any steak you've ever had in your life.

Delicious! Reduced the recipe to 1/4 the amount since I only had a small container of sliced mushrooms and it turned out great - just enough as a side dish for two people. I would recommend letting the sauce reduce so the mushrooms can sear and caramelize. They were a great compliment to our leftover prime rib (the Chef John recipe) and would definitely make again.

DELICIOUS!  I eyed the ingredient amounts and used fresh basil.  A perfect side to my ribeye steak.

I thought the color was a little weird after adding the wine...reminded me of red beets. But they tasted ok.
