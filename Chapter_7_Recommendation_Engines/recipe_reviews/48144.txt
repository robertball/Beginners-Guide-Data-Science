My loving wife complained from the first moment she heard the word "curry" until she was finished the 3rd bowl.  If i would have told her the original recipe had ketchup in it, she would have freaked out!  she mentioned that the curry was making her thirsty and sleepy.  i prevailed, though, and kept a cool head the entire time.  by the end of the night we both had several bowls full of this delightful dish, even my cat was licking the bowl clean!! and guess what?  the cat didnt complain one bit. :D  i would definitely make this again, only next time i will not mention any of the ingredients.  i will simply put the plate in front of her mouth and say, "EAT!"

The flavor in this pie was excellent.  However, the whole can of beef broth in the mixture made it difficult to thicken, even with extra cornstarch.  I would also increase the potatoes to 1 1/2 or 2 lbs. if you like a lot of potatoes.  But I am definitely planning on making this again with half a can of broth.

This recipe has excellent flavor and is easy to make.  I agree with the other review, that the curry adds zip to recipe.  I used sharp white cheddar for a good cheese flavor.  It's a keeper!

YUMMY! This recipe ROCKS.  Made it pretty close to the original recipe. Omitted red bell pepper (didn't have). Used a can of drained diced tomatoes in place of the fresh. Left the skins on the potatoes and mashed them with extra milk and real butter. Instead of the cornstarch and water, I added a packet of brown gravy mix to the beef broth. For the vegetables I used frozen corn, peas, carrots and aspargus. I layered the bottom of the casserole dish with potatoes then the filling with another layer of potatoes on top. Used a combination of shredded colby and cheddar cheese for the topping. Baked at 30 minutes at 375 degrees. This was delish!!!

Lord have mercy this was good! I followed the recipe, except for substituting the "package" of peas & carrots for 1 can peas/carrots and 1 can creamed corn. I topped the beef/carrot mixture with the can of creamed corn once in the casserole dish, I didn't heat together in the skillet;   The creamed corn tasted like heaven mixed with the saltiness from the Soy Sauce and tang from the Worcestershire. Do try!  I had a similar dish at The Shed Brewery in Stowe, VT. However, they top theirs with Cabot Sharp White Cheddar. I recommend using this if you have access to it (in the specialty cheese section @ your grocery store). I ended up using medium cheddar and it was fabulous- but will definitely splurge next time on Cabot Sharp White Cheddar!

A favourite of my family. I prefer to use fresh vegetables instead of frozen and some extra potatoes. Also I add some extra cheese to the potatoes when mashed or some sour cream for extra flavour. A little parmesan cheese added to the other cheese before browning is great too.

Super tasty! I like a lot of flavor in my food and this is very flavorful! My boyfriend really likes it, I made it a few weeks ago and then he requested I make it again when he had a friend over this past weekend. This is now the only recipe for Shepherd's pie I want to use. :)

I made Shepherd's pie for my husband and 16 month old for the first time tonight using this recipe...they both loved it!  I thought it was good too.  I omitted the tomato and red pepper, because I did not have on hand, and added some precooked ground pork sausage.  I put in the full amount of curry and thought it really added something to the dish.  This was fairly easy, and very tasty.  My husband had seconds and asked me to make it with double the meat next time (?)  Not sure I will do that but at least he wants to have it again :-) Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for my English brother-in-law and he raved about this all night.  He especially liked the additition of the curry powder.  My own family liked it very much as well.  We will definately be making this again!

I love shepherd's pie and was anxious to try this variation.  However, this was just okay for me.  I thought there was way too much of the veggies in proportion to the meat and even though I like curry, I didn't particularly care for it here.  Clearly, I'm in the minority though!!

I thought this has potential and will try again with only 1/4 teaspoon curry. I lived in the Caribbean for 8 months where I acquired a taste for curry but my other 6 family members did not care for the curry taste even though I reduced it to 1/2 teaspoon. After reading other reviews, here's what I did: I used green pepper instead of red. I used 1 cup of defrosted frozen corn and 1 can of drained, cut green beans instead of peas and carrots. I omitted the tomato. The veggies as written, work fine but I was accommodating 2 family members preferences. When browning the meat, I added 1 more chopped garlic clove with the green pepper and large (12 ounce) chopped onion. I omitted the oil as it's unnecessary and spooned off the fat from the meat after browning, as it's unhealthy. I only used 1 cup of beef broth. I used 1 & 1/2 times the amount of Yukon Gold mashed potatoes & mixed it with the cheese. I cooked it for 25 minutes at 350 to marry flavours before broiling for 5 minutes, to brown.

While the flavor was good, this is not a shepherds pie. It is a cottage pie. The good flavor does not provide what I am looking for when I want shepard's pie.  Kind of like wanting a piece of pumpkin pie, and getting apple. Both are good, but not quite the same.

This was so yummy and easy. I did change it up a bit. After I browned my beef with garlic and onion I drained off the oil, I omitted the bell pepper and added 1 can green beans and thinly sliced fresh carrots. I also did not have Worcestershire so I used A1 and I did not have curry so I used lawerys seasoning salt for added flavor. I used 1 can of drained diced tomatoes instead of fresh. I will be making this again and again. Thanks!!!

This was excellent! I agree with previous reviews that the full can of broth made it way too soupy. I needed to let the filling simmer quite a while in order to reduce to a more "gravy" consistency. As well when prepared into a casserole dish, there just didn't seem to be enough mashed potatoes as per the recipe. Next time I will double the mashed potatoes. Delicious recipe! My family just loved it!

Great Shepherd's Pie recipe, I suggest you half the entire recipe if you have a family of 4.  We have soooo much left over, but oh well, I bet its good heated!   I loved the curry and even added extra to suite my taste.   I would DOUBLE the POTATOES!  I had to cook more so the top of my 9 x 13 pan would be covered.

This is a terrific recipe!! My family really enjoyed it. The flavor of the curry adds a lot of depth and kick. Nothing against the last reviewer, but we didn't find the curry overwhelming at all, but everyone has different tastes.  I would definately recommend this to all!  Thanks for a wonderful posting.

Yum! I didn't use cheese and I made a white sauce instead to pour on top (butter, flour, stock). I scallop cut the potatoes instead and partially boiled them before putting them on top, as another variation instead of mashed potatoes. Yum!

Not a curryhater, but I think this dish would be better without it - even the half teaspoon I added with kids in mind.  Even then, it was a lot of work for a rather simple dish.  I won't make it again.  Maybe next time there are extra mashed potatoes, I'll try another version.

This is a great shepherds pie recipe, have made it twice now and tweaked it a bit the second time (was good as is)  I used a heaping tsp of curry powder for some extra flavour (because I like curry) and I used julienned carrots instead of frozen.  Just let them cook with the beef mixture.  I did not pop it in the oven right away, made ahead of time, then put in oven for about 1/2 hr @ 375).  Best to cover with foil until the last 10 min or so, so that the cheese does not get too brown.  Yummy.

This was really great! I pretty much followed the recipe exactly but used the Country Crock already prepared mashed potatoes. I added butter and sour cream to them before topping the meat filling. Topped with white Cheddar! Delcious -- a keeper. The curry really does add a nice touch and "zips" it up a little -- subtle but very nice! Thanks for sharing.

This is so good--the best shepherd's pie I've ever eaten. I was curious about the curry, but I used the full amount and am so glad I did; the curry really is essential. I made the sauce portion exactly as stated; for the veggies, I didn't have frozen peas, so I used frozen carrots and some chopped celery, and I didn't have a red pepper. I jazzed up the potatoes--milk, butter, sour cream, and parmesan cheese. My husband and I really enjoyed this and I will make several more times. I can't say enough good things about this recipe--thank you for sharing!

This turned out really tasty! I followed the recipe pretty closely. I omitted the tomatoes altogether because I didn't have any, and we don't like cooked tomatoes much anyway. I know several other reviewers have said that it was too soupy with an entire can of broth, but I used a whole 14.5oz can of chicken broth (rather than beef) and it was fine, but maybe that's because I didn't have any added moisture from the tomatoes? This ended up being a much bigger pie than I expected, so I had to put it in a 13x9 pan because my casserole dishes were too small (I probably also used more mashed potatoes than the recipe) but all that really means is that I'll have leftovers for lunch tomorrow and that's okay with me.  Also, I recommend baking it long enough to get it bubbly rather than just broiling for 3-5 min, but that's just personal preference. I served it to the kids after just broiling, but then when the hubby and I were ready to eat we baked it for about 20 min @ 350 degrees. I'll definitely make this again.

This was good.  I was hesitant on the curry, so I used a little more than 1/2 tsp.  Next time I will try the whole because I didn't taste it.  Next time I will also just do peas, not peas and carrots, but that's a personal preference.

This was really really good!  I picked the peas out of the frozen veggies combo as we all hate peas and I added a bit more milk to the potatoes.  The only comment was that it needed more pepper.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe, we substitute corn for the peas and carrots (more kid friendly) and we use some various spices instead of the curry powder. Overall, excellent taste!

Very yummy dinner! I used green pepper instead of red, ground turkey, omitted the tomatoes, and doubled the potato mixture.  I only used 1 cup of beef broth, also.  I didn't want it too soupy.  I made it in a 13 x 9 pan and the potatoes just barely covered the meat, so next time I might more than double them.  We enjoyed the flavor a lot!

I forgot to put the ketchup in and didn't have any tomatoes or red bell peppers on hand, so they were all omitted. I added celery. I boiled the carrots with the potatoes and pureed them and then added them to the beef mixture (trying to be sneaky with a toddler in the house!). I also omitted the cheese on the top of the casserole. I thought it was delicious,as did my husband!  I really enjoyed the light curry flavour of the beef. I think that adding the ketchup and tomatoes would have detracted from this flavour. Will make again and again and again!

I used minced cooked lamb (traditional).  This was a great recipe.  Very tasty and quick to make.  The Worcestershire sauce adds a nice buzz.  Great quick dinner from leftovers.

this was great! I omitted the ketchup and Worcestershire sauce and didn't have beef broth so added a cup of water with a beef bouillon. i used fresh carrots and mushrooms for the vegi's...oh, and olive oil instead of the canola oil. a keeper!

Wow I loved this!  Normally I increase the spice amounts but I am glad I restrained myself.  It was just right.  I did add some paprika and ancho chili powder, just a bit.  Instead of ketchup I used chili sauce (that stuff in the ketchup isle, not an asian sauce) since I like it better.  I also used frozen mixed veggies that also had corn and beans.  Forgot the tomatoes, but man the red bell pepper is fantastic in this.  Thanks to previous reviews I made a lot more potatoes.  Glad I did.  Worked really well and I'll be making this often!

Excellent.  The perfect comfort food on a cold Sunday in November!  Loved the curry, its just the right amount.  The best shepherd's pie recipe I've found to date.  I used frozen mixed veggies (carrots, peas, green peans, corn, lima beans).  Added sour cream, salt & pepper to the mashed potatoes.

Good recipe.  I made it for dinner tonight.  I used frozen chopped green peppers and it worked well.  I also used chicken broth because (I cook almost everything from scratch and I don't have the ability to make beef broth yet) I didn't have beef broth.  Even with chicken broth, it was really good.  I didn't measure the curry and I wish I had...because next time I don't want to use quite as much.  I probably used more than a tsp.  If you are wondering about whether or not to use the curry...USE IT!! It was really good.  I just suggest that you measure it.   Also, I didn't have frozen carrots, so I just boiled sliced carrots with my potatoes, drained them, and picked out the carrots when they were done.  I didn't use Worcestershire sauce because it contains high fructose corn syrup and is a highly processed food.  Instead of milk, I used half and half and instead of butter, I used sour cream...just because of personal preferences.

Great for using up leftover mashed potatoes!  I used fresh baby carrots and next time I would zap them in the micro for a minute or two before I mix them in.

Great Recipe! I left out the bell pepper and tomato. I put everything in an 11 x 7 dish, and topped with 2 pounds of mashed potatoes (used real, ready made garlic mashed potatoes from the refrigerated section of the grocery store)...it saved time and tasted great!

We liked the flavor of the dish, but it didn't thicken up for me to what I was expecting. I've never made a shepherd's pie before, so I don't know how thick it should have been. I did add extra cornstarch, but it never got to more than a stew consistancy. It seemed like the frozen veggies and tomato added a lot of liquid. We did enjoy it, and will probably try it again with less broth.

I had recently made this dish for my family and they loved it.  My husband even brought it to work with him that night and I had some later for a snack, I could not stop thinking about it.  This is the besy shepherds pie I have ever had.

Excellent! Followed the recipe almost exactly. Couldn't find the package of just peas and carrots, so I bought a package of mixed veggies (peas, carrots, green beans and corn) and it came out fantastic! The wife loved it. Will be making this again in the near future.

Finally found a great version that we all liked! We made as described, but next time we will use a gravy packet to make the broth/sauce thicker. We didn't use peas and carrots as we didn't have any so we used mushrooms and corn. Tasted great! Thanks!

Only variation I made was using green pepper instead of red because it's what I had on hand. Have done this recipe twice now and it was a hit each time. This is definitely going into the winter meal rotation. Thanks!

This recipe was very tasty, but it did not turn out exactly as I had hoped. I thought there was a little too much curry. Next time, I will cut back the curry in half. Mine also came out a little too watery, so I would add less beef stock. Lastly, 1 lb of potatoes was not nearly enough (I used sweet potatoes), and I did not have enough to spread over the dish. I would use at least 2 lbs or about 4 large potatoes. Other than the few shortcomings that may have been my fault, it tasted very good.

This is a really good recipe. I didn't add tomatoes or crushed garlic - used garlic powder instead. I also used 5 large potatoes and sprinkles of the curry powder. I did add more cornstarch than the recipe calls for. If this is your first time trying this out - don't worry. it's a very flexible recipe and if you like sheperd's pie you'll know the flavor you're after so don't be afraid to add a little bit more or less of whatever works for your palette.

This was a great Shepherds Pie.  I liked the different flavor from the curry.  I omitted the bell pepper.  I added diced tomatoes from a can.  It never did thicken though from the corn starch.  I kept adding more and it was just too much broth.  Next time I will reduce the broth.

I love one pot meals and this dish has EVERYTHING in one place! Veggies, meat, carbs... even dairy! It's so delicious and easy to make, especially for busy people like us that don't want to slave over a hot stove after a full day of work.

This is insane!!!!   It is absolutely yummy, but still very healthy!  I added more garlic and chopped up some hot peppers, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Oh my.....if you're considering making this...do it!  And make sure not to leave out any ingredients until you've at least tried it the way it's written.  Thank you for posting this Laura!

This is (seriously) the best recipe we've ever tried. It even tastes good cold and even better the next day (if thats possible!!!). Wonderful recipe. I couldn't find peas and carrots, and just put in mixed veggies. Its beyond delicious, its hearty and super filling.

This was awesome. I made bomb creamy-garlic mashed with red potatoes, left on some of the skin and threw in several chopped green onions. You have to make sure your potatoes are on point. Followed the rest of the recipe and was very, very impressed. The curry, ketchup, soy and worcestershire made the beef sing. Used 1 can of peas and 1 can of carrots instead of frozen. Used an entire bag of shredded Extra Sharp Cheddar and covered the entire surface of the dish. Coming out of the broiler you could hear the cheese sizzling and it got super crispy over the potatoes. Served this with fresh out-of-the-oven biscuits. I made this for a Persian boyfriend who asked me to make him some 'white people' food (I'm a white country girl), lol! After he took his first bit he said i "nailed it". He had seconds, it was a hit!
PS. This makes your house smell amazing too, so your neighbors will be jealous;)

I am so upset. I followed the recipe exactly. The soy sauce was so strong in it. Maybe it was the curry. My 20 year old son who eats anything and had asked me to make shepherd's pie thinks it tastes like Chinese food. It is either the curry,or soy sauce, not sure. He will not eat it. If he does not like it,it is to likely my husband and other kids who are not home yet will like it. Homemade mashed potatoes and everything. I do not like it either.

This recipe is great tasting, but you definately need 1 1/2 to 2 lbs of potatoes to get enough to cover the top of your casserole dish.

This was tasty, but nothing special. I might make it again, but I don't think anyone will request it.

Excellent flavor.  Of course I made a few minor changes based on what I had on hand but this recipe is a good one.  I used some cream of mushroom with herb soup to thicken the sauce and used corn, green beans and carrots.  Also added some fresh mushrooms I needed to use.  Didn't have curry powder.  I added a bit of sr. cream to my mashed potatoes as well as a bit of the beef broth.  Think that using only 2/3 of a can of broth is plenty as mine was still a bit runny with the soup added.  Overall a really good recipe and one that can be tweeked and adjusted to your liking.

Delicious!  I'd say this rivals the shepherd's pies I've had in Irish restaurants, and the flavors from the curry reminded me of moussaka that I've had at Greek restaurants.  I made my curry powder from scratch, with almost every spice you can find in "curry powder ingredients" if you google it...  heavy with turmeric, ginger, cardamom, cinnamon, garlic and cumin.  Not "spicy" but oh so flavorful.

This was really good!  Some great ways to save some time and use pantry ingredients are to sub the fresh tomatoes for canned diced (fire roasted are especially tasty!) and to make large batches of mashed potatoes ahead of time (which can be used for all sorts of recipes).  My curry powder was specifically Maharajah Curry Powder from Penzey's Spices which is a mixture of turmeric, coriander, cumin, cardamom, fenugreek, ginger, nutmeg, fennel, cinnamon, white pepper, black pepper, cloves, red pepper and saffron.  I think this added some really interesting flavors.  
I did need to thicken my sauce with more than just the 1tbs of cornstarch and used some flour at the end to give it a nice thick sauce.

This was really good.  I have never used curry much and certainly not in this kind of dish.  I used about 3/4 teas. and that was plenty for my taste.  My husband and 3 young kids really liked it also.  I will make it again.  I did substitute a pint of home canned tomatoes instead of the coarsely chopped ones.

This was very delicious.  I used ground turkey, and instant mashed potatoes, and my family loved it.  Unfortunately, I did not have curry, but I definintely plan to use it next time I make this.  Excellent recipe.

This was a delicious recipe!  I pretty much kept to the recipe, except I added more potatoes, added some garlic to the potatoes, added garlic powder and oregano to the meat and a little more corn starch, soy sauce, curry, ketchup and worchestshire sauce.   I used a full can of broth and did not have a problem with it being too liquidy.   I baked it for 15 minutes before broiling, just to mix the flavors of the meat with potatoes etc.  My husband said it's the best shepherds pie he's ever had - even better than his own!!!  Definitely will make this again!!

This is a really good recipe.  We used MILD CURRY since my hubby does not like heat.  I used all fresh veggies.. This is great.. Used a little less meat and mushrooms, peppers, Onions, Garlic, Zucchini, carrots, adn peas.   The flavor got better as it sat, and the end product is wonderful.  Husband says it is a definate keeper, easy on the budget adn flavorful to boot.

This was pretty good. Cut back a bit on the curry (1/2 tsp.) since my family is not crazy about it. It gave it enough of a kick without it being overpowering. Will definitely do again.

This isn't typically what I think of when I think of Shepherd's Pie...it's better!!!! I'm in Italy where cheddar cheese is non-existent, so I just added a bit of parm to the potatoes and on the top before putting it under the broiler.  I did double the amount of potatoes to make it more of a 1:1 ratio with the meat and veggies.  The only other change I made was I used fresh carrots and added a small can of corn when I added the peas. Very good.

This is the best shepherd's pie I've ever had.  The addition of the curry is an absolute must.  It gives the gravy that little extra oomph.  I doubled the amount of potatoes to make a little more topping.

This was a wonderful dinner.  It has a full flavor and is very filling and comforting on cold days like today.  The cheese is a must and make sure you let it get the brown speckles. I added a can of corn and only used one tomato, which I think was perfect. My husband had THREE helpings. I added two tables spoons of sour cream to the potatoes.  They were a bit labor intensive, but real mashed potatoes are well worth the time.  I will definitely make this again.

DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT omit the curry powder! The flavor is subtle but does so much for this recipe. In making this, I didn't use any oil and didn't need to even though I used lean ground beef (I actually even drained it after browning). I sprinkled the ground beef with flour while browning rather than using cornstarch. I added chopped celery to the beef and used seasoned instant potatoes to save some time. The pie turned out great and the leftovers are even better!  Thank you Laura for the best shepherd's pie I've ever had!

Fantastic comfort food.  I made this on the first cool day at the end of summer.  It was a big hit.  I used a third of a bag of mixed frozen vegetables instead of the peas, carrots and tomatoes.  I would have used more veggies but not everyone at my house eats veggies.  Then again, my dad professes to hate curry and he ate two helping the first night and then took all of the leftovers to work.  I doubled the potatoes, and that was the chief complaint, too much potato.  That's pretty unusual around here so I think that they were just too bland.  I may try adding sour cream to them instead of milk or mixing the cheese into the potatoes.  I don't really know what spices to add to them to go with the curry.  I will definetly be making this one again.

I wouldn't call this 'quick and easy', but it is very, very good! The combination of spices work really well. Be sure to use sharp or extra-sharp cheddar as it adds an excellent flavor.

I doubled the potato as the original amt only made a thin layer for me.  over all it was not bad.  i liked it, and all the leftovers were eatin up.  not my typical style of dish so may not make again.  i grew tired of the flavor and texture.  boyfriend didnt rave but he did like it.  And it was very easy to make.

This is one of my favorite recipes from Allrecipes.  A great dish for warming up on a cold day.  The flavoring from the ketchup, Worcestershire, soy sauce and beef broth is the part I never change because I love it.  I may make changes with the veggies or how I make the mashed potatoes, but I do not mess with the sauce.  My husband loves this dish, too. If you are hesitant about the curry just start with a bit less.  Really though, a tsp. of mild curry is not that much and it makes the dish.

So easy, I made in an oven-proof pan so it was basically 2 pots to wash.  I omitted the tomatoes (because I didn't have any) and used ground turkey (because that's what we had), and it was amazing.  We anticipated leftovers from our 3 person family...and there were NONE!  My 7 year old had 2 servings!  This is going on our regular rotation for sure.

I made this recipe as it is called for with the exception of taking it light on the beef broth. It was absolutely delicious. My husband is not a fan of vegetables or curry but this made his day. He says this dish is also called "Potato Surprise". I would recommend it to anybody!

This was my first ever attempt at Shepards Pie.  I left out the peppers and the curry, as I knew it wouldn't go over around here.  I thought it was really tasty, in fact, even saved the left overs and ate every last bite. The kids ate what I served to them at dinner, but said it wouldn't hurt their feelings if I never made it again.  Hubs didn't care for it at all. If it were just me, I'd make it again, but since no one else was thrilled, I'll probably skip it.

The curry flavor is amazing! This recipe is phenomenal!! This recipe was my first attempt at making shepherds pie, and I doubt I will ever like anyone else's! My husband loved it! He kept begging me to make it again!! I've made it twice so far and plan to make it again soon. One slight difference, I added ranch dressing in the mashed potatoes for a little more flavor and added the cheese right into mashed instead of on top.

The best!   Made this a few times and it’s always a hit with my guests.  I would agree on the beef broth being too much. I will reduce next time.

I made it with double the amount of potatoes. This seemed like the right amount. I can't imagine that 1 lb of potato is enough.

The spice mixture didn't seem right for shepherd's pie. It was OK but I will use a different recipe next time.

This is absolutely delicious. A tip: make it the day before you want to eat it. I thought it was a little soupy when it was fresh out of the oven, but a night in the fridge firmed it up and the reheated portion was MAGNIFICENT. I'll 100% be making this again.

While preparing this, I realized there was more "filling" than I thought the two of us needed. I filled two casseroles and topped one with the mashed potatoes. I then made more potatoes and used then on the second casserole. I topped with grated cheddar then mixed some parmesan and panko and sprinkled over the very top. 
     The pie was only ok for me because of the curry, although my husband loved it. Next time I think I'll try cutting the curry in half. the panko/parm topping was awesome. The second pie is in my freezer!

This was delicious!I substituted only because I didn't have on hand: Beef "Better Than Bouillon"/water for Beef broth, chopped parsnip and fresh peas and carrots for frozen,1/2 t curry + 1/2 t tumeric for 1 t curry. The reduction in curry, as my husband's not a fan.I think the addition of the parsnip and tumeric gave this a mild sweet flavor

4 stars for Flavor + 1 star for Quick & Easy.  Maybe one more star for Comfort Food.  This dish was very easy to make, and can easily feed 6 people.  Just like another review, I cheated and used instant mashed potatoes.  Worked out great!

Zippy Shepherd Pie Haiku: "I make the same way, but cinnamon, not curry. But this was still good!" An old British pal of mine told me that it's referred to as "Cottage Pie" when it's with meat and not lamb, and he also taught me of the magical transformation that occurs in said pie when a little bit of cinnamon is added. This recipe is darn near identical to the one that I make on occasion, but it's curry instead of cinnamon, so I thought "let's try it with a different spice!" We were delighted with the results, even having gone the cheater way with instant mashed potatoes on top. Very filling, very tasty!

In the past, I never care for Shepherd's Pie but my husband loves it,  so I came to this site and found this wonderful recipe.  My husband liked very much and now I do too.  It was super easy and very, very good.  I didn't change anything, I followed it line by line. I recommend to use the curry, people who doesn't like curry won't realize it has curry but it gives it a kick. I will fix it again.

I made extra potatoes, because I love mashed potatoes!  Also, I used red pepper flakes and extra worcestershire sauce in the beef mixture.  Easy to make and tastes great.

Very yummy!  Like others, I prefer fresh veg to canned or frozen.  I added steamed fresh green beans, and for the ground beef, I put chunks of a mid-quality steak in the food processor.  Very nice comfort food!

Browning the crumbled meat prior to topping with potatoes is definitely a new method from the original recipes of Shepard pie meatloaf style. I've made recipes both ways and both are good. My family liked the gravy with this recipe. Making it meatloaf style there isn't gravy unless you make it seperately.I will be making this recipe again..

Great base for me ... I added extra garlic and grated carrots and celery and mushrooms, as well as corn and peas ... I never measure anything and just sautéed it all together ... I added ranch and cheese to the potatoes as well as put a layer of grated cheddar between the meat and potato layers... Lots of hot sauce, soya sauce and worchestire sauce ... Hubby and the boys ate it and almost had no leftovers

Great recipe.  Shepherd's pie is usually not my favorite because of the dull and heavy flavors.  This was excellent!  The soy and Worcestershire sauce made it anything but bland and the tomatoes and curry brightened up the whole dish.  Very nicely balanced.

The soy sauce, worcestershire, ketchup, and curry give the meat a wonderful flavor. I've made a couple slight variations that, for me, bump the recipe into 5 star range. Steam and salt some fresh veggies. Add a bit of flour to the beef mixture if it's too runny to hold up. SO YUMMY. Thank you!

This recipe is very good. We made it for a dinner party and decided to make a few changes based on other peoples comments. First, we upped the amount of potato (doubled it) to have enough for a nice thick layer. We also added sour cream and chives to the potato to give it a little extra kick. We also used nearly 2 teaspoons of curry powder and added 1/4 cup of red wine. This gave it a nice rich flavor! We loved it and our friends did too. It paired excellently with some yummy garlic bread and a nice side salad.

SOOOO Good!! I didn't give it 4 stars b/c i was disappointed that it wasn't more firm out of the oven. I think the mashed potatoes would've had the chance to "dry out" a little if I baked the entire casserole rather than have just broiled it for 5 minutes. Followed recipe EXACTLY -- was sooo tasty! Thank you!

We loved this. I made as written except for changing out some vegetables. No peppers or peas & carrots but I added mushrooms. Tomatoes are hard to come by in the winter so I drained a can of fire roasted tomatoes and used that. This recipe has a depth of flavor that I have never had in shepherd's pie before. I was scared of the curry and shouldn't have been. It just adds the much needed kick that shepherd's pie needs! We will be making this every time we have leftover mashed potatoes.

My husband used to call it Shepherd's Poop ... until I made this recipe!

Amazing and easy. Just the added curry, beef broth, Worcestershire sauce this makes a full flavored meal. Ketchup isn't even needed! 

I modified the recipe slightly, by adding 2 lbs of 
lean ground beef (instead of 1lb), and it was amazing. 

Will definitely use this as inspiration again soon.

Loved it. My wife and guests also loved it. Made it for the first time tonight. I made extra because  I thought it wouldn't be enough but turned out to be lots.  I am not a big curry fan so I didn't use a lot of it but will try again with the full amount to see which I like better. I changed the way to thicken it up. In stead of cornstarch I added about 2 Tbls of flour to the meat mixture after draining all the excess fat and mixed in well as the meat was cooking. Then I added the beef broth slowly till I thought I had enough gravy. I did use a whole can because I did make an extra large batch. I also put cream corn on top of the meat mixture and as I am a big potato fan I use a lot of potatoes. After placing it all in the casserole dish I put in in the oven at 350 for about 40 minutes then turned on the broiler and added the cheese. It seemed to work well for me as I do love it to be hot out of the oven.

Love.  It's the comfort food I was looking for.  I love curry, so I just had to try it in Shepherd's pie.  I also added corn.

Absolutely loved this recipe. I made with instant mash potatoes since for some odd reason my kids prefer them.  My mother in-law was skeptical about the meal because we told her it had curry in it, but everyone loved it.  I had to almost double the corn starch to get the broth to thicken, and I did read other comments and ended up baking it for 30 minutes prior to broiling.  Again, wonderful, thank you.

I made this for book club last eve and they loved it!!!  I used veggie crumbles (tofu hamburger), vegetable broth, skipped the tomatoes. I used 1.5 lbs of potatoes and 2 Tbs butter.  Baked 350 for 30 mins to heat through, put the shredded cheese on top and broiled for a few mins.  The curry was a nice addition..not to strong but slightly more than a hint.   Excellent!!!

Followed the recipe very closely, just subbing in some corn instead of peas and baking it in a 350 degree oven for 39 min before adding the cheese and broiling so it was piping hot and delicious. I would not agree that it's a "zippy" shepherd's pie though. I'm pretty adept in the kitchen and this definitely took longer than 20 minutes prep, but I'm giving it 5 stars for its delicious and interesting flavor. The curry definitely adds a nice little curve ball to the flavorful.

I was excited about the curry powder, curried everything is delish!  Maybe i should have added more as I didn't notice it. It wasn't that zippy to me either, it was fine but I prefer other recipes.  Thanks for sharing, though, I like trying new things.

I Love this recipe!  Shepherd`s pie is my favorite and this recipe is the best I`ve had yet.  The only thing I changed is that I added a can of cream style corn and omitted the peppers.  Yum Yum!

First review I've evee written but this is also the first recipe I've had turn out so bad. 

The ratio of meat to potatoes going off the recipe wasn't enough to even cover the entire top. The meat part was way to wet, I couldng get it to set up. For all the different ingredients in this recipe it was super bland. 

Disappointed.

This is the best shepherd's pie I've ever made, or eaten.  I did use tomato paste instead of the tomatoes, though.  But the flavor was delicious, and the consistency of the sauciness was just right with the paste addition.  I like that you only need to use the broiler for a few minutes rather than baking it.

I backed off on the curry powder a tad so that my 2 y.o. might eat it, and she did! A keeper recipe! Very easy and leftovers the next day were even better! Only suggestion is that I would make more potatoes next time.

Wow! Curry in this is genius, and makes so much sense especially with how much of an impact Indian style cooking is making on English culture. This pie was lie taking a bite of England, soooo good, and so easy. I used two pouches of instant butter mashed potatoes and beef gravy instead of broth, so I used a tad of milk to thin it out a little. So good, soooo good.

It was really tasty. I didn't have soy so I added a splash of A1 and some salt.  It was a bit runny so I think next time I'll add a bit extra cornstarch or figure out some sort of rue.  I'm definitely making again.

I put a couple less ounces of broth in but it was still very runny but good. It could have been from the frozen corn and peas I used releasing water when cooking. We love curry but I guess we are so use to it we couldn't taste it in this dish.  I measured 1 1/2 pounds potatoes before skinning them and I am glad I did because it was just enough.  I used a round corningware dish about 8" across and it fit perfectly.  I don't think I can broil in this dish without breaking it so I baked the dinner for 20 mins. at 400 degrees.

I use this recipe whenever I need to send a meal to a family.  Everyone loves it.  One woman even told me she wanted to lick the dish when it was empty!  I used mild, red curry paste instead of curry powder and frozen mixed veggies.  Other than that, I pretty much follow the recipe as written  I've served it to many people and get raves every time.

Very good! I don't know why they call it zippy though... it does take a while to chop and saute. Here were my adjustments: used a pound of leftover pot roast instead of ground beef, added 14 oz fresh sliced mushrooms, added 1 more clove garlic, used fresh carrots and frozen peas, added a cup of frozen corn, used canned diced tomatoes, omitted the red bell pepper, added another tablespoon of cornstarch, used a tablespoon EVOO to saute veggies, and used Betty Crocker instant mashed potatoes. The best part of the recipe was the spice combination. The curry powder was great! You could tell it brought out the flavors. My boyfriend was shocked when I told him that was the secret ingredient. Also, I baked this at 350 for 20 minutes before the broiler, just to meld all the flavors together and hopefully thicken it a little more. Could have used 3/4 can of broth instead - although it helped moisten the roast beef in my case.

This was really good!  The curry and other flavoring ingredients really made it a standout.  I used what I had so changed it a bit.  I had elk steak so used that.  Chopped it fine.  I sauteed an onion (had no garlic or veggies).  Added the meat, browned it.  Seasoned with the ketchup, soy (had no Worcestershire, so doubled the soy), curry, salt and pepper.  Added the broth (just a cup) and thickened with cornstarch and water.  Added sour cream, butter, half and half, cheddar and romano cheeses, salt and pepper to the mashers. Spread on top and baked 20 min., broiled for 5 min.  Husband said it was the best shepherds pie he'd ever tasted by far.  We both had seconds!!

Very yummy, but I made quite a few changes. First of all, I used ground turkey. I didn't have soy sauce, curry powder or tomatoes, so I added a 1/4 tsp. paprika and sage, plus 1/8 tsp. of nutmeg. I didn't use frozen veggies, but I did use canned corn and green beans. (Added them right before I put it in the oven.) I chopped up fresh carrot to saute with the meat and other veggies. I added extra garlic into the potatoes and had to add an extra tbsp of cornstarch to make it thick. The recipe doesn't tell you what type of pan to bake it in so I just made it in an 8x8...alittle too thick, but very yummy!

I would double all the spices and sauces to give a bit more flavor.  It heats up for leftovers very well.

this was one of the best shepherd's pies ive ever had and much more flavorful than any i have ever made.i loved the curry in it. i didnt have any tomatoes so i left them out. i added some crushed red pepper w/the curry for more heat and i had some cabbage to use up so i boiled it along w/ the potatoes before i mashed them. this was awesome and i will make it again.

Pretty good...I made some substitutions and additions based on what I had on hand (used a can of peas and fresh mushrooms, left out the tomatoes and peppers) and I thought it turned out well overall.  I split the recipe into two 8X8 pans and am freezing one for later use.  I baked it in the oven at 350 degrees for 25 min.

I was searching desperately for a recipe similar to one that I used to make and this was the only one that came close. The curry was a new flavour but I have to say I enjoyed it. I substitued 3/4 of a large can of diced tomatoes (drained slightly) for the two chopped tomatoes and it worked out perfectly. I also recommend mixing the cheese right into the potatoes and sprinkling a little paprika on top and baking for 25min at 350 then broiling to finish. Will definately make it again.

It's great, even with my necessary substitutions. I needed to use canned tomatoes instead of fresh, and frozen green beans instead of the peas and carrots and it was still delicious! XOXO Joce

This was really delicious!  My husband and I both loved.  I used a bag of mixed veggies instead of peas and carrots which was really good.  This is the best shepherd's pie recipe I've had.  Only thing I would add to directions is to drain the meat after cooking, but maybe that is self-explanatory.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good! I've been buying frozen shepherd's pie at the store - not anymore!
Since it's only my hubby and me, once the meat was cooked, I froze half of it.  I cooked the remaining half in a bread pan since a casserole dish would have been too big.
The only changes I made were to add some corn with the peas and carrots and to add some garlic to the mashed potatoes.

This was so amazing! My 1yr. old and 6 yr. old also loved this. I made some changes...I boiled and mashed carrots and potatos together, added fresh chopped spinach to the mash. I use soy ground round in place of real beef.
Update: I have been making this recipe for 7 yrs now. My kids still love it & ask for it often. 
I always double the curry powder :)

Family liked it, but I personally thought it had too sweet of a taste.  Maybe next time I will omit Worteshire sauce.  I used soup base instead of beef broth.  Added 1/2 cup corn too.  May omit curry also.

Even though I love curry, I was worried that my 3-year old wouldn't like this recipe. He loved it! And he keeps asking for more. Moreover, my husband, who has his own favorite recipe for shepherd's pie, actually prefers this one now that he tried it (although he was skeptical!). The combination of ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and soy sauce makes for a wonderful, complex flavor we're sure to enjoy frequently from now on!

The "boys" (my fiance and his two friends- all big guys) loved this.  I used 3 potatoes + a package of instant-mix potatoes to cover the whole beef mixture.  I also used 1.5 lbs. of hamburger, and dry peas plus frozen corn instead of carrots...it was great! The whole pot was gone!

I made a huge bowl of mashed potatoes as a side dish last night and used the extra for this tonight, and that along with frozen chopped veggies and pre-grated cheese helped make this genuinely quick and easy. I used ground turkey, substituted flour for cornflour which always works in a pinch, and used 2 bouillon cubes with 2 cups of water instead of the broth. As-is the recipe is pretty good, some changes make it quick and easy; still experimenting to make it fantastic.

This recipe was very nice.  Diffently goes into my "comfort food" list.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to use roasted garlic, instead of fresh garlic and added some corn.  My family LOVED it -- well, my 13 year old boy gave it a three, but the others rated it a "5".  Really nice favor combo!

Very good recipe. The cheese in the potatoes can be easily substituted with Parmesan. I chose instead to use a tablespoon of tomato paste, and used oxo beef bouillion with 1 3/4 cups boiling water to dissolve. We were very happy with how this turned out.

I wouldn't say that this receipe was bad, exactly, but it wasn't good either.  It was odd and even though I like curry, I did not like it in this recipe.  I would not make this again, even without the curty.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I substituted canned corn for the peas/carrots but that's the only change I made.
Very nice change to an old standby.  Even better as leftovers ~ the flavors have a chance to "ripen".
AWESOME!

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. 
Loved the curry. I did use two times the potatoes, and extra cornstarch as suggested, but did not cut back on the broth, turned out great. Thanks for this new addition to my "comfort" food recipe collection.

This is a great recipe.  I am not a big fan of curry, but the curry I have is not very pungent, so this was "do-able" for me.  The curry did give an extra layer of flavor.

This recipe is FANTASTIC! My husband loved it and couldn't get enough! I had 2 helpings and usually don't eat a lot of ground beef. The spices are just right. Very flavorful!  Simple and delicious! YUMMY! Will definitely be making this again and again.

Excellent recipe. Don't let the curry scare you off. It gives depth to the sauce and emphasizes the taste of the vegetable melange. I made this recipe as written with the exception of using regular tomatoes, which I didn't have. Cherry tomatoes, which were on hand, worked just as well -- better, maybe.

Highly recommend this recipe. Fast, easy, tasty. Thanks to the creator for sharing.

First time cooking for my husband as he always cooks and this recipe was very easy to follow along and ended up great! I did have to add more mashed potatoes as we are obsessed with potatoes but he was very happy with this surprise

Mmm it was just ok. I am used to my moms recipe in which the meat sauce is much room based so I tried to have an open mind.  In my opinion it was much too tomatoey. I followed the recipe exactly.

Loved this dish. The meal was quick to make. It had the ingredients in our pantries. The curry was mild but totally made the dish. My Shepherd Pie recipe for keeps.

I enjoyed this recipe. I agree that it was difficult to thicken the gravy and I also added more cornstarch. I also found that I had the cook the stew portion longer than anticipated to soften the peas and carrots. Next time I think I will do half the onion and red pepper, omit the tomatoes, add mushrooms and cut the broth in half. I think I will defrost the peas and carrots and simply add them when browning the beef. I also added sour cream to the potatoes and made twice what it called for. Overall, this was very tasty. The kiddo ate three helpings.

Was good, but the meat was a little on the sweet side… from the ketchup perhaps?    I'll omit ketchup next time.  Overall a good pie.

Everyone loved it.  I didn’t have curry so just left it out.  I used canned beans & corn instead of frozen.  Ive also made the whole thing except cheese on top & frozen.   Was great thawed baked about 40 mins. Then broil it brown.

The only things I changed was using flour instead of corn starch, and also used a can of diced tomatoes (drained) instead of fresh. Excellent!

I make this recipe over and over. I love Shepherds Pie to begin with, but this version has a twist with curry powder and truly sets it apart. I highly recommend it. I’ve made it with regular potatoes, sweet potatoes and a mixture. I also just grab a bag of frozen veggies that has more than peas and carrots. Enjoy!

I did use frozen mixed vegetables, and omitted the tomatoes. My English hubby enjoyed it as did I, the curry spice was a great enhancement.  It was quick and easy so I’ll make it again.

My guests enjoyed this pit very much.  Neither had ever tried curry before and it was an experience for them, one I will have to try and take further with some other dishes.

The comments were bang-on and a big help in making this dish.  I increased the potatoes, cut back the broth, and reduced the vegetables.  I did give the vegetables a brief nuke to ensure they were not too hard in the dish as well.  Overall, a great dish.  Thank you, Laura, for sharing!

I've done this a few times now.  I make them as individual servings in ramekins and then freeze them.  I struggle with getting the potato to spread across the ramekins, last time I did it, increased the potato by about 50% and used a piping bag to get it in place.

My daughter has liked this recipe so much that she is now making it for herself to have at her Mum's place.

I would say easy but not ‘zippy’. 
The whole family liked it. I used pepper jack instead of cheddar on top.  Next time I will double the potatoes.

Excellent flavor!  The only change I made was to substitute mashed cauliflower for the potatoes, for health reasons.  I will definitely be making this again!  A great way to get the family to eat more veggies!

This is perfect as written. I added sautéed mushrooms since I had them on hand, and 1/2 teaspoon cayenne for a little heat. Very delicious and will definitely make again!

We loved it both had second servings.I didn't have curry so I add a seasoning I always have what's called Miraculous it's is made by a gentleman here in Texas. Really good goes on to everything kind of seasoning. I added everything but milk or any oil used 93% lean ground beef.I did what I read added more mash potatoes which were instant.Hubby never likes to try anything new but he liked this ! Will make again

Not a huge shepherd's pie fan but had a bunch of frozen veggies I needed to use up so decided to try this out. I made double the recipe to have extra to give to friend in need. I used two 16 oz bags of frozen mixed vegetables.  I added extra (approx 2 extra Tb) worcestershire sauce and some ground cayenne pepper ( 5 dashes) instead of curry.  Overall satisfying but a bit bland. Also skipped the broiling step as a ran out of time but definitely would make the dish a bit more attractive.

This was very good and can easily be adapted to what you have available. No fresh tomatoes, then add a can of drained diced tomatoes works. I just used corn and peas, as that is what I had in my freezer. You could make this with any ground meat you have in your freezer. A huge hit with my family.

This is a ‘cottage pie’, it has beef in it, a shepherds pie would have lamb and even as a cottage pie it shouldn’t have bell pepper, tomato sauce (except as a condiment), soy, curry powder or tomatoes (purée yes) anywhere near it.

This is a good recipe. I doubled the amount of potatoes and thought it was a good idea. I also used some frozen mixed vegetables and liked that too. My two adult boys and my granddaughter liked it too. 
 Yes, I’d recommend this recipe and I will make it again.

My family absolutely loves this dish. It’s warm and comforting and flavourful. A delicious upgrade to an otherwise very simple dish. I tend to add a bit more curry than called for, and to up the “zippy factor” I add crushed red pepper flakes and fresh ground pepper (the amount depends on my mood). The last time I made it, I used it as a dumping ground for veggies; red and green bell peppers, zucchini, corn, mushrooms. Still delicious! Tonight I’ve made the ground beef mixture and will freeze it, to be added to the potato pie at a later date for a quick meal.

I've made the meat mixture a few times. I serve it with a side of Hormel Homestyle mashed potatoes.  My husband has celiac so I use GF soy sauce. My family prefers no tomatoes and no bell pepper.  Tonight I doubled the recipe, except for the onion, and used one can of corn, in addition to the peas and carrots.   Excellent!

Excellent flavors. I don’t add all the veggies it calls for just out of personal preference or not having them on hand, rather I pour in some frozen veggie mix (peas, carrots, green beans, corn) that I typically have in my freezer at all times.

A great change from the traditional Shepherd's Pie flavor.  I really, really liked it! It has a slightly sweet flavor.  The only thing I did differently was to use a package of frozen mixed veggies, and frozen mashed potatoes that you steam in the bag.

like others have mentioned, the entire can of beef broth was simply too watery (the first time I've tried this recipe). The second time around, I cut the beef broth in half and it turned out to be great -- and not nearly as watery. I'm not an Irish cook, but this was a great recipe and my husband loved it :)

Very disappointed.  It's quite boring.  I omitted the bell pepper as I don't care for them.  I used Leseur peas and Leseur carrots.  And used more mashed potatoes to layer with extra sharp cheddar on top.  I also added garlic salt and pepper to the masked potatoes.  I wish I had read the comments where some added sour cream to the mashed potatoes.  It's just lacking something that I can't put my finger on.  Just very bland.  Even with the curry.  I'm extremely disappointed.

DELICIOUS!!!  I tried to stick as close as possible to the recipe, and think I did pretty close.  Used ground turkey (preference). I omitted bell pepper (just personal dislike), and used garlic and onion powder instead of actual.  Used canned diced tomatoes and a can of peas and carrots (was just what I had on hand).  Definitely a keeper!!!  I love to try new recipes, and this was actually my first shepard's pie.  I do believe this will be my only recipe from here on out!

I found myself having to up the seasoning slightly. Otherwise, this was phenomenal. I will absolutely make again. Everyone in my house was making sounds more often associated with the bedroom. I served it with a simple side salad. Yum!

Tasty.  The main problem is that there is way too much liquid; even using extra cornstarch this was almost a shepherd’s soup.  Also, I agree that it could use more potatoes. And a lot less cheese. I followed the spices in the recipe exactly, except for a little extra garlic, and they were yummy.   I changed the vegetables slightly, replacing the red bell pepper with some celery and frozen green beans. I also used fresh sliced cooked carrots and a cup of frozen peas. It needed more vegetables. I used a little over two cups of premade mashed potatoes (per the internet, that approximates 1 lb potatoes mashed) and it wasn’t enough. It made more like 8 servings. 

UPDATE:  I made it again and it was five plus stars. I used a ton of vegetables (celery, mushrooms, peas, carrots, and green beans, all in significant quantities). I left the spices close to the same, except I increased the garlic and the curry. I reduced the broth to 3/4 cup plus 2 tbs cornstarch, then added a bit more broth to get the consistency right.  And I used at least 1-1/2 times the amount of potatoes and half the cheese, baked for 25 mins at 375 and broiled it for about 5 mins.  Btw, prep time was a fair bit  longer than estimated, though I did have to chop more vegetables the way I make it.

Agree with other reviewers that the broth is excessive. I used Oxo concentrate with less water and that helped. I also used parsnips rather than potatoes. Very tasty. Also agree with other reviewers that the potato (or in my case, parsnip) quantity is too small. I used just peas rather than peas and carrots and they really add to the character and texture of the pie. I rarely cook with salt but this recipe does need a little salt.

I made this for St Patrick's Day and it tasted terrific.  I made it exactly as written except I was out of ketchup (??) so used tomato paste and a little brown sugar.  I also used flour and water rather than cornstarch for the thickening and maybe went a little extra per the other reviewers..Also used a fresh carrot instead of frozen. But the taste from the soy, worchest and curry was zippy for sure in my opinion.  When I make again I might cook more potatoes for a thicker topping. Easy and very tasty!  I seldom give 5 stars but nothing to complain about with this recipe. It is what it is.

This did not work for me. I thought I would try something different even though I have a great recipe for cottage pie. I should have know better. It had none of the right flavors for us. No one in my family liked it. Worchestershire, soy sauce, ketchup and curry? No. Just no.

The recipe has good flavor but is too soupy for me - I had to serve it in soup bowls, and the potatoes melted into the hot broth.  The frozen vegetables, tomatoes and seasonings provided enough moisture.  Next time I will try with beef bullion granules instead of canned broth.

Made it according to the recipe and everyone loved it,  even my picky Mom.  I used premade Bob Evans mashed potatoes and they worked great.

I love this recipe! My kids and I thought it was really tasty. I didn't have frozen carrots so I used corn and peas. I added a half of a zucchini chopped up and sauteed it and added extra curry powder. I took a shortcut and used Idahoan instant mash potatoes to top the meat mix. When my son comes home on leave from the Army I'm going to make it for him because I know he'll love it. Thank you for the delicious recipe!

for the potato topping  I prepared my potatoes the same way I do for twice baked potatoes. Mix sour cream, green onions or chives and crumble bacon into the cream potatoes then top with cheese.

Right on! Great recipe! I was skeptical about the curry because I don't like Curry but reading the reviews, I decided to try it. YUMM-O!  I did omit the tomatoes and red pepper because I'm not a big fan of cooked tomatoes and I'm not about to spend $3 on a red pepper but used corn only, threw in some mushrooms I needed to use (finely chopped cooked with the meat, onion n garlic) Montreal steak seasoning and about 4 tablespoons of cream cheese that I had leftover into the meat mixture.  I meant to throw some fresh chopped garlic into the potatoes but totally forgot. That will be absolute next time as they lacked flavor compared to the rest of the dish. Other than that, A+++ recipe that's very versatile. It's all in the seasonings. You will not be disappointed! Thank you!

I have made this several times and my family (picky kids included love it).  I usually follow the instructions pretty closely, though I do tend to increase the meat and veggies by about 1/2, I still have followed others’ advice to decrease the amount of broth (I use a beef base paste, so I use the same amount as for 14 oz, but mix it into less water). I also sub in a 14 oz can of plain tomato sauce for the 2 tomatoes (my fam doesn’t love chunks of tomatoes) so I pick up some liquid there.  We LOVE this with the curry, but I apparently ran out and didn’t know it, so today I subbed ground mustard and a couple dashes each of cayenne pepper & Mrs. Dash, and the fam all still loved it!  This is definitely me go to for shepherd’s pie!

Real tasty, but I made a few changes. The curry made this dish weird so I'm not going to add it next time. I didn't have corn starch, but I added a whole gravy packet instead and only put in about 3/4ths of the beef broth can just to make sure it was thick and seasoned enough (and on top of that I added a lot of pepper), which I would DEFINITELY recommend. I also only added about 2/3rds of a 12 oz frozen peas and carrots bag bc that seemed like the best veggie to meat ratio for me. I also used one packet of instant mashed potatoes but next time I might use 2 because one packet did not cover the whole casserole dish evenly.

This is very easy and delicious! I didn’t have curry powder so used chili powder and substituted a thinly sliced fresh carrot for frozen ones. Both my husband and I? loves it. Will definitely be making it again.

Generally followed the receipe and it was good.  2nd time i added red pepper flakes, green chillies and chopped jalapeños to add more flavor.  For us, this was much better.  also, i did not like the frozen mixed veggies i used.  next time,  i will use all fresh veggies plus my spiced up ingredients.

This was the first time I ever made Shepherds Pie. This recipe is delicious. I did make a couple of changes though. I didn't have any curry powder, so I didn't add that. I didn't have any tomatoes, so I added a small can of tomato paste instead of the ketchup and tomatoes. I used half & half in the mashed potatoes and a stick of butter. It turned out so much better than I thought it would. My husband loved it and I can't stop eating it. I'll be making this one again.

This was really good!  I didn't have all of the ingredients so I had to substitute a few things: frozen peas and carrots became two carrots chopped and nuked for two minutes to soften them, four chopped canned whole tomatoes for fresh, and I didn't have peppers so I skipped them.  I need to go grocery shopping!  I will definitely be making this again -- one of my kids who doesn't like Shepherd's Pie went back for seconds and told me it was really good.  

The Worcestershire/soy/ketchup/curry/stock mix would also be fantastic in the slow cooker to make shredded beef.

I put a little too much beef broth in the mix, so the end result was a little runny. BUT the taste is excellent. Husband loves it.  I'm a novice cook and this was easy to make (although it requires some prep--making the mashed potatoes, grating cheese, etc.)

Great recipe as is. I would double the recipe though, as the leftovers would be great and these servings were pretty small (suggests 6 servings for the recipe). 
I've made the recipe without the bell pepper and beef broth (didn't have either), and instead added a bullion cube and it turned out great as well.

I've never made Shepherd's Pie before and my second attempt will NOT be this recipe. Not enough meat, too much onion, not enough mashed potatoes and the meat mixture never thickened up. Bland tasting. Huge fail.

Savory, warming, filling.  I wasn't sure about the curry but glad I added it because it was delicious. I am glad I made this and will make it again.  My only change was to omit the cheese topping. I filled 1.5 cup plastic containers with this and froze - it is perfect for lunch at work. Thank you for the recipe.

Very good!  I was out of Worcestershire sauce and I used peas without carrots, and I didn't have any tomatoes, and I used instant potatoes, and it was still a delicious meal!

It's super easy and delicious. I made it with fresh carrots and added celery and extra peas - great way to get a fussy toddler to eat veg.

The savory sauce was delicious!  I would leave out the fresh tomatoes (personal preference) and double the amount of cornstarch for a thicker sauce.  I mixed the cornstarch with a tablespoon of the beef broth before adding it in (didn't want to dilute with water).

I love comfort food and this fits the bill. This was also really easy to make.  I did leave out the red pepper and curry because I don't care for those flavors but it was still awesome and both hubby and I loved it. I will make this again!

After simmering for over 30 minutes, it still didn't thicken. Since the recipe didn't say how long it might take, I stopped cooking it because I didn't want the veggies to become mush. I used my deep casserole dish because it was still so soupy. My cottage "stew" turned out really yummy anyways.

This is a family favourite.

I've been tweaking it every time I make it and have settled on the following adjustments: half the onion, a third of the Worcestershire sauce, vegetable broth instead of beef broth, add hot sauce.

I didn't have enough beef broth but did have some leftover French onion soup so I used that for broth(minus the onions) - outstanding flavour!!!!

The flavor on this Shepherds Pie was GREAT! I unfortunately did not have diced tomatoes so I put in a 8 ounce of tomato sauce. Because of this my filling was a little soupy. However,  my family didn't even notice. I doubled the recipe to feed a larger group, and have plenty of leftovers. I printed and saved, as this will be in my regular menu of goodies.

Easy...my 16 year old son considers this one of his favorite meals. I used a can of peas and a can of diced tomatoes instead of what the recipe called for as well as  a beef gravy packet instead of beef bouillon.

My husband had never had Shepherd's pie. I made this recipe and he and I both loved it.  I'll definitely make it again.  Like most "chefs" I made a few changes working with what we had in the kitchen.  I diced a sirloin steak instead of using ground beef, fresh carrots since we did not have frozen, and used a mixture of small red and yellow potatoes.

So yummy! The only change I made was that I used all fresh ingredients, no canned. I just cooked them with the meat so they would be soft.

I don't keep curry at the house normally, so that was left out... But otherwise I followed the recipe almost exactly. I only used 1c beef broth (1c water & 1t bouillon), used frozen veggies, and no red bell pepper (didn't have any). This was the best shepherds pie ever!!!

We really liked it. I agree with the reviewers who said it could use a little less broth next time. The amount called for demanded a few more tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken and even at that, took a bit more time than I had allowed. I did not have mild curry so used medium and cut it to 1/2. I also agree with the reviewer who said it could use more potatoes so next time will simply add more. But overall a great recipe. Thank you for sharing :)

Excellent recipe, full of flavor!! I didn't have any ketchup, so I used my own homemade BBQ sauce instead, I also used just half of the broth because that is all I had handy. My family devoured it! I think the addition of curry, soy sauce and Worcester sauce is what sets this recipe apart and makes it so yummy. I haven't made Shepherd pie in quite a few years because my family doesn't like bland food. Every time I would mention it, my husband would be like "naaah"... Coming across this recipe and seeing the ingredients listed, I knew it will turn out delicious. And it did!  A total keeper for us! Thank you for sharing this!!

Great recipe followed exactly except for using instant mashed potatoes(cuts down on time) and adding another pound of beef for my husband who likes meatier dishes but kept the seasoning and everything else the same. E. curry really helps to add a unique but great flavor

well, it is a good recipe, but wasn't so "zippy".   It took time chopping, sauteing, etc.   Just so everyone knows.

Husband liked it very much.  Used our garden green beans and carrots, corn, instead of the peas.  Otherwise very good.

This was really good! I made a few changes - green instead of red pepper - part of a can of peas - fresh carrots because I had them - half a can of diced tomatoes drained - flour instead of corn starch - only 1 cup of beef broth (used cube) and didn't add curry. I cheated and used Bob Evans mashed potatoes (large package). Next time I'll precook the carrots because they were too crunchy. Flavors were great. Meat mixture was a little greasy but I'll drain the grease off the chopped meat next time. And there WILL be a next time!

I love this recipe! I didn't have frozen peas and carrots but I did have fresh garden green beans and fresh carrots. I added then while the beef broth was simmering. This turned out awesome! This is perfect for a cold fall day! Thanks to the person who shared this recipe!!!!

Wanted to find a recipe to use up leftover Thanksgiving mashed potatoes.  I like cottage pie, and the "zippy" part caught my eye, so I gave it a go.  I tried to stick to the original recipe except:

-- didn't have cornstarch, used packet of brown gravy mix
-- didn't have beef broth, used chicken stock, and added enough to make it moist but not soupy (8oz)

This recipe made a lot of "filling" (almost filled my 8x13 pan), but my leftover mashed potatoes were not enough to cover it with a good ratio, so I took some filling out, put it in a 8x8 pan, then covered with potatoes.  The leftover filling was tasty on its own or with bread, but the combo of filling and potatoes was masterful!

The 1 teaspoon curry powder was enough to give it a unique flavor but not so much to overpower.

Also was pretty quick to make (I used my food processor to chop, I was in a hurry) especially if you buy pre-made potatoes (Costco has some good ones!).

Delicious! We make this just about every week for close to a year now...  I add 10-12 ounces of beef broth instead of 14 since its way to runny with 14 oz. I use about 1.5 lbs of ground beef. I use fresh sliced carrots, since we're not a fan of peas, and put those in a few minutes before I add the liquids so they're not too crunchy. I wait to add the tomatoes until a few minutes to the end so that they don't thin the mixture too much.

It either needs more potatoes, or I need to get a deeper casserole dish.  It might make an extra dish, but the liquid needs to be thickened. Can of diced tomatoes and no water.

I made this for this last week and really liked it. I was out of curry powder so tried a different mix of spices. It was really good. Am looking forward to trying this with the curry.

My mom and stepfather loved this and they both had seconds.  I did tweak the recipe a bit, based on what I had on hand, but otherwise I followed the recipe as written and it turned out great.  Will definitely make this again, thanks so much for sharing your recipe!

I didn't use canola oil as didn't need with the ground beef even though it was lean. I was concerned about the amount of curry powder but it really blended nicely and was subtle. I did make more than a pound of potatoes as others suggested. Due to food sensitivities, used gluten free flour instead of cornstarch and couldn't tell. Family not huge beef eaters which has nothing to do with the recipe but may make again. Split recipe into 2 9x9 pans (suggest 8x8 though) and shared with neighbor who said they didn't normally like Shepherd's Pie but liked this one!   :-)

Wasn't impressed. Seemed lacking in flavor for all the "flavor" ingredients. I had skipped the bell pepper. Adding Cajun spice seemed to save it. If there was a next time I'd skip the tomatoes. I'll likely try a different shepherds pie recipe next time.

This will a absolutely be one I will return to again and again.  Full of flavor and just right in texture.  I used fresh chopped carrots and frozen peas.  I think the secret to flavor is to let things simmer at least an hour on low.  But not necessary.  My husband and I just kept going, "Mmmmm" throughout dinner to the point we were laughing at each other.   AWESOME.

This is so tasty!! This shepherd's pie is so delicious. I followed many of the tips in the comments. I halfed the broth and used canned tomatoes. I didn't peal my potatoes because I'm lazy. The pot of beef and veggies is enough for two 8x8" casserole dishes. I made one and I'm going to freeze the rest for next time. Bottom line: A+, would make this again and again. Great Sunday meal.

Because of reviews remarking on the recipe being a bit watery, I substituted bouillon for the can of stock. The flavors are interesting; it's simple to throw together (I do not peel the potatoes); I like it. No one eats the leftovers but me. Good enough.

Tasted amazing. I made some alterations based on what was available in the fridge. To the beef: I added half a can of diced Italian seasoned tomatoes in place of 2 tomatoes. I only had chicken broth and added half a cup. I added some garlic powder, paprika, onion powder and chili flakes for some well needed flavor (about a teaspoon of each). Didn't have frozen veggies so added a can of veggies. And finally, to the potatoes: I added some garlic powder. I will make this again but if you are big on flavor, add some seasonings as I did. Enjoy!

Great recipe. As I needed it to be soft, I didn't add tomatoes and grated carrots into the thickening stew. Tasted great.  My family said this should become a regular meal.

This is delicious! I made the following changes. The quantity of beef broth is far too much. Even though I drained the browned beef and vegetables well, I had to almost triple the amount of cornstarch. Prior to that tweak, the mixture had a stew consistency, but I like Shepherd's Pie to have a thick but still flowy sauce. In my opinion, if you want to use beef broth or stock, be ready to make adjustments. I do like the flavor the beef broth gave it. For my family's taste, I doubled the amount of Worcestershire sauce and almost doubled the ketchup. I use Trader Joe's Organic Ketchup, which has a different flavor than regular, so my increase probably had a different effect than regular ketchup would. Be careful not to add any salt until the end, then do so carefully. I tripled the recipe, and it took awhile to cook but turned out fantastic! One note about that: I used only two bags of peas and carrots in the triple recipe and it was plenty. I drained one can of petite diced unflavored tomatoes and that was plenty too. This will now be my go-to recipe for this dish.

This is my favorite shepherds pie recipe.  Love the curry flavor; I use Cascadian Farms mixed vegetable, carrots, peas, corn & string beans.  It looks so colorful and tastes amazing.  I use about 1-1/3  pounds ground beef as that is what's in Costco organic beef package, I like the extra meat, it  makes more. 
Thank you for such a tasty recipe, I've made it about 5 times already.

OMG!  I have to be honest, I have never liked shepard's pie. I found this when searching for comfort foods and the recipe just struck me as tasty. I am so impressed after making it tonight. This is going to be a new family favorite for sure. We all loved it. Thank you for sharing.

Excellent flavor! Made this a couple of times. I agree with other reviews that a whole can of broth makes the beef watery even with cornstarch. Made changes, used a beef buillion instead of broth and diced tomatoes (italian) instead of fresh.
Thank you for this recipe!

This is so good!  I topped it with my own recipe of mashed potatoes but followed the filling almost exactly.  I did have  to add a little extra corn starch to thicken the gravy.  I froze some of the filling for the next time I have extra potatoes.  The second dish, using the thawed meat mixture, was just as good as the first.

So much flavor. So much work! USUALLY, I enjoy browning beef, throwing cream of something in a can in and topping it with instant potatoes. If I have cheese great. If I have veggies great too. I put in worcheshire and dried onion. It's almost as good as this.

This one was definitely a winner for my boyfriend and his brother! I made some changes though; I used canned diced tomatoes and pressed the juice out since both are kinda sensitive to acidic foods..and I omitted the ketchup and carrots (I didn't have either). Instead of cornstarch and water, I used a packet of gravy and no water --then realized it wasn't the consistency I preferred, so I added 3tbsp of cornstarch (1tbsp at a time) and let it thicken. I also put a bottom layer of mashers, filling and with the top layer of mashed potatoes I stirred the cheese into since I have a gas burning stove and things tend to burn. I topped it all off with cheese, definitely opened the broiler after 5 minutes to find the top completely blackened.....so I took a spatula and skimmed the burn off before anyone saw and served it. They went back for seconds and also took the left overs for lunch and asked this was put into the dinner rotation! *thumbs up*

Delicious!!! The flavor in the sauce is simply amazing. The curry adds a nice taste but did not taste like "curry". Our entire family loved this recipe! My husband decided to make it slightly easier and just stirred the butter and milk with the cheese cubes and then mixed the cubes in with the beef mixture and dumped it all in a baking dish with cheese on top. We also just mixed whatever leftover shredded cheeses that we had. But the flavor of the sauce is what made the dish so super yummy. Would be a great recipe to double for a crowd.

We LOVED this dish!  The flavor of the beef was excellent with the curry.  We are cheese lovers and had plenty on hand so I used more cheese on top than the recipe called for.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to drain the beef after browning so I decided not to.  Although the sauce was very flavorful, mine turned out a little thinner than I would have liked.  Next time I will try to achieve a more gravy like consistency by adding flour or more cornstarch.  I will drain the beef too.   We also left the skin on the potatoes and might have used a little more than the recipe called for, just a personal preference.  This is replacing my old way of making shepherd's pie for sure!

I didn't add tomatoes and used potato starch to thicken instead of corn starch.  It was really good! I'd make it again.

We had this for dinner tonight, and it was hard to leave a little bit leftover for my husband's lunch tomorrow!  I did modify slightly.  I used only a half pound of beef, just to cut back on cost and to make it a little healthier.  I added a cup of frozen green beans and a cup of frozen corn and only used 1.5 cups of peas/carrots.  Also, like others, I didn't have red pepper in the house, so I just left that out.  I wasn't sure if I'd like the curry powder, so I only added a half tsp instead of a whole tsp, and I think that was just right for us.  (I'm not a big fan of curry powder, but it was very subtle with only a half tsp.)  I also added only one cup of beef broth instead of 14oz, and I did still have to add a little more cornstarch to thicken it properly.  I used boxed potatoes, too, since I had those in the house.  My family really enjoyed it, and I'll definitely be making it more often.

I love this recipe! I've made it before following the instructions and it was awesome. I've had this terrible craving for shepherd's pie lately, but my dad's diabetic and I was just restraining myself from making it. Then I noticed another recipe that substituted mashed cauliflower on top and jumped at the chance to do that with this recipe. HOLY COW is it amazing! I just boiled and mashed a whole head of cauli; stirred in about a 1/4 pkg of cream cheese and 2 tbsp butter, salt n pepper; put that on top of the meaty pie and dumped a generous amount of sharp cheddar on top of that and in the oven (400 for 20-30 mins depending on if you let yours cool beforehand-- I prepped mine in advance of dinner time). I cannot reiterate how awesome this recipe is prepared like that! Great diabetic substitution!!!

I love this recipe. It is delicious... But I did make some adjustments. Instead of using curry, I used Sazon, half a pouch. I used can tomatoes instead of fresh. I used instant mashed potatoes instead of fresh as well. The flavor was amazing despite the changes. I agree with other users about the amount of beef broth, so I cut that into a half cup. It was still a lot. Instead of broiling I baked for 30 mins on 350. Delicious!!!!

I read the reviews first, so I seasoned the meat with garlic salt, and black and red pepper as it cooked. I also used about 2-3x more of the catsup, curry, soy, and Worcestershire sauce because I like bold flavors. I'm not sure how much because I just kept adding until it tasted right. I also used leftover mashed potatoes that had butter, cream cheese, and garlic salt. I don't think this really changed the flavor much because the sauce is what really gives this recipe its Zing. This is a great recipe that you can customize to your individual tastes. I love it:)

This was my first time making shepherds pie, it was great! I did use fresh carrots and replaced peas with corn! I also used 1 1/2 pounds of hamburger opposed to just 1 pound. It was a hit :)

This was absolutely delicious, with a couple small modifications.  Cut the curry powder in half. 1 teaspoon is too strong, half a teaspoon adds just the right amount of "zip". The flavours are really different and untraditional, but so yummy! Also I use flour instead of corn starch, I find it makes a better texture: after cooking the meat and vegetables, add about a third of a cup of flour and stir it in. Then add the liquid.  It was so delicious and I will definitely add it to my rotation!

Unbelieveably good! Husband gives it 6 stars! The only thing I modified was to omit tomatoes and bell pepper. I added diced baby carrots in with the onion and later added 1c cooked corn and 1c frozen peas when the beef broth was boiling. Delicious flavor!

Made this with my boyfriend a few times! We forgo the tomatoes (neither of us are fans of tomatoes) and he makes the mashed potatoes his own way with bigger chunks and a little more firm. We love the bell pepper in the recipe and crisp it all up in the cast iron pan he cooked the meat in. So delicious!

My family loved it. Did not add curry because it's not our favorite spice. Put vegetables in food processor to finely chop and not sure if that caused it to have quite a bit of liquid.  Cooked it down a little longer than suggested. End result, a "keeper".

This recipe needed a lot of work to make it edible.  First, there was at least twice as much broth as needed.  It was very soup-like and I had to add more and more cornstarch.  It was way too much 'gravy' and I had to drain most of the liquid. And I couldn't taste any of the seasonings so had to add more of everything to build any flavor into the dish.  Also 1 lb. of potatoes is like one large russet potato - not enough to even cover the meat, so I had to double (or more) the potatoes. I like shepherd's pie but prepare to make a lot of adjustments.

My family loves this, and I make it as outlined, but I prefer to sprinkle the top with Parmesan as I find that the cheddar makes it too oily. It's delicious!

It was just OK for me.  The amount of beef broth needs to be reduced.

I thicken my meat mixture with gravy granules, it makes it spicy without having to add ketchup. I also add wine to the meat whilst it is browining. I also add cheese to the potato and it makes it cheesy and delicious.

This Rock's - I increased the serving size by 50% and my boys (17 & 13) each ate 3 helpings.  I'll have to double the recipe next time so we have leftovers :)
I didn't have a red pepper but I had some leftover sauted peppers and onions I threw in with a can of mushrooms.   Fantastic fall meal!

YUMMMM!! But the mashed potato was too thick so I added more milk and a scoop of sour cream and a scoop of cottage cheese! I also used fresh carrots and I didn't have bell pepper so I put half a head of broccoli. Everyone loved it! Thank you for sharing, I would have never thought to put curry, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce in one recipe!

I love this recipe. We omit the carrots and peas and sometime substitute the curry for half the cayenne for just a little more kick but nothing beats this recipe.

This was absolutely wonderful. The flavor was fantastic. Don't be afraid of the curry. I don't care for curry normally and I was hesitatnt to add it, but I am so glad I did.  Thank you so much for the recipe!

This is a good base recipe. I realize that seasoning is always a personal taste, but given the recipe name and ingredients, I was expecting a little more "zip" out of it. I taste-tested at various stages and found that it needed quite a bit more help - additional Worcestershire and some freshly ground Italian seasoning help. Also, for the amount of liquid, including that from the frozen vegetables and fresh tomatoes, one TBSP of cornstarch didn't really provide a lot of thickening. When I make this again I'll add more to make it closer to a gravy consistency. Overall though this is good comfort food.

I love this so much. It is easy, flexible and always a family pleaser. I don't think you can mess it up. I usually use veggie crumbles or tempeh but this time I actually mashed up some veggie meat balls because that is what I had on hand and it worked out well. I usually use a frozen veggies mix with peas, carrots, and corn because I usually have that on hand and the corn is great in it. I used canned tomatoes instead of fresh and veggie broth instead of beef. I skip the bell pepper beacause I don't think I'd like bell pepper in something like this. You can use regular curry powder or hot curry powder and even add cayanne pepper to heat it up more. How can you go wrong with this? Just tailor it to your tastes and what you have on hand.  If you like mashed potatoes, curries, cheese, you will love this.

This was okay.  I followed the recipe exactly except for curry powder.  My chief complaint is that it was runny and didn't thicken despite the use of cornstarch.  It was "sloppy" when I scooped it out--everything ran all over the plate.  Flavor was good.  I made this for my husband and in-laws and no one seemed to care for it--no seconds for anyone.  I probably won't make again.

I am not a big fan of shepherds pie cause I find it too bland. This had a lot of flavor and a nice gravy. Nobody even asked for the ketchup and that is usually a must, with Shepherds pie, in our house. I used 2 lbs of beef, skipped the pepper, added 1tsp of chili garlic sauce for some heat, next time will increase to 2tsp. Used frozen mixed veggies, so simmered a little longer because green beans take longer to cook.  I boiled the potatoes,(I used 6 med/large) with some butternut squash for the extra vitamins, using 1/3 butternut squash to 2/3 potatoes, mashed together with butter, maybe I didn't drain properly or the squash changed the consistency, but I did not add the milk. Gives it a nice light orange color. Topped with the sharp white cheddar (though any other cheddar may do, this type of cheese is a must in my opinion) and put in the oven at 400 until the cheese was golden.  I did not think the casserole would be hot enough if I only broiled.It was very good, I will be making this again.

I didn't have curry, but it still had a great flavor. My kids HATE casseroles, so I was prepared to have leftovers for the next day.  I was pleasantly surprised when they wanted seconds! As my son says, this is a keeper!

It wasn't as savory as I wanted it to be . . . the mashed potatoes ended up cold because I let them sit around too long while I was prepping the hamburger mixture. Next time I would suggest whipping the potatoes directly AFTER prepping the meat mixture--and then I would recommend broiling for the browness right away.

The pie was relatively easy to make, but I think it could have used tomato sauce instead of chopped tomatoes, and I'm not sure about using the mild curry.  I liked it all right, but it's not my favorite, and my husband was not impressed.  I'll have to try it again with some changes.

This was an awesome, brought to a dinner and everyone raved about it.  I think the curry powder is the key. I would probably tweek depending on what ingredients available- made with corn, peas and red, orange and yellow peppers.  I will definitely make again.  Did have to use more potatoes to cover the dish.

Ok - I didn't use the curry, but only because my family doesn't like curry.  I did everything else as written, and the result was amazing!  My kids went back for more until it was gone.  Great flavor!

Absolutely loved the recipe but added an extra tablespoon of curry powder and less beef broth. The whole family liked it, too, including a 15 month old that devoured it. Thanks so much for the recipe, a definite keeper.

This was so good. One change I made was adding corn, and adding more potatoes. This came out so good. Also in the potatoes I used cream cheese. I think it added something. Very surprised to how good it came out. Not very quick to make, but still pretty quick. Way too much beef broth, took a long time to reduce.

I have five kids with few individual dislikes...but altogether it's challenging to fit all tastes.  I dont like to make casserole-ish type dinners much..but sometimes schedules demand it.  AND finding a one-dish recipe WITHOUT cream of this-or-that is difficult. All my kids love this recipe and it's really not all that unhealthy as most casserole-type-dishes tend to be (depending on your meat and how you prepare the potatoes).  Admitedly, I reduced the curry, though.  I also pile in the veggies and pile on the potatoes. Pretty quick preparation.  Thanks!

Great Recipe! I was so happy to find a Shepherds Pie recipe that didn't call for a can of condensed soup (very hard to find where I live). The seemingly random ingredients come together beautifully for a great taste. I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was delicious. Will definitely be making this one again. Also a great way to get the kids to eat veggies. :)

OMG!! This recipe is great. I did a pan and my husband and I ate it in less than 4 hours. The curry give it a kick. This is a keeper.

Yum!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We had our own recipe for the mashed potatoes (apparently it is my husband's secret) and added a little more curry.  The flavors were absolutely delicious!!!

This was delicious. I was hesitant about using curry but it added a great flavor. I am vegetarian so I used a veggie "meat" and vegetable broth but so glad I used this recipe instead of the vegetarian shepherd pie recipes. I served it to my non vegetarian friend and her teenagers and they loved it. She even asked me to send her this recipe. Can't wait to make it again.

This is the first Shepherd's Pie I have ever made.  Given my boyfriend's reaction I shall never make another version.  This was it!

This is wonderful!  I followed the recipe except for taking others' advice and doubling the amount of potatoes and I used a package of mixed frozen peas/carrots/corn.  Really delicious.
One of my pet peeves, however, is the time allotted for 'Prep Time',  My definition of that term includes any time needed to prepare the vegetables.  There's simply no way one can get this dish ready to go from a completely unprepared state in 20 minutes.  More like 40+.

Unbelivably delicious! The only difference I make to this recipe is that I bake it for 30-40 mins instead of broiling the top. Also, instead of tomato, I add corn. Other than that, IT'S PERFECT!!!

Good recipe.  I expected more flavor though in the sauce.   It really was a little bland.  I will make it again but adjust the seasoning.  Thanks

I love this recipe!  I didn't use the carrot because I'm not a big fan or cooked carrots. What I used is frozen peas and frozen corn. I made corn bread with this dish. Sooo, good! I had to make it again the next day because there was no leftovers.

LOVE this!  I used extra curry powder, 1/2 ground lamb, 1/2 ground beef and I use 1 1/2 cups water with a packet of beef gravy instead of the beef broth and cornstarch. Update: I add extra ketchup, worcestershire sauce and cooked fresh carrots. I mix parmesean cheese in the mashed potatoes.

This was really easy to make and I had everything on hand. I really felt like it was more of a gouhlash then a shepherds pie though. My family thought it tasted ok, but they could live without it. I think having the tomatoes in it is what really made me not care much for it, I also thought it seemed kinda soupy.

This was O.K.-but next time would either omit the curry all together or drastically reduce it, we found it to be almost overwhelming.
