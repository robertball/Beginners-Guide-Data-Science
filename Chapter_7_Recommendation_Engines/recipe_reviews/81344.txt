I used my own cooked, shredded chicken instead of canned, left out the pine nuts (only because I didn't have any), I used dill pickle relish (we don't like sweet dill relish) and I made my own coleslaw dressing. Oh! And I also used a reduced fat mayonnaise. YUM! This was excellent! My littlest inhaled his own sandwich and then took half of mine. No leftovers. It's GONE. Thanks for a new favorite chicken salad sandwich! NOTE FOR SELF: Next time, I think I'd add in more relish and some chopped celery, just to stretch it a bit more to get one more sandwich. That's really for us, not reflective of the recipe.

Awesome recipe! Much like Sarah Jo I made my own shredded chicken instead of the canned and also made my own coleslaw dressing. I added about 1/4 cup of chopped red pepper to the salad that needed to be used up. Also used lite sour cream and plain ff yogart instead of mayo (can't stand mayo!). Thanks for the recipe:)

Great sandwich!  I used my own cooked chicken breast rather than canned.  Kept everything else the same.  My family loved it and it held up really well for leftovers the next day.  No watery build up at all - that is a plus in my book.  Thanks GotRice? for sharing this delicious sandwich recipe.

my husband loved this salad except for the pine nuts and the parm.I used what ever cheese we have on hand.this works really good on leftover biscuits.I have used bacon on them and a little hidden valley ranch dressing mix for a change.even small kids have liked this sandwich it is a keeper.this is a great lunch or light supper if you add a nice light pasta veggie salad.
