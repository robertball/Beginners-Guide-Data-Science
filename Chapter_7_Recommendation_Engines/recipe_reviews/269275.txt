Delicious!  I made one change, I did not use an entire can of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, I used about 1/2 a can.  I thought it would be too spicy.  It was not, I will try it with the entire can next year.

This was a fantastic use for leftover turkey & due to the fact that I only had about 1 & half cups of turkey leftover to work with after the big day, I decided to throw in a can of drained and rinsed black beans to bulk it up. I'm making it again tonight with ground beef, but the only change that I'm making is substituting the poblanos with some defrosted hatch peppers I have on hand as my grocery store is currently out of poblanos.

This is delicious! I made a couple of changes. I had homemade red mole sauce in my freezer, and used that in place of the  enchilada sauce. I added 4 cups of turkey as well. It came out wonderfully.

This was an easy and flavorful casserole that doesn't use canned soup. We like our food very spicy, but a whole can of chipolte  was stretching the far end of our heat tolerance.

this has become a tried-and-true leftover recipe, whether it's thanksgiving turkey, pork roast, roast chicken, etc. it's delicious and filling and hard to mess up.

i will say that chipotles in adobo can be inconsistent, so i'd try adding 1/3 of the can first, tasting the mixture, and proceeding from there. i usually use half a can myself, and sometimes that comes out mild and sometimes it's perfect!

Outstanding - as usual with Chef John. Thank you for all you do. I have one suggestion for those making it. The chiles in adobo sauce can be VERY spicy so add a little and taste and add more to your tastes. Also thought about mincing up the chiles on a cutting board before adding to onion pepper mixture. As John says "This is just you cooking".
