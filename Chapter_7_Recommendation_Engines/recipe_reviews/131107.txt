This recipe has so many delicious ingredients however it needs tweaking for them to come together and each flavor not stand out too much from the others. Next time I make this and I do want to try it again, I'll cut the squash into smaller pieces, increase the broth to about a cup, use tomato paste instead of tomato sauce and add more garlic and onion. I'll also try simmering it in my dutch oven a little longer too. One tip with the butternut: before you do anything pierce the skin of the squash a few times and put it in the oven at about 400* about the time the turkey is done browning you can take the squash out of the oven (it will be hot) and cut the skin off and chop much more easily.

I was amazed at how well this turned out.  this is a great autumn chili!  I made a few changes based on what I had around.  Instead of chilies, I just added one serrano pepper, and cayenne pepper and red pepper flakes to keep it spicy.  I also added allspice, and it *really* brought everything together.  i left out the tomatoes, added more beans (I don't like chunky tomato bits).  really though, i really think the allspice made it FABULOUS.  my boyfriend doesnt much care for ground turkey or squash, but he loved it too.

Excellent. The only changes I made were to use corn instead of hominy, just because that's what I had on hand, and I added some oregano. Great flavor, we really enjoyed it. Thank you! :)

ONE OF MY ALL TIME FAVORITES ON THIS SITE.  Two additional comments:
1.  Must cut the butternut squash up into pretty small pieces (I like mine smaller than a 1/2 inch cubed) and cook for a while.
2.  MUST MUST MUST garnish with cilantro (if you are a cilantro lover) and eat with avocado.  It completely steps the dish up to another level.

I like the idea of this chili but think the seasoning needs a little adjusting. I added a couple of bay leaves and some oregano and, if I make this again, I would cut back on the cumin probably by half. (One can always add more if it's not enough.)

By my estimation this recipe is fantastic.  I can't say for certain because of the changes I made.  I used more garlic, 1 28oz jar of tomato sauce instead of the original tomato ingredients, I used leftover turkey instead of ground turkey, borrowed another reviewers suggestion to substitute canned corn for hominy, and I used freshly cooked beans instead of canned.  I think the cumin- chili powder- garlic salt proportions are fine as is.  It's got pep; however, it's a pleasant zing, not too pungent or hot.  (Jalapenos are kinda hot for me.  Habaneros are almost too hot for me to eat ever unless they are teamed up with something to counteract the capsicin.  I say this to help define 'not too hot', the 'heat' level for this was like mild to medium salsa.)  I had to extend the cooking time to account for the non canned beans, and I added the turkey (cubed) about halfway through to prevent drying out.  When I made it the recipe filled an 8qt stock pot (1 lb of kidney beans and a lot of leftover turkey is probably why).  My family was unanimous in their approval of the chili/ stew.  I will definitely make this again in the future.

I really enjoyed this chili but made many changes based on previous reviewers. Here they are:  I precooked the butternut squash at 400 for about 15 minutes before adding it to the soup. 1 can of corn instead of hominy. Added allspice, oregano, and more chili powder to taste. Added a bay leaf. 1 c. chicken broth (instead of 1/2). 2 diced fresh tomatoes instead of canned. 3 cloves garlic (instead of 2). No chilies. 1/2 T. cumin. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. To cut the sodium, I rinsed and drained the corn and beans.

We loved this!!  This is my new favorite chili.  The only alterations I made were leaving out the chilis and using leftover pureed butternut squash instead of cubed squash (much easier this way, too).  This gave the chili a nice thick and smooth consistency.  This was my first time using hominy; I really liked it.  We'll definitely be making this again very soon.

This chili is basically a miracle, thank you for posting the recipe!  Delicious, incredibly healthy, and fast.  Easily vegetarian and easily modified for different tastes.  This is now one of my stand-bys for parties, potlucks, and just cold days!

This was yummy. The only changes I made were to add in some shredded zucchini to bulk it up and to use black beans. I may have also added mor broth.. didn't measure that.  This was a very mild chili to me, which is what I was looking for. If you are looking for soemthing with a bite, use hotter peppers and some more seasonings.

Different.  I enjoyed it - my husband did not.  I followed the recipe just as is.  Next time I think I'll use more spices - it seemed just a tad bland.

This was a great chili however, because I do not care for ground turkey, next time I will use ground chuck.  I took the other reviewers advice and added more chicken broth and oregano.  I also used a potato as well....It was delish!

Thanks for the recipe...: )

This recipe has great flavor.  I used black beans instead of kidney (because I didn't have them). I skipped the hominy as well. It didn't thicken up like I would expect a chili to do, but I'm not sure if that has to do with the ingredients I left out or not.  I'm making this one again!

Delicious, quick and so easy! I did make a couple of changes: I couldn't find hominy so I pureed some corn; I used half chili powder, half smoked chipotle powder; I used 1.5 teas. of ground cumin instead of a full tbsp; and I didn't have garlic salt, so I added 1/2 tsp celery salt and 1/2 teas. garlic powder.   I used a leftover roasted acorn squash which was mashed.  This was one of the best chilis I've ever had, and definitely the best I've ever made.  It was nice and thick - I didn't need to add the chicken broth.  The flavors had depth and balance and it tasted like it had cooked all day instead of

This was awesome!  I forgot the chilis and omitted the hominy because I didn't have it, but it was still amazing.  Next time I will try the hominy and serve the chilis as a garnish.  Can't wait!

This was a great recipe...full of flavor and very healthy!  Instead of buying separate cans of green chile peppers and diced tomatos I just used two cans of diced tomatos with green chiles.  I also added some all spice per others suggestions.  I cooked it on a low simmer for about an hour, this allowed the flavors to really come together.

I love this recipe and it is a regular for my family. I use more squash just because I have it and a little more cumin, love the flavor. Great meal especially for a cold day and so easy to make.

I substituted 1 can of black beans and 1 can of pinto beans for the Kidney beans.  I also used diced tomatoes with jalapenos that I found at Kroger.  I only used one can of tomato sauce. I used to small cans of green chiles.  This was FABULOUS!  Even my picky 8 year old loved it!  I served it with shredded jack cheese, sour cream, and crushed corn chips.  This is my newest favorite recipe!!

This was absolutely delicious.  My very favorite chile!  After looking at the reviews I  used4 cloves of garlic, a full can for fat free chicken broth, added a tsp of allspice and mixed in a little corn starch milk mixure.  Cooked about 35 minutes. Yummy.  This is a definate keeper and will go in on my fall/winter rotation.

This is my absolute favorite recipe I have found on this site! I have made this chili a few times using my substitutions based on preference (for some reason I've always preferred a more stew-y chili vs. a soup-y chili). I double the garlic, eliminate the diced tomatoes, onion and green chilies, double the tomato sauce and add two shredded zucchinis and a dash of cinnamon. Delicious!!! Thanks for providing me with a great base recipe that I've been able to tweak!

This came out great! I made it last night and did not have all the ingredients on hand and it was still delicious.  Instead of hominy I used a can of corn and also had no onion so sprinkled in some onion powder- It was DELICOUS!

Delicious! I didn't follow this to the tee.. because my squash is huge! but I used specifically pasilla chili - it will give a nice warm kick! Don't worry, cook it a bit longer the squash will neutralize it and a bit of sugar will do the trick. I add black bean also in addition to the kidney bean, and instead of hominy i added corn almost at the end. The result is so yummy and warm. It's warm and good for winter. The squash melts in your mouth and you get the nice crunchy sweetness of the corn.

Great chili!  I used the green chilies as a garnish instead of cooking them in the chili.  I just used the squash I had and cooked up a pound of dry beans.  Easy to make!

Our family loved this dish. Even my picky 2 year old twins enjoyed it! It was filling and incredibly tasty. I'm from Alberta and I couldn't find hominy anywhere - so I omitted it. I also used white kidney beans for a change and increased the amount of chicken stock to 1 cup. We are all looking forward to leftovers tomorrow!

Family really enjoyed this one! I did use yellow hominy and chili beans instead of kidney and then reduced the amount of chili powder by about 1/3. Served with cheese and crackers but normally would have made corn meal muffins. It was great!

My entire family enjoyed this chili, however, I did add 1 sweet potato, an extra can of fire-roasted tomatoes, and 1 can of northern white beans (did not add hominy) and can of corn.  I baked the butternut squash & sweet potato first, then added to chili.  See picture #4.  We will definitely save this recipe and make it again in the near future.  Very easy and great for a fall night.

This is a great base recipe. I made changes some for personal tastes and some for health. I never use garlic salt so I omitted this. I used 1 1/2 cups broth and roasted the squash halves in the oven at 425 for 30-40 min. After roasting I scooped out the squash and mashed it then added it to the chili. It makes a great thickener and my grandson loved it. I also changed the diced tomato for a large can of crushed tomatoes. I omitted the hominy for personal preference and added a can of drained pinto beans. I also substituted 1 chopped jalapeno for the can of green chiiles that I didn't have.

Good chili.  Different from the ordinary.  Like that I was able to use up some squash too!  Even my 17 month old liked it.

This was fantastic! It's now one of my favorite soups! I couldn't stop eating it! My whole family loves it too! I didn't use hominy as we don't have it in our area except for one brand and it was nasty so I used frozen corn. I also used black beans as we like those better than kidney beans and this came out amazing! Will be making this often! thanks so much for posting this recipe!

This is surprisingly tasty. I was concerned about how it would turn out when I smelled the tomatoes in the pot with the turkey. The character of the smell changed entirely when I added allspice as recommended by another reviewer, and I'm so glad I used that suggestion!  I also used shredded turkey I had leftover from a whole roasted turkey.  I will try it with ground turkey next time just for comparison.

This was just OK.  I was expecting more.  I don't think the butternut squash added anything special.  It didn't really add to the flavor or the texture.  If you left out the squash you wouldn't miss it.  The dish tasted like any ordinary chili I've made before.

This chili is delicious, and healthy!  I added 1 tsp all spice (suggested by another reviewer) and she is right--it does tie all the flavors together and gives it a nice, holiday-sweet flavor.  Bonus: this recipe is super easy to make and impossible to mess up!

We're vegetarians, so I "beefed" it up with black and garbanzo beans.   Substituted paste for sauce (per other users)...  loaded up the spices and WONDERFUL!  The squash gives the whole dish a buttery/creamy feel and taste and gives it a nice smooth finish.  Lovely lovely recipe!

Im giving this 4 stars only because I didnt feel that there were enough seasonings. So I looked up chili seasonings on here and added that for the seasonings. My family loved it...After the kids ate it I told them it was squash. They were shocked. Thanks for this dish.

Really enjoyed this!  I took the advice of several others and increased the garlic - I used 4 cloves. Instead of hominy I used chili beans because I had them on hand. I also increased the chicken broth to 1 1/4 c. because I didn't feel like there was enough liquid to get the squash cooked - and I added a little cornstarch mixture at the end to help thicken a little since I used the extra liquid. Super good and I'll be making this again, soon!

I prefer to use pumpkin. The butternut squash was too sweet. I added corn instead of hominy and a can of tomato paste. I also up the chili powder to about 1/4 cup.

Very pleased with this!  I could not find hominy in the store and as a result I had to put in plain corn niblets.  I will make this a regular recipe.

Good.  My biggest disappointment was that the squash wasn't more of a dominant taste.  We love butternut squash but could barely taste it in the chili - it tasted basically just like regular chili.  I think that tomato paste would have been a better fit than sauce, but overall the flavor was good.  I upped the spices, added red pepper, oregano, and sage.  I also diced and roasted the squash first, hoping that the nice caramelized flavor would come through in the chili, but like I said, it disappeared among the beans and meat.  However, a good way to use up extra squash, particularly for non-squash eaters!  I would definitely make this again, but not waste all the time caramelizing the squash.

Very good chili, and pretty healthy too.  I happened to have most of the ingredients on hand, so that was nice.  I omitted hominy, but added some corn I cut off the cob.  YUMMY.  Will make again!

Really enjoyed this.  The only change I made was to cut the squash into 1/2" pieces (and I'm glad I did!) and omit the hominy because I didn't have any.  Healthy and tasty!  Served with cornbread, yummy!  I liked another reviewer's advice about draining the kidney beans and replacing the juice with more chicken stock.  I'll do that next time because I usually drain and rinse canned veggies before adding to a recipe.  Thanks for sharing!  I will definitely make this again!

I thought this was amazing!  The only thing we really did different was drain the kidney beans and add a little more broth to replace the liquid that would have come from the beans.

I softened the squash for 15 mins in the oven at 400 degrees before peeling.  I did agree that it needed to be cut into 1/2" pieces.  I did boil the squash seperately for 10 mins to ensure it got soft.  This lacked flavor so I added 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and it made it closer to 5 stars.  I really enjoyed the squash and did not find it too sweet.  I used tomato sauce as directed and it worked fine.  I did not feel the broth needed to be increased.  The hominy worked perfectly.  I cut down the cumin to 1/2 TBS and it was still pretty potent.  With adjustments this is worth making.

I initially cocked an eyebrow @ the butternut squash element. Well, shame on me. I've never had a better experience with the vegetable. (and, I've eaten my fair share of it) WOW! This is a favorite for me. Kudos! Love it.

Good, didn't use the hominy, just more white kidney beans which I rinsed and used more chicken broth to compensate.  As per another reviewer, used tomato paste instead of the sauce.

this was wonderful! i used about a pound and a half of shredded leftover roast turkey from a certain holiday meal and cut some corn off the cob to replace the hominy. also i didnt have green chilies, kidney beans or tomato sauce so i subbed chopped bell pepper, a can of great northern beans and an extra can of diced tomatoes. my family was in fear of too much cumin, so i cut that in half and it was perfect. i know it sounds like alot of changes, but its not too far from the original, i promise!

This is a pretty mild recipe, so if you like heat you will need to add some cayenne or chipotle.  I roasted my diced squash in the oven and stirred them in at the last minute.  They added a really nice bite of sweet.

Excellent recipe as is.  I normally tweak recipes, but this is really good as it stands.  The only thing I did differently is rinsed the beans instead of including the juice, and then added more chicken broth.  I doubled the recipe and it made a lot!  It doesn't have a ton of heat, so I added jalapeno slices on top for an extra kick.  My new go to chili recipe!

Fantastic.  Have made this many times and it never lets me down.  Makes a lot, but leftover are just as good, too.  Freezable as well.  Substituted the hominy for a cup of frozen corn, used only 1/2 tsp salt and added 1/4 tsp of allspice.  Didn't miss the salt one bit.

Excellent!  I made this with beef instead of turkey, used 2 cans of rotel tomatoes instead of the tomatoes and green chilis, and substituted one can of chili beans for the hominy.  SO good!

Really enjoyed this recipe.  I thought the squash would be a little strange in a chili but I was pleasantly surprised.  My non-squash eating husband liked it too!  I used a can of white beans and a can of black beans in place of the kidney -- didn't have any on hand.  Also, used vegetable broth in place of chicken - again, that is what I had in the pantry.  Will absolutely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was very, very good.  I served it at a football gathering as a healthier alternative to the regular chili - those who chose it, loved it!  I made a couple small tweeks to make it more picky teen friendly -  After the browning of the turkey,  I added just the spices (including the addition of  1/2 T  allspice) and simmered for maybe 5-10 minutes, this made the turkey meat look like ground beef.   I also chopped the butternut into more like 1/2 - 3/4 inch chunks.   Very good!

This recipe is a winner as it is.  All the original recipe was followed to the letter.  In addition, however, I added two (2) medium ORANGE tomatoes, medium dice, 12 oz. of CUBED turkey chunks (in addition to the ground already in the recipe), one (1) red bell pepper, medium diced, 1 TBS. brown sugar, 1 EXTRA TBS. of chili powder and lastly, I added some dry, ground ancho chile and cayenne powder to get a bit of heat - also some ground black pepper to taste.  AWESOME!!  The orange tomatoes and red bell pepper helped add that autumn / Halloween look with their colors as well as great flavor.  This made for some very, very good chili that was already gone in less than 2 days.  I am making another batch tonight - I love the hominy idea, so will likely add another can of that too.  You've got to try this recipe - you won't be sorry.

I was looking for a recipe to use my left over Butternut Squash (already made/store bought) soup from a month ago.  I did not add the tomato sauces as per people's suggestion and added extra onion, garlic, cumin and added 3 bell peppers.  It taste excellent.  I gave it 4 out of 4 stars, because I did not make the recipe as instructed.  Will make this again.  Thanks.  (Store bought soup, I mentioned above, is Pacific Organic http://www.pacificfoods.com/our-foods/creamy-soups/organic-creamy-butternut-squash-all-natural-soup)

WOW...lean meat and healthy fiber!! First time I printed and made this recipe was 2012 and made it I made it exactly as written and it was great.  Since then I've made it numerous times and THE ONLY changes I made was to use 3/4 tablespoon cumin, 3/4 tablespoon chili powder, and 3/4 tablespoon smoked chipotle powder.  Thank you CPolencheck for an amazing recipe using butternut squash :)

This turned out great! I had some leftover steak that was added. The flavor was amazing, but I might add some red pepper flakes next time to give it a little kick. We also followed other advice and topped it with shredded cheese, crumbled tortilla chips and sour cream.

This is great chilli!  I added a few things (of course).  Black beans and butter beans.  And I amped up the chilies a little bit.  I'm taking it to a tailgater and I'm sure it will be gone.  I think next time I'll add a habenero just for that delicious taste.  I really like this recipe.  It didn't get five stars because peeling the butternut squash is a pain-in-the-butternut.  So it took me longer than i expected to make it.  But, the taste makes it worth it.

It's a really good and simple recipe, I make a double batch and freeze it for later use. I find shredding Gruyere Cheese over the final product when serving adds a great nutty flavor.

Yumm! To up the spice level, I added smoked paprika, cayenne pepper and roasted the butternut squash first. Then, to balance that out, served with some fresh squeezed lime.

Quite tasty. Even my 8-yr old who does not like a lot said, "Yum!" Also very straightforward to make.  The only changes I'd make are adding a bit more broth to make it soupier (1 c total), a bit more meat, like 1.5# total, and a bit more spices, like adding 1 T of Ancho chili powder and a few dashes of Buffalo Tabasco Sauce.

I only changed a few things but this turned out seriously  amazing. Love the sweetness from the butternut squash. I don't think I can go back to normal chili after this. Changes I made were,  seasoning the meat with crushed garlic, garlic salt and cooked onions and a little bit of the chili and cumin. And a pinch of sage and nutmeg to make it more sausage-y. Then I added the remaining ingredients to a crock pot and cooked on high for 4 hours or so. Also I used hunts petite cut tomatoes but they  had a mild jalapeño flavor that I've never seen before and it really made a nice addition to this. I didn't have hominy either so I sub-ed for white beans.

So good, will def make this again!!!

I made this recipe basically as written. I didn't have hominy (didn't even know what it was), so I used corn and I added a little more chicken broth...it came out delicious!  I thought the seasonings were perfect and the house smelled wonderful!  This recipe is great!  I have never cooked with butternut squash...I'm so glad I found this recipe.  I will make it again...and again...thanks for the wonderful recipe!  : )

I added 1 1/2 TBS of All Spice and 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I followed the other person's suggestion about throwing the squash in the oven and cutting the squash smaller. I wish I would have cooked it even longer because I let it simmer for 50 minutes and the squash still wasn't very soft.

Simple and delicious! Been wanting new recipes for butternut squash and this is great! Since I didn't have kidney beans and hominy in pantry I fortunately has a can of southwestern bean salad. It has black beans, corn, hominy, and kidney beans all in one can! Awesome. Highly recommend trying this super easy recipe.

Oh yeah, this is the good stuff! The only things I changed was using pinto beans instead of kidney, since I like them better; and I didn't have garlic salt so used a mix of regular salt and garlic powder. The hominy kind of makes it taste like cornmeal was added, which is a good thing, in my opinion. Delicious, hearty, and the perfect consistency that you can enjoy in a bowl with cheese and sour cream, and is also thick enough to use for nachos. (Plus is also healthier than the average chili!) Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome recipe! My hubbie doesn't like ground poultry or squash and he thought it was delicious, even my 17 month old enjoyed it! 
The only change I made was substituting cayenne pepper instead of the green chilies because I couldn't find it at the store. Other than that I followed the recipe bang on and wouldn't hesitate to make it exactly the same next time :)

I tried this as a base for mixing two recipes, so I had a few variations, but my family absolutely loved it: I used black beans instead of white, and pureed 1/2 of a butternut squash (as my hubby had questions about squash in chili -- he's not a squash fan.) I also added red and green peppers (cooked with the onion and garlic) half a bag of frozen corn, dried cilantro and a couple dried bay leaves, and 3 spring (green) onions. No tomato sauce or hominy. No salt at all (there's enough in the canned beans and tomatoes). Yes black and cayenne pepper, and in fact a little too much of it. That's where the puree came in handy. I'd only used half of the puree at first, but when I got heavy-handed on the pepper, I used the other half to calm the heat, and it worked beautifully. It was still spicy, but calm enough for my 6 year old to eat. As cooked, it was a little too soupy for my taste but paired with brown rice or quinoa, it made a very delicious and hardy meal. A very large pot did not last very long with only 3 people in the house. This is one of those dishes that tastes better the second day when all the spices come together. Also, because it is great topped with sour cream or avocado (more heat reducers) you can make it as spicy as you wish, and let individuals add toppings to suit their heat sensitivities. Served with cornbread, this dish was golden.

I doubled everything except the squash, chilies and diced tomatoes (I only had one can). I also used pinto beans instead of hominy.  I added some cilantro as well. It came out great - even my kids ate it (including the squash which they thought were potatoes!)

Wow, delicioius.  Left out hominy and added chopped bell pepper.  But neither were responsible for the fabulous taste.  Thanks for sharing.

My toddlers love this recipe and so do I. I add more beans and play with the spices to to make it fit for their more sensitive palates. The only other change I make is to bake 1 medium sized butternut squash first then take the peel off and mix it in. Once baked, the squash blends seamlessly into the chili and makes it thick and hearty.

This chili is amazing! I used my crock pot and cooked the chili for about 8 hrs on high. The only change I made was to cut the squash smaller to cook faster. This is a new favorite at our house.

Add brown sugar!!! This recipe was delicious with some tweaking.  After reading many other reviews I did increase chicken stock to 3/4 cup, added tomato paste instead of sauce, and also included approx 1 tsp of red pepper flakes, and all spice.  I also added closer to 2 tsp of garlic salt & just a dash of cayenne pepper (I like spicy food).  When the chili was ready I was a bit dissapointed.  I could see how others said the flavors didn't really "mesh."  Then I realized it needs a bit of sugar to cut all of that acid.  I added about 1/4 cup dark brown sugar and it made all the difference...seriously!!!  So yummy!!  My fiance doesn't like butternut squash at all, and he never eats leftovers.  He ate it on Sunday & Monday nights, and raved with every bite. Thanks for the great recipe!

this is a good base chili recipe. the butternut squash makes it extra special! and the turkey helps to reduce some of the fat. i used fire roasted tomatoes, omitted the hominy and replaced it with chickpeas. i've also added black beans and corn. still awesome!

I was very hesitant to add squash to chili, but i went for it (Acorn instead of Butternut).  I forked the outside of the squash and baked for 15 mins at 400F before peeling and adding to pot.  I replace the diced tomatoes & tomatoe sauce with 2 (10oz) cans of Spicy Rotel and a small can of tomato paste and 1 cup of broth. The recipe started out pretty bland, but was improved with  additionalchili powder (total: 2 tblsp Chimayo Red + 2 tsp Pasilla)

I usually don't like to substitute turkey for ground beef but I really liked this!  The only changes I made were based on some of the reviews I read.  I added 1 can of tomato paste instead of the tomato sauce and I cut back on the cumin.   Some reviews said it it did not thicken but I thought mine came out thick which may have been because of the tomato paste.  Thanks for the great recipe.

I was wondering if anyone took a short cut and used a can of Hormel Turkey Chili and added it after cooking the squash and adding any other veggies.  Hormel Turkey Chili has a lot of flavor and you can save time by not having to chop all the other stuff and by not having to cook the turkey meat.

This is a great autumn chili!  Like most chilis I think it gets better the next day.  The squash was a new and exciting addition to chili, and is very welcome.  I added a dash of salt and pepper and a 1/2 teaspoon of oregano for my own personal tastes.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

OK, in whose universe does cubed butternut squash become tender over medium low heat for 20 minutes?  My soup has been cooking for over 35 minutes, turned up, and the squash is still not tender (but I have some nice burned stuff on the bottom of my pan).  Will add to review to see if it tastes good, but cooking directions are not good

I would give this a 10 if I could!! I have made this for years and always receive compliments. (It's a lifer in our rotation!) I always follow the (very easy) recipe to a T; no need for any changes in my opinion. I've served it alone, with shredded cheddar cheese and sour cream, and oyster crackers. My family and I have served this many times at a men's trasitional housing facility and the guys LOVED it! Don't be afraid of the squash (as I was), even if it is not your favorite! A nice glass of dry red wine pairs really well with it :) 
Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this last night for tonight’s dinner.  It’s very tasty!  Easy to put together.  The squash gives another great texture.  Only thing I didn’t use was the garlic salt because I didn’t have it but I did use about a 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt

I added red pepper flakes (to taste) to increase the heat but the whole dish needs a little something. It’s lacking in flavor but nothing that can’t be fixed with additional seasoning.

The hominy adds a nice texture. It thickens the tomato base nicely.   I split the chili powder with 2/3 regular chili powder and 1/3 chipotle chili powder to add some smokiness.

I made this and tweaked it based off others reviews. I used a bay leaf, 1/2 T of cumin, added cinnamon and allspice to taste. Same with the chili powder. Used garlic powder instead of garlic salt. Substituted corn for hominy. Uses 1 cup of chicken stock. Drained corn, did not drain kidney beans. All and all came out pretty good once I added the cinnamon and a little salt.

It’s very different from my usual chili which was a nice change! We liked the hominy and thought it was good!

I loved it!  I leave out the hot-spices in recipes because it doesn't like me, but it is great without them.  My husband didn't like the cubes of butternut squash in it, but I did!  So, I just didn't serve pieces of it to him.  =)  I also found that the ground turkey was tough, and maybe that's because of the brand and not all turkey is that way, but I will probably stick to using 3% fat ground beef.  I also make my chili with a can of every kind of legume I can find... black beans, great white northerns, white navy, navy, black-eyed peas, etc.  It makes a whole lot, and freezes well.  But the greater the variety of beans you use, the healthier it is for you.

So yummy! I was a bit worried about adding squash to chili but it was delicious!! I doubled the seasonings, just didn’t thInk that was going to be enough.  I will definitely be making it again.

It came out delicious and just right amount of chili flavor.  I used my own garden tomato with canned one.

Very flavorful yet mild on heat. Easy, healthy and filling. I replaced the hominy with an extra can of kidney beans. The cubed squash found in many grocery stores cuts down on prep time.

This was quite tasty. I liked the balance of sweet and spicy. Made it in the crockpot with a few tweaks as suggested by other reviewers. Used corn in place of the hominy. Added oregano, a little cayenne, black pepper, allspice and garlic powder. Omitted the salt and used low sodium broth, about a cup and half since I drained the beans. It made quite a lot! It was a little thin, so I think maybe using tomato paste instead of sauce like some folks suggested would be a good idea. I will add this one to my chili collection. Thank you for the great recipe!

I baked the butternut squash in the oven first with olive oil and garlic; recipe on this site.  Then used crock pot instead; doesn't need to be long.  Omitted the hominy.  Husband said it should be entered in a chili contest!

This is currently cooking via instant pot! I was wondering what qualifies for a “serving”? Most chilis are one cup. Is this as well?

Very healthy until you add a little bit of cheese and sour cream! Delicious on its own, I added some fresh cilantro leaves to top at the end.

Delicious! I'd never cooked with butternut squash or hominy before, and they both tasted great in this chili. I followed the recipe except I left out the chicken broth because I don't like to use a partial can. I also added a little extra garlic and cumin. I do recommend microwaving or baking the squash a bit beforehand to soften it up. I microwaved half of mine with a little water for 3-4 mins. I used fire-roasted tomatoes for the diced tomatoes and they worked nicely! I included the liquid of all of the canned items except for the hominy. Will definitely make again!

This is AMAZING!! So good and only 1 WW point!! 
Only change was to add allspice as one reviewer suggested! So good on a cold evening! 
Thanks for such a great, easy recipe!
EDIT: This is still one of my favorite recipes! It freezes well in individual servings so I can make a big pot and eat on it many times!

Very good.  A little hot so I added sour cream when I served it. Also added double the chicken broth to extend the quantity.  I’ll definitely make again.  My family all found it "really good,” but they’ve ruled some of my other soups “great."

Wish it was spicier. I added some green peppers and corn to make it a more "authentic" chili. I should've added a jalapeno. I will definitely add some hot sauce when eating it this week. It was very, very easy to make

This chili is so delicious and the butternut squash makes it refreshing! The only changes I made was that  I only added 1 can of tomato sauce and didn't add all the butternut squash. This chili was pretty simple to make and it makes great leftovers as well. I totally recommend making this!

My family loved it! And I did too...I'm all about the easy for meals.  This was simple & delish.  I was so surprised with my family as they are usually "traditional chili"  eaters and critical of  my  alternative "healthy changes".  Not with this one.  When my 13 year old asked for 2nds...I had to do a double take.  Perfect for a fall/winter day.

This was just what I was looking for to use ground Venison!  I made it  using a can of organic corn rather than hominy and white beans cannolini because that’s what I had on hand.  My family loved this one and I’m sharing with others who love an alternative to beef chili.  I’ll try it with turkey as well because the butternut squash and onions are such a great combination.  Thanks for sharing this one!

So delicious. My husband and kids  won't stop eating it. Next time I might add one extra can of kidney beans.

This recipe was good, but it wasn’t excellent. It tasted like it was missing something. There wasn’t enough heat in there to render a good hearty chili, in my opinion.  I do plan on making it again, but possibly tweaking it while still trying to maintain a relatively healthy recipe. This is what I want to try:  I’m going to brown the turkey and drain any fat and set it to the side. Then I’m going to sauté the onion and garlic until the onion begins to turn clear and instead of using an 8 oz can of tomato sauce, I’m going to add a couple good heaping tablespoons of tomato paste and mix it into the onion until it’s coated. For extra heat, I’m going to add in a teaspoon and a half of crushed red pepper. The turkey can then go back in and I do plan to drain the can of kidney beans and give them a little rinse before putting them in along with all the other ingredients. For extra liquid, since I plan to substitute the tomato sauce for tomato paste and drain the beans, I’ll add in a 12 oz beer — probably an IPA for the citrus flavor. Also, a teaspoon or more of paprika.

Waaaaay too much cumin as written—-burned my nostrils as it was simmering. Chili powder quantity is fine, keep cumin to a pinch. Added cinnamon. Will add a pinch of cloves next time too. Preschoolers liked it, will make it again with spice adjustments.

I was surprised I liked this so much, but it turned out great! I copied some other suggestions and roasted the squash for 15 min before adding it. I also cut down the cumin and added a touch of all spice. Replaced one can of tomatoes with one of beans. Definitely will be making it again.

Very hearty and a good way to incorporate sweet potatoes into the diet. Had to add more chili powder, tomatoes, and tomato sauce. Plus, added herbs like oregano for more flavor.

I've never added a review before, but after making this chili exactly as the recipe says I was so happy with the results that I had to add my review.  This chili was healthy, colorful and delicious.  I only changed the amount of chili powder because my husband suffers from Crohn's.  I will definitely be making it again.

In love! Read reviews and added all spice, subbed tomato paste for one can of tomatoes and tomato sauce. Used rotel for the other can of diced tomatoes and chilis. Added a can of chick peas just because & then used two pounds of chicken breasts because that’s what we had. My pregnant belly is happy and full of protein and other goodies!

This is definitely a tasty way to enjoy butternut squash. I went with the numerous recommendations and added the extra half cup of broth, diced the squash smaller, added a few bay leaves, 1 additional clove of garlic and I added Allspice although I did not see any measurements to how much ppl were adding, so I got adventerous and added a tablespoon. I like it. however, i definitely drained the beans prior to adding them to the pot. this is an easy one pot meal. will make again.

This turned out really well. I saw the suggestion of one cup of broth and went with that as well as a little all spice. When I cook with ground turkey I almost always use cayenne pepper, so about a tablespoon of that went into this recipe,as well as a little bit of cinnamon.

This is DELICIOUS!!! I may have only added more garlic and onions ( because I LOVE garlic and onions), but otherwise I made it exactly. It really is a great recipe and I'm sure it's quite nutritious . I highly recommend trying it.

I loved this recipe, so did my two preschool boys and husband! I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth and a can of corn with jalapeños instead of hominy because that is what I had on hand. I added some paprika, turmeric and cinnamon to the chili for some added health benefits and to add to the yummy depth of flavors! The cinnamon really added a subtle sweetness to it against the spicy other flavors. Add to taste, too much cinnamon could be overpowering.

I fixed this as is with one substitution- sweet potatoes for butternut squash.  It was superb. I could not stop eating this chili. My husband raved about it too. A wonderful dish that uses lowfat turkey instead of beef.

I roasted the butternut squash beforehand with red, orange, and yellow peppers, olive oil, kosher salt, pepper, and garlic, and also added black beans to the recipe.  This was one of the best dishes that I've cooked!!!

I loved this recipe.  I boiled the butternut until soft until soft in another pot and then roasted it for a while under the grill.  If found the roasted butternut less watery.  I also left out the turkey.  I will definitely make this again!

I can't believe how tasty and simple this is. I didn't have Tom sauce so substituted one two cans fire roasted diced tomatoes -one can of tomatoes had med grn chilis added so I didn't add anymore chilis to the mix so it could remain kid friendly. I also didn't have hominy. Was absolutely delicious, quick, and healthy. Family loved it.

I made this recipe because I had a butternut squash to use and wanted to try a different way to fix it.  Although I cut the squash in far smaller pieces than 1", they took at least an hour to soften.   I ultimately added more liquid to the recipe.  Although the flavor was OK, I did not feel it was spectacular.  If I make this recipe again, I will probably try to tweak it a bit.

After browning in the pan, put this in the slow cooker for 10 hours--delicious.  Family raved about it.  After about 8 cooking hours, I mashed the squash into the mixer, leaving it chunky but this helped blend the flavors.  We'll be making this again--easy to prepare in advance.  Great on a snowy day, topped with plain yogurt and grated Monterey Jack cheese.

Delicious and filling but the squash needs to be cut into much smaller pieces to cook in the time stated in the recipe.  I substituted white corn for the hominy.

I made this recipe with only one variation: using ground chuck instead of ground turkey; my wife and I don't feel that ground turkey is inherently "healthier" than ground beef. Other than that, I followed it to the letter. We like this variation on chili very much! The squash adds a very nice, almost "sweet" dimension to the normal chili flavor. We will make this again, it's a keeper.

This is pretty good as is, definitely chop the butternut squash smaller.  Bring this recipe UP to FIVE STARS by adding a couple of canned chipotle peppers in adobo sauce. You only need two or three, depending on how spicy you want it. Chop them fine and scrape them into the pot for a smokey sweet flavor that pairs  really well with the squash. I also add a few shakes of allspice, as someone else suggested. Store leftover peppers in a glass jar on the fridge, they will stain your tupperware. I will never make another taco soup or chili of this sort without adding them.

Delicious and healthy, and if it wasn't for the squash, it would have been done in a flash. Next time I'll buy frozen squash to solve that!

I made it exactly as written except I had to use corn instead of hominy. I just don't keep hominy in the pantry. One thing: I halved the recipe because we are two and the recipe is supposed to serve 12. No way! Half of the recipe serves two not-big-eaters with less than 1/2 cup of leftovers which we will have as an appetizer with tortilla chips. I am an experienced cook so I should have known better, but obviously I wasn't thinking. I can't imagine the whole recipe serving 12, more like 4-5; must be a typo. We will absolutely make this again. It will be worth buying hominy to try it as written. Thanks for a delicious take on chili!

This was so good!! Spices were just right. I had no idea what to do with my squash. This was perfect. Only thing I changed was I used corn instead of hominy.

Incredible autumn chili! I originally made as recipe states, then tasted.... it was good but just missing something. Read reviews and took a few pointers. I added a little allspice, cilantro and oregano, I threw in a couple bay leaves in a the last 10 min. VIOLA! Perfection! My whole family enjoyed seconds.

This chili was awesome! Honestly, my hopes were not that high because it's healthy and has some ingredients you would not think would go together, but this recipe far exceeded my expectations. I just changed to 1 cup broth (based on previous suggestions in other reviews), but everything else was the same. I will DEFINITELY make this again because it was really easy, delicious, and not horrible for me.

I made this but used Rotel tomatoes with chilies instead of the canned chilies and canned tomatoes.  I also used Bush's Chili Beans.  I don't care for hominy so I substituted a can of corn.  Loved it.

I loved this recipe. I put it in my crockpot and scooped its deliciousness into our bowls, and served it with crusty bread. I love black beans so I added those as well. I always use dry beans and soak them instead of the canned ones. I make everything from scratch, no boxes or cans for me. I will definitely make this again

Absolutely delicious!  I did not have any hominy but don't like it much anyway, so wouldn't use that.  I used 1 can of diced tomato and 1 can of Rotel.  Still used the can of green chilies too.  I was out of tomato sauce, so I used tomato soup, and that worked really well.  I love the sweet taste from the butternut squash along with the spicy chili flavors.  Also, I made this in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours.

This recipe in theory is pretty good.  I followed the advice and used a tsp of  allspice and cut the butternut squash into smaller 1/2" pieces,  replaced the kidney beans with black beans and used my slow cooker on low for 8 hours.  There was not enough chili powder in this recipe, though.  I would at least double the amount next time.  I would make this again, I loved all the healthy ingredients.

Great turkey chili! I added a can of white chili beans, stewed tomatoes, 1 Tbl oregeno, 5 leaves of chopped collared greens, celery, peppers, and some cayenne pepper and a pinch of red pepper flakes. It was very tasty and had a great vegetable, earthy flavor.

Made this the first time with corn instead of hominy, the second time I made it with hominy; I think I may continue to make it with corn because it adds a bit more flavor that my husband and family absolutely loves! Definitely a hearty, filling chili that is perfect for an overcast day. Printed it out and added it to my recipe binder for future dinners. :)

Pretty easy to make!! I followed the advice from other reviews and precooked the squash in the microwave.  I had to substitute frozen veggies for the beans as I found out that I didn't have any left.  I also omitted the hominy because I don't like it and didn't have any on hand.

This wasn't perfect but it was really nice. I definitely recommend peeling the butternut squash. 110. It's also very nice  with ground beef (as opposed to ground turkey). Top it off with cilantro (coriander) also very good with Greek yogurt or sour cream. It is very nice with some homemade French fries (chips).

I followed some of the other reviews and used a can of tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, a can of chili-ready tomatoes instead of 1 of the cans of petite diced tomatoes, added a pinch of oregano, a pinch of allspice  and a little extra garlic.  It was wonderful and it's hard to believe its so many fewer calories than traditional ground beef chili! Tastes very similar and my children loved it! I love the additional vitamins and nutrients!

This recipe is so Very Good!  I made a few changes.(only because I did not have what the recipe called for)  I used 2 Tablespoons of Dried Onions instead of Fresh. I used Corn instead of Hominy.  I also put it in my Crock Pot instead of on  the Stove on High for 2 and Low for 4.  Delish!

This is a great chili!  I have used turkey as the recipe states, but also venison instead of turkey.  I usually use 1 can of original Ro-Tel tomatoes with 1 can of plain diced tomatoes, and usually use the larger (7oz) can of diced green chiles.  I always use 3 cloves of garlic, instead of 2.  People who don't think they will enjoy this have raved about how tasty it is, and come back for seconds!

My entire family loved it! I did increased the cumin, chili powder, and added oregano. I used corn instead of hominy, and added additional salt (about a teaspoon). We garnished with tortilla chips, sour cream, cilantro and goat cheese - it was delicious!!

This was delish! I doubled the recipe and used exact ingredients. 

Couple of changes : I used one red and one white onion and did all the browning in a huge cast iron skillet.  As I was browning onions, I split the squash in half and broiled it skin side up in oven. Once the skin started to bubble I took it out and was able to easily peel the skin off. I began dicing the squash right after that and throwing it in with the turkey/onion and let it cook in there for a while to soften up the squash.

Meanwhile, I put all other ingredients in soup pan to heat and mingle. Two of the four cans were rotel diced tomatoes with chilis and then I added one small can of diced chilis. It wasn't overpowering. I have 3 kids, 10  to 3 years in age and they all went back for seconds!

Note: I did follow one other commenters direction and added some allspice. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely delish chili with slight modifications. I omitted the hominy as I didn't want the extra starch and calories.  Added 1Tbls crushed corriander,  about 1t of cinnamon and some dashes of cayenne. Need some kick to offset the sweetness of the squash. I used a slow cooker on low for 3 hours and added squash in the last 15 min.  Better to keep the squash a little firm, particularly if re-heating for additional meals. Served with fresh chopped cilantro and a squeeze of lime. A bit of shredded cheese and sour cream if not totally calorie counting brings it to a whole new level. I would amp up the cumin and chili powder next time to better balance the sweetness of the squash.

I just used what I had in my cabinets rather than running out and buying exactly what was listed. And i used our leftover thanksgiving turkey (cut into small chunks). I never have any spices so I literally added chili powder... That's it! Will definitely make this again!

Fabulous!  I  roasted the butternut squash for 20 mins at 400 degrees, then pureed half of it so there were chunks in the soup but also a thick consistency to the chili.  Used 1 can black beans, 1 can kidney beans.  Also used frozen corn instead of hominy.

Just the simple chili recipe I was looking for. I only used half the cumin and used cans of Rotel tomatoes with green chilies. It came out pretty spicy, but darn tasty!

I like my chili spicy- lots of kick. I made this exactly as indicated with 1/2 tsp of allspice. Otherwise, I made it the same. It wasn't flavorful enough for me. But, then I said 'NEED TO GET THIS UP TO PAR!!! TIME TO TURN ON THE HEAT!!!" and added 1/4 cup of crushed chili pepper sauce  ---- and oh, that was a big mistake because its too hot now!!! I should have just tested it two or three times and added the pepper sauce gradually! anyway, as a seasoned chef I screwed up - and I'm sure this is very good after sitting a day (from the sweetness of the butternut squash). I suggest pre-steaming the squash so it is almost ready to eat after the ground meat is done.
It makes a very nice presentation with crusty bread.

Pretty good...I have never cooked with butternut squash before so was a bit apprehensive.  Based on how hard it was I could tell squash was going to need to cook longer than recipe called for.  Actually browned the meat in skillet and then threw everything in the slow cooker on low for a few hours.

A yummy new twist on traditional chilli!!! I didn't measure out the seasoning, just went with my preference. I pretty much stuck to the recipe except like others suggested, I added allspice and cinnamon but left out the chicken broth because there was enough liquid in my pot already from the diced tomatoes and beans. Its quick, easy, healthy and most importantly, it's delicious!!

YUM! Used a partial packet of chili seasoning, corn instead of hominy, didn't skin the squash (lazy) and it's great! Oh, and 1/3 Coors beer for added flavor.

This recipe is great and can be tweeked in so many different ways depending on what you have on hand. I used tomato paste instead of tomato sauce, extra chicken broth, extra garlic, added all spice, garbanzo beans and black beans instead of kidney and hominy and let it simmer for at least 40 minutes. Oh my, it was phenomenal. I took the advice of last reviewers and tweeked the recipe to my liking. Also, the person who said to pierce and heat the entire butternut squash in the over at 400 for about 15 mins beforehand in order to make it easier to skin is a genius! I HATE skinning squash, but this made it manageable.

Couldn't wait for a cool fall day.  It smells and tastes delightful.  I made couple tweaks like some of the other testers.  I increased the broth to 1-1/4 cups.  I added a Tbsp. of tomato paste to increase the richness as well as half a beef bouillon cube.  I had ro-tel tomatoes on hand so did not add increased amount of green chiles.  I used chili beans ( pinto) in place of kidney.
Small, but subtle, changes just to increase the flavors.  Think I'll turn the a/c down low later and pretend it's fall in South Florida.  ;)

Excellent dish!! Instead of using butternut squash, I used chayote instead. I didn't use regular squash because I didn't want everything too mushy. The chayote is just right!! I also used ground turkey instead of ground turkey breast and it still cane out amazing (; I have a cold so this dish was much needed!

I wasn't sure how we'd like this chili, but it was delicious! I did make a few changes: I drained the beans and didn't add the liquid, but I added more chicken broth, instead. I didn't add hominy, but used chick peas. Corn would have been good, too, I think.
My hubby loved the spice; I would cut it back a bit.
Perfect meal for a sub-zero day.

I had a leftover butternut squash and wanted to try something other than b-nut Squash soup. This chili hit the spot on a snowy day. I'll be doing this one again!

I've made this several times, once using the original recipe exactly and two or three other times with slight variations. In short, it's delicious and satisfying, and holds up well for slight intentional (and unintentional) variations. For one version, I used great Northern beans and/or white kidney beans in place of the regular kidneys. I've also substituted fresh tomatoes in place of the canned diced on one occasion, and included New Mexico green chile in addition to the red chili powder. All variations have worked well! Turkey and butternut squash were made to be together.

Very good chili but I did make a significant change, substituted ground venison for the turkey.  Used home canned tomatoes, tomato juice, and tomato sauce. Corn instead of hominy. 1 beef bullion cube.

Really good recipe!! I added 2 bay leaves, oregano, turmeric, allspice, corn and zucchini. I also used tomato paste instead of sauce. We like it thicker! My whole family loved it!

This was a great fall soup. Hearty and a delicious blend. I used way more broth than recommended and added a little Italian seasoning. I cooked my soup in my crock pot on high for 6 hrs (cooked squash enough to cube up and throw in crock) and it turned out great. I was skeptical about the recipe due to the ingredients, but it turned out great. Wonderful use for butternut squash.

Love love love this!! I added much more garlic, and upped the amounts of the spices. Those were my only changes. I wish I had thought to put the squash in the oven before I began cutting though. I always seem to forget how hard winter squash is. Other than that, this recipe is a keeper!

I'm appreciating butternut squash for the first time, thanks to this recipe.  Before this, my attitude was always, "it's squash season. Sigh."  Now, we are all excited about squash in our family, even my seven-year-old.

I made this chili for a Halloween potluck. It was really yummy. I didnt include the ground turkey, for a veggie colleague.  I left out the green chilies(didn't have them) and substituted garlic powder for the garlic cloves. I did add a little allspice and two peppers from my garden. MMMM....

I think next time I will do it in the crockpot, I let it simmer for more than 30 minutes and the butternut squash was still too firm. Oh and I have no idea what white hominy is so we didnt use it, I added garbonzo beans though. Also apparently when making my grocery list I over looked the can of tomato sauce but Im glad I did because I think it would have been too runny. Other than that it was good.

This recipe was delicious quite possibly the best we have ever eaten. I used 2 cans of canned chicken I drained one instead of using turkey or adding other broth. I also had to use corn instead of hominy. I didn't use an onion but I used onion soup mix instead. The squash I used was left over from the roasted butternut squash recipe also on All Recipes. My canned diced tomatoes had rosemary and oregano in them and my sauce had green chilies in it. Next time I will not use garlic salt but will probably use garlic powder instead because my version was a bit salty, but I also had salt and pepper on the butternut squash already plus the soup mix added saltiness. I didn't add any more green chilies. My son and I are dieting and a 10th of this (252 grams) figures out to be around 218 calories made the way I did it. It was sooo yummy and tasty for "diet" food.

Great way to use our freshly harvested butternut squash. I served with sour cream. I could see adding  a cup of cooked small shell pasta to the mix to give it a bit more body. Nice Fall dish.

I thought this chili was okay, but I liked it more the next day once it thickened. I even added another can of diced tomatoes to it the next day. However, what I didn't care for was the butternut squash in it. I found it to be too sweet. The texture of the pieces varies between cooked just right to too mushy. I would not add this vegetable to chili again. The green chilis were also kind of hot the first day, but mellowed out in flavor over-night. It was good with some cheese on top for lunch.

I really loved this chili! I thought it sounded odd to put squash in chili but the sweetness from the squash really combined well with the spice.  I had two small butternut squash that I grew in my garden that I used.  I had never tried hominy before and thought it added some nice flavor. A delicious and also very healthy chili that I would make again!

This was great! So good, the company loved it, and my 2 picky toddlers loved it. I can't handle hot or even medium hot taste, so I reduced the chilli powder by 1/3 the amount and reduced the chopped green chilies by 1/2. It was very mild, I'll use the whole amount of chopped green chilies next time. I also could not purchase canned hominy, so I substituted the same amount of frozen yellow corn in its place. Served it with a side of nachos for scooping, sprinkled with low-fat shredded cheddar cheese and non-fat plain greek style yogurt. Loved it! Will make again.

I didn't change anything about this recipe. I love the combination of ingredients and how filling it is. It's my fiance's favorite dish and he asks me to make it all the time. Goes great with whole grain tortilla chips and a little sour cream on top.

I make this chili about once a month.  I love it.  I don't add the beans or the hominy and just add a little celery salt to add the little bit more seasoning it needs.  It's a great recipe!

A good basic chili, but you can't even taste the butternut squash.  Big waste of a delicious squash.  I would recommend just adding a second can of beans for filler.  You'll save a lot of time.

Added a can of black beans in addition to the kidney beans.  More garlic, doubled the chili powder, and added 2 Tsp. chipotle powder.  Used a can of jalapenos instead of green chilis for more heat.  Used a can of corn instead of hominy. Served with jalapeno corn bread.

Healthy when made with ground turkey, but I think it would be REALLY tasty with ground beef.  :)

Delicious! I substituted frozen corn for the hominy and fresh green bell pepper for the canned green chilis. I also used veggie broth instead of chicken broth because I had it on hand. I had frozen chunks of butternut squash from another recipe, so it took a bit longer to cook. The recipe turned out great and I will be making it again.

The flavor of this soup is amazing. It is similar to the chili I make with my own tomato salsa. The last chili I made was with the Chili Seasoning Mix I and it was very bland. It must be the cumin the makes the taste so chili-like. I will definitely do this chili again.

Yowza! This was fabulous! The major change I made was to throw everything into a crock pot and let it simmer all day on high. Also, I did cut the squash into smaller cubes than the recipe called for. Skipped the garlic salt as A) hubby needs to watch his salt intake, and B) since there is already fresh garlic in the recipe, garlic salt seemed redundant. Will definitely make this again, and may try adding a second can of beans.

I love this recipe!  I have been looking for something to use my home canned butternut squash in besides another sweet soup and this was excellent.  Good flavor, very filling with the hominy and beans.  The only change I made was I used black beans and drained them - otherwise, I made it as published.  I served it with a little grated cheese on top.

I make this chili and think it is fantastic.  It has a great bright flavor just as it is.  I sometimes use corn instead of hominy and  I like the lighter taste of that.

OMG! This might be the best chili I have ever eaten! I'm not sure I would call it chili but whatever you call it it is wonderful!
I made a very few changes per readers suggestions by using allspice(which I must say really adds a lovely flavor to this dish!), I also used a can of pureed sweet potatoes as a thickener & I used canned tomatoes with chilies in it, I also caramelized some of the squash just because I thought it would be yummy  - other than that I followed the directions as written.
I will be serving this to company tomorrow evening .... hope they love it as much as I do!

Great recipe!  thanks for sharing.  I read all the reviews before actually cooking & decided that concensus was to add 'more flavour through spices'  When buying the diced toamtoes, I chose to use Alymer's flavours (ie: garlic & olive oil OR Roasted red peppers, etc) I took the advice of using a tomato paste instead of the sauce.... which was a great suggestion for added thickness....in fact I used an herb infused tomato paste!  For me, you can never have enough garlic...I added some extra garlic also (can use roasted for a more robust flavour also!)  to perfect this the next time I make it, I will be adding 2 lbs of ground turkey, instead of only 1  ENJOY!!  OHHHH I also added yellow Zucchini ....so this recipe is a great spot for extra veggies in fridge that need to be used :)

I made it with acorn squash instead of butternut, black beans instead of kidney, a few large sprigs of rosemary, and added the allspice. I definitely second the allspice idea, and would personally add more squash next time. Wonderfully non-traditional chili!

I tried my darndest to actually follow the recipe on this one, but some substitutions ended up being necessary.  Nothing too detrimental, I think:  I used yellow hominy instead of white (I've never had white and neither has my store; yellow was fine) and pureed squash (also an availability issue).  I think the recipe would probably be better as originally written, with chunks of squash, but the puree worked in a pinch.  I used the full amount of all spices and found the seasoning right on, although I did add a pinch of salt to the turkey as it cooked.  I do think the chili could have been a little thicker, and might try cooking it uncovered for part of the time on the next go-round; I also think it could have been a bit spicier, but that's a personal preference issue.  Next time, I'll probably substitue jalapenos for the green chili.  All in all, good, easy and healthy - thanks for the recipe!

Loved, loved, loved it! To fit it to what I had on hand I did 1 c. beef broth instead of the chicken, 1 qt. home-canned tomatoes instead of the 2 cans, and abt. 1/2 c. frozen white corn instead of hominy. I also used 1/2 a red pepper, small diced and sauteed it with the onion/garlic. I think it gave it a sweet flavor. Also only added 2 tsp. cumin so it wasn't too overpowering for the kids...it was perfect.  I loved the butternut squash--it made it look beautiful and added extra nutrition. I didn't weigh my squash (I just have LOTS from my garden) but decided a half of a medium-size one was plenty. This is our preferred chili recipe now...Thanks!

This was really good!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe and it came out great.  The butternut squash adds a bit of sweetness to the chili, so no sugar is necessary unless you like sweet chili.  We ate this as a meal with homemade tortilla chips and I would say it serves about 6 servings.  Very hearty and healthy!

I made this with the addition of the allspice and using tomato paste instead of tomato sauce. I used black beans instead of kidney beans and omitted the hominy. I loved it! My husband was not at all fond of the squash, though, so I took it out the next go around. Now he tells me he'll give me whatever I want if I make it for him! Maybe I can include the squash one time and just tell him to pick it out of his...

YUMMY!!!!! all my kids loved this!!  Chopped the butternut squash into small pieces so my kids wouldn't know it was in there, used 1 cup of chicken broth instead of 1/2 c. and no tomatoes.  When I was making a dinner list for this week my son asked to have this chili w/ the chips!! So cool- he actually asked for this chili!

Deeeelicious! I had never made chili before and this was a great recipe for a first timer.  Easy to make and delicious to eat.  I ended up swapping out a few ingredients to accomodate what I did and didn't have in the fridge: Nixed the hominy and used 1 green bell peper instead Used a fresh serrano pepper instead of canned chilis Lots of Cayenne and no Cumin Drained the kidney beans a bit to keep the chili nice and thick I didn't have a butternut squash so I used an acorn squash instead Used fire roasted canned diced tomatoes to give it a smokier flavor  Loved it!  This recipe makes a ton of chili though, so I'd cut it in half if there are only 2 or 3 of you eating dinner.

This chili was very refreshing to have included the turkey and squash. I let it cook in the crock pot for a few hours instead of making it quickly on the stove. Either way it makes an amazing dish!!

Easy, healthy, and hearty! Ignore where it says it serves 12, though.  I think this, along with some crusty bread or some sweet cornbread, would have served 4 perfectly.

This was great chili.  I'm not a huge chili fan and neither is my youngest son, but this went over great.  The only thing I did different was add 2 cups of water instead of the 1/2 cup (totally by accident, but worked out good).  Everyone in the house loved it and wants me to make it more often!  Great Job.

My husband was skeptical, but he enjoyed it and ate two bowls!  I don't know my squashes and bought acorn squash instead of butternut.  One lb was half an acorn squash.  I chopped it a little smaller than 1 inch and am glad I did as the squash didn't cook down as much as I expected.  Forgot to buy hominy.  I've never used it & the chili was great without, so think I'll skip it in the future.  The only other changes were a third clove of garlic and a tsp of salt instead of garlic salt.  Also, I used a can of tomato paste instead of sauce, drained the beans, and upped the chicken broth to 1 cup.  Be sure to add the whole Tbsp of cumin and cook at least a half hour for the flavors to meld and the squash to cook completely.  The squash and seasonings meld to make a slightly sweet, savory flavor.  Excellent and healthy. I'll make this again!

I really liked this recipe. It has a lot of depth and the surprising sweetness of bites of the squash are wonderful. My modifications were small- I added a handful each of frozen corn and spinach and used Lawry's seasoning salt instead of garlic salt. I nixed the chiles because I wasn't in the mood for spice. A dollop of plain greek yogurt at on top was perfect. Thanks for posting!

Delicious recipe. I thought it was very flavorful, and mild enough for my children to enjoy.  I did simmer higher and for longer than the recipe called for because it was a bit soupy and I like my chili thick.  Worked perfectly...Will definitelymake this a regular!

This is definitely the best chili recipe I've tried. Lots of flavor and healthy too. I followed the recipe to a tee and added some additional seasoning (garlic powder, seasoned salt). I made this with some cornbread and had a delicious dinner w/my boyfriend. You also get a ton of chili out of this--we're freezing a batch to save for a quick dinner later.

This was really great, I used 2 Jalapenos instead of green chillies because I like them, used tomato paste and the extra chicken broth.  Steamed the butternut by cutting in half laying in a 9X13 pan with a little water and cooking in micro for about 10 min, pierce the skins before cooking, scooping out that mixture and adding to the chili.  it was very good and even better the next day.  My daughter said she would of made it hotter, however she has a two year old and I was keeping her in my mind when making this. Very healthy and tasty.

This is a very mild chili, not what I expected.  Followed the recipe pretty closely. My first taste was that hominy, which I do like, was overwhelming in this case.  Tweaked liberally: doubled the chili powder, added two McCormick large beef bouillon cubes (turkey is mild), a good shot of lemon juice, a small tomato paste with water, and thus powered it up close to what I consider chili (personal preference). A hint: The butternut can be partially cooked in the microwave, then seeded and scooped out with a melon-ball cutter. Nice alternative. Canned chilies, expensive, can be replaced with about 1/2 of a pickled or fresh jalapeno.  Finally, the sour cream and tostados really made this a nice dish.

Easy to make and really good.  This recipe lends it self to many subsitutions depending on what you have at home.  I made a big pot and will take to work for lunch next week.

Excellent recipe - I agree with other reviewers that the chili could use more spice, so I added a bit more chili powder and garlic and extra tomato sauce, and served it topped with a mild green salsa and lite sour cream. Awesome and wonderful texture.

I made this once and followed the recipe almost exactly. The only annoying part was peeling the butternut squash. I was pretty slow at it. The chili turned out fantastic, though.

Amen! This was great and quick. I had to break down squash and hominy and cook it a little longer than the recipe but when it mixed together it was just special. Nice job! Cooking is all about taking chances and being creative.

This was a really good chili. I did make a few changes, but not too many. I left out the hominy (b/c I am not a fan) and I exchanged the kidney beans for black beans. For peppers, I used fresh Anaheim peppers. This was great fresh and even better the next day!

I think I was too excited based on the reviews. I was good, but not amazing.

I am not sure if my squash was ripe enough though- I have never cooked with squash

Very good - I used black beans instead of kidney, omitted the hominy, and added some more spice and it was a tasty autumn treat!
