I found this to be quite good without the 1/2 cup of olive oil or pasta. A great diet snack any time of the day with lots of chpped celery, green and red peppers, and red onions.

Really good recipe followed it to the letter and it turned out great.
My only suggestion would be if possible stir the dressing through and allow to stand until the dish is cold so that it marinates properly. Will cook it again for sure.

Made this as part of a Halloween dinner using whole little squids (firefly variety) and adding mesclun to the toss.  It wasn't quite as good as I thought it would be.  Will try again closer to the actual recipe.

I like the simplicity of this recipe - you can make it without having to run to the shops for hard-to-find ingredients. I made the mistake of boiling the squid with a red onion and it turned the calamari a naff colour. Still tastes great! Best served along other cold salads and starters... Capanata, crunchy bread, an interesting green salad, french bread, olive oil. I halved the oil in the recipe and it is still great.

Extraordinary! My wife loved it, also. I stopped short of making the vinaigrette, opting instead to serve it over arborio rice. Used dry sherry for 50% of the wine. Added garlic, shallots  & 1/4 C EVOO to simmering & used a single cube of Knorr shrimp bouillon rather than pure salt. Yes, these are significant changes, however it was so  tasty when I tasted the simmering broth, I wanted to preserve that flavor rather than introduce the lemon notes. Will make again!! Thanks for posting.
