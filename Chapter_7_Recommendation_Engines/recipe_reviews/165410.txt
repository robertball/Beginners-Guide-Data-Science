YUMMY!! Has a great flavor and very easy to make. I did not use the bacon and instead used EEVO to stir fry the veggies in. I also omitted the artichoke hearts simply because I did not have them on hand. Even without those items it was still very good. My husband really enjoyed it!

Very interesting mixture of veggies but needed more flavor. I thickened the watery juices in the bottom of the pan with some cornstarch but it really needed something more

I needed a good text for all the leftover veggies I had from my veggie tray for the 4th of July BBQ. I didn t have all the veggies that were called for but had most. Only missing the artichokes and mushrooms. It was still very delicious even without those. I served it with some pastina which seemed to compliment it well. Thanks for the recipe.
