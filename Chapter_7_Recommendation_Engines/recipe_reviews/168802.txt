These were really time consuming and they didn't even taste that good. The filling was really granulated and the cookie part wasn't sweet at all. Cutting them into measured rectangles was completely unnecessary and a waste of time. You can just use a soup can (or something similar) to make them into round "sandwiches." 2 hours from start to end of clean up.

Easy to make but all I could taste was the confectioner's sugar.:( Hubby said no too.  Will look further for a chocolate cream for my chocolate chip sandwich cookies.
