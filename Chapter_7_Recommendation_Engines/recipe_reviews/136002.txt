My guys loved this.  I agree that the top portion is very dense and hard to smooth around to the edge- I may add a tad more milk just to get the choolate layer all the way to the edges.  I am going to bring this as one of the desserts for Thanksgiving. YUMMO!

I've made this dessert many, many times and used various flavors. I even have a variation for a pumpkin flavor. It's always great!

First of all, you need a box of pudding that serves six and a half, not two boxes that serve four each, that is WAY too much filling! Then, the recipe for the bottom layer of cream cheese/ whipped cream is WAY too runny, when you go to pour the chocolate pudding layer on, it sinks RIGHT to the bottom making the runny layer of cream cheese rise the the top and seep all out the sides! What a mess!
If you can find a way to make the lower layer thicker and remember to use six and a half servings box of pudding mix, this might be delicious.
I had to dump it back out of the pie crust into a bowl and mix everything together because it was a big mess. I'm sure it will taste alright but the ribbon effect isn't there.

This was so easy to make and the taste is to die for.  I made this for "girls" night and the girls fell in love.

I had to use a shortbread crust because my store was out of the Oreo type. It still was fantastic. I read another (negative) review and I can't disagree more.The cream cheese portion is not runny at all, and I used the four serving pudding and it was just fine. We all went back for two servings!  Just make sure you cool it for the total four hours, otherwise, it's tough to serve.
