Absolutely delicious! In the old days, no traditional Dalmatian wedding would be complete without this dish. I used fresh herbs from the garden, and the results were outstanding. Thanks for this great recipe!

This was inedible in my opinion, I made it as written, and threw it away. What a waste of food ,vegetables and wine
