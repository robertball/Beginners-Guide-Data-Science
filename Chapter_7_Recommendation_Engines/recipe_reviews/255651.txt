Delicious! My only negative comment is that the directions don't account for all of the items on the ingredient list. I'm hoping the chef will update the directions for those who don't pay close attention...

This will be my go-to mac and cheese from now on. Of course cooks always embellish/change recipes to suit dietary needs or fussy eaters or just for giggles; and I'm no different. I cooked a half pound of bacon, set it aside to drain and crumble. Then added the rendered bacon fat to the macaroni as it was cooking. I shredded 1/2 lb. sharp cheddar, 4 oz. cream cheese, Fontina  and Monterey Jack and added all the while stirring. The crumbled bacon was added just before serving.  Wow, thank you so much!  Good stuff!

The only thing i  did different  was I added  a little extra shredded cheddar and about  2 ounces of half and half to accommodate the extra cheese.  Very good for a very quick week night Mac and Cheese!

Tasty but too loose -- needed to add more cheese and then bake off the liquid

I was nervous because growing up I have always had baked mac n cheese. I tried this today and it was amazing. I added bread crumbs to the top and my family and friends loved it.
