Made a smaller dish of this since I was just trying to use up some strawberries that were getting old. Turned out great, and kids loved it. I used the brown sugar instead of white, but this was only alteration. Very buttery tasting and would be excellent paired with vanilla ice cream. Not too sweet and great flavor. Mine only took about 20min cooking due to convection and smaller dish, so cannot comment on cook time for the recipe size given.

My husband and I loved this strawberry crisp!  I halved the recipe for the amount of strawberries I had and used a smaller baking dish.  And I used half white sugar and half brown sugar, though I'm sure it would taste great with either type.  I also sprinkled a little cinnamon into the oat/flour mixture.  A pastry blender would make incorporating the butter much faster and easier.  Since I don't have one, I used two butter knives to 'cut in' the butter...I trick my mother-in-law taught me years ago!  I will definitely make this recipe again and may even try it with blueberries.

Super easy--super good! You can use any fruit. I used strawberries and peaches and it was great. You can use white or brown sugar. The vanilla in with the fruit added a nice flavor. Add a topping of  yogurt and it becomes a great breakfast granola.

I used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added a little bit of cinnamon, which really enhanced the flavor. Halved the recipe and used an 8x8 baking pan, baked for about half an hour and it turned out great! Served with vanilla ice cream for a delicious summer treat.

I was skeptical about making strawberry crisp but had just picked over 25 pounds of strawberries so I was desperate for something easy and new. I never heard of strawberry crisp but was pleasantly surprised at how awesome it tasted! My family ate it up!

I followed the recipe, but something is off with the butter. My topping was not crumbly and didn't bake. Maybe stick butter  non-softened?

I have never made a plain strawberry crisp before, but I certainly will again! I had some old (REALLY old) strawberries in the freezer covered with lots of ice crystals that I wanted to use up (and doubted were still good). I didn't measure my berries because I just wanted to use them up. My guess was that I had about 8 cups so I added an extra tablespoon of flour and a little more sugar, and I used brown sugar for the topping. Delicious!!

I left off part of the sugar since we do not like to eat a lot of sugar and it tasted delicious! Looking forward to making this again.

Tastes great! So simple and yet so delicious. 
I replaced brown sugar for white sugar.  I'm still trying to figure out the right amount of butter for the topping.  This last time I tried 1.5 cups and it stills feels too clumpy and buttery rather than "crumbly" when preparing.  But certainly it tastes great!
