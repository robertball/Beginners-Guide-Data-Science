I only used this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand, not because I thought it sounded good.  My expectations were low, thinking it would taste like spaghetti flavored pot roast.  Oh my goodness, was I ever wrong.  This is a new family favorite and we eat it at least once a month with mashed potatoes and a salad.  Picky eaters in our family approve as well.  I cook mine in the crock pot on high for 4 or 5 hours.

Superb!  I didn't substitute any ingredients at all.  I did use my crockpot, though.  Just dumped everything and let it go without bothering to brown the meat or anything.  It was soooo good!  Best pot roast I've ever had!  I've made this several times now and it always gets my family's rave reviews!  Couldn't be easier or tastier.

Corrected-This recipe works folks.  My five guinea pigs were all pleased...and that's not easy to do!  Here's the options:  fresh tomatoes rather than stewed, they stew fine during the two hour+ cooking time.  This last time, I used three large juicy red tomatoes, chopped (for those of you gardener-cooks, you will be pleased to note that yellow pear, sweet grape, and heirloom orange all work wonderfully; tomato paste 3-6 TBLS, 1-2 tsp. italian seasoning, + S&P work well instead of a spaghetti packet; 1/4 cup dried minced onion, and add 1/2 cup water or cola instead of fresh onions if there are none available in your pantry.  However if you use fresh onion, chop them nice and small so they cook thoroughly...it's not very nice to chomp into rubbery onion; and I have found it best to use a non-stick dutch oven with a very low simmer(careful those of you with propane),unless you like a black-eyed pot roast! Your other option is of course the crock pot! 8-9 hours on low, 5-6 hours on high, no blackening required. For my LOW CARB cook mates: Count your spaghetti packet as carbs, or use the above tomato paste option; exchange the one cup regular cola with a splenda sweetened cola like Diet Rite, which keep the cola and sweet taste during the simmering.  Neither Aspartame, nutrasweet,or equal will simmer. Enjoy

This was delicious, but I went Mexican instead of Italian.  Instead of dry spaghetti mix, I added dry taco seasoning, deleted the celery and added minced garlic.  When the meat was falling apart, I shredded it and mixed it with green chilis, sour cream, green onions and cheese.  I made enchilada sauce with the remains from the braised meat.  I blended it up with some hot sauce and it was delicious.  I poured the sauce on the bottom of a baking dish and then rolled the meat mixture into tortillas, covering it with the sauce and some extra cheese.  I baked it for about 30 minutes at 350.  Yum!

Made this the day before( because at the last minute we got a chance to go out to dinner!)
A while before serving I took out meat and cut up and then put back in the sauce. I had also added some lonely carrots when I chopped other veggies for the sauce. There is no taste of spagetti sauce in the end.I also used spicy tomatoes (like Rotel). Boiled new potatoes and then smashed them with garlic and butter and served meat and gravy over them. My husband was in a swoon. He took it to work the next day for lunch and called me after he ate it to compliment me. In 31 years that has never happened before!

This was awesome!  I don't even like pot roasts, but I try to make them for my family because they're easy to do.  Mine usually come out dry--even in the crock pot.  This was so moist and had a great flavor.  It does make a lot of gravy, so I'm thinking you could even use a 4 or 5 lb roast with this. As mentioned by some other reviewers, I thought this was going to end up like a roast in spaghetti sauce, but I couldn't have been more wrong.  Give this one a try!  This one will definitely be in my recipe rotation from now on.

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I baked it in 9x12 glass baking dish, covered tightly with aluminum foil, for 4 hours at 275 degrees and it came out perfect, falling apart and juicy.  When the meat was done, I removed it from the glass dish, strained juices into skillet I browned the meat in, added about 2 tablespoons flour, and made a fantastic gravy.  I would definitely make this again.

This was very good and extremely easy to make. It does have quite a sweet sauce which doesn't go over well with everyone (I made a side of brown gravy to placate the finicky). I also found the sauce it a tiny bit salty - a little goes a long way. All in all a great recipe and may try it again using ribs instead of the roast.

Even though this recipe requires more than two hours, I find it easy and quick.  I don't have to stand by the stove for two hours, it only takes about half an hour to prepare and the remainder of the cooking time can be used to prepare other dishes (potatoes, bread, etc.).  The time can also be used to fix up the place before dinner.  I also like that I only use two large dishes one to mix the sauce, and the pot to brown/cook it.  Most of the people I served it to, including the kids liked the roast because it was not too spicy, and the flavor of the meat was not overpowered by any one ingredient.

Let me preface this by saying that I am NOT a fan of pot roast - at all!  Hubby is tho, so I gave this a try and was blown away by how good it was!!  I didn't make any changes except I did add about a TBL of W.shire sauce (probably didn't make a difference).  I did brown the roast and then put it in the slow cooker and poured the sauce over it.  Set it on low and let it go for 8 hrs.  It did worry me when DH came home and said "mmm smells like spaghetti" but it definitely did not taste like it. It came out perfect! The sauce was not too sweet at all and had a nice tang to it - almost sweet/sour but not quite.  Dh made an open face sandwich the next day for lunch and loved it.  This will definitely be made and shared again!
UPDATED: I have made this several times now and have landed on my fav. modifications. 1)Heat 2 TBL oil in dutch oven and while it's heating, add 3 or 4 whole, peeled cloves of garlic.  Remove when they start to brown This replaces the garlic salt. 2)Salt, pepper and flour the roast before browning.  Remove meat and place in crockpot. I omitted the rest of the salt. 3) De-glaze dutch oven with about 1/3 cup good red wine making sure to scrap up the bits on the bottom. Pour over the meat. 4) In the same dutch oven, mix your tomatoes, spag. sauce seasoning, cola and veggies.  Pour over meat and set crockpot on low for about 7 hours or high for about 5. 5) During last hour, add baby carrots and new potatoes if desired.  
This is now a fav of our family!!

Believe my minor changes/additions brought this recipe to a 5.5 - you must try it!   Used the full 12oz bottle of Coke, replaced onion with red onion, used less salt (1/4 tsp), replaced garlic salt with 2 lg. garlic cloves, finely minced, used Italian stewed tomatoes, added 3 TB tomato paste to cut sweet of pkgd spaghetti sauce, 1/4 c. Swanson's beef broth, and one 1" x 1" bay leaf.  Tied kitchen-twine around outside edge of a 3-lb. chuck roast before browning in a 5-qt. Dutch oven.  Added all ingredients to the pot, brought to a boil then, covered and cooked in oven at 325 for 2-1/4 hrs (45 mins/lb).  The gravy didn't require any thickening. Served with linguine and oven-roasted broccoli with sliced garlic and chili-oil.    I very much like this pot roast and every dinner guest requested the recipe so, I send many thanks to the contributor!!

I was a bit adament about trying this recipe. I did out of curiousity more than anything. Although I appreciate the recipe submission this is one I will not be making again.I followed the recipe to the letter but unfortunately I found it to be way to sweet. I will keep making my pot roast the way I always do until another one recipe strikes my fancy....Thanks again for the recipe as others have odviously enjoyed it...:)

This was excellent!  I didn't have the pkg of dry spaghetti mix so I used 2 TBLS of Italian seasoning; also I left out the celery.  I am so glad to find something other than onion soup mix & mushroom soup!!

Just made this yesterday.  Thumbs up all around.  I did it in the slow cooker with a 3 pound sirloin tip.  Used Garlic granules, no extra salt, a little pepper.  2 hours high setting, 4 hours low.  Put baby carrots in last two hours and added flour mixed with a little water and gravy the last hour.  Mashed potatoes and asparagus rounded out the meal.  Will be making mini meat pies with leftovers tonight in muffin tins, using biscuit dough for the crust.  Thanks for the post!

I will try to give as good of a review as I can.. considering my husband only heard me talking about this recipe and decided he would make it. hee hee He used a jar of spagetti sauce, a can of diet coke, dehydrated onion, garlic powder, carrots and potatoes in the bottom of the crock pot, roast on top the other ingredients on top of that, he then cooked it on high for 6 hours. Considering he didn't even know what the exact recipe was, it was pretty tasty and definitely tender and juicy. (next time I will make it myself the correct way) lol lol Definitely a keeper, he used a chuck roast. I had to smile... he was trying to please me? If he had only listened when I was reading the recipe to him last night? hahahaha

This wasnt for me. I was hoping for one of the flavors to come threw. I liked this better with spagetti and parm cheese than on top of mashed potatoes, had it both ways. It wasnt bad but I could think of better ways to use up my chuck roast. Try it you might like it.

I did not follow the recipe to the letter. I had no stewed tomatoes.  I used crushed tomatoes instead.  I also used the substitute for dry spaghetti sauce(tomato paste/Italian seasoning/salt/pepper.)  I also seared the meat for 4 minutes on each side as well.  We also used the leftovers to make a shredded meat wrap the next day.  Note:  My wife got a bowl of the sauce and used it as a soup, it was that good!

Fantastic recipe. Only change I made was to remove the roast after browning, then in the same pot, sautéing the celery, onions and garlic before adding other ingredients. Then put the roast back in and cooked it following the written directions. It tasted too sweet after adding all the ingredients so I didn't think I would like it, but after cooking it was a great flavor. Everyone loved it. Thanks for posting.

Instead of braising the meat on the stove, I roasted it in the oven at 350 degrees for a little over 2 hours. I really liked the way the cola tightened up the sauce giving it a sweet flavor and almost chutney like consistency. My issue with the recipe was I thought it tasted too much like the spaghetti seasoning. I would try the recipe again but maybe with a different kind of seasoning packet.

WOW!!  I could not believe how good this was.  We had a chuck roast and an abundance of tomatoes from the garden.  My work-at-home husband pulled this together.  He skipped browning the roast, omitted the vegetable oil and celery which I don't like. He followed everything else.  He cooked it in the oven at 280 degrees for about 3 1/2 hours.   We served it over rice. We will definitely make again.  There is a lot of liquid with this.  It would make a great stew for a cold winter night.

This was AWESOME. I put it into a roaster and put it in the oven at 350 degrees for 2.5 hours. It was delicious.

Mmmmmm. Today will be my 3rd time making this within a month! My only suggestion is to do it in the crockpot. It's sooo much better that way. I've done it both that way and in the oven. Also, I've subsituted the onion for dried and the celery for celery salt (I just used celery salt instead of regular salt.) It's a must try!

This is my first attempt at making a roast and it was GREAT! My picky husband even ate the leftovers (which he never does). I omitted the celery and instead added 3 medium sized potatoes (cut into quarters) and 2 sliced carrots. I did not use spaghetti sauce mix. Instead, I added 1/4 teaspoon each of basil, oregano and parsley. The meat came out very tender! I will definitely make this again!!!

Absolutely wonderful!  I browned my roast lightly then put it in the oven with all the other ingredients on 275 degrees; it cooked for 4 hours and the bone literally fell out of it.  So tender, so tasty.  A little rice and a salad or green beans and you have a great meal!

I used the exact recipe (sans browning) in my slow cooker on high for 6 hours, and served it with rosemary gravy made from some of the savory juices it produced, along with roasted/sliced/herbed potatoes... my husband of 5 years nearly proposed again.  Next time I plan to substitute the spaghetti packet with herbs I already have, and use fresh tomatoes and tomato paste, and add sliced carrots.  After the majority of the roast is gone, the vegetable beef soup left behind on day 3 will be wonderful.

This is a wonderfully flavorful and easy pot roast.  Great for a busy work day where you can mix it up and put it in the crock pot.  When I make it on weekdays, I skip the browning, put the meat in the crock pot, pour the remaining ingredients on top, then cook on low 6-8 hours while I'm at work.  When I read the ingredients, I wondered about the tomatoes and spaghetti sauce mix, but it all makes for a great flavor. Not too overpowering.  Makes a wonderful gravy and I also used the sauce as a base for beef soup.  Delicious!

This turned out wonderfully. I used bottom round roast and instead of the sauce packet, I used 3 TBSP of the Dry Spaghetti Sauce Mix recipe found on this website. I slow cooked in the crockpot for 6 hours on high. It turned out tender and delicious!

Our supermarket didn't have any 3lb chuck left and didn't feel like waiting around, so I grabbed a pot roast. This recipe worked well, I can't wait to try with a chuck. The pot roast was a little dry on the ends.

Made this in the crockpot and the only adjustment that I made was to use minced garlic instead of garlic salt and I omitted the salt and seasoned to taste before serving. The next time I make this I will add another can of stewed tomatoes minus the juice and will serve it over polenta.

All I can say is wow!!  I can't imagine making pot roast any other way after this.  The sauce is incredible - we all wanted to eat it like soup.  I made just a few minor changes.  I added 2 cloves of chopped garlic, 1 small can of tomato paste and about 1/2 C of beef broth to the stewed tomato mix.  When done I thickened with a bit of corn starch and water - didn't take much because it was already a nice consistancy.  I served this with mashed red potatoes, crusty toasted french bread and a nice green salad.  Everyone had smiles of contentment on their faces after this comfort meal. Oh and I did use diet coke - just amazing - I highly recommend this recipe!

I changed this recipe quite a bit. I didn't make it in the oven, I wanted to make this a crockpot meal so I  wouldn't have to "babysit." I first layered a chopped onion on the bottom of the crock, then the roast. I sauteed sliced fresh mushrooms and  a couple chopped cloves of garlic in  EVOO, then added it to the crock before pouring in the soda mixture. To the soda mixture, I added worchestershire sauce to the soda mixture, along with  pepper to taste. The end result was almost like a burgundy roast/sauce. (I plan on adding 1/2 c. of red wine to the sauce the next time I make it, to boost the flavor another notch.) To thicken the sauce, I added two tablespoons of cornstarch to 1/4. cup of soda, then poured it into the crock. I paired it with this potato recipe, which I did half red potato and half cauliflower: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Suzys-Mashed-Red-Potatoes/Detail.aspx  VERY tasty. The whole family gobbled it up and asked for seconds, even the kids. Both my husband and I were surprized at the end result, which is not what we imagined the roast would taste at all.

I've been using this recipe for awhile but never got a chance to review it.  It was the first pot roast I made that my DH asked to keep on our regular menu, and it has become a quick and easy dinner to fix for company with two small children. I used to brown the roast but now I skip this step b/c of time, and it still comes out great. I still rub the roast with a small amount of Montreal Steak Seasoning, add Tbsp of minced garlic, substitute dried oregano and basil for the spaghetti sauce, and use just a pinch of salt. I throw it in the crockpot for 6-7 hours and even the cheap cuts melt in your mouth! Thanks for the recipe!

I followed some of the other suggestions and just threw the roast in the slow cooker without browning it. I put it on low from 8AM to 5PM and it was perfect. I  also made the mistake of buying the wrong cola - Black Cherry Vanilla, but it turned out just fine.

OMG...was this good! At first I wasn't sure how it would taste since I have never used dry spaghetti mix in a roast before. However, this is the best roast I have ever made! I cooked a 4 pound roast and every bit of it is gone.....for 5 people! Super recipe...thanks for sharing!

My husband said this is his favorite roast recipe.  I didn't have the spaghetti seasoning so I used italian diced tomatoes and added some oregano, basil, and marjoram. I also omitted the salt and used garlic powder instead since some people felt this recipe was a bit salty. I didn't even brown the roast, I just threw in all in a crock pot on the lowest setting for 8 hours and it fell apart because it was so tender.

This is great in the crockpot, and I add potatoes, peppers and baby carrots.  Everyone always wants this recipe, and are surprised to see that cola is in it.  The spaghetti mix, and cola make the recipe.  I get it all ready the night before and start it up on Sundays before church, and it is the BEST tasting roast ever.

This Cola Pot Roast was delicious.  My family really loves the combination of flavors.  I think I might use just a little less cola next time due to the sweetness.   Thank you for the great recipe.

Made it exacly like the recipe but put it in the crockpot as other suggested. Cooked up egg noodles and poured the sauce over them. It was excellent. We loved it! Thanks so very much!

I made this recipe really easy - I put the roast in the crock pot, covered in seasoning and poured on Italian-style stewed tomatoes and part of a can of Coke Zero.  No extra seasonings or onions or celery.  Cooked it on low all day at work and it was falling apart when I came home.  That rates a 5 in my book!

This was my Very First pot roast I have ever attempted.  I do not cook very often and I am slowly starting to change that around... but this was simple to put together!  I browned the meat on both sides in oil for about 7 min and then put it in the crock pot on low for about 7 hours.  I replaced the garlic salt with garlic powder and added regular salt to taste once served.  I also through in some chopped baby carrots and potatoes during the last 2 1/2 hours.  Came out perfect and my husband was Pleasantly Surprised.....def will be making this for company in the future :)

This was okay. To be fair I did use double the amount of stewed tomatoes the recipe called for. I think I will try to put the mexican spin on it next time like the previous reveiwer did.

I liked it.  This recipe adds a new twist to an old favorite because of the different ingredients that I’ve never used before in a pot roast.  It’s hard to mess up this type of pot roast so long as you simmer the meat, covered and on a low setting, in a little liquid for 2-1/2 to 3 hours.  I prefer going 3 hours.  At times, I just use water, salt & pepper, and one onion cut into several pieces and it turns out very good.  Add some fresh baby carrots, canned green beans, and some cut up potatoes during the last 45 to 60 minutes of cooking and you have yourself a nice vegetable beef stew after you cut up the meat and return it to the pot.  When done, I usually add salt and pepper again to taste.  Fresh green beans are even better but I allow for at least a good 2 hours of cooking time for them.  Sometimes I do start off by browning the meat in oil.  Other times, when I’m short on time and don’t feel like dealing with the mess and splatter, I skip the browning and just go straight to simmering.  I think it turns out good either way though I’m sure some would disagree with skipping this step. Though it takes several hours to cook, pot roast makes a wonderful meal and is fairly easy to make with plenty of room for experimentation.

This is a great alternative to the "standard" pot roast. The cola & spaghetti sauce give it a zippy flavor, and the gravy it makes is excellent! The only modifications I make is that I add diced carrot to the onion, celery & tomatoes mixture, then after browning I cook it in a Crock Pot. Last, I stir in a little flour slurry to thicken the gravy and blend it with a stick blender so it is a smoother texture. This makes a lot of gravy, which is excellent over potatoes. I save the extra gravy and use it over meatloaf later in the week. Excellent pot roast!

This is the best recipe ever.  We love it.  I just dump everything in the crock pot and cook on low for eight hours.  The roast just falls apart.  I gave this recipe and a crock pot to a friend for a bridal shower gift.  Everyone who tries it, loves it.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was a bust. My husband took one bite and would not eat the rest. I "could" eat it but did not like it. I tossed it out!  It did not taste like spaghetti, however it was too sweet. If you don't like sweet meat dishes, this is not for you.   I was EXTREMELY dissapointed!

I made this recipe the other day on a whim. Did not have time to make it in a slow cooker, but made it on the stove in 3 hours it was the best, and I repeat, the best pot roast I have ever had and my family raved about it and I have passed the recipe on to about 6 other people.  It is so amazingly spectacular so much so I would serve it for a special dinner for guests. The only other thing I added was cut up carrots ( big chunks)  oh my were they ever flavorful.  this one is a winner!!!!!!!

This was terrific.  I used the crock pot on high about 4 hours.  I then took the meat out, cut it into serving size portions.  Added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch (mixed with cold water) to the juice which made a nice gravy.  Put the meat back in and let it cook another hour or so until everyone was home and ready to eat.  Husband and kids (ages 4, 6, and 8) loved it, seconds all around!

Awesome!  I am not a big fan of pot roast, but my husband likes to try different recipes, so I thought I might as well try this.  I made a couple changes.  I used Italian stewed tomatoes as someone else suggested, added  1-1/2 cups of Diet Coke, less salt, only 1/2 teaspoon.  I omitted the garlic salt completely, added 4 cloves of crushed garlic, large onion, 3 stalks of chopped celery.  I was afraid that it wasn't going to thicken up, but it did.  I served it on top of brown rice, excellent!!!!  The next night I added 1/2 can of french onion soup and again over rice.  Will definitely make this again and share the recipe with others.

   Tasty-delicious~! ^_^

Husband-Housekeeper:
  Was too lazy to defrost meat.  Mixed ingredients together in the crockpot.  threw 2.5 pound frozen chunk of meat in crockpot and cooked for 5 hours on high.  Because of warnings about salt, I just added the amount I would normally add to a roast and used garlic powder instead of garlic salt.  It tasted great (as good as my normally wonderful roast but without the exceptionally unhealthy brown gravy).  A lot easier to make too.

tip: cook until the sauce is reasonably thick.  Most sauces taste sub-par if you don't thicken them enough.

I'm not sure what I expected but this wasn't it. I put it in the crock pot but it came out more like a vegetable soup without all the veggies. My DH thought it was okay, but I won't make it again.

Great recipe, DH gave it 5 stars, and I agree because it was great- the meat was SOOO tender.  

I didn't have celery, so I didn't use it.  I used some potatoes instead (next time I'll use more) and the substitution was great.  

Also, I didn't start it on time to use the crock pot, and didn't want to fuss with it on the stove top (toddler lives here too!), I put it in 9x13 dish with foil tightly covering in a 275 degree oven for about 3 1/2 hours.  The results were great.

This is a recipe that is geat AND easy!  What more could a busy family ask for??  Thanks for the submission!

Sooooo easy and soooo tasty.  Even my nine year old said, "It's awesome and the only way I'll eat peas!"
I didn't have celery or regular cola so I added a can of whole corn and Lesueur peas in the last 15 to 20 minutes.
I also had some baby carrots I threw in along with some cubed potatoes.  I used 3/4 cup of diet coke and 1/4 cup of red wine.  The leftovers are even better!!
Thanks for an great recipe! ;)

I made this as part of our Christmas dinner this as an "extra" meat item in case there wasn't enough ham.  Well, guess what was left?  The ham!  Everyone LOVED this, even my picky mother in law. I was a little hesitant to make this what with the odd ingredients, but wowza!  Fantastico!  Que rico!  The gravy leftovers we were fighting over to pour over our rice the next day. This one is going into my hall of fame for family favorites. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Good!
We added in potatoes and mushrooms which we like. The meat wasn't as tender as I've had, but that might have just been the cut.

This was super easy and good.  I just threw everything in the crock pot on low for 8 hrs.  Didn't even brown the meat first due to time.  I omitted the celery b/c I didn't have any and reduced the salt to only 1 tsp. which was plenty.  I used garlic powder and not garlic salt.  Don't even need a whole cup of onion for good flavor.

I made the recipe exactly as written and used a Dutch oven on the stove top.  The sauce was fabulous!  The meat, however, was not very tender and was not to a level of rare (checked with a meat thermometer) in the 2 hours and 30 minutes.  I had to continue cooking for an additional hour.  My family very much enjoyed the flavor of the sauce, though.  Will try again with adjustments to the length of time.

I don't know what is wrong with this recipe---I followed the instructions exactly except used crushed garlic instead of garlic salt. Not only was the meat tough, but the broth had a funny aftertaste. I'm trying to salvage the roast---rinsed it off, dumped the juices and will use just beef broth for the base and season to my taste.

Great taste! I used diced petite tomatoes and Dr. Pepper. I also put in a whole onion. The flavor was wonderful and there was a lot of juice left over. Will definitely fix again. Thanks for the recipe.

Very easy and very good.  I only browned the roast 5 minutes on each side.  I used italian seasoned stewed tomatoes. I used diet pepsi so added a tiny bit of honey.  Used only 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. After the roast was done I added some instant potato flakes to the gravy to thicken it a little.  I cooked on the stove top as the recipe states.  My husband went on and on about how good this was....especially the gravy.

Made this last night with some changes. It was so delicious, meat totally fell apart. Delicious. I left out celery, sauteed sliced baby bella mushrooms & put aside. I sauteed the onion & 3 cloves rough chopped garlic, then removed and deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup red wine. Put salt, pepper & garlic powder on 2.5 lb. chuck roast, browned in pan on medium heat 8 mins per side.
  I used a 28 oz. can Italian tomatoes (drained & rough chopped), added 3 Tbsp. tomato paste, salt & pepper, garlic salt, lots of dried parsley & a little ceyanne pepper. Added a whole can of diet Coke to the liquid mix along with the sauteed veggies. 
     In my crock pot, I put the roast, poured the liquid & veggies over. Cooked on high for 5 hours.  Removed the meat and thickened with a cornstarch/water mixture. It was divine.

This meat turns out very tender and is great over mashed potatoes! I use a can of Rotel instead of the stewed tomatoes and omit the celery and oil. Great throw together meal and the family loves it!

Used 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes (salt free) and added oregano and 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  Homemade dry spaghetti sauce from this site.  Everything the same minus the salt(s) and oil. Threw it all into the crock pot and went to work.  Came home and steamed potatoes and carrots.  Delish and so easy!

I made this as written with the exception of omitting the regular salt, but I did use the garlic salt called for.  This makes a ton of sauce and I would cut it in half next time.  My only objection to this recipe was the sweetness.  It just didn't seem to work for me on a pot roast.  Maybe my tomatoes were extraordinarily sweet???  The long and slow cooking time did produce a very tender roast.   I would make this again, but cut back on the amount of sauce and probably halve the cola.

Good, tender pot roast.  I left out the celery and added a tablespoon of minced garlic.  I browned mine for about three minutes per side and then put it in the crock pot.  Served it with mashed potatoes.

I can't get over how great this was! This might be the best roast I have ever made! I literally had no left overs. The changes I made were few, but I did salt, pepper, then flour the meat before browning it. I transferred it to a crock pot, deglazed the pan I browned it in, and poured it over the meat. I didn't have any stewed tomatoes, so I chopped three tomatoes up and I think the fresh tomatoes really added something to this recipe. It was a very busy day, so I just threw in some potatoes instead worrying about making mashed potatoes as I usually do. Thank you for submitting this recipe, and for suggesting it to me.

My family loved it!  Even my son's friend, a picky eater, loved it! It was a nice change from my usual onion soup mix roast.  I didn't have spaghetti sauce mix, so I substituted a can of italian diced tomatoes.  I also added 1 can of beef broth and thickened the gravy with cornstarch.  I will be making this roast often.

I loved this, and now make it regularly. My husband, who is very picky and doesn't get enthusiastic about things I cook loved this. He couldn't wait to take the leftovers for lunch the next day. It's a great alternative to the pot roasts with mushroom soup. I did make it in the oven on low heat and not on the stove.

I served this with pasta and it was a big hit.  It was simple to prepare and a different way to make a boring chuck roast. Because I was worried about the package of spaghetti sauce mix being salty and didn't add any of the additional salt the recipe called for.  I like the idea of changing it to a Mexican flavor dish and will try that next time.  A winner!

We really enjoyed this recipe. My husband noticed all that I was adding and he was doubtful. But sometimes the oddest of combination's create something delicious and in this case also very tender and moist. This recipe will be good for camping trips as well.

This is delicious and really easy.  Used diced tomatoes with garlic and onion, and a little extra cola because I thought it might need more liquid.  Cooked in slow cooker for 8 hours on low.

Ahhhhhmazing!  Made some homemade noodles with it (from this site--Chuck Roast with Homemade Noodles).  I didn't brown the meat, just threw everything into the slow cooker and cooked it all day.  Very tender, and very flavorful! Thanks!!

Used diet soda and only a tsp. of Taco seasoning. This dish turned out so well, my husband, son, and I became pigs. It was great.

Tastes very good, and we liked to put the vegetables/sauce that are cooked with it on top of the meat when serving.

There are only 2 recipes I use for pot roast- this one and the awesome slow cooker pot roast from this site. This recipe is great. I was very suprised the first time I made this because roast is usually one of my least favorite meals- not anymore! Thanks!

Awesome recipe!!  Who would have thought so little ingredients could taste soooo good!  I didn't have regular cola so I used diet cola (couldn't tell a difference).  I cubed the meat for easeier serving and I also added carrots and celery and potatoes.  Would HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!

My husband loved this. I used regular pasta sauce instead of the canned tomatoes and dry mix, as that was what I had on hand. I omitted the celery as I didn't have any, but added fresh mushrooms instead, which came out great.

This was very good!!! I didn't change anything except I added some fresh minced garlic. I also accidently bought a Cherry Coke but it tasted awesome! The meat was tender and the sauce was great on egg noodles. I will be making this again soon - I've never had a pot roast tast so good and be edible, not chewy.

This was surprisingly delicious!!  I used Diet Rite Cola (sweetened with Splenda) and spaghetti sauce because that's what I had.  I added carrots, onions and potatoes to the pot after browning, and cooked it in the oven while we were at church.  The vegetables were the best part!  My husband loves my regular roast recipe, but he said that I can make this one again...and that's saying something!  Thanks!

Wow. If I would have read the recipe in a cookbook I would have passed it up, but after reading the rave reviews I knew it had to be good. And it was fabulous. 5 lbs and it only cooked 2 hours in a convection oven (covered) at 300. Super flavorful, moist and TENDER. Blew me away! My husband by far thought it the best roast that's ever came out of my oven, and I totally agree.

I wasn't sure what to expect just from reading the recipe.  I stuck pretty much to the recipe with just a few minor changes.  I used the Italian seasoned stewed tomatos, cut the salt down to 1 tsp., used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added 2 cloves garlic finely chopped.  I let this simmer in a pot for 4 hours.  After tasting it I can't really qualify this as a "pot roast" as the meat is shredded.  I served this ladled over a mashed potatos and it was really good. Husband loved it!  I will definately make this again.  Next time I may try it served over rice.  Also would be great served in corn tortillas.

I was looking for something easy to do with a chuck roast and this worked out well. After browning it, I covered and put it in the oven at 275 for 4 hrs. I added 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup to thicken. Even my somewhat picky 9 yr old wanted seconds.

This is very good. I used garlic salt so omitted the salt.  As suggested,  I also added basil, marjoram and oregano to regular diced tomatoes and cooked in crockpot on low for 6 hrs- plenty tender.  Cozy food that is great with rice.

This recipe is so much nicer than doing the roast in a slow cooker.  It's tender and the sauce is awesome.  I use garlic powder instead of salt and the recipe is just as nice.

I made this tonight for dinner and it was very good. I used crushed tomatoes with italian seasoning already in it instead of the stewed tomatoes and spagehetti sauce mix. I adjusted the seasonings  with salt,pepper, garlic powder, and parsley as it cooked. I also sliced the roast and returned it to the pot for the last 1/2 hr of cooking.

Excellent flavor--just the right hint of sweetness.  I would, however, roast longer in the oven or throw it in the crock pot.

Very yummy!  I really don't cook at all but I thought this would be easy to make if I used a crock pot.  I used potatoes and carrots instead of celery. I also added 1/2 a cup of ketchup just for a little extra kick.  My boyfried is a VERY picky eater and he loved it!  He kept making happy "mmm" noises and saying "tasty..."

I was craving a roast and since my oven has broken down I decided to search for a pot roast recipe. This was my first attempt at a pot roast, and I was amazed at the results. Delicious. I think I may stick with this recipe even after the oven gets fixed!

I made this only because the reviews said the roast was amazing and did not taste like spaghetti.  And sure enough, the roast was amazing and tasted nothing like spaghetti.  My husband went nuts for it so this one is definitely now in my recipe rotation.  The only variation I made was to take the advice of other reviewers and substitute  Italian herbs and tomato paste for the packaged dry spaghetti sauce seasoning packet since I didn't have any handy.  Thanks for the recipe.  This is wonderful, very tasty comfort food.

I tried this recipe using deer chops in a crock pot and could not believe how terrific it tasted!! Usually chops are tough but this made them so tender and tasty!  My new favorite recipe!

I loved this recipe.  I've tried several different roast/beef stew recipes and they all end up with the same basic flavors.  This one is definitely different and I will definitely be making it again.

Not a big fan of pot roast but this was delicious! The whole family loved it.  All that was left was the sauce which i used to make lazy man's cabbage rolls. OMG....the best!  Made a quick notation for next time to do the same.

I made this almost exactly as written, other than using fresh tomatoes (that were almost ready for me to trash, due to being too ripe).  Everything else was as written.  I made it in my cast iron Dutch Oven on the stovetop.  Filled the house with wonderful smells & served with homemade mashed potatoes.  It was juicy, yummy & tender.  I don't know how some of the other reviewers are complaining that it was too sweet.  I used 1/2 can of regular Pepsi and it was fine.  No where near sweet.  I am guessing that some people might be using diet soda.  Next time I think I'm going to try it with regular Root Beer.  Thanks for a nice, easy recipe!

I was hesitant to try this recipe as I didn't want to ruin a good roast.  But I was tired of my usual pot roast recipe so I gave this a try.  I thought this turned out really good and my boyfriend thought so also.  I did tweak the ingredients a bit.  I did not use a full can of Pepsi only because I was nervous it would be too sweet.  I also used 4 Tablespoons of tomato paste and 1 teaspoon of Italian seasoning instead of dry spaghetti mix.  I had a 2 lb. roast and this was plenty to cover the roast in the crock pot.  Overall I was very happy with it and would make it again.

This was really good. All 4 kids and husband enjoyed it. Made mashed potatoes, green peas, and biscuits to go with it. Yum.  I didn't think it would be as good as it was. I pretty much followed the recipe except for the celery, and doubled the amounts of everything to have enough for tomorrows dinner. The gravy was thick enough for us, and my daughter said it was good enough to drink!

I've been making this recipe for years. Throw in prepackaged baby carrots and some pearl onions. Superb! I cook until it just falls apart. Serve over brown rice.

I used 4 cloves of fresh minced garlic, 1 cup of coke, 1/2c red wine, 2-14.5 oz cans of stewed tomatoes and 1-6oz can of tomato paste with 4 lbs of beef roast and it was not sweet at all. I even had to put in 2 tbsp of brown sugar to round off the taste. Browned the meat first, then cut it in 1.5" x 1.5" chunks. Simmered in stockpot on stove for 3.5-4 hrs and it was so tender. Also added in 1 lb of baby carrots, 3 celery stalks, and 2 large potatoes. My husband could not believe I made it with coke. I liked this recipe more as opposed to the other coke roast recipe since it's tomato instead of creamed soup based. Thanks for the recipe. Will definitely make again.

This recipe makes a fantastic pot roast!  I took a chance as I don't cook with tomatoes much and was skeptical of the packaged seasonings. I put all the ingredients (except celery-I don't like it) in the slow cooker and let it cook for 10 hours on low.  It was done at 8 hours but we like pot roast really tender.  The leftovers were even better than the original.  I am making this now for tomorrows dinner giving the flavors time to age.  Makes really yummy sandwiches.

I liked it a lot. Followed it exactly, but with Diet Coke. I was the only one in my house even willing to try it (not a bunch of meat eaters here) but I had leftovers all week. I sliced it thin, heated it up and put it over salad the next day! (sounds wierd but I'm on South Beach) It was good!

Wow, this came out really good!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of adding one clove minced garlic (we like garlic).  I did cook on low longer than the 2.5 hours in the recipe, but I'm used to cooking roasts very slowly anyway.  The roast came out very tender and moist and well flavored.  Family loved it.    

Next time I will make gravy from the liquid on the roast and serve with egg noodles.

Very good roast.  Served on egg noodles.  Next time I'll do something to thicken the juice some.  Also added some garlic & oregano.  It's not a meal w/o garlic.

Very good... The entire family loved it and went back for seconds.  Used 1/2 cup of pepsi to cut back on carbs (diabetic in the house)  I think I will use a diet next time.  Can of low salt stewed tomatos and small can of tomato paste.  Used a small amount of Cornstarch to thicken gravey.   Crock pot for 8 hr on low.   Very good easy dinner.

I just made this today I placed it in my crock pot for 5-6 hours on high and instead of spagetti sauce I use what another person recommended tomatoe paste,Italin seasoning I added red potatoes and carrots in the last few hours. All turned out nice and tender with lots of juice. I like it and the DH loves it!

This recipe was just average for me.  It was good, but it didn't seem to have a lot of flavor.  The dutch oven thing also threw me off- perhaps I just didn't cook it right.

I made this last night for dinner. I doulbed the sauce, and baked in a 400 degree oven for 3 hours, then 250 degree oven for 1 hour. With the sauce I removed half of it and strained it and added flour to make a gravy, serving it with the sauce. It was great. As others have said the spaghetti sauce is not overing powering. Thanks for a keeper recipe.

This SMELLED amazing, but the flavor didn't knock my socks off (or my boyfriend's).  It was your standard pot roast, nothing more, nothing less.  I do love that you can make it at a moment's notice with pantry ingredients, so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars.

This recipe is great as written and have made it many times.  After several times as written, I did streamline it a little by simply searing the meat and then adding a jar of Primavera spaghetti sauce and the cola. I have added chopped carrots as well.  Huge hit with the family!

Excellent! Cooked in the crockpot for about 9 hours.  Tender with a wonderful taste. I did add some red wine and a bay leaf and used a whole can of Coke instead of just one cup.

I am not a big pot roast fan but my husband is.....so I continually look for a pot roast recipe that tastes good to me. And I'm glad to say - I FOUND IT! This was a really good and different recipe. I used the crock pot and followed the recipe except for adding about a cup of homemade spagetti sauce I had on hand. It was such a great change from the normal recipes for pot roast. It's a keeper!! Thanks for sharing!!

Wow how wonderful.....................................
I had to make a few changes b/c I didn't have all the ingredients.  I had no packet, garlic salt or veg. oil.  I used Dry Italian Seasoning, fresh garlic (from a jar) minced and Olive oil.  B/c of high blood pressure no salt sooo I added one beef bouillon cube.  Lightly flower the meat then browned in a crock pot w/ o.oil. removed the meat, sweat the onions and celery in the c.pot.. Then add everything together.  My son hates everything and he loves it.
Cooked green beans and yellow rice. Will be make often.

This roast is so tender and wonderful!  I used a 4 lb roast, cooked it in a 400 degree oven for three hours covered, and it still turned out juicy and delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

My family didn't think this was all that special.  I cooked it in a slow cooker and it smelled great, but turned out too salty.  (And I love salt.)  The meat was tender but we didn't care for the sauce.

This is a great recipe, especially if you're in a hurry.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used a cup of spaghetti sauce in place of the dry spaghetti packet, because I did not have any on hand.  I will definitely make this again and will use the correct ingredients then.  I'm sure it will be as good or better!

This was delicious!  My boyfriend doesn't like onions, so I used a packet of onion soup mix instead.  I added baby carrots, chopped celery and chopped red bell pepper.  I let it cook overnight on low and it was so tender.  I used a 12 oz can of coke and it was just right.  I will definately be making this again!

It was my very first time making pot roast.  And this recipe rocks!!!  I liked it.  My husband loved it.  I used 1.5 lb of meat in case I messed up.  After we gorged ourselves, I thought I should've used bigger sized meat as the recipe called for.  But, it's okay because I will make it again.  Thanks.

This was the best pot roast!! The meat was very tender!  I made a few changes. I used a bottom round, and cooked it in the crock pot. I also added potatoes and carrots. The gravy was SOOO good, I just decided to make a stew out of it. 
EXCELLENT! thanks for sharing!

I thought this recipe was excellent. I used a piece of prime chuck and browned the roast before mixing the sauce.  

This was the best pot roast I have made. The meat was extremely moist. The sauce made a very good tasing gravy without any extra fuss of thickening. I would make this again

I thought that this roast was  okay.  It was very tender.  I admit to leaving out the salt because I was concerened that it would be too salty- maybe this addition was needed to really enhance the flavor.  I think that I'm just used to the traditional type taste of roasts.

I’ve been making this ever since it was first posted. It is so good!  I add big chunks of carrots and cook it in the crockpot for 8 hrs.  IF there are any leftovers, I break up the meat and use it the next day with the sauce over rigatoni.  It is very much like Osso Bucco. In flavor and texture. In fact I have substituted beef shanks in this recipe.

Eh, flavorless.  Of course all the flavor is cooked out of everything in a slow cooker so you need to bring the flavor back in at the end.  I took the roast out and then added in tomato paste, Italian seasoning and garlic powder.  Then turned the heat up to high and cooked until thick.  Served the sauce over the sliced meat.

This is the absolutely best beef or pork roast I have ever eaten! It is extremely tender and makes the whole house smell delicious! I didn't have celery so substituted a sweet red pepper. Definitely 5 stars!

Use a full 12 oz can of cola as it needs more liquid.  You may need to add a little water  during last  30 minutes. I usually use a bed of 5-6 stalks of celery when I am cooking a roast as it adds moisture and prevents the meat from sticking to the the bottom of the pan. Recipe was very tasty.

Too sweet for my taste.  Not sure what I was expecting from the ingredients, but it wasn't this sweet gravy.

This is a huge hit in my house.  I do it in slow cooker on low for 6-8 hours.  I leave out the celery and use the roast for tacos the next night.  Awesome!

Just ok. Made as written except in the crockpot.  No one in the family thrilled...all prefer a richer, browner gravy.

Very good pot roast.  I, like others, added fresh garlic and put it in the crockpot on low for about 7-8 hours.  I added carrots about an hour before serving.  I couldn't find the spaghetti packet  but found something roasted red pepper pesto in a packet and used that.  It was very tasty.

Pretty good! A nice change from your ordinary pot roast and my husband enjoyed it, that is a plus! What I did different was I used Italian stewed tomatoes and I didn't brown the meat in oil, but instead, put it all into the crock pot and cooked it low for 7 hours. The meat was very tender and you could cut it with a fork!

Followed directions, but roast came out dry.  We are used to a more traditional roast with vegies and gravy.  Didn't like the spaghetti/tomato based sauce on the roast.

This is simply delightful -- easy, nutritious and fall-off-the-bone good. I use a heavy cast-iron skillet and receive rave reviews each time I prepare it. Like others, I have substituted spaghetti sauce and added garlic and red wine to the initial sauce preparation.

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I have made it 4 times since finding it here at ALLRECIPES.com.  It is so adaptable too.  I always add vegies as well!  GREAT RECIPE

My first review was in 2004. Needless to say it's 2009, and I'm STILL USING THIS RECIPE. I use it on a weekly basis with chicken. I prefer WHOLE tomatoes, I don't use the celery, not even the garlic salt. I also LOVE IT with Cherry Cola (we've since renamed it Cherry Cola Chicken) and if I have any type of red wine, I throw some of that in it. I used Sangria last week, and it was YUMMY DELICIOUS! This is on our Weekly Menu.  First Review: I'm only giving this recipe 4Stars because it turned out too salty. But it WOULD HAVE BEEN DELICIOUS!! The flavor was great, the sauce was yummy, and it's a great dish! Next time I make this-which will be next weekend for company-I will only use the Garlic salt and omit the plain salt. I also did not have a dutch oven, so I cooked in an electric skillet, and kept it on simmer for an hour and a half-and I didn't have celery or any other veggie, but it was still very yummy.

Again, I am vegan,so I did not try it just cooked it. I made this for my husband and he was floored! The entire roast was gone in a day. When he cut it it broke apart with a fork. The great smell of it filled the whole house! also this is SO SO SO easy to make!

This pot roast is easy to make and tastes absolutely fantastic.  My husband just won't stop raving about it.  You can substitute a lot of the ingredients to use what you have on hand.  For example, I've been using a combination of orgegeno, basil and parsley instead of the spaghetti sauce mix, and a can each of tomato sauce and paste instead of the actual tomatoes.  I use Pepsi for the cola because we're big Pepsi drinkers and the family just LOVES it.  Thank you for posting this!
