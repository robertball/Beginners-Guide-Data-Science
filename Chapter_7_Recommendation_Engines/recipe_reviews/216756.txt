I made these for the first time last night and the family loved them. I used butter flavored hawaiian rolls  and doubled the dijon mustard. I also left out the poppy seeds and used a mixture of minced garlic and onion powder (1 tbsp total). I made 12 with swiss cheese and 12 with muenster cheese. Don't be afraid to pour the entire mixture over the rolls. I was worried it was way too much at first and left some in the bowl. I was wrong! The topping cooks into the rolls perfectly. This recipe is definitely a keeper. Thanks Lisa!

I have this exact recipe from a neighbor, minus the onion.  Her recipe calls for making this up the day before, covering with foil and refrigerating overnight.  When ready, bake at 350 for 25 minutes with foil on, then uncover and bake an additional 5 minutes.  Always a hit and prep the day before makes it ideal when having company.

Great sandwich.  I used 12 regular sized hawaiian rolls and made them up in the morning.  Baked for dinner and they were delicious.  I would suggest covering with foil for at least half of the baking time so that the bun doesn't dry out.  Thanks Lisa T. for sharing this recipe.  It will be great for summer get togethers and a filling dinner sandwich.  My husband and son each ate 3 - they loved them.

I've made these before but grabbed this recipe quickly to make for a party.  After I took them out of the oven I realized I like them better when they're covered with foil and baked 10 minutes, then remove the foil.  These were okay, but not as good as when they're covered first.

Growing up we had a variation of this we called "poker sandwiches" because Mom made them when Dad's friends came over to play poker.  We used yellow mustard, onions, butter and poppy seeds with ham and swiss cheese and made the sandwiches individually with the mustard, onion, butter mixture on the inside of the sandwich.  We wrapped them individually in foil, froze them, and popped them in the oven for poker night.  Our version was always a hit and you can make a ton and keep them on hand for after-school snacks.

I made these for NYE and they were a hit!! I didn't follow the recipe to a T, only because I had a thousand things going on and I screwed up! The must have is King's Hawaiian rolls. Don't buy the knock off's make sure it is that brand, it gives the sandwiches the sweet that everyone loves. The other thing I changed on purpose is I used provolone cheese only because my hubby doesn't like swiss...but I think it would be good either way. I forgot to add the minced onion and would be good with or without. I also added a little more worcestshire only because I looked at the recipe wrong.  I lined a cookie sheet with foil, put the bottoms of the rolls down first (I did slice them in half while they were all connected like others suggested), I put the cheese next, topped with ham that I doubled over to fit the bun (I used a good maple ham), then I put on the top of the bun. I spooned a tablespoon of the mixture on top of each bun and placed a sheet of foil loosely over the top. The buns were buttery from the mixture and just a little crusty, but nice and soft inside. I did have plenty of butter mixture left over, so I think it is safe to cut back on the butter mixture ingredients or there is plenty to add another 12 sandwiches or so. Yummy! UPDATE: Do not use all of the butter mixture...it makes the rolls too buttery. I would use a teaspoon to drizzle a spoonful on top of each one and probably no more.

First of all I modified the recipe greatly because I didn't have a few of the ingredients and I had eaten a sweeter version of these in the past and loved them. I also didn't want all that butter, so I used 1/3 cup of butter, 1 tbsp dijon (I'd add a little more next time), no worcestershire, no poppy seeds, but added 1 tsp of splenda brown a sprinkle or two of tarragon and a pinch of onion powder. I used honey maple ham and muenster cheese and only 16 tea rolls. The tea rolls were great because they were stuck together so I cut all of them in half as one block and assembled the sandwiches in one great square. I put the ham down first, then the cheese and spread a thin layer of may on the top inside so it would melt into the cheese. Then I sliced through them and placed them 1/2" apart on a foil lined pan. I drizzled each one with a scant tablespoon of the sauce and covered them lightly in with foil because I wanted the rolls to steam a bit. It turned out amazing! The rolls were nicely browned on top and slightly crunchy on the edges and bottom. The sauce flavor was slightly sweet and tangy but not overly rich, perfect! So feel free to reduce the butter :)

I wanted to have this made before my guests arrived so I put it all together, covered with foil and refrigerated for about 3 hours ... baked for 10 minutes with foil on and 10 minutes with foil off.  I had to substitute sesame seeds for the poppy seeds and omitted the onions.  As suggested in other reviews, I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and added 2 T. brown sugar to the "sauce".  Delicious.  Will definitely be making these again.  These were all eaten before I even thought about getting a picture!  Too bad because they looked lovely.  Thanks LisaT for this great twist on ham and cheese sandwiches.

Easy to make, and went over really well.  Like others, I reduced the butter to a half cup, and used onion powder instead of minced.  Initially, I softened the butter, and mixed with the other ingredients to form a spread.  (I also added a bit of brown sugar to balance out the Dijon.)  I spread a light coating inside the top half of the rolls, then melted the remaining spread and poured over the rolls.  I made them mid morning, and kept them in the fridge till people arrived for happy hour.  Baked 10 minutes with foil, and 10 minutes without.  I'll definitely make these again!

The other recipe on site doesn't have Worcestershire sauce. Someone brought these to a party yesterday and they were wonderful. She used Hawaiian rolls in lieu of buns.  She used worchestershire. And you must use HONEY MUSTARD.

This is my go-to sandwich recipe when there are family/friend gatherings. So easy, so delicious. I do something different with the butter though. Instead of melting it I just let it get soft and mix all the ingredients into the butter (mustard, worcestershire, poppy seeds and onions)then spread the tops of the rolls (the inside part) before putting the sandwiches back together before baking. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing!

I add 3 TBSP brown sugar to the butter mix, which adds something wonderful. We love these. They are equally good with sesame seeds, if you happen to be out of poppy seeds.

If I could give these babies a 10 I would. I made them for our annual superbowl party and they were a hit! Three people asked for the recipe. I followed other reviewers advice and used the smaller King Hawaiian Rolls and left them in a block while removing the top from the bottom. I added a little mayo, then the ham, then cheese. Put the top back on a cut each sandwich seperately and placed on cookie sheet about 1/2 inch apart.  Baked for 10 minutes with foil on and 10 minutes uncovered. They were amazing! These will now be a staple at all of our parties!

Perfect!  I did  spread some Chive Cream Cheese on the rolls before adding the other ingredients.  I also used Roast Beef and Horseradish Cheddar on half of the sandwiches.

I have made this recipe to the T and it tastes delicious. My favorite! One thing I would suggest is to lightly brush the mixture inside the rolls to get flavor inside and reduce the amount when poured over to decrease soggy sandwiches.

Great recipe, so easy to tweak to your liking. I make these as regular size sandwiches on busy weeknights for my family. Don't usually have poppy seeds on hand so I use toasted sesame seeds, which we prefer. Omitted the onions, we didn't care for them. I've quit melting the butter, prefer making it a spread that i put on top of cheese, inside the bun. I buy kaiser rolls from the bakery, but even hamburger buns have worked in a pinch. Occasionally change it up with provolone cheese too.

I've made these several times now. So delicious and easy. I got my recipe down to how I like it - I use Koop's dijon mustard, plus in addition to the listed ingredients I add a tablespoon of honey, and a dash of garlic & onion powder (just a tad). I don't measure out the minced onion anymore, I sorta eyeball it. Also, I prefer these made with King's Hawaiian Savory Butter Rolls. They look exactly like the the Sweet Hawaiian Rolls. So I make half and half to please everyone in the family. The savory rolls give it another depth of flavor. I also prefer provolone cheese to swiss. But really, any cheese will do. I also bake these on a huge cookie sheet. I let the melted mixture cool to a a bit thicker consistency and brush it on the sandwiches instead of pouring it over the sandwiches. Fun recipe to play around with. Very good as written, though!!!!!

I made these rolls for New Years Eve and because we had so many other things to eat we had about 6 leftover sandwiches. I just popped them in a Ziploc bag and froze them. Today (February 8) I took one out, microwaved it in a paper towel for 25 seconds and THOROUGHLY enjoyed it.
I'll definitely make them again for a party. But I may also just make them occasionally for no other reason than to freeze them as a handy snack or light lunch. Delicious!
As someone else said, however, you MUST use King brand Hawaiian rolls. I can't imagine how the sandwiches could be this good with plain mini rolls....

Made these for a potluck using Hawaiin rolls and got tons of compliments. Only thing I would add is that you should cover with foil before baking....otherwise the tops get quite brown and crispy.

These were fabulous!   I followed the suggestions to use King's Hawaiian Rolls, which took it to the next level.  I used fresh onions cooked down in butter, then I put them in the blender with the butter, mustard, etc.  I brushed it on the sandwiches right before baking, and had no complaints of their being greasy. It seemed to soak nicely into the bread.   I remember a similar dish from when I was a kid, and now I believe these will a staple for dish-to-pass events I go to. Thanks for a great recipe!

The flavor was right.  My only complaint is that the baking time toasted the bottom of the buns a little too much.

I had these sandwiches at a family reunion recently and they were so yummy! Everyone was fighting over them and they were gone in no time. I want some right now just thinking about them.

This is a family favorite. I often add a 1/3 cup of brown sugar to the sauce which is good too. I also use dinner rolls or Hawaiian rolls.

These are delicious if you follow the recipe as written. I like to add a tablespoon of brown sugar to the mustard mixture, use provolone cheese instead of Swiss, and turkey for the second layer of meat. Make more than you think you'll need. They go fast!

Delicious recipe!  I used honey wheat Hawaiian rolls and they gave the recipe a mild sweetness that balanced the mustard and onion well.  I love these little sandwiches and plan to make them often.

I made these sandwiches last night to take to a Christmas party in our new neighborhood where we just moved and were meeting our neighbors for the first time.  The sandwiches were a huge hit!  They were delicious!

I've been making these for years! I found this recipe online about 7 years ago, so this particular one isn't an original, but still delicious! Perfect for get togethers and super bowl parties. Sometimes I omit the poppy seeds.

My self and my moonkid 1st had this recipe at the PNW Round-Up at Candice's. They were so good. However, less messy then the recipe calls for because Candice was gracious as to put the onion poppy seed mixture inside the sandwiches for better serving to us. They were perfect. So I had been meaning to make them at home for my family since. I followed as close to the recipe as possible but utilized a large fresh bakery French bread and made one long sub for my family. Oh how that was perfect. The presentation was absolutely amazing and the looks on my family's faces was priceless. Turned out soo well and I did top the onion poppy seed mixture on the outside as suggested. The mixture was soo flavorful. I did prepare another batch of the mixture and place in the frig for another batch of these yummy sandwiches for the freezer, but placed the mixture for these, inside the sandwiches for quick toss on a baking sheet and in the oven on the go for my kids. Perfect all the way around. The recipe is so forgiving if you want a Rye bread or even a soft pumpernickel and roast beef style sandwich. Will totally be a repeat offender in my household...TY!

Oh my gosh, I cannot express enough how absolutely delish this recipe is. So good. I just made it today for my mom for a little mothers day brunch. It was our first time making it, we are hooked. Already know this will be in our meal rotation, not just for a holiday, s yummy! I scaled the recipe to 12 serving for one package of the Hawaiian rolls. I got the rolls on clearance for 39 cents at Aldis and have 2 more packages in the freezer! My first time having those rolls too. I used regular yellow mustard and did rehydrate the dried onion before mixing in to the sauce as someone suggested. I did also add 2 Tb of brown sugar to the sauce. I was worried about pouring the liquid over the rolls it seemed like a lot, but do not alter the amount of the liquid at all, the recipe gives you the perfect amount for the amount of servings you are making. The sauce browned the sandwiches and there was a beautiful and yummy crust on the rolls from the butter/brown sugar mixture. My mom and I are excited about the leftovers! Happy Mothers Day! Thanks for a super awesome delicious recipe!

Man Tasted and Man Approved.  5 stars as written.  Made these for my husband and buddies on football nite.  Prepare yourself for all the compliments you'll receive and stand back and smile because it was SO easy!  I just found out these are called "Funeral Sandwiches" (google it - same recipe)b/c you can make the sandwich ahead and refrigerate.  Then later pour the butter sauce on them and bake.  I like your name a whole lot better!

These are soooo good! The first batched was a little dry. I think I cooked them too long. The second batch I watched more closely and I spread the butter on the inside of the top bun then put the rest over them. The second batch wasn't as dry.

These are awesome! I made a similar recipe last year, but didn't have all the ingredients. I used the calculate button to change it to 6 servings, as I only had 6 mini rolls. I used reduced fat cheese and whipped butter to lower the sat fat some. Mine did cook in about 10 minutes, but that may be because of the size rolls I used. Next time I will cover them with a piece of foil for part of the baking time. The topping is great and very flavorful on these sandwiches. They also work excellent for lunches and road trips. TY

Made these for the first time tonight and they were fantastic! They were so good that I want to make them for a lot of potlucks or football parties. Super easy. you could premake them and wait to put the butter on until they are ready to eat. Takes about 20min uncovered. You can bring to your party made up with the butter already mixed with the other toppings. Then pour on top at the party, then bake 20min. perfection!

These were the first party apps to go! The layering the meat and cheese over all the buns made preparing this much quicker than individually.  It was Easy to cut and serve when the came out of the oven. My only change was onion powder for the dried minced. Will definitely make this again!

Really good.  Used King's Hawaiian sweet rolls;  I cut the whole block in half and then layered on the ingredients.  I used turkey sandwich meat and it was very good.  I'm sure ham would be delicious.  I omitted the poppy seeds and it was still great.  I also had to use honey dijon mustard.  We liked it; I might stick with that even if I had regular dijon.

Love these! They are called "coma sandwiches" by my boyfriend. I do change a few things: first I use both ham and salami, Swiss Gruyere mix, and caramelized onions with black pepper. The sauce is mostly like the recipe aside from using both hot sweet and Dijon mustard. Making them again for Super Bowl but this time I will use a half cup of butter instead of the 3/4 called for.

I have made these twice now...outstanding is the best way to describe these...I did use regular mustard because some of my guests are not crazy about spicy and it didn't matter. ..they were great...I also cut the ham and cheese to fit the rolls...you can use baked turkey and other cheeses too...pre-make the sandwiches and then just brush on the topping before popping in the oven..highly recommended!

Definitely use fresh chopped onion (not fried) and sauté them with with the honey mustard and Worcestershire mixture.  Covering them with foil makes for a delicious melted cheese and soft bun.  They are the most popular dish at any party and I end up looking like a star!

Fast and easy great tasting finger sandwiches. I thought 24 would be too many but they disappeared. I served them to 8 adults for lunch.  I prepared them exactly as written.  The only change I made was I cooked them covered for the first 15 minutes, then uncovered for 15 minutes.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. Delicious!

Skip the dried onions. I sauteed/softened diced red onions in the butter before adding the other sauce ingredients. I spread sauce on the inside of the buns before layering on the ham (I used leftover slices of a spiral cut ham) and Swiss, but did not pour it over the top -- this cut down considerably on the messiness factor. Oh and everyone should use KING'S Hawaiian rolls. So tasty!

These sandwiches are so yummy! I made the following tweeks to recipe. I spread a little Miracle Whip on both pieces of the rolls before assembling. I also used provolone, muenster, and cheddar cheeses (I made 50 sandwiches so wanted to mix up the cheese to see if any one was better than the other. No difference....they all worked great!) As for the sauce, the only ingredients I used were butter, spicy mustard, and honey. I would definitely suggest making at least double, if not triple, the recipe for the sauce. I made them up the night before and baked them (covered at 350) for about 20-25 minutes.  I highly recommend cutting between every roll before baking otherwise the sandwiches would smoosh trying to be cut after baking. Everyone loved them and I will be making these many more times!

Made exactly as stated (except I don't like swiss so I used provolone). They were a hit at the party. Made a second time just because and it was still good. Always nice when a recipe is simple and turns out well every time. I used mini potato rolls but might try the suggested Hawaiian rolls in the future.

I made these little jewels yesterday for my New Year's Eve small family gathering.  They were so good and a huge hit.  I followed the menu to a tee with the exception of substituting deli turkey for the ham, also sliced muenster and smoked provolone instead of swiss.  At the suggestion of a few other reviewers, I used sweet Hawaiian rolls, which were good, but abit too sweet for our tastes, so next time I prepare these (and believe me there will be a next time) I'll choose a nice small sandwich bun from the bakery, wheat maybe or perhaps potato.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!!  :)

I didn't have any type of mustard so I substituted the Dijon mustard with a mix of vinegar, water, cream cheese, and mayonnaise. I also didn't have any of the other ingredients (but I still forged ahead because of how delicious these sandwiches looked) so I subbed soy sauce for the Worcestershire sauce, skipped the onions, subbed sesame seeds for the poppy seeds, subbed sharp cheddar for the Swiss cheese, subbed canola oil for the melted butter, subbed thinly sliced smoked sausages for the ham, and subbed hot dog buns for the sandwich rolls (I'm pretty sure any type of bread would work). I also added some honey to the sauce mixture. I divided this recipe by 12 to make four servings (two hog dog buns) and cooked for 15 minutes (10 minutes covered in foil, 5 minutes uncovered). These looked awesome and tasted great despite me subbing every single ingredient with something that I actually had on hand! It's not even that hard to put together. I'll definitely be making these again

I made these for a party and they were a big hit.  I did not want a party full of poppyseed teeth so I omitted the poppy seeds.  I made them with Rhodes frozen dinner rolls.  I used Provolone instead of swiss by mistake and I did not have dried onion so I finely grated some fresh sweet onion.

Delicious! I used the King's Hawaiian mini rolls, left out the poppy seeds, used only 1/2 cup of butter, & actually rehydrated my minced onion. Also, switched the amounts of 2 ingredients: used 1 1/2 TEAS. of Dijon mustard (not a mustard fan) & used 1 1/2 TBSP. Worcestershire sauce... they were perfect! I made 60 of these lovely little sandwiches for a ladies event at church & they went over very well!

I made a small batch of these just for dinner at home and they were really good! I liked the dijon flavor a lot and they were really quick and simple to put together. I would serve them for a party, or just make them for the family again.

This was a nice twist on a hot ham and cheese. It was a little bland though and I thought it needed more worcestershire and maybe onion too. I liked the crispy tops and the mustard flavor.

These were very good but I prefer the version with garlic. That might be because I had to leave off the onion due to dietary restraints, but overall these were tasty. Thanks for sharing!

Super Easy!  Very very yummy!!!  I actually followed it exactly and then rated it.  Hilarious how people say I followed recipe exactly BUT I added 10 more things and prepared it completely different.  Hahaha!!  Either way, I did follow it to a T without using suggestions.  That being said, the suggestions are spot on...less butter, cover it for first 19 mins, and add brown sugar.  Have a blessed day!

7.15.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/216756/baked-ham-and-cheese-party-sandwiches/... 'Gotta tell ya, I tasted the butter & wasn't so sure I'd continue, but went ahead.  Actually, I almost melted the butter - okay, margarine - & added the remaining ingredients except the poppy seeds.  I let that sit to plump the onion.  It cooled into a thick spread.  I spread some on the inner sides of the top & bottom buns, assembled, & remaining spread on top of buns.  I used white cheddar & it was really good.  I foil-covered then removed till somewhat toasted.  Yummy.  Yummy, but the bottoms were quite buttery.  I'm thinking same ratios, but less; or waiting to spread on top till uncovered.  Thanks for the recommendation, Sis!

This recipe was absolutely fabulous! Ingredients-wise, I did not change anything. The only thing I did differently was I organized the ham and cheese on each roll individually so I wouldn't have to cut them apart at the end. I also prepped the whole thing in advance, left it in the fridge covered in foil, and then on party night I baked it at 325 with the foil on for 25 minutes, then 5 minutes more with the foil off. I also took inspiration from the recipe photo and put a toothpick with olives in each sandwich, which made it easier for people to "pull one." I used King's Hawaiian Rolls for mine. They came out super moist and delicious... you didn't even need to put on any condiments. People were asking for the recipe, and I will certainly be making this again. It's a keeper!

I made this exactly as written expect I added a little mayo to the inside of the buns , I used whole wheat Hawaiian rolls,  and I used a combo of sharp cheddar and Havarti cheeses.  These were absolutely delicious!  The hubs and the kiddo could NOT stop raving about these and went back for seconds and even thirds.  The topping really does take these sandwiches  over the top.  They were so good, I made them a few days later with turkey, mustard, and provolone. I ran out of dried minced onion so I made some caramelized onion instead. Again, they were amazing. So glad I found this recipe! So simple yet so yummy.

Very good! I used onion powder instead of minced because that's what I had and they were delicious! Covered for part of the baking time like others have recommended. I would just note that the kids at my party didn't care much for the dijon mustard taste, however slight. If I was going to make to please a kiddie crowd, I might skip the dijon next time.

These were delicious!  This is what I did:
I bought 12 slices of swiss cheese and layered that on the bottom and top instead of in the middle like the recipe called for.  I also bought two ½ lb. bags of ham in the deli fridge from Publix and only ended up using one ½ lb. bag of ham.  I put two pieces of ham on four of the Hawaiian buns. And made the topping just like it describes.  However, I did read a few other similar recipes, and I covered with foil for about 12 min. and uncovered the last 8 min.

Pretty good. I wouldn't serve it at a party or anything like that, but it's a good, simple meal for the family. It is rather bland, as is, so I had to increase the topping and add onion and garlic powder. It's nothing to flip out over, but it's decent. I'll probably tweak it a bit and use it for leftover ham sandwiches.

The only thing I change for this recipe is using HONEY Dijon Mustard, rather than just regular Dijon.  It makes all the difference. These are so incredibly delicious, I dream about them!

We made these to eat while we watched Sunday football. I had no idea ham and cheese could be so good! We made some of them with Swiss and some with Provolone. We liked the Provolone a little more, but others may enjoy the Swiss if they like a cheese with a little more punch. We used King's Hawaiian bread for the rolls, and I would definitely do that again; the flavor was great! I don't see that the poppy seeds add much to the recipe other than getting stuck in your teeth, so I'd skip those next time, but we will definitely make these again. Would be great for a casual party as well. Next time I might try adding a little drizzle of yellow mustard to the inside of each sandwich.

I made these for my granddaughters graduation brunch.  I made 3 batches of 15 thinking that this would be plenty.  They were so delicious they flew off the serving trays before I knew it and people raved about them.  One cautionary note....I recommend that you use a firmer type of roll.  I used fresh dinner rolls that were so soft they were a little difficult to split.  Other than that, these were great!

I use 1/2 cup butter and onion poppy seed buns. They are great with deli turkey  too. Sometimes I add tomato or red onion slices.

Used the Hawaiian rolls, provolone cheese and put the mix on the rolls ahead of time. They must be covered with aluminum foil for half of the cooking time, I've burned the tops otherwise.  ANOTHER TIME: I reduced the amount just to make some for dinner and this certainly was quick & easy! Used four brioche buns that fit into an 8x8 pan. You don't want too much space inbetween or the butter will settle on the bottom and make the sandwich soggy.

Adults and children both loved this sandwich. It's a good recipe. I made it just as it is written.  I greased the pan generously with butter and the bottom of the buns toasted beautifully.  Be sure to use high quality ham and cheese. It seems like too much meat and cheese, but you need it all. Putting the cheese between the ham layers kept the bottoms of the buns from becoming soggy. These are good little sandwiches!

4 stars because the flavor was good, and it was easy and quick to cook. Minus 1 star because they came out a bit soggy on the bottom. I cooked them for 20 minutes with foil and 10 minutes without as other comments suggested. I would make these again, however instead of pouring the sauce over the sandwiches I would instead just brush a healthy amount onto each sandwich top. Even with the soggy bottoms these little dudes got demolished, another recipe win!

I have made these sandwiches for years. I use 1 stick of butter instead of 1 and a half which is plenty. I use fresh onion.  I buy 2 pans frozen dinner rolls, such as Sister Shuberts. Flip the rolls out of the pan in one piece. Cut the rolls in half side ways. Spread the butter /mustard mixture over both sides of the rolls.  I ask the deli to give me 2, 1/2  # packages of deli ham, shaved so its paper thin. I then put 1/2 # on each pan of rolls. I  use 1 package of sliced Swiss cheese divided over the rolls.   Carefully put the top portion of the rolls back on.  Lift the whole rolls back into the aluminum pan that they came in and bake. You then can cut them into individual sandwiches. These freeze beautifully unbaked. If not used immediately, I put each pan back in the plastic bag they came in.  Then you can bake a pan individually either frozen or allowed to thaw before baking.  Makes 24 small sandwiches. A big winner!

I'm sorry to be one of the negative reviews, but not one person out of 7 liked this recipe.  I've made other ham slider recipes before and was looking for something new.  I made the recipe exactly as written.  Every person complained that the mustard flavor was overwhelming.  They felt the flavors  were fighting with one another.  And uncovering the rolls at the end of the cooking time was a huge mistake because the rolls started to get hard.  This was a "no" for us.

My husband and I were surprised at how good these were! I used the king's hawaiian rolls, honey mustard (if you use honey mustard you don't need to add brown sugar), a little onion powder in addition to the dried minced onion, and used a spatula to coat over the sandwiches. I baked them for 10 minutes covered in foil then 10 minutes uncovered. SO good!!!

Added a little brown sugar to the mixture and poured over, then refrigerated overnight (covered in tin foil).  Baked 20 min covered in foil, took foil off last 10 min more. YUMMY!

These were so good!!! Such a great way to spice up a sandwich. I may double the sauce next time and dip the entire sandwich in it (french toast style), and bake them that way. The flavor of the sauce is so good and I feel you'll get a lot more doing it that way rather than just pouring it on top. I will also be trying different meats and cheeses with this. So fun!!

My aunt made these for a family get together and they were incredible. However, she do one thing different. She used a bbq pork and beef mixture to replace the ham to make the sandwiches heartier. I highly recommend during so or use ham, turkey and bacon and make club sandwiches instead. I love these little sandwiches. Always a big hit!

OMG these were SO SO good!  I'm really not crazy about ham and I can't stand Swiss, but ye gods!  I couldn't stop eating them!  Definitely going on my Holiday luncheon/app menu this year.  Thank you!

Had these at a volunteer luncheon and went looking for an excuse to make them again. You'd be inclined to think they would be soggy or mushy but they were anything but.

I add 1/4 cup brown sugar....delicious. I also use Hawaiian rolls. I stack the sandwiches with a few pieces of ham and cheese, I don't skimp. This is a meal or appetizer.

Had to make 2 batches of this cause the first ran out in the first 10 minutes. Easy to assemble and the flavor is awesome! I too used the Hawaiian King rolls to many oohs and aahs!

These were awesome.  I took them to game night and they went quickly.  The next day, my son asked if there were any of those sandwiches left.  Will definitely make again.

So good!  Honestly, I was doubtful.  I thought they would be soggy but not at all.  The butter, with the onions and poppy seeds, makes them crispy and flavorful.    I scaled the recipe to 4 and used a small glass dish for baking; baked uncovered for about 12 minutes; used whole wheat rolls that were labeled 'cocktail buns' but they were really more like dinner rolls to me.  [Cocktail buns I've used in the past were individual and smaller, not baked together in a kind of sheet.  I'm guess I'm the oddball who doesn't really care for King's.] I also crushed the dried minced onion a bit, as my onions looked more chopped than minced.  We will likely make these often!

My family loves when I make these.  I always use Hawaiian butter rolls and add half the butter mixture to the inside of the sandwich and the other half to the top.  This is definitely one of our favorite recipes from this site.

I had made these before and didn't review them. Made again for NYE, so yummy! You would think they would be mushy from pouring liquid over them , but they get nice and crispy on the top. Great appetizer! Thanks Lisa!

I made these for our couples card party  and everyone, men and women alike, loved them. Made 24 for 8 people and had very few left. Served with a salad, and chips. Easily rewarmed. Based on previous posts, I also reduced the butter to 1/2 cup. It was plenty

I have to say this was pretty good! I made this for a birthday party and everyone kept coming back for more. My daughter wanted me to make them for dinner lol. I love Cooper cheese so I used yellow and white Cooper cheese on this as well as a few other spices in the mixture.

I made this for a gathering after a funeral.  I made half with cheese and half without.  The cheese ones were a huge hit.  I had multiple people asking for the recipe.  I made this the night before and baked them the morning of.  I then kept them warm in a Pyrex. Zipped bag for about an 90 min before serving and they were still good!

Made the  recipe for a Super Bowl party.  Big hit.   Also, added sandwich length bread butter pickles as one of the layers for half of the sandwiches; not closest to the bread and people seemed to like the ones with the pickles the best.  Only issue I had w the recipe was cutting through the sandwiches to separate them after they baked.  Might want to do one less layer of ham to help with this than the recipe calls for next time.

I made this for a party and it was a huge hit.  I doubled the recipe and they were gone quickly.  The only change I made is that I used onion powder because I didn't have dried minced onions.  I will definitely be making these again.

These are great! Better than my old recipe which did not use the onions.  So be sure not to leave those out.  They make a huge difference.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I used the good stuff... King's  Hawaiian rolls, Boar's Head Sweet Sliced Ham and Private Selection Baby Swiss.   These little sammies were a big hit at the teachers luncheon at  school, and made the house smell delicious!

These are delicious and easy to make. The only change I made was to sprinkle the poppy seeds on top of the sandwiches after they had the butter solution brushed on them, instead of adding the poppy seeds to the melted butter mixture. I got better coverage on the bun tops with the poppy seeds this way.  I served these sliders with a hearty bowl of corn chowder.

These are the best little sandwiches.  They go great with everything and don't fill you up so you can have other appetizers and the kids love them!

This was a big hit!  I changed the recipe a little by increasing the mustard by one tablespoon and used bagel everything spices instead of the onion power and poppy seeds.  Will make this again and again!

Made 400 for a wedding.  I don't care for poppy seeds, so omitted them but they were definitely a hit! Making more for our job's final Christmas potluck before we shut down Dec 31st for good.

This is a great appetizer, but can also be used as sliders for game day.  It's delicious and can be made ahead of time to be placed in oven right before guests arrive.

I will definitely make these again. Looked at another recipe and decided to add a Tablespoon of brown sugar so they were slightly sweet. Also used Deli sliced ham on half and deli sliced turkey on the other ones. Both were a huge hit at a party and disappeared more than any other item.

These were a huge hit. Smelled so good.  I will definitely make again & add to my appetizer collection  The only things I changed was to use flax seed instead of poppy seeds, as that's what I had and  I made my own rolls.

Made this for a group of friends and it was surprisingly a big hit.  
I changed things a little bit:  Used a small smoked spiral sliced ham, shredded gouda, and omitted the poppy seeds.  
I was a little skeptical of the melted butter poured over the sandwiches but it really enhanced the flavor.  Definite keeper.

This was pretty good. I wanted to make this as exact as possible so my review would be valid rather than making all kinds of changes. 

However, I did have to make a few slight changes. I didn't have dried minced onion, I had dried chopped onion...so I crushed it to make it more "minced". :)  That's pretty close!

I needed to use leftover ham from Thanksgiving so I used that rather than deli ham...still close enough!

I didn't have Swiss cheese so I used a variety of cheeses spread out so I could try them separately. I used American cheese, Provolone cheese and Pepper Jack cheese. I think I liked the American cheese better , then the Pepper Jack and then the Provolone.

Overall I made the recipe pretty dang close to the original without any major changes that might actually affect the outcome.

I don't think I'll put the poppy seeds in next time though just because I can't stand them getting stuck in my teeth!

Great recipe. I used 24 mini dinner rolls, left the rolls in tack, sliced in half tops and bottoms stayed in tack. This made it easy to work with. Assembled back into the tin pan the rolls came in. Removed from pan and cut into the 24 rolls!!!! Delicious 2 bite sandwich! Thanks for the recipe!

I made this as a last minute add-on item for a buffet.  People inhaled them!  I did reduce the butter by about 1/3 but I made a double batch so it seemed like way too much.  The store was out of Hawaiian rolls but I'll use those next time - and there will be a next time.

I made this for a luncheon this afternoon along with soup and a broccoli salad. They were a big hit.  I did not have minced onion.  So I used about of 1/4 of a teaspoon of onion powder.   Everyone was like I think  I will make these in the future.  They were great.

These were delicious. I made them last week for a party. I used smoked turkey instead of ham, because the birthday girl has pork and beef allergies. We were serving tons of other food, so I cut the recipe in half; but I followed the rest of it exactly. The sandwiches were easy and quick to put together, though I would have preferred ham. I served them with Waldorf (apple) salad, and typical party sides (chips, crudités, ranch dip, etc).

I’ve made these several times. I’ve made a few other recipes but this one is the winner. I always follow the recipe but add a bit more meat and extra cheese (Gouda, Munster, havarti, etc.

I actuallly originally got this recipe from another sight, Tasty I think, but they may have gotten it from here or it's a popular consistent recipe. They were good, but I am not huge on a lot of mustard flavor. If you likee mustard, then you'll like this recipe. Other than that, yummy.

These are great!  The only change I made was adding a little extra ham.

Absolutely delicious. Taste like Hardees' hot ham and cheese. Had way too much of the butter mixture leftover, however. Next time I'd cut it in half.

I made a double batch ahead of time uslng white bread uncut to fill in the leftover pan space (9x13).  I left off the onions and seeds and followed the tips.  

Everyone at the baby shower had good things to say about the sandwiches.  Most people ate 2.   Other than the dessert I only had pickles and olives and at mid-day that was enough.

Just as so many reviews said, this is a great recipe, and so very easy!!! I always get compliments, and you can change the meats and cheeses to fit your taste. I didn't make any changes to the original recipe. Thank you so much for sharing this!!!

Always a big hit with our potluck crowds, these sandwiches fit a casual meal. They also please a bunch of hungry teenagers. Hawaiian Rolls add a bit of sweetness to the sandwich, a little brown sugar enhances that.

This recipe is great for parties or special events. I wouldn’t recommend for a day to day meal- this much butter will kill you! I substituted the dried onion and poppy seeds with 1.5 tbspns of Trader Joe’s Everything but the bagel seasoning, and it was sooooo good. I will definitely be using again to wow my loved ones :)

Wow.  My kids can't get enough to of this.  They want it for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I made it so many times I don't follow the recipe anymore. I put whatever cold cuts and cheese I have in the fridge, sliced onions, even spinach to make it "healthy" and bake it. The Hawaiian rolls can make anything taste good if u bake it with butter!

This is an excellent party or everyday sandwich!  Easy, quick and delicious.  I love the flavors melded together in the sauce you use on the rolls.  I add garlic to this recipe's sauce because I love garlic.  It works well with a salad or a vegetable as a side.  Make and enjoy!

Will definitely make again. I didn’t have minced onion, so I sprinkled in some onion salt. I used ham on some sandwiches and turkey on others. I’ve made sliders many times before using various ingredients I had on hand to make a mayonnaise-based sandwich spread. I was usually pleased with the results, but this was much better — and easier.

My tip is to line the pan with foil. After taking the sandwiches out of the oven, lift the foil out of the pan, place on a large cutting board, and slice into individual sandwiches.

I have to say I had my doubts as I made these for the super bowl next to more traditional sliders.  These bad boys had rave reviews and folks were calling dibs to take home with them as they were heading out the door.

Easy recipe and tasted great.  I didn't have poppy seeds so substituted sesame seeds and folks loved them.

I will definitely make again when we have a gathering!

Great recipe! Two helpful hints...One...freeze the buns....this will allow you to cut these otherwise soft squishy buns cleanly in half without crushing the bun...Two, fold the ham twice to fit on each individual bun AND, fold and place half of a cheese slice on each bun as well....this will save the unnecessary bother of having to cut the sandwiches out of the pan.

Very good liked the flavor and served along with my favorite soup. Would make again.  Since my husband likes American cheese I made it half swiss and half American worked out just fine. Served what was  left for lunch the next day

This turned out awesome, we used smoked deli ham and provolone cheese.  I bet you could really mix it up with other proteins and different kinds of cheeses.

I made this for a party.  Made the sandwiches in advance.  Then put the "sauce" on and put in oven just as guest arrived, so they were warm.  They disappeared in no time!

I made no changes. Will definitely make again. I made extra so anyone that wanted to could take some home with them. Everyone took some home with them. Thanks so much for this recipe.

The best use for leftover ham, bar none. An instant classic we'll come  back to again and again for small family meals and large potluck dinners alike. Thanks so much for sharing!

I did not put the sesame seeds but the sandwiches are to die for. There were two left and my husband had them the next morning heated with eggs. I used a package of frozen dinner rolls and cooked them until lightly brown and then followed the recipe exactly, so they made tiny sandwiches but oh so good.

Made this 3 times now.  Next time I'll use more onion ( maybe 2 1/2 tbs.).  I also have a gas oven and find 20 minutes at 350 can make the tops a bit too crisp.  I'll try 325 with it covered with foil for the first 15 minutes.

Great Recipe!  It calls for too much poppy seed so i just sprinkle some on before i cook it.  I also use pepper jack cheese and cheddar cheese since we don't really like swiss and my kids love it.  It's easy to make and yummy to eat1

Made without the poppyseeds.  Different way to "make" a sandwich.  I would make again maybe with turkey and cheddar?

I really want to use this recipe again, but even reducing the butter, and spreading some inside and only 1T on top of each sandwich, the bottom was very greasy and would have been hard to eat standing at a party. I may try making these again, and flipping them at the end to dry the bottom to see if that helps.

These turned out so well!!  Many people at the party we took them to said they were really good and were asking how we made them. I actually doubled the recipe and came home with only 5 left!  When making them I used the King's Hawaiian mini rolls and made one batch with muenster cheese & the other with swiss.  I also covered them with foil when cooking for 10 minutes and then uncovered for 10 because of comments about this in previous reviews.  I'm curious to see what they would be like uncovered a little longer.  I'll try that next time!

We have been making these for years. Always a hit with the kids. I use Hawaiian rolls and provolone instead of Swiss since my kids don’t care for it. I always cover with foil so the rolls don’t get dry.

I made it without any changes. It was super easy. I thought it would be a great dish to have when my friends with children come over. We end up visiting while preparing a meal together and the kids  could have this so it won't matter if our chatting causes  the meal to take a while. If I was making it just for adults I would add either more mustard or try a stronger mustard.

Actually my cousin made these for a birthday party. They were wonderful! She did them just the way the recipe is written and they were a hit!!  Then I made them this way and BBQ chicken and  munster cheese. Both ways are great!

We love these sandwiches. For family preference I use the Hawaiian rolls, but change out the worscheshire and dijon mustard. my family doesn’t like either?????. I just put a dab of yellow mustard instead inside each roll. Then I brush the tops with melted butter mixed with poppyseed and finely grated onion. Still a good recipe. I’ve had the original recipe at parties and love them!

I made these exactly as the recipe was written.  They turned out great.  Everyone at the pot luck enjoyed them.  Just know they make a lot.  For less than a crowd, I will cut the recipe in half.

Tasty. Try to serve hot, if possible. When cheese cools it gets a little  stiff (cheese is not longer melted).   Also, make sure to really mix the sauce with a whisk otherwise there are pockets of mustard flavor and some with little to none. Really a nice, east recipe. Thanks!

This recipe was a big hit at our baby shower.  I followed the recipe exactly, completely assembled the night before and covered it with aluminum foil.  The next day I baked it at 350, covered for 25 minutes, then uncovered for 5 minutes longer.  Everyone loved them and they were so easy to make.

These were very tasty and hubby loved them.  The only negative is that with all butter, they were a bit rich for me.  But will still probably make them again.... just eat less of them.   :)

These are really good, tasty and easy to make. I upped the mustard a little to 2T and actually used some fresh minced onion I happened to have on hand instead of the dried minced. Turned out great.

This are very good. Doesn’t taste like classic mustard or Worcestershire flavors but a great new flavor from the two combined. I like to have our bread softer so I keep them covered with tinfoil while baking the entire time or they get too crispy for everyone but my husband. We make these often especially when we have company.

Our family thoroughly enjoyed these sliders. Normally l follow the recipes that I try, as is. With this one however,  I knew that the poppy seeds would not work for us, but I also knew that the topper sauce, was important. I didn't have Dijon mustard, but chose to substitute the mustard by using Honey Mustard dressing instead. Provolone cheese (our family 's favorite) , instead of Swiss. This really is a quick meal to be put together and a definite keeper.

I used a variety of roast beef, turkey, ham and different cheeses and they were all fantastic. Didn’t have poppy seeds or onions and even used regular mustard and steak sauce for the Worcestershire. It’s a really versatile recipe.

These were a HUGE hit! I even accidentally over cooked them and they still all disappeared. I made them exactly as the recipe states, and they were perfect. These (and my air-fried pickles) were the only things that completely disappeared at the Super Bowl party. ZERO LEFTOVERS! It's a keeper, as is. Don't use Kings Hawaiian Rolls. I guess if you like that sort of thing you can, but I think they are horrible. I used the ones that you bake and they are always a hit. My kids and mom and in-laws were all wanting more. I've used a similar recipe but didn't have the exact recipe, so grabbed this one. I like the addition of the minced onion.

Wow! These totally hit the spot! Such a quick and tasty sandwich. I cut the recipe in half, simply because we're a family of 4, and I only had 12 buns!! But they ALL dissappeared!

Absolutely fabulous party sandwiches, but no need to stop at ham and swiss.  I have made these for my yearly Boxing Day open house, family get togethers, even a bridal shower.  I use the same recipe and ingredients but swap out the meat and cheese.  Beef and mozzarella, chicken and havarti, roast pork and gouda, pulled pork and cheddar, even pastrami, swiss and mustard.  Everyone had their favourites, but they were all a hit!

This is a great recipe!  I think you can tweak it a bit, based on what you have on-hand (spiral ham, turkey, other cheeses, etc.).  I've made these using spiral sliced ham and added about 1/2 tsp. of the ham drippings -- just the juice -- to each bottom bun.  I also put a bit of the mustard "sauce" on the bottom bun before layering the ham and cheese.  As others commented, I covered these sandwiches with foil and refrigerated them for a couple of hours before baking.  Then, I left the foil on the rolls for probably the first 15 mins. of baking, and uncovered them to finish.  Excellent!

I made this with Sister Shubert rolls. My husband looked at the product before I put it in the oven and he was very skeptical. He loved it! Served it with tomato soup. Very good!

These little sandwiches are awesome! Very tasty and the poppy seeds give them a nice little crunch. I used sub buns and cut them in small pieces. I am imagining this might be yummy with other fillings but the ham and swiss was wonderful. Will make them again!

Everyone liked these sandwiches.  They were just as good heated up the next day.  I used onion powder because that was what I had, but I think I next time I would add cooked onions to the middle of the sandwich instead.

This is DELICIOUS!  Since it's good luck to eat pork for New Year's and I didn't want to go the traditional pork roast route, I made this amazing dish.  I did use King's Hawaiian rolls (which are delicious all by themselves ;+), good quality deli ham and Swiss cheese.  I used thick slices of Swiss.  I followed the recipe exactly with two changes:  I added 1 tsp garlic powder because  I love garlic in anything and I thought it was a great addition.  I also did not have dried minced onion on hand so I finely diced 1/4 onion and sauteed it in 1 Tbsp of butter 'til it was soft and translucent.  I thought that 1.5 Tbsps of Dijon might be too much, but it was just right.  I let mine sit in the 'fridge for 3 hours before baking.  This was the most popular food on the table and I'll be making it as often as I can!

These are really tasty and a great way to use up some of that Christmas ham! I didn’t have mini rolls but instead I halved the recipe and put the sauce mixture on top of white bread. Worked out great!

These party sandwiches are delicious!! Always the hit of any party I take them to. Easy to make, they can be assembled ahead of time, then drizzled with topping & baked last minute. They're even good when they cool off to room temperature, but .. they won't last that long. Only change I make, because I can't find "mini" sandwich rolls at the mkt, I use the 18 count pkg of Hawaiian rolls. They fit perfectly in a 9x13" baking pan & as I previously mentioned .. they are delicious!!

This has now become the item that I take to parties.  I've taken this to at least 4 parties so far and they are the first food that disappears.  I usually do not add mustard to my sandwiches because I don't  like the taste.  I use the full amount of mustard in this recipe and love these sandwiches.  This recipe is so easy.  It takes like five minutes to get the sandwiches ready and then you have twenty minute to finish getting read for the party.

These were very good!  I'm not normally a fan of mustard, but it really did work great in this recipe.  I did not make any changes to it, it's a hit as is.  I'm curious to see how it is by adding brown sugar to it, as others have mentioned though.  Great crowd pleaser and quick and easy to make! Will make again.

I will definitely made this again. In fact, I'm making them for a gathering at my house tomorrow for about 12 people. They were delicious! They're even good for the next few days. All you have to do is nuke them for about 20 seconds and you're good to go. I used Black Forest Ham and Baby Swiss, sliced as think as I could get it. I might use sesame seeds next time, as the poppy seeds tend to get stuck in your teeth.

Outstanding!  I used Raclette cheese per the recommendation of a cheese expert and French brioche from Whole Foods (since they don't carry sweet rolls).  I sliced the brioche, spread the butter mixture on the outside pieces of the bread , added ham and cheese, then grilled on both sides. Hubby and my 5 year old loved it...although I used just butter without the mustard and spices for my daughter.

I made this as listed.  Used King's Hawaiian rolls.  Next time I will NOT melt the butter (but have it softened) and mix it up and spread approx half on the INSIDE of the rolls.  Then I will melt the rest and pour over the top.  I did cover with foil for approx half the baking time.  Family liked it and I will definitely make again.

Very good.  Big hit.  I have also made this with Provolone and Roast Beef using the Hawaiin Butter Buns.  With the Beef I added  (in addition to original "sauce") creamy horseradish sauce.  I mix everything in softened butter and spread a light coat on the inside of the bottom buns.  Then assemble and pour the remaining melted butter mixture over the top.  When making either way I make ahead of time and let the flavors develop.  I bake covered for 20 - 25 minutes then uncovered for remaining 5.  Soooo good (the men prefer the Roast Beef)

Really good. I skipped the seeds on top. They went super fast ( but there were 5 teenage boys at the house). I used the Hawaiian bread they so many suggested and I am very glad that I did. I will be making these again for sure

I was making these for a party of older folks and decided to chop the ham so no one would have to deal with a whole slab of hot ham landing on their chin. It worked out nicely. I also substituted sesame seed for poppy (I was out). More mustard and fresh onion. They were wiped out pretty quickly!

used 1 package of sweet hawaiian rolls for a half recipe, thin sliced swiss and ham.  Fit perfectly in my 8.5 x 11 pan, baked for 10 minutes covered, then 10 minutes uncovered.  The kids (especially alice) tore this up

I make this recipe every year now during the holiday season. Here's my modifications - 1 cup butter (not melted), 1 TBS poppy seeds, 1/2 tsp chopped onion, and instead of Djion mustard I have a homemade honey mustard recipe that I use. Also, if I have any leftover honey baked ham I will use that and it is delicious!

OMG this was delicious, I half the recipe because I only had 12 Hawaiian sweet rolls, I did used ham, I bake it on 350 with foil on for 13 min then I took foil off and bake it for another 7 min.  I was so delicious.  at first I thought the butter sauce would make the bread too soft and watery I was as wrong it was just simply delicious, I did add a little bit of pepper to the sauce for some added flavor.  My husband raved about them, made it with chicken fingers recipe found here and pasta salad also found here, will definitely make them again and again.

Adopted some of the changes from reviewers. Used King's Hawaiian rolls, cut the butter to 1/2 cup, and substituted Stripling's Jalapeno Honey Mustard (3 tablespoons) for Dijon mustard (1-1/2 tablespoons). Baked for 10 minutes covered with a tent foil, and uncovered for 10 minutes more. Next time, I would bake uncovered for 15 minutes to better melt the cheese. I assembled the sandwiches and prepared mustard mixture ahead of when the guests arrived, and later spread the mustard mixture over the sandwiches just before going into oven. Delicious, and a very versatile recipe.

I love this recipe.  It is easy and quick and loved by all.  I normally use stone ground mustard and omit the brown sugar.  My husband's office always requests these for potlucks.  Also use all butter mixture and put some inside the sandwiches and on top.  Delicious!

I have a question for those of you who have made these wonderful little sliders. I would like to make many and freeze them to serve at my daughter's wedding in ten days. Could I make the sandwiches in batches, pour the sauce over them and then freeze them before before baking? What do you recommend? Would they need to be fully thawed before baking? Thanks for any advice :)

Excellent any way you make them, with any meats/cheeses/seeds/etc. The only consistent change I make is that I use 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil and 1/4 cup butter, instead of 3/4 cup butter.

My kids go HAM for these sandwiches. I don't make them all the time because they are not necessarily healthy, but so good as a snack food dinner during football games. The combination of the sweet bread, ham, swiss & topping is irresistible. Will def make them again

I made this recipe the first time exactly as written for a church reception on mini dinner rolls.  It was very good and I got tons of compliments!  But, now, I make a few very minor changes. I find that if I don't mix in the poppy seeds, I can better evenly distribute them by sprinkling them on after I put on the butter mixture.  I also mix more dijon with some mayo (or use honey mustard) and spread a very thin layer on the inside of the top buns, or between the ham and cheese.  I follow other reviewers' suggestions and make them the night before, but do not bake them.  Cover with foil, letting the topping soak in over night.  Bake just before my event for 25 minutes still covered, and then 5 more minutes uncovered.  Turn out perfectly!!!  (Also good with muenster cheese instead of swiss.)  These are my go to party and pot-luck contribution!   (Also make them with turkey and cheddar - just as good)

I recently attendeded a funeral reception where delicious ham and cheese mini sandwiches were served. I wondered where one could find these delicious poppy seed onion rolls.  Forward fast a few weeks.  I was asked to make some sandwiches for a reception at our church.  So I decided to search All Recipes for a good idea.  I was quite surprised to come across this recipe which seemed very much like the sandwiches I had enjoyed several weeks before.  So, using Hawaiian rolls I made them.  They were easy to prepare and simply delicious.  Next time I will be sure to get thinner sliced ham.  I asked for thin sliced, but ...

This is a great make ahead dish. I read the reviews. I used 34 Hawaiian rolls and about 1-1/3 lbs each of  thin sliced Black Forest ham and baby Swiss cheese. I did not increase or decrease the quantity of the "sauce". 

I lined a lasagna pan plus another small pan with foil (not into scrubbing melted cheese off pans) and then forgot to grease the pan. They didn't stick too badly but I was glad for the foil!

I put the bottom bun halves in the pans and spread a scant tablespoon of the sauce on each of the bottom buns (when I sliced them in half they  ended up in squares of 4 rolls), then layered ham, cheese and another layer of ham. I put the bun tops on and spooned the remaining sauce over them, about a generous tablespoon on each. Then I cut them into individual sandwiches.

I covered the pans with foil, sealing the edges and put them into the refrigerator. The next morning I took them from the refrigerator straight into the preheated 350 degree oven still covered with foil. I removed the foil cover after about 25 minutes and returned the uncovered sandwiches to the oven for another 10 to 15 minutes. Because I was transporting them to a family picnic I recovered them with the foil and put them into an insulated carrier. They were still warm, soft and delicious over an hour later. I am thinking about turkey, smoked Gouda and some thin sliced red onion for the next batch!

Made these exactly as written except for covering with foil for the first ten minutes of baking time. They were great!  I had a bit of a hard time cutting them so they dont look as nice as some of the pictures but they tasted wonderful and were super easy to make. They were much easier to cut after theyd cooled down. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

I have made these little beauties for about the past 10 years or more.  They are the best darn appetizer or meal.  Just packed with flavor.  Make sure you get the mini rolls that come in an aluminum tray.  It makes slicing and baking so much easier.  I use yellow mustard but my next batch I will try Dijon.  I have given this recipe out to soooo many people over the years.  That's how you know they are great!!!!

Made these last week and they turned out great! The only part of the recipe that I tweaked was getting very thinly shaved honey ham from the deli, instead of the thick slices of ham that people often use. I had to reheat them in the oven over a couple days, and they were delicious every time! Next time, I might use a little less mustard, but I will definitely be making them again.

I followed the recipe pretty closely. The ham was shaved quite thin and muenster thin as well. I didn't have enough ham for more than one layer of each but it turned out fine. After reading other reviews I cut through the layers before putting the sauce on. I was paranoid that the buns would burn so I covered the pans with foil and uncovered them for only the last 10 minutes of baking. They could actually have used just a little more browning, but were declared delicious. Will definitely make these again.

Very good, however there was too much mustard for my liking.  I reduced the amount when I made them but will reduce even more to about 1/2 tablespoon next time.  I will also try adding a pinch of brown sugar  like another reviewer mentioned.

Will definitely make these again. I used half as much cheese and it was plenty. Also used advice from other reviewers and baked covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for 10 additional minutes, 30 minutes total cooking time. Also I think it's worth mentioning that you can make these up the day before if you like and just bake when you are ready to serve.  I think it's easier to make the sandwiches up on a cutting board and slice them before putting them in the pan. Then cover with sauce.

Been making these since the '50's when my mother cut a recipe called "Walter Cronkite's Favorite Sandwiches" out of a women's magazine. It called for 1/3C softened butter, aprox. 1T poppy seeds, 2T finely chopped green onions (more of the green than white), and 2T old fashioned yellow mustard. No worcestershire. We spread the butter mixture thinly on the inside top and bottom of the buns, and again on outside top which spreads the flavor while using less butter. Layer on the ham and Swiss, bake covered at 350 on an upper rack for ten minutes, and uncovered for ten. Works for us!

Easy and tasty.  Used different types of cheese, american, colby/jack,  and cheddar because we are not swiss fans.  Covered half the time b/c getting too brown.  The extra step of making the butter topping was worth it.  I spooned some in the sandwich then drizzled on top.

So good!!! The only change is that I individually wrapped them in foil and cooked them wrapped for 18 minutes and opened them up for the last few minutes. I did that at 350.  Great, but a little too crispy. Second batch lowered oven to 250 and cooked 15 for wrapped and then opened up for five minutes. Heaven!!

I made these for the Super Bowl, and they were a hit! I did cut back on the butter just a bit, as I was afraid they would be greasy. I topped half with swiss cheese and the other half with cheddar (for my picky kids who don't like swiss)! Everyone loved them, and the leftovers made great lunches for the kids to take to school!

I only used 1/2 cup butter in this and 1/2 tsp onion powder instead of minced onion.  After cutting rolls in half spread each half lightly with mayo, top and bottom.  Before pouring the melted butter mixture on top, using a serrated knife cut the individual rolls.  They are much easier to cut before baking than after baking.  Then top with butter mixture.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were a huge hit for our Super Bowl party. My fiance said they were even better reheated.  I LOVED that these could be made a day ahead, to be popped in the oven the next day. I will be putting these tasty sliders at the top of my party food list.

These are absolutely wonderful!  Even though I'm not a mustard fan I love these sandwiches and so did everyone else at the party. I baked them covered in foil for the first half of the time then baked them uncovered for the remaining time. You won't be disappointed.

That was my first time making these but won't be the last time. I think for my stove the temperature was too hot. Other than that minor glitch these were perfectly delicious. I used jalapeno Hawaiian rolls. Loved the hot and sweet!

I love these for parties.  However I butter the inside of the top and bottom instead of pouring the mixture on the top.  Nobody wants greasy fingers at a party.  It is preferable to cover them with aluminum foil when you do it this way to keep the buns from hardening

This is a keeper.  I made it to bring to a holiday brunch and everyone loved it!  Hubby said several times that it was the best food we had at the party.  Easy and so yummy.  This is a keeper.

I should have covered with foil for at least half of the baking - otherwise - they're pretty good!

Made these for our little New Year's Eve get together and they were a hit. I made a second, smaller batch later because they were so good we were craving more. I'm actually making a batch for dinner tonight.

I made them this way: used provolone cheese, savory butter Hawaiian Rolls, spicy brown mustard, no poppy seeds and 1.5 TBSP of worcestershire (read the recipe wrong)

These are fabulous. The butter is a little more than you really need, but I would not skimp on it.   I have made 12, 16 and 24 rolls, so I am not sure how much butter I usually use.  This last time I used about 5 tbs for 12 rolls.  Definitely use the King Hawaiian rolls.  I have tried Great Value and Aldi version of these rolls and they are not as good as the original.  I usually spread a light layer of mayo on the roll.  I cut a slice of cheese into 4th because the size is perfect for the roll and put one quarter of cheese, two slices of ham folded into fourths, and then another quarter of cheese.  I don't have minced onion so I usually just use a little bit of dry onion soup mix.  Don't skip the poppy seeds, they add a little sweetness.  Good stuff.  And as others have said, make in advance and let sit for a couple of hours and then bake covered at first.

I've had something similar to this before. I was wary of using Dijon in the sauce, but, these turned out delicious.  Raves all around for Christmas Eve get together. I made the recipe as written and everyone loved them.

My family really enjoys these! They are great when I have a family gathering as they are so quick and easy to make. I might double the butter/mustard mix next time but, they are perfect as is. I have made these sandwiches 3 times now and will definitely make them many more times. I cover with foil for first 15 minutes and uncover for last 3-5 minutes. Otherwise they get too crunchy. I also baste the bottom roll with some of the sauce and top the rolls with the rest of it. Really adds to the flavor. Now they are perfect!

I've been making this recipe for years with a few adjustments. I used fresh grated onion and put in just a little bit of the onion juice. I also have used grated swiss cheese and it's great, but also another added step and I nix poppy seeds. They just get stuck in your teeth. Anyway, these are great. I make them for pretty much every Christmas party we go to.

These are great but they taste best when you put about half the sauce on the bottom rolls before topping with the ham and cheese.   You're eating more of the flavor.  I've also made these vegetarian with only cheese, which were also popular.

This is staple pre-holiday staple in our house. Easy to make and filling. I  use horseradish mustard and only brush the on the butter instead of pouring it because I don't like soggy bread.

I had high hopes for this one. As so many raved about the Kings sweet rolls, I went for it. WRONG. I did NOT care for these. IF you really like these rolls all by themselves then go for it. But if you're like me and not a fan, then do NOT use them. WAYYY too sweet for me. Actually kind of ruined the sandwiches. Next time I'll use either sour dough rolls or rye bread and cut into bite size pieces. Also added brown sugar as many others suggested. Also NOT good. Ended up adding more butter and Dijon to dilute the sugar taste. Bottom line: if you're not a fan of sweet sandwiches, stick to tried and true rye or even sour dough. Then cut into bit e size sandwiches.

I made these this morning and placed in refrigerator covered with foil. I baked these at 730 pm 25 minutes covered with foil and 5 minutes uncovered. These are delicious. I used deli black forest ham some with Swiss cheese others with provolone cheese. Very easy recipe to follow. Thanks!

I love these. this is the third time I made them. I didn't have Dijon mustard and remembered I had some little cups of hot mustard from McDonalds (they always give me extra) so I used that. it was great! I made them with swiss cheese the first two times but with provolone this time.

This is outstanding! I took this recipe camping to make them in pie irons. I used Hawaiian bread with pineapple. Though the bread wound up being too sweet, they were still tasty. Will try again with regular buns as recipe calls for.

These sandwiches are so delicious and easy.  I have made several times for different get togethers, company and potluck. I have never served them when someone didn't ask for the recipe.  They are good as leftovers.   I don't know what I did before I learned to make these sandwiches.  I usually use the sauce on 12 rolls instead of 24.

I've had this recipe in my box for a very long time and finally made them yesterday.  They are fantastic!  Very good and easy to put together.  Definitely use unsalted butter as the Worcestershire Sauce and ham are already quite salty.  I do agree with one reviewer that these would have benefitted from having a sheet of foil placed over them for the first 10 minutes or so, as mine became very very brown.  This might be dependent on how brown your rolls are to start with.  A+

Sounded like a good idea for a Super Bowl party. It was just okay.

Next time I will only use 1/2 cup of butter. I let sit for four hours and cooked covered with foil for 20 and then uncovered for 10. I also used honey mustard for my kids tastes. They were great though.

Delicious! Made this for a party and everyone loved it, I will definitely make again. At the last minute I realized that I did not have any worchester sauce and is was still great without that. I also used regular mustard instead of Dijon.

Loved these! I've made them before with a similar recipe but these turned out better.  I adjusted the recipe a bit.  I used leftover rolls from Texas Roadhouse from a party we catered.  Because they are larger only for a dozen in a 9x13.  I topped them with deli sliced ham and a mixture of smoked Gouda and provolone I had on hand.  The butter mixture I followed closely but lessened the poppyseeds to our preferences.  I covered it with foil and put it in the fridge for about 3 hours. Pulled it out to bake for 20 minutes covered and 10 uncovered.  They were AMAZING!!!  Very filling and rich so best to serve with a side salad and try to stick to one since these are bigger but the roadhouse rolls are perfect for this! I'd highly recommend picking them up just for this purpose!

Yum! I used my favorite homemade dinner roll recipe, substituted finely diced white onion for the dehydrated onion and omitted the poppy seeds since I did not have any. I will be making these often! Thanks for sharing :)

I made this for dinner with homemade rolls and my husband and three boys all enjoyed them which is rare. I chose to use provolone cheese since my boys are not into swiss cheese. I also only used 6 tablespoons of butter with good results. The last thing I did differently was to cover the first 10 minutes of baking because they do get to hard, in my opinion, when baked  uncovered the whole time.  They were very good and I am sure I would have liked them just as much fallowing the recipe with the exception of keeping them uncovered, but I wanted to make them slightly healthier and more appealing to young children.

I made this for a church potluck and everyone absolutely loved them!  I had never made them or tasted them before and I thought they were fantastic!  Many asked for the recipe, so that always makes me happy to know it was enjoyed!  Thanks for the recipe. I will be making these  for other occasions. YUM!!!! Oh, and I did use the Hawaiian rolls.

Made for my son's graduation party. They were a big hit! Followed the recipe exactly, except as others noted, I covered with foil for 10 minutes and uncovered fir the last 10 mins. Super easy and very delicious!

I have made this about 2 times now and it was delicious both times. The first time I made it as written, the second time I omitted the poppy seeds and used muenster and provolone instead of the swiss and it was a big hit. Will be making again for game night snacks.

I like it. Easy to make, easy to transport if needed and tasty too. I was given some Kurobuta Ham so I sliced it fairly thin and put some on each bun bottom, cheese, low salt Deli Turkey and more cheese. Then put the top bun on. The butter amount worked well as I sized it to 12 buns. I did alter it and I'm glad I did. I blanched some asparagus spears for 3 minutes then put two spears on each (alternating the tips and stems) after each meat layer. Plus I turned the second asparagus layer 90 degrees...too cool. My friend was impressed and ate 4 of them.

Family loved these, only made one minor mod, the sauce was a bit too mustard tasting for the group, so i added 1 Tbls of honey to the sauce and it cut the mustard perfectly and turned out fantastic everybody loved them, as someone else posted, make extras, they'll be appreciated.

I made as instructed minus the poppy seeds (seed allergy). They were most delicious warm from the oven, although they weren't bad by halftime, after they'd cooled completely. I reheated them in the oven the next day, and they were as good as Day 1.

These are always a hit at family gatherings.  I use the Hawaiian brand rolls because I tried another brand and they were so soggy and not good.  There is always extra butter, so I am cutting back on that ingredient.  I spoon the mixture over the rolls, bake with foil covering, and remove the foil at

I made these for some guests we had over and everyone loved them.  They're so easy and quick to make.  My only revision was using regular mustard as I didn't have any Dijon on-hand.  Also, I took someone else's advice and baked them for 10 minutes covered in foil, then removed the foil for the additional 10 minutes.  Excellent!

I LOVED this! My husband loved it, my company loved it and the kids loved it! That's a lot of love!  Didn't change a thing.  My only complaint is that I'm not sure what kind of mini-rolls the original person used to fit 24 rolls in a 9 x 13 pan.  There was no way that 24 was going to fit in my pan.  I had to pull out my jelly roll pan and then it was fine.  Yummy, making it again soon!

So many varieties of this recipe but I used this one as the base.  I don't know what hawaiian rolls are but I take it they are sweet so I added a tblspn of brown sugar to the butter mixture before pouring over white pan rolls.   I didn't bother greasing the pan before hand since the butter mixture sat on the rolls for about 30 minutes before I'd get a chance to put them in the oven.  I followed others advice and covered with foil for the first 2/3 of cooking time.   Turned out great for a kids end of season hockey party.

I made these with Hawaiian Rolls and, while they were tasty, they were actually a little too sweet for me. Next time I'll try with regular rolls  and maybe change up the sauce a little. Ranch would work well with these.

These are super awesome. Made this last night after having waited forever. I accidently thought that I needed 2 lbs of ham and spread them half on bottom, then cheese, then other half on top of cheese and they cooked down together as I got the ham sliced very thin and they were fine so if 1 lb isn't enough then 2 lbs is fine for 24 rolls which comes out to 2 packages worth. Ham I got was Virginia ham and it was perfect for ham rolls. For those saying it was too much butter-I found it was a great amount of butter. I put some of the mixture on the bottom roll, layered my ham, cheese, then ham, and put the top rolls on then I put rest of the mixture on top. If it drips down sides and through middle then that is fine. I cooked my rolls on aluminum foil and between that and the butter it made the bottom of the rolls nice and crispy like a baked sub feel which we loved and cooked with aluminum foil on top for given time and they were super awesome. And don't worry about not being able to cut through ham. Some separate the ham on each roll but each one is easily to cut through-just remember how you laid the bottom roll halves and you should be fine. My family loved them. I want more mustard but my spouse says no so will be making mine on a separate sheet next time. Also I used cookie sheets covered in foil which was fine.

We had these at my son's birthday party. So easy and so YUMMY!!! I used half ham and half turkey with provolone instead of just ham and swiss, but that had more to do with what was available at Costco ;). Also, I used the 16 count packages of Kings Hawaiian rolls, so instead of 24 rolls we had 32 rolls with the same amount of topping. Really though it's the topping that MAKES these sandwiches. As others have said, everyone RAVED about these sandwiches and asked for the recipe.

Husband loved this one!   I cut recipe in half now unless I'm having a large crowd for dinner.   I also cover with foil 10 minutes and then 10 minutes with foil removed.

Great and easy recipe.  I think 1 1/2 pounds of ham per 1 pound of swiss works better.  Also chopping one onion rather gives it a better flavor.

Left out Dijon because my family despises it for some reason and spread a little mayo on bottom of rolls. Big hit for our party.

This is a great recipe and so easy to make. I use Hawaiian rolls , havartti cheese instead.  My family loves these!  My girls don't want me to make too often because they are irresistible but so fattening. Definitely cover these when cooking so they don't dry out. Great for tailgating.

These are WONDERFUL.  We have them for dinner occasionally.  MUST use Kings Hawaiian rolls AND Dijon mustard AND poppy seeds, or don't waste your time!  For us, I cut way back on the butter.  I LOVE butter, but that much made it dripping with butter.  Otherwise, didn't change a thing.  One of my most favorite recipes ever.

I added a cut up garlic clove to the butter mixture and used honey smoked turkey instead of ham.  Very nice with a bowl of soup for lunch.

These are perfect for gameday ! Use whatever you have on hand for meats and cheeses, poppy seed or sesame seed. I cut the sammies apart so that the sauce runs in between and coats better. they go fast - make a lot

What a great recipe! I made this for SuperBowl 50 and it was a huge hit. I followed the recipe exactly and would do the same thing next time. I made it in advance and refrigerated it until I was ready to cook it. Thanks!

I made these yesterday for a Super Bowl party and they were a huge hit.  Very easy to make, cut and serve. A few things I changed about the recipe are: I used King Hawaiian dinner rolls, I put mayo on the rolls before the ham/cheese/ham layers. before I put on the top layer of roll I brushed on the sauce.  I added 3 Tablespoons of creamy horseradish to the sauce and simply brushed the sauce all over the rolls. I made one batch of the sauce, but by brushing it on (generously) I still had enough sauce for 48 sandwiches.

Made these for a Superbowl party, and they were the one dish that completely disappeared! I ended up fitting 15 sandwiches in a 9x13 Pyrex pan. The only change I made was that I used 1/2 cup butter (based on others' suggestions) and I used a little powdered onion because I didn't have chopped. I made a mistake of waiting a little too long before putting the butter mixture over the rolls, and it was a little thick and sat on top of the sandwiches. It still turned out delicious, but I think it would have been better if I put the butter mixture on while the butter was all liquid.

Yum!  I made these for my husband for Superbowl half-time and we both really liked them.  I did as others suggested and covered with foil the first 10 min.  Misread the ingredients and did minced sweet onion instead of dry flakes, but otherwise followed the recipe.  Think I'll do these for my neighborhood potluck.  Thanks for posting.

Very good. But, I wish I hadn't listened to other reviews and just made it with regular dinner rolls. I used King's Hawaiian sweet rolls, and it was just way too sweet for me.

This is the recipe I use for these sandwiches as well. The only difference is that I also add a little bit of yellow mustard along with the dijon. I like to use the Martin's party size potato rolls. The sauce is enough for the entire pkg of 24, fyi. For easy clean-up, line baking dish with foil and top that with a piece of parchment so the bottoms of the rolls don't get too crunchy. I bake about 10 mins covered, then 10 more uncovered.

I have been making this recipe for years and love it.  I slice the entire pan of rolls in half, remove the top, brush both  cut sides with the butter  mixture  then layer ham, Swiss  cheese and ham on bottom layer.  Replace  entire top and brush with remaining butter mixture and cut through the rolls to make serving them easier after baking. .  Wrap in fol and bake as directed.

These were a hit at the Oktoberfest party we took them to--people are still talking about them months later! They're great for any event where you need to bring a dish and are short on time, because they're so easy to put together. I used Jarlsberg and Hawaiian rolls, and the combination of savory and sweet was fantastic. I've also tried them with a mix of turkey and ham, but I think all ham is better.

I've made these little sandwiches several times now. They always disappear! So delicious. I do 12 with ham and Swiss, the other 12 with roast beef and cheddar. My guests can't decide which they prefer.

My family loves these.  Sometimes we omit the onions and add 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  Try it!  You will love it!

Good recipe as written, but I prefer a couple changes. Like others mentioned, I add 1/4 c. brown sugar and double the Dijon and worchestire. I also add sauteed minced onions. After sauteeing the onions in 1/2 cup butter (not 3/4), I stir in the brown sugar, dijon and worcheshire. I spread 1/3 of this on top of the ham, then layer the cheese and tops of the rolls. Then, I mix the poppy seeds in the remaining butter/onion mix and spread on top.

11/28/17: Great way to use up those turkey leftovers! We don't care for poppy seeds, omitted and didn't miss them at all. Used a combo of swiss and provolone. I think any cheese would work. I made a little extra of the mixture. Coated bottom of pan as well as insides of buns, and then topped with remaining mixture. Used GF Ciabatta Rolls for me and hawaiian rolls (regular and jalapeno) for him. Yum! 1/2/16: Made this recipe twice now, using left over ham slices from New Year's. I love the ease of making this recipe especially when you don't feel like cooking. I didn't have any swiss cheese this time and ended up using provolone slices and the mini sandwich still tasted great! The mixture for on top of the rolls is tasty! Next time, I would like to make extra to also spread on the inside of the rolls. Thanks for the recipe!

These were a big hit. I finely chopped green onions/scallions instead of dried onion. In addition, I spread the butter and mustard mixture on the bottom on the bun. I made a head of time and then just heated for the party!

I have made these a few times for potlucks and they are always gone in minutes and everyone raves about them.  I omit the poppy seeds and substitute 1 tsp onion powder for the minced onions.  I also add 1 tsp garlic powder. I also cover with foil for the first ten minutes of baking, and uncover for the last ten minutes. Next time I will try the brown sugar as many have suggested!  This is a easy, fool proof main dish for any potluck or gathering...we're having them tonight for New Year's!

Made with wheat Hawaiian rolls with sharp cheddar cheese.  Also made them up ahead and time and put in refrigerator until ready to bake. They were a hit at our family gathering!

I found this recipe on Pinterest and gave it a try.  Very tasty!  I used the Hawaiian rolls and let the rolls sit in the fridge for a few hours after pouring the butter sauce on top.  I was skeptical about doing this, but it made it soooo good.  The bottom was buttery and flaky like a croissant.  This are an easy thing to make when entertaining.  I'm a fan!

Super easy and delicious recipe.  I did feel it was missing a little tang and added yellow mustard before eating.  A keeper!

I made a smaller batch of these (4) for just my husband and myself -I used butter, Worcestershire, brown sugar, onion powder, dried onions, yellow and whole grain mustard -melted it all in a pan and put it over the top and they were awesome!!!  I also substituted whole wheat buns and they held up great! We're excited to make them again for a party!

I love this recipe! It was easy and delicious.  I made half the pan with ham and Swiss AMD the other half with turkey and provolone.  Both were fantastic.  Thank you for sharing!

Made these for the first time and served them with Thanksgiving Brunch y'day.  They were so good, I 'm making them again today with more ham and turkey leftovers!  Just handy grab-n-go foods while there's still football going on all weekend!  Really glad I tried this recipe I'd by-passed so many times!  Will be so handy to grab from the freezer.  They say they freeze well.

Oh my!  These are so good!  Always use our leftover ham from the holidays to make.  Much better than using deli ham.

I made these using mini slider potato rolls and they were so delicious. I followed the recipe exactly but only baked for 13-15 minutes.   This will be a hit at our next party!

My boys loved this one. Didn't have dried onion flakes so used onion powder and also had no poppy seeds. We used Hawian sweet rolls which are loved in our house. Will defiantly make these again.

This was really easy and delicious, perfect for little hands with big appetites (: 
I mixed together melted butter, minced garlic and italian seasoning then poured that over the top. Really yummy. I also covered it with aluminum foil like others suggested. Perfection!

I wouldn't change a thing. These sandwiches were a huge hit for a small get together at my house. I did put the sandwiches into two 11x7 baking dishes, as there was no way that 24 rolls were going to fit into one 9x13 pan.  I baked these uncovered and I loved the the crusty tops . I was asked for the recipe and I will be making these again.

These are good and got lots of compliments. I don't know how these would fit in a 9x13 pan. I used a 10 1/2 x 15 1/2 and had to squeeze the last few rolls in.  I sauteed a couple tablespoons of fresh onion in the butter instead of dried onion. Also definitely want to start off the first 10-15 minutes of cook time covered with foil. And I used all of the sauce, I think any less and it wouldn't get all of the good flavor.

This was a big hit for a party yesterday! I made it only slightly different after reading some of the reviews. I added sesame seeds instead of poppy seeds because I had them and I added a tablespoon of brown surgar and twice as much mustard. I spread some of the mixture with a pastry  on the bottom and sides  of the glass pan then some on the inside of the rolls before the ham & cheese, then on tops and sprinkled more sesame seeds on the tops.  I poured the remaining mixture over the top and poked the seams of the rolls to allow what pooled to sink in. I refrigerated for an hour until guests arrived and baked at 350 covered for  15 min and uncovered for 10 min. They were perfect and everyone was eaten! Thanks for a great recipe Lisa !

I made two batches for a party.  The first pan was as the recipe stated using ham and a good quality Swiss.  The second pan I used turkey and Smoked Gouda.  Made the sauce for each just a recipe stated.  Both versions were a huge hit and my guests raved about these sandwiches while gobbling up both pans!  Will definitely be making this again, not just for parties or gatherings, but for dinner, too!

I just made these for my son's first birthday party. We had tons of food and these were the first to go. Even the picky eaters had their fill. I did however, make some changes.
I used the butter Hawaiian rolls instead of dinner rolls and the sauce covers 12, not 24. I did not use dried minced onion; I used minced garlic in olive oil, chopped onion, and granulated onion. I also use more Dijon mustard, but that's personal preference. With 1/2 pound thinly slice honey baked ham and 12 slices of muenster cheese it made a perfect and flavorful appetizer.
This can also be a comfort food, the sweetness of the bread and the savory spices bring it together.
I'm telling you, my party was half-filled with picky eaters and these puppies were gone.

These receive rave reviews at my parties and are requested again and again! Tip: use aluminum baking trays for easy cleanup (you know, the kind you throw away).

I've made this several times now. I always use 2 pkgs of Hawaiian sweet rolls and put the ham between slices of cheddar cheese on the top and bottom of ham so cheese holds the sandwich together. When I have spinach on hand I dice fresh spinach into tiny pieces and put it in with the ham to add a little extra veggies for my kids. Every time I make it they are eaten up and no leftovers. Great recipe!

I took a pkg of the Hawaiian rolls and cut the entire 16 in half in one piece and buttered the entire bottom and then brushed on honey mustard and placed ham and cheese slices on the 1/2 pkg then put the top half over and brushed with butter. Baked in 350 oven for about 15 min to get cheese melting and rolls somewhat browned. I served about 70 people for Vacation Bible School and kids alike with leaders gobbling them up. Only problem was cutting them into individual sandwiches without smooshing them.

I always use Hawaiian rolls, the flavor is awesome with all the ingredients.  This is definitely an appetizer to take to a party and it is wonderful.  Only thing different no poppy seeds on hand, I am sure they would just put the recipe over the top.  I also put some of the sauce on each roll before the meat and cheese, then on top of roll with a basting brush, love the flavor of the sauce. Make sure to follow tip above and use aluminum foil to keep moist.

Great appetizer dish. Used smoked gouda and apple wood smoked ham. I minced one yellow onion and sautéed it in the butter with the Dijon mustard and Worcestershire sauce. Then I took my onions butter mix and spread it as my first layer, then the meat, then the cheese. I took some mayo(which was the original recipe from King's Hawaiian website) and spread it on the top bun. The smoked gouda and apple wood tasted a lot better than the swiss. Give it a try! For the top I melted butter and used the onion powder and poured it over the top :)Yummy.

This was DELICIOUS.  My husband and I are vegetarians and I subsitituted fake ham (Yves Veggie Cuisine brand) and it was delicious.  Our meat-eating friends thought it was delicious, too!

I made these the first time with leftover spiral ham.  I wanted these for dinner so I used good large buns and cut the butter back probably in half but otherwise followed the recipe.  My family loved them.  The second time I used deli black forest ham.  Much better with the leftover spiral ham.

I just made these today, but used leftover chuck roast, sauteed mushrooms, green onions and garlic in the butter, the layered the bottom bread, roast beef, mushrooms/onions, provolone cheese, topped with bread, then poured rest of butter over the top.  It's in the fridge right now.  Going to bake it tonight.  Forgot the Worcestershire sauce and mustard, but with the flavors of the mushrooms, onions and garlic sauteed into the butter, I don't think I'll miss it.

So delicious!  Made them for my New Years party and they were a smash. A gluten free version was particularly well received. 
Add a dash of horseradish... The tang takes it to a whole new level!

Long ago we had something very similar to this at a baby shower. The only difference was it was on the Sunbeam dinner rolls in the little trays. I made them again through Thanksgiving and used the small dinner rolls,and they we're wonderful. The advantage to this is no pan, no cleanup. I also think the ingredients can be modified to fit your taste, or whatever you have on hand.

I tried this recipe and brought to a party.  I switched the ham for pastrami.  Was  HUGE hit.  Sooo easy and very tasty.  If you are going to a  party I would not pour the topping on until it is ready to go into the oven.  Worth every bite!

This was so good! I brushed the bottom layer of Hawaiian rolls with the butter before layering the ham and cheese then I added a layer of cole slaw!  I poured the remaining butter over the cole slaw, covered with top buns and foil then finished in the oven. Yum!

Oops! I used horseradish instead of worcestershire sauce! I have never used either sauce for anything, so when i went out to buy it, i made a mistake. But it was a good mistake because it tasted very good and everyone loved it! It tasted like there was a little mayo on it.

I added a little more mustard and a little less poppy seed. I covered in foil for 20 min.  Then uncovered for 10 min.  Made for my bunco group and the ladies loved them. Quick, easy and delicious.

My family loves these! I'm sure they would make great party food but I've been making them to have as a quick dinner on busy weeknights.  I make them ahead of time so that when we get home after a game we can pop them in the oven.  Pair them with a side salad or a nice soup and you've got a kid/teen pleasing meal.  I follow the recipe exactly except for maybe decreasing the amount of butter a little bit.  My kids love them with cheddar cheese but adults prefer swiss cheese.

Simple, easy and delicious! Made it for the first time last night for a women's group as we were about to dismiss someone said hold up first I have to know who made the sliders?!  It was awesome! I made a few small changes. I omitted the poppy seeds, used I Can't believe It's Not Butter and I used provolone cheese instead of swiss

This is a great recipe! The changes would make: 1) Use the traditional Sunbeam dinner rolls--the sauce absorbs better into the bread, and you can bake them in the pan provided too! 2) Use less butter--I think 1/2 Cup would be plenty so it's not so oily/greasy 3) Possibly? Pour 1/2 of sauce over sandwiches before adding the top bread, then pour the rest over the top

The first time I made this I halved the recipe for a quick game night meal and my family loved it.  The second time I made the whole recipe for a finger food social at church and had people complain because they only got one roll.  Needless to say I will be making this again.  I used Hawaiian rolls which my family loves and followed the recipe as written except for the poppy seeds which my husband doesn’t like.  This is an easy recipe that I would highly recommend.

These were a huge hit at my Christmas Eve party.  They are really easy to make and freaking addicting to eat!!  Honestly I thought there was too much poppy but that's just me, no one else agreed with me.  Really awesome recipe when you're having a gathering or going to one!  THANKS!

Oh my gosh whats not to love!! I made these as a quick and easy dinner after getting home from work later than usual and man am I glad I made these! They are OUTSTANDING! My only change was I used Spicy brown mustard (1.5 tbs) and also added honey mustard (1.5 tbs). I also lightly heated the ingredients in a pan together before I poured it over the top of the buns. AMAZING! These will be my next party food as well as dinner!

These were good!  I will make them again.  I didn't have minced onion on hand so I used onion powder and I omitted the poppy seeds because I didn't have them either.  I used 1 tsp of worcestershire sauce instead of 1-1/2 tsp.  I used thick sliced brown sugar ham and hawaiian rolls. I think there needs to be a little sweeter taste to the sauce though.  Very good though!!!

I used jenny-o turkey/ham and sliced it thin.  Still amazing and you would never tell the difference.  I also finely chopped some white onion and added it to the mix.  Amazing.

I have made these several times for many different occasions and they are ALWAYS a hit!  Using the Hawaiian roles gives them just the little sweetness to balance out the mustard.  I get several requests for the recipe and when people find out how simple they are to make they are surprised.  I have added red roasted peppers to the toppings for a little added color and texture also.

Easy and delicious.  We had some pretzel slider rolls so I used those and I didn't have any Dijon mustard so I had to use regular yellow.  They were good but I bet they would be FABULOUS with the Dijon.  Definitely recommend that you give it a try.

Wow.  Even better than expected and so easy.  We  made these for New Years and then again on New Years Day.  Used the sweet Hawiian rolls that most other reviewers used and would definitely use the same again.  Used a little extra dijon mustard in the butter mixture and would do so again.  Delicious!  Thanks!!

These were fantastic.  The only thing I will do next time is to use a bit less meat and cheese.  I made half ham and half turkey.
