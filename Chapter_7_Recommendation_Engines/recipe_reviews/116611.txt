I had to make this recipe several times before I got it just right.  Here is what I did and I recommend these changes highly!  Use Duncan Heinz Pineapple Supreme cake mix with water instead of the yellow cake mix with pineapple juice.  It is so much better.  Use Texas Muffin pans sprayed liberally with cooking spray.  Double the topping recipe of brown sugar and butter.  Use whole pineapple rings and press them down into the muffin cups but make sure they are level so they don't make your cakes look lopsided.  Put the cherries in before cooking.  Just press them down into the middle of the pineapple ring.  Bake as directed.  Take them out of the oven and let them sit for exactly 5 minutes so the topping can cool a bit, otherwise it will all run off.  No more than 5 minutes or they will stick.  Run a knife around the edge of the cakes and invert.  Make sure you put foil under the cooling rack as this is really messy when the butter/brown sugar topping starts to run.  By allowing them to cool for 5 minutes, most of the topping will stay on.  These are wonderful and so cute!  I served them at a Bunko party and they were a big hit!

I made these for my brother's birthday and they were a huge hit. I used jumbo muffin tins which accommodated my self-made tidbit rings nicely.  I also used pineapple cake mix sans pineapple juice (so I could drink it myself while baking, of course!) and added a bit of rum to the glaze since that's how I roll.

I just finished serving these, and with the advice of other cooks, made them an incredible sucess. I used the pineapple cake mix and followed the box instructions on it, using water instead of the pineapple juice in the original recipe. I am glad we did this, otherwise it would have been too sweet. I used a whole marischino cherry on the top of each...stem in to create height. I also made a delicious black cherry sauce and drizzled it over them. Absolutely will make these over and over. Too easy and absolutely delicious. I also used the muffin pans instead, making the pineapple slices fit perfectly. Thank you for sharing this! YUM!

These are extremely yummy and are a very "cute" dessert - great for entertaining.  You don't need to trim the pineapple rings - just push them down so they slope slightly up the sides of the cup.  You can also put the cherry in the middle before you pour the batter on top.  It makes the whole recipe even easier!

Very pretty dessert.  I used a jumbo muffin pan and used the pineapple rings.  If you do the same, you will also need a 8 oz. can of pineapple rings.  There weren't enough pineapple rings in the 20 oz. can for 14 jumbo muffins. I used pineapple cake mix and the juice from the canned pineapple rings.  There wasn't enough juice from the pineapple rings so I used water to make up the difference.

I love this recipe!! I made these for a bake sale & they were the first items to go--even before the chocolate!!  I recommend using pineapple tidbits--they're easier to form the rings.  I also sprayed my paper muffin cups with cooking spray & had no trouble getting the goodies out.  They tasted great!

I made these to take to work.  I am very pleased.  I used the pineapple tidbits like suggested, and placed the cherry half upside down in the butter/brown sugar mixture, then surrounded by the pineapple. I also loosened around each cake with a knife before inverting. They are very moist. You will love them!!!

the presentation was wonderful, however the taste was too sweet!, and plain. i made 12 jumbo cupcakes and 1 20 oz pineapple was enough.  i also made this with pillsbury mix and only required 1 cup of juice/water.  if you're using betty crocker, use 1 & 1/4 (just as the recipe calls for); for dh, i believe it's 1 & 1/3.  then again... look for another recipe, and use the same cupcake concept.  -- UPDATE (5 minutes later) -- i did a brief research on similar cakes and one of the recipe called for cinnamon in the batter.  i've already baked the cake so i sprinkled the cinnamon on top.  it was TASTY!  so... keeping that in mind, i'll probably be making this again :).

i chose this recipe because i had a white cake mix begging to be used. so obviously, i omitted the yellow mix. i used fresh pineapple, which now that i've tasted it, probably wouldn't make a difference if you used canned, but i just LOVE fresh! i also put the cherries in the pineapple in one pan, and followed the recipes instructions on the other pan, and either way is good. the best thing about this recipe is the size!!!! i think the size is perfect for pineapple upside down cakes. prefect individual sizes, everyone gets some pineapple and a cherry. it was a very forgiving recipe. this has made my own recipe book and will be making it several times in the future! took the other posters advice about rum for my alcoholic friends, but i just poured some captain morgan over the chilled cakes and let it soak in. many compliments!

Hubby just said "That was excellent!" for the 4th time and I have to agree!  The pineapple flavor is throughout the cake.  When the timer went off, my reaction was to blurt out "OMG wait 'till you see this!".  I used two jumbo muffin pans, filling them evenly with no left-over batter.  They took 23 minutes to bake.  They did not overflow.  I used Duncan Hines Moist Deluxe Pineapple Supreme cake mix and a hand held electric mixer to mix.  I experimented with a whole cherry on some and a half cherry on others.  The appearance was the same since only half the cherry shows.  With the jumbo muffin pan, I suggest using a whole cherry for more flavor.  My choice was to add them prior to cooking.  I read the reviews before making and the best suggestion was to use parchment paper on top of the cooling rack.  I didn't do it at first but when I realized I couldn't flip the cakes and they were starting to stick, I immediately put parchment paper on a rack and moved them.  Next time I will turn them out on the cooling rack topped with parchment paper.  Thank you Cindy Colley for such an easy EXCELLENT recipe!  Now to go hide them so they'll be around for the dinner party!........UPDATE...I froze a couple in a zip lock bag to see how they would hold up if made ahead of time.  They were as good as the day I made them.   Perfect!

Beautiful & Delicious! USE PINEAPPLE TIDBITS is a must! That way when you bite/fork the mini cakes you'll ALWAYS have a piece of pineapple & cake, easier to eat. Made this several times, took several batches to a family party & it was a hit the first dessert to go I mean gone & people were asking if theres more. Heres what I did. Sprayed pan with Butter Pam. Used yellow butter mix (thats what I had on hand). Used 1 20oz. can tidbits instead of slices. Followed cake mix on box but also used juice from the tidbit can & added water to make up liquid required in mix. Spooned about 2 tsps butter/sugar in greased pan, laid 4-5 tidbits in a ring pattern then spooned 1-2 tsp batter, then added 1 chopped smaller tidbits into each batter then spooned batter over it. Baked perfectly in 20 min.

My only arguement is that it's a big recipe. My muffin tin made 6, so that's all I made, then used the rest of the batter to make a dozen cupcakes. Very delicious and will keep for dinner parties in the future!

I made this recipe for my Mother's Day celebration today, and all the ladies loved it! It gets a little messy when you invert the cakes after baking, because the pineapple juice leaks. But the taste was delicious. It was light and not overly sweet. I put the cherries in the sugar mixture before baking, like I would with a regular sized upside down cake. I am definitely adding this to my recipe book.

So good and yummy smelling!  Made these for a school event.  They disappeared in a flash!  Made as is but added a touch of vanilla to the batter. Had to cut rings in 8ths to fit - cute and actually made it easier to eat at the event as people used plastic forks - no fruit to cut thru.  Thanks for the recipe!

YUMMY!!! I made these for a special occasion and I'm having a hard time keeping out of them! The suggestions I followed by previous reviewers: waited the 5 minutes before inverting onto a parchment-covered cooling rack...I think that's important because they might stick to the cooling rack without the parchment paper. I also ran a knife around the edges as they cooled in the pan those 5 minutes. As far as cutting the pineapple to fit my regular-size muffin tray, I did not find that to be too time consuming at all. I used my kitchen shears to snip a chunk of each pineapple-probably snipped about 1/3 off each piece. The pineapple slice will look like the letter "C." Then you just place the slice in the muffin tin and bring the ends together. Easy! I dropped the cherry in before baking as well. Other than that I followed everything else according to the recipe. These are wonderful, I'm so happy to have tried this recipe. I will most definitely be making these again....maybe for Mother's Day in a few days! :)

I make these a lot.  Great flavor.  They look like you bought them.  Make sure to flip your pan over on a cookie sheet as soon as they come out of the oven.  Let them sit for 5 minutes and remove pan.  Mine come out perfect every time.

Fun and delicious.  I made these easier by using chopped pineapple.  Then there is no need to cut the rings to fit the tin.  They are also easier to eat, again, no cutting.  These turned out perfectly, everyone at the party loved them.

SOOO Good! I doubled the brown sugar and butter. Used Duncan pineapple cake mix (followed the recipe on the box). I took both the cherries and pineapple and put them in the food processor for a few pulses. Here's how I layered it in a liberally greased muffin tin: brown sugar mix, cherries, pineapple, cake mix. When they were done baking, I left them in the tin for about 3 mins, then I flipped them over to cool on a cooling rack. I served them in a baking cup.

Made this recipe using Duncan Hines Pineapple Supreme mix and the pineapple juice from the pineapple slices.  Sprayed Jumbo muffin tins with cooking oil prior to filling tins.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar with the 1/3 cup of butter, softened.  Used Jumbo muffin tins (coated) and therefore, lowered the temperature to 325 degrees and baked for about 28 minutes.   By using 1/4 cup of batter in each muffin, the result was 20 jumbo cakes.  I lined 2 cookie sheets with wax paper and lightly sprayed with oil.  Upon removing from oven, I inverted onto the cookie sheets and  added cherries after inverting!  Next time, I will make sure the cherries are completely dry as some of the red coloring bled into the pineapple.  Cleanup was a breeze! Delicious!  Everyone enjoyed and will make again!

Next time- I will be sure to grease my muffin tins well- these stuck and were difficult to get out which harmed presentation.  The flavor, however, was good.  Thanks for sharing!

I get rave reviews on these every single time! They are super moist and delicious! I prefer to use the large size muffin pans. It is more time consuming to use the standard size because you have to cut the pineapple rings to fit them in the cups. With the large muffin tin the rings fit right in. I double the brown sugar and butter mixture. The cakes seem to come out moister and sweeter. I also use the pineapple cake mix and do 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup of pineapple juice since the batter is already pineapple flavored.

These are AWESOME!  Very easy to make.  I used Duncan Hines Pineapple Supreme cake mix.  I used 1 1/3 c. water (not the reserved juice) as stated on the box, not the recipe here.  I used pineapple rings and just cut out a notch to make them fit.  They look fine.  I used my Pampered Chef stoneware muffin pan generously sprayed with Pam.  I inverted the cakes onto a parchment lined wooden cutting board immediately after baking.  I had no problem with sticking.  Just had to jiggle the pan a little.  I had some cake batter left over and some pieces of pineapple, so I made a new batch of brown sugar and butter (the BEST invention on Earth!) and assembled an additional cake in a glass pie plate.  These little cakes are perfect for bake sales, showers or when serving guests in your home.  I'm going to see how they freeze cuz I'd like to pull one out of the freezer now and then as a tea-time treat.  Yummy!!!

Very good recipe, although I was lazy and used a 9x13 pan.  I used pineapple tidbits plus the cherries and when I turned it over, it looked like stained glass.  Beautiful!  It is best warm.

I used "Simple White Cake" on this website instead of the cake mix.  Very tasty and cute.

Tasty little cakes.....Couldnt be more simple. I used pineapple tidbits in place of the rings due to them not fitting properly in the muffin tin I had. I also place the cherry on before baking. Pretty to look at and better to eat!!!

This was yummy.  Made them for a bridal shower.  Wish the pineapples were smaller to fit the little cakes or the cakes were bigger to fit the pineapples.  That was the most time consuming part- trying to make them look as pretty as they do on some of these pictures.

These turned out amazing! So cute and they went very very quickly...I think I overfilled some of the cups because they were a little bit rounded but other than that, it was fantastic! (and that was my fault....)

These were so easy and so cute. I loved that the pineapple kind of curved over the edges when I used the pineapple rings. The only problem I had was that I made them the day before a party and by the time we ate them they had gotten slightly soggy. Definitely not something you can make too far in advance.

I loved these little guys, and they were a hit at the Labor Day lunch I took them to. I put the cherries in with the brown sugar and pineapple. Since I was using regular cupcake pans I couldn't get the pineapple rings to fit very well, so I ended up quartering each ring, then putting two quarters at the bottom of each cupcake ring opposite each other. Worked perfectly! I also used 3/4 cup pineapple juice and 1/2 cup water, instead of the 1 1/4 cups pineapple juice, so the batter was sweet, but not overly so. I think they turned out perfect, and with these updates will definitely make them again!

Wow! These were absolutely incredible! Definitely 5 Stars for the Taste. Making them, however, was a bit of a Hassle I must say. It wasn't really clear how much of the Butter/brown Sugar Mixture to put in the Bottom of each Muffin Cup. I guess I put in too much because I didn't have enough, had to basically double what the Recipe said. Then it also didn't say what Size of Muffin Pan to use, but from one of the submitted Pictures I assumed they were the "big ones". I only have one of those Muffin Pans and they only hold 6.  It was a lengthy Progress, had to re-use the same Muffin Pan 3 times.  This Recipe made 17 Mini Cakes for me.

I should have read the advice of previous reviews.  I made these exactly as the recipe stated and was not a fan.  I put three pineapple chunks in each one and there wasn't enough cake, it was just sugared pineapple.  They did look adorable, but there needs to be more cake to each one.

Turned out perfect and soo yummy!  I used 1 cup brown sugar and 1 stick of butter.  It was just enough for 24 cupcakes.  I cut my pineapple rings up because they just seemed too big to put in whole.  3 pieces per cupcake was perfect.  I didnt put the cherry on until after the fact.  Let them cook exactly 5 minutes when you take them out and run a knife around them.  They all came out perfect.  I also added 1/2 t cinnamon to the batter...loved it!!

Scrumptious, very nice! It was kinda tricky getting them out of the muffin pan, though.  Any tips/tricks on that, anyone?  Some of pineapple pieces were coming off and such.

making this recipe was pure comedy, but the cupcakes that survived did turn out very cute and were much appreciated at our island-themed party! 

i used two regular cupcake/muffin pans as the recipe described... cut 1/4 out of the pineapple ring so it would condense into a smaller circle... cut the cherries in half and put them in before baking. 

just make sure your pans are well greased and loosen them with a knife after letting them cool a bit before you flip them! hehe

next time i'll try them with a homemade cake batter instead of the pineapple cake mix.

mmmm, Just like Mom used to make, only in mini's. the serving portion is nice but next time I'm gonna try the larger texas size for an entire pineapple ring to fit. I only used 1 20 oz can and cut them up into pieces or small chunks. When they first come out ot the oven, be careful turning the pan over that upir cakes don't spill out- the topping is juice unitl it sets. Maybe use a knife around the edges, then flip and let rest without removing pan for for at least 5 minutes. Perfect crowd pleaser.

This is a 5 for flavor and a four because of the fussiness of this. it would be great if they came out of the pan by themselves.
What I did is use a butter yellow cake mix since homemade upsidedown cake has butter in the batter. I pureed the cut off parts of the pineapple and used it and pineapple juice to make the liquid needed for the recipe. I also used whole cherries which was easier than cutting them in half. Taste and presentation make up for the hassle of having yo use a knife on each one. Whith my leftover batter I made mini muffins with 1/2 of a cherry and one tidbit of pineapple. They are good, but don't look as good as the big ones. By letting the kids snack on the mini the big ones might last till dessert time.

I made these for different dinner parties during the holidays, and they were a hit!  To say the least, these little dessert treats stole the lime light away from the pumpkin pie during Thanksgiving. :)  I took the advice of other reviewers and used pineapple upside down cake mix, versus yellow cake mix.  I also put the cherries in the middle of the pineapple before baking.  Turned out wonderful, and will be using again in the future.  My pineapple loving boyfriend gave them two thumbs up!

I needed something pretty for my daughter's college graduation party and found this recipe. I bought jumbo muffin pans so the pineapple rings would fit. I used the pineapple juice with the pineapple cake mix and didn't find it too sweet. The pineapple lovers loved them!

I altered this a bit as I only had fresh pineapple on hand.  I chopped the pineapple into small bits and added it to the butter brown sugar mix.  Then made as directed.  These are so good!  Very moist!  Will make again.

I'm not a huge fan of this cake but these individual servings were so moist and wonderful.  The only thing I did different was using crushed pineapple instead of sliced.

I used the other reviewer's suggestion of using pineapple cake mix and water rather than the reserved juice. I put the cherry into the middle of the pineabpple before pouring the batter over. I also added coconut to a batch and some rum to another batch. Cooking time was closer to 25-30 minutes for me, and this recipe made 36 cakes.

These are so incredibly cute!  I used the Pineapple Cake mix along with water instead of the pineapple juice.  However, I used crushed pineapple instead of the ring and Hubby said it was easier to eat and held together better.  Left them in the pan for 5 minutes, then flipped them over. Perfect!  I can't wait to make these for a family gathering.

Wasn't impressed. I'm a big fan of pineapple upside down cake and these fell short of my expectations. Maybe because I'm partial to my moms homemade from scratch version.. which is declicious and sweet and the cake is drenched in brown sugar/butter flavor. The presentation of these were cute.. and they tasted sort of like the real thing... it just wasn't something I'd rave about or try again. I actually made these to take to party, and ended up leaving them at home =(

I agree with other reviewers, just use plain yellow cake mix and water instead of pineapple mix and juice. The rum addition in my opinion is a great idea and only adds to the depth of flavor. One note that I don't think any one has mentioned, if using the regular sized muffin tins don't worry about filling the cups too high, they don't overflow like you think they would! I ended up using about 2-3 tablespoons of mix in each cup topping off the pineapple bottom. Definitely a keeper! I put mine on slightly spread out metal muffin wrappers so people wouldn't need forks or small plates!

I've been making pineapple upside down cake for over thirty years.  I learned a super easy recipe in home ec in the 7th grade.  I wanted something different and just adore the concept of mini individual cakes.  I followed the suggestion of others... used pineapple cake mix and left out the pineapple juice.  I didn't fuss with slices and went for crushed instead.  Plus I put the cherry in the bottom of each cup before layering and baking.  I decided to use giant "Texas" size muffin tins, which increased the cooking time to about 34 minutes, and yielded 16 cakes.   Just an FYI, instead of mixing the butter and brown sugar together, I simply divided the butter between all the muffin cups, then added about 3/4 of a table spoon of brown sugar to each cup.  My 23 year old daughter just tried one and said it was AWESOME!  In the future, I will make the individuals instead of the whole cake.  Big kudos for posting this!

These were very easy to make.  I used the regular size cupcake tins and didn't find the trimming of the pineapple rings to be time-consuming.  I stacked several on each other and cut through them together, taking out about 1/3 of the ring to use to piece together the last few.  I used 1/2 cherry for each cupcake and it fit perfectly.  I let them cool for five minutes as another reviewer suggested and they tipped out very easily.  They were a mess, to be sure, but looked cute.  I thought they were delicious out of the oven, but didn't hold up well for the next day because they were too soggy by then.

These were GREAT!! I made it exactly as its listed and it came out wonderful! The only things I might change next time are #1 3 cans of sliced pineapple, I was about 4 slices short for the full 24 cupcakes.  #2 will use muffin tins instead of cupcake tins next time, there wasnt much room for the batter and I think you'd get more 'cake' with the slightly larger muffin tin #3 I would cover the wire cooling rack with wax paper or parchment paper. They did stick to the rack a little bit.   Now don't get me wrong, these were EXCELLENT the way they are, these were just minor adjustments.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Made for a bakesale and they sold right away! Made in large muffin tin, trimmed pineapple to fit and put cherry in ring before baking. Waited 5 minutes before inverting to remove from pan per previous reviews is a must. I trialed it and it really makes a difference. Thanks for recipe!

Very cute and very easy.  We have a few diabetics in our family, so I used the Splenda brown sugar blend and Pillsbury reduced sugar yellow cake mix.  No one could tell the difference.  Great recipe!

I made these for Easter and everyone loved them! I doubled the brown sugar and butter mixture, used regular sized muffin tins, cut a piece out of the pineapple ring rather than cutting the edges off because it was easier, used pineapple cake mix with 1/2 water 1/2 pineapple juice, and used pitted bing cherries since the store ran out of maraschinos. When I make these again, I will try using large muffin tins so I don't have to cut the pineapple, which would make a nicer presentation and less prep time.

I put the mix in 6 mini-bunt pans. The mix made 12 mini cakes. They were finished in 18 minutes instead of the 20 that was recommended.    They were delicious and moist! The whole family loved them!

I made these for our family's easter dinner and they were a huge hit. I used crushed pineapple, put some of the pineapple juice in the cake mix and used canned sweet cherries mixed with a little extra sugar and vanilla (the store was out of maraschino cherries). I also added just a wee bit more butter to both the cake mix and the brown sugar mix. These will definitely become family get-together standards.

So easy, so delicious and so cute!! You will be 4 pineapples short if you just use the 2 cans recipe calls for. I just used the trimmings from the other pineapples to fill the other 4 cups. This is a keeper!!

Tasted fine to me. Had to adjust the amount of brown sugar/butter mix I put in the bottom since it didnt say. Chunks didnt work out as well,used rings and just took out section,they curled right down into the pan. Had leftover batter after I made 18 muffins so I just made up more brown sugar/butter, put in small pan with rest of the pineapple and poured batter on top.All in all pretty tasty and everyone gets cake and fruit this way.

We made these this weekend for our Girl Scout Hawaiian Days and they were a great hit. They are even good the next morning cold. :) We did two things different. We used crused Pineapple and no cherry. They were so pretty and so good.

I had a hard time getting these cakes out of the pan.  I did use crushed pineapple instead of sliced, that may be part of the problem.  Next time I'll try sliced pineapple.  The cakes were still super yummy!!

I used pineapple cake mix instead of yellow and it was very good. I had no trouble removing the cakes, I use baker's Spray with flour. It was very moist. I served them on china saucers and I did not cut the cherry in half to enhance the height of the treat.

I made these for my sons last day of school luau.  Very easy to make, very moist. I would have liked more of a pineapple taste in the cake. Next time I will find a pineapple cake to use instead. I cut the pineapple rings into 4's and used 2 per cupcake.  The cherry fit perfectly in the middle.  Will make again!

Excellent idea! I actually made my cake rom scratch as I had no cake mix on hand, but loved this idea. I used pineapple chunks instead-- one to a cup-- and no cherries (we don't like them), and it was perfect. Note: The brown sugar can caramelize into a hard candy-like shell if it spills over onto the muffin pan... be sure to remove this right away after turning onto the rack. These will be part of the dessert table at my wedding-- but this time, using cake mix! Thanks!

I really like this recipe. The only changes I made was to use a bit more brown suger/butter mixture and place the cherries in before baking. Oh, and I made them in cupcake pans, not larger muffin pans. It made about 28 cupckes and they were delish!!! Recevied many compliments. They are best served within a few hours of making. Oh, and I only needed one can of pineapple rings that I ended up cutting into chuncks. Be sure to spray the pan with Pam first to ensure they pop right out. This one is a keeper.

Followed recipe exactly and loved these.  They were so moist!  I'm going to try adding some coconut rum to my next batch to see if I can make them taste like pina coladas.

I definitely did something wrong, and it could be because of my changes, but they were still delicious. I baked them in a regular-sized cupcake tin. I used pineapple chunks - 4 to each cup - and only had two left, so it was the perfect size. They took exactly 20 mins @ 350 for the cake to be done, but when I inverted them, the brown sugar was still grainy. Maybe next time I'll warm it with the butter in a saucepan before putting it in the cupcake tins, so the sugar is dissolved. They were still delicious, and very easy! :) Yes, I made some changes to the recipe, and I know people hate when a recipe is rated with changes, but it was only because I was working with what I had on hand. Rather than cake mix I used Bisquick Light, and used the pineapple juice rather than milk or water to make the batter. I also added some cinnamon, I didn't measure, just sprinkled some in. I'm sure it is delicious either way! Thank you Cindy!

WOW!  This was a fabulous recipe.  I did make some modification only because I HAD to.  

I double the brown sugar and butter topping as suggested by another reviewer and worked out very well.  I also used DH Golden Butter cake mix.  Its what I had on hand and I used crushed pineapple versus ring.  Since I used a Golden Butter Cake mix; I added pineapple jello to the mix to make sure I had that pineapple taste.  And it worked out beautifully.  This recipe is a keeper. Thank you.

Really good, but it takes more time than making it regular size... which is fine if you have time to do it.  I used pineapple cake mix and it turned out glorious!  Will make again, but most likely use a full size cake pan.

This is an amazing recipe that I will use over and over. The only thing I suggest is to use the pineapple tibbits instead of trying to cut the pineapple slices down. These are great you get just the right amount of goodness in every bite!

I made these as the dessert for a Christmas dinner one year.  I did not have jumbo sized muffin pans as that seemed like a good idea another reviewer had suggested, so I just worked with what I had.  Trimming the pineapple was a little bit of a pain in the you-know-what, but worth it.  I tried a couple with crushed pineapple and they didn't look as nice.  I also followed the suggestion to go by the directions on the cake box instead of using the pineapple juice because I felt it would be too sweet for my taste.  All in all, they were very pretty, tasted awesome, and everyone loved having their own little dessert.  Cute, easy idea.  Thanks!

If I could give more than 5 stars I would! Fantastic! The second time I made these  I did a few minor changes, like crushed pineapple instead of rings, white cake instead of yellow, & I baked with the cherry instead of adding it afterwards. Turned out amazing! They were gonein the blink of an eye! Definitely a keeper!

I used Large Porcelain Ramekins and they were perfect size. I wish I had more of them. I also suggest serving these right away, and in the ramekins they are the perfect individual size, and I don't really feel the need to turn them upside down, so it will keep more of the sauce. Used Pineapple cake mix, and water instead of pineapple juice. Next time I will pass on the Marachino Cherries. Read the label and they are FULL of sugar and high fructose corn syrup. The cake mix I can deal with for the convenience. :)

DELICIOUS! I used the large muffin stoneware pan from pampered chef. Brushed the pan with vegetable oil. I put the butter brown sugar mixture in the bottom of each cup followed by  pineapple rings and a cherry. I cut the pinapple rings in 1/4 and used two 1/4 slices in the bottom or each one. I then Duncan Hines Pineapple cake mix and used the directions on the box.  Baked according to this recipe 350 for 20 minutes. I allowed them to cool for 5 minutes then inverted onto a wax paper lined cooling rack.

I made these for a work birthday party. They were gone in minutes. Everyone raved about them and made a fuss over how cute they were. I highly recommend making these for any gathering. They will be the star of the show. I followed advice of other reviewers, using pineapple cake mix and jumbo muffin tins.

One of my VERY favorite desserts - made into mini's!  Why didn't I ever think of that?  I used crushed pineapple because I had most of a can leftover from another recipe.  Very easy to make, great way to serve.  Don't know that I'll ever make a full cake again.  Thanks Cindy for a fun recipe.

I use the mini pineapple upside down pan (Nordic Ware-Wm.Sonoma).  I love the cakes and the pan makes them so much cuter. It's not messy or sticky because you don't have to bother with cutting the pineapple.

This was such a fun idea! I thought I had yellow cake mix on hand but didn't, only had strawberry mix. I had already had the oven preheating, butter/brown sugar mixed up, and everything out on the counter so I used what I had. Next time I will make just a wee bit more of the brown sugar mixture since I barely had enough to put into each cupcake hole --and I was skimpy with all of them. Plus, this makes about 3 dozen since the pineapple parts take up so much room in the cups. I baked a whole cherry with the stem as suggested by another reviewer in one of the dozen and I preferred those better than just a half. Also, added a teaspoon of pancake syrup with the brown sugar/butter mixture because I had read somewhere it will help with getting rid of the grittiness of the brown sugar...and it worked great! Needs just a few minutes to cool down so they can be flipped on to a flat pan. FYI, the strawberry cake mix was delish with this recipe ... I used Better Homes & Garden cupcake pan from Walmart and for the first time in my entire life, the cupcakes slipped out without any problems whatsoever! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!! I look forward to making more of these babies!!  =)

My chef's favorite dessert is Upside-Down Pineapple Cake.  When I saw this recipe and read all the reviews, I thought I might be able to impress him with this one.  As it turns out, I did.  The presentation is adorable and taste is incredible. I used the large muffin pans and cut a small chunk out of the ring to make it fit.  I also added the cherries before baking.  Will make this recipe again and again.

These came out great!  The kids couldn't get enough of them, and are even ready for me to make them again!  I used the Pineapple Supreme cake mix with water instead of juice.  We used jumbo muffin tins for a more personal dessert.

Wonderful!  These came out so nice and very tasty.  Like some others, I also cut a section out of the pineapple rings and put the cut ends together for a perfect fit in the muffin cups.  I will definitely make these again.  Thank you for a great new way to make an upside-down cake.

Really good and so easy!  Used the jumbo muffin pans and recipe yielded 12.  By just cutting one side of the pineapple ring, I could fit the ring in the pan and then trim a small amount of excess and it fit perfectly.  Perfect to put in my son's lunch for his birthday tomorrow.

Were perfect when made in jumbo muffin cups and with added cinnamon and doubled the syrup topping. Also subbed applesauce for oil. Were absolutely fantastic little cakes! Made about 14 jumbo muffins with 1 recipe. Nutrition: 355 cals per jumbo muffin.

I made these for Easter. Used the pineapple juice for the water. These turned out great. Beautifully displayed on a platter. I will definitely make these again. Couldn't be any easier. In fact easier than flipping over a pan. I would serve sweetened whipped cream with each one.

This recipe is great!  It's so moist and delicious and everyone gets pineapple AND a cherry :) It's also basically foolproof - I even ran out of pineapple rings and just used the leftover bits (from trimming the rings) to fill the empty cups and they were still pretty.  It is semi-tedious to trim the rings, but if you have giant muffin tins the rings fit in as-is.

These were delicious, but I only gave it 4 stars because of the pain in the butt time it took to cut the pineapple rings!  By the time I was done I was wishing I had just made a regular Pineapple Upside Down Cake.  BUT - everyone loved the mini cakes at the potluck I brought them to!

The recipe could have clearer directions, but all in all it was a good end product.  I need to rewrite instructions so it's easier.  I did everything in order, but it was too tricky with doing the cake mix and getting the pineapple juice and juggling the melted butter and brown sugar.  I think next time I'll do everything in reverse, beginning with the cake mix and ending with the butter/sugar combo.

These little cakes were so easy to make, and they were a hit at our Holiday Progressive dinner in our neighborhood.  I trimmed the pineapple slices like the recipe said, and they fit perfectly.  I also added the cherry before baking.  There are only 10 slices of pineapple in a 20 oz. can, so I added 2 slices from a small can of pineapples. Thanks Cindy for a wonderful recipe.

It has been a while since I made these, and I doubt I followed the recipe exactly (I almost never do); but I do remember that they were a big hit! I took them to the office for a co-workers birthday and they were easy to transport and everyone loved them!

Great recipe. Tasted just like the original. I did not have jumbo muffin tins though - so make sure you put tin foil or something under the pan - it ran over a little and made a stinky mess in my oven. I did 12 regular cupcake sized ones. I cut out one section of the pineapple rings and they fit perfectly. With the remainder of the batter chopped the pineapple and put them in my mini muffin pans - worked great. Just make sure you flip them out as soon as they come out of the oven.

I made these with pineapple cake and used the pineapple juice and they came out a bit too sweet for my taste, but very moist and tasty.  I used a standard muffin tin and used approx 1/2 pinapple ring for each cup.  They came out very cute though.

Very moist - I changed the cake part of the recipe as follows:

used 3 bags of apple cinnamon muffin mix (either Martha White or White Lily) instead of cake mix, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk and 1 cup pineapple juice and cooked for about 20 min. at 350. 

I used the brown sugar and butter as base and also had to cut the pineapple slices and put the cherry on after releasing from the pan.  I used Pam in the muffin pan and they came out perfectly.

My mom and I used to make pineapple upside-down cake all the time when I was little.  I needed to make a dessert for my brother's surprise party, and these minis were perfect.
The only thing I did differently was to use the jumbo muffin tins (bake for 20 min), and to cook the cherry into the cake.  I got rave reviews from everyone at that party. Thanks!!!!

Still waiting for them to come out of the oven but so far they look/taste amazing. I was surprised to find how thick the cake batter ended up being and i used pineapple nectar because i didnt read far enough ahead and it tastes AMAZING. Instead of trimming the outside of the pineapple rings, my cousin and i cut a wedge out of one to make it fit and used that as a template for the rest, worked beautifuly!

very tasty! i ended up using chunks instead of a full ring it was much easier that way atleast, until they came out the pineapple stuck to the pan we just had to take a few minutes to put the pineapple back on but other than that a big hit! will make these again!

I made this for my daughter's Letter U snack at school.  I lost a couple of them because it stuck to pan.  I cut up the pineapple rings and put the tidbits in the bottom.  It turned out very good. The kids enjoyed them.

I only had a white cake mix,so I used it.I made 12 of these with just the brown sugar and butter on top for the 1/2 of the family who does not like pineapple. I then left to pick up kids and forgot about them in the oven. They were way overdone. To my surprise they ate them, even the pineapple haters told me how good they were. They had no idea they had juice in them. Even burnt these were good. Will Make again. What a great idea!! Thanks

I loved the classic recipe. There wasn't anything added to it which was great. It was alot of work trimming the pineapple, next time I will arrange tidbits into a circle. This was so pretty on my tray!

I have made this recipe as is and tried it using the pineapple cake mix as others mentioned and I have to say I love the yellow mix with the fresh pineapple juice as you have used. I think the pineapple cake has an artificial taste. The next time I make it, I"m going to try crushed pineapple and will double the brown sugar and butter.. we like it sweet. Thanks for a keeper.

These are delicious, particular the cake. I double the brown sugar/butter mixture and am glad I did. I also used a pineapple cake mix with water. Cutting the pineapple to size is hit and miss.  The unmolding was the worst part. They did taste good, though.

TOO CUTE! I had a cupcake size box of yellow cake mix on hand, so I just halved the recipe. I didn't clearly read the directions *shocker*, so I ended up puttig the cherry in the center before baking, which caused them to bleed, so mine are kinda ugly looking, lol, but they are just for us and they are still delicious. These would be great for a party...Def will be making these again! Thanks or sharing. :)

I made these in large muffin tins and just used the whole pineapple ring. I also added the cherry before adding the cake mix. Somehow I managed to use too much butter and the top wasn't as crusty as I would have liked, but they were still yummy.

A very good recipe as is. I made this again but used butter recipe cake mix and used real butter to make the cake. No pineapple juice. I used a can of  crushed pineapple mixed with real sweet cream butter and brown sugar and used whole cherries for the center. The second one was great too with the hints of butter and it wasnt too sweet.

Easy, moist and a nice change from a cupcake! I mis-read the recipe and thought it said reserve 1/4 cup pineapple juice. So, I panicked as I had already dumped the remainder of the juice down the drain. So, I gathered the pieces of pineapple I cut off, squeezed the juice out of them and actually dropped pieces of whole pineapple into the batter. THen I added about 1/2 cup water to make sure I had enough liquid. They came out fabulous!! So cute too!!

These mini pineapple upside-down cakes are DELICIOUS. They are a perfect serving size and easy to make...Everyone loves them! They are super moist as well! I used the pineapple slices and sliced them into 8 pieces and put 4 pieces in each mini cake. I also used canola oil instead of vegetable oil...I forgot to use the pineapple juice, so I splashed some in the batter as well! Great recipe!!

Great idea! I had some crushed pineapply left over from another dish so I squeezed out the juice through a sieve & used it instead of rings -worked just fine. Still added the 1/2 cherry, just pushed down into the pineapple a little. I also didn't have a cake mix on hand so I just stirred up a simple white cake mix, using agave nectar instead of white sugar, added the pineapple juice I squeezed out & it turned out great. I had some cake batter left over since I only made a dozen of the pineapple upside down cakes - so I poured it into mini cupcake pan & had little cake bites for lunch snacks.

I followed some other reviewers idea of using the pineapple cake mix (without pineapple juice) instead of the yellow mix (with the juice).  Yuck!  It tastes fake!   Also, not one of the cakes came out of the pan without leaving the (chopped) pineapple and/or part of the cake in the pan.  What a disappointment!  Next time, I will stick with my recipe and use yellow cake (either from a box or scratch).

These little cakes are great! My husband ate 4 in one sitting. I actually didn't read the recipe carefully enough and put the cherries in with the pineapple--they still came out great. The only thing I would do differently next time is to just used the pineapple that is already cut up, since I ended up cutting up the rings quite a bit to get them in my muffin tims.

These were just okay. I love the concept of this but they tasted like they were from the box and the brown sugar mixture wasn't enough. Also, the pineapples were too big for the muffin pan so it was difficult to get them to fit nicely. If I make again, I would make the cake from scratch and double the brown sugar mixture.

I was excited to try this recipe. Although they turned out well I will make some changes when I make them again.  I will use the plain cake mix next time instead of the pineapple.  I think using the pineapple makes it too sweet.  I also used 2 different pans.  I used large muffin tins and the topping slid off and had to be put back on.  I also used some single serving heart-shaped pans that had straight sides as opposed to the angled sides of of cupcake tins.  The straight sided cakes held the topping better. I also used fresh pineapple, which I think is always better than canned.

This was good! Definitely bits are better than rings. It's easier to cut with fork. Good.

Made this for a meeting and everyone RAVED about these.  I did the suggestion of the pineapple mix with water instead of vanilla mix and pineapple juice.  I also used crushed pineapple instead of rings and whole cherries instead of halved.  Yum-O!

These are delicious! I made them for a large function and they were gone in no time flat! I used regular muffin tins but I would suggest using the larger ones.  also doubled the topping and used it all. I ended up cutting my pineapple slices into wedges (tidbits) and they fit together around the edge of the cupcake, perfectly. I also put the cherry in the center prior to baking as recommended. Yummy!

These really are good!!! I used a pineapple supreme cake mix.  Also....if you want to make them even more portable....use the foil cupcake cups (found in the baking section) and about 6 minutes before they are done...add a cherry to the top.   The foil cups prevent the juice from leaking out the way a paper cupcake cup would.

Fantastic,  The presentation is awesome.  I like to make this for family dinners because everyone has their own pineapple and cutting the cake into serving pieces is eliminated.  We have a sauce made with milk, sugar and vanilla bean that we spoon over it, sort of like having melted vanilla ice cream on top.

Loved this recipe! I used regular size cupcake pans and the recipe made 30. I used Duncan Hines pineapple supreme cake mix, I followed the cake mix recipe and substituted pineapple juice for water. I took the advice of others and cut my pineapples in to a "C" shape and put my cherry in before baking. I filled my cupcake pans up to the top and baked for 25 min. I cooled them in the pan for five min..I than inverted them onto a foiled covered cooling rack that I sprayed with pam. All in all these are so nice and would be perfect for a baby or bridal shower! great recipe

I made these for my mother-in-law for Mother's Day since Pineapple Upside Down Cake is her favorite.  I made 12 jumbo size "cakes" instead of 24 smaller ones.  I used the "chunk" pineapple since that's what I had on hand and just placed the chunks in the pan to form a ring and it worked out very well.  I will be using this recipe from now on!

This is a GREAT recipe!  I used yellow cake mix with pineapple juice and the cake was just how I would like it to be.  I also added the cherry before baking and trimmed the pineapple rings to better fit the muffin cup tins.  Be careful when you flip them out... it can be a little messy with the brown sugar/butter mixture.  Delicious and smell wonderful!

I made this for my son's two-year birthday because he loves pineapple.  Awesome.  The tops were perfectly caramelized and looked so pretty.  A scoop of vanilla ice cream cut the richness a bit, but everyone loved them.

Made these for dessert tonight. They were a hit! Per other reviews, I made in jumbo cupcake pans, and used a pineapple cake mix. I added cinnamon, cloves & nutmeg to the brown sugar mixture. I also substituted 1/4c pineapple juice for water, rather than the full 1 1/4c. I will certainly make again. Thanks for sharing!

I used regular muffin tins and could not fit the cherry in with the pineapple.  Plus having to cut the pineapple rings, I would not make again unless I used jumbo muffins.  I followed the recipe exact (meaning I didnt change anything). Some cherries fell off, which is why the larger muffin tin would work better (put the cherry in before baking).  The cake was kind of plain, next time I would also use the pineapple cake mix some people suggested. Bottom line, as is, its a 4.  With some changes it could be a 5.

These were delicious and moist, I'll definitely make them again. My boyfriend and roommate loved them (she decided she had to make a batch herself!) Because I have an insatiable sweet-tooth, I made a quick glaze (pineapple juice and confectioner's sugar) and drizzled it over them when they were almost cool. I think it added a great little extra sweetness.

So so good. They were a little sticky and I only had enough brown sugar for a 12 muffin pan and a 6 muffin pan, but had plenty of cake batter. I think that's because I put to much of the brown sugar in each muffin cup. They turned out soo good. A little time consuming cutting the pinepple slices, but well worth it.

These were great! I used pineapple supreme cake mix, but kept everything as per the recipe. Used my kitchen shears to trim the pineapple rings and put the cherry in before baking. They came out awesome! I made them in place of regular cupcakes at my sons bday party and they went fast! Will definitely make these again! YUM.

Fantastic!  I used the pineapple juice with yellow cake mix, and thought they were perfect.  I used regular sized cupcake pans, and just had to cut the rings to fit, but was not a big deal at all.  Everyone loved them, and I had to hide one so I could have one later!

They were good, I left off the cherries and stuffed the middle of the pineapple rings with chopped up pineapple. They were simple, tasty, and quick. Don't forget to flip the pan over right away or else you don't get the yummy brown sugar sauce on top.

Made these for my Red Hat Party and they were the hit of the day.  Everyone thought I was so clever to make them, I almost hated to tell them how easy they were to make.  I used the jumbo muffin tins and a pineapple ring fit perfectly.

This is a great recipe. Really easy and tasty. Everyone in my house gobbled them down before I could say "come and get them" because they smelled so good in the oven. Yum!

These were very good and very easy to make. I made them saturday night and were perfect dessert for Easter dinner. I will definatley make these again. I didn't chage the recipe, I did follow other reviewers suggestions and used a jumbo muffin pan, the pineapple ring fit perfectly in there, and I put the cherry in prior to baking. Very good recipe, great idea. Thanks!!!!!!!!

These are cute little desserts. I used jumbo muffin pans, which should yield one dozen cakes. I inserted the cherries before baking.

I've never had pineapple upside-down cake before... Had no idea I have been missing out on something so incredible.  These are wonderful!  I did, however, not use a box mix (yuck!) instead using the recipe: Cake Mixes from Scratch and Variations off here.  (Baked with the cherry in place, and used "Tidbit" pineapple.)

I've made these lil' pineapple wonders a couple of times and have always been a hit wherever I take'm to. The only thing I did different was put the cherry in before baking so it gets caramelized like the pineapple.

These were a hit with my family! I used the yellow cake mix, but added some extra cinnamon. I put four large servings into custard cups and used the rest of the batter in a mini cup cake pan. The mini cupcakes were more popular because the yummy, caramelized sugar coating covers almost the entire cupcake! Yummm...

These cupcakes were a fabulous treat for both the eyes and the tastebuds! I used crushed pineapple and put the cherries on before I baked them, and they turned out beautifully.

Very moist and yummy!  I made as full size cupcakes as well instead of minis so I didn't have to cut the pineapple slices to fit.  I also used the pineapple flavored cake mix and went ahead and baked my cherries on the cakes.

These were pretty good, but a little messy to make. When I tried inverting them, pineapple juice got all over the place. They were a huge hit though.

This was very easy and tasted great!  I used at white cake mix because that is what I had on hand.  For the pineapple I used rings and cut them in half first then fit them in the muffin cups. I will try tidbits next time.

I had high hopes for this dessert and am a little disappointed.  After the first time through I experimented with different ingredients and techniques.  They were tastier with a pineapple cake mix, if you can find one.  I used normal muffin tins, so used only a bit more than a half a pineapple ring in each cup--but they weren't super pretty--the pineapple looked awkward, not pretty & round.  I tried a batch in mini-muffin cups with teeny pieces of pineapple, but they didn't come out quite right--the cake part wasn't substanial enough, and the the pinapple pieces just looked weird.  In one batch I was a little too generous in spooning the sugar & butter mixture into the cups, and it bubbled out onto the pan and onto the oven.  I wanted to serve these for dessert at a formal shower, but I have decided against it--they're cute and yummy, but not quite as pretty as I had hoped.

I made this recipe in mini muffin pans, using pineapple tidbits instead of rings.  They were a hit at an office party - a bit sticky, but no utensils needed!

P.S. - I greased my pans with Pam spray for baking(the kind w/flour in it) and did not have any problems with the cakes sticking to the pan.

I'm not a big fan of cherries, cake, or pineapple, but I made this to use up some leftover fresh pineapple.  The cupcakes were too difficult to cleanly remove from a paper wrapper, but did quite well removed from a foil wrapper.  They looked quite pretty and my children and husband enjoyed them immensely.

I used the pineapple cake mix and used some of the canned pineapple syrup in place of the water as I mixed batter! I also didn't half the cherry...used whole plus added it along with the pineapple at time of baking. Will definitely make again...so simple to make and right portion for each of your guests.

These are great and easy to make. My family loved them and since there bite size they were gone in no time. I love the individual portion n knowing your going to get pineapple pieces and a cherry every time. Was a bit worried since ive never made any type of pineapple upside down cake. But was a piece of cake! p.s. I found it easier using pineapple chuncks rather then having cut down all the sliced pieces.

the batter made a lot. i was able to make 24 cupcakes and a mini cake. they tasted great and were very moist. i used a bigger can of pineapple and the pineapple upside down cake mix from a box. i had no trouble with it sticking to the pan either ( i did grease it quite a bit). the only problem i had was that the pineapples wanted to fall off but thats no biggie :) awesome recipie. they taste great i deffinatly recomend it.

I made these for my coworkers and they were a HUGE hit! I have already gotten requests to make this for people that will pay me! The only things I changed: water instead of pineapple juice in the batter, and I put the cherry in the pan before baking.

So good!  Turned out great the first time I made them and they were a hit at work!  I used crushed pineapple instead of sliced pineapple rings though. I also made a little extra butter/brown sugar mix for extra goodness.

Yum! Yum! Yum! I made this to share with a group of ladies for after our tennis match, and they LOVED it! Had many requests for the recipe. I did make a few changes- didn't have enough of the brown sugar, butter mixture so ended up using a cup of each (but would use less butter next time); and I used crushed pineapple, pressed, instead of the sliced pineapple, since my tins were not big enough for the slices and trimming them was not working.

I guess I should have known better than to expect these to taste as good as I remembered.  They didn't cut it for me...mainly because it tasted just like what it was - a box cake.  They looked cute but cuteness doesn't make up for the boxed cake mix taste.  Sorry...this one won't be gracing my kitchen again.

These are not only yummy but are visually appealing.  If you’re looking for a beautiful dessert you will appreciate this recipe.   I made this recipe exactly as written with the exception of baking them in an oversized muffin tin.

I made this today and think they came out great!! I made a few mini cakes as well as one big one.. I wasn't able to use the full 1 and 1/4 cups of pineapple juice cause I didn't have enough so I used what I had and added a table spoon of cherry juice from the cherry jar and filled it the rest of the way with water.  I also put the mini cakes in in individual mini pot pie pans instead of a muffin tin, which I feel was a lot easier to flip in the end.  I definitely liked the mini cakes better because they didn't take as long to make. However, both were moist and tasted great! I would definitely make this again for a dinner party to give everyone their own individual dessert.

Love these cute little cakes! I'm not a big fan of actual pineapple but love the flavoring, so I used a little crushed pineapple as topping and also used pineapple cake mix as suggested by pps. They turned out great! Thanks for a great recipe!

Used others' suggestions: pineapple cake mix, applesauce instead of oil, pineapple tidbits.  The result was pretty tasty.  I also converted into mini muffins, using 1 pineapple tidbit, and a cherry half-they turned out good.

I made these over the weekend.  While the flavor was fabulous, the presentation lacked appeal.  I sprayed the pans, but everything still stuck.  Plus, I had a hard time getting them to 'balance', as they had a huge muffin top and were wobbly.  I will definitely make them again, but might have to make a few adjustments.  Might do as one other reviewer suggested and reverse the recipe, putting the cake mix on the bottom instead.  But all in all, very good recipe!  We gobbled them up!  Thanks for sharing!

Presentation worth 5 stars.  I ended up cutting the pineapple into little chuncks and forming a ring, added the cherry before baking.  Used a yellow cake mix with 6 oz juice and 6 oz water which give the cake a not too sweet but subtle flavor.  Overall though the flavor is ok.  I did a trial run for Easter and  and will use adding ome coconut flakes and possibly some pinapple extract to bump up the cake flavor.

Wow!  This is so yummy and looks beautiful!  So quick and easy to make.  I used pineapple cake mix and  pineapple juice instead of water and put the cherry in before cooking.  I let it cool for 5 min before inverting on a wire rack.

I took these to our Christmas Eve dinner and everybody really liked them.  The cake was very moist and not too sweet.  I ended up having to fill my cupcakes pans to the top with batter because there wasn't much room once the pineapple was in it, but it wasn't a problem.

I gave these 4 stars for taste, but they weren't very pretty.  I used regular sized muffin pans, so I cut the pineapple rings into quarters and used 2 per cupcake.  I also baked the cherries into the cake as others suggested.  Because the pineapple pieces didn't cover the whole surface of the cupcake, there were gunks of butter/brown sugar in between that didn't look very appetizing.  If I did this again I would definitely use the jumbo muffin pan so that the rings fit better.  Still, they are tasty and very moist (borderline soggy in fact, but good).  And though they were a little extra work compared to regular cupcakes, it really didn't take that long to put them together.

These were absolutely delicious! I didn't have to change one thing.  I also had no problem getting them out of the pan...they slid right out the minute I flipped them upside down.  I had been craving pineapple upside down cake for over a month (no exaggeration!) and just decided to make them since I hadn't tried this recipe out yet.  I was more than satisfied and shared them with mine and my fiance's family.  Everyone LOVED them! Thank you so much!

these were wonderful!  i made them for my son's backwards birthday party, the night before the event...and although they were a little soggy the next day [after storing loosely covered] they got VERY high reviews from the crowd!  i have to say...i tried them fresh out of the oven, and oh my goodness...delicious!

I thought this was so yummy! I made it into a bundt cake because I lacked supplies to make the mini cakes. My only problem was that, because I followed the recipe, the brown sugar mixture that I put into the bottom of the pan was a little too much and it disintegrated the cake a bit. It still tasted divine, but the presentation wasn't everything I had hoped. Easily fixable problem for next time!

Pineapple Upside-Down cake is a tradition at Easter for my family.  I usually make the recipe from the Better Homes & Gardens cookbook, but this year I decided to try these cuties.  I only made 1/2 recipe, which is plenty for just my husband and me.  I used the rest of the cake batter to make plain cupcakes to freeze and use later.  Therefore, I did not add the pineapple juice to the batter (some reviewers said it was too sweet anyways).  They still turned out very tastey.  I made the pineapple cakes in my jumbo muffin pan and didn't trim the pineapple at all.  I went ahead and added the cherries before pouring the batter on and baking.  I had a little problem with the cakes sticking to the pan, so be sure to grease the pan well!  These tasted great and are cute, but are more complicated than my usual recipe.

Easy to make, and they looked super cute.  I used pinnable tidbits to make the rings as suggested by others.  Taste was good to very good.

Very good. I used the Pillsbury butter golden cake mix and pineapple tidbits. Unfortunately, the tidbits didn't have enough pineapple juice and I had to sub water. It still turned out great, I just wish I had more juice to bring out the pineapple flavor

These pretty little cakes will impress your guests and their size will invite people to try them. They are a bit of work, but worth it.  My father-in-law loves pineapple upside-down cake and was surprised to learn it was made from cake mix in a box.

These were so awesome and easy to make!!! I didn't change the recipe at all other than using chunk pineapple and arranging around the outside of the muffin tin (I had to cut the chunks in half width way, I have shallow muffin tins, I guess!) and baking with the cherry on the bottom (it looks so much cuter that way!) I thought these took a little bit more time than I ususlly would like to put into a cupcake, but they were SO worth it. Plus, not having to frost them was a time saver! These would be GREAT for a bake sale!!!

These were pretty yummy--I also used pineapple cake mix, as per some reviewers. It was a little time-conusming cutting the pineapple rings to fit, but next time I'll follow some of the reviewers' suggestions and use pineapple chunks or crushed pineapple. There must be something to make these look a little more aesthetically pleasing. They only lose a star for presentation. They tasted great and were perfect at our baby shower luau. :)

My family loved these cakes and they were the perfect single serving size.  I also took the advice of others and used pineapple tidbits and did not have to cut any pineapple.  They were so easy to make and looked great on the plate.

I usually don't like pineapple but this may be the best cake I have ever had. And to top it my boyfriend who dosnt cook let alone bake made these by himself. This recipe must be full proof. I know he used a pinapple upside down cake mix instead of just reagular yellow it really intensified the flavor.
