Simple and delicious strawberry sauce. I cut this back to six servings. I threw this together to spoon over buttermilk pancakes. This is EXACTLY the same strawberry topping my Grandma always made to go over ice cream.

There's nothing quite like fresh strawberries and if I had a penny for everytime I made this, well...let's just say I'd have more than a dollar!  Sometimes the simplest recipes are some of the best and you can easily sub Splenda for the sugar and get great results. This is perfect over shortcake, pound cake, ice cream, pancakes, and waffles - the possibilites are endless.

Thank for this. It is simple but some people just need to be reassured they are doing it right. Sorry for Grandma Jones being so rude.

This is just how my mom used to make strawberry topping for strawberry shortcake. This needs to be made up in advance to eating though because after it stands a while the strawberries get softer and sweeter and the juice gets really syrupy. I used superfine sugar for this.

I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh one. It still turned out good.
@Grandma Jones, sometimes you just need reassurance that you are going about the correct way of making strawberry sauce and others truly do not know how to make this dessert. Please do not assume everyone is proficient at all cooking (and non-cooking) methods. Even a child must first learn how to boil water before they can cook a hard-boiled egg.

This is a perfect recipe for macerated strawberries. However most will probably not consider the results of this recipe to be a sauce even though it is. Perhaps the name should be changed to avoid lower ratings.

I disagree with the poster that said that this recipe should not need to be written.  Perhaps for the people in the "older" generation that were able to watch their at-home-mothers cook every single day - she is right - but now things are different and rarely is home ec. even offered in schools anymore.  The only thing I do differently is to add at least 1 1/2 cup water and some vanilla extract...and also some honey as well as sugar (to taste).  I let sit overnight - we like the large amount of liquid - because I serve the strawberries over pound cake and the poud cake is just so much better with all that liquid soaked into it!!!

This is really good. I do this all the time when I'm making strawberry shortcake. And like many other reviewers mentioned, if you don't know that sugar over berries pulls out a lot of juice to make a wonderful sauce, you need a recipe. Grandma was just one rude lady, and if she felt that way, she should have made her own recipe and posted it. Honestly, you just can't please everybody.

Yes this is simple and I very much appreciate that someone took the time to post this. I am the type of person who needs a recipe for EVERYTHING!! I don't feel confident with myself while cooking unless I have something to follow. I just put this together and am thrilled to serve this later today to my family. Thank You!!

Thank you!  My mother made the sauce just like this and it was awesome.  I never knew how. My mother has passed on and she never showed me how to do it.  Of course, I never asked.  No need to.  However, I needed to know now.  May I say, that ANY kind of recipe on ALLRECIPES.com is greatly appreciated.  ANY KIND!  A lot of us are not born with recipes in our memory banks like Grandma Jones.  By the way, I'm a guy.

you can also make a sauce to pour over cheesecake by putting the strawberries in a blender and add powdered sugar instead of white sugar and pulse a few times, depending on how chuncky you want the strawberries.....

Thank you for considering those who struggle in the kitchen for ideas.  When I want a "sauce" for my fresh strawberries; I add a little lemon juice and use honey rather than sugar.  Yummy!  Thanks again bluegirl for being kind and considerate!

This is what my mother did with our strawberries growing up. It reminds me of summers in Iowa on our farm. You can't go wrong with this....great with whipped cream too.

My market had a great sale on strawberries but since they are not in season, they weren’t very sweet.  I used a little less sugar than this recipe called for and it made the strawberries taste like they were freshly picked.

I had a bottle of Pina Colada mix on hand and I added a bit of it to the strawberry sauce. Mmmm! Now I keep a bottle on hand mainly for this use.  The mix doesn't have the rum added to yet in this form, so the whole family can enjoy it -- kids and all.

Absolutely beautiful strawberry sauce, and extremely simple. The only thing I would do is reduce the vanilla, as it was a little overpowering. Otherwise perfect!

We use this for strawberry shortcake, over ice cream, mixed in with plain Greek yogurt or just in a bowl with whipped cream on top!  I like that the juices don't get too syrupy.  I like to add a teeny bit of vanilla extract - just 1/4 tsp or so.  Really adds a nice depth of flavor!

So simple and easy.  I had a plain piece of cheesecake that needed a little something.  This was perfect, I had NO idea that you could make it so easily.  Thank you for sharing, because without this recipe I would've been lost!

I seen this on the recipe reviews and wanted to see the recipe. I have been mixing strawberries and a little sugar together since I was little. My mom taught me years ago how to clean, cut, and sweeten strawberries like this to use to make strawberry shortcake. For this to be a sauce though it would require putting this in the blender. This is a recipe for sweetened strawberries for desserts. Either way, delicious combination in the summer time when fresh strawberries are available!

i think you could use a no-calorie sweetner in place of sugar, especially if one is watching calories.

Like my Grandmama used to make!! Yes, a simple recipe, but guess what? I never knew it was that easy til I searched for it. Thank you for posting what may seem like a common sense recipe for those of us who never knew how to make delicious home-made strawberry syrup!

This is what my mother ALWAYS did for strawberry shortcake and it's what I do now.  I've also taught my daughter to do it this way.  Of course I don't use measurements (because my mother never did either).  I just sprinkle sugar on until it "looks right" stir them up and let them sit until a nice syrup forms.  I make Jiffy mix biscuits and pour the strawberries and syrup over and dig in!  I didn't see the rude comment made but I'm sure it wasn't necessary.  A lot of people (obviously) need and like just such a recipe.

Just what I was looking for, I made heart-shaped, french toasts for my husband for a valentines day breakfast and this sauce was the perfect topping, just added two drops of red food coloring to make it more attractive... We both loved it! Thank you

This is the way we always have made our strawberries...so good and sweet! This is also nice because if your berries are a little on the tart side, this sweetens them right up. We always serve these in strawberry shortcake. Love the juice that they create~YUM! :)

This was incredibly sweet and the perfect topping for the pound cake that I made this evening. The only change I made, because I wanted more of a sauce, was to add 2 tablespoons of hot water. Thanks so much for this recipe and I will make it again definitely!

I made this last Christmas (a few times, actually) for strawberry shortcake. It's sooooooo good, and so fresh! I might try it with a teaspoon of corn syrup next time to use as a strawberry topping!

Perfect for out family! We had this over waffles.It's peak strawberry season, so my strawberries were already very sweet, so I would cut the sugar a bit when they are in season and fresh. Very good and easy though!

Tasted great and very easy.  Don't know about the proportions, but I had 1 lb strawberries and it needed ~1/4 c. sugar.  Served over "Aunt Johnnie's Pound Cake" with whipped cream.  Thanks Bluegirl!

I always wondered if I was using the right amount of Splenda, this confirms it. Also like the suggestion for adding vanilla.

I've been making this for a long time, but I wanted to see if there were alternatives that I may be missing. Nope....this is it! Simple, delicious and the nice syrup forms. I do rinse off the strawberries briefly with water, so that may help forming the syrup. In the past, I didn't let it sit out for 10 min, so that's good to know. I like to have with angel food cake, but all of the other ideas (ice cream, pancakes, etc) sound great!!

I wouldn't exactly call this a "sauce", however this is my favorite strawberry topping from way back in the day. (if you'd like more 
 of a sauce, give it a couple whirls in the blender or processor) My mom and grandma made this all the time. It's not really a "recipe" per se, but nonetheless, it's perfect on pound cake or angel food cake, topped with whipped cream.  Try it with brown sugar for a nice change of pace! Yum!

I had this on French toast this morning, but it's just what I always use for strawberry shortcake. I cut the strawberries into bite-size pieces--this helps them to be juicier. The only negative thing I've found with this is that the strawberries are really squishy the next day.

these strawberries tasted wonderful on pancakes. The kid's loved it. The longer you let the strawberries sit, the more syrupy they get. Will make again!

My mom always did her strawberries like this and her mom before her.  These are great to have on hand during the summer for pound cake, angel food cake, ice cream, belgian waffles, cereal or just for snacking.

I used 1 lb strawberries, sliced and only needed 1/8 c sugar. More sugar would have been a no-no for Mom.

a simple recipe that works every time. The longer the berries macerate, the juicier they become. I like to prep this about an hour before using. Make it first, pop in the fridge, make dinner, and when its time for dessert this will be ready to go.

Made this for strawberry shortcake.  Perfect, though I didn't think it was very juicy after 10 minutes per the recipe.  Mine sat in the fridge for 4-5 hours before serving and it had the right amount of sauce so that the last bite of angel food cake could sop it up.

Needed something quick and easy and this seemed to work almost instantly.  I used Ideal sugar substitute instead of sugar and the strawberries and sauce were perfect over a slice of pound cake with a bit of whipped cream.  Thank you!

This was a simple and fast way to sweetened some fresh tart strawberries I wanted to use on top of my strawberry cheesecake. It was perfect because unlike sauce recipes that require you make it on the stovetop for the use with cheesecake it was prettier and more fruitier than using an actual sauce. Only thing is because the sugar starts to make strawberries juice come to the outside it can get soggy if cut to thin so cut in chunks and eat right away!! Don't know if I would call it a sauce but maybe 'sugar sweetened strawberries'? Either way I loved it, thanks bluegirl.

I grew up eating strawberries this way. Any left over strawberries from mom's cakes were up for grabs so we'd throw some sugar on them and enjoy!

Perfect!  I can remember as a child being at my Grandmother's & I can still see that big white ceramic bowl sitting on her counter full of ripe, juicy, sweet strawberries (from this recipe).   My cousins & I would peel back the saran wrap & sneak a couple, scraping each one against the stray sugar that had gathered around the top half of that ceramic bowl, each time we entered the kitchen whilst we ran about our Grandparents house like grandkids / cousins often did during that time.  Today, I use this same recipe as a topping on pounde cake, followed with a big dollop of cool whip.  I try to always use home made (cake & whip cream) but have found pound cake from my stores bakery & cool whip work beautifully! Also, these berries taste great over ice cream!  This recipe deserves 5 stars for being delicious, easy (you can't mess it up if you tried!), & nostalgic! Thank you!
