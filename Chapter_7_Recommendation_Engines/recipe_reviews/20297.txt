I'm crushed. My first time making fudge and followed the recipe EXACLTY. Even got the fudge to the right temperature and it wouldn't set up. It's still runny.  Any ideas what I did wrong?

I made a sugar-free version of this for my father-in-law who is diabetic. I used Splenda in place of the brown sugar. (I just used 1/2 the amount listed because Splenda is quite sweet).  It was a great success!  I am about to make a second batch.

I followed this recipie to the letter. I have made fudge in the past, tho it has been many years. The directions are not complete which leads to disaster. I let the concoction set for 2 hours and all I had to show for it was a pan of sludge. Now that I know what I need to do, I think I'll find a different recipie. You really should update your directions to be ALL inclusive instead of assuming everyone knows what to do. We don't, that is why we are here looking for help.

Great, very quick & easy recipe!  I did have everything I needed in my cupboard.
I used cream with the milk, and folded in semi-sweet chocolate chips at the very end to make it chocolate-peanut butter.
Keeps nicely at room temperature, good consistency.

Is there something missing from the ingredient list?  What kind of milk?  And every other fudge recipe I've used calls for butter, not margarine.  I made a mistake making this fudge, as all I have now is a pan of semi-liquid peanut sauce.  My best friend suggests that I put it in a jar to microwave for ice cream topping... which is the only way to salvage this disaster.  Sorry... I went looking for a better recipe because the fudge was supposed to be a gift, and I wouldn't give this to anyone!

Me and my Daughter made this as a thanksgiving treat. We got a little confused if it was ready to cool because when we dropped it into the water it did not form a ball. but once it had boiled awhile and almost formed we decided to finish the recipe and it is wonderful! 
We also tried regular sugar instead of brown sugar and we had to add 2 more cups of reg. white sugar. we also added 1/4 c. more of peanut butter. 
Both turned out wonderful!!!

I recommend using CREAMY peanut butter!  I used chunky peanut butter and it was too nutty!!!  I really liked this fudge...it sets up perfectly, cuts well and tastes good.  It has a great brown sugar peanut butter taste.

This was an amazingly easy recipe! For those a bit new to fudge though it can be a bit scary so here's some tips! You want to boil the sugar and milk for quite a while. You want to boil it down to a nice thick rich syrup. I had to boil it for about 15 minutes before it was ready to be mixed with the other ingredients! But you have to be quick because it sets very quickly!  I'll definately be using this recipe again! I hate the taste of powdered sugar and this was just a very rich earthy peanut butter taste! I love the brown sugar in this recipe!

Jessica, I do not understand how people say they follow the directions to the letter and that the recipe fails.  NOT!!!!  The cook fails to do something right. There is a site, just below the directions, on all the fudge recipes, that people can go to for advice on how to make flawless fudge.  This recipe was more time-consuming (for an old granny like  me) than the recipes that melt chocolate chips and call it fudge, but Gramma's Easy Peanut Butter Fudge is the BEST peanut butter fudge!  I have always loved peanut butter fudge and had never found the right recipe, until now.  Nice to know I won't have to buy my fudge by the pound at candy stores any longer.  Thank you, and thank your Gramma for making another Granny happy.

You really need to just leave it alone and not stir it. I found that it's easier if you leave out the thermometer as well. set your timer for 5 minutes and check for the soft ball stage after that every 30 seconds. It's easier and more accurate than the thermometer. It turned out perfect for me.

I did not care for this RECIPE. I'm not saying it's bad fudge, it's just not a well written recipe. I am a first time fudge maker and I read the reviews for this recipe and felt worried, but thought I could handle it. Boy was I wrong. Boiled the syrup to exactly 112 C then added the remaining stuff. The fudge didn't set up and the sugar seperated from the peanut butter. This recipe is decieving. NOT EASY. DO NOT MAKE THIS RECIPE IF YOU HAVEN'T MADE FUDGE BEFORE.

I cannot stop eating this disaster,  I did not read that a step is missing, "do not stir while reaching 240" and maybe I need to check my thermometer.  It is grainey also.  But the flavor is outstanding.  Worth giving this another try. I used light brown sugar and butter.

I used soy milk and margarine in this recipe, as i wanted a nondairy version, and it worked beautifully.  I also used chunky peanut butter and sprinkled chocolate chips on top, and think it came out really well.  it is very sweet, but it melts in your mouth!  i used both the thermometer and testing in water to make sure i was at the right point.  oh, and for the record, 2 pounds of sugar is about 4 and a half cups!

I just made this recipe. If you are in a hurry do not make this because it takes about 45 minutes to get it to 112 degrees C. I now have it in the fridge and I can't wait till it is set. I tested a little while I was pouring into the pan and it tasted very good but it is SWEET!! Hope this is a help to someone.

I followed directions to the letter, sweat over the hot pan, and all I got was a pan full of dry, crumbly mixture of ingredients not suitable for anything. I had to soak the pan. Don't bother with this recipe.

This was my first time making fudge that wasn't just chocolate chips and condensed milk.  I followed the directions and cooked the milk and sugar until  the required temperature of 240 degrees.  It turned out great.  :)

This is one of the best peanut butter fudge recipes ever...  You just have to make sure that the sugar ingredients are cooked long enough.  It has been perfect every time.

This is a great recipe.  I used butter instead of margarine.  I think those who maybe having problems don't have a candy thermomater.  Also you have to let it bubble with out stirring in order to get a well set fudge.  I know that the directions miss that part.

Love it!  I have been looking for a classic recipe with very basic ingredients, with real peanut butter and no marshmallow creme.  It is very delicious.  Let me warn you that you have to watch it VERY closely if not using a candy thermometer.  Over-boiling it will cause it to thicken while pouring into a baking dish, and it will turn out dry and rock-hard.

Very Yummy and easy to make.  This will be my new fudge recipe.  Tastes just like good old fashioned fudge.  I followed the recipe to a T.  For those whos didn't turn out right, get a candy thermometor. Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.

I was very happy to find a recipe that didn't list marshmallow creme as an ingredient and that I wouldn't need to use a candy thermometer. However, I was quite disappointed with the finished product. The mixture was very dry and crumbly and had to smash it down in the pan to give it a smooth appearance. Then after I chilled it for a few hours, it was dry and crumbly when I tasted it. It also had a burnt after-taste, considering I didn't burn anything when making it. Sorry, but will not make again.

This is now my favorite peanut butter fudge recipe.  It's so creamy and just the perfect amount of peanut buttery goodness.  Brought a tray of both chocolate and this peanut butter fudge to my office and the peanut butter was the first to go.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.

I TRIED THE RECEIPE AND DIDN'T LIKE HOW IT TURNED OUT. IT WOULD NOT SET PROPERLY. IT WAS LIKE PUDDING.
THE TASTE WAS GOOD,BUT ALITTLE TOO MUCH BROWN SUGAR.

I made this and at first it was crumbly and didn't use all the confectioners sugar but I pressed it in the pan anyway. It set up fine. My children ate it all within an hour and are begging for more so, I deem it a great success.

My mother-inlaw has made this wonderful fudge every Christmas for my chlidren for almost 20 years as I am sure she made it for her children when they were
growing up. She passed away last February and I hope to carry on the tradition.

This was a huge success and I shared the recipe with lots of friends.  It melts in your mouth!  After it sat for a few days, though, it developed a buttery/oily layer on the bottom.

I thought this was good. I did find that name brand peanut butter was better in the candy than the cheaper, store brand.

The directions for this recipe are not sufficient for novice candy makers.  This fudge would not set up even though I used a candy thermometer and brought it up to temperature.  Also, the fudge was very grainy.
