Soup came out very good the first time. Just based on personal preference I would cut the spinach in half as it was very overwhelming. Also I would increase the chicken. I used a 9 oz package of precooked chicken cut up and we had to dig through for bites of chicken.

Easy and delicious. Prepared exaxtly as directed except I prepared my own chicken stock/broth and I used that chicken. I also used fresh spinach roughly chopped. My family said that it was even better than Olive Garden's. I love them even if they might be liars. I will make this soup again.

Made exactly as instructed. Was time consuming and dirtied more dishes than I would have liked but it was really good! I’d like either to find another version of this recipe that allows for one pot or a way to simplify this one. Served with restaurant style salad and breadsticks. Would gladly eat it again.

This tastes just like the soup from Olive Garden except better! You can add any personal touches you want or make it thinner or thicker just to your liking. Its decadent and creamy and very very filling! I recommend making the breadsticks too. Perfect meal for a cold day.

DELICIOUS!! I made it and it was very delicious! I changed the recipe a little bit because I didn t have the exact things I needed instead of shredded carrots I finely chopped baby carrots and I sautéed them with the Union and celery And I also added a little bit of Parmesan cheese to it. I saw other reviews about the spinach being too much but I used the amount called for and chopped it very finely and it was perfect! I would suggest doing step 2 first and setting chicken and cooked gnocchi on the side and doing step 1 and 3 together I almost over cooked step 1 waiting for step 3 and I would also suggest cutting and having everything ready before starting to cook the meal as the steps go by very fast! I will be saving this recipe and making again!

Good recipe not exactly the same as olive gardens but very close. Only real con is that it takes time to make and leaves a lot of dishes to clean afterward.
