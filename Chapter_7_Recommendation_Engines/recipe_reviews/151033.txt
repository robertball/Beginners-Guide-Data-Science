Super easy to make, and ohh soo good. I used the pre crushed toffee bits you find by the chocolate chips, everyone thought they were nuts, I had to tell them they were toffee bits. They really didn't care because it tasted so good. I dipped the sliced apples in sprite so that they wouldn't turn brown. I will definately keep the ingrediants on hand, as this is so easy, and everyone just loved it!!

10 stars! I will make this again and again.  It's great! You can add more or less sugar depending on your taste.  Even try different candy bars. The skies the limit. Let the cream cheese get room temperature first before trying to mix.

AMAZING!  Served this at a girl's night party at my house and it was a HIT!  Everyone was begging for the recipe and when I told them how simple it was they couldn't believe it.  Especially when you can buy the chocolate covered toffee bits to sprinkle over it (they're right next to the chocolate chips in the grocery store!)  Based on other reviews I did cut the sugar by 1/2; I was a little hesitant b/c I like stuff really sweet - but it was perfect!  Will definitely make again and again!

this was good but a bit too sweet. also, my apples turned brown as i prepared them earlier and dipped them in sprite as another reviewer suggested. it did not work. will put the apples on the plate and pore the carmel and candy over them then chill and serve to see if that works.

I've only participated in eating this, and eating this, and eating this. Highly addictive so I am actually a little afraid of making it myself and only indulge at large gatherings.

To be fair, I'm giving this 5 stars but really thought it was more of a 3 or 4 star recipe.... BUT, I used fat free cream cheese and splenda.  I'm thinking full fat or even light cream cheese would have made a difference.  I will keep this one around because it was nice to have a decent dip for apples..... def use regular or light cream cheese though because honestly, once you drizzle on all that caramel and top with the Heath bar, what's a few more calories :)  OH, and it seemed like too much caramel on the top.  Next time I will cut this down a bit and just go by looks.

I see that I'm in the minority here, but this was WAY  too sweet.  It was like eating a bowl of sugar.  If I made it again, I would cut way back on the amount of sugar.

Awesome dessert! The sugar is not necessary. I made it without and it was plenty sweet. Next time I will make sure I take this out 30 mins ahead of time so the cream cheese has time to soften a little bit. I'm fighting to not each the leftovers that are calling my name from the fridge!

Excellent dessert. This is NOT just an apple dip for like play group, this is a sugary dessert but tastes great! I agree that it might be great with PB and chopped up PB cups on top! Serve we a tart apple.

Delicious! For those of you who have trouble with your apples turning brown, they have this stuff called Fruit Fresh. You can put a couple of tablespoons of it in a big bag and put a few tablespoons of water in there with it. Put your apple slices in there and give them a good toss. I've had apples stay good for over 2 days with this stuff. It will give it a bit more of a tart taste but not too much.

I made it without the sugar and it was plenty sweet, ate it with granny smiths - would be good with graham cracker sticks too I think. Definitely a go to recipe if you need to put something together fast!

Delish.  Took this to a picnic and didn't come home with one bite left on the plate.  Didn't change a thing!  I dipped my apples in "Sprite" in attempts to keep them from turning brown, it took longer for them to turn brown this way, but still turned brown.

This is so good!!!  I didn't have the candy bars so I used chocolate chips and heath toffee pieces.  This will be a new treat at our house instead of just plain caramel sauce.

I know how it got its name! This is a keeper for sure. So easy and very basic ingredients. It would be great with all kind of fruits. You could use any candy bar, oreos, coconut, etc. Toffee happens to be my favorite, so I will stick with the original recipe.

This was delicious!  I didn't put as much sugar as called for. I tried both and personally, I liked it better dipped with Red Delicious apples rather than green  :)

We loved the sweet combo of carmel and apples. VERY ADDICTING! We put in chocolate truffles which was a very nice and sweet substitution.

We've been making this dip for years and it NEVER fails to have the plate clean before you're ready to go home. There is NO need for the added sugar though...kinda overkill. Thanks to the other reviews - I had no idea you could dip apples in sprite to keep them from turning brown!

OH. MY. GOODNESS !!  Delicious, and so easy!  I used Smuckers hot caramel topping (that's the name - I didn't heat the topping).  I made it last night for our Christmas Party and the women in particular went crazy over it!  You can go ahead and slice the apples ahead of time...just remember to either dip them in Sprite or keep the slices in cold water with lemon juice added until time to serve.

Easy and wonderful. Cut the sugar in half and use Fruit Fresh (found in the canning section of the grocery store), to keep the apples from browning. Everyone at my party ate this, and everyone asked for the recipe.

OMGosh, so good:) Definitely use green apples like the recipe is written. We tried both -- green won hands down. We used the chopped Toffee bits to save time, but I may buy bars next time to see if there is a difference.  I loved the bits, but my son complained that there were too many of them. Personally I loved them, but maybe the bars would leave bigger pieces and "less of them". I'll be serving this at my next get together sooo yummy

I made this to take to my small group at church and we all LOVED it.  It was so easy to make and was really tasty.  After the apples were gone, my daughters ate the last couple bites of the dip with a spoon!

Very good!  I've made it twice now for autumn apples here in the Midwest.  The first time, per reviews, I only used two pinches of sugar.  Not necessary!  The second time, I used no sugar at all.  It is not needed, as the dip and apples are plenty sweet.  Thanks!

Try soaking your apples in pineapple juice while waiting to serve. Gives the apples great flavor and they won’t turn brown!!

This was okay, but nothing really special. I thought it was very, very sweet and I doubt that I'll make it again. Sorry

I replaced white sugar with brown sugar if you like.  Can also buy the toffee bits instead of chopping candy bars for the same results.

this is good. however I used brown sugar the second time I made it and it turned out way better. also use a little bit of lemon juice on your apples it keeps them from turning brown.

Loved it, loved it, loved it. I brought this to a potluck and I got so many compliments. Everyone wanted the recipe. My daughter liked it so much she asked me to make it for her to bring to her boyfriends parents for Thanksgiving. Thanks for a great recipe.

I would rate this 10 stars if I could!  Don't even bother adding the sugar called for in the recipe, I didn't and it was perfect. This has to be the easiest most yummiest appetizer I have ever made.  Be sure to soak the apple slices in a bowl of cold water with about a tsp. of lemon juice to keep them from turning brown.  Everyone loved this.  You cannot stop at one.  A guaranteed hit for sure!  My new favourite.  Thank you Kirsten!

Made this for a large group of ladies & kids, it was a hit!  I doubled the recipe, but just eyeballed the toppings.  I used mini choc chips & bagged toffee bits.  Next time will try the sprite trick for the apples, as the granny smiths were the only ones that didn't turn brown.  This will be a regular dish for us as it keeps really well in the fridge.

I have made this several times for parties and it is always a hit. I also screwed up one time by leaving the pre-mixed cream cheese part at home (sadly bought something else after realizing an hour from home) and now know that just that part makes a really good dip for fresh whole strawberries...had to use it some how!:)
