Oh dear! I had such high hopes! However… I made it in two smaller 9x12 equivalents and it overran the pans. It sank in the middle and did not cook in the center at all. The middle was still runny after 40 minutes. I may give this recipe another try because it deserves it but …oh dear! UPDATE! UPDATE! I got up early yesterday and tried it again. This time I used 3 1/2 tsp of baking powder instead of TBS, thinking like another reviewer that it MUST be a typo. I also used a 9x12 deep pan. Although it took MUUUUUCH longer to bake...40 minutes or more... it turned out well this time - moist, flavourful and altogether delicious. Phew! I really dislike being defeated by a recipe so kudos to the cook! (That's ME!)

Mixed this up this morning for Easter breakfast.  I halved the recipe, cooked in a smaller and deeper baking dish, and it took about 28 minutes.  It has a nice light and moist texture, and the streusel topping was very good.  In the future, I'll use the suggested pecans on this coffee cake, and will chop them a bit more finely than I did the walnuts.  Shawnee McGee, thanks for sharing your recipe.

I made this for a meeting my husband was having at his office.  It was a huge hit and someone requested the recipe! I love cinnamon so I added a bit more to the streusel.  The bake time was much to low!  After even 20 minutes it was very wet with only about an inch border completely baked.  I added another 15 minutes and it baked perfectly.  As you can see from a previous reviewer, they halved the recipe and still baked it for 28 minutes.

I made a few changes.  I used a bundt pan so I sandwiched all of the strudel between the top and bottom cake pieces.  I used the teaspoons for the baking powder like the reviews said, sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top, and I added an egg (total 3 eggs).  Because of this I ended up baking it at 375 for a total of 45 minutes.  
HOLY MOLEY! It tastes amazing! Would definitely do again and would recommend.

cook time definitely needs longer - I agree with the other two reviewers.  I let mine bake for 30 and it turned out well; otherwise the middle is still wet.

I also added another 1/4 cup of milk to the batter - without it the mixture was more like a thick brownie batter which I didn't love.  flavor and consistency is wonderful!

I also used teaspoons rather than tablespoons for the baking powder.  I subbed fat free yogurt for the sour cream; and used soy milk instead of cow's milk.  The batter was very thick, making it hard to spread and layer, but I managed.  I guess I could have thinned it with a bit more milk, but...I baked it 35 minutes based on the previous reviews and the thickness of the batter, but that was perhaps 5-7 minutes too long. It was not as moist as I would have liked but it was delicious and not only  garnered no complaints, but all raved and made it disappear.

I made a half recipe of this cake today. It came out very delicious. However I will caution everyone that there has to be a mistake in the amount of Baking Powder. I made a couple of changes, but the Baking powder was the most important. I think the author of the recipe meant Teaspoons not Tablespoons. In a half recipe I added 1 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder and it was fine. In addition, after I put half of the batter into the 8 inch square greased baking pan, I dotted 1/4 cup of chunky applesauce all over the surface using a 1/4 tsp. measuring spoon and then I added the streusel. i proceeded with the rest of the recipe as directed, and I baked it for 40 minutes at 360 degrees F (my oven runs cold). IT came out great, and the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because if I had followed the directions as written, it would have been inedible with overwhelming flavor of baking powder.

I used pecans for this since walnuts weren't on hand. It turned out absolutely wonderful after about half an hour in the oven. Perfect amount of cinnamon. Now I just need coffee!

Just made this coffee cake for the first time, and I'm about to go back for seconds (it's still warm from the oven)! It's so good and reminds me a great deal of the one my mom used to make way back when we were kids. I didn't have any sour cream, so I substituted non-fat vanilla Greek yogurt, and it's yummy! I made just 1/2 batch and used a 9X9" pan, and I didn't have any nuts to add, and that's fine, too. My mom rarely, if ever, added nuts to ours, so it was another way to remember my childhood. I'm a fan of brown sugar, so it's helping my sweet tooth, for sure! Enjoy!

Be sure to bake more like 20 - 25 minutes. At 15 minutes, I didn’t even test it, very underbaked. At 20 minutes, depress a finger tip lightly on top & pull away. If it does not spring back, bake another five minutes. Now, check with a tooth pick.

This makes a LOT of streussal topping which is wonderful.  The cake was perfect, flavor was great.  Big hit.

This came out quite nicely.  Definitely will make again.  It was even better the 2nd day (more moist).  We had to make some substitutions because we were running low on ingredients - we used applesauce in place of eggs, ricotta cheese in place of the sour cream, and molasses and white sugar in place of the brown.  I fully intend to make again, and this time do it with all the right ingredients - I expect it will be even better then.

I love this recipe WITH these UPDATES- as others have said it needs 2 1/2 teaspoons of baking powder, NOT tablespoons. And the baking time needs to be 35-40 min.

When my 9th grade son informed me at 9pm last evening that his 1st hour class was having a potluck the next morning, I scrambled to find something for him to bring!   I searched "cinnamon streusel coffee cake" and this was the first recipe that popped up.  Since I had everything & no time to search further, I made this cake.  A few things....first of all, I did teaspoons, not tablespoons, of baking powder.  For the cake batter, I used only 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter, because I thought  2/3 sounded like a lot of butter.  I also added an extra egg and doubled the amount of sour cream.  Because my son was bringing this to school it couldn't have nuts, so I used 1/2 cup of old fashioned oats in the streusel.  I knew that the bake time printed had to be way off,  so I baked it in my 9x13 metal pan for 30 minutes.  Smelled amazing while baking & looked puffy & delicious when it came out.  There was only a few pieces leftover after school, so I got a sample!  Very good, with a distinct, buttery flavor.  Easy to cut, but I will say that it could be a tad moister....mine was a little crumbly.  Next time I'll either add 1/2 cup more sour cream, or will use buttermilk rather than regular milk.  I did add a bit more milk, a little at a time, so my batter was less stiff & easier to spread in the pan.  Glad I ran into this recipe, it worked out great & will be making it again some time, for sure!

This is the second time I made this. The first time I used a gluten free all purpose flour and only used the 3 teaspoons of baking powder instead of tablespoons. The dough was pretty thick, but spreadable. Also I used almond milk (I'm dairy free) unsweetened but vanilla flavor.
The second time I made this I didn't have enough non dairy sour cream so I used applesauce instead. I also cut the sugar back by at least 1/2 cup. I also added cut up Apple pieces between the layers. I really like the second one best!
