Yummy bread recipe! I didn't have quick cooking oats, so I used the old fashioned. Let the bread machine do the work thru the 2nd rise, then took out and made into dinner rolls. Baked 21 minutes at 375 degrees. My family loved them!

I put everything in my bread machine last night and set the timer.  In the morning, I woke up with wonderful smell of fresh bread.  This bread was so moist and very delicious.  I will be making this bread often.

This bread has a wonderful texture and flavor - this is the bread we give as gifts.  I cut the molasses content down to 1/4 c, since it also had honey - just our personal preference, and it turned out perfectly!

This is soooo good.  Sweet and moist.  I have been looking all over for a recipe to rival the one my former stepmother used to make.  I made it on dough cycle and then put in a bread pan to make.  My little ones helped with adding the ingredients.  This is a new family favorite for sure!!! Thanks so much for sharing it.

This bread is delicious! I made the whole thing in the bread machine on the wheat bread setting. I used 2 tsp of active dry yeast, 1 and 1/2 cups of bread flour and 1 and 1/8 cups of wheat flour, and only 1/8 cup of honey. Someone had mentioned that this recipe comes out lopsided but with the ingredients above, mine came out perfectly with a very nice consistency also. I may try it with a little less molasses next time because it was sweet but it was still delicious!

I made this in my bread machine today, and it was wonderful!  It smelled so good while it was baking, I could hardly wait for it to cool off.  I added slightly less molasses than the recipe called for, and the bread was still nicely sweet.  I'll be making this one again soon.

UPDATE: I have also baked this bread in my oven, instead of a bread machine - no problems.  I routinely decrease the molasses to 1/3 cup, and use rolled oats instead of quick-cooking oats.  I use a mix of 2 cups white flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour when I have both available - no problems.

Very tasty, quite heavy as you'd probably expect from the amount of sticky liquids in it!  I set my bread machine to 'sweet' (molasses AND honey I figure it's sweet!), the 2 pound setting (that's what 4 cups dry ingredients usually makes, not 1 1/2 pounds) and to medium crust, and it came up great like any other bread does.  I did use fast-rise yeast though, 1 3/4 teaspoons (bit more than the standard fast-to-regular conversion), which may have helped.  The bread was dense but in a good, chewy way, not in a failed-to-rise way.  Oh, and the bread machine baked it, too, not the oven :-)

I make this one all in the bread machine but I use 2 cups of Whole Wheat flour and 1 cup of Oat flour and it is OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I frequently take this one to work because it's so popular. Just the right amount of sweet.

This IS a 2 lb loaf -- and very sweet. I added about 4 Tblsps of flour during the mix cycle, due to wetness of dough, as noted by others. Unlike the first photo, my bread is so fluffy and soft that it's difficult to cut, and the bread rose all the way to the top of my bread machine. Next time I may cut the molasses in half or use a little wheat flour, to curb the sweetness. I'll also bake the bread in the oven -- in TWO pans. 4 stars.
*****************************************
Okay -- changed 4 stars to 5 today. Because of its sweetness, this bread makes awesome French toast!  Instead of my usual nutmeg, I used cinnamon in the milk/egg mix, since I thought it would better enhance the molasses flavor. Yummy! (Jan 15)

wonderful- cannot wait to use for sandwiches. Made totally in the breadmaker and I substituted the white flour for whole wheat flour. I probably used about 1/4 cup less flour than called for since wheat is denser than the white. Thanks so much.

Delicious bread! I made in my bread machine. I will definitely make this over and over again. I was looking for a squaw bread recipe. This is what I had in mind. I will cut back on the honey or molasses because I think I'd enjoy it even more if it were a little less sweet.

Delicious! This bread rose beautifully, had a moist fluffy texture, and tasted great (not too sweet). According to reviews and prior experience, I made the following modifications: No honey, just full amount of molasses and 1 extra tablespoon veggie oil, bread maker setting was 1.5-2 lb WHEAT loaf although I only used bread flour and oats as recommended, also added 4 extra tablespoons of flour during the kneading cycle because I live in a very humid climate (DE). If I was in Colorado I would use an extra tablespoon of water and no extra flour. My new favorite recipe :)

This bread is way too sweet. I reduced molasses to 1/4c. And even with this reduction it's still more of a "dessert" bread. I also used rolled oats and as a result opted to bake on whole wheat cycle. Make sure to use Light Crust setting. Mine was VERY brown. I must say though that the consistency of the bread was really good: neither airy nor too heavy.

Delicious but very sweet. I made this for a 2nd time and used 2 1/4 tsp of dry active yeast. The top of the loaf was flat. I'll use 2 tsp of yeast next time instead. The bread is still quite tasty, if not as pretty as usual.

We got a bread maker for Christmas, and this was my first attempt at using it (although we had a machine years ago, so I wasn't totally new to how it's done).  I followed the directions, but the dough was very wet so I had to add alot more flour.  The loaf rose well and it tasted great, but the bread was too doughy.  I guess I need more practice with basic breads before I get "fancy" with this kind of thing.  I'll try this recipe another time.

I made this entirely in the breadmaker as well. It was a very sticky dough. I used 2 cups unbleached flour and 1 cup whole-wheat. It rose up very tall (to within 1cm of the machine's window) and even. I will definately make it again, but may leave out the honey, as I found it to be too sweet.

I made this in my Zo today.  The dough was sticky enough after only 3/4 cup water so I did not add the full 1 1/3 cups water.  However, it did not rise at all--one square lump in the center of the pan.  Won't try it again...wasn't worth the waste of the ingredients!

Amazing bread!!! I did the whole thing in my bread maker, but put the yeast on top of everything since I was putting it on a 12 hour cycle so it would be ready in the morning and it was fantastic!!! it was chewy, rich and dense and was just plain amazing!!!

My first go-round with this loaf was a flop - LITERALLY - when I failed to notice the yeast had expired!  The second trial went far better.  I love this bread toasted with some butter/margarine and a slice of cheddar cheese on top.  The sweet/savoury combination is wonderful!  Just be careful - this loaf burns VERY easily in the toaster.   In fact, I would be sure to set your bread machine to 'light' if you'll be baking it right in the machine.

This is yummy bread!!!  I also used 1/2 of the molasses, and the bread still had enough sweetness.  The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 stars, is each time I have made this it has came out lopsided.  It is great with soups, salads, or just with butter.

Nervous at first because the dough was really wet but it turned out awesome! I made no changes, followed the recipe exactly as written. Ate each slice with butter spread on it. I will make it again.

Was absolutely stunning. Sweet and moist and chewy and dark.   I didn't have quick oats, so I subbed for porridge oats and cooked mine on the "whole wheat" setting in my breadmaker and it turned out perfect.

This is very sweet, and a huge loaf of bread.  Not sure it only makes a 1 1/2 lb loaf!  It was rather wet, though--I had to add about 1 1/2 c of flour, so maybe that's what did it.  At any rate, I'm using two loaf pans to bake it in next time.  This does turn out very sweet, not a surprise with all that molasses and honey.  The texture is a bit dense but nice enough for sandwiches and for using with soup, which is what I had it with for lunch today.  thanks for the recipe!

Loved this easy to make bread.  The flavor was amazing and what is more simple than puting ingredients into a bread machine and letting that take care of all the work.  The bread was moist with just the right amount of sweetness.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

excellent. Even substituted using my gluten free flour mix and was terrific. Love it for toast in the morning. My non gluten free friends even liked it and asked for the recipe.

Not as good as my grandpa's version,  but the bread machine certainly is much easier than doing it all by hand!  Took me back in time as I ate it with butter and honey.

Still waiting for this to emerge from the oven, but it smells great. I did the bread by hand, and needed at least another 1 1/4 cups of flour. The thing never rose, so I just popped it into a hilaf pan, and... still not rising. But it will probably make great french toast, or the like.

I followed the directions exactly and tried to make the whole thing in my bread machine. The dough was sticky and barely rose. I added more flour and it became less sticky but never fully baked. It tasted ok, but was heavy and dense.

I bake very often and this bread had a great flavor but did not rise at all! I threw it in and baked it anyway and while taste was great it was understandably very dense. Good as toast, but didn't keep past two days.

Great bread.
I have made it ten times, two times the bread did not rise and was lop-sided - this may be due to the salt effecting the yeast.  given as gifts, drives my office mad when I make it for toast

I followed the recipe exactly except using one cup white flour and two cups whole wheat. Fantastic! My wife thought it tasted exactly like the more expensive, store bought type. The loaf was so big I had to cut each slice in half to fit it in the toaster. This recipe is a keeper.

Okay, I was scared to death to go on with this recipe.  I followed the recipe to the T and it was a mess in the machine.  A normal loaf has a certain look to it on the White Setting and this mess looked like a batter bread.  I had to add at least 3/4 to 1 cup more flour to gain the look required for a proper White Setting bread.  I was fearful with all that extra flour it would be a flat brick but, the loaf came out perfect.  It was absolutely delicious.  I guess I stayed with my gut and it paid off.  Whew.....  We will definitely make this again and follow the same routine.  Thank you for sharing.

Flavourful with a nice texture.  Has more sweetness than I like, so I will be cutting back a bit on the molasses and honey a wee bit on the next round.

Excellent bread - a family favorite.  I ran out of molasses so ended up using half molasses and half honey - we liked it better as it wasn't as strong tasting.  I have used the bread machine to mix the dough, then have it rise in a round casserole dish and bake it in the dish - makes a great round loaf!  This bread does not last very long as my family devours it!!!

I also cut the molasses in half, like several others have said they did. Still plenty sweet, but not cloyingly so. But, it blew up in my Breadman machine! By that, I mean it filled the whole chamber and pressed against the glass, making it a bear to pull out of the pan once it was cooked (and that was after I'd pulled a baseball sized chunk out before the cooking cycle happened. Mutant yeast perhaps?

I made no changes to the recipe in order to give it a proper review.  The dough was much too wet after mixing (looked almost like a batter bread).  After baking, it still was not cooked.  The bread barely rose. In the end, the bread was not palatable, was half cooked, and was very dense (in a bad way).

I love this bread!  I made it as directed but added about a tbs of extra flour as it was mixing because it looked very wet.  I also set it on the "sweet" setting at 2.0 lb loaf as someone else had mentioned.  It rose just enough to fill the pan and tasted great with butter.

This bread is really tasty - definite molasses flavor, and a nice chewy, moist texture. Like other reviewers mentioned, it was a very wet sticky dough, and didn't rise much, but my ciabatta recipe does the same thing so I didn't lose faith!! Just be patient, give it time to rise, and bake as you would a batter bread, not a yeast bread - mine took a good 45 mins. to bake and I have a "fast" oven! Definitely a unique flavor, it will be great toasted!!
