4 stars due to blandness.  I call these "Mexican pinwheels" and everyone loves them, however, I mixed in a 1/2 a pkg of dry taco seasoning, or you can use some ranch pkg mix (add either to taste). Diced green onions are a good addition too. If you know that the folks eating these like spicy food, mix in some cayenne pepper, diced jalapenos, etc.  Try flavored or wheat tortillas for a twist. I like more somethin somethin...but the basic recipe is good for starters. As "Dora" stated, I roll these up, wrap tightly in plastic wrap & refrigerate overnight before slicing. I discard the funky ends of each roll. Also, made fresh salsa for dipping. A fun finger food if you are willing to put a bit of time into this. Plus it yields a lot of "wheels", so to speak - plenty for a party.

I have made this recipe a dozen times myself with a few changes and tips to offer you:

Instead of the chilies, I have used black olives or cold cuts or green peppers.  I also add a little ranch dressing to the mix for added flavour.  I make sure to wrap them in plastic wrap and chill them before slicing, they stay in shape longer this way.  They are a hit every time and look so great.

So incredibly simple! I softened the cream cheese in the micro before mixing and I chilled them a couple hours before slicing. The best part: unlike other tortilla pinwheel recipes, this one looks simple so pickier munchers will try these before the ones with all the different spots in them. That means you don't have to worry about leftovers!

Tip: don't spread to the outside edges of the tortillas that will be the ends of the wrap...that part gets tossed anyway. Also, next time, I'll use smaller tortillas or fewer large ones so there will be more creamy filling in each bite.

These were okay, they were very plain.  I had quite a bit left over.  I don't think that the filling went very far, I only got 6 rolls.  If I make them again, I would probably mix the salsa into the cream cheese mixture or something to zest it up.  Thanks Paige.

These wraps are DELICIOUS!!  Made them for a b-day party, an X-Mas party, and a housewarming party...they were a huge hit every time!  Tasty, inexpensive, and great!  Try it with red and green peppers and colored tortillas for a more festive look!

This was very easy & quick to make. I made it the night before Christmas, put 
them in a zip-lock bag & took them to our daughters house for dinner. We sliced
them there, set them out and they went fast. Everyone loved them. I was lucky
to get some myself. This will be made often. My husband would like to have  them
on hand for munching.

I am always looking for recipes that are quick and simple to make and these are definitely quick and simple.  There is plenty of cream cheese mixture to spread on the tortillas.

These are a good, meatless version of the versatile tortilla roll-up. I had to make a few modifications based on what I had on hand. I substituted a tablespoon of taco seasoning mix for the ranch dressing mix and added chopped black olives. I added only enough sour cream to make the cream cheese easily spreadable, probably 1/2 cup.

I took these as an appetizer for a Mexican-inspired dinner--they were the first appetizer gone!  No one even bothered to dip them in the fresh salsa I had made!  Very good!

I was going to rate these 3 stars, because they seemed like they were going to be pretty plain, so made a few changes and they turned out to be a great hit. To the cream cheese mixture, I added one can of spicy refried beans and a package of taco seasoning. It still seemed plain, so I added more garlic, chili and onion powders and about 1/4 tsp. of ground cumin (this could have been accomplished without the taco seasoning, using greater quantities of the above spices). After spreading the tortillas, I sprinkled some 4-cheese Mexican blend shredded cheese on them before rolling up. It's a good idea to leave about 1-1/2" of one end of the tortilla without the spread, as it oozes out when you roll them up. When it came time to serve 'em, I mixed 1/2 jar of salsa with 1/2 c. ranch dressing in one bowl and put the remaining salsa in another bowl.  This recipe made a lot of little (1") bite-sized snackers, but they kept everyone gathered around the serving tray until they were gone!

I had this over the weekend, but with green onions mixed in.  It was delicious, and the first thing gone at the Easter party.

Very, Very bland.  I even added 1/2 a package of taco seasoning to the mix and it was still bland.  Made it for a party and they were not a hit.

As written, a bit bland, but an excellent base recipe upon which to base your own custom roll-ups.    You will want to add any or all of the following, as befits your taste and what's in your cupboard:  small can chopped olives, 2-4 thinly sliced green onions, small can diced green chilies (mild or hot, you choose), diced jalapenos, 2 tsp. ranch dressing mix (not too much or it will be too salty), 1/2 c to 1 1/2 c shredded sharp cheddar cheese, swap sour cream for some of the salsa or simply reduce the salsa by half or more to cut down on the soggy factor.  Important to make the rollups several hours ahead of time, and before slicing them allow them to chill in the refrigerator to firm them up and allow the flavors to marry.

This was OK, but did find to be a little bland.  I am going to make this again with 8 oz. cream cheese, 8 oz. shredded sharp cheddar, more green chili peppers, and sprinkle with garlic salt.  Sounds good to me!  Thanks Paige!

Yuck!  I really don't think canned green chiles and cream cheese go together at all.  There were hard seeds and slippery skins that did not make for a great mouth-feel.  These were bland and sad and dipping in salsa did not make them any better.  I'm going to delete this recipe as soon as I'm done reviewing it!

Didn't care much for these. They got mushy early on.
