Great recipe for "ultra creamy" mashed potatoes! It's straight forward and just plain delicious. The perfect mashed potato to accompnay your favorite gravy! I always heat up my milk (light cream)in the microwave for a bit before adding it to the potatoes. This is a great base for add-in's to change it up. You just can't go wrong with this classic recipe for comfort food!

To help those who end up with wall paper paste, I cut my potatoes in thin slices or small pieces and rinse them in a collander BEFORE boiling.  This technique will get rid of much of the starch that can make glue out of your potatoes.  ALSO putting them through a hand held food mill OR a potato ricer makes quite a difference.

I use SALTED butter, and add extra salt and instead of pepper I use Mrs. Dash which will really add some pep to the dish.  I usually Taste the potatoes up to 4 times, adding seasoning until they are just right.

These potatoes are probably the best I've ever made - and the only way I'll make them from here on out. My suggestion for the glue factor is to NOT put cold butter/whipping cream into your steaming hot potatoes. That along with over mixing will certainly cause them to "seize" up. I melt my butter in my cream and after it comes to a simmer I add it in. Thanks for the recipe! YUM!! (oh, and I added some salt as I used the reduced sodium chicken broth)

I made these potatoes for Thanksgiving this year and they were the best mashed potatoes I have ever had!  My daughter said, "if I could taste a cloud, I know this is what it would taste like."  I used Yukon Gold potatoes.  AFter draining the chicken broth, I used my electric mixer until potatoes were smooth.  Then added warmed half and half, melted butter and approximately 1/2 cup of the reserved broth.  I added salt and pepper to taste and....PERFECTION.  I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  Best mashed potatoes ever!  :-)

This is a fine recipe - a couple of tips to avoid gluey potatoes, bring the broth and potatoes almost to a boil, reduce heat and just simmer until tender.  Do not over mix them or you develop the potato starch and your potatoes turn gummy.  I put the butter and cream in with the hot potatoes, cover and allow the butter to melt.  Mash with a hand masher - add some reserved broth and finish stirring and mashing.  If you don't have cream milk works just as well and saves you a few calories.

These make an excellent starter base. These are much different than the mashed potatoes I usually make. I had never boiled the potatoes in broth before. This does add a bit of flavor, however I hated having to toss most of the broth afterwards. The only thing I did differently was to add some salt because they were a little bit bland for our liking. I would definitely make these again and add garlic or other seasonings.  Oh, and if your potatoes are "wallpaper paste", you're doing something wrong, like OVERMIXING! I also don't get the "got cold very fast" comment by another reviewer. That's the recipe's fault?

Boiling the potatoes in broth adds an unbelievable amount of flavor to mashed potatoes!  Adding the reserved broth just makes them better.  I gave this only four stars because I like it better with half & half or heavy cream but this is an excellent start to a great recipe!

I loooove this potatoes!  They're absolutely heavenly!  The only thing was that I found 'light cream' hard to find, so I ended up using whipping cream.  Delicious!  I also recommend adding a dash of garlic powder, and a tablespoon salt.

Excellent base recipe for some awesome mashed potatoes! I first tried it according to the recipe and found it not quite to my personal liking. Next time I tried it, I used heavy cream, garlic powder, and butter. Whatever you do, don't add salt! the chicken broth has more than enough salt in it.

This was my first time making mashed potatoes using Swanson Chicken Broth and I have to say, it was delicious.  I was really surprised at how flavorful they were and so easy to make.  I didn't have light cream, only heavy cream, so I added just under a 1/2 C. of the heavy cream to the mixture.  I'll make these again for the upcoming holidays!

I made these potatoes for dinner, and they were very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, and mashed them by hand.  Good texture, good flavor, not chicken-y at all.  I believe the broth gave them more of a yellow color than we are accustomed to.  Since I use unsalted butter, I felt the recipe needed a little added salt.

This was good. An interesting departure from the plain old mashed potatoes. I used Yukon gold potatoes, as I like the texture and flavor better. The broth added just a little more depth. I'll use this again.

This was a very good way to boil the potatoes. The broth gave them good flavor. I added smoked roated garlic, sour cream, cheese and bacon to them..My family all loved it.

I thought these mashed potatoes were okay, but the after taste of the broth was a little strange to me.  It does add a different flavor, but I didn't feel it was GREAT.  Also, I did have to explain to everyone that I used the broth to cook the potatoes since they ALL noticed the aftertaste.  I would say these potatoes are a matter of preference.

I thought this was a very good basic mashed potato recipe.  I do think that it developed a greater depth of flavor by cooking them in the chicken broth.  This will be a tip that I use in the future.   I read that some people had a problem that the potatoes turned into "glue" or "paste".  I didn't have that problem at all. I used yukon gold potatoes, so, not sure if that made a difference or not.

Cooking the potatoes in chicken broth added a depth of flavor you don't get in plain old mashed potatoes. I used reduced fat milk in place of the cream with a great result. These taste great all on their own without gravy. Loved them!

My family loved these.  I say "these," but I only made one potato to serve three of us.  I covered the diced potatoes with the broth to cook them, and when they were done, I added about 2 tablespoons of cream and 1 tablespoon of butter (heated to room temperature).  I barely mixed them, added pepper, and that was it!  No salt needed because of the broth I used.  Very easy, light, and fluffy!  Thanks for this method!

We liked these mashed potatoes and yes they were creamy but I did have to add a touch of salt for our liking.  Also the ingredients don't mention to peel the potatoes.  Of course, I know to do this but maybe a new cook wouldn't. Don't waste the broth, use it to make gravy.

I liked these, but I needed them to have a bit more oomph.  I added some green onions and feta cheese (would have used cheddar, but I was out and that was the only kind I had!)  I made these with the Swanson vegetable broth, also.  Great basic recipe that you can tweak according to your mood!

A better way to make mashed potatoes!  I liked using the chicken broth instead of my regular way - it felt lighter and healthier!  I added some garlic salt and lots of pepper - yum!

This mashed potatoes recipe is amazing.
I upped this to use an entire eight pound bag of potatoes and it turned out great. I did heat my cream & butter on the stove top before adding it into the potatoes. Other than that made as directed. Wonderful!

These were perfect! I let my 9 year old daughter make them and she usually only eats fake potatoes but she loved these.  My whole family enjoyed them. I did add horseradish and a little sour cream because I always do for potatoes, otherwise I followed perfectly!

We really loved this recipe!  I had never cooked my potatoes in the broth before, but I will be doing this from now on.  What a difference it made in the flavor!  I used 2% milk instead of light cream because it's what I had on hand and I used a manual potato masher because I like the consistancy of the finished dish that way.  These were so goood!  Thanks for sharing!

I love cooking the potatoes in broth and I can count on the Swanson Broth to give such wonderful flavor each time I use it. Creamy and tasty and easy. I used the broth from the potatoes in more of my holiday cooking.

Perfect potatoes! I liked the addition of chicken broth. I've heard of doing it that way before, but I've never tried it myself. I'm sure I will try it again that way again in the future.

These were good mashed potatoes but,  honestly, I don't think that the expense of almost a full quart of chicken broth made them that much better.  I most likely would add some chicken broth to my boiling water in the future, but I won't use a full quart.

These were good, but I have to admit that I didn't really measure anything, just eyeballed it..They definitely need salt, and I added a little garlic powder, which was a nice addition. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a good solid recipe.  I like using yukon gold potatoes for mashed potatoes because they are so buttery.    I quartered the potatoes so they took longer to boil, about 20 minutes.  What size you cut the potatoes is important because the time required will need to be adjusted.  Keep this in mind when trying to time everything for a holiday dinner.  The potatoes were very good.  Like others mentioned, the broth makes the potatoes a little more yellow or gold than white.  I used milk instead of cream and it still tasted great.

So delicious though you dont use the whole amount of broth! That can be misleading for beginners so only use a little bit.  Also for those who get the pasty potatoes you probably overcooked them or over mixed them. the only time my potaotes have ever been pasty is because they over cooked and most the water boiled out. But seriously this recipe is the best!

I made the recipe today came out amazingly delicious. The whole family enjoyed it. Minus one of my boys he said it did not have flavor in it. Which was true so I’ll have to figure out what more I can add to give it a little extra flavor. All and All it was delicious will be making again. Thank you for sharing your recipe with me and others.

Substitute the butter and milk with cold pressed olive oil and garlic...or Earth Balance vegan butter.  You can also make this a very flavorful dish by adding mashed rutabaga or mashed cauliflower, some chives and black pepper.

These were OK. Kids loved them, husband said they tasted like regular homemade mashed potatoes for him. I liked the flavor boost the stock gave it but the texture wasn't that great (not wallpaper paste but...slightly pasty nonetheless.)

Mmmm mashed potatoes. I liked the flavor the broth added to the potatoes, it's a bit expensive for an everyday thing but for special occasions I would do it again.

VERY GOOD!  My only change was to use 2% milk in place of the light cream as it was all I had.   It's hard to imagine that these could taste any better.  Thank you Campbell's Kitchen for sharing this recipe!

I admit I hate mashed potatoes so I’m rating this from my family’s comments.  They enjoyed the side dish and thought it was very good.

I cut the recipe in half using two decent sized Russet potatoes.  Overall the potatoes were good and I could taste the broth in them.  I did have to add salt.  I saved the remaining broth and made gravy.  I probably will do this again but I don't make mashed potatoes very often.

Wow, I would have never thought to use chicken broth in mashed potatoes...they were amazing!  I am going to use this recipe from now on for awesome flavorful creamy mashed potatoes!  I always use a few dashes of white pepper and garlic powder too.

These were delicious!  I followed the recipe (though I had to guesstimate the size/number of potatoes as I used white potatoes) and was super pleased w/the results. I didn't cover my boiling potatoes and cooked longer than 10 minutes (until the were about to fall apart when poked w/a fork).  I mashed in my KA w/the whisk attachment (thanks, Sanzoe, for teaching me that trick!) and they were fluffy and flavorful. I did add sea salt during mashing, but not nearly as much as I usually do when i boil the potatoes in water.

A very easy recipe and quite good. I did not use large potatoes, yet needed the amounts of liquid listed. I also had to add salt.

My first time using anything different than water to boil the potatoes. It really added a nice flavor to the potatoes. My family liked. I would say this is a keeper.

Pretty typical mash.  I often boil my taters in stock with garlic cloves, so this wasn't entirely new to me.  Came out similar to the usual, though I did add garlic salt to perk these up as they definitely need salt to taste as well.  Used scrubbed redskins, unsalted butter, and heavy cream.
