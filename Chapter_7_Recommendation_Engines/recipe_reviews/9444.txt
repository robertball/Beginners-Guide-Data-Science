This fudge was great.  I guess I guessed correctly that you should use POWDERED sugar, not granulated.  This explains the large quantity.

This is a terrible recipe for fudge!  It is not descriptive enough about the cooking techniques - very bad for beginners like me!  It says to heat the mixture, but it doesn't say what heat setting on your stove, and whether or not to stir it.  After you remove it from heat, it doesn't say if it should cool down to room temperature before adding the marshmallow, and it doesn't say if you should let it set in the refrigerator or not.  As a result, my first try at fudge came out terrible - the chocolate burned in the pan either because I had the heat too high (I had it set on the "medium" setting of my dial) or because I didn't stir and maybe I should have.

This recipe has been far from rewarding for the effort and time involved. Despite my stirring constantly for 45 minutes, the sugar never really melted to give the fudge the smoothness it should have. Moreover, it got burned at the bottom, although I used the low setting on the range. After pouring the fudge in the pan, it hardened like a rock, making cutting difficult. A total waste of time and ingredients.

12 15 00  I tried this recipe today, and it turned out terrible, sugary. I think the sugar amount must be wrong compared to others on the web. I will probably throw it away. Totally disappointed.  Mrs. Sheets

Not bad... IF you use powdered sugar.  SIFTED powdered sugar.  Otherwise you'll get little pellets.  Good flavor.  Not sure if I'll use again.

I tried the recipe twice and just couldn't get it to work.  I think the amount of sugar listed must be incorrect.  It was very difficult to get the mixture to a boiling point, it scorched easily and the finished product was very "gritty".

I am so sorry to put a bad review on here, but here I go.  YUCK!!!!  This is terrible!  To gritty, I wish now I had used powdered sugar, as recomended by others.  I made this for Christmas, and what a disapointment!

I wore my arms out making this...it was incredibly thick to begin with and was NEVER syrupy...I really think the measurements must have been printed wrong on the recipe...4 cups of sugar???  It sounded like a lot but I trusted this recipe since it said it was used in a candy shop.  As the temp. got higher it started smelling burnt and the sugar NEVER dissolved.  I just wasted a bunch of money and the fudge is no good...sorry to be negative but it's pretty disappointing.

This was the worst fudge recipe I ever tried.  Either the recipe instructions were incomplete, or the wrong ingredients were listed.  I wasted a lot of ingredients and am still trying to scrub out my pan.

Amount of sugar must be wrong.  I thought I would try it exactly like the recipe - terrible mess.  I added evaporated milk and boiled it until the mess dissolved, then beat it at length in my kitchen aid - then put it in jars and gave it away for fudge topping for ice cream.  I had also wasted 2 cups of pecans.  Next time, I'll follow my cooking instincts.

This should definitely be modified to specifically say POWDERED sugar, not regular. Mix was way to thick in the beginning and was extremely difficult to get to temperature was very grainy now adding milk in a hope to salvage. I am going back to my grandmothers way from now on, no more fake shortcut recipes.

This is either the exact recipe off of the jar of marshmallow creme, or its very similar.  I can't understand why everyone had to use powdered sugar.  My family has been making this for years, and its never turned out badly.  Its actually the only fudge I will eat!

I used SIFTED confectioner's sugar (also called icing sugar or powdered sugar).  And I used a double boiler when heating the mixture just to make sure it didn't burn.

DO NOT follow this recipe!  I am a "seasoned baker" and followed the recipe to a T.  If the recipe is right, then use powdered sugar, not granulated--but I have not tried that version yet...taste is good, but gritty as heck, don't waste $15 in ingredients by following this!

This was a pretty bad recipe and now I have to go buy something for the party I'm going to.  The sugar never melted and I ended up with very gritty fudge.  A huge waste, would not make it again.

This recipe is terrible, maybe powdered sugar should of been mentioned!
DO NOT USE REGULAR GRANULATED SUGAR. It will not come out as something you would want to eat. Very disappointed with this and no way would a real grandmother claim this.

This was horrible! It would have been fine if it hadn't had the sugar but it turned gritty, and tasted like someone had dumped cat litter in the batter! I did not read reviews until after I made this, a mistake I have learned from for sure!
