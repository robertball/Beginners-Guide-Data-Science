We didn't like this Baba Ghanoush.  There shouldn't be yogurt in the dip...not to mention the teraki sauce.  There is another baba ghanoush on this website that lists tahini paste and sesame seeds.  We are going to give that a try.

While many Baba Ghanoush recipes do not call for yogurt, it is not that uncommon either. I enjoyed this dip. However, being a garlic lover, I did add a bit more garlic.

This recipe was a nice surprise given I don't really like eggplant or yogurt.  It's creamy, yummy!  I pureed the eggplant for a smoother texture.

I omitted the teriyaki sauce.  We made it without the yogurt at first but after tasting it, decided to add the yogurt.  Quite delish!  I used 4 cloves of mashed garlic because we like garlic.

I didn't like this much.  All I can taste is the eggplant and I even added more salt and teriyaki sauce.

I added a little more salt than was called for - this is a great party dip for either bread or veggies.

Very good. I did only one eggplant and skipped the teriyaki. I will definitely use this as a base recipe again. Oh I also put the eggplant in the blender to make it smoother.

I loved this.  Although I made a lot of changes, I would guess it would taste great as written.  First, I didn't have yogurt on hand (very unusual for me) so I used sour cream.  I made tahini from scratch, and it was kind of bitter, so I used less than the 1/4 c. although my husband thought it could have used more.  Also, when I was reading about bitter tahini, a lot of people said the olive oil can make it bitter, and that it really doesn't need it, so I didn't want to add olive oil to the baba ghanoush in case it would make that bitter.  I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I used a few dashes of coconut aminos garlic sauce.  It was really delicious, and I'm sure next time I will use the yogurt, and a little more tahini if I can make some less bitter, and it will be great.

This is a very creamy but healthy option as a dip.  It was great but maybe a little bland and needed a little something extra for a taste kick. I didn't have the teriyaki sauce  so maybe that would have done it.   Overall, I would make it again taste for the calories-  it works!
