These cookies are really good. I used part margarine and part shortening (instead of all shortening). The dough was kind of soft even after refrigerating overnight but still well worth baking. I will send this recipe to my family and friends (along with a note of where it came from).

I had been looking for a recipe for these cookies since my sister and I can't locate the one our deceased mother used when we were little.  the changes I made to make this "mom's" recipe: I only had dark brown sugar so used that.  I used a stick of butter instead of shortening.  I used two squares of semi-sweet chocolate to give it a sweeter and more chocolatey taste.  These are good cookies, unfrosted, with the above changes!

Positives:  1)Very easy to prepare, 2)Refrigerated and sliced very easily, and 3)Very nice texture after baking.  Negatives: 1)Little to no chocolate taste and 2)Not very sweet. Made these exactly as written.  If you plan to decorate with icing, you will solve the sweet issue.  If you are relying on a chocolate taste, think again.  These would do well as a sandwiching cooking.  I will try again and add cocoa or just leave all the chocolate out and add almond extract and poopy seeds.

Although these were very good, these did not have that deep, rich chocolate flavor that my family loves.  I used 2 ounces of chocolate and also added chocolate chips after reading the reviews.  I had contemplated adding espresso powder when making this and now wish I had to enhance the chocolate flavor.   We donâ€™t like our cookies overly sweet so we thought the amount of sweetness was perfect for us.  Should you choose to make this recipe and add chocolate chips, use a serrated knife to cut the cookie dough or it will break apart on you.

If you want a cookie that tastes like a Girl Scout Thin Mint and yet is Christmasy, try this recipe. Then when the cookies are cool, coat the top with melted mint chocolate chips, and then sprinkle on Colored sugars to make it a holiday cookie. Yummy!!

These are wonderful and because the dough is refrigerated, you can make them a cookie sheet at a time. BTW, I made mine without the chocolate - they don't need it.

I love this cookie! After reading some of the reviews I did increase the chocolate by melting some chocolate chips. If I baked them a little less they were more brownie like and a little more they were a crisp cookie great with tea or coffee. I forget how nice it is to have refrigerator cookies on hand. I am planning on making these a regular treat in my house.

First off I use this mix for my Rx. I make my butter and start there. I also make fine  chopped cashews and some cashew butter. 
Because it is a frozen roll my cookies are very uniform in size. I get no taste of the butter only perfectly tasty cookies. Medical strength is up to how you make the butter. 
By far the best cookie for my needs.
Yes I have a prescription.
Other than butter and cashews I used the recipe as is. But adding more chocolate and espresso powder is a great idea. Enjoy.

I baked these cookies this morning and they came out perfect and delicious!  The only thing I did different was to use 3 squares of the unsweetened chocolate instead of 1 1/2 - gave them a more chocolatey flavor.  The consistency of the dough made them very easy to slice after chilling - no wasted dough from broken slices -am adding the recipe to my list of Christmas cookies for next  year

My Mom always used the packaged refrigerator cookies (sometimes found in the ice cream section) to make a delicious dessert for her bridge parties.  Simply beat 1 pint of heavy whipped cream (not too dry: stop before peaks are too stiff), with 1 t. vanilla and 1 T. sugar (optional).  Place some cookies along the bottom of a pan. Crumble the rest and mix into whipped cream with a spatula.  Pour mixture into pan, and refrigerate for at least 12 hours before eating.  The whipped cream will permeate the cookies and make them soft.  SOOO good, and SOOOO easy!
