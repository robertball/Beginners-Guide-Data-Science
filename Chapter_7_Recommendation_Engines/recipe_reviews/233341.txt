Excellent! If a pie crust is still flaky the next day, then I consider it a great pie crust. I did use lard since family members are allergic to soy based shortenings. I chilled the dough for 10 minutes. I sprinkled a small amount of flour on waxed paper, then rolled the dough between two pieces of waxed paper. Easy Peasy!

Loves it! Tried making other types of crust bit this one beats all! Instead of orange juice I used Sunny D "smooth" gave a really great zest! Used for a pumpkin pie and it stays flaky! Loved.

It was amazing. I used coconut oil instead of shortening I also used fresh squeezed orange juice. I used about 3 tblsp of the OJ. I then used a tbslp of butter on top layer and sprinkled sugar on top to give it that crisp.

I make this recipe all the time and get rave remarks.  I change the shortening to 1/2 butter ande shortening.  Very good and a little French.

The recipe was perfect, however amounts are off in my opinion. 

The crust was perfectly flakey and so easy to make. I am giving 4 stars only because both times I made it I didnâ€™t have enough dough for the bottom OR the top!

Next time I will simply make more using this recipe. I think a simple edit to let everyone know what size this is for. My pie pans were the only ones at the store so I cannot imagine they were too big or anything. 

I attempted to roll it out big enough to fit and this resulted in it being too thin.  

Such a great recipe anyway!!!

I used this recipe with the "Grandma Ople's Apple Pie" recipe and it turned out a delicious pie!! The top crisped up really nice, I only had cherry juice in the house so I used that instead of orange juice so it was pink when it was raw, but it still turned out very nice. It was sweet enough it complimented the filling but not so sweet that it overshadowed it. It was an easy to make, good texture to eat pie crust I would definitely use again.

I LOVE this pie crust recipe. I have always had issues with pie crusts, and I've made this one a few times and it turns out perfect every time. It's light and flakey, and had a nice buttery flavor. In the past my crusts would be tough, and flavorless. Great recipe! Thank you!

Delicious! Thank you for this recipe! I used butter, not shortening, so I didn't need as much orange juice.

Great recipe! Will use it again!

Complete disaster, I had to find a store opened on Thanks Giving morning to buy a pre-made crust.
I added 50% to the recipe and it still wasn't enough dough to fit a 9" plate.
It was so thin I wasn't able to even transfer it to the plate.
What a waste of time!  does all recipes even test these recipes?
All my time to make the crust was thrown in the trash!!!! :-(

I had to add a little more flour and shortening because my pie pan was larger.  The dough is so easy to make and so easy to put into the pie pan.  It was one of the flakiest crusts I have every had.  I love this recipe and will use it from now on!
Way to go MOM!!!

Simple and plain, would probably use this for a shepards pie but not a sweet pastry.  It was nice and flaky too.

I made this today for an apple pie. Maybe it was just me, but I had to add water as it was too dry when I tried to roll it out. If I made it again I'd make 1.5x the recipe so it wasn't as thin.
