WOW!! These are so good we have a hard time stopping at 1 or 2! I pour boiling water over the prunes, apricots and dried cranberries (which we like better than raisins) so they can get soft and plump up then use the water off the dried fruit for my 2T. I puree the prunes in the blender with the liquid ingredients. When the prunes and liquid are blended well, I add the apricots and pulse a few times to chop, then the nuts and cranberries. That way there is no chopping and all the liquid ingredients are in one place and ready to pour into the dry. The dough is stiff, but needs no extra liquid..especially with the softened fruit which adds a little more moisture. We stir as much as possible then finish with our hands! Most ovens are different but we usually end up baking these for 8 1/2 to 9 minutes as they do get dry if baked too long and are so much better a little underbaked. May help to do a few test cookies to get the time right.

This recipe was great!  Just helpful hint to all, you can use baby food prunes, for the prune puree.  It is alot faster!

This is a phenomenal recipe! I took some of the advice from the other reviews and made a few changes to turn these into Chocolate Chocolate Chip Breakfast Cookies. I used 3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour instead of white, and (because these are for my kids) I processed the rolled oats to a fine consistency in the food processor. I also added 2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa to the dry ingredients. I substituted 3/4 cup unsweetened applesauce for the prune puree, and omitted the dried fruit and nuts. I added a bag of high quality dark chocolate chips.  I scooped out the dough onto a baking sheet and put it in the freezer for a few minutes for ease of handling.  Then I patted down the dough and wrapped the cookies to freeze. This way, I can just pull these out of the freezer and bake them fresh before school every morning.  My kids LOVE these!

I own a small espresso cafe and bakery and we made these cookies for the first time on Wednesday.  The batter was a little dry so we added an extra quarter cup of prune puree.  I couldn't believe how fast they sold.  We ended up making them again on Thursday and Friday because demand was so high.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Made these great cookies today changing a few things 1.) I also used baby food prunes less time consuming. 2.) I cut the apricots with my kitchen shears 3.) I used 1 cup of applesauce in place of the 1/2 cup canola oil,it makes the dough a little more moist and easier to work with.  Hope you find this helpful.

These are wonderful--just like Baker's Breakfast Cookies!  I did make a few changes to suit my needs.  I used half whole wheat flour, substituted chopped peanuts for the walnuts, cut the sugar down to 1 1/2 cups, and used olive oil instead of canola.  They were wonderful!  (I've made three batches in the last week!)

These were great!! I tried them with applesauce instead of the prune puree and baked them for the 10 minutes so they were more like cookies.  The kids loved them.

These cookies are sooo good! Really only bake these for 8 - 10 minutes, or they get dry. They are like a muffin and a cookie, so if they are overcooked, they get dry. I made a few substitutions, I added a dried fruit mix of dried apricots, dried apples and prunes, chopped; I substituted applesauce for the prune puree; proccesssed the oats in my food processor until fine, like another reviewer; I substituted 2 cups of wheat flour for 2 cups of the all purpose flour; I used 1 tsp. of cinnamon; omitted the nuts and added 2/3 cup cocoa powder and chocolate chips because I wanted the kids to like them. They were delicious! Perfect for breakfast. I did like another reviewer and patted some of the cookies out and froze them, then I can throw them in the oven in the morning. Yum!

Chopping the dried fruits, making prune puree was time consuming.  The dough is very thick and dry; I used 1/2 c. water instead of 2 Tbsp.  I mixed by hand, like kneading heavy bread dough, so I wouldn't burn out the motor on my electric mixer.  Cookies turned out nicely, freeze well.

My daughter just had a baby & I made up a batch of these to help out w/ getting breakfast for the older kids. They're delish! I used 2 jars of plum baby food for the prune puree & I used equal amounts of golden raisins, dried apricots & dried pineapple bits. I baked for 10 minutes & got chewy cookies. At 8 minutes, they were still pretty raw. Thansk for a great recipe Jennifer!

Loved theses cookies!  I made them for a brunch baby shower.  I used four whole eggs instead of the whites and then I thought it was still too dry so I added about 1/2 cup of applesauce.  Then I added dried apricots, coconut, pecan pieces, about 3/4 cup shredded carrots and about 1/3 cup of dried cranberries (I let them sit in some hot water to plump them up a bit.).

Great recipe. Don't forget to add the sugar with the dry ingredients - the recipe doesn't mention sugar in the steps! 

My 3-year-old ate hers up in 30 seconds flat. I used a 5-grain hot cereal instead of plain oatmeal, and used half whole wheat flour. I ran out of brown sugar after half a cup (oops!) so I used white sugar for the rest and added a 1/2 cup of molasses to the liquid ingredients. Didn't have enough apricots on hand, so I used some dried cranberries, too. 8 1/2 minutes in the oven was just about perfect. I got 48 cookies out of this recipe. I can't wait to try messing around with different combinations of fruit, and cocoa sounds great too.

I am so happy with these! A great snack that's easy to take on the go and I feel better about giving these to my kids than processed snacks. I used applesauce instead of prune puree because that's what I had on hand, and 1/2 white whole wheat flour.

I used wheat flour and reduced the amount to 3 1/2 cups,1/3 cup of lite applesauce in place of the oil, 1 cup brown sugar with splenda in place of the 2 cups of brown sugar, and 2 baby food jars of carrots in place of the prunes. Oh my goodness, delicious!!!! I wrapped each cookie individually and placed in a ziploc bag in the freezer and they are great when thawed.  My daughter is always asking for more. I make hers with chocolate chips and she says they are better than any granola bar I've ever bought.

ooo, yummy! I halved the recipe and used all applesauce instead of prune puree and oil for ease/healthiness. I also omitted the other dried fruits and nuts and just used 1/2 cup raisins to make them "oatmeal raisin" flavored. the recipe yield is dead-on (for once, lol!). i measured them out using a 1/4 cup and got 15 great-sized cookies.  My only regret is that i cooked them for 10 minutes and i think that's why they're a little tough.  They didn't seem "done enough" for my liking at 8 minutes, but i think taking them out then would've yielded a softer, moister cookie. Regardless, they taste fantastic and i can't wait to make them again!  Very healthy and delicious for snacks or breakfast, thanks!

I was trying to find something similar to the Quaker Oatmeal chocolate chip breakfast cookie, and this seemed close.  I too tweaked it.  I replaced half the flour with whole wheat, I added 1/2 cup powdered milk, 2 T gound almonds, 1T ground Flax seed just to up the nutrition since I made these for my kids.  I replaced the water with apple juice, replaced prune puree with applesauce and added an additional 1/4 applesauce to compensate for the additional dry ingredients.    I also used chocolate chips.  I also pulverized the oatmeal so my kids wouldn't know it was made with oatmeal.  I actually think these taste better than the quaker.  Will definitely make again.

These were very good- much better than the store bought!  I don't keep any prunes on hand so I substitutes mashed banana and they turned out great!!  Very moist and chewy and tasted like the perfect bowl of oatmeal!

Scrumptious!I LOVE this cookie! They never last long--but can be frozen nicely. I add an extra teas. cinnamon, a teas. of pumpkin pie spice, a little extra vanilla, and I use 3 large whole eggs and an extra 1/2 cup of applesauce.
No nuts--I add dried blueberries, cherries, or cranberries. I usually cook them 9-11 minutes on parchment.

My family loves these cookies for breakfast.  They are filling and taste great.  I made a few changes after reading comments.  I used 3 1/2 c whole wheat flour. 1 package (2 containers) of Gerber stage 2 prunes and apples and used craisins instead of the apricots.

Yummy. Made a few changes: Decreased sugar to 1 cup, used whole wheat flour, used coconut oil instead of canola, used pumpkin puree instead of prune plus added 1/4 cup applesauce, used 5 tablespoons flax seed plus 15 tablespoons water instead of egg whites, used dates instead of apricots.
It was really dry and crumbly to work with and the exterior of the final product was crumbly, but the inside was moist and chewy. I might try grinding the oats a bit first next time.

I've been looking for a home made version of granola bars for my kids & this is it! These were surprisingly good, although I had to tweak the recipe with what I had on-hand - dried cherries in place of raisins, almonds for the walnuts, egg beaters instead of egg whites, whole wheat flour, and blackberry jam for the prune puree. I also replaced a bit of flour with 10 grain breakfast cereal. My 2 & 7 year old liked these even though they were ugly (the jam made them greyish).

Warning!  The recipe instructions do not tell when to add the sugar.  I added 1 cup at the end with the fruit and they still turned out well.  You have to use your hands to mix, not your mixer, dough is very thick.  Any advice on how to make prune puree, e-mail me, cinnamonsmithrn@yahoo.com.

I REALLY love the healthiness factor of these - oil instead of butter, egg whites and all the healthy fruit and nuts - and they still have a great texture and taste!  I used Smart Balance oil and did half whole wheat flour, half white.  I also didn't have any prunes, so I used canned pumpkin, which worked great and added a lovely autumny color.  I also didn't have apricots on hand... so I did a mixture of raisins, dried cherries, dried cranberries and walnuts.  Oh and I added some peanut butter chips.  ;-) I absolutely LOVE having these healthy little breakfast cakes - grab and go without the guilt!  I keep thinking of other options/substitutes/add-ins; mashed bananas, applesauce as many of you mentioned instead of the prune puree...add-ins like chopped apples, a caramel or cream cheese glaze on top, chocolate chips, crushed bran flakes, peanut butter... the options go on and on! Two things tho: unless I'm missing something, there's no mention of adding the brown sugar in the instructions of the recipe, so don't forget that.  Also, I noticed that they never really look "done" when they come out of the oven, which can encourage overbaking.  You just have to trust that they're done and take them out, that way they'll remain soft.

This is a good basic recipe.  There is alot of room for variations.  I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, used applesauce instead of prune puree, used figs instead of apricots, and almonds instead of walnuts(I had these things on hand).  I used 3 whole eggs instead of just whites.  I also soaked the fruits in boiling water like other reviews suggested and used the water for the 2 tbs.  When I baked them for 8 min, they were still doughy so I did them all for about 12 and they were just great.  Pair with a glass of milk and you have a perfect, quick breakfast.

So good you wouldn't know they are healthy! I used applesauce in place of the oil and lined my pan with parchment paper. I used wheat flour instead of bleached and added just a few chocolate chips. I used craisens and raisens and no nuts. So yummy, even my 19month old loves them!

These were good but a little dry.  I will try to bake them a little less next time.  I added baby food prunes and dates instead of apricots.  My kids liked them and they were easy to grab on the way to work in the morning.  I would like to have a little more texture and a bit less dry cookie, and so may experiment with nuts and fruits and flavorings.  Very good with a few personal improvements.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were amazingly soft and delicious!  I took five dozen to work and everyone looked at me rather skeptically when I said they were low fat as I take sweet fatty goodies usually - they were gobbled up in no time!  Warning though; they are very soft and will stick together so don't throw them in the cookie jar; layer with parchment or cellophane inbetween the layers.  I will definitely make these over and over again.

I love these cookies. Great with your morning coffee! It did take a while to puree the prunes and chop the apricots, but I think it's worth it. These are very tasty and filling. The suggestion I have is to stick to the recipe with greasing the cookie sheet. I tried using my baking stone and they turned out okay, but wanted to stick to it. Plus the bottoms were a little too soft. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made this recipe over and over.  I half it because it makes a lot. I have added chopped fruit like cranberries, prunes, raisins, etc.  On occasion I have added a big spoonful of peanut butter, honey, black strap molasses.  I use 2 whole eggs instead of egg whites. I have added banana and mango.  What ever is in my kitchen.  Absolutely delicious every time!!!  I bake for 10 minutes and they look under done but they are not. The only recipe I use for breakfast cookies!

Really enjoyed!! Yum!!  I am not sure if they are truly filling but they are definitely delicious!  I made mine into bars instead of cookies and then just cut them into squares.  I even froze half a batch to have at a later date.  The dough is really hard to work with so bars are the way to go!  Just spray the pan a bit first.  Will make again and may eliminate or cut down the apricots.

These cookies are actually very good - don't let the light and unappealing color of the photo fool you (sorry!) Mine were darker and looked more appetizing.  I was nervous though, the dough was very sticky and tough to work with and when the cookies came out they smelled like raw flour and oats I was afraid I'd need to throw the whole thing out.  But my kids and I loved them, very moist, flavorful and addicting!  I used applesauce in place of the prune and cranberries, mini chocolate chips and pecans for my add-in.  Love that you could really put in anything you want!!

Not that these cookies need another review, but they are just SOOO good, I had to put my 2 cents in. I only made a few changes, based on other reviews that I read, I used 3c of whole wheat flour and 1c of all purpose flour. I used 2 whole eggs and 2 whites. I wanted some of the nutrients from the yolks and we are not watching our cholesterol. I also changed the add-ins based on what I had in the house. I used raisins, dry apples and white chocolate chips. They turned out so so delicious that it is hard to stop at one. I had to put them in the freezer (and they freeze and thaw beautifully) just to keep us from eating them all in one day! My one year old and my husband love them.

These are FANTASTIC! I divided the batch in half and made one with dried fruit and the other with pumpkin.  For both, I used 1.5 cups whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup oat bran in place of the white flour (to help polish my husband's cholesterol even better!), cut the sugar to 2/3 cup each (and mixed with the dry ingredients), and used 1/2 cup egg substitute for the whites.  For the dried fruit cookie, I replaced the oil and prune puree with 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce.  I got an antioxidant fruit & nut mix from the local grocer, and poured boiling water over 1 cup of it while I mixed the other ingredients.  I then drained the fruit before adding it in.  It made the dough nice and moist (like thick oatmeal).  I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop these onto the parchment papers and a spatula to smush them down with, and ended up with exactly 11 cookies, which baked for 9 minutes.  Don't leave them in any longer if you can help it!  I ended up over-baking the pumpkin ones since they seemed a little undercooked, and now they're a little tough.  For those, I used 1/2 cup pumpkin puree for the oil & prune, used 1.5 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon, and a handful of raisins at the end instead of the fruit & nuts.  They were all right, but I think that's mostly due to my baking them for 10-11 minutes.  They were also not as moist at the fruit ones, so I might add a little more pumpkin next time, too.  Also, instead of using my hands, I noticed that the fruit cookie wa

I had a delicious cookie like this from a convenience store once, but this one is better and better for you.  Due to the heaviness of the dough, I use a dough hook on my mixer and combine the ingredients in the traditional cookies/cake-baking way.  I mix the sugar, eggs, water, vanilla, applesauce (I can't abide prunes) & oil, then add the dry ingredients on top.  I like to use sunflower seeds or Grape-Nuts in the dry ingredients.  Use your imagination here!

This was a nice recipe for oatmeal cookies. When cooked for around 8 min. the cookies were too soft and raw. I found that 10 min. worked well. Even though I left out the nuts and other stuff it still tasted good.

These are really good, I made half of the recipe, used 1/4 cup cocoa, 3/4 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup whole wheat flour, 1/2 cup applesauce, no oil, I added 1/4 cup mini chips, only 1/4 cup raisins. They are great and close to Bakers. I am making PB and double chocolate mint, pumpkin cranberry and others in the near future. Thanks to Jennifer for sharing :)

Great cookie and it stays very moist! It is very similar to the Baker's Breakfast Cookie.  I omitted the apricots and added 1/2 cup chocolate chips and they were great.  I will make them again this week but use whole wheat flour and some cocoa powder.

I doubled the apricots, applesauce (in place of the prunes) and vanilla, added 2/3 cup cranberries and tripled the nuts (i like nuts) and dropped the water. I also added 1/2 tsp. nutmeg (nuts...) and 2 T soft butter. a 1/4 cup scoop-size takes 12 min, bigger ones took 14. i liked the taste, but very cake-like. next time i will add more oats, and even more of the dried fruits and nuts (ah, nuts...). very repeatable. oh - don't worry about the stuff being too dry to mix right. keep at it and suddenly it's all mixed and ready.

Delicious!  I'd rename them the BESTEST Breakfast Cookie!  Made similar adjustments that previous reviewers suggested to make the chocolate chocolate chip version (omit fruit and add 3/4 cup cocoa and bag of dark chocolate chips).  These turned out fabulous!  This one's a keeper for sure!

Very cakey.  They were tasty, but not what I was looking for.  Also, I had to add more oil since the batter wasn't coming together at all.  I used whole wheat flour, so maybe that had something to do with it.

Added a little apple sauce with the prune puree and chocolate chips.  Baked for about 12 minutes and they are still chewy.  I would also like to try pumpkin or honey flavors which I think would  complement the other flavors in this cookie.

Very good and a nice change of pace for kids' breakfast. As most do, I made a few alterations. I used about 3/4 applesauce in place of the prune puree. I ground the oats a little. Also omitted the dried apricots and walnuts. -->not for my kids :(  Instead I used a full cup of raisins and a few milk chocolate chips for a hint of chocolate. (less than a 1/4 cup). I cut back on the sugar some since I was adding the chips.  I also had to add a few drops of water to add a little moisture to stir the batter. Next time, I may add two of the egg yolks for a little added moisture, softness and protein. Also may add little apple chunks or pineapple chunks for variety. And could add some powdered milk for calcium or add flaxseed.  The variations are endless! Anyway, very good recipe and the kids love them.  They even asked for a few in their lunch!  And still less sugar than most commercial cereals.

I used honey vs. sugar and added some dried blueberries and cranberries. I can't use walnuts or pecan due to allergies so I added some unsalted sunflower seeds.  I send these out with my husband on the road (he's a truck driver). He loves them. It's amazing how some homemade foods portioned out and a vac. sealer can bring a bit of home out on the road!

Love it.  The recipe is great to experiment with.  I usually cut the sugar in half, use applesauce instead of prune juice; I like coconut and chocolate chips added, cranberries, apricots - basically whatever I have in the cabinets!

Flavor is out of this world - hard to eat just one for breakfast.
I used 3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour but then needed to add quite a bit of water to keep moist.  Might cut the brown sugar by a 1/3rd as they are pretty sweet .
Num num! :)

I used applesauce instead of the prunes, and added extra applesauce and reduced the oil. I added a little extra baking soda to compensate for the extra acidity of the applesauce.

these cookies were very good for a lowfat treat. although i made a few adjustments 1) use all applesauce, no need for fattening oil 2) upped the cinnamon and vanilla by 1 tsp for added flavor 3) use 1 1/2 - 2 cups of oats for real oatmeal cookie texture 4) decrease the sugar by 1/2 cup if using sweetened applesauce. otherwise they were delicious

Zing! Had one for breakfast this morning and it woke me right up. Lots of energy in this tasty morsel. 

Taste is very good, but for me the texture is a bit off. My batter was too dry so I added a few extra tablespoons of water and now they are a bit too wet. Also, the cooking time was a bit off (at least on my oven. I left them in for about 10-11 minutes, and they were a tad undercooked for my taste (I like my cookies chewy!). Still, very good--I would make a again.

These are soooo good! Very moist texture, and great cinnamon flavor. A tip for storage: layer the cookies with wax paper so that the cookies do not stick.

Wonderful recipe!  From a family of Bellinghamsters (Baker's Breakfast Cookies hometown!), we love them.  Just like the real thing.  I didn't find them all that time consuming, and pureeing your own prunes is well worth the small amount of time.  Thank you for sharing!!!!

Followed the recipe then deleted the apricots and added chocolate chips. These are great for grab and go in the morning. I make a batch and put them in the freezer. When I want one just pull out of the freezer and microwave till warm, about 30 seconds.

I haven't reviewed any recipe on here,ever, but this recipe I just had to.. I was skeptical at first thinking, a cookie without butter? but this is probably the best oatmeal cookie I have ever made. I had to change the recipe to suit what I had, but I can imagine on its own it would be great too.
What I did not expect is how hard it is to mix the ingredients. I ended up turning it out of the bowl and kneading with my hands. A spoon is not going to be able to do it. I doubt any mixer short of something industrial would either! My arms are worn out! However they are soooo good. I have eaten two already. For those curious, I soaked the prunes in hot water for an hour,and drained the juice before blending. I used the leftover 'juice' for the water, then added 2 tbsp of the 'juice' into the mix as it needed it. I used 3 whole eggs instead of 5 whites, ( I had no use for the yolks and didn't want to waste) dried mixed berries (cranberry, blueberry and cherries) for the raisins and apricots, and used mixed deluxe nuts (almonds,cashews, macadamia and brazil) for the walnuts. I also added an 1/8 of a small bag of dark chocolate chips. I also gave up on the rolling the dough into balls, as it took quite awhile to wash my hands from mixing, I just used 2 regular tablespoons, one to scoop the other to push it onto the pan. Well worth the effort! Excellent recipe..thanks!

These are a tasty, simple to make treat.  Very easy to adjust to whatever you have on hand. I have used 1/2 to 1 cup puree - using dried figs, apples, pears or prunes, dried cherries, apricots or blueberries.  I cut down on the sugar a bit and freeze and bake as needed.

I really liked how these turned out. The only thing I did different was substitute applesauce for the canola oil. Next time I will add chocolate chips!

This is great! Just what I was looking for.  The first time I made these I used a bag of Trader Joe's dried cherries and berries in place of the raisins and apricots. Yum!  I made these another time using pureed bananas (4 average sized) for the prune puree and skipped the water and used about 2 Tbs of oil. And added a bag of mini chocolate chips.  They are to die for!!  Thanks for a great recipe! Both times I used 3 C whole wheat flour and 1 C white. I made other subtle changes to suit my tastes, which I'm not going to bore everyone with.  I think it's rather arrogant to completely re-write a recipe.

I just can't seem to mess these cookies up.  Once I used prune juice instead of the puree and today I used a can of fruit cocktail that I pureed in the blender. I always use whole grain flour. They are amazing!!!

These are great! when I was first mixing up the batter, they were very dense and dry looking, I did add a bit more liquid(I used Fat Free half and half instead of the water) I also used baby food prune puree, I added a dried fruit berry mix and some mini chocolate chips. before putting them in the oven, I  sprinkled a bit of raw sugar over the top. they are a filling, portable meal in themselves. A healthier alternative for a sweet tooth! can't wait to try other variations. Thank you!

Pretty darn good way to start the day! I am not fond of dried apricots baked into things, so the fruity version of these was not MY absolute favorite, but the family devoured them. I made half the batch with mini chocolate chips, omitting the dried fruit, and those were awesome. Great traveling breakfast! (and not a bad hiking snack either!)

Delicious!  Just like the kind you buy in the store.  Not overly sweet either.  I think I'll substitute chocolate chips next time to make them more kid-friendly. I was able to make about 24 cookies.  Definitely a keeper recipe!

These are great - Wish I had apricots for this batch!  Next time I think I will add some oat or wheat bran and also flax meal.  I keep mine in the freezer and put them in the microwave for about 20 seconds and they taste like a fresh cookie right out of the oven! Very similar to Baker's!

I loved these cookies!  I used whatever combination of nuts and dried fruit that I had available.  apricots, cranberries, raisins and I even added some unsalted sunflower seeds.  I substituted the prune puree with applesauce and it turned out great!  A great grab and go breakfast that is hearty!

I love it!  Just like the Bakers that I buy at the Latte stand.  I substituted 12 cup applesauce for the oil. Definately worth making the prune puree, and I used craisins instead of raisins.  One more thing, I threw in some cinnamon chips.  Yummy!  even my 11yr old daughter loves them.. and she is a picky eater.

Quite good! I made these last night and had to modify the recipe some to use the ingredients I had on hand. I ran out of flour and had to use about 1 2/3 cups of cocoa for the missing flour, I used 1 cup of applesauce and omitted the oil, prunes, & water, used dried apples rather than apricots, and used 2 whole eggs and an egg white rather than 5 egg whites. The resulting cookies were very chocolatey and very decadent-tasting for being practically fat free.

Awesome recipe! I followed most of RIVKA’s suggestions in her review - soaked the fruit, mixed all wet ingredients in a blender, including apricots, but added raisins & walnuts separately. I also substituted with 1.5 cups of whole wheat flour mixed with 2.5 cups all purpose. These are a great snack. Just like a breakfast bar but less sweet & not from a package full of preservatives.

Love, love, love them. They satiate me for a breakfast on the go, mid-day snack or after a good workout. My kids love them (when I add a few chocolate chips or M&Ms), but without any chocolate in them, they're great for a summer, no melt in the hot car, treat. I usually use whatever dried fruit I have on hand and add nuts when I know I won't be in any, or with any, nut allergy folks. The true recipe is the best, but I don't always have prunes so I have to substitute 3 super ripe bananas and it seems to work just as well.

These cookies turned out quite well. I did make adjustments based on what was in the house. 2 mashed bananas for the prune puree, no nuts or dried apricots, and 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. I made these for my college aged brother who had been eating cookies for breakfast the last few days. Hopefully these cookies make a good alternative!

I used pumpkin purée instead of prune purée and whole wheat flour instead of white and these came out good!

Great Great!! Wow one big cookie! Thank you LEIE! :)I made 1/2 of recipe,  I used the ice cream scoop to put them on the cookie sheet, Pressed down to 1/2" following recipe with wet fingers, tweaked the recipe it a bit,  I ground up 1 C of the oats in my coffee grinder, ground up 1/4 C of coconut, used 1T & 1t of water, 1/2 C applesauce instead of prune puree, 1t of cinnamon and 1/2 C raisins, my cookies were really big from using the scoop so I baked 10 min and they came out great. These are not too sweet, perfect for AM, you could add a tad more sugar or some honey if you wanted too, if adding all of the fruits you probably don't need extra sweetness. Next time I'm going to decrease the flour & add some Bran and Molasses, they  will taste like bran muffins. I just like a little something in the AM,I don't like to eat in the AM but know I need to eat something, these work for me! I would buy the Quakers bars and they just don't taste that good to me, tried some others and blah plus the $ these store brand bars cost! Yep, I can see substituting a banana for the puree or using some allspice for a different flavor. Finally a good recipe! Thanks

Tastes great! I didn't have any apricots - so I skipped them & it was still yummy. I swapped 1 cup of whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour so as to add fiber. All 4 kids & my hubby love these!

i should have read the comments first. the batter was dry and difficult to work with. cookies came out fine but with a bit of baking soda taste. i didn't see any other comments on that, so maybe i messed up. or maybe adding extra liquid as others said would have helped it all get dissolved and mixed better? hrm, just realized i forgot the vanilla. maybe that would have masked it.

my suggestions: add a little extra liquid and don't forget the vanilla! i'll give the recipe the benefit of the doubt with 4 stars.

These are really good!  I was skeptical, but I was very pleased.  I baked at about 340 for 8 minutes because I didn't want them overdone.  I watched them carefully and they came out great!  Mine are really moist and even fall apart. I like all my cookies underbaked a bit. It makes a ton.  I put most in the freezer and just pull them out as I need them so they don't get stale sitting on my counter.  Haven't had one from the freezer yet, but cookies usually freeze pretty well so I'm sure they'll be just as good.  To those making their own prune puree, definitely use baby food prunes or Lighter Bake, which is an oil substitute you can find at the store in the baking aisle.  I think it's kind of hard to find these days, but if you can find it, that would work, too.  I will be making these again for sure.  I use these for my pre-work out "snack" in the mornings.

Pretty good.  I used applesauce and pecans instead of prune juice and walnuts.  The perfect baking time in my oven was 10 minutes, and these really do not spread at all, so I could still get 6 cookies to  a cookie sheet.  That was nice to cut down on the time I was in the kitchen baking them.  Very hearty cookis, and soft, so I can see how they would be fun for breakfast.  thanks for the recipe!

Good cookies, a lot like muffin tops.  Mine turned out a little too moist and stuck together in the container I kept them in.  Love that I can add my own things like cranberries and pecans.

EXCELLENT recipe!  I made a couple of minor changes.  The dough was really dry so I added a little bit more water.  I also added a couple of Tbsp of peanut butter for more protein, then exchanged 1 cup whole wheat flour for white flour (can't even tell!).  My 3 year old just ate two, and he doesn't normally eat raisins!  I have been so bored with breakfast choices lately - this is GREAT!

Very Yummy.  I used 1/2 whole wheat flour 1/2 all purpose.  Like others, I did not have the pureed prunes.  I substitued pureed peaches (baby food) with great success.  Next time I'll add more nuts! So many people asked me for this recipe.

I added 2/3 cup of cocoa powder, 1/2 cup of extra applesauce and two egg yolks.  The cookies turn out more cake like and plump. Makes a great breakfast.

These are delicious, and healthy, cookies!  My sister and I make three batches at a time and store them for breakfast in the fridge.  We also make variations to make them healthier by adding different dried fruit, nuts, and wheat germ or healthy flour.  Everyone loves them!

I was surprise at the rave reviews this cookie got.  These were just OK to me.  I prefer a greater oatmeal to flour ratio.  I'm still searching for the best breakfast cookie.

really yummy. I used apple sauce instead of prune puree and 1 cup of splenda brown sugar blend. I used raisins and craisins and left out the nuts. I used half whole wheat pastry flour and added ground flaxseed. great recipe - and fun to have for playing around with.

These were soooo tasty! I have made them twice so far. I follow the recipe exactly, except that I substitute the oil for apple sauce to make them even frutier and healthier. It works (and tastes!) great.

I thought this was a good breakfast cookie.  Very healthy.  I used dried cranberries and white chocolate chips.  My older son wasn't a fun but my 1 year old couldn't get it in fast enough.  Was a very portable breakfast and much healthier than the breakfast cookies you get in a box.

Yummy!  I used oat bran flour for the regular flour because I'm trying to lower my cholesteral.  I also used chocolate covered raisins in place of the regular raisins and the apricots. I used baby food prunes as well pumpkin puree in place of the oil.  They came out really good!  Will be making them in big batches this weekend!

These were definitely soft, no doubt.  Even my picky boyfriend liked these.  I did omit the cinnamon and added chocolate chips instead which made it even better.  I think I'll hang on to this recipe.
