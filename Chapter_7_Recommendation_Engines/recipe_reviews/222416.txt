Pity the poor Margarita. The original concoction was a relative of the Sidecar: brandy, Cointreau & lemon juice served in sugar rimmed glass. The Margarita substituted tequila, with lime and salt being the traditional accompaniments. Then the mongrelization began.  When I came upon the Margarita in the 70’s, it had been reduced to cheap tequila, bar mix and a pound of ice to be processed in a blender:  an adult Slurpee. Follow the above recipe as if your life depended on it.  Use a quality tequila, Cointreau and fresh squeezed lime juice. Triple Sec has always been used by bars as a cheap substitute for Cointreau, but they don’t taste the same. As far as turnbot’s use of an eggwhite, you are on your own. A Margarita is a cocktail, not the breakfast of champions.

This recipe is not bad: my "perfect margarita" calls for only half an ounce of triple sec (as opposed to 1 once; that much will override the great tequila flavour). Speaking of tequila: your margarita will be as good as the tequila you buy! Avoid the "well-brand" tequilas: for an affordable yet tasty tequila, get Cazadores or El Jimedor reposado. I'm not a fan of "straight up" style margaritas, so I'll always have mine with lots of rocks (ice), or blended. If  you want a really frothy, truly PERFECT margarita... Before shaking, throw in half an egg white into your shaker! You'll never go back - trust me!

Fun and different margarita martini. The tequila is the main flavor, but that's how it should be!
