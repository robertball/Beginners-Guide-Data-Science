I personally loved this recipe.  My children ate it also but were suspicious that they were eating something healthy. If I make it regularly they won't have problems with it. I used about 9 small tender squash and peeled it, but did not seed it.  It made enough soup for my family of 5 (including 2 teens) plus enough for me to eat for lunch the next day.

We used one cup of cheddar cheese and a splash of cream, instead of the processed cheese. Mmm mmm mmm.

The first two time I made this, I used shredded sharp cheddar and my family and I LOVED it.  Then I made it once using the processed cheese that the recipe calls for.  My husband still liked it, but I didn't like it at all.  I'm really glad I tried it with regular cheese first, because I would not have made it a second time.  I still gave this recipe 5 stars because it is SO good using regular cheese...my husband said he could eat it that way every day.  Too bad the regular cheese makes it so fattening.  It does need added salt and a good bit of pepper when not using the processed cheese, but it's well worth it.

I just made this with my fresh squash from my garden and OH MY.. it was SOO good.. I did't have bellpepper, so I left that out.. and used a little less velveeta cheese, but it is so savory and good.. with just a pinch of pepper and salt.... MMMMM.. great as a cheese type sauce too!
I made this again for a second time and I added a can of corn instead of the bellpepper.. and it was a great addition!

First let me say, "WOW"!  I certainly had an overabundance of summer squash this year and after putting all my tried and true recipes to the test I was still left with a lot of summer squash, so......looking at the 5 squash still sitting on my counter, I decided to try something different and I just happened to have and onion, a pepper and some cheddar cheese, so I figured, why not?  This is sensational.  In fact, I would run out and buy summer squash in the winter to make this recipe.  My husband loved it!  Thanks so much for a great addition to my squash recipe collection. I can't wait to try it out on guests.

This recipe turned out Great! I never imagined that a yellow squash soup could be so tasty!  I used summer squash we received from a neighbor and left in the seeds without any problems (they all pureed with everything else!). I also used some Monterrey Jack cheese to bring out the bell pepper. This recipe is amazing and a perfect way to use up a profusion of summer gourds!

YUMMY!  I just cut the squash up.  I left the skin on and the seeds in but it still tastes yummy!  I followed the rest of the recipe and would not change a thing.

This is a wonderful recipe and a perfect way to use abundant squash from the garden. I used cheddar cheese and added 1 lb browned hamburger and fresh chives. It was excellent!

This was much more yummy than I thought it would be. I used zucchini and added ham. Also does great in the crock pot, just add less water and cook on low for 6-8  hours.

This was wonderful, even in the hot July heat of the South.  I did pay attention to the suggestions about the cheese. I did part Velveta and part extra sharp cheddar.  I also used chicken broth instead of water as I do in most recipes that require water.  I used a hand blender to puree the mixture, but left part of the mixture with some whole bits of squash.  Who knew squash soup could taste so great.  This is a keeper for me and I will freeze some for the winter.

This was de-lish! I had three quarts of yellow butterneck squash that didn't seal so I used that and tripled the recipe to can. I sauteed the onion, green and red pepper for color and garlic in some butter, then drained two of the quarts and used liquid from the third. I did not drain that off. To puree I used an immersion blender and didn't completely puree either to retain texture. I also steamed some cauliflowerettes and added that at the end for more texture but probably won't next time, just cleaning out the garden! Will definately make this again!

This was a good recipe!  Like others mentioned, I did not seed the squash as they pureed fine.  I also added garlic, crumbled bacon, and chicken broth instead of some of the water.  It was a bit cheesy for my husband, but I don't think I added as much squash as it calls for.  All in all, it was great and I will be keeping this recipe on hand

I have made versions of this recipe before, so I had some fun with it.  I used what I had, adding a little fresh corn, chicken stock instead of water, 1 Jalapeno and a small pepper from my garden, mixed in some tomatoes, fresh herbs garlic and soup spices from the pantry.  Very good and would pair well with a grilled cheese sandwich.  I used lots of different cheeses, including Parmesan.  It's so easy to do this soup to your own taste.  Pumpkin soup is popular in Australia and that is where I first tried squash in soup.  My friend adds some cream to the top a little extra cheese and a side of crusty bread. Oh and one thing she also did was use potatoes as well and just boiled it all together till the right consistency. VERY GOOD!  I chose to leave out the extra carbs, but great both ways! YUM!

I've heard that when you boil vegetables and then drain the water, you lose a lot of the nutritional value of the vegetables, so I boiled the squash, onion, pepper, and a carrot in maybe 1 cup water and let a lot of it boil off.  Then I blended what water remained with the vegetables.  Added fresh corn from the cob with the cheese- loved the crunch and flavor.  This will be a go-to when there is too much squash at the end of the summer.

The family wasn't sure about this recipe but in the end they really liked it. This soup tasted very similar to the broccoli cheese soup that I make and that the family all loves. I made the recipe exactly as written and will definitely be making again. Thanks for a great recipe!

Just say make with VELVETA! I'm a guy and I couldn't figure out what 'processed cheese' was so I used regular cheese. Turned out ok.

Easy to cook, with the inconvenience of having to lug out the mixer, but an excellent base soup.  I added Penzy's Sandwich Sprinkle seasonings to it in lieu of just salt / pepper.  Excellent.  Will make again and will add carrots next time.

This is a good base recipe. It is very forgiving too. I sauted my veggies in butter first. I threw in fresh corn, garlic and half of a seeded jalapeno pepper. Once sauted a bit....I used chicken broth instead of water. I threw in a few fresh roma tomatoes and some leftover fresh basil leaves into the blender. Sooooo good!!!! Add some parmesan cheese yet too. Used cheddar cheese. It is pretty thick, but simple to water down if needed. AMAZING! AND SO SIMPLE! Try it!

This soup is SO YUMMY!!!!  I have a squash plant that went crazy this summer.  I used 45 little yellow squashes between 3-5 inches long, left in seeds since they are so small and doubled the recipe.  I plan on making more and freezing it to use this winter.  I really like it!!  Thanks!!!

I cooked up the vegetables as written, blended them and then used regular cheese as opposed to the processed cheese as others suggested. I tasted it after adding salt and pepper and felt like it was just mush. I added some garlic powder, paprika, 3/4 cup milk, 1 cup chicken broth and a scallop of Dijon I had lying around. It's much better and will be great on a fall day with some crusty bread.

I made this with a lot of my CSA veggies in addition to the ones above. I also used my vitamix which made a beautiful starting puree. I barely had to add any cheese, and personally wanted to add some half and half. It was delicious and rich.

This was a terrific base to start with!  I'm rating this recipe on its potential rather than the way it turned out for me cuz I think I messed up and used too much squash--the flavor was very bland.  We have canned cheddar cheese powder, like in those pre-packaged mac and cheese dinners.  Even with the Velveeta per the recipe, I ended up stirring in about 3/4 c. of the powdered cheese, along with the same amount of milk and about 1/2 c. butter.  I didn't use the bell pepper, but added extra onion. I used an immersion blender to puree it (easier clean-up).  After all the additions and heating it through, I added a little tarragon, basil, and coarsely ground black pepper.  For serving, we sprinkled a little buttered bread crumbs on top.  We all loved it and we will be making it again, and again (we've LOTS of frozen squash and this is a great way to use it).  It made enough to feed the five of us (two teens and a 6 year old that eats like a teen!) with at least enough left over to feed three of us for lunch tomorrow. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I really liked this soup....even my husband enjoyed it...and he doesn't like yellow squash.  The recipe is great as written...and guessing easy on the pantry for substutions. Happy to have another way to use squash AND a quick & easy meal.

I just made this and can't believe how good it is! Perfect way to use the overabundance of yellow squash. I didn't have any bell peppers ripe in my garden, so I used some dehydrated cherry bomb (slightly less spicy than jalapenos) instead and it was AWESOME! I'm freezing it, and when we eat it, we'll add chicken or beef, and some other veggies like peas or tomatoes.

This was a very good soup recipe, it was very cheesy and the texture was wonderful.  I did however take out the green pepper.  For the cheese, I just used a 16 oz package of velveeta. It was very quick and easy to make!
I will be making this recipe again and again!

I used the cheddar cheese version and for added flavor and healthfulness a pound of spinach. Yummy!

Added celery and heavy whipping cream to thicken it up and give a creamier texture. It turned out wonderful and gave the soup a richer taste. 
Also, instead of just boiling the squash, I sautéd it til it was soft then added the wet ingredients and puréed that. 
So good!!

Easy and delicious! I used 6 cups squash/pumpkin and substituted cheddar cheese for processed cheese.

I am going to start out by saying that I LOVE this soup. I made a few changes, I know, sorry about that but I used what I had. I had an abundance of squash, the reason for looking at new recipes. I sautéed the onion and pepper in a little butter. Pealed and cut up three HUGE yellow squash, added to the onion mixture. Poured in one can of chicken broth and enough water to just cover. Boiled about a half hour. Removed from heat and used my immersion blender to blend the soup. Still leaving some small pieces of squash. Added 1/2 cup cheddar cheese, salt & pepper to taste. Garnished with more cheese and a dollop of sour cream. Yummy! I can’t wait to make this in the winter months with my left over summer squash that I am freezing. Thanks for the recipe!

This is the perfect way to disguise yellow squash. I just tastes like a creamy cheese soup

Easy summer favorite.  I 'spiced' it up with a small banana pepper and used chicken stock to cook the squash.  Yum!!

Nice, simple to make, tasty soup.  I have a bumper crop of squash from the garden this year, so this recipe is a welcome addition to our menu.  I did experiment with it a little and added some chicken stock and cream, used red pepper instead of green pepper, and added some carrots for some additional color and flavor.  Since I have way more spaghetti squash then I do yellow squash, I used half and half of each.  I also used sharp cheddar instead of Velveeta, and I used 3 cups of cheese instead of 2.  Turned out great with a nice cheesy flavor and creamy texture.  Great for dipping some fresh warm bread into.

Really good.  I used an immersion blender and Monterey Jack cheese instead of processed cheese.  Also I added 1 Cup of chicken broth at the end to loosen it up a bit.

I made this I did what a couple of other people suggested, I put a little of chicken broth in when I boiled the vegetables and added some fresh corn.  I also used yellow and zuchinni squash.   The seeds blended fine for me and so did the corn.  I used monterrey jack instead of velveta and I'm glad I did, I didn't have bell pepper, but the spicy in the cheese was really good, I will make again!

This is the only way my kids and husband will eat squash. I omit the green bell pepper and add whole wheat alphabet noodles, and it's always a hit.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I steamed all the veges instead of boiling.  I threw in some carrots and a few green beans as well.  I used half processed cheese and half extra sharp cheddar.  I think it would be good with bacon crumbles on top.  I shared the recipe with a friend of mine and her family and friends loved it.

We used 2 cups low-fat shredded cheese and 4 oz Oikos yogurt to make it a little healthier and it tasted great!

This is very good without the cheese also. I added a little thyme to give that slow cooked flavor. I think instead of water next time I will try chicken stock - so many things to do with this recipe. I am going to bottle some of this for the winter.
