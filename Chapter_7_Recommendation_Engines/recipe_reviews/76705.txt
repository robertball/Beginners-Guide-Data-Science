I have made this recipe four times and I think I have finally perfected it  I brown the ribs really well first and then saute the onions in the drippings for a bit.  I add everything to the crock pot with two additional ingredients--minced garlic and parmesan cheese.  I also cut down on the sugar and add a bit more crushed red perpper.  It takes 3-4 hours on low in the crock pot.  My husband likes it served with mashed potatoes but I prefer rigatoni--tonight I will serve it with both!

I am a Culinary School graduate and have been in fine dining for a long time. And I have to tell you that this is one of the best Short Rib recipes I have ever made or tasted.  It is simple and delicious! It is even better the next day. The the only thing I do different is add Shiitake mushrooms to the mix.  And I serve the ribs over garlic mash.

We like short ribs and I prepare them several times each winter so I am always looking for new. This is an excellent recipe. I have found the best way to reduce the fat content is to oven-brown the short ribs prior to adding to the sauce. Place bone side down in a pan, sesaon with pepper & salt roast for 45 minutes at 450. Drain off fat. If ribs are large return to oven for 15 minutes more.  I was reluctant to try this the first time but it's the only way I pre-pare them now. I got over 1/2 cup of fat from the 2 1/2 lbs ribs I used for this recipe. I browned the onions in a dutch oven, added a a couple minced garlic cloves, and about 1/2 broth to the sauce ingredients and then the browned ribs. Baked covered at 325 for 2 1/2 hours. Served with parmesan mashed potatoes. They were moist and succulent. Received rave reviews with request for promise to repeat.

This is a great meal!. The only thing I did different was to roast the ribs at 350 for an hour while I made the sauce and let it cook on the stove top. Then I poured off the grease in the roasting pan, poured on the sauce and let it bake in the oven at 325 for 2 more hours and it was wonderful. Will use the left over sauce tonight on meatloaf.

This recipe was sooo tasty and tender, and easy.  I threw in about a cup of dry red wine and 1 chopped celery rib(from another recipe).  I would definitely make this again.  I used 'no salt' tomato sauce and 1 tsp salt to lower the sodium content some.  I also chilled it overnight to skim off the large amount of fat it produces.

I followed the advice of others who have reviewed this recipe and browned the short ribs fist.  I also added 1/2 cup of red wine to deglaze the pan before adding the sauce ingr.  Try this one.  You won't be disappointed.

I made these last night in my slow cooker for my family and they absolutely loved them. I added 3 cloves of garlic as I put it in everything.  Thanks for the great recipe, I will definitely make this again and again.

This was awesome, awesome, awesome!  The only changes I made were using crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and I left out the brown sugar.  Oh, did I mention this was AWESOME?  This is definitely a keeper!  Thank you!

Just so-so.  I had to do too much doctoring to this recipe to get a flavorful sauce. Certainly not a memorable dish.

Great recipe! Used 28oz of crushed tomatoes, omitted lemon juice and parsley b/c didn't have any, added extra 1/2tsp red pepper flakes. Seared ribs first, removed from pan and sauteed onions and 2 cloves minced garlic.  Deglazed pan with 1/4 cup red wine, and added everything to crockpot.  Cooked for 4.5 hours on high.  Deliciously tender!  The gravy tastes amazing, we served it with mashed potatoes.  This recipe is still getting raving reviews from kids & adults!  Thank you!

My husband and I made these and they were wonderful!!!!  We followed many of the suggestions.  We seasoned the ribs with salt, and pepper and then lightly floured prior to browing them in a dutch oven.  After they were browned we removed them from the dutch oven and added diced onion, carrot, celery, about 6 - 8 cloves of garlic minced and green peppers.  We used Red Wine in place of the lemon juice.  I also didn't have tomato sauce but did have ground tomatos which worked great.  After the Vegtables were all tender is when I added the rest of the ingredients.  Once the sauce was done I put the ribs back in the Dutch Oven and placed it in a 300 degree oven for 45 minutes, then decreased the temp to 250 and cooked for another 2 hours and 30 minutes.  They were so tender and the sauce was just amazing!   The next night we browned some thin pork chops and used the remaining sauce and simmered them on the stove top for about 45 minutes they too came out wonderful.  This recipe is a definate keeper!!

Great recipe.  Lives up to it's name.  I left out lemon juice & crushed red pepper flakes b/c I didn't have them.  Subbed Italian seasoning for dried parsley & thyme b/c I don't like dried thyme.  I also followed another reviewer's suggestion of browning the meat first, then caramelize the onion in juices before adding sauce ingredients.  Cooked in my crock pot on low for 8 hours.  Served with garlic smashed potatoes & steamed sugar snap peas.

Delicious and easy. I followed someone elses suggestion to roast first at 450 for 30 min. Definitely helped with the grease. Also browned the onions in some of the fat, along with 3 cloves of garlic. Then, deglazed the pan with about 1 cup of red wine before adding the sauce. Cooked at 325 for 2.5 hours. Sooo incredibly good.

This was the first time I made short ribs and they came out very flavorful and tangy. I browned the meat and onions as suggested.  My changes were using a can of sauce and a can of stewed tomatoes, a big splash of merlot, lots of garlic and onions and some fresh basil and savory I had growing. I also used blue agave sweetener instead of the sugar and went a little heavy on the red peppers. I added mushrooms and summer squash at the end and it was really delicious. I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is awesome. I will definitely make this again. I read a lot of the reviews and did change it up some. I seasoned the meat with salt, pepper and Mrs. Dash and seared the meat in olive oil. I took the meat out and added onions and cooked until softened then I added fresh garlic and cooked for a minute or two. Then I added about a half cup of beef broth and deglazed the pan. Then  I added the sauce, sugar and spices and let cook for about 5 minutes. I then added the meat to a baking dish then covered it with the sauce and baked on 325 for 2 hours. The meat was so tender and the sauce was amazing. I served with garlic mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli and garlic cheddar biscuits. This was an awesome meal. Thanks for the recipe.

Received rave reviews tonight for this recipe.  I did as someone else suggested and first roasted for 45 minutes at 450.  Poured off excess fat and sauteed onions, some finely chopped carrot, garlic and shitake mushrooms.  I used Pomi strained tomatoes which seemed a little thick so I added beef broth and baked at 325 for 2 1/2 hours. Had to add another 1/2 cup of broth during the last hour.   I used all of the ingredients listed in the recipe. Very tender and tasty and I served over Parmesan mashed potatoes.

this was a delicious recipe - i took the advice of ALL the previous cooks, basically i used garlic-paremsian tomato sauce, was not sparing of the brown sugar to avoid acidity, and baked the ribs at 450 for 30 minutes before adding to the sauce mixture to get rid of some fat (my cut of ribs was still fatty, which was disappointing) - but i also added baby bella mushrooms to the sauce, along with the onions that i sauteed in the fat from the short ribs after i baked them. DELICIOUS!

I made these according to the directions and they were really delicious.  We had unexpected company at dinner time, luckily it made a big batch and everyone loved them.  I usually make short ribs with wine, but I liked these much better.

Terrific, easy meal.  I browned the meat quickly over high heat, then removed the ribs from the pan, and added all other ingredients to the same pan to make the sauce.  I put the ribs back in, cooked on low for 2 1/2 hours, and served it over rice.  Delicious!

I just made these for the 4th time. Wonderful is right! Everyone that tries them ends up taking the recipe home. I did change a few things. I brown the ribs first, set aside and make the sauce. I use fire roasted tomatoes and 1/2 a cup of beef broth ( red wine works well too). I then stick it all in the oven (covered) rather than on the stove for 2.5-3 hours at 325. Fall apart tender and delicious!

This was a fantastic recipe. I did change a couple of things however. I browned the ribs first. I also added 3 cloves of garlic and half a cup of dry red wine. I will absolutely make this again.

This is a great recipe. I browned the ribs first tho and added a cup of pinot noir because there wasn't enough liquid. I served it over chiocoli egg noodles and it was superb.

Great recipe!  I'll be making it again and again.  It makes a truly amazing sauce as it cooks.  I've used it for rice and pasta, next will use with mashed potatoes.  I'm thinking this would be a good recipe for a slow cooker.

These ribs were pretty good in the crock.  They were tasty, something difficult to pull off with short ribs in my experience.  I followed the recipe to the letter except instead of tomato sauce I used organic parmesan pasta sauce and half the salt called for.  I'm too inept in the kitchen and too adverse to cleaning up extra pans and utensils to brown meat in advance of crocking.  I just tossed the ribs in the slow cooker frozen and poured the mixture on top.  I was going to add garlic like another reviewer suggested but forgot.  I didn't miss the garlic though so unless you're the type who prefers food with your garlic you can make this without it and be ok.  I gave this only four stars because although I liked it I would never reminisce or wake up in the middle of the night with a craving for these.  But it was tasty and easy to make. I would make them again.

These were so good! I admit I was a little leery at first because I am a Southern girl and like my ribs with bbq sauce but this was a nice change. I browned my ribs, deglazed with a little red wine, sauteed the onions, and then finished preparing the sauce in the same skillet. The only other thing I added was some garlic. I put my ribs in a crock pot and then covered them in this sauce. I cooked them for 3 hours. I also made some rigatoni and added the extra sauce from the ribs to them. It was the perfect side to these ribs. I also did some roasted potatoes that I quartered and sprinkled with the same dry seasonings that were used in the sauce. Very good!

This was the best short ribs recipe ever.  The sauce was scrumptious.  I let the meat cook about 20 minutes longer than the recipe and the meat fell off the bone.  My fiance loved it!

This recipe is delicious! My family has never had short ribs before and they loved the sauce. I took the advice of one reviewer and added garlic and just a little parmesan cheese. I also cooked the ribs in a crock pot. Thank you for sharing, we will definitely be making this again!

Fixed exactly as written, the only way to fairly review a recipe. Found the sauce to be kind of bland and boring.  Not a bad recipe but not anything special.

This recipe was definitely a keeper! I followed advice of some and dredged the meat in flour and browned it first, also added 1 cup of dry red wine. DELISH!!! Thanks for posting this recipe.

FABULOUS!!!  These by far are the best short ribs I have ever tasted.  I too browned the ribs and deglazed the pan with beef broth (didn't have any wine).  Used fire roasted diced tomatoes with garlic and finished in the oven on 300 degress for two hours in the same dutch oven I browned them in.  Be sure to check that the sauce doesn't evaporate.  Adding some beef broth will help.  My family didn't leave one drop.  A nice loaf of french bread will help "mop" up the sauce on your plate.  Served with buttered potatos.  Delicious.

I always try to follow the recipe as is for the rating but I was lacking a few items.  But my ribs turned out wonderful! I followed the recipe with these changes - 12 oz tomato sauce, 6 oz beer, didnt have thyme and left out the onion.  Cant wait to make these again!

These were outstanding!  I doubled the recipe as we had company for dinner and everybody absolutely raved about these short ribs.  Thanks for this easy and delicious recipe - will most definitely make again.  For reference - made as instructed.

Served this over noodles, made a freezer meal with additional ingredients by combining all raw ingredients together in one freezer bag with instructions to thaw and place in crock pot on high for 4 hours. Thanks! Edit: This is really good. I've made it with a pork roast instead of ribs and it turned out really well. This is a great freezer meal.

This is a keeper.  I browned the ribs and sauted the garlic and onions, then put everything in the crock pot on low of 8 hours.  The meat was falling  off the bones.  Delish!

I followed the ingredients, substituting boneless short ribs for bone-in, white vinegar for lemon juice, 1/3 tsp ground thyme for dried thyme, 1/2 tsp ground red pepper for flakes, and garlic powder for minced garlic.  I also added 15 oz can diced tomatoes.  I baked ribs at 475 degrees for 30 minutes as someone suggested, and then put in crockpot for 5 hours.  YUMMY! with garlic mashed potatoes.  A KEEPER!

Well, this went over like gangbusters!  I also browned the ribs, sweat the onions, and deglazed with a zinfindel.  We're making "Italian" enchiladas with the leftovers!  YUM!

This was very tasty! I browned the meat first and then sauteed the onion in the drippings as per another reviewer.  I then added the rest of ingredients as the recipe stated.  It definitely went well with rotini and some veggies steamed with garlic and onion spices.  (I used a 1 1/2 pound package of meat, so I adjusted the recipe as follows: 16 oz tomato sauce, 2 T lemon juice, 3 t Worcestershire, 1 T parsley, 3/4 t thyme, 2 bay leaves, 1 1/2 T brown sugar, 3/4 t salt, and a couple shakes of red pepper flakes)

We just loved this! We don't eat a lot of red meat and we definitely don't do ribs often, but this may be added to our list of regular meals. The sauce was so good! I used a red onion and 1 clove garlic which I sauteed with red pepper flakes. I seared my ribs and deglazed the pan with 1 cup red wine. Instead of a 28 oz can tomato sauce, I used 1 15-oz sauce and 1 14.5-oz diced italian tomatoes. I used cornstarch to thicken. With those changes, this is a 5 star meal! The meat was falling off of the bone (literally!) in two hours. I served over penne. YUM! Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This ranks right up there with one of the best recipes on the site.  This is hands down restaurant worthy at half the price and super easy.  The only change I made was to brown the meat in EVOO and then put the onions in the meat drippings.  Added all the rest in the exact quantities.  SOOOO good.  Thanks for sharing.  I will make this again.  I wanted to update.  I only had one small can of tomato sauce but I had a large can of Trader Joe's marinara sauce and decided to go with that.  It turned out just as good.  The other thing I will add is the longer you can cook this the better it is.  I like it best when it cooks for about 4 hours.

It really is wonderful. :-) I jst made it last night and it came out great!! I browned the ribs on stove top, then sauted the onions in the same pan, then put everything in the slow cooker on slow for 4 hours. Oh, I also poured a little of the red wine we were planning to drink with the dish in the pot. Turned out fantastic and the meat was falling off the bone. Excellent!!

This is the best short ribs we ever had. My husband who is a professional chef admited that this recipe is the best. The longer it sitted in the fridge (as leftovers), the better the taste. We serve this with white rice, steamed broccoli and green beans and sauteed them with olive oil and garlic powder. The meat is falling apart from the bone, so satisfying, and so comforting, we can't get enough. I am making this for family reunion in Christmas instead of having traditional turkey dinner. This is should be the star of the menu. Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

AMAZING!!! Oh these were SO GOOD!!! I seared the ribs in a pan first to get off some of the fat so I wouldn't have to skim it, but that's just me. I love to sear and then braise. I cook A LOT and I will tell you this recipe is EXCELLENT!!! Thank you MEDIVALU! I will definitely be making it again.
.. and again... and again! :)

This was terrific. I followed another reviewers advise and browned the ribs before slow cooking. I also used the left over sauce for pasta. Next time I will omit the salt. Other than that, I will remake exactly.

I loved this recipe, especially because it is very versatile. I can't eat worcestershire (because of the soy), thyme or onions. So I subbed tamarind paste and vinegar for the worcestershire; basil for the thyme; and some chopped green pepper and fennel bulb (about the same amount total as a medium onion). Delicious!

Best thing I've ever done with my short ribs! I put them in the oven for 45 @ 350 before adding the sauce and baking them @ 325 for 2 hours. also replaced the lemon juice with 1/2 cup red wine. Served over brown rice, WONDERFUL!

This is a great recipe, especially when taking the advice of every other review.  Here are the things I added/changed:    I added carrots, celery, 1/2 cup of dry red wine and three minced garlic cloves to the recipe.    I browned the short ribs & onions first on the stove top before adding to the sauce.    I substituted the tomato sauce with stewed/crushed tomatos.    We also added flour in at the end to thicken up the sauce.  It was almost a gravy consistency. It turned out fantastic!  I highly recommend adding your touch to the recipe!

Very good.  I stuck with the recipe except for I started by searing them off in a hot oven for 20 minutes or so, then tranferred to a crock pot for the rest of the time.  Turned out delicious and I didn't have to watch over them.  Thanks for the recipe.

I didn't have 28 ozs. of tomato sauce, only a 15 oz. can so I added 13 ozs. beef broth to make up the diff. I used 2 lbs. boneless beef short ribs, browned them first in a little olive oil, added 1 tsp. minced garlic and used seasoned salt in place of table salt. Simmered for about 2 hrs. Was very tender and very flavorful! Husband loved this! (He doesn't care about fat!) Next day, skimmed off the solidified fat and was much much better. This is a definately a keeper, and next time will either skim more or refrigerate before serving. I will also try the crock pot version.

This was easy and really delicious. I browned the ribs first and put them in the oven at 325 degrees and they were done perfectly. If you are bothered by the fat in the short ribs, use leaner chuck stew meat or, better yet, make the recipe ahead, refrigerate it, remove the fat and reheat.

I cannot even put in to words how well this turned out. My husband couldn't get enough, and is still raving about it days later. I will be using this recipe again, and again in the future. It would adapt perfectly for crock pot use. The variations for this recipe are endless. Thanks again for a perfect recipe!

I was a little skeptical with lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce, but measured it all out and included the suggestions of a little less brown sugar (1 1/2 tbsp) and minced garlic.  I split the tomato sauce into 1 14.5 ounce can and a 14.5 ounce can of diced tomatoes.  I browned the ribs (choice meat, go for the higher grade if you can) seasoned with salt and pepper for 30 minutes at 450 degrees and let them rest about an hour. I think this helped keep the meat from falling apart. I sauteed the onion and garlic, then added the herbs and tomatoes, just to bubbling, then into the crock pot 2 hours on high, 2 hours on low, and an hour on warm. There was some fat to skim off, but not too much. I served this with penne pasta and grated Romano Cheese. Fork tender!  With the leftovers I will dice the meat, add beef stock, carrots and peas and have a great soup for lunch

FABULOUS!!I had never made short ribs before, but I was shopping in Whole Foods and they were on sale, so I bought 2 lbs. for my husband and myself.  I was a little nervous, but listened to some of the other reviewers and braised them first, then deglazed with red wine.  I didn't have any tomato sauce, but had a jar of Bertolli sauce and used that.  I will make this again and again and again.....we thought we eating in a restaurant that's how great it was.

They were great. Doubled meat to meet our family size. Plenty of sauce left over. Also browned ribs with flour/garlic salt/ pepper dredge. Added light cream to sauce at end and served over pasta. Everyone enjoyed it even my 3 boys-8,7, & 3. Saving this recipe to try with swiss steak. Thanks for the recipe.

This one's a keeper!    My teenagers and hubby loved this recipe.  The only change I made was to braise off the ribs first.  The meat was extremely tender and the sauce was delicious and plentiful.  In fact the sauce was so good that I'm going to try to experiment with it to create a sausage and pepper recipe.

This was really good, although I don't know how to fairly rate it since I changed things quite a bit. I used the tomato sauce, parsley, thyme, and bay leaves, but I added 15 oz chicken stock. I seared the short ribs and then sauteed a mirepoix (carrots, onion, celery) and shitake mushrooms in the drippings. I then put everything in the oven at 300 degrees for 4 hours. The meat just melted in your mouth by then. Yum!

This was great.  This is so tender that even my 1 year old grandson stuffed it in his mouth.  I had short ribs at a restaurant a couple of weeks ago and tried to find a recipe that was as good.  With minor modifications this was it.  I added some crushed garlic and a splash of red wine.  I will make again.

"Restaurant quality" was my husband's response.   These are a bit spicy and very tangy.  I first cooked the ribs in a 375 oven for about an hour, then drained the fat.  Added the sauce next, covered and baked at 300 for 2 1/2 hours.  I had to thin the sauce a bit with water.  I served with garlic mashed potato and extra pan juices.  Yummy!

Although DH really liked this recipe, I feel that there was something missing, and I normally really like shortribs.  I would make it again but I'd have to check out other recipes to see what's different.

Very good; my husband loved it. Made a few changes to fit what I had on hand: used boneless short ribs; browning them in saute pan before beginning the sauce. Used can diced tomato instead of sauce. Did not use thyme, bay leaf or crushed red pepper as we do not care for them. Increased brown sugar by 1 tablespoon; added 1 tsp red wine vinegar, 1/4 cup catsup and 2 cloves of garlic.  Brought to a boil and simmered for 5 minutes. Transferred to a baking dish w/ tight fitting lid; tossed in a handful of baby carrots, and baked for 3 hours in a 300 oven.

Yowzaa .... Followed recipe and finished with a quick baked glaze. Only problem was I did not make enough ribs, everyone wanted more and they wanted the recipe. This is now my favorite short rib recipe.

This was a really simple dish to put together and then it was was just waiting after that. This had a red pepper flavor and a little heat to it. I was expecting a barbecue flavor and this wasn't. It was a bit tomatoey and had heat and wasn't bad at all. I browned my short ribs first and then cooked these as directed. When this was finished the bones had fallen right off the meat and this made a nice sauce. I liked the sauce over rice very much. The meat wasn't really that tender and I still had to use a knife to cut mine. I don't know why as it simmered for almost 3 hours and the bones fell out. We liked this okay but aren't big fans of short ribs so we won't be fixing it again. I think the addition of some garlic would have given it more depth of flavor and another dimension. This was really easy to fix, it just wasn't our thing. Thanks for the recipe.

Tried this recipe with a few modification. Browned the short ribs first and lightly cooked onions in same pan. Mixed sauce in another pan until it came to a light boil. Then put ribs in roasting pan, put onions and sauce on top, covered, and put in oven at 300° for about three hours. Came out great, my family loved it. Almost same as original recipe, but using oven let me do other things and not worry about until it finished.

I used boneless short ribs and they were AWESOME. Super-tender and very flavorful. I couldn't find my thyme so used tarragon and a bit of sage instead. I only used 1/2 tsp of pepper flakes and it was a bit much for me. Yes, I know I'm a lightweight… LOL. My husband could have had it hotter so go figure. This is much better the next day, and yes, skimming the fat is easier that way. Like other reviewers I browned the meat first and then sautéed the onions in the drippings. Great recipe, MEDIVALU, thank you :-)

Incredible!! I did add a tablespoon of minced garlic and I cooked them in the slow cooker for 4 hours (had to leave and couldn't watch them on the stove). They were SO good served with pasta!

Yummmm! I adapted this to my slow cooker. I used crushed tomatoes because I had them on hand, and reduced the pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon (plenty of spice for our taste). I roasted the ribs in the oven at 350 for 45 min then transferred them to the slow cooker. I then sauteed the onion rings in some of the grease from the meat along with the scraped brown stuff from the oven pan and 2 teaspoon minced garlic. I put the onions over the meat and the heated sauce over the onions. Cooked on low for 8 hours, then it sat on warm for another 2 hours. Served over rice. Awesome taste and tender, moist meat!!

4.5 stars, the sauce was amazing, I followed other reviewers and browned the ribs first then sauteed some onions, carrots and garlic, and red pepper flakes. Removed everything from pot deglazed with red wine. Instead of tomato sauce I used canned cherry tomatoes. I put in a 325 oven for 3 hours. The meat was really tender, served over rigatoni with fresh grated parmesan.

These ribs turned out great.  I followed the recipe exact except for browning the ribs beforehand and deglazing the pan with red wine.  I served it with "no yolk" noodles.

Eating it now!  Holy Cow. . .I think I found a new favorite.  Like the others said I added garlic, parmesan cheese and browned the meat first.  I also placed it in the crock pot all day!  Fabulous!  I will share this with my family we are all on a low carb diet and this is great! Thanks!

These short ribs are truly wonderful and my husband and I enjoyed every tender bite! The only thing I changed is prior to starting, I sauteed a few cloves of garlic in olive oil and then browned the ribs on each side. After that, as recommended by one of the other reviewers, I removed the ribs from the pan and sauteed the onions in the remaining oil and drippings. Very scrumptious! I served the ribs over campanelle with brussel sprouts and pancetta on the side.

It's been decades or more, perhaps, since I've made short ribs.  Since the meat was on sale today, I decided to give it a go.  My mother used to make braised short ribs--a long, long time ago.  This was indeed a very simple recipe.  I added sliced carrots to the mixe and didn't use parsley, since I didn't have any.  My wife generally doesn't like things prepared with tomato sauce but she did like this.  I served it over a bed of white rice--the perfect addition.

Awesome and it was falling off the bone. I didn't have tomato sauce so used cut up fresh tomatoes and a little ketchup. Which may have made it just a bit too sweet, but overall this recipe deserves 5 stars. Now if I could just learn to cook brown rice....

I really enjoyed this recipe. I add more brown sugar to cut the acid from the lemon and tomato sauce. I also browned the ribs first. I served these with garlic mash potato. Very yummy can't wait for leftovers.

I agree that this was awesome! I've never made short ribs before, so I desperately needed a recipe. The only change I made was that I used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce - and that only because I didn't have any tomato sauce. Even my mum, who is not a fan of ribs, thought it was great. Really easy, too! Thanks for the recipe!

These were very good and received good comments from my family.  I am not usually a person to review a recipe I've changed, but I could not find beef short ribs so I used bone-in country pork ribs and it was still very delicious.  I will make this again most someday, although we don't eat ribs except maybe once a year.  It was very savory and hearty.  We ate them with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

These melted in my mouth. I did add holy trinity and red wine.  And put them in the crockpot for 4 hours. Then broiled them until the fat was crispy. OMG... I will definately make these again.

Great recipe. I found it best to use the boneless short ribs sold at Costco. They also have much less fat. The suggestions to sear the short ribs first is a good one and also addinbg garlic is a must. Also if desired adding mushrooms and some root veggies add to the dish.

This is the first short rib recipe I've tried with a red sauce, and it turned out great!  The only thing I did differently  was to add fresh chopped garlic and fresh ground pepper.  We also thought it would have been even better with one more onion.  Overall a keeper!

Instead of using tomato sauce, I used fresh tomatoes.  I roasted the tomatoes (I used 5) at 350 for 30 minutes, this will put some "flavor" in the tomatoes.  Then, you put the tomatoes in the blender and add a splash of Worcestershire sauce (in addition to what is already in the recipe).  This was delicious!  Of course, this greatly increases the "prep" time.

This rib recipe was yummy. My 6 year old asked me to make it again-that's a winner in my book. I did take the advice of other reviewers and bake the ribs for about 1/2 hour at 450 to brown them, then into the oven at 325 for 2 1/2 hours and the meat fell right off the bone. Thanks!

This was weird.  I followed the recipe but I guess the tomato sauce flavor we didn't care for.  The cooking method did make it tender.  Ended up ordering pizza :-(

Excellent with a few minor changes. I used a slow cooker - 6 hours on low. I also browned the ribs first and sauteed the onions in the drippings. For the suace, I substibuted 28 oz can of diced tomato and cut the suace to 12 oz.  I also added  a cup of fresh mushrooms during the last 90 minutes in the slow cooker.  Excellent over noodles.

I have never had short ribs before, let alone cook them. They really do have a great flavor. I put all of the ingredients in a slow cooker and cooked on low for about 8-9 hours (during work). Can't wait to make again!

These are absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exact but as usual took the advice of other reviewers on a few things.  I used boneless short ribs, browned them and deglazed the pan with a cup of red wine.  Used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce.  They were so tender and the sauce had a nice kick to it from the crushed red pepper flakes.  Served them on mashed potatoes.  Definately a keeper!

Great recipe but not for beef ribs.  Might as well just do it with stew beef and start with a roux.  NOT good over pasta, had to add tomato paste, way too fatty, a real waste of the ribs.  Sauce is just liquid with a real thick layer of fat.  Tasty though.....  Do it with stew beef or a shopped up London Broil, don't waste your good ribs.

Flavor was really good. I used some beef broth, garlic, and some red wine along with the other ingredients. Meat was tender, but a little greasy (not the fault of the recipe's author!) Next time I may refrigerate it and remove the solidified fat and then reheat. I am sure the flavors would be even better!! Meat was tender. My grandmother loved it and she normally only eats two things: corn and shrimp!

I've made this twice now. The biggest issue is that short ribs have a LOT of fat. The second time I browned them and soaked the fat off with paper towels before proceeding with the recipe. It really helped cut the grease. Other than that, the flavor is delicious, the beef just falls apart, and it's a good recipe.

I gave 4 stars because of the excess fat and grease. The flavor was very good but ended the meal still hungry. I will adapt the recipe to a different cut of beef - probably a roast of some kind. I,too, added the shiitake mushrooms, browned the meat in advance, and reduced the sugar. More waste than meal. Alot of work for an OK meal.

I usually make my short ribs in the crockpot all day, but this was a great alternative.  I browned my ribs first and added 1 tlbs of dijon mustard to the tomato mixture.  Doing this resulted in the ribs falling off of the bone within 2 hours.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I browned the ribs beforehand in a non stick skillet, and then drained the grease.  I put the meat and all the gravy elements in a crockpot, stirred it up, and cooked on high for 4 hours.  It was delicious - though next time I would serve it the next day to skim off the grease after it sat in the fridge overnight.  Short ribs are fatty, and a bit unhealthy, so this step would be worth it.

not the greatest short ribs out there.  I much rather the ones that use ketchup, brown sugar and onion soup mix.  These were very soupy, not glazed at all, and without the addition of some beef soup base to give some taste, i wouldn't use this recipe again.

My first time trying short ribs. As a cut of meat, I wasn't too crazy about how fatty they were.  But this recipe seems to do the best it can with what it's got to work with.  I also added about 1/2 cup of red wine and some garlic to the sauce, along with some extra water.  I think they could have done with cooking even longer, perhaps even all day in a slow cooker.  The result was extremely rich-- it's easy to get filled up on these very quickly.

I don't review many recipes, but I do have to say that my girlfriend and I loved this recipe!  It wasn't exactly 5 stars, but it was no less than 4.  We used a slow cooker, took about 3 hours, meat was fallin off the bone.  We made spanish rice to go with it, went great with the tomato sauce.  Will for sure make again!  Also, didn't have any onions on hand, so we used onion powder instead.  Would have been a bit better with real onions.  Overall, a four and a half star recipe.  More people need to try this one!

The flavor of this sauce was great!  We didn't really like the meal, but it was because our meat was too fatty, not because the recipe wasn't wonderful.  I think I will try it again with chicken breasts or something because the sauce was so good.

Super tender.    Served over mashed potatoes.  However, a little too much tomato taste for me (and I love tomato-based recipes).   I thought that the tomato flavor overpowered the beef flavor.   Will use this as a base recipe and tweak to more of our tastes.  Thank you for sharing!

Made the sauce exactly as written. Only had a rack of pork ribs & wouldn't fit into a pot on top of the stove, so put in my turkey roasting pan & sliced the onions on top of them & then poured the sauce over, covered the pan & baked at 325 degrees for about 4 hours. Turned out very tender & very good!

Loved this recipe, delicious!  I sear the meat first, remove and sauté onion and garlic in the drippings, deglaze with a little water. Then add remaining ingredients. cook in the oven 2-3 hours until the meat falls off the bone.

I made this recipe as written, for the most part.  I did take the advice of others and baked them in the oven first to try and reduce the fat. I poured off quite a bit.  I also added mushrooms and carrots, omitted the bay leaves, and added about 1/2 cup red wine & cooked all in the crock pot on high for about 4 hours.  The sauce came out perfect.  I am rating it based on the comments of my family.  I do not care for beef and this was much too fatty for me.  Considering how high in calories and fat this dish is, I am surprised by some of the comments about how often they make this dish.

I made this tonight following the recipe as instructed (added 2 cloves of garlic) and it was fabulous.  We served the sauce over the meat and rigatoni and had a nice side salad.  We topped our pasta with parmesan cheese.  I only wish I had some crusty French bread to soak up more sauce.  This will be our go-to short rib recipe.  Thanks for sharing!

The flavor of the braising sauce was very good - I am trying to avoid sugar whenever possible, so I chopped up a carrot for some sweetness instead of the sugar, but other than that, I followed the recipe. So five stars for flavor and tenderness, but I think I am just not a huge fan of short ribs as a cut of meat. Maybe I did not prep them correctly, but the amount of fat and the connective tissue was just off-putting to me. I ended up taking everything off the bone and trying to get all the gristly stuff out of the pot, then I just shredded everything and saved it for dinner the next night.

Really good!  This recipe was not at all what I expected.  The ingredients all work together to make this sort of BBQ sauce that is so good.  I served this over rice with a side of steamed broccoli. YUMMY! It would be even better with a stew meat instead of the ribs too.

I browned the short ribs in a 10 inch cast iron skillet.  I removed the short ribs and caramelized the onions in the skillet.  I returned the short ribs to the skillet, added the other ingredients with 10 cloves of garlic, a teaspoon of chile chipotle flakes, eight small bell peppers, an Anaheim pepper, two parsnips, and three carrots cut up into bite sized pieces.  They were in the oven at 350 degrees F for about 4 hours before I served them.  Four pounds of short ribs along with 3 large heads of broccoli, a loaf of bread, and several bowls of squash soup were cleaned up by 4 adults and a very hungry teenage boy.

I just made this tonight and it was excellent, I served it over penne. I don't make changes to the recipes I find here mainly because I can't cook; I can read, so I just follow directions. Unfortunately, I had no tomato sauce so I used a combo of beef stock (1 of those little tubs from Knorr) and diced tomatoes. Not sure if that was suitable sub but it did taste good. I also browned the ribs first but other than that I followed recipe and cooking method. Thank you for submitting this I will make it again.

OMG!!!! This was AWESOME! The flavor and tenderness of the meat was delish. But you do have to SLIM THE FAT!!! What I did different was I boiled the ribs in water for 30 min. prior to cooking them in the tomato sauce. Other than that I followed the recipe to the 'T'. I served it over creamy mashed potatoes. Enjoy!!!

Very good!  Like some reviewers, I browned the meat, cut sugar to 1 tbsp, sauteed onions and garlic before adding other ingredients and added 1 14.5 oz can of beef broth.

So delicious! I made this for dinner last night. Followed the recipe. I had considered pre-cooking the ribs as others did to reduce some of the fat from the ribs, but decided to follow the recipe. Also, considered adding garlic, as others did as I too love garlic, but again, thought, just try it as written and adjust next time, if need be. The only change I made was due to pantry stocking. I used tomato purée instead of sauce. I wouldn't change a thing. Some cut the sugar or thought it was too spicy, etc. The purée I used was unseasoned and the seasoning in the recipe was perfect. Happy I did not make changes, won't next either, except for using the purée because why mess with success? 5 stars and a big thank you to MEDIVALU for sharing this keeper of a recipe!

Incredible! I also made the Chipotle Grilled Shrimp recipe I found on here, along with roasted red potatoes. I poured the tomato sauce over everything and it was phenomenal!

Very tender, fall off the bone product.  Followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed our ribs.  Hubby and I prefer smokier, bbq flavor and the sauce on these was very "tomato-ey."  I love tomatoes and sauce, but think we'll try some of our favorite BBQ sauces next time we slow simmer ribs on the stove.

Fantastic. Did it all in a cast iron dutch oven. Used fire roasted tomatoes and added a bit of beef stock. The brown sugar did amazing things in the reduction as it cooked low and slow. Served over polenta.

- BROWN SUGAR
- PARSLEY

+ MOLASSES
+OREGANO
+MEDIUM SALSA 

I thought it was a bit sweet first time around, so I substituted molasses for the brown sugar. More of a subtle flavoring. The salsa adds a bit of a tang to the sauce.

I also seared the ribs first and sautee'd the onions. Crushed the bay leaves and leave them in when served.

A couple hours at medium heat in the oven in a foil covered glass casserole works for me. I mix everything but the molasses - the ribs go in the casserole, then the sauce mix, then the molasses gets dribbled on top. Last half hour I remove the foil so it browns and candies on top.

A good side dish is summer squash. Brown them in the oven, then scoop the sauce from the meat into them. A bit of grated cheese on top is a nice touch.

This was my first try at short ribs - and they were Wonderful!  I made the recipe as instructed, but had to limit cook time to 2 hours total (recipe heading says 2 hrs, but directions say 2 1/2 hrs).  I also took the cover off during the last 30 minutes to thicken up the sauce.  The meat was tender enough, but would probably have been even more so with additional cook time.  I will definitely try this one again to find out!  I served it with roasted butternut squash and broccoli, but the amount of sauce produced needs something to soak it up - maybe pasta, brown rice or spaghetti squash?

The sauce for these ribs is wonderful.  I baked in oven to try to remove as much fat before putting in crock pot with sauce.  I'm not a big rib eater, but was getting rid of the ribs that came with the purchase of 1/2 a side of beef.  There was just too much fat on the ribs for my taste, but that could have been just these ribs.  I will definately try again with a better cut of ribs.

I'm making this now and even though the meat isn't done yet, the sauce is amazing!  I love it!  Didn't have red pepper flakes or parsley, and I had to add some beef broth because the  sauce cooked down, but the flavor is so good!. I'll make this again with different cuts of meat. Thanks!

This recipe is very easy and delicious!  I followed the advice and first browned the short ribs in the oven for 1/2 hr. at 475, then added 2 cloves of fresh garlic, and a 15 oz. can of Rotel tomatoes to the sauce, then put it all in the crock pot for 4 hrs. on hi.  Meat was very tender and flavorful!

We enjoyed this recipe.  It's a simple preparation and yields a nice slow cooked taste.  I needed to simmer it for closer to 3 hours to get the tenderness I desired.  The only issue is inherent to any recipe using short ribs.  It's a very fatty piece of meat.  But we were very pleased with the recipe.

We loved this. Bought a 4lb pack of short ribs from Sam's Club and scaled to recipe up to 8 portions. Was falling off the bone in 2 1/2 hours and made a wonderful gravy. We served with mashed potatoes. This is a keeper for sure. Only wish our ribs would've been meatier. Wonder if you could use another cut of meat? Thanks!!

Good recipe, easy and full of flavor.  I agree with other reviewers this cut of meat is too fatty; would have been better with country style ribs. I did brown the ribs beforehand and deglazed with red wine, I also slow cooked on low.

I just made this tonight and it turned out really good. My 5 year asked for a second helping. I browned the meat and baked it in the oven at 400 degrees for 1 hour. I used one large jar of Prego organic tomato sauce and cut up 2 small tomatoes to make it more chunky. I used 3 tbsp of brown sugar. I cooked it all on the stove for 1.5 hours. I impressed myself because I've never made ribs before. Yum!!

Followed recipe exactly.  Didn't smell appetizing when I first put it all together, but after 3 hrs. of cooking on low heat, it tasted fabulous.  I could have eaten 3 ribs until I read the "fat content" on the recipe.  Oh well, you have to splurge sometimes.  Excellent rib recipe.

Even though I did make a few changes I am still going to rate this one a 5*.
I used boneless short ribs as that is what I had on hand. ( I think this would have been even better with the bone in one's as the bone gives it some much more flavor.) I browned them in Olive Oil first and than sautéed the Onions in the drippings along with three cloves of minced garlic.  I than de-glazed the pan with about a 1/2 cup of red wine.  After these changes I followed the recipe to the T, with the exception of omitting some of the Salt.  
They turned out Amazing and will defiantly be making again.  I served them with Roasted Garlic/Mustard Mashed Potatoes.  Yummy!!!!!!!

AMAZING!! Changed just a few things. I used western style bone in Pork ribs(thats what I had). I put all the sauce ingerdients in the crockpot then put ribs in meatier side up and cooked on high for about 5 hours. I found the salt content way to salty so I added a can of chopped tomatoes juice and all and then added a dash more of each spice. I also added half a potato to the sauce while cooking because I had heard it would soak up extra salt and it worked. I used 2 reviewers suggestions one was adding minced garlic to the sauce(about 2 tblsp). The other suggestion I used was makinh homemade garlic mashed potatoes to serve it over.When It was done I took out the meat removed it from the bone and removed any fat I could. I then skimmed all the fat off the top of the sauce I could. Then I added 1 can of tomato paste and whisked it in and it made a fantastic sauce. I think it would be fantastic w/ rice. The best part about this recipe is the unbelievable flavor of these ingredients mixed together as well as there simplicity. Best sauce Ive ever made. Will make over and over for use in other dishes. I may also add more brown sugar next time. It takes along time for the ingredients to meld while cooking so be patient and dont start adding things right away. Definetly a keeper.

I love the flavor of the recipe.  It was great with Basmati rice.  However, that cut of meat is my only complaint.  Super fatty.  So I tried it with tender steaks and cooked it on low in the crockpot for 6 hours.  Again the flavor of this marinade is wonderful.

Thanks for a great recipe.

Let me start by saying I've never had short ribs before.  We order a half cow and that was one of the packages that we received.  This recipe made the house smell wonderful.  My husband thought the flavor was excellent, but this cut is soooo fatty that he was the only one who had any meat because there was so little.  I won't make it again with this cut of meat but may try it with other things in the freezer.

Outstanding...and so easy!  I baked the ribs first, at 400 for 45 minutes, to render some of the fat off.  Then, I added them to the sauce. The only change I made to the sauce was I used a can of crushed tomatoes.  I only had to skim the fat off the sauce twice.  I served it with jasmine rice.  My husband raved about it and is so excited about the leftovers he gets to take to work tomorrow.  I will definately make this again!

I used boneless short ribs that I trimmed as much fat off as possible before I started cooking them.  The meat was extremely tender and the sauce had a nice zing to it without being too spicy.  I left the cover off for the last half hour to thicken it some.  Served it over wide egg noodles.

Very yummy!  We'll definitely have again, but will try for a better cut of meat.  We cut the recipe in 1/2 and originally thought we didn't have enough sauce but it turned out great!

These ribs are fabulous - the sauce is so flavorful.  I was out of brown sugar, so I used white sugar and it still tasted great.  I cut the recipe and used 1 lb of ribs for just my husband and me, but wish I had left overs!  Also I added red potatoes cut in half for the last 25 min. of cooking, and they were delicious with the sauce.

This was the first time I had done beef ribs and will definately be doing them again. The meat just fell off the bone, it was so tender. Hubby went looking for more, which is always a good sign.  A definate "doer again"

This had too much of a tomato flavor for my liking.  It was like spaghetti.  I served it with pasta.  I like ribs with a barbeque flavor.  I don't think I will make this again.

Followed other suggestions - Browned Ribs & Onions 1st.  Served it over Garlic Mashed potatoes. Added mushrooms on top.  My husband is a very particular meat and potato guy and he loved it. Thank you! :-)

Used the crock pot method that was suggested by another and found it to be very easy to make this dish. Wouldn't say it is one of the best we've tried as it is really nothing more than barbecue ribs, but we will try it again.

MY family, including 3 year old picky eater, loved this.  My neighbors want the recipe.  I braised and then went to the crock pot. Cook for about 6-8 hours. We served with mashed potatoes.           SOOO GOOOOOD!!!!  MELT IN YOUR MOUTH!!!!

I made this in an even simpler way...  I threw everything - including frozen spare ribs - into the crockpot.  The sauce had incredible flavor!  I will use this recipe again - not only for short ribs but for other cuts of beef and pork also!

I'm excited about this recipe, because my husband does not like ribs, and he really liked these. I cooked the recipe as directed except used a little less red pepper flakes for kids. They were a little watery, but the meat was incredibly tender and pretty much just fell apart. The flavor was really good.

Oh my goodness!  This was yummy and the smell took over my house while cooking.  I used diced tomatoes with green peppers and onion instead of sauce.  It was great, also added chunks of fresh zuchinni from the garden and served over rice.  Will make this again.

I would give this five stars but I adjusted the recipe.  After the adjustments, it's five stars.  You really need to brown the ribs in some oil first.  Then set ribs aside.  Brown the onions in the rib"s oil, then add the rest of the ingredients.  I used my home grown tomato puree that I had canned earlier. Cooked for 4 hours.  Oh my husband tossed in some celery and carrot chunks  in the last hour.  Delicious!

This was delicious! The only changes in made were that I used a quart of home canned Roma tomatoes rather than tomato sauce since that’s what I had on hand. And I simmered the ribs about four hours total. They were grass fed organic, which in my experience take a longer, slower cooking time than conventional beef. Everything else in the recipe was followed exactly. And oh my gosh —- the leftovers the next day we’re out of this world tasty! Thanks for the great recipe.

These were delicious. I seared the meat first and caramelized the onions as well. I personally thought it was a little salty so I ended up adding more sugar to even out the taste. Next time I will omit salt and hopefully won't have to add more sugar. I also added 1/2 cup red wine at bottom of pan before adding sauce like some suggested. Maybe that caused the saltines?? idk?! anyway make these...you won't regret it.

Added a little extra brown sugar,  and cut way back on the crushed red pepper! I used the thin cut short ribs, they fell off the bone.  I definitely will make again!

Very good!! I browned the short ribs first and then I just threw everything in the crockpot and cooked it for about 7 hours or so. I will definitely be making these again soon!

I tried this recipe as a first attempt at cooking short ribs. I chose it, because it did not include flour, or pre-browning the meat. I was a bit concerned about adding the red pepper flakes, as I can't usually eat spicy foods, but decided to leave them in when preparing the braise. I purchased 3 1/2 lbs. of short ribs, and my butcher graciously cut them in thirds, making 9 portions. The smaller portions made it easier to fit them in the pot. I like mushrooms, and  added an 8 ounce pack of mixed wild mushrooms at the same time to the pot as the meat and onion. 
I turned the meat each 45 minutes, and noticed a few of the bones fell away at the second turning. I tasted the sauce at each turning. At the first turn the sauce was quite acidic and a bit spicy; the second turn was very much more mild, but vinegary. At the third turn, about 30 min before I turned off the heat to the pot, the sauce had become a deeper flavour, and the spice had mellowed to a nice, zesty tone. 
As promised, the meat was fork tender, and I found the sauce to be quite nice. While beef is a bit expensive, I would certainly feel confident serving this to guests, and think it would benefit well from mashed potatoes, rice, or some broad noodles.

Made this as written except cooked in my Instant Pot. Sauted on high to brown ribs and soften onions, then added all other ingredients and set for high pressure for 40 minutes. Did a natural release for 10 minutes then quick released pressure. I add 3/4 cup water during cook time for fear of scorching and thickened with small amount of corn starch and water on sauté at end. This was excellent and we will definitely be making this again! Great recipe!

I really like this recipe and I usually have all the ingredients on hand. I change a few things: I used homemade canned tomatoes instead of juice and I smoked my ribs on the grill for an hour and a half the for another hour I cooked them in the sauce. It took longer but it was worth it and it tasted great too!!!

Cannot wait to make it again. Oven roasted the ribs first to drain off fat.  Then made sauce using a generous portion of red  pepper flakes and about 5 cloves of sliced fresh garlic.

I was looking for something different to do with my short ribs. I have the "Korean" kind, not the really meaty big ones. Anyway, I tried this recipe because I had the ingredients in my pantry and the cook time was short. These were AMAZING!!!! The sauce was exceptionally tasty and tangy and I couldn't bear to throw the rest of the sauce away when we were done with the ribs, I intended on repurposing it in another dish. Wanted to make it again and couldn't remember which recipe I used and was almost in a panic.  Thankfully I found it and I have now added this recipe to my recipe scrap book. Highly recommended.

I followed the directions exactly except I seared the short ribs first and then cooked it all in the slow cooker. I thought it was a bit too spicy but my husband said it was perfect. I'll be making this again. I served this over egg noodles, but it would be great over any pasta.

The second time I made this I changed it up by using Heinz chilli sauce leaving out the red pepper flakes, and canned tomatoes.  My company said its the best ribs they had ever eaten, thanks all recipes, for a good recipe.

I wanted a heartier sauce, so used a jar of mild salsa instead of tomato sauce.  after searing the meat, added some mushrooms along with the lemon/soy/sugar/spices to salsa.  cooked first covered then uncovered to reduce the sauce some.

The short ribs were very good. It is definitely a keeper now. I did add 1 cup of good red wine and two cloves of garlic. I rendered the fat in the oven before cooking . I also made it two days in advance so that all of the flavors could marry. Will make again!

This is the ultimate comfort food!  I flour the short ribs first and brown them before adding all the other ingredients.  I serve it over garlic mashed potatoes and it is heavenly!

Really nice.  I skipped the sugar and the red pepper, as I don't like those, and added a crushed clove of garlic.  I cooked it for maybe  3 1/2 hours, simmering in a smallish stock pot so that everything was submerged.  For the last hour I left the lid off so it could reduce a bit.  The result was a very flavorful, full-bodied sauce and VERY tender meat!  I'll reduce the salt to 1 1/2 tsp next time, especially as I will again let some liquid boil off at the end of cooking.  I left the fat in as I am paleo and need the calories.  The sauce makes a great topping for any vegetables.

This is  very good short rib recipe.  I did brown the ribs first and sauted the onions in the drippings a little.  also added a bit more seasoning then what called for but all in all the recipe was great.  Thanks for sharing!

I have made this several times and it is one of our favorite meals. I do brown the meat beforehand and it comes out great. It is a very easy recipe to make and so so tasty! The sauce is great over rice or even mashed potatoes. This is a keeper!

I seared the short ribs first, removed them, then started with the onions. That's the only thing I did differently. This is delicious with just a little kick from the red pepper. I served them over quinoa, and my family loved it!

Awesome Recipe!  I have never cooked short ribs until today.  Whole Foods had a sale on them about two weeks ago and I decided to try them.  I pulled them out of the freezer last night and cooked them today.  I did as many of the other reviewers suggested and browned the short ribs.  I also added the red wine and garlic. I did not have tomato sauces so I substituted diced tomatoes, but followed the recipe for the remaining ingredients.  The meat fell off the bones and was full of flavor.  My husband loved it and I will definitely make this recipe again.

Really disappointed since there were so many positive reviews.   Followed the recipe exactly except to brown ribs as suggested by others.  No one in my family liked this recipe.

My husband, myself AND our 2 year old all cleaned our plates...now that's saying something!  It was delicious!  My 2 year old was shoveling it in which does a mom's heart good!  I followed the recipe exactly with the only exception of browning the ribs before hand as suggested by many other reviewers.  We ate it with white sticky rice and just raved the whole time we ate it!  Will definitely make this again...easy, delicious meal!

I made this for dinner tonight and my family loves it, I followed others who suggested trimming off the fat and brown the ribs first, then I skimmed off the fat while it cooked.  Excellent recipe for short ribs.  I will be making this again.

Very good.  Followed other suggestions and baked off some fat before hand.  Only had about 1 tbsp of parsley, but didn't find it to make much difference anyhow.  Loved the body of the sauce and so did my toddler son.  Will definately make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty recipe!  

My family still cooks in the old Southern tradition and although we haven't had short ribs in years, I decided to give this a try during one of our many large family dinners.  I made the following few changes to the recipe: added a can and 1/2 of beef stock for a "soupier" sauce, simmered a few extra minutes for additional tenderness.  I like when the meat barely clings to the bones and there is a need for a minimum of chewing.

Everyone loved the dish.  It was one of two meats served and was the first to go.  We had a lot of sauce left over that was great over rice the next day!  Next time I believe I'll try broiling it in the oven as another reviewer suggested.

I had never cooked ribs before and this was very easy.  Did not use short ribs, but still turned out great.  Browned ribs first in pan and then put in the crock pot.  Meat fell of the bones.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Kids loved it too.

my friends and family are totally in *love* with this dish.  it's super easy.  dump all the ingredients in and let it go.  of note, you will be skimming a decent amt of fat off, so be sure to make regular 'check-ins' to take another layer off the top.

This recipe is fantastic!  Not to mention easy to boot.  I seared the ribs in the pan first and deglazed with one cup of wine.  After the alcohol burned off I added the rest of the ingredients and put it in a 300 degree oven, checking every so often to skim off some of the fat.  This is definitely going to become a staple in my house.

After browning the ribs and sauteeing some onion and garlic with them, I put everything in the crock pot (including some parmesan cheese per another reviewer)and just let it slow cook for the afternoon.  I served it with Pasta with Fresh Tomato Sauce from this site.  Very Tasty.

Although my husband did not like the ribs themselves (too fatty) he loved the sauce.  I took the advice of JillP and cooked it on the stove top and it came out wonderful.  Will try this with regular ribs bbq'd on the grill

I made this last night...I added a tad more Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. My boyfriend thought it was too sweet but I loved it. The sauce could be a bit thicker. Good stuff.

I cut off as much of the visible fat as I could, then browned the ribs and drained them on paper towels. They were still too fatty, but the flavor was very good. This recipe is very easy and definitely worth keeping. Next time I'll use lean beef cubes instead. I didn't have tomato sauce so I used crushed tomatoes - it gave the sauce a nice texture.

Excellent recipe. I didn't have the lemon juice or pepper flakes though. The sauce is so versatile I could see using it for more than just shortribs. Well worth trying!

This is a great recipe. I had to substitute some tomato paste (and water) for 8oz. of the tomato sauce. It was DELICIOUS, definitely a keeper. The crushed red pepper added a nice zing - but I may use less next time to accommodate the kids. I also used red onion - very tasty. The boneless short ribs were perfectly cooked after 3 hours.
