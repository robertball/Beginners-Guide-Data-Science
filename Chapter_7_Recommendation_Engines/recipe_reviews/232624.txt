While I find this recipe very good in theory or concept (or I wouldn’t have chosen it in the first place), in my mind it has a couple of obvious flaws.  I loved the idea of soaking the chicken in buttermilk, particularly with its additions of fresh garlic and bay leaves.  I also loved the idea of coating the chicken in both Parmesan cheese and potato flakes.  Where I had the problem was with the garlic powder and paprika – well, frankly, with the Parmesan and flour too, but that’s a much smaller issue. To use the same amounts of paprika and garlic powder as you do Parmesan and flour just seems like…a misprint?  A typo?  This can’t be right.  I used a good sprinkling of each, nowhere near a full tablespoon of each.  And while you need a lot less paprika and garlic powder, you need a good deal more Parmesan and flour to coat all these chicken pieces (I cut mine in about 1” strips).    I placed the coated chicken strips on a cookie sheet lightly greased with cooking spray.  I drizzled them with melted butter and baked them at 400 degrees, about 15 minutes, turning them once about half way through. I served them with barbecue sauce and ranch dressing on the side for dipping.  Very, very good – but with the above-mentioned adjustments.

I didn't have time to make the marinade, so I just did the second part of this recipe and it turned out great!  I used boneless chicken thighs instead of breasts which I prefer because they are not as dry typically.  Pretty quick and easy!  I'd say it took about 15 minutes to do 6 chicken thighs... if that long and it crisped up nice and tan.  I did put them on a rack on top of a cookie sheet and this kept them from getting soggy on the bottom side.

Used skinless, boneless thighs. Panko instead of potato flakes. Tasted great.  Liked the heat from the cayenne pepper. Could use 1/4 tsp and still be good.  Spray the rack and pan for easy clean up.  Will make again.

Very tasty, only problem I had was the chicken stuck to the rack, so next time I would use greaseproof paper on a baking tray to cook.

Very tasty.  Came out nice and crispy.  A little labor intensive, but not bad.  Would make again.

This was not as good as we had hoped. Followed the recipe exactly. The potato coating, while creative, did not turn out well. Very disappointed.
