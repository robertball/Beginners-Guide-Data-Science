I did swap peach nectar for lemon lime soda (I used diet Sun Drop), I used sugar-free lemon pudding mix and otherwise followed instructions / ingredients per the original. This cake is FANTASTIC!! Lemon-lime soda makes a great substitute if you don't have peach nectar around. I would recommend halving the glaze - I thought the 2 cups of powdered sugar concoction was too much - it puddled around the base and made the bottom a little soggy, and I had to keep pouring it back into the bowl and re-drizzling it over the top trying to use it all. The glaze is a great addition, but I think half would be perfect. Great recipe!!

I made this today and we just had a piece of it.  It is very moist and very tasty and the frosting/icing is the best part.   Anyway, if you are looking for a very moist, peachy, lemony cake, this is perfect.  I used a bunt pan and it was done in about 47 minutes.  Thank you Acygan for putting this recipe up!

Great cake! Very moist and tasty. The addition of the peach flavor gives the  cake an interesting flavor twist. I didn’t actually have peach nectar so I puréed some canned peaches. This was the only change I made. I will make it again.

This is a great cake! I added a bit of ginger and nutmeg to the glaze to offset the sweetness and I got rave reviews. Definite keeper!!!

I actually split the batter and put 1/2 c lemon juice in one and 1/2 cup strawberry jam on the other then swirled them all around. It turned out super yummy!

My family and I love this cake.  It's easy to make and very moist.  The first time I baked it, it lasted only 3 days.  On day 3, my family requested that I make it again and to bake two at a time.  This has become one of our favorite desserts.  The only change I made was substituting the vegetable oil for unsalted butter.  It was delicious!

I followed directions and this cake came out awesome!  I don't know Memaw but tasting this cake makes me wish I did.  Brought it to New Years Eve party and received many compliments.  Will definitely make again.

My kids loved this cake--it's sweet and the flavors are sunny and bright.  I think I prefer more natural flavors, but overall, a four star recipe.  Thanks for sharing!
