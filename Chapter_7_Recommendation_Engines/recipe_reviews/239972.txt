The cookies are delicious, but I did make quite a few changes. I only had vanilla pudding, so I used that instead of white chocolate pudding. And I've never added baking soda by itself to the creamed butter/sugar mixture (like the recipe suggests), so I waited until I added the flour to add the baking soda. Also, I only used 1/2 cup of butter, and I added 1/2 cup of butter flavored shortening. And I didn't have walnuts, so I reduced the amount of chocolate chips to 1 cup, and added 1 cup of white chocolate chips instead. And the cookies are quite sweet, so I chose not to dip them in melted chocolate (and I also think the recipe would benefit from 1/2 tsp. of salt or so...)So perhaps my cookie is too different from this recipe to really fairly judge it, but the end result was still delicious!
