These are SO easy.  And, I use Splenda instead of sugar and sugar free jams (blackberry & strawberry are great!)  Just keep in fridge any that remain because  they won't fair well for long periods of time without refrigeration.

I made these but I made them into balls and did a thumb indentation and filled it with the jam!  Awesome!  Next time I want to use Strawberry -- something different!  They will be a fav I know!

These are great! I doubled them and added double the almond extract. When I rolled them out I rolled them in powdered sugar.  Everything in this I always have on hand so it was really quick and easy!!

These were very easy to make and very delicious. I think the taste is more like shortbread than a cookie. I used strawberry jam instead of raspberry and they were great. Also I let the dough chill in the frig for about 20 minutes before rolling it out.

These are very much like the ones my mom made when I was growing up. FYI, though---these are very sweet. These brought back fond memories.

This is one of my favourite recipes! I learned it from my grandmother and enjoy baking it as often as possible. This recipe is nearly exact to the one that I have in my written cookbook.  Thank you for posting it.

Really not a fan of this recipe.  The cookie does not taste like anything.  There are way better recipes like this on this site.  Will not be making this one again.

I love this recipe, my mom always made them when I was growing up.  I started the recipe and realized I only had brown sugar, which I will now always use instead!  They made the cookies very chewy and moist, and added a depth of flavor.  The color became a light caramel but still looked very appealing.

I give this recipe four stars for taste but it was awful dough to work with. I ended up making thumb prints because I could do anything else with this extremely sticky dough. If you make thumb prints use extra flour on your hands to shape and bake for 15 minutes.

I used to make this cookie all the time!  Only I had a lemon sugar glaze that I put over it.  I believe I found the recipe in Sunset in the 90s.  Everyone raves about them.  For ease, I now just make the thumbprint cookies, much easier than rolling these all out and piping down the middle.
