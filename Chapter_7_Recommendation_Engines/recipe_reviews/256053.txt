Really good chili!  Quick and super easy to make. I did add fresh cracked pepper, extra salt, sugar and a few dashes of hot sauce. Will make this again.

I substituted alligator for the chicken and a smidgen of Tony Chachere’s for a little added creole flavor and it was magnificent!

I added an extra teaspoon of chili powder. My Husband really enjoyed it. He liked it because it was spicy. I will keep it in the favored rotation.

Everyone loved it, I substituted the Ro*tel for a homemade mixture that had fewer tomatoes but more green chilies in them (since we have picky eaters) and it still came out fantastic.

I needed a recipe to use leftover jambalaya ingredients and this was perfect.  I used both red and green bell peppers.  I also didn't have a can of crushed tomatoes and used 2 instead of 1 cans of Hot Rotel and a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes.  didn't have black beans so I used kidney beans.  didn't have ground chicken but had thighs so I cooked them and shredded it.  also threw in 2 home grown chilies.  SUPER hot and super delicious.

I made this tonight and we wanted something a little different from regular chili. This was amazing. Everyone loved it. I did add some extra crystal hot sauce and a can of creole cream black beans.  But everything else we followed the recipe. Next time I may add diced jalapeños. That's just our taste. But this was delicious. Everyone wanted the recipe!

I made it, and loved it.  I followed the recipe as written, and then added heat (Creole Seasoning and Cayenne Pepper).  I'll be making this again.

I used chicken andouille  sausage from Trader Joe's, and a red pepper vs. green, plus I used red kidney beans (preference).  Made it for a get together and everyone loved it. Served it with sides of sour cream and shredded cheese.

Very good! Wanted it a bit more spicy, so I added about a teaspoon of creole seasoning. Not very creole-esk, but this is amazing with feta topper! Will make again! Thank you for a great recipe Hunts!

Very good chili.  My family loved it.  The only feedback is there is a whole lot of onion.  I like it and my family was so/so.  They really like crushed tomatoes and overall it was so easy to make.  I did have to almost triple the amount of salt though.  I'd also add sliced jalapeno next time.
