I added ABSOLUT RASBERRY Vodka instead of the rasberry liquer for an extra kick and it tasted great! Thanks KristaR68.

I added one oz. of vanilla Stoli and upped the lemon lime soda just a bit. I like my drinks a little stronger. Nice change from your average sex on the beach.

To me this is a brunch-type drink for people who don't really want very much alcohol. I used Chambord and the rest of the ingredients called for. I think this drink definitely has its place in the repertoire of brunch drinks but then I usually don't have those! This is a perfect drink to recommend to others!

A great drink... I used Sour Puss Raspberry Liquor and it tastes like a Fuzzy Peach Candy ( if you know what they are ) very yummy
