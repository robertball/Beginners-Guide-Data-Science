The vinegar was not needed for Lamb.  This recipe was not a good mix for good lamb. This distroyed the flavor of the lamb.

I made these about 1-1/2 mo. ago, pretty much according to the recipe, and my first review stated that they were SO sour that they were almost inedible.  Again tonight I subbed thick-cut boneless pork loin chops (that were VERY lean) for the lamb, and subbed about 1/2 water for 1/2 of the required oil.  What I did differently was to sub rosemary for tarragon and 2 TEASPOONS LIME juice for 2 Tbs. lemon juice.  Added a healthy sprinkle of soy sauce to the mixture.  Used a Zip-Lock bag to marinate the chops 2 hrs. in the fridge, and then let them come to room temp. for about 1 hr. before grilling them on high for 5 a side.  Absolutely WONDERFUL this way.  I could not give up on this recipe until I made it work for pork!  Enjoy!!!

Nice and tangy, and very sophisticated, without being at all pretentious.  It was a little too acidic for my kid's tender palates... so next time they get the mac-n-cheese while my wife and I get all of the lamb to ourselves!! A keeper.  Thanks Deb!

My husband made these last night.  The marinade smelled bad - very vinegary.  It didn't have much flavor and it made the chops kind of oily.

My dad and I loved this recipe!  All through the meal he kept saying "this is really good".  I had time so I marinated the meat for over 24 hours, which made it even more flavoursome than the recommended 2 hours would have.  Thanks for the great summer barbeque recipe.

I think that the marinade gave the chops a good flavour, I didn't find it too tangy.  I think it could probably do with a little more garlic though to balance the flavours a little better.

We used this recipe for our first lamb chops, though we changed it up a bit. We didn't use the vinegar, but we did marinate in red wine, basil, olive oil, garlic and pepper.   It was extremely tasty, and my husband and I were both quite impressed at how well we liked the lamb.

This recipe is very similar to one my dad used to use for beef. I made the marinade exactly as written and marinated two NY steaks overnight. It was excellent, don't know what people are talking about too oily or vinegary. The only thing I can think of is they may not have used red wine vinegar or used a very inexpensive vinegar. The only thing I would have done differently is used more tarragon. I cut it fresh from my garden and fresh is not nearly as potent as dried. I checked info on this site about fresh herbs and it said to use 1 tablespoon fresh to 1 teaspoon dried. Will definitely make again and adjust tarragon accordingly.

I substituted rosemary for the tarragon with fantastic results.  This marinade was quick, easy, and harmonious for the sophisticated lamb flavor.

Absolutely amazing! I made this with the same measurements for only 2 lamb chops. Also, I pan seared the chops and it turned out great too!

Not crazy about this marinade.  It masked the flavor of the lamb a little too much for our taste.

Used this recipe on a whim earlier this week as I had lots of time for the chops to marinade.  What a heavenly flavor.  They turned out beautifully; I will make this again and not change a thing!

I have never had lamb before and chose this recipe out of many because of the ease of preparation and layers of flavor in the ingredients.  I did take to heart the reviews that talked about the sour flavor, so I cut the red wine vinegar in half.  I'm now a lamb fan and will use this recipe again!

Ends up with a strong and bitter vinegar taste.  Totally overpowers the taste of the lamb.

Me and my boyfriend had this for Easter and I thought he was going to eat all the lamb chops and leave me high and dry.  I sauted my lambchops in a skills for about 8min. on each side and it was so juicy and tender, I thought I was in heaven.

Very good. it is a little acidic. I used less vinegar than the recipe called for.  One tip for putting them on the grill, I cut the ring of fat on the outside so they continued to lay flat on the grill.

This was my first time cooking lamb and it turned out better than I thought.  I ended up searing it in a pan on the stove and made a nice sauce out of the leftover marinade.   Definitely will be making this again.  It's quick, easy and delicious.

This can be a 5 star by adding some dried rosemary and thyme. Tarragon & parsley isn't enough.  I added 1/2 tsp of smoked salt.   Also, cut the oil to 1/3 c. unless marinading 8 chops.  1/2 cup red wine vs white.  And don't be afraid to add 2 tbsp of soy sauce. Add 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and 1 - 2 tbsp. mint sauce depending on # of chops. There's a little vinegar in Mint sauce but it won't harm the lamb.  Or, add 2 tsp of dried mint flakes instead.  These changes bumps it up to a 5 star recipe.  Marinade min. 4hrs or even over night.  Use wet pecan wood chips for a great smoke flavor.

i was looking for a marinade for chicken so i chose this and made some slight alterations.. i reduced the oil to a drizzle.. cut the red wine vinegar in half.. left out the white wine.. used dried parsley for the fresh and added 2 tsp kosher salt.. i marinated 1.5 lbs of chicken tenders for 8 hours and grilled on the george foreman.. next time i'll add a bit more salt.. other than that it came out pretty good.. i think fresh parsley (or cilantro) would be the way to go.. ty for the recipe
