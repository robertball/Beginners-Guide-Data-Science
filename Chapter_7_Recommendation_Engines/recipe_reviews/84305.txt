Very easy. Very tasty!! I had to put the tin in warm water to pop out the cups. I actually added too much pineapple and added a bit of vanilla... it was still delish!!

These were quite good and easy to make. I followed the recipe except using splenda for sugar and using fresh raspberries instead of the cherries to make it more healthy. They stayed good for a long time after I popped them out of the muffin tin and kept them in a plastic bag. Then 15-20 min. before serving I put them out on the counter. Easy side dish!

My family has made this recipe for years. I'm not fond of maraschino cherries so often substitute raspberries (fresh or frozen) instead. It is one of my favorite salads/desserts.

Very good and quick to put together. I made half with the nuts and half without. They are a little on the sweet side - next time I will cut back on the sugar just a little. Thanks for sharing.

I used kefir yogurt lime juice and mixed fruit cocktail and these came out delicious and nutritious.

So good!! My husband loves them too. I used light sour cream and about half the sugar. Still sweet and delicious. Also didn't use pecans (nut allergy) and subbed raspberries. I then topped each one with half a raspberry looked so cute. Taking them to a picnic:)

Served to a group with positive remarks. Wonder if yogurt could be sub for the sour cream. Will try that next time. Fewer calories.
