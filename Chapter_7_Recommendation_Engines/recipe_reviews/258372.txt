Amazing. Loved the freshness of the corn and crab as well as the spiciness of the sauce. May double the recipe to have extras the next time.

I loved this dish. Easy and love the heat and flavor of dish. Being from Texas...my only change would be to add some extra heat, like garnishing with some thinly sliced seeded Habanero pepper.
