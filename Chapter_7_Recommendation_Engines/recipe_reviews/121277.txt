The cooking method worked well for me,  but  since the flavor of the chicken bouillon wasn't noticeable it isn't really necessary to use it.  The toasted almonds were a nice touch that  made ordinary broccoli elegant while the butter, if you allow it to brown, contributes rich flavor.

This is the only way my kids will eat broccoli! I usually steam the broccoli with the broth in the microwave and then add it to the skillet. I keep a little of the broth & add this in the skillet with the other ingredients. Yummmmmm!

sorry to say, but i thought this dish to be very bland.  i really had high expectations since the combination of ingredients sounded good, but it just didn't happen.  everyone (6 people) agreed.  won't repeat.

Wonderfully simple and very good, the almonds were a delicious addition and I liked the flavor that the chicken bouillion lent to the brocolli.  Will make again.

11-17-11:  The almond/onion/garlic mixture if good, but should be increased in volume by a factor of four.

I love recipes like this for vegetables - just adding a couple of more ingredients to make an ordinary side dish more interesting. The addition of the almonds was great, added a slight crunch and nuttiness to the broccoli. All three of my boys ate the broccoli without complaint so I will be making this recipe again soon. Thank you for sharing, Verna!

This was a wonderfully tasting recipe. My family loved it! Next time would cut down on the salt when saute.

Seriously good!  And easy to make.  I can't imagine eating broccoli plain again.

I usually just serve my vegetables plain, but I made this as a side for company, and everyone loved it.  I especially liked the crunch of the almonds.  The chicken and onion flavors were subtle and didn't overpower the broccoli.

This was very good for a quick side! I used 'steamfresh' broccoli (cooked according to the pkg.), light butter and more almonds than called for. Also, in the end, I felt it needed just a little something more, so I added a little salt, pepper and garlic powder and that did the trick for us. I would definately make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)

My family LOVED this recipe. I did use chicken stock instead of water and bullion, though.

I love this recipe! I think it's a simple way to dress up broccoli. I made the recipe once with margarine (which I try to avoid at all costs) and once with oil. The almonds browned faster with the oil but the taste was essentially the. I'll continue to make this with oil in the future. Thanks for the recipe!
