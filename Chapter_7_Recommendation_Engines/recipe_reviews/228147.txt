Yum!  A nice change from regular old pizza.  I used a rotisserie chicken from the grocery store so the prep was super easy.  The red onion makes it though and I will probably add a little more next time!  I may even consider carmelizing the onions if I have time, I think that would be fantastic.

I make this recipe every-time I have leftover roast chicken. I only gave it four stars because I make changes. I use grilled red onions and red peppers and supermarket/deli pizza dough. I use a pizza stone also. There are never leftovers.

I made this last night for the first time. I used the regular Pillsbury pizza crust instead of the artisan one since this is what I had on hand. For BBQ Sauce I used Sweet Baby Ray's. I put some of the BBQ sauce on the crust and mixed some with the chicken breast. I also added chopped green peppers. I have picky eaters so left one end with out onion and peppers. My kids all ate it and my daughter declared it the best pizza ever!

I used this recipe as guidelines, but changed a lot of how I did it... my sister had some leftover breaded chicken, so I cut it up into little cubes. I spread the crust over a pan, and used bbq sauce just as you would use pizza sauce, spreading it to about 1in from the edges (I estimated the amount, but I thin I used about 1 cup). Then I spread the 2 cups of mozz cheese, scattered the chicken on top, and did the same with the sliced onions. To top it off, I sprinkled the fresh cilantro over the top. Then I cooked it at 400 degrees for 17 minutes. It came out well. I wanted to do it this way instead of pre-mixing and heating the ingredients because I used to work at a pizza place and this was how we did it. It tasted delicious, the crust was perfectly cooked and crispy, and I had plenty for leftovers!

I used fresh supermarket dough instead of the Pillsbury and baked a round pizza on a preheated stone.  I also shredded the chicken instead of dicing it and used both mozzarella and Mexican blend cheeses.  Delicious!

Made this pizza tonight. It was good but I wish I had shredded the chicken instead of cutting in cubes. Next time I will spread the B sauce on the dough and then put the warm chicken over it and then add veggies and more cheese.  Be sure you use good mozzarella.  It also needed a few more minutes to bake through.

Loved this!! We used a rotisserie chicken from the market & it worked out perfectly. I saut√©ed 1/2 the onion in a skillet & used 1/2 raw for added flavor and texture. We love cilantro, so we did double up on that, as well. Prior to baking the dough, did sprinkle some garlic powder onto the dough for added flavor.

Okay, I tried to review this yesterday but it's not showing up so I'll try again!  We loved this pizza!  I used Publix pizza dough from their bakery section, Sticky Fingers BBQ sauce and poached some chicken breasts.  It was excellent and I'll definitely be making it again!  The cilantro was a wonderful addition too.
