What a great twist on a layer dip.  Cheesy goodness.  The McCormick Cheesy Taco Seasoning adds a blast of flavor that can't be beat.  I added an extra 4oz can of chilis, because chilies are AWESOME.  Thanks for the recipe McCormick.

This tasted great. The McCormick Cheesy Taco Seasoning was really good in this.  I could also see this being eaten as a casserole with crushed tortilla chips on top, served with additional toppings like tomatoes and sour cream. It was fairly easy to assemble and very good just as written. *I just realized I used a larger, 7 oz can of chilies, and I thought that amount was perfect; the smaller can wouldn't have been quite enough for us.

I couldn't find the McCormick so i used a different taco seasoning packet and added a little cheese to the mix with the meat and it was just fantastic!
