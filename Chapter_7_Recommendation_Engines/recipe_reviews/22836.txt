Fantastic Dessert Tansy!! It was a great ending to a big meal. I topped it off with some chocolate sauce drizzled over top. Thanks for sharing!

Taste was good, but it was difficult to keep the layers separate.  Don't mix the frosting too much ahead of time because it hardens quickly.

This was my first ever Chocolate Cheesecake, so I was convinced that nothing could top it. Since then I have eaten quite a few difference chocolate cheesecakes and been able to see a few problems with this first one. All in all, it is a great basic recipe for someone who is trying out a chocolate cheesecake for the first time because there is still some plain cheesecake left over of one doesn't like the chocolate. I probably could have gone without the chocolate coating, but I used it and had to use milk to make it easier to spread.

I found this to be quite good but instead of using the cookie crust i made a sugar crust, i iced it with the dark chocolate sour cream mixture like said in the recipe. then  i used white chocolate to make it pretty.

Chocolate cheesecakes are always good, and this one was no different in that regard.  But I had some trouble with it... the chocolate and vanilla layers ended mixing instead of staying separate.  I believe this recipe needs some tweaking.

I thought that this had a little too much chocolate. When i left out the chocolate squares it was much better

Thanks for the recipe. It was a pretty good cheescake. The tip about the frosting is true...it hardens quite quickly.
