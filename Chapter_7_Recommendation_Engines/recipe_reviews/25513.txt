This was very popular when I brought it to an Easter party.  The only change I made was to combine the cocktail sauce with the cream cheese, sour cream and mayo rather than layering them separately.  I served it with melba toast rounds.  Very good!

I liked this recipe, but changed it a lot, so only gave 4 stars. Like another reviewer, I substited a good zesty seafood cocktail sauce and substited garlic & chive-flavored cream cheese for more flavor. Other changes that made it AWESOME: sweet peppers (yellow, red, and orange) instead of the green. 2 cups of rip tomato instead of 1. I also added black pepper, Vege-Sal, crushed red pepper, paprika, garlic power, and 2 cloves of garlic.  

By making those changes, it was spicy with garlic and had a great smoked taste. It may be too spicy for some, but we like heat.

I've made this numerous times and it's always a hit.  I used the imitation crab sticks and shred them and use the canned baby shrimp.  I've also made it with just cream cheese as the bottom layer (minus the mayo/sour cream)

Excellent recipe!  Take it to a new flavor and mix all ingredients then spoon into a mushroom cap - put into a large baking pan with 2 pats of butter bake until brown - awesome!

we love this dip for many special occasions. I have used more crab and larger shrimp for a more distinct flavour. We eat this with nachos-plain or flavoured- or crackers. If you can make it a day or 2 before needed , the flavours blend together nicely

I really liked this dip and so did my guests.  It was pretty and had that familiar crab dip taste with a twist.

Fantastic!  We always gorge ourselves whenever I make this.  If only they made crackers smaller so we could get them in our mouths faster!  :)

I didn't have the cocktail sauce so I used a cup of catsup with some horseradish, dash of salt and sugar and a few drops of fresh lemon juice.  Also used red, yellow and green peppers for color.  A huge hit at our New Year's Eve party, will definitely make this again.

I was looking for recipe ideas for over the Christmas holidays and when I saw this recipe which I've made many times over the years and will be again this coming holiday, I have to rate it as it's such a big, no, HUGE hit with our family. No changes made either, fantastic just as is. Our grown sons would be upset if I changed anything.

This wasn't that good.  I made once for a Christmas party and less than half was eaten.  I even made it a second time to be fair and even less was taken.

This was delicious, for the meat, I just used a package of imitation crab legs.  It was a hit at the party.  I used tangy cocktail sauce which gave it a bit of a bite.

I used imitation crab cuz we like it and I forgot to buy the shrimp. But it was still great. We dont like Mayo so I used Miracle Whip. I was worried about cream cheese, sour cream and mayo together but was pleasantly suprised.

It disappeared so fast I couldn't believe it.  Did not put crab in but made rest the same with bite size nachos.  Everybody asked for recipe, even an 8 year old.  Got it from someone that made it for a fund raising at work and people where bidding on the whole plate instead of buying one bite for a dollar.  Thanks, will become a family classic I'm sure.

Love this dip!  I didn't have the crab or shrimp, so I made it without and it was still delicious.  I took it to a party and came home with a clean plate.

I was looking for a recipe like my friend's mom used to make when we were growing up. This dip is delicious! I used twice as much (fake) crabmeat and cut out the shrimp completely and it is soooo good. One of those things you bring to a party and everyone wants to know who on earth made the delicious dip they can't stop eating!

I am not sure how to rate this. I was not a fan of it. I made it for a party and everyone else seemed to love it and it didn't last long. So for me 3 stars, from my friends, I would say they would give it 5 stars. I left out the pepper since I am not a fan of them.

Mmmmmmm...always a favorite. I find that a slightly bigger plate works better, about 15" or so and I like to top with purple onion instead of green to add a little zip.

I made this for a pre-Christmas get-together with some friends and family on a Friday night. My daughter and step-daughter devoured it! I had to make another on Saturday so I could have some too! I made mine with just shrimp but will add the crab meat next time.

Yum, a good combination of everything. I have made this from other recipes and the layer of cream cheese, mayo and sour cream can be overwhelming. This is perfect! I also used cheddar cheese instead of mozzarella.

I was sick of buying at Sobey's. Sooooo, I went there with this guide and yum. I placed the seafood on the seafood sauce and then the veg, cuz really you want the seafood taste with the sauce. Thank you..... Will make again!

Delicious.  My shrimp-loving husband really liked this.  I used chive/onion cream cheese instead of plain.   Other than that followed the recipe exactly.  Will be making this one again.

Loved it, was a big hit!  I do make sure I use cocktail sauce with less spice to it.

Delicious!  The only change I made is I used chill sauce instead of seafood sauce (seafood sauce is probably better - but I didn't have any) and I put the pepper, tomatoes and green onion on top of the shredded cheese.  It was really really yummy!!  thanks

I added an Herb & Garlic seasoning in the cream cheese mixture, and made my own seafood sauce with ketchup, horseradish and worcestershire.  I chopped up the shrimp into small pieces, and omitted the crab as I didn't have any in the house.  It was a hit, everyone loved it.

Made this recipe for thanksgiving and it was such a hit, it was requested that I bring it for Christmas! I live in the NW where we always have access to fresh crab and shrimp, so this dip was perfect.  Much loved by all!

I made this dip for a party and it was a huge hit! I didn't have mozza so just used chedder cheese, and I didn't have any crab so I just used more shrimp. Turned out great, thanks!

I made this because I'd had something similar tasting at a Christmas party and this was so good!  I didn't muck around with the recipe at all, just made it as it said to and it was great.  Big hit!
