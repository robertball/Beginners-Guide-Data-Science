This was very good.  The bread had a great texture.  I only give it 4 stars because I think next time I will put some seasoning in the dough instead of just on top.  I also think I will put minced garlic, fresh basil, rosemary and crushed red peppers in the olive oil for dipping.  It just wasn't as tasty as I expected.  With a couple of modifications, this can be a great recipe!

Very easy (and I am not much of a cook!) and my husband loves it!  In a convection oven, bake for only 25 minutes. Covering immediately out of the oven with a towel for 15 minutes softened up the crust perfectly. Makes great pannini! Next time, I think I'll add some garlic to the olive oil that is used.

YUM!! This is one of the easiest yet tastiest bread recipes out there! Followed the recipe pretty closely. I did add some garlic powder and herbs to the dough after I read the reviews and will probably do it again next time. Was a little (ok a LOT) more liberal with the parmesan. I was concerned the dough was too sticky (much stickier then typical bread dough) but I baked it anyways and it turned out perfect. Husband LOVED it. 5 star recipe!

A great bread recipe even if you aren't a bread baker.  I am unfamiliar with making anything but quick breads, but this recipe was easy to do.  I followed other people's suggestions and added a little garlic powder and some italian seasoning in the dough.  Comes out great!

My tips. I let it rise for the 1st 30 minutes in the oven, out for the rest of the time. First I turn it on low for a few minutes then turn it off . also I don't use the 13x9 pan. I put it on a large cookie sheet covered with parchment paper. It makes a large round loaf. It's great for dipping in olive oil or better yet a Basel garlic dipping oil . I've try other grated cheeses like Pecorino Romano.  yummy!

Delicious, but I only gave it 4 stars because the baking time is WAY too long! My first batch came out hard and too crusty. I looked at other recipes and baked my second batch for 17-20 minutes and it was wonderful.  Very easy dough making, too.

Very easy!!  I didn't think there was enough flavor though, so I added additional herbs.

I didn't read the reviews before making this recipe.  Follow directions with the exception of the parmesan cheese.  I just topped the bread with the olive oil and a mixure of herbs.  It was good as written, but I too agree it would be better with some herbs mixed into the dough.  Super easy recipe. Thanks!

This is so easy.  You basically put it together and forget it.  For our personal tastes, it needs garlic which I added.  It made a wonderful accompaniment to our dinner.  Fabulous recipe – a keeper!

This turned out great!  I served it with an eggplant bake.  We dipped it in olive oil with parm cheese and Italian seasoning in it.  I might add a little garlic to the dough next time, but it was great as it was!  Nice change from ordinary bread.

Man this was fantastic! A great recipe for someone who doesn't know much about bread making. The great part about it is you don't have to knead the bread! I didn't have enough parmesan cheese, so I grated normal cheese thinly. It worked great.

Really enjoyed my first attempt at focaccia bread.  In the flour mixture I did add some italian seasoning, garlic powder and some fresh basil before baking.  My only complaint is that I felt like it still needed more salt, that 1 tsp. of salt just wasn't enough.  I added some while the bread was still warm, just sprinkling it on top, but in the future I would add an additional tsp.

This was my first time making focaccia. I loved it! This is a great base recipe to build on. See my changes:I added fresh chopped garlic 2 cloves, 1 tbsp dried rosemary and 2 tsp of Italian spice blend to the mix, otherwise it’s bland. I turn the oven on very low for 4 mins, turn it off, then let it rise in the oven with a damp towel on top and just use your fingers to poke it down, and I add more dried rosemary on top after poked. Cooking time for me was only 20 mins. I also use two pans, one 11x8 and the other 8x9 sprayed with pam. I got two batches out of it. Maybe it was a little thinner but I didn't mind. Mine made around 20 pieces (cut a bit smaller) also better for calorie watching.Dough will be very sticky, don't worry, supposed to be like that. DO NOT ADD ALL 1/4c of oil. ONLY add 2 tbsp to the dough, and another tbsp or two on top before baking.I have made this twice in one week cause it's fab with soup on a cold fall day! Thanks!

This was my first time EVER making focaccia and it turned out AMAZING! but i did change some things, i didnt cover it a 2nd time, i put olive oil on the pan before i put down the dough, i put sea salt, rosemary, and garlic on one half and just sea salt on the other. I used to live in italy and seriously- it was sooooo close to the real thing :)

First of all, I just want to say that if you accidentally put the whole 1/4 cup of olive oil in the bread dough like I did the bread will still turn out. I did that while distracted (3 kids 3 and under will do that to you) and was out of flour to make more so I gave it a shot and it was still really good. I added 1 tsp. each of garlic powder and onion powder and 2 tsp. of Italian seasoning and only baked for 25 minutes which was perfect. My husband loved it. I'll try it next time with the right amount of oil, I'm sure it will be even better.

This really was easy. I've only made bread one other time and this turned out really well. My only problem was that it stuck to the pan- even though it was well oiled. I did add tons of extra seasoning and next time I'll add even more.

This is a household favorite, I always keep these ingredients on hand!  I put minced garlic and herbs in the dough as well as on top of the bread, and serve it with extra virgin olive oil, minced garlic, Italian herbs and Parmesan cheese.  It's great as an appetizer, and also for a snack when guests come over!  So yummy, and so easy.

I put the Italian Seasoning inside the dough rather than sprinkling it on top and loved it that way! The flavor reminds me of the bread dipped in olive oil and seasonings that you get at nice Italian restaurants. Very easy to make.

What a great change of pace this is from quick breads! I give this a 5 for ease of prep and a 4 for flavor... it could use a touch more of... something. I added garlic and onion powder to the dough. Subbed 1-1/4 cups whole wheat flour for part of the white. We enjoyed dipping slices in x-virgin olive oil and shredded parmesan cheese. It was perfect with bowls of hearty chicken-veggie stew.

This is my go-to focaccia recipe! However, I made some changes, a couple based on other reviews and a couple I came up with on my own. First: I use Italian seasoning in the dough, mixing in about 1 tsp. or so. 
Second: I finely chop fresh rosemary, 2 or 3 sprigs, and sprinkle on top before baking, along with a light drizzle of olive oil and a little (OK, maybe a lot) of grated Parm. I don't usually have other fresh herbs on hand, but a couple times I did have some thyme, oregano, and basil in the garden. A nice blend of these chopped finely and on top is delicious!
This recipe is extremely tasty and extremely easy! With these minor changes, definitely a 4-star recipe!

I think this bread needed more favor (in the bread itself). It was super easy, fast and pretty but I'd add a bit of italian seasoning and probably even garlic powder to the dough if I was to make it again.

I doubled the Parmesan cheese and put thinly sliced onions on top of half the pan. Baked for about 25 minutes. I thought the onion side tasted better. I will definitely make this recipe again.  And I'll eat the leftovers toasted and dipped in marinara.

Beautiful! Brought this to my sisters for a family dinner and the entire pan was empty before I knew it. I used an Italian seasonning pack, the kind used for salad dressings. Sprinkled some in the dough and on top before baking. A keeper recipe!

Super easy and tasty. The only thing that stopped this from being 5 star is the dough needs some seasonings.. salt, herbs.. something. It's a little bland. For some this might be perfect already, but I am a salt fiend

This recipe was great! I have had many disasters with yeast bread, but amazingly this recipe worked very well. I had regular active dry yeast instead of rapid rise so I just let it sit with the warm water and sugar for about 15 minutes, then added the rest of the ingredients, and this worked fine. Instead of italian seasoning I just sprinkled dried basil and oregano, along with a generous amount of minced garlic. It turned out beautiful and much fluffier than store bought focaccia- and it is yummy too! Great recipe!

AMAZING!!! Melt in your mouth! I added some Italian seasoning to the dough and later added more to the top and came out beautiful. definitely will make this again!! Oh and you don't need a wooden spoon to make the dips I just used my fingers.
