One person says it tastes like a funnel cake; another says frittata.  When I see remarks like that, I simply have to try the recipe.  As a breakfast pancake, I wouldn't give this but a 3* rating.  But as a quick delightful economic after dinner dessert?  I'd give it 5* (assuming you throw on powdered sugar, fruit (fried apples would be insane - we tried berries), and/or whipped cream.  Will definitely make again - but never in lieu of pancakes.  Final note:  add splash of vanilla, cut eggs to 1 1/2, sugar to 1/2 t, baked @ 425 for 18" using insanely hot preheated cast iron skillet.  Oh.  And what does it taste like?  You'll have to try it yourself to find out...

Great basic recipe.  I used white whole wheat flour and it came out great, though it only needed to cook for about 15 minutes.  Next time, I will cut the butter to 1 1/2 - 2 tablespoons and try honey instead of sugar. I might also try adding cinnamon and vanilla.

Update: 2 tablespoons butter, honey instead of sugar, and the addition of cinnamon and vanilla worked great!

My whole family loved this quick breakfast. My husband kept saying, 'Funnel Cake Pancakes! These taste like Funnel Cakes! Wow...Yum!' The recipe called for 1tsp sugar which I'm not sure if that would be correct so I upped it to 1 tbsp. we loved it and will make again.

This is a Dutch Pancake or a sweetened version of Yorkshire Pudding. My only addition is 1 tsp of baking powder because it turns out just a bit thicker. When we have it with a meat dish I leave out the sugar and top it with gravy from whatever type of meat I made. When we have it for breakfast, since it has two eggs in it I make two of them and we both have one along with 4 sausage links or 4 strips of crisp cooked thick sliced bacon from the butcher counter. I'll top it with maple syrup, hot cherry pie filling or our favorite, hot apple pie filling. It's a very filling and comforting breakfast that we usually have on a weekend morning so we can enjoy that wonderful satiated feeling and just lounge around for a couple of hours. As stated it looks fancy but super easy to make.

My family has been using a more basic recipe for baked pancakes for as long as I can remember. I have tried many different types of pans, but the best, by far, has always been the ol' trusty 9 in cast iron. My mother used this for dual purpose growing up. 1: We all enjoyed the  out of it. 2: she said we had to be quiet or the pancake would fall. However, if I may give you 1 tip, beat the eggs lightly in a seperate bowl, then mix in with the rest of the batter. It will keep you from over beating the eggs. If you do over beat them the pancake loses a lot of "fluff" and doesn't rise very well.

I have been making this for years! We call it "eggs delight". Instead of white sugar, I use brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla, then serve with maple syrup. (No lemon juice). Quick and easy and always a hit!

My kids grew up on this and are now making it for their little ones. The only difference is that after taking it out of the oven and the lemon juice is sprinkled on, I spread orange marmalade on it and then sprinkle with the confectioner's sugar. You can use your favorite jam--strawberry, raspberry, blueberry. . .yum-m-m-m-m-m!

We've made this pancake for years. Our recipe calls it a German Pancake, the ingredients are doubled and cooked in a 9x13 pan which cooks at the same temp.x  18-20 min.  We serve it with fresh strawberries and powdered sugar. It's an easy and fast breakfast with little fuss.  My kids love it.

These DO taste like funnel cakes. How delicious! I was low on milk, so used yogurt instead. It added a nice bite to the pancake. I garnished it with sugar and lime juice. Awesome recipe.

This was a terrific breakfast for my husband and I. Took the advice of others and added a tsp or two of vanilla, increased the sugar to 1 tbsp and added some cinnamon (we really like cinnamon pancakes). Perfect. Next time I might try some mashed bananas or other fruit.

I made this with GLUTEN FREE flour. I put it in a non-stick calphalon cake pan and baked it for 15 minutes.  It was crispy, golden brown around the edges and done in the center.  The BEST part was no more waiting at the griddle, spraying each time you drop a pancake, no more soggy pancakes while waiting for the last one to be cooked, no more serving everyone else while you're at the stove flipping the next pancake!  Everyone eats at the same time. I inverted my pancake on a plate as you can see from my picture, cut them in wedges and let everyone put their own topping on their portion. I like mine with lemon curd, or jam and a little whipped cream for a NICE presentation!  I will make this again and again!

We call this a Wooden Shoe.   Best when baked in a cast iron skillet which also keeps it warm at the table.   also great with fresh berries or orange marmalade.

It is fun to make and tastes delicious.  We use a cast iron pan rather than a pie tin.  It is also very good sprinkled with blue berries before baking.

This came out more like a crepe. It's not what I consider a traditional pancake. It was very tasty. I think this would be perfect for guests or along side other breakfast dishes in a buffet. Although I buttered well, it still stuck to my stainless steel cake pan. For those who have Krups convection toaster oven, I lowered the temp by 25 degrees to 400 and time down to 18 minutes otherwise it might have burned. The inside was very soft and looked uncooked but it was done, knife came out clean.

I make this all the time,  well, probably every third weekend. I serve it with maple syrup and bacon on the side.  I believe Chef John called them Dutch Babies.

I wanted to make something different for breakfast, but only had egg yolks to work with (I had used the whites the day prior for something different). I doubled the recipe to use the yolks and 2 TB sugars as mentioned in earlier review and pour into two pie pans. The batter was very lumpy, but I assumed it was like "boxed" pancake mix that recommends some lumps. They cooked in 15 minutes and I sprinkled with sugar, omitting the lemon juice because that just didn't sound good to me. The family loved them! The one "pie" was for my husband, the second I split in half for the two kids. My daughter placed some raspberry preserves over her piece, while the other two left plain. Thanks for a new and creative twist on breakfast!

This is very similar to a baked Apple pancake I've made for years. After melting the butter, coat the bottom and sides of the pan with it. Then sprinkle a coating of cinnamon sugar over the bottom and spread Apple slices over that. Finally, gently pour the batter over the entire bottom of the pan and bake as directed. When done, the baked pancake will rise up the edges of the pan resembling a bowl.  Turn the pancake over and out of the pan onto a large plate and add powdered sugar and syrup as desired. Then, pig out on it. Enjoy.

This was good and very easy but the texture is not what I expected.  It was kind of like an omelet in texture.  I added a little cinnamon sugar on top.  Worth trying again!

Tasty.  I accidentally put the lemon into the batter, but it was delightful!  My pancakes were done within 15 minutes at this temp and I sprinkled them with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar.....Sensational!  Thanks for the winning recipe!

I've been making this recipe for a long time, a very similar one was in an old Cooking For Two cookbook! I like to use the lemon juice then top it with boysenberry syrup and a dash of powdered sugar. I think the recipe could use a dash of vanilla extract to cut the flour/egg taste, if you're going a sweet route.

Next time I will use 2 TBL of butter instead of 3. It was a bit greasy for us. I added 1.5 tsp vanilla and 1tsp baking powder. We ate with maple syrup for breakfast and it was delicious !  A keeper for sure. Easier than traditional griddle cooked pancakes. I used cast iron skillet like others suggested

Very good! 
I've been using this site for years and never left a review but I thought now was the time. 
I made this two times and the first time I did as the recipe states then this 2nd time changed it with the tips others have left. Both came out awesome!  I added a little cinnamon and vanilla to batter and once cooked put fresh fruit on top my 7 yrs old grandson loved it both ways and this is going to become our Sunday brunch tradition. 
Thank you for posting this great recipe

Amazingly easy and tastes wonderful! With lemon and powdered sugar..yes, it tastes like funnel cake. But... With syrup, (no need for more butter), it is an incredible pancake!

My first time making this and I did not make any changes to the posted recipe. I added the fresh squeezed lemon juice and  confectionery sugar and the family totally enjoyed every bite. I would make it again just as the recipe reads.  After reading other reviews, I look forward to being creative and incorporate other ingredients.

I like it with fruit on top.  Will try unsalted butter next time.  Bananas or canned peaches or pears sliced and warmed with butter and brown sugar.

Easy and tasty - but I can't imagine eating this for breakfast.  I served it for desert with fresh whipped cream, berries, and slow-cooked bourbon apple slices.

It was yum! As it was just for me, I halved the recipe except for the sugar and wish I hadn't. I could easily have eaten it all. Of course, that translated to less baking time. I left out the confectioner's sugar and lemon juice and it was great. Next time I'll try it with cinnamon and vanilla, and likely use a little less butter, probably add a bit of baking powder. Unique, buttery taste.

SO delicious, this will be a new regular for our family.  I love the eggy consistency, and it still had a little pool of butter swirling through once cooked.  I added vanilla and used brown sugar as some suggested.

I love this recipe and it really is easy peasy. I always double the recipe but ignore the butter and use a pan spray to prevent sticking. The other thing I always do is add a cup of blueberries or other fruit - frozen or fresh - if frozen try and thaw. Everyone loves this recipe and it doesn't take long to disappear.

This is very good!  It really puffs up tall and is so pretty.  The only thing I would recommend is to turn the oven to 400 if you use a glass pie plate so that it doesn't get too brown.  Husband and I just loved it!

I've been making this for decades but while the pancake is baking I cook in a sm. kettle on top of the stove 2 apples chopped, 1 Tblsp. sugar, 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg until the apples are soft, approx. 15 minutes. Served on top of the pancake, the dish will serve 4 people.

Loved this!  Doubled the recipe and made this 100% diet friendly using CarbQuick for flour, 1/4 cup of Splenda, 1/8 cup of Erythritol, heavy cream and added cinnamon.  I did not use the lemon or confectioner's sugar although I will try it next time using Swerve for the sugar to make it diet friendly.  This is delicious with sugar free, carb free maple syrup and butter or butter substitute.  I added a little peanut butter to one serving to taste and it was also fantastic.  Super easy!

This is one of the best pancakes I have ever eaten.  It to me is a mix between a pancake and french toast.   
It would really be good with fruit as the other people have suggested.  I use powdered sugar and syrup for my topping.

Like some of the previous reviewers, I reduced the butter to 2tbsp which is still a bit much and used honey instead of sugar. Added some spices for the flavor profile I like - vanilla, cinnamon, & nutmeg - about ½ tsp each.  topped with lemon juice, ¼ tsp each cinnamon & ginger.

Whole wheat or white wheat are good flour subs, will try with other flours one day.

This was delicious! Doubled the sugar and added a teaspoon each of vanilla extract and cinnamon -- all as other reviews recommended. It really puffed up. Cooked it a bit too long, but next time will cook a few minutes less. Also next time will try to add some mashed banana and maybe some semi-sweet chocolate chips.

We call them Monster Pancakes"  I learned how to make these 45 yrs ago.  Our fave special brunchey company breakfast, lunch or dinner. I use 1 egg, 1/4 c. Milk, 1/4 c. flour, 
2 Tbls butter per pancake.   Melt butter in pie tin in oven while it's preheating to 450. At the same time mix milk, egg, and flour. When butter is melted pour batter into pie tin.  If oven hasn't reached 450 yet, wait.  At 450 put filled pie tin(s) in oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from oven and sprinkle a Tbls of powdered sugar all over the pancake and return to oven for 5 minutes.  The remove, slide onto plate and squeeze 1/4 to 1/2 a lemon over the top. I like a lot of lemon so I use a half.  Most ovens can accommodate at leas 4 pie tins, maybe 6. .

This recipe is great; oven pancakes were the Sunday mornings of my childhood!!! Having that said here are a couple pointers: it's a pancake so you need some sweet but we always pour lemon juice in, then powdered sugar and filled it with fruits! (strawberries, bananas, the works; RAISINS ARE A MUST)
Also, it probably won't turn out too well with the baking instructions above. We started by swirling the butter really, really well around the sides then bake at 425 for 10-15 minutes then 350 for the last 10 minutes. Oh and pop the middle when it rises. Enjoy!

These are similar to Dutch Babies that we had when I was a kid.  Must be served piping hot and with some extra butter. And be sure to use real butter, not margarine.

While this was okay, it is in no way shape or form a pancake. Made it for the grandsons and they said..."It was okay Papa, but I thought you said we were having pancakes. Lesson here is, make it, but call it something else. As for me...haul out the griddle and start flippin'.

Haven't made this yet but it sounds like Yorkshire Pudding that mum used to make to go with the lamb roast every Sunday.  Will give it five stars because I know it will be good, we served it with brown gravy.

It's a sweet version of what we call Yorkshire Pudding in the UK. Leave out the sugar and it is good with roast beef and gravy.

Pretty good - I actually thought it tasted like French toast. I increased the sugar to 1tbsp and added 1/8 tsp of baking powder and a generous sprinkle of cinnamon powder to the batter. I didn't have any lemon, so had to skip that part. Very tasty!

Flavor was fantastic. I added 1 tbsp of sugar instead of 1 tsp. Don’t know why mine didn’t puff up as much as everyone else’s but the flavor was wonderful anyways. Sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and drizzled with maple syrup. Will definitely become a family staple.

This is a super easy recipe that is delicious. Way better than traditional pancakes. Doesn’t serve many so I usually double the recipe and make two batches at once.

This is also called a “Dutch Baby”!  It’s nice to add 1/2 tsp of vanilla or almond extract to the batter for a little enhanced flavor. I like to serve mine with Confectioners sugar, the juice of a  lemon, and topped with fresh raspberries, strawberries, blueberries. And confectioners sugar.  Yum!

I'm giving this 4 stars only because it doesn't resemble a pancake.
I made this for my son and I for a quick and easy breakfast so that I wouldn't have to stand at the stove making pancakes for a half hour.
I was out of butter and eggs so I used Ghee and Flax meal egg replacment. (1 TBS flax meal, 3 TBS water.) And I did not put lemon or powder sugar on mine. I ate it plain.
It turned out very good!
The pancake ended up a little crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. It had a slight eggy taste which I imagine would have been more profound had I used actual eggs instead of flax meal.
It was a little greasy, though I realize it would have stuck without the amount of butter, and had I used powder sugar it would have soaked the butter up.
Overall I would make this again, but don't think it's like traditional pancakes! It is not.

Sooooo good.  A lot easier than the Pan method, though make sure rack is lower so edges don’t burn.  Cut into fourths.  Great with Nutella and strawberry or cinnamon sugar.  Would love to try and combine with apple pancake recipe.

Delicious! and super easy. does not taste like your standard pancake. and not sure the serving size of 2 is accurate... good luck sharing! its more for a serving of 1! you can easily modify and add your own toppings.

Only critique/suggestion: 
1: Cut down on the butter or your baby will be SWIMMING
2: Don't expect a pancake. This is delicious, but very much not the same taste and consistency as a pancake. 
Pro tip:
1: After pouring the batter in the dish, sprinkle with course sugar like 2: Turbinado or Raw. A honey/syrup drizzle would work nicely, too. 
3: Add a dash of vanilla

I was so, SO happy to have found this recipe. My mom used to make something just like this and called it "Puffy Pancake" because it creeps up the sides. It's basically sweetened Yorkshire pudding. You'll see it called a Dutch Baby, too. The middle is very dense and chewy and the edges are lighter and crisper.
One thing she always added was frozen fruit. I defrosted mine slightly (microwave for one minute), but just hand drizzled them over the top AFTER pouring the batter into the dish. I went slightly less on the milk because I knew the water release from the berries would water it down a bit. It came out perfectly. The berries break down in the heat and release all their sugars. It's divine. 
I "unfortunately" (wink wink. I could eat this every day) will have to make it again because I forget to set the timer and had to eyeball it/test with toothpicks.

Followed the recipe precisely but it did take longer to bake at my high altitude mountain home.  Took an idea from another review and cooked up a peeled, sliced apple in butter, sugar and cinnamon and scooped it on top before serving.  Four teenage boys gave it an “awesome!”

Doubled the recipe and used a cast iron skillet in a wood stove.  Came out perfect - crispy edges, flan like middle. Added caramelized bananas to the top - delish!

I followed the recipe exactly & it turned out great! I love the added lemon juice as it give it a sweet and sour taste which I love. The crisp edges are my favorite part. Next time I may split it between 2 pie plates to see if that will make it thinner & more crispy.

I have had some that are thicker.  I like it, because it is a cross between custard and a crepe, in other recipes I have tried.  We always called it Pannukakku or a Finnish oven-baked pancake.  In a pinch, you can put fruit preserves on it also.  I like this one a lot.  It is fun to put it in little individual custard bowls and baked it split into personal sized versions, with a dollop of freshly whipped cream on it and some fresh strawberries.  Noms!!

I used room temperature eggs and milk, a drop of vanilla, an extra 1/2 tsp sugar.  Mixed wet and dry ingredients separately and then combined.  Topped with blueberries and strawberries and drizzled a little maple syrup and sprinkled powdered sugar.  For my first time making this simple recipe, it turned out really good - even my husband really liked it!

WE loved it - I made it with gluten free flour and added blueberries - cut back on the butter to about half and it was perfect and delicious!! My husband wants us to try it with adding some other fruits or even ham and veggies sometime.  I used honey rather than sugar and didn't use the powdered sugar due to preference.

My partner loves baked pancakes, and these were no exception. Loved how easy this was! I opted for maple syrup instead of sugar in the recipe and fruit and maple syrup to finish it. Thanks for a fantastic recipe! #AllrecipesAllstarsCanada #forthoseilove

I LOVE these! I call them popover puffs if I make it savory. If you leave the sugar out of the pancake it's a delicious vessel for beef  stew or your favorite chicken pot pie mixture!

Great recipe!  I double the ingredients and cook in a cast iron pan.  It was huge!!  I add the lemon juice with the mixture instead of on top.  Either way it was great!!

As others have noted, this is also called a "Dutch Baby", or if you don't use sugar it's the base for a Yorkshire pudding. Always thought this looked tricky, but I followed this recipe to a "t" and it was simple and delicious! Tastes just like the ones from

I made these "Dutch babies" for my husband and other family members this morning for brunch after church. They were very good. I made a couple of pancakes with salt and a couple without. Nobody else could tell a difference in the salt level, but I could. I preferred the ones without salt. I did not use powdered sugar or lemon juice but followed the recipe otherwise. I even made one in a cast iron skillet, but I liked the ones done in the oven. The cast iron pancake was done in less than 10 mins. In my oven, all the other pancakes were done in 14-16 mins. I topped the pancakes with a sweet ricotta cheese filling (ricotta, heavy cream, and sugar), and a homemade fruit and whiskey sauce. Delish! My dad isn't a big "sweet" fan, but he couldn't stop talking about these! lol I'll definitely be making again.

Excellent recipe!  I'd never baked my pancakes before and was skeptical about this method.  It turned out beautifully with light maple syrup and confectioners  sugar.  I would cut down the amount of fat in the pan for next time: three tablespoons was a bit much and I had to drain a bit of butter off the top.  Thanks for sharing!  My newest go-to for Saturday brunch.

This is a delicious recipe.  I would agree with other reviewers that this is probably better as a dessert not something to fill you up in the morning unless you eat a whole one.  Since it does not rise there is not much to fill you up.  I made a mistake and made 3 for my family ( 2 adults and 6 children ( 1-12 years old)).  This was not enough.  Everyone loved it, and I made it as  written except I added 1 tsp vanilla per recipe.  If you are feeding a few people this is a super easy and tasty recipe.  I would not recommend it for trying to feed a larger crowd unless you have tons of 9 inch pans or some time to wait.  Ours cooked in 15 minutes not 20.

This was really tasty! My only suggestion would be to cut back the butter a little. It was pooled on top of the pancake and I poured at least a tablespoon off before serving and it was still plenty. Yum!

Possible health issues aside, this simple, delicious, and begs for improvisation  w/ something new added to the "bowl" each  time. Most surprising was how much that touch of lemon improved a pancake! Note: if you plan to eat this by yourself: BE HUNGRY because it is also filling!

Used buttermilk instead of milk, honey instead of sugar, added half an apple, 1 tsp vanilla, dash of cinnamon, allspice, cloves, and nutmeg.  Will definitely make this again, it is easy and a really good reasonably quick breakfast.  seems like it would be a little bland as written

I made mine in a #8  three notch Lodge skillet, and it turned out beautiful.  However, I will decrease the time and the temp a bit, because it seemed a bit overdone.  I'm also going to separate it into 2 #3 skillets  next time.  Adding fried apples was delicious.  I want to try fresh strawberries, and blueberries at some point.  Easy to make.

Very tasty.  It's not really a pancake or a crepe, but it's a great, faster and easier alternative.  I used a 10" oven safe nonstick pan and it turned out very nice.  It had a nice crust and stayed warm because we kept it in the pan.  I put  less sugar into the batter because I served it with powdered sugar and maple syrup which are plenty sweet.  I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the batter.  Will make again.

Came out better than expected. Substituted coconut milk for milk. Nice and fluffy, slightly heavy egg taste. Used less salt as well by just over half or so. Would make again.

Delicious.  Had a 10 inch iron skillet, so I reduced the ingredients by 1/4.  Threw in some blueberries just prior to putting it in the oven.  Baked up beautifully and was so delicious.  Not too sweet.  Thanks.

I added lemon juice before baking (oops, that turned out fine).  As a breakfast-for dinner item (with some fresh berry syrup) I loved it!  It didn't really remind me of pancakes, but did let my whole family sit down to eat at the same time (which pancakes never do).  Will make again!

So much better than regular pancakes.   It's more of a popover consistency than pancake.  My husband and I split one, but each of us could have eaten a whole one.  Top with pie filling or fresh berries.

We make this often with both bread flour and GF flour. 

I increase the flour and milk to 1 cup each due to the size of our skillet. 

Don't expect when using Gluten Free flour for the pancake to puff up but it is still delicious. We add chocolate chips on top after pouring the batter!

I added the butter to the pie pan while the oven was heating, so by the time it reached 425 the butter had browned. Followed the rest of the recipe (except no lemon and confectioners sugar, used maple syrup) and this was easy and devine. I would say makes 2 servings for adults. Mine also only needed to bake about 15 mins.

Absolutely Loved this. Added a tsp of vanilla and a dash of cinnamon but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I could have eaten the whole thing myself!  The combination of fresh lemon juice with the powdered sugar is soooooooo good.

Also called a Dutch Baby, which is made in a cast iron skillet (instead of a pie plate) and topped with a fried apples, cinnamon, brown sugar mixture  before it's put in the oven.  Yummy stuff!  And lighter than a regular pancake.

I make this in sweet and savory  versions.   For sweet, I omit the lemon juice and add vanilla.  I serve it with berry compote and lemon ricotta filling.  My kids love it!  For savory, I omit the sugar add salt (to taste), garlic powder,  dried thyme or italian herbs.   I also sprinkle cheese on top -cheddar, italian, etc.  My kids love it and call it breakfast pizza.   The puffed cake looks lovely too.

Made this exactly as written and it was delectable! I added both the powdered sugar and the lemon juice to the baked pancake. One note: it's best to bake this on the middle rack. I placed this on the top rack and the edges got a little bit overcooked. That's on me; this recipe is delicious!

Very tasty and easy. I ran out of eggs but had a carton of egg whites on hand. A 1/3 cup worked great and I couldn't taste the difference. You can also make this in a cast iron skillet or in ramekins for individual servings too.

This is not a tradition baked "pancake". I did not look at other pics before making, so it was a HUGE surprise when I pulled it out. I gave 5 stars because it is very tasty. I'm not sure it classifies as a pancake, but it has a lot of options to make into something extraordinary. Mine looked like a puff basket. I am very happy I did not add blueberries like I was planning.  But I will definitely make again.

Wasn't quite expecting the texture, I personally felt that it was more like a crepe yet my boyfriend said it was more like french toast. Regardless, this was a quick and easy recipe that was delicious with some cinnamon sugar and maple syrup!

I added vanilla to the eggs, and cinnamon and nutmeg to the dry ingredients. Then I had a bunch of fails: I realized I didn't have milk, so I put about a teaspoon of powdered milk in my measuring cup, added about a tablespoon of sour cream, and added water to the 1/2 cup mark  and mixed it up to make 'milk'.  Almost set my countertop oven on fire when melting the butter. When I stirred the batter, I missed some spots at the bottom and had chunks of dry flour go into the dish on top of the mixed batter. Spaced on the directions and baked at 450 instead of 425 - good thing I was watching it. It was done in 12 minutes. Even after all this - and this is why I usually don't make breakfast, because I'm not awake enough to do it safely or correctly first thing in the morning - it was Absolutely Delicious. I skipped the lemon and powdered sugar and ate it with pancake syrup. I think this recipe wins the 'most forgiving of all time' award - as well as being really really yummy -

Wow, what any east Sunday brunch.  Did up the sugar to one Tb. And added 1 tsp of baking powder as suggested in other review.  The closest thing I had to a 9 inch cast iron pan was a Le Creseut sauce pan. Really stuck to bottom but I got it out.

I have done this recipe many, many times.  I have been making the same recipe minus the lemon juice for 27 years.  We eat it differently however.  We chop up ham, bacon, onions and cheese to put on our savory baby.  If you read the ingredient list this is the same concept as bread.  Once freshly out of the oven we simply service ourselves with whatever savory topping(s) we wish. If we can have second( I always make two babies)  we then top with only sweet topping such as warm, maple infused sliced apple compote. Or hot cherry topping. Best of both worlds, sweet and savory.

I used eggnog flavored soy milk, added cinnamon and a small box raisins - yum! I did NOT add lemon. Powdered sugar is a must. My 5 yr old thought it tasted like bread pudding. This is a great breakfast to throw in the oven while getting kids up & running in the morning. Next time I will cut down on the butter. Just personal preference though.

Love the flavor!  Especially drizzled with lemon juice and confectioner sugar.  One change I'm going to try is to use less butter (2 tablespoons instead of 3).

I made this with 1/4 fat free Half & Half and 1/4 water.  It puffed up about 4 inches on the side.  Then I made a second whisking 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup water.  This time it barely puffed up, but still tasted great.  I sautéed 3 peeled sliced apples with 3 T butter, 1 teaspoon cinn, pinch cloves 1 tablespoon sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup.  Served over the top of the pancakes.

Just made this. This is possibly the best breakfast item I have ever encountered, in terms of difficulty-to-wow ratio. You throw everything together, wait 20 minutes, and everyone goes "wow." Had with honey today, but seems like a fruit spread would be good, too. Also, some kind of sausage or bacon would be a good partner.

These were amazing! I have made another oven pancake recipe and that one was more pancake like, fluffy and doughy, which is good but I also like this for it's unique lightness. I added bananas and powdered sugar for a sweet and (what I like to think is healthy) treat! :)

What a delightful, easy treat! I am low carb, so the only substitution I make is to use Carbquik and Splenda rather than regular flour and sugar. I think I will try adding sugar free flavorings next time ad see how that works just to change it up!

It was so good. I really like how easy it was too. I think next time I'll turn the oven down for the last 5-8 minutes. It was a little too brown instead of golden for me.

The flavor was great but mine stuck to the bottom of the pie plate.  Maybe I did something wrong?  I'll make it again, and just spray it with cooking spray.

I used gluten-free flour (brown rice, potato starch and tapioca flour mixed) and it still worked!! So great tasting a treat I don't even have to explain to guests it doesn't have wheat in it!

My family really liked this recipe. I didn't use the lemon or icing sugar because we had it with maple syrup, jam, yogurt, fruit, peanut butter, and many other toppings as we always do with pancakes.  The pancakes had a very nice eggy flavour and a soft spongy texture.  If I make them again, I might add a bit of vanilla flavouring.  The reason I only gave the recipe 4 out of 5 stars, is because it's not as healthy as I like our meals to be. I tried to counter-act this by adding fresh fruit.  I also think that the quantity of butter could be cut back considerably.  I adjusted the recipe for 8 servings instead of 2, but I only used about 1/2 of the recommended butter and even that seems a bit rich.

Just tried it and just ate 1/2 of it.  Used 2 T butter, and it still came out great!   After baking, on part of it I put Agave syrup and the other part with grated Romano...both flavors were yummy!

We loved this! So easy. I used 2 TBSP butter, added cinnamon, and served with smashed blackberries with vanilla on top. Definitely will make again. (I would post a pic but we ate it all up too quickly!)

Loved it, but I changed a few things. I used 2/3 cup of white flour and 1/2 of wheat flour, 3 eggs, a 1/2 teaspoon of Vanilla extract and for the kicker about 1 oz of Cream Cheese cut in small cubes and placed on top so it just sinks a little. After it cooked for 30 minutes I put a few drops of lemon powdered sugar and home made strawberry preserves. WOW was it great

The flavor and texture were wonderful!  More like French toast than pancake. I omitted the lemon juice and went for confectionary sugar and syrup.  I wasn't sure of the servings but for a hungry man, this would have made one serving. Mine stuck to the bottom of the pie pan but I will certainly make this again!

My husband and I both loved it!  I served it with blueberries that I heated up on the stovetop with a little sugar and lemon juice, making kind of a blueberry syrup.  We tried this with maple syrup also and that made the pancake taste like french toast.  I have seen these pancakes called Dutch Baby in restaurants, but never tried them. Thank you for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!

Tried this recipe when we had out-of-town company in for a wedding. Topped it with fresh strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and raspberries, drizzled with Orange Liquer (about 2 tablespoons) instead of the lemon juice then dusted on the powdered sugar. It was excellent! I did only use the 1 teaspoon of sugar but the fresh berries added just enough sweetness, in my opinion.

This sounds like the traditional Dutch Baby Pancake... even being served with the lemon and powdered sugar.  Appears to be an easier recipe than I have tried before... definitely going to try for breakfast tomorrow !!

This is a very old recipe caller Batter Pudding, it can also be made with fruit cooked in the batter, we used to love it made with slices of apple as kids. When prepared like this it does make the pudding a bit heavier but that's good on a cold winters day. It was lovely to see it shared on here.

This is really Yorkshire pudding. A bit of a variation but that's it. I did add vanilla, cinnamon, and nutmeg to eat as a sweet dessert type food. Very good. Will try the original lemon version for sure.

It is easy, I put sugar, milk , flour and eggs in a blender and makes it pouff a little more.  I have deleted the lemon and used cut up peaches with a little sugar to get it juicy or even strawberry's with sugar to do the same thing and they are all great.  I would bet you could cook up some sausage and add it to it and put a little maple syrup and make it even heartier.

We just like the texture...not sure about the funnel cake feeling.  If it does all the greater.  It one thing you can use as a base and let your imagination go wild.

I have it in the oven right now, but has anyone else noticed that this is VERY similar to a Yorkshire pudding... omit the sugar and use beef drippings instead of butter... and that's it!

Omg! Sitting here moaning..this is soooo good! I just used a wild blueberry/multigrain/oats pancake and waffle mix that I had opened a while ago and needed to be used...only used 1 egg for each pancake...used almond milk...delicioso!
Topped with your suggested lemon juice...added lemon peel..then topped with warmed peach pie filling and tad of lemon Greek yogurt...what a special treat on yet another snowy cold Ohio morning...sending this to many friends n family...thank you!

I had some apples that weren't very tasty so we made them into applesauce.  I didn't know what I was going to use it with, then saw this recipe today.  I tried it, and it came out just like the picture!  We ate it with the lemon and powdered sugar and with the applesauce.  Yummy!  I will try it with some bacon on the side when I get home from Africa! Oh, hubby is sensitive to milk, so I substituted soy milk, and it worked fine.  And if you were expecting it to taste like a griddle pancake, it won't.  It's not supposed to!

I really like the idea of reducing the sugar to one tsp. Like another reviewer, I bake at 400 for 17 mins.  If you have younger kids, make sure they're available to see it come out of the oven.  It looks like a chef's hat but deflates within a few minutes.  Just as tasty though!  My family loves it served with fresh raspberries or even canned peaches in a pinch.

Brown sugar instead of white. Top with warm cinnamon apples and whipping cream for an after dinner desert

It's simple, delicious and "pretty". I topped mine with a hint of fresh lemon juice, kiwi, blueberries and a drizzle of real maple syrup.  It's also very light!

This was very yummy, and super easy to make. I added mini chocolate chips after pouring the batter in the pan because my boys had requested chocolate chip pancakes. Only gave it four stars because it was very greasy. I would only use half the butter next time. It also browned too quickly so I will move the oven rack down.
