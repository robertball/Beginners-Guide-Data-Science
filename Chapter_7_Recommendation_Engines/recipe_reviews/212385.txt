the cheese was a great idea! I also added seasoned salt (instead of regular table salt), nutmeg, and a  dash each of cinnamon, all spice, and chili powder.  Awesome!

Made this tonight!  Got sooooo many compliments.  I added a little more flour, some basil and some oregano. Other then that, it was pretty much the same.  Our friends said they were the best latkes they ever had.  Even the kids ate them!  I will definitely make them again.

Would be better with less  salt. The cheese and soup mix are already salty. Deliciousness.

Really yummy! I tried another recipe with too much egg-to-potato ratio, but this was just right. I added some bacon crumbles to mine and substituted the dry onion soup for fresh, chopped onions. I also tossed some diced chives and bacon crumbles on top as a garnish. Absolutely delicious and really easy to make!

Very easy to make (with a food processor). Plain, simple recipe, plain simple latkes. The batter is a little liquidy, therefore the latkes come out thin, fyi. Big hit at my small party.
