Great basic recipe! If you want to make it lower carb and Atkins/keto friendly use real bacon, and double the amount, and omit the yogurt and substitute full fat cream cheese.  Thanks!

This is wonderful side! I admit that I do double everything except the cauliflower. Doing so makes the dish rich and creamy.

I used a whole head of cauliflower. Needed a bit more sour cream/yog I think to make it creamy. Delish

When I first took it out of the oven I thought it was too watery.  I put it in a bowl to let it cool, and when it was at a temperature I could eat it, it had thickened up and was the perfect consistency.

Tangy, creamy, cheese, bacon, awesome!

I don’t puree it in a food processor, I use a hand mixer to keep a little texture.  I also used Parmesan cheese & no yogurt.   I could eat this every day.   We’ve mixed up the cheeses too using pepper jack & Gouda .    Even added some avocado.   Experiment and figure out your signature flavor. ??

I don't really measure as I'm cooking, but I made this as the recipe stated -- AMAZING. SO much better than frozen mashed cauliflower and the family enjoyed them just as much as mashed potatoes. I had no guilt eating them, as they fit my keto diet -- winner!

I will definetly make this again.  Made it for Thansgiving and the whole extended family loved it: even though I used a little too strong a garlic, which overpowereed the cauliflower flavor a bit.  I used garlic kernels as we wanted to use it as a side vegetable.

I was absolutely in shock how good this was! I do not like cauliflower, and I loved it. I only had 2-16oz frozen pkgs of cauliflower but kept the recipe with the same measurements. I also only used greek yogurt to add additional protein instead of sour cream too. I will DEFINITELY make again

Very good and easy to make.  Just needed some salt and perhaps a little more creaminess.  Will try adding some cream cheese next time and some salt as well.

Oh. MY. GOD. 

This is by far one of my favorite keto recipes. I made this exactly like the recipe except i added a little butter (because keto) and WOW. Even the certified cauliflower haters in my house gobbled it up!!!

Making this now, adjusted seasoning to taste.  Used more cheddar and bacon then the recipe called for and a tad more of fresh chive.  It's in the oven now and looks and smells Devine.

Liked it, but did not feel it was worth all the ingredients & efforts for the end result.  Still love the old school cheese sauce over florets better!

I made this vegetarian (no bacon) so it probably lost some flavor but it was still pretty good.  I also made it up to the point of baking and stuck it in the refrigerator for a day until i was ready to cook it -- worked great.

A flavorful side dish that surprised me. I was thinking this would turn out a little bland but it delivered in the flavor department. No it won't replace creamy mashed potatoes but it will shine as a vegetable side dish.
