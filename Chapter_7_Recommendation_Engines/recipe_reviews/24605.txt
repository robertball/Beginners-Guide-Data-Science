Very good! I prevented my jalapenos from loosing the cheese by soaking toothpicks in water for 30 mins. & then used the toothpicks to keep the jalapeno casings together while frying. I also double breaded the jalapenos and added cajun seasoning to the flour/cornmeal mix instead of just salt.

The cornmeal is a little course, maybe maza (corn) flour would be better. I also ended up rolling them in the egg mixture a second time and then through the cornmeal again to get enough coating to stick. The cheese also came out of mine while they were frying and there was not much left inside. However, my boyfriend (born and raised in Jalisco, Mexico) liked them, as did his uncle and his brother, there were none left! We'll see if there's a requestin my house for MAS de los jalapenos fritos! (more friend jalapenos, for the non-spanish speakers ;)

Made as written and we liked these a lot. I actually like the grit of cornmeal so that was not an issue for me. If you don't like the grit then I recommend you substitute the cornmeal with  Masa. My peppers were small so I was unable to fit 16 ounces of cheese in them but other than that these worked great for me as written.
