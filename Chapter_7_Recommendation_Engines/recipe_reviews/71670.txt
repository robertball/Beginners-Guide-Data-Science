These felt so healthy to eat and I'm a huge fan of lettuce wraps. I think the Italian dressing was TOO much. Instead, next time I think i'll just do olive oil. The Feta cheese and the black beans were so good though!

This recipe was really good!  THe proportions of the recipe are WAY off though. There was not nearly enough rice, and I only needed 3 Tb. of the 1/3 cup Italian dressing. I put half of the feta in the rice and sprinkled the rest on top.  Great with lime juice squeezed on top!

Really good! Like everyone else, I adjusted the proportions to taste - 1 can beans, 1 1/2 cups rice, 1/4 cup dressing, and only about an ounce of feta.  I didn't have any chives, so I'll have to try those next time.  I think I'll be using lettuce wraps instead of tortillas from now on!

I loved this.  I halved the dressing, though.  It was still plenty!  Other than that I made no changes.  Thanks!

This is a delicious recipe, but I do agree with the other reviewers that the amounts in the recipe is off.  I would give it a 5, except that it seems we all need to do a little improvising with it.  I just sprinkled in the amount of feta that I liked, and I squirted in a few squirts of my dressing (mine was a balsamic vinegar/olive oil one).  You can probably use most any kind of salad dressing you have on hand.  It was awesome!  I will definitely use this again.

These were quite tasty, however the previous reviewer is right: the proportionas are off. I used 1/2 cup of beans, 1 c. rice, 2T greek dressing, and 1/4 c feta (basically 1 serving of each item). Very tasty, and a 1/3 c serving came out to @105 calories, so healthy too!
