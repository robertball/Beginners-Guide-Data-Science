Better than the chain restaurant! I sautéed onions & garlic with a small amount of butter before adding the rest of the ingredients to the pot, and turned out amazing!

Decided to make this for a very special Valentines Day fondue dinner and it was delicious! I made this exactly as instructed and then dipped slices of a prime filet and some medium sized shrimps. I think we've found an annual Valentines Day tradition.

For me the recipe was a good base, i adjusted it by adding some onion powder, salt,pepper, some beef base, and a little more red wine. It came out amazing.

We love Melting Pot’s coq au vin. Always go there for every special occasion. This year in our new mountain home, we wanted to do the fondue thing for New Year’s. Found this recipe and made it. Super easy and my hubby absolutely loved it. Thank you!

I made it for one of our fondue dinners. It was amazing and cooked a variety of meats and veggies with amazing flavor. My four year old loved the shrimp cooked this way he asked for it again two nights later!

Made for a delicious Valentine's Day treat for two. I cut the wine in half and used half chicken stock, half veggie stock. Like another reviewer, I needed to make some extra broth to refill the fondue pot. Thanks for the recipe!

I used a dry white Burgundy wine instead of red wine in the broth and marinaded the steak in ginger,  wine vinegar, sugar and garlic light soy, Worchester combination. Everyone raved!

Absolutely delicious! We were short on the green onion & actually forgot the wine and we didn’t even miss it! It cooked down quite a bit so we had to add about 4 more cups of chicken broth to our 3 qt Oster fondue pot to finish our meat course, but it was worth it! Will definitely make again!

Just due to icy weather, we had to use what we had on hand. Used beefy onion soup mix as broth base. Was really good!

The kids proclaimed the meat cooked in this broth to be the best they have ever eaten!  And it was very easy.

This had great flavor.  We left out the mushrooms as too many were not a fan.  We cooked steak, asparagus, cauliflower, fingerling potatoes and broccoli.  Will make this again.

This was great! My kids LOVE using the fondue pot for dinner and this is much healthier than using oil.  Just as good as going to the restaurant!
