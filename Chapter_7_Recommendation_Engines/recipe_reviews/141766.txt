Loved this pie!  I skipped the saucepan step and left out the honey and apple juice step altogether.  Instead, I added a heaping tablespoon of corn starch to 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup sugar then coated the sliced strawberries and bananas before adding to the pie shell.
Topped with the crumble and baked at 400 degrees for 20 minutes then reduced to 375 for 40 minutes.  Served this with some homemade whipped cream.  My husband and I LOVED it.  We'll be making this again and again.

Not impressed. First, I think the ratio of bananas to strawberries is off.  I recommend 1 fewer banana and another cup or two of strawberries. Second, the amount of topping this recipe calls for is astronomical!  You could decrease by two-thirds, and still have enough left over.  Third, it cooks up like strawberry-banana-soup. Don't try to eat this warm- you'll never be able to get a decent "slice" of "pie".  It fares much better served cold.  Fourth, because this recipe calls for so much topping, it's like eating a mouthfull of dust.  You need a half-glass of milk to wash down every bite. The topping isn't good at all.  Needs more nuts and much less flour and dry ingredients. The taste of the fruit, if you can taste it through all the crust and topping, isn't bad.  This might be served better with a whipped cream topping rather than the dust-topping this recipe calls for. I can't recommend this one.

This pie has a great flavor and slices more like a cobbler.  I had all the ingredients as staples so baked 2 on a whim

This recipe has mixed potential and is marginal at best. Choose to either use white sugar OR the apple juice and honey to sweeten, not both. Add corn starch to apple juice and honey to thicken. Reduce the 1 TB of both cinnamon and nutmeg to 1 tspn of each. Reduce 1 cup of flour to 1/2 cup.  Refrigerate or freeze to hold any sort of pie shape for cutting. As is this recipe is a fail. Tastes good and has potential but falls too short to publish.

Wow!!  Great pie all around.  I added a little lemon juice and sliced apple to the product before simmering.  Thanks for sharing K.

If I read MarieM's review before I made this pie as directed, it might have turned out...big flop! Stick to traditional fruit pie steps. I'm going to try MarieM's recipe next...which is nothing like this original recipe!

This turned out delicious but I had a little problem with cooking on the stove I did add cornstarch but it still seemed really soupy so I took a few tablespoons of juice out before soaking the pie crust which I prebaked just a little. It turned out fine and set up nicely. I used orange juice. Delicious!!

Made this pie because I had a lot of ripe bananas and strawberries.  Because of the amount of sauce, I needed to use 3 more bananas and another cup of strawberries.  Also thickened the sauce with 2 tablespoons of cornstarch.  Loved the flavor and the crumb topping.

I can't get enough of this pie! Great to make in the winter if you find a good batch of strawberries. Double the filling- you won't be sorry!
