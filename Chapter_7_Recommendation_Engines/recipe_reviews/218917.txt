I have a Cocoa Latte machine that I used especially for this recipe to froth up my milk. I do NOT have almond milk--I added a teaspoon of almond extract PER cup of milk. I thought this was okay, my husband didn't care for it. He added a boatload of sugar to his before he drank it. I don't think I'd make this again.

I have been making this almost everyday. Ever since Starbucks came out with the Instant VIA. Love it because it so quick to make.  I use the unsweetened almond milk so I can control the amount of sweetness.  I don't bother with the blender. It is even better with Chocolate Almond Milk for a Mocha version, but the unsweetened chocolate version is harder for me  to find.

yummy quick latte. I used starbucks via and microwaved some unsweetented almond milk then after tasting added a little agave to sweeten it up.

This really had no flavor. I had some unsweetened vanilla flavored almond milk. I followed the recipe exactly just cut it in half for one serving. I finally decided to add a packet of Splenda as it badly needed sweetener. I figured the problem was my almond milk was unsweetened. I also tried to doctor it up in other ways, to avoid wasting 1 cup of almond milk. Overall, just boring.
