Not bad, but I'm going to keep looking for a better receipe.  I found that there wasn't enough of the marinade to put aside after separating from the chicken.

I made my own ginger garlic paste, by combining chopped garlic with a piece of ginger root in a blender, along with some olive oil. I served the chicken over rice.

Me and my boyfriend liked this. I made slight adjustments but not too much. I didn't have chilli sauce, so for that I added red pepper and jalapenos, then a little paprika for seasoning, like the other recipe. This was really good!
