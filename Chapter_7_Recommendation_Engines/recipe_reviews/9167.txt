I tweaked the recipe a bit to personalize it, but overall it was delicious.  I recommend using a mandolin to get your onion as thin as possible, as the thinness was key to how much flavour was mingled with the orange.

I added black grapes for the colour instead of black olives (a matter of personal preference), and it looked very appetising and cheerful. The  taste is tangy and intriguing.

This is a favorite fall dish. Use fresh oregano if possible - much better than dried in this dish. Slice the onions very thin. I omit the chives, but salt and pepper lightly. Use a good olive oil and red wine vinegar. very refreshing!

This was a very tasty salad, with a unique flavor combination. I added some thinly sliced red bell peppers and because I thought the flavors would mesh nicely.
