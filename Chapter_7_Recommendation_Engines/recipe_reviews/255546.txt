I always cook my garlic and onions first for five minutes before adding the ground turkey. Also, omit the water and turn the heat down to low after adding the chilis and tomato sauce. The mixture will thicken and you will cut half your simmering time.

I substituted 6 oz tomato paste and an empty can of water instead of the tomato sauce and 8 oz water and it made all the difference.  So tasty and a nice thick consistency for less messy and more flavorful tacos! MontereyJack cheese is great with the turkey too.

Great tasting tacos. You won't miss the fat. I added a tbsp of cornstarch because it never thickened and I needed to use corn taco shells. Thank you for the recipe.

Subbed  salsa for the tomato's for hubby's sake and these were good! The only reason I am giving this a 4 star instead of a 5 is because the sauce didn't thicken enough to call this a taco. It was a burrito but a fine burrito at that. Thanks for sharing!

Why use flour tortillas when corn tastes ever so much better? Flour ones always taste like raw flour.

I have to agree with everyone else, this doesn't get thick enough. But I add only 1/8 cup of water to it and let it cook down.  The flavors come together nicely if you just let it simmer a little longer.  We always use turkey in place of beef for all our so called beef dishes. Most people don't even notice it's turkey.  A big plus and I think it's healthier.

These tacos are great. I have already been making tacos with ground turkey for a couple years. The ground turkey has a lot less grease and when cooked in the taco seasoning, just melts in your mouth. It is so delicious. Cilantro gives it a nice kick. You could probably add some lime to it also to change up the flavor if you want to.

Loved it but I added Adobo Sauce Chipotle Peppers and cut off the stems for heat. I prefer spicy, I also added avadaco as a topping.  If your counting calories like I'm am to lose weight this meal is a fine alternative to going out to eat. Also I made taco seasoning instead of buying it so I can adjust the salt. So far I lost 25 pounds in 2 months instead of going out to eat like I normally would with Mexican food.

This was good!  Made as directed and simmered down nicely. Added diced jalapeños instead of diced chili’s. Packed just enough heat. Would make these again.

Hi all, this is my recipe. I noticed that there are some questions, so I have some answers. 
First of all, I would NEVER use flour tortillas for tacos . Please use corn tortillas, secondly, I allow my meat to simmer on medium low heat for about 30 minutes after I pour in the tomato sauce and water, and lastly, I like to use the yellow can of el pato tomato sauce, it gives this recipe quite a kick.
Hope this helps with some of the confusion.

This was delicious! I goofed and didn't have tomato sauce, so I used a can of diced tomatoes instead. It was like regular tacos with a boost.

Maybe it was the turkey but I also didn't like the tomato sauce. Just a very strong gamey flavor. Just not for me.

Awesome recipe. Made it the first 2 time as written, 3rd time I omitted the green chiles (boyfriend's preference) and used chicken broth instead of water. Turned out great!

Yummy.  We are not ground turkey fans, but when I accidentally bought ground turkey breast, we tried these.  We liked them enough that this will be our go-to recipe for chicken or turkey.

I followed the whole recipe except for the water, I left that out because it just sounded like it would make it to soupy. The flavors mixed in the turkey were perfect. Great dish!

It went over very well at my girlfriends get together. Although I must confess, I changed the beef for a mixture of Free range turkey and turkey sausage. Yum!

I only had a 16oz can of tomato sauce so I just didn't add the water. It still was way to soupy for a taco even after letting it simmer.  Also I didn't care for the flavor. I would have rather used just the packaged mix. This washed out the flavor of the mix.

We really loved this.  We did change out and used corn tacos as my family likes them so much more.  Will be making this many times.

This was delicious!  It deserves more than 5 stars. 
I made it exactly according to the directions with a few exceptions. We don't like onions, so I left this out. I used regular corn taco shells. Added sour cream to top....WOW!
