My dad showed me how to make this recipe.  It is really good you should try dipping the shrimp in melted butter mixed with garlic powder before wrapping in bacon.

Try cooking the bacon a little before wrapping around the shrimp.  This way you can be sure the bacon is fully cooked when the shrimp are done.

YUMMY!!  I precooked the bacon in the microwave. I cut the strips in half and wrapped them around the shrimp, securing the bacon with a toothpick. Cooking them was a bit tricky. I had the shrimp in a throw away foil pan on the grill with loads of butter and garlic powder. I let the shrimp cook a bit in the pan then put them on the grill for a few minutes. I had to be careful that the shrimp was cooked through under the bacon, but didn't want them to over cook. It is a dish you need time to focus on.

It is imperative that you partially cook the bacon before wrapping the shrimp to cook.  The bacon will not be done.  If you cook the bacon until done, the shrimp are WAY over cooked.  I sprinkled my favorite seasonings over the shrimp before I wrapped and grilled them then served them with melted butter.  I gave this only 3 stars because the recipe as written, as I stated, over cooks the shrimp.  I used jumbo shrimp and they were large enough for a whole strip of partially cooked bacon.  When the shrimp were done, the bacon was grilled to perfection.

Absolutely awesome appetizer! I served these for New Years' Eve, and everyone loved them!  I chose to cook them under the broiler in my oven instead of grilling.  To prevent burning the bacon or drying out the shrimps, I placed them as far below the broiler as the oven would allow.  This allowed the bacon to cook thoroughly...I turned them a couple of times, too.  Wonderful!  I can't wait to make them again.

I did not read the reviews before trying this out. In hindsight, yes, I think if the bacon was precooked a bit, it might be nice (I hate rubbery bacon, ew)
But, I did cook it according to the directions, and if you use a thin-sliced bacon, on a hot grill, it did turn out wonderful and they were all gobbled up at my barbeque. ALSO- I did not use full slices of bacon, I cut them in half! But make sure they fit around the size of shrimp you use before cutting them all, you don't want to cut them too short and waste with the bacon not fitting! Very popular and I will definitely make again! I also tossed the shrimp with some terriaki sauce and marinaded 1/2 hour beforehand.

I thought that the bacon overpowered the shrimp. we used larger shrimp, and the bacon was not done when the shrimp were.

It's important that you partially pre-cook the bacon before grilling.  Very tasty and easy to make, but next time I think I'll marinate the shrimp in a lemon/tequila mixture first for a little added flavor.

Great idea, but the bacon needs to be slow cooked until edible (but flexible) before wrapping the shrimp or else the shrimp will overcook.

Sometimes the most simpliest things are the best! Shrimp and bacon are one of my family's favorite things to eat so I knew this combination would be a hit with them. I just partially cook the entire package of bacon slices in the oven using, "Bacon for a Family or a Crowd," from this website. I then cut them into 1/3's and used it to wrap around the shrimp securing them with toothpicks. Cooking them in the oven was a breeze since shrimp cooks fast. After the first couple of minutes, I turned it over to cook the other side for another 3 minutes until it was done. Since I did not want a tough or rubbery shrimp, I took it out as soon as I saw the shrimp turn pink/orange in color indicating to me that it was cooked. Bacon already has so much flavor and so it adds a lot of natural seasoning to the shrimp while it bakes in the oven. I didn't even have to ask anyone if they liked the shrimp because they were all gone in a matter of seconds! I served this with, "Green Rice III," and "Carrots in Dill Butter," all from this website.

I just made this.  I used pre-cooked jumbo shrimp and pre-cooked oscar meyer bacon.  I melted a stick of butter, and dipped the shrimp in the butter before wrapping with an entire piece of bacon. I then placed them on a tinfoil lined baking sheet, and baked at 375 for about 6 minutes. Very good!

Fantastic!  I broiled the bacon on LO for exactly 3.5 minutes until the edges just started to curl.  Then, after wrapping the shrimp with the bacon and basting on bbq sauce, I grilled them on one of those nifty flat thingies with the holes that goes on the grill (I believe that's the technical term: nifty flat thingies with the holes).  I made 100 for a birthday party.  They were gone in 5 minutes.

Wow these turned out amazing for a recent BBQ, all 60 were gone in minutes!  I had about 50-60 cocktail shrimp thawed out.  After reading other reviews I bought 2 packages pre-cooked bacon (30 slices) as opposed to uncooked.  I sprinkled some McCormick's Montreal Steak seasoning (the best) on the shrimp before wrapping.  Cooked on the grill for 2-3 minutes on each side and voila, delicious!   P.S. - A friend told me that if you wet the toothpicks with water beforehand they won't burn on the grill.

Heart-Healthy Recipe: I made this tonight with the recommendation of using garlic and butter to season the shrimp, but I did substitute the butter with 3 T. Smart Balance melted with 1 t. garlic powder for 40 large shrimp. This was a great ratio. Also I substituted low fat turkey bacon for the bacon, and as many mentioned, I did cook the bacon slightly. But seeing as how, turkey bacon crisps quickly, I made sure not to fully cook it before wrapping the shrimp. Keep it soft and mailable so as to wrap the shrimp. Then I cooked the bacon-wrapped shrimp on my George Forman, at 400 degrees for five minutes. They were delicious and perfect, not chewy or rubbery. Even my picky four-year old loved them! With these changes, these are healthy enough to eat as the main protein.

I made some of these the other day, and thought they were ok, but needed a little something more, so I took some small jalapeno slices, and put those in the middle of the shrimp, THEN wrapped the bacon, and sprinkled w/ Cavendar's seasoning.  I also did mine in the oven b/c we were out of propane, and we thought they were much better w/ the alterations.

For an extra kick, try butterflying the shrimp & stuffing it with a piece of jalapeno pepper & a piece of monterey jack cheese then wrap it with the bacon.Very tasty!

I used the precooked bacon available, and they turned out perfectly.  Just keep a close eye on them so they don't burn, don't take long to cook.

tried this recipes with modification and it was AWESOME! I used the large "prawn" shrimp and in the curve of the shrimp I placed a chunk of pineapple, then wrapped thin sliced bacon around and placed on skewer. The pineapple added flavor to the shrimp and provided a little moisture to keep the bacon and shrimp from drying out to fast. Tonight I am attempting to stuff shrimp with a cream cheese and then wrapping in bacon... will let you all know how that turns out!

As written the recipe is a little lacking. I marinated the shrimp along the lines of the Grilled Marinated Shrimp recipe on this site (seasoning salt, oregano, lemon juice, olive oil, etc.), then I used very thin bacon and cut that in half. I placed these on a baking sheet and sprinkled a little bit of light brown sugar over the top and broiled. Hubby loved these! If the bacon was thicker I would have had to pre-cook it. This is a great recipe to tinker with. Thanks for the post!

This is a great recipe.  For an extra zing try cutting the back of the shrimp and inserting some horseradish.  Then wrap in bacon and cook in garlic butter on the grill in aluminum pie plate.
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I microwaved the bacon, then I combined the drippings from the bacon with butter & garlic. I used it to baste the bacon wrapped shrimp while it cooked on the grill. I also seasoned the shrimp with seasoning salt. It came out great !

If I don't have time to marinate shrimp, this is the next best thing!  Tip: cut bacon slices in half, trim the excess fat, then wrap each shrimp in a half slice of bacon (this will help you get crispier bacon without having to precook it).  Also, we always brush the shrimp with barbeque sauce (Sweet Baby Ray's) while they are on the grill.  Gives them just a hint of something special!

Try proscuitto! However, if you use bacon, cook it until the fat is rendered before wrapping the shrimp. This recipe does not work as written. Read and heed the comments!

So simple and yummy.  I added a half leaf of fresh basil to every shrimp before wrapping with partially cooked bacon.  I had an 80 year old man tell me it was the best shrimp he has ever tasted!!

I use thinner bacon and stretched it a bit so I never had a problem with the shrimp being overdone. Also I spread a little horseradish on the bacon before wrapping it for a little kick. Instead of toothpicks I used scewers so to turn all at once. When almost done brush a little Bulls Eye BBQ Sauce on. Tastes awesome.

We make this all the time, never had to precook the bacon. My boyfriend likes to boil the shrimp until it's pink, but I think it would be better not to. Anyway wonderful flavor!!

Delicious and easy.  I prepared this with COLOSSAL SIZE SHRIMP, WRAPPED BACON TWICE around each shrimp, and GRILLED UNTIL BACON WAS DONE (FLIP 2-4 times).  I served with side of lemon wedges and a side of cocktail sauce Everyone loved them.  
(The colossal shrimp are not cheap but they're HUGE, I buy them on sale).

These were definitely a hit at our house.  I used medium sized raw shrimp and raw bacon...cut each slice of bacon in half.  Had no problem with the bacon cooking up...it was perfect.  I also sprinkled them with some garlic powder and brushed both sides with some BBQ sauce before grilling.  Excellent!

Another delicious bacon wrapped appetizer! I used raw shrimps and raw bacon and I didn't have any problem with cooking them. I just added a sprinkle of brown sugar beacause it was a tad bit too salty for my tastes.

After experimenting our favorite method is raw peeled & deveined shrimp with 1/2 a strip of bacon  on toothpicks, grilled or broiled in the oven until the bacon is done.  Do monitor them closely to prevent charred bacon.  Then brush on Famous Dave's Rich & Sassy BBQ and finish off with one more minute on the grill to cook the sauce onto the bacon.  Your guests will never guess it's bbq sauce.

My two favorite foods. I'm glad I read the reviews for this and precooked the bacon. next time I'll try it with the bacon you can buy premade in the store.

Good stuff.  I did marinate the shrimp in a garlic basil butter and then wrap the shrimp.  I also partically cooked the bacon.  (Good thing because it was barely done when the shrimp was cooked.) You don't want to overcook shrimp because it becomes rubbery.  Thanks for the recipe idea.

I used frozen pre-cooked jumbo shrimp and thick bacon.  To compensate for the difference in cook time, I cooked the bacon in the microwave until it was almost difficult to wrap around a shrimp.  Then I grilled them for around 6 minutes or so, flipping them a few times.  A few of them caught on fire, but it was fine.  Turned out yummy!

My son asked me to make shrimp wrapped with bacon for his birthday dinner last week, so I started looking for recipes.  This one caught my eye because they're cooked on the grill rather than in the broiler.  They were delicious!  I rated them 4 stars instead of 5 though because I added a sauce that sent them over the top.  And to be honest, I think they may have been a little bland on their own.  I used jumbo shrimp and wrapped them in 1/2 strip of bacon.  Did not pre-cook bacon and had no problem with bacon not cooking enough or shrimp being over cooked.  Right before we removed them from grill, we put them on a grill griddle and poured a sauce of 1 part barbecue sauce to 1 part maple syrup.  We basically just left them on the grill long enough to heat up the sauce and removed them to a serving plate. Wow!!!!  I used 2 lbs. of shrimp and 1 lb. of bacon to feed 4 (we had side dishes too).

Hubby brought up a good one . . . (rare I know - LOL) perhaps this recipe calls for RAW shrimp?   Then cooking with raw bacon might work . . . time wise that is . . . we used pre-cooked shrimp and did pre-cook the bacon before wrapping - will try dipping in a garlic sauce next time to become more flavorful

Great recipe.  The only thing I do differently is marinate the shrimp in italian dressing before you wrap them with bacon.  I cook them on the George Foreman grill and if you get it hot before you put them on - it only takes about 3 or 4 minutes for these to be done.  This is one of my favorite meals and a favorite of the family too!!

very good:) We eat turkey bacon so that's what I used and I put them on skewers so I didn't have to worry about them falling through the grill and they were easy to flip! Will definitely be making these often!

We make these a lot in the summer and use pre-cooked bacon, cut in half.  We also brush bar-b-que sauce on the shrimp as they are being grilled.  These are a favorite appetizer and many times, we serve them as an entree.

Excellent.  Try preparing the night before, adding a sliver of jalepeno (seeds removed) and put in caserole dish.  Put brown sugar generously on both sides of the shrimp, then place in refrigerator overnight.  In the morning, flip skewers to ensure the liquid sugar gets on both sides.  Cook over grill like instructed.  Not overly healthy, but incredibly tasty

These were ok, i really should have read the reviews, the bacon needs to be cooked some before or it'll take forever on the grill and it'll still have a lot of fat on it.

I pre-marinated my shrimp in a simple mixture of black pepper and cayenne pepper, then wrapped them (but I did not use whole bacon strips, only half strip per shrimp) and grilled on my George Foreman. They turned out delicious! I dipped in a mixture of ketchup, honey and pepper sauce and served with fried rice. Next time I'm going to just eat these as an appetizer because they were so good I almost forgot about the rice! Thanks for an absolutely delicious recipe.

this is a good recipe. I would def. say to cook the bacon a little before hand or buy thin sliced. i usually buy thin sliced and wrap only enough around to cover a large shrimp, somewhere around 1/3 to 1/2 of a piece. i usually wrap it like a burrito though it holds moisture in better on the shrimp. also when they are almost done, i love putting a honey brown sugar bar b que sauce on them, they are so great!

Very good!  I cut the bacon slices in half and precooked them til the fat rendered.  I marinated the shrimp in Italian dressing, and then brushed it with a light coating of bbq sauce before wrapping the bacon around it.  I cooked it on my cast iron stove-top grill.  Hubby & the kids loved it!

Very flavorful.  I did marinate my shrimp in bbq sauce with a sprinkle of brown sugar, for about 2 hrs prior to grilling.  I used 1/2 slice of bacon per shrimp.  I used raw shrimp and raw bacon and didnt have problems with the bacon not cooking.  The shrimp was done when the bacon was crisp.  I basted with more bbq sauce and it was so good!

This is great last minute recipe. I have never had the problem about pre-cooking the bacon and I use a whole slice... Also I just put a dash of Cajun seasoning on as I go along. A wonderful side dish or appetizer!

Simple and easy.  Will make again.  The shrimp underneath could use a little bit of seasoning though before wrapping in bacon.  Perhaps some lemon butter or just a little bit of pepper or something.

I made this for our Superbowl party.  I marinated the shrimp in store bought teriyaki sauce for about half an hour before wrapping the shrimp around it.  It was delicious and a batch of 40 shrimp was devoured in about 5 minutes.

Oh my gosh, I will never order grilled shrimp from out again because these turned out awesome!!!  They took much longer to cook then the recipe stated, but when the bacon was done the shrimp was done too.  Oh yeah, make sure you watch them because the bacon grease will easily catch fire.

My husband loved these!  Although I did change it a little thus the 4 starts.  I tossed the shrimp in a mixture of my husbands favorite seasoning salt and a little olive oil and let marinate for a couple of hours before wrapping in bacon and baking.  I made these as his special treat at Christmas and he and the rest of the family are still talking about them in June!

After reading several recipes I went with this one because it was simple and didn't have all the ridiculous ingredients of the others,I believe if you have to 'kill' good food with hot sauce and stuff that hides the taste of the food then why bother... bacon is flavor enough.We had lg. shrimp (13-15 per lb.). So for 12 we used 6 slices of bacon -thick (yes thick) ,did not precook like some suggested,you want the bacon grease to flavor the food.I dried the shrimp /w/ paper towels then wrapped 4 to a skewer with the bacon.Hubby grilled them over a Catclaw fire high at 1st to crisp the bacon then low and slow on the cooler 'coals' for about 15-20 min. They were crispy,the shrimp were perfect,not rubbery...wonderful.Keep it simple and enjoy your food.Thank you for the recipe post!!

Partially cooking the bacon before skewering the shrimp is the key.  My husband whipped up a quick remoulade sauce to dip them in.

It was just ok. But to me it’s not a really flavorful recipe. I hunk it needs a glaze.

My son made this and used his own rendition which included jalapeno and onion slices between the bacon wrapped shrimp on skewers. All of us loved it!!

Great recipe!  Definitely parcook the bacon.  I miscounted my shrimp and wrapped about six in completely uncooked bacon and the difference is very noticeable (between those and the shrimp wrapped in parcooked bacon). And another reviewer's idea of dunking the shrimp in butter and garlic first?  Winner!!

Try soaking your shrimp in Apricot jelly in a ziplock baggy overnight, or for a few hours, then wrap and grill! Its my favorite summer appitizer, or serve the salad.
