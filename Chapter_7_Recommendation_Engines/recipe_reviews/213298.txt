Perfect Side Dish. Very fast and simple, yet really good. I doubled the veggies and used 1 can of FF Cream of Celery and 1 can of regular with 1 cup of milk and pepper to taste. Also, uncovered for the last few minutes to thicken the sauce a little. Everyone enjoyed this and we will make it again.

Made this last night for dinner.  Easy and pretty good.  I think I will add some cut up chicken to the left overs and make it our lunch today..

Delicious. I used a home made condensed cream soup recipe from this site which isn't necessarily low fat, and 1% milk. Creamy and very tasty. Quick and easy as well.

This was very good and couldn't be easier to make. I used frozen veggies and topped with a bit of stuffing mix to give it a little crunch. Entire family enjoyed it.

So easy, so yummy!  I used regular Cream of Celery soup instead of 98% fat free as per the recipe and it turned out great.  My husband loved it too!!

This was not very good at all. This would of been better in a cheese sauce.

Made it with frozen vegetables and didn't taste great. Probably would be better with fresh veggies, so I'll give it more stars than my attempt warranted.
