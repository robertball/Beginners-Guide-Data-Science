I really enjoyed this. I subbed almond milk for the soy milk, and a handful of almonds in place of the flax seed meal. Other than those adjustments, I followed the recipe. Super yummy and filling. Will make again. Saved to my recipe box! Thanks.

I love this smoothie. The 2nd time I used half cup skim milk; half cup vanilla Greek yogurt; whole banana; and added 1 tablespoon chia seeds plus 1/4 cup oatmeal.

Tasted ok and I’m sure it’s healthy but the carrots or flax or something in there made it grainy instead of smooth!
