Today I tried my first recipe from this site. Kudos to Jessica Dezendorf (or perhaps her husband). Quick, easy and tasty.

I haven't made many French Onion soups and it has been a very long time since I did but I have no complaints. I did sub the margarine for unsalted butter because I haven't bought margarine in years. Next time I will add another onion and probably skip the cheese on the bottom of the bowl due to personal preference. All in all very easy to make and great flavor.

I lost my recipe that I normally use to make homemade french onion soup and ran across this one. Sooo glad that I did. It was perfect! If you use everything that's in the recipe, it's perfect flavoring. Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper for sure!

I have always felt intimidated by french onion soup recipes. Not anymore! This was great and super easy to make. I didnt put the bread on the bottom of the bowls because the bread floats to the top anyway.

Best French Onion Soup I have had. Very good, not too salty. I used fat free beef broth and added half a teaspoon of thyme, we also used croutons instead of french bread, delicious...Thanks!

JACKPOT! SIMPLY DELICIOUS!!! I am swooning over the broth right now and impatiently waiting for the next 45 minutes to pass so that I can PIG OUT!!! I know it's going to be sooooo awesome!!! the flavors are perfect and they will just deepen and get richer and when I put on croutons and some provolone cheese...HEAVENLY!!! I could not for the life of me get some beef consomme in stock at the 3 grocery stores I went to so I finally made the decision to put my brain to good use and figure out an alternative...just use more beef broth or...AU JUS GRAVY MIX!!! Yes! I bought 2 of the store brand of Au Jus Gravy Mix that makes 2 cups of Au Jus each. Just added it according to package directions with the other ingredients (minus the water)and lots of pepper! Also I had to add 2 more onions. One just didn't seem right. I TELL YOU THIS STUFF IS GONNA ROCK MY FREEZING COLD MN SOCKS OFF AND I CAN'T WAIT!!!!! Thank you hubby for your oh-so-humble recipe!!!

This was a very bland version..add a package of French's powdered onion gravy mix, 1/2 tsp paprika, salt and pepper, and 2 minced cloves of garlic, it really brought out the "French Onion Soup" flavours!!
Enjoy :)

I am HUGE fan of french onion soup, and this recipe is spot on! 
Didn't change a thing other than no cheese on the bottom. So good! it's a big hit at home!

Very awesome recipe! I used red wine as I didn't have white. Instead of 1 onion, I sliced 5 and 1 red onion. If you don't have french bread, croutons are a great substitute.

I made this for dinner tonight...so yummy! I added more onions and a few sprigs of Rosemary while it was simmering and then removed them. The Rosemary added a really nice flavor. I topped mine with fresh mozzarella. Huge hit! Definitely going in my recipe box. Thank you for the great recipe!
