This recipe by Moira is actually my mom!! Hi mom!! Of course we are an italian family and my mom can obviously cook like no other but I am not a fan of cooking, however this year we were not going to be together so I decided I was going to cook my first turkey ever and I used this recipe. IT WAS AMAZAING!!! I followed the instructions exactly as my mom instructed and it came out so tender, so perfectly cooked! I am going to make this turkey again on Christmas day!! THE BEST TURKEY EVER!

Excellent, excellent, excellent and very easy to prepare.  I made a gravy with the drippings and it certainly needed salt (was pretty sweet).  Wouldn't change a thing!

The Glaze is amazing.  I made this for Christmas dinner, but did not have a full cup of honey.  I improvised and added light karo syrup to get the full cup.  I was really happy with that add, as it was not a strong over-powering taste that you can get when cooking with straight honey.  I also used fresh basil from my garden.  The glaze was so flavorful that I also brushed it on the tops of my homemade rolls.  They gave a whole new flavor to sticky buns!  I am sure you will enjoy this recipie as much as we did!

This is a great recipe. My family loved it. I followed the suggestions of some others and used half honey, half karo. (I am not a real big honey fan.) It was great! The gravy was fabulous. I used the juices, thickened with flour mixed into a little cream before adding to juice. Flavored with a little balsamic, Emeril's essence, garlic powder, salt, pepper. My son doesn't eat gravy, but he loved this one. Thanks MOIRA.

I made this for Thanksgiving last year and everyone loved it!  I was afraid it would be too sweet or taste too much like honey but all of the flavors blended perfectly!

I made gravy using some drippings and the "savory turkey gravy" recipe and everyone wanted to take leftovers home!

Let me start by saying I do not like turkey on Thanksgiving.  I may eat two small pieces but I have never been a big fan.  All that changed when I made this recipe.  I have never tasted a better turkey and will make this every year and would cry if I ever lost the recipe.  YES, it is that good!

This is funny but I only had light Karo syrup and molasses so I used the syrup and 1 Tbsp molasses.  This was the best turkey I've ever made.  Definately use again either by the recipe or just like I had to.  Thanks so much!!

Very moist and flavorful turkey.  I used a cooking bag and altered the time as follows: only one hour instead of two before adding the honey, then add the honey mixture and cook until done, roughly 2 1/2 hours.  I also opened the bag only once to baste the turkey after I put the honey mixture on.

I didn't have any sage, so I substituted oregano.  I was a little worried about the seasonings being so strong, but the flavor was not over-powering at all.  Even my boyfriend, who dislikes heavily-seasoned food, loved it.  Thank you for this recipe.  I will definitely make this again!

I just started taking over Thanksgiving dinners for the last few yrs.- & since then have tried a different recipe every year, looking for that special one to make mine. I'm certain I found it this yr., especially after hearing my son say "Mom, this is the one!" AND there were absolutely no left overs! It was the most delicious turkey I had ever tasted-  juicy inside, light & mildly crispy outside! Even my Mom said it was the best! The only thing I added was a stick of sweet butter, rubbed under the skin- that's it. After all my research on cooking turkeys, I kept on reading that placing butter under the skin would assist in creating a juicy bird. Well it definitely did and this is definitely a keeper!!

This was very good!  All of the ingredients are on hand already...I did, however, also inject my turkey with Texas Butter (spicier butter) and then after 2 hours of the turkey roasting I basted it about 4 times.  The turkey was incredibly moist.  Key point, I think, is to make sure that you pat the turkey dry and then to really rub it down with olive oil as the first step.

This was delicious.  We used this on a roaster chicken with the skin removed and it was great.  Very sweet and the meat was so flavor all over.  I mixed up the herbs a little too.  I will be making this one again!

I just made this and it was a huge hit! The word "phenomenal" was thrown around quite a bit. My modifications: I put butter under the skin before roasting and used 3/4 C honey and 1/4 C maple syrup.

This recipe was very easy to follow for a Raw Turkey Virgin and it came out great. i will bake my next turkey at a higher temp b/c it took longer to cook then what was suggested, but that is b/c of my oven, I think.  It was very yummy! and everyone liked it too!

I have never added anything to my turkey except salt & pepper when roasting.  Thought I would give this a try for something different.  I liked it!  Made exactly as written, except used a 7 lb. bone in turkey breast.  Cut the seasonings in half and it worked out perfect.  Browned nicely and stayed super moist.

Awesome! Took the advice of some others and used half honey and half karo syrup, and it was perfect. Loved the gravy flavor made with the drippings. My husband didn't like the sweetness of it, but I thought it was by far the best tukey and gravy I have ever had!

Excellent! I wanted something other than plain old Thanksgiving Turkey, and this recipe gave the punch it needed. A hint of sweet, very savory with the spices. Made gravy with drippings...fabulous! Love it. This is my Turkey recipe from here on out.

This recipe was excellent. I will definitely make my turkey this way in the future! The only thing I did different was to add 1/2 tsp of sage to the rub mixture.

Amazing!!! Will never make it the "traditional" way again.  Made this the first time I cooked for my mother in law, was very nervous as she is an amazing cook. It blew her socks off as well as everyone else. Delicious, slightly sweet, very juicy and tender.

I've tried several over the years; injection, rubs, lemon slices under the skin and several others.  This has got to be one of the best "treatments" I've done.  I also brined the turkey with the "Incredible Turkey Brine Recipe" also found on Allrecipes.com.  
This was one of the best turkeys I've ever prepared in over 30+ years.

I made this for my family, and we all agree this is the best turkey ever! I only cook the Turkey Breast and make adjustments accordingly. No more dry turkey for me EVER!

I mixed the 1st four ingredients and sealed the bird for 20 min on 475* and then cooked as suggested.  Ran out of honey and subbed with maple syrup.  Really, really good!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was very simple. First time making a turkey and the family absolutely loved it!! Turkey was not dry at all and I love the flavors. I took an extra step and stuffed it with fruit and it complimented this recipe!!!! LOVE IT!!

I used this receipe on a 6 lb. turkey breast with bone in for Thanksgiving and just modified the recipe for the weight and it turned out absolutely amazing. The flavors are so wonderful and complex and it's so easy, I'll use this recipe from now on every year!!

Keep in mind that you do need to continuously baste the turkey but it is well worth it!

Just delicious, but it has a wrong title. It should be called Honey Glazed Turkey, because the honey is the star of this recipe. Turkey was a beautiful color and the gravy was excellent.

I made this today.  It was my first time ever making a Turkey.  I followed the recipe to a T.  I love honey so I didn't substitute, although I had a bottle of honey from a large chain store and I had one from a local farmer.  The local one taste so much better so I used that one.  My husband said it was the best juiciest sweetest turkey he has ever had.  He used the drippings for gravy and it made the best gravy ever.  Looks like we have a recipe for every Thanksgiving.  It was amazing (and I don't even like turkey :) )  I couldn't get enough.

I made this last year for Thanksgiving and it was the best turkey I've ever had. So much flavor from the spices and the addition of honey made it mouth watering. After our feast I took the leftovers and used them to make a turkey stock and soup which was incredible all thanks to how well the turkey was prepared with this recipe.

I Had a turkey to cook and searched for recipes and came across this one.  After reading reviews decided to give it a shot. It came out wonderful.  Best turkey I have ever made. Very moist, not to sweet, and a very easy to follow recipe.  My kids loved Too.  Definately recommend trying it.   I will be using it for my future turkey cookings as well :) thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

This recipe was AMAZING!!!  Turkey was moist, even on Sunday for leftovers!  Best turkey glaze I have ever used.  Seals in moisture without being sweet. I cooked a 26 lb turkey @ 325 degrees for 7.5 hours. It's a new tradition in our family! AWESOME!!!!

This is one of the best turkeys I have had in a very long time. The only thing I added was some turky stock in the roasting pan and a lemon and orange in the cavaity while roasting.  It turned out so well I was highly impressed. Will use this recipe next year, and the years after that...it's a keeper!

Tried this recipe roughly 2 years ago or at least one very similar and plan to try it again this year. Took me hours of scouring the internet to find it, hopefully it stands up to my nostalgic memories of it!

I decided to try something different and it paid off! After reading all these great reviews, I decided on this one, the only thing I got from another recipe was to put butter under the skin on each side of the Turkey, between the skin and breast. It came out absolutely perfect! Plus all the ingredients were ingredients that most everyone already has! Thank you!

This makes for a very pretty glazed skin, nice presentation. Flavor was really good, and everyone enjoyed it. My turkey was done much sooner than I expected (13 lb bird), but I was watching carefully, so didn't overdo it. I'll do this again. Thanks for posting.

I made this for Christmas dinner and received so many compliments! It has a nicely subtle sweetness that adds a wonderful flavor to the turkey. The spices are perfect. I wouldn't change a thing. Also, I took my chances and made gravy with the juices and pan drippings. Delicious! It added a sweetness to the stuffing that everyone loved. This will definitely be part of our holiday tradition.

I made this turkey just as instructed though we had a 14lb. bird instead of 16lb. The only thing I did that wasn't in the instructions, was to put foil over the turkey while it cooked the first two hours. Then I took it out and brushed the seasoning mixture on every 15 minutes. The turkey looked beautiful, smelled amazing, and tasted really good. It was very juicy and fell apart as it was cut. I would definitely make this again! It was so easy!

My turkey came out beautifully! I didn't have enough honey so I substituted half the honey with maple syrup. I think the color was darker because of the syrup. I used dried herbs, not fresh. I did prep my turkey by rubbing butter under the skin & used butter on the outside instead of olive oil.

I did this for my first time cooking a turkey and it came out delicious!  I followed the suggestion to cut the honey 50/50 with karo and it was perfect.  Since then, I've learned to do the following with it (coping from an email to a family member) -- 

I use ground sage, ground parsley, raw honey, and I cut the honey 50/50 with karo. 

Brush the bird liberally with the oil. Liberally dust the bird with the herbs in step 2. I usually pat/rub the herbs into it and make sure the bird is pretty well covered with them. Make sure you get under the wings and on all sides of the bird.

Don't put the bird in a bag, but cover it with aluminum foil. Try to avoid opening the oven except to pull it out and brush it with glaze.  (We have a gas oven).

We brush the bird about every 30 minutes while it's cooking until it's done.

Note: If you scale the recipe to the poundage of bird you have, you'll be drowning in glaze. What I do is scale it up for the first part, then I cut all the other stuff (needed in step 4 for the glaze) in half from there.  I still have glaze left over, but I'm not wasting a ton of ingredients and it's much easier to manage mixing everything together.

Do you marinade this turkey in advance?  Also, do you cover it with foil or leave it open to roast?

Why does this only have 70 reviews?!?!  This was only the second time I made turkey and I chose this recipe because it seemed easy and interesting.

I received many compliments.  The drippings can be used for gravy but you do have to add a lot of salt to it to get the honey done to a nice level but even with the honey gravy, it was a hit!  This is the only turkey recipe I will use.  I've made it 3 different times for 3 different events and received high praise for a non-chef.

Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  It's a shame it hasn't been used more and rated higher!

I've been making this turkey for Thanksgiving for the past three years, and it's always a big hit! This year one of my friends told me he's never liked turkey, but absolutely loved this one. As a vegetarian, I've never been able to try it, but the Thanksgiving guests told me to never change my recipe. The only thing I do differently is to cook it inside an oven bag, to keep the meat juicy. If you want to make gravy out of the drippings, I would recommend collecting those before glazing the bird.

This turkey came out AMAZING!! So delicious only thing i did different was stick two bars of butter  under the turkey skin on each side so it would be really moist. Perfection smelled and tasted sooooooo good!! Can't wait to get home and eat a big plate of left overs. Will definitely be making again. Thank you

made this recipe today for thanksgiving and it was amazing!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was moist,  flavorful and looked beautiful!  My young picky eaters loved  it! the seasonings went very well with the honey and the honey was not overwhelming- which I waswas worried about.  I will be making this every year from now on.  We had barely any left overs!  absolutely delicious!!!

This is my favorite turkey recipe!!!!  I'm not a fan of honey so I used maple syrup (make sure it's the real stuff).  That's the only thing I changed.  I've made it 2 years in a row now and it's a huge hit!  Thanks Moira. :)

This gave incredible depth of flavor. The honey and choice of herbs are a perfect balance of flavors. I now make turkey, and not just on Thanksgiving. I tried this with chicken. Amazing. I even sautéed shrimp in this butter mixture and put it over pasta Alfredo. It was incredible!

I am just rating the glaze as I did not follow the whole recipe for cooking the turkey. *Loved the glaze. Did use 1/2 honey and 1/2 pure maple syrup as others suggested, and poultry seasoning in lieu of other herbs.  The drippings will come out darker than normal which will affect the color of your gravy but we didn't mind that.

Delicious! I used this recipe this Thanksgiving and it was the most flavorful turkey I ever made (and pretty too!) The turkey browned up beautifully! I used orange olive oil on the turkey and that also added to the flavor, that was my only change. My family loved the turkey. My daughter was afraid the gravy might be too sweet because of the honey drippings but actually it made the gravy more flavorful and it wasn't sweet. Thank you for sharing this recipe, I'll use this one from now on whenever I roast a turkey!

I made this turkey this year for thanksgiving. I had never made a turkey before so when I was chosen to make it this year I was SO nervous. I just wanted it to have a good flavor and not be dry. After looking up recipes for about a month my husband came across this one.  Well this recipe hit it right on the money!! Everyone raved how juicy and amazing the turkey was!! Will definitely be using this recipe again in the future since I have been assigned turkey duty from now on!!

The most wonderful Turkey recipe ever tried. So tasty, such a gorgeous combination of sweet and savoury. I just cooked it for 30 people and there was not one bit left. I am so glad I decided to try this recipe. I must admit I always look at recipes that have a lot of reviews but took a chance with this one and the result was fabulous. Have saved this and will defiantly be using it over and over again.

Love this recipe.  I had only 1/4 cup of honey, so I cut the glaze proportions (butter and seasonings) down as well.  Still it produced plenty of flavor and the drippings made an excellent gravy. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

In our house, we have fondue for Thanksgiving because no one really cares for turkey---but I had one so I decided to give it a try. This was only the second time I've ever cooked a turkey and it was THE BEST turkey I've ever had.  It was soooo moist and flavorful, I was blown away!!  Everyone loved it, I can't wait for Christmas so I can make it for a bigger audience!!  Kudos to Moira!!!

Best turkey I have ever made.  Even the gravy from the juice was great, even though I was hesitant because of the honey.  I only ended up brushing 3 times before it was finished
