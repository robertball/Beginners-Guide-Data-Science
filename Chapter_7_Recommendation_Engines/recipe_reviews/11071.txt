I got this recipe to use up some molasses and cocao powder that had been sitting around, but i was amazed how easy and good this recipe was.  I will definitely make this one again.

Very good and tasty. This is the best recipe for gingerbread cookies I've seen so far. Substituted dark corn syrup for molasses and used cookie cutters to make gingerbread men. Will make again.

Not only easy to make, but a great recipe.  The chocolate and gingerbread flavors blend nicely, neither overwhelming the other.  I brought these to work and received rave reviews.  I will definitly make these again!

Only good if you like bitter coffee flavors.  Every one thought they were espresso cookies.  These did not fly off the plate.

I was a bit nervous about these because of the strong scent of molasses.  My nephews were the first to try them and loved them.  Kids are the best critics:-)  I will most certainly make these again next year.

These are nice cookies if you like real gingerbread. My picky husband who requested gingerbread cookies did not really like these, he said they were too strong and sweet. I said, that's what gingerbread is! I would probably not make these again due to my families preference but this is a good recipe, give it a try!

If you're looking for something different, this is it.  An odd flavor combo, but I did not care for the consistency of the cookie, sorry!  For sure, I won't be using up ingredients for this recipe again.

This is now our family's favorite gingerbread recipe at Christmas.  Don't roll them too thin though or they do get crunchy.

They were okay.  I enjoyed the ease of the recipe.  I enjoyed a variation from plain sugar cookies and gingerbread men. To me, these are an excellent choice for anyone who wants to decorate something, but the taste is a bit bland for something chocolate.

Excellent recipe that works.  I love these cookies!  The unique flavour created is great. I think I will use this recipe whenever I do gingerbread cookies and houses.  This time I used a cookie cutter to make star shapes.  I used cocoa and extra butter instead of chocolate squares.  My molasses was mostly crystallized so I used extra milk because of the lack of liquid.  Turned out even still.

Not so good.  The only person who liked these was my 3-year-old daughter so we sent them with her to school.  Followed the recipe exactly.  They came out looking beautiful, just didn't care for the gingerbread/chocolate combination.

Needs more chocolate, but held up well and did not crumble or break.

These got eaten, although the molasses taste seemed to overpower the chocolate. I was looking for something that would taste similar to the chocolate covered gingerbread cookies I get at World Market, but these were not even close. Not bad, just not what I wanted.

I'm sorry, I was expecting gingerbread not ginger snaps.  (Maybe I'll try making them without the ginger & . . . maybe my "mild" molasses is a bad brand, or old . . . ???)

The dough worked out fine and they looked good.  It was the taste that threw me off, as the cookies had a bitterish taste.  Only one out of 5 of my "official tasters" liked them.  He went home with the whole batch.

Super easy and lovely. I did exactly as directed, however, I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of ginger. I tasted the dough and it wasn't quite strong enough for me without the extra. Definitely will make again!
