These are a lovely little biscuit and would be perfect along side a cup of tea.  The raisins add just the right amount of sweetness. I served them warm with a little butter.   I made only a portion of the recipe, but Iâ€™ll be them again soon.

Good recipe. Sugar needs to be doubled. Brush with milk to get a golden brown top.

Loved them and they are delicious the next day as well. They don't dry out. The next time I will reduce the sugar by 1/2. I also like that there is no lard!! Nothing like great homebaked goods from the east coast

The dough came out really wet so I had to knead in quite a bit of additional flour.  I used a small glass but only got 14, so I need to find a smaller glass! Mine took 20 minutes,  I'm sure because they were bigger and also my oven is wonky, so next time I would try 375 or 400.  I doubled the raisins, added 2 tsp of Vanilla extract and brushed the tops with an egg wash and sprinkled a little sugar on top.  Flavor wise, these are delicious and I'm sure with the adjustments mentioned, these were work out perfect in the future.

Delicious! Made as-is except used dried currants instead of raisins. Dough is soft, but manageable. Came out light and fluffy, with just a touch of sweetness and fruitiness.

Best that I have made so far. They would be great for strawberry shortcake and I made cinnamon rolls they were perfect. Thank you.
