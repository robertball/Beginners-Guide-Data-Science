To add the corn water or not to.  That is the question.  I have the answer to that question!  I spent a lot of time searching the web and all data points to you ADD the water from the can of corn.  ADD THE WATER!  lol  I have made this recipe numerous times and it is best as written WITH the corn water.  If you don't want to add it I've done things like up the sour cream, add an extra egg, more corn bread mix.  When you do that it turns out just like corn bread.  The recipe as written I serve with a spoon.  It's bread-like, but not like regular corn bread.  Now for the taste.  Phenomenal.  Not one person in my family doesn't love this dish.  It makes a lot, but no matter what it is all gone.  This is great for any holiday meal or any general everyday of the week meal.  My family is always thrilled when they see me making this dish.  Thank you!  Wish I could give it 10 stars!

I have made a variation of this recipe for years.  Everyone loves it.  Increase sour cream by half and add 1/2 cup cheddar cheese while baking.  During last 10 minutes sprinkle additional cheese on top.  There is never any left over.

YUM! This is a great recipe. Definatly use less butter (about 1/2 cup) and more sour cream (about 2/3 cup). We weren't sure what to serve with this and had it by itself. It was great, but next time we will serve steak or some kind of meat with it since it kind of covers the veggie and bread for the meal. Wasn't sure whether to add the juice from the canned corn or not. I went ahead and DRAINED it before adding the corn and it turned out moist and delicious. If you are looking for more of a corn pudding type of recipe you might wanna go ahead and add the juice with it. Overall, a great recipe.

I have been making this recipe for about 5 years now every Thanksgiving. I substitute the regular corn muffin mix for a honey cornbread mix. Most of my family doesn't like corn bread and before I made this we never had it at meals. Now it is the most requested at our big family get togethers. The honey cornbread mix gives it that little bit of sweetness that makes it more of a treat!

I have made this twice and everyone loves it!  However, I cut the butter in half, as a whole cup seemed too much to me and I added a little extra sour cream.

This was a very good recipe for baked corn.  However, we used 1/2 the butter and it still turned out great.  We also used lowfat sour cream and could not taste the difference.  We will definitely make it again.  Doubles great.  Cook for about 50=60 minutes but DO NOT use a foil pan.  takes way too long to cook.

Wow -- this is some REALLY good cornbread (it's more like cornbread than "baked corn."), and so easy to make & hard to screw up.  Too much butter though, I halved the butter to 1/2 cup and upped the sour cream to 3/4 cup to make up for it, and it tasted great.

Same recipe as "baked corn" from this site but it takes into account the different size box of corn muffin mix.  We love it and have received sooo many requests for the recipe- we ALWAYS use 1/2 the butter and lite sour cream.  When you double the recipe cook for about 50-60 minutes.  DO NOT use a foil pan.  it will take so long to cook.

This is such a delicious and easy recipe to prepare! I followed some suggestions of others and only used 1/2 cup margarine and light sour cream. I found that keeping it in the oven for at least 45-50 minutes worked out well, with the top just beginning to brown. I will definitely be making this again soon.

My husband loves corn no matter how it's prepared. I've made this a number of times but always add 2 Tbsp. of sugar, light sour cream and only one egg.  After it's baked you can sprinkled it with a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and bake for a few more minutes until the cheese is melted.

Thank You! This was a very big hit at Thanksgiving! I wasn't expecting it to turn out like corn bread. When I pulled it out of the oven I was a little shocked. However, as soon as I dished it out and saw how moist it was inside I was delighted. The perfected combination, having it all be like a caserole would have been too gooey. The cold leftovers were really scrumptious too!! As this was my first Thanksgiving I made all my mothers recipes, this added a personal touch and was very well received. I'd eat it every day if it wasn't so high in fat. Thank you! Thank you! Thank You!

This is pure comfort food to me. I like to change it up sometimes and use Mexi-Corn but other than that, I stay true to the recipe. This is even better cooked in a cast iron skillet.

Very good recipe.  My famil loved it, they ate it all...there were no leftovers.  Even my 3-yr old son ate it, he calls it corn cake.  I added shredded cheese & green onions to give it a little added flavor. Will use again.

I would suggest the following changes.  1C sour cream, 1/2 C margarine, 3 eggs.  With those changes you have my family's favorite side dish.  They can't get enough of this.  When I make it for holidays it is more popular than potatoes and I've had to go to making 2 9x13s.

I scaled this to half the recipe. I wanted it ultra-moist...almost like a casserole rather than bread, so I upped the sour cream to about 2/3c-3/4c, and also upped the creamed corn to most of the can.  Also cut the butter amount in half!  It was really good with the sauce from Chicken Breasts Pierre and green beans for last night's dinner.

Great Flavor and very moist!! This was very very easy to make and turned out beautiful as well. I didn't use the canned corn and cream corn as the recipe called for, I used the corn from our garden and it turned out wonderufl. (I am partial to home grown!!) Was testing this recipe to see if I should make it for Thanksgiving and...It's for sure, I will be.

This is a great hit in my home! The first time I made it, I forgot the sour cream, but it still came out great. The second time, I added both boxes of jiffy corn mix and added a bit more of the sour cream. My family asks for it every week! Thank you for posting this.

Had agreed to use another recipe for Thanksgiving Dinner, but at last minute the recipe took too long to cook.  Thus, noted that this recipe had a lot of good reviews.  In a survey all at dinner, the corn dish was voted the best, even over a very well prepared overall meal.  The recipe is easy to make and very tasty.  Rather than mix in a separate bowl, just mix the items in the cooking dish and that way save on cleaning two dishes when the cooking dish will be empty after finishing it.

I just made this dish today. When I first pulled it out of the oven I was not happy because it was so runny. I was not that happy with the taste either. I put it back in the oven for 20 more minutes. It looked better and tasted better also. It is a bit too sweet for me, but that's my personal taste. I would like to try this recipe using my own cornmeal mix. I think that would solve the sweetness problem and I would like this dish much better.

Very good!  I added another corn meal mix, because the consistancy was way too watery for me (didn't want to eat it with a spoon), I like my cornbread "bready", not pudding-like.  If you can't add another mix then I would suggest DRAINING the corn.

A favorite with all our family. I make it every year, but I have to double the recipe, and I drizzle it with a little honey when it just comes out of the oven to give it a sweet "crust".

I have made this recipe several times since I discovered it & it has been a hit each time.  When I recently brought it to a potluck at work, everyone was commenting about how moist it is and asking for the recipe.  One person likened it to the sweet corn cakes they serve at Mexican restaurants.  I wouldn't change a thing!
Update:  This dish won first prize at the Chili and Cornbread Cookoff held at my work last year.  Yay!

Quick and easy to prepare, slightly sweet so kids love it and don't think they are eating vegetables.  I'll make it again!  But not too often as it is not for dieters with the cup of butter.  It is a definite comfort food!  Great with turkey and ham.  Would be great with fried chicken.

Very good.  I didn't have 12 oz of cornbread mix so I used only 6 oz.  I did not drain the whole kernel corn.  It turned out great, not too corny, not too bready.  :)

I stumbled upon this recipe a month ago. I have experimented with my own recipe for years because my husband gave me a vague discription for a corn bake that his late grandmother made for him as a young boy.  I wish I saw this recipe a lot sooner.  Would have saved me years of failed attempts before I finally succeeded a year ago.  This recipe is great, especially since it is the same ingredients that I use :-)  I do use one cup of sour cream instead of the half cup and I use JIFFY corn miffin mix.  Comes out perfect everytime.  I usually set my timer for 35 minutes and then test the middle of the cornbake with a toothpick. If it requires more time, I turn my oven off and let the cornbake sit in the oven for an additional 10 minutes.

A real crowd pleaser! I also reduced butter in half, and used 8x8 pan. If folks wonder about its consistency, it's just like a moist turkey stuffing.
Was a great sidedish with baked ham, green beans/bacon/onions.

I made this with mexican cornbread mix instead of regular, used only 3/4 cup of butter and added cheddar cheese on top. It was delicious!

I love this recipe.  Made it for the first time last year for christmas and it was a hit.  It will now be on the menu for each holiday meal!  I've discovered that it's also VERY yummy if you stir in one small can of chopped green chilies!

While this was very popular at Thanksgiving this year, I was disappointed. It came out like corn bread. With so many "wet" ingredients I expected more of a casserole rather than a bread. No complaints from my guests...some actually asked to take the leftovers home.

I tried this tonight and it was so yummy!  I did not drain the corn which was suggested by others who have tried this recipe before.  I also used 3/4 cup sour cream instead of 1/2 cup. Very very good.

Delicious! This is so easy and a great addition to any meal. We normally have it with our holiday dinners. One year when I tried to leave it out of the lineup I was met with protests!

This recipe was very tasty.  It was different than what I expected.  I thought it was going to be creamier than it was, but instead it was the consistency of corn bread.  It was very good.

Thanks for the great recipe!!  Everyone in the family enjoyed it.  I cut the recipe in half, using a small box of corn muffin mix, and small serving cans of whole-kernel corn and creamed corn, which worked great!  It came our very nicely and made for a warm meal.

I followed the recipe exactly and and the whole family LOVED it! I don't see why you'd add the corn water because I found it very moist and yummy without it. We're calling it Corny Cornbread in our house and it will now be on our family menu. Thanks!

Excellent. I followed previous reviewers' suggestions and used the honey corn bread mix and 1/2 cup butter.  Also, since there are only 3 of us now, I baked it in two 8x8 pans (35 minutes) instead of the 9x13 so I could freeze half of it more easily.  I will definitely make this again.

Made this for a sick friend and her family, along with Famous Butter Chicken, and Creamed Peas and Onions. They went CRAZY!!! I listened to other reviewers, and drained the corn, and only used 1/2 cup butter/margarine. They said it was the BEST, bar none, they had ever had!!! Her Brother went ballistic over this. I will use this as my ONLY baked corn recipe for the rest of my life!

I made this dish and it was ok, I was a bit confused on if the corn was to be drained or not.  I drained the first can of corn and it turned out like corn bread with bits of corn, maybe it would probably be a 5 star if I didn't drain it.  I unfortunaly had left overs on this dish.  It was probably me though.  I'm kind of scared to try it again.  Don't want to waste ingrediants if the corn was to be drained.

I'd never had baked corn or spoonbread before, and wanted something to serve with chili(Best Bean Chili--this site--wonderful!).  This was a perfect choice--like corn bread, only much more moist. (I used only half the suggested amount of butter.) And the whole kernel corn was a nice, sweet surprise.  Crumble some on top of a bowl of hot chili!

Incredibly good, easy, and fast.  A favorite all through the year, not just at Thanksgiving or holidays.  Kids love it.

This recipe is simply wonderful!  I plan on serving it this year at Christmas dinner.  I do use half the butter indicated, and it turns out fine.  Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix adds the perfect amount of sweetness, in my opinion.  Yummy!

Mmmm mmmm mmmm.  It resembles corn bread, but so much better!  Even my husband, who doesn't like corn very much, said he'd eat it again.  That's a huge compliment!

Best corn bread/cake recipe EVER! It's moist and delicious. I drain my corn and I use 2 boxes of Jiffy corn mix. I've passed this recipe to several friends and was asked at a recent pot-luck if I made it. It's a sample at Thanksgiving and Christmas

I've made this a few dozen times and it's always a great hit at family functions.  If you're lucky enough to have leftovers, it's great cold as well.  I usually reduce the butter to 3/4 cup and increase the sour cream to 3/4 cup.  I've seen lots of questions regarding adding or not adding the corn water -- I do not add the water from the canned corn and it turns out great.

Yum-my!  Made a few times, we like it the best using 2 cans of creamed corn, and as other reviews suggested, a little less butter, and a little more sour cream.  There's never any left over!

I have been looking for a "baked corn" recipe for a very long time! The recipe I have been making for holidays for the past 3 yrs is more of a corn pudding not baked corn. My mother-in-law lovessss baked corn from this one restaurant and I searched & searched for a real "baked corn" recipe and came across this one. I made it for Thanksgiving to take to my MIL's house and everyone absolutely loved this recipe! I did make one minor change though, I cut the butter back to a half cup instead of 1 cup like others had shared. Thanks you so very much for sharing this recipe Rhonda! :)

Made it as is - except cut the butter in half. I doubled it and made 2 9x13s for a crowd of 20. All of it was gobbled up except for one piece. I'd say that is a good indication that it was well liked!

Very good!  I used half the butter, 1.5 times the sour cream, a splash or two of buttermilk, and fresh corn instead of canned.  It was very yummy, but I think I would add more milk next time, as it was more bread-like, and I was hoping for more of a spoonbread.

Made just as the recipe calls for and it was delicious!  This would be good with 1/4 tsp chili pepper and a small can of diced green chili peppers on Mexican night as well.  Outstanding!

DELICIOUS!!  i did, however, deviate from the recipe a bit... didn't use whole kernel corn at all, used about 10 ozs of creamed corn, only 1 egg, and my corn muffin mix was only 8 ozs.  i baked it in a pie dish for about 25-30 minutes - you want the middle to still be really moist.  it is sooooo good!  my mom was crazy over it!  perfect w/pecan crusted chicken from this site & sweet potatoes w/raisins & pecans (from this site too!)!! thanks, rhonda!!  will make again & again!

If you are looking for kid friendly corn casserole, this is it---it has a very delicate taste. Many  corn casseroles include onions, peppers and cheese(which can be very good) but this recipe is subtle.I served it to 27 guests this very Thanksgiving day and it got "the best reviews". Can not get much easier or better than this!

Loved this dish.  It had the perfect combination of sweet and savory.  I used fresh sweet corn off the cob instead of a can of corn drained.  I just cooked it for about 10 minutes.  Next time will use light sour cream and less butter.  It was a little too fatty for my taste.  Since I will be using less liquid I might bake in a smaller dish to keep it moist.

This was an easy recipe to make.  It is good as a bread or side dish. Next time I make it, I will use less butter like someone else suggested.  I may try adding cheese as well. It does make a lot. We had enough for two nights.

This dish was very bland and sweet.  If I made this again I would add onions and cheese for flavor.

This is a great twist on the conventional corn bread. When using sweet corn, it has a nice sweetness to it that is offset by the saltiness of the rest of the ingredients, making it an interesting (in a good way) flavor combination. It is surprisingly filling, because though it is mainly comprised of corn, there is still a significant amount of butter in it. I see that as a plus; this will be around a much longer time, for snacking during the next week.

It's like eating corn on the cob without the fuss of the cob! I used white kernel corn and creamed white kernel corn for a sweeter taste.

Really delicious!  I used the corn and liquid from the can, and 16 ounces of corn muffin mix (2 boxes of Jiffy).  I did not have the sour cream on hand so used vanilla yogurt instead.  It was most and delicious, a little sweet but not too sweet, a hit among adults and kids alike.  My kids were very impressed that their cornbread had "real corn" in it :)

Perfect. Tastes very good. I used half of the water in the can or corn and drained the other half. Turned out perfect for my taste. I also did half butter and half margarine.

This was really good.  I took others advise and added the water from the canned corn, cut buter to 1/2c, increased sour cream to 1 c.  Also just realized recipe called for 2 eggs but I only used 1, oops!  It was very good.  Served with chili.

I made this yesterday with slow cooker pulled pork and it was so good I didn't even eat the pork.  I used only 1 stick of butter because that's all I had and it still came out excellent.  I can't wait to make it again.  Thanks for the delicious recipe!

I have made this for years but I add a little jalapeño to mine. You can use half of a small can of jalapeño or less if it's to spicy. Everyone really loves this way.

Just made this again for Thanksgiving, so easy and so yummy!! I didn't have any left overs as it all got devoured immediately. Added 1 cup sour cream instead of 1/2 cup and used only 1/4 cup melted butter. I always add the entire can of corn with the water. You won't regret trying this recipe.

I could not in good conscience add 1c. of butter so instead i cut it back to 1/2c and upped the sour cream to 1c. Moist and delicious! This is not supposed to be cornbread by any means so if that's what your looking for I would continue searching. However if you are looking for a dish with great corn flavor and reminiscent of cornbread but eaten with a spoon. Well, you my friend have found your recipe!

It rocked!!! I searched through many recipes and I believe the sour cream is what changed this recipe's moistness and taste compared to others which just add creamed corn to boxed corn bread. Everyone raved about this...we loved it so much we ate it for breakfast. Just enough sweetness for being bread.

Good recipe. We all liked it alot. I was looking for a sweeter, creamier spoon bread. The kernals were too identifiable. Next time I will try adding sugar or honey. And putting the two types of corn in a blender.

Awesomeness!  I served this with a sweet and spicy BBQ chicken and savory cooked spinach.  Everyone had seconds!  For anyone who is uncertain...you definately drain the corn.

Loved it.  I used 1/2 butter as other suggested.  Worked out perfect!

I have been making this recipe for years, but i always use a 1/2 stick of butter and a whole small container or sour cream and depending or how bready i want it, i might use 1 or maybe 2 boxes of corn bread mix. but it is delicious either way!

This stuff was really good.  I did use the corn water, since that seemed to be the general consensus of the reviewers.  It is VERY moist and you will not be able to eat it quite like traditional corn bread or muffins. It is possible to eat it with your hands, but using a spoon or fork might be better recommended :)

I was asked to bring this to an Easter dinner and it got rave reviews.  Everyone loved it.  To cut the fat a little, I used 3/4 cup of butter and 3/4 cup of fat free sour cream.  I did also add a bit of sugar (1/3 cup) as suggested by another reviewer, to add a bit of sweetness.  Also, as suggested by another reviewer, I used one and one-half boxes of Jiffy Muffin Mix (to make the 12 ounces of packaged corn muffin mix).  It was moist and delicious.  I know this will be the "cornbread" for which my family asks in the future to go with Chili, etc.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Rhonda!

This recipe is always a hit! I've had people who don't like cornbread raving about it. Although I love regular cornbread too, this is a more moist version...and the  whole kernels of corn really add to it. I use half of the amount of butter and twice as much light sour cream as called for and it turns out delicious.

GREAT recipe! This is a delicious baked corn.  I made this for a church Christmas potluck and there was none left over!  My husband loved it and wants me to make it as side dish for holiday meals. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This is a great "comfort food" recipe. I've made it for Thanksgiving for the past 8 years or so. I do try to "lighten" it up a bit by using egg beaters in place of the 2 eggs and "Lite Sour Cream" instead of whole fat. Friends and family all love it; I don't know why I only make it for the holidays when it would be a great side dish all winter long. Very filling and satisfying!

Great Corn recipe!  I made this for Thanksgiving last week, and I was semi afraid, because growing up we never made this we only had simple corn with butter, and when I married, my husband liked this for Thanksgiving, (and I used to use the box version) but this recipe is wonderful.  I chose it because of the use of sour cream.  ( I love recipes with sour cream and BUTTER!). I made it and it turned out great!  Will never use the box version again.  Thanks!

This is an great recipe for cornbread, but nothing spectacular. It tastes good and i'll probably make it again, but it's nothing more than corn bread w/ corn in it. it's a bit sweet too. i think i'll leave the sugar out and add jalapenos in it.

Made this for a potluck and it was very popular!  I just used the whole box of mix, and put a little more sour cream.  I also added some green chilis for color.

My kids loved this recipe. It was quick and easy (my seven year old actually made it). The main reason I went with this recipe over the other similar ones, is that it used twelve ounces of mix, instead of 8. I had twelve. I can't imagine using all the butter as called for. I used half and it was plenty butter enough. I swapped the whole eggs for 3 egg whites instead and used plain non-fat yogurt instead of sour cream.  I used this recipe to get rid of a mix that I did not really like because it was too sweet. So knowing that ahead of time, I added 1/4 cup of coarse ground corn meal (polenta) to the recipe, which I actually liked because it gave it some great body and texture along with all that corn. Turned out to be a real hearty corn bread.

I made this for Christmas because of all the wonderful reviews it received.  It was just okay.  I will try making again with less butter (a little greasy) and in a smaller pan so it would be thicker (it was very thin.)

I liked this recipe but the results would have been better if I used less butter (maybe 1/2 cup). I used a full cup & it was way too buttery.

This was the recipe I was looking for...just like Grandma makes. I did cut down on the butter a bit though. Also, since it's just the three of us I use half the batter to bake up in a casserole for dinner. The other half I bake in muffin tins. They freeze nicely and microwave in just a minute or 2 for a quick lunch side for my 2 year old. He loves them, and it's just so easy. Thanks for the recipe.

Hard to rate this one-- It was good the first day, because I'd been looking forward to it after all the great reviews. But when I thought about eating it the next day, I just felt kind of ill-- it's so heavy, and the egginess of it makes me vastly prefer a moist cornbread. Maybe because I used nonfat yogurt instead of sour cream?

Had never added sour cream to mine before but was pleasently surprised at how much richer it made this.  I love this as a dessert or along side enchiladas.  Have and will continue to make again and again.

This is awesome!  I made this along with pork ribs and cole slaw for my husband's birthday dinner and it was great!  I wouldn't change a thing about this recipe.  It is a keeper!

I found it to be too "heavy". Too much corn. Next time if I make it, it will be with half the amount noted.

I have been making this recipe for several years and it is always a winner! I do add 1/4 cup sugar to my recipe, however, just to make it a little sweeter.  It is very moist and delicious.

Much too much butter in this recipe. Our fingers were full of grease. Maybe I'll try again with less butter because the taste was good otherwise.

I made this recipe for Easter dinner at my daughter-in-laws.  Everyone liked it.  It was more like a cornbread than a casserole.  I agree with the lady that said you could spice it up if you wanted to with jalapenos.

Oh my goodness - I made this as a side to go with a smoked pork roast my husband put on the smoker and was it ever delicious. We had company for dinner and everyone raved about. Even those not too crazy about corn bread went nuts for this. Super moist but yet you are able to pick it up in your hands like cornbread. I used the liquid in the can of corn and did not change a thing. Followed the directions to a T. Thank you for the amazing recipe. I will be making this with our barbecues from now on.

I've made this several times following recipe.  This is a favorite at church luncheons.  So easy to make and I never have left overs to take home.  Special favorite of our Pastor.  I now double recipe for church functions.

I drained the corn and it was just right for cutting into squares. I will cut back on the butter next time though, it was a little greasy for my tastes. Other than that great recipe!

Not bad for a feast or a potluck, but it cooks up more like a buttery cornbread than a side of veggies.  As others have already stated, needs less butter, more sour cream, and more CORN.  Next time then I'll also try using another egg to help hold things together better.

Easy recipe. I was assigned to bring "Corn" to a potluck and this is what I chose.  All the guests loved it.  I cut the amount of butter in 1/2 (used only 1/2 cup) and still delicious.  I couldn't find a 12 oz package of corn bread muffin mix, so I bought 2 of the 8 oz Jiffy brand corn bread muffin mix and used 1.5 of them.

Huge hit in my household for Thanksgiving this year!  I did use the suggestion of using the liquid in the can of whole-kernel corn to make the baked corn more moist.  Will make this again!

This was fantastic! A moist and yummy version of corn bread that I will use from now on.  We couldn't eat the whole bread at one meal, so it was served for several evenings as a side and it was still excellent.

I have been making this for years - my kids LOVE it and always ask me to make it.  I traditionally have made it for Thanksgiving - it is a staple in my house.  I recently started making it for pot luck dinners in throw away foil pans, and it is great.  Also great if you have to go to a Pig Roast.  Go for the butter!

I made this last night and it was way too wet I went on the other peoples suggestions to use to corn water 
I cooked it for over an hour too. Plus I only used half a cup of butter and it was still too much, so if I make it next time I will drain corn and use less butter, the taste was good even if it was too mushy.

Really, really good. I used a 14.5 oz pkg of corn muffin mix and drained the canned corn. I turned out nice and fluffy. Great side dish, and with honey it's like dessert.

I just made this baked corn for Thanksgiving and it was delicious and so easy!!  This will be the recipe I use from now on when I want baked corn.  I did not drain the water in the can of whole kernel corn and I had to bake it for about an hour until it was golden brown.  Mmmmm...so good!!

This may be the ultimate 'comfort' food side dish.  There isn't a healthy thing about it but is it ever delicious!!  A friend gave me this recipe years ago but I lost it in my various moves.  Now I have discovered it again and holidays will have a new (old) favorite.  Thanks!!

My husband and I are huge corn bread fans, but I hate mixes and it's a bit of a hassle to make from scratch. This baked corn was a snap and tastes incredible. I, too, used only 1/2 cup of butter. My mix was a 15 ounce mix so I did not drain the canned corn.

This is a delicious dish!! We have been making this corn casserole in our family for years.  It's a "must have" at our holiday dinners.  The only difference in my recipe is that we use two cans cream corn and no whole kernel corn.

This isn't another corn bread recipe.  I serve this spooned from the pan.  It makes too much for the two of us, but is perfect for taking as a covered dish. Filling, sweet, it's a comforting addition to comfort food! Similar recipes call for adding cheese or vegetables, but I do believe it stands on its own as written here.

This was so simple to put together that the resulting deliciousness almost surprised me.  I guess a stick of butter will do that for a recipe!  I had to cook mine for nearly an hour (I accidentally used a slightly smaller box of corn muffin mix than called for), but other than that I made no changes.  It was everyone's favorite part of the meal and everyone went back for more.

Try replacing the sour cream with yogurt! This recipe is fabulous just as it is, but the second time I made it I used a 6 oz container of Chobani's Greek Vanilla Yogurt (zero fat/120 cals) in place of the 8 oz of sour cream, and no one in my family noticed the healthy change! I also cut the melted butter in half. It looks just like golden brown corn bread on the outside, but inside it's like a moist cake with sweet corn throughout! AWESOME!

I followed the recipe and was not impressed at all.  It was kinda blah.  Maybe 1-2 T of sugar would have been better?  The family didnt really like it either. (and we love corn!)

I really like this.  I used 1/2 cup butter and 2/3 cup sour cream otherwise followed the recipe.  My husband won't eat cornbread or anything that even looks like cornbread so I am going to try freezing half of this.  Will probably try a can of chopped chilies next time.  Will also bake it in an iron skillet like I do regular cornbread.

Hmmm. not a corn bread, not a corn casserole.  I reduced the butter to 3/4 cup and did not use the liquid in the corn.  I think this recipe is pretty good.  I am thinking it might need a little of the juice from the can or corn kernals and maybe some.... wait for it....  bacon pieces!  I do think this would be a nice easy crowd pleaser during the holidays, though.  A good one to try.

I tried this recipe because the baked corn we usually make takes longer and calls for more ingredients but it was my husbands favorite so I didn't try anything else...until I came across this recipe when I didn't have enough eggs for our traditional recipe. I made it and my family loved it! I followed the recipe as written and was impressed at how quick and easy it was to throw together. I baked at 375 degrees for about 35 minutes (along with the meat and dinner rolls). I tested for doneness by inserting a toothpick in the center. I really like the fact that I can make this ALONG with other foods. Will make this again for certain. Thanx for a great recipe!

Yum.  Tastes kinda like what my Granny's old corn pudding tasted like.  Worth it.  Easy, but delicious.

I made this on 4th of July with smoked turkey and all 25 people loved it!  The only thing I did different was to add 1 cup of cheddar cheese to the mix and 1 cup of cheddar cheese to the top!  Great taste....thanks to other reviews the cheese was a great addition!  5 stars

I didn't love this dish--especially for the amount of calories per serving.  But for all I know it could have been because of the store bought cornbread mix.

My family has been making this for over 15 yrs and it is also a staple on our holiday table.  Lately, I have been adding a handful or two of shredded cheese and about 1/2 tsp of salt.  It is perfect every time!!!

This recipe was pretty good. It is a bit crumbly. My son likes the Baked corn they have at Chevy's and he said this one was very similar.

Delicious!  I would not include all of the juice from the can of kernel corn next time though as the consistancy was a bit wet for my taste.  Very good, though.

I have always loved baked corn, but was never able to find the 'perfect' recipe for it - Until I stumbled across this recipe a few years back. It is such a big hit with friends and family, that not only do I have to make it both at Thanksgiving AND Christmas time - but I also have to make TWO batches each holiday! Thank you so much for sharing such a wonderful - and divinely easy to prepare - recipe with us all. Definitely 5+ stars!

I made this for Thanksgiving- and it was fabulous! My husband said it was the best thing on his plate- and he is a picky eater! The only change I made was I only added 3/4 cup of butter and it turned out great. I do think I will cut back to 1/2 cup next time.

This was incredibly good.  It makes A LOT!  I added shredded mozarella and shredded smoked gouda to the top.  Nice browning and cheesy crisp on top.

We affectionately named these "cornies" since they have the soft texture of brownies but flavor of corn bread.  A new family favorite for sure.

Yummy! I have made this recipe 2 different ways. I always use just 1 stick (1/2 cup) of butter. One way, draining the corn & using 1 c. sour cream (more bread like). The other way, without draining the corn & using the 1/2 cup sour cream (more pudding like). I always use one box of Jiffy mix. Both ways are delicious!

Wonderful recipe!  I used about a cup of sour cream and added a bit of salt, pepper, and seasoned salt.  I also added a cup of shredded cheese.  I planned to use cheddar, but needed what I had on hand for another recipe.  So, I used Velveeta instead.  It produced a delicious, cheesy side dish with a nice, creamy consistency.

This was a super hit at Thanksgiving.
Family is very fussy and I am shocked that they like this so much they asked me to make it at Christmas!  Interestingly, I didn't either like or dislike it myself.  But who cares....they loved it!!

This recipe is wonderful and simple, very forgiving of variation. I made it  exactly as written and added green chilis sauteed beforehand in olive oil to give it a mexican twist, used a small box of muffin mix (8.5 ounces) and it came out delicious and moist. It will be a side dish with cornish hens on Thanksgiving, just perfect.

I was looking for a recipe that was different than the old boring blah of just plain cornbread.  This hit the spot!!  My family has asked me on many occasions to make this and now this is one of their favorite side dishes.  I am taking this dish to my in-laws for Thanxgiving and hope everyone loves it as much as we do.  Thank you SO much for a superb recipe.

I made this 5 years ago for thanksgiving and it has become a mainstay for my family. My sister calls to tell me that she does not need to remind that I am making the baked corn.

I make this for Thanksgiving and it's always a hit! I opt to use fresh frozen corn instead of canned, it seems to add more sweetness. I've also topped it with a little shredded cheddar and let that bake until brown.  Awesome!

This is wonderful. My chef in training (14 y/o grandson) had to cook a dish for a baseball team party - supposed to be a joke, but I gave him this recipe and his friends and their parents loved it! iT was a barbecue and I passed out copies of this recipe to the parents. He promises to support me in my old age with his major league baseball salary!

I doubled this, but didn't double the amount of butter -- it was still PLENTY buttery. Served for a barbecue along with pulled pork and Texas brisket. It went really quickly! Will definitely make again.

This was a hard recipe to rate because I loved it BUT nobody else did. The reason I sought out this recipe is because my mom-in-law makes one and it's not good. The idea always sounded good but I just had to find the right recipe. I'll give it four stars just to be fair.

I’ve never had anything like this but was looking for something to go with chili beans. I’m not sure what the consistency was supposed to be, but the flavor was delicious! Mine came out mushy in the middle, so I’m not sure if I cooked it long enough.

This is a great side dish at any meal, especially at Thanksgiving served with turkey or ham.  I stretched the recipe a bit since I used 2 boxes of Jiffy Corn Muffin mix (total is 16 oz) and just added a little extra sour cream.  For a little variety, try adding about 1 tsp Polaner's Chopped Jalapeno's.  YUMMY!

This was just what I expected!  It is just like the corn cake that is served with many Mexican foods.  It made a great side dish to our Cornish game hens. Very creamy and overall great flavor.

This is awesome, I used Jiffy corn bread mix because it is slightly sweet, and 1 stick of butter works fine. I usually don't like corn mixed in with stuff (call me weird) but this was great, I'll be making this all the time now it's so simple. I baked it in a round deep casserole dish and it baked up beautiful.

My kids loved this, and I did as well. My kids said it wasn't quite like corn pudding that they had in TN with friends, this one had more of a corn bread texture, and they remember more of a pudding texture. Will keep this one, but try to find one like that as well! Thank you!

This is a great twist on corn bread!!  It is excellent...the only "cornbread" that I will make anymore!  The whole family loves it...I do however add a bit of sugar (about 1/3 cup) and it adds to the taste greatly!!

I had watched a food program on tv that talked about spoonbread being served in a restaurant in Harlem and wanted to try it.  Did a search on this site and found this recipe.  Didn't know what to expect but it was very good.  I also used 1/2 cup of butter as recommended by some.  The only disappointment was that I expected it to be sweeter.  The next time, I will try a sweeter cornbread mix.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Wonderful, very easy to make.  I left out the sour cream and used a Jiffy 8 1/2 oz corn muffin mix.  Will definately make again.  Next time will use the review tip to only use 1/2 cup butter or margarine.

We thought this was very good but I wish I would have listened to the others and put in half of a cup of melted butter instead of a cup.  Next time I make it I will be sure to do that.

This was a huge hit with everyone!  I reduced the butter (accidentally at first) to 1/2 cup and it turned out great.

This was a hit! People had seconds and thirds. I only used 1/2 cup of margarine & about 3/4 cup of reduced-fat sour cream. I would not use more sour cream; the taste of it would be too strong. It seemed to take about 10 minutes longer to bake into a bread-like consistency. Thanks for a delish dish.

This will be the third year that I have made this recipe. It is so good! It's always the first dish to be emptied at the table. Not a single person who's tried it didn't like it.

I hosted Thanksgiving 2000 and found this recipe to try something new.  Everyone loved it and have made it several times since.  A great change of pace.  Try adding a chopped onion to the butter for a little added flavor.

Very good easy recipe. Tastes more like a cornbread than a casserole...but makes a good addition to many meals.

We had a potluck at work and there were 20+ dishes.  I brought this one and everyone kept yelling "who brought the cornbread."  I have never made anything that got this positive a reaction.  Thanks!!!

Everyone raved about this great and easy casserole.  It comes out more like a souffle.  I started baking it at my house and moved it to my mother-in-laws to finish.  It puffed right back up and was wonderful.  Everyone asked for the recipe.

I made this recipe for a party of 25.  I doubled the recipe and had plenty for everyone.  It comes out more like corn bread than casserole but still tastes great.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I'd make it again, it's sooooo easy.

It doesn't get any easier than this. I didn't like the cornbread taste so much, probably would have preferred a more traditional corn pudding. My husband liked it.

My daughters love this. We like it somewhere between the texture of corn bread and corn pudding, so it's moist enough not to be able to pick up, but not runny. I always make a double recipe, and I cook it in a foil pan. I add the water with the whole kernel corn and put in 50% more sour cream. I bake it at 350 for about an hour.

I make this every Thanksgiving. My 12 year old LOVES it! One year I hadn't set it out yet and he asked "mom, Where's the baked corn? We have to have the baked corn!" He was very relieved when I brought it out to have with his turkey.

Everyone loved it and it's so simple you feel guilty accepting compliments.  I added a can of diced chilies (I think I saw this in another recipe) and sprinkled cheese on top for the last 15 min.  I had to bake it for a total of 50 min. but it was good to check at 35 min.  So moist and flavorful.

This recipe was good. I am a lover of corn.  I did as others stated and reduced the amount of butter. I had to bake a little longer because the center wasn't cooked, but other than that it was delicious.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving and brought it to dinner. It was a hit! I followed the directions and used what the recipe called for. Super easy to make and with the foil lined baking dish clean up was a breeze. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this many years ago for a Thanksgiving family get together when I burnt what I was originally taking ( and I had all of this on hand). Ever since then this is what everyone requests I bring to every get together we have and it is always the first dish to be empty. One year I tried to switch it up and brought something else and I still remember my grandpa following me to the kitchen as I put the dish down because he wanted the first piece and was so disappointed when he found out I brought something else. So now for his birthday I make this in a cake dish and give it to him with candles. 

***Also there have been times I have gone to make it and realize I didn't have sour cream and it still turned out great.

Tasty and I did drain the corn. I read reviews after I baked this. Some of the corn meal in the mix stayed a bit gritty.  There are other corn dishes on this site that I prefer, just personal taste, like Chef John's Corn Pudding. Thanks for a way to use up the corn muffin mix.

I loved it!  I only used 1/2 stick of butter...and it was delicious.  I made them in my Pampered Chef mini-muffin pan (squares) and I couldn't resist eating them by themselves, although I made them to eat with Chili.  Will make again soon.

I love baked corn ! I add like 1/4 cup sugar, add salt to it before you eat it, so good! Perfect salty sweet combo ! 
Side note, my Mimi adds shredded cheddar on top of hers; I prefer it without, but a lot of people like it with cheese

I read all the prior reviews before making this.  I used only one stick of butter, one cup of sour cream, two boxes of Jiffy Muffin Mix and one large minced jalapeño and did NOT use the corn water.   All good but I wanted it to be a little more 'bread' like.  I ate with my fingers, husband ate with a fork.  Love having the whole corn in it .  Next time, two peppers and 2/3 cup of sour cream.  Definitely use 9x13 pan.  It took 50 minutes in my convection oven set at 325.  Edges are the best,  little crunchy like a brownie!!  Perfect with our ham and bean soup.

This is a good side dish, even if it uses a boxed corn muffin mix. If you have a box in your panty, this is a better way to use it than making corn bread or muffins. Let it bake a little longer to get a nice, crisp, caramelized crust.

I've been baking this recipe for a bazillion years. So many variations...cayenne pepper, bacon pieces/bits, diced red peppers, etc. It's my "must bring" dish to our family gatherings.  This year, I'm bringing TWO as requested for leftovers.  Guess I'll be making a 3rd for us at home.   YES, ADD the corn water. I use 4 TBL butter. I use a round casserole dish. Takes about 50-60 to bake.  Be sure to spray oil around the top of the dish to avoid sticking.

Love it and make it often.  Sometimes I alter the recipe with more corn, add milk, and more cornbread mix. Then other times I use only sweet creamy corn and add honey on the top of the mix

LOVE this recipe. I make it all of the time.
The only thing I change is I use a whole cup of sour cream and sometimes I substitute a cup of coconut oil for the butter. I also bake this for an hour or so to let it get golden brown on top.

Good, but personally we like more corn and less cornbread in our baked corn. Will increase the corn and try an 8oz box of cornbread mix next time and see how that turns out.

If I could give this 10 stars I would.  I've made this so many times with so many different types of dishes such as tacos, barbecue,  and Thanksgiving meals.  It's always the dish I get complements on and it's so easy.  It reminds me of a cross between cornbread and the corn cake you get at many Mexican restaurants.  The only modification I use is 2 small boxes of jiffy corn muffin mix.  Make it.

Love this recipe. If you want to add in some spice, I've tried adding 1/4 cup (or less) of chopped jalapeños before baking. Great flavor kick without overloading the other tastes.

I normally bake 2 batches, depending on who is coming to eat...less cornbread mix, more corn and sweeter for the kids, and more spiced and cornbread mix for the adults. We've eaten this for years with different variations. This is a great basic recipe.

Makes a great presentation and so easy.  Made a double recipe for Thanksgiving and took home a clean dish.  I have received requests to bring it for Christmas dinner, too.  I'm always looking for a dish that can be made at home and then taken to dinner a two-hour drive away.  This one worked and wrapped in towels it stayed warm.  I also cut the butter in half and increased the sour cream.  I added 1/2 cup cheddar but will add a fulll cup with the next recipe.  Thanks! This one's a keeper.

I've been making this for years, at any pot luck, and family get together, and rarely if ever do I go home with anything. It's always a sure hit. As some people have noted, I tend to halve the butter and increase the sour cream. I think this also increases the bake time about 5-10 mins more. Also use lo-fat sour cream, because why not? You notice no difference and you are shaving off unnecessary calories. Enjoy everyone.

Maybe next time I'll add a bit of brown sugar,but that's just me.
Overall this recipe is good, for some reason it tasted better the next day for me lol I followed the recipe as is,but I used less butter and more sour cream.

Very yummy!  I'm giving it 4 stars only bc I thought it was a bit too butter.  I will make again and again but experiment with less butter.

I was responsible for a small group breakfast at a Fall  overnight ( lake cottage) camping.  I doubled the batch and used a large flat cake pan. Served squares of this with maple syrup. I served pan sausage doctored up with extra sage and coarse ground black pepper.  It was a big hit!!

Hi! I've been searching for something like this for quite some time. The last time I had something like this it was sweet with sliced jalapenos to spice it up a bit..Do you think I can add sugar to sweeten this up?

Holiday favorite!  I've been making this recipe several years!  The family always loves it.
I usually bake it between 45-60 minutes though.

Too greasy with this proportion.  Use 1/2 cup butter and one cup sour cream (lowfat is fine).
I sometimes sprinkle it with snipped chives or shredded cheese.  The leftover cut squares can easily be frozen, then individually reheated in the microwave as needed.

Came out great! An easy recipe for a kid to follow. Next time however, I would add a touch of sugar to give it a bit of sweetness.

I followed the recipe as directed.  I did use the juice fromt he corn.  This turned out great. Way too much butter but if used for a special dinner than, as Paula Deen would say, Just dont tell anyone!  ;-)

This was really great. I did make a few changes because I didn't have enough of the ingredients the recipe called for... I used one 1/2 cup of butter and 8 oz. of corn bread mix and it turned out wonderfully.

absolutely delicious. I did drain the corn- and used a box and a half of the jiffy mix. My texas born husband loved it. I liked it, and I don't even like corn bread =D

This is always the first side dish to go at parties!  My husband found this recipe one Valentine's Day, and cooked it for me since I love corn.  It is so good exactly as printed, but be sure to have ingredients on hand for a second batch!

My mother said this was a keeper and everyone agreed - I made it exactly as written (except I baked it in an 8x8 baking dish) and wouldn't change a thing. Nice texture, and not too sweet, I served it with Southwestern-stuffed chicken and a Mexican salad.

I made this for my Bunco group luncheon.  The only change that I made to the recipe was to add some fresh corn kernels from cooked corn on the cob that I had leftover.  This recipe is easy to make, and it made a great side dish for a baked ham.  This is definitely a recipe that I will make again.

Made this yesterday to compliment chili for a superbowl party. I liked it alot and it was different. I got mixed reviews from guests. I will make again but probably as a side dish instead of a bread. It was very sweet, moist and rich.

My kids and I LOVED it!!!  Great texture and taste.  I discarded the water from the corn and cut the butter in half.  When I realized I didn't have enough sour cream, I added plain low fat yogurt and it was great!!!  I will definitely make this again.

I am not big on the taste of creamed corn so this wasn't for me.  However, my family and my inlaws LOVED it.  My father in law is still talking about how good it was...and he usually complains about things! So this earned 5 stars on that alone!

WOW! I was trying to find a recipe for Thanksgiving that would not be passed over or left over.  No worries about that here!  Instantly gone with rave reviews and questions why I didn't make more! I am a big Jiffy Corn Muffin Mix fan and used 1-1/2 boxes instead of the 12 oz pkg suggested.  It was moist and yummy.  We'll make this again (but double the recipe next time!!)

I'm 7 months pregnant and was craving the sweet corn tomatilo from Chevy's. After reading the reviews this sounded very similar. I actually didn't like this much. I think it needs to be sweeter. I may make this again and add sugar. I'll probably 1/2 the recipe. A 9x13 is A LOT for my husband and I.

Great recipe!! I was looking for something to compliment my chili and decided to make this.  It is sooo yummy.  Only change I made was not to add a can of corn because I did not have it on hand.  It turned out almost like cake.  Very moist, and it just melts in your mouth.  My whole family really enjoyed this.  I can't wait to make it again!

This was good.  It was very easy to make and had a nice taste and texture.  You have to like cornbread to like this dish.

I get raves and repeat requests for holiday dinners.  The only thing I do differently is use the same amount of FROZEN corn instead of the canned corn.

I made this corn bake once and I think I will go back to my old recipe with cream cheese and no butter instead. Its much better and creamier. Instead of butter and sour cream I use 4oz cream cheese and 3/4 cup of milk. I also add one additional egg. I use this recipe for years at Thanksgiving and everyone always loves it.

Can't say enough about this recipe! Everyone loves it and there is never any left over.  It's so quick & easy to make, too! Add the water, why is everyone trying to make that more difficult than it really is? This is now a staple in our household.

To make it healthier, I cut the butter by half.  I also use corn muffin mix, so it's only an 8.5 oz box.  Turns out great.  And, yes, don't drain the corn.

Great recipe! Very moist but not runny. I served it with beef tenderloin and my husband and guests loved it! Will be making again. Added about a cup of shredded cheddar and a can of green chili's for some extra flavor.

This dish was very easy to make and delicious as well. I used fresh frozen corn instead of canned and to really make this dish special- I sprinkle a crushed up tube of Ritz crackers- with scattered pats of butter on top...makes it fabulous!! I agree- cooking in a foil pan took forever!

Very good! The texture of this dish was perfect and just what I was hoping for. I drained the corn and the finished product was not pudding like(wet) nor was it cornbread like(very dry). You have to spoon it from the dish and it was so good that there is no need to change a thing! Thanks for a great recipe!

Made it for a board meeting with a slow cooker beef stew and everyone loved it only 1 piece left over!! So easy and tasteful this will become a staple.......I would have added a little sugar for a bit of sweetness, but that is my famlies tastes.

MMMMM!  I made this to try for a side dish, but we ended up just eating it for supper.  My 10 year old loves to make it because it is so easy.  
One of our families fav's!

This recipe is very easy to make.   My family loves it.   I have also made this with the light sour cream and my family didn't notice the difference.  I did have to cook it a little bit longer when I used the light sour cream though.   It's delicious both ways.   This recipe is one that I do over and over again.

I made this with the suggestions to use 1/2 cup of butter and it was great.I think on the next one I will try the full cup of butter to see if there is much of a difference in taste(no cholesterol problem here!)Thanks!

Not at all what I expected.  This is like a corn pudding - not a bread/muffin type of recipe.  The taste was definitely good. It just wasn't good enough to outweigh the guilt of all the butter and sour cream.  If I am going to indulge, it will be on something else.

Hello all, I've just joined and found a great receipe for corn, but my problem is, living in Holland (Europe) it's not possible to 
find corn muffin mix, does anyone have an alternative ingredient for this mix. Greatly appreciate any help, thanks.

I loved this!!!  I used only 1/2 cup butter and upped the sour cream to 2/3 cup.  I thought the flavor and texture was great.  Unfortunately my boyfriend and his brother didn't care for it, but they don't like corn. :)  More for me!

Thank goodness I read the reviews before I made this. I cut the butter in half and added more sour cream, this turned out very well this way. I can't imagine doubling the butter. Great for a Sunday dinner. Thanks.

I know I'm being redundant here, but this recipe is excellent.  Simple yet outstanding. Made this for my family for Christmas dinner and they couldn't stop talking about it.  Had to give each of them a copy.  Didn't change a thing. Kudos.

This was great. My husband raved for this, said it reminded him of the corn pudding his aunt use to make when he was a child. This is definitely a keeper. Thanks.

This was very easy and very good. It is called corn pudding where I am at and turned out exactly like corn pudding should. Everyone ate seconds at dinner and we gobbled up the leftovers the next day.

This was really good.  I also used 1/2 the butter & am very glad I did.  The full amount would have just been greasy.

The first time I made it, I used the Marie Calendar's corn bread mix, which was more mix than the recipe called for.  It was delicious, but more like a regular cornbread...very moist and flavorful.  I made it last night with a different corn bread mix, that was UNDER the amount called for.  This time it came out more like a spoon bread, and oh so tasty!  I also took the advice of others and only used a half cup of butter...and it was still fantastic!!

I do not usually cook beyond the everyday basics, but this recipe was extremely easy to make and came out wonderful.  Very good for the holidays or as a change of pace from typical corn.  Wouldn't change a thing!

This is a wonderful recipe! My family loves it. I added a little cheddar cheese on the top a few minutes before serving, and let it melt and brown a bit. Very Good..I'l make this again.

This is more of a corn bread recipe rather than a corn bake. Use it if you want a switch on regular corn bread.

Kind of weird if you're not used to corn bread with actual chunks of corn. I'm not a big canned corn fan, and I wanted to pick it all out as I ate the (otherwise) yummy bread! Maybe if you bought the most expensive corn, or tried the sweet, smaller white frozen kernels. The kids thought it was strange, too. My husband liked the fact that the corn chunks made it more of a true side dish than a dessert dish. 1/2 c. of butter is plenty. Also, had to change the other measurements a bit because the little jiffy mixes are 8.5 oz, so 17 oz. total. Made a nice big pan, but I probably won't make it---at least, not with the corn chunks!---again.

I had decided at the last minute to find a recipe that resembled "Mexican corn pudding" served at one of our favorite restaurants and thought this sounded close enough (not corn bread to be eaten with fingers). My adjustments were to reduce butter to 1/4 cup, add 1/4 cup white sugar, and reduce the sour cream to 1/3 cup (because that's all I had on hand!) I baked in a 8x8 pan for 45 min and it turned out just like I expected. Great side dish!

good recipe, I've made it twice already and my husband says it's so-so. I still like green bean cassarole better for the holidays. I didn't cut back anything, or use low fat sour cream but I'm sure you could and it wouldn't make much difference.

This is awesome. I made it for the first time for Thanksgiving dinner. I was a bit nervous serving it before ever trying it on my own, but it was a huge hit! Everyone commented on it. My very picky husband even loved it and asked me to make again.

Thanks for the great recipe!

Delicious!  Everyone raved about this dish!  I used the leftovers for a breakfast casserole -- you can layer it with crumbled sausage and/or bacon, along wth scrambled eggs and cheese.  It also makes a great Mexican side dish -- just add about 1/2 cup more sour cream.  YUM!

very nice taste to this one. Definately something different, if that is what you are looking for. I was somewhat surprised by the sweetness of the flavor, my 2 1/2 year old even called it "cake." But it tasted great and went off well as a dish for christmas dinner. I'll be looking forward to making this again!

This dish was very good.  I'm always looking for a new corn recipe and this one was perfect.  My family loved the dish.

I made this dish for Christmas dinner.  I am not known to be the "best" cook in the world.  Everyone raved about it!  There was not a crumb left in the pan!  Great recipe!  Thank you!!!

All of my family loved this recipe.  It was so easy to fix and it disappeared quickly.  My daughter even liked it, she is a very hard person to please.

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and by the end of the day everyone was busy writing down the recipe so that they could make it at home.  They have all asked me to make it again for Christmas.
