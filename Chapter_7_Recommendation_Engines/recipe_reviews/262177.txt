These are my go-to pancakes that I always make for my family, I love them! Spelt results in a fluffier texture than whole wheat flour, yet is still whole grain, and I love that. I often add different fruits, nuts and spices to the mix. A favorite is fig, walnut, and cinnamon. Try these, you won't be disappointed!

They were the best pancakes I ever made. Love the recipes. I topped mine with honey and a bit of butter, and it just enhanced it's taste further more.

This recipe is very similar to the Fluffy Pancakes recipe in AR, and as I only buy spelt flour, I’ve made this recipe several times. It’s excellent. I would put out a request to anyone who knows how to make this substituting goat milk for cow. I’ve tried a few times to curdle it with vinegar, but, alas, no joy! I use Meyenberg goat milk, the only one o can find here.
