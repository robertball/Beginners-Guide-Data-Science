Loved this recipe.  The Brisket was very flavorful.  I put the brisket in the crock pot after marinating. I decided to cook in the crock pot since everything drys out in the oven so quickly in Colorado. I also included the marinade in the crockpot for extra moisture and flavor after boiling it for three minutes in case of bacteria.  I also added a 1/2 cup of water and set my crock pot for 6 hrs.  It was perfect!  I have never cooked with Liquid Smoke before and loved the flavor.  My company loved it too!

Good Lord!!  Am I just this hungry or is this actually this tasty?!  I think a little of both.  I followed the recipe as written until it came time to cook it.  I cooked it for 5 hours in my slow cooker (which does tend to run hotter than I believe it should). I got a wonderfully tender brisket, without the usual mushiness that I get from cooking roasts in the slow cooker.  The flavor was wonderful, the texture was perfect.  It's a keeper!  The only thing I will try next time is to add pepper flakes or hot sauce to the marinade,

Recipe did not say whether to roast covered or not. I "tented" with aluminum foil as a compromise.  My brisket was only 4 Lbs. so I cooked 1 hour less.  I should have checked at 3-1/2 hours;it was starting to burn. I suspect the 5 star reviews had a fattier/more marbled brisket for more flavor. It did have a nice smoky flavor but nothing outstanding. I will try this one again with a fattier brisket or maybe in a slow cooker.

Excellent blend of flavors.  I had an 8 lb brisket so I almost doubled the marinade.  I decided to "stab" the brisket with a sharp carving  fork and then a sharp knife to allow the flavor of the marinade to penetrate throughout the meat.  After having marinated in the refrigerator for about 18 hours I double wrapped the meat in heavy foil - placed in a roasting pan and baked at 225 for about 8 hours.  Let cool in the foil - then set aside to cool before slicing.  The juices were separated fat discarded and the juices boiled and reduced a bit.  Really good flavor.  Thank you

My brisket was closer to 12 lbs., but I had to cut it in half to fit it in my roasting pan.  I did triple the marinade because there was SOOO much brisket.  I covered it with foil (and sealed it really well) and let it cook all day long.  It was so tender and flavorful...my hubby couldn't stop raving.  I have tried other brisket recipes before that we liked, but this one is definitely going to the head of the pack!  Thanks for posting!

this is a great recipe!  i realized i didn't have any garlic salt for the marinade, so i chopped up some fresh garlic and it worked just as well...  the house smelled so good the whole time it was cooking...it reminded me and my family of grandma's great (lost) brisket recipe.  i will definitely make this again, though i might cut the cooking time by 45min to an hour as i was hoping it would be moister, but all in all it was fabulous!

Delicious! The only thing I would add is that be sure to cover when roasting in the oven (the instructions don't specify this) and add just a bit of water to the pan before roasting, also.

I served  a 10lb brisket at my last cookout and it was a big success. It'll leave a very dirty pan, though.

LOVE IT! I followed this recipe exactly, with a 5lb brisket (for 12 people this was not enough, we all wanted more), marinated overnight (8pm-10am), put the brisket and marinade in a 5qt crock pot on top of an onion cut into 4 sections and added 1/2 cup of water to the bottom (I won't add the water next time). Cooked on low until 5pm and it was amazing!!! I used a little of the gravy and mixed with regular brown gravy mix so it wouldn't be too strong. Everyone requested the recipe!

I picked up a brisket on sale even though I haven't had much success with them in the past, found this recipe & WOW! I used the crockpot and cooked the meat over a chopped onion, then made a gravy from the liquid to serve with mashed potatoes. Moist & Flavorful. A real keeper... ~Thank you! :)

This was great!  I served 7 and had so much left over.  Watch it towards the end of cooking time though, I didn't need the full time.

I made this recipe for my husband and parents.  It was a huge hit.  
I'm sure how really good it is depends on the quality of the brisket, but the flavors in this marinade - especially the celery seed - were great.

Great marinade, I used dehydrated onions instead of fresh (of course I had to add some water) Brisket came out very moist and tender. Could not have been better. Will try this marinade on other kinds of meat.

I thought this recipe was very flavorful.  I added a 1/4 cup more of onions.  I did tent the meat and watched it carefully.  Did not cook it for the entire 5 hours.

Wonderful flavor and this made a very moist and tender roast. Will most certainly be making this again. I did not use celery seed and it still came out great.

Delicious! I made this on Easter for our whole family & it could not have been better! The only thing I did different was use celery salt instead of celery seed (only because I did not have any). I will definitely be making this again!

This is a great recipe! I cut holes into the (not fatty side) of the brisket (by sticking a knife in an "X") and stuffed garlic inside. I also added olive oil to the rub marinade. I marinated the brisket for a couple of days (because my husband loves brisket and I wanted to be the best ;)). Served with homemade garlic mashed potatoes and cabbage. DELICIOUS!! The whole family loved it! I also used celery salt and onion salt.

It's time to give this recipe a little life.

I made this about 6 yrs ago and I am about to do it again. The one I made 6 yrs ago was for a last minute holiday dinner. I ended up not being able to let it sit in the Marinade for any amount of time.  I just cover the brisket in it and threw it in the baking bag with the brisket (yes I went the baking bag route and it paid off.. Super moist). The brisket was still super flavorful. All 5 lbs got devoured by a grateful group of friends.

This year I am going to have plenty of time to prep and marinade. I was also thinking about going lower on the temp and longer on the time since I do have the time.

I tried this recipe and didn't like it at all.  Even though I marinated it in the refrigerator overnight, the meat had no flavor.  All I could taste was the celery seed and it had a somewhat bitter flavor. There weren't enough pan drippings to make gravy.
