This was good...I used cheddar cheese instead of mozerella and added a cup of Salsa and everyone loved it!  I have made it 3 times this month and it's been a hit everytime!  Thanks..Tina

Felt like I must have done something wrong since everyone else gave it such high ratings. Checked the recipe again, and I had it right.  Way too much cheese for me.  I used half the amount and it still was too much.  If I made it again, I would use a fourth of the cheese, or add the second can of chili, to add more flavor.

I made this last week for my family and it is really really good....thick... but good. I made this in the crock pot b/c I was not going to be in the kitchen that day and it still turned out really good. We did add some milk and water to it (minimal) to lighten it up some but other than that this is something htat is great for munching on.

Really good.  I loved the use of mozzaella instead of cheddar.  Usually it is cheddar with chili and it is good, but the mozz was great..

Awesome dip! Made this for my most recent cocktail party and I needed to remake it twice! One tip though, I skipped the broiler part and kept it warm and easy to dip into by keeping it on low in a crockpot.

This was great, I used leftover "Thirty minute Chili" also on allrecipes.  I didn't need to add any more spices, just the cheeses!  A football sunday favorite.  Just ask the guys.

I made this for when my husband had some friends over to play cards and all the guys raved about it. I did take some of the suggestions from other reviews I added the cup salsa and I used both mozz cheese and chedder cheese. I also added a little bit of hamburger.

Crowd pleaser, and great afternoon snack.  Make it spicier with a little tabasco.  Really good.

I find that cheddar is too stringy, so a white cheese works best.  Mozzarella is good, but I use pepper jack or Monterey Jack.  I also add green chili’s over chili and put olives on top.  I don’t microwave any of it, I just layer it:

Cream cheese on bottom, next Chili, next Green chili’s , Garlic, if desired (I don’t use it), 
Next Cheese, top with Olives

Bake at 350 until cheese melts

This is awesome! I'm a college student who was just looking for a simple football snack. I added salsa like someone else said, and used cheddar instead of mozerella. The garlic powder and pepper are a great touch, and the salsa makes the consistency perfect. Super easy and fast!

Have made this twice now. Typically am a bit more heavy handed with garlic powder, but we like garlic in my house. I also added onion powder, chili powder and some red pepper. I used mixed shredded cheese and put sliced jalapeños on top this time for more of a kick! Great recipe with lots of room to play around. Will have to add salsa next time!

This wasn't one of my favorites because it is thick and the mozzarella makes it stringy.  2 packages of cheese is too much--I'd only use one if I make this again.  Be sure to keep it warm during serving and provide really thick tortilla chips that will not bresak easily.
