OH MY GOD these are good.  Made a smaller batch yesterday just to make sure the recipe was good, and they disappeared out of the pan to my housemates as fast as I was making them!  Everyone is Demanding More, so it's crepes for dinner tonight!

I was a bit concerned about the beer...and it turns out rightly so.  They were OK.  My husband and our friend, both beer drinkers, loved them.  I wasn't totally sold on them.  The beer flavor really stood out.  I filled the crepes with marinated beef cubes and mushrooms in a light sauce.  We also made a dessert with pudding and chocolate sauce.  I probably won't make them again.

These came out really well with beer for savory crepes, also good with champagne for sweet/fruity crepes.

This is a great recipe, but instead of using beer, I use coconut milk and for fruity crepes I use cinnamon, sugar and vanilla.

DELICOUS -- Tried many recipes b4 this is the best one!  Made the batter b4 dinner.  For desert - layout several flavors of ice cream and toppings of sprinkles, fresh fruits, whip cream, etc.  Cooked the crepe and everyone picked the fillings and toppings for their dessert.  The crepes â€“ a great success.  Thanks for the recipe.

Not bad, but I preferred Clare's.  I did both of them for Pancake Tuesday and these turned out a bit spongy, the other's were better...

This is a great quick recipe for crepes.  I followed the directions exactly, which I rarely do, and they were perfect.  I have a more traditional recipe for crepes that I make on special occassions, but it takes a long time to prepare.  This is perfect for those days when one wants crepes but does not want to spend hours in the kitchen.

These are the REAL deal. We had a French exchange student and this is how she'd make them, except she'd add a bit of rum to the batter. YUMMY - no leftovers.

I blame myself for the fact that I had a hard time making these crepes as thin as I wanted them.  Next time I will try the suggestion of adding a bit more milk.  I think the flavor of the crepes is really up to the quality of beer you use.  I made nutella crepes with Newcastle Brown Ale as my chosen beer, and the flavors complimented each other so well!  The beer was NOT overwhelming by any means, but then again, I am a beer drinker.  My dad loves Nutella crepes, and I'll be glad to include him on this idea of adding beer to the batter.  Can't wait for him to try it!

This makes great crepes, both for salty and dessert crepes (so says my French husband as well).  His only issue was that he had to add more milk just before frying them up to get the right consistency.  We'll use this one again.

Great crepes that I filled with leftover chicken, spinach and Pepper Jack cheese and topped with a cheesy white sauce. Delicious and thanks!

Wow! They were amazingly good! I used a Hefeweizen beer so it was not too overpowering. I filled the inside with ground beef that had mushrooms, potato, garlic,onion, green bell pepper, spices and I served it with lingonberries (like cranberries) Next time I will kick it up a notch with chanterells. The family loved this recipe!

I've been looking for a good crepe recipe ever since high school when my french teacher refused to share her 'secret recipe' with us. Now I know why she couldn't share it with us!!!  My husband, who almost never comments on food- especially desserts, wouldn't stop raving about them and ate about half of the batch in one sitting. *I made bavarian cream to fill these with, using the creme puff cake recipe... very good!

I followed the exact recipe, added a little cream to thin, and they turned out fantastic.  Best crepe ever and the subtle beer flavor added a very nice touch!  Filled with fruit filling of apples, peaches, and strawberries that I cooked on the stovetop while the batter fermented.

EXCELLENT!  I followed the recipe but did not wait the hour as instructed.   Hubby was hungry.  I filled the crepes with cherry pie filling and I'm looking forward to using other fruits as well.  I had never made crepes before so this is a new addition to our breakfast selections.  Thanks Magique for sharing such an EXCELLENT recipe!

Phenomenal flavor for savory crepes. It seems that the CO2 in the beer helps make this batter smoother and ready to go without much in the way of resting (though it's always a good idea if you have the time), but I was able to use the batter right away with no problem.

This is a really nice light crepe with the slightest sweetness from the beer. I used apples sauted in cinnamon-sugar.  Everyone loved the crepe.  Thanks
