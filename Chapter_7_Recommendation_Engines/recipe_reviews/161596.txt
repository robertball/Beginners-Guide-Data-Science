We really loved this marinade!  I used it to marinade the flat iron steak to use in the "Flat Iron Steak and Spinach Salad" from this site".  Will use again especially for that recipe.  We marinated it for about 5 hours and it had just the right amount of flavor, not too strong and not too mild.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent flavor.  Easy to make.  I made this recipe just as it appears on all recipes with the exception that I mixed everything in the bag (no extra dirty bowl).  Marinated the steak for a little over 1 hour, and sliced it against the grain.  We are ketchup and Hienz 57 people and neither of these condiments were necessary.  Which is very unusual for us.  Definitely a keeper.  I served it with sliced tomatoes out of our garden and homemade potato salad.

This was a wonderful recipe for steak. It was easy to prepare and the results were great. I substituted the powdered mustard with classic yellow mustard, and it worked well, both in the marinade and for the topping.
Thank you for sharing!

LIZCANCOOK---  I haven't yet tried this recipe...however, it is on my to eat list this weekend. Using a meat thermometer or simply cutting a slit on top of the steak and taking a peek would have given a good clue as to the "doneness" of the steak. The 4 minute per side was I'm sure relative to the heat source (medium high heat to me is probably different to what you consider medium high). A good rule of thumb is NEVER take cooking times stated in any recipe as gospel. Use your eyes and a meat thermometer the next time to avoid an under cooked piece of meat.

This steak was tender and flavorful.  I often use wine/olive oil marinades, throw in a few herbs an viola!  I didn't measure the mustard, and am sure I used at least 1-1 1/2 tsp. I also used a couple of T. of olive oil and threw in a few shakes from the Spike bottle. I started with a frozen flat iron steak and marinated for 4 hours, grilled on a fairly hot BBQ grill for 5-6 minutes each side, sliced thinly.  It was yummy!

I really, really did not like this recipe.  The marinade and brush-on at the end did not enhance the meat at all.  And 4 min/side left our 1-1/2" steaks purple rare inside (and to John W:  that IS how I found out the steak was underdone.  I'm warning others to check before they take the steaks off the grill...).

Easy ingredients to pull together for a marinade and while it did keep our Flat Iron Steaks tender, it did nothing to add flavor. Won't try again.

Flavor was fantastic!  I've become a real fan of this cut of steak and this recipe is so easy to make.  Don't overcook and then make 1/4" cuts at an angle fur succulent tender steak.   Leftovers reheat very well for a great treat the next day.

I really loved this, it had a decidedly French flavor. However, my hubby wasn't too big of a fan - said it was bland.  Also, you'll think you don't need to cook it so long because the cuts are small, but you really do or it's rare!

Just discovered this excellent cut of beef.  Inexpensive and delicious.  Followed others advice and kept it medium rare.  This recipe is really good as written.  I've made it twice; the first time to the letter, the second time I heated the olive oil with the herbs in it to infuse the flavors more.  It definitely gave more of a rosemary taste, but I'm not sure it was worth the extra pan :)

I marinated the steak for at least 4 hours and it didn't acquire much of the marinade taste, but when finished grilling it was good and tender.I will probably use this recipe again. It was not the best that I have ever made, but is easy to prepare.

I added some onion, doubled the red wine, and let it marinate overnight. The wine works well with this and I have used it on London Broils and it was delicious.

Excellent.  We used the George Forman grill to cook the steaks.    Wouldn't change a thing and got two thumbs up from the family.
