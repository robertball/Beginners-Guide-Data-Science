Love this more as a dip! We layer it onto a tray and then cover it with a small jar of raspberry jelly. Scoop it up with club crackers. YUM!

I made this, here are my thoughts for the review: It was a very decent flavored recipe. I made with Mexican shredded cheese for it was what I had on hand and Bac-O's bacon bits, because I wasn't sure the actual specification(which I liked in this)with regular mayo as well. Tasting this alone with crackers can be a bit salty. But having said that, using crackers actually takes that saltiness away and compliments the cheese ball. One thing I noticed in the mixing(preferring to the making into a ball) was it being extremely greasy from the mayo and slightly hard to shape. I shaped it after I wrapped in plastic. I would recommend a decrease of mayo by either a 1/8th to 1/4th cup of mayo. But either way it did taste rather good.

Excellent.  I was not sure this would be a good one, but I thought that the bacon bits and other flavors melded overnight, and it hads a very good taste.  I shaped it in the saran wrap.

I was surprised how good this recipe is, I used 1/4 cup light mayo and sharp cheddar cheese plus 1 tsp of minced garlic and it was delicious. I think I will use this recipe again but substitute cream cheese in place of the mayo.

I cannot eat cream cheese so this was a nice variation using mayonnaise.  I felt like it was a little bit plain, but I will definitely make it again and adapt the recipe for more flavor.    My family enjoyed it!
