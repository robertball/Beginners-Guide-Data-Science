Dear Sara -  I will be sending you my liposuction bill from eating massive quantities of this macaroni.  

This is very, very good.  It's almost exactly like the Gorgonzola Chicken dish that I get at my favorite restaurant.  DEFINTITELY use an extra 3/4 cup of cream or use less flour.  It doesn't need as much flour as it calls for unless you like a VERY THICK sauce.  Even with the extra cream it was thick, so keep that in mind!  I made this without the peppers, not a fan.  This would also work very well with chicken and penne instead of just a flat out "macaroni and cheese".

For my husband and myself who love blue cheese this was a two thumbs recipe.  I used evaporated skim mild instead of the cream to cut the fat content and tossed in a crushed clove of garlic with the peppers...

Addictively yummy!  Like some others I added fresh garlic.  I made mine creamier by doubling the cream. Such great flavor -- I'll be craving this one!

Yummy! A real keeper! Made the following modifications: omitted the salt and pepper during the cooking process; put 1/2 each of a red and green bell pepper in the food processor and finely chopped; increased the cream to 1 and 1/4 cups; decreased the amount of flour to 1/4 cup; used 1/2 cup of blue cheese, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, and 1/2 cup of shredded swiss cheese. Delish!!!

I really enjoyed this adult version of macaroni and cheese.  It was a different change of pace and I love blue cheese to begin with.  I would not change a thing, except maybe make it a little more creamy.  It's even better the next day.  Take note, you have to like blue cheese to enjoy this dish.

this is very rich and definitely for bleu-cheese lovers. If you're not passionate about the bleu cheese, cut it back to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese. Like previous reviewers have noted, this sauce is very thick, so either add more cream (or milk) to thin it out to desired consistency or cut back on the flour by 1/4-1/2 cup.   I would also recommend chopping the bells peppers rather than slicing them...the slices were a bit big.  I have another mac n' cheese recipe that I like more, so I will likely return to that one.  But this is a nice variation on your standard recipe.

This recipe did not turn out the way I expected.  I halved the blue cheese and it was still very strong (and I like blue cheese).  Sauce was not creamy at all--more of a thick, chewy texture.  My husband came to the rescue and added Louisiana hotsauce and it ended up tasting like a "buffalo wing" macaroni and cheese, which was a big improvement.  My neighbor absolutely adored it and took all of the leftovers home.  If you are a blue cheese fiend, you may like this, otherwise the taste will be too strong.

This was ok but definitely nothing special. Husband thought it tasted kinda funky, and wasn't very keen. I won't be making this again. Thanks anyway.

My husband and I love bleu cheese but Oh my was this way too much bleu cheese.  Maybe because i tripled the recipe to serve a lot of ppl.  We did not eat it only a few bites were taken and lots of groaning and complaints were passed around.  I think it would have been better with a lot less bleu cheese.  Maybe some one can try it and report back as I have been forbidden to try this one again.  A sure shame as I was lookig so forward to a great suprise and dish to share.

This recipe is really good, however, I do doctor it slightly and serve it as the main dish instead of a side dish. I leave out the peppers because I just prefer not to have them in this dish. I use a full pound of macaroni and add broccoli (1 12-14 oz. bag frozen usually works - I steam it and add it to the pasta before the sauce is put on.) I also add just a smidge more blue cheese, if I have it - I just LOVE it! The other thing I add to the sauce is garlic - fresh minced and a little powdered - add  to your taste level. Finally, I've also made it where I added chuncks of chicken breast.   My only other advice - be sure the yogurt is PLAIN as the recipe calls for. I made this once and accidently had gotten vanilla...threw the whole flavor off!  My husband rarely makes dinner requests, but he asks for this one at least once a month now!

Unlike everyone else, I could barely taste the blue cheese in this. I did add more cream like other reviewers suggested, so maybe that mellowed the flavor a bit.  I LOVE blue cheese though, and was hoping for a really powerful taste.  It was still good, but I was disappointed.  I did add sauteed mushrooms and carmelized onions. Those were great. I think I will try this recipe again but with more blue cheese.

My husband and I really love this dish!  I make it according the directions - no additions or omissions.  It is quite rich, though, so I usually serve it with light foods (like a tossed salad and simply seasoned meat)

This is amazing!  We've made it several times and we just love it.  I always use half/half (sometimes FF half/half) and fat-free plain yogurt, and it still tastes great.  It's delicious with blue cheese, but I'm also looking forward to trying some other cheeses (like feta)!  Highly recommend for an easy, sophisticated side dish!

Excellent side dish!  I thought the flavors were great, not too strong.  I only added three tablespoons flour to the butter and peppers.  And I baked it with additional parm cheese on top, just to make that great crust.

This was pretty good...very blue-cheesy!!  I added milk to create a smoother sauce, and after it was done I ended up adding fresh spinach which I thought was a nice addition.

My husband and I love bleu cheese and this was an excellent twist on an old fave, especially when served along side a roast beef sandwhich.  Don't expect the kids to like it - My 4 year old wouldn't touch it.

I loved it but I should caution you.  If you are not a fan of blue cheese than you will not like this recipe.  I am a huge fan so I thought it was great.  The recipe was followed exactly and came out wonderful.  It is also pretty simple to make.  The dish is very rich though and so I will only make it on special occassions.

Now, some people might like this, but in the end I think the macaroni would have been better with a little butter on it, alone, and the bleu cheese would have been better straight.   But, each to his own.  (And I do LOVE bleu cheese.)

I served this as a side at a holiday party and it was fantastic. Not surprisingly, people who shy away from sharp cheeses won't like this (It has a strong blue cheese flavor - duh!) but if you're up for trying a new twist on the classic mac and cheese, this one is a winner! Thanks for the recipe!

Not bad, but not great.  The flavor was just kind of bland, and I used a pretty strong bleu cheese.  Next time, I'm just going to make my regular mac and cheese, and crumble in some blue cheese if I want an extra tang.

Just made this tonight, the sauce is very thick but it was WONDERFUL. Will definitely make it again as a lover of blue cheese, it's interesting to see how diverse it can be in cooking.

I changed a few items in this recipe based on previous reviews, but what resulted was delicious.  Instead of bell peppers, I blanched some broccoli and then cooked it in the butter with about 2 cloves of minced garlic and without the additional salt and pepper.  I then tossed in about 2 teaspoons of flour and allowed that to cook for just a few seconds (to toast the flour a bit).  I then added twice the amount of heavy cream asked for in this recipe and used a mix of 1/2 cup blue cheese, 3/4 cup parmesan and 3/4 cup cheddar cheese along with the 1/2 cup plain yogurt.  It was heavenly.  Definitely a nice twist on traditional mac n cheese.

So amazing, and even better when re-heated the next day!  It's really rich, so I would recommend serving as a side, not as a meal.  I got 10 servings out of this batch.

Someone mentioned that it's not for those who don't LOVE bleu cheese...and they are correct.  If you are not absolutely in love with bleu cheese (or stinky cheese in general), this is not for you.

The second time I made it, I grilled up two chicken breasts, cut the chicken into bite-sized chunks, tossed them in a hefty amount of buffalo wing sauce and then added the chicken to the mac and cheese for an amazing buffalo chicken version.

Absolutely yummy!

I  was looking for a way to use up some Maytag and found this one--didn't have exact ingredients but just started throwing things in and it turned out great!  I halved the recipe, but used an extra tbsp. of butter.  Left the peppers out and seasoned with the salt and pepper.  Added approx. 1/2 c blue cheese, 1/2 c parmesan, 1/2 c plain greek yogurt, 1/4 c evaporated milk instead (didn't have heavy cream).  Tastes very similar to a recipe I made for a drizzle over kettle-cooked potato chips (which is also AMAZING).

This was just okay for our family.  Each of us thought that the 1 cup of blue cheese crumbles made it much too strong to really enjoy.  I may make it again using less blue cheese, adding regular dressing, etc...

I really liked this. I didn't *love* it (as in I'd make it once a week for the rest of my life), but it was really good. It's definitely a pretty intense mac, so I paired it with a milder meal and served it as a side dish. I think it would be a bit heavy as a main course. Overall a good use for my leftover bleu cheese!

I'm on the fence about this recipe.  I love blue cheese so I was anxious to try it.  However I do not like peppers and I prefer my macaroni baked.  I subbed half an onion for the peppers and added a pinch of red pepper flakes for some heat.  I ate two helpings of this for dinner and the second was better than the first.  I really think it needs some cheddar to balance the flavor profile.  I may make it again and tweak it more.  Thanks!

Im only giving it a 4 star because my husband LOVED it, I liked it but I wouldnt make it again.  I thought it had too much blue cheese, and I could taste the yogurt.  May be better with cheddar instead of yogurt!

A local restaurant used to serve a Bleu Cheese Macaroni and they recently stopped so I went searching for a replacement.  This is amazing!  Their version had bacon and apples, so I made it that way, omitting the add-ins in this recipe.  Simple added 3-4 slices of crumbled bacon and about a half of a diced granny smith or other firm/slightly tart apple after removing from the heat.  The heat of the dish "cooks" the apple just enough.  It is AMAZING!

This was good.  Like other reviewers I scaled back the blue cheese to a half cup and instead of plain parmesan cheese I used a 5 cheese Italian blend.  Very intersting flavors.

This is a VERY interesting mac and cheese version NOT for everyone. However, if you are a blue cheese lover, then this is for you! The taste is unique and gourmet and yet easy to make. A must try!

I really like Bleu Cheese, but this was almost TOO much. It's good in moderation, but I couldn't even finish a whole bowl. I'm not sure if I like the peppers in there, I'd probably take them out the next time I make it.

My husband and I loved the dish! As other have mentioned, the cheese is a bit overwhelming. I will cut back to about 3/4 cup next time.    I also took the advice of other reviewers and only used a tablespoon of flour to thicken the cheese. This seemed to work well, and was nice and creamy.   Fresh bell peppers from our garden only added to the deliciousness!

I really wanted to love this recipe, but it was just okay. The sauce was missing something to it, whether it be another kind of cheese to round out the flavour a bit more, or something else, but I will admit that I was a little disappointed with this. I made it for a group of friends, and everyone ate it, and there weren’t any leftovers, however this is definitely one of those recipes that you need to play around with before you find a dish that's to your liking. I recommend it to anyone who loves blue cheese, but if you're looking at the ingredients thinking that you want to add something else to it, trust that instinct, and add whatever it is that you're thinking about.

The flavor is too strong and the recipe too rich; we could only eat a few bites...and we love blue cheese.  Perhaps this would work better if paired with a beef dish to balance the strong flavor.

Careful! This is EXTREMELY strong macaroni! My bf adores bleu cheese, but this was too much even for him. Somewhere between the blue cheese and the pepper made a really strong taste, that neither of us could eat more than a cup or so of. Definitely something to be served in small doses - very good, just very overpowering.

Very tasty and a nice twist to the usual alfredo. After I put in the flour, I thought the sauce would be too thick but it stuck to the pasta nicely. I also added chopped green onions.

It ususally ends up being kind of "casserol-ey" rather than creamy, but always delicious.

YUM! You really have to like Bleu Cheese for this one. Easy, cheesy and good! The whole family loved it. Could've used more of the peppers. I think I'll use two of each next time. Definitely a side dish and not a main course.

OH MY GOSH THIS IS GOOD!!!  Potent and delicious!!!  You MUST be a bleu cheese lover to truly appreciate its greatness!!  The red and green peppers used in the recipe produce an even better flavor the next day - the cheeses and peppers together are a marriage of tantalizing flavors.  mmmmmmmm good...thank you Sara for submitting this recipe!!!

This was wonderful!  My fiance absolutely loved it! He's usually not a leftovers kind of guy, but it was gone the next day!  I'm thinking of adding crab meat to it next time, without the bell peppers.  Easy to make!  A definite keeper!

This was just an o.k. macaroni.  The flavor was stong, but what I expected.  Definately not creamy enough, very thick.  I would add, at least, 1/4 cup milk in with the cream.  Hot sauce sure made it better.  My three year old loved it.  My 8 year old was not home, but I don't think she would have liked it.  My husband felt sorry for me, he said. "You did all that work, and to get the same flavor all you had to do was put bleu cheese dressing on top of noodles."  It was good.  I even ate the leftovers, but I don't think I will make it again. I will stick to regular mac and cheese and occasionally put in some blue cheese.

This is the best mac & cheese I've ever had at home.  And its so easy, my husband made it!  My 2 year old loved the noodles, but he eats everything anyway.  Not recommended for weight-watchers.

I replaced the peppers with a small amount of spicy Romanian pork belly because my wife hates bell peppers. The combination of the cheese and the spicy bacon was enough to put her in to a realm of ecstasy that even adult film stars can only dream about. She took some to work and the next thing I know 15+ people wanting the recipe. This stuff ROCKS!!

Great recipe for all cheeselovers! I didn't have a heavy cream so I just used a milk and yogurt. I reduced the quantity of flour and added garlic. Everything else was as in the original recipe. I recommend Bleu Cheese Macaroni! :)

This has become one of our families favorite dinners.  We use skim milk instead of cream and non-fat yogurt because we like it better. We also sometimes use broccoli instead of the peppers.

Great recipe. I spiced mine up a bit using some Franks buffalo sauce. Excellent flavor together.

So I made this for my boyfriend and I and we loved it!  I read through most of the reviews and changed it a little, adding garlic, using half and half and cutting back the blue cheese to about just under a half of a cup (that's all I had).  We loved it, but I think next time we're gonna do the full cup of blue cheese.  We could taste it, but think it'd be better with the full amount.  I'm gonna also add some chicken

Wow!!  This recipe is fantastic!!  My family are all bleu cheese lovers so this one was an instant hit!!  The recipe is easy to make and the variations are endless.  Next time I want to try a little crumbled bacon and onions.  I did double the cream as did many others.  I'll definitely be making this one again and again!!

Surprisingly good.  I wasn't sure how well the bell peppers would complement the blue cheese flavor, but I used Orange and Yellow Bells instead of Green and Red, and they provided a subtle accent to the sauce and a nice contrasting crunch.  I hedged and only used 1/2 cup blue, and 1 cup of the Kraft Four-Cheese Italian blend, but as a blue cheese fan, I could see upping the blue to at least 3/4c of the 1.5 total.  I also added a cup of cream, rather than 3/4c.  I think I might try adding broccoli next time.

If you like bleu cheese you will LOVE this recipe! This mac n cheese is BETTER than any I've had at restaurants. I add more cream to make it creamier. But other than that... it's PERFECT! Super easy too.

This is a delicious spin on mac and cheese. I used penne pasta as opposed to elbows and I also added additional cream to loosen up the cheese sauce.  Great recipe!  Definitely a keeper.

This was very good! I made a few changes too. First I only used 1/4 c of flour. Then I substituted cheddar cheese for Parm and omitted the peppers. I also cooked and cubed chicken breast and added that to the mixture along with Franks Red Hot Buffalo sauce! Super as a buffalo chicken mac n cheese!

I thought it was ok. Mine turned out pretty dry and it had a really strong blue cheese flavor. I like blue cheese so I didnt mind that part. My husband did not like it though. It seemed kinda boring to me. I did not put the peppers in it though because we dont like them. Not sure if that had anything to do with it being boring. Definitely more of a side dish than a main course.

I loved this, but one of my friends wasn't crazy about it since the bleu cheese tends to stay clumped and does not hold as well to the noodles like typical mac and cheese. If no one else though, I would make it for myself during one of my bleu cheese cravings. Plus I think its easier to make healthier since bleu cheese is already so strong, you don't have to make it as fatty and cheesy like regular mac and cheese.

Made this exactly as directed and it was a big hit.  My boyfriend loves blue cheese, while I am only so-so on it, but the flavor was creamy but not too overpowering.  A very yummy and adult mac and cheese.

LOVED IT!!! My husband was reluctant to try because he loves my regular homemade M & C. But now, this is the M & C recipe he asks for the most. Just try it and you will love it. Use more or less Blue cheese depending how much you like the strong taste.

I was looking for a side to serve with some Buffalo pulled chicken sandwiches and thought blue cheese mac would be perfect.  The sauce resulting from 3/4 cup cream and 1/3 cup flour  would more accurately be called a paste, then add yogurt and cheese well let's just say it needed a lot of thinning out which made the sauce less flavorful.

It was great! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. I used sour cream instead of plain yogurt, used the parmesan from the shaker instead of a brick, and used 2% milk. Again, because that's all I had and sometimes you just don't want to go to the store. So, now you know that if you're missing those ingredients too, these substitutions will be just fine.

According to other reviews, I also added 1/4 cup sharp cheddar, cut back on the bleu cheese a bit, and added a shake of garlic. Next time I'll use the full amount of Bleu Cheese, but for my first time, I wanted to err on the side of caution. I docked a star because it was bland without the garlic.

I try not to make changes on my first try of a recipe, but based on the reviews, I was fairly certain that I'd prefer an increase to the heavy cream to 1 cup.  I ended up doubling the recipe because I like leftover for my lunches.  I ended up skimping on the yogurt a little, because I could only find a 7 oz container, but it worked fine.  I loved the tanginess of this.  Be sure not to buy cheap blue cheese!  I tried it a second time using broccoli instead of green peppers, but it lost some of its zip.  Definitely use the peppers!

Even the kids love it! We serve it with hot wings or redhot chicken breasts! It is best with actual heavy cream but I have made it successfully with almond milk as that's what is always on hand.

I cut back on the flour and doubled the cream, but the sauce was still too thick to me and my husband. The flavor overall was amazing. I will just add a lot more cream next time.

We made this with a few changes based on other reviews.  We used half and half (all we had), but increased the amount to 1C.  We did not use any flour.  The sauce was very creamy and plenty thick enough, so I was happy we made this change.  For cheeses, we used 1/3C blue cheese, 2/3 C mild cheddar and 1/2 Parmesan.   This gave it a nice blue cheese flavor without being overpowering.  We did not use any peppers.  This is a great change from the traditional mac n cheese, and one that we will make again often!

I do love bleu cheese.  If you do not absolutly love it, I would switch to a sharp Cheddar.  That would pretty awesome too.  I will make again.

This is so rich that it is definitely not a main course mac&cheese.  Would be much better as a small side dish.  I thought it turned out very well & I followed the recipe to a tee but added more milk to make the creamy mixture thinner.

This is a great variation on the traditional mac and cheese.  I personalized it a little by using rainbow shells instead of macaroni.  I also added fresh garlic and a jalapeno pepper.  I didnt have any heavy cream on hand so i substituted neufchatel (low fat cream cheese) cheese and milk.  It was very flavorful and also good with hot sauce.  I will definitely make this recipe again, probably for a family gathering or special occasion.

This was the best macaroni and cheese I have ever had. It melted in my mouth.
