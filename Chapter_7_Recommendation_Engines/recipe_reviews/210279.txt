Reminds me of a dish my mother made when I was a kid.  It was good then and now.  My grand kids like this, too.  I made a couple of changes to suit my family's tastes.  Used less ginger and less apricot preserves in the sauce.  Also, I sauteed the sausage first and used the leftover grease from it in the skillet to cook the vegetables, as I find most smoked sausage is rather greasy.  I drained the sausage on paper towels before adding it back in to the vegetables and sauce.

Great recipe! One of my husband's new favorite dinners.  I didn't use the crisco or tomatoes, but followed everything else and loved it! Tastes great over white rice. This one goes in my book!  Thanks!

Made it this evening and the family loved it. I have a larger family so I doubled the recipe & used extra virgin olive oil instead of crisco but other than that I followed the ingredients exactly. I disagree about the prep time & cook time but I guess if you like your veggies more al dente' it would work. The flavor combination is a bit sweet so I think I will back off on the preserves to 3/4 of the recommended next time but other than that a good recipe.

Sauteed the vegetables and sausage in a little extra virgin olive oil. Used fresh grated ginger and homemade blackberry jam instead of apricot jam. I'm sure apricot jam would taste good too but I wanted to use what I had on hand. The dish could have used a touch more vinegar to cut through the sweetness, but all in all it was a great dish. Served over rice.

USED ONLY 1/2 TOMATO SINCE THAT'S ALL I HAD.  USED PEACH PRESERVES.  SERVED OVER BROWN RICE.  VERY GOOD!  I would add some cooked carrots next time.

This meal was delicious.  I substituted orange marmalade for the apricot preserves, and I liked that flavor.

I made this for a pitch in. Everyone liked it. I used peach jelly because I already had some. The rest was exactly to recipe. Yum!

The pepper just didn't seem to taste right with the rest of the dish - but I loved the sweet/salty combo.

Great recipe for a busy day! Browned turkey sausage then added 1 chopped green pepper, 1 chopped yellow pepper and a chopped sweet onion. I love garlic, so I also added some minced garlic to the mix. Skipped the tomato as I didn't have one on hand, and reduced the preserves to 1/4 cup since I feared it would be too sweet. It wasn't, so next time I'll use the full 1/2 cup (I used the Smucker's apricot spreadable fruit). Also, reduced the ginger down to 1/4 tsp, but would probably do 3/4 - 1 tsp next time. Had to sub teriyaki for soy (didn't have it) and used seasoned rice vinegar. Only used an 8 oz can of pineapple chunks, which was perfect for our preference. Served over steamed jasmine rice, it was better than expected!  DH dumped on his usual red pepper flakes, and I couldn't help myself from using some Thai sweet chile sauce on my portion. Using just about any veggie (broccoli, cabbage, carrots, spinach, etc.) would work well with this very adaptable recipe. Even chicken or pork would be a nice sub for the smoked sausage. Definitely enjoyed and will certainly make again!

Deliciously flavorful and very easy to make.  I did all prep work ahead of time (it's not much) so when dinnertime came, all went into a pan and sauteed.  I used Smuckers Apricot Simply Fruit, instead of their preserves.

Cooked the sausage first, and drained off grease, then added veggies, along with a small clove of garlic.  Left out tomatos and reduced ginger to 1t.  Used apple cider vinegar and strawberry preserves, and only about a half cup of pineapple, adding a little juice and water to make more of a sauce and deglaze the pan.  Easy, quick, and good stuff.

I grew up eating this, and now it's one of my family's favorite recipes. I can actually get my 4 year old son to eat vegetables, lol! When I don't have much time or if I don't have the produce on hand, I use frozen stir-fry veggies, and it's still fantastic! I do cut back on the ginger by about half, though, otherwise the 4 year old will say it's too spicy.

Enjoyed this dish - hubby gave it 3 stars b/c of the sweet/salty aspect as well as not enough flavor.  Daughter gave it 4 stars and I would as well - this was easy and had great flavor - served over herbed, veg rice.  Looking forward to leftovers as well!

did not care for this. Unless you really love ginger then please cut down on the amount. The ginger was overwhelming in this dish.
