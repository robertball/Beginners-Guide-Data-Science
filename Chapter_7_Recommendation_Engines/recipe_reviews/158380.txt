1. This recipe calls for way too much vodka.  I doubled the recipe and added 3 cups of vodka (2.5 cups at 80 proof and 0.5 cup at 100 proof).  As I was making the alfredo, I accidentally forgot about it and let the sauce spill over onto a gas burner.  The whole pot caught on fire!  Even with that event and letting the sauce simmer for an extra 20 minutes, the sauce still had too much vodka in it.  
Recommendation: Add 1/2 the amount vodka and taste to see if you need more.  
2.  The sauce was very runny and not thick.  No recommendation for this one

This turned out okay. Even though I only added the recommended 1/2 cup of vodka I thought it was an overwhelming alcohol flavor. I was surprised at how much better it tasted the next day though!

My family really liked this dish.  I added Parmesan and risotto cheese and it just turned it out.

I also agree that the sauce had a bit too much Vodka in it. Perhaps cutting it down to less than a cup of Vodka will not only take out the powerful alcohol flavor but also with the soupy sauce that never stiffened to a nice, thick pasta sauce.

I've made this recipe for almost 6 years now. The only thing I do different is use penne noodles.

Really nice lighter cream sauce (lighter than a traditional Alfredo). Made with fresh spinach fettuccini, steamed broccoli and grilled chicken

I made this, just without the vodka, and it was amazing. Put it over mushroom stuffed ravioli with a side of Broccoli Rabe! Really great recipe, super easy; I will definitely be making this again.

This Alfredo was great! I will definitely make this again in the future. I loved the garlic with vodka combo.
