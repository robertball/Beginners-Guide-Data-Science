I loved this recipe because it's so easy to prepare and the results are a juicy, delicious chicken with a hint of rosemary and lemon.  Wonderful!

Very Good,  I cooked it a little longer than the recipie said and the meat was falling off the bones when it was done. Very tender and juicy. I also used russet potatoes since I had no red potatoes on hand, but they still came out very good.

This recipe was delicious!  I roasted some carrots along with the potatos. My husband and daughter thought it was very good.  I will make this again soon!
