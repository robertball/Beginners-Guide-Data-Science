Really easy to make refreshing change to spice up chicken breasts.  Our kids aren't big on spicy foods yet but they love the salsa without the jalapeno

This was good, I added fresh parsley and left out the kiwi, and used leeks because that's what I had on hand.

Very pretty and tasty. I used red onion because I couldn't find sweet onion in the store. I added a tiny bit of sugar to compensate for not having the  sweet onion. I served this over chicken.. I cut back on the jalapeno because I am a heat wimp, but I actually could have used the full amount. The fruits cooled the heat considerably
