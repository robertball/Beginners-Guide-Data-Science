The secret to a good tasting gravy is two things.  #1 - lightly browning your roux and #2 - the flavor of your pan drippings.  For more flavor, I did mix in more pan drippings with my broth.  Very good.

Just stupendous. The first time, I used dried sage and it was terrific. I used real broth. The second time, I used bouillon broth and it was not as good. Stick with the real stuff. I also did not ever add the giblets, since I find eating innards to be somewhat unappetizing. Note that this recipe will only really supply a very small group with gravy, about 2 people -- at least double it if serving any amount of people at all.

I am 60 years old and have tried every giblet gravy recipe known to man and never been satisfied with the result. THIS one is PERFECT!! I did end up having to had a touch of cornstarch to get it to thicken enough, but other than that - for the first time - wonderful!

most excellent!  just like Grandma's.  Just DO NOT add the liver, the flavor is too strong.  Also, if you can,  use more drippings and broth (we love our gravy).  This is my Dad's comment, my Grandma would always grind, not chop, the giblets.  Personally,  I don't care, but he does.  That's Dads for ya!  And yah,  other review was right,  you must brown your roux before you add the juice, makes all the difference.  Love sage!  Forgot to mention, DOH!  Simmer giblets in water or stock with onion, celery, bay leaf, sage, pepper corns for about half to hour before chopping/grinding.

I substituted about a cup of milk for part of the stock, because I like a creamy gravy.  Worked perfectly, and reminded me of the gravy my grandmother always used to make.

Came out really great, just like grandma use to make, adding the giblet adds so much flavor, I also added finely chopped celery and onion. The bomb!!! over the grilled turkey, the potatoes and dressing.

Super good and very easy! Not sure why anyone has had a problem with it not thickening up...mine worked fine...even had to add a touch more broth since my husband likes it a bit on the thinner side.  I might even try making it without the giblets next time. I did not even need to add any salt and I left out the sage since I didn't have any on hand. I also added onion as someone else recommended. It was still fantastic!   My kids loved it...even the one who is VERY picky and hates ANY type of gravy liked this one a lot.  Will certainly use this one again!

This gravy turned out fantastic. I made this for my first Thanksgiving and my only complaint is operator error. I had to keep adding more and more flour and more and more dripping because the mix would NOT turn golden brown. Again, operator error. I ended up having to cook for 30 min instead of 15 but it was absolutely delicious!! BTW I did not use giblets and it was still GREAT. This is my go to gravy from now on!!

I quadrupled this. Came out perfect. TIP: I use the remains of this gravy as the thickener in my Turkey Noodle Stoup. That's why I make so much. Also, if you use a slurry of cornstarch and chicken/turkey stock, this works a lot better than flour.

I think I added too much flour when I was browning my roux because my gravy ended up being the consistency of pudding. Next time I'll just have to add more water or stock if I do that. It's a delicious recipe, though.

Very good gravy and so easy!  I did add extra turkey drippings for more flavor and doubled the recipe to go with the huge vat of mashed taters I had made.  Its impossible to mess this one up!

This is the kind of recipe I love. After making a batch of homemade pan gravy, I wonder why anyone would even CONSIDER buying it in the jar? This is so good. Very easy. The picture I'm uploading is the chunky version, containing small bits of sage and cooked giblets. Next time, I might blend it so the gravy is super-smoothe. But it's good this way, too. I'll make it again.

Excellent and easy!  For the stock I boiled the neck and giblets in 6 cups of broth seasoned with white onion, sage, thyme, rosemary, and black pepper for about an hour until it reduced to about 3 cups of liquid.  I also doubled the flour and drippings to maximize the flavor and get the thickness just right.  Everyone loved it!

My fiance had high expectations for giblet gravy this year for Thanksgiving because his mom always made "the best".  I've never made giblet dressing before, so I tried this recipe with high hopes.  I was not disappointed!!!  My gravy didn't thicken up enough, so I threw in some cornstarch (mixed with a little water) and it thickened right up perfectly.  Great, rich taste!!!  This recipe is a keeper!

I used canned chicken stock instead of the turkey stock, though next year I'll make a batch of turkey stock before hand.  Excellent Giblet Gravy!  I'd cut back the ground black pepper by half though, 1/2 teaspoon was a little overpowering for my tastes, the sage was just right.  Will make this again!

I added this gravy recipe with the Savory Turkey Gravy and it tasted great!!! ***UPDATE*** Rather than adding the Savory Turkey Gravy, I added a package of dry brown gravy. IT WAS AWESOME!!! I can't make gravy even if my life depended on it but with the addition of the packaged brown gravy powder and a little cornstarch to thicken, this recipe is a definite keeper for all my big holiday meals.

Made recipe exactly as stated but used poultry seasoning instead of sage.  Good standard way to make gravy.

Terrific little recipe.  I thought I'd made enough for the 7th fleet, and it was gone almost before I sat down!  Very, very tasty.

Tasted great, but I had nowhere near 2.5 cups of turkey drippings (minus fat), so I added some water with chicken boullion.

This was pretty tasty! I doubled the batch and added about tablespoon of dried rubbed sage. I was afraid the gravy would be too white, but it was not.

This gravy had a fantastic taste, but I'd leave out the giblets.  I've never made giblet gravy so I wasn't sure how to "prepare" the giblets.  I read on another site to boil them for an hour.  I did that and put them into the gravy.  I'm not sure they added any flavor, but it added some "chewy" stuff to it.  Maybe my giblets were overcooked...not sure...  With that being said, everything besides the giblets was great.  I'll probably make again, but will just leave out the giblets.

Easier than the gravy I had been making for years where I had to slowly add a milk/flour mixture which eventually would turn into cement by the end of dinner (made me wonder what it did to my insides). Tastes YUMMY too! Missed a star because I did add about a teaspoon of cornstarch when the gravy wasn't thickening up enough for me, even after sitting for a while per the recipe. Didn't have to add much salt. Will make again !

I've never made a good gravy until now. I added a diced onion and used all of my pan drippings, using only a bit of reconstituted chicken soup base (had no turkey stock). Omitted the innards since my turkey didn't have those included. The gravy itself was a deep, rich brown since I had basted my turkey with melted butter and honey. It was so good! Will be using this whenever I need gravy.

I loved this recipe, dont listen to other people about the additional flour needed as I added less than a tablespoon extra and it became way to think. Just make sure you make the roux properly and you will be fine.  I left out the giblets from the gravy, but I did use them to make the stock that made the gravy.

this is what i know to be giblet gravy from family holiday dinners... and this time i made it!  i doubled the recipe for i was feeding more than 6 i used all the innards, if i had kept to the original serving size i probably would have used only half the liver but with doubling i used all. I did pick meat off the neck and actually left the neck in the gravy as a request from my brother..ha. and i did add some cornstarch to thicken in a bit.  everybody loved it and the neck was a fun topic.  hehe

I cooked all the giblets in broth as specified but only added the liver for the last 10 minutes so it isn't overcooked. It's a little bit of trouble removing the meat from the neck but well worth it. I also chopped the giblets finely. I used the broth form cooking the giblets to make the gravy. It was delicious. The result wa

Nice and easy gravy. I prefer a cornstarch with water mix to flour and drippings. I made it both ways and it's much easier with cornstarch. I used a little less pepper and sage. Perfect compliment to my slow cooker turkey.

I'm not a gravy person but you can't have Thanksgiving turkey without gravy, you'd have a riot on your hands!  However, this recipe was quite tasty and super easy.  Even my stepmom who hates organ meat liked it.  I made stock from the giblets and then pureed the stock and giblets before mixing them into the roux.  I didn't find it to be too bland but then again I used tons of garlic in my turkey brine and my stock was well-seasoned.

I had to add more flour to thicken it. Still looking for the perfect gravy recipe.

Excellent flavor and very easy to make. I also added an egg, otherwise I wouldn't change the recipe a bit. Thank you!

Tasted good but the liquid-to-flour ratio was off: I ended up having to thicken with more cornstarch after the simmering time because it just didn't get thicker.

My hubby made the gravy yesterday for Thanksgiving. It was very tasty and easy to prepare. Consistency was just right. Much better than any gravy from a jar. We didn't have any sage on hand so he substituted thyme instead. I made sure he didn't have any lumps prior to turning the heat up by using a hand blender. Will definitely be preparing in the future.

Our gravy turned out perfect!!  We aren't fans of sage, so I left it out.  I'm not an expert on gravy making, but in the absence of our mom at this dinner, this recipe performed perfectly!!  Sorry Mom, the potatoes didn't miss you at all!! LOL

This gravy is much better than any canned or powdered gravy I have ever tried.  I added the giblets while cooking, but strained and pressed them through a sieve before serving so that the gravy had a nice smooth consistency, but still had all of the flavour.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This gravy is delish!!  This photo shows the gravy before I added more water to it the next day to the left overs.  So it's a little thick in this photo but it tasted so good!  My kids gobbled it all up!  The next day I used the gravy for turkey pot pies and I added water to the gravy when I reheated it over the stove.  I was kicking myself for not adding more water in the first place but now I know for next time.  It's probably important to note that I made four times the recipe in one sitting - so that might be why it came out so thick. Anyway enjoy this!  It's so dang good.  I was heavy handed with the drippings and the giblets!

Good, but I recommend sifting the flour to prevent lumps. Be sure to use a skillet, not regular pan.

I had to add corn starch to make it thicken enough to be "gravy" consistency, but the flavor was fantastic!

I read others reviews. First time making giblet gravy.  This recipe should include how to cook the giblets - I googled it (pioneer woman).  Boil giblets about 45 minutes.  take as much neck meat off as you can.  finely chop this and other giblets (all parts) finely.  
1.  I suggest using low sodium broth as mine was too salty.  
2.  I think I ended up using almost double the drippings to get the flavor where I wanted it.  
3.  I only used half the giblets and that was enough to please a crowd.  I think too much would turn some people off.   I had a jarred gravy as an emergency back up, let others taste test both and everyone chose this!  Good first go at it!

This was my favorite dish at Thanksgiving. I also added chopped bell pepper and half of a yellow onion. Tastes fantastic over rice. I also used Chicken Stock because that's all I had on hand. Tasted absolutely wonderful.
