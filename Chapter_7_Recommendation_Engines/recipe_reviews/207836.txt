A delicious and easy appetizer! I did make a few changes.. In the filling, I added 2 tablespoons of cream cheese, 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, salt and almost the whole can of crab meat, since 1/2 the can did't seem like very much. I also baked the wonton cups for about 7 minutes before I filled them to make sure they stayed crispy. I warmed the filling first, then filled the cups and baked about 5-6 minutes. Scallions on top made it taste very fresh- I love this recipe and it was a perfect choice for Easter (or any other occasion!) :)

I really liked these, they come together really fast and had good flavor. My only suggestions are for personal preference: add cayenne for kick. bake the won ton shells longer to make them crispier on the bottom, heat up filling to get it closer to melting so you don't burn won ton edges when doing the second bake.

I mostly heard  "crunch, crunch" through dinner and my kids liked it alot (lucky me they like cream spinach with artichoke).  The filling was so yummy and I added some cream cheese to it.  I might try some butter on the edges of the wonton skin next time.

Very tasty and a recipe that you can have all ingredients on hand.  I did not have a mini muffin pan, they worked fine in a regular muffin pan, I just used more filling.  They were a big hit with my kids and would be great for a party appetizer as well.

I make these all the time for our dinner parties. But instead of using crab I use chicken breast since some people dont like crab. You do have to be careful about not burning the wontons on the second time in the oven. Just keep close eye on them and you will be fine

Great recipe.  I made the first time as listed and enjoyed.  The next time I was in a bit of a time crunch with a last minute dinner party.  Added the filling to pre-made phyllo cups and just broiled to heat through.  Perfect for the last minute appetizer

I did not include artichokes but used yellow onions instead. It was so good!

I forgot to get the spinach at the store and added about 1/2 cup of cream cheese. We tried this as a side dish at dinner and everybody loved it. My daughter had fun making it with me and was proud of the outcome!

Great recipe!  I followed some of the other suggested changes and added cream cheese and more than doubled the crab meat.  I also added a little extra spinach, using 3/4 a package instead of just half.
The mixture would also be fantastic as a warm dip or even served cold.

I added more crab and used fresh spinach. I also diced up some water chestnuts for a crunch.  If I make these again Iâ€™m goin to cut way down on the cheese. Like half. If the crab is supposed to be the star the cheeses overpowered the flavor.

Thesse were very good and versatile.  Nice base recipe you can adjust to your own flavor combination.
