With the dill alone, this can be alittle bland.  I fried and drained a few slices of bacon and crumbled them into the cream cheese along with green onions.  Then I shaped the cream cheese into a 1 inch high cylinder shape and sprinkled the dill and a dash of garlic powder on top.  After covering the cheese with the dough, I opened another pkg. of crescent rolls and made a beautiful leaf design on top.  Glazed with milk instead of egg (more shiny) and received RAVE REVIEWS!!!

Sooooooo easy! I LOADED the cream cheese with dill weed and garlic powder. I didn't measure at all, just made sure it was completely covered. I lightly pressed the seasonings into the cream cheese before wrapping as well. I used milk instead of egg yolk on the dough. This turned out beautifully and all of my guests raved! I ended up making this for several parties because friends and family requested it! Will definitely make again and again.

This is very good. I don't care for dill, as a substitute I used Hidden Valley Ranch Dips packet as the seasoning and served with Ritz Sticks.

This was great.  I love cream cheese and this was a great way to enjoy it.  The cresent roll dough goes great with the cream cheese.  I used fresh dill, and was very generous with it.  I also used garlic powder, and that gave it a good kick.  Make sure you seal it well.  Mine came open, but the cheese didn't leak out so it was ok.  The best part about this recipe is that the options are endless.  Next time I think I will put lox in the middle of the cream cheese and dill on the outside.

I had used this recipe for a holiday party.  It was so popular I had to make one more batch while everyone was there.  

I changed the recipe a little though.  I didn't serve it with the apples and crackers.  I made this appetizer into cream cheese bites by wrapping the cream cheese totally in the cresent rolls (like a present) and cut it in bites when it came out of the oven and had cooled down.  I served it with Marinara sauce.  It was the most popular appetizer at my party.

I really did not expect to like this, but I will make this again and again.  I added some chopped green onions and just flipped the whole thing over on the cookie sheet so even if it opened up while baking the cheese would have nowhere to go. I think I will add green olives the next time.

Made this for a Super Bowl party at Church.  Received alot of complements.  I added garlic powder as well.  Next time I will add more dill.  Very easy and looks like you put a great deal of work into it. Will make it again!!

Very easy and very tasty.  I added the garlic powder as recommended by others.  I also put raspberry preserves on one half and left the other plain.  While both sides were enjoyed, the half with the raspberry preserves was a big hit!  I will do that on the whole thing from now on!  Very yummy!

Made this for a party and everyone LOVED it. I took everyone's hints and added loads of flavour - bacon, olive bits, chilli flakes etc. It helped to cut slits in the cheese and insert flavours in between the slits. Also made one version with salmon flavoured cream cheese - just added dill and everyone loved it. So easy, pretty and fun to present.
For 'crackers' - I used flavoured rice chips instead.

Very good and about as simple as it gets.  I think next time I make this I might slice the cream cheese block up in two or three long slices and put the spices in between each layer when I put it bak together, that way there are more spices throughout the dip rather than on just the top and bottom... just an idea :)

I couldn't figure out for the life of me how to make this work, so I made a bite size variation where I mixed the cream cheese & dill together, spread it over the crescents and cut into bite size pieces before baking. Not exactly the same purpose of this recipe, but it was the best I could do.

Instead of dill, I added chopped garlic (I used 2 cloves) and toasted almonds; I then folded it and baked it as stated.

Very easy to make & delicious.  As suggested by other reviews, I spiced it up a little by adding chives & garlic powder.  Took to a party this weekend & everyone asked for the recipe.

I loved it and so easy. I would not hesitate to use other herbs or even add them. I liked the ides of slicing the cheese lengthwise to have the dill throughout.

THIS IS A GREAT SIMPLE ELEGANT APPETIZER. TRY ADDING GORGONZOLA CHEESE CRUMBLES, WITHOUT THE DILL, TO YOUR BRICK. OH MY GOD!!! IT IS GREAT.

I didn't like this at all! It tasted like cream cheese in a roll. I was thinking it would be great because of all the rave reviews but was very disappointed.

Simple, but incredibly tasty!  You can also brush it with milk instead of egg yolk for the same shiny effect.

i love the idea, but i would make many modifications because that is just way too much cream cheese for me. i would use way less cream cheese, more dill and also garlic powder and make smaller sizes

For a sweet version of this appetizer, try this twist. Instead of using dill weed, add 3/4 cup powdered sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the cream cheese. After baking, sprinkle with powdered sugar using a sifter.

A word of warning, make two batches. One won't be enough!

I've tried this recipe three times, and every time it has been a HIT! Everyone asks for the recipe, and they're always floored by how simple it is. Just remember to serve it immediately so the cream cheese is nice and gooey!

Easy but impressive - made for Christmas Eve at a friend's house.  Dusted the cream cheese with garlic powder and lots of dill weed on both sides, couldn't believe the results and raves!

Very tasty with a few changes.  I made a homemade ranch dressing seasoning and then used that to place inside the block of cream cheese by slicing it in 1/2 lengthwise.  I also covered the outside of the cream cheese with the seasoning.  Very good!

Excellent!  Just made it today and the entire family LOVES it!  I took the advice of another reviewer and sliced the cream cheese lengthwise creating 2 layers. I then sprinkled both layers (on both sides)with dill, ranch dip (dry) and garlic powder.  Also used remaining crescent dough to make small shapes and placed on top of dough.  Wonderful!

I changed the recipe a bit.  For flavor, I added pepper jelly, rosemary and dried orange peal.
This was my brother's favorite dish on Thanksgiving.

Very fast and easy appetizer. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and dill to the cream cheese then formed it into the shape I wanted before wrapping it with the crescent dough. I also cut out leaf shapes to place on top before brushing with the milk as suggested.It looked and tasted wonderful.

Neat idea.  I read the other reviews and decided that I may try something with more taste so I pulled a jar of Ginger Preserves out of my fridge and sprinkled a bit of Cayenne Pepper over it instead of using Dill and we just loved it.  I also think that using PepperJack Cheese with jam of any sort would be a neat recipe.  I'm trying that next.  I love the recipe idea and it is so versitale to peoples tastes when you pick flavors you enjoy with cheese.  Thanks for the post!

This was very good...I also am not a huge dill weed fan, so I limited it.  The result was amazing.  Friends and family both enjoyed.  Thanks for the post.

I really loved this!  It was easy, although you have to be careful to seal the dough.  I just used dill and at first bite, both my husband and I thought it was a little bland.  

However, we couldn't STOP eating it!  We ate the whole thing ourselves.  I will try adding the garlic powder next time, but there WILL definitely be a next time!

My sister made as an appetizer for my dad's birthday.  It was really good.  I don't think she added all the dill (on my suggestion, but I think afterall it could've been added).  If I ever make this, I will blend the cream cheese with A LOT of fresh minced garlic and some dill and then wrap it in the crescent roll.

I didn't have time to make this for our appetizer party, so I had my husband do it. It turned out great-I had him add a little garlic powder and extra dill as previously suggested and it was highly complimented. In retrospect, I should have explained to my husband that the egg is just a glaze, he brushed some on, then dumped the rest over it. It still turned out OK.

seriously, it is a little embarassing how good and how easy this recipe is.  everyone asked for "the recipe", as if there was really anything to it.  i covered the cream cheese with dill & garlic powder, both sides.  also, i smooshed the dough together to make a square, folding up the corners to add a little frill on top.  very delicious.

I've been making this for years - but, since I'm not a dill fan, I sprinkle the cheese with chives or green onions instead. You can jazz it up for company by cutting out a shape from additional dough and sticking it on the top, or adding dough leaves around the base. Easiest thing in the world.

This was fabulous!  I sprinkled both sides of the cheese block with dill and added about a teaspoon of crushed garlic to both sides.  I served it on the deck to guests while I washed some dishes.  All I could hear from the kitchen was "oooohs and ahhhhhs"!  FABULOUS and incredibly easy, I almost felt guilty.

Made this for a family gathering and added garlic powder and onion powder along with a liberal amount of the dill. I used puff pastry for the dough surround and just made the extra pieces of pastry dough into leaf shapes and sprinkled them with sea salt and garlic powder and threw them onto the sheet with the cheese 'brick'. Since I have gluten issues and cheese issues, I could not eat it, but judging from the family reaction, it was a hit. There was NOTHING left even before dinner was over. This recipe received rave reviews by all parties. I will definitely be making this again...and adding the bacon like a reviewer suggested.

This is such an inexpensive, simple recipe, but it goes over so well every time I serve it!  A friend called it "Poorman's Baked Brie", lol but let me say that there's always leftovers when I make baked brie, and with this baked cream cheese I have to make TWO!! I have shaped it like a bunny for Easter, a wreath for Christmas, or just a basic rectangle. Oh, and I do always add garlic powder.

This was really good!  I added garlic powder and green onion with the dill. I then whipped up the mixture to incorporate the seasonings throughout before placing in the crescent wrap. Delish!  Reminded me of a Hot Sam's pretzel with cream cheese! YUM!

I've been making this for years for various get-togethers and it's always well received! This is a nice change fron the traditional baked brie as well as being more economical. I think I got the recipe from a brand names cookbook or something. It's really great and can easily be seasoned to your liking. :)

I spread about 1 teaspoon of minced garlic on the cream cheese, and then used lots of fresh dill.  It was gone in a flash!

Not good. Too much cream cheese. I have a similar recipe that uses Brie and pesto instead of cream cheese and dill.  Give it a try.

I've been making this appetizer for 6 years and I am just now reviewing it. It is fabulous! It is so easy. I usually have all the ingredients (there are so few) on hand for drop-in guests or the big game. No one can keep their hands out of this dip. I serve with Ritz crackers.

This recipe was ok. it was just too much cream cheese. I cut the cream cheese block in half the next time I made it and liked it better. Not sure if it's something I'll try again or not but it is something different to have.

This is such an easy appetizer but no one will ever guess how simple it really is!  I added dry ranch dressing, garlic powder, and the dill.  (and lots of it!) I also cut out little shapes from extra dough and placed on top.  It looked very professional.  It was the hit at Christmas, and only lasted about 5 minutes.  The next time I made it I had to make two!

I served this at a party and everyone loved it! I didn't have dill weed on hand, so I sprinkled the cream cheese with garlic powder, onion powder and a little bit of celery salt. I served it with pita chips and garlic ritz. DELISH!

The kids loved it the first time around, however, the next time I made it, I mashed the dill into the cream cheese. Gave a much stronger flavor throughout.
Third time I added diced red pepper to the outside of the dough after I brushed it with milk. This gave the dough flavor and the presentation was picture perfect!

So easy and it is gone within minutes every time I make it! I like to experiment with tastes, I used garlic powder instead of dill and it was just as good. I think that this is such a versital recipe that you can do anything with it! Thanks!

What a very pretty appetizer, but the cheese in the middle was cold and it was very doughy. I had to put it back in the oven to try and finish it, but then the other parts of the crescent burned...It was very great tasting though, the parts that turned out right.

I had this for a dinner party as an appetizer. I was really disappointed. The cream cheese didn't melt. I don't think the dill offered much flavor as well. It became cold very quickly too.

I mixed cream cheese with some apples I had cooked in cinnamon and sugar and added that as the filling and it was a delicious, and not-too-sweet dessert that I would definately make again.
