My mother's recipe for corn relish had been lost. I had always enjoyed it. If this recipe isn't the one she used it is a very close one. Great balance of flavor with modest sweet and sour.

my husband's grandmother use to make this corn relish, it has been a favorite for years.  However due to a fire we thought we lost the recipe, after making this we were thankful to find it!
