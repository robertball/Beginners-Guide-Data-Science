The recipe worked well. No problems with rolling or dryness. I made a couple of changes: added the 1/4 of yogurt, but mine was fat free, Greek style, vanilla flavored; also omitted 1/2 cup of sugar as another reviewer suggested; encrusted in rainbow sprinkles (made them sweet but not TOO sweet - please see pix); added 1tsp almond extract instead of vanilla. This helped with that blandness someone else mentioned. I liked them very much and would definitely recommend this recipe. Oh, and also added pink food coloring to make them a little more festive for my 4 year old. If anyone would like to add food coloring to their dough, please add to the wet mixture and then add the flour.

Delicious! They turned out beautifully! They were fluffy and light and you couldn't tell they were "healthier" =D

This is a very simple sugar cookie recipe.  I used slightly less sugar as someone else suggested - maybe an 1/8 cup less.  The texture is great and it is a soft cookie.  I had no problems rolling the dough into a ball.  I put sprinkles on the cookies too.  My husband loved them and they will be in his lunch bag tomorrow.

They came out delicious. I did have a slight hiccup with the batter though; it came out really gooey, and thus hard to ball up. It may have been due to the lack of butter. I might suggest adding another tablespoon or two of butter, OR going with a greek yogurt that contains a little fat (I used 0%).

The flavor and taste were pretty good; there's no reminder that they're "low-fat" as I eat them--however, the texture was like that of a small biscuit rather than a cookie. I'm thinking that this is due to the baking soda that was added in the recipe. Next time, I'll omit the baking soda and add a little more baking powder instead. Kind of a disappointment.

Great recipe. Very soft and tasty, and great with milk or coffee. I omitted the vanilla, used only 1 cup of sugar, substituted low-fat vanilla yogurt instead of the non-fat, and used whole-wheat flour. The batter was a tad dry, so I added 2 tablespoons more of yogurt.

I really liked this recipe-- the cookies have a great soft texture.  I did adjust per a few other reviewer's suggestions and used some ww flour and reduced the sugar to one cup.  I also used non fat plain greek yogurt as that's what I had on hand.  A keeper for sure!

Used whole-wheat flour, 1/2 c. packed brown sugar, 1/2 c. white sugar. Instead of vanilla, substituted 1 T. matcha (green tea) powder mixed in 1 t. water and beat into egg before adding to butter mixture. Dipped tops of cookies into black sesame seeds before baking. Would add green food coloring next time because cookies were brown, but delicious!

These were delicious and so easy. I  used non-fat Greek yogurt and half whole wheat flour, as well as reducing the sugar to 1 cup.  First batch turned out a little dark and crispy so I turned the temperature down to 350 degrees and then they were perfect! Soft, chewy and great flavor.

Amazing recipe!!!! I didn't need nearly as much flour as the recipe called for though. I used about a cup and 1/2 less. I also used stevia instead of sugar. They turned out great though!

I really liked the recipe! 
The only thing that I did was that I added some cinnamon; about 3 teaspoons; and also before baking them I pressed them with a fork, because the first time I baked them the balls didn't turn into cookies, they remained balls.

These cookies were amazing! They rose beautifully and we're so soft! I used Chobani lemon yogurt instead of plain yogurt. It added a subtle hint of lemon that really put some pep in these cookies.

I agree that it makes it healthier when you replace butter with non-fat yogurt but there is 1 1/2 cups of sugar.So sadly I am not making this batch again even though they were absolutely delicious.

These wern't cookies so much as heavy balls.  They didn't flatten at all and the dough was dry.  I was very hopeful about these, and yet very dissapointed.

I actually made this with whole wheat flour and it came out delicious! I was tempted to try it with Stevia, but decided to stick to the real sugar. Texture came out very similar to a regular sugar cookie and the taste was there! Will make again...

Were really good- made with 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar. Made with regular flour, wouldn't try to make with whole wheat flour as it would've been too many changes. Flavor was good with healthier sugar cookie icing.

I tried this recipe twice. The first time I did it, I followed one review to use just a cup of sugar and because I had no plain yogurt at that time, I used strawberry flavored yogurt. It wasn't too bad but was not appealing either. This afternoon, I tried it again and used applesauce instead of butter and used low fat vanilla yogurt this time.  The dough will be too soft to handle so I used spoon to mold it and baked it for 10 mins. It was too soft so the rest of the batch was baked for at least 12 mins. I also sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top - healthier snickerdoodles. My twins loved it.

The cookie tasted more like a biscuit. The dough was quite dry so I added more yogurt. I had cut down the sugar to 1 cup because I wanted to add Smarties. Not my favourite sugar cookie from this site.

Will so make again. I made them with my teenage dtr. The batter is so yummy.  We did not have eggs so insted used  3Tbs of egg whites from a carton. Made sure to ration out the dough (what was left of it) to make exactly 48 cookies-so we could stay in the 70cal/cookie range!
Great recipe. Quick & easy.

This is an excellent recipe!  The cookies turned out soft and chewy.  It was great!  If you plan on eating more than 3 cookies in one sitting, then I definitely recommend you use less sugar (maybe 1 cup).  And if you’re having trouble mixing the dough, add 1-2 tablespoons more of the yogurt.  These were a lot of fun to make with someone else.  We’d definitely recommend you try it!

I make my own vanilla so that makes the taste a little stronger, and also used almond extra. I liked the flavor.

We made these into snickerdoodles by rolling the dough in cinnamon sugar. Be sure to press them flat because they won't flatten by themselves.

AMAZING COOKIES! They stay so soft and chewy. I put vanilla ice cream with fresh fruit on top... Heaven!

the dough for these cookies is amazing!I changed the recipe I bit by using 1 and 1/4 cup brown sugar and only 1/4 cup of white sugar. I used 3 cups of flour, 2 eggs, and about 1/2 cup of low fat yogurt (I bought vanilla yogurt to enhance the flavor). ill defiantly use this recipe again

These are alright. Not quite as sweet as I'd have liked, and a bit bready, as someone else said. When my boyfriend tried one he said "this tastes like a ####ing biscuit."

Good, but more like bread than cookies. I personally love the bready texture of cookies, but don't think others would like it as much.

This recipe turned out wonderfully!  I substituted 1/4 cup + 2-3 teaspoons of vanilla low-fat Greek yogurt in place of the plain yogurt and they're just delightful!

I substituted half whole wheat flower, added walnuts and dried blueberries.  The dough seemed a bit dry, but a couple of tablespoons of milk fixed that.

Nice, simple, not too sweet. I used lowfat strawberry yogurt(all I had), and rolled each in sugar before baking. Made 36. Still not too sweet, slightly crackled on top, easy to apply icing if needed, DO NOT over bake, take out earlier fine but never late. My yogurt gave a different flavor but I do wish I had used a little more to add to the flavor and texture. Slightly bland, but an easy to alter recipe. Nice but not phenomenal.
