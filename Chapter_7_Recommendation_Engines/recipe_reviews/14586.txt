I looked at this recipe because I was just curious...what the heck was it?? I am so glad I did. I was looking for different varieties that would fill my 6'8" husband and satisfy my picky palate. I followed the some of the reviewers advice and added a can of tomatoes to the mix (as well as a dash of minced garlic!)and had preseasoned the meat with Lawry's and garlic salt. I was not paying attention and I didn't add the noodles to the mixture, I put the mixture on top of the noodles, and I rather liked this as it made it less casseroley. I also followed the suggestion and added grated cheddar cheese on top of the mix. My husband devoured the ENTIRE meal,except for my serving (so much for leftovers) and has been asking for it again. :)

This was a good recipe with a few variations. I added diced tomatoes instead of tomato soup and then I topped the dish with shredded cheddar and swiss cheese. It was yummy!

I've been making this recipe for years, but topped with cheddar cheese.  I sometimes throw in a package of onion soup mix for some zip.  It's a real family favourite...and now I have a fun name for it.

When I saw that people actually made this I laughed, before we were married, my husband used to make this for his four little kids when he was on his own and broke. Instead of the corn he made it with brown beans and everyone loved it, there was never a lick left in the pot. My husband  makes it for me now and I love it as well. I used to laugh at the name, but it sure fit. Thanks for making something so simple shine.

Quick, simple, and filling. A nice weeknight meal. Kid friendly too. I had to add another 1/2 can of soup as it was just too dry otherwise, but this was good and we enjoyed it. This would be great for camping. I added a bit of season all and fresh ground black pepper to the meat. Thanks for a nice hearty meal that we'll probably have again as I always keep those items on hand.

This is a good recipe, but my family felt that it needed more tomato soup to give it more moistness.

This is my standard recipe for stuffig blanched bell peppers!!  I saute the meat mixture with minced onions and LOTS of garlic.  After stuffing peppers, bake in 350 oven until heated and the top is crusted, approximately 20 - 30 minutes.

By itself, I thought this bland, but as a base I thought it great. This time I added taco seasoning and sour cream along with chopped onion and crushed garlic. Yum.

It's pretty good for how cheap, easy, and fast it is to make. I doubt it will blow anyone away with it's flavor, but, for what it is, it's a good recipe. I agree with other reviewers though. Italian herbs and/or garlic in moderation would improve the recipe.

I'm giving this 4 stars only because when I made it the first time, it was very bland.  I thought it was a great base recipe, so I tried it again, this time adding garlic powder, minced onions and garlic pepper when browning the meat.  I then added 4 oz feta cheese to the dish after adding the noodles, and then my family gobbled it all up!!  I think the feta was the ticket!!  Easy and quick meal, and I generally have all these ingredients on hand! Thanks!

I took some suggestions of previous reviewers... ended up changing the recipe by: sauteing beef with onions and garlic.  Used 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes, 1 small can of tomato sauce, added pepper, basil and oregano. Used white corn and 8 oz. of shells.  IT was tastier than i thought it would be.  I will make again, next time i will try to cut back on the pasta a bit and see what i think.

Recipe is super fast and good base...I added onion powder(kids don't like chunks), cracked pepper, cheddar cheese soup along with 1/2 cup of water.  I also threw in some crushed red pepper flakes for zip.

This was ok. Something easy to serve the kids.  I omitted the corn and used cheddar instead of parmesan.  It needed salt.  We added garlic salt at the dinner table, but if I make this again I will stir it in ahead.  It probably would have helped if I had salted my noodle water.

omg this is so bland and dry. I followed exactly. To try and salvage it I added tomatoes and garlic like the other reviewers said and it made it more palatable, but yuck, this is really bad.

This was very easy and delicious. I didnt think that one can of soup was enough but didnt have another so I added about 1/2 of a cup of ketchup and it turned out with the right consistency. I would use about 1.5 cans of soup next time. I also used cheddar instead of parmesan and added parsley, oregano, and black pepper. Would definitely make again- its great for leftovers.

This was great, and I forgot to put the cheese on top even!  I did, however, add a few things like people suggested (some people said it was bland).  I added 1 clove of minced garlic, a little chopped up celery, and a little chopped onion.  I also didn't have egg noodles so just used shells I had on hand and still tasted great!  I also added just a little water to the tomato soup.

This is a quick and tasty recipe for a worknight meal. I usually cook up some ground beef and leave it in the refrig for easy meals during the week so that even cut down on the cook time.I have to admit when I saw this I thought to myself what a weird combination but I had the ingredients so I gave it a try.  I added a half of can of diced tomatoes, garlic salt and pepper.  When I mixed in the egg noodles I added some Velveta Cheese which I usually have in the house.  The Velveta gave it a nice cheesy finish. This is a keeper!

This is a quick and easy "recipe", so I give it thumbs up for that aspect.  I made the recipe as is, which imo, is the only fair way to rate it accurately.  Made as written, it is passable, but rather bland and lackluster.  If ease of prep is the goal here and if I were going to attempt this again, I would substitute jarred spaghetti sauce for the tomato soup.  Some of the other suggestions for changes made by other posters sound promising, as well.   I can imagine that most children would be very content with the recipe, as written.

I wasn't too crazy about this recipe.  My husband said that he didn't exactly expect the corn.  Maybe noodles and corn might not be my thing.  But I did buy the wrong size of canned corn.  I also bought too big of noodles.  I had to add 4 cans of tomato sauce because of my mistake.  Maybe that's why I wasn't so crazy about it.  Probably my fault.  I probably won't be making this again.

This was a good recipe though I made some changes 1) tomato sauce instead of tomato soup 2) added red onions 3) 3 garlic cloves 4) additional spices to the beef - cumin, cayenne, chili powder 5) No parmesan cheese 6) mixed the beef mixture and noodles and baked in the oven @ 350 for about 10 minutes topped with green peppers and cheddar cheese.

Very easy and affordable yet surprisingly still good. My 3 year old loved it. We substituted spiral noodles, it also needed an extra can of soup and for flavor garlic, salt, and pepper wouldnt hurt. Will make this again.

This is a good family casserole 4 adults liked, and my picky 2 yr old had some! I cooked grd beef with onion and garlic, then added 2 cans mexi-corn and two cans tomato soup. I did add approx. a 1/2 c. of ff sour cream to make it creamy and then put in a covered dish with cheese on top to keep warm for about 30 minutes until dinner.

Kris is my sister and we grew up on this recipe. I make a slight variation. I use Mexican corn and I top the casserole with slices of velveeta cheese and let them melt. I like some of the other variations folks suggested. Just an FYI this recipe is named for Slumgullian Pass in Colorado when our parents were on a camping trip on the pass and threw this together with what they had handy.

I improvised, used a can of tomato sauce and a can of Rotel instead of soup.  Added half an onion and lots of salt and pepper to the meat as it cooked along with some red pepper flakes.  Tossed in a dallop of sour cream and a cup of cheddar, threw it in a baking dish and topped w slices of Velveeta until warmed through.  Most of us added hot sauce to our plated meal for additional flavor.  It was fast and filling so I’d make it again.

I made this with smoked sausage  and the tomato soup the first time.  It was good.  The 2nd time I didn't have the soup, so I used spaghetti sauce.  I added a couple teaspoons of sugar to cut the sharp tomato taste and hubby said he liked it with that change.  We have made this several times for lunch and it's great as a leftover too.

I made a few changes, and it was pretty tasty:
1.  Season beef with 1 tsp. seasoned salt, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder, and 1 Tbsp. dried minced onions while being browned.
2.  Use 1 15 oz can and 1 10.5 oz can of soup.
I think it creates 6 rather than 4 servings.

This recipe is almost identical to the goulash recipe I make, except it uses noodles instead of macaroni. I added garlic,onion, and green pepper to the hamburger as it cooked. I also used spaghetti sauce instead of the tomato soup. I used shredded cheddar cheese in addition to the parmesan on top also. The only reason I tried this recipe,is I had originally wanted to make goulash, and didn't have any macaroni on hand, and had never thought of using noodles instead. As others have said this is a good basic recipe, and you can add whatever your preferences are to make it great. Very good!!

As many others have said, this was a good base recipe.  I doctored it up a fair bit with spices, and mushrooms.  My husband really enjoyed it, and it was very economical. I think next time I will add sour cream as others have suggested.

This recipe was very easy to make and the kids liked it pretty well. It has a lot of potential-you can  make the recipe and add your own twist to it if it's too bland for you. I added 3 kinds of cheese and some garlic seasoning.

This was pretty good.  It was kind of like fancy Hamburger Helper, but I don't mean that in a bad way.  :)  I think next time I will double the tomato soup so it will be a bit creamier, but that was just a personal preference from my family.

This was very tasty and even my picky 3 year old ate two helpings!  I used the tips from other reviewers and added some seasonings to the ground beef, used 2 cans of tomato soup, and topped with shredded cheddar.  I didn't have any corn so I substituted a can of cut green beans and we thought it was good, but would like to try it with the corn.

I was quite skeptical of this recipe as it sounded like it would be bland.  Even though I did add some black pepper and garlic powder, this turned out to be absolutely wonderful!  My roommates "loved" it as well.  It's so quick and easy I'll definately be making it again, thanks!

This recipe is probably better for kids.  It needed some help for an adult's palate.  I added some mexican seasoning and cheddar cheese and this helped.  Definitely is an easy one to make.

This recipe was pretty good; however, I added a large can of diced tomatoes, two beef bouillion cubes and enough water to make it into soup.  My family are really picky eaters and don't care for 'casseroles' but loved this as soup with fresh bread to dip.
