Everyone absolutely loved this!  The potatoes on top were not fully cooked so next time, all potatoes will be underneath the chops.  I also added pre-cooked mushrooms instead of onions.  I seasoned the chops with Montreal Steak seasoning.  I used sharp cheddar for more flavor and doubled what the recipe called for because I'm a cheese freak.  At the end of the baking process, I topped the dish with crushed croutons (I make homemade but I'm sure store bought would be great too) and instead of putting it under the broiler, I baked at 350 for another 15 minutes.  The potatoes were cooked and the croutons didn't burn.  The addition of the croutons definitely upped this from a 4.5 star dish to a 5 star dish.  Would not make it again without them.

This was the perfect recipe in a pinch. I had to substitute whole milk for the half and half, but it didn't affect creaminess of sauce. My whole family enjoyed it, even our picky 3 year old. I used 6 thick cut pork chops and was surprised that everything was cooked thru and perfect. Thanks, I will definitely be making this again!

We really enjoyed this. I think I would like a little more sauce and cheese in the future, but I will definitely be making this again. I have no comparison for a difference in taste, but I used whole-wheat flour instead of white.

What a great comfort food recipe! Fantastic flavors and easy to make. My only small changes were to use regular thickness pork chops, add an extra tablespoon of flour to the sauce and use a combination of thyme and rosemary for seasoning. Happy baking!

Liked it. I think it could have used another 15-20 cook time. Great flavor.

Used the mandolin to slice the potatoes. Used 3 potatoes, 1 onion, 4 chops, extra cheese, and only 1 tsp thyme. Will add rosemary for half the seasoning next time.

This was tasty comfort food! 

I baked it for 50 minutes, covered, and then took the cover off for the remaining 10 minutes. Too lazy to broil.  Not all of the potatoes were cooked through, so next time, I would either bake it for an additional 15 minutes or so, or use my mandoline to slice the potatoes thinner.

We really enjoyed this recipe the only thing that I did different was only 1 teaspoon of thyme.   Also, the recipe didn't say to cover the dish for the baking part of the recipe.  Next time I make this I am going to cover it for the baking and uncover for the broil part.   Our potatoes was a little crunch; but still good.

I combined this recipe with the Herb Pork chop recipe because that was one of my favorites and I was trying to come up with a side dish, I thought of mashed potatoes of course, but saw the scalloped potatoes instead.  My family prefer fried pork chops of course but this went over well, I Loved it myself, maybe too much.

I’ve made this twice.  The first time exactly as written, and it was yummy, but the thyme was a little too strong. The second time I backed off the thyme a little bit and it was better, but will just cut it directly in half next time. Otherwise sooo good.

This was a great dinner mix, plenty of sauce for 3 B/I chops & 3 spuds. It has a really nice " midwestern-supper" appeal, I will def/ make this more, as it keeps the chops nice and juicy. I browned the chops in my all worthy cast iron skillet till perfectly bronzed in the butter, then laid them onto the bed of home sliced potatoes. I used my food processor with Yukons, a yellow onion, and a few fresh serrano peppers from my garden, cleaned of tips and stems. Also I washed off my potatoes with r/o water to get the excess starch out of the potatoes, then air dried them on stacks of roll towel, as they started to dry off I sprinkled them with Pensey's Season Salt. after about 30-45 minutes, then I continued onto layering the scalloped potatoes and the browned chops, My opinion bone in chops is best to add good flavor. I had to add almost 40 minutes to the suggested 1 hour as I like it to get it browned on top BUT NOT BURNED.

this is a keeper recipe for us. we didn't add the cheese because we wanted to keep it lower in fat. we accidently under seasoned when making the casserole but just added some salt when we served it. makes a nice easy throw in the oven and forget it dinner.

Hubby loved this. I thought the potatoes were not quite done. but he like them that way. I will leave out the onions next time because they tasted nearly raw, but again, hubby thought they were fine.  I did cut make the recipe in half, except for the sauce which I only reduced by 1/4.  Next time I will will make the whole amount of sauce or maybe even 150%.  It is sooo good! Will make this again soon! Hubby declared it's is second favorite dish ever!

I had all the ingredients available, so I took a chance on this recipe. It was a great meal and we enjoyed the flavor mix. We always enjoy Dijon mustard. I added 1/4 C chopped red pepper for some color to the potatoes. The meal was simple to serve with it all being in one dish.

Made as written except put all the onions, cheese, and potatoes on the bottom. Used corn starch instead of flour to make gluten free. Used a mandolin to slice potatoes. Delicious!

Ingredients I changed were that I used whole milk and spicy brown mustard as I did not have dijon or half and half.  Cooking time and method I added 15  minutes after reading the reviews and I covered the dish with foil during the 1 hour of  cooking time and chose not to use the broiler. 
The recipe is a do again per my husband however I will not use the full amount of thyme for my tastebuds and will add more cheese. 
4 stars was given because the pork chops were dry and a too thick for the recipe.

My husband liked this dish, I found it way to greasy and I used lean pork chops and milk rather than half and half.  The recipe description mentions 'a hint of thyme', I reduce mine by 2/3 and that was plenty for us.  All that said, I would try this recipe again, but reduce the butter.

I will definitely make this again. It's so tasty and not too rich. The pork is moist. I made very little change. I used bone-in chops because that's what I had. I liked the extra moistness of the bones and the little fat on the edge of the chops, so will probably use bone-in again. Also, we added a tablespoon of Sriracha sauce along with the broth because we like a little kick.  Very delicious. We just added a salad and had a great meal!

This was a little disappointing after reading the reviews. The pork was very dry, even over cooked. While the potatoes were ok the entire cream sauce was greasy and the thyme a bit overpowering. The only plus was that I prepared this at lunch and left instructions for my husband to cook it for dinner when I was away. I doubt that I will make this again.

Made this twice. First time I had to improvise as the ingredients I thought I had on hand turned out I didn't so I had to make substitutions. Out of thyme so subbed with Herbes de Provence. Out of dijon so subbed with honey dijon. Only had half the cheddar (used sharp) cheese so other half was smoked gouda. Also made with pork steaks , not chops. While this was good the pork steaks made it just a little too greasy. Still a solid 4 stars. Second time I made it I made sure I had ALL the correct ingredients. Much better. A lot less grease. My only change/ addition is I added a little garlic powder to the gravy.

This was terrific. The only change I made was add a can of whole mushrooms. Did the rest exactly the same. Used 4 regular bone in pork chops instead of the 6 thick ones. I cannot wait to eat leftovers tomorrow because I think this dish will be even better tomorrow. Saved it in favorites and my husband told me not to change a thing!

This was delicious.  I didn't have dijon, so I used yellow. I didn't have thyme by itself so I used an Italian blend. Simple and easy with a lot of flavor. I botched the thickening of the sauce but that didn't really matter in the end. Definitely adding to the monthly rotation.

I was looking for something new to try with the pork loin chops i had laid out for dinner.  This was a winner with the whole crew!!  Even my teenage daughter enjoyed it and she doesn't like anything!  I will definitely be making this dish again!!

I used the frying pan after cooking the chops to carmelize the chopped onion to put on top of the dish. I will make this recipe again.

After an hour of baking potatoes still a little crunchy. Pork was a little dry. Maybe a little overcooked? Cream sauce very good. I would make this again using pork tenderloin.

This was very good if a little too rich, and the sauce was too thin. I made a few changes based on other reviews. I halved the thyme and added garlic. I also added the pan drippings to the sauce (I had browned the pork chops with garlic, as well as salt and pepper). I used sliced onions instead of diced ones. I liked all of these changes. The sauce needed additional thickening.  Next time I’ll also use milk instead of half and half and halve the amount of cheese. I think those changes will address the too-rich quality.

Very good but rich. I did the following:

1) reduced thyme to 3/4 tsp
2) sliced onion into half moons instead of dicing
3) used 4 TBSP flour instead of 3. 
4) added 2 cloves minced garlic to potatoes
5) used bone-in chops (I used 2 large thick cut ones as it’s just two of us)
6) used 4 Yukon gold potatoes

I think Next  time I would make half of the sauce.

Great. My wife loved it. I had to make the following changes due to availability,  Bone-in pork chops, and cut the Thyme in half. oh and the cheese was a mix of cheddar and mozzarella. So While it is slightly different than exactly printed, it should be close enough to recommend the recipe. I agree with several of the other reviews, cut the amount of Thyme in half, anymore and I think it would be overwhelming.

Awesome smell and flavour! However, it was quite watery and I had at add 1/2 cup instant Idahoan potatoes to thicken it! Guests loved it, would make it again.

Easy. Tasty. A classic. I've been making this or a variation thereof, since the mid 1960s! Sometimes I add chopped or sliced Granny Smith apples along with the sliced or chopped potatoes. I usually omit the Dijon mustard & add a healthy pinch of ground mustard. And, I hardly ever add cheese.

a keeper! I was doubtful in the beginning, but it turned out great with a 'thumbs up' from everyone.   I only used 2 potatoes because they were pretty large. 
 Next time, I will add more grated cheese.

Too much thyme.  This overpowered the rest of the dish.  Cooking time was correct.  Might try again without the thyme.

Substituted a can of cream of mushroom soup for the half & half. Changed the cook time to 1hr & 30 min after reading other reviews. Will cut the thyme back to 1 teaspoon instead of 2. Found it to be a little strong. Will definitely make again with modifications. Thanks for sharing

This was good. I used very thick bone-in chops and cooked it a bit longer. They turned out tender and moist. I like garlic so I added some minced garlic to the potato layers. BF loved this.  I will make it again.

Really good! The only change I made was adding crumbled bacon and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Really pleased with the results and I plan on making this again soon!

Made it again for the church pot luck, I cubed the pork chops after browning so it would serve better for the event. I had only a little bit left after they devoured it. Super casserole!

This is really good. Only used 4 chops and used 2% milk. Added about three strips of crispy crumbled bacon. I did all the cheese in the beginning and baked for an hour. Keeper. Thanks for posting.

used pork steaks W/ bone in
I used my home grown red potatoes & onions.
Added two large baby Bella mushrooms ( chunked) with the potatoes and onions. Seasoned salt, a little Greek seasoning & of course lots of fresh black pepper.
Smoked paprika on top didn’t put the cheese on top to brown just sprinkled on  last layer of potatoes.
mmm this is great food.

This is a good solid recipe. I cut back on the butter by using my George Forman to grill the meat. In the future, I will use 8 thick-cut, small center loin chops. Additionally, I cut the butter by using 2 slices of crisp bacon bits in the sauce.  I increased the cheese by half a cup (extra half on the top with two slices of crispy bacon) Net, I lost 2 TBS of butter but added 4 slices of bacon 1/2 cup of cheese.
