Do not mix with mixer!!  Original recipe was not submitted that way. Mix all ingredients by hand just until all ingredients are blended. No bake pie is ready in only 15 minutes. I know, I sent the recipe in!  Enjoy!

I figured out what might cause the runniness of the filling!!!  I don't know if anyone else has ever noticed, but if you stir and handle sour cream too much, it breaks down and becomes runny. 

I mixed the sugar, pineapple and pudding mix on low speed for 2 minutes.  Then I folded in the sour cream with a spatula until it was evenly mixed.  Wah-la!  Firm and tasty pie filling.  I used lite sour cream, a shortbread pie crust and garnished it with sliced strawberries and whipped cream... and boy was it tasty!!!!  My friend's husband went back for thirds!

I have an alternative way to make this recipe that's sugar-free.  Combine sugar-free instant pudding (lemon or vanilla), 8 oz crushed pineapple (undrained), ~1 cup Lite Cool Whip, Lite Chiffon lemon yogurt (single serving), 1 tsp lemon peel, 1 Tbsp lemon juice. Chill for 24 hours.  It's a very good 'lite' alternative.

I love this recipe. I made a few changes to mine though.  I use a graham cracker crust, one large box vanilla instant pudding, one medium tub of sour cream, and large can of crushed pineapple.  Mix pineapple and vanilla pudding together, add sour cream, then pour into pie dish.  Top with cool whip.

I did as a lot of others and altered the recipe a bit.  Instead of Vanilla pudding I used French Vanilla. I also added a tsp. of Vanilla flavoring. I drained a bit of the pineapple juice and mixed the sour cream in last. I poured all into a Graham Cracker crust. We loved it!

This is a great recipe.  Very easy to prepare and tastes so good.  I mixed everything by hand and it came out perfectly.  When it was thoroughly chilled I spread whipped topping over the entire pie.  Very refreshing.  I have made it with the graham cracker crust and with ready-bake pie crust...both were good.

This pie is so fast, so easy, so delicious you won't believe it! To make it really low fat you can change the sour cream to plain yoghurt and use light pudding. To fancy it up you can put the whipped cream on top of pie, put pineapple chunks around the edge and drizzle the juice over top. It'll look like you spent all day in the kitchen!

This is a very simple, no bake pie!  I doubled the recipe and it just filled a 9 inch pie, however I ran was short about 3 oz of the vanilla pudding and it turned out great!  The pie was a little more on the tart side (which I prefer.)  

Great recipe for kids and adults alike!

The original recipe is good. I used white chocolate pudding instead of the vanilla and be careful with sour cream. Mix the pineapple, pudding, and sugar first. Then fold in the sour cream, if you mix to much the sour cream will brake down and make your pie runny.

Very good and very easy to make.  This isn't a super fancy dessert, probably not something I would serve to guests.  It's looks a little unappetizing!!! I used lite sour cream and mixed by hand like the others.  I also used twice as much pineapple as it called for, which helped bind it together better. I also used a graham cracker crust, which really made it good. After a few hours in the fridge, I cut a slice and it almost fell apart.  I couldn't wait to try.  But the next morning it was set and very good.  Thumbs up from friends!

I made individual "pies" using my mini muffin pan and mini cupcake papers. I used the graham cracker crust from this site for the base, baked for 7 minutes and removed from the pan to cool. Then I piped the filling into the cups. I also mixed everything by hand and had no problems with runniness. Great recipe!

So incredibly easy!  This literally took minutes to make.  I followed your advice and just mixed everything by hand - I actually thought mine looked a little thick, but it turned out just fine.  One thing I might tweak next time is taking the sugar down a bit, maybe a 1 or 1 1/2 tablespoons... it was a little on the sweet side.  Still, my husband and I went back for seconds, so I'll definitely make it again.  Thanks!

This pie was so easy to make- I agree it isn't too pretty but the taste is very yummy!  Two of my guys loved it as is and wanted me to make it again.  The older two want the pineapple pureed- no chunks.  The taste is very good.   I will make it again.

My mother-in-law makes this pie, but when she went out of town for Thanksgiving, I scrambled to find the recipe and ended up discovering Allrecipes.com as a result!  I love this pie.  The recipe was perfect.  I just added some vanilla extract to the whipped cream.  This is very easy and quick to make.  Thanks.

A delicious and light dessert. Perfect on a hot day! I made as directed and  topped with cool whip in the center and mandarin orange slices arranged decoratively on the pie.

I love this pie! You can use low fat sour cream and sugar free pudding mix to cut the calories with no loss of flavor! I also find 1 T of sugar is just fine. I usually decorate with fresh strawberries or maraschino cherries.

Great easy recipe but more filling needed for a 9" pie. For more filling substitute in: 5.5 oz. instant vanilla pudding and 2 cups sour cream.  (I always use low fat.) This makes enough filling to fill a 9" pie. Top with whipped cream.  Looks good enough to serve to company.

I make this pie with a store-bought, reduced-fat graham cracker crust; sugar-free, fat-free pudding mix; 1% milk; light sour cream; and light Cool Whip for an unbelievably delicious low- calorie dessert. NO ONE guesses that this is a "diet" dessert. My husband is not a huge pineapple or "light" fan, but this pie gets a big thumbs up from him. Chopped candied ginger sprindled on the top 
is a must. 5 stars for being simple, delicious, and easy to make "light."

This was just okay.  The consistency turned out fine but it tasted like a thick pudding with some pineapple thrown in.  Would probably not make again but my youngest really liked it a lot.  Sorry

I had no problems making this pie and followed the advice of previous reviewers to mix it by hand.  However, the taste is not phenomenal, only average.  Still, good recipe for a quick, simple dessert when time is scarce.

This recipe has become a staple in our dessert making. It's so easy to prepare, with items you most likely have on hand, and really delicious. We have substituted plain yogurt for the sour cream with success. I know that others have complained that their pie didn't set up. We haven't had a problem. . .we always stir it by hand, not by mixer.

YUCK! This was incredibly flavorless. Pineapple is one of my favorite fruits. If I had tasted this blindfolded, I wouldn't have known it was pineapple.Will never make this again. I can't believe that my tastebuds are that outta wack compared to the prior reviews!

I like a very full pie so I use a 16 oz can of crushed pineapple, a 5.1 oz box of instant vanilla pudding and 1-2 cups of low fat sour cream.  This makes more filling than you need for a 9 inch pie filled to the top.  Or use a deep dish pie pan.  Any excess filling is delicious with a crumbled cookie or granola.

A delicious, light, cool pie.  Would be a great summer-time treat.  I followed others directions and beat the mixture well before adding the sour cream. After adding sour cream, I mixed it just enough to blend it in.  I used light sour cream too!

I was really disapointed in this recipe. I followed the recipe and took the advice of some of the other posters but no no avail. My pie was served in bowls because it was way to soupy. I liked the taste but not the consistency. I'm up for any other suggestions on this one.

This pie was easy to make and had a nice flavor. My husband and I didn't care for the texture at all though. Also, the pie didn't set up as well as I had hoped. I'll try this one again just in case the pie gods were frowning on me when I made this the first time.

Everyone seemed to like it.  Made 2, one with cheesecake pudding and one with vanilla, both were well received in their graham cracker crusts.

I followed the recipe but doubled it and made a graham cracker crust.  It fit perfectly in a 9 1/2 deep dish pie plate with room for the whipped topping garnish.  It was a hit at dinner and found that it was even better the next day.  Nice and easy recipe.

Made using lemon pudding mix. (Did not have vanilla). Wonderful flavor. The tartness of the lemon and the sweetness of the pineapple complimented each other beautifully!

Super easy recipe and great for summer...or any time! I recommend using a graham cracker crust instead. That is what i did and it tasted delicious! I then topped the pie with some blueberries which gave it a fun summer flavor.

I used this recipe this evening but used more crushed pineapple ( I had leftovers from a 20 oz. can) and two packages of pudding - coconut and vanilla. I also mixed in some frozen whipped topping. I used a chocolate cookie crust pie shell. When it was chilled I drizzled homemade chocolate sauce over it. Delicious!

When I made this recipe; I used a 16 ounce can of pineapple, 2 small packages of sugar free pudding mix and 1pint fat -free sour cream. Then poured it into a graham cracker crust. It made a really "full" pie. It was delicious!

I made a double batch and used 1 vanilla and 1 banana pudding packet.  It was very good, very simple and the kids ate it up.  I'll be doing a modified version as a cheesecake topper this weekend.  Thanks!

I found this while looking for a way to use up crushed pineapple.  After reading the reviews and seeing how little 8 oz of pineapple was, I decided to double the recipe.  I used a 20 oz can of pineapple, kept the sugar the same and doubled the pudding and sour cream.  It came out nice and thick and I only had about 1/2 c left over after filling a ready made graham crust.  Which by the way is good by itsself.  Not a fancy pie but it tastes great :)

Yummy!  I didn't have quite enough pineapple and juice so I found a small can of mandarin oranges and used that.  I used all of the mandarin juice and only 3/4 of the mandarins.  I wanted to save some for the top.  After licking my fingers, I think it's going to be excellent!!!

Very tasty, very easy.  I was very careful about not overmixing the sour cream (did it by hand instead of using a mixer on low speed) and it was not runny at all.  I will absolutely make this again.

This was so good we left off the whipped cream.
