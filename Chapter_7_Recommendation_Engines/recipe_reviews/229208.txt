Thank you ELEANORAFA. I grew up in Kentucky and remember making apple butter with butter added, but after looking at many recipes I thought maybe I was wrong. Last night I made a batch of slow cooker apple butter (almost same ingredients as yours,)  but it just wasn't right. I went looking for more recipes to see what I was missing and I found yours. I wasn't crazy! I added the butter to my batch and PERFECT! Thanks some much.

I followed the recipe but I never put this in the oven.  Instead, I peeled, cored and sliced 5 lbs. of apples, 1 c. sugar, 1 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. butter, 1 T. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg.  I cooked this for about 2 1/2 hours stirring occasionally and then poured into my blender and blended this real good.  Pour into 3 2qt. clean canning jars with rings and lids.  Let the butter cool, and seriously this is closer to apple sauce then apple butter.  Yummy Great for gift giving.
