This soup is wonderful our company loved it! We substituted ground beef for sirloin dried parsley and barley instead of rice. It is our favorite soup now. I have even added frozen soup vegetables to beef it up. Thanks a lot for this new family favorite.

I actually used ground beef for this (its what I had) and it still turned out delicious. The cheese on top is a great touch!

I didn't have cilantro (eliminated) or fresh peppers (used a frozen mix of 3 peppers & onion). I also halved the recipe (except for the peppers). I forgot the cheese on top too. However my husband thought it was good. He thought it needed more peppers to give it that stuffed pepper taste. I thought the potatoes were a bit odd too but it tasted pretty good. Good enough that I shared it on Facebook!

Hearty soup! Pretty tasty too. I don't care for stuffed peppers (my husband loves them) but I enjoyed this.

I enjoyed this. I used ground beef instead of sirloin but I made no other modifications. Good stuff thanks for sharing.

I thought it was great as is! You could still add more veggies if you wanted but went really well over rice. Quick and easy and it makes a lot so my family of 4 has eaten it twice and still has at least one more round to go.

Made this for a birthday party recently. We had family members each bring their favorite soup. THIS WAS A HIT! We doubled the green pepper and diced tomatoes omitted the potatoes added the cooked rice to the soup and kept it warm in a slow cooker. Something else we did (by accidental purchase)... Instead of topping with sour cream we topped with a dollop of french onion dip - SO good!
