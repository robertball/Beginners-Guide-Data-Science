This was good tasting, though too wet. I'm not entirely sure where I'd cut back in order to reduce the liquid here, but I might start with cutting the barbecue sauce measurement and using dehydrated onion. Alternately, you could thicken the sauce on the stovetop with cornstarch. I used Sweet Baby Ray's for my barbecue sauce and added crushed red pepper to give it some heat, because we love heat. Thanks for the recipe!

Quick, easy, and honestly, just about as full of flavor as most beef barbeque with double or triple the ingredients/prep time!  I used a smoke-flavored barbeque sauce and added red and green peppers the last hour. Cooked on low for 8 hrs.  Leave the lid open to absorb extra liquid the last half hour.  Leftovers should be just as good tomorrow!!
