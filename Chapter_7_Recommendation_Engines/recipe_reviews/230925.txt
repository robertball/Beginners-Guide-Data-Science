This is really good if you are a friend of a lot of bbq taste. We liked it and we ate it with friends while watching a football game in tv with doritos. Next time i double the bacon.

Folks seemed to like the dip at a dinner party on crackers and tortilla chips.  The BBQ sauce was  pretty overwhelming, so next time I would probably put a layer of jalapeno jelly instead of the BBQ sauce.

I've been making this many times for many years and it's  one of my top appetizers to make.  Feeds a large crowd.  I use Jack Daniel's BBQ sauce.  Make sure your cream cheese is room temperature so it's easy to spread.   I highly recommend this!

I made this for the first Saints game of the season. Making it again for this game. It was delicious. I didn't think it was too much BBQ at all. I used Joe Horn's BBQ sauce, yum! May add a little more bacon this time. I made several appetizers and this by far, was our favorite.
