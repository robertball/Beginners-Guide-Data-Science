There are so many reviews on this pie, and unfortunately there ae a few that are not praises.  This pie, as with anything that a good cook knows, must have a little personal tweek if you are that kind of a cook, but I have been not only professionally trained, but I am a very good cook and I will tell you this basic recipe is unbelievably good and shockingly easy and above all it will bring you praise.  I followed the recipe--I was busy and lazy, but it still brought me rave reviews.  Sweetness is personal.....think about your berries and taste them, then decide.  Think about other pies you have made and what thickener do you like the best.  If it is tapioca, use it in the proportions you are used too, if it is flour use the flour, but if you want to make sure a pie is thick then add a tad more.  If you make the pie and you had problems then you must realize it may not be the recipes fault, but your own for now thinking things out.

This pie is excellent as it stands....the taste is sweet, it is not too thick of a mixture around the berries when finished and couple those things with a very good crust and people will shout praise.  Try the milk on the crust route sprinkled with sugar and it will put the Sunday clothes on the pie.....thicken with tapioca if you want a clearer thicker, more stable pie.......and if you want that great taste and sight is secondary to taste then you are find to head on and serve your family the pie as it is written.

Remember there are few simple p

This pie turned out beautiful! I used frozen strawberries instead of fresh and also added 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the recipe. I cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup as some recommended; i'd actually prefer it a bit sweeter cuz my berries turned out to be tart. For sweet, fresh berries, 3/4 cup of sugar is probably fine, tho.  I brushed the top crust with half&half and sprinkled it with sugar so it turned a shiny golden brown. This is a very good pie... i would make it again! :D

Turning out a perfect fruit pie is always a gamble. Measurements in a recipe can never be precise as there are just too many variables, like juiciness or sweetness of the berries, or an individual's preference for either. Having said that, I can only speak of what worked for me. I like a thicker pie, so I used 2 qts. of strawberries, which measured out to 5-1/2 c. sliced. I mixed up 1/3 c. flour, 1 T. cornstarch, a little better than 1 c. sugar and a mere 1/4 tsp. cinnamon (didn't want the cinnamon flavor to distract). I let this sit for 15 minutes before turning out into the pie shell so the berries could release their juices. I baked the pie at 375 degrees for 25 minutes, then covered the edges of the crust with aluminum foil and baked for another 25 minutes, until the crust was golden and the juices were bubbling and thick. It wasn't until the pie was in the oven that I realized I forgot to dot the berries with butter, even though I had it sitting right out in front of me! But you know what? It wasn't even missed! This pie was so good I can't imagine how it could have been better had I remembered the butter. For those who experienced a too juicy pie, I'm thinking that either the pie wasn't baked long enough for the flour and/or cornstarch to do its work, or they cut into the pie before it was thoroughly cooled.

Total deliciousness.  I took the best comments from other reviewers and tweaked it this way: only one cup sugar (I tasted the strawberries first!  critical step!), and I left out the cinnamon entirely, and added almost half a cup flour, not just 1/3.  With the sugar and flour tossed around the fresh strawberries, it made the most delicious sauce inside, and just the right texture!  Another tip: to make sure the inside was totally done, I did what my mom taught me to do with apple pie.  High heat, as the recipe says, for 1/2 hour, then turned it down to 350 for another 20 minutes.  It really cooks the fruit down nicely, the top crust is browned but not burned, and the bottom crust is fully cooked and flaky!

I was impressed with this pie. Reduced the sugar to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup cornstarch to thicken the juices up. I'd add less cinnamon-a little overpowering. Overall, very good!

After reading the reviews, I was expecting a TERREFIC pie.  Boy, was I disappointed.  It was runny.  I stopped baking at 35 minutes, when the top was beautiful and golden brown--and there were some bubbles coming out the vents.  But the juice didn't thicken--it was runny and floury.  Also, plan to eat this pie all in one day, because the next day the strawberries were pale and mushy.

I wish I could give this recipe 5 stars, but the juice was indeed juicy. It did thicken up after sitting overnight, but it's still quite runny. I should have followed other reviewers' advice and added a couple tablspoons cornstarch. The reason I would love to give it 5 stars is the flavor--yum, yum, yummy!! It was delicious!! This will be my strawberry pie recipe, but I'm going to add cornstarch (and maybe extra flour) from now on. Thanks!!

I made this recipe for company and had never tried it before, so I was a little worried, but it came out absolutely wonderful.  Changes I made:added a bit more cinnamon, only 3/4 cup sugar, and 2 tblsps of tapioca for thickening (which is in addition to the flour).  Everyone asked for the recipe, so it was definitely a hit. PERFECT

I agree that you need to modify this recipe to make it work, but with some changes it is a delicious pie.  Per several suggestions here, I decreased the cinnamon to 1/4 teaspoon and added 1/4 C cornstarch.  Also, depending on the sweetness of the strawberries, you might want to decrease the sugar to 3/4 or 1 C.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it was fabulously delicious and easy to make.  I served it at a Memorial Day gathering and all the guests raved about it.  I did reduce the sugar a bit and added a touch of corn starch to thicken the juice up a bit and it turned out perfectly.  Thanks for sharing this easy and delicious recipe!!

I had some fresh strawberries to use and so I looked for a pie recipe.  I dont like the gelatin type open faced pies.  However, let me tell you this 2 crust traditional recipe is on point!  I scaled down to 1 cup of sugar from reading other's advice, but the second time I took it down even more to 1/2 a cup.  I think since my berries were already ripe and fresh, the original amount of sugar could be adjusted.  maybe frozen strawberries need more.  After baking it on 425 for 25 min, I turned it down  to 350 for the last 15 min.  Another reviewer mentioned this helps the liquid to be thicker.  The juice inside was perfect so I will continue to do it like this as well.  this is SO simple, and you will look like a master chef!

Excellent pie! I usually avoid strawberries, fresh or frozen, because I find the tartness a little overwhelming. I followed the recipe using fresh strawberries and refrigerated pie crusts and it turned out fantastic. I baked it at a lower temperature for a longer time to prevent it from browning too fast, 325 degrees for 1 hour. The filling set up perfectly, not runny at all. It had just the right sweetness and you could really taste the strawberries. Will be baking this pie again!

Oh, I wanted to like this. It's beyond soupy. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was still way too sweet. Trust what people are saying when you read the reviews. The filling would be better with a shortcake.

This was a nice basic pie recipe. I used corn starch to thicken instead of flour (personal preference) and omitted the butter. My berries were already a little sweet, so I only used 1 cup of sugar. Finally, I added a lattice top. This pie came out beautiful (see added photo) and tastes wonderful. It was just what I was in the mood for!

This pie was a huge hit at the family Halloween party.  You don't often see a baked strawberry pie without rhubarb or raspberry or something mixed in, but it really doesn't need it, and everybody loved it.  

Like most other people, I added 2 tbsp. cornstarch to the dry ingredients, and this kept the filling nice and thick instead of soupy, but not too jammy.

Following another reviewer's advice, I baked the pie at 425 for 30 minutes, then turned the heat down to 350 to bake the last 20 minutes.  Both crust and berries were perfectly cooked.

I also brushed the top of the crust with beaten egg white and sprinkled it with cinnamon sugar.  This made it crisp and golden brown.

This pie turned out pretty well.  I did follow the advice of others and only put in 3/4 cups of sugar after tasting the strawberries, and also putting in 1/2 cup flour instead for thicker juice.  There was another person who suggested baking it on high heat (425) for the first 1/2 hour, then lowering the heat to 350 for another 20 minutes, I did follow that.  It turned out really well!  I must also add I left out the cinnamon, and totally forgot about the butter until it was in the oven.  Once it cooled, and it was cut up for dessert there really wasn't any juice spilling out anywhere, it had all been congealed.  Everyone loved it!  And on the upside, it also made the house smell like warm strawberry jam.  I'll definitely be making this again. :)

Fabulous recipe !!  I tweaked it a bit .. used 5 cups of fresh cut up strawberries .. added a tablespoon of cornstarch to the flour  .. cooked it at 410 for 45 minutes ... and, I brushed milk onto the top crust and sprinkled that with sugar and a SMALL bit of cinnamon .. RAVE reviews, looked awesome taste .. well .. TO DIE FOR  LoL
I also used a NEW pastry recipe that was so drop dead easy I am embarrassed by the length of time I took to actually make it up .. If I might, I'll share .
5 cups of flour (all purpose) .. cut in a pound of lard (Crisco) .. cut in until the mixture is 'mealy' .. make a well in the centre and pour in ONE can of 7UP, gingerale/Sprite .. diet or not .. mix well .. refrigerate for at least an hour before rolling .. I got 6 crusts from this mix, and, the pastry is AWESOME!

I made a traditional pie crust and followed the recipe mostly as written.  The only differences was that I added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to the filling mixture and cut the sugar mixture down a 1/3 cup because the strawberries were so sweet.  Also, I used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar for a little more complex flavor.  I was a little concerned that it would be too soupy as some of the other reviewers stated.  I turned out perfect!!  Also, remember with a fruit pie, if you let it sit overnight or at least 4 to 6 hours after baking, the filling will firm up as it cools.  I really can't say anything bad about this pie.  I think it is lack of experience baking fruit pies that others have had a lot of difficulty with the pie filling.  Also if you are looking for something with a more tart/sweet flavor try a strawberry rhubarb pie. Most classic recipe strawberry pies are on the sweet side.  Again it was great!!

Pie turned out perfect! I did modify like others and added 3 tbls cornstarch, decreased the sugar to 3/4C and added some vanilla extract. I also brushed the top crust with half and half. I baked the pie at 425 for the first 30 mins and then decreased the temp to 350 for another 20 mins. The crust was perfectly browned and not burnt at all! We waited until the pie was completely cooled to eat and it turned out fantabulous! Not too juicy at all! Will definitely use this recipe again. Thank you!

I agree with other posters that fruit pies are always tricky.  Whoever made up the saying, "easy as pie" must have been referring to eating, not baking, lol!  I love this recipe because it's simple.  I did need to adjust things based on the berries I had.  I used about 2 cups of frozen raspberries, and a generous 3 cups of fresh chopped strawberries.  The amount of sugar called for was perfect for the type/amount of berries I had (I tasted it before baking, and before adding flour).  I did add less cinnamon (1/4 tsp), which was perfect for my taste.  I also added about 5 Tbsp of cornstarch with the flour, since I used some frozen berries (they seem juicier), no extra water.  I then latticed the top.  It did overflow, as expected, so be prepared!  With these adjustments for the berries I had on hand, the pie came out perfectly.  Great basic recipe!

I MADE A MODIFIED VERSION: I used 1 C of sugar, 1/3 C flour, no cinnamon (b/c I didn't think I would like the flavor with strawberries), no butter, and I added 3 T cornstarch.   Since the recipe did not say whether the strawberries should be cut up or left whole, I left them whole. I wonder if those with a too runny/juicy pie cut their strawberries up? Mine was perfect.

Delicious.  I made this with some Pillsbury Pie Dough I had in the fridge and had exactly 4 cups of frozen strawberries in the freezer that I thawed out from my Grandma's garden.  It turned out amazing and didn't have to buy one ingredient.

delicious!  but I did add some fresh rhubarb! YUM!  Also, I learned a trick from an old Coast Guard Officer...Beat an egg (yes, brush the top with it and sprinkle with sugar for a beautiful shiny golden crust) brush it on the bottom of the bottom crust.  This makes it so it is not soggy!

My pie was VERY runny and difficult to slice due to my decision to cut the strawberries in half (the really large ones in quarters), and use only 1/4 cup of cornstarch to thicken the mixture, as suggested by a few reviewers here.  It tasted good, but was quite messy.  Next time, I will try keeping the strawberries whole and perhaps using tapioca flour and allowing the mixture to stand for 15 minutes before proceeding with the recipe.

Outstanding! I admit, I took out a tablespoon or two of the sugar as my berries were nice and sweet and I'm not a fan of too-sweet anything. I also added a dash of nutmeg and about 1/2 teaspoon of cardamom and a pinch of allspice :~)

As a (very) novice pie maker, I found this to be so easy and so successful.  I chose to do the following: used 3 tbsp cornstarch, kept the cinnamon the same, used approximately 5 1/2 cups of organic frozen strawberries.  I got these suggestions from other raters and everything worked really well together!

Delicious pie! It is "soupy", but I've never had a baked strawberry pie, that wasn't soupy. Strawberries aren't like cherries or apples, so they make a pie that is more like a cobbler with two crusts. If you want a firm strawberry pie, you need to make the cold, unbaked kind with a glaze.

I substituted 1/4 cup cornstarch instead of flour, and while it held together well, it tasted just like strawberry jam and toast.  Did anyone else notice that?

Oh wow, what a pie!  This was fantastic!  I could have eaten the entire pie in one sitting!  I used a mix of strawberries and blueberries, so I had about 4 1/2 cups of fruit.  I personaly could have used another cup of fruit, so I'll add more next time.  I cut the sugar down to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup of cornstarch so the middle thickened up nicely.  I also cut the cinnamon down to 1/4 tsp.  Truly a delicious pie!

As with many fruit pies, just add a little instant tapioca mix to the filling. Be sure to mix well and let it cool for some time before serving. Oh, and I don't use the flour.

Absolutely Wonderful! My husband was dancing in his seat at the dinner table. This is our third strawberry pie from Allrecipes and definitely our favorite! My juices did not gel well either so I completely covered it in foil and baked an additional 20 minutes. Next time, I will turn the heat down to 375* and bake for 60-75 minutes. I believe that would solve the thin juice problem, I think it is just not baking high enough long enough to fully gel. To use up the last of my strawberries, I had about 6 cups sliced. I also used Sure Gel instead of flour, 1/2 cup to accommodate the added berries. Instead of all cinnamon I used a pinch of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. Still used the same amount of sugar. Served a la mode of course.

So so good! My strawberries were so-so sweet, so I used 3/4 C white sugar and that was perfect. For thickener, I used appx 3 tsp cornstarch and 3 T all purpose flour. After baking and cooling, I put it in the fridge and warmed to room temperature to serve - it held together perfectly.

This is an excellent, yet simple, pie recipe. The thickening agent can be substituted with the agent of your choice, such as flour, or water + cornstarch, or tapioca. The cinnamon is the secret ingredient. To avoid having a "soupy" pie, it is imperative that you let the pie sit several hours (24 ideally). This allows to the pie to set and be ready for service. Enjoy this recipe!

Like other reviewers, I really wanted this to turn out well. I had an abundance of strawberries from my garden and wanted to showcase them without a lot of other ingredients. As some suggested I cut the sugar to a cup and added 1/4 cup of cornstarch - and got strawberry soup. The flavor was excellent but the pie was wet and runny. I do not recommend this recipe.

I have been told by my husband that I better rate this pie a five. Since I do not eat sweets I have to go off my families opinion but I will say this. My father came over the other night and he had a slice of peach and strawberry pie (I had made one of each that night) as soon as he was done he asked me for seconds on the strawberry pie (saying it was awesome) so thanks for the great recipe!!!!! Will make again for sure.

I was a bit hesitant to make this, since several reviewers commented on the excessive and runny sauce, but mine turned out wonderfully. The sauce was thick and none boiled out of the pie pan. I used quite large strawberries and left them whole. I cut the sugar down a bit (to 1 cup) and used a few extra strawberries to pile high my deep-dish pie shell. I'll definitely make this again. Delicious!

This pie was excellant. I was surprised how great it turned out with so few ingredients. I made if for Easter dinner and my guest absolutely loved it. And it is so easy to make! I make it regularly now. Be sure to place a pan under the pie on a lower rack while it bakes. It can get really juicy.

Made this pie yesterday and it was one of the best I've ever made. As some have said here, I adjusted the recipe a bit and applied some of the tips here as well. Had more than enough fresh strawberries as I had gone to a strawberry patch the day before. They were on the tart side, so the amount of sugar called for was fine. Plus, a scoop of vanilla ice cream was wonderful along side it as the berries were still not overly sweet, I added 1/4 t salt, decreased the cinnamon to 1/4 tsp. I sliced the berries ( maybe that was a given, but the recipe didn't state) and added 1 T cornstarch to the flour. Baked at 400 for 25 minutes and reduced to 325 for another 20 minutes. Pie held together beautifully (after cooling).

Sweet and tasty pie! I used partially thawed frozen strawberries. I ended up needing about 5 cups of berries. I also used only 1 cup of sugar and added 2 Tbs corn starch as recommended by other reviewers. I probably could use slightly less sugar next time, but it was not overly sweet with 1 cup. The pie still had a lot of juice in it, but it was not more than I experience with any other berry pie.

My first double crusted baked strawberry pie and it was absolutely delicious. I reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and used tapioca instead of flour. Forgot to add butter, didn't miss it at all. Made with Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust from this site. Can't wait for dessert tonight. Hubby and I both declared it one of my best pies.

This was perfect. I pre-tasted my strawberries to determine if they needed all the sugar. They were pretty sweet already, so I used a little less than 1 C of sugar. I also added 2 T of corn starch just in case to ensure it was thick. I washed my berries thoroughly and let them sit in the colander for a while to be sure the excess water was gone, then destemmed. I used the Allrecipes recipe for Basic Flaky Pie Crust and had a scrumptious result! Be sure to cut slits in your top crust to let some of the moisture out!

This recipe is fantastic ! Never had a strawberry pie, wanted something other than the usual strawberry shortcake. This recipe is extremely easy what a pleasure.  Used a Jiffy Pie Crust IMO they're the best.  Was tempted to slice the strawberries but resisted good thing the results were great. Not fond of anything too sweet so I cut down on the sugar, love a buttery taste increased the butter, no cholesterol issues here. We now have a new pie to add to our favorites. Pie finished baking 2 hours prior to writing this only 2 slices left for dessert tonight if they last that long.

I also found it needed the cornstarch (3 tbsp.) and less cinnamon (1/4 tsp.) but other than that it turned out great. I also omitted the butter and found it delicious without it. Great basic recipe.

This was my first strawberry pie and it turned out fantastic.  I used my own pie crust recipe and made sure to put this on a cookie sheet.   The juices just spilled out, so I'm thankful it did.  I may add more flour or cornstarch next time.

Very good recipe.  I added 3 tbsp. cornstarch and it was still juicy enough for me.  When I added the strawberries to the sugar/flour mix, I found there was left over dry mix.  This I just sprinkled on top of the strawberries after putting them in my pie dish.  I think I'll try it next with different berries, since I love the recipe but am not such a fan of cooked strawberries.

Great flavor, but excessive juice even after following modifications from other reviewers.  I cut the sugar in half and added 2 1/2 Tbsp. corn starch to the 1/3 c. flour and it was soupy.  I thought it might thicken after it cooled but no such luck.  I'll try using tapioca next time.  Everyone thought it tasted wonderful, but it just looked like hell.

After a wonderful afternoon picking strawberries at a local farm, I had about 3 bushels of berries and needed to find something to do with them!  Having never made a strawberry pie before, I decided to try this recipe because it looked so easy and to my delight....it was!  I took the advise of other reviewers and reduced the sugar by about 1/4 cup and added a tablespoon of cornstarch.  I also used store bought pre-made pie pastry. I ended up with a super delicious pie that was not too runny at all (especially my second slice the next morning).  I think I'll add another 1 or 2 tablespoons of cornstarch the next time and then it may just be perfect. DELICIOUS!!

just made this today with 2 pkgs of frozen stawberries and followed the recipe exactly adding 3 tbs of cornstarch in sugar and flour mixture. The flavor was good but very soupy when I cut into the pie. The cornstarch definitely didn't help with thickness I may try with fresh berries next time so there will be less moisture then frozen berries.

We had Pie Soup and I used 1/4 cup of cornstarch. But my berries are really fresh and ripe maybe that was the problem. I put the second pie in for a longer time and a lower temp and that helped a little.

This pie had amazing flavor, but very soupy. It would be good in a cobbler form with a very heavy strussel topping. Very tasty, extremely tasty and would also be good as an ice cream topper. I'm glad I made a tester before the party tonight because I would have been ashamed as to how it looked, but it was still half eaten at my house because it tasted good! This recipe has great potential, but this isn't the best. I will be trying a different recipe

I had strawberry soup between two pie crusts and I added the cornstarch (2 Tbs) other reviewers recommended. It just did not hold together at all. Taste-was good, but a little sweet I would cut back on the sugar like others have suggested.  I MIGHT try it one more time and use a full 1/4 cup of cornstarch..I'll re-review if that comes out better.

This is a great recipe, but came out runny the first time. Changes I made: I put 1 cup sugar, 1/4 brown sugar in the sliced strawberries and allowed them to macerate for ~2 hours. I drained the juice and boiled it until it became syrupy. This was mixed back into the strawberries before baking. I also added a generous 1/4 cup of cornstarch versus flour. Also, this pie needs to completely cool before slicing.

A little runny when I took it out of the oven, but still turned out fantastic.  Reduced sugar to 1 cup and added 1/4 cup corn starch. The taste was exceptional! This pie did firm up, especially the next day.  This will be a regular in our home.

As listed by another user I added cornstarch to my mixture, and I loved it. I must have made 4 of these pies, I bought a huge quantity of strawberries for next to nothing and had to use them up, so my neighbors got pies too, and they loved it too! Now everyone loves my pies!

I don't know why everyone hasn't given this pie a 5- after following the suggestions (adding 1 tbsp of cornstarch and only 3/4 c sugar), the pie turned out fantastic.  It wasn't too sweet or runny- my husband and I loved it and I'm sure to make it a keeper!

Wow! This pie is wonderful! It past the taste test of several picky eaters in my home. Called a neighbor over to taste it and she took my printed copy of the recipe home along with 2 pieces of pie. Can't wait to make it for our next family gathering. Perfect and I wouldn't change a thing in the recipe.

This is a great pie recipe! I’ve returned to it many times over now. Like many others have said, I will join them with saying that berry pies require a level of intuition in order for them to turn out well. Following a berry pie recipe verbatim might turn out great or turn out awful depending on your berries. 

For example, the first time I made this pie, it turned out really soupy... tasted fabulous, but I was disappointed in the soupy texture. I knew it has nothing to do with the recipe, but everything to do with not following my gut when I was putting the berry mix together. I felt like I should have added more flour, or corn starch even. 

The second time I made it, I planned accordingly... tasted my berries first to adjust the sugar content... and added some extra thickening agents so it would turn out less soupy. 

Good pies take practice and each pie can be very different from the next in the creation of it. Go ahead and keep practicing! I mean, you get pie out of the deal each time. ???????

I put 5.5-6 cups of sliced strawberries and added extra sugar, flour, and cinnamon to compensate for it (proportionate) Added 4 tablespoons of corn starch.  I think next time I'll cut the sugar down though and cinnamon. Found the cinnamon to be a bit strong. Also baked it for 10 min at 425 then down to 350 for another hour till the crust was browned. Was baked perfectly in that time and the next day was even more thick.

This pie was great! I would recommend it to anybody. I did turn down the temperature a little bit and increase the time, I also let my pie sit overnight before I cut into it.  It came out delicious and had a perfect texture. I also submitted a photo of my pie... Feel free to take a look! It was wonderful. Great recipe, I will be making it again!

I think I might have done something wrong (new baker).  The filling and bottom crust were great but the Strawberries may not have been enough as my crust turned out uneven.  I will make this pie again for sure once I figure out the crust problem.

The pie is quite rich in flavor and very sweet but also quite good and easy!  You can use frozen strawberries for it, but do not get the strawberries in syrup, or at least drain about half the syrup out if you do...  I made that mistake the first time I ended up with Strawberry Pie soup!

Wish I had read the reviews 1st.  I have "Strawberry Soup with Crispy Noodles".  We picked organic heirloom strawberries from our own strawberry patch & used my favorite pie crust.  The crust was GBD.  The filling was a little too sweet (not much).  When I cut/broke open that wonderful top crust, an ocean of watery strawberry "sauce" came flowing out (along with the strawberries).  It was left to cool for over 2 hours,  it has set for 3 more hours, still soup.  I'm going to the store & buy Ice Cream.  Gonna serve it with my "soup" and tell the family It's a new dish,

I've never made pie before, and in the UK fruit pies are not commonplace, so I really wanted to try something new like this. I had no idea what to expect, but in the end it was so delicious. It works really well with some whipped up cream. The only adjustment I made is I latticed the pastry on top. The pie certainly is very runny but I did not find it much of a problem, in fact it was just perfect for us. Thank you!

This is truly an old-fashioned strawberry pie and it is delish! It's from before the days of cornstarch, and therefore is a little runny, but what's wrong with that? Every drippy bit tastes like pure summer. Skip the cornstarch as many reviewers suggest using, follow the recipe, and be transported to a simpler time. Enjoy!

This is a easy wonderful recipe.  I added a touch of Almond extract and it seemed to give it just a little more old fashioned taste.  Only recipe I use.

I've been looking for a recipe like this for years and now I've found it.  This is possibly the best fruit pie I have ever eaten.  I did follow the advice of some the reviewers and added a little extra flour.  I also cut back on the sugar because my family tends to prefer things less sweet.  My pie turned out great and I am by far NO expert pie maker.  P.S. I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust.

Delicious!  I never have problems with this like some of the other reviewers have had.  I do use a little more flour than called for, and on occasion I add sour cream to form a custard, but otherwise it's great.  It is even better the next day!

I thought this pie was absolutely wonderful, as did everyone who tried it. I wanted a pie akin to a traditional apple pie, but with strawberries and this hit the spot. Minor changes: I used 1 cup sugar with fresh, in-season berries, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, and added 2 tablespoons cornstarch for a firmer consistency. Delicious!

LOVED this recipe! The only other pie I had ever made before in my life was a pumpkin pie, and this came out delish. I read through some of the other reviews, and did cut the sugar back to 1 cup and added just a little more flour than what was called for. I also added in a couple tablespoons of Kozy Shack Strawberry Pudding, and coated the top with half and half and sugar to make it pretty. I'm a firm believer that a good recipe is one that is forgiving of different interpretations, and this one definitely had that quality! I'm making it again this week for some friends of mine. So easy, so yummy!

I made this recipe Gluten free using the original measurements, only using a Gluten free crust, and using half rice flour and half potato flour for the 1/3 cup of all purpose flour. It turned out great! My mom (who is on the gluten free diet) made it first a week ago, and it was so good that we picked up more strawberries and I made another one! Awesome recipe!

This is the simplest, best strawberry pie recipe ever. It can be a little juicy (soupy sounds too negative), but I hardly see that as a problem. The juice is so delicious that we all mop it up with the last bit of crust, or swirl it into the dollop of ice cream on the side. Yum! With a homemade crust and fresh summer berries this pie will visit you in your dreams! I think I have to go make one now!

This was my first pie, and it was excellent! I followed other advice (replaced 1/4 c of the sugar with cornstarch) and I was a little worried because the fruit was totally coated with white before the pie went into the oven. But it cooked down into the juice, and it tasted wonderful! The filling was a little juicy even with the added cornstarch but I didn't think it was a deal-breaker. Also, I used the full amount of cinnamon called for and it wasn't overpowering (I didn't even notice it). Definitely a winner!!!

First pie ever and it is true that this comes out runny. I even added a little cornstarch to the recipe...about 2-3 tablespoons. I loved it anyway!!!! I used frozen strawberries that i had defrosted almost till soft. I think next time i may add more cornstarch, but we will see after it sits overnight.

Try mixing the filling and zapping it in the microwave before filling the pie crusts. Some berries are juicier than others, so you can see if you need to thicken it more before you bake it. If you're not happy with this, buy the canned stuff!

I made a homemade dough instead of using prepared pie crusts.  I suggest using a little less sugar than the recipe says.  Mine was a little runny.  Overall, the pie was great, though!

This was a very delicious pie, but my juice wasn't very thick. It more like ran everywhere. But it definately had the flavor I was looking for. Everyone I told had never tried a baked strawberry pie but they didn't get to try this one either because my children and I ate all of it before anyone else had a chance. Maybe next time if they're lucky.

Very tasty! I cooked this as a cobbler (one crust on top, baked in a glass baking dish). It turned out beautifully. The family loved it. I sliced the berries in half first, so there wouldn't be strawberry "lumps" in the pie. The flour did a good job of thickening the juices.

Beautiful Beautiful PIE!!!  I lowered the sugar to 3/4 cup, and upped the flour to 1/3 cup plus 1 1/2 Tablespoons Wondra flour.  What a treat!!! Just a beautiful old fashioned pie!

Very good!  I do agree that it was pretty sweet, but I still loved it.  Next time I'll try to reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup.  Thanks!

Oh my goodness, this is way too much sugar for the strawberries.  I made this tonight and my guests decided this should be called a "sugar pie." If I try this again, I'll cut the sugar by at least half!

I read other reviews before beginning because the recipe seemed too simple for someone like me who usually needs a hand hold. The key to having a thick pie that doesn't run is cooking the filling in a pan first, on medium low to low heat! My strawberries were a bit on the tart side, so I stuck with the cup of sugar. I decided against the cinnamon all together, and instead went with a tiny splash of vanilla and juice from half a small lemon. I also bumped up the flower to a 1/2 cup, but when you cook it all together on low heat, you may not need that much. Recipe definitely calls for whipped cream on top! will definitely keep baking and experimenting, but i think cooking is the key

I love this recipe I make it every year and my family loves it. When I first made it the filling was too runny and my pie wouldn’t hold shape so I decided to try corn starch as a thickener and cooked some if the juices down on the stovetop first and the pie came out perfect!

I made this pie at my granddaughter's suggestion.  I had never heard of strawberry pie but this one has a delicious strawberry flavour, which we very much enjoyed.  However, I found the recipe too sweet so I will cut back on the sugar if I make this pie again.  Also the juice is way too watery, which will make the bottom crust soggy by the time we eat more tomorrow.  If I make this recipe again I will at try doubling the amount of flour to thicken the sauce.

This was so easy and so delicious. I cut back on the sugar and flour, using 1 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of flour. And in my haste, I forgot to add the butter. It was quite delicious with the bonus of cutting a few calories.

Most amazing taste!  Will make again.  Inside was very funny.  Next time will try one of the many tips in reviews to reduce that problem. We solved it this by eating a slice while still warm and then draining out the extra. Hopefully this will keep crust from going soggy.

The best Strawberry Pie that I have made.  I would suggest that if your strawberries are really sweet adjust the added sugar.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I have made it twice, the first time I tried less sugar and it was not sweet enough and th second time I put the exact amount of sugar as th recipe and it was perfect.  I also replaced the flour with minute tapioca. Delicious ...I almost cried it was so good.This is definitely my favourite dessert pie to make. I am just about to make a third one.  That would be 3 strawberry tapioca pies in about 2 weeks.

The taste was delicious, the filling was too loose; may need to adjust flour in the future or use corn starch or tapioca instead.

Totally runny. It didn't set and I had to dump the liquid out. a failure. 
Don't give it a 5 star if you modify it! Then, it is a different recipe.
Very disappointed.

turned out amazing!! i brushed with an egg+ water wash right before baking, if you do this make sure you don’t leave any clumps and leave a very thin layer all over instead because the spots that were thicker with egg did turn a little soggy

The pie came out great. I used fresh whole berries, cut the larger ones in half.  I followed the recipe and took some suggestions from previous reviews. I  add 1/4 cornstarch and thats about it. Used a lattes pie crust on the top thought that would down the moisture from the berries.  All in all the pie was delicious a little moist but not soupy. Stayed together nicely when sliced.

Made this twice. A very delicious pie! Received many compliments, and one person scrapped the pan!  The strawberries were very ripe, so I decreased the sugar to 1cup. The second time I thickened the  filling by increasing the flour to 1/2cup and adding 1Tbsp cornstarch. Thank you so much for sharing your recipe!

I did add a half of can of strawberry pie filing, (Our Family brand). It is cooling now, and it's my first pie. I'm so proud of myself. I'm starting to like this easy baking thing. If you have any easy simple recipe ideas please let me know.

My first try I got strawberry soup, the crust was almost burnt but the strawberries were still raw. Next time I started off at 425 degrees for about 10min and then turned it down to 325 degrees until it bubbled, and it turned out just like the picture and tasted great!
I will make it again.
Thanks!!

I consider myself a good pie maker but his pie was an epic failure. It was very liquidy. And cinnamon and strawberries do not go well together. I will continue to search for better recipe.

I would place tin foil around the crust edges for the first 15 minutes. I also didn't have enough strawberries so I added a little fresh rhubarb. My husband doesn't like whip cream so we had vanilla ice cream instead. Yum

Love anything with strawberries, but this was a bit too sweet and a bit runny.  I will decrease the sugar and increase the flour next time I make it.  It's a keeper, though!!

I have made this pie at least three times and it has come out great each time.  Strawberries are plentiful most of the summer so it makes an inexpensive and delicious dessert . As long as you mix the strawberries well with the flour and sugar it comes out perfect each time.

This pie was absolutely delicious!  My only changes were to add about 2 tablespoons of cornstarch for thickening, and use less sugar (after tasting my strawberries).  Thanks for a great & easy recipe.

Thank you for sharing this recipe,  it is the best strawberry pie I've ever made. I did reduce the sugar down to 1c, pre reviews  and baked 425 for 25 min and 350 for the last 15, it came out perfect.  This will be the one I made from now on.

I too wish I had read the reviews before making it.  It seemed so simple, so I figured what could go wrong?  As others said, it was very runny and way too sweet.  I would try it again because it is so easy, but with way less sugar and more thickener of some type.

I've never baked a strawberry pie, but had 4 quarts of strawberries given to me.  I read all of the reviews and took some advice.  I halved my strawberries and used maybe 6 cups measured after halved.  I used 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.  I added 3 TBSP cornstarch.  I had a prepackaged crust on hand from Trader Joe's that I rolled out.  It is an adequate pie crust but not very big.  I did take the advice to bake at 425 for 25 minutes and then switched to 350 degrees.  I swear it took at least 1 solid hour AFTER i turned it down to 350!  But I cooled the pie outside at night for an hour and then switched it to the fridge for 1 1/2 hours.  I couldn't believe my eyes when it came out in a solid piece and did not run!  My husband raved about it being one of the best fruit pies he'd ever had.  It was just the right amount of sugar, too.  I think next time, since after 25 minutes at 425 the crust was barely beginning to color, I'd wait for more color before turning the oven temp down.  I was wondering if it was too dry.  Either too much corn starch or too long in the oven.  But either way, I was very pleased with the results!  Will keep it and make it again!  And use more strawberries next time!  I used the amount to be level with my pie pan.  It sunk down a little as it cooled.  Next time I will heap them up in the center.

so I made this, and It was amazing. forewarning, the filling runs a little thin, but a bit extra corn starch or flour will fix that right up. It's still a five, though, because that was on me. I, not being a fan of strawberries but needing to use a bad of them, was very impressed. in fact, I also used a home made pie crust and used the extra to make a little strawberry on top for decoration.

Delicious! But, I used 4 cups of sliced strawberries and the sauce bubbled up and dripped all over the bottom of my oven. I guess I should have used whole strawberries? I wish the recipe had been more clear; this was my first strawberry pie and I needed a little more clarification. It's delicious though!

As with any recipe that uses fresh fruit, it's going to require some edits depending on your fruits sweetness and moistness. I omitted the cinnamon because I don't care for it. The simplicity is the golden gem on this one, you can pretty well memorize it. That and the top crust that holds the moisture in til the next day, though my first pie the slits were a bit small and it bubbled over the edges a bit, next time I will probably lattice.  I've made it twice and it's been a dang hit each time!

Right now as I`m writing I`m eating a piece of this heavenly pie.....I saw some negative comments, so I`ll tell you what I did. I doubled The Ingredients... BUT.... Sugar  I only Used1 and a half cups, because  when mixed with fresh and washed strawberries it melts and as for the flour instead of using one third cup flour x 2... I used a cup of flour, so that way the texture is not soggy in the least, and while going to all this relaxing trouble :D.... I have 2 pies in the process

I used turbinado sugar instead of white and only 2 cups.  It came out juicier than expected but was still delicious with some homemade whipped cream.  Will experiment with thickeners.

We loved this pie. I followed the directions except for the cinnamon. I didn't use it because I didn't think it would suit my family's tastes. Overall it was a great tasting pie. I will definitely make this one again.

I loved this pie! I used fresh, sweet strawberries, so I took the sugar down to 3/4 cup. I adjusted a few others things too- 5 tbsp of cornstarch instead of 1/3 cup flour, reduced cinnamon to 1/4 tsp, and added 1 tbsp lemon juice. I also did a lattice top rather than a full crust. I baked it for 80 minutes at 375F. The pie was delicious and not runny at all!

I made this as the recipe listed here.  I made two of these and took to work and got rave reviews!  I did add milk and sugar to my crust (as I always do), and this added just a hint more sweetness to my tart strawberries.

EXCLUDE THE BUTTER! This pie is absolutely delicious if you exclude the butter, brush some egg on the top crust, and wrap the edges in foil while baking to prevent them from browning too much. This is my go to pie for holidays! I love it! And this is coming from a person who doesn't really like pie!

Fabulous pie.  Absolutely delicious.  Just like my mother  used to make.  She never wrote anything down, so I searched for years trying to duplicate her delicious results.  This hit the spot.  Won the  gold medal!  My family and I all enjoyed it, with each saying "it's just like mother's".

Do cover the edge of the pie 1/2 way through baking, to prevent overbrowning.

Too, watch the pie, when the juices begin to bubble through the vents slashed in the top and the crust is golden brown, it's done.    It you cook it too long, you will lose a lot of the delicious juice from the pie.  It will be on in your oven,  I know!  

You may want to adjust to flour, increasing if you like a thicker juice in the pie.  I made the pie exactly as the recipe stated and found the juice to be just fine.

My family loved this pie!  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. I also used 5 cups of berries. I also used the suggestion of half and half on top of the crust sprinkled with sugar. Created a pie with a nice golden brown appearance. I also covered the edges of the pie with aluminum foil for -5 minutes of the baking time so my edges didn't get too dark.
Am making this pie again per my family's request!

Wonderful recipe, but WAY too much sugar.  I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup, and it was perfect.  I also substituted a whole wheat crust, and used whole wheat flour in the pie itself.  Heaven!

Delicious.   I used frozen strawberries that thawed with a ton of liquid so I followed the advice of someone else and added 3 tbsps of corn starch to thicken.  I added 1 cup of sugar and that was perfectly sweet for me.

I eliminated the cinnamon and did not put all the flour mixture into the pie. I'm glad I didn't. The pie consistency was spot on. I think the taste was good. With this pie, the crust choice is crucial. I use Ruth's grandmas pie crust (simple and delish with butter flavored baking stick). As far as it goes a cobbler is much easier with similar flavor.

Fantastic! I would absolutely not change a thing. I have never used cinnamon in a berry pie recipe. I was so glad I did! Thank you for sharing. My husband, 3 sons and I had a fantastic  dessert!

I give this recipe 4 stars for one reason. After reading reviews, I just couldn't follow the recipe as written. I believe this recipe is excellent though! Like others, I added approx 1 tbsp cornstarch so that it'd help thicken the sauce. I used about 1 C sugar since my strawberries were pretty sweet and about a 1/3rd C flour, then just sprinkled in cinnamon (I'm not a huge cinnamon fan).
Baking time was followed as stated, but for someone who hasn't made fruit pies before, one big tip is to put it in the fridge to chill. That is what actually makes the sauce set so it isnt runny. When I let it chill onthe counter for a couple hours it was still warm and very runny. The next morning, you can slice it amd it holds its shape so well! 
Thanks for sharing such a great recipe!

I tied making this Recipe before but it was a little runny so I added 1/4 cup of flour to help it not run and added 1 full teaspoon of cinnamon . Turned out perfect and it was the best pie I made so far.

Made this pie on 3 different occasions. Each time the flavor is delicious, everyone loves it! But the only problem is the pie turns to liquid. It's more like strawberry soup than pie. I can't seem to figure out how to thicken up the sauce. Any tips? I use exactly what the recipe calls for.....

This pie is AMAZING! I will say that I should have read the other reviews before as the cornstarch is a necessary addition, without it the pie is runny. I also made mine with a homemade crust vs store bought.  I think its better that way but, 6 1 half dozen the other the pie will blow your mind!

I have never made a strawberry pie before and  I wanted a pie with a top and bottom crust which is hard to find.  This recipe is the best!  The only thing I changed was I added 3 TBSP of cornstarch like others suggested.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  The only thing I did was right after it came out of the oven was I put it directly in the fridge to cool.  When I tried a piece a couple hours later, it was not runny at all - it stayed together and was delicious!

Overall a good pie. I added a few tbsp cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers and that made a big difference. I also added 1 tsp vanilla extract and made a lattice top. I think that the lattice helped reduce soupiness. I wasn't partial to the way the cinnamon flavored the pie but my guests were.

This had good flavor. My family loved it and I liked it too. I personally prefer strawberry shortcake though.

I used frozen strawberries I had in the freezer from last summers harvest.

Next time I will reduce the sugar a bit, add a bit of corn starch and let it cool completely. It was pretty runny. 

A wonderful addition is to make sure you brush the top crust with milk and sprinkle it with sugar or Cinnamon and sugar.

I followed the recipe except I made it into 5 mini-pies because I like to give them away to people. It came out just great, not too runny, sweet but not too sweet. I used my own home made pie crust, and a friend told me it was the best strawberry pie he's ever had!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for my husband who requested a strawberry pie and I've never made one before. He said it was really good (to his surprise because he originally wanted it made with syrup.) He said it was just like an apple pie, but with strawberries (because of the cinnamon) Very easy to make. It was kind of runny, but that didn't bother my husband.

Fantastic recipe, though I did make a few changes: I added 1/4 cup of Tapioca, and 1/2 tsp of Corn Starch to thicken. Brushed the top crust with egg and sprinkled with some sugar. Will definitely make again.

THis recipe was extremely tastey and easy to prepare.  It was more "cobbler-like" in it's consistantcy though.  We were hopeful, since others had no trouble with it being too juicey, but we would have to side on the "juicy" side of the group.

This would be a great dessert for family, who doesn;t really care about looks, but taste is everything.  If you want presentation, then you will love this, until you cut into it.

This pie was very juicy, I had to drain a little when I took it out of the oven, but it didn't leak all over like others. I added some cornstarch but made the mistake of also adding flour and it did taste a little floury. Husband said it was bland. Don't think I'd make this again.
