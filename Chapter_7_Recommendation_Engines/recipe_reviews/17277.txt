Man all I wanted to do was try eggnog. I really hope this is a bad example of the recipe because i'm certain no self respecting american would even think of drinking this! Sorry, just not nice at all. Hopefully I'll find a better recipe somewhere else.

this tasted good, but not very "eggy", it tasted like sweetend milk with whipped cream and rum. next time i might try adding more eggs.

Followed another reviewer's advice and doubled the egg yolks, and added vanilla.  We never put Rum in our eggnog and think it's delicious that way.  One thing the recipe doesn't mention is that to form stiff peaks in the whipping cream you need to also add sugar to that (about 2 Tblsp).  This also makes the recipe sweeter - We serve the whipping cream on the side so each person can make it as sweet as they like.

Just add vanilla and double the yolks - you will enjoy it a lot!  We dropped the sugar, but it was too unsweet, so be sure to follow the recipe or use more if you have a sweet tooth :)  Merry Christmas!

Very good starter recipe.  The only changes I had to make was doubling the egg yolks( I agree with other reviewers without this it isn't eggy enough like eggnog should be) .  I also added 1 tsp of nutmeg to the eggnog itself because it was alittle too plain for how we like our eggnog.  I didn't add in the rum but kept it as an option on the side so the kids could enjoy it also.  With the changes I made it came out thick and oh so yummy.  Everyone at our Christmas loved it.  I also made this the night before due to time constraints the next day and it kept perfectly.

Just silky smooth, thick and delicious. Not too sweet. I doubled the eggs like Jacobow said on a previous comment. Merry Christmas!

I personally don't drink eggnog so I made this for my husband who could drink eggnog poolside in Miami. Anyway, I asked for his feedback and will pass it on to you. He says it's not as thick as he likes it but overall the taste was excellent and is now on the lookout for a double boiler for me (YAY!) so that I can make this all year. So thanks for the great recipe that earns me new kitchen awesomeness. :-)

Delish!  Increased the eggs and used powdered sugar in the whipping cream with a touch of vanilla and   2/3 Brandy and 1/3 dark rum.  WOW!

I also doubled my eggs.  Added nutmeg and vanilla and a little extra sugar to the milk also added sugar to the whipped cream.  you could definitely tell the eggs were cooked.   I used Southern Comfort instead of rum!  adds a bit more flavor.  I'm not crazy about this recipe but for those who need to avoid raw eggs I think you will be satisfied.

Make this every year.  I use rum extract instead so the kids can have it too. They love it!!

I've started a tradition with my 9 year old and she looks forward to us making eggnog  at Christmas time.

Vanilla Nutmeg and Cloves were necessary.  Thanks for the small scale recipe! 

  I used a dark rum (Mt. Gay) it gave less of an alcohol taste to it than when I used light rum.
