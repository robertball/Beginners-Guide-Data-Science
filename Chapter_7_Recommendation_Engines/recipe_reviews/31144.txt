this is such a great recipe. i was skeptical at first because sweet and sour pork varies so much between different restaurants and sometimes it is downright disgusting. this recipe really turns out better than any sweet and sour pork i've had in chinese restaurants. my boyfriend requests this all the time!

i use cubed pork tenderloin because that's the only kind of pork i buy. i add carrots to the sauce mix, and i usually make 2 or 3 times the amount of sauce and freeze the extra to cut down on future prep time. it looks a little gross when you first start to thaw it, but bring it up to a boil again and it returns to its proper consistency.

This recipe turned out quite well. I sliced the onion into thicker rings, and then sliced those rings in half, instead of the big chunks. It seemed to work better, as nobody I know enjoys biting into a huge chunk of onion. I stir fried the veggies, prepared the meat as stated, but did NOT add the vegies to the sweet and sour sauce. If you do that you will get soggy vegetables, that will kill all the niceness of having them in this dish. Leave the veggies on the side, until a few minutes before serving, THEN mix them in. You will have crisp vegetables to offset the pork losing its crunchyness from the sweet and sour sauce. Or you can not put the pork in either, until ready to serve, and everything is crispy.

This recipe was great! I did not change any indredients only thing I did differently was mixed all my liquids in a bowl together before I sauted my vegetables. I rather my mixture sit in a bowl as a mixture instead of adding it step by step to vegtables and meat. And it was AWESOME....will do this again...and again...and again..you get the picture :)

Fantastic and "better than take-out" (so says my NYC take-out-raised husband). The only changes I make are to add carrots and use whatever color bell peppers are prettiest when I'm shopping. I also usually double this recipe for our family of five (plus leftovers for lunch, yay!) and so use a mix of peppers. Oh, and for the sauce I drain the pineapple (unsweetened) juice into a measuring cup, add a splash of maraschino cherry juice, then add water to bring it up to what the recipe calls for.  Then I cook my sauce on the stovetop while I'm frying / stirfrying. Once it's slightly thickened I add the pineapple.

 But overall, this is a PERFECT recipe. Don't wimp out, deep fry the pork, everyone will be thrilled that you did! *Update* Now several years after my initial review I just wanted to add that two out of three of my kids request this as their birthday dinner every year. The whining/begging/wheedling starts about three weeks in advance! (I'm no slouch around the kitchen, but this is a recipe for when you feel like hanging in the kitchen for a bit, it definitely takes me about 2 hours.)

Awesome!  I totally did the short cut method with this recipe to make it even quicker and easier for a weeknight meal - I used pork chops, cubed and stir fried (marinaded per recipe first though), and a bag of frozen stir fry veggies.  It went perfect with the sauce and was delicious and easy.  Definitely a keeper!

This is awesome.  I changed nothing. It was good.  Does taste just like take out chinese.  Will make again.  Does take a lot of prep work, but agree now that I am familiar with the dish, will move much faster the next time.  You could actually prep the meat in the egg mixture the night before and marinate it, along with cutting up the vegetables, and that will save a lot of time.  Sauce can probably be mixed the night before and refrigerated to save time also.

I have shied away from attempting asian food at home because it never tastes like the restaurant quality, but this was different. This was so delicious and hard to belive it came from my kitchen and wasn't from a chinese restaurant. The best sweet and sour pork I have ever eaten. It was so simple to prepare. Thanks for sharing this fantastic recipe! My whole family loved this. Everyone had seconds. I used pork tenderloin instead. I served it with steamed Jasmine rice and stir fried green bean/wax bean/baby carrot blend. Yumm!

Takes a bit of time and work, but the end result is fabulous.  Personally, i like my pork crunchy so i fry it and add the sauce before serving my plate, for my husband who likes his pork softened i add the pork to the sauce itself.  Excellent recipe, tastes pretty close to the resteraunt, only it hasnt been sitting in a buffet getting who knows what put in it!  Great recipe, thanks to Pam for posting it!

I made this with my cooking class and we increased the amount to make enough for 60 people.  The amount of sugar worked out to 10 cups... we cut it to 5 cups and it was really tasty.   We can't even imagine how sweet it would be with the full amount of sugar that was suggested.  We also didn't deep fry the pork or use the egg whites. We did season the pork and let it marinate for an hour while we got the veggies and sauce ready.  Then we cooked the seasoned pork in the oven at 375ÂºF for 45 minutes - 1 hour until it was fully cooked.  We made the sauce separately only using the pineapple juice, the pineapple and the water, ketchup, vinegar, lesser amount of sugar,  adding 3 cups of sliced waterchestnuts  for crunch.  We cooked the sauce ingredients and then thickened it with the cornstarch and cold water.  After cooking it for 5 more minutes we mixed in the cooked pork.  It was wonderful.  We made pork fried rice to go with it.  SO THE WHOLE PURPOSE OF MY DIATRIBE IS TO SAY "TRY THE RECIPE WITH ONLY HALF OF THE SUGAR IN THE SAUCE, DON'T DEEP FRY THE PORK AND IT WILL BE MORE NUTRITIOUS."  WE used the diced veggies for the fried rice.

This was super-awesome!  I have to admit, I was really unsure after I started making it because the ingredients just don't seem like enough.  I was soo wrong.  I used cubed pork chops and marinated them overnight.  I fried them in a pan with a bit of olive oil then added the meat to my wok with all the veggies, poured in the sauce and waited on the rice!  There were no leftovers in our house! Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent overall.  Some suggestions: Please do not use frozen stir-fry veggies.  It changes the dish and isn't the Chinese-American sweet-and-sour. 3/4 cups sugar for a pound of pork is way too sweet.  I used 1/2 cup and that was plenty.  Do not cook the veggies till soft; cook just long enough for the peppers to change color so they stay crunchy.  Lastly, to save a step, mix the cornstarch with the sauce before bringing it to a boil.

I made this last night and my family loved it! My husband who is chinese raved about it and so did my seven year old daughter. I did not add celery but used red, yellow and orange bell peppers instead. I do have one suggestion regarding the sauce being "too watery". Whenever a cornstarch solution is called for thickening, I always make more of the cornstarch solution than the recipe calls for. That way, I can add more if it's not thick enough. I did find the 2 Tbs cornstarch with 1/4 cup of water too little to thicken the sauce. Just add more of the cornstarch solution  to the sauce and it's perfect! I also added the fried pork after the sauce had been thickened and just coated the pork to keep the "crispiness". The sauce is delicious!

Made this tonight for the first time and it was outrageously good!  The first bite my wife took her eyes went wide and she said, "Oh my God this is incredible!"  And she was right, this recipe is the best Chinese I have ever had.  The sauce in particular was INCREDIBLE and an identical match to what I have had at some of my favorite Chinese restaurants!

I made a few changes from the recipe as written.  

I used pork tenderloin as it was all I had on hand and I used a regular yellow onion instead of green onions. I simply beat a whole egg rather than using egg white for the marinade.  

Instead of frying the pork in a deep fryer I used 2 Tbsp of vegetable oil in my wok to fry everything and just turned the pork to brown it evenly on all sides.

And finally I left the sauce on the side rather than mixing it in the finished meal.  I don't like a ton of sauce on my food so I spooned just a little over my plate and it was melt in your mouth good.

Overall I will say that on my first try with this recipe it was better than even the BEST Chinese restaurant I have ever been to.

Thanks so much for sharing this!

This was easy, very tasty and it looked good!
I don't deep fry -so I substituted a pork loin steak and cubed it, marinated as directed and then cooked over a high heat for about 8 minutes.  Other than that, I followed this receipe exactly.  I am sure the fry method was probably better, but I am lazy and prefer not to deal with the oil.  This was tangy and sweet, really delicious.  I am adding this to my regulars.  I will many times in the future.  Thanks!

I pan-fried the pork in 1 Tbsp of canola oil to cut down calories and it was delicious! I also used frozen stir-fry vegetables. Yum! Thank you for sharing this wonderful family recipe!

oh man this recipe is a keeper. I was just perusing the site looking for some stir fry recipes and chanced upon this one and I am SO much more than pleased. If I could I'd eat this every day, having a very pronounced sweet and sour taste bud, I would. So much better than carry out! Everyone in my house from all age groups scarfed this meal down.

We have Chinese Restaurants here in South Africa, serving similar, and this is my favourite take-away. Alas, after preparing this for my family, we will no longer be getting take-aways as this is MUCH better. (with Allrecipies, I am systematically working mysef out of evenings off with take-aways...)

Excellent 'as is,' no changes. I chose this recipe because the country I'm in has substandard take-out. The only suggestion I have is related to prep of the sauce. If you mix the corn starch with the sugar and then add the other ingredients, the likelihood of lumps is eliminated and it saves you a step. Also, I substituted pineapple juice for the water and cut sugar to 1/3 cup, plus used fresh pineapple because stores here don't sell canned pineapple. With white sugar in the recipe, corn syrup in the ketchup and heavy syrup from the canned pineapple, it's no wonder people think the sauce is too sweet. I keep all components separate and let everyone choose whether they want soggy or crispy pork/vegies. A great recipe!

I made this last night and my wonderful man (who also cooks) declared it to be the best chinese dish he has ever tasted! It tastes better than what you get at the chinese restrauent, and the pork comes out amazing flavorful and juicey. I also waited till the last moment to join the sauce, veggies and meat so everything would be crispy. Amazing!

This was a good version.  The sauce was very much like takeout.  I enjoyed it while my family didn't care for it.  Added a little extra cider vinegar to cut the sweetness.

WOW!  I never thought I could make anything like this.  I pan-fried the pork instead of deep frying and added about a tsp of freshly chopped ginger to the marinade.  I also added more veggies (green beans, red bell pepper, and broccoli) because I had them on hand and cut the onions smaller based on another reviewer's comment.

This reciped impressed my family tremendously! They don't like green pepper so I substituted sliced carrots -- I also added about a tablespoon of chili powder to give it a kick. Other than that I didn't change anything. It was delicious and tasted better than our local Chinese restaurants sweet and sour pork! Served with steamed rice and eggrolls purchased from the markets frozen food section.

This was very tasty!  Next time I might cut back on the sugar a little and add some Bok Choy.  Thanks for a terrific recipe.

This wasn't difficult to make and we really liked it! I followed the recipe and didn't make any adjust ments and it turned out very good!  Thank you for sharing! I made some rice and cut up a few green onions into the rice and it was a meal in itself!

This recipe was AMAZING! I followed exactly except used boneless chicken instead of pork. I also did as other suggested and did not combine everything together until the meal was ready to be served and then I placed the chicken on the top. Will definitely make again!

Very yummy. I think the pork should be added on top, not mixed in with the sauce as it gets soggy & looses its crispness. The sauce also needs to be boiled for quite awhile to thicken up nicely.

My boyfriend made this for our dinner last night after I found the recipe.  It was so good!  Definitely better than the ones you get at the restaurant.  The batter for the pork with the green onion is perfect!  We did omit the celery but it was still good.

My whole family really liked this.  I would give it 5 stars for flavor, but making it was kind of a drawn out process.  The meat is what took the longest.  But, VERY tasty.  Thanks for sharing!

REally loved this!  Cut sugar back some and it was still sweet.  Also used pork loin (it is what I had on hand) and added a dash of red pepper flake.  For people having trouble with clumping cornstarch, when you add the cornstarch and water mix them together before adding it.  Even my 2 year old loved this!

This was a case where I looked at all the ingedients, knew I had them and started....only to find out how much oil and sugar was involved. When I read 3/4 cups sugar, I was about to stop cooking but thought this would be a good treat at best. Well it was soooo sweet. Keep in mind, I always try to eat healthy as I have children that learn from my cooking and eating habits... If that is you, this is not the recipe for you. Basically I will not be making again. If you do make it, I would suggest cutting WAY down on the sugar, baking the chicken cubes (with the sauce it would not taste different at all) and steaming carrots, peas and green beans to the mix.

I loved this.  The cornstarch coating made the pork crispy which I thought made the recipe what it is.  I will make this one again.

This is an absolute must in the family now.   Everyone loves this recipe.  The first time I did it just as stated, but the second time I tweaked it, adding an extra 1/4 C. each ketchup and apple cider vinegar as well as 2 rounded T. brown sugar.  Both are great...this tweak intensifies the sweet and sour.

This was my 1st try at a homemade Sweet/Sour sauce. I will never go back to the jars again. So easy. So good. I followed the recipe. It was a bit of work, but well worth it. I'll try shrimp, beef, chicken next.

One of our favorites. Fresh pineapple makes a huge difference, if you can find a good ripe one.  I also use red peppers and  red onions to add a little more color.  I try not to cook the veggies too much before adding the meat and sauce, because I prefer them a little crisper, not quite as limp, but that's purely a matter of preference.  I also took the recommendation of some other reviewers and pan fried the meat rather than deep frying it and it was still wonderful.  I really like using the cornstarch instead of flour (like I see in a lot of other recipes).

Edit: also makes INCREDIBLE orange chicken. Just sub chicken for the pork and instead of pineapple juice use the juice from one orange and zest from half of it.

This recipe was fantastic!!  I made it last night and it was a hit with the whole family.  Instead of breading and frying the pork, I just browned it with a little oil, just to make it a little healthier.  it was great.  We ate it over a bowl of rice and it was excellent!!

This recipe was awesome, a little time consuming, but worth it. The only changes I made, was to keep the veggies,meat,n sauce all seperate, and let the family add sauce to their taste. This one will be made again.

This recipe was better than Sweet and Sour from a restaurant.  I made the base of the sauce while the pork was cooking, and thought it tasted too sweet but once we added the vegies it was PERFECT.  Thanks!

I usually only prepare recipes that have 50+ reviews. That's a mistake.  This was absolutely wonderful. Restaurant quality or better.  Like other reviewers, I made small adjustments.  I used pork loin, marinated 4 or 5 hrs, used 1 red bell, 1 green bell and 1 stalk of celery.  Increased the soy in sauce to maybe 1 tables. Increased cornstarch slightly to thicken sauce. Cooked veges till crisp tender and removed. Thickened sauce, then added both meat and veges back to sauce. Your husband's grandmother taught you well, thanks for sharing.

It's nice to find a recipe that lives up to the comments and is definitely better than take out. I added carrots and it was delightful. The family was so happy with it they did the dishes happily, and there were a LOT of dishes!! What a mess :)

I lost the recipe that I use to use for Sweet and Sour Pork from my divorce so I have been searching for a good one...this one is a little too sweet so next time I will use less sugar.  I didn't use celery but I did use carrots sliced on a bias.  I didn't realize I didn't have cornstarch left so I used flour.  2/3 c for the pork and 2/3 c for the sauce and it turned out great :)  This will now be my new recipe to use, just lessening the sugar a tad...thanks!

Definitely a keeper!  The only thing I changed was to substitute maple syrup and honey for the sugar!  More excellent!  :)

This took a little longer to prepare than what I thought and a few too many calories, but MAN what a great meal!  Brown rice added and it was truly the best take out from home!  I suggest you cut the veggies real chunky.

This is delicious.  Made as per recipe.  Love the coating on the pork.  Just right.  I would like to add some hot pepper next time.

Delicious, easy meal!  My only issue was the super sweet syrupy sauce, next time I will use less sugar.  I didn't follow the deep frying part, I just sliced up some pork roast from the night before and threw it in last.  Can't wait to make this again, tweaking is just a bit for our family's tastes.  :)

Excellent, easy recipe.  I don't eat pork so I used chicken.   I also added red bell peppers. The only suggestion I have is that you premix the cornstarch and 1/4 cup water so you don't get cornstarch dumplings when you dump the cornstarch into the boiling apple cider mixture.

I followed the recipe as written  with the exception of using a red pepper in place of a green.  Green peppers are too bitter.  I really like this recipe and I am one who ran away screaming from sweet and sour sauce with celery and peppers.  It pairs really well with the pork and adds a lovely complexity.  I highly recommend trying this recipe.

This is, in all honesty, a bit labor  intensive, and messy.  That said, it's worth it all. Didn't change a thing.  Nothing I can add to over two hundred  well done" reviews. But everybody loves  to hear ty's.  And this lady deserves it. So thank you PAM_1, well done. Try this  when you have the time to spare, friends, you will not regret it.

This was a great recipe. Not too complicated to make, and the taste is practically identical to authentic Sweet and Sour Pork you find at the restaurant.

I'm a very picky pork eater, and Chinese food is a hit or miss for me. Next time I would do a slightly lower frying heat or time and compensate later for a more tender tasting pork.

Overall a great recipe!

I made this last night...nice and easy recipe.  I used chicken instead of pork and pan fried it as well instead of deep fat frying it, and it turned out fine.  Probably not as yummy as deep fat frying but a little healthier I guess! :) My husband loved it!  Thanks for the great recipe!

I doubled this recipe for a small group of friends and everyone raved. It was a bit time consuming, but well worth it. I substituted pork loin for the pork butt and used red and yellow bell peppers instead of celery. My husband said it's the best sweet and sour he's ever had. Definitely a keeper.

Loved the flavor of the sauce.  I did one change.. instead of coating and deep frying the meat, I used a pork tenderloin and cut thin into one inch strips and just pan fried and added to the veges when done.  Definitely something I will make again.  I might try adding a few chili pepper flakes to add some zing... Thanks for sharing

Loved the recipe, but there is a much easier method to making it. Be sure to do all prep work before beginning, because cooking goes fast. First: combine the 2 T. cornstarch & 1/4 c. water in a 4-cup glass measure. Then add all the other sauce ingredients & stir. (I also start my rice too.) Cook the pork in  Wok, push to side when almost done and add the veggies. When they are almost tender, mix the pork & veggies then pour in the sauce mixture. Cook & stir until thickened. Good stuff. Thanks for sharing.

Perfect recipe! I made 1 1/2 recipes and was able to freeze half. I bought a bag of stir fry peppers and onions and it was less expensive than buying fresh and so much easier as well. We'll definitely be making this again!

I loved this recipe! My husband said it was the best sweet & sour pork he's ever had (I've never had it so I had nothing to compare it to but I loved it).  I substituted some veggies - garlic scapes for the green onions and bok choy for the celery - because I had them on hand from my CSA share. I also added carrots since my kids love them. Everyone loved this and I will definitely make it again!

This needed something. I know that the flavor was there, it just wan't strong enough. I added more soy sauce and I think it could have been better with more ketchup. I might try to work with this recipe some more, but I was disappointed with the flavor.

This is very good.  I tried a similar recipe in a Chinese restaurant.  Instead of adding green onions to the marinade/flour mix, I added small chunks of jalapeno.  It was awesome!

Absolutely the closest to authentic cuisine I've ever had from home! This dish is wonderfully tasty and worth the little extra work. My family of 7 loved it - and we're an eclectic bunch! I only recommend leaving out the additional sugar as the pineapple juice was enough for the "sweet" in this recipe. Also, I substituted pork loin chunks for the pork butt. The pork butt has tons of flavor and I'm sure that would make this recipe even better if it's possible, but I had loin on hand and it worked great. The meat was NOT too tough, it was very moist! Tonight, I'm making it AGAIN and I'll keep on making it because it certainly is a favorite in our house!

Tried this for dinner tonight.  Everyone liked it.  I did use cut up boneless chicken thighs.  I just stir fried them with minced fresh garlic, green onions and fresh ginger.. no batter or deep frying. Next time.. I'll make sure and have some sesame oil on hand.  Think it would have tasted much better with it.  I also used chicken broth in lieu of water and more soy sauce and much less sugar.  Broccoli and carrots went very well with this too!

I have always stayed away from preparing chinese food.  It never ever tasted like the real thing.     This time it even smelled like a chinese restaurant and tasted like in the restaurant.  Plus no glutamate etc to worry about. This is a "do-it-again!!! Thank you so much for posting it!

This recipe was great!  I don't like using store bought sauces with MSG.  This sauce tastes great and all the ingredients are usually on hand.  My husband said that this is a recipe I need to keep handy.

Made this over the weekend.  I added about 1/2 inch of oil in a fry pan and cook strips of pork this way.  The strips of pork were nice and crispy.  The recipe is wonderful!  Excellent sweet and sour pork!  Next time, I will not add the pork to the sauce.  When I serve, I will put the sauce/vegetables on the rice and then top with the pork to keep it cripy.  I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe was fantastic!!  I substituted pork tenderloin for the pork butt, but did everything else according to recipe.  My husband wanted to know where I bought the sauce! I will make this again, it is well worth the time.

This recipe was wonderful! (Even though I substituted tomato sauce for the ketchup.)  I had the leftovers for lunch 2 days later and it was just as delicious.  I look forward to making it again.

This dish is unreal! Sooo good. Made a double batch of this for dinner with my parents and family (6 people). We ate 80% of it. I doubled the soy sauce and fried the pork in a thin layer of vegetable oil in a large skillet instead of submerging it. I used 2 cups of white jasmine rice from Trader Joes with it. This was the best dinner I've ever made from this site. Took about 1 1/2 hours to prepare & cook from start to finish. Amazing! Well worth it.

9/17/2014-I made this recipe for our dinner tonight and it turned out perfect. I started the prep this morning. I used 3 thin pork chops (because that was what I had on hand), trimmed them of fat and bone and cut them into bite size pieces; then I marinated them in the refrigerator for rest of the day. After that I prepped the veggies, cooked them and set them aside for rest of the day. Then I made the sauce; I went ahead and added the pineapple and juice, but left out the veggies, thickened the sauce and set it aside. All of that prep took me about 45 minutes, but the meat was ready to cook, the sauce was made and the veggies were ready to add to the sauce. At dinner time, it took me about 20 minutes to heat the (peanut) oil and fry the pork. While the pork was cooking I added the veggies to the sauce and prepared some white rice. Everything came together at the same time, quickly and easily. I did not add the fried pork to the sauce because we prefer it crispy. The only change I made to the recipe was to cut the amount of sugar in the sauce from 3/4 cup down to 1/2 cup, and it was plenty. I served the sauce over the fried pork and rice and it was fantastic. This dish was the best Sweet and Sour Pork I've ever made. The recipe is excellent and not difficult. I will definitely make this again. The sauce was absolutely wonderful and tasted of restaurant quality, the pork was crispy and the veggies not overdone. This recipe is a keeper and I encourage everyone to give it a try!

I made this for my husband last night thinking that he would like sweet and sour food.  Well, he does not.  Neither one of us liked this dish because we dont like sweet and sour pork, but if you do, this is the dish for you.  That is why I am rating it a 5.  Even though we dont like it, the flavors do come together very well and it is really easy to make. Thanks for sharing:)

Really good recipe.

I wanted a 'calorie reduced' option, so rather than adding 1/2 cup of corn starch and deep frying the pork, I followed the recipe accordingly and substituted 3 tbs of cornstarch and then seared the pork in 2 tbs of peanut oil.

Turned out really great

The only thing my husband will order from Chinese restaurants is Sweet and Sour Shrimp/Chicken/Pork, so I was thrilled to find this recipe.  I made it with chicken instead of pork and we both agree that this is THE BEST Sweet and Sour sauce EVER!  Thanks so much for such a great recipe!

I've made this receipe a few times and it is so yummy. There are a lot of incredients but it is surpisingly simple to make. I do substitue flour for the corn starch when coating the pork though, i feel like it doesn't coat as thick and clumpy.

I have also made it with chicken. Just sauteed, added the veggies and then poured in the sauce, added the pineapple and then the cornstarch/water mixture to thicken. Just as good, fewer calories because there i NO frying :-)

I love this recipe.  Sweet and Sour Pork was always what I ordered at Chinese restaurants and this tastes just as good if not better.  The only thing I changed is I omitted the onion and celery and added carrots and extra green pepper.

this was great!!  loved it, will make it again.  it was quite sweet for my taste, so i will be using 1/2 the sugar next time.  i forgot to purchase the pineapple, so i substituted fruit cocktail for the can of pineapple and it was still good--but pineapple is ideal.

So good! I made it with chicken because that's what we had on hand, and it was delicious! I also just threw in a bunch of veggies I had in the fridge. I made 1 1/2 of the sauce recipe and it was perfect. I would definitely recommend waiting until later to add the sauce to the veggies so they don't get too mushy. Yum!

This was amazing, and in my opinion, tasted like restaurant chinese food. I soaked the pork in roasted garlic teriyaki sauce just cuz I like the flavor and sprinkled garlic powder and onion powder in with the cornstarch to add more flavor to the pork. I also fried the pork a second time to make it extra crispy. I was very happy with the sweet and sour sauce. We served this over jasmine rice. The only thing I would change is (via my husbands request) to keep the sauce separate from the pork for dipping.

This was great!  I didn't deep fry the pork, just fried it in a couple teaspoons of oil.  I cut the onion small and  I used tenderloin instead of pork butt.  I've never reviewed anything before, but I thought this deserved a shout out.  Thanks!

This is a really good recipe.  I used cooked boneless pork loin that I had in the fridge, so I skipped the marinating/cooking part for the pork.  I also added 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar instead of 1/3 cup just to give it more tang and less of a sweet taste.  I will definitely make this recipe again!

I loved this recipe. The only thing I did different was I did not pour the sauce over the meat I left it for everyone to pour over by themselves. I also put out chopped green onions to sprinkle over everything. I added stir-fried broccoli. Everyone loved it.

Very tasty sweet-n-sour pork! Made as directed, with the following changes: (1) Sauteed in 2 Tbsp. oil instead of deep-frying; (2) reduced sugar in sauce to 2/3 cup as per others' suggestion; (3) reduced water by about 1/4 cup to achieve a thicker sauce. Delicious served over jasmine rice with fresh fruit on the side. We loved it---thanks, Pam_1!

I don't understand how this recipe doesn't have 5 full stars, it is to die for!  If you think there's not enough sauce, trust me, there is. I thought I'd make a little more and it was too much.  I thought it could use a little more pork and bell pepper, but that's just my personal preference.  Don't change anything on here and you'll have a great dish, very authentic.  Can't wait to make it for the family!  Thanks!

Awesome!! Having been severely disappointed with sweet and sour sauces before I was scared but so glad I tried it!  Delicious with all sorts of stir fried vegetables and no need to deep fry the pork.  Ooh, great with chicken too.  And if you like it spicy it's soo good with red pepper flakes!

Very good recipe - and, quite easy.  A couple of tips: don't use pork butt, it's very fatty and just a poor cut of meat.  I used tenderloin, but any kind of chop/loin would be fine.  Also, I omitted the celery and didn't miss it at all.  It makes a nice big pot...so, make a lot of rice.

Oh my goodness!  My family loved this recipe, from the 2 year old up to the dad.  Everyone had seconds and ate the leftovers the next day for lunch.  No one ever asks for leftovers in my house!  The only change I made was pan frying the pork instead of deep frying.  The pork came out FANTASTIC!  Couldn't believe the flavor of this dish.  I was skeptical of the ketchup, but I went with it anyway and it was GREAT. I made the House Fried Rice with this dish and no one even noticed I didn't serve egg rolls, which usually gets eaten first.  I usually don't make a lot of recipes over, just the way I am...but this recipe went into my recipe box and will stay there.  It was worth the effort.

A little bit time consuming, but this was definitely delicious. I increased the amount of cider vinegar and took out the pineapple chunks as personal preference, but otherwise followed this to a 'T', and it wasn't bad at all! We served it with Oriental rice.

I haven't had sweet and sour pork for a long time and was casting about for something fairly quick for dinner... this hit the SPOT!  I served it over leftover sticky rice (I always make extra for occasions like this) and it was perfect.  I didn't have any bell pepper, so decided to sub a 16 oz can of well-drained chow mein vegetables and it worked just fine.  Next time, I will use the celery, pepper and onions because I do think it would be even better that way.  I really like the velveting of the pork and green onions... and yes, I deep fried those green onions, too... I had country style ribs in the freezer, so that's what I used instead of pork butt.  Tender and juicy!! SO GOOD!  Thanks for a great recipe, Pam!

This is the BEST Sweet 'n Sour recipe I've ever eaten! I used chicken breasts and cut them into cubes. Other than that I followed the recipe as is. It wasn't too sweet but just right! THANKS!!

This recipe was absolutly fantastic. My entire family including Grandma and Grandpa thought it was great. It was a little labor intensive the first time but well worth the effort. The second time went much faster once I had the recipe down. Thank you so much for sharing a great family recipe......

Takes some preparation time but goes together nicely.  I doubled the recipe, used boneless lean thick pork chops. I made the sauce separately, then added the pork into the vegetables in the wok and mixed the sauce into there.  Keeps the meat crisp.  It was delicious!  It truly is as good as if not better than take-out.  Oh, and I left out about 1/4 cup of the sugar - would have been too sweet with it.

Awesome recipe - I just made a few changes but it's still delicious. I'm an Iowan, and it's summertime, so I grilled a couple thick-cut Iowa pork chops, then cut into strips. It gave the dish a really pleasing smoky flavor. And to think - this only cost a few bucks, and I get the satisfaction of knowing every single ingredient that went into the dish. Thanks for the recipe - it's a keeper.

I had a recipe from a cookbook but lost it so I tried this one and it is even better.  So good!  I added some carrots.  I added the pork back into the veggies that are in the wok and then poured the sauce into the wok and thickened it slightly with a little cornstarch.  I served it over white rice.

I don't even like pork, really, but I was hosting an Asian-themed dinner, so I decided to try this. There wasn't any left over for me to have the next day (a good sign). Warning: this recipe is more labor-intensive than what I would do for a weekday dinner, but it is great for guests or a weekend meal. I bought the pork at my local Whole Foods, by the way, and I was a little shy about asking for 'pork butt', but the butcher knew exactly what I needed. Happy Cooking!

Delicious! I made this recipe the first time exactly as written and we loved it!  Just recently I had a party and used the sauce as the basis for a slow cooker appetizer with smoked keilbasa coins, pineapple chunks, green pepper, onion and marachino cherries. I also added 3 tbsp. of apricot preserves to the recipe as I ran out of Ketchup and ended up a little short for the recipe. The apricot preserves added a subtle flavor to the sauce, however, the original recipe is still 5 stars in my book. Oh, I added more cornstarch, just like other posters recommended, for a thicker sauce.  Yummy Recipe!  Thank you!!  I had several people ask for this recipe at the party, and at the end of the night the slow cooker pot was empty, and people were using the leftover sauce as a dip for the shrimp I made.

I loved this recipe!  It was a little work, but it came together nicely!  I held the meat & veggies out until the sauce was thickened though, to have a crispier taste (like another user recommended)  I also omitted celery & added a yellow pepper :o)

While this recipe does require a little advanced planning, it is well worth the wait. My husband is a sweet and sour maniac. I usually tolerate it. But I have to say this recipe surprised me. I actually liked it. It wasn't too sweet or too sour, and the chickent turned out beautifully. I'll definitely make it again-- only this time I might double the recipe so my husband can have some leftovers.

Wish I could give this 4.5 stars. It's a 5 star recipe for flavor but a 4 star for instructions and technique. The recipe is amazing, tastes better than anything I've ever had in a Chinese restaurant. My entire family loved it and I'll be making it again. However, I found the instructions cumbersome. Instead of using two separate pans and a wok, I used one vessel to complete the entire dish. I fried the pork pieces, removed them as instructed and then removed most of the oil. I placed the veggies in the remaining bit of oil to cook and then removed them. I then made the sauce in the same vessel and added in the veggies and pork when the sauce came to a boil. It went much faster and used two less cooking pots to accomplish the same thing so much faster clean-up, too.

This is a terrific recipe!  I was craving Chinese take-out but we always regret it with all the fat and salt, so I made this and the Easy Fried Rice from this site.  I love, love, love the sauce!  This is perfect as written, the only thing I did different was when it came time to fry the pork I discovered I had only a bit of coconut oil, so I had to "saute" it, and since I used a non-stick skillet, I had no problem at all crisping it up.  Hubs just about licked the plate clean and is now lolling back on the sofa like a lion after the kill!  Thanks Pam!

This recipe was delicious. I used a wok to do the cooking of the pork and vegetables. Also used fresh pineapple and added carrots. I stirred meat, veggies and sauce together only at the end when serving. The sweet and sour sauce is very tasty. This one is going in the repertoire!

a truly perfect sweet and sour sauce! i didnt fry the pork, i just sauteed it...added sziracha to the sauce to make it a bit spicy, used colorful bell peppers, carrots and onions, served over white rice and added some shredded fresh basil over the top - delicious!

This recipe turned out absolutely fantastic, never again I will buy sweet and sour sauce from the store. The only change I made was to substitute the celery for a couple carrots, because my family don't care for celery. (I precooked the carrots for a minute in the microwave).

So much better than what you get in a restaurant! The only thing I didn't do (because I forgot) was to add salt/sugar to the veggies after I finished cooking them.

This was so good I was even surprised it came from my kitchen. I used pork chops since it's what I had in my freezer. I didn't have green onions so I added a tiny bit of diced white for the marinade. I also stir fried the veggies seperate from the sauce with a dash of lemon pepper and they were nice and crisp! However, it also left us with quite a bit of sauce. We served the pork and veggies over ramen noodle since I can't find the rice noodles I like here. It is a ton of little steps but you won't regret taking the time to make this recipe.

I've been known for not following recipes to a T, but did follow the sauce recipe. Did not have time to marinate for one hour and also, I used stir fry vegetables that included broccoli, asparagus, onions, carrots, etc. Dish turned out great and my son and his friend loved it (I test new recipes on them...if it is teenage approved, it's good for me!!).

This is really good. I can't bring myself to deep fry anything, so I just stir-fried the pork in a little bit of oil. Even without the deep frying, it still tastes as good as take-out!

I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce to put on a pork stir fry I had just made. I used the sauce recipe within this recipe and it was delicious! I used brown sugar instead of white, just because it sounded good to me. :-) And I didn't add pineapple because I was out. It was a yummy sauce that I will make again.

This recipe turned out better than expected! The pork was very tender although I used pork loin not butt. Very delicious sauce. We added rice noodles which went very well with the dish.

I have made this recipe as written and it is wonderful. trying to improve our diet I did make a couple of changes to make it a little more healthy. I marinated the pork in soy and onions leaving out the egg and corn starch coating. I pan fried the pork with a non stick spray without the cornstarch coating. To the sauce I omitted the sugar and added 18 packets of Splenda and served it over brown rice. This cut some of the calories and makes Sweet Sour pork on our menu again. My husband never new the difference.

This sauce is WAY better than any store bought sauce, and very close to authentic Chinese take out.  However, to be fair, I made a shortcut version of this recipe.  I had pork tenderloin, and didn't want to waste it, so I made the sauce first - that way, if I didn't like the taste, I at least saved the meat.
I made almost exactly as written except I used 8 oz pineapple juice instead (didn't have the canned).  I also cut down on the sugar a tiny bit.  The sauce tasted very good and was plenty thick enough (I used heaping tablespoons though rather than levelling them off).  I decided not to bread the meat or do the veggies - all I did was stir fry the meat in a little bit of oil (with soy sauce) - then served the meat and sauce with rice (to save on time and calories).  It was pretty good that way but next time I will definitely make as written.  Everyone else is right - that cider vinegar is what makes it taste authentic.  thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! Made with pork and chicken, both worked perfect. Slight variation; added ginger while stir fying the veggies.

I was a little worried about just using corn starch for the breading, but it was perfect. It's easiest to stick the corn starch in a bag and add the pork, close the top and shake it around. I fried the pork in the same wok as I used for the veggies to avoid washing too many dishes. Once you add all the ingredients into the sauce, don't let it cook more than 1 minute to keep everything crispy. The celery adds a great crunch in this dish. If there were more stars to give, I'd give them!

This was good. I used a 20oz can of pineapple and used the juice instead of water in the sauce. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup

A good recipe, though it gets overwhelming after a little while due to the strong flavours. The pork was delicious, and the sauce was very tasty over rice noodles. I refuse to use ketchup in oriental recipes, so I used chili sauce instead, a good substitute. Thanks for the recipe.

Wow! This tastes like the one I order in Chinese restaurants! the cider vinegar really made all the difference. Would definitely make this again!

by the way, try cutting the pork into strip bite-size pieces, and don't overfry them. I also added a medium onion to the marinate..to add sweetnessÃ

Sorry, it was just ok for me. 
Followed the recipe to a T except 2 1/2 TB cornstarch is sauce as some reviewers suggested. Pale sauce that tasted OK, but looked a bit unappetizing and  bit too vinegar-y. I was expecting more of a batter consistency on the pork, but maybe they make it different up here in Canada. Will probably not make again without some modifications. But don't let that dissuade you- I am in the minority. just not to my taste.

i am a vegetarian. i substituted the pork for fake steak strips from Morning Star Farms. this came out amazing!! what a great, tasteful and hearty meal for a vegetarian!! i've learned my lesson on corn starch... never a good idea to just throw it in hot liquid. make sure you dissolve it with cold water before ou add it!! haha.

Fantastic.  My husband said it was the best sweet and sour pork he's ever had.  The only change I made was that I browned the pork by shallow-frying it in a regular frying pan, rather than deep-frying, and it worked fine.

I only made the sauce and it is great, (I used the batter from sweet and sour chicken, we don't eat pork) the sauce was a little bit too sweet, but I never knew sweet n sour sauce was so easy to make at home, I will make this again for sure...

This is REALLY GOOD!  I've made it with the pork and uncooked  shrimp (deep fry only 3 minutes) and chicken.  I LOVE the cornstarch breading!  I don't understand why one should marinate then deep fry the green onions.  I've used fresh brocelli, cauliflower, sugar snap peas, carrots & mushrooms in the sauce. My husband asks for this several times a month.

This was really good!  I only did a few small changes.  I treated the pork the same way except that I pan fried it instead of deep frying (I also made tofu using the exact same method because my husband is vegetarian, and that turned out well too).  I used brown sugar instead of white and only used 1/2 cup.  I didn't realize the pineapple liquid was going to be used before I went to the store, so I bought a fresh pineapple.  I just left the pineapple juice out and it turned out perfectly fine without it.  Oh, and I added mushrooms to the veggie mixture because we had some to use up.  Again because my husband is vegetarian, I left all the different elements (rice, meat/tofu, sauce) separate and let everyone put it all together on their plate (I just tossed the pineapple into the veggie mixture once that was done cooking).  It turned out really well and everyone raved about it!

This is absolutely delicious. It tastes even better than some fabulous Chinese restaurants I've been to. I only had half a bell pepper so I compensated the rest with yellow and red peppers. Other than that, I wouldn't  recommend changing a thing. I'm Mexican so never in a million years did I ever think I could make homemade Chinese food this good. Thank you for sharing.

I would have given this a 5 but there were a lot of steps, although it was worth every step! The only thing I did was added 1/2 cup of brown sugar to it,.  Pork screams for brown sugar. I also doubled the sauce.  Otherwise a great recipe.

This was a success with 2 out of 3.  Since I am 1 this is in the menu...

My variation: I had left over BBQ bnls country pork ribs. They were coated with sauce.  This gave the pork a great taste.

I sadly had no soy sauce but it was delicious without 

I added the cornstarch as directed but it turned to Lil lumps.  Not a big deal but I will dissolve it in liquid before adding it next time.

The best part was I had most stuff on hand! Soy sauce is on my list! Thank you for the recipe

More like 4.5 stars. Great tasting sauce, even though I forgot to buy pineapple chunks and had to sub 1/2 cup orange/lemon/lime juice (squeezed what I had on hand). Hubby thought it only would have been better with a tempura coating. We like others left the sauce separate from the veggies and meat until the table to keep them crisp, but I think the meat and sauce would be better cooked together. Will try that next time - thanks!

The whole family agreed that it was delicious. I added carrots and extra cornstarch slurry (we like a thicker sauce), but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I think having the green onions in the meat while it marinades and then fries adds a fantastic flavor!

This is a keeper. However it's a little on the sweet side. Next time I will cut down the sugar.  We aren't rice fans so I stirred in noodles to make a meal.

Delicious, particularly the sauce. I used 1/2 cup of sugar rather than 3/4 and a small tin of crushed pineapple. I will definitely be making this again and have passed on the recipe :)

Loved it. At first the idea of putting in ketchup sounded weird and the sauce smelled a little off while cooking but this is one of the best I have made off this site. My wife says it was better than anything she has ever eaten from a restaurant. I don't usually write reviews but felt this one deserved it.

Very good.  Definitely takes the prep time it says.  It was too sweet for three out of four of us, and I could distinctly taste the ketchup.  I'll likely make it again, but will have to make some tweaks such as less sugar, less ketchup, and make the sauce thicker.  The pork by itself was delicious; I snuck a few of the pieces while making the sauce!

I tried the sauce portion of this recipe tonight with shrimp and veggies. My husband loved it! I will definitely keep this one. Only bad thing is now I may never be able to get Chinese take out again, when I can make something better at home. Thanks for this recipe!

Okay, this is seriously delicious. After finally deciding what I was going to make for dinner I thought this sounded great! Everybody who has tried it has applauded and said it was the bomb! The only thing that I am going to tweak for the next time is cut way down on the sugar! 

So delicious!

My family is a picky bunch but this was a hit! Our family ranges from 9-18 yrs and everyone loved it. It also was so fun to make with my hubby!!! We did it together and the end result was fantastic! We will totally make this again but next time I'll make sure there's some wine in the house for us to enjoy while cooking??

I had been craving sweet and sour pork for weeks but did not want to buy it from a restaurant (did not want to go against the Hubby's wishes of having homemade cooking)...so when I found this recipe I was very eager to try it. The only thing I did different was put in the excess pineapple juice right after boiling but did not add the pineapples. I omitted the celery (just because it was the one thing I didn't have on hand). After frying and draining the pork, I added the sauce to my used skillet, added the cornstarch/water and thickened it in the pan, then added the pork, veggies, and lastly the pineapple chunks. I cook for my blended family of 6 all the time, and every single person loved this meal. We served it over rice and had some chinese style cooked cabbage on the side, it was delicious. The next day it was great too! I will be making this again, and bragging to my family and friends about the awesome new recipe I found. Thank you!!

this recipe is excellent ! The only thing needed is 3 table spoons of corn starch to thicken the sauce. I also used left over pork from a boneless pork roast instead of raw pork. Came out good.

I didn't follow the instructions for the pork, instead I cubed it and pan fried it.  Not quite the same as takeout, however the result was excellent without the guilt!

Everybody loved it.  I'll absolutely make it many more times.  I will make a larger batch of sauce and save some to make the dish easier to prepare every other time. I did add some rooster sauce to it. To the veggies I added carrots, extra green onion and 1/2 small can of sliced and rinsed bamboo shoots.  Broccoli would be great too. It's a keeper!!

Everyone liked.  Very sweet though so add maybe 1/2 cup sugar less.  Used pork butt, which was real fatty and a pain to trim.  Deep fat fried for 5 minutes a batch.  Mix a little cornstarch and water together and add that to the sauce to thicken before adding meat and veggies.  Only use 1 can of pineapple if doubling recipe.

This recipe is awesome...best sweet and sour sauce (better than takeout) and I didn't even add the pineapple and juice.  It was great as is.  I added broccoli and served it over fried rice.  Delicious and my husband who doesn't like sweet and sour enjoyed this recipe.

I've only made a few recipes twice, tonight will be the third.  Super yummy.  i flash fried my pork in a little oil just to skip some calories.  I now only use cornstarch to fry with. Nice and crunchy.  the sauce is bangin over rice and it is even good 3 days later.

This was very good.  The pork tasted AMAZING before adding to the sauce.  The sauce is a little too sour for us, so next time a bit less apple cider vinegar.  Otherwise a very yummy meal.  Make with broccoli and onions instead because that is what I had available.  Served over white rice:)

Great recipe! I used carrots, celery, red peppers and two onions along with some leftover pork chops and a fresh pineapple.  I about 2T of cornstarch in with the sauce and didn't use it anywhere else and it was just thick enough.

This was delicious.  I did not deep fry the pork, just sauteed in oil.  I was short on corn starch and it still turned out well.  I also left out the peppers and added broccoli since that was what I had on hand. Did not have corn starch for the sauce, but substituted arrowroot which worked just fine.  Will make again!

This was so good.  The sauce was a good combination of sweetness & sourness.  The entire family loved this recipe.  The best thing for me was the cornstarch coating.  I hate the restaurant sweet & sour because the meat has such thick breading around it.  The cornstarch in this recipe was light & crispy and it stayed crispy even with the sauce.

The only thing that tripped me up was the timing. You have to let the meat set with the egg white & onion mixture for an hour.  I guess I didn't read correctly and got caught up in the day and my 5:30 dinner turned into a 6:45 dinner.   To fix that I'm adding a personal note on this recipe.

Oh, I also doubled this as we have 5 in the house & 4 that eat lunch daily so this is a good leftover meal.

Everyone in my family from the 6 1/2 year old to the 11 month old loved it!  Definitely a keeper when everyone, kids included wanted 2nds.  I didn't have any green peppers or celery on hand but had some pork that I needed to use so I just did the top section and the bottom section, skipping the middle veggie section but it still tasted great! Next time I'll do it with the veggies, I'm sure it will just be that much better!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I just made this for dinner, and I can't wait for lunch leftovers tomorrow!!! I got inspired to make this as I had some pork loin to use up.  I only make recipes with good reviews and this one was no exception!!! I served it with fried rice and it was better than take out!  Things I did different: I marinaded the pork last night and also made the sauce last night to, since people were saying it took a ling time to make.  I don't have 2 hours to spend making my family dinner.  My boys don't like bug chunks of pineapple either so I used a can of crushed, still get the must have flavor but no complaints at the table:) I will definitely make this again!!!!

Absolutely Delicious! Tastes like when you go for Chinese restaurant. My kids even loved it (and they are super picky)  We made it with chicken instead of pork, and we baked the chicken instead of frying it and it was great. I highly recommend this one!

Amzing!!! I can't believe I made better Chinese food than a restaurant. As others suggested, I didn't add the veggies or pork until just before serving s othey remained crispy. For my veggies I just used onions and red pepper. So delicious and dangerous..you'll want to make this less-than-healthy dish again and again!!

Outstanding.  Better than any Chinese restaurant.  My very picky husband and my kids devoured it.

I did change things up a little, as we are seriously health conscious.  I did not marinate the pork or fry it.  I just sauteed it in a non-stick skillet sprayed with Pam and seasoned it while sauteeing with a little low-sodium soy sauce.  Cooked the veggies the same way (and added some carrot and red pepper for color).  Followed the sauce directions to a T, except I substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I served it with brown rice.  Excellent.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  Yum!

Recipes like this make me appear to be a good cook.
It got raves from the family and everone had seconds or thirds.  The only problem was the lack of leftovers.

This is a great recipe.  I made a few minor changes.  I reduced the celery to two stalks, added a sliced carrot, and  I did not season the pork and the vegetables with sugar.  I used some boneless loin chops for the meat.  I will be making this again.

The sauce was very good but the pork was way too salty - omit the soy sauce when marinating or cut the marinate time down a lot. I would make the sauce by itself and store it for later use. I used red-wine vinegar and it turned out great.

In a word, Fantastic.  I loved it.  Thanks for sharring. Made it almost as directed, except added 2 hot peppers and some pea pods.  Just added a subtle heat to the dish, so don't be afraid to try adding them.  The sauce is perfect and I can't wait to make it again.

Delicious!!  This turned out wonderful.  Half way into the recipe I realized I didn't have the pineapple, which seems like the essence, but I made it anyway and it was wonderful.  I thought the recipe called for a little too much sugar, so I cut it down a bit, but other than that I followed it exactly and put it over white rice for a great meal.

Best sauce  I ever tasted!  Used Red wine vinegar instead of apple cider, tasted great!  Threw in leftover pieces of pork roast instead of coating and deep frying the pork.  Added sliced zucchini too.   Yummy!

Yummy this was so good.  I had a leftover pork roast that I cooked the night before.  I just marinated, then just lightly heated it up before I added it to the sauce.  I also thickened up the sauce using flour since I was out of cornstarch.

My husband could not get enough of this dish! Very very delicious! It does take a lot of time to prepare, but it is worth every bite! The only thing I did different, was using a higher quality pork, adding in carrots and orange bell pepper, and I used more sugar than the recipe called for, b/c we like our asian dishes sweet! This is one recipe I will make over and over and over again. Truely better than any I have had in a restaurant.

WOW!!  My first time frying anything -- this was an easy recipe.  As another reviewer advised, I used pork tenderloin.  The bite size pieces were amazing even before the sweet and sour sauce was made -- I was nibbling away at the pieces -- so good!!  This goes so well with the Chicken Chow Mein recipe from this site.  (I used rice vermicelli noodles)  SO, SO GOOD!

Very good.  I followed other reviewers' suggestions of reducing the sugar from 3/4 to 1/2 cup and leaving out the 1/4 cup water.  The fried, cornstarch-coated pork is really key to this.  Thanks for sharing a family recipe, Pam.

OK, this is the recipe that was so so good, that I joined allrecipes.com just so I could rate it!  I have four grown kids that will order sweet and sour pork at a chinese restaurant at $12 a pop all night long.  For less money than just one order, I can make 9 orders from scratch!  Only problem: finding a recipe that is not just "as good as" what a restaurant offers, but is better!  After all, I want them to WANT mine more than the restaurant version.  I have now made this recipe 5 times and it has soared to the top of the request list, even more popular than my lasagna!  Sub like crazy, but the "secret ingredient" (apple cider vinegar) must not be replaced.  Tip of my hat to Pam's Grandma....

Delicious!  This meal takes a lot longer than 30 minutes to prepare. It's not a very difficult recipe, but it's just time consuming. I started prepping a few hours in advance (you have to "marinate" the pork for at least an hour anyway.) That way I wasn't overwhelmed and was able to do the steps in the right order. The recipe calls for just 1 lb of pork but the package of pork that I used was 1.75 lbs. I was worried that this would be too much pork, but it absolutely wasn't. In fact, if you used 2 lbs of pork, it would probably be better and serve a bunch more people. I made this on a Sunday which was great because it would have taken too long on a weeknight! I made the Benihana Fried Rice recipe with it, and it was also good. Maybe it was a bit ambitious considering how long it took to make the pork, but it was so good. Perhaps next time I would make white rice or a boxed rice just to make it easier.

This was a terrific recipe, one of my favorite stir fry dishes that I have gotten from this site. I agree with the previous reviewer that said it's worth it to deep fry the pork. I am not usually a big leftover person, but this was good even the next day!

5 stars for taste but be prepared...very messy, lots of prep, clean up work with many pots etc. Made as written except only used 1/2 cup sugar. Just the right balance of flavors. Served with egg fried rice. Yum!

This turned out excellent!! It really IS better than take out chinese. I do have to say that the meat looks a bit funny after being fried in the cornstarch but the taste is still great. Will definitly have to make again!

This is really good!  I have never made sweet and sour pork (or anything for that matter) and this turned out great!  My only changes were that I didn't deep fry - sauteed in veg oil, and I cute the veggies thinner, the way we like it.  I was nervous the sauce wasn't going to thicken but it was perfect!  I think there is plenty of sauce, I actually might add more meat next time.  Great recipe, thank you!

This is really good!  I buy pork loin when it's on sale, slice about half into chops, and roast the other half...except the end pieces, which I now cube and use to make sweet & sour pork.  I often add it to stir-fried vegetables.  Great dish!

This is a great recipe.  To cut down on time I use a packaged tempura mix to bread the pork.  My family loves this and asks for it all the time.

Got the thumbs up from the family for this one ! Taking the suggestions from other reviews, I cut the 1 tsp salt back to 1/2 tsp, and the 3/4 cup sugar back to 1/2 cup. I used a little more than 1 lb. pkg of cut-up stewing pork, and also used 1/2 green pepper and 1/2 red pepper. Together with the pineapple chunks, this made for a nice colour combination. Served this with egg fried rice and homemade egg rolls. Will definitely make again.

I have been increasingly dissatisfied with our local chinese retaurants. This is really good. I doubled the recipe and used a red bell pepper instead of two green for more color. Next time I try prawns stirfried with veggies instead of the frying pork. Thanks soooo yummy.

Great Recipe. Instead of deep frying the pork in oil i fried it in light oil. I would recommend doing that or baking it. This way it is healthier and more nutritional.

Awsome!!!! super easy recipe and soooo delicious, better than our favorite chinese restaurant. Since there is a lot of chopping, I chopped all the veggies the night before(also made chinese fried rice from this site)and prepared the meat as well.  The actual cooking was a breeze.  Love this recipe.  Great job Pam!

took FOREVER to make.  it was really yummy, but it probably wasn't worth it to follow the recipe for the pork specifically, because i couldn't really tell that it had been marinated and deep frying was a hassle.  the sauce was pretty nice, but definitely on the sweet side (due to the combination of white sugar, ketchup, and pineapple juice).

When I first read this recipe I kept thinking there is alot of steps and didn't think it would be worth the work. So I avoided the recipe everytime I looked for something to do with pork medallions. I finally gave in and tried this recipe and was mad at myself for not making this before today. This recipe was so good. I made it as the recipe called, no tweeking.. It has just the right combinations, not to sweet and not bitter. The meat just out of the oil is so good it didn't even need the sauce. The sauce is a very good added bonus and goes great over rice..  The steps are actually pretty easy and now that I have made this I can see where some of the steps can be multi-tasked to make it faster and easier. This recipe is worth the time and is a family keeper..

I've been searching high and low for a great sweet and sour pork recipe and this is it.  The only thing about this is the amount of sugar. GO EASY ON SUGAR, SUGAR TO TASTE. Unless you like it overly sweet. The pineapple juice is already sweet.  I put less than the amount asked for.  Great dish!

I used the marinade and the sauce from this recipe...using pork chops (cut into 1" chunks) and a couple different bags of frozen stirfry veggies I wanted to use up. It worked out quite well! I also substituted fresh pineapple--yum! Overall, great recipe! My bf preferred the fried pork...where I just cooked some in a skillet for my own portion and thought it was delicious. Leftovers reheat fine too.

This Recipe turned out very yummy!!! This is the first time I had ever made such a tasty sweet n sour pork, most of the other recipes I had tried can not beat this recipe and will be cooking this today for my parents and I'm sure they going to love!! it. The only thing I had decreased was the sugar, but otherwise I highly recommend Pams Sweet N" Sour recipe to all!!!  Thanks Pam for sharing your nan's Recipe to the world =)

This was a great recipe. It was better than most sweet and sour I have had out at restraints and sure bets the stuff in the jar. I love using the cornstarch as a flouring agent, I will try this on other items to get that extra crunchy coating. Takes a little while to prepare but worth it. The only modification I made was to stir fry the peppers and onion and add to the sauce right before serving. I also did not mix the pork with the sauce as we like it really crispy.

Very Very Good! I used pork tenderloin as that is what I had. It was delicious in this recipe. The sauce is just right not too sweet not too sour. I didn't find this all too time consuming as some had stated. I found it all came together quite quickly.I was told that the kitchen smelled like a Chinese restaurant. Will make this again for sure. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Thank you! Thank you! Thank you for this recipe. My husband and I have searched long and hard in restaurants in other recipes and others homes for really good sweet and sour because he loves it so much. I feel like I have been let in on the sweet and sour secret. The days of spending 20-30 dollars for it are over!

Other recipes I have tried were complicated and messy. This took the sweat right out of it I couldn't belive it when I was done, because it was so easy and quick.

My only advice would be to chop the onions and green peppers smaller, maybe by half. And make LOTS of rice, we ran out!

I marinated the pork overnight and the meat was very tender. I added some extra colorful vegetables - red bell pepper, carrot and sugar sanp peas. I also doubled the sauce. With all that said, my family did not care for this. I felt it was way too greasy and heavy, and I did cut back a bit on both the oil and the sugar. The flavor of the sauce was good - just too much fat and oily taste. We will try a different, healthier pork recipe.

This recipe turned out awesome! I followed it to the letter-and the result was delicious!It tasted way better than anything you would get from the neighborhood Chinese take out. At least you know what ingredients are going into the dish! I will definitely use this recipe again and pass it along. It was so easy and quick! Thank you!!

This was very good!  I made a couple changes though.  Being a vegetarian, I substituted frozen/thawed tofu for the pork and skipped deep frying and just pan-fried the marinated/coated tofu.  It turned out so good!  I added extra veggies of course.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to skip the salt completely.  Will make again for sure though!

Thanks Pam....OUTSTANDING! 
I did everything in the wok. Meat first, removed to a plate. Then the vegies till softened, added the sauce that was put together in another pot and returned the meat to the wok. Added in the corn starch and cooked till thickened. I will add peas next time. This was a BIG hit in our house.

The flavor was very good.  Frying it was messy and took a lot of time.  Also, my sauce never thickened up... even though I added more cornstarch than the recipe called for.

If you're looking for a heavily battered pork in a bright red artificial sauce, this isn't for you!  Very light and the sauce is wonderful. I only have crushed pineapple, so I added it to the sauce.  Great recipe!

The sauce is very good. I did not like frying the pork coated in cornstarch however. I will use this recipe as written, except no cornstarch. I added carrot and red pepper strips to the veggie mix.

Oh my GOSH this was good!  I used two pork chops cubed and added mushrooms to the stir fry.  I cooked the sauce first, then cooked the veggies and then the pork.  Zapped the sauce and the veggies while pork was draining, served hot with brown rice.  Family raved, said better than take-out, and said they don't normally LIKE sweet/sour (which I didn't know before I started cooking).  It was all gone later that night - no leftovers!

This was great!  A little too sweet for my taste, so I will reduce the sugar next time, but it tastes pretty much like what you would get for Chinese take-out.  I was worried about the deep-frying part, because I hate deep-frying, but it worked out o.k. when I poured about 1/2 inch oil in my stockpot and just fried the cubes in batches.

I was originally going to give this a 3 but everyone in my family loved it!  The sauce didn't taste right on its own but it tasted wonderful with the veggies and pork. I used pork shoulder and added 2 carrots and 1 can of baby corn to the veggie mix. I didn't know how to use the deep-fryer, so I just pan-fried and it was still tasty.  I added the pork to the veggie mix and left the sauce to be poured individually.  Thanks for the recipe!

A great sweet and sour pork recipe.  If your not a big fan of pineapple reduce the amount of pineapple. This recipe is a bit of work but well worth it!

Delicious. I think the apple cider vinegar is the key. Had to use cake flour instead of cornstarch (didn't realize I was out); worked fine. Took leftovers to work and my coworkers raved.

5 STARS!!!  I made this with chicken & it was MUCH BETTER than many S&S chicken dishes I've had at Chinese restaurants.  It was a bit of work with the frying of the chicken but SOOOOO worth it.  I used much less oil for frying by the way.  Make this one for company soon!  Thanks for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe!

My husband did the cooking on this one and it turned out pretty well.  This one is actually hard for me to rate because I actually am not a fan of sweet and sour.  Given that fact, I was pleasantly surprised with this dish.  For me personally it was probably a 3, but my husband is a big fan of sweet and sour and really liked this.  He said the only thing we would do differently is keep the sauce separate.  I would prefer that as well so I could control the amount of sauce.  He also used both pork and shrimp for this.  The shrimp was excellent!

I made this for dinner and my husband really love it. It was not difficult and very tasty. The sweet and sour sauce was light which I really enjoyed.

This is a great recipe. Absolutely delicious. However, the prep time is wrong. Can you please make it at least 1h 30 to account for the marinating time? I forgot about that step and then went to make this starting at 6 PM ... no time to get it ready with the hour marinating time! I feel a little dumb, but altering the prep time might help others in the future. Thanks!

I reduced the added sugar to 3/8 of a cup and added a little more pineapple and carrot.  Perhaps slightly too sweet for my taste but overall quite enjoyable.

No changes, and I would make it again. It had a great flavour and tasted better than I would get at the takeout. I did add mushrooms and I will add brocolli to the leftovers to enhance the food.

4.5 stars.  I have another recipe for sweet and sour that I also like quite a bit.  I would probably make this one again, but it is quite involved and takes 2 hours to make.  I doubled the sauce due to other reviewers comments, but now I know it wasn't necessary.  I ended up with twice as much sauce as I needed and will now need to freeze it for a future use.  My sauce needed more than double the cornstarch mixture to get it to thicken also.  I added sliced carrots for additional vegetables and color and was glad I did.  It needs more vegetables than what the recipe calls for.  Honestly, my other recipe that doesn't require frying the meat is just as good (if not better), and is healthier.

Excellent recipe. It is the first time I've ever made sweet and sour pork and it turned out great. The only change I made was to parboil the vegetables instead of frying them. I cooked them individually in a small amount of water until they were tender crisp and then used the water from the cooked vegetables to make my sauce. Less oil and more vitamins and flavor from the broth. I also substituted one carrot for one stalk of celery simply to give the dish a little more color since I didn't have any red or yellow peppers.  Will definitely save this to do again.

Very good recipe. I did cut down on the sugar for the sauce to 1/2 cup. I added minced  garlic, sliced zucchini, sugar snap peas pods to the recipe to add some color. I did not add the extra 1/4 cup of water at the end of end if the recipe because there was already plenty of liquid to work with. I also added red pepper flakes for extra flavor. I was pleasantly surprised as how yummy this is! I was afraid it would be too syrupy/liquidy, or just generally end up with a soggy mess, but none of that happened. I would have added fresh mushrooms too if I'd had any; I think the recipe as written is lacking in diversity and needs more veggies, which I did add some. I think baby corns would be great here too.

It smeed to be delicious; however, we felt disappointed because it was so sweet.  Of course, I will try to prepare it again, and I consider it is a great dish, but next time I will add half sugar from the original recipe.

We really eat sweet food, just wanted something different. Oh my word such a lovely and delicious dish. Look I found the corn starch messy, but that's because I never work it before, not sure if my bag was to small but the meat parts weren't white like yours, still sticky and red. So I laid the meat out on a tray and sifted corn starch over them, turn repeated till they looked white. But next time I will try a larger bag. Everything else work perfectly. The meat was so tasty, tender, crunchy all in one, would not eat this too often only because of the sugar. But can't wait to try it out again. Thank you for sharing,.

This is the one! I lived in San Francisco for 20 years so I know good take out and this is it! I have tried many sweet and sour pork recipes, but this one beats them all. I made it as written and we ate it all. Empty plates returned to the kitchen means good food! Someone cut the sugar in half and didn't fry the pork and then gave it a 2 star, ignore that person. Listen, if you didn't follow the recipe then you shouldn't be rating it. What you're rating is YOUR recipe because YOU changed it.

What a fantastic recipe!! I recently bought a Chinese seasoning that is hot as hell fire, but the pineapple and it's juice tamed it down to perfection. I don't know what it is, but I think your grandmother would like it

I loved this easy to follow recipe.  I doubled the amount of liquids to make double the sauce because my family loves their sauce.  So much better than store bought sauce and the recipe is better than most restaurants.   I will say that next time I will it dump the meat back into the sauce and that way left overs will be crispy.

This was awesome!!!  I have a deep fryer so that helped and the pork was done in about 4 minutes.  It was tender on the inside and crunchy on the outside.  Now that sauce, omg,  I made a double batch, not that it needed it but I always feel like I need to feed an army when there is only two of us.  Anytime I make a recipe I always make it as written and who is going to argue with a 94 yr old gramma, lol.

Made this tonight and it was wonderful. My husband said it tasted just like the kind you get at the restaurant.  I think next time I may add a bit less sugar since my pineapple was very sweet.  It was juice packed but was sweeter than some I've had.  Anyway, we loved it and gobbled it up.

Great base recipe!! I totally didnât follow the recipe but keep this as my base. I used chicken and marinaded it while I sautÃ©d the carrots until almost done. Then I added the green peppers and onions. Then removed the veggies and cooked the meat. No frying. Then stirred everything together. I the served it over basmati rice. Wow!

I used pork tenderloin because that's what I had on hand. Turned out fantastic. This is as good as the dish in my favorite restaurant. My wife loved it as well. No need to mess with this recipe.

YUMMY!!!! Although  I did make this 5 times more than the recipe, and I shared it with some of my i. One  neighbor told me it was better than she has gotten in Chinese  resturants. Another told me that I definitely knew how to feed a man, and I was a great chef!  I've never made sweet & sour pork before. It wasn't as difficult as I expected it would be. My biggest compliments to the person who submitted this recipe.

I made this last night and it was a hit! Forgot to take a pic before it disappeared. I left out the bell peppers (they donât treat me very well). Also didnât have any green onion but used yellow onion in place. Added some carrots too. I will absolutely make this again!

I make this with chicken breast, marinated for a few hours. It's very good. You just can't eat it the next day, it doesn't taste the same.

This would have gotten a 5 star review from me, but it had an abundance of sauce- which made my meat turn soggy. I followed the recipe to a T, so I am not sure if I may have done something wrong, or if it's supposed to be this way. Still, great flavors- especially on the pork pieces before they went into the sauce.

Very nice. I made with pork tenderloin which I marinated overnight and fried in a cast-iron skillet for about 4 minutes. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Served with jasmine rice and wonton soup as an appraiser.

This was so easy and delicious...will definitely make this again!  
I made a couple small changes....used 1.5 lbs of port butt instead of just a lb.  I used 6 stalks of celery, a large onion and large green pepper .  I used 16 oz canned pineapple chunks with juice instead of 8 oz because I love pineapple! At end I added 1/3 cup more sugar.  I added cooked white rice and allowed to set in juices for about 45 minutes before serving.

I've made this a few times,  sometimes omitting something because I didn't have green onions for example,  Trust me don't do that  :)  It was great, but this recipe is just about perfect as it is written

I use super cheap pork "stew Meat" from Winco, and seriously besides adding carrots as others have mentioned this is literally the best Sweet & sour pork I think I've ever had.

Plan on making this many times and I have shared this recipe with friends and family to try as well.

I added 2 teaspoons of minced garlic.
 I made this for my 93 year old farther in law. After that every time I saw him, he would tell me how good it was, and if I could make it again. So I did! He loved it!

I should know better than try anything that uses ketchup in it. All I could taste was ketchup. It is an easy of enough recipe to make and I had two people like it opposed to my finding it inedible. This is just not for those of us who are not fans of ketchup. This is only the second recipe that I have tried that has called for ketchup and now I have confirmed that if the recipe has ketchup not to make it as I will not like it.

The combo of ingredients seems weird, but it comes out quite delicious! I paired the pork with a stir fry of veggies I had in the house. Better than takeout any day.

I didn't have enough cornstarch so I used flour instead of cornstarch to coat the pork and still achieved great results! I have been trying to find a good recipe for sweet and sour pork and finally have settled on this one. Thanks, PAM_1!

It is a very good recipe, as close to Chinese restaurant as it gets.  Rather than being another person who complains about extremely high sugar in the sauce, yes it is true, Iâm going to suggest adding sugar slowly in portions until it is sweet enough.  I added 3rd of real sugar and the rest substitute and it was still almost too sweet.  And delicious!!!

The sauce itself is perfect.  You could put practically anything in it and it would be delicious!  Made the recipe just as written except sauteed my pork tenderloin chunks in a pan instead of frying in oil.  Excellent recipe.   I will use the sauce recipe over and over again and add different vegetables and meat or seafood for variation.

I was hesitant, bc my partner is not overly fond of the combination of Sweet & Sour. But he loved this recipe, served over rice. Not a difficult recipe, and worthwhile for a regular rotation.

Followed this recipe pretty much to the letter, but I substituted rice vinegar in place of the cider vinegar, and also left the soya sauce out  of the S&S sauce. It's just a personal preference of mine.

I made this recipe last night but I made a few small variations primarily based on my own tastes and preferences. First, I made the sauce with the dissolved corn starch in a separate pan and slowly heated it until it thickened. Second, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added roughly 1/4 cup of wildflower honey. Third, I used red bell peppers instead of green for reduced water content and a more sweet flavor. And finally, I added 4 cloves of garlic in the last minute of stir frying the vegetables. My personal opinion is that this recipe would be great with crushed pineapple in the sauce for a more consistent flavor.  Overall, i really enjoyed this recipe. I will try it next with chicken.

Love this! Next time, I'll simmer the pork first for about an hour so it won't be tough for my pork cubes (it's what I had on hand). And I will use my pancake mix again (so stupid of me not to have any starch in my pantry except for the pancake mix)I would definitely do this again! I'm already thinking of using this for halibut fillets too! I also used apple cider vinegar and about 3x more ketchup.

It worked well in general.   Thanks to the reviewer who suggested keeping things out of the sauce until serving time,   It made keeping the leftovers usable much easier.    

I made the following changes to the ingredients:   cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, substituted mushrooms for the pepper as I can no longer eat the darn things - I love them, but my liver goes into auto-rejection mode right afterwards.

I made a mistake when I added the 1/2 cup of cornstarch to the bowl containing the pork.   I should have spread the pork onto a plate first as it turned into a large glutinous mess when I did it in the bowl.   Made putting the pieces into the hot oil a bit hazardous!   Ah well, I'll know better next time.

Surprisingly tangy and definitely restaurant quality.  The Apple cider vinegar really does the trick.  I added water chestnuts for some crunch and I did add more sugar to taste at the end...we like it a little sweeter than the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again soon.

I really didn't think this was worth the time to prepare and it took me much longer to make this than the recipe called for. If I make it again, I will hold off on adding the sauce to the pork until right before serving because it took the crispy off the fried pork.

I added thinly sliced carrot and zucchini and used cauliflower rice for the base to pour this over...also i made it a bit spicy by stir frying a couple of chili pods with the pork.  So good...

Delicious!   Used leftover cooked pork butt roast instead of coating and frying the pork (and saved a few calories in the process).
The sweet & sour sauce in this recipe is as good as if not better than I have had in Chinese restaurants.
This recipe is definitely a "keeper".

I really like how this recipe is turning out. the only thing I changed is I substituted apple sauce for the pineapple chunks, because my husband is not a fan of cooked fruit. next time I think I'm going to beer batter the pork cubes instead. cornstarch does work well, but it's a sticky mess. my parents always beer battered theirs when I was growing up so I know that will turn out just as well.

Delicious! I accidentally made two and a half portions of the fried pork (I only had a bulk container and needed to use it up) so there was a lot of extra pork. I also added less sugar and in the veggies and more apple cider vinegar in our sauce (we like it sour). It was amazing! We will be making it again and again!

Well what can I say over and above what's already been said. I am a retired guy just learning to cook and have done quite a few recipes now, mostly very successfully. I do follow recipes to the letter (ex Engineer / Project Manager) as you should and this recipe is spot on. The result is better than takeaway and I was delighted with the flavour and consistency of the dish.
Anyone in doubt; do not be, you must try this if you like oriental food.
Thank you PAM_1 for kindly sharing this gem of a recipe.

Made the sauce using chicken stock and lessened the sugar and vinegar *just* a tad. Super flavorful! Added tonnes of veggies and separated the ingredients until serving to keep the pork crispy. Such a good recipe!

This is an awesome recipe. I was trying to use left over pulled pork so I had to alter the way I cooked I but still prepped it the same. I used a skillet with some oil to cook it. The true test of the meal I make is of course my hubby. When he first tasted it he said it tastes like you would get in a Chinese restaurant! Perfect! Of course in the true fashion of me I doubled the recipe. Don't do that unless you plan to either freeze it for later or feed the neighborhood ( I am feeding a family of 5).  This is a MUST MAKE if you like sweet and sour anything!!! I used frozen peas, water chestnuts, green pepper, and frozen pearl onions.

This was really, really good! Better than a restaurant quality! I followed the recipe as written except pan fried in a little oil.  I especially liked the green onions cooked with the pork.  The sauce was absolutely delicious.  I used pineapple juice instead of water.  I didn't find the sauce any sweeter than sweet and sour sauce a restaurant makes.  I mean, if you are eating sweet and sour pork, you should know the sugar content will be high.  It's not going to be "healthy".  I don't eat sweet and sour pork as a staple meal so I don't worry about it!  This is considered a "treat" in my home.  Thank you so much for sharing the recipe with me.  My only complaint is that my family loved it so much they want me to make it everyday!

This is my first time making sweet and sour pork and I'm so glad I chose this recipe. Not too sweet and the apple cider vinegar gives a nice subtle tang.  Will definitely prepare this again.

Wifey loved this one, and she's not generally a fan of the home made stir fry. This is my new go to for sweet and sour pork stir fry. Fresh pineapple was a really nice touch. Used two peppers to up the veggie content.

I made this according to the recipe and the family was pleased. The sauce has just the tang you expect and want. The trickiest part is to cook the pork properly. Mine turned out a bit overcooked in my opinion, but I cut the pieces somewhat smaller, 1/2" - 3/4" cubes because I like smaller bites.

Overall this is not that difficult, but careful planning and prep is a Good Thing (tm). I did everything in a 10" cast iron skillet for the frying and veggies, and a 10" non-stick sautÃ© pan for the sauce and final assembly with good results. I covered both the veggies and the sauce while cooking.

My only negative thought was that the pork never really had a batter so although crisp it didn't have the smooth text text ones gets at a good Chinese establishment.

This will be made again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I made it exactly as written, and it turned out great. It's NOT a quick weeknight meal, it's pretty time-consuming - but worth it. Gramma knew her stuff! For example, deep-frying the pork after dousing with cornstarch was a new technique for me, but Gramma got it exactly right. The result was a perfect, slightly crispy texture that complemented the sauce perfectly. If there's a way to do it better, I've no idea what it might be.  So imho, listen to Gramma! I love to try new recipes, some are so-so, some are good, and a few are better than expected and become keepers. This one fell into the 'wow!' category and is definitely a keeper. Thank you so much for posting it.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I made a whole homemade Chinese cuisine with this, fried rice and crab rangoon. This was absolutely the star of the show, perfectly delicious! Just a note however, it does take time to put together and accomplish but, totally worth every second.

My family and I love this recipe. I made it exactly how the recipe says to... And i've ALSO made it different the second time around because I read another review. I highly recommend using 1/2 cup of sugar vs 3/4 cup of sugar. It tastes the EXACT SAME!!!! A lot of the ingredients have sugar in them as is...  I also used coconut oil  instead of vegetable oil. Healthier :)

It is only a So- So recipe that would have been greatly improved by cutting the amount of sugar in half.  Otherwgise it is like eating candy. I served it at a dinner party for 12 and all but one guest thought it was much to sweet.

AWESOME COOKING.  It take time to make, but well worth it.  I have some family members that are not to keen on onion; so, i substituted the onions with radishes.  Turn out just as awesome without onions.  THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING THIS GREAT RECIPE!!

This was my first time attempting sweet and sour anything! I made this last night,  with pork stewing meat that I had on hand, and it was a BIG hit! Bonus,  it was so much easier that I had anticipated.  
It was so good that were having it again tonight! One thing I did was triple the recipe because the boys  here can eat! This is definitely going to be in my regular meal ritation!

This is one of the better basic recipes. Of course there are thousands of variations. I nearly always cut the amount of sugar by 1/3 or 1/2 though. I have also made this with an orange sweet/sour sauce variation (with some added Cointreau in the orange sauce). Tried it once with some Star Anise added to the marinade, but think I added a bit too much.

My boyfriend enjoyed it, and I loved it myself. Only gonna give this a 4 out of 5 tho because it's not kid approved :( my kids don't know what good food is so i should just give it a five.. anyway only change i made was i added a little brown sugar to the mix (honestly, i didn't have a full 3/4 cup sugar).. oh! and i'm not huge on pineapple so i used about 7oz of the juice from the can instead of using the chunks & the juice. i think it came out great, but my kids are just so picky!

So sickly sweet it was inedible!  The pork was burnt after 10 minutes, even though I'd only heated the oil to 180.  Will not be making it again.

Made as is, only difference is that I cooked the sauce separately from the meat and veggies and combined everything just before serving because I like to keep everything crispy. Good, authentic, restaurant quality meal.

Changes were minor: 
1. Added green onion at the end.
2. Thickened the sauce prior to adding to the sautÃ©ed vegetables.
The recipe turned out very well. Will make again.

This was amazing! I didn't deep fry it. I just put a small amount of oil in bottom of pan and cooked pork that way. I added a little extra soy sauce and less salt but otherwise as is! Really good.

This was very good, but I liked it better when i made it another time and I used chicken instead of pork.  It surprised me, but everyone in the family liked the chicken better too.

I cut the sugar by about half since I find most sweet and sour sauces cloyingly sweet, and replaced the pineapple with mandarin oranges.  I wish there was a way to bypass frying the pork and still get that crispiness and sauce-absorbing coating....

WOW! I usually steer clear of frying anything for health reasons and for the mess it makes plus the smell of my kitchen afterwards, BUT this one is worth all the trouble. It really was an easy recipe and the taste was out of this world! I would match it to the best take out ever! I didn't have green onion or green pepper but I don't miss either. The pork comes out so crispy I ate a bunch of it waiting for the sauce to be done! The ketchup threw me a bit but it works! Awesome recipe!

I made the sauce separately and made 1.5 times the amount.  Put in pineapple core when boiling the sauce for more flavor.  Several said you could freeze the sauce.  Fried pork and kept that separate from the sauce and separate from the veggies.  Added some real pineapple instead of canned.  Also added a carrot, onion, and ginger.  Really good flavor from the sauce.

Quite tasty. Should have added a bit more cornstarch to thicken the sauce a little more, but it's every bit as tasty as your local takeaway, without the MSG hangover. Served it with steamed broccoli for the authentic takeaway experience.

Overall, very good. I followed the recipe as started but used less sugar in the sauce. It was a bit more labor intensive than I prefer for a week night meal and the oil smell lingered awhile. I would make it again, though, because the hubs loved it.

This was a crowd pleaser even among family members who won't order sweet and sour in a restaurant.  I used fresh pineapple so there was not extra juice  in the sauce - but the fresh pineapple was fantastic and it was plenty sweet.  Everyone came back for seconds!

I was skeptical at first, but stick with this.  The recipe comes together nicely at the end with the sweet and sour sauce thickening up after the corn starch addition.

Amazing results!

Great recipe, but I cut down the sugar in the sauce to 1/4 cup and my husband asked me to cut it down further the next time I make. So try 3 tbsp of sugar NOT 3/4 cup as the recipe suggests. That's a crazy amount.

Didn't use salt, either, and with with the soy sauce it all worked out fine.

Like a previous commentator, I baked the chicken rather than deep frying.

It came out tasting like  typical Sweet and Sour Pork.  I could have used a little  less sugar (maybe 1/2 to 2/3 cups), and I think it would have had a little more zing.

I love the pork but the sauce was a bit too sweet and not much sour. I had cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup instead of the 3/4 it calls for.

This was delicious! I had a eft over pork neck from my Christmas lunch and I cut it into 1x1cm blocks and then followed the recipe. It came out really tasty! Would recommend this for anyone who loves sweet and sour pork!

My guys love this recipe. I only make a couple of adjustments. I do add carrots (ya know more vegetables the better) I drain the pineapple chucks and add water to make the one cup of water for the sauce, then I reduce the sugar to about 1/2 add more to taste.  I also add the cooked pork after I serve, because we like it more crunchy..  Some reviewer said this was easy. That is true, but it is time consuming, lots of chopping, lots of steps. Well worth it though. I start the rice right after the sauce so I can serve it all warm.

What can I say but Oh My Goodness! This was so tasty! I doubled the recipe since I had a 2 lb roast thawed. I used one red and one white onion, and three carrots instead of celery. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. The red onion was so good with this since it had it's own sweetness. Served with white rice. the whole family loved it! Not looking forward to the cleanup, but it was worth it.

The flavour was fantastic! Easy to make. Personally I prefer a bit more of a crust on my pork so the next time I make this (which I definitely will), I'll keep that in mind.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!! I follow step for step and it turns out great everytime.. The only thing is when u add the cornstarch and water at the end to thicken the sauce you need to make a slurry, mix the water and cornstarch together, or else the cornstarch will clump up..

Great recipe, the only one ill probably ever us to make sweet and sour anything!! THANKS!!

I thought this take on sweet and sour pork is the best I have ever made. I did use a deep fryer and the pork came out beautifully. The sauce was a hint on the too sweet side. I am going to make this again tonight and cut down a bit on the sugar in the sauce. Also, as suggested by another member, I put the vegetables in at the very end to give the proper texture that I wanted. I also added thinly sliced carrots for color and flavor. Wonderful! Thank you!

Oh my, this was SO yummy! Totally better than any take out I've had, and I LOVE Chinese take out! I doubled the recipe and cooked everything separately in a wok (pork, then veggies, then the sauce). I served everything separate so the pork & veggies stayed crispy, plus some like more sauce than others. Will definitely make this again!

Followed the recipe almost exactly apart from decreasing the amount of sugar to 1/2 a cup. I'll probably experiment with decreasing it even more next time.

also swapped soy sauce for coconut aminos and a dash of fish sauce. And switched cornstarch for potato starch for thickening.

The sweet and sour sauce is the BEST!
I cooked this recipe in a pressure cooker so I did make a few changes.
â¢	omitted the egg white and the corn starch/flour.
â¢	browned the pork in the pressure cooker then added veggies
â¢	Cooked for 15 minutes.  
â¢	Released the steam
â¢	Added the pineapple chunks
â¢	Removed some of the sweet and sour sauce and thickened it with Xanthan Gum (not sure how much maybe 2 teaspoons)
â¢	Put the thicken sauces in the pressure cooker, stirred, put the lid back on and let it sit for a few minutes while I set the table.    YUMMY

Made it as written. Just increased the servings. Takes a bit of preparing but well worth it. Never made before and was good. My boys ate it up! Served with quick n easy fried rice. This Recipe gets added to my meal list.

I never really cared for this dish but husband always wants to order it and always talk him out of it. I figured the least I could is try to make this for him. Yum! I think I may rate higher after I get chance to play with it more but, really good stuff!

Yummy! I cooked the veggies in a wok first and set them aside. Browned the meat in the wok added the sauce brought it to a boil and added the veggies back to the wok and let it cook through.

I used this recipe for the sauce and we all liked it.  It was easy to prep all the vegetables early in the day then resume cooking the sauce later.  Added to leftover pork.

VERY good base recipe.  Thank you for sharing!  Its very similar to one from a Chinese restaurant I worked at many years ago.  I lost that recipe and have been searching ever since!  This one is so close and I was able to recall my old recipe from using this one.  It is a bit different, with the same ingredients: !/2 c ketchup, 1 TB soy sauce,  scant 1/2 c sugar, 1 1/2 cup of water (using the pineapple juice to fill up your cup before adding water), 1/2 tsp fresh ginger, crushed clove garlic.  Then thicken.  While still hot, add the chopped onion and green peppers.  As it cools, add the pineapple chunks. Pour over your meat on the plate.  I use the same recipe for the meat, except leaving out the green onion. I also finish off my fried pork (or chicken) in a 375 oven for 20 minutes or so.

I did not make any changes, and very delicious, but next time I make it I will only add 1/2  cup sugar to the sauce, we found it a tad sweet.

Oh my glory, this was delicious. I was a tad sceptical with all the reviews that raved and said it was just like/ better than take out. But... it is! Yeah, it takes a little more effort than jumping in the car and hitting up your local Chinese place, but it's AMAZING. Make it, make it now!

I was hesitant to use the apple cider vinegar but what a difference that make in the sauce!  It is the secret ingredient!    Pork was tender, crispy and tasty!    Thank you very much for posting this recipe, Pam!

Omg this was the BEST sweet sour pork recipe IN THE UNIVERSE! I feel like a pig I Ate so much! Did not change anything and the Sauce comes out so good I had a jar of store-bought sweet & sour for backup and should EMPTY THE JAR, wash it and ADD THE SAUCE I just made! Oh Jeeez the whole Meal is To die for! Make it!  It looks difficult but sooo easy and delicious! Would give 10 stars if could!

It was good! I have a few minor complaints, though. First, it was too sweet. I'm going to take the sugar down to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4 cup. Second, at least in the states, I've never had sweet and sour pork from a restaurant with pineapple before, and while I absolutely adore raw pineapple, I didn't like it cooked in this recipe. I'm going to try it without at some point and see how it turns out. Finally -- and this was totally my fault -- I bought really cheap pork. I think it definitely would have been worthwhile to buy good pork. Overall, though, a great recipe! (And not so hard to make)

Made it for the first time and it turned out way better than I expected.  I didn't have any pineapple but I found a great substitute... Canned mango just added a squeeze of lime for extra acidity.  So for those that may not be able to pineapple.. It's a nice alternative

I followed the recipe exactly, except used boneless pork chops instead of roast so the cubes were a bit smaller.  Family loved it - will make it again.  May add a bit of crushed red pepper next time.

I omitted the celery and it did not affect the taste. Use banana ketchup for a sweeter outcome.  I cut the apple cider vinegar from 2/3 cup to 1/2 cup, and used only 1 8 oz can pineapple chunks.

My family said it was better than our favorite restaurants!  I found it a little too sweet so I might use just a little less sugar next time but it was AMAZING! I agree!
The only thing I did different was I used pork tenderloin instead of pork butt because that is what I had.  I let it marinate for about 2 1/2 hours.  I also mixed the sauce ingredients together before I started the labor intensive work.  Frying, chopping, sauteeing and trying to measure out ingredients all at the same time sounded ovewhelming, so measuring out that first was a good idea.  I will make this again.  It was delish!

I didn't have any green onions but I didn't change anything else. My kids loved it - To me it is as good or better than take out (Probably because I know the meat is real pork) It was tangy and good !

On my taste was too turned sour. But it is all the same tasty. I would reduce amount of vinegar, would add a little ginger for sharpness. But I am very grateful for the recipe. I looked for the recipe-basis for my variations long ago. Thanks

Made exactly as written (other than using pork loin chops since they were on sale and pineapple "tidbits" instead of chunks because I don't like pine all that much). The prep time is pretty extensive - although I agree with the one reviewer that if/when I make it again, I'll probably prep in stages - e.g., cut and marinate the pork and chop the vegetables the day before. (That's kind of true of a lot of Chinese recipes, though - lots o' chopping.) Great flavor - really does taste just like in the restaurant.

My husband and I didn't really like this one. There wasn't enough flavor and the dish was pretty oily. To be fair, we do prefer Americanized Chinese food. This recipe may just be too authentic for our tastes!

Loved it second time as much as the first.  Did use pork tenderloin.  When doing the vegetables in a wok, at the same time making the sauce in a large frying pan. After thickening the sauce put in the pork and vegetable mix. Just a few minutes to blend the flavours before serving

Made this for Valentine's supper.  It was wonderful - much better than takeaway.   The recipe looks daunting because of the ingredient list but now that I've made it once and understand the rhythm, it will be a breeze next time.  I followed recipe exactly except I used pork tenderloin and left out the celery because I didn't have any.   My whole family voted this as a "do over".

I used only 1/3 cup sugar rather than the 3/4c called for and it was plenty sweet enough.  I also cut up one carrot to add to it.

Will make it again, went with not adding the meat to the sauce. It came out good. I cooked too many veggies, but the kid and boyfriend loved it!

Fantastic sauce recipe! I browned my pork instead of frying, didn't use the egg or dredge it in the cornstarch. I cooked the pork, veggies and sauce separately then combined it all at the end so it didn't over cook. This sauce recipe is a keeper. I used the whole 3/4 cup of brown sugar. I tried 1/2 at first but was still too tart for my taste so I added the other 1/4 cup. I didn't think it was too sweet at all.

This is the best Sweet and Sour Pork I've ever made from a recipe online!  My husband loved it even more!  And my little one enjoyed it too!  (It's hard to please a 7 year old picky eater) I wouldn't change a thing!  Amazing as is!

I followed the recipe, with only exception of using milder, sweet peppers ( yellow, red, orange). I also used 1/2 sugar, and 1/2 sugar substitute, as a family member is diabetic.
Will make this again, in fact the same recipe I lost and made 40 years ago. 
To the person that said it was too sour, make sure you use, APPLE CIDER vinegar, it makes a difference.
I served atop rice, with crunchy Chinese noodles on top.
IT IS A KEEPER!

I tried this recipe n its fantastic. However, I substitute the corn flour with potato starch as I know for a fact that this is what restaurants use for this dish. Cornflour does not make a good crispy batter as potato starch n tends to be a bit powdery. Also I added a little chicken stock powder in the pork marinade to give it a little more flavour.

Really tasted very good! Honestly, I was not confident that this recipe will turn out good, but this was PERFECT!!! I'm so glad that I've finally found sweet and sour pork recipe that my family and I would really like. Thank you for sharing your secret ingredient (ACV)! :)

I made this for my son and we love it!  First time I made it I didn't have pineapple and juice.  The second time I made it with the pineapple/juice.  We both agree we like it better without the pineapple.   Totally awesome over white rice.

We just use the ingredients that available at home, my 4.5 years old cook this sweet and sour pork. It came out excellent, we all love it. I used regular white vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. I didn't have pineapple, scallions, red bell paper, celery, and soy sauce. I just used 0.5 tsp oyster sauce. I recorded in my ios when abby cooked this sweet and sour pork.

My changes--didn't coat the pork, but may try that in the future. Had no green onions or soy sauce. Sauce was a big hit with the family. Basically doubled..2c water, 1 cup hm catsup, mix of sweeteners, 2/3c acv, large can pineapple with juice, cornstarch to thicken.

This was really good, both in flavour of the sauce, and texture of the meat - crunchy on the outside, and tender within. I deliberately avoided overcooking the veg, as I didn't want it ruined.

Very delicious.  A hit with the entire family.  I used boneless pork ribs cut into cubes (because that is what I had on hand).  Turned out wonderful.

Excellent recipe. I have even used leftover grilled pork chops cut into pieces instead of frying the pork. It is healthier and still fantastic. I do use 3 different coloured bell peppers and double the sauce (only 1 can of pineapple).

Excellent! I omitted the green onions and fried mine in peanut oil. I used the leftover oil to fry my premade potstickers I pulled out of the freezer. Served it over instant brown rice. 5 stars if the sauce would have come out thicker, but I think I can tweek it for next time.

I made it my own,adding 1/2 c. flour,1/2 t.ginger to the cornstarch for the meat coating. Never saw a Sweet and Sour Pork recipe without ginger. It turned out lovely. Thanks. In the 80s and 90s,it took 2 cookbooks to tweak the perfect recipe for this,but this one was better.Loved the veggies being cooked down,as well.Yummy. Saved on a piece of paper,like some Grannies still do!

Holy moly, this was good! As someone else mentioned, it is a time commitment, so plan for that. Gotta do a lot of prep work ahead of each step for it to turn out well. Next time I'll reduce the amount of sugar a bit, and it should still be very good. Highly recommend.

Basically I used yellow onion, bell pepper, fresh pineapple and pork. I didn't bread the pork just cooked it with some water until tender about 45 min. I didn't even add salt. Then just added the sauce. Yummy over rice.

I just cooked this Sweet n Sour Pork recipe.It turned out very good.I marinated the pieces of
pork one half in salt the other half in Soy Sauce.I used two packages of pork and mixed it up.
That way the meat didn't come out to salty.I eliminated the Ketchup as the sound of it makes
my stomach turn.Instead I used red food coloring.I used 21/4 cups of apple Cidar Vinagar.
Vinegar has a pretty strong kick to it.Next time I will only use 1/4 cup.I followed everything
else.This recipe is a keeper.I cant wait to make it again.I served it with fried Rice.My brother
went back for seconds.

It was good but not great. I did mix all my sauce ingredients ahead of time and had it already prepared. I also did not cook the pork or vegetables in the sauce but mixed it in. I think there is a little too much vinegar in the recipe. Next time I think I will add maybe half the amount called for, you can always add more in if needed but can't take it out. While I didn't add it, I think a little grated ginger would have been nice.

I made this last night. I even went out and bought a deep fryer since I did not have one. This was excellent!! The pork butt roast came out very tender.  I did change a few things due to the ingredients I had. I used red and orange bell peppers instead of the green. I did not have cornstarch so I substituted flour instead and that worked just fine. I also added some water chestnuts to the mixture. My husband always orders sweet and sour pork from Chinese take out and he said this was a lot better. a definite keeper!! thanks for sharing

This is a really good recipe but I would seriously cut the white sugar. I only used 1/2 cup instead of the 3/4 cup the recipe called for and it was still too sweet for me. I would try 1/4 next time. I also used more than one lb of pork roast and just fried it in batches in my Fry Daddy for about 7 min.

This recipe makes a good dish, and we all enjoyed it.  We followed the recipe exactly.  However, a few things to prepare yourself.  There are a lot of ingredients, as you see, to prepare, and the preparation is time consuming.  There really is more sugar in it than I would like to eat, and my husband and I both commented on how much sugar is in the recipe.  I prefer more tangy sauce, and although this was good, it was quite sweet.  We probably will make it again because it is good, but I would add 2 more green onions because, for me, the flavor consisted of sweet more than anything else.  I would also cut the peppers into slightly smaller pieces.  The recipe is one of the better Chinese recipes I have eaten.

Fantastic recipe! I made this recently on a cold, dreary day, when I just didn't want to go to the store, and i was able use literally all things I already had on hand, or easily substituted. For instance, I didn't have pork butt, I had pork chops. I also used red wine vinegar and didn't use green onions, but it still came out great. So very grateful to find this recipe and cannot wait to make this again with all the suggested ingredients!

Update 12/19/2018: I just happened to make this again today when I realized I've been enjoying this recipe for three years, and I break this recipe out when I want to impress friends and family, or if I'm on a tight budget. Today, buying all of my produce/meat for this recipe only cost me $8, and made about 6 servings. Here's a photo of today's batch.

I made this last night for my first attempt at making Chinese food, and let me just say WOW! Better than take out. I followed this recipe step by step and it was amazing. I did take one bit of advise from a review which said to add 1/4 cup of ketchup to the sauce and add some brown sugar not all white sugar. My husband said that he loved it and asked when I will make it again.

Better than take out - except for cleaning up the mess. I had a craving for sweet and sour pork, but we only have one close Asian restaurant here and it's borderline hit and miss.  I had picked up some sweet and sour sauce at the grocery store and then I found this recipe.  The first time I used my store bought sauce with some added extras because it tasted like ketchup, it was okay but the pork turned really good.  

Finally the 2nd try I picked up some cider vinegar and made the entire recipe and all I can say is wow.  Of course I keep the sauce separate from the pork prior to plating, because I don't like the pork to get soggy - especially the leftovers I use for lunch the next day. I used a fresh pineapple which added to the preparation time.  Now I have a sauce to do fried prawns with as well.  Yum.

I almost never rate recipes, but I just had to rate this one, it was soo good! I left a bunch out that either I didn't have or hubby didn't like, basically all the veggies and the pineapple chunks. I worried that missing out on the pineapple would really lose something from the recipe, but it was still great! Thanks so much!!

The breading didn't work to make it crunchy the way my husband likes it, but I thought otherwise this recipe was really good. I used frozen green beans in place of the celery and that worked too.

I didn't change a thing. It is fantastic! It is just right for four people. It seems a little overwhelming at first but when all comes together it is well worth the work. Will be saving this one, no need to look any further. I did chop vegetables smaller than suggested.

This recipe is awesome! It is better than my local takeout. I did make some adjustments for personal preference. 
I added a teaspoon of sesame oil to the sauce mixture. 
I fried the pork cubes in batches in my wok in about an inch of oil. They came out perfectly.

I peeled a few carrots, and cut them on the bias, and stir fried them with the other veggies. 

I did not cook the sauce and a separate pan. After I cooked the veg, I poured the sauce mixture into the wok, brought it to a boil for a couple of minutes, then stirred in the pork. Then I added the cornstarch slurry to thicken it up. I definitely will be making this again!

Loved it!! Better than restaurant!! I was skeptical at first because it seemed kind of complicated and I don't have a deep fryer and haven't had the greatest success with frying in a pan, but did it anyway, and it was amazing!!!! Easier than I thought and can't wait to make it again!

The sauce really is the star of this show. It can be adapted into so many different directions. The pork is good too, but I don't follow the exact steps. I like to make it easier on myself. All in all a great recipe.

This was my first try at sweet and sour anything. I had grilled two Asian marinated pork tenderloins the night before so I chopped one up into bite-sized pieces instead of deep frying the pork. I also used fresh pineapple so for the juice I put a few pieces in the Nutri-bullet with a bit of water and pulverized them. Everything else was just as written. It was delicious. Served it over rice. I am so glad to make it fresh and not rely on bottled sauces.

Great recipe I didn't change anything and it tastes just like takeout if not better. I've never fried anything before not in a deep fryer so I suggest testing one or two small pieces before you dump a handful in lol.

made this for Sunday dinner. I don't like chinese food, but everyone else does, so I thought I'd try it.  Used pork chops instead of pork butt. Turned out great!  Now, just need to find a recipe for Sesame Chicken that's as good as this one

Loved this recipe! At first I thought it would be tedious with all of the steps but had leftover pork and gave it a try .  Only changes in ingredients I made were using a. 20 oz can of pineapple  and substituted stevia for 3/4 c sugar.  End results were delish!  Thank you!

Great recipe. After I began, I realized I didn't have any soy sauce so I substituted with Yoshida's Teriyaki sauce. It turned out fantastic. I think next time I will be adding water chestnuts and large chunks of garlic to the veggie mix. My family loved this recipe.

Pretty good.  Found something subtly lacking in the sauce.  Added 1 large clove minced garlic, and a small dash of 5 spice, which helped, but still needs something else to make it wow.  We still enjoyed it though, and will make again while fooling with the sauce some until we get it perfect.

Fabulous! I had an old "sweet and sour sauce" recipe, but this one is better. I love the ease of this recipe. As with all Asian food, it's mostly prep that takes up your time. The pork fried up beautifully. I buy organic meat, so I used cut-up pork chops. I also added some sweet pickles that I had made to the sauce. Just divine!

I just made this recipe for the first time and even though there were many steps, it turned out fabulous and wasn't really that much work after all. Will totally be making this one again!!

Great recipe! I did it this afternoon for a dinner with friends! The result was awesome! I don't like the idea of using ketchup in the recipe since there are so many different kinds of ketchup, some more sweet, some more sour but then you can correct this by adding a little more of sugar or vinager.

This was hands down the best Chinese entree I've ever made. I didn't have green onions, and I didn't use the entire amount of sugar listed, but this was fantastic! The sweet and sour sauce is not too sweet, and not too sour. I find most restaurant's sauce is cloying and diabetic-coma inducing. This was amazing. Definite keeper, and will make again. Hubby cleaned his plate.

I made it for my spouse who wanted Chinese amd where we currently live we wouldn't dare to try. He was very skeptical about making this at home but was pleasantly surprised and excited when he tried it! It was exactly what he wanted! Thank you so much! Note: I didn't have cornstarch so just used all purpose flour instead. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so used 3 tbsp of apple purÃ©e and squeezed about half a lemon worth of lemon juice. Thanks again!

Not bad. While I liked this, I by far prefer Sal's sweet & sour chicken. Admittedly, Sal's version is quite different from Pam's (the obvious difference being the choice of protein), but the end result is essentially the same. The main difference between the two is that Sal's sweet & sour is NOT breaded. I'm a sucker for the battered, deep-fried sweet & sour, but Sal opened my eyes to the possibility of liking a more non-traditional sweet & sour. Having said this, I am a traditionalist at heart and prefer the battered, deep-fried sweet & sour that I've grown accustomed to. I really thought I'd like this for that very reason, but the fried pork was what ended up being a turnoff. My pork had an odd texture that was not at all like the thickly battered sweet & sour I can get at my local Chinese take-out. All in all, I'm glad to have given your recipe a try but am sad to report that it will not make a repeat at my house. If for nothing else, the sauce was quite good and probably the best part of this dish. Thanks anyways, Pam. :)

This recipe is very delicious. I made it as stated. Next time I think I will take one reviewers suggestion to cook pork in a wok instead of deep frying to see if it is easier and less time consuming. Still, it is worth the effort to make this wonderful dish!

This is a wonderful recipe and we loved it. However a made a batter to dip my pork in and deep fried the meat twice. Makes a crunchy coating. Other than that I followed to a tee. I'm making for my inlaws tonight. They have requested this many times. Thank you so much

This recipe more than passed muster with my 90-year-old mom who learned her Chinese cooking in a Cantonese restaurant 70 years ago.  Thank you for this wonderful new addition to my repertoire!  Only changes I made: added carrots and mushrooms, and a little extra soy sauce and vinegar to taste.  The meat was fantastic and I'll be making this again.

Made this tonight and it was really good. I wish it had more of the red color you get when you order take-out. Maybe add more ketchup?  I also didn't have alot of oil for frying so I basically pan fried it in 2 batches and it turned out great! Next time I will try this with chicken.

This was excellent! Better than any take out, ever. A big hit with my family, YUM! Who knew you could use corn starch to deep fry anything? It stayed crisp in the sauce, a delight!

The family loved it! We don't eat pork, so I substituted chopped pieces of left over fried chicken that we'd made the night before. Other than that substitution, I followed the remaining directions with out changes. I paired this with a mix of stir fried veggies and steamed rice. There were no left overs tonight! Even better? Because my chicken was precooked, I had dinner ready in 30 mins. :)
What a blessing to have some variety in the typical old standby of chicken and rice. Thanks!

Restaurant quality! This recipe was so good, it smells and tastes like you ordered take out. I bought a bag of frozen stir fry veggies and let them thaw out before mixing. I didn't have apple cider vinegar so I mixed some red wine vinegar with a little water to dilute it. I added it slowly and stopped after I had the desired taste (it didn't take much). Served it over fried rice and it was to die for! Next time I will try it with chicken.

Wow this was delicious!  The reason I only gave it four stars was that the recipe calls for way too much sugar.  Next time I will only use half.

Awesome recipe. Not like that stuff you get on the Chinese buffet they like to call sweet and sour pork. This was GREAT! We used a left over pork roast Shoulder butt. I made it exactly according to the recipe. Made some pork fried rice and fried cabbage to go with it. THe family LOVED it all. If I make it again the only change I would make is more onion less celery but that's just personal taste.

My room mates and I really enjoyed this dish paired with some steamed white rice! The sauce was a perfect mix of sweet and sour for us. I substituted a bag of Kroger 3 pepper and onion frozen vegetables mix for the ones called for in the recipe.

Great recipe! I was missing good asian food (I had it a lot when I lived in Holland, so not REAL asian, but still) and I could not find it where I live now.. till I found this recipe :) I used a different kind of vinegar, (less than in the recipe) and we found the taste just slightly too 'vinagry' but I guess that came from my choice. I found that frying the pork for 10 min. will make it slightly dry, will probably fry it less long next time cause I will make it again :)

Sooooo delish!!! Ok, I don't normally change recipes then rate them, but I was stuck and didn't have all the ingredients on hand, and so I had to improvise. After eating this meal as I made it, i had to write a review if nothing but to say that it is very versatile, and if you are in a bind, you are able to make little changes and still have it come out awesome! Here are the changes I made:  I ran out of white sugar in the midst lol...so I used brown sugar. I only had yellow and red peppers, so that's what I used, and I was positive I bought pineapples, but sure enough, when I went to grab them, I realized It was canned manderins, so I just used the juice. I doubled the sauce and served on a bed of rice,  and it was oh sooo good!! Also, I found the prep really easy; I cut up the pork and added egg and green onion mixture, then while it was in the fridge for an hour, I prepared all the veg then set aside, then prepared the sauce and set aside, and cooked rice and set aside.  All I had to do then was to coat pork and fry, heat sauce then add everything and thicken. Easy peasy and a must try! Great for company too! Enjoy!

This was an awesome dish.  I used a bag of frozen snow peas, carrots and water chestnuts instead of the fresh vegetables.  The sauce was fabulous!  My husband and I loved it.  I am going to invite company over and make this dish.  Thank You!

Wow...this recipe was great....fantastic flavor... I have tried several recipes for sweet and sour pork from the internet and this was far the best one. The only change I made was that I added sliced carrots to it and seeings how I like alot of sauce I made extra of that too.

I loved the fresh tangy taste of all the ingredients vs. the "canned red glop" that passes for sweet and sour pork in some restaurants. Even though I I substituted frozen pineapple bits and brown sugar (I ran out of white sugar) the recipe came out perfect. Will make this again, as it is hubby's favorite!

Excellent!  Pork had great flavor from the marinade.  I added carrot to the veggies as a preference.  Didn't use as much water as called for.  I mixed the sauce in advance (when I prepped the pork) and then dumped it in a pot to thicken when it was time to cook it.  Poured the sauce over the pork and veggies just prior to serving.  Next time I will thicken the sauce more as it was thinner than I would have liked.

Great recipe. After frying the pork, I put it in the slowcooker on low for 2 hours. Then added my sauted veggies, thickened the sauce. Served over noodles.

i made this without onions (cause we have onion haters in the family...lol but i like them).  plus i used celery and carrots...i did not have any bell pepper...also used crushed pineapple, cause it was the only thing i had on hand.  It was odd putting ketchup in the mix, but when i seen the coloring, it made sense.  However! the was AWESOME!!!  The recipe overall should hold 5 stars!!  thank you for sharing this.......I use regular vinegar....cause it was what I had at hand.  But I will try it with the apple cider later.  I shared this recipe on facebook with friends and family......Once again thank you for sharing......kudos

i dont need to go out for chinese or panda express any longer. i think the whole thing cost about 8 bucks but it was enough to feed 10-12 people!  Great taste and super easy. I thought i had a can of pineapple but i guess the little ones ate that so i substituted mandrin oranges. (i actually didnt put in the oranges but just used the juice my 3 little boys ate all of the orages before it was ready. :)

This was the most amazing chinese meal I have ever made.  I used a 2-3 lb. pork butt roast so I doubled the recipe ingredients.  IT WAS AWESOME!  Very authentic!  Better then any restaurant I have ever eaten at.  We can't wait to eat the leftovers!

We loved it! I did cut down on the sugar a wee bit and as I have cooked sweet and sour pork in the past I knew it was better to add the vegetables and the meat in the end so they would stay crunchier. (I prefer my vegetables crisp tender) Very good and I found it well worth the work. Thanks for the wonderful recipe! My two, seven and thirteen year old ate it up!

I only went so far with this recipe as marinating and frying the pork, but it was wonderful! Way better than a restaurant.  The pork was flavorful and crispy without all the unnecessary breading that you get at so many Chinese places. Yum!

This was my first time cooking sweet and sour pork and it will not be my last! So very close to what the restaurants serve! If you like a little crunch to your pork like I do, do not add to the sauce until the very end or it will become soggy. Fantastic recipe! Thanks!

I made this with chicken instead of pork and really enjoyed it. The only thing was that my sauce took longer than expected to thicken, so my veggies got very soft. In the future, I would add the meat to the saice and thicken, then add the veggies so that they don't go limp. Thanks for a great recipe!

Followed the recipe for the sauce and pork. I didn't use celery (don't like it much) but used red bell peppers instead. The sauce was too sweet so I had to adjust the taste by adding 1-2 Tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar. It came out great!! My hubby loved it and will definitely be making it again

This recipe came out great!  My 2 year old didn't like it but he's only 2!  My 4 year old gobbled it up & my husband said he liked it too.  The only change I'll make in the future is that I'll keep the sauce separate from the dish as a dipping sauce rather than adding it to the whole dish because it was a little too sweet for our taste.  But definitely a keeper!  I added some Japanese noodles to the mixture which completed it pretty well!  Thank you for the recipe!

Very nice, does taste exactly like you get in a chinese restaurant.  I would rather have had less sauce and more vegetables, though.

I have to give this one 5 stars. It was great. Have had it several times now and always good. The family loves it to. I did not change anything. Taste like what I used to get down south at the Resturant. It is some work but worth it all the way

I have always been leery of oriental cooking, but I wanted sweet and sour pork and happened to have all the ingredients without going shopping.  This recipe was really easy to follow and sooooooo good that my husband wanted it again the next day.  I love your website and use it frequently.  I tell lots of friends about it too.  Thanks for the good recipes.

Based on the outstanding reviews, I picked this recipe for my first foray into Asian cooking. I generally like Asian food (but don't know the names of the dishes that I like).  This was disappointing.  I followed the advice of some reviewers and cut back on the sugar; the sweet and sour sauce was OK but not great.  I did not like the pork.  Coating it with corn starch gave it an unpleasant flavour which ruined the dish for me. (SUBSEQUENTLY: i believe it was the oil that caused the unpleasant flavour)

Wouldn't change a thing!  A fantastic meal the whole family can enjoy!  I think it would be excellent using chicken too.  Can't wait to have it again.

Excellent just as it is!  Instead of mixing all the ingredients at the end we just dish up some rice, topped with the meat and then the veggies and pour the sauce over it all.  Keeps everything crunchy.

I had high hopes when I read this recipe, and let me tell you...it did not disappoint! I followed the directions and did not make any changes (apart from also adding a red sweet pepper) and it turned out fantastic. Better than a restaurants! The sauce thickens perfectly. We served it over Jasmine rice, so good. Will definitely make this again.

This was very good, but perhaps more difficult than other sweet and sour recipes.  The taste is amazing, and needed no changes.  This recipe demands attention when you make it, so try not to multi task.

OH. MY. GOD. OMIGOD. YES. YES! YESYESYESYESYES!!!!!.....Ahhhhhhh......    Take the other reviewers advice and do not combine the ingredients until ready to serve.  Have 4 pots and pans on all 4 burners at the same time.  It's not even bad, because you can prep it all first and then just stare at it and wait for it to cook.  Then throw the sauce (1), veggies (2), and pork (3; drained of course), on top of the rice (4), and you will have the best S-N-S pork you have ever eaten. MWAH!

This was an excellent recipe! The flavor was perfect. The only problem I had was that I didn't fry the pork in grease that was hot enough, so it was not crispy. I made this for my husband for his birthday supper and he raved about it all night!! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Delicous. I was a little hesitant when i pulled it out of the deep fryer, it didn't look to apetizing, and then adding the vinegar to the sauce also, because i hate vinegar, but it was actually better than the chinese food i get when i go out! Definately a keeper!

Way too sweet. Ketchup is sweet and pineapples are very sweet, there's no real need for 3/4 cup additional sugar. If I make it again I'll cut the sugar in half.

This was so easy and a great meal! I cheated and used left over cooked pork loin that I chopped and added to the sauce, but it turned out great. My 4 year old had 3rds! Thank you!

I am a big fan of traditional style chinese food and this was spot on. I made a few changes, i added red and green peppers and more pineapple. also right before serving i mixed in fresh green onions. The pork was nice and crunchy and the sauce was out of this world. The only con about it was it couldve been more sour and less sweet.

Adding a couple of carrots enhances both texture and color.  As carrots do take longer to cook, I cut the carrot into quarters (lengthwise), then chopped into 3/4" slices. Note:  Only other exception made to the recipe is I used a previously cooked pork roast, diced and prepared as directed & then deep fryed a couple of minutes.  In future I may use same recipe for either chicken and left-over ham.  Excellent sauce recipe!

Great recipe!  Keep in mind, this is quite a bit of prep, but it's worth the effort when you have the time and want to impress.  I can't wait to make it again.  For a variation, I intend to make a spicier version by adding some chili peppers and omitting the celery.

This recipe is super delish! I love sweet & sour chicken, and this is great. The sauce is just like my favorite restaurant sauce. I didn't fry the pork because I was short on time, and it was delicious anyway. YUMMY!

I've never written a review before but HAD to respond to this one.  Followed the recipe and tasted the sauce before adding the pineapple - Yuck!  I almost threw it out - but keep reading.  .  .  Since my family didn't think it was so bad, I continued - and I'm so glad!  It was great and as good or better than any  I've tasted from really good restaurants.
I'm very particular about food and a dish  really has to make my tastebuds sing before I consider it a keeper.  This is a keeper for sure!  It was worth all the prep - which is half of the fun of cooking for me.  (now that I'm retired and don't have to rush to get dinner on!)

This was my first attempt at home made sweet and sour sauce from scratch and it turned out great. The pork pieces taste great even on their own. I did a few minor changes like flour instead of corn starch and I had no celery. Next time I will try brown sugar instead of white to see how it works.
I served it with rice and it was awesome.

I make this with chicken and I don't combine everything. I put the chicken over rice and spoon the sauce on top because I like the crunch on the chicken. Very good. The sauce also freezes very well so make a double batch and set some aside for next time.

Excellent S&S Pork.  The only changes I made were to add some steamed broccoli to the sauce to up the veggie content, and I used red peppers & red onions instead of green peppers & normal onions.

I did, as someone else suggested, keep the pork out of the sauce and just add the sauce on top because I like the crispy pork.  However, I had leftovers today with the pork in the sauce & it was equally as tasty!

Thanks great recipe. It was wonderful.  We did not make any changes other than we deep fried it twice for extra crispiness.

I love this sauce. I didn't use the pork, I had left over BBQ pork boneless and sliced them up, I put oil in the pan and sauted the veg,when cooked, I added the BBQ sliced pork and the sauce. It was awesome. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

After reading the reviews, I used a bit less sugar in the sauce, doubled everything but the pork, and added water chestnuts to the stir-fried veggies.  This recipe is a bit labor intensive, but so worth it.  I made a HUGE error.  The very last step -- cornstarch and water -- should be mixed together, and probably strained, before putting into the sauce.  Otherwise, the cornstarch doesn't dissolve.  Even with that, everything was absolutely delicious and very authentic.  I'll make it again, for sure, and maybe try fresh pineapple.

So Good!!  Better than ordering takeout!  The only change I made was using a cup of fresh cut pineapple instead of canned!  The sauce is REALLY sweet, so next time I may cut back on the amount of sugar in the sauce....but it was SO GOOD!!!!

Enjoyed this dish although it didn't blow me away.  I made it with boneless, skinless chicken thighs instead of pork and I stir-fried the meat in my wok with some sesame oil instead of deep frying it.  Then I made the sauce (with only 1/2 cup sugar) and kept the meat and veggies separate until serving as some suggested.  I liked this recipe better than what I've gotten at Chinese takeout, but it didn't quite blow me away.  Still, it's a keeper.

I'm not sure how I went wrong with so many good reveiws, but this recipe to me was edible and that's about all! I found it very very sour and so did my husband. We were so looking forward to sweet and sour, but only found sour. Will not make again.

This was a great recipe, I've subsituted the pork with chicken and it works well.  However, I think it's best with the pork.  It also freezes well, I usually double the recipe for the sauce and freeze half.  Definately just pour sauce over the pork and veggies just before serving...it adds a nice crunch!  Happy Cooking! =D

Who knew making sweet and sour sauce from scratch could be so easy.  The apple cider vinegar is definitely the key to perfection.  We will make this again for sure!

This recipe is easy and tastes as good as any sweet & sour pork dish I've ordered from any Chinese restaurant. You could easily substitute the pork with chicken as well. Per my husband, this recipe goes on our "keeper" list to make again and again.

I made this last night and it was pretty good.  This is my husband's favorite chinese dish so I was excited to make it for him.  We both agreed that something was lacking in it but couldn't pin-point it (he was thinking possiable the cornstarch for breading on the pork or maybe just the oil used).  I will defiantly keep this recipe on file and make it again.

I made a few changes to this, including using sesame oil when sauteeing the veggies, adding mushrooms, and using crushed instead of chunked pineapple.  I also used 1/3 cup soy sauce for the marinade because it didn't seem like enough.  I only had time to marinade for 45 minutes, but it didn't matter.  The pork came out great!  Overall this was really good, though a little sweet.  Next time I will definitely decrease the amount of sugar in the sauce by about half and use more veggies.  I also thought there was a little too much sauce (and we love lots of sauce), so I will decrease that as well.  Finally, I think that next time I will wait to add the veggies to the sauce until right before serving because they became very soggy (but still tasted good).  I will definitely be making this again with the changes.

Wow, my Chinese supper came out so good thanks to this recipe. I did already make the "Sweet and Sour sauce I" on this site  wanted to somehow add the already cooked pork shoulder to it. I cut it up into 1" pieces following this recipe and  fried it just until crispy using then put the pieces into the sweet and sour. It was so fantastic I made it again the following day and my husband just loved it!

This is a great recipe, and easier than it seems at first glance. I used vegetables on hand -- cabbage, carrots, and onion, and doubled the pineapple. I used brown sugar, and might cut back on that next time. The pork was really tasty.

This is the best sweet and sour pork I've had! When you have it at restaurants, it's usually way overbreaded and not much pork but this is delicious! I followed the recipe but I didn't add the vegetables until I served it so they were still crunchy.  I absolutely loved this - will definitely make again!

Found this very tasty. Please note the time specified does not truly reflect how long it takes to prepare the recipe.  They don't add the time requested to marinate the pork.  I quickly had read through the recipe, seeing that it took approximately an hour to make, thought I could fit it into my schedule but then saw that it said to soak the pork for an hour.  Because I didn't do this, I'm sure the pork would have been MUCH more tasty (even though it was good!).  It would be nice if the administration could adjust the time listed on the recipe to more accurately reflect how long it takes to prepare this dish.  Overall, all the family said they would love to eat it again!

Delicious! I've made this twice, first with pork then with chicken breast. Both times this was a hit with my family. It does make a lot of (yummy) sauce - my second time around I didn't add the 1/4 cup of water at the end and it turned out fine.

We thought this recipe was wonderful.  The only changes I made was to add the sliced carrots and omit sprinkling sugar on the vegetables.  The sauce was sweet enough.  There was not too much sauce.  I will definitely make this again.

When I read the ingredients and reviews for this recipe, I figured this will be a winner. However I was mistaken. Not only does this take a long time, the end result was not satisfactory. I don't recommend this to anyone.

I made this and while the flavor was good, it wasn't dead on and oh my god did it make a lot of sauce.  And in my opinion, the sauce wasn't near thick enough.  Still good, but not really good.

Excellent.  I added more veggies than it called for as well as carrots.  I had to use more cornstarch than it called for and lost a lot of coating when frying.  I think I added the pork before the oil was hot enough.  The sauce was wonderful.  Next time, I plan to saute the chicken instead just to save time and make it a little healthier.

This is a delicious dish, but WOW, that vinegar packs a punch!  I would not use cider vinegar again, I think the flavor is too dominant.  Next time I make this, I'll use 1/4 cup of white vinegar.  I combined the meat and veggies and served the sauce separately.  Very good!

This recipe is GREAT.  Very yummy and flavorful--the pork is delicious.  We added pineapple cubes, which I think was an added bonus.

Worth the effort. Wasn't difficult to prepare, but required 3 pan's just to cook the dish. Not a big deal really for most, but with no dishwasher, they stack up quick. I was afraid my husband wouldn't like this; it had a very pungent vinegar smell while cooking but It turned out great!

Yummy!!  I loved how the ingredient list was so well-organized.  I like it topped with cashews.  For those who like a little heat, add some cayenne.

This recipe was great.  I also used chili garlic sauce instead of ketchup and a pork loin instead of a pork butt.  Next time I might make a little more rice because mine seemed extra "saucy."  Thanks for the recipe!

I have been making this dish for about 5 years and everyone in my family loves it. I marinate the pork just with soy sauce or bottled "asian marinade" and it still turns out great. Sometimes I will add water chestnuts after the vegetables have cooked for a little extra crunch. 

I find that it is better to add the sauce to the meat and vegetables (not the other way around), so that I can control the amount of sauce.

This is absolutely the best sweet and sour pork recipe, prep everything before hand for easy cooking, the only extras I added were some mushroom slices, and extra green onion slices to scatter on the finished product, also made Jasmine Rice and a Salad, this is to die for! and a keeper recipe!

My family loved this dish! The only change I made is substituting carrots for celery. We are not big celery fans. The carrots made it a little more colorful too. This will become a regular for us.

My husband and I loved it.  I am not a big pork fan, but I liked it this way.  Will definitely make again.  The only thing I changed, by mistake, is that I did not add the juice from the pineapple because I accidentally drained them.  The sauce was still sweet enough.

I only used this recipe for the sauce.  I put it on some little smokies sausages and it was great!  I have never attemped to make a sweet and sour sauce, but this was so easy and I had everything on hand that I needed.  It turned out just like I wanted and the hubby LOVED it.  The only thing that I did different was add more cornstarch as suggested.  Thank you!

Very good flavor. I would omit about 1/2 of the water when you make the sauce. It was just too runny. I used 4 pork loin chops and it was great. I really like the consistency of the meat after frying.
