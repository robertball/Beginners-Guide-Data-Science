This is a really nice autumn soup.   For me it came out a bit thicker than expected and needed salt.  The only change I made is that I used whole allspice while cooking and fished them out before I pureed.  I still got the nice flavor without the soup being brown.   Cooked the vegetables in the Instant Pot.  Worked very well.

I revisited this soup for lunch the next day and it was killer!  Definitely one that should be made one day and eaten the next.  I think next time I make this, I may blend half and leave the other half unblended and add some ham.

This was pretty good but I think the Parsnip was a little strong. Next time I will probably use only 4. Good taste overall.

I had never used a butternut squash before, so this soup was a new adventure for me. I roasted all the parsnips and half the squash (that's how much fit on my pan) and cooked the rest of the squash in the chicken broth. Instead of leek I used green onion. I did not have any cream or half and half, so I simply used a smaller amount of milk, and then used some sour cream in each serving of the soup. It was a surprise to all of us how sweet this soup is!

5 stars for the butternut and parsnip combination.  I changed it a lot, but these two veggies are wonderful together.  Thank you for the idea.  I did not puree the soup, and enjoyed the flavors of the individual components.  Added a turnip, didn't have a leek, reduced the allspice, upped the garlic.  Garnished with bacon.  Yummy.

This was great. I made by the receipt. Yes the allspice turned it alittle brownish but it still looked good. I am freezing enough to have with my Christmas dinner. Will be a favorite to make.

I made the recipe as directed.   The two teaspoons of allspice turned the soup a very dark dingy brown.   Not something you would want to serve to company.   The taste was okay but I don't think I'll make it again.
