I changed the cooking process around a bit. I was really hesitant to just wisk flour into a pot of ingredients as I really didn't want the flavor of flour to ruin my soup. I used four tablespoons of butter that I melted over medium high heat in my soup pot, then added the flour (reduced to four tablespoons) to make a roux. I cooked the roux to a golden brown before wisking in the chicken broth and half-n-half. Because I cut the flour back by half, I did NOT add the water. After the mixture had come to a boil, I wisked in the cheese a little at a time to prevent the cheese lumping up in the soup, then added in the onion flakes and chopped broccoli. The end result was nice though I do think it could use more cheese. Even with the change in cooking process, this soup didn't take any longer than 15 minutes to prepare.

I've made this several times.  Double the cheese.  Use fresh finely diced onion instead of dry flakes.

With a few adjustments, I thought this soup was great.  I used a lot more cheese, and I also used a little American along with the cheddar.  I thought this improved both the texture and the flavor.  I will make this one often.

Great recipe! I made a few changes - I took a tip from the other comments and added more cheese and instead of onion flakes I sauted a chopped medium onion with a half a clove of garlic and a little water before adding the chicken broth (which I allowed to simmer with just the onions garlic and a little pepper for a little while to soften the onions)  - I Love that this recipe called for REAL cheddar not "processed cheese product", and fresh broccoli! I used a mild cheddar but I probably should have mixed it with a sharper cheddar, even so the flavor was amazing!

Excellent. The cheese was all stringy and separate in the bottom of the pot at first, but gradually as the soup cooked it became fully incorporated. I used chicken broth that had salt in it and didn't need to add any additional salt like other reviewers have suggested.

This was a wonderful and easy soup. My family loved it. It was a little to watery and extra cheddar did not solve this. So I added instant potato flakes until it thickened up and added more seasonings, then served it in bread bowls. This is a keeper.

This really was a great recipe but I had to jazz it up a little bit.  I chopped up one slice of bacon and cooked it in the pot before I did anything else.  Remove the cooked bacon bits and then sautee 1/4 c. chopped onions in the grease until tranlucent. As far as the cheese, I used 8 oz. of SHARP cheddar.  At the end I added 1/2 c. of sour cream and the bacon bits; stir. YUMMY!!!

Delicious and not too heavy either.  I really liked it because it is one of the few recipes that I found that didnt call for processed cheese like Velvetta.

This is just what I was looking for. I didn't want to use processed cheese. They key to the taste is buying good sharp cheddar, not store brand. I used 4 cups Hoffman's Super Sharp Cheddar. I also added a dash of Garlic Powder.

I followed other reviewers' advice and doubled the cheese (one 8 oz brick of cabot sharp white cheddar, which I shredded into the pot) and added 5 slices of organic american cheese to help with texture.  I used @5 cups of homemade organic turkey and chicken stock in place of the broth and water, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  The texture was perfect and flavor was quite good.  My 3 year old, who generally turns up his nose at any soups or veggies ate quite a bit and told me how great it was.  My 5 year old said it was as good as Panera and my husband loved it.  Thanks for the recipe. It is nice to find a good recipe using just regular ingredients and no nasty chemical-laden canned condensed soups or processed "cheese food!"

This recipe is a good starting point but I wouldn't have liked it if I'd stopped where the recipe instructions did! It needs pureed to meet my expectations of broccoli cheese soup. To include that step, I added the broccoli to the broth/flour mixture but waited to add the cream and the cheese. Once the broccoli was tender, I scooped it into my blender with a slotted spoon and added some of the liquid and zipped it up until smooth and returned it to my pan. Then I added the cream and cheese. I agree with those who say it needs more cheese, I added probably double the amount (until I could taste it in the soup). Depending on your broth, you will definitely need to add salt as well.

Very good recipe.  I did add more cheese than what the recipe called for but that was it.  It's quick, easy and great on a chilly night.

I made this recipe twice now. I am giving the original recipe 4 stars because it was good but not great. The second time I made it I took the advice of others and used fresh onion and sauteed that with some garlic and doubled the cheese. This time, it was great!

AMAZING soup, and definitely a very easy recipe. I only changed one thing; I followed a previous commenter's suggestion (littleaudrey), and used fresh onion instead of minced, and while I was cooking the onion I added some garlic. I did not have any half and half on hand (discovered this after I had started...ooops), so I used 1 1/2 cups of 2 % milk, with 2 TBSPN's each of corn starch and flour whisked into it.  It still came out with a nice, smooth, creamy consistency.  (I did reduce the 1/2 cup of flour suggested, to 1/4 cup, because I was afraid it would be too much with the milk mixture). This soup was delicious, and I will definitely be making it over and over again.   I suggest having french bread slices with some butter as a side....SO good dipped into the soup.

I rated this recipe 5 stars because I think the writer did a fantastic job of explaining how to make a broccoli cheese soup using fresh and natural ingredients.

I have to admit, I made this recipe adding my own twist to it.  I will include my changes and additions below.

First, I sauteed half a finely chopped one, one large stick of finely chopped celery, and 1/4 of a red bell pepper, diced.  I sauteed them using a small amount of olive oil, and threw in about tablespoon of minced garlic just as they began to sweat.

I also used 1 cup of heavy whip because I had that on hand, and it needed to be used.  I omitted the water, and instead used 1 cup of 2% milk.  I did use a quart of chicken stock and the flour.  I also used fresh broccoli, uncooked broccoli as opposed to frozen or previously cooked.  I also through in 1 tsp. of dried minced onion, 1 tsp. dried parsley, and doubled the cheese.  

I know the red bell pepper, celery, and parsley might sound a little wild, but if you are looking to jazz this recipe up, that really did the trick!

Thank you to the writer for a great basic recipe on cooking with cheddar!

We loved the taste and it's so easy. It was a little watery- I might add less water next time. I doubled the cheese, added a little more onion. Also, I added a couple of drops of Tabasco.

The soup was great. I did double the cheese and use a potato masher just a bit in the end to break the broccoli up a bit.  Heated well and tasted great the next day to boot.

Doubled the cheese, and will add more next time. Came out thin, so I added potato flakes to thicken. I think next time I'll delete the water. With even mor cheese, maybe I won't need the potato flakes next time. Also added shredded carrots, which added color as well as flavor.

Great recipe! We had it in bread bowls from Panera Bread.   Since I had some I wanted to use up, I used two cups of heavy cream instead of 1 cup of H&H + one cup of water. We also used about 6 cups of cheese instead of just 4, a mixture of good cheddar, gruyere, and parmesan.   We didn't have any onion flakes, so we just sauted some onions before adding the broth.   We also added some cooked pasta to it to give it some bulk and stretch it. Very tasty! We will make this again.

This was really easy and it doesn't contained processed cheese food (the reason I chose this recipe.)  I took some other reviewers' advice and used diced onion in place of the flakes, and made a kind of roux with butter and flour before I added the broth and cheese.  I added just a dash of garlic powder, also.  I used part colby jack and part cheddar to get them out of my fridge, and it turned out beautifully.  Just love that this doesn't use that cheese loaf stuff.  Thanks for a keeper!

I'll be honest - I didn't measure anything in this recipe, and I used it mostly for inspiration, so take my opinion with a grain of salt (pun intended). I thought it was pretty good, but I know I put in a little more cheese than it called for. I used extra sharp cheddar, and I think that helped carry the cheesy flavor. I also added a little low-sodium soy and a smidgen of garlic powder for kick. I'll bet Worcestershire would work too. I used 2 C skim milk instead of the water and half and half, and I thickened it with some instant potatoes. Came out pretty thick, but I liked it. I also used real onion instead of dried. I'll definitely be making this again for another chilly fall day. Or when I need my kids to eat their broccoli.

Awesome! I loved that this one used cheddar cheese instead of cheese food ( Velveeta ). This is a great recipe! I tweaked it just a little by adding onions and garlic powder to it, to bring out the taste. It was awesome! Keep 'em coming!

This was the best recipe. I fed a large youth group and got rave reviews. I liked it because it used regular cheese. I made the sauce, then put it in a crockpot and added the broccoli and let it simmer (I parboiled the broccoli first).  I was worried since it didn't make a rue first, but it turned out amazing.

Really simple recipe!  I added cheese to the top when serving.  I also sweated down fresh chopped onion before adding the other ingredients.  I will definitely keep this in the cool weather bag for those chilly days to come.

This is such wonderful soup! I tend to use lots more cheese than the recipe calls for and barely cook the broccoli because I hate mushy vegetables. Really good recipe that calls for natural cheese, not the processed stuff.

It was ok.  It needed something.  I followed it step by step.  The consistency was good but it was lacking in flavor.

This soup was just ok. It was all eaten, and no one complained, but the flavor seemed to be really lacking. I added a lot more cheese as other reviewers have suggested, and I'm really glad I did. I even thought it could have used some more. It's definitely a passable recipe, but next time I make broccoli cheese soup I will look for a different one.

When we made this according to recipe, it was very disappointing- but when we added almost three cups of cheddar versus the 4oz, it was pretty darn good!  Very very easy!

I added 1 cup cheddar cheese, 4 slices American cheese, and since my husband is allergic to onion I substituted fresh minced garlic for the flakes. He didn’t care for the garlic, and the soup base was a little thinner than we like for this type of soup. But it was fine for me. Taking some leftovers for lunch at work tomorrow!!!

I made a roux first w the butter and flour. Stirred in chicken broth. Then chopped fresh scallion and use frozen brocolli chopped. I used half of heavy cream. And sharp cheddar. Halved everything except the cheese. A little ground pepper. It was fabulous

I always try the recipe as called for the first time so I can rate correctly.  This was so bland.  After making I had to add more ingredients just to make it where I could eat it and actually like it.  As seen in most of the other reviews they  rated after their additions or changes but as is....I'll not be trying this one again as is.

I added more cheese as per other reviews.  Also, I used turkey stock, added a packet of onion soup mix, some english rib rub, more pepper, and 1/2 lb of frozen corn.  Turned out well.

very good. It actually took a while to find a recipe that didn't use some hideous process cheese or can of soup in it. Soup recipes from scratch are always the best. I added some garlic powder and I doubled the cheese to 8 oz. I also used 2 cups half and half instead of the 1 cup water. I like soups REALLY creamy. I will definitely make this again. Maybe with a couple more alterations. This is a great soup for doing your own thing. :)

It was absolutely delicious!  I used Vegetable broth because that is what I had on-hand.  I also used fresh diced onions and cooked them in the butter, which I then used to create a roux with the flour before adding the milk.  Next time, I will add chopped shredded carrots for a bit of color.

I did not follow the initial instructions for this recipe. Instead, I had my sister make a roux with the flour and butter (I lack the necessary dexterity to do it myself.) She cooked it for about 3 minutes or so. I then added some chicken stock and heavy cream and used the rest for blending with the broccoli. After adding and cooking the broccoli mixture for a few more minutes, I added the cheese. I didn't feel that 4oz of cheese would be enough so I ended up using about 16oz of cheddar cheese. By the time I was done, I realized that I had forgotten the onion.

Overall, I think this recipe is a keeper. The end product was a little bland but it wasn't anything that a sprinkle of Mrs. Dash could not handle. I just think I will use half-and-half instead of heavy cream next time.

I was not at all impressed with this recipe. I too had to make several adjustments. Not only was it still to watery, I also had to use three times as much cheese, garlic salt to taste and two sticks of butter to make the soup a bit more creamery. This was not the first time I've made Broccoli & Cheddar soup. Maybe next time I'll use a whipping cream instead of milk and omit the water. On the other hand maybe it'll be better the second day as other's have stated. But I do think I'll try the bacon next time also. Thanks for the suggestion Ms. K. Aileen.

I thought this soup was very, very good. I read the previous reviews and did add more cheese, probably a whole 8 oz bag of shredded sharp cheddar. I also added a pinch of garlic powder, potatoes and some onion sauted in butter. I will throw in a little crab meat next time, I think that would taste super!

This is the BEST soup ever!  I did add extra cheese, and about a teblespoon of salt, but it was DELICIOUS.  I also topped the soup with more shredded cheddar in the bowl.  Very very good!

Quick and easy, but needed more salt.  I liked it, as did everyone, but it's not the best broccoli soup I've ever had.
