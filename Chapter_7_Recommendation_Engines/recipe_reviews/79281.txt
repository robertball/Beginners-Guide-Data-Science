So juicy and tasty. Best pork roast I've ever had. I was short on time, so I cooked it for 1.5 hours at 375-400 degrees F, and it was perfect. Use a meat thermometer if you adjust the cooking time though!

I used a 2 lb. boneless pork roast and cut huge slits in it about 1 inch apart.  I didn't have dried pineapple on hand, so I used raisins, which worked out well.  I had a huge container of fresh spinach from Sam's Club, so I stuffed as much spinach as possible in each of the slits, along with the raisins from a snack size raisin box.  Take note that the recipe contains no liquid. I added about 1/4 C of water to the roaster, but that wasn't enough.  Two hours later I returned from running errands to find the smell of something burning.  The vegetables were burned black and had to be discarded.  However, the roast survived and tasted great.  Be sure to add some sort of liquid, probably 1 cup would have done it,  to the roaster of pork and vegetables in the oven- water/wine/broth/juice, etc.  Perhaps sliced apples roasting with the pork roast would also be good.  Great recipe, just needs some tweaking.

This was wonderful-I will definitely make this one again.  I used dried pineapple rings cut in half to stuff the roast. Delicious!

Absolutely delicious.  My family didn't want turkey for Thanksgiving so I made this.  I only used 1 teaspoon of the garlic powder and onion powder because I thought a tablespoon of each would be too much. I covered it with loose tin foil and put a little pineapple juice in the bottom of the pan.  I used dried parsley instead of fresh.  No need to baste.  Be sure to use the drippings in the pan as a sauce.  The best part was the smell as it was roasting.  I imagine that smell coming from Gordon Ramsey's kitchen, not mine.  If there was a candle that smelled like that, I'd buy it.  My family was very impressed.  Enjoy!

I didn't have pineapple or spinach, so i stuffed it with dried apricots instead. Best pork recipe i've ever made in my life. My 2lb roast still took about 2.5 hours.  I took another reviewers advice and timed it so that the veggies went in at the end, about 40 minutes before the roast was done. they came out perfectly.

I have made roast pork many times this time I use Jen's spice rub and the pineapples I did add some onion and roasted red yellow and red green pepper, I also roasted the pork for 4 hours instead of two and a half after two and a half I reduce the heat to 300 and kept basting it and now it is pull apart tender. I also made a wonderful batch of pork gravy to go along with the potatoes and the rice.
