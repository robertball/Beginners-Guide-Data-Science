We have been making these for years.  It is great for a quick meal or hearty snack.  Toasting (or baking) the muffins before adding the sauce and cheese gives them a nice crunch, too.

Oh my goodness--my father made these for me when I was a kid in the early 80's!  Only we toasted the english muffins first, then added a slice of tomato, some italian seasoning, a slice of American cheese and then threw them in the oven/microwave to melt the cheese-- YUM YUM!  My kids LOVE them!  You can season with garlic or salt n pepper to taste also.

I've made these ever since I can remember, they're a quick lunch staple in my family! Toasting the muffin beforehand makes it crunchy, and in our toaster-oven we then just use the "top brown" setting once the toppings are on. A dash of Italian seasoning also livens them up if your sauce is not seasoned much.

These make a great snack, and if you don't have any pizza sauce on hand, try them using ketchup (and adding a little garlic powder and oregano), or bbq sauce for a different flavor!

everything can be done to taste if you prefer extra sauce or cheese, make sure u toast the english muffins, add the sauce, cheese and additional toppings and bake until the cheese is melted. i ran out of pizza sauce so i made these with baby rays bbq sauce, pizza shredded cheese, and red onions, extremely good, just like a bbq chicken pizza without the chicken

I used to make these in college and I still make these for lunch from time to time. I always toast the english muffin first and sprinkle garlic powder, italian seasoing and a little salt on top.  It's ready when the cheese is nice and bubbly and a little browned.

My 5 year old loves making these- something she can do pretty much on her own ( other than the cooking part)  Adding additional toppings of you choice makes this a family hit! We also used flour tortillas for a different choice and it was great.  The more toppings you have, obviously the better. We had cheese, sauce, pepperoni, canadian bacon, peppers, olives, onions, tomatoes, and I think that was it.  my husband loved it as well.  We had it twice in one week!

Yummy and so easy!... My 2 yr old daughter loved making her own pizza... I used whole wheat english muffins and they still tasted great... I also toasted the muffins for 5 min prior to putting the sauce and toppings on... sooo good.

Soggy, You Need To Toast the Muffins First, I learned This 50 Years Ago When I made Them When I Was a Kid. I Still Eat Them And This Is My Go To Snack, very kid friendly, you can let them make there own and add other items like green peppers, sausage, mushrooms, onions, Olives, ham etc...

This was a great kid's meal. My daughter said it was awesome. I had leftover mozzarella and some leftover jarred spaghetti sauce that I wanted to use up so this was perfect. I slightly toasted the muffins before topping and baking them. I found that they took much longer than ten minutes and wound up broiling them finally to get the desired quality. We did not use pepperoni since I didn't have any. I will definitely make these again but will add oregano and parmesan on top of the spaghetti sauce to dress it up a bit. I don't buy pizza sauce so I will simply modify the jarred sauce next time. I didn't measure, but don't be afraid to use a lot of sauce. We expected the cheese to make these taste great, but my daughter and I both enjoyed biting in and getting a good dose of the sauce. Wonderful recipe to throw something different together using leftover items around the house. Thank you.  UPDATE: I am changing from 4 stars to 5 with a few simple changes. I lightly toasted the muffins first, generously added the sauce then sprinkled with Italian seasoning. Topped off with shredded mozzarella and pepperoni slices. Baked for 15 minutes and they were perfect with no need to broil them.  With those simple changes, my daughter and I loved them and will be making them often.  Even the two we kept with no pepperoni were wonderful.

My Mother made these 60 years ago and I have fed them to my kids for 40 years with many variations.
Cheddar cheese, Bacon, sliced American cheese, mushrooms ETC. 
Sometimes Peanut Butter and Pre-cooked Bacon, and heat just to the melting of the PB.
GO WILD with these, they are GREAT.

Love these. I used freshly grated Provolone cheese (was out of mozzarella), and sprinkled them lightly with garlic powder, oregano, and red pepper flakes.

We too have been making this for years ... only I brush them with a melted butter mixture with garlic salt (I use the California blend with parsley) and parmesan cheese and broil them til they are brown and then add my toppings ... sometimes I use pizza sauce and other times just the mozzarella cheese, pepperoni, ham, bacon or whatever everyone wants ... EXCELLENT snack or meal!

Very easy and fast for lunch. I used whole wheat english muffins, homemade pizza sauce from this site and freshly grated my own mozzarella cheese. I added some fresh cracked pepper on top before baking 10 minutes.

So fast and so easy! You really can't go wrong with these. I spread the english muffins with a little garlic butter (just some garlic powder in butter) before I put the pizza sauce on just for a little more flavor!

These tasted great and the kids has so much fun making them (even my one and a half year old).  I cooked some green peppers and onions in a pan on the stove and added them to me and my husbands pizzas, but the kids stuck with turkey pepperoni and cheese.

My kids loved making their own pizzas!  (ages 5-10) We used sour dough english muffins and lightly toasted them before adding toppings. We topped with spaghetti sauce, sprinkled on some oregano and Italian seasoning, then cheese, then pineapple tidbits. They took less than 10 min. to cook, and they were yummy. And my kids actually ate their veggies while they waited for their pizzas to bake.

I must give this recipe 5 stars, for the following reasons. I am able to make this a lower fat version. My changes are high protein muffins and of course I use pepperoni on each slice. I first toast the muffin in the toaster. Then I preheat the oven to 425 degrees. I bake in toaster oven for 6 minutes. It turns out great, and low carb too.

Many years ago when our girls were little this is the pizza they asked for all the time - so easy and versatile.   Just use your imagination and great for those "drop ins".....will think you are very clever cook.

The kids and I loved these, my husband has a bigger appetite so he was still hugry after 3 halves. But he didnt eat the fruit salad I served with it either:) 
I made these extra healthy by using low cal whole wheat muffins and 2% mozzarella cheese, also used mini turkey pepperoni slices and canadian bacon rounds.

Easy and quick week night meal!  I toasted the english muffin first so it would be nice and crispy (it seems like if you added the sauce to a raw english muffin it might get soggy)?

My mother made these with us and now i make them with my kids. Any topping that the kid wants works on these delicious little treats. I even do cheeseburger. I make the sauce out of ketchup and mustard, brown some burger, and use shredded cheddar cheese. For us adults I put on chopped onions, green bell pepper, tomato, and when it comes out of the oven I sprinkle some shredded lettuce on top.

a delicious snack! i did not measure the cheese or the pizza sauce because you can just put as much on as you want. i did not toast/bake them before i cooked them, because that would be too crispy for me. i will definitely make again!

I love english muffin pizzas.  The only thing I do different is I lightly toast the english muffin first or it is soggy on the bottom. Very yummy, very quick and so simple when you need something fast!

We had alot of fun doing these as a group. We actually got out a carrot shredder and shredded a carrot for color, and I ended up making a pile of carrots and onions with oil & italian seasoning and a little garlic salt and baked a few that way. Awesome!

Used spaghetti sauce instead of pizza sauce.  I took advice of others and toasted before placing in oven.  I also added  a sprinkle of italian seasoning on each muffin. Use the mini pepperonis, they work great and no cutting!

Wonderful for my kids! My daughter goes crazy for these. We leave out the pepperoni and use whole wheat English muffins. Toast the bread a little first, and then put on the sauce and cheese. I actually just used marinara sauce since that's what I had in the fridge and it still came out delicious.

My mom made these with me when I was a kid and now I make them with my kids!!  I also toast my english muffins before hand to make them crunchier.  I also add italian seasoning and garlic to my sauce.  We also put veggies, like onion, green pepper, spinach, tomatoes, pineapple, etc.  This is a quick and easy dinner!!

I always loved these as a kid but they have kind of lost their attraction as an adult. Still--very popular with kids/teens, and not expensive, which is always a good thing. They look pretty, too, on a plate.

These are my kids absolute favorite.  My five year old asks for them for breakfast EVERYDAY!  We've made these at birthday parties for an activity and a meal as well as at moms group activities where the kids get to make their own creations. It's always a success.

I was looking for a quick lunch for my boys today and had some clearance English muffins that I wanted to use up quickly, plus some pepperoni and pizza sauce I bought cheap at Grocery Outlet. I mashed up some cooked carrots in the pizza sauce before I spread it on the English muffins to get some extra veggies in the kids without their knowledge. Next time, I'll add cooked spinach. This was an excellent idea for exactly what I needed. Woo!

Quick, easy, and tasty!  Also pretty cheap if you are able to buy multiple packs of English muffins at a Costco or similar store.  
I used pasta sauce that I already had open for my pizza sauce and to me that didn't effect the taste at all.  I had some pesto in the fridge, so I also added that on top of the sauce, which I thought was a good touch.

My son loves these for a quick after school snack. I am teaching him to cook and this is an easy recipe that he enjoys. We do this under the broiler on low setting for 3 minutes and they turn out great. He also likes a couple of fresh basil leaves on his.

5 stars because they're so darn easy, I usually have everything in the fridge, and they satisfy my junk food cravings. I often use shredded sandwhich meat instaead of pepperoni - just make sure you put it under the cheese otherwise it burns.

Man, these are yummy! I agree with a previous reviewer that toasting the muffins a bit gives them a good crunch - if you like crunchy pizza. This recipe calls for a little more cheese than we use, and any topping works well here. I use canned mushrooms and usually only need to bake for about 8 minutes.

Pretty good, quick & easy. Toasting the english muffins first is a must! Try the mini pepperoni or chop up the regular slices to fit on the english muffin better. I also added some finely chopped sweet onion on top of the pepperoni and a sprinkle of garlic powder to the sauce before the cheese. Yum!

Brush the muffins with a little bit of olive oil and pre-toasting the muffins before assembly is a small tweak that really brings out the flavors and helps to prevent them from being too soggy.

Quick and easy! What more can you ask for? The kids loved making their own little pizzas. The best part is how versatile the recipe is. Pineapple and ham, sausage and pepperoni ... the possibilities are endless. No more bickering over what kind of pizza to get. Everyone has their own. I baked these on a preheated pizza stone, so I had no problem with soggy muffins. We will be making these again for sure!

The only thing I will add to this is.....if you want them crispy, either toast the muffins in the toaster first or put them in the oven for a few minutes before putting the ingredients on....much better this way!!!

My mother made these for us years ago. When I had my own kids, I toasted the English muffins first -- I have a bit of a soggy bread phobia. Toasting before adding sauce did the trick for me.

When I was a child my mother would make these on toasted hamburger buns. Now I make them for my great granddaughter. It's fun for the children to help with no matter how young they are.

Ive been making these for years and still love them.  Like just about everyone else said, toast the english muffin first.  Also, I've always used the broiler rather than baking them in the oven so they cook much faster but can easily burn.  I suppose I'll try my toaster oven next time.  I have loved these little pizzas for years!

I have been making these pizzas for almost 40 years but with sausage. So easy and my kids and 8 grandkids love them. We make them now with whatever each individual likes, from just cheese to thin sliced peppers and onions or mushrooms.

I love the crust and toppings but in the middle of the muffin it would get soggy. For the last two minutes I turned the oven on broil so the cheese would really melt, also I cut the pepperoni into smaller pieces before I put it on the pizza. Other than that it's was pretty good

These are great and the toppings you can use are endless. My son had friends over for a football party. I set up toppings in small dishes (onions, diced tomatoes, sliced olives, crumbled sausage, bacon, pepperoni slices, jalapeno slices, pineapple tidbits, etc) and let everyone assemble their own. It was a huge hit and all the kids loved it. I've tried them with the mini bagels as well as English muffins and both are great. I agree that you need to toast them before assembly.

I wasn't in the mood to cook dinner tonight so decided to make these quick english muffin pizzas.  I read the reviews first so I toasted the muffins before adding sauce and toppings, which I think is a must!   No need to measure the sauce, cheese and pepperoni, just eye ball it.  Great easy snack or meal especially when served with a salad.

Perfect for today's lazy sunday lunch.  I mainly used this recipe for oven temp/times since I haven't made these in years and forgot those bits.  I took reviewer's advice and toasted the english muffins before putthing them together, used diced leftover hamsteak in place of pepperoni (didn't have any on hand) and sprinkled with garlic powder, italian seasoning and pepper before putting in the oven.  Yum!

I first leaned about this Recipe back in the 60's. I am on a low salt diet and so far this is the only recipe I have found for pizza that stays within my limit on salt. With low fat cheeze you could maintain a low fat and low sugar diet also. Great!!! Good old fashion food without the abundance of salt, sugar and fat of todays processed factory made food. Even for our son, less salt means he drinks less soda.

I like to toast them first, make a topping "bar" for the kids to select from and they eat it all up!

I love these because they are easy enough for my kids to make all on their own.  They love them for lunch, snacks, or dinner.  You could really use any combination of your favorite toppings, but my kids always choose pepperoni.

Such a great, easy, idea with so many options.  My grandchildren are amazed at how easy it is to fix their pizzas now.  Plus, they get to make them.  Of course, their favorite is cheese pizza.

PERFECT for our sleep over party. I cooked some sausage and laid out tons of different ingredients for the kids and let them all make their own pizzas. They enjoyed making them and they enjoyed eatting them. I made one of mine with the "Insalata Caprese I" recipe found on this site and it was amazingly good.

I grew up eating these as a kid, and still enjoy them as an adult. Only I pop them in the toaster first, get the English muffin since and crispy.  I then spread tomato sauce I have and use any cheese. Then to melt the cheese I pop in the microwave for a few seconds. So yummy!

Easy, fast, and delicious!  I toasted the muffins first and used baby spinach and red pepper on my mini pizzas.  The possibilties with these are endless and I look forward to making them again!

I made these last night for a really quick dinner with salad.  I had some extra pesto from the night before so on a few of them I used that instead of the pizza sauce and it was delicious!  Also, I used turkey pepperoni because it contains 70% less fat and tastes just as great.  Nothing fancy but I would make this again.

Have done these over the last 32 years . . . with/for my kids!  But also - great fun at gatherings.  Put out bowls with various toppings and let everyone make their own pizzas.  Great fun!

Made this with a group of Tiger Cub Scouts (1st Graders), went very well, kids especially liked the mini-pepperonis that I found.  Used bagels instead, just because of the various varieties (plain, egg, tuscan herb, etc.), favors that are not available as english muffins.  Yes, you do want to toast the bage/muffin before assembly to give the "pizza" some firmness when transferring from oven to plate...I sandwiched a few in the process.

These are so fast, easy, and yummy! My three year old has a blast making her very own "tiny pizzas". They are also good with very little sauce for my son who has reflux. I agree with the previous reviews in toasting them for a few minutes before adding the toppings.

Always a big hit, especially my daughter who loves putting her pizza together herself. I add green peppers and olives to mine, but the rest of the family is happy with straight-up pepperoni.

These are easy, quick to make and remind me of my childhood but if you don’t toast the English muffins in the oven or toaster before you put the sauce and topping some on them then the muffins are soggy, floppy and hard to bite into. If you want them to be more like pizza and taste better then you need to toast them! 
*I remembered this too late and had already followed the directions of this recipe so I let them cool, added more cheese and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes and that helped crisp up the bottom so they weren’t so soggy and made them a little more edible and taste like pizza.

Have made similar recipe for 30+years. Most people can eat a regular size pizza. My version: 3 English muffins split on a large pizza pan. 1/4 piece of American cheese on each one. Spoon LG tablespoon sauce over this. Chop up your toppings of choice. I like pepperoni, sausage,and mushroom. You decide how much topping you want, I use about 2T. for each muffin half. A shake of parmesan cheese,and a TBS. or more of shredded mozzarella. Bake at400° for 10-12 min. on top shelf of oven. Then broil on high till top browned to your liking. It's a very flexible recipe. Play with it. It's that type of recipe, I love it.

This is a great & easy recipe for on-the-go pizza. Easy to handle and even to pack for lunches! I used my own homemade pizza sauce and it was amazing. Kids will definitely love this.

Made recipe as is and it was good, but next time I will definitely toast the muffins first before adding the toppings and putting the pizzas back in to bake.  As is they were a little too soft and the pizza sauce made them a little soggy.  Still good but would have been better toasted first.  No regrets though, will make again!!!

Pretty good, but there is just one thing you need to change. Before you put it in the oven, make sure to put your English muffin in the toaster before, otherwise you will have a soggy pizza. Otherwise, it was very quick and easy, and tasted good.

We thought these were great! I do like the idea as another reviewer suggested to toast the muffins first, so I may try that next time, but they were still tasty as is~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I have been making these for years and years.  They are foolproof and absolutely delicious. There is no end to the varieties you can try. I turn the broiler on for a couple of minutes at the end just to crisp up the toppings.  They freeze really well also!

I was hungry for something, but not willing to cook just for myself .  My hubby has a flu bug and had chicken soup.  I didn't want that.  So I thought, I bet I could make pizza out of english muffins.  So, I found the recipe.  I did toast the muffin first.  I used the spaghetti sauce in the fridge.  It had ground beef in it.  I just topped with cheese.  These were wonderful.. I can't wait for the grand kids to come over, so I can let them make them.  Thanks

I only used two muffins, and baked for the same amount of time and temperature in our toaster oven and it still came out fantastic. This is a recipe that will live on in our household.

Super easy and delicious the kids love them. I like to put olive on on the English muffin and toast them before adding the pizza sauce and cheese gives it a crunchy crust.

My grandma used to make this for us. I looked up the recipe just to find the time and temp. It is now our once a week lunch recipe that my children will be able to start making all on their own. Love recipes like that.

We made these in the sixties, as kids they were our favorites.  Just made them for my husband tonight (he is retired) and we still laughed about how good and easy they are.  Yes, use Thomas' English muffins so the sauce goes into the cracks.  Use good pizza sauce, good pepperoni and cheese and you won't be disappointed.  Add some crushed red pepper flakes for the adults if you like a little heat.

My daughter loves making these. Usually for lunch the day after we had spaghetti. Jarred Pizza sauce works great. So does pasta sauce (I make homemade sauce with ground beef usually). Using that and some mushrooms it's a delicious, filling meal. Make them as written if you like (they're awesome!). However, we prefer to toast the English muffins first so they don't get soggy from the sauce.

These are the perfect quick and easy dinner or snack.  Lightly toast the muffins first, don't use a lot of sauce; pepperoni and black olives on top of the cheese.

Made a large amount of these for a relative who was ill.  Cooked fully, then placed on baking sheet in freezer until fully frozen.  Popped them in a bag, and she absolutely loved them!  The only change was adding fresh basil from my garden.

They turned out great, perfect for a quick snack or a small meal. For those that prefer a crispier crust, I broil mine for around 4 minutes instead of baking them. They are nicely toasted and all the toppings piping hot.

I first learned how to do these little pizzas in the early '80s. Very yummy! You can also add canadian bacon or any precooked topping.

This was a lot of fun for my 4-year old because she could put together her own and feel like she "cooked" her own dinner.  I did follow the suggestions of the some of the other commentators and toasted the muffins first.  For my daughter I followed the recipe as it was written (minus the pepperoni because she's not a fan).  For mine, I subbed in fresh tomato slices for the canned sauce, and instead of pepperoni I added fresh garlic and some dried basil.  SO GOOD.  I personally think the fresh tomato version is a lot better than the canned sauce, but both were good and this recipe was definitely fast and easy like it promised.

These are great for a quick easy dinner. We have had them several times over the years and they are good. I like to add a little bit of garlic and a few mushrooms to them sometimes.

These have always been a quick and easy "go to" in my house. They are fun to make when my super picky brothers are coming over! My brothers will eat several at a time and that is saying something since all they normally eat is cereal and chicken nuggets.

These are great!  My mom used to make them for us as kids, and my sister makes them.  I think I may have made them once a few years ago too, but I wasn't sure about the oven temperature, cook time, etc., so I pulled this recipe.  I did not read the other reviews before cooking, so I did not toast the muffins.  Instead, I cooked at 350 for 10 minutes as directed, but then turned the oven to broil for 2 to 3 minutes more.  They tasted great - I don't think you need to toast them.  We had ours as Hawaiian pizzas with ham and pineapple, but you could use whatever you want.  They are very easy and versatile.

We add a thin slice of tomato before the sauce.  After any toppings the kids want we then put a dash of italian seasoning on top.  Every kid should help make these!

Quick and easy! We're not really a fan of english muffins, so I subbed in bagels instead. I made sure to toast the bagels prior to putting them in the oven to make sure they were extra crunchy. Will probably be making them again!

I agree with some of the other reviews about toasting the muffins before hand. If you like a crunchy crust it is a good idea. But very easy to make, suprisingly tasty. I can't believe that I didn't think about using english muffins before. Thanks for a great idea!

Fun, healthy, and fast... this is my kind of recipe! I used whole wheat english muffins.  I do not like pepperoni so I instead  topped these with broken  peices of mushroom, spinach, white onion, and "butterball everyday turkey sausage links".  I also sprinkled it with a little oregano. This recipe is simple enough allow for creativity.  Very tasty!

Good but not crispy, next time I will cook for 15 minutes.  Otherwise, very easy and kids love making their own.  Find that they actually eat more when they make their own.
