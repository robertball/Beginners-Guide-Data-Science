I have made this recipe for the past 3 years (Thanksgiving & Christmas holidays) and my family loves it! It's also a big hit at work. I too feel that the topping could use some improvment. For the topping, I have added oatmeal and it does make it more like a "crisp." Also, the addition of a little flour (enhanced with pumpkin pie spice) stretches the mix to ensure that there is enough to cover the top. A must try for those who want a little something different for the holidays!

Getting tired of the same old pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, so I thought I try something a little different. Enter Pumpkin Crisp. Nice substitute for regular pumpkin pie and is a nice accompaniment to my requisite apple pie. The yellow cake is so much more interesting than standard pie crust and marries well with the pumpkin filling. However the topping mixture didn't work out all the well as it was not turning into coarse crumbs during preparation. Too much butter? Not enough cake mix? I ended up adding more flour (about 1/2 cup) and 2 tbsps of sugar (might try brown sugar next time), and a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to cut the flour taste to the topping mixture in order to get the consistency right. This gave me more than enough topping and I may even back off a bit on the amount of topping I add to the dish next time. But it was a hit and I'll definitely make it again. 4 stars for flavor and "interesting" factor, a star off for recipe adjustment.

Great recipe. Took longer to prepare since I used fresh pumpkin rather than canned, but well worth the extra effort. I will try it again using pie crust instead of the mix suggested by the recipe.

This recipe is ABSOLUTLEY THE BEST TASTING pumpkin dessert out there!!!! I like to use canned pumpkin pie mix instead of the pumpkin puree and just cut back to 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg.

Ive made this quite a few times and everyone loves it. But Im bothered how the cake mix on the bottom NEVER gets cooked? Its always still raw dough. Does anyone else have this problem, or is it suppose to be like that?

Gosh, this is good!  Others' general comments are echoed here:  The crust was kind of sticky so I mixed in some rolled oats before patting it down.  Doubled the spices in the pumpkin mixture just because.  Crumb topping was improved by adding less sugar - only 1/2 cup - as well as about 1/2 cup each of flour and rolled oats.  Finally, had to bake it at least 15 minutes longer than suggested (70-75 min).  Just had a bite to make sure it wasn't poison - and it isn't!

This recipe is delicious! I added a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts to the topping. The topping was very wet so I added about 1/3 cup of flour to make it crumbly. Rave reviews from family and friends, but if sugar and fat calories are a concern, this recipe is not for you.

This was delicious! Its similar to pumpkin pie but I love the sugar topping, it really gives it that extra something.  The only change I made was to use half brown sugar and half white sugar for the topping (instead of all white sugar) and it came out really good.  I will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving!

Oh my gosh, this is SO good!  My six year old that is super picky and would normally never touch pumpkin pie loves it!  I wanted to test it out before making it for Thanksgiving.  I can't wait for my family to try it.  I am no fan of pumpkin pie at all, but this this is amazing!

I make this every year. The only thing I do different is I do not make the crumble crust. I have always just spread the cake mix over the top and then drizzled the butter all over the top

I can never remember the name of this so I call it pumpkin stuff. I have made twice now and love it! The first time I made it, I mixed up the sugar and butter measurments for the crumble topping so I added a couple of tablespoons of flour and a couple of handfuls of oats....very good mistake! The next time, I kept the sugar and butter correct and only added a 1/4 cup of white sugar and 1/2 cup of brown sugar and added the oats....even better! Just add pinches of the gooey topping all over and bake as directed. Rave reviews!

Delicious!  Just what I was looking for.  Even those who don't like pumpkin liked it!  Did use 1/2 cup sugar in topping and cut in cold butter, not soft.  may try a little less butter in bottom next time??

This was good, but I think I was aiming more for a cobbler, so I'll have to keep looking for recipes.  Next time I might use one 14-oz can pumpkin instead of 2 as the layers seemed off (too much pumpkin).  Also, since it said to serve it warm, the next time I might refrigerate it first, then warm it later.  Pumpkin stayed very hot for a long time, even though the rest cooled off more quickly.  A very rich dessert.

This is absolutely delicious.  I add a cup of chopped pecans to the topping to crunch it up a little bit - and this is typically gone BEFORE the pumpkin pie.  So much easier - and really just scrumptious! Thank you Bunny for posting such a wonderful recipe - it helps round out my desserts during the holidays every year.

I made this according to the recipe using a King Arthur Flour Co golden vanilla cake mix that was a little past its "use by" date. I had no trouble covering the surface with the topping mixture - I went lightly at first to cover and then went back to fill in.  A little extra baking time took the topping from goo to crisp. Everyone said it was good and went back for another square.  It won't replace pumpkin pie for me, but it is a nice change.

Everyone in my family loved it, even my little brother (and he's picky). My topping didn't come out crumbly, but it was hard, so there was still a crisp to the dessert (I followed some other people's advice and used half brown sugar). Will probably be making it again!

I'v made this recipe a few times and everyone raves about it. It's so easy to whip together, yet the second time I made it I accidentally added the whole can of evaporated milk. It turned out just fine. I also added 5 minutes to the coking time, making sure the center is done. Very rich! :D

Great recipe, couldn't get the topping to work like it was supposed too. However that was my fault I'm just starting to make desserts at 35. The plus is this came out perfect even though I added too much evaporated milk. Definetly try as an alternative to pie.

I have been making this recipe since about 2001 and there is not a holiday meal that goes by that I am not asked to make it!  It has been a hit with the kids and all the adults. Even the ones that swear they do not like pumpkin. This is one of my favorite recipes!

Quick, easy, and crowd pleasing!  My only substitution was using a Cinnamon Swirl cake mix (Betty Crocker) I had on hand, instead of using yellow cake mix. It was probably better for it.

Well, the boyfriend loved this, but I just thought it was OK.  I guess it was the crust I wasn't fond of (to buttery).  I did run out of sugar when making the topping (I was over his house) so it didn't come out crumbly.  Since he enjoyed this more than me, I left the recipe with him!

Eventhough I messed up the cake mix part, my family loved it.  Use less butter in the crust for sure.  Nutmeg goes a long way so I reduced it to 1/4t.  I didn't have evaporated milk so I subbed 3T melted butter & enough whole milk to equal 2/3c.  I'll try it again without talking.  That should help.  Ha.

My children loved this. Got great reviews for Thanksgiving dinner. My husband loved it but still loves the traditional pumpkin pie. I would rather have this and so would the children. I guess it's 6 to 1 in our favor so he loses and we win this for next thanksgiving desert! Sorry honey but we rather eat this! Thanks for the great recipe, Robin

This is delicious. The only thing I didn't like about it was the topping. There was too much butter and it wasn't like I could just add more cake mix to it by then.

The batter does not set up and leaves you with a gooey mess that makes it seem uncooked.  I even cooked it for 75 minutes and it just does not set up.  Will not make again.

AWESOME!  We don't like pie crust so this recipe was exactly what we were looking for. For step 3, we switched 3/4 cup of white sugar for brown sugar.  We don't care for pumpkin pie spice that most recipes call for, so this recipe was perfect!  The great thing about it is you can interchange the spices to your taste.  Thank you for sharing this recipe. I felt bad when my aunt (who is known for her pumpkin pie) showed up for Thanksgiving and everyone wanted the cobbler.

I made this recipe using both Pumpkin Puree as the recipe calls for as well as with Pumpkin Pie Mix. Both versions came out excellent and all of my family loved it. Quick, Easy, and Delicious.

During the Holidays, I like to make pumpkin desserts.  But honestly, I'm more of a fan of the idea of pumpkin than the actual thing.  This dessert was right up my alley.  It's very similar to the fruit crisps you can make with a cake mix and lots of butter.  I took it to a church luncheon and several women asked for the recipe.  I had a little left over to bring home, but it seemed like everyone who tried it liked it.

Easy to make, but too high in fat.  The flavor is not worth the added calories and fat.  I would rather go back to good old pumpkin pie.

This is a super good pumpkin dessert.  It is not really a "crisp" like the title claims but more of a cross between pumpkin pie and a cake. The bottom and top are cake-like and the middle has all the flavor and creamy texture of a pumpkin pie. But whatever you want to call it...it is delicious!  I made a couple small tweaks. I used 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon and nutmeg.  I could not find an 18.5 ounce cake mix so I used a 16.5 ounce mix and added 5 tablespoons of all purpose flour and it came out perfect.

This was a different twist than the usual pumpkin pie. It has a really nice flavor.The bottom of mine baked just fine but the top layer of pumpkin right under the streusel didnt cook completely. I added brown sugar and cinnamon to the streusel topping and it made it over the top.

I have made this recipe often and it always a hit. I forgot about it this year and just made it again. As for the topping, I use hard butter and cut it into the mixture. It turns out much better and is more of a "crisp" topping, but not quite. This is a great fall recipe. I will be making lots of these to take to family and friends when invited!

It was OK. It wasn't fabulous, but it wasn't bad. And it wasn't a CRISP.

I found the instructions to soften the butter in the crust odd, usually you would want cold butter to cut in. 

I didn't hate it, don't get my wrong. I ate it. But, I do think there are better pumpkin recipes out there.

This was very good.  It was kind of like gooey cake except with pumpkin.  My topping was not crumbly - it turned out creamy, so I had to try to spread it over the pumpkin.  I may have stirred it too much, but it was still good.

This recipe was superb!!!  It was easy to make and even easier to eat.  I highly recommend this recipe to anyone who loves pumpkin pie.  The only complaint I have is the topping.  I don't know if it was the way I mixed the topping but it came out creamy rather than crumbly.  Other than that, this recipe will be a Thanksgiving tradition years to come.

Made this yesterday for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. I also had a problem with the topping. It was in one big lump. Somehow I put small pcs. of the mixture all over, covering the top. and it came out almost caramelized. Thanks Bunny for this wonderful(especially warm from the oven)recipe.

A good, easy dessert, will make again. Those who had problems with topping and crust - be sure to use regular stick butter or margarine not light or spreads.

I followed all directions & even took it out of the oven 5 minutes before the stated 55 in the recipe, but the bottom was nearly burned and negatively affected the taste.  The pumpkin flavor was not prominate enough for me.

Thought it was better after being in the fridge overnight.  However, especially initially, the topping definitely did not work out right (maybe adding extra flour or oats would have helped), and we thought the pumpkin filling was not sweet enough and could have used some extra sugar. The bottom crust was definitely very tasty, though.

Well this was the first time I can honestly say I wasn't impressed with a recipe.   I wasn't happy with the "crisp" part of this recipe.  It was not crispy.   All the recipes for Pumpkin Cake or Upside Down Pumpkin Cake have a very nice crisp/crunchy topping.  I like the idea of a crust like layer on the bottom of this recipe.  And the pie filling was very good.  After this point I would now follow the recipe for those other cakes and use another box of yellow cake mix and sprinkle the dry ingredients all over the pie filling, and then about 2 cups chopped pecans, followed by 1/2 cup melted butter poured evenly over the top.  May want to use a little more butter.  Then cook as per the recipe.  The cake mix on top cooked this way with the pecans, etc give the cake a very nice crunchy top!

Just made this for a football party and everyone went crazy for it.  I made something similar to it weeks ago - something from a box - and the store didn't have it anymore so I found this recipe.  Everyone agreed this was WAAAAAAAY better than the box mix.  I heard comments like, "This is like crack!" "I'm glad I didn't have this recipe when I was pregnant, I would have eaten the whole pan!" etc.  I accidentally only bought 1/2 the pumpkin the recipe, but i made it anyway and put it in a 9x9 and it obviously turned out great.  I might try to make this a little healthier next time - less butter and maybe splenda instead of suar??? and see if it's still just as good.

This was sooo yummy! Although, as my husband likes to say, it was "turn your head inside-out sweet."

I made this today using the exact recipe and did not see it's similarity to pumpkin pie.  This was SO SO sweet!  With pumpkin pie the crust is slightly salty and compliments the filling.  In this recipe the crust on the bottom and the "crisp" top are so sugary from the cake mix.  I would only recommend this if you like super sweet deserts.  It's no rival for real pumpkin pie!

I ate this at a church potluck and came home and got right on here to print out a copy of this for myself! The topping was carmelized and the overall taste of this dessert is divine.  I am going to add this to my Thanksgiving menu this year.  Maybe I will try to cut fat by using less butter in the topping, that will kill two birds w/ one stone since it seems like people had trouble with the topping not crumbling also.  However, it is great made just like the recipe states if fat weren't an issue in my house, I'd make it without any revisions.

This Pumpkin Crisp is wonderful, I took it to a church function and came home with none.  However it gets better if it sits overnight.

I made this last fall and didn't think it was anything special. A co-worker asked me today when I was going to make it again. I guess it was memorable!

The flavor is good, but I don't know that I would call it pumpkin 'crisp', it seems too moist to fit that title. 

Either way, I'm making it again for my co-workers :)

This was delicious! The cake mix makes the pie taste so much better than regular pie dough. I made it for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it so much I have requests to make it for Christmas! I added a 1/2 cup of halved pecans to the topping to give it more texture. Amazing!!

This was a great alternative for pumpkin lovers.   Everyone in my family, including kids, loved it.  Other reviews have stated that the topping was not crumbly.  If you use cold butter, it should help.  Worth trying!

The taste is fantastic! I'm definately going to make this a Thanksgiving tradition. The only problem I came across is the topping mixture didn't form crumbles like the directions said it would. Other than that, it was a definate five star recipe.

The instructions say to "pat" the crust into the pan, but the crust was thick batter and needed to be spread with a spatula.  It says to "pour" the filling over the crust, yet it was too thick to be poured and had to be scraped in.  The topping, the crisp part, said to "sprinkle" over the pumpkin mixture, yet it was runny like soft cookie dough and had to be spooned and gently smeared across the top.  The cakey crust was bland.  The filling was drab.  The only good thing about it was the little bits of topping that were actually sweet, almost a caramel taste.  My 3 kids hated it, I only ate the top of mine, and I would not recommend it to anyone.

My family really enjoyed this. I have to say I read all the comments and incorporated a number of them. Used spice cake mix, and added 1/3 cup of oatmeal to bottom crust. Then substituted brown sugar for white in the pumpkin filling. Finally used 1/2 brown and 1/2 white sugar in the topping and did not soften the butter but just cut it into cake and sugar mixture. Finally sprinkled with chopped pecans.  Lots of small changes but I have to say it was a hit. Baked it for about 75 minutes.

Been looking for this recipe for awhile. Made it years ago then lost the recipe. One happy cookie here now. So far everyone who has tried it loves it. With only half of it left may have to make another one for thanksgiving tomorrow.

It turned out delicious but it wasn’t pretty so no pics. I cut down the sugar and butter content because it seemed like too much and I added more cinnamon to the topping. I also used fresh pumpkin. It was a hit and I think I might make it again for the holidays.

Changed thanksgiving up this year with this recipe. All I got was good reports from family members - what a hit! We did much less sugar though. For all sugar instructions, I simply just put 1/3cup. The only issue I had was the crumble on the top. I will try next time with oats as many have said in the comments.

Substitutes: white cake mix (it's what I had), doubled spices (tripled cinnamon) , added Bisquick & more cinnamon to make enough topping... Killaz. Most preferred dessert - all gone.

Yep DEFINITELY more interesting and flavorful than pumpkin pie.  I used organic ingredients and cut the sugar in the pumpkin mix in half and did not miss it a bit.  Also threw in some allspice   I couldn't wait until it cooled before digging in and three days later my mouth is still in pain.  In case you're wondering....of course it was worth it!  Thanks for sharing and I'll send good vibes your way every time I make this (which will be often, I assure you).

Awesome recipe.  I took this to work and the Gen. Mgr. of the company said it was better than any pumpkin pie he has had.  Scored major brownie points there, and the recipe was so easy to make.

I added two tablespoons of flour to the pumpkin mixture and it firmed up perfectly. I used pumpkin pie spices with cinnamon and it was excellent! My family prefers this to pumpkin pie and the 9x13 size serves at least 10, with generous servings.  It tasted even better the next day.  Love it!

This is easy to make and my daughter who has always had to have "pumpkin pie" requested this instead. It is added to our traditional menu.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit! I will make this again. Even my Mom who does not like Pumpkin Pie thought this was very good. It is creamier than Pumpkin Pie and much more delicious! I would recommend using cold butter as my crumbs were too mushy, but it was still worth it!

This was even better the second day. I added nuts to the topping and a little lemon juice to the pumpkin puree.  Delicious. I will definitely make again for company.

This is a good pumpkin recipe.  I do think it's better than regular pumpkin pie, it did take longer to prepare than I thought it would though.  I got mixed reviews from my family.  My husband didn't like it as much as regular pumpkin pie, but my mom and I both liked it better.  This is a good recipe and it deserves a try if you like pumpkin pie.  I also think it would be good in a pie shell instead of making the bottom layer.

I first made this recipe for Thanksgiving in 1999.  It got RAVE reviews from everyone - most said they liked it more than regular pumpkin pie.  I've since added chopped pecans to the topping and now people RAVE even more!!  Try it ... you'll LOVE it!!

My crust was to juicy to pat into the pan so I just poured it in.  This is a very tasty treat.

Tastes very good. I was a little hesitant at first due to the crust  being a yelloe cake mix. In the past I have found this to make a really rich crust. That didnt seem to be the case here. My 10 year old son said "This is the only thing i like that has pumpkin in it. Definently worth trying!

This is delicious! This is a great 
alternative to pumpkin pie if you are
just not into pie making. My family 
loved it and it is even better the 
second day.

This recipe was easy to prepare and tastes good warm and cold.  My 7-year old says he likes better than pumpkin pie and even my 4-year old ate it.  Thanks for the recipe - I will use it often!

Tried this at a friends house last night & thought it was great - so did everyone else - I don't think I'll be making traditional pumpkin pie again either.
