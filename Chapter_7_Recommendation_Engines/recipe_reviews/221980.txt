Absolutely delicious! I couldn't find soul food seasoning so I used creole seasoning instead. I also used a small piece of smoked turkey I already had instead of buying liquid smoke and only 1/4 cup of peanut butter (my family loves it but I can't stand the stuff).The smell was mouthwatering and it was one of the first times everyone ate their veggies before anything else. A shockingly great recipe that may seem unusual but is well worth trying. An excellent change from the usual collard greens. Thanks.

Loved this recipe and its  one of my family favorite dish. Im from the South I have never eaten peanut butter in a Collard Green recipe. Its delicious. But Im giving full warning, cook enough because  the pot is going to be empty, thats how good this recipe is.

I will definitely be making this dish again; I just love finding delicious new ways to eat fish!  This was great because it was hearty and filling, which is hard to find for fish recipes.  I substituted Jerk seasoning for the Soul Food seasoning, because it was what I had on-hand.  It worked just great!  I would definitely recommend sticking to medium heat, as the recipe suggests; I was in a hurry and turned up the heat on my pot, resulting in the dish sticking a bit to the bottom of the pan and overcooking just a bit.  The greens tasted great, though, so no real harm done.  Thank you so much!

Both my husband and I thought this is one of the best things I've ever made! (Our five year old son liked it too.) We have a peanut allergy so I used almond butter and I used mahi fillets since that's what I had on hand. It was awesome. Oh the other thing was that I just used the bacon grease instead of the vegetable oil. Threw it all in a cast iron pot and let it simmer away. IT WAS DELISH.

These are the best greens I have ever had! I was never a big fan of greens until I tried this recipe. I am addicted! I use about 1.5 lbs of greens - whatever I have available or a mixture: collards, kale, even baby spinach. I’ve served it over rice as a meal unto itself or alone as a side dish. I’ve never added the flounder although I’m sure it would be good. YUM!!
