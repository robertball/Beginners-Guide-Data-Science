This was a HUGE hit at our party! I was surprised how good this was with sausage; next time I'll add a bit more, as it ran out first. HELPFUL NOTE: "Large" shrimp, F.Y.I., if bought frozen, are the "21-25" shrimp-per-pound size (I stood debating this in the freezer section way too long!). I thawed the shrimp slightly under cold water before cooking. The dipping butter was delicious too. I served this with "German Coleslaw", "Luau Punch", and "Raspberry Cake" from this site-- all huge hits! =)

Using good ol' southern shrimp, sausage, corn... (asian shrimp varieties don't compare in flavor). Ice cold beer and fresh southern table wine (iced tea) are a perfect match. Doesn't hurt to start with boiled peanuts! This is flexible country cookin' that's best eaten outside but if the skeeters are out in force, inside works just fine!

Excellent and couldn't be an easier meal.  I've made this at home and while camping.  I dump it all into a big bowl and let everyone dig in.  It's always a big hit.  I use about 5 cloves of garlic and Old Bay seasoning rather than crab boil;  works equally well.   I like to break the corn into 2 or 3 pieces to make it easier to eat.  Once, I found frozen lobster claws which I added with jumbo E-Z peel shrimp.  Aaahhh, life is good!  Thanks for a wonderful meal!

Just returned from a week at the Jersey shore and I must say that this fantastic dish was the dinner hit of the week!! I used water and beer and took it a step further by adding clams and lobsters. A great summer treat that's even more fun when you share it with a bunch of your friends. Thanks so much!!

I gave this recipe three starts for a few reasons. One is the ease of cleanup.I dumped it out on newspaper on the table. It is very easy to roll up the newspaper and there are no plates to clean. the kids love it. It is a lot of fun and a new way to have dinner. It was a one pot meal and added to the ease of cleanup. It feeds a lot of people although I just did half a recipe and still had leftovers.   There is not much flavor to the dish. I did add the old bay, 2 onions, and 2 lemons. It  smelled very good while cooking but it lacked in flavor. i am not sure what else to add to make it more flavorful.

This was fantastic.  Made it for my husbands birthday.  He wouldn't have enjoyed it more if we were at a 5 star restaurant.  This had all his favorites and the flavors blend just perfectly.  I made it just according to recipe except I forgot to buy a lemon.  I was great anyway.  Will definitely make again and again.  Was worried about how to reheat the leftovers but it was easy and it was just as tasty the second time around.  I stored the left overs without any of the broth.  Then to reheat, I boiled water with minced garlic, onion, and some old bay seasioning, let that simmer a short while, then threw in the left over frogmore stew and let it get good and hot.  That was it, and it really did not lose any flavor.

WOW!!! Was this ever good!!  So delish, and so much fun for a hot summer night...4 of us devoured all but a bowlful, which my son picked at later that night, and my husband finished the next day.  Can't wait to make it again with our fresh summer corn, and I can't wait to make it for company!  Yummm!!!

Loved this! It was simple and easy, and most of all inexpensive. There is a restaurant in Seattle that serves clam,muscle, and shrimp boils and we can never get out of there and not spend at least a hundred dollars. So happy I found this, and no longer have to drive to give my husband an authentic at home Frogmore Stew! Thanks again!

I've made this dish many times as this  Zatarains or Louisiana crab boil mix.   In Louisiana this is an old dish called a Crab or seafood boil, it's a creole dish.

Very good! I like to spice it up more with cayenne. Like most frogmore recipes, it adds the sausage too early. Perhaps some like the flavor to blend more, but it overlooks them for my taste, since it's already cooked.  Also the potato cook time was at least 5 min. Too long. They got too mushy.

This was yummy!  I have made frogmore stew before but it did not have the garlic, or onion which I think made this a bit better :)  Good eats!
