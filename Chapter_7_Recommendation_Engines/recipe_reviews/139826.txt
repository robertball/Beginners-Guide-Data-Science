I adjusted the recipe by using goat cheese instead of blue cheese.  It was outstanding!  I also baked the mushrooms upside down for about 4-5 minutes before turning over and adding the olive oil, garlic and tomatoes.  I would definitely make this again!

I fixed this for a roomie dinner and it turned out really well. I added balsamic vinegar to the oil/garlic mixture and used mozzarella cheese instead of blue.

Fantastic appetizer, huge crowd pleaser, not time consuming at all. To save time, I used Trader Joe's bruschetta in a jar--LOVE that stuff--in place of the diced tomatoes--awesome flavor as it includes tomatoes, onion and some garlic. I also used goat cheese instead of blue, as another reviewer mentioned.
The next day, as I had bought more mushroom caps than I needed for my dinner party, I baked using the same format and did the following:
sauteed spinach on the botton, Costco veggie burger on top of that, then the mushroom cap as prepared above on top of the burger--perfection!! Trader Joe's also has a veggie burger (their Masala burger) that would work really well w/ the mushroom incorporated w/ it.

Not a huge fan, the flavors were all off. I made this to go with a blue cheese sauce for steaks. I would not make this again.

Took the advice of another reviewer and baked gills down for 5 minutes.  Spooned garlic and oil mixture over bottoms then flipped gills up and basted inside and edges. I also added a teaspoon of pesto on top of the diced tomato and used herbed goat cheese instead of blue cheese. Wonderful flavor and texture by itself or sliced over a salad.

This recipe is always a crowd pleaser.  I change it up and sometimes use goat cheese since not everyone likes blue cheese.  Either way is heavenly!

Was looking for a recipe to try as I got a portabello mushroom for the 1st time. Followed other reviews and, after brushing the bottom side with oil and garlic, baked it for 5 mins. Flipped it over, brushed gill side with garlic oil and topped with chopped grape tomatoes.  Baked for 8 mins then added blue cheese and Italian panko bread crumbs. Put back in until cheese melted and panko crispy. Wonderful, will buy more and serve to guests! Thank you!
