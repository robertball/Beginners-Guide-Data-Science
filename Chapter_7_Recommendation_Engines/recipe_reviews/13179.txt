This turned out great!  Here are my adjustments:  butter instead of oil, no garlic, no sugar (didn't even see it in the recipe until later, thank goodness), used 2 c. chicken broth and 2 c. milk, a couple of handfuls of cooked fine egg noodles.  For meat I used a large breast which I poached while making the soup.  I also added a couple of handfuls of frozen sweet corn and peas.  Sounds like a lot of adjustments but it was really just common sense.  Thanks, Holly, for the jumping off point.

I did not like this at all.  I think it was the sugar it was really sweet.

another good recipe that you may need to change a bit to suit your taste. i used one tablespoon sugar, 4 cups half and half, 2 minced garlic toes and 1 tablespoon fresh ground pepper. my sons and i ate this with a green salad and the south louisiana staple.....crusty french bread.

a previous reviewer gave this recipe one star but if you check her previous reviews you'll find that there is not much in this site that he/she likes.

Good, with the following changes:
Cooked the chicken, a large onion and two cloves of garlic in a couple T's of butter with poultry seasoning until softened, then removed from the pot and cooked the roux until the flour was light gold.  Added the milk and chicken mixture back in, then added some carrots and a few potatos.  A little tumeric and paprika gave it a wonderful gold color.  Omitted the sugar.  A creamy, filling, hearty soup that warms you up.

I made this to put into a chicken pot pie recipie but tasted it before I added it. It was very tasty. I used whole milk and only made enough for 2 servings. I would suggest adding steamed brocclli, oniions, and cheese if you like veggies.

Glad I read the review! NO SUGAR NEEDED! I used 3 T. of butter, 4 T. flour, 1 can of chicken broth and 1/2 c milk. Using it in an incredible chicken rice recipe--didn't want to waste gas going to store for one thing! Thanks for the starting point Holly, and thanks to others for advice!

I used butter instead of oil and I didn't use sugar and added a little bit of fresh chopped parsley. Also instead of 4 cups of milk I made it with 3 cups of milk and one cup chicken broth it was very good!! we all loved it! Simple and easy

I omitted the sugar, but otherwise kept the recipe the same. Mine came out very thin, so I added the cornstarch at the end. I would start out using the cornstarch in place of the flour next time. I used this in casseroles, and it tastes good.

I made this twice. Once as written and again with some changes. As written, this is too sweet and bland. Also too soupy. Not at all thick in the amount of cooking time listed. 

The second time I made some changes that improved the flavor and thickness. I boiled 2 chicken breasts and used 2 cups of the broth and 2 cups milk. I did not add sugar. I substituted the garlic and salt for one chicken boullion cube. I then simmered this over medium low for about an hour (until it reduced by half). I then added a little bit of cornstarch to thicken it a little more. 

If comparing this to the canned variety, with the changes I made this is very close. After reducing I only ended up with about 2 1/2 cups of finished soup.

This is a great recipe.  I have used it several times now for recipes calling for cream of chicken soup.  I only use 1tbs of the sugar and I always use one cube of chicken bullion.  It is so good!  Do not forget the garlic powder, it really adds a nice flavor.

I made the homemade cream of chicken soup for lunch, here are my adjustments; I had some leftover baked turkey, used it instead of chicken, used butter instead of oil, added a small onion, fresh chives and 1/4 clove of garlic.
Reduced sugar to 1 teaspoon.
It was delicious, will make it again.

I've always bought the canned soup for recipes, but after finding this recipe for homemade soup, I'll never go back to store bought again.  It's super economical, not to mention it tastes WAY better!   I did add a bouillon cube and left out the chicken.  I also subbed butter for the oil, and left out the sugar.  Delicious!

Love the flavor with the garlic.  I used olive oil instead of canola- much healthier.  Also I did not add the sugar.  It was delicious.  I tasted and loved the taste so I decided it did not need it.   I love this recipe because store bought stuff has msg in it.  Also this is much cheaper.  I also did not add the chicken and added 1/2 teas. sp. chicken bouillon.

I used this recipe as a base for a chicken and dumpling recipe from this site that called for canned cream of chicken soup.  I modified it a tad by subbing butter for oil, eliminated the sugar and the chicken, and used 3 cups milk and 4 cups chicken broth but I needed all that liquid for the other recipe that used a lot of chicken and biscuits.  So I am not sure how much liquid I used specifically from this recipe since I sort of combined the recipes but I did have to use cornstarch to thicken it some.  I'm rating it 5 stars because it is a great recipe versus the horrible processed canned soup with MSG and high sodium content.  I will definitely make this again every time a recipe calls for canned soup.  I am planning on making a different recipe (chicken and noodle casserole) using this recipe as a base for that too. My husband, toddler and I loved it.

Good substitute for canned soup. (especially in Central Asia where I can't get it!)I added more flour later, next time I would probably make it with 1-2 more tablespoons of flour from the start (and maybe another tablespoon of oil?) to make it the consistency of the condensed soup. substituted half of milk with chicken broth, didn't use garlic, salt or sugar. It was nice and thick, but half the recipe was not quite 2 cans-worth of soup.

The first time I made it, I wasn't very impressed by this recipe.  It was WAAAY too sweet and peppery, and didn't have enough of a chicken taste.  

I made it again, but the second time I only used half the sugar, half the pepper, and I substituted chicken buillion(sp?) granules for the salt.  Much better.

I used it to "help" the Weight Watchers soup recipe to be more tolerable and this was wonderful. It enriched a basic calorie concerned recipe a lot and was tasty on it's own too. Thanks much Holly!!

This was wonderful, with lots of scope for experimenting. My daughter is gluten-intolerant, so we can't use the canned stuff anymore.We'd still use this either way, as this was so tasty!

This recipe was great!  I used 2 chicken bouillon cubes instead of salt, I added in some onion powder, and would recommend leaving out the sugar.  This is also great with your leftover Thanksgiving turkey.

Great recipe to have, this tastes very good and keeps me from buying canned soup at the grocery store.  I mostly use this soup in recipes that call for any type of cream soup.  The only changes I made were that I used butter instead of oil to make the roux (same amount) and didn't add sugar.

Superb.  I made this almost exactly leaving out only the sugar.  I'm currently using it as an ingredient in another recipe it's so good (Baked Chicken Broccoli and Rice by Campbell's Kitchen) in place of the suggested Cream of Chicken and Broccoli Condensed Soup.  

My eldest daughter wanted me to add that this soup six stars out of five.  She's a "cream of ..." connousieur.  My husband is very impressed with the recipe as well and hopes to make it into our regular rotation.

Recommend cutting the sugar a bit, was a tad too sweet. I also added sauteed shallots, garlic, carrots and a few cooked potatoes chopped up.

Great recipe! I have started to make a big pot of this soup every other month and dividing it into recipe-sized portions and freezing it to use in future recipes. (if I make this recipe as listed it makes 2-3 cans worth). changes I made based on other reviewers' comments: used 2c chicken broth and 2c milk in place of all milk and reduce the sugar to 1-2tsp. I also add about 1/2tsp dried parsley flakes with the other seasonings. Once you make this in place of canned cream of chicken soup you will NEVER go back!!

Well I found myself out of the can of cream of chicken so I decided to make it myself. It was very simple but very bland. I did add a good amount of salt, pepper, garlic and some salt free season all type stuff. I would say this is a great base but if you want flavor be prepared to add lots of it your self. I did do the 1/2 milk 1/2 chicken broth, actually maybe if I didn't use the low sodium broth it may have helped. Thanks for the recipe!! It saved me from a trip to the store!

I haven't made it yet but noticed a lot of people saying they need to thicken it up with cornstarch........I would personally just add some potatoes to thicken it.........better than cornstarch

I didn’t use salt, so I scaled the sugar back a bit. Not because I’m wanting to change the taste or the Cook’s recipe, but because I can’t have sodium. Yummy. Thanks!
