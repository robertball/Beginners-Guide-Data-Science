This was so much better than I expected it to be! I don't usually make recipes that only have one review but I was on a strict dietary plan and this fit the bill so I decided to give it a try. I am so glad that I did! My sister and her roommate asked for the recipe and ended up making a double batch of the sauce the very next day so they could freeze some to use for meal prep. The only thing I did differently was roast the toin the oven because I didn't have access to a grill that day. Thank you

Fresh roasted vegetables are hard to beat. Putting them on top of zucchini spaghetti, well, that is just pure genius. No need to tweak here. A no brainer leads to a five-star meal. Thank you for the recipe.
