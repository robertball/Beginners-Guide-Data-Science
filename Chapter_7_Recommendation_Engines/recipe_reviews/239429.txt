These cookies were enjoyable to eat, there's nothing like chocolate cookies and milk. I didn't change anything in this recipe but if I make them again I don't think I would add the almond extract,it was for my taste very overpowering. The browny mix is full of flavor and then if you have to add any extra one vanilla extract makes more sense to me. For us the cookies were a little bit chewy and their appearance wasn't the best either.

This was a great quick and easy cookie. It was a chocolate overload. I definitely needed a glass of milk alongside this cookie. The kids and hubby loved them.

This was fairly easy to make and my kids had no problem finishing them off.  The dough was VERY stiff and  the cookies had to be flattened as they did not spread well for me.  I used up small quantities of walnuts, pecans and mini chocolate chips that were very good with the chocolate brownie flavor.  Good but not something I would make again.

I have made these a number of times. I use the Ghirardelli brownie mix and this time I added different kinds of chips to individual batches, butterscotch, caramel, chocolate. I added some sparkling sugar to the top to make them a little more festive. I used my KitchenAid standing mixer which made mixing the dough easy. My husband says they are the best chocolate cookies ever!

Easy. Easy. Easy. The chewy chocolate ness of a brownie with the convenience of a cookie. I didn't have enough chocolate chips so I used half white and half chocolate.  Instant hit with my 13 year old son!  Will definitely be making these again.

I really liked this recipe, I took the cookies out of the oven two minutes before because the first batch I made the bottoms of the cookie were kind of hard, so when I took them out a couple minutes early they turned out perfect. The dough was really thick and really delicious. I will be making these again.

These cookies did not turn out very well for me. Flat as a pancake.  After one sheet pan went flat, I put the rest of the batter in a small stoneware pan and baked like brownies.

This is a solid 4-star recipe. My DH and mom thought they were delicious. They are moist and chewy and have kept well for a few days now. I used Ghirardelli triple chocolate brownie mix, so I didn't need to add additional chips. I did add some slivered almonds, and thought that went well with the almond extract. I also made some without nuts, and I would leave out the almond extract if I made them plain again. When you're mixing, you start to wonder if it will all come togehter, but it does, and the dough is then very easy to work with.

These cookies are really yummy.  I made two batches, one with a mix of chocolate and white chocolate chips, and one with a mix of chocolate and peanut butter chips.  Both versions were great.  The batter does become very tough to mix so you really need to use some muscles to get the chips mixed in evenly.

This is such an easy, quick, and delicious cookie. I used 1/2 white chocolate and 1/2 semi-sweet chocolate chips. I'll keep a box of brownie mix on hand for when my sweet tooth wins over!

They look like melted brownies and they taste great. We used Peanut M&M's instead of chocolate chips and left out the almond extract. Kids were very happy.

Using a box mix makes this quick and easy to make.  I divided the batter in half and added white chocolate chips to half and peanut butter chips to the other half.  My sons and their friends ate these up quickly.  They liked both kinds but preferred the ones with the peanut butter chips.

I don’t normally use mixes, but this gives you a quick head start in making some chewy chocolate cookies.  I made the recipe as written, but if you’re like me and not a fan of almond extract, I would omit it because it is more noticeable in the flavor than I would have liked.

Turned out great! Batter IS really stiff and once white chocolate chips were incorporated, I used a cookie scoop (about a TBS size ) then baked as written. Turned out soft and chewy..yum! Since it is Christmas time, I melted peppermint baking chips and spooned on top. Probably better to drizzle. I' m sure they will fly off the plate!! Thank you for the recipe!

Easy and delicious! Was looking for a quick way to get some cookies made for the kids out playing and had these ready in just minutes. Only added vanilla extract, not the other extract and used about a 1/2 cup egg whites in place of the 2 eggs and they came out perfect. Thx , this is a keeper!

Great, quick recipe for cookies. These were a beast to mix, you could definitely tell you were using brownie batter. But the taste was very good. We used half chocolate chips and half peanut butter chips. I also used some Mexican Vanilla in place of the regular Vanilla (and doubled what it called for per other ratings on this.) We'll definitely make these again and experience with various extracts and chips :D
