I was so disappointed with this recipe.  I followed the directions, and after it baked I let it sit for about 15 minutes.  Then I turned it out onto a serving plate, and the pudding was not set, and in turn ended up all over my counter and kitchen floor!  I ended up with no dessert for my card club, because there was no more time to make anything else.

This is a great cake.  It's easy to make and a welcome change from breads or pies.  I can't wait to serve it to my friends.

This was very tasty but I wondered about reversing the order of cake on the bottom, filling, then pudding on the top.
It wasn't a cake that could be served nicely.
I also try to substitute brown sugar for white, wondered if anyone has tried that.
Otherwise, it is a good combination of ingrediants.

I think this cake has some potential. I didn't have a 9 in square baking pan so I used a 9 X 11. I think I could have used more rhubarb. It did start to cook over a little in the oven. I also didn't turn it over when I was done baking it. I just scooped the pudding mixture on top of the cake when we ate it. It tasted good. A little messy though.

Really a WASTE.  Pudding mix went all over the counter.  Had to throw it all away.  I followed the recipe to the tee.

I found this recipe looking for something to use some of my moms fresh rhubarb. I almost didn't make it after reading some of the comments, but decided to give it a shot anyway. It turned out alright, but I did not flip it out of the pan and just served it in bowls almost like dumplings but dessert. I also think it was a bit bland, all I tasted was vanilla. Maybe there should be some more rhubarb or another kind of fruit such as strawberries added to it.

I have made this cake several times and it's always a hit!  The only issue I had is that I've had to use a larger baking dish (or less cake mix - bake separately and use extra pudding sauce to drizzle) and check carefully to make sure the center of the cake is done.  One trick I use for turning it out is to bake it in a 9" deep sided pie dish and use a fancier pie plate with a larger circumference for serving.
