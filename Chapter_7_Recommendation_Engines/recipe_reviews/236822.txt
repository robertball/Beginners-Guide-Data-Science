Came out light and fluffy!  I used one egg white and one whole egg.  Added some salt, pepper and garlic powder to the flour.  And used club soda instead of water.

This is pretty good, using just egg whites does make for a lighter batter.  I would suggest using Club Soda instead of cold water - that makes for an even lighter batter.

Made exactly as the recipe. Puffed up nicely on the onion rings and fish I made but was very light in color and bland tasting. Ended up adding one yolk for a double batch and that helped along with some basic spices to liven the taste up.

Way better than the box, which I usually use, and much less expensive, too!

This was easy & fantastic! I used it for fish tacos. Light, crispy and not at all over-bearing. Didn't change a thing.

Turned out great!  But can be improved with a few spices in the dry batter. I added Old Bay Seasoning and it made it better for my taste.  Thanks!

Using egg whites made a light, crunchy batter. The first batch I made exactly to the recipe, but it needed seasoning. Second batch, I added Original Mrs Dash....delish!

Substituted club soda for the water as others suggested. The coating was a little bland.  Next time I will add a little garlic salt. Will make again.

Delicious!! I have a severe food allergy so we make sushi & tempura at home, this was the lightest batter. I used club soda instead of water. Definitely a keeper!! Will make this again soon!

Just made this. Used light beer instead of water, but that was the only deviation from the posted recipe. Used it to coat raddish, red onion, green bell pepper, and chunks of chicken thighs. So light and crispy! Only personal issue was that the veggies could have used a pinch of salt. Chicken was tossed in General Tso sauce. Thanks for sharing!

Nice light batter that gets nice and crispy. I did have to add a bit of extra water to thin it a little.
Batter itself is very plain.
Was very good with parmasean cheese added

It turned out wonderfully. I’ve made this twice now. I like using The cooks Note and used Club Soda. So far my 1st go round, I made General Tso’s Chicken. Tonight I played and made Chicken Fingers & Funnel Cakes! IYummy ?? Lived it all!  used Cinnamon & Sugar on some & Confectioners Sugar on the Funnel Cakes. Thanks for sharing an easy peasy recipe! I’ll use this a bunch

Easy to follow directions cheaper then the box brands .
I would suggest either seasoning your shrimp or the batter. I did both and it was awesime!

I, also, made it with the club soda. It was perfect. I used it on fish. It could use  more flavor.  Any ideas other than garlic powder?

I love tempura batter on my veggies and chicken, sadly this was a bit to thick and reminded me of fried dough.
I think next time I am going to use Club Soda  instead of water to give my batter a different kick.

Thank You for this awesome recipe, I loved it! I made it and it came out perfectly  :)

I didn't have any sparkling water but  I had waterloo watermelon sparkling water, I used that and it made it light and fluffy!

Almost perfect. but what is lacking is too important to give it 3 or 4 stars. 

The texture and lightness are perfect. The colour is light, and does not get too dark. So looks and texture are perfect.

But... this is bland, with a capital B. Unless you are drenching it in sauce, it just tastes like flour.  

I reccomend adding 1 Tablespoon of Shoyu Soya Sauce to the water, as well  as a 1/4 teaspoon of Sriracha.  this made all tu2 difference!

Came out great though I agree that it could use some seasoning. Also it was a bit soft, not that crystalline snap restaurants give you. Not sure if that’s because I over mixed or something.

Loved the batter, was light in color but puffed us just right. Followed the recipe but added salt and pepper to the batter for fired green tomatoes. Did not dip in cornstarch before batter and it worked great. Also, used to fry turbot fish stakes - fantastic!

I used this with shrimp and carrots. Came out realtively soft and not very crunchy like classic tempura. The recipe is very bland - you will at least need to add salt.  next time I would try adding 1 tbsp cornstarch and seltzer water instead of cold water to help to make it more crunchy and light.

This was litterally the most disgusting thing I’ve ever made. And most people in the comments pretty much suggest completely changing the recipe. Find another recipe.
Sincerely,
   I wasted 45 minutes of my night.

I whipped 2 egg whites, I didn’t have seltzer or club soda as others suggested so I combined a mix of water and ginger ale with the flour first and then slowly whipped it into the egg whites. Soooo fluffy. It covered 2 medium flounder fillets, a medium sliced onion and 1 cup of cubed butternut squash. I didn’t add any seasoning to the mix but I put a blend into the first layer of dry flour cover.  Sprinkled salt as it came out of fryer.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I sliced up some sweet potato and little florets of broccoli.  I then did some shrimp and it was delicious.  I did add some salt to the batter and it was perfect according to my picky husband.  We dipped into some hot sweet chili sauce and it was superb.  I did do the one whole egg and one egg white.  I mixed that in the blender and then added the water and flour.  Perfect texture.  Thanks for the great little, simple recipe.

It was awesome...I did make a few changes. I used one whole egg and 1 egg white. I added hot sauce and vinegar instead of water. It was delicious. I have made it 3 times thus far. I will definitely make this again.

I'd been looking for a while for a good batter for fried foods. I like that this one doesn't have any extra seasoning or spices. This will be one of my go to recipes.

Good, but needs spices and needs to be thinner for crisper crust.

A good cooking trick with this recipe is to substitute the water for club soda instead. This makes the batter lighter and more airy in consistency. Just perfect!

I have used this recipe twice now both for sweet and sour chicken. I always use club soda instead of water. And this needs salt, pepper and some herbs for the taste. Very easy to whip up.

I made it. while reading the recipe I noticed it had no seasoning so I added salt  pepper and herbs. it was also pretty thick so I added a little more water. I used my deep fryer and my veggies stuck to the bottom of the fryer and had to pry them loose (very dangerous). I'll try a different recipe next time.

Very chalky and WAY too thick, we had to almost double the wasted so it would coat.

Perfect and so easy!  Very light batter.  I didn't have club soda on hand to try like other reviewers did but I might try it next time- it was great as written!

love this recipe and my picky child who needs to gain a little weight loves it too! I see why some of the other reviews aren't great. They do leak a bit and they are not like fried cheese sticks. Try not to expect them to turn out like fried cheese sticks and you will love them. These can be easily reshaped after baking. If you want the breading to turn out thicker, try using a tempora batter instead. You would probably need to bake them a tad longer. That is what I will try next for the heck of it but I will definitely make these per the recipe again. Way healthier option especially if you use all organic ingredients.
