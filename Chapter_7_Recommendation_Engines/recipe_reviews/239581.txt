My favorite bakery item. I truly enjoyed making this. I added a little chocolate to the batter to form a swirl pattern and of course, I had to do a little more with the topping. My guests loved it!!!!!!

It was ok. Made this for a birthday dinner for my family. It looked great, but NO one but my 6 year old granddaughter liked the topping of toasted marshmallows. May change that next time.
