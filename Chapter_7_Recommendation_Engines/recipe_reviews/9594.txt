This recipe makes a ton of cookies! They are a very pretty, humble cookie, not too sweet or rich,with kind of a sandy texture because of the oil/cream of tartar.  Couldn't try one myself since I gave up sweets for Lent, but Hubs said these were a "mature cookie," and his staff said they took Rice Krispies to a new level, with the walnuts adding a nice crunch. Update 10-23-13 from my original Feb. 2008 review: I made these again today and this time it's not during Lent!  Oh my goodness, what a cookie. It's bakery-style pretty first of all, though I made them bakery-style size!  The cookie is buttery, light, tender and a little crispy. They have lots of texture and lots of flavor from the oatmeal, nuts, coconut and Rice Krisipies.  I waited far too long to make these a second time!

recipe is big & economical but the taste is nothing to write home about (Wanted to add this update. I made 12 doz of these cookies in 2 hours. I wrote the first sentence after the first couple of batches came out of the oven. After a bit I started varying things and by taking out the cookies while they were still quite light in color, they were much tastier. So either my oven runs hot or the recipe has them in for too long BUT if you don't overcook them these ARE a decent cookie and you can make A LOT FAST and PRETTY CHEAP!) Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I love this recipe and have adapted it.  We use the basic ingredients then add a cup of anything we have on hand, like chocolate chips, raisins and m$m's.  It is easy for the younger children to participate in and makes plenty for school parties!! Definitely a keeper!

The bake time really does make a difference with these cookies.  The best batch was in for 11 minutes.  I thought they might be a little under baked, but after sitting for a few minutes they were quite good.  I tossed the first batch that baked for 15 minutes - way too long for these cookies I found.  The texture is good and chocolate chips add a nice sweetness that the cookie seems to lack otherwise.  Not my favorite, but a decent cookie and a hit with the kids.

I usually am not big on cookies, but these are fantastic. I love the succulent flavor the butter brings and the different textures of the coconut, cereal, oats, and nuts. I make 'monster' size cookies with this recipe for 4 doz total, and after my 3 batch or so have started using double strength vanilla. Great cookies! Thanks for Sharing!

I think these are great! I'm making them as I type. The kids are going to love these! I omitted the walnuts and added an extra cup of rice cereal, as we aren't big nut fans. Fabulous recipe!  Thanks!

The submitter says 'lots of cookies' - she is correct.  I used my 1 TB cookie scoop and got 121 cookies from a single batch.  Plenty to share with many people!  Everyone who tried these cookies loved them.  They are crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  The crisp rice cereal give the cookies a great texture.  I subbed sliced almonds for the walnuts, as that is what I had on hand.  I baked one tray without nuts for my son and then added the nuts to the remaining batter.  The batter is very soft, in fact, I thought I had missed a cup of flour, so I did a test bake.  They came out perfect, so it is just a soft batter, not the cook!  A really good recipe, especially if you need a lot of cookies.

Just made these. Chewy, yet crisp edges. wonderful flavor. Butter/ brown sugar create a butterscotch flavor. These will be added to my recipe box for future dates.

Taste is great but not a fan of the consistency. Daughter loves them. I halved the recipe & using my regular cookie scoop, got 24 cookies.

Such a great recipe. I used pecans instead of walnuts and added 1/2 cup raisins 1/2 cup cranberries and cup of chocolate chips. So delicious. My whole family and coworkers devoured them in just 2 days.
