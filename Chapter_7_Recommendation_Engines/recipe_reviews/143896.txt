This was pretty tasty.  I used a whole egg.  Very juicy and lots of flavor.

This is an excellent burger!  I love the idea of putting the mushrooms inside instead of on top.  I used 1.5 lbs of beef and raised the other ingredients accordingly.  I used the entire egg.  That made 6 large "1/3" lb burgers.  I grilled them outside but put down one of those trays used for cooking fish or veggies on a grill.  They turned out juicy and very delicious.  Thanks!

Used ground sirloin--it was on sale. Mushrooms, onions and garlic went for a spin in the food processor and then added to the meat and mixed with rest of ingredients. Mushroom haters never noticed. Burgers were moist and flavorful. Definite keeper

I made these on my griddle and they were fantastic! Had these with mayo and ketchup and served on sesame rolls, and used sliced portabello mushrooms (my favorite!). Very flavorful, and I would recommend these to any mushroom burger lover.

Very good. I made my burgers with ground turkey and cooked them on the grill. I would use 1/4 onion next time and 2 cloves of garlic instead of 3. I also used toasted whole wheat english muffins as a bun. This recipe made a great healthy burger.

I didn't thaw the hamburger ahead of time so I just fried the hamburger and added all of the other ingredients except the egg.  We served these on a bun with tomato and cheese.  Very good!

I love mushrooms!! I made this burger with the burger pocket press except I did not mix the ingredients in the meat, but put them in-between the patties to make a stuffed burger. What a taste!

I thought it was going to be too crumbly -- but when I put the piece of swiss on top it kept the whole burger together nicely!
GREAT flavor.  I like this better than the mushroom topped Swiss Burger because this way the kids are SURE to eat the mushrooms, too!
:D

Yummy and moist! I absolutely hate dry hamburgers, but these are quite moist and very tasty. I added a dash of worcestershire sauce and soy sauce and topped them with chipotle jack cheese and served them on grilled wheat bread. Will definately make again!!!! The next time I might try adding a bit of chopped jalapeno pepper.

This recipe was so full of flavor.  LOVED IT!  I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used the canned kind.  I also added some worchestshire sauce to the mix.  I will make this again.

Made these using ground buffalo - first time cooking with it and I loved it!  I had been told buffalo is leaner than beef so it can dry out if overcooked - the mushrooms and egg white eliminated that problem.  I used cheddar cheese (had on hand).  Will make this again!  Thanks for sharing!

I subbed 1 can of shrooms and used ground turkey instead of beef and they were still fabulous. The mushrooms gave the burgers a very rich flavor. Will definitely make them again. Great with dijon mustard and sliced red onion. Served with grilled veggies and pasta salad.

Yummy! I doubled the mushrooms and used an entire egg instead. On hindsight, should not have doubled mushrooms in the burger as it made them a little crumbly. Next time, I would saute the extra mushrooms, place them on top of the burgers and top with the swiss cheese just before the burgers are done. A real easy to put together recipe with great tastes!

These are some really good burgers!  And so ridiculously easy to throw together.  I used a whole egg and it was fine.  We will definitely have these again!

These burgers were awesome!! I was a little nervous about adding the egg yolk but the burgers were moist and flavorful. I followed the recipe but also added a splash of soy sauce and a splash of worcesteshire. YUM!

Followed the recipe aside from using the whole egg, forgetting to pepper the outside of the burger, mixing some shredded swiss into the meat (we didn't have slices), and cooking on the grill.  Great burgers.

This burger was moist & tasty! My spouse commented twice about how good they were & even suggested making a meatloaf out of it - he usually isn't fond of meatloaf. Didn't have Swiss cheese so used Dubliner cheddar instead, also added a tomato slice & some mustard. This one is a keeper.
