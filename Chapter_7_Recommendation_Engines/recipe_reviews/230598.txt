This is an EXCELLENT recipe! I added a little salt but that is all I did differently. The dough was very easy to handle and I believe this will become a go to recipe for sugar cookies.

Did not like this recipe at all. The cookies were not sweet nor did they have a good flavour. Very disappointing. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

I did not care for this recipe. Even after adding plenty of extra sugar these were not sweet at all. The dough was difficult to work with and did not come out looking nice.

My cookies didn't look like the previous baker's photo! Mine turned out very puffy and were done in 8 minutes--they would have burned in the stated 12 minutes. I knew these cookies were going to be cakey but I felt that there wasn't enough flavor to the cookie itself---they relied too much on the frosting to make them tasty. I kept going over the recipe to make sure I'd done it correctly too. Sorry about this review sounding negative. I love cookies!
