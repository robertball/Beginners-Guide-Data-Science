this is a good start on the recipe.  I had this dish while in the Bahamas and closely watched the ingredients that were added.  Instead of using just lemon juice, they squeezed some fresh orange juice into the ceviche.  No water was added.  I use some fresh cilantro and serrano peppers to give it a kick.  (Jalepenos don't do it justice).  You can add mangoes to the recipe instead of pineapples, and it turns out great!  Also, I've substituted shrimp instead of the conch which people love!  and instead of using large tomatoes, I use a couple smaller roma tomatoes.

This is a great recipe, but as weird as it sounds, we subbed cucumbers for the pineapple and loved this! Thanks so much!

Great recipe, but when I tasted it, I was a bit heavy on the cilantro. I did what others have suggested, slicing paper thin hot peppers, I used Jalepeno because that Is what I had. I also added 1 tablespoon of lime juice and a dash of seafood magic to pep it up.

Would have been better without the conch. It added nothing.
