This was very tasty. Similar to another salad I make in the summer. This dressing I thought was better than using a premade poppy seed dressing. I cut the sugar to only 2 tbls and it was still plenty sweet. I added walnuts as well.

This is great; I just made it for the second time for an Easter lunch. I do find it too sweet, though, so this time I've cut the sugar a little. My suggestion is to add the sugar last and do it to taste. Also, if you don't have to have quite so many poppyseeds if you don't have them. 1 Tbs. would be plenty. Thanks for a great recipe!

We LOVED this salad!!!  I didn't have poppy seeds on hand. The dressing would've looked pretty with them in. Added some chopped pecans for crunch.

Loved the dressing used 1/2 of the sugar called for and it is still very sweet.

did everything as instructed with the exception of reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup and this was a wonderful salad! would have definitely been too sweet with more sugar.

Kinda of wish I'd liked this more.  The dressing is good, but not unique; as with other sweet mayo/red wine vinegar dressings I've tried, I didn't even come close to using the called-for amount of sugar.  (Normally I do try to follow recipes as written, but I also know our tastes.)  My husband and I agreed that we sort of wished there were something else in the salad, but neither of us knew what; with such a creamy dressing, cheese would be redundant, and nuts didn't quite seem right.  Cucumber maybe, or apple?  Anyway, this is totally fine and made for a nice change, but I doubt we'll make it again.  Thanks anyway!

Made this according to directions except cut the poppy seeds in half, and it was wonderful. The dressing was a hit, and the flavor of the salad was very pleasing.

Great, but if you don't want to make the dressing, try "Brianna's Home Style Blush wine" dressing.  It is a perfect complement and probably has similar ingredients.  I use romaine because I prefer the crispness, but the combination of red onions and strawberries is fantastic.

This salad is sooo good!  Yes, the dressing is sweet (which I love).  I am going to use the leftover dressing on another salad (maybe with a little chicken) tonight.  Thank you for this recipe!

I decided to try this with having a surplus of strawberries right now, and I was surprised at how good it was!  I made it exactly as written - and my whole family (hubby & 2 picky kids) really liked it.  Next time I will use maybe one onion slice per salad though as it was just too much for us all.

Wow! This was really good. Used apple vinegar instead of what was stated and reduced the amount of sugar. Will definitely make again.

It was a hit - didn't change a thing.  Update:  If you are watching calories you might want to switch to this one.  I've made so many of the strawberry spinach salads from this site and love them but I'm using this one now because of the calories (or lack of them).  I even halved the sugar in this and used raspberry vinegar and it is still wonderfully sweet.  Thanks submitter.

Sounded weird but it was Valentine's day & it seemed appropriate so I gave it a whirl....I am soooo very glad I tried it. Wonderful flavors that complement each other perfectly. I didn't change a thing other than proportions scaled down for two! The dressing is very good on it's own too.

Great Recipe...I will definately make this again.  I used a poppyseed dressing, and it was terrific.  Strawberrys and Onions don't seem to go together, but they do...if you leave out one ingredient or the other, it just doesn't taste as good.

Excellent. I brought this to a picnic yesterday and there wasn't a crumb left. I like a little crunch in my salad, so I added toasted almond slivers. Yumm!

I tried this recipe and really enjoyed it.  I did add some ingredients to turn up the volume to include blueberries and goat cheese.  Because I had all the ingredients on hand and needed to use them before spoiling, it created a delicious salad which can be a staple in my 
repertoire!

Didn't make this in individual bowls as recipe called for, put into a decorative glass serving bowl, and tossed 1/2 of the onion and strawberries into the lettuce, and put the other 1/2 on top. Made the dressing about 4 hours before eating, and drizzled over right before serving. Think this is a "girls" salad, because we had 4 couples and the women thought it was great, and the guys all did definitely not like. The description of the recipe was right on though, it sounds really gross when you see the ingredients, but you have to try to see how good it tastes. Tasted fine the 2nd day also.

This was very tasty, but also a little too sweet for our family.  Next time I would add about 1/2 as much sugar.

Added toasted pecans. Pretty presentation. Just used regular spring salad mix. Reminds me greatly of some other strawberry salads from this site.
