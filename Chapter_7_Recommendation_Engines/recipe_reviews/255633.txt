Ive made the cauliflower crust a few times. I added a little paremesean cheese to it ( like1 to 2 Tb) when I mix it and usually just use the egg white. One of the keys I found to making a pizza like crust , besides draining it well, is to bake it on BOTH sides. I put it on the baking sheet on the parchment, pat it into a thin round, then bake it about 8 to 10 minutes till the bottom is golden. Then I flip it over, add the pizza sauce, more mozzerrella and the toppings and then  pop it back in the oven till the other side is golden and the cheese is melted.  You  have to bake both sides of the crust to get the pizza crust texture you want. I love it. It has a really good taste.  I've been making it about once a week. (Ps I use a fine mesh  laundry bag to drain my cauliflower- it works excellent)

I bought a bag of cauliflower rice in the frozen vegetable aisle and it worked, I just microwaved it, mixed the ingredients together and spread it on the pan and cooked it.

Great alternative to regular pizza crust. I did not cook my cauliflower,  I 'riced' it and then added the rest of the ingredients. I used fresh basil, 1/2 mozzarella and 1/2 parmesan, added fresh garlic and red pepper flakes. Will make again.

Oh my goodness! This is delicious and filling! I have a tofu press so I wrapped the cauliflower rice in cheesecloth and pressed it for 15 minutes. Came out nice and dry. Whipped it up and put into a well-greased 9 inch pie pan.  (non-stick cooking spray) Baked in my convection oven for 30 minutes (I think I will lower that to 20-25 next time), added sauce and toppings. Hubby looked at it and told me he didn't think it would be enough for us but we had it with a big Caesar salad and we are both so full! I couldn't finish my portion so I only had a piece and a half as we had divided the pie sized pizza into quarters. DELICIOUS! Side note: look up the "exquisite pizza sauce recipe" here on all recipes and make it with only 1tsp sugar or you can substitute some or all of the water in that with carrot juice for a more carb-friendly sauce.

This was a very delicious recipe.  Couldn't tell it was cauliflower at all.  My daughter devoured it before asking what it was. Even after finding out it was cauliflower, she asked for me to make it again!   Total hit!

Grated cauliflower to "rice" size, worked great, worked really hard to get the liquid out. Since I don't have a food processor was very time consuming / will try steaming and passing through my potato ricer next time. Only addition was one clove garlic finely minced. Used a pre shredded cheese, next time will pour the cheese out and chop a little finer first. Also, am going to brush top of crust with a fine layer of garlic infused olive oil next time after initial bake, and give it an extra few minutes before adding the toppings.

But I did not boil cauliflower, I did it in a skillet on low not browning it. No oil or water need. Much easier to dry it out.

I loved it, I didn't use a processor.  I just chopped up the tops, boiled, and squeezed extra hard with a cheesecloth into a mush.

Sauté the cauliflower!   This is an excellent tasting recipe, but you don’t know have to wring out the cauliflower.  I used a bag of “riced” cauliflower, sprayed a skillet with pam, added some onions, garlic, salt and oregano and cooked on medium until soft (10-15mins).  Stir often.  No need to remove moisture, follow the rest of the recipe as written

A great gluten free option for pizza crust.
Added 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese too. 
A good feeling to eat pizza with a bit less guilt.

We did not cook the cauliflower prior to mixing with the other ingredients, and it turned out just fine. This is a great, gluten free alternative pizza crust. We will put this in our favorites.

Didn't work. It tastes like egg which isn't that bad with the cheese and oregano. It has been cooking for 90 minutes now and is still way too soft for my liking.  That is after using an entire roll of paper towels to dry the cauliflower. Using a dish towel would have left lint. Looks like it will just be hot wings for dinner tonight. Will not try again.

I used a food processor and then put the bowl of cauliflower in the microwave 4-5 minutes (depending on its wattage). No wringing necessary.  15 minutes without toppings, turn it over, cook another 5 and add you’re toppings returning it to the oven. Easy and tasty.

My husband made this the other night I am not a fan of Califlower what so ever, But I tell you what this along with the home made Pizza Sauce was Very delicious. He used Chesse cloth instead of the towel that is recommend in the recipe. To roll the dough out he made it into a ball placed it on the parchment paper, place cheese cloth over it and rolled out onto pizza pan and he removed cloth and placed it in oven. The prep time takes a little more time but it’s Totally Worth It Very  it !! Definitely going to make this again.

I really didn’t like this at all. I might as well have riced the cauliflower and stopped there. Won’t be trying this again.

Love this recipe. I’ve made it a few times now. The suggestion of adding spinach to the mixture is a great one!!! I will make it again and again. And I will make my own pizza sauce. Thanks for the recipe. ??????

I did not tell my hubby that it was cauliflower only.  He was super impressed.  I really liked it and am happy to have an alternative for my celiac friends   I only gave it four because while it is good I still prefer wheat. Also to get enough crunch I flipped the crust before.  topping it.   Kind of a fussy thing to do to make a good pizza

I made a double batch. I added granulated garlic, and did not add salt. My family thought it was a delicious substitute for wheat crust.

Yes, yes, yes, I made changes, so don't complain!  The changes: sprinkling garlic powder, dried basil (didn't have fresh), and maybe a 1/4 teaspoon of fennel seeds onto the crust;  I pressed it out closer to 1/4 inch thick, rather the 1/2 thick, in hopes of getting a crisper crust.  Okay, that's it for changes.  I cooked it for about 25 minutes and then added the toppings for an additional 10 minutes.  The edges were very brown, and it tasted very much like a regular crust.  It was still a knife and fork pizza, rather than a pick-it-up pizza, but really good.  I'm now experimenting with the next batch to see if I can freeze it for later use.  (Let the cauliflower cool in its tea towel for ten minutes before you squeeze it or you may burn your fingers.  Me? Of course that didn't happen to me!)

The pepperoni and cheese was melted and tasty, the crust was not. Not worth the effort

Negative with this crust is that it is not crisp, but very wimpy. Won't be trying it again.

Getting as much moisture out is important. Bottom of pizza was to “soggy” not get crispy. Very good flavor and definitely will make again. I will try another’s review and just rice the cauliflower, not cook it.

it turned out great. followed recipe exactly. Next time will cook it a bit longer, or make it a bit thinner. Will definitely make it again.

Loved it. I used already riced frozen cauliflower which cuts down on prep time and when microwaved saves on not being so wet! I used cheddar cheese in crust for more flavor. Easy and so good!

I made it as written and topped it with veggies and cheese. It was better than I expected and I would make it again!
It was my first cauliflower crust attempt!

To really make this crust stick together like a pizza crust, you have to add some kind of flour also (gluten free or regular) Even Ophrah's pizza crust with Cauliflower has flour in it.

I had Cauliflower already riced so...  
made the first try with
 2C riced Cauliflower cooked until mush, then drained and squeezed the water out
1 egg
1/2C mozzarella cheese
pinch of salt
mixed above ingredients and placed on parchment paper coated with cooking spray
used another piece of parchment paper (sprayed lightly) on top and rolled it out on a 9X12 cookie sheet
Cooked at 400 (remove the top parchment paper) until the top started to brown
Ad the stuff that you like and cook at 400 until the cheese is melted. 
Turned out good but very very thin. Good Recipe!

This is usually the only pizza crust I make.  I like the taste of it.  It's just so soggy though.  Not  like the real thing, but it works.

This satisfies my husband's taste for pizza without all the carbs. It's great straight from the oven, but not as tasty warmed up the next day.
