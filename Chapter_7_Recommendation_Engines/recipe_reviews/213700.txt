Sooooo good! and easy to prepare. One suggestion broil the tomatillos and garlic instead of doing it on the griddle it only takes a couple min. also if you want to cut calories cook your tortillas with cooking spray on a hot pan, to me they still taste like they've been deep fried. Gracias Gema! Elvira S.

This comports with my own recipe and is obviously authentic because it calls for CORN tortillas (NOT flour!), cotija cheese, and crema ("not sour cream").  If you cannot find cotija cheese and cream at your market, substitute mild parmesan for the former and for the crema, try this: Put a tablespoon of plain yogurt in a cup of milk and let sit for 24 hours.  It works!

Wow! Better than any dish we have had in a mexican restaurant for sure. I will say that this recipe is a lot of work to prepare as well as to gather the ingredients. We live in a small town and I had to go to several stores in order to find the peppers and the 2 cheeses. I finally located the cheeses at a mexican store. Since there were no instructions to seed the chilis, I used them with the seeds which made the sauce extremely HOT and although the crema helped offset the heat, they are too hot for children or sensitive adults. My husband loved them so much that he is willing to help make them in the future which is a miracle in itself since he does NOT cook. I will definetly make them in the future and will also double the recipe and serve to company. I wouldn't change any of the ingredients or add a thing. This recipe is fantastic as is and believe me, the extra work was well worth it!

Fantastic! The recipe itself is nice and simple, and the taste is very authentic. I made this as written except I broiled my tomatillos, garlic and peppers in the oven, removing each as they blackened - just thought it was easier. This sauce also has the potential to be a bit salty for me - I cut the amount of bouillon in half and was thrilled with the outcome, so you may want to start with 2 tsp and go up to your taste when the sauce is done.  Also note that serranos are spicy, so 1 or 2 will do if you are a heat sensitive - I'm not, so 3 was perfect.  Excellent, easy recipe. Thanks!

This is a keeper! I had only tried something as good in Mexico City. I used table cream (media crema) which tastes more like the real Mexican cream. To save myself some calories, I brushed both sizes of the tortillas with olive oil and baked them for 5 to 10 minutes at 350 degrees. The meal was a total success. My neighbors could't have enough. I would definitely make it again and again.

All 4 of my grandparents were born and raised in Jalisco, Mexico. I know authentic Mexican and this recipe is authentic. It is a very time consuming recipe but worth it. My family has always de-seeded their peppers after toasting them on a cast iron griddle or "comal".  Cotija is a dry salty cheese. I find Greek Feta to be as salty and crumbly as Cotija - and neither melts. Sometimes I see Mexican Crema in small cans that look similar to Eagle Brand Condensed Milk.Crema is thick but pourable unlike sour cream. You can make crema by simply adding about two teaspoons of buttermilk to one cup of heavy cream and heating it to just about 100Â° (use a food thermometer). Remove from the heat and let stand in a warm spot overnight. When it has thickened slightly, stir gently and refrigerate until thoroughly chilled and thickened.

These were the best chicken enchiladas I've had in a long time. I won't be ordering them in restaurants, as these are better - I'll be making them myself! The sauce was so yummy, and so simple to make. Gema is right, light on the cream and cheese brings the flavors of the sauce out. And I love using the deli roasted chicken, makes it very easy!

This has got to be one of the best mexican recipes that I have ever tried and I live in Texas and eat Tex-Mex often.  I made it exactly as the recipe suggested, found the cheese at the local grocery store, HEB.  My teenage daughter has claimed the last two and put them up to take for lunch tomorrow; her favorite part?  The cilantro.  She says it brings out the other flavors. 11-1-2010 Tried the recipe with tofu that was scrambled in a frying pan with chili powder, salt and cumin powder.  It was wonderful!!
12-3-2010 I have made this 3 more times now.  I definitely recommend adding sauce to the chicken in the enchilada before rolling it up.  The sauce is the best part!  We tried this one time without the cilantro and it just wasn't as good.  All of the ingredients are important to the final taste.  We ran out of cotija cheese on the last batch and substituted parmesan cheese; it worked very nicely.7-5-2011We were in a hurry and tried this with a bottled green sauce, it just wasn't very good.  The sauce in this recipe really is the star of the show.  We have also found that 2 serrano peppers work as well as 2 jalapeno peppers. 7-12-15 This has become a go-to for my family. Changes: boil a chicken & use broth to make the sauce; broil veggies to save time; make blue tortillas instead of store bought. These things are time consuming, but make for a really awesome tasting product.

I'm always a fan of doing as much as I can myself to make it more authentic. I buy a whole chicken and boil it. I season it with garlic, salt and onion. After the chicken is boiled let it cool down and then clean it and place all the chicken in a bowl. SAVE THE BROTH!

Once you do that DOUBLE THE SAUCE!! I really only double the tomatillos and keep around 3-5 serrano peppers. I personally like to boil the tomatillos and peppers but you can also broil them in the oven for a great taste too (cut in half and place the skin side up until browned).

Let the tomatillos and peppers cool down a little and then you want to place into a blender, it usually takes two batches to do this for me. Now, place half of the tomatillos, serranos, cilantro, 1 cup of the chicken broth you just saved!, and half of a white onion. Blend to liquid and place in a sauce pan. Season with salt to taste.

Making it this way is uhmayzing! I do it all the time and it's how the Mexican side of my family taught me how to make it. If you can buy from a local tortilla shop, you're already much better off than you could be with the store brands. I like the white corn but it's up to you. When you cook the tortillas in oil, it is SOO much easier having someone else help you. I also like to add Queso Fresco cheese inside the enchiladas. We like to make a line where my mom does the tortillas and soaks the oil on the side and then places them in the sauce for me to fill. Cover enchiladas with sauce and 350 for 30 min!

Right on, Gema - these enchiladas are absolutely authentic. The baked enchiladas smothered in cheddar or jack cheese that we often encounter in the US are sometimes quite delicious, but this is not the way they are served in Mexico - most Mexican cooks do not have ovens, and the enchiladas are rolled and served immediately. Thanks for offering AR members this wonderful and easy recipe.

Very easy steps to follow. Although I made some changes. When I was putting the chicken meat inside the enchiladas I added fresh chopped cilantro and white onion in addition to a teaspoon of the tomatillos sauce. Instead of serving it right away I place them inside the oven 400Â° degrees,covered the tray with foil and cheese on top is optional instead of fresh mexican sour cream. Overall I really enjoyed cooking this recipe :-)

This is hands down the best recipe I've made from this site. These enchiladas were authentic, easy to make and delicious. The only thing I did different from the recipe was to broil the ingredients instead of using the griddle. I left them in there until they were blackened which was about the same time as listed in the recipe. I dumped the juices the tomatillos left into the blender and used one less cup of water to compensate. Great recipe!

I made this just as it is written I even bought the cotija cheese which was very interesting, it is dry and salty and doesn't melt. I have made authentic Enchiladas Verdes from this site and the flavor is very close. They always seem just a little dry to me. Maybe I like my enchiladas swimming in sauce, other than that they are a 5 star all the way.

These were GREAT!! Thankfully I only used 2 serrano peppers since I left the seeds in them! The dish assembled pulled the heat down to just right if you like a medium heat. Loved them!!

followed the directions close as possible while demonstrating in-front of a class but had to make a few alterations. Such as the amount of water, i would have used maybe 1 cup maybe less considering after i poured maybe 2 cups it got super liquidy and i had to put cornstarch in to thicken it up. As for the roasting the garlic, peppers, and tamatillos that went down the drain completely; I had to stick them in the oven after 30 minutes and not seeing much difference. Over all the sauce was good and everyone liked the dish but i would have left out cotija cheese beacuse people were complaining it tasted rubbery (i'm not sure if that's how the cheese is supposed to taste) overall i wouldn't mind making this again only if i didn't have to go out and buy the ingredients.

Followed all the ingredients and prep directions (except softened tortillas in microwave wrapped in damp paper towels/30 sec). Made a double recipe.  Packaged up and refrigerated 1 batch so we can serve some as directed in the recipe.  The sauce is very spicy hot.  If you want it milder, be sure to remove the seeds from the peppers.  

Since I was the only one home, I decided to make layered enchiladas with the remaining batch.  That way my family could serve themselves when they came home.
 
I added the crema & cilantro to the sauce (which cut the heat/spice a little).  
Cut softened tortillas into 1" strips and
used 2 cups of cotija.
  
Put thin layer of sauce on bottom of 9"x13" dish.  Continued layering as follows:
1/2 of tortilla strips, 
1/2 of chicken, 
1/2 of Cojita cheese,
1/2 of Sauce 
repeat layers once.
Put the few remaining tortilla strips on top.
  
Baked uncovered at 400F for 25-30 min.

Husband tried the original sauce and told me to keep this recipe.  He plans to add a little salt and use the sauce on tacos, etc.  
So far this recipe has been a hit with the whole family.  Fortunately we like lots of spice.

My wife and I enjoyed these enchiladas. Very different than typical Tex.Mex. that you get in a cafe. I would say to pay attention to the statement to not over do the cheese and crema.

I followed the recipe as much as I could, but couldn't locate crema fresca so used sour cream instead. The flavor was great, but my one complaint is that they were soggy. I think I'm used to the more traditional way we get them in restaurants so wasn't expecting that. I kept thinking they needed to go in the oven to crisp them up.

We enjoyed these but they were a little too hot for Hubs. The sauce is nice and makes you feel good you made it from scratch, but I
must say a quality jarred salsa verde is as good or better, minus all the prep!

to make it simple, I slow cooked a pork loin roast in a jar of salsa verde instead.  Now it may taste even better when following the recipe exactly, but it tasted great this way!  Even my older kids liked it.

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband and I liked the spice.  I used two Serrano peppers.  It was too spicy for my small children though.  We also used grated Parmesan and sour cream that was on hand.  It was delicious and I will definitely make again.

5 stars for flavor, but 4 stars for ease of preparation!  This was for me a messy, complicated affair.  Do not skip warming the corn tortillas in oil.  This is an important part of the authentic flavor of this dish.  I followed the recipe to a "T", and we quite enjoyed the flavor--fresh, bright, tangy, softened by the crema.  I have to say, though, my sauce never did thicken up, even after simmering for at least an hour.

I followed the recipe exactly except that I baked them as I had prepared them early on Christmas day. Delicious!

Truly the most amazing meal I've ever made.  Thank you so much for this recipe.  It's hard, it takes awhile and your fingers get burned, but everyone is amazed they aren't eating at a real Mexican restaurant!

Like most everyone else, I loved the flavor of the sauce. I followed the directions as stated, but want to try putting them in the oven for a bit after assembled as they cooled off in temperature quickly after the addition of the crema and cheese. Did anyone else have this problem?

We loved it. Although we should have read some of the suggestions, using a griddle, took way to long.

Very messy. But messy is sometimes worth it, this dish is no exception!!! Fairly spicy but when I put refried beans it was pretty tasty. Expect the dish to be flavorful. We likes it....

I think this recipe is great. Very much like my own recipe I use. For all who want to make it even better. I use home made corn tortillas when making enchiladas of any sort or tacos etc. but especially for green enchiladas. The other thing as for the chicken. I usually boil a whole chicken for the stock and shred the chicken for the enchiladas. I use the stock for the sauce and I use the left over stock for my Mexican rice instead of water. Its more work but I think the secret to any fantastic Mexican dish is using home made tortillas.  Also if  I can't make them we have a tortilla company here in town and I usually go and buy them warm there to use for our enchiladas.

Loved these! I made them exactly as described in the recipe.  I thought I didn't like verde sauce or corn tortillas (at least I have never liked either one in restaurants) but this dish was delicious.

Made this tonight I used a can of mushroom soup.  And some homemade green salsa. And topped with pepper jack cheese. Also used cumin and extra galric salt.

These are wonderful chicken enchiladas and the sauce is what makes this dish. It is the first time I used Tomatillos and it was a lot of fun toasting/blackening and making the sauce.  It turned out just like a fine dining restaurant.

Wow these are amazing.  Will be making again and again.  I don't think I've ever had homemade green enchilada sauce before!  So easy to make!!!  I did broil the sauce ingredients - much easier.  Also I doubled the recipe and only used two serrano peppers, which for me made it perfect with just a little zing to it.

Excellent! I was a bit unorganized and when it came to serving time, they were not as hot temperature wise.  The taste was very very good. This is definitely a keeper! Thank you Gema!

I messed up and used two jalapenos instead of the serano peppers, as well as roasted corn from the grill that was leftover combined with the chicken. The verde sauce was AWESOME... the biggest mess up was that I over-baked the tortillas in the oven (instead of frying), so I folded the crunchy ones in half and made tacos verde. Very tasty, will actually do it right next time. :) Thanks!

Awesome recipe.  I didn't take the seeds out of the peppers so I thought it would be too hot.  But the Crema Fresca and cheese cut the heat.  I didn't quite understand it telling you to do 3 at a time and pile them on top of each other since enchiladas are usually in one layer...so I kept them in one layer and it worked beatifully.  Definitely a recipe I'll be keeping.

Fantastic!  Some of the best, most authentic enchiladas I've had.  I decreased the serranos to 2 to lessen the heat, broiled instead of using a griddle, and used heavy cream and queso fresca.  Only complaint is I should have made more!

Amazing recipe. I have made this time after time and my family doesn't get tired. It's time consuming, but the end results are delicious. I kept everything the same except I used ground beef instead of chicken. Still delicious.

I enjoyed this recipe.  Picked up the ingredients fairly easily at the local market.  Wasn't difficult to make.  Kids wouldn't have anything to do with it but my wife ate two helpings.  Would have used one cup less water on the sauce.  Definitely keep the Serrano seeds in to give it some spice.

These are delicious! I didn't have the cheese listed so I used queso fresco crumbled on top. I used 2 serrano peppers to 1lb of tomatillos & used 1 1/2 cups of water to dilute the hotness of the serranos. My husband, who loves spicy foods, said it was the perfect balance. I didn't have the crema either but it didn't need it- the sauce is wonderful. Thank you for an easy, delicious meal!

Surprisingly good. There are many food allergies in my household (onions, wheat, dairy...), so I made a few modifications. We cannot eat store cooked chicken, so I slow cooked a grass fed beff roast in the crockpot with homemade abode sauce, cilantro, cloves, bay leaf, and homemade veggy stock. I also substituted GF brown rice tortillas for flour. Served with vegan parma and soy-based sour cream.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! Awesome just the way it is!!! And HEALTHY!!! Thanks gema!!! I did do two things differently. Instead frying the tortillas, I put them in the microwave for one minute. Also, I use real chicken stock instead of bouillon. I will make this recipe again and again! Very authentic and tasty!!!

The sauce was so easy to make.  I would use less water next time for my personal taste.  I thought 3 peppers was perfect as well.  After I put the sauce on them I topped with a little cheese and broiled them for a bit.

So tasty! Very glad that I tried this. Roasting makes all the difference. This recipe does take a little longer, but I had the time, so no big deal. The verde sauce is delicious, don't change a thing, especially the frying of tortillas. The cheese is a MUST! Served with beans and homemade guac, reheated well. Will be making this again!

Excellent!  Everyone loved it!  I made it with the Cotija cheese and Crema Fresca.  It came out just as good as the enchiladas you would have at an authentic Mexican Resturant.  In one word...YUM!

These are very good, although I have to say my family prefers the full fat edition (from this site).  The sauce was outstanding! I went to my local Mexican market for their in-store made cojita cheese, to make it true to recipe.  I even bought a delicious rotisserie chicken from them. The only things I did differently - I used only 1 cup of water, which was enough to keep the sauce with some thickness.  Also, after I wrapped all of the enchiladas, before adding any additional sauce, cheese or crema, I put them in a 400 degree oven for 12 minutes, so I could serve them hot. Then put them on a bed of lettuce, topping them with more sauce, cheese, a little crema, along with cilantro, cheese and avocado.  Light and healthy summer's end supper.

Made it for a casual Sunday dinner. Everyone loved it, had to adjust the heat down to 1 Serrano or it would of been way to hot. Great dish, will definitely make it again!

For the first time in my cooking life,  I did not alter one part of this recipe.  It is terrific just as it was created.  Easy to make and just spicy enough without  too much heat.  This recipe will go into my permanent file.  Serve this to any guests and they will be coming back for more!

It's worth the effort to make your own sauce! These came out so good that we didn't have any leftovers. Use the full amount of Serrano peppers if you like a little heat. I only used 2 and it wasn't enough. I also added cilantro to the blender when I chopped the tomatillos and peppers.

I'm Hispanic but only cook by recipe. I envy those that can cook by just eyeing it. Like my mother that just goes into the fridge and brings out a bunch of items and 30 mins later we have a great meal. I need to follow instructions (LOL).... Well I followed these instructions and it came out GREAT!!!!!! Going forward I will make the sauce ahead of time so that the following day I just have to just roll the tortillas. They do get a little cold especially since I'm a little slow.  :) But I place them all in a casserole dish and then placed it in the oven for about 12mins. Cheese was melted added more sauce and Yummmmmm!!!!! Looking forward to making this again.

Great recipe! I won't make enchiladas any other way now that I have found this gem. I broiled the tomatillos, peppers and garlic and was able to finish making the dish in 30 minutes.

Best enchiladas ever. I was a little skeptical about the claims that one would desire to drink the sauce. Get yourself a glass, cause you will want to drink it.

Amazing and delicious. The sauce seemed a bit watery to me so next time I won't use so much. I'm not a wimp when it comes to spice but I was worried about it being too spicy so I only used one Serrano pepper. I realize now I could have used all three. But if you're sensitive to spice stick with one. My husband was amazed and said it was better than any restaurant he's been to. Winning recipe!

Great recipe! The amount of heat was just right for me, I can handle some but not crazy spicy. It will be too much for my husband so I think I'll decrease the number of serranos in it. Fantastic!

Great sauce recipe. I used a store bought roasted chicken for more flavor. Feel like the recipe is missing something though, it's a little dry. Maybe so cheese or something rolled up with the chicken inside?

These were really good.  They took a lot of pots, but went together simply.  The next time, I will not use so much water in the sauce; maybe half as much or a little more.  I used small peppers and only used 5 for a double recipe.  Good amount of heat.  Makes more like 24 enchiladas but several people wanted a third one each so it served the same number of people.  Lettuce was unnecessary.  Serve with corn-on-the-cob, beans and rice.

Tried this recipe. I was delicious. I changed two things. I didnt dip the tortillas in the sauce. After slightly frying them I just added the shredded chicken ( I boiled a chicken breast and shredded), a little sauce, and cheese to the inside. I rolled it up and added sauce, cheese, and crema to the outside. I served it with white rice. I also used one cup less of water than the recipe called for. The sauce was still very smooth and not watery. Great recipe. I love the short list of ingredients.

This is by far the easiest and best Mexican recipe I have ever served!  The rotisserie chicken makes it moist and easy.  I substitute poblano peppers instead of the serrano peppers in the verde sauce.  It is not as hot and yields more sauce.  You will make this over and over.

I made these exactly as written, right down to the cojita and crema. I did double the peppers since we prefer more heat. They were very good, although labor intensive.  I like the addition of cilantro and serranos a lot though, so will probably add those to my old stand-by crockpot recipe that needed a little more kick and is much simpler.  Also prefer slow-cooked pork to the chicken.  All-in-all, very good, very authentic recipe.  I'm glad we tried it!

AMAZING!  It is very salty however.  I used less of the chicken bouillonne and switched out the cojita cheese for something less salty.  The sauce was to die for.

I love authentic Mexican food - prefer authentic taco stands to fancy commercialized restaurants - but I'm sorry I just didn't care for these.  I took the seeds out of the serrano peppers before cooking them which left little to no heat.  My son said it all, 'they're so bland'.  Even if the sauce did have more heat, I don't know if I would have cared that much more for it.

This was very good and authentic.  I am always looking for new recipes for my fiance, who loves authentic Mexican food and he loved this.  It reminded us of chile quiles that we had in Mexico.  I took the advice of others and baked the tortillas at 350 for 10 minutes to save on calories, otherwise I followed the receipe to a T and it was great.  I might use less cilantro and lettuce when I make it again, otherwise, it was fantastic.  Thanks for the recipe, Gema!

I had never cooked w/ tomatillos before and wanted to try this. It was excellent!! My husband said,'WOW! this is great!"...I roasted the tomatillos, and only one serrano chili (it would have been way too hot for us) and the garlic a lot longer than suggested. I wanted to get a good blackening on them for flavor. yum!!

To make this even quicker I use crushed tortilla chips instead of frying corn tortillas.  It's not an enchilada casserole anymore but rather a chillaques (sp?).

This was awesome. AMAZING!! I made it for my in-laws, and they kept asking for more! (until we ran out) Next time I want to make a HUGE batch of the sauce and save it, because all of the work was in the sauce..everything else was easy to put together.  The only change I made was that I took most of the seeds out of the serranos.. it still had a good kick to it, but it wasn't overly spicey. probably would've been just as delicious either way though.. :) this is a phenomenal recipe - you have to try it!!

My husband and I did not care for this dish at all.  We love mexican food, but this isn't one that I will make again.

I made no changes. I loved it. It was as I was hoping. I had never bought tomatillos before so this was my first experience. Roasting on a griddle seemed a little laborious -- I think next time I will actually roast everything in the oven. I had enough sauce leftover to make it a second day. .

The sauce was perfect!! I have always baked my enchiladas but the approach mentioned in this recipe was SO much better. I wonât be eating out as much now that I know how to make enchiladas like this. And my teens loved it!

Super Duper recipe!!  It was a bit of work but well worth the effort  to have a  real authentic Verde sauce.  I wanted to skip frying the tortilla step but didn't based on one reviewer saying it was important.  It make ALOT of sauce.  I didn't use it all as I thought it would be too wet and soupy. Good news, I have extra sauce to do it again!!  Also, I'm not sure about the crema being absolutely necessary.....I will try sour cream next time. YUM!!

This recipe is outstanding!  It is the only way I will prepare enchiladas going forward.   The flavors were spectacular. 

I did as others suggested and broiled the garlic, tomatillos and peppers.   Also reduced water by 1 cup.  Other than that, followed the recipe exactly and could not be happier with the outcome.  

Thank you Gema!

So easy and oh so delicious. I saved my leftover verde sauce, cooked it, then used it for a spicy gazpacho.

I've made this several times; it makes an excellent sauce. I use a grill pan to char the vegetables outside on my gas grill. To avoid the problem of soggy tortillas, mix shredded chicken into the sauce and serve it alongside warm tortillas and toppings for everyone to assemble as they eat. Thanks for sharing.

This was easy and quite delicious.  Leftovers disappeared from the fridge overnight!  Accompanied with homemade Crema Fresca......1 cup heavy cream, 1 tablespoon buttermilk.  Combine in a jar and let sit lightly covered out on your counter overnight.  When it starts to thicken, cover tightly and refrigerate until very thick, approx 12 hours.  Whisk in a pinch of sea salt and a teaspoon lime juice.

I love this recipe! I've made it twice now with a few personal tweaks. I have tried using grilled steak and onions instead of chiken which has turned out SO good. I also like to add a little bit of cornstarch mixed with water to thicken up the verdes sauce. Lastly, I bake the enchiladas after topping with sauce and cheese for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.

I love chilaquiles verdes, but I haven't been able to find a good commercial salsa or sauce for the tortilla chips, so I decided to make the sauce.

I added and extra serrano, two extra cloves of gralic, and used a rich chicken stock instead of bouillon and water.  It's sitting on the stove cooling now, and I keep going back  to taste it.  It's that good.

It's not prep intensive, but it is time consuming to roast the vegetables.  However, the end result is well worth it, and I look forward to having chilaquiles this weekend.

I made this as directed except I used chicken broth instead  of water, added onion to the vegetables. It was easy enough and an eye appealing Dish.  Was I crazy about the taste?  I would say it was O.K.I probably wonât make it again.  Husband didnât really rave about it.

I made several adjustments to this recipe, because I either couldn't find or didn't have several ingredients.  Used a commercial Verde sauce, but added the chicken bullion. This really makes a difference and gives it great flavor.  Also used shredded Mexican cheese blend at end and put it in the over for 30 minutes at 350 to melt and cook extra.  It ended up great!

I've made this twice now and it was such a hit.  The sauce is so good, if you have any left over you can save it and use it with other meals.  The second time I made this I made two small changes, I used just a bit less water because the sauce is pretty watery.  I also baked the assembled enchiladas for about 10 minutes at 425 just to make sure everything was good and hot.  This might be one of my favorite recipes I've ever used from Allrecipes.

We enjoyed this dish so much!  I baked the garlic, tomatillos and serrano peppers in a 400 degree oven til lightly browned.  I substituted 3 cups of organic chicken broth for the  chicken bouillon granules and 3 cups of water.

Would be five stars but cooking the chicken at that temperature/amount of time makes it very tough and dry. I would try baking at 450 for 20-25 minutes instead

I may never go out to eat. These were amazing and super easy! It is pretty spicy and I only used two Serrano peppers but it was the perfect amount of heat for me. I will be making this again and again.

This was amazing! I only replaced the serrano pepper with cubanelle, because my husband doesn't like spicy food (also, I was unable to find it). It was a hit!

For the folks complaining about how spicy it is, know your peppers! If you don't like spicy things, use a milder pepper.

10/10 Will make again.

I just made this and it turned out great! However heading the words of other reviews I changes something things. I roasted the garlic, Serrano peppers and tomatillos. I only added 2 cups of water instead of three and instead of adding all 3 Serrano peppers I added one Seeded! And it was oleanty of heat! I thought even that would be to spicy but it turned out great! I used sour cream mixed with a little milk instead of Mexican crema and skipped the coja cheese just to be a little more wallet friendly. Still turned out awesome and I would make again!

I have made this recipe many times, and it always is a hit. It tastes fabulous. Make SURE to eat it right when it's done; don't let it sit around and then eat it because everything will go soggy. Sometimes it doesn't work well if you have to take it somewhere, because it may be soggy by the time it gets there.

Love this recipe! I took other reviewers suggestions: I didn't fry the tortillas-- I used olive oil spray on both sides of the tortillas, placed them on a baking sheet and put them in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes. Also, I put the tomatillos, serrano peppers, and garlic cloves in the broiler for 20 minutes versus charring them on the stove top. Please note: Start with two serrano peppers in the blender vs putting all three-- Two was enough heat for me!

Followed recipe exactly with one exception, I removed the seeds from the Serrano peppers prior to blending. I like hot food, but my daughter does not. This recipe was awesome!  It was the perfect use of leftover rotisserie chicken. Next time I make it, I will split the sauce in two batches and make one spicy and one mild. Great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious. I did lower the salt a bit from other reviews but besides that it is a great recipe and taste just like the restaurants. I made it last week and am making it again tonight. Highly recommend it!

I too love Mexican food, one reason I have spent so much time vacationing, studying, visiting and backpacking there. I love street food, home cooked meals and formal restaurants. So after reading all the 5 star reviews I went out and bought all the ingredients. 

I used only one Serrano pepper; roasted, seeded and stemmed and the sauce was far to hot for company or even me.

While making the sauce I dipped my little finger in to see if I need to ad more peppers and threw the entire batch down the garbage disposal. Waste of money, waste of time and very disappointment.

It's got possibilities but too much work for a weeknight meal and not a home run. It was runny enough w/out athe 3 cups of water.  Also not sure why use of store bought chicken was recommended.  I would have also liked the tortillas crispier to add more crunch.  I adhered to the 5 second per side since it was my first time making.  Loved the authentic cheese, Mexican 'sour cream' and cilantro.

I did this recipe to a tee and the sauce was so spicy it knocked my head off!  I don't know if our store's serrano peppers just happen to be beyond spicy today or what!?  I added a ton of honey and yogurt and chicken broth to try to tone it down and that didn't even work.  I had to run to the store and buy store bought enchilada sauce. Also it's way too much mexican crema, I drizzled it and probably only used a quarter of it, as it would have been way too much. Also I put them in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes to melt the cheese a bit which was great.  I will make again but with lots of little changes.

I made this with leftover turkey and added a roasted Poland to the sauce. They turned out great. Next time I will use grilled chicken and make extra sauce to use for a breakfast chilaquiles dish.

Like many others, I broiled my tomatillos garlic and peppers. I accidentally bought pablano peppers which are very mild so my salsa wasn't spicy at all. I fried flour tortillas instead of corn since we don't like corn tortillas and I used Monterey Jack cheese for the top. My husband said "this is the best meal you've ever made" I don't know how reliable he is though because he says that every time I cook lol ?? All in all great recipe! Yumms!

Not only were these delicious and fresh, they were easy to make! Way better than the American casserole style of enchilladas I was used to. I live in the middle of nowhere so I wasn't able to use the mentioned cheese, but finely shredded "Mexican blend" cheese worked just fine. Tomatillos is where its at!

This recipe is so good!  I've made it a few times and every time it's amazing.  I use the leftover sauce for eggs, potatoes, even as salsa - pretty much anything I can until it's gone.

Don't try this at home! We followed the recipe as closely as we could, the only changes we made were we used chicken breasts left over from a recent cookout, and we used plain greek yogurt for the crema because we couldn't find it at any market around here.

The end result was delicious, for sure. But we (my wife and I) had to make an assembly line to assemble everything at the end. It took us almost 2 hours to prepare. I had planned to have dinner ready when she got home, but there was no way I could have completed this alone and have it still be hot and fresh.

So I give it 4 stars because it has a truly wonderful flavor. But I will not make it again, because the ingredients are too hard to find, the kitchen was destroyed after I was done (too many bowls, pans, trays etc to clean up), and the sheer effort required to make it.

LOVE!! I was actually looking for a recipe for Chile Verde when I came across this. And if I'm honest, I only use the sauce part of this recipe and it's amazing. We love it!! I use the verde sauce for making chile verde almost weekly. I adjust the garlic and serranos, more garlic and usually only 2 serranos. I don't have a griddle so I first used the broil setting in my oven then I started putting my tomatillos in the oven for around 20min first then adding my serranos and garlic and turning the broil on. Love the way the flavor comes out!! It's been amazing every time! I've actually got tomatillos on my counter now, I'll be making this tomorrow!

My husband loved this recipe - especially the hotness of the verde sauce.  We had plenty of the sauce left over to use in other recipes.  I roasted the veggies under the broiler (be sure an use a jelly roll pan).

We loved this recipe and followed the recommendation to broil the peppers, tomatillos and garlic.  Served with a side salad of guacamole and some homemade pico - delicious!

The green chili sauce in this recipe is fabulous!!!  The enchiladas were so tasty and I will be making this recipe for many years to come.  Super easy, albeit a little time consuming.  Making the sauce tonight to put on fish, as I think this sauce will go well with anything.

oh my gosh!! I made this last week and friends dropped over - I am still getting calls about how incredible these are! & both guys are well versed in what true mexicana fare is. The only change we will make in the future is to add another style of mexican cheese that is less salty & that melts. Otherwise -perfection!

Excellent recipe. I had never made enchiladas from scratch. I thought it was a long but fairly easy process. I just wished the recipe described better whether the veggies needed to be chopped, diced, minced etc. I would also add a little more heat.

I cut back on the serrano peppers based on some of the other reviews and I really wish I wouldn't have----my verde sauce was not nearly spicy enough.  I believe you could cut down on the preparation time by making the verde sauce ahead of time----that is the most time consuming part of the recipe.  The reason for frying the toritillas is that it makes them way easier to work with---more flexible.  I also agree with loading on the verde sauce---without the extra sauce, mine turned out a little dry.  The advice to go easy on the crema and the cheese is dead on---these neutralize any heat in the sauce.  If you like your dish spicy, lay off of these 2 ingredients.  Overall, a very good recipe and I will make it again with MORE peppers!!

After much time devoted to this recipe, I succeeded with 1/4 can of leftover tomatillas, and 4 broiled roma tomatoes. I also substituted greek yogurt for the crema and parmesan for the cotija cheese. I mixed both right into the sauce and a delightful result!

Cinco De Mayo meal was a hit...thanks to these enchiladas!!! I used ingredients as listed, but I did add some of the verde sauce to the chicken that I had put into a small pot to warm and also addsd the cilantro and a bit of fresh onion to the meat. I did forget to dredge the tortillas in the sauce which I don't think made a big difference. I found both of the cheeses at a local grocery store (with about a million other mexican food items, glad I found that store) my husband hates sour cream so when he saw the crema fresca, he opted out !! No big deal just made mine and his a little different. Our 10 year old son gobbled them up also, can't wait to make them again, a bit extra work, but oh so worth it!!! I also baked them in  350 degree oven for about 15 minutes..DELICIOUS!!!

Delicious!  The perfect meal for Cinco de Mayo!  I didn't simmer the sauce long enough, so it was a little watery at first -- but that was easily corrected.  Used only 2 serrano peppers (seeded!) and that was enough heat for us.  Also, couldn't find cotija chz, so I sub't Parm.  Will definitely make again ...  and again ... :)

This was very good, my family like it a lot. A bit hot for some, so I will use 2 serrano peppers next time. My only problem with the recipe is the Nutritional Value! How do you come up with 222mg sodium? The cheese alone is 375mg,+ 17.8 for the crema fresca. Then there is the chicken. My estimate is 483c, 470mgs and 22.7gp. Could someone explain the difference?
