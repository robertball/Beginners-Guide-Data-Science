this is so good. the first time I made it I substituted applesauce for the oil & then found I only had 1egg, so I added more applesauce, lol. also used fresh plums & no food coloring. it was delicious & so moist. I've made it several times since & shared with neighbors. good for breakfast or dessert!

Definitely a cake. Really taste like a strong spice cake. I couldn't find plum baby food so I used prune baby food; not a strong prune flavor. Very easy to make. Made it for Thanksgiving so I haven't tried it all together. But the little taste of cake was good and the glaze is great. Both are strong flavors can't wait to try.
