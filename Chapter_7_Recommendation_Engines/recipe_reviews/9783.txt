These were very good! I did make some changes, though because I didn't have all the ingredients on the list. I used splenda, walnuts and dried berries (cranberries, cherries and blueberries). I reconstituted the berries in warm water for several minutes to plump them up. I did have to add a splash more milk because the dough was a bit crumbly. Also, I didn't want to wait to chill them, the oven was already hot from baking biscuits. So, I just pinched off a chunk of dough, rolled it into a ball, them smushed the ball flat, patted it on both sides with the cocounut and baked.  Next time I'll chill the bowl of dough in the freezer for about 10 min. first because the dough was a little soft, but I managed okay and they came out nicely. I would definitely make these again.

What a nice change of pace.  The coconut influence is enjoyable.  I didn't have candied fruit in the house, so I just used walnuts.  Then after cutting into slices I sprinkled the remaining coconut on the top of each cookie.  I also added a tiny bit more milk based on a prior comment.  The dough was easy to handle and get into the 3 rolls.  I'll make them again.

These are amazing cookies and can also be served without baking. I was given this recipe from my nana, and if you like cherries you will love these cookies!!!

My oven quit and I had to do cookies.  Found this recipe and the comment about not needing to bake them.  Was afraid they would taste of raw flour,  so I browned the flour in my old dutch oven on top of the stove, mixed the lot and even stirred in half a cup of peanut butter instead of a whole cup of butter, on the second batch.   Doubled the vanilla, and put some cinnamon on the second batch, as well as making little balls and squashing them flat.  Kudos from everybody and lots of requests for my "seat of the pants recipe".

Really good cookies!  I made a variation, since 1 c butter seemed heavy- I used 1/2 c vegan margarine (smart balance light) and 1/2 cup applesauce (unsweetened).  They turned out great!  Thanks!!

It was not moist enough to form three 7-inch rolls.  I managed to make several smaller rolls, but a lot of it crumbled the next day as I tried to slice them.  The coconut wouldn't stick to the rolls, either.

My son has milk, egg, peanut, and tree nut allergies. I made this cookie as an alternative to the ones with egg in it. THEY WERE AWESOME! I couldn't tell the difference between the typical sugar cookie and these. 
Of course we did leave out the nuts and coconut.
We rolled them out and used a heart shaped cookie cutters and decorated them with frosting and sprinkles. Thank you sooooo much for the great recipe!

Excellent and easy recipe. My son can't have nuts and won't eat cherries but even without these the cookies were great. Next time I will use an extra tbs milk as they were slightly crumbly to slice. The golden baked cookies were lovely and chewy and the darker baked cookies were lovely and crisp. Win win!

They were good but I had to leave out the nuts and berries. I also didn't bake them as long as directed.
