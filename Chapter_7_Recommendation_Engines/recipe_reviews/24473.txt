I thought this recipe would be bland so I played with it a little.  I substituted leeks for onion (which I just happened to have leftover from another dish), added some bacon (again leftover), nutmeg (traditional for quiche), garlic and cayenne to the mix and it turned out fantastic!  Oh I also topped the quiche with some thinly sliced tomato before baking.

This was a very good, very basic, very quick quiche that could be easily customized.  I pretty made as is except I used half & half instead of cream, and on the recommendation of another member I added another egg.  I forgot to get swiss at the store so I used 1/4 c. cheddar & 1/4 c. parmesan.  NOTE: If you are using a deep dish pie crust this quiche will not be enough to fill the crust.

Simple and delicious.  The first time I made it, I thought it was a little dense, so the next time, I put in 1/2 tsp baking powder and it came out beautifully.  Vidalia onions were perfect and herbs de Province made it even better.

I wasn't expecting much from this recipe, but I happened to have most of the ingredients on hand and wanted to use them up. I was pleasantly surprised, this turned out fantastic! Based on the other reviews, I did use the equivalent of 4 eggs (actually, 1 cup of Better N Eggs to lower the fat content) and 3/4 cup reduced fat Swiss cheese. I also cooked 5 strips of Morningstar 'fakin' bacon' and crumbled that up and sprinkled it on top of the onions, which I layered in a whole wheat frozen pie crust (pre-baked for 10 minutes at 450 since I like a crisp crust). Then I poured the egg and cheese mixture over the onions and 'bacon' and baked the whole thing until the top was slightly browned. It turned out delicious, such a versatile recipe. You could add almost any kind of meat or even use fake meat as I did. I do think it wouldn't be nearly as good with just the onions and cheese but would be more like an omelette in a crust. The savoriness of the 'bacon' really made this special. And it's so easy, I always thought quiche was difficult but I whipped this up in just a few minutes! Definitely a keeper.

I never liked quiche till I tried this one.  You can make it as is or any any kind of veggies you like to it and it comes out great!  Just remember to pre-cook you pie shell for 10 minutes if you want a crispy crust.

Plain old onion quiche.  Maybe this would be a a 5-star recipe if I ate it with fresh strawberries, payaya or mango.  I didn't use Vidalia onions; in season, that might have been a treat.  I'll make it again if I want to use up onions and eggs.

This recipe is great.  Everyone who tried it loved it.  I made it twice and I think you need 4 eggs.  I guess it depends on the pie crust you use though.  I also used 1/2 cup of cheese.  Definitely a keeper!

This turned out fantastic!  I used the No-Roll Pie Crust I recipe and was super impressed with both.  Minor changes:  I added a clove of garlic when cooking the onions (didn't need a Tbs of butter to saute them just a small amount of non-fat cooking spray).  Also added a small amount of chopped cilantro to the eggs.  Lastly, I used Muenster cheese instead of Swiss and it was y-u-m-m-y!

Never made a quiche before, but this one turned out great. It's so quick and easy that I'm sure I'll be making it again soon. You'll want to add some salt, pepper or other seasoning to the egg mixture to bring out the flavor.   I made a few additions and substitutions based on what I had on hand. This recipe lends itself to that.   Instead of heavy cream, I used some canned evaporated milk, and added a fourth egg as others have suggested. To season, I mixed in a tablespoon of onion soup mix and some black pepper in with the eggs. I used a blend of cheddar and monterey jack cheese since I didn't have any swiss.   The texture was spot on, and it received a thumbs up from my husband.

This is a staple for my recipe book. Its delicious as is and extremely adaptable to whatever you have on hand. I have added bacon, toasted pine nuts, paprika and nutmeg to it with great success.

I love to cook but time is not on my side.  This was easy & quick.  Used 4 eggs, added ground pepper & salt to taste, and some real bacon bits.  Also, Vidalia onion was the clincher to make this a quiche to remember.

Followed recipe exactly, very easy and quick quiche.  The finished quiche is basic, bland and rather dense.  Good quick recipe but not something I will be making again.

This was so simple and so excellent. The flavor was great. I used less butter, fat free half and half and a mix of shredded "Italian" cheeses. I also added some frozen carrots and peas and turkey bacon. It turned out great!

So simple and delicious. I used milk in place of the cream because I didn't have any but kept everything else the same. Turned out wonderfully.

I made so many changes that I'm not sure it's fair to rate this recipe, but here's my feedback in case it's helpful.

To reduce calories/fat, I baked this without a crust.  I used 5 eggs as recommended by others.  I completely changed the other ingredients--used sauteed mushrooms and spinach, feta cheese, diced kalamata olives, balsamic onions (Barefoot Contessa brand), garlic powder, pepper, paprika, and half 'n half instead of cream.  I baked this concoction in a glass pie plate at 350 for 30 minutes.  It turned out very well (hubby just devoured it and asked me to make another one).

I agree with other reviewers who comment that this is a great base recipe upon which it's easy to build whatever quiche you want.  The ratio of eggs to dairy is perfect if you use 5 eggs and 1/2 cup milk/cream.

This was a great way to use up ingredients that were in the fridge! Next time I might try using Egg Beaters to reduce the fat further.

I’ve been meaning to thank you for sharing this with us for some time; it’s become one of my go to recipes.  I really like it and have made it several times, as a matter of fact ones in the oven right now!  It’s great for a light lunch or dinner and if I don’t have heavy cream around I always have ½ & ½ so it works just as well.

We enjoyed this dish so much that I've made it twice this week.  I did make a few alterations, but not many.
The recipe didn't specify what type of onions to use, so I mixed yellow and sweet onions (more yellow, less sweet) and sauteed them until they were just beginning to caramelize (for sweetness).  
I used a deep dish crust and stuck with three eggs both times and that worked perfectly.  The quiche came out fluffy both times, perhaps because I let the batter stand for a few minutes before adding to the crust.  
I also added a little garlic salt as well and increased the swiss cheese to 1 cup (I like cheese).
It was a perfect blend and not overwhelmingly "eggy".  One of my new faves!

I love the texture of this Quiche.  I did use some Oregano and garlic to flavour up the fried onion.  Yum.  I did double the recipe since the pie dish and crust I had was much bigger.  Tasted great heated up the day after as well.

Perfect as is. Yes, there are fancier quiches out there but this is simple and tasty. I try to remember to lower it down a rack in my oven. I've had to use milk instead of cream and it turns out fine.

with the addition of another egg, this turned out perfect, but it was too sweet for our tastes.  Might cut down on the onions a bit, try different veggies, use some garlic, more salt / pepper, different cheese...not sure what, but need to change something.  I cannot fault the results tho, just how it tastes (to us, anyway).  Will definitely make again, with a few changes---thanks!

I added zucchini to the onions, but otherwise stayed with the recipe.  To my family's taste, it didn't need additional seasoning.

I tried this for the first time and was very pleased with the result.   When sauteing the onions, I added a pinch of salt and pepper.   Otherwise it was done according to the recipe.  The flavors were right on.   Received many compliments for this dish.  Next time, I'll use 4 eggs.

With just a few changes, this quiche is perfect!  First, I chopped up two cloves of garlic and sauteed with the onions.  Second I fried up about 6 strips of bacon (chopped it up) and added it to the mixture.  I also added some pepper, used waaaaay more cheese than called for (cheddar), and used 4 eggs.  It tastes even better the next day!!

This is a great basic quiche ratio.  I chopped and roasted a red onion with a little spinach and poultry seasoning.  I used 1/2 cup shredded cheddar, and crumbled some goat cheese on top.

This is a great, easy recipe that I have made a number of times. For even more convenience I use a frozen pie crust and whatever milk I have on hand in place of the cream (although the cream does make it luxuriously rich.)  I like to throw some braised broccoli in there, or some leeks, but honestly just the cheese and onion are flavorful enough.

Simple and wonderful quiche recipe!  I fried my onion with some bacon and used cheddar, although I would have preferred Swiss but didn't have any on hand.  Delicious and, like the other reviewers have mentioned, it's a great base recipe that's easy to play with.

I've made this quiche a couple of times now... with just a few minor adjustments for our taste.  It is a wonderful "building block" for customizations.  Rather than list all the changes we made I suppose I'll go create a customized version ;)

I cooked some ham and then i added the onion. I also added some fresh parsley and thyme, as well as fresh purple spinach from my garden. I used a no roll pie crust recipe, but cut it down to a third. I put just a small ball of dough in 6 muffin tins.  I also used two eggs instead of three. I used cheddar instead of swiss. They came out great! Super yummy and perfect for two people!

I loved this receipe it was simple enough for a quick enough for lunch, a light dinner or brunch. I added some cracked pepper, a little salt, nutmeg and some dried italian seasoning. It was hit with my family. I seved it with sauteed brocolini and fresh tomatoes thinly sliced with a few sprinkles of cracked black pepper and lightly salted. It was a hit with my family. I agree with another member would be good smoked salmon or even crab meat.

Very good and simple recipe.  I followed some other suggestions and added leeks, instead of onions, and some potato cubes.  I used 4 eggs instead of 3.  Good recipe...it took only minutes to prepare and 30 to cook!! :)

It was kind of rich - maybe I'm not used to the cream - at least not for breakfast.  I will try the recipe again with other ingredients, maybe like ham and cheese.

I'm not really fond of eggs, but I decided I should try something new.  I made this and added chicken, mushrooms, and mozarella cheese (along with the onions).  It's good with hot sauce and a little sour cream, but it's not something I'd probably ever have a craving for.

This was lovely.  I did have to add an egg (i may have had a larger pie shell, not sure) and I also added a layer of cooked sausage over the onions.  I would definitely make this one again!

I thought this was very very tasty, and easy, which is appealing. However I think a touch of something else, cant pinpoint what(meat?mushrooms?), could give this 5 stars. Absolutely suggest using the heavy cream as recipe calls.

Great easy base recipe for quiche.  My son asks me to make this all the time.  I add spinach, bacon, and tomatoes.  Sometimes I even leave out the onion all together (only because my other son hates onion) and it is still good.

I love finding a recipe that I can stick to the basics on but change if needed based on what I have on hand, etc.  I was looking for a way to use up some extra-large onions someone gave us and this is a WINNER!!  I have two little people and even they were raving about it.  I normally shy away from using so much onion in a recipe but I didn't this time and Wow!  The only thing I did different was to add one more egg, a bit of powdered mustard, broccoli and turkey bacon.  I can't have cream so used evaporated milk and went minus the crust - but that is just preference for all my quiches.  Excellent!!  Thank you!!

This is a good basic recipe that can be adjusted according to personal preference. Tonight I made it with a combination of Swiss, extra-sharp Cheddar and Gruyere cheeses, and only needed 2 large eggs, also mixed in a little bit of s&p. Husband isn't a huge quiche fan, but I loved it. Thanks!

This was very good and simple to make. I added green peppers, garlic powder, chicken, sharp cheddar and I topped it off with tomato slices and feta cheese. I will make this again for breakfast but add more breakfast type ingredients.

I made a few changes to the recipe.I used 1/2 cup chopped onion & red/green pepper mix,frozen ,which I thawed over night instead of the browned onion.I put that & about 1/2 cup real bacon pieces in the bottom of a prebrowned deep dish pie crust.I added 1 egg since I had a deep dish crust.I used half & half instead of cream. I used 2/3 cup cheddar cheese.Used some pepper & Tuscan seasoning mix since this showed NO spices in the recipe.The cooking time was just right.I think this a good basic recipe that you can revise to your taste.

Good base recipe but needed some changes: 1) bake @ 350*  40 min  2) 6 eggs 3) 1/2 cup half n half 4) salt/pepper 5) 1/2 tsp baking powder 6) 6 strips bacon.  It didn't fill the 9 inch pie pan so adding the extra eggs cream worked well to fill.  Will make again with my substitutions ??

customized the recipe because I had leftover grilled zucchini that I wanted to use. Instead of sauteeing the onions, I put them in the bottom of the pre-made pie crust with several lumps of butter and garlic /pepper seasoning  and pre-browned the crust at 375 til almost brown.  Then I added the mixture using  4 eggs as recommended by other reviewers., grated mediterrain flavored white cheddar , a small can of mushrooms, a few pinches of herbs de provence spice, and 4 slices of provolone cheese.  The onion flavor is dominant, but the mushrooms give more texture and the grilled chopped zucchini makes this the Best Ever Veggie Quiche!

First, don't use a deep dish crust.  Regular will make for a fuller pie. I agree that this is a bit bland, but it's still good.  I used half the onion and added a bit more Swiss cheese along with a couple good twists of fresh ground pepper.  I've made this before and will make it again when the weather starts warming up.  Leftover quiche is wonderful!

Simple to make and always tastes great! I did add two additional eggs - used a 9” pie pan and after reading other reviews knew I wanted it full. I like that this recipe lends itself to adding other items.  I’ve added pre-cooked sausage before, which my family loved.

Ok... if you use deep dish crusts, you need prob 5 eggs. I used 3 and it was absolutely not enough. It also was too long in the oven because it was overlooked. I made two quiches. One with bacon. I also use a combo of sharp cheddar and swiss. Good starter recipe but needs more eggs (and cream?) and keep an eye on temp.

I followed the recipe using sweet vidalia onions , and cooked them in the butter on low heat for  at least 20 min. I was a little worried it would be bland without any salt or pepper or herbs of any kind. But decided to try it the first time as it was written, because I knew the onions would have a lot of flavor. 
And it was delicious . My husband loved it! Said I should make it again.
A very easy basic recipe with a great flavor as is, but could easily be adapted with other ingredients if you wanted to change it up .  I will make this again.

We love this recipe, super easy.  I added mushrooms.  I sauté the mushrooms separate from onions, if you do them together they tend to get too wet.  I do 4 eggs instead of three and use an Italian blend shredded cheese.  Family favorite.

I really love this recipe!!! Easy and quick, it's a great side dish. I use Marie Callendar's frozen pie shells, and also use half & half instead of cream. My family loves it! I've made this three times already, and everyone raves about it.

I've made this a few times before and loved it. I usually toss in chopped up odds and ends of left over fresh veggies to make it colorful. Today I made it with sauted onions and chopped potatoes. I swapped swiss for Mexican blend shredded cheese and added a sprinkle of capers. I also sauted with olive oil instead of butter and skipped the pie crust.

An excellent basic recipe!  I've made it twice - once exactly as written and again with a few additional vegetables. I plan to continue trying new combinations. Thanks for submitting this.

I (basically) follow this recipe for my first time making quiche... It was wonderful! On the suggestions of other reviewers I added a 4th egg and 1/2 tsp baking powder. I also added finely chopped ham as I had some on hand that I wanted to use up. Even my man (who was skeptical of something called "quiche" lol) really loved it!

I made this for my notoriously picky grandmother and she LOVED it.  I altered it by adding a can of sodium reduced mushroom pieces.  I was feeding several people so I got two deep-dish pie shells, and tripled the recipe ingredients then split it in two to make two deep-dish quiches.  It is good warm or cold, and freezes well too!  I've just made two more, with mushrooms and I'm trying one with salsa in it since salsa and eggs are tasty.  These are to freeze for my work lunches!

Yum, love the lightly Caramelized onions! However, this quiche was teeny...looked more like pizza....think I could have gotten away with doubling all the filling ingredients. I did use half and half instead of heavy cream, and I added a squirt of yellow mustard because I love mustard in my eggs. Super yummy, thanks for the recipe!

I'm giving this a 4 out of 5 stars because it's a bit bland, but as other users mentioned, this recipe is VERY adaptable. If you're using this as a base recipe then it could be a 5 out of 5
Like others I used 4 eggs instead of 3. I also used 2% milk instead of cream because it's what I had available. In addition to onions and cheese I added potatoes, leeks, and bacon. I was sure to add salt, pepper, and garlic to taste. It turned out fantastic! I would feel confident adjusting this recipe to suit just about any combination of fillings.

Great and easy recipe. I did a few simple changes like other reviewers, I prevailed the pie crust at 400 for 10 minutes, I added 5 fried and crumbled bacon strips, I also substituted half and Hal's and added some fresh chopped garlic chives.

Cooked it for 30 minutes at 375 like the recipe said, and it was completely raw.

Disgusting!!

After reading all the reviews, I decided to incorporate the comments: I added salt and pepper to the onions as they were cooking, and also to the egg mixture. I also added another egg. Since I didn't want the added calories of a crust, I just sprayed a cake pan with PAM, and it came out great. The taste was awesome! I will make this again!

I used Vidalia onion added about 1/4 tsp grated nutmeg and about 1/4 tsp chili powder.  Instead of mixing the cheese with the eggs I sprinkled it over.  It looked beautiful when it came out of the oven but was hard to cut after it cooled.  We enjoyed this and I will use it as a base for a spinach quiche next time.  I agree it doesn't fill a standard pie dish, but if you use a frozen shell it will be fine.

I used this recipe as a base line. I added more eggs and cream and wayyyy more onions. Onion quiche is always great.  Served at a brunch and as an appetizer.

Yum! It was delicious! I've never made a Quiche before, but I was looking for something to eat for dinner tonight besides the box of Kraft Mac and Cheese staring at me from my pantry. I made a very good choice. My mother and I ate half of it! Saving the rest for tomorrow. As other reviewers suggested, I added an another egg and because I was afraid it would be bland, I crumbled up some leftover bacon, and Spinach. I put the bacon on top of the onions, added the egg mixture and put the Spinach on top for a decorative effect. I used Swiss cheese and found it tasted plain. Maybe it's because I grew up on fancy cheese my father would buy from major cities in the U.S. Next time I will use Gruyere Cheese instead, because I will be making this again. I made my own crust because if you're going through all the trouble of making your own quiche/pie you should make your own crust. However I didn't pre-bake it as they recipe said so while the sides were cooked and tasty, as was the filling, the bottom didn't cook and was unedible. I'll regretfully take a star off for that. I will make again soon. :D

I made this once with Vidalia onions and it was so good that I made it again for a pot luck.  It was just OK.  It tasted like onions with an omelet on top.

I make this on a regular basis and everyone loves it! I add 2 extra eggs, omit the butter and just spray my pan, I also add Parmesan cheese and crumbled bacon, I usually have to bake it a little longer. I've used different ingredients (spinach, mushrooms, peppers, sausage) and all,are good but onion and bacon is our favorite. Definitely the best recipe that you can keep as is or play with!

I used coconut milk in this recipe and added turkey bacon, green onions, and parmesan cheese (and I added an extra egg). I also seasoned with ground black pepper, mediterranean herbs, and a little bit of ground white pepper. I was nervous about the coconut milk, but this came out perfectly, more solid/dense. I used the coconut milk because that was all we had and I figured why not, I'll see what happens.

I used a dark metal 9" non stick pie pan and it took 30-40 minutes to bake, and filled the crust. I also used the recipe for "buttery flaky pie crust" on all recipes and it was awesome!
