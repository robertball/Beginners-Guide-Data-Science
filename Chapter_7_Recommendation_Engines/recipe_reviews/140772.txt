I did not like this cake at all! The consistancy was great (very cake like) but the huge serving and was not sweet enough for my tastes.It was made edible by having ice cream with it, but I definately won't try it again.

EDIT* I know I said I would never try this again but I was desperate for easy chocolate cake so I read the other reviews and decided to alter it a little and see what I came up with. I simply added 1/2 cup of sugar and 1T of cocoa. The result was a wonderful chocolatey cake with a great consistancy. Given the improvments I would change my rating from 2 stars to 5 stars.

I don't know why the tough reviews. I guess it was just because of the lack of sweetness to it. However, once you add extra sugar,(abt 1/2 cup extra or so) It becomes perfect! I was watching a movie last night, and really was craving chocolate cake, so I got up and made this one for the first time, and during the commercial break none the less!! Prepared the batter during the first commercial break, and put in the bowl and microwaved it during the second! How fast is that! And let me tell you, it is really good. I added chocolate chips to the batter to make it even more chocolatey, and later made a quick nutella & milk frosting to cover the rest of the cake. One thing I would advise is not to refrigerate it, it becomes hard when you do. It really is a good cake, and would make again. Love the idea of making it without the fuss of preheating the oven, and using lots of dishes and pans. So fast and easy!

Really very good, and so easy! I would give 5 stars, but I had to use slightly different ingredients.  I used 3/4C sugar as another reviewer suggested, used canned coconut milk instead of regular milk, and dry chocolate malt mix instead of cocoa (coconut milk and malt mix were all I had).  I mixed it all up, and put it in the fridge.  Every day I am going to microwave about 1/3 of a cup to have dessert for one - about 5 days worth. I just finished one little cake, and it is not lacking at all for sweetness!

For a microwave cake that is done in 3 minutes... a definite 5 star! My husband's response was "why bother baking them anymore!" I did add an extra 1/2 cup of sugar and an extra tablespoon of cocoa per other reviewers. I'm glad I did b/c it was perfect!

I think this recipe works better if you use 1/2 - 3/4 C. sugar, 2 TBSP. cocoa powder & melt 2 oz. of milk chocolate (or whatever you prefer) with your butter and cream it together, then add sugar and other ingredients. I used strong coffee in place of the milk to enhance the chocolate flavor. Spilt the batter into two heavy microwave safe cereal bowls and let them go for about 2 min. 15 seconds. In order for them to be really flavorful, I let them sit and continue to carryover cook, I removed the cakes and glazed them with a simple chocolate butter glaze. I then covered them in foil and let them sit for about 8 hours. They came out tender & chewy, more like a brownie than a cake. Just don't use too much cocoa powder or you will have one dry, bitter cake. These would be great for slumber parties, simply because they are easy to make and fun to decorate- they have potential to be really cute, and yummy.

I made this recipe just a few minutes ago. I was searching for a quick cake to reward my husband with and this really did the trick. I adjusted the sugar after reading previous reviews and instead put just a little less than 3/4 cup. I didn't have any cocoa so I ended up making a yellow cake. I followed the directions all the way through but added an additional minute to cooking because I'm in the mountains. I also made a quick "chocolate" icing by putting about 3 tablespoons of nutella into a microwave safe cup and heated for about 1 minute. I then added about a tablespoon of milk to the nutella and stirred it up to make it easier to spread. Then I just spead the mixture on the top of the cake.  Delicious! Not bad for a microwave cake.

Wow, loved this recipe! Just made it and only used a third of the bowl, put it in a microwaveable mug and presto - cake in a cup! Only thing I changed was instead of cocoa I used a chocolate milk drink powder (contains mostly cocoa and sugar) and that was only because I didn't have cocoa. I think to post this as a single serving dessert is a mistake as that's a lot of chocolate cake for one craving but it's totally worth making even if you have a mini cake a day for a few days. Brill quick and easy recipe, thanks Laura! :-)

Awesome cake!I've never made microwave cake before so I was surprised that it came out exactly like a baked cake! It tastes best straight out of the microwave. If you leave it for too long it goes hard.
I added 1/2 cup of sugar.

This was not good at all. I read the reviews before I tried it and I made the recommended adjustments. I even tried to eat it with hot fudge and ice cream, but that didn't help the taste. Some things, I guess, just shouldn't be made in the microwave!

When I made this cake I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of cocoa powder  and I thought it was too sweet. I used a GE Spacemaker II microwave and it took 4 minutes.

This is great for a quick chocolate cake fix. I nuked butter + sugar for 30 sec to soften, then tossed the rest of the ingredients into the bowl, making the recommended changes: 1/2 cup of sugar, generous tsp of vanilla, 4 Tbsp of cocoa powder, and 1/2 tsp of baking powder. There's no need to combine the dry ingredients in a separate bowl -- one fewer bowl to wash. It tasted exactly like it was baked in the oven, minus the crispy top/sides. It was very chocolaty, moist, and evenly done in my cheap microwave. Highly recommend!

This is pretty good as is, but with a few revisions it becomes fabulous. 1. Up the sugar to 1/2 c. total (not an additional 1/2 cup - that would be sickly sweet) 2. Up the cocoa to 3 heaping tablespoons 3. Add a handful of chocolate chips 4. Lower the cooking time to 1 1/2 minutes. That gives it a gooey, molten chocolate effect that is fabulous. This recipe is dangerous!

Mmm, with the suggested changes of 3/4c sugar and some extra cocoa powder (I roughly measured, 2-3tbsp) this was a good cake, fantastic when you consider it came out of a microwave. The serving size is probably closer to 4. I thought it was especially dense and moist. Thanks very much for sharing, I'll be making this again.

My child got a microwave bake and decorate kit. The little cake mixes for it are SO expensive and only make 3 little cakes. I used this recipe and she had about 18 little cakes to decorate. Much cheaper than the commercial mix and taste better too.

For flavor and convenience, this totally gets five stars! Don't expect a texture like a baked cake, it's not the same. This is denser. My daughter and I loved this cake. I ended up not cooking it quite long enough, so there was still a bit of gooey batter on the bottom of the bowl when I inverted the cake. Being the "food safety expert" that I am, I just spread the batter on top of the cake like frosting. It tasted great, but next time I'll make sure it's cooked all the way! :)

After reading some reviews, I used 1/2 cup of sugar + double the cocoa powder. I also mixed in chocolate chips and microwaved it for about 3-4 minutes. Topped with a little bit of powdered sugar and chocolate syrup, it was pretty good!

Make this! The taste needs minor work, more cocoa & vanilla for sure and probably chocolate chips. But the texture is spot on and it's sooooo easy.

I read the reviews and added the extra 1/2 cup sugar and extra Tbsp of cocoa and it HIT THE SPOT!!! I am definitely adding this to my recipe book!  I used an older shallow CorningWare dish... it was perfect- I even covered it with plastic wrap and it turned out Perfect!!!  Excellent recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, except using 3/4 c of sugar and 3 tbsp cocoa per other reviews. Baked it in an 8x5" glass dish, loosely topped with a plastic lid. I had trouble getting it to cook evenly; a big chunk on one side was still raw after 4 minutes, while other parts were getting overdone. The flavor is good, but the texture was not like regular cake, more like a cakey brownie - very dense and grainy. I think a thin dark chocolate glaze would've soaked in and made it nicer, but regular buttercream frosting wasn't bad, and it was best without any frosting at all.

I used 3/4c. sugar as recommended . . . maybe a bit sweet, would do less next time.  For a plain chocolate cake, I would try maybe 3 Tablespoons Cocoa Powder next time.    *I also did a batch with 2 mashed bananas and mini chocolate chips mixed in.  That was super great!

Just made this cake and it was phenomenal! I divided the recipe into three because I didn't want too much, just enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. Ended up with this moist, tasty chocolate cake. Used brown sugar, non-fat milk, and whole wheat flour. Yum yum!

I used hot cocoa mix instead of cocoa powder.  I doubled the amount and halved the sugar.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe carefully. When I was mixing it, the butter would get creamy.  It was really gross-looking.  I cooked it anyway (took 2 1/2 minutes) and it still looked weird...half of it was rising out of the bowl like a monster.    I tried some and it was very good!  Not much chocolate flavor, so I poured Hershey's chocolate sauce all over it.  That did the trick. It was good, worth trying, but it would be easier to keep some chocolate chips on hand in case of a chocolate craving.

Terrific. The chocolate craving hit, and this fit the bill perfectly. I followed others suggestions and made it a bit sweeter, then while it was warm, I glazed it with a mix of Hershey's chocolate syrup and powdered sugar - about 2 Tbsp. each. Yum.  This is definitely a keeper.

I followed the other suggestions and added the extra ingredients and only had to cook 1 1/2 minutes, it came out perfect. I added  some chocolate chips too and cooked it in a coffee cup.

Really great and really easy.  I added the baking soda as recommended in previous reviews (1/2 tsp), however I kept the sugar the same - but I like my cakes a little less sweet.  For an nice warm spice, add a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon to the batter and drizzle it with hot cocao sauce (cocao powder with  a little hot milk and sugar).

This smelled good but tasted nothing like chocolate cake. It was chewy and had a weird aftertaste. Won't make this again.

This cake is SOOOOO good! My daughter and I are wolfing it down right now! I'm going to have to make it again tonight, so my husband can try it! :) I did alter it a little. I added 1/2 c. of white sugar instead of 1/4, and 3 T. of cocoa instead of 2. I also added a handful of chocolate chips to the batter, and a large spoonful of sour cream. Yum, yum, yum!

I tried this recipe with my senior students who do a college dorm food unit.  I had them mix ingredients in a large ziplock bag and after "squeezing" out  the corner, we baked it in a pyrex pie plate. All five kitchens had a bit of a different way of "measuring", but all agreed it was good chocolate flavor and many commented that it was better than they had expected. We added more sugar and more cocoa powder as was suggested. I am curious as to what others used for the baking dish.

This recipe can also be made in a rice cooker, for those (rare people) who don't have an oven or a microwave. It is great for people with low supplies and facilities!

I enjoyed this cake and it was fun to make it in the microwave. I added 1/2 cup sugar and a total of 1/2 t baking soda as suggested. I placed pecan pieces and chocolate chips on top of the cake before I placed it in the microwave and when I brought it out they were on the bottom and a nice touch.

I like this cake. It turns out well and is easily adaptable. I like it as a peanut butter cake, especially. I just exchange 2/3 of the butter for peanut butter. If I want to leave out the cocoa, I replace it with flour. This recipe works well for me.

Awesome recipe! I didn't have coca powder on hand so I used 1 tbsp of instant coffee (and some hot water to dissolve it in) instead. The cake turned out moist and delicious. I also added close to 1/4c sugar.

Perfect for a quick fix. Only change I made was using 2/3 cups sugar.

Topped cake with fresh strawberries and whipped cream. So good.

I actually thought this was a little rich, and definitely too much for single serving! BUT it was pretty good. I also increased the sugar, and slathered it in chocolate syrup- could be why it was too rich for me!- I will definitely make it again!

I thought this was great. Based on the reviews and my own taste, I added an extra half cup of sugar and an extra heaping teaspoon of cocoa powder, and about a quarter cup of choc. chips. I needed to microwave it for an extra minute because it was gooey in the middle after 2 1/2, but it came out DELICIOUS! Incredibly rich and moist. I can definitely see it with some cool whip on top. I might pick some up later so we can have it for dessert, tonight! Thanks!

Wonderful cake for a midnight craving. Moist, warm, yummy. I did add the extra 1/2 cup of sugar and 1T of cocoa. And as I was out f vanilla extract, I used coconut extract and it is so yummy!

I made this recipe with the recomended variations: 1/2 cup more sugar and 1 tbs more cocoa. It turned out great.  For frosting I mixed  1 cup cream with 3 tbs sugar, 1 tsp vanilla and a little melted chocolate and 3 tbs cocoa and it tastes like ice cream! I will definitely make this again this week!!

I just made this cake, also looking for a way to satisfy my random chocolate cake craving. It was sincerely easy to make but I ended up cooking mine for about 4 minutes. The cake was a little dense and didn't taste amazing or anything. But it was good enough to satisfy my craving along with a glass of milk. I'd make this again for a rainy day, for sure.

I am pretty sure that this was my microwave's fault (good old student housing), but mine turned out like soup with a layer of cake on top after 2 and 1/2 minutes.  Do I wish I'd cooked it longer? HECK NO!  It was the most delicious, gooey thing I have had in a long time.   My chocolate craving was more than satisfied, and my roommates had to finish it off for me.  I took others' suggestions and added the extra sugar and cocoa powder, and it was heaven.  Ten stars.

I made this cake yesterday since we just moved and don't have a stove yet I have no other way to cook than a mircowave. It was great! Much better than I expected. It's dense like a brownie and tasted delicious with chocolate frosting. I used Betty Crocker rich and creamy chocolate. I prefer dense cakes to light airy ones anyway. I did take the suggestions listed and increase sugar. I used 3/4 cup and doubled the recipe for the entire cake, which fit nicely into a square 8x8in pan. My microwave is a little slow so I cooked it for 6 minutes..perfect! This was so easy for someone who doesn't bake often like myself.

This was definitely good for the amount of time and effort it takes.  I LOVE the fact that it is made in the microwave.  I just wish it was richer.  I like a very rich, dark chocolate flavor.  I did use the 3/4 c sugar and 3 tbl cocoa.  I also added in some mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and sprinkled more on top before cooking.  It was very moist -- better than cooking homemade cakes in the oven, how they seem to get dry, especially on the bottom.  Have the milk handy when eating!  I will definitly make this again when I find the house void of all other chocolate. UPDATE: I originally gave this 4 stars, but it was a 5 star breakfast with coffee the next morning!  I left it covered on the counter overnight and the next day it was even better! Not hard as some of the other reveiws said.

Definitely satisfied our chocolate craving. I made it without looking at the reviews first because I was in a rush doing it during commercial breaks while watching TV. I didn't have any whole eggs so I used Egg Beaters. It came out great! It does make a lot even for 2 people. It definitely needed more chocolate flavor so next time I will use more cocoa powder (with extra sugar to counter the bitterness) or melted chocolate. It deserves 5 stars for being so easy, but I took it down 1 star for flavor and texture.

This does what you need it to do at 1 am.  I added the suggestions of using 3/4 cup of sugar and 1 more spoon of cocoa.  It actually has a better than average taste. Will make again.

This is a stellar recipe!  I've made it twice now, once with the amount of sugar specified in the recipe and once cutting the sugar down to my taste and adding some dark chocolate shavings.  (I guess sweetness is a YMMV issue, but I am surprised by the number of people who are putting in a half-cup of sugar or more into this single-serving recipe! It's lovely as written.  Oh, well, as the Scotsman said, it's a good thing we don't all like the same things--think what an oatmeal shortage there would be!.)    I microwaved the first cake to the specified time, and the cake was a tad dry, but that's just my microwave.  The second time I microwaved it for a minute and change, and it was lovely and gooey. Both made lovely cakes, and I can see using them for different things.   The drier recipe will be good when I want to use it as a base for ice cream or straight cream (lightly sweetened heavy cream with brandy or whiskey, yum!), or I can make the moister version when I want pure chocolatey gooiness.    Next I want to experiment with applesauce or prune puree in place of the butter.  Thanks for posting this!

This was really good. I put chocolate chip and butterscotch chips while it was baking and when it was done i drizzled chocolate syrup over it. It was real simple and decadent with the above additions. Thank You!*****I made this again recently and substituted the butter with unsweetened applesauce and it came out so nice. It was really fluffy!

Wow.  Great cake.  Fast, easy, and delicious.  I took others' advice and used 1/2 cup sugar, 3 tbsp cocoa and 1 tsp baking powder.  I also used margarine instead of butter and rice milk instead of cow milk.  It's almost a different recipe.  Hehe.  I baked it 3 1/2 minutes in my microwave and it came out perfect.

This cake is wonderful for a late night snake.  It is not very sweet, so I simply added 1/2 cup of sugar and 1 TLBS. of cocoa.  After doing so, this is a cake I will make time and time again. Thanks!

Excellent quick chocolate cake. I had a craving for chocolate cake but did not want to go through the mess of making one nor did I want a lot of leftover cake.

I made this cake in my Pampered Chef mixing bowl, cooked it in the bowl, and my husband and I ate it out of the bowl. One bowl no mess & a yummy cake.

I did take the suggestions into consideration and used 1/2 Cup of Sugar and 3T of cocoa. 

Very good ~ I will make this again :)

This was good for a quick chocolate fix, though I would have loved for it to be more chocolatey.  I think I would increase the cocoa powder (and perhaps the sugar) a little if making it again.

I loved this recipe! I live in a college dorm and I am fasting. This made me so happy! The only reason I gave it four stars is because it was a little dry. It is perfect with ice cream though.

Ok, followed the recipe exactly and kept a sharp eye on my microwave.  I got an eggy-tasting brown mess.  Didn't taste good at ALL.  SO, I tried it again at my buddy's house thinking it was my microwave.  Once again, eggy gross-ness.  Can't say I'd recommend this one....

This was great on a hot night when I didn't want to use the oven.  I made it as directed and the sweetness was just right, but I like dark chocolate and not the over-sweetened kind.

This cake was decent. However, it was on the hard side. I might have microwaved it too long. I also think that it is unhealthy to microwave it. In my opinion, it is easier to just steam it for 20 to 30 min. Thanks for the idea.

Not bad for a microwave cake! I doubled the sugar and cocoa, and added some frozen berries on top, delicious.  But I could not seem to flip it over on to another plate so we just ate it out of the bowl! :D

This wasn't "TO DIE FOR...", but it was a great substitute for "the real thing" in a pinch, just after the kids went down, before a movie with hubby.  I used 1/2 cup BROWN sugar and 2 tablespoons Hershey's Dark cocoa... it was good!  It did take close to 4 minutes in my full-size microwave - I cooked in a 4 qt size round corningware with the glass lid.  Be careful not to use too much cooking spray if you go that route... way to go, to a pregnant craving mom!  I never created anything this good under those circumstances!  =)

This cake is very good! I was a bit skeptical about it, because of all the bad reviews, but i was pleasantly surprised. But beware, its very hot when it comes out of the microwave, so make sure you use a towel or an oven mit.

Yummy!  I don't consider myself a 'baker' but this was so easy and yummy.  I followed some of the reviews and increased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and used coffee instead of milk.  I also made chocolate butter-cream frosting to go on top (butter, powdered sugar, vanilla-creamed till smooth).  It took closer to 4 minutes in my microwave but it came out moist, chocolatey and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I have to try this one again because I microwaved the heck out of it. I tested with my trusty cake tester and continued microwaving until it came out clean. This is NOT the way to do it. My cake looked beautiful, but turned into a concrete brick. haha. I give the batter 4 stars.

Gets the job done regarding choco cravings but would not say it is fantastic. Like others I increased the sugar from 1/4 to 1/2 cup and added more cocoa.

Delicious! I took the reviewer's advice and tripled the sugar and added an extra tbsp of cocoa. It's not "I will never cook in the oven again" good, but it's definitely the best 5-minute cake recipe I've ever had. I baked mine in a ceramic quiche dish. Word from the wise: let this cool twice as long as it says- at LEAST 10 minutes, if not 20. I tried to turn mine out after 5 and the centre didn't come out. Next time I'll let it cool longer and ice it.

My kids are home on yet ANOTHER snow day so we gave this a try. They mixed this up using an extra half cup of sugar and chocolate chips. We divided the batter in half between two coffee cups and microwaved them 3 minutes (little microwave). It was so yummy that I went ahead and mixed one up for myself! Surprisingly good for how fast it and easy it was. Well done!

For a microwave cake it isn't too bad. It was really dense. Maybe because I didn't have any baking powder. Anyhow, it was very chocolately and fast. Great if you're in a hurry. I also added a bit more sugar and cocoa powder.

Being a college student means having no time so this recipe is perfect! It's quick and easy and tastes good. I would have given it 5 stars except I had to tweek it a bit. I added 1/2 cup sugar as many people recommended which still wasn't quite sweet enough so the next time I made it, i threw in a hand full of chocolate chips and it made all the difference. If you make the whole recipe though, it's very large. I make about 1/3 of the portion each time and it makes a large soup bowl full already. Saying that, since I didn't make the full portion, the microwave time is much less. I cooked it for 2.5 mintues and it became a rock. For 1/3 of the portion, 1.75 minutes is plenty. It also rises quite a bit so remember not to fill your bowl to the top, you need a larger bowl. Don't forget to grease your bowl too.. I had a hard time taking it out when I didn't grease it enough. Other than that, the cake is very yummy and convenient. Will make it again.

Well this is an amazing recipe! Did increase the sugar to 1/2 cup as others suggested and also upped it to 3 TABLESPOONS cocoa and it came out good.  Lets face it, while it may not be the cake you bake for the next birthday party when it's 9:30 at night and you're wondering why you were so virtious and diet conscious at the grocery store and didn't buy ANY chocolate goodies, NADA --- nothing in the house---this quick little cake does the trick and does it quite nicely.

just micro-ed it now.. smells.. very good, used lindtt's orange chocolate thins instead of coco, and put probably a bit more butter then needed.. really really moist... also substituted the egg with bk powder, milk and oil - still waiting for it to cool.. verdict *after 5 minutes* EXTREMELYYYY moist and OOOOoooo so delicious, not for the type that loves sweet, because it has a minor orangy tang to it, and just a little sweet at the end.. yumm! thanks for the reciepe!!!!

Quite nice, Nothing incredible but considering it was amde in the microwave it was quite good. found if it was overcooked by even 30 seconds the bottom became slightly burnt and very soggy so needed to blot it to try it.  Found it quite nice and tasty but would have preferred it there was a stated size to heat it in, even jsut how many cups it should hold would have been great.

This was really good! I did increase the sugar to 2/3 cup per other reviewers and microwaved for 3 minutes (just a microwave variation, I'm sure). Also spread some strawberry preserves on top after it came out of the microwave -- yum yum!! We will definitely be making this again!

This was so fast, easy and decadent. I added the extra sugar (used 3/4 cup total) and cocoa (3 tablespoons total). I just cooked it up in the mixing bowl. Came out like a warm chocolate torte. So good. The cake is way too big for one serving though, makes more like 3 or 4 servings. I don't know how well it keeps (I'm guessing not well) - we ate it all while it was warm. Very yummy.

When you have a chocolate attack, this recipe does the trick.  Eaten right away, this cake is moist and chocolaty, but if left to sit, it will dry out. After reading all the reviews, I made some changes: increase sugar and cocoa and add chocolate chips.  I did use Splenda Blend Sugar (1/4 cup) and dutch cocoa (4 level T.).  The result hit the spot and quelled my chocolate craving...for now! Thanks for the recipe Laura!

I craved a chocy-cake but have no milk or sugar at home.  Not a roblem though: I substituted milk and sugar with philadelhia fat-free cream cheese and a wee bit of water(just to loosen it up) and two stevia-packages (I love sweet, sweet,sweet!).  Use only 1 tbsp of french cocoa too.  Excellent with a tasty strawberry preserve spread on it... No other changes:  I used everything else as the recipe on those webpage prescribed.  I'm very happy to try other variations: coconut or lemon next!!

I had about 1/2 cup of leftover coconut pecan icing in the refrigerator that I wanted to use so when I came across this recipe, I thought the portion would be perfect.  It could not have been better.  I hand mixed all the ingredients in a 2 qt mixing bowl and put it in the microwave.  After about 3 minutes, I took it out and let it set for another 3 minutes.  Since I used the original mixing bowl, I had to use a spatula to loosen the cake around the edges and bottom but it came out fine.  I iced it with my leftover icing and the taste, texture and flavor was just like a store-bought german chocolate cake.  This is not a gourmet cake for company but it a great substitute when you want something sweet.  The cake itself would not have been sweet enough for my tastes but with the icing it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe.

Pretty good!  I'm a big baker, so I wasn't expecting a microwave cake to be so moist.  I followed others' reviews and used 3/4 cups sugar and 3 Tbsp. cocoa, but I think I'll reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup next time.  Nice quick treat that doesn't heat up the house!

It wasn't awesome but not terrible either.  I found the cake too spongy.  My husband enjoyed it but I really didn't.  I'd try playing with the cooking time if I make it again since it might be the microwave not the actual recipe.  The flavor was pretty good though.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I did add the 1TB cocoa and 1/2 c. sugar instead of what the recipe calls for. But really moist and made enough for 3 servings for me. Great chocolate fix! Thanks!

I had one of those "Can't Function Without Chocolate" moments and this cake did just the trick! Reading the recipe I was scared it would be dry as some of these mircowave cakes are, but this wasnt!  I added an extra T cocoa and extra 1/2 C as other recommended and the cake was moist, fluffy, chocolatey and decadent. Will definitely make it again! Hmm but after looking at the Nutrition Facts not TOO soon!

Hit with a chocolate craving the other day, but with little time  I decided to give another microwave cake a try. I have not had the best experiences with those of the cake-in-a-cup variety so I was a little hesitant.  Imagine my surprise to pull this out of the microwave after two minutes and find a decent cake! Have tried it twice so far and has come out beautifully both times. Also added cherries on the second go and finish with a dollop of whipped cream and a drizzle of chocolate sauce.

i have tried 2 variations of this recipe in the last... less than 24 hours ;) ... i had a hard night at work last night! The chocolate flavor is there.. BUT the texture is not... mine have just come out a gummy-rubbery mess. NOT the chocolatly goodness you get from a bake in the oven cake or brownine. Good luck!  ps. the first recipe was one i got in an email... minus the butter and baking soda

First try...made it as the recipe says. It was okay, my very young kids liked it, but it was dry and not chocolatey enough. I only cooked it 2 minutes, but it was very over done. I will try again, with a little extra sugar, extra cocoa, and only cook it 90 seconds. Better to be moist and gooey than had and tough!

The most fun part of this recipe was watching it bake in my microwave. That part was cool as heck. But the actual cake was pretty flavorless. We ended up putting ice cream and hot fudge on top which certainly improved it but I still wouldnt make the recipe again as written. Also, recipe seemed a lot closer to two servings than one.

This recipe is amazing - my friends still can't believe I can make such a good moist cake in the microwave! I follow the previous suggestions and doubled the cocoa powder and sugar. However, it's still not as chocolaty as I usually like, so I think I'll add some melted chocolate next time. I made this with chocolate fudge sauce, and in 15 minutes I had a great dessert. It's  perfect stodge for my Scottist winter! Definately a keeper when I don't have time to cook or pre-heat the oven.

This recipe was amazing. Although I did have to double it to make it big enough for a family of 4 (with two teenagers). I added an extra half a cup of sugar, an extra half tablespoon of cocoa and a decent handful of milk chocolate melts to the doubled recipe. The cake was sensational, we preferred to eat it warm so the melts stayed gooey and the cake was softer. All in all, this cake was a great success in our house hold (it was gone within a couple of hours)

this has got to have 5 stars just for the ease of it. Decadence in 5 minutes!  I had to make a few adjustments because I didn't have eggs on hand. I shouldn't admit that I used a 1/4 cup of eggnog since that is all I had.  I had to increase the dry ingredients to compensate and so I also added some instant coffee crystals to mask the eggnog taste. I also added  chocolate chips as others suggested and used 1/2 cup of sugar. A dollop of whipped cream and you're in heaven!

This cake turned out great, unlike a previous microwave cake I had tried (it was dry and tough. It was enough cake for three people though. I used 1/2 cup sugar, 3 TBL cocoa powder and added 1/2 tsp baking soda. I sprinkled the top with choc. chips which sank to the bottom making it a bit harder to get the cake out of the pan. Also my pan was a bit too small so it over flowed a small amount. I am going to continue to tweak this recipe until I get an exact amount to microwave in a coffee cup!

Considering the easy factor, I can't complain!! Yes, I've had better chocolate cake, but never in 1 minute of prep and 3min in the microwave!!
Taste was just what I needed to curb my sweet tooth.

This recipe deserves more than 5 stars!!  WOW WOW WOW!!!  I added the extra sugar and cocoa that the others had suggested and made the Nutella frosting - and oh my goodness, this cake was out of this world!!!!  My Mother doesn't really like chocolate cake, but she LOVED THIS!!!!  She couldn't believe how moist it was!!  I will be making this recipe over and over again, and sharing it with family and friends.  Thanks so much for a FAB FAB recipe!!!!!! :)

I give it 5 stars, as adjusted.  Per other reviewers, I added extra sugar, about 1/3 cup more than called for.  I also think it is good to play with time / container size/shape.  With that said, it gave me the exact chocolate fix I wanted from the ingredients I had on hand.

This probably isn't the best tasting cake I've made, but it's so quick and easy I had to give it 5 stars. If you make up a simple icing to go with it it's great for a fast dessert.

this was pretty good. I added 1/2 cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp baking soda. I think i might have put it in the microwave for 30 secs too long and so it became dry. I did add pecans. It was yummy for microwaved cake.

I added sugar and cocoa powder as suggested and this still came out tasting flour-y. The consistency was good, though. With nutella and a glass of milk, I enjoyed it, but I couldn't handle it plain.

As I was making this I expected it to be not so good, but it was surprisingly good. Not like a cake from a high end bakery, but better than a cake mix cake (I hate cake mix cakes). The texture was a bit off--a little spongy, but the taste was fine.
Also, I halved the recipe (I could tell it would make more than one serving) and made it healthier--light butter, skim milk, Splenda.

I'm rating this a 5 because it met all my expectations. I didn't expect it to taste as good as my cakes baked in the oven.  I did add a little bit more sugar and less cocoa as advised. Next time I'll not lessen the cocoa.  Thinking I might try leaving the cocoa out sometime and adding lemon juice (reducing the milk a little).
It's just great when you need an emergency dessert, Serve with some strawberries or peaches, yum.

This was disgustingly easy! It was amazing, and so fast! I had no idea that anything like this was even possible. I used some of the suggestions posted by other people and used 3/4 sugar (altogether) and 3 tbsp of cocoa. It was really good, especially if your just craving chocolate carbs! Next time I think chocolate chips would take it out of this world!

I tried a revised version of this recipe, and needless to say, I would rather eat a chocolate cake from an EasyBake oven.  It didn't even smell good.  Maybe the original is better, but I won't be trying it anytime soon.  A microwave cake sounded too good to be true, and it was.

Ok seriously, microwave cake?  I was definitely skeptical, but needed a quick fast treat.  Made this tonight and it was good.  Sort of tasted like a cakey homemade brownie, not very fudgy.  Put in a total 3/4 C. suger per other reviewers, and served with whip cream.  Yumm and super quick!

Flavor-wise, this is a 3 1/2... convenience-wise, this is a 6.  I took the advice of others and added just under 1/2 c. extra sugar.  I think I'll add a little less next time, however, maybe enough to total 1/2 cup.  I added 1/3 c. chocolate chips but will decrease to 1/4 cup.  Although the addition makes it taste good, it makes it rather sludgy.  I agree with another reviewer that the cake itself was not chocolaty enough.  I will be doubling the coca powder next time... and there will be a next time.  I think I shall make this once a month to cure my chocolate craving!

Perfect quick chocolate cake treat, very moist! I added another 1/4 cup of sugar and had to stir to mix the butter in after 1min in the micro. I too added another 30sec or so to the microwaving. I can't wait to make this for my husband - he loves chocolate cake! Great with ice cream.

I loved this cake. It is so handy to have something I can make real quick during late night sweet tooths. I too added a little more sugar to this recipe after reading some of the reviews but used a half splenda half sugar blend to cut down on carbs. It came out really good and was more than enough for two to share.

I made this the way the recipe said, and it was far from being sweet enough. I should have used the 3/4 cup sugar like other reviewers stated. I added some caramel sauce for the extra sweetness and it was quite good. I'll try it with more sugar next time, but all in all, it's a pretty good little cake thats quick and perfect for a craving.

This cake is DELICIOUS! I add more melted, unsalted butter, whole milk, and an egg.
It increases prep time, but I use 2 mugs, one for the wet ingredients, one for dry. Then add wet to dry mug.
YUMMY!

This is sooooo good! The crumb on this cake is very delicate, and the cake itself is very moist! I cooked mine in the same bowl that I mixed it in.  I estimated all the ingredients so you don't have to be extremely precise. Also, I did part egg nog, and part almond milk instead of the 1/4 c. of regular milk.  The egg nog definitely gives it extra flavor! Finally I topped it with powdered sugar! Delicious!!!

Loved this recipe. Very quick & easy. Cake was so moist & soft. As suggested by other reviewers, I just added more sugar (1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup). Must try.

Kind of took the recipe and did it our way. Didn't use salt of baking powder but it did seem to need 4 mins at 900w not 2 as it was still wet. Now to taste it!

I love this recipe! I didn't really change any of the basics, but I used Special Dark cocoa powder and threw in a handful of dark chocolate chips. I think my glaze probably countered the not sweet enough problem some reviewers were having. After microwaving for 2 1/2 minutes, I poked a bunch of holes in the top and poured glaze over it. Glaze: 1 Tbsp Special Dark cocoa powder and enough milk and powdered sugar to get the right taste and consistency. I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

I like it, being dairy free I substituted the butter for coconut oil and the milk for almond milk! It has a nice chocolate coconut flavor! ?? I also added an extra 1/4 c of sugar like the other commenters suggested after I tasted the batter!  It turned out to be yummy and makes a great 1-2 person cake ! Will make it again

Hi... thanks a lot for this recipe. I made the cake for mu husband's bday...  and since I didn't have cocoa powder in hand .. I added just vanilla... i added a little coffee powder to the batter....  and the remaining just as given in the recipe.. 2 1/2 minutes and the cake was done..
It tasted nice... the slight coffee taste was indeed a treat.. husband and kids are happy... and so am I. ..??

I've made this many times.  I do add 1/4 cup more sugar, but it always turns out great!  I've baked it in the oven and microwaved it. If I have more time and it is for someone special, I'll bake it instead.

Great recipe. I had to microwave it for an extra 10 seconds, but it turned out good. Also, I used chocolate milk, which made it taste more like chocolate.

I enjoyed this recipe…with a few changes. I added another 1/2 cup of sugar, another heaping tablespoon of cocoa powder and an extra egg. Oh, I also threw in a handful of chocolate chips.  It took 3 minutes in my microwave and was awesome hot from the oven.

Would not like to make again.
Not upto the expectations..sweetness was too less to satisfy the taste buds.
Atleast 3/4th cup sugar needs to be added.

I love this cake! I doubled the recipe and am still not sure of the cooking time though. So far 4 is real dry and 3 minutes is a bit dry still. 2.5 looks real wet when you take it out.

I followed others suggestions to increase the sugar to 3/4 C. and the cocoa to 3 T., but it still wasn't chocolatey or sweet enough for me; however, my husband liked it, and it was easy to make so I still gave it a good rating.

I gave it a 3 stars because cooked all the way it isn't worth making, but if I had listened to one of the reviews and not cooked it as long, in order to leave it gooey, it would have been delicious. I know this because the very center of the cake when cooked as long as the recipe calls for was gooey goodness and I wished I had listened as I threw the dry part away. Also, it didn't come out of the bowl in one piece, even though I sprayed in thoroughly. More like 7 pieces. I won't try this recipe again. I'll just bake a cake in the oven as the prep work seemed to be about the same. I will mention that I made the proper adjustments - heaping 1/2 cup of sugar and 3 tbsp. of cocoa.

A fun cake.  I also added an additional 1/2 cup of sugar and additional 2-3 Tbls of cocoa pwdr. I think adding chocolate chips as some reviewers mentioned would be awesome too, but I didn't have any.  Next time!!!  Split the batter in two and cooked in two extra large coffee cups for 2 1/2 min.  Came out great... more like a brownie and very tasty!

Chocolate Cake in less than 8 minutes, just as advertised. I added 1/3 cup of sugar, doubled the vanilla, added an extra tablespoon of dutch cocoa, and added a few semi-sweet chocolate chips. It tasted good and had a good texture, but it didn't look very good. The chips left little chocolaty spots in the cake. It would probably make a good "combat cupcake" on camping trips too.

Like others, I added more sugar and cocoa powder. And I couldn't get a picture because we devoured it, me and 4 of my kids. I used an 8x8 glass square pan and mixed everything in it. Including a little cinnamon. Sprinkled it with just a little bit of mini chocolate chips and microwaved it for 2min 40 sec. It was pretty darn delicious! FYI- the 8x8 pan makes a pretty thin cake ~ 1/2" thick. We just spooned it out.

Great Base recipe! I always half the recipe, for a single serving mug. I added a chocolate caramel in the middle of batter and also sprinkled a little sugar and cocoa over the top and a tablespoon of hot water. It came out a little more moist and flavor then original recipe.

Just tried this after a late night chocolate cake craving... added an extra 1/4 cup sugar and threw in a few chocolate morsels and found it too sweet so will stick to the original recipe next time... and btw, apart from being too sweet, it was fab!!!!  (mind you I was using good ol' Kiwi ingredients!)

Yum!  Not the highest quality cake, but very satisfying.  Doubled the recipe, put into two containers for 'baking'.  Only added 1/2 C sugar, so only 1/4 C per batch extra, and it was a nice, almost dark chocolate flavor.  Kids enjoyed this too.  Thanks!

Per reviews, I also upped the sugar to 3/4 cup and 3 tablespoons cocoa.  Chilled in fridge and iced it with frosting.  Sure tasted like chocolate cake to me!  Just love that I can have my cake and eat it, too, during the hot months when I can't bake in the oven.  Great size for singles or couples.  Will add instant coffee next time for a switch.

Wow.  Definitely surprised!! Made it once.....4 hrs later ....made it again. Changed it up a bit due to ingredients on hand and suggestions on sugar amount on other reviews.  Used 3/4 c splenda instead of sugar, no vanilla,  and 3-4 tbsp nesquick instead of cocoa. Then, when adding to cooking bowl, 1/2 mixture then 2-3 tbsp Nutella then rest mixture.  Cook. Meanwhile,  I heated a pan on the stove top and toasted some coconut.  It was amazing! !! Husband doesn't eat dessert and he had plenty ....both times(didn't know it was splenda either )

Absolutely delicious! I've made microwave cakes before, and I didn't know whether to waste my time or not, because they've never really been good, but I just had to let you know, these really are good. Followed changes most have made and  turned out great after just over one minute. Thanks, Laura

I am a big fan of chocolate. I always crave for muffins with a cup of tea. Yesterday I was searching for a quick and easy cake recipe and came across this one. At first when I was preparing the batter I thought it won't be so good, didn't have cocoa powder so used milo powder instead and melted some snickers and mixed in a mixture and used veg oil not butter. I had to microwave it for 2 and half minutes and it was ready but still lil bit uncooked when I turned it upside down. It was good much like a cake but I could taste flour. I ate it half and today I ate the leftover guess what it was better than yesterday not hard at all as written in many reviews and I could taste milo and snickers as well. As suggested I added half cup of sugar but it was lil bit sweet probably because of milo and melted chocolate.Definitely gonna try again with cocoa powder. Thanks for the recipe.

I doubled the ingredients, except for the sugar which I replaced by 1.5 cup of Splenda + 3/4 cup of dry powder milk.  It did not rise much, but it did taste quite chocolatey. I will try more Splenda next time since it wasn't sweet enough for me.  Maybe it's because I change some of the igredients, but I would not call this cake delicious as other reviewers have.  It's OK if you're desperate for chocolate cake but don't want to spend much time on baking.

I just tried this recipe and took the suggestion of adding more sugar and cocoa, and it turned out great. I frosted mine with some store bought frosting and drizzled some chocolate syrup on top and just ate it straight from the bowl. It was like one of those betty crocker microwave cakes but so much better. I can't wait to tell my friends about it!

I was looking for a version of the "Warm Delights" avaiable now.  I followed the advice of others before me, and used 3/4 cup of sugar and an extra Tbls. of cocoa.  I found it a bit too sweet, but ate every bite of it.  My husband and I did enjoy the treat with a touch of hot fudge and ice cream.  This recipe will be added to my favorites!  (This is more than enough for 2-3 people!)
