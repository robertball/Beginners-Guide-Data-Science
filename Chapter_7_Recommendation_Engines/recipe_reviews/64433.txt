This was pretty good. I like the idea. I might experiment with it a little bit to incorporate some maraschino cherries. It was a little sweet and just needed a little something else. I may make it again. Gets better as it sits. Needs to be really cold.

Made a very flavorful dessert.  I would, however, cut down the amount of sugar in the frosting next time.
