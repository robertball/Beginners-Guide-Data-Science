I used butter instead of margarine and that was the only change I made. This was super simple and packed a LOT more flavor that I anticipated. I really thought I would need to add some seasoning but it was good as is. I think the addition of bacon would bump this one from a 4 to a 5.

Along with the ingredients listed I blended in small diced new potatoes and chopped Italian tomatoes, topped the bowl with cilantro leaves, sliver grated Monterrey Jack cheese, before serving I dusted the bowl with cayenne pepper  for added visual texture and colour. 
Next I'll try adding leeks with the potatoes and substitute the cilantro leaves fresh leek green leaves,

Instead of a potato masher... I blended it in small batches in the blender. Other than that, I followed the recipe as written, but stirred in some shredded cheese at the end and topped with crumbled bacon. It was very good.

The first time I made this recipe was according to the directions.  Although really good, I wanted my soup a bit more spicy.
The next time I made a few changes:  two chopped onions, two cloves minced garlic, a few more potatoes, I used (Embasa brand) canned jalapenos, about a full cup with some of the juice (approx 2 Tbsp). 
I had a couple stalks of celery I diced and sauteed with the onions which added a bit more texture to the soup. 
Add some crunched up  Fritos and shredded cheese on top before serving. MMMMmmm good!

Really good recipe. I doubled it and used soy milk instead of
condensed. I used a bit extra jalapenos and added some hot sauce as well. Also I cut the salt in half. Will definitely make it again.

Overall the recipe is really good. The only change I made was to use vegetable broth instead of chicken as I am vegetarian. It did make the soup a darker color but we all thought it was good. I didn’t go all out in mashing up the potatoes which was also fine. We did add grated sharp cheddar cheese to it.  Next time I will use a bit more jalapeños because we like it spicy.

A five star meal. We all loved this. I served with tortilla chips and it was a big hit. My husband says this is a keeper. Ans so inexpensive and great flavor with so few ingredients. You did good.

Really excellent.  We like it hot so I was liberal with the jalapenos.  Worked fine.  Only change I'll make next time is that directions call for WAY too much salt .  Maybe it's a misprint but I'd cut the salt back to less than half what's called for.

Delicious. The only change was I added a large sweet potato in addition to the regular amount of potatoes and I added extra jalapeños because we like hot.  Leftovers taste awesome in lunches.

Really good! Followed the recipe except I left the skins on the potatoes, used very little salt and added bacon bits. It was delicious! A little goes a long way...very filling!

This is a perfect cold weather soup! I added some bacon bits and a little cheddar cheese to top it off. Served with some crusty bread, very delicious!
