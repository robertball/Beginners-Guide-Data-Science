Loved the simplicity and flavor of these sweet potatoes. The measurements are perfect. It was dark outside already so I just baked the sweet potatoes in the oven while I was baking another dish. Will be making these again and on the grill as directed. Thank you for the recipe!

Cooked in air fryer with small splash of olive oil. No salt needed and added turmeric. Used fresh crushed garlic instead of powder.

These are delicious! The spice mixture brushed on at the end is perfect. Amazing taste. A nice alternative to the baked sweet potato! Thanks France C.!
