I was afraid this would be too lemony, but it was great!

This will be on our table again and again!!  I LOVE the bright citrus, the salty dressing, the peppery arugula and the creaminess of the potatoes.  I'm a non-potato-salad-girl, converted.

5 stars all the way! This is fancy enough to serve to guests yet easy enough to serve every day. The only change I made is that I used an arugula mix because arugula by itself is hard to come by in my area and I thought I had white balsamic but I must have used it up on something else and had to resort to dark. Regardless, this recipe was the bomb! Grill you up some chicken or steak and you have a complete meal all in one. One word. Excellent!

10.4.16  One word to describe this salad...AWESOME!  Followed the recipe exactly as written, and I wouldn’t change a thing.  Seriously, it’s really that good, and I wouldn’t hesitate to serve this to company.  You get a little tang from the mild white balsamic, have just a hint of the cumin and other layers of flavor, and that coarsely-chopped pickled lemon just takes the dressing over the top.  I found everything in this salad expertly balanced, and loved the tartness of the dressing.  Do mix the dressing with warm potatoes because it will then infuse and soak into the potatoes.  This unique and bright potato salad was enjoyed today for lunch and would be a spectacular dish for a gourmet brunch (actually, this would be spectacular ANYTIME)!
