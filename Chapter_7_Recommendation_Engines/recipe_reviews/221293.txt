Like others I had a whole lot of skepticism about a quesadilla without cheese, but with wife on a vegan kick I thought I'd give it a try.  It was delicious and cheap!  The texture wasn't quite the same as with cheese, but it wasn't unappealing or weird like some vegan recipes.  I think the nutritional yeast really gives it a earthy yet cheese like flavor, infinitely better than "Vegan Cheese"

Anyway, added a diced Jalapeno with the black beans, also added 1-1 1/4 cup clack beans instead of 1/2 cup. I should of added the whole can though, wouldn't of hurt anything.

Will surely make this again!

WOW! I don't normally like and rarely (never) love anything with the word Vegan in it, but these were incredible. I increased the tomatoes slightly, but that's just because I have an addiction. 
Thanks DownHomeCitySisters!

These were amazing! I added some chopped yellow bell pepper and spread avocado on one of the tortillas. Hint - get the tortillas really crunchy...mmmmm for sure having these again.

This was a delicious recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly and served it with salsa and vegan sour cream.  My husband who is a meat and cheese lover even raved about this recipe.  We will definitely be making this again.

Changes for future: one can diced tomatoes, use 3/4 of the can. Cook over low-medium heat (“3”) to achieve the cooking times listed (10/3 minutes). Use 1/2-3/4 cup filling per 8” tortilla. Add yeast as needed. I just mashed the northern bean mixture. Replaced cayenne with red pepper flakes. A little bland. Serve with guacamole.

I very much dislike nutritional yeast, but decided to give this a try because of the rave reviews from meat eaters. I'm glad I did! Even my husband, who actually scoffed at me, went back for seconds.

i was really nervous about the yeast, but it came out great! makes for a good snack or meal.  didn't have a food processor but i used my blender and the paste came out fine with prescribed ingredient quantities. next time i will use less ingredients, as i had quite a bit left over once i had used up the tortillas. thanks for sharing :)

These were delicious and I'm not even vegan!  I don't have a food processor so I just mashed the beans and tomatoes in a pan with a potato masher and that worked very well. Served with salsa and these were a big hit.  I'll definitely make these again. Great recipe, and really easy!

We really didn't like these at all.. We are vegan so we are used to cheeseless quesadillas as we make them quite often. I think we had high expectations based on all of the 5 star reviews. Also, the ingredients indicate 1/4 cup tomato's but in the directions it indicates 3/4 cup?

I really liked the filling. I didn't think it was too spicey. The cooking times were too long and the temp did seem a little too high but I will be making this recipe again!  Just need to adjust temp and cook time. Very Good!!

I'll admit I wasn't sure about a quesadilla without cheese but I so glad I tried this. The nutritional yeast adds great flavor. Served with pico de gallo. Thank you DownHomeCitySisters.

Wow! So good! I'm on a vegan diet for a bit and found this recipe and I am impressed! I was a bit worried because of the one bad review but I needn't be! 
I made this and it turned out great! I burned my first quesadilla but the filling was so good that I was still able to enjoy the burnt one! 
I switched to way less oil and cooking coconut oil for my other tortillas. 
Other modifications:
I used 10" tortillas and because of that I put half a cup of filling instead of the 1/4th cup. That was a good amount. More was too much. 
I also, added more black beans to the recipe. About 1/4th cup more.
I made 3 quesadillas with the 10" tortillas but I could have made 4 if I had rationed the filling properly.

These were a huge hit with the whole family, and I'm about to make them again right now. I used black beans in place of the Great Northern because that's what I had on hand. My family (aside from myself) eats cheese,  but no one asked for it or missed it. These are a new fam fave!

These turned out great! My partner and I both loved these, and I've put this in my "good-for-omnivore-company" recipe folder. Actually, I'm trying to decide who to invite over so I have an excuse to make these again. Not sure why someone gave one star because hers burned, as that is not a reflection on the recipe.

The quesadilla burned before anything became hot inside.  The bean mixture is delicious but we simply used a tortilla, heated it separately and made a toco style burrito instead of a burned not hot quesadilla.

Nom. Nom. Nom. I found this by accident, but it sounded so good that I had to try it. I didn't have any nutritional yeast (nor do I know what it even is lol), so I left out the yeast, then added some chicken and cheese. So yummy. Only things I noticed different about the directions is that I used more than 1/4 cup to "fill" the tortilla, and I also only had to cook a "few" minutes (not 10, as suggested). Will be making this again very soon.

Oh. My. God. Yep, that's what people say when they put these quesadillas in their mouths. My only addition was agave nectar to sweeten the mixture up a bit! We grilled them and everyone absolutely LOVED them. I will make these many, many times again. Woohoo!

I didn't have tomatoes, skipped the yeast, more than quadrupled the garlic and added a lot of cheese (no longer vegan, I know), I was really surprised at how good this was! Very simple. Very delicious!

This was SOOOOOO good! I omitted the black beans altogether as I didn't have any on hand (somehow!), but the combination of the great northerns, tomato, spices and nutritional yeast was perfect. This was super yummy and super easy. I served with some sliced avocado. Highly recommended!

These were really yummy!  I had sour cream and salsa on hand but I would love to try these with guacamole. Are used one whole tomato I cut all the pulp and seeds and set that aside and chopped up the firmer part of the tomato and threw it in the food processor the rest I added to the filling as I mixed in the black beans and it was good

I had to add a little bit of corn starch to thicken it up as the tomatoes made it a little too runny.

It was good, but it was really liquidy so I couldn’t get it to stick like a quesadilla does. I maybe did it wrong. This was my first time using a food processor.

Made this on our Daniel fast diet and it was very good. NUtritional yeast didn’t really give a cheese flavor, but it was still good :-)
Thanks for the recipe!

I really like the taste. it was very delicious. But I don't think it works as a quesadilla for me. next time I'll make it with some rice in a burrito or use it as a bean dip

It was pretty good. The filling turned out a little too liquidy, maybe my tomatoes were super juicy, so I had to add 2 tbsp of bread crumbs, and 1 tbsp of tapioca flour to thicken it up a bit. I also used whole wheat tortillas and coconut oil spray. Once on the pan, I also added vegan cheese dailya cheddar. Topped with home-made salsa, avocado and vegan sour cream. Turned out delish!

Yes!! I loved it! Kept to the recipe except I substituted pico for the dice tomatoes. I also used the tortillas in the pic versus the ones suggested. I also turned the heat down to medium heat versus med high heat. That way the tortillas don’t burn.Overall good dish!! I will make it again!

These were a big hit for both Vegans, Glutten intolerant and even the regular folk.
I added, one finely chopped Jalepeno, and about a cup of fresh corn.
Also some shredded Soya chedder and Soya mozzerella.
Just a little as the nutritional yeast has enough of a cheesy flavour.

Very tasty. We made this as a meal during our Daniel fast. Worked well and was well-liked. The recommendation to serve with guacamole was spot-on as you need a little green to go along with it.

Delicious! I followed another reviewer and added the whole can of black beans. I put some Dayia pepper  jack shreds (fake cheese I bought at Sprouts that melted very nicely) right on top of a whole grain tortilla in the pan first, then added the spread and another tortilla on top. Definitely a recipe I am keeping and using again! Thank you!

Yum! I used a whole can of black beans and tomatoes, and cooked the quesadillas on med-low with a thin coat of spray oil to get them nice and crispy. We dipped them in vegan sour cream and they were soooo good. I had some filling left after making enough for dinner, so I saved it, and it was even better the next day. This is the first time I've made anything vegan(on purpose), and first time using nutritional yeast and vegan mayo. I was pleasantly surprised, and will make them again for sure.

This was great! I did not have nutritional yeast but they turned out fine, actually wonderful.  I forgot to add the cayenne pepper which is possibly why it felt like it was missing something, an extra kick. I did add sautéed onions which I think made them better :)

This review is for the 'cheese' spread only. I had some corn chips and salsa leftover from a recent trip to the Mexican restaurant. I wanted something a little different to serve with them and found this recipe for the 'cheese' spread. It made the spread as written except left out the cayenne. It was fast and simple to put together. I would not say that it was cheesy tasting at all but it was ok and made a good dip with chips and salsa. The four rating is an average of '3' for flavor and '5' for ease of preparation.
