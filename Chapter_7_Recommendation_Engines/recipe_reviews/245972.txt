I've never had meatless taco salad before so this was a nice switch.   I found that the rice, while wonderful on it's own, didn't have enough flavor to carry the entire dish, so I ended up adding a little more seasonings.

I made this for dinner last night and forgot to buy the spanish rice, so made my own. It turned ok but will be adding more spices to it. I did find some taco shell bowls to use instead of the tortillas and we loved it.

I really liked the taco bowles. Although I did spray the tortilla and the bowel with butter flavored cooking spray before putting  in the microwave so it didn't stick to the bowel. That also gave a bit more flavor and moisture to the tortilla. I will definitely make  again.

I liked the recipe and always read the reviews. I purchased the taco bowl molds and googled how to use them. It said 375 for 15 minutes. I was tickled when they came out perfect,  or so I thought. I bought the yellow corn tortillas and the cooking instructions said to use them at room temp.  When I took them out of the mold, after cooling for 2 minutes, I immediately put in the lettuce, rice mixture, cheese and sour cream. The tortilla bowls were hard to break and hard to chew.  I thought they would  break like chips. What did I do wrong? I made another batch and left them in 10 minutes, same result. I love this idea but want to eat the bowls, not just use for show. Any comments would be greatly appreciated.

This recipe fell a little short for me. The tortilla bowl was not as crisp as I would have liked. The rice was great on its own but when added to the salad it got lost. This recipe as written needs a good salsa to carry the dish for flavor.

This recipe would make a nice Meatless Monday meal.  I agree with another reviewer that it lacked the spicy kick that my husband and I prefer.  For that, I simply stirred in a couple Tbsp Hot sauce to the mix before assembling the salad.
I have a confession to make....  I tried to make the shells out of the flour tortillas and they were a disaster so I used tortilla chips for the bottom of the bowl.  Turns out, my husband actually love it that way!
Next time, I will try adding some chicken or beef to it, but really, it's just fine like it is.
I served mine with chopped avocado, sour cream, cilantro,  and a squeeze of lime.  Delicious!

This is a nice base for a meatless option. I'm a carnivore so next time I plan on adding some fajita chicken strips or steak strips.
