Made this tonight! was very pleased! Easy and had all ingredients on hand. Pouring the gravy over the finished chicken does the trick!! I would even suggest when chicken is done, just let lt it soak in a pan in the gravy!

VERY GOOD!  This definitely had a crunchy texture to it.  I used a zip-lock bag to coat the chicken which made it so easy to make.  The flavor was excellent.  Thank you Campbell's Kitchen for another VERY GOOD recipe!

I had to admit I was skeptical. This turned out amazing. My husband took one bite and his eyebrows went up in surprise. Even my 3 year old happily ate it. I did make my own chicken gravy though, but the flavor is very closed to the jar version. Definitely a keeper. Didnt change any of the ingredients and it was perfect.

I love southern fried chicken and this easily comes in a great second - without the calories. Followed the recipe using whatever stuffing at hand (chicken). Wouldn't change a thing.

This is a delicious and easy meal to prepare. The stuffing mix is seasoned well and the addition of parmesan cheese into the mix adds a nice punch of flavor. I put the stuffing called for in a plastic baggy and rolled with a rolling pin to crush. I made my own gravy using Swanson Chicken broth and have no doubt that the gravy called for in this recipe would be equally as good. I used non-stick foil and did not feel the need to use the melted butter called for. The breading stayed crisp and did not get soggy. I can not think of a reason why I would use bread crumbs again when this worked out so well.

Loved this and my hubby loved it too.  I didn't have the gravy (thought it was in the pantry but realized late it wasn't) but the chicken was so juicy and tender that it wasn't missed.  Also, I didn't have on hand the Pepperidge Farm Seasoned Stuff but I did have Private Selection Parmesan Herbs Bread Crumbs and it worked fine.  Very easy recipe.  Prep time is minimal and since I had super thick chicken breasts I needed 30 mins cook time instead of the 20 listed.  So yummy.

I originally planned to fry chicken chicken strips, but realized that I had no oil or flour lol! So in looking for an alternative to fried chicken, I found this recipe. All of the ingredients were in my cupboard and it was really easy to make. I omitted the gravy and served it with a side of Spanish beans and rice. The flavors went really well together and the chicken came out nice and crunchy. This recipe is fast,versatile and yummy!!

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe. It almost sounded too simple to be this flavorful! Hubby kept commenting how good it smelled as it was baking and with his first bite he said "YUM!"  The outside got nice and crispy and the crushed stuffing gave it a delicious flavor. I served it with roasted sweet potatoes and it was almost had a Thanksgiving dinner vibe.

This was absolutely wonderful and so easy! I've been trying to find some quick easy meals for my family. This one definitely fit the bill. I have a 3 yr old and 1 yr old who both gobbled this up in no time. Not to mention my husband who loves stuffing so I really couldn't go wrong with this meal. Had a great tasted and I made it exactly as directed.

Easy to make and a big hit! Had some last minute dinner guests and they thought I had been cooking for a few hours to make this. Was easy and had a TON of taste. Great/easy dinner.

This is good.  Simple.  Inexpensive to make, few ingredients.  Wasn't sure about the thickness of my chicken breasts with the short baking time and high temps, but came out perfect.  I threw the rest of the stuffing mix in a pan with less water, less butter than called for and was able to get rid of the remaining stuff mix and had a side dish.  This was fixed day after Christmas, I am exhausted, used the already made mashed potatoes in the refrigerated section of the store that just get microwaved, steamed some brussel sprouts and boom!  Dinner was done.
