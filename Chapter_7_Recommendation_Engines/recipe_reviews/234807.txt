Delicious! Beautiful red color. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I used 3/4 C milk and 3/4 t lemon juice and let stand for 10 minutes to make sour milk. These were a tad--just a tad--dry to me. Hence, the four stars. But (huzzah!) I got more than just a dozen cupcakes out of this recipe. I made 1 dozen regular sized cupcakes and another half dozen mini cupcakes. So, not many over the mark, but just enough to make us extra happy. :) Great recipe! It's scrumptious.

I'm not a fan of red velvet to begin with, after reading reviews I thought I would give it a try& I'm not impressed. It's not vanilla and its not chocolate, it really has no taste at all. Yes, its a light flavour, but why consume so much red dye and have nothing to show/taste for it.

This was delicious. I can't remember if I doubled or tripled the recipe (which, I now realize was a horrible plan as things never mix well when you have too much of it). I ended up working it in batches, and it turned out wonderful and moist. Best red velvet recipe yet!

I have descovered my passion. Baking. Have tried a few cupcake recipes, but this one is now my go to cupcake recipe. So much so that for my wedding, i eneded up buying a small cake to have on top, and bellow about 80 cupcakes made by me. Most of my guests didn't even know they were home made. They were tastey, the right amount of moisture. I have garnished them with a white chocolate frosting. The taste complemented eachother perfectly. THANK YOU for this great recipe.

I made these for Valentine's Day and they were a big hit. Nice and moist. The only change I made was with the food coloring. Since I was using a gel food color I knew that a tablespoon would be too much so added it to the batter a little bit at a time until I got the color I wanted. Would definitely make them again.

these cupcakes were good, but not exceptional. i made them and tried one. it was good, but not as sweet as a cupcake should be. it was still better than box mix though. i gave one to my brother and he said it tasted like regular bread. a tip to anyone making any red velvet recipe: use apple cider vinegar instead of regular vinegar. it adds a bit more flavor to the cupcakes. overall, it was okay but just okay. chef john disappointed me. his recipes are usually a lot better.

I surely cannot understand these reviews, some say these are super moist and others say they are dry! What in the world!!! It has to be something they are doing wrong and not saying it. I think theyâ€™re great! Made as written except had to sub on the buttermilk since I had none, just used the old standby mixture of white vinegar and whole milk!!! No problems at all. Thanks for the recipe Chef John.

I've tried a few red velvet cupcakes recipes and this one is my favourite! The cupcakes had a nice flavour and were spongy and moist. Wouldn't change a thing!

It was just perfect.My not-a-cupcake-fan 8yr old loved it so much. He even made the creamcheese frosting by himself and decorated the cupcake for his red nose day school bake sale.

Made it exactly  as given , only used lemon juice instead of vinegar.  The aroma while baking kept us impatient,  Did not disappoint they turned out light & fluffy and were over as soon as i took them out of the oven. Delicious.  Going to save this recipe & will surely make again.

It was good, except I ended up with only 8 cupcakes, due to the insufficient amount of liquid or batter as a whole. I actually cut all the sugar amounts by one half, as I always do. But this time, it seems he sugar amount was just right so my cupcakes ended up a little too unsweet. The recipe was awesome, all except the part where I did not have food coloring or buttermilk. For the buttermilk I simply put 1 tablespoon of lemon juice with 3/4 cups of milk and let it curdle for 10 minutes. The cupcakes turned out brown because i did not put the food coloring. I love it!

Delicious. Left out the red food colouring as a friend of mine said the dye comes out  and makes an unfortunate association I'd just assume skip. Don't let that deter you though. The cake tastes just fine without the food colouring.

This is more of a question for you baking experts! I made these with a lot of substitutions because my nephew is allergic to eggs and dairy, and his mom doesn't eat gluten.
The taste was amazing but the consistency was off.  I am going to try again later with regular flour rather than a gluten free measure-for-measure flour and see if that makes the difference. But in the meantime, can anyone offer some suggestions for egg substitutes?  I substituted 1 tsp baking soda and 1 tbsp white vinegar per egg.   For buttermilk I used 1 tbsp lemon juice and then filled up the rest of one cup with coconut milk & let stand for over 10 minutes.  The consistency before adding the dry ingredients was definitely weird.  Could either of these substitutions be the culprit, and can anyone offer other suggestions to try?
Thanks in advance!
Again, the taste was amazing, and I will review again after making without any substitutions but I am pretty sure it will still be 5 stars!

Excellent! I saw this recipe in the Allrecipes magazine and knew I had to try it.  I normally make a family recipe, which is really good, but requires 2 oz of red food color and nearly twice the ingredients. This recipe did not disappoint. It made a dozen regular and a dozen mini cupcakes. They were the perfect color, texture, and crumb. I will definitely make this recipe again!

My mother in law is the red velvet cake maker in the family.  Her cake is very dense and very red.  After getting her recipe( 1 1/2c of oil?? and one bottle of red dye) I wanted to find some different.  I really enjoyed these cupcakes.  More cocoa than my MIL's and less dye and no oil.  They were a hit! Even my husband said he liked this more than his Mom's

I followed the recipe. I doubled it and made a three layer cake. I just left the coloring out. It turned out great and everybody loved it.

Made recipe exactly except doubled it to fill 2- 9" round cake pans.  Increased cocoa powder to 8 tbsp total.  Baked at 350 for 27 mins.  I'm not a fan of red velvet cake and hoped making this recipe would change my mind but I'd rather have chocolate or yellow cake.  My children do like red velvet and said it was a good recipe.

This came out beautifully moist and delicious.  I made my own frosting. I'll definitely be making this again.

I loved this recipe! It was super fun and easy to make, although there was a lot of ingredients it was a blast to make with my boyfriend. Everyone ate it up super quickly it defiantly didn't last very long at all in my house! Bought to different types of icing to go with the cupcakes vanilla and ceam cheese icing but my boyfriend and I enjoyed the plain vanilla more than the cream cheese icing. Also to finish off our cupcakes we added some red sprinkles that matched the color of the cupcakes, so it both looked and tasted great! Defiantly recommend to anyone who is having a major cupcake craving!

I was super disappointed. Kind of dry and not really dry.
