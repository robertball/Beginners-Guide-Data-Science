I thought theses were great wings, not what i'm used too, but so simple to make and very tasty!!! Not a big fan of using large wings, i'm a drummette kind of girl. Also, I don't think people should be leaving 3 stars for a recipe they have never tried, seems odd to me. Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!

Good.  These don't stand out at first bite, but draw you back for more. I may try a little seasoning salt in the mix next time. I'll try marinating them first next time and maybe reduce the sauce so that it's thicker. I used frozen wings, and ended up with more sauce than I started with. Definitely worth a try if you have kids.

I variate the ingredients just a tad. I use minced garlic, onion powder and just a small dash of season salt. My husband and friends LOVE these. I normally have to make 2 dozen wings worth to satisfy just 2-3 people. Haha.

This is a great recipe with a few modifications.  Most reviewers suggested adding garlic/onion.  I used drumsticks.  I added approx 3 tsp minced garlic, a chopped onion, approx 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp onion powder.  I then marinated them overnight in the mixture.  After laying them out on a foil lined baking sheet, I poured the extra marinade over them.  I baked them approx 25 mins per side.  They cooked through perfectly.  I served these to a group of 15 teenagers and got rave reviews.  They came back for more!  Always a good sign.  Thanks for sharing.

These were delicious, but very sticky! The recipe didn't state whether the wings should be whole or disjointed. I chose to leave them whole. Possibly because of this, I had to cook them about 20 minutes longer. DH wants me to make them again - soon!

These are delicious!  The first time I made these I made them exactly as the recipe says.  They were a little bland so the next time I made them I upped the garlic and added onion powder.  They were very flavorful.  I make them every year for our annual halloween party, my daughters insist:)

Hi There, I m the one who submitted the recipe.  Yes, use the drumette chicken, easy to cut yourself or have your butcher do it.  The longer you cook them, the better they get!! :-)   Enjoy!!!

These are soooooo good.  I made a few changes, but I'm guessing these would taste about the same as is.  I used tenderloins instead of wings, which only require 25 minutes to cook.  I also used fresh garlic (way more than a "dash") and reduced the sauce first.  Delightful!

Easy to make, even when in a hurry. Placed chicken and its marinade together in a 'marinade container' and coated the wings with the marinade 45-minutes. Baked in a cookie sheet turning a bit more frequently to ensure equal coating. Served with rice.

We had these for our Halloween dinner tonight and they were a big hit.  My husband and my kids and I really liked them.  I think I would add a bit more garlic powder next time but other than that they are great!

Made exactly as listed, but marinated for about 3 hours first.  These were amazing, and everyone at the Halloween party loved them.  I agree with others that the flavor isn't intense, but it's addictive!

These turned out great, and disappeared from the bowl! I did modify by only using 3/4 cup sugar, low sodium soy sauce, at least 1/2 teaspoon of garlic and onion powder.  I microwaved the sauce about 1 minute to help the sugar dissolve.  I bought a 4 lbs bag of wings and added the sauce to the bag as it was thawing.  Plenty of sauce!  Thanks for a great recipe!

These wings are amazing! I do suggest seperating the wings before cooking or just buy the ones already seperated. I served with white rice and it was a fabolous meal! The second time I made them I used boneless chicken breast and they were absolutely delicious! My finace loves them and I will be making these again and again!

I made these, and they were yummy.  My husband liked the flavor.  However, it kind of bothered him that the wing tips were included on the wings.  I liked the flavor, but did not feel that it was too friendly for a party since I really did not get much meat from the wings (a lot of bones were left on our plates).  We are having a Halloween Party, and I plan to make the "Baked Teriyaki Chicken" instead since it is more meat with the chicken thighs, and has a similiar, but better sauce to it.  I love the baked teriyaki chicken thighs from this website.  However, the bat wings in this recipe were good too.

I made these last night for dinner after marinating overnight.  Also made them on a baking sheet lined with no-stick foil so cleanup was a breeze.  The only reason there were leftovers was because I was home alone and couldn't eat all 2 pounds myself.  Great with ranch dressing!  I'll definitely make these again!!

I tried this recipe, and changed a few things because I had no soy sauce.  I added teriyaki instead, put in pepper and onion powder, but then only dipped it in the sauce before cooking it.  My family loves BBQ, so after they were done I BBQ's them on broil in the oven.  Even without the BBQ sauce, they were great!  I tried one without the BBQ sauce, and it was wonderful.  I would definitely make this again.

What a simple, easy to make, Great recipe.  I think I will marinate them in the sauce overnight before I cook them in the sauce to enhance the flavor.  I was generous with the garlic powder.  My kids scarfed these up.  I added them as a main dish, and also an appetizer.  I will use this with drumsticks too.  A big hit!

These wings were wonderful, my daughters loved making them! I did use half the soy sauce and replaced the other half with steak sauce. This was wonderful thank you.

I love this recipe! I have made a couple of changes to improve it for my needs. I like to marinade it first. To keep the sauce from separating in the fridge, I lightly heat it on the stove until the sugar dissolves before adding it to the chicken. I will also add a can of crushed pineapple (juice included) to the sauce.

I enjoyed the wings. I added minced garlic and  chopped onions with a little season salt for added flavor as other users suggested. The next time I may marinade the wings in the sauce because the sauce was delicious but it wouldn't really hold to the chicken. I did pour the sauce over my wings and kind of dipped it as I ate. Thanks for the recipe.

This was really good.  I cooked all the chicken parts not just the wings.

These are my "go-to" appetizer recipe - I have made them for family gatherings and major events. Marinate overnight or at least several hours and DO use lots of fresh garlic. Use white pepper for a bit more zing. There are NEVER any "survivors" on the serving platter when serving these, LOL.

My family members and friends love this chicken! It's sticky but sweet, tangy and has that gooey feel where you would just lick your fingers and ask for more. I either added or changed some ingredients for specific groups of people I made the dish for but the chicken still came out great each time.
