EXCELLENT, & without the calories.  The longer it sits, the better it taste, but it is hard to leave alone.  My husband didn't think this recipe would work, but he has made it several times already.  This is easy to make.

This was DELICIOUS!  I made it for a party, and nobody knew that it wasn't "authentic" guacamole.  I used less red pepper flakes, and it still packed quite a punch.  I think I would use even less the next time I make it.  The "heat" seems to grow the longer the dip sits.  I can't wait to make a layered Taco Dip and use this in place of the guacamole.  Try this recipe, you will be pleasantly surprised!

We tried this recipe on Superbowl Sunday, and what a hit it was. Good Stuff! It is sweet with a little bit of a bite. Plus it won't turn dark like guacamole does. It is now our weekend favorite.

Love it! Even my husband liked this and he doesn't really like peas too much. I did add cilantro and a squeeze of lime before serving, which gave it a nice 'pop'. Baked some corn tortillas (sprayed with cooking spray and sprinkled with lime-flavored salt) in the oven to serve with it. So good. Thanks!

I love recipes like this...it's like food science. Guacamole without avacadoo is almost as much fun as making apple pie without the apples(Try the Mock Apple Pie recipe!) After I made it with one cup of peas, I tasted it and then realized that I definitely was going to need more because I got hooked on that flavor. So I just added another half a cup of peas, a ts of water, and just blended again. Perfect, without having to add any more oil. I only used a third ts of cumin, a pinch of chilli powder for the red pepper, and the juice of a whole lime for the lemon juice. While it couldn't replicate guacamole's flavor exactly, it came pretty close, and yet was delicious in its own way. I served it with beef fajitas, which matched it perfectly. I think it would be great on a tortilla with melted monterrey jack. In fact, I'm convinced that some restaurants probably do use this(maybe with a more olive oil to recreate more of that rich flavor) instead of guacomole to save a little money. I just have a feeling I've tried it before. Best part: my family practically licked the bowl.

I thought this was delicious!  And I was able to use the leftovers, mixed with a little tomato sauce, on pasta and pizza; kind of like a pesto.  Very healthy and appealing to the eye too.

ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS!!  I can't believe have good this stuff is!  IT's the only way my husband will eat his peas.  I added 1/2 a jalepeno, a little more onion, more lemon juice, less oil, about 1 c. of cilantro and about 6 grape tomatoes.  I will NEVER go back to avacado guacamole again.

This is a tough one to rate, partially because I'm not sure if our blender is just terrible or if there's not enough liquid in the recipe to blend the peas.  We have a newer blender and I had to add much more EVOO and lemon juice to try to get it to blend and it still really didn't get as smooth as I would have liked it.  It had a nice sweeter taste, but I haven't found what really *wows* me to serve w/it for dippers.  It's def worth trying, though!

For people wanting authentic guacamole taste, try adding about 1/2 cup mashed avocado to this recipe.  Still good tasting without all of the calories.

Whodda thunk?! Peas in guacamole? I was hesitant but game. Now, I've made it dozens of times and it just gets better. Anytime I have forgotten I'm supposed to take a dish somewhere, I whip this up. Buy a bag of chips on the way to the party and presto! It's quick, easy, uses ingredients that I always have on hand, and everybody loves it -- even those who can't imagine nor believe they are eating guac with no avocado!

I always have plenty of frozen peas on hand so I thought I'd give this a try.  
If you're expecting the flavor to be anything close to guacamole (wok-uh-mo-lay), it's not going to be. It's like peeling a delicious tangerine and expecting it to taste like a sweet orange. Both tasty and flavorful but different. Having about a dozen Haas Avocados on hand I added 2 of them very coarsely mashed, some lime zest and juice and little minced cilantro and it was really good. Using basic hummus as a blank canvas I quite often add avocados, or other things, to my hummus and it's always a hit. I've never thought of adding frozen peas though but am going to the next time I make hummus. I actually used a pound of peas so I had enough for experimenting in different directions. I finely diced 2 strips of bacon and fried til crisp, added it and the brown bits from the bottom of the pan along with a dollop of sour cream for taste and creamy texture and had a wonderful pea and bacon dip. This is a keeper and a 5 star recipe. And BTW if you make a large batch, it freezes well in small zip lock bags.

This review could go either way...I'll explain. This is a very very good recipe. The recipes name says it all Sweet Pea Mockamole. While the sweetness of the peas is very present in this recipe, there is the underlining heat from the red peppers, I only used 1/4 tsp. While I liked the sweet and heat, some people may find the sweetness in the peas too much or not to their liking. Like my kids. I find it works for me if I don't have any avocados and can go this route. Thank you for sharing. And I will agree, the longer this sits, the more the flavors meld and the sweetness goes away. I served with Keebler's Tusan Garlic Flatbread crackers....

I can't believe how good this recipe taste. I've made Mockamole before, but the recipe called for canned Asparagus instead of sweat peas, it was awful. This recipe is truly amazing.

I'm giving a 4 cuz it's good but not as good as with avocados. But I loved how the texture and color could fool most people into thinking it's the real thing. Great idea! Next time I need to stretch my avocados for a party I will just add avocado to this recipe.

I had this at my sister-in-laws house last fall and thought it was pretty good, considering it had no avocados in it.  After reading many of the other reviews of this recipe, I decided to make a batch today.  I doubled most of the quantities, used lime juice instead of lemon and processed much longer than the directions say.  I tasted it a couple times and adjusted the salt and chili flakes. I processed it some more until it was very smooth.  I LIKE IT!  No, it's not guacamole and no it doesn't have the calories of guacamole, but it's pretty darned good!

I loved it BECAUSE I left out the cumin and red flakes, and added the following: 2 small tomatoes, extra garlic, 2 tbsp cilantro, and a whole onion instead of the 3 Tbsp.. Adjust these ingredients to your taste. With these adjustments it's really hard to tell that there is no avocado.  It's a new favorite!

instead of chopped onion I added good quality salsa. My family loves this! It's got a nice sweet flavor. I think when you eat it you have to know what it is and be pleasantly surprised. I wouldn't try to pass it off as true guac, it isn't. It is a very nice guilt free dip

Excellent!!!  It doesn't taste completely like avocado but it's very close with the other ingredients added.  I LOVED IT!  I will be making this often as the taste is great!  Those who said it tasted like mashed peas did not process it long enough nor add the other ingredients!  I used a food processor (large one) and it didn't process very well until the lemon juice and olive oil was added but then I processed till good consistency.  I started tasting it and had a hard time stopping!  Thanks for the recipe, CACTUSUE!!!

decent, I made as a substitute for my mom who is allergic to avocado (she was very happy to have a "safe" version for her).  I left out the garlic since she doesn't like it and reduced the amount of onion.  I also added a dash of paprika and 2 chopped roma tomatoes for some texture.  Overall--extremely easy and a great sub for my mom!

I honestly don't know how anyone could confuse this with real guacamole.  Not only did it NOT taste like guac, it didn't taste good period.  The peas were just way too sweet and watery.

My buddy Tan from our QualityCook forum just told us about this recipe today and I happened to have had some leftover baby peas from the can sitting in the fridge, so I thought, why not give it a try? I really, really liked it. For those who say it doesn't taste like guacamole, well it's not supposed to; that's why it's called "mock"! I did feel it needed onion and garlic powders and the thought of putting one whole tsp. of cumin in the mix seemed a bit over the top. A little cumin goes a long way. Anyway, I loved it with those minor adjustments and plan on doing this again. Thanks so much for a very unique submission Cactusue and to you too Dana!

This does not taste like guacamole, but it isn't bad.  I guess there is just no substitute for real avocados!  And I had high hopes that my husband (who hates peas) would like this, but he tasted the pea flavor right away.  So I won't make it again, although it really is a flavorful, nice dip -- just not a substitute for guacamole.

This is a really good dip, even if you aren't "fooled" by it. I'm not, but love peas, so tried it. It's now my "go to" dip - and I have friends that actually think it's guacamole! Really glad I've got this recipe, especially if I don't have avocados on Mexican food night.

I like all the ingredients individually, but I did not care for this recipe.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe as written.  I was hoping it may improve as a leftover, but it did not.

I had high hopes for this and the flavor is alright. My problems are with the sweetness and the texture. The sweetness may just be that I haven't added enough salt and I'm hoping as it sits overnight in the fridge it will become tastier. But the texture is very disappointing. It doesn't seem to matter how long I process it, the skins from the frozen peas are not going to become smooth. It hasn't got a creamy mouth feel, it's full of chewy, stringy fibers. Perhaps made with soaked split peas this might come out both savory and smooth.

Those at the party who don't like guacamole would not try it, those who do were very impressed with the flavor! they all said it tasted a little different, sweeter, and the texture was different in the mouth, but all agreed it was a great low fat alternative! Several asked for the recipe!

I like peas. I never have been that crazy about avocados or "gwack", it's okay but if you are close to that profile--this is WAY BETTER.  Just a matter of preferences. Also you can really "mess" with this a lot using the peas as the base. Thanks for this, I would have never thunk about using peas...[a nutribullet makes just about anything smoooth]

I made this for a party of people, all of whom are trying to be health conscious.  While I do not think the dip really tasted like guacamole, it did look like guacamole and it ended up being quite tasty.  I felt the cumin was a little strong so I added more peas to dilute the taste.  I also added extra garlic and some salsa to make it a little more authentic.  Several people asked me for the recipe so I count that as a success.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe is fantastic! This is really, really close to the real deal. 
I do think lime juice is a great addition, and brought it closer to the flavor of guacamole (for me).
I do wish I had blended it instead of using the food processor though. just because the skins of the peas didn't get broken down enough for my taste.

This is a delicious and healthy snack or appetizer that goes great with tortilla chips. You will be disappointed if you expect it to taste like regular guacamole (partly because you know what you put in it). If that's what you want, then make guacamole with avocados! In it's own right, this is something very good and different. Nice recipe!

It wasn't great...but it wasn't bad either. Tastes nothing like guacamole, but I didn't go into it expecting it to. Too much onion or garlic, not sure which...all I know is that I can't kiss anyone for the next 2 weeks. It was just ok.
