Wow, this was amazing! I have never made bread pudding before, so I really wasn't sure what to expect, but it turned out awesome! Everyone loved it and even took leftovers home (I made a double batch in a 9x13 pan). The only thing was that it took about an hour and a half on 325 in my oven! I don't know why - maybe because I doubled the recipe. But it was so moist, delicious, and chocolatey that it was worth it!

I doubled the recipe and skipped the almonds. This was incredibly delicious and easy to make. I only baked for about 40 minutes and it seemed cooked though but not dry enough for a knife to come out clean (personal bread pudding preference). The only thing I might change would be to use warm milk since the chocolate got clumpy and stuck to the whisk when the cold milk was added.

I accidentaly cooked my brownies in a larger pan than the recipe called for and they were slightly overcooked and a bit hard.  I found this recipe and did not have to throw my brownies out.  This revived them into a different dessert.  Since my brownies had pecans in them already I did not use the almonds.  Since the brownies were a bit overcooked, I let them soak in the liquid mixture for about thirty minutes before cooking them to moisten them up some.  This turned out to be VERY rich and yummy.

I made this recipe last Sunday and served with ice cream. I didn't think it was as special as other people did I guess. Looked and tasted like mushy undercooked brownies. Not something I would serve to company. It was sweet and good, though. Just not 5-star-worthy.

I had to nix the almonds at the last minute.  My daughter decided that she didn't like almonds and my husband threatened to pick them out.  I sprinkled them over the top of mine.  Delish!  Great warm out of the oven or cold from the fridge.
