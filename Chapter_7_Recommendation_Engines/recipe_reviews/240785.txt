This is now a go-to recipe for entertaining. Tip: if you don't want them to be too hot, make sure the jalapeños you use are smooth. If the skin is wrinkly, they're much hotter (I accidentally learned this the hard way!).

I have made this about three times total. only real changes I have made, are that I boil the jalapenos for at most 10min after slicing them in half, I cut the stems off of them, and I mix two tablespoons of sriracha with 8 ounces of cream cheese.

My family loves these.

Even though I removed all the seeds he peppers were a little too hot for our liking....next time I will par boil for a couple of minutes before proceeding with the rest of the recipe....other than that, very good.

Love, love, love these! Sonic's cheddar peppers are just about my favorite snack, but I know all the fat and calories aren't good for me. These baked ones are just as good and a lot healthier. And I don't have to drive to Sonic to get them! I use reduced fat cream cheese and fill up the pepper halves with the mixture, about a tablespoon in each pepper half. Then I spray the bread crumbs on top with olive oil to make sure they brown and crunch up. Bake these in my toaster oven about 350 degrees for about 15 minutes. Yay, I can have cheddar peppers again!

Made these with my over abundance of jalapeño peppers from my garden. I combined the two cheeses and used Mexican Four Cheese blend then sprinkled Panko crumbs on top. I ran out of time, but next time I'm frying bacon and putting bacon crumbles on top. These were very good.

I made this simple and tasty recipe to use up some leftover jalapenos and Monterey Jack cheese I had on hand.  I would have preferred it made with the cheddar cheese, but it was still very good.

Quite easy to make and very tasty! I have made these several times and they are always a hit. I do par boil the halved and seeded peppers for 2 minutes to remove some of the heat prior to stuffing them. Thank you for this simple and simply good recipe.

I made this with both sweet and jalapeño peppers. I put bacon bits in the fat-free cream cheese, and grated Parmesan Romano cheese in the bread crumbs. For the sweet peppers I added a dash of red pepper before the cheddar. I actually didn’t find the jalapeños hot so next time will leave seeds in. All in all though, scrumptious and easy.

I am a true lover of peppers and this was a way to experiment. The main ingredient (peppers) was substituted with Alameda peppers instead of  Jalapenos. Reason: bigger pepper, milder flavor, and you get more stuffing for the serving. :D

I was exhausted and did not want the jalapenos to spoil. I did nothing different from what the recipe said, except I had no panko.... so I used plain bread crumbs which were pretty fine. Panko might have given them a little more crispness, but these were pretty good and really easy. I like that they were baked not fried, but i think a sprinkle of garlic powder or paprika might have been a good addition.

I made for the first time. Cut recipe in Half for 2 people. I did as another reviewer said. I cleaned out seeds and boiled for 8 minutes. Then mixed  1 oz. cream cheese and 1 oz. chedder/monterey jack grated cheese. Added 1 tsp. Trappey's hot sauce. Mixed well in bowl. putt some Panko in bottom of peppers first, then filled each. Topped with layer of Panko. 22 minutes later perfect golden brown. Taste excellent during Super Bowl. Will make several times in the future! AAA+++.

I had a football party where I made the Velveta and Rotel dip w/hamburger. I made too much and needed to finish the dip off. I bought some jalapeños, cut and seeded them, then used cold from the fridge Rotel dip for the filling. By the time the peppers were cooked through, the dip was bubbly hot. This recipe is for people who like hot, they were all gone in short order. I'll use the panko next time for more crunch. Skip these if you don't like the heat, give them a try if you want a new taste treat.

These are great! I make a batch just like this,  then another in which I don't use panko, but instead wrap with a half slice of bacon (not thick cut) so those on a keto diet can enjoy too!!

I didn't have breadcrumbs so I crushed some crackers and had good results. I sprinkled taco seasoning on top after it baked. I tried two types of pans. An aluminum non stick and a pyrex glass pan. I had better results with the aluminum non stick.

I grew jalapeños this year and had quite an abundance so decided to try this recipe. After reading the comments I decided to blanch my jalapeños for 3 minutes (boil then ice water bath). The jalapeños, now that the recipe is done, are quite soft.  They are incredibly spicy. My eyes are watering and I can’t see my phone. I’m not sure I could serve these for game day. There would be a bunch of crying men clustered close to the TV.  The taste is great though!

I stuffed the peppers a little more than the recipe called for. Probably made them have more calories, but they were delicious!

This was my first attempt at making jalapeno poppers, and they turned out wonderfully.
To save calories, I used Philadelphia whipped cream cheese instead of regular. It also saves time since it doesn't need to be softened. 
 Also made my own breadcrumbs, they gave the peppers a nice crunch. 
Will definitely make these again

I rate this 5 stars because I love them and I don't know what to do to make them better.

I fried my last batch according to another recipe. They were delicious, but a tremendous amount of work, and frankly, the bread crumbs in the recipe on this page really do their job. I will make them again.

Love these. Your eyes will burn while you boil the jalapeños. I did boil them after taking out the seeds, but better if you can boil them on the grill outside. I also made some lower calorie since I’m doing WW. The message tells me that my picture isn’t enough pixels. Okay? I tried.

I made these as an appetizer for a cookout we had. The grill was being used for the chicken, so cooking these in the oven was perfect! I chose to mix the cream cheese and cheddar cheese and then stuff the peppers.

I made theses and they were fantastic!  So much better than fried restaurant ones!  I used the greek yogurt cream cheese and added garlic powder and a pinch of salt as recommended by some other reviewers.  I also blanched some and cooked others raw.  I preferred the raw cooked ones because there was a little more spice without being overly spicy.  I LOVE this recipe and look forward to making them again!
