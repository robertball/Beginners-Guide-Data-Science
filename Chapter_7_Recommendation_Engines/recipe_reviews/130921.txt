I've been making my scrambled eggs this way for years and YEARS!!!  I love then this way. And I put curry powder as my "secret ingredient" in egg salad sandwiches as well.

These were a little rich for my taste, I think because of the cheese. Dh liked them as is, though. Next time, I'll wait to sprinkle less cheese on the finished eggs.

Very nice, keeps it simple, too. A good idea!

Just gotta love it described as  "An American classic with a nifty twist!"  Aren't scrambled eggs a classic from just about any country with eggs and frying pans?  Worth a go for a simple meal with a 'punch'.

I used 2 egg whites and one egg yolk, 2% sharp cheddar and I also used red curry powder. Very good. A year ago, you couldn't get me to try curry in eggs.....now I can't get enough!!!

Really quite nice.  Very simple and tasty.  Like any recipe that uses curry powder, the end product will vary with the character/quality of the curry.  I suppose the same could be said of cheese -- cheddar or otherwise.

Very good variation from plain ol' scrambled eggs.  I have a whisk attachment on my hand-held mixer that I used to emulsify the spices into the eggs.  Works great.

I loved the flavor of these eggs! I used red curry powder and sharp cheddar. You have to like the taste of curry powder though to like these. My husband wouldn't even try them. Thanks, I thought these were great!

I made this recipe exactly as stated and was rather disappointed.  I love curry and indian food, but this just was nothing special.  I also don't think the curry should be mixed in prior (same with the eggs).  It clumped up for me and turned into have sections with and some without.  I'd recommend scrambling eggs, sprinkling on some curry and cheese afterwards.

Hmmm... curry and eggs, very interesting. It's probably just me, but I really was reminded of french toast when I was eating this. lol. I used 1 whole egg and 2 egg whites. Pretty tasty.

Sorry, didn't like this very well.  Except I don't know why.  Curry I like in small doses, so anything with curry is always a gamble with me -- just have to try it and see.  But I didn't think the curry flavor was that strong, so that's not it.  And I love cheddar cheese.  So can't explain it -- maybe I don't like cheddar and curry together?

I have never had curry before so I figured this was a good cheap way to find out if I like it. I am glad I tried it . It gave the eggs a good flavor. This won't be added in my eggs all the time but when I want something differnt I will make again.

If you like curry, I'm sure you'll love this recipe.  For us, it was okay, but not better than what we whip up with other ingredients.

My daughter loves scrambled eggs for breakfast, and I end up eating them with her almost every day.  I was browsing the website trying to find some ways to change up my daily eggs.

The first time I tried this recipe, I thought it was pretty good.  I made it again the next day and liked it even more.  It really grows on you. Yum!

I just add ¼ cup of 3% milk to beaten eggs and 1tsp of cream of wheat.
Excellent.  Love it. It is a keeper.

Curry & cheddar  flavored eggs .... Mmm Mmm good. I also like to flavor scrambled eggs with other flavors like: Italian herb mix, Cajun or Creole seasoning, BBQ Spice rub, Greek Seasoning ... the options in your spice cupboard are many and varied!  Experiment! Enjoy!!!

Nicely flavored scrambled eggs--just the right amount of curry. My 4 year-old tried them too, and she liked them.The only thing I did differently was to add the cheese just before the eggs were completely done. I don't like how the cheese all melts away when you cook it with the eggs.  I will try this again!

Really good!  The curry powder made the eggs taste eggier, if that's possible, without tasting like curry.  I just used McCormick regular curry powder, nothing exotic.  I added the cheese when the eggs were in the pan rather than mix it in beforehand, just like it that way better.  Thanks for a good recipe!

An interesting idea and a good, different taste at breakfast. Quick to prepare too, which is great. They don't look too pretty because of the colour change wrought by the curry powder, and I think a sprinkle of fresh herbs, flat leaf parsley or basil, would add freshness and pretty it up a bit. Would be great to serve naan as an accompaniment. Thanks!

Ok, I was a little skeptical when eyeballing this recipe, because we all know how a little curry powder goes a long way.....but wow!  I really liked it a lot.  The key is the proportion of the ingredients (duh!).

I basically doubled the recipe but was pretty careful about using less curry powder and less cheese.  The cheese part was difficult, since I'm a cheese freak, but you don't want them to be too greasy, with both the butter and cheese.

The result was a really nice, subtle mix of flavors.  I made these for my ex, and although he did the huge eye  roll when I first told him about the recipe, his eyes got huge when he tasted them and was pleasantly shocked.

Keeper!

I just made curried scrambled eggs by accident: I didn't want to waste the egg dip I made for some panko-breaded codfish fillets (with curried egg dip).  Anyway, I threw the egg dip in the pan after the fish was done, and it was delicious! (actually, better than the fish; ) Anyway, no need for cheese; I liked it as is, with Jamaican curry, black pepper grind, some light adobo seasoning, and a little garlic powder.
