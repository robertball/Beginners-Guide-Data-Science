kinda scared to make this without any reviews, but the ingredients sounded good. I baked this dish in the oven instead of frying to cut out the fat. It was good, but seemed to be missing something, not sure what. Did not bake it very long, for the frying time only required 3-4 mins on each side.  I will try and fry what I have left over and see if that improves the flavor.

We thought these were very good! I did make one major substitution though...I used regular potatoes instead of sweet potatoes b/c that's what I had on hand, and they worked great in this! Also, I did not use 1/4 cup of lemon zest, just the zest from 1 lemon. I served these w/ sour cream, and we thought they were tasty. I think some onion in the mix would also be a great addition, but not necessary. I fried mine. I would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I love crab meat and sweet potatoes, so this recipe caught my attention. I substituted kefir (smooth Turkish yogurt) for mayonnaise to cut down on fat content, and as a result I got hash/stuffing instead of proper cakes...but it was DELICIOUS. I could only eat maybe 1/4 of the recipe because of how filling it is, so I'm saving the rest back as a side with turkey or some other gamy meat.

I used approx. 2 tsp Dijon mustard instead,  only 2 tsp of Old Bay instead of 2 Tbsp, and just the zest of 1 lemon. Fried in coconut oil, with a dallop of plain Greek yogurt and cilantro. Delicious and savoury!
