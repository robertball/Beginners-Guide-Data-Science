I substituted a very small amount of stevia since a little is all you need to sweeten and it made for a delicious snow cone syrup.

This is an excellent recipe. MUCH less expensive than purchasing ready-made (sugar-free) syrup. I make this all the time for my husband, who's diabetic.

Very good and easy. Grandsons like it as much as the store bought and it is better for them. Thanks.
