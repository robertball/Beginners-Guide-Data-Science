I changed quite a bit in this recipe as I did not have any cornstarch or sour cream. I did the Tb butter, a little less than 1/2 cup ranch dressing, 1/2 cup milk, and  1 1/2 Tbs of flour as a substitute suggestion for the cornstarch I got from a book. I mixed this and cooked it on low/med-low until hot and bubbly. Added 1 1/2 cups cheese and 1/4 cup hot salsa. It was DELICIOUS!!!!!! Great with my chips and beans! YUM YUM!!

Thank you for a delicious recipe.  I have searched forever for a good queso dip... and this is it.  I did not have cornstarch, so I melted the butter then added sour cream, at this point I also added about 3 oz of cream cheese, when adding cheddar I also added some pepper jack cheese.  I used a twice the salsa called for and also some bottled hot sauce (louisiana type).  This was VERY GOOD!  Thank you again poster.

It is a very good dip with modifications.  To make it a smoother consistancy I used Velveeta.  This allowed me to cut out the butter and corn starch.

This is SOOOO good! I made it for a Superbowl party and couldn't stop eating it! I wanted something without processed cheese and this was so easy to make! I will definitely make this again and again.

Excellent and simple.  Once you've figured out how easy cheese sauce is with real cheese, you'll never use velveeta again.  Excellent recipe!

Not a huge fan of this recipe - it came out very "fluffy" and didn't taste very cheesy at all.

This was very delicious. For smooth results, I added a few tablespoons of cheese at a time and whisked constantly. I didn't have salsa so I improvised with an equal amount of chopped red onion and sriracha.

Very good...I did use 1/2 sharp cheddar and the other 1/2 was velvetta to get a smoother consistency.  Thanks for the post.

Mine came out sort of lumpy.  It wasn't smooth like I expected of a queso.  I used sharp cheese and homemade salsa (added 2 extra tablespoons).  I also added some hot sauce to give it a bit more zip.  I might try it again but I would need to play with it to make it a bit smoother in texture.

This is a fabulous and easy recipe to make. I had never even tried making queso dip before and now I will be making it all the time. A great dip to serve at a party with corn chips. Thanks a lot.

Made this recipe as written and gave it a taste test, which it passed very well. If I had been served this in an upscale restaurant, I would have been glad to have it. It did lack a few things that I like in my salsa con queso. I added a few chopped black olives, a chopped Serrano pepper, a teaspoon of granulated garlic and a tsp of dried minced onion that I crushed before adding.

Just made it today for the Packer game! Really good recipe! I used what I had left of shredded cheese, which was a mixture of a mexican blend, pepperjack, and colby jack. I also threw in some hot sauce to add a bigger kick! Awesome and easy! Love it!

absolutely delicious recipe!!! I made some tweaks like adding italian sausage, put more salsa in, and added hot sauce and crushed red peppers to make it spicier. But the basics of this recipe is amazing! I never liked the idea of eating velveeta cheese and now I don't have to :) ... I love the texture - it's super smooth and delicious.

Has potential with alteration. I used some extra sour cream, extra cheese, double salsa and added some sausage. The flavor was very bland and not cheesy.

I didn't have much luck with this recipe.  I find it difficult to get the creamy & cheesy flavor at my favorite Mexican place at home.  I did find something at the grocery store though called Queso Melt.  10 times better than what I have tried to do from scratch & you just microwave in the container so minimal clean up!

Since I have found it difficult to come up with a decent queso recipe, this one is pretty darn good.  I made it with reduced fat sour cream and I do NOT recommend that!  It made it taste a little powdery.  The recipe fills up a regular sized salsa bowl so its perfect, doesn't make too much.

Love the fact that there's no processed cheese in it! The cheese flavor is weak so I would use a sharper cheese next time.

It was pretty good but i did think that the sourcream kinda over powered it a little. Not the worst and really not the best I have had but it did require very little ingredients all of which I had on hand without having to go to the store. Good for a quick after thought to our Mexican food night.

Easy and good. I used a whisk.  If you whisk constantly until fully melted, and it will be smooth.

I've been looking for a good queso dip and this was perfect.  I put a bit of my own spin on it and added more sourcream, cheese, and salsa to taste.  It turned out great.  My boyfriend said this was the best nacho dip he has ever had.

This cheese dip is very good. My only complaint is that with just the cheddar alone the texture is not as smooth as I like it. I think next time I will try and split it with some velveeta. The flavor more than makes up for it though. Everyone in my family loved it! I will make this again soon.

It tasted of hot sour cream... not at all like the queso I am used to at Tex-Mex restaurants.  The search continues...  However, if you are really a fan of sour cream you will probably like this.

Thank you for a cheese dip that doesn't use Velveeta!!! This was great! The consistency was perfect. Next time I will add lots more salsa, just because I like a cheese AND salsa dip better, but that's just personal preference.

Awesome recipe and I appreciate the fact that it doesn't ask for processed cheese.  I used flour instead of cornstarch as well.

Pretty good - after I made a few changes.  I used flour in place of the cornstarch (didn't have any on hand), added a bit of garlic when I added the sour cream, and also added about a half cup of Montery Jack cheese and a dash of paprika.  Yummy!!

We usually use Velveta but we were out. We had all the ingredients for your dip and were presently surprised with the taste! We did add more salsa than the recipe called for. I would like to think it is healthier than Velveeta too. THANKS!

It was too sour cream tasting for us. We added more salsa too and it was good. Just needs to be a little less sour cream!

Good basic recipe! I made the following changes: I added a little milk to the butter and cornstarch roux; then some sour cream, and refried black beans and salsa. I added some canned green chiles to that and only maybe 1/2 cup cheese or even less than that. And finally I garnished with a little green onion.

It just wasn't what I would call, "queso".  This was thick and tasted much like the cheese dip that you. An make with Velveta cheese. It tasted fine. I am going to try a different recipe next time.

It's great to find recipes that don't use processed foods and do use simple ingredients that are usually on hand  - I made this following the recipe directions except I added lots more salsa and some leftover seasoned taco meat at the end.  I used it to make a good taco salad with iceberg lettuce, more salsa, corn chips, and cilantro.

This blended very well, but lacked on flavor.  If I were to do it again, I'd use twice as much cheese and a sharp one at that.  Someone else said it made a fluffy dip.  I agree.  I would have preferred that sort of consistency on bread or crackers, but not for tortilla chips.

I wanted a Queso that wasn’t Velveeta based. As several reviewers noted, this one turned out grainy and tasted too much like sour cream. Will not make again.

This is not queso. This is a cheese dip. I hail from Texas (home of Tex-Mex) and can affirm this is NOT queso. I reduced the amount of sour cream and added another cup of cheese but it was still a weird fluffy texture. It tasted alright (not cheesy enough like others have said). But again, not queso like I was hoping. I don’t recommend this recipe, and I don’t think there’s a substitute for milk in queso.

This was ok. It was very cheesy but didn’t really taste like queso, just melted cheese. Better for fondue maybe. You need a lot more salsa than the recipe says to get it to taste somewhat like queso.

This was really good. I’ve made it a few times now. Sometimes I thicken it with cream cheese or heavy cream if I don’t have sour cream. The texture is better if you stir continuously as other reviewers have mentioned. Thanks!

I shredded cheese from a block to avoid the coating on pre-grated cheese and keep my queso smooth.   The results were great -- thick and creamy!  We used it with shredded beef to make Super Nachos for a decadent dinner.  YUM!

It was okay for my husband and I, although I would not serve it to guests. Never reaches the consistency of a true queso. My gut instinct was to use Velveeta and I was right, because my final result was moderately tasty but not creamy. I added in some fresh spinach and artichokes which saved the day but would not use this particular recipe again.

Super fast and easy.  I added extra salsa and shredded cheese.  I like my quest spicy so I added some diced jalapenos.   Very good option to kill a queso craving.

When I followed the recipe exactly as it is written, the dip was underwhelming - too much sour cream flavor, not enough cheese. I added about twice the amount of cheese the recipe called for and two additional tablespoons of salsa. With these modifications, I would give it 5 stars. I used fresh grated extra sharp cheddar and added it a handful at a time right after removing the sauce from heat, and it blended in nicely with no lumps.

I used a can of hot Ro-tel instead of the hot sauce called for.  It is better than the Velveta recipe and cheaper!

I used Greek Yogurt in place of sour cream, tripled the recipe, added season ground beef (pre-cooked it), and 505 Southwestern Green Chile.
 Served it with Labriola Pretzel Slider Buns from Costco.  It seriously rivaled Culinary Dropouts Pretzel bites and dip!

four stars only because I tweaked the recipie, which was only due to the fact I didn't have enough cheddar in my fridge. 

I has several slices of American cheese that had just expired, but not quite a cup, and then I had some pepper jack cheese, less than 1/4, I think? it was in a solid state and I didnt want to shred it. 
I added some milk, until I was a little to runny, then took some of the cheese mixture out and added cornstarch, and then a can of diced green chili peppers.
then the I added some sour cream (didn't notice a big taste difference. I don't usually have it in my fridge) the pepper jack added jusy enough heat, so I didn't add salsa.

I added fresh cilantro (a tbs.) and 1/2 tsp of chili powder. Instead of using 8 oz of cheddar I went with 4 oz of ched. and 4 oz of monterey jack cheese BUT NOT the preshredded bags! Big score with my family!

Pretty easy and good.  Kids helped me with it and we enjoying doing it together. Didnt have any cornstarch. Wasn't as smooth as store bought but not a problem.  Preferred using cheddar cheese over processed cheese, so I liked that. Also added some mozzarella cheese.

I liked this recipe... I would most likely use it again. I followed some of the other reviews on how to tweak it. Still came out pretty good though.

Needed a queso that was quick, easy and all ingredients I had on hand... so I gave this one a try.  I made two changes:  ended up adding a little garden vegetable cream cheese because I did not have enough sour cream and added about 1/2 cup of salsa.  The consistency was a little strange, sort like one big blob and that is why I added more salsa (Tying to thin it out a little)  The consistency stayed the same however.  To my surprise the flavor was actually really good.  So easy and was a perfect compliment to my homemade southwest pretzels.  Will be making this again!

This is a delicious queso dip!  Very good and love that it uses all natural ingredients!  Its very easy to make.  I would also recommend adding the cheese just a bit at a time, to make a smoother consistency, and for the best (and smoothest) results, serve immediately.  The longer it sits, the thicker and lumpier it gets.  My husband loved it!  I will be making this again!

I didn't have any sour cream, so I added some pepper jack cheese, and I just fudged the whole thing (no measuring), but I am SO glad I finally found a recipe that tastes like the queso dip I love from a restaurant we visited growing up.  Thanks!

I did not care for this. I don't know why I trusted the use of sour cream for a cheese dip. I tried salvaging it with some milk & extra cheese, but it was too late.

I followed the recipe but added an extra tablespoon of salsa. It's not as creamy as I'd hoped but almost a more gritty texture. The flavor is wonderful. I'll make it again. I will certainly try to create a more creamy version though.

This was pretty great! I'll definitely make it again instead of buying it from the store in the future. I added  4 tbsp of salsa 1 tbsp whipping cream to make it less thick. I definitely recommend this queso if you're looking for non-processed cheese.

It's good if you want a cheese dip, not queso. It tastes too much like the canned cheese whiz to me.

Good guideline recipe, but I used less butter, less sour cream, and used creamcheese. I did without the salsa, and used mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Turned out really good!

I found this recipe to be a good jumping point for the queso I wanted to make. I used a tex-mex cheese blend (and about twice the amount prescribed by the recipe)instead of cheddar, for a spicier flavor. As well, I used flour in substitution for cornstarch and twice the salsa. All in all, not quite as spicy as I would have liked, but  I will definitely use this as a base and experiment with it in the future.

This was just ok.  I added about 5 times the salsa called for and it was still pretty bland, so added hot sauce, this still didn't do much, so it's good if you don't like a lot of heat, but didn't satisfy me or my family.  Also, I took it to a New Year's Eve party, by the time I got it to the party it had a hard layer on top and when I reheated it, it just got glumpy, maybe Velveeta is the way to go or maybe no cornstarch, I'm not really sure why that was needed.  I may use this as a starting point again, but I'll definitely change it.  It ended up getting thrown out at the end of the night after hardly being touched.
