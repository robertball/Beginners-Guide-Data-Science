I love one pan dinners, and this one is no exception! The flavors of the squash, apple, and onion really complement each other well. I was worried about the sage, but it was delicious on the vegetables as well as the pork. This is a company worthy dinner that is so easy to make.

This recipe is so simple to make - and it's flawless! I didn't change a thing, and don't think I'll change anything when I make it next time, either. Wait - I may make my apple slices a bit wider so they're not completely mushy. :) The pork stayed moist and tender, though, and that was key to a "keeper" of a recipe!

Very good pork tenderloin.  Only changes I made, make the marinade for pork (as well as added 6 cloves garlic minced) and allowed it to sit in resealable bag for 8 - 10 hours, also did the same for veggies with 2 large carrots joining them.  This is going to be an addition to the menu schedule.

This is surprisingly yummy! Lots of flavor.  I used a pork roast and it works great.
