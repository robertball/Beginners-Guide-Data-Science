This is absolutely delicious!  I actually had this on Thanksgiving for the first time and couldn't quit eating it.  It takes about five minutes to whip up and your house smells fabulous while doing so.  It's just the right amount of cinnamon.  In reading the previous reviews, a few people have commented on the texture...ironically enough, the texture is one of the things I enjoyed most about this recipe.  It actually feels as though it has some body, unlike plain Jello dishes. Five stars for me without a doubt!

So when I made this I used two boxes of pineapple gelatin mix. I used 1 cup of red hots which I melted into 2 cups of boiling water that I then mixed into the gelatin, and added 1 1/2 cups of unsweetened applesauce mixing it throughly.
Then I added 2 cups of cold water and put it into the fridge to set which made it taste more like a jello than a dessert, and it wasnâ€™t as overly sweet but it just turned out perfect.

Thanks for the comments. This is not a Jell-O to be eaten on it's own. This is definitely a great complement to a ham, which is the only time I make this. My husband is not a big fan either, but I can't seem to eat ham without it anymore!

I've made this before, however this time I decided to follow the recipe and only use one cup of water. I would have to call that a mistake, make the jello according to package directions with your water. (Two cups of water) it dilutes the flavor just the tiniest it and makes the final product actually edible. I personally think it sets up better too!

This is been a tradition in our family for years but we use sugar free jello and like a bit more bite so I use a cup of red hots. I hate sugar free jello but in this recipe it is awesome.

Loved it last year but some comments about it being too sweet.  Used unsweetened apple sauce and it was perfect.  Repeat requests for this treat.

Takes me back to childhood memories.   Very easy & tasty.  Hardest part was trying to find the red hot candies.

Want to have some fun with this recipe? Make it in a blender, toss in some ice cubes & turn it into a Red Hot Ice Cold Smoothie. YUM!

I thought this was ok. Others said they liked it and said it was delicious, but most of it was still left at the end of the dinner.

I will, but the recipe should use more gelatin if you only are chilling it for 2 hours.

I had to look for this recipe because our Grandmother passed away and she made this for every holiday. We love it, and it is a nice tradition. We call it "Red Stuff". If there isn't any, someone will always ask for it.

Kids loved this, hubby said it was ok, and I thought it was way too sweet. The candy and cherry jello together was just too much sugar. I would definitely consider this, as written, a dessert. 
Next time I'm going to try it using tart cherry juice instead of water, and then unflavored gelatin. The red-hots will be plenty of sugar, and will still give it that lovely red color too. 
Might also try it with lemon jello like bevist says here.

I loved it. My husband didn't. Can we ever have a majority vote at my house? I'll make it again but probably when I have company so I don't have to eat it all myself.
