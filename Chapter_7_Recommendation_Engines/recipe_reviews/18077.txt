Have made this time and again. We all love it.  I add more garlic as we are garlic lovers. Was always using fresh beets. For the heck of it I used drained canned sliced beets and it was excellent. Never would have believed it.

These even go over well with non-beet people. Savory and sweet at the same time. Makes good use of a somewhat neglected veggie.

I made this for a summer family picnic. It was a hit even with the kids! It was nice to have a new idea! We used canned beets, it kept the prep time down.

Let me first say that I am not a big fan of beets.  BUT...this actually made them o.k., and my husband really loved them.  I took your advice to add more garlic {selfishly I thought it would overpower the beet flavor}, and it created a nice taste combination.  Thanks for a beet recipe that I can live with and my husband just adores.

I love beets in salads, but had never used them as a side dish, as my husband hates them.  I tried this recipe, and it's pretty good.  Even my 4 year old (who is a veggie lover like her mom) ate it up, and she's not big on garlic.  Of course, hubby and other two kids wouldn't even try it.  Their loss.  Will be using again, but prefer the beets on my salad.

This recipe was delicious and although it took my beets about 40 minutes to cook (because they were large)it was still very quick and easy to prepare.

This has been a favorite side of mine for as long as I can remember.  We also add in some pepper, oregano and copped basil, and to save (LOTS of) time, we used canned beets.  I could eat beets like this every day and always be happy.
You can add some sliced onions in as well, and defintatley make sure it is served cold. It's best to let it sit a while in the fridge to soak up all the flavors.

This was fabulous!  I only used one clove of garlic, because I am not a huge garlic fan.  The vinaigrette had just the right amount of tang.

This was GREAT!  I roasted my beets for an hour in their skins first, coated in olive oil, for an hour (keeps ALL the good stuff in).  Then I sliced them and let them sit in the marinade for awhile.  Even the kids liked it.

I roasted the beets at 400 degrees for about 45 mins, then doubled the amount of garlic and added approx 1/2 c sliced red onion. It was delicious! Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so good, I can't remember the last time we had beets but now I can't wait to have them again, the flavour was great, it was easy to make and so healthy.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Rob and I decided to grow beets this year along with everything else and all I can say is, I'm SO glad we did! Rob went out to the garden Saturday to pull some up and we made this recipe. OMG, I couldn't get enough! What a huge difference between the store bought stuff and a fresh beet from either your own garden or from a farmers market. This was  such a simple yet really delicious recipe. I just went outside to pull several more to make again tonight. Thank you so much!!

Very nice, simple recipe for beets. I found that the flavor is so much better the next day, so I recommend preparing the day before if possible. I never thought I would like beets with a garlic & oil mixture, but it's very good. I will make this again, thank you :)

This was fantastic! I doubled the garlic as all of us are garlic lovers. Once prepared, I let the beets sit for a couple of hours in the fridge to allow the flavours to fully meld together. Not only is this a great side dish to the rest of your meal, but wonderful when added to salads as well. Sooo flavourful! Thanks for the recipe!

Good! I found it a little heavy on the vinegar at first, but it got better after I chilled it for a while. Definitely benefits from some fresh cracked black pepper. Thanks :)

I liked them ok (although not a beet lover) but my family didn't like them at all.  My husband found them too oily.  So I made them a second time with less oil and then they were too garlicky.

These are similiar to those that an Italian deli by our house serves. My hubby & I love them and when I found this recipe, decided to give it a try. I used fresh beets, 6 cloves of garlic and added fresh shredded  basil. Also doubled the dressing, since I used more beets then this recipe calls for. EXCELLENT! And just as good, if not better, then the Italian eatery!

Yum! Thanks for a fantastic recipe! My husband and I can't stop eating these beets when I make them. If your beets are fresh enough, you don't even need to add salt. I adjust the vinegar and oil to taste, add about a Tbsp. of honey and have substituted slivered onions for the garlic, for those who are not garlic fans. If you make the dressing before hand and pour it over the sliced beets and toss, you'll get less breakage.

I cheated also, used canned beets.  Looking for something extra to go with dinner, I made these exactly as per recipe, but could not resist adding fresh basil as another suggested and I have an abundance of fresh herbs, love to use them whenever possible.  No leftovers for tomorrow.  DH and I ate them all.

This is very similar to the beets my Mother makes. If you find fresh beets, don't discard the stalks! Add them to the boing water during the last 15 minutes of cooking time. Toss them together with the peeled and sliced beets. The dish tastes even better the next day! Just a footnote: I always use balsamic vinegar in the marinade and garlic powder instead of fresh

6-21-2019 ~For the most part, this is the “beet salad” I grew up with.  Loved it decades ago, still love it now.  Just like my mom always did, I added chopped fresh parsley and thinly sliced red onion.  I also used the oil/vinegar in the 3:1 ratio I prefer.  Also consistent with what I’m used to (and because it’s a whole lot easier) I used canned sliced beets. A new addition was the garlic, and I love that too.

Love it!  I was looking for a quick way to "pickle" beets.  Love it exactly as written & next time would like to try with thinly sliced onions.  This will only get better as it sits.

Assembled this a few days ago for our Sunday cookout. I didn't convert anyone over to liking beets. Those of us who liked beets thought these were great. I too used canned beets and added sliced onion.

This recipe was just great. My husband loves beets, but I'm not a big fan, so I am always looking for recipes I might like, too. Once in a while, try a sliced onion instead of the garlic. Quite tasty, if I do say so myself.

Fabulous!  I followed the recipe exactly.  My hubby loves beets and he ate everything.  My kids had never had beets before and really liked the result.  I will be making again and again.  Thank you for posting.

I made this recipe as I saw more than one comment that said that a non-beet-lover enjoyed it -- and that's me!  I am not generally a beet fan and this was TASTY!  What a great way to enjoy this food.  My husband would give it five stars...he LOVED it (even our toddler ate it, but next time I'll set aside some for her without the garlic as fresh garlic is a bit spicey)  YUM YUM YUM!!!

I can't get over the "dirty" flavor of beets, but this recipe is nice if you need to eat them. I used canned beets and a red cooking wine instead of vinegar - which is maybe why it didn't live up to my expectations. I'll give it another go...

I made this with yellow beets and found it a beautiful and delicious dish. My culinarily unadventurous family wouldn't touch it, however. If you like beets, this is really good.

This was great, I used canned diced beets but next time i'm going to cut back on the vinegarette by a teaspoon or so and see if I like it better. Made some pork chops that I dipped in an egg and butternut squash mixture (pureed butternut squash) and then coated in italian bread crumbs mixed with parmesean cheese. Good complement to each other.

We love beets and order beet salads whenever we find them on the menu at a Restaurant.  So we were already well positioned to love this.  And we did!  I only had three beets but stuck with the recipe and the dressing was not too much.  Also added pepper and I used yellow and pink beets.  Do boil with the skin on, they look so much prettier when peeled.

Great recipe,  i however roast my beets, and used balsamic vinegar which was an interesting twist.   Roasting is easy especially when you are prepairing something else with the oven on.  Simply wash, cut in half, pierce the beet, place flesh side down on a baking sheet lined w parchment and add some water.   Peeling is a breeze,  and all the goodness and vitamines arent cooked out .

My sustainable food cooking group made this for a fall event at our university. For those brave enough to try beets, they really enjoyed it! Make sure your beets are fresh--go to the farmer's market (ours came from our on campus farm).

I didn't expect much from such a simple recipe, but the beets were delicious prepared this way.  I used golden beets and served them over baby mixed salad greens.  They were not only yummy, but looked beautiful, too.  Definitely a keeper!

We "used to have" beets with onions all the time UNTIL this recipe.  It is so outrageously delicious with fresh beets warm or cold.

I boiled the beets about 30 minutes until they were tender enough to pierce with a fork. I cooled them in the fridge and added a little white wine vinegar, olive oil and crumbled blue cheese. It was a nice summer salad. I think next time I would definately let in chill in the fridge for a couple of hours.

My mother grows beets in her garden and I made this recipe with them.  It was wonderful!  The garlic is a great compliment to the beets even though you wouldn't think so.  My husband and mother both enjoyed this change from my usual braised beets.

Very good! You can use other kinds of vinegar too. I like rice wine and Balsamic. Thanks for a simple but good recipe.

This was cool and refreshing for a light dinner on a hot day that I had with spicy garlic chicken wings. I used canned beets, and also added some chopped red onion and fresh parsley and the 3:1 ratio of oil to vinegar. I used Naples' suggestions here. A good compliment to a meal or an anytime snack. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this with fresh garden beets for my dad.  He loves beets and has tried numerous jarred varieties.  My mom and him both liked this recipe, so I will make it again when I have fresh beets available.

i'm not sure what i was expecting but this tasted a little bland.. i love beets doused with vinegar so i was thinking the added garlic and flavored vinegar would do something more.. i used less olive oil and after trying a bit i added some garlic salt, onion powder, and a sprinkle of dill.. i'm thinking about using Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing (on this site) next time

We really enjoyed this and I will make it again. After reading the reviews I added 1/2 a small onion, finely chopped. I wanted the dish to be more like a salad so I chopped the beets into cubes. In the future I will omit the oil and add more red wine vinegar. Thanks for sharing.

My brother liked these and he isn't a big fan of beets. Easy and delicious, will definitely make it again. The beet greens were bitter, I loved them but everyone else thought that they were too bitter.

OMG!  I never  would eat a beet because my Mom used to make me eat them....they are good for your blood; now we would all be laughing because I LOVE this recipe.  My husband and I grew golden beets in our garden and I didn't know what to do with them...to the rescue came this recipe!  The only thing I did differently is I added a bit of balsamic vinegar.  They are outstanding and I make them all the time and keep them in the refrigerator.  I even add them to our salads!  Wonderful easy recipe!

I love, love, love this recipe!  It is my "go-to" beet salad recipe and I use it all the time.  I have made it for people who say they don't like beets and they've changed their minds after trying this!  It is perfect for summer - I buy already cooked, shrink wrapped beets from the veg section at the supermarket so no cooking involved!  Oh, also, I use cider vinegar as I like it better than red wine vinegar but I think that's just personal preference.

My roommate swore up and down that she wouldn't eat beets.  But, after they were cooked and I convinced her to try one, I couldn't get her to stop eating these before the guests arrived.  She loved them - and the guests loved what was left of them!

I love beets, but to me this tasted too much like what is usually called "Harvard Beets," which is the stlye of preparation that used to make me think I hated beets.  Just not what I was expecting, I guess.
