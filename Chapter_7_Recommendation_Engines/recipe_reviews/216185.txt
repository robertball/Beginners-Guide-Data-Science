Simply delicious! I LOVE scrambled eggs for breakfast! It's a great way to start the day. I usually just use milk or a bit of half and half to achieve fluffy scrambled eggs, but this was a great way to use up some leftover evaporated milk. This is a great base for add-in's like your favorite meats, veggies, or cheese. I like to add just pinch of onion and garlic powders get the eggs nice and fluffy then place them inside a warm tortilla - just add cheese and whatever breakfast meat I have on hand then wrap it up for a really great breakfast on the go!

These were so good and it was a great way to use up a partial can of evaporated milk I had leftover from soup making! I did use butter and I sauteed onion, garlic, chopped peppers and mushrooms before adding the eggs just for added vegetables and I used fat free evaporated milk. The evaporated milk made the eggs so fluffy!

This such a simple recipe, but it results in a very satifying version of scrambled eggs.  I used butter also and I had the heat low.  Will make again and again.

I've never been able to make scrambled eggs, but had to come up with breakfast on the fly yesterday (for my father in law, who is the king of scrambled eggs, no less).  Followed this recipe to a T (except I melted some butter in the pan before adding the eggs), and they turned out perfect.  My F-I-L says I will be making the eggs from now on.

Excellent moist eggs. I never knew scrambled eggs could really be this good, I mean c'mon they're just eggs. But wow, these were good and not dry or rubbery at all. I used unsalted butter instead of spray.

Regular milk works just as good and is cheaper.
