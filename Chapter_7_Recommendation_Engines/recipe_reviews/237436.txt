I replaced 1/2 the ketchup with barbecue sauce. It came out great. My family love it and it ll now be a regular for us.

I made it just as written. It was quite tangy and too moist. It fell apart when I tried to slice it. It had a good flavor otherwise. Next time I might use less catsup in the meat mixture and less vinegar in the sauce.

Awesome recipe! Instead of the bread crumbs I crumble oyster or saltine crackers and sprinkle them with Italian seasoning.  I also add bellpepper. Easy recipe. I refuse to make meatloaf unless it's this recipe. Thanks Aunt Libby!!!
