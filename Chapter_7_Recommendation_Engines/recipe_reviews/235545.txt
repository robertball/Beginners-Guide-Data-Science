This was delicious! I prepared it a bit differently, however, based on my research of some other recipe websites. I used one head of organic cauliflower, cut into ping-pong sized pieces. Then, in a large bowl, I whisked together: olive oil (probably about 5 tbs), with a touch of garlic infused olive oil, and chile pepper infused olive oil; roughly a tsp of salt, some black pepper, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper (you could use whatever spices/herbs you prefer). Then, I tossed the cut and washed cauliflower(pat dry so oil/spice mix adheres properly) in the oil mixture (try to toss by moving the bowl in a circular motion, instead of using fingers, as this tended to break apart the cauliflower pieces) until everything was coated nicely. I baked this on a baking sheet covered with parchment paper for approx. 45 minutes at 415 degrees, tossing the cauliflower every 15 minutes with a spatula until they became golden-brown, and somewhat blackened on the tippy-tops.(In my opinion, you don't need the sugar or cooking spray). So yummy!!

I followed the suggestions in the reviews; left out sugar and used olive oil (diet restrictions). I also added a little chili oil, so that was about 4 tsp. of oil. I whisked the oils with a smidgen of salt, garlicpowder, dried minced onion, and paprika, then added the cooked cauliflower an gently mixed. Baked it at 415Â°F for about 30 mins. Was hoping to have this as a snack, similar to popcorn. However, the texture is all wrong. I still like it, but hubby doesn't. That's okay; more for me. It's something quick and easy that I can fix when he's out of town.

I took the other reviewers suggestions and instead of using cooking spray, I mixed 4 Tbsp high heat cooking oil with the seasonings in a bowl, then put the cauliflower in the bowl to coat. I also subbed 1/4 tsp cumin for the garlic powder. I checked it after 30 minutes and it was already burnt. I ate them anyway, and they were delicious. Next time I'll cut back on salt and check it after 20 minutes.

I used one head of cauliflower. 2 tsps. sugar, 1 tsp. salt, curry instead of turmeric (the other ingredients were the same) and 2 tsps. olive oil.
I put cauliflower in a gallon zip lock bag, sprinkled spices over it, then oil. closed bag and rolled it around gently. Then cooked it on the bar-b-que grill on foil. Med./low heat about 30 mins turning after 15 mins. Family loved it!!!

I used cauliflower and broccoli in this recipe. The seasonings were very tasty. I also used olive cooking spray. I didn't cut small enough so I did end up cooking them a bit longer and family really liked it. I've been asked to make it again already.

This was quite good. My kids have never liked cauliflower, but they were ok with this. I did use olive oil as others suggested.

This is a really fun, easy way to make cauliflower that non-cauliflower lovers will eat. I omitted the sugar and it didn't need it, IMHO. Used Sesame Oil instead of Olive Oil because I was out of OO, but otherwise everything was the same. I'll make it again.

I and my family love roasted veggies. This was awesome I have made it several times switching things around just to see what everyone likes best and tonight I'm trying with honey, garlic, smoked paprika , a pinch of cayenne, and a tbsp of soy sauce. I mix everything together couple hours earlier to let the flavor  marinade then roast @ 400 till its roasted so far every way we've tried we love it thanks for sharing your awesome recipe!!!!!

This was a great suggestion for preparing cauliflower.  I experimented with the spices and oil also.  I used one small cauliflower head, cut into bite size bits, put in a bowl and tossed with 2 tsp. of olive oil since I don't use cooking spray.  I added salt, garlic & onion powder, cajun/creole seasoning mix and cumin seed to taste.  I like the basic recipe and the prior suggestion to change the seasonings to match what it is being served with.

This recipe was fine, but I don't think the turmeric and paprika added anything to the flavor.  Also I prefer my roasted cauliflower more crunchy, so I'm going to stick to the Roasted Cauliflower 'Steaks' by SPetrocelly from this site. They roast at 450 degree for 35 minutes (flipping after 20 min) and also use the onion and garlic powder.

I am not a fan of  cauliflower, but let me just say that I am now a  HUGE fan after finding this recipe!! I made it the first time w/ the sugar, but found it to be too sweet. The 2nd I made it, I omitted the sugar, and it was absolutely perfect. I added enough olive oil in the bowl with the spices to cover the cauliflower and a pinch more of the recommended spices. Definitely a keeper!!

These were great! Easy to make and true to the recipe. Next time though I'll add less salt - too much for me! I'll also remember to use a bit more cauliflower - the pieces shrink up quite a bit and there's not as much there as you might think.  Great taste though!

I love the suggestions. I had found that sugar could be cut in half. Good to know I can eliminate it completely! Also, I recommend sesame oil instead of olive oil. (I bet avocado oil is great too.) Olive oils is best used at room temp. Some other oils are generally better for high heat. This recipe is AWESOME with sesame oil!

Has a good sweet/salty ratio.
I eased up on the sugar just a smidge and used onion flakes instead of onion powder to make it a little less powerful, but that's just my taste.

I added a little allspice to the mix. Loved it!  Also used a little olive oil instead of spray. I'm vegetarian and this will be a regular dish in our house.

I mixed together the spices in 2 Tbs of olive oil,  omitted the sugar, and tossed the cauliflower in it until all coated.  I baked it for 45 minutes and it was delicious! My 2 year old who usually doesn't eat vegetables loved it too!!

We did not love this.  I cut the sugar to half, used olive oil instead of the spray. There was too much spice to this for us.... maybe it was the turmeric that over powered it all?

This was awesome! I didn't have any cooking spray so I melted some butter and drizzled over it instead. I added some cayenne pepper, (we like a little spice)! My hubby loved it!

Definitely leave out the salt, which makes it in edible, otherwise it's delicious.
