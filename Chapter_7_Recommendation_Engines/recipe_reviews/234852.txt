This was just ok for me. It seemed to be missing something and I think it was a texture thing for me.  This reminded me of mashed potatoes with stuff added, Tasty, but not something I would make on purpose.  My only change was browning the sausage up a bit to get some texture and using an apple cinnamon tea with a bit of maple syrup added... could not find maple tea.
