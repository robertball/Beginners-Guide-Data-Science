John-These were very easy to make and sooo good.  I didn't see where the water was to be added on the directions so I added that in when I added the sugar and corn syrup - I believe that was correct.  Thanks again!

Recipe doesn't mention the water so that went in with the sugar and syrup. Forgot to put the walnuts in, but still turned out great!

I had the same problem!  Even made it twice, brought the 1st batch to 290 & the 2nd got to 300 - had to throw both away...   It is the 1st time I am making toffee with white sugar - don't know if that is giving me the problem or not, but going back to my brown sugar recipe...  so disappointed!

This was good even without the extra smearing of chocolate and nuts on top.

My mother used to have this recipe (or one like it) and it was so easy and so good. I went looking for a similar recipe and found this one. It came out just the way I remember it. A lot easier than most candy making and delicious.

Very nice recipe, but it does take some experience to make this type of candy,  If you are inexperienced like  GAMSJAGER you may want to try making something for the simple such as the pudding poke cake that you rave about- bleh.  Thank you for posting this one, it looks lovely as well.

I had never made toffee before, but had decided to send candy to relatives this year.  This was very easy and tasted great!

I don't know what went wrong, but this turned out to be a dish full of sugary pebbles. I couldn't even remove it from the dish, or it would have disintegrated into a mound of gravel. And yes, I followed the directions meticulously (even though what to do with the water was not mentioned at all, I did as others suggested and added it with the sugar and corn syrup). I've made plenty of candies, including toffees, but this was a nightmare. I have to wonder, why so few reviews on such an old recipe? Is it simply because those who had the same disastrous outcome as myself didn't bother to come back to warn others?

This is delicious! I love toffee and chocolate together. My sister-in-law makes a very similar recipe, but she does not melt the chocolate chips beforehand. You just sprinkle them on top of the toffee before it cools and the chips will melt and spread out on their own. Then sprinkle the nuts or whatever toppings you like. Great recipe.

If you want this recipe to work, skip syrup and water completely and add a bit of salt (1/8 tsp). Do not stir too often after sugar dissolves.

This recipe was great! My husband doesn't normally like toffee, but can't stop eating this! I doubled the batch and used a sheet cake pan instead of a 9x9.

The use of a candy thermometer is essential to this recipe. I’ve never had any toffee with the nuts mixed into it, so I suggest toasting the walnuts first. The toffee was sweet enough alone so I used 60% cacao chocolate chips. 
Regardless of the type of nuts used, this is a perfectly respectable toffee and one I will make again! 

For those confused where the water is used, it’s stated in step one.

I missed the water, so that may make a difference.  My square baking pans were in use, so I used a 9 x 13 pan. They were still a little too thick for me, so next year i may use my 11 x 14 pan. I had an issue with the wslnuts falling off, so I will look for a remedy for that also.
Word to the wise....don't let it cool too much in the pan or it might not come out!! Lol
Overall, I like this recipe & I'll make it again. Thanks!
