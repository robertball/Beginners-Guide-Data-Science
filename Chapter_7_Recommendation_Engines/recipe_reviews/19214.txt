I have very mixed feelings about this recipie.  First off, there was way too many chocolate chips.  I love chocolate but this was over kill.  Maybe if you used milk chocolate it wouldn't be as bad.  I did like the rice crispies in them.  It was different but it didn't make these cookies as unique and unordinary as I thought they would be.  One hint, when they come out of the oven after 10 minutes, they really appear to be raw.  I found that after sitting on the pan for 5 minutes and then cooling down that they did firm up but I still ended up baking most of them for 12 minutes and prefered the end result of those ones better.  I might make these cookies again, but i will definetly be cutting down the chocolate or changing it to milk so they are not as rich.

This recipe is fantastic!!! Each cookie is consistent, loaded with chocolate chips, and delicious! I won't make any other chocolate chip recipe again, this is the one to make!

I liked the idea of this cookie, but didn't have some of the ingredients on hand.  I took the advice of another reviewer and halved the choco chips, but used Cocoa Krispies instead of Rice Krispies.  Something seemed to be missing and it wasn't sweet enough, though, so added another 1/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup chocolate syrup, and 1/4 cup peanut butter.  The cookies came out pretty tasty then.  Liked that about the recipe, that it was so easily adaptable to taste and creativity.  Would make again.

This cookie was not as good as I expected, but I think it could be quite improved by reducing the amount of chocolate chips.  There were just way too many of them.  If I were to try these again, I would reduce the chocolate chips by half to let more of the cookie batter's flavor come through.  Also, like others have said, the Rice Crispies added a different texture than expected, less crunchy and instead more chewy than I thought they would be.

This cookie had such promise. 
everything about it sounded delightful..but believe what you hear.. the cereal crisp turns into "moosh" and leaves the cookie with an odd texture.. 
and yes 4 cups of choc. chips.. WAY too much.. all in all good idea.. yet it failed to meet a 5 star rating. No go on this cookie ever again.

Don't add the water...they don't need it.  And the additional water makes them puffy and cakey rather than chewy.

The texture of these was weird. Definitely not crunchy like you would expect. I might try adding more rice cereal next time.

These were so good right out of the oven!  I used the chocolate chips I had on hand which were the dairy/gluten free mixed with a little bit of reg. semi sweet.  I too reduced to 2 cups and it was plenty.  I cant imagine what they would have turned out like with 4 cups! Thank you for a different use for rice cereal other than krispy treats!

I didn't like the consistency; excessively tough and chewy. It tasted much better as dough (before eggs were added, of course!)

The cookies are good but the texture of the rice krispies was different than what I expected.  They came out chewy/crunchy, not crispy/crunchy.  The overall cookie taste was still really good though.  I also halved the chocolate chips and there was plenty.

I only used 2 cups of chocolate chips and that was plenty, 4 would be overkill.  Next time I will bake longer, maybe 12 -14 minutes i found them too soft, I like a little crunch. I will make them again for sure, love the krispies!!

The idea of this recipe is good however, it needed some tweaking. I didnt have rice krispies on hand, but i had fruity pebbles! First off, i cut the recipe in half, the full one would have made WAY to many! I also only added 1 cup of chocolate chips not 2, which would have been way too much! After baking, they turned out great! Colorful and delicious! Personally, i would have added more Fruity Pebbles to get more of a crunch. Definitely making again... with more fruity pebbles and less chocolate chips!

This recipe was pretty good. it didnt have as much "crispy" as i thought it would, though. it was more crunch/chewy. i also used 1 1/2c milk choc chips and 1 1/2c of butterscotch chips and 1c of walnut chips. very good mix of flavors. will make again. thanks
