Not so hot - there are some good sloppy joe recipes here, avoid this one. Did like the simplicity of it.

This was certainly lacking.  It was pasta sauce on a bun.  In addition to the onion, to my ground beef, I like to add brown sugar, green pepper, worcestershire sauce, and maybe a bit of prepared yellow mustard.  I simmer slowly and adjust it until it's just right!

I would not serve this to anyone as sloppy joes, pasta sauce has no comparison to sloppy joes.

This tastes nothing like a sloppy joe. It's nothing more than pasta meat sauce thrown onto a bun and labeled as "Italian-Flavored".

I thought this was really good and so did the rest of the family.  But, we like our food sort of plain with nothing weird in it.  I couldn't find the chunky spaghetti sauce, so I just used the traditional.  But, we probably would have liked it better that way anyway. It probably could have used some salt, maybe some garlic, and brown sugar.  But, it's pretty good as is.
