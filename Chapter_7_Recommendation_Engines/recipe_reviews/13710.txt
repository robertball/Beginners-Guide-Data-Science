Small chef in small restaurant always looking for good side dishes. I usually shy from "soup' ingredients but follwed through with a few good changes. I began with half the butter in which I sauted 1 shallot, minced, and the 4 cloves of crushed garlic (fresh). I then added the 1 tbs of flour and let it cook slightly. I then added the can of soup, let it thicken and then thinned it a bit with 1/4 to 1/2 chicken stock. I the chopped 2 bags of baby spinach, about an inch or so thick and after the heat is off folded it gently into the sauce mixture. I did not let it cook. Placed it all in a 9X13 buttered dish - topped it with 1 cup Panko crumbs, seasoned with S&P and a little Olive oil. I baked it for 15-20 min just to bring it to heat and crisp the topping. Rave reviews...Please try it with the fresh spinach and you will never go back to frozen.

My husband and I really liked this dish.  I used cream of mushroom soup instead of celery. I also melted only half the butter and cooked the onion in it before adding the other ingredients.  I don't like raw onions which I think these would have been because the dish comes together so quickly.  I don't think cutting down on the butter hurt it one bit. I will certainly make this again.

This recipe was quick and easy.  I had recently visited a farm market and purchased a large quantity of fresh spinach, which I blanched and chopped.  Had on hand cream of mushroom instead of celery soup. Sauted the onions in just 2 T. of butter instead of 4, omitted adding any additonal salt and used 1/2 Tsp. powdered garlic.  It was scrumptous!  My husband suggested trying it next time not sauting the onions for the added crunch.  This man hates creamed spinached, but gobbled this down and said I should definitely make it again.

Very good, but it's more like a dip or a variation of creamed spinach. You really don't need butter and flour, the cream soup makes it thick enough. I ended up adding some milk to thin it out a bit. I also substituted with scallions and cream of mushroom soup.

Another keeper!!! Followed recipe exactly and it was on the mark.  I had put this in my shopping list so I did have Cream of Celery on hand and I wouldn't change that - I'm sure it gave the spinach more flavor than using Cream of Mushroom.  I thawed my spinach very early in the day and  three times during the day I put the spinach in a paper towel and squeezed out the water. It was a great consistancy when I was ready to cook it.  Thanks sumbitter.

This side dish is deeelicious!!  I saute the chopped onions in olive or butter for 5 minutes first. There is no need to add the flour or additional salt. Second of all, I used Campbell's cream of chicken/mushroom soup. Third of all, make sure your spinach is squeezed DRY (as dry as possible).
I do it by hand over a colander. You can add 1 Tbsp of milk or so if it is too thick. This is one of my favorite side dishes. Thank you Stephanie!!

Great dish.  I used fresh baby spinach,  added fresh mushrooms and garlic.  I sauted the onions, musrooms and garlic before adding the soup, flour, and chopped spinach.  I then added panko bread crumbs and baked for 20 minutes at 375, then topped with parmigiano cheese just before serving.

My family enjoyed this side dish.  I actually doubled the amount of spinach called for and kept the rest of the ingredients the same, and added some light cream during cooking to thin it out some.  It made enough for 2 meals, so I could freeze half of it for another meal.  I sauteed the onion in the butter first to soften them, then added the flour and stirred it a bit to cook out the "floury" taste, and then added the soup, spinach and cream.  Right before serving I added about 1/3 cup of Parmesean cheese.  Quick and easy side dish!

The only thing I changed on this was instead of using onions, I added a half a can of finely chopped water chestnuts to give it some texture.  Thanks

Not that good to me: very bland compared to normal creamed spinach. I used fresh spinach and garlic (why wouldn't you?).tried "as is" and then added some italian seasoning and red pepper flakes in attept to fix. Still blah. Also~ canned soup is extremely salty! Don't add extra salt before tasting!!!

This was really easy and quite tasty. I made only a couple very minor adjustments.  I sauteed the onion prior to adding the other ingredients, as I don't like the taste of raw onion, and I felt this was a little "thick" once completed, so I added about 1/2 can of evaporated milk and simmered until thick and creamy.  Delicious!  I'll definitely be pulling this one out again!

Great flavor and supper quick side-dish! Perfect for any occasion! Thanks for recipe. It is keeper for sure.

This recipe was a big hit for Easter dinner.  I followed the chef's recipe and used fresh spinach - only I couldn't find panko breadcrumbs, so I used about 2 tblsp of breadcrumbs and 2 of parmesan cheese - a big hit.  Spinach was a little watery, so I might cut back on the other liquid next time.

I didn't care for this recipe, but that was my personal taste, I don't like celery, and the celery taste really came through. I think if I made it again with cream of chicken I would like it better!! 
I did however find it incredibly easy to make and my 14 month old daughter LOVED it, so I will still give it four stars!!

I only used about a quarter of an onion (sauteed in butter before adding to the casserole) and it was delicious.  I would suggest doubling the recipe since it's so good.

This initially reminded me of the kind of thing my mother would have made me sit at the table staring at while my friends were all outside playing some twenty years ago.  "EAT YOUR VEGGIES!"  Now, it's quite good!  As the restaurant owner said below...using canned soup is never a good thing, it's loaded with preservatives (sodium) and the recipe did taste rather salty to me.  I think I'll keep this one around but won't make regularly.

This was a very nice recipe.  I used cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery (what i had in the pantry), and added a small can of mushrooms.  Holiday-Meal worthy.  Thanks for the recipe!

Yummy!!!  I used cream of mushroom instead of celery... and it was awesome.  My 23 month old ate 2 helpings for supper and 2 more the next day at lunch.  I think it was even better reheated.  I will make this again, and again, and...

I tweaked this recipe to suit what I had on-hand....Here's what I did in lieu of returning to the store I used both fresh as well as frozen spinach (b/c I did not have enough of either) total it was approx 16oz...I sauteed 1 center stalk of celery LEAVES included (wanted celery flavor but couldn't use canned soup) along with the onion, 2 T fresh minced garlic as well as 1/2 pkg fresh Baby bella mushrooms (cut in bite size pcs). I also sauteed both types of spinach w/this mixture. While I was cooking the moisture out I mixed the following b/c I don't use canned soups due to a special diet: 1/2c Sour Cream, 1/2c Roasted onion Greek Yogurt, and 1/2c Olive oil mayo...1 c shredded sharp cheddar cheese, 1/2 c shredded Parmesan cheese, 1/4 c Feta Cheese small crumbles (hubby and I LOVE cheese)...plus 1 beaten egg. No French's onion on-hand either so I toasted 1c of my own bread crumbs and added 1/4 c Parmesan cheese, 1t Fine Herbs, 1t Dried Shallots and 1/2t Garlic Powder Mixed in 1-2 pats of melted butter. When veggies were free of moisture I added these to the cream mixture along w/ approx 1 T dried Shallots. Salt and Peppered to taste...sprinkled w/bread crumbs and baked 25-30min @350...It was a lil tangy b/c of the Sour Cream and Greek Yogurt so next time I will omit 1 and so a lil more mayo! This is a keeper:)

This was an easy recipe.  I think I made the error of not squeezing out the excess water from the frozen spinach and that caused it to be watery.  I also, decided to saute the onions first for added flavor and I also added Parm. Cheese.  I will try it again with a few modifications.
