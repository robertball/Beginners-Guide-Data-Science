This was very good! I recommend having all the ingredients prepped & ready before cooking. It comes together quick! My rice noodles required a bit of cooking; not sure if I should have used hotter water or if it was due to a brand difference. I used macadamia nut oil & sesame oil since that was on hand, otherwise it was made as stated. Next time I will reduce the sugar, since it was a bit too sweet for me. It was  flavorful and could be used as the whole meal.

The flavors were great! I added shrimp, snow peas, and tofu to mine....incredible! The only problem was the noodles, but that was my fault. I soaked the noodles like the recipe said to, but I didn't realize until later that the noodle package said to boil the noodles. My bad. Just be sure to check the package and do what it says.

Crunchy and delicious. Didn't have flax seed oil so I didn't use, (or miss) it!

The noodles were very good, but with the lettuce and sprouts, it was a very odd combination.  Next time, I'd just make the noodles with chicken in it, and serve it hot without the lettuce.

Very scary that your  Phad  Thai recipe  has soy sauce instead of the traditional tamarind sauce. Celiacs count on Phad Thai being gluten free.   Someone is going to make this and guests will think it is gluten free as we have never seen soy sauce in Phad Thai.

I was looking for a new pad Thai sauce, so I used just that part of the recipe.  It was amazing, perfect for my pad Thai.  I tripled the recipe for a full pack of rice noodles.

I added an extra tablespoon of soy sauce and a little more chili powder. Great noodle bowl!

I liked it but prefer spicier food.  Also the Tamarind concentrate was difficult to find.  I finally found it at Whole Foods and it was nearly $12 for a 4 oz jar....yowzer!  Also who the heck has flaxseed oil on hand?  I skipped the oil since I already broke the bank on the Tamarind.  I stir fried some top sirloin cut up/seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic powder and added that.  My wife will probably like this because she can't tolerate anything spicy.  Next time I'll probably use shrimp in the dish.  Thanks for this recipe

This was delicious! My noodles should have been softer and it was still good. I also didn't have Tamarind and it was still good. :) yum!
