As a personal chef, this is a client favorite. And I've gotten some clients on diets approval by replacing half the flour w/ whole wheat flour & replacing the heavy cream w/ part half & half and part skim milk. I also used whole wheat lasagna noodles for special clients.

I brought this to a big party and it was a big hit!  One suggestion:  Let the cream mixture thicken a bit before removing it from the heat.  Otherwise, it's very runny.

THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST LASAGNAS I HAVE EVER MADE.  I USED MILK INSTEAD OF CREAN THOUGH.  I ALSO ADDED ROMANO CHEESE.  VERY ADDICTIVE.  THANKS, M. STOCK

Very good recipe, but next time I would probably omit the cream. When combined with the "marina" sauce, there was way too much sauce. It would probably be great without the cream as the red sauce is marvelous! Also, I would probably add more spices since the addition of the cream made it taste somewhat bland. Otherwise a very tasty vegetarian meal. Thanks for the recipe!

My daughter was coming to dinner and informed all of us she had become a vegetarian.  I was at a loss to figure out what to serve as a main entree.  This recipe filled the bill.  Everybody loved this dish.  My daughter was thrilled, and she took the leftovers home with her.  The only thing I did different to the recipe, was to add more Parmesan cheese to the topp before baking.  Thank you Holly!

I followed this recipe pretty close.

Used way more sun-dried tomatos and chicken broth instead of the wine. I only made about 1/2 of the white sauce. I liked it but it was missing the WOW factor.
My family prefers a meaty lasanga.... oh well cant please everyone :)

My family loves this recipe - they say it tastes even better the second day.  Takes work to make it but worth it.  
I add a whole package of Sun-Dried Tomatoes - it really make a difference.

I made this for a friend who is allergic to mushrooms so I omitted them. I added cream of chicken soup into the vegetable mixture after it had simmered and thickened. when my friend tasted it she called and said "this lasagna is fabulous you could sell this stuff." I haven't tried it myself, but the aroma was wonderful. I also whisked the white sauce a while over medium heat until it thickened.(the recipe doesnot state this. so this was a definite hit!

Oh, hello! Yum, Yum, Yum!!! I added one minced jalapeno, 3X the sun dried tomatoes, fresh thyme, 2 cups italian cheese mix instead of parmesan and did not use celery. I used a box of rotini instead of lasagne noodes and just mixed it all together in one pot instead of layering (it all winds up mixed up anyway). I also used 1 tbsp butter + 1 tbsp olive oil to make the roux. This recipe made a ton.  It is far from healthy, but who cares?!  Tasty comfort food!

I would give this recipe more stars if I could.  My husband FINALLY asked me for seconds which he hardly does, he's exact comment was and I quote "The BEST LASAGNA you've ever made."  I was actually able to stop myself while in middle of eating this dish just to comment on how YUMMY this dish turned out.  The best white sauce I've ever tasted in any lasagna.  I'm planning on making this dish again when our guest come over next week. Things I did differently was I allowed the white sauce to thicken a little longer (advise I read from other reviews on this recipe).  I omitted the wine just because I don't cook or use wine nor did I add any broth, I just added everything else it said plus a ton of garlic (5 or 6) and some basil (about 1 teaspoon) as well.  I also added 2 to 4 teaspoons of sun-dried tomato marinated in oil (Julienne Cut) and I'm so glad I did because it complimented the flavors of this meal even more.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent recipe and better for you than one with meat and lots of cheeses.  I made it with three layers of lasagna noodles (9 noodles total).  I can't see using an entire 16 ounce box unless the mushroom sauce volume is increased considerably.  I used one cup of whipping cream and milk for the balance.  The white sauce thickens while baking.  I used one package of dried tomatoes and the lasagna was flavorful and looked great!  Try it!

Made this using 1% milk instead of the cream, no mushrooms or celery (put in some diced green pepper that I had on hand instead) and at least 10 sundried tomatoes.  I can't see calling it 'sun-dried tomato lasagna' if you don't have plenty of them running through the dish!  Anyways, it turned out great and relatively healthy.

I liked this a lot.  My kids weren't too excited about it, but oh well.  I did change it quite a bit, though.  I omitted the celery, carrots and mushrooms.  I tripled the sun dried tomatoes.  I ran the diced tomatoes through the blender so there wouldn't be chunks and I put a thin layer of mozarella over the top to make it look nicer.  I wouldn't recommend the no-boil lasagna noodles for this because there's not enough moisture in it to soften them very much.  Also, next time, I'll double the amount of diced tomatoes because I would have like it a bit wetter.  All in  all, it was very tasty and a nice change.

This was very good, but the white sauce came out very bland. I ended up using my own white sauce based on Bechamel recipes on this site. I mixed the finished Bechamel sauce with a bunch of squeezed out, thawed spinach and also put down a layer of fresh spinach where called for. Also, I salted and patted dry slices of zucchini to use in place of the noodles. I will make this again, with these modifications. Thanks for the recipe! The red sauce is great.

This recipe was amazing! My friend made it for dinner one night, and we had it for breakfast and lunch the next day! I love the combination of the red sauce with the white...

Just know that this does make A LOT of food, so maybe cut it in half if you are feeding 4 or less!

I have made this many times, and though I can never get as many layers as the recipe suggests, this vegetarian lasagna gets more raves than any other company dish I make.  I often add a little jar spaghetti sauce to the tomato/mushroom mixture to make it a bit denser.  My favorite AllRecipes recipe! Oh - I also always use a whole package of the sun dried tomatoes

Both my husband and I really liked this lasagna, even with removing the dry white wine from the recipe. I wouldn't say it is a kid-pleaser at all, but it definitely has a great flavor that would be great in any pot luck with adults!

Absolutley delicious! I did follow another suggestion and used an entire pouch of sun-dried tomatoes. I also would double the red sauce ingredients just because I like a lot of sauce. Finally, I substitued a zuchinni for the mushrooms, and I added a bit more nutmeg to the white sauce. Between 4 people we finished the entire lasagna in one evening!

quite awesome.  I just don't see how you can actually use 8 cups of spinach with this recipe.  I probably used like a cup.

This was a very tastey recipe.  Although it was a lot of work it was worth it in the end.  The cream was a little runny, but I thickened it with cornstarch/water mixture.

My husband made this for dinner last night. It was a really nice surprise to come home to let me tell you! The only thing was that he left out several key ingredients that I think would have made all the difference. He didn't have any type of sauce on the top layer of noodles. All he did was put a light sprinkle of parm cheese and it didn't do anything but dry out the top layer of noodles making them too chewy and crunchy for my liking. Also, he left out the wine and the onions. I think he may have left out the nutmeg too, but not certain. I'm an onion and garlic lover, so i was a little sad that there weren't any onions in here, and I can see where they would really bring this dish to life. The missing wine would really round out the flavors overall. But the kicker is that when i removed the top layer of dried out noodles, I thought he had cooked with wine. He laughed b/c he said the recipe called for it but he left it out. It's still very tasty without these key ingredients. But I'm going to make this recipe myself sometime soon using all the ingredients here and see if it doesn't come out more moist.

This was very good and my entire family devoured this. Tweaked a few things, but it is pretty much the same recipe.

I was really excited to try this-seemed like it would have a very unique and different flavor...and it did.  But, we didn't really like that flavor.  I think the thyme was a bit much, and overall it was just A LOT of work for something that tasted funky.  I think its a good idea-spinach and sun dried tomato lasagna, but without the carrot, celery, nutmeg, thyme...and with some other italian flavors such as basil.  I'll give it the unique factor!

I made this recipe and after following the directions as written, also found it "missing" something at our first eating.  I will definitely make it again, and double the spices like a previous reviewer commented.  I would also add more of the sun-dried tomatoes.  The second day, it indeed tasted even better.  A keeper!

This was a delicious recipe.  My family is used to lasagna with red sauce, and I wanted to try something different when we had company.  Everyone Loved it including the KIDS.  They asked for 2nds and said it was a keeper

Excellent recipe for vegetarian guests.  I followed suggestions and added extra sundried tomatoes.  It was fabulous and great reheated also.

This was wonderful. I did add a bunch more sun dried tomatoes. I also cooked the cream until it turned into a gravy consistancy. Therefore, my lasagna was not runny at all. My meat loving hubby LOVED it! It is a definite MAKE AGAIN!!!

This was very good.  I couldn't help myself, though.  I had to add some mozzarella, but I don't think that changed the flavor much - just added some more cheese, and that's my favorite thing about lasagna.  I also made the white sauce a bit too thick because I was concerned about it being runny.  It ended up being too thick to pour onto the lasagna, and I kind of had to spread it.  I'll have to watch that next time.

I made this for my family last night. I wasn't too up for a meatless dish so I added chicken breast in with the mushroom sauce.  I also added a can of seasoned diced tomatoes at the end cuz I wanted it more saucy. I am lactose intolerant so I made the heavy whipping cream with rice milk. I think I would have liked it better without the white sauce. It was pretty tasty though & I was very excited I could eat it without taking a lactaid pill. My husband said he would have liked it better without the chicken though.

Great recipe! I love the addition of sun-dried tomatoes. I served this with a fresh Ceasar Salad and my family thoroughly enjoyed the meal! Thanks for the recipe:)

The nice thing about this recipe is that you can use whatever vegetables you have on hand..I used bell peppers and asparagus in place of the carrot, onion and mushrooms and it turned out great.  The only thing I would change is add more sun dried tomatoes...they are so good that 2 is not enough!  Tasted great!

Great recipe!  I used a jarred white sauce (Low cal), diced tomatoes, sun-dried tomato pesto , and zucchini instead of carrots (didn't have any) and it turned out wonderfully. You don't even miss the cheese. Thanks for a great change of pace.

This lasagna is the best I have ever made or tasted.  My boyfriend loves it too although he was skeptical at first because the recipe didn't include meat and lots of greasy cheese.  I will definitly make this one again, as often as possible.
