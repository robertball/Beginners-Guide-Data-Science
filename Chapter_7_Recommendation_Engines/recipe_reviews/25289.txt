I gave this 4 stars because I didn't change the ingredients. It's a good combination.  I knew I'd end up with a goopy mess by mixing bread crumbs and parmesan cheese with melted butter so here's how I made it: I steamed the cauliflower instead of boiling it. Added the red pepper flakes to the melted butter and poured it over the cauliflower then  lightly sprinkled cauliflower with bread crumbs (about an 1/8 cup) then sprinkled on 1/4 cup parmesan cheese and topped it off with 1 cup of extra sharp cheddar and baked as directed.

I liked this and will make it again but may I please make 3 suggestions? This recipe has the potential for greatness but there are some changes necessary. 
#1 Reduce the breadcrumbs; I agree with one of the previous reviewers~ 2/3 cup is way too much, it absorbs all of the liquid. 
#2 Use a combination of cheese mixtures; Cheddar and American, Cheddar and Jack etc..it works! Last, feel free to use frozen cauliflower, if you like. I encourage the folks to give this recipe another try, it is a delicious way to get the family to eat "white brocolli".

This recipe is very good. If you would like to try a 'lite' version of this recipe, you can omit the butter. I combined this recipe with a recipe I already make.  I make sure the cauliflower is well cooked and drained well, then mash it with a potato masher. Without using any butter, I blend the parmesan, salt and pepper, then top with the bread crumbs and more parmesan.  Both ways make a great way to make cauliflower yummy!

I made this recipe the same way as VICSGARDEN did (I'll copy/paste his review).  The only thing I changed about the recipe is that I mixed the bread crumbs and other seasonings together before sprinkling onto the cauliflower.  

From VICSGARDEN:
I gave this 4 stars because I didn't change the ingredients. It's a good combination. I knew I'd end up with a goopy mess by mixing bread crumbs and parmesan cheese with melted butter so here's how I made it: I steamed the cauliflower instead of boiling it.

This was an excellent recipe! I didn’t have the problem of butter pooling on the bottom, but wish the crumb topping had been a little more dry & crunchy for my tastes. Maybe next time I’ll add more bread crumbs and less butter. Also, adding broccoli is an excellent idea, it will give it better color too. It was a little overpowering to get a bite of just bread topping, so instead of sprinkling the bread topping on top, I’ll mix it in with the cauliflower/broccoli in a bowl before adding to the casserole dish, this way, every bite of cauliflower also has the tasty topping. Also, the casserole layer was too thin, so next time I’ll make a double batch, thus it’ll be a layer of cauliflower/broccoli with bread topping, cheese sprinkled on top, followed by a second layer of cauliflower/broccoli with bread topping, finished with cheese on top. With these changes I think it’ll be a hit at the office Christmas potluck. I can’t wait!

This was very enjoyable but I couldn't help to add a few things, I browned some sweet onion, garlic and diced jalapeno into a very small amount of butter (maybe 1/8 c or less) and tossed the 1/2 head of steamed cauliflower into in the pan then transferred it to an 8x8 and covered with a lite shredded cheese. Did not use parmesan.  When steaming the cauliflower, I put italian seasoning, garlic and hot pepper flakes into the water for added flavour.

I made this for my husband and myself, and it was great!It was very easy and something different to serve with dinner. My husband's only comment was, maybe more cheese (but he always says that). I will scale down the red pepper, but that's just a personal preference. Thanks for posting!

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  It was rather spicy from the red pepper flakes, so those could definitely be cut down along with the bread crumbs.  It also was on the high fat side, the bottom was swimming in butter.  I also ended up adding extra cheese to it because once the topping was eaten, the rest of the cauliflower was plain.

Sorry for the lessthangreat review ... 'Wasn't that great.  I cut it into florets & steamed it.  Then, cut it more.  Mixed in the butter, red pepper, salt & parmesan.  Placed that in a casserole.  Topped w 1/4c bread crumbs & cup o'cheddar.  I like cauliflower, but this recipe just kinda sat there with the "Here I am" look - if ya know what I mean.  :D  Maybe the top cheddar was just too much.  I used half the butter amount, too.  'Wasn't dry, just bleh. Next day:  Just had leftovers.  Found out what others like about it.  It's the butter.  Yeah, it's the butter.  I halved it, but it really yummed it up as it sat overnight.

This was a great recipe!  I would only recommend less bread crumbs (and this is coming from a bread crumb lover).  Add little by little to taste.  You'll most likely only use a little over a 1/4 cup.

This was pretty darn good! I made it for my roommate and I. We didn't know what we wanted to dinner but we had a cauliflower head. I didn't really change the recipe much except that I first tossed the cauliflower with the butter (drained the excess butter too) and then added the other ingredients. I also added a little bit of cheddar cheese to the mixture as well as some bread crumbs over the final topping of cheese.  OH! i also added about 1/2C onion to the mixture! it gave ti a really nice taste!!!Ultimately, this was a very good cheap meal! will think about making it again!

Made this for dinner tonight. Steamed the cauliflower for about 10 mins & that was really long enough.  I cut the butter to 1/4 cup, & used Kellogg Crushed Cornflake crumbs.  I put the cheese on for about the last 8 mins while it was baking.  It was wonderful. My husb had 2nds............. and that really rarely happens w/ cauliflower!  Very good!!

This one was disappointing. I used fresh bread crumbs and added 1/2 teaspoon of Italian seasoning. It was too much, so that was my error. We also didn't like the way the butter pooled at the bottom of the dish. We would have preferred the cauliflower plain with a little margarine.

I buy whatever vegetable is on sale for each week. When cauliflower is on sale I buy it but only have one way to fix it. I tried this recipe b/c all ingredients are in the house already. I LOVED IT! My dad also loved it. I used less red pepper than called for. I have also made it w/broccoli and my husband loved it.

This has quickly become a family favorite! I leave the measurements the same, but substitute gluten free bread crumbs. The numbers work out perfectly.

This was a huge hit in our house. I was out of bread crumbs, so used Fritos (corn chips) instead. Highly recommend this one. It will become a regular in our veggie rotation.

This was delicious.  This is the first time I made cauliflower, and I will recommend and make this often.  I made the recipe as written, except I greased my casserole dish.  My husband loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very tasty and easy to prepare.  I omitted the butter to save a few calories and it still came out delicious.  I like the red pepper flakes and would have never thought to add them on my own.

I love this recipe. I don't use the butter, and I add a little bit of chopped garlic. I'll also use any cheese I've got in the house and it's always fantastic.

We thoroughly enjoyed this topping.  I briefly boiled a whole fresh broccoliflower head leaving the bottom in-tact with some small leaves to keep moisture in the vegetable.  Added the topping to the top of the head placing it in the oven for the time noted.  Serving the entire head on table  is a nice presentation.

I should have known better. In my opinion, cauliflower needs some sort of sauce. A little cheese or alfredo sauce mixed with the cauliflower, THEN topped with cheese & crumbs would have been better.

We love cauliflower and I'm always trying something different with it, but this just wasn't it for us.  Followed the recipe exactly and something seems to be missing, not much flavor there except bread crumb.

I think the "casserole" part of this recipe name is slightly misleading. It doesn't have the saucy/creamy base that we associate with a casserole. It should be called Roasted Cauliflower. But with that said, I still enjoyed it. It has a lot of flavor. I've also used other veggies when making this dish, including broccoli, peppers and brussels sprouts. Try it, but this ain't your mama's casserole!

I LOVE this recipe!  Quick and easy and very tasty.  I didn't find it dry at all but the cheddar got a little chewy.  I will probably leave it out next time.  It is tasty enough with just the bread crumb mix. (I didn't add the pepper either) YUM!

Good way to prepare cauliflower. However, the next time I make it, I would
reduce the amount of red pepper flakes by half.

I left out the red pepper flakes and substitued black pepper to taste since my toddler would be eating it. It was delicious and was a close replica to a casserole from our local bbq restaurant.

I read the reviews, and slightly varied the recipe.  I steamed the cauliflower and placed in casserole dish.  In a separate bowl I wisked aprox 1-2 tbsp of flour with about a half cup of cream (in place of the butter).  I poured cream mixture over the cauliflower, then tossed through my spice mixture (I used the parm, pepper and montreal steak spice-this is a good alternative to the crushed peppers for those who don't love the hot spice).  I topped it with old cheddar cheese and aprox 1/4-1/3 cup of the seasoned bread crumbs.  Baked on convection to give the bread crumbs with cheese a slight crisp.  It was delicious!!

Made this tonight and the whole family told me they loved it! I thought the red pepper flakes were just right for us because we like spicy but if you don't cut it back or don't use it. I did follow another reviewers advice and didn't  pre mix the ingredients in a bowl but layered it into the dish. Will be making this on the regular rotation.

Delicious recipe! I took the advice of a previous poster and steamed the cauliflower and reduced the bread crumbs to 1/8 cup. I decided to add about an extra tablespoon of butter and an additional 1/2 c cheese. I didn't use salt (I actually forgot, and didn't feel it really needed salt after it was cooked). I used a 9x13 glass dish. I mixed the melted butter and pepper flakes together and poured it over the cauliflower, then sprinkled the Parmesan cheese, then bread crumbs and finally the shredded cheese. Enjoy!

This was a awesome simple recipe! I precooked cauliflower till al dente. I felt a few issues in consistency would occur so instead of mixing in bread crumbs I put them on top (I used kraft Parmesan breadcrumbs) and baked for 15 minutes then mixed them in and added more on this time Panko and baked for another 15-20 mins. It was delicious and had an awesome crispy layer.

I made a few changes.  The first batch I made exactly like the recipe.  It was tasty but I found it to be a bit on the dry side.  Made a second batch the next day with the following changes.  I wanted a bit more spicy flavor and also wanted it to be a bit moister.

Added 1 medium onion, finely chopped.  Microwave for 2 minutes to soften slightly.  Also added 1 can of Rotel Original tomatoes with green chilies - drained.  I put the boiled cauliflower, onions, and Rotel into a bowl and combined them gently.  Then layered them (in my case it was two layers). I did NOT mix the butter with the dry like the original recipe calls for.  Instead I added roughly 1/2 of the melted butter to the first layer, then 1/2 of the dry ingredients sprinkled on top, and 1/2 the cheese.  Repeat for the top layer.  Baked for about 20 minutes and then added about a cup of shredded smoked chedder on top and left it in till the cheese melted.

It came out nice and moist with wonderful flavor from the onions and just a bit of kick from the Rotel.  Both the Wife and I loved it and it was gone quickly.

It's good. A great way to turn boring cauliflower into something more..
It did some more creaminess or moistness in my opinion. That's all!

I made this but I roasted the cauliflower with chopped garlic in the oven and put that into the casserole dish. For me, there was too much butter so next time I'll cut back. I also added  a litte grated asiago cheese just to kick up the flavor. It was very good.

A nice change.  The pepper flakes added a flavourable addition, but probably wouldn't be well received by kids. Will make again but not too often, only due to the amount of butter.

The only change I made was to use a 1 pound bag of frozen, steamed first.  Not really a change if you ask me but the was delish as is!

I used this recipe as-is and I thought it was a little dry. I think the person that suggested mixing the topping in with the cauliflower was spot on.

Tasted good, but I felt there was a little too much bread crumb mixture. Changes: I used frozen cauliflower, and added a little frozen broccoli, steaming both first in the microwave. I used red/cayenne pepper as I didn't have the flakes. Next time I might add egg to hold it together more... My husband's exact words, though: "this might be a new favorite"!

Very good, though I sprinkled the bread crumbs and parmesen on top to give it a nice crust rather than mix it all together as written.

I skipped the butter to keep the calories manageable and the recipe is still absolutely delicious. My husband, who only tolerates cauliflower, took seconds of this one. Also I steamed the cauliflower instead of boiling it.

Simple and delicious. I have made it twice, and the second time I tossed the topping and cauliflower prior to baking to get better coverage. I'll keep making this recipe.

followed exact instructions; just replaced parmesan with Colombian white cheese which was amazing! Oh, and I threw in some mushrooms that I had in the fridge. I would recommend making three layers so that the cauliflower in the bottom doesn't stay without any seasoning/flavoring. Excellent recipe.

I actualy like cauliflower, and I felt like the other ingredients completely overpowered the flavor of the cauliflower in this recipe, I wouldn't make it for me again.  However, my husband is not a fan of cauliflower and he said he liked this much better and would have it again. He still didn't like it enough to save the leftovers though :)

This was such a nice change from the usual drenched in cheese sauce cauliflower casserole...That's probably why people are complaining it's dry..I did lessen the butter and didn't measure the chili flakes, I also just sprinkled the cheese without measuring..I am sure I didn't use a cup...really easy and a good base to add other spices/cheeses to it as well..thanks for the recipe!!

It was a little oily from too much butter.  I would reduce the amount used next time.  I thought it could stand to have more chili peppers added for more of a kick.  I didn't have any cheddar on hand and had to use mozzarella, it was still good but next time I will use what is called for.

This is my favorite way to eat cauliflower now.  I changed very little.  I do make sure I break up the cauliflower small.  I use 1/2 tea red pepper flakes and add some fresh parmesan.  I mix all ingredients and pour over cauliflower before putting it in oven.

I read all the reviews and took people's advice to pour the melted butter and red pepper flakes over the cauliflower first and then cover with the other ingredients. I didn't have cheddar cheese at home so I used an Italian blend. It turned out wonderfully and the leftovers I brought to work for lunch reheated really well. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe!  I made a few adjustments; less butter & no pepper flakes.  It was excellent!  My kids loved it & so did I - hubby was ok with it but he dislikes cooked veggies.  I will definately make this again!

Indredibly fattening.  Incredibly delicious!  I will make this again when I feel like falling off the proverbial diet wagon.  Those crushed red peppers really add a punch for only 1 tsp.  As others noted, there was some excess butter in the bottom of the dish, so next time I might use only half a stick of butter.  Great recipe.

I made this recipe with mixed frozen vegetables instead of just cauliflower and it turned out great.  I cooked the vegetables beforehand so they we just a little undercooked and then prepared the dish.  I have to say that my family really liked this recipe but it might be because of all that butter.  I cut the butter quantity in half (1/4 cup)when I made and still, I felt there was way too much.  So next time I make it, I will probably only use a few tablespoons instead of of the recommended 1/2 cup.

This was pretty good.  I only used 1/3 cup of bread crumbs as suggested by someone else and left out the red pepper because my family doesn't care for it.  It was a pretty good recipe, but not something I will make often, if ever, again.

I thought this had good flavor but a little too buttery. Will try it again and cut back a bit on the butter.

I'm sorry, but my wife and I found this absolutely inedible. We were able scrape the cheese off the top and eat it, but had to discard the rest of the dish. The aroma was reminiscent of freshly caught fish, yet the flavor leaned more toward fish that had been caught long ago.

The first time I made this, we found it to be way to dry.  Next time, I added some basic white sauce, then the cheddar and topped with the crumb topping.  Excellent!

I tried this recipe, despite the fact that my husband hates cauliflower.  He complained about the smell while it was cooking, but he actually went for second helpings, and said it didn't taste anything like cauliflower.  We loved it and will make it again!

Pretty good....I added 1 c. sour cream and some cheese to the cooked cauliflower, mixed and put into a casserole. I then sprinkled more cheddar cheese and topped that with the crumb mixture. Baked till bubbly.... very tasty...I think next time I might mash the cauliflower, still add the sour cream ...etc., instead of the having the big florets. The butter also pooled to the bottom. Will try again, thanks!

I don't normally like cauliflower, so I was surprised that this was so good. I omitted the red pepper flakes, but that's just my personal preference.

This wasn't what I expected.  It tasted ok.  I would really cut down on the bread crumbs next time.  Good flavor though.  I think I expected something more creamy in texture.  May make again.  Husband thought it was "ok" as well.

This was good and different from the recipes I normally use for cauliflower. I spread it in a single layer in a 9 by 15 in. pan.Cut back pepperflakes to 1/2tsp. dotted the topping with extra butter,making sure all was covered with topping.The top was very tasty but it was still a little dry,I still think I prefer the sauce based recipes I use, I'm not sure if I would serve this to guests.

Yum! This was really tasty. We've tried with frozen AND fresh cauliflower; it works both ways. The only reason it didn't get five stars: too high a fat and calorie content to eat this regularly. But it sure is tasty. Also, we accidentally reversed the amounts of red pepper flakes and salt, putting in a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of red pepper flakes, and we really liked it that way!

Like a lot of the others, I found this extremely dry and will not make it again.  We LOVE cauliflower but this just didn't make the grade. I'll have to just stick with steamed cauliflower with cheese sauce.  Sorry

FOR THOSE WHO THINK THE RECIPE IS DRY; TRY BREAKING UP THE CAULIFLOWER AFTER COOKING IT AND USING A LITTLE LESS BREADCRUMBS....THAT SHOULD FIX THE PROBLEM.  THIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE SIDE DISHES FOR COMPANY..

I'm not sure why this seems to be getting such glowing reviews. I thought it was dry and uninteresting. I really like cauliflower, but I didn't like it this way. . .oh, well, different strokes for different folks!

The flavor was good but it needed a creamer cheese sauce.  For the left overs I made a basic cheese sauce to mix it in.

Here's what I changed: I mixed all the ingredients together except for the bread crumbs. Then I put the bread crumbs on top and drizzled with butter. This allowed for a crisp top (which would not happen if the cheese were on top). In addition I mixed in a few spoons of sun dried tomato pesto. Delicious.

Although I love spicy foods, I would cut the red pepper in half. I also only used a few tbls of butter.  Browned it under the broiler for a min after cooking time.

The family loved this recipe!  Very easy to make and tasted delicious.  Made it exactly as written and it turned out perfectly. The cauliflower stayed nice and hot throughout the entire meal which is why I love to bake my vegetables!

I didn’t think that I would be able to trick my husband into eating cauliflower instead of potatoes, but this recipe proved me wrong. Even when he found out what it was, he went back for seconds. Big win!

This casserole was delicious. As said in the description, even those who don't like cauliflower will like this dish. The cauliflower was tender and the remainder of the ingredients enhanced the flavor.

A good start but added a few twists. I sauteed some onion, garlic and sliced mushrooms in the same pan I pre cooked the cauliflower in. Then I used cornbread stuffing mix instead and mixed the sauteed mixture in with it.

I wouldn't have this every week, but it was quite filling.  We served it with a side of collared greens.  The cheese was a great touch, especially since there was so much of it.  :)

I used a mixture of broccoli and cauliflower. Not bad, but a little dry. I left out the butter, as some other reviewers suggested, and the topping was plenty tasty without it. I don't think it would have made the veggies moister anyway. If I make it again, I might mix in some cream of mushroom soup or try to find some other way to keep it moist.

This was deeelicious.  I followed what another poster said about steaming the cauliflower, and pouring the pepper flakes mixed with butter alone first.  I used less butter and it was still great. Then I added the dry ingredients.  (I used about 1.5 cups of sharp cheddar, for extra flavor).  Will make again and again. Good for low-carb diet as a sub for mashed potatoes.

This was so delicious!  I don't care for red pepper, so I omitted that.  I did steam the cauliflower, instead of boil it.  I sprinkled a light layer of salt over the cauliflower, before adding the remaining ingredients.  I didn't have Italian bread crumbs on hand, so I used plain Panko bread crumbs; and stirred in Italian powdered seasonings (basil, oregano, thyme, garlic, onion, black pepper, and a touch of salt.)  I followed the rest of the instructions as given.  This was so delicious that I wanted to eat the whole pan myself!

My husband is not a veggie lover, but he was eating mine off of my plate!!! This recipe is so good! I did cut the butter in half, used Colby Jack( because that's what I keep on hand), and panko bread crumbs, with fresh basil.  Will make it again!!!

I read some of the other reviews and incorporated some ideas.  Steamed the head,drained it well and transferred to 9" pie plate.  Took 1/4 stick of butter, 2 large garlic cloves, 2 big slices of red onions and large handful of chopped parsley.  Seasoned the Califlower with sea salt and pepper, then layer the sauted mixture loosely on top., sprinkled with Parmesan cheese.  Baked at 350 for about 12 minutes, added 3/4 cup of sharp cheddar, baked until it was bubbly.  I didn't want to use just bread crumbs, so I coarsly smashed Artisian bread cubes and sprinkled them over the top, turned the oven up to 400 degrees for about 5 minutes.  This resulted in flavorful vegetable, well seasoned, creamy center and a crunchy top. Will be doing this again!

This has become one of my favorite recipes.  I have made it to take along to pot luck dinners a couple of times now and it is always a hit.  I made some slight changes.  I do not mix the crushed red pepper in with the other ingredients.  Instead I do two layers of cauliflower and top each layer with the butter, Parmesan, bread crumb mixture and then sprinkle the red pepper flakes over each layer.  This seems to mix everything together a little  better.

This was easy to make and filling. My Pescatarian husband really liked it! He's hard to please, thinks, 'man mist have piece of fish Every night!' And that just gets to be way too darn expensive! Especially considering I've switched us to only wildcaught salmon and fresh fish from the organic market.    I Loved this recipe

I followed the recipe exactly and found it to be a bit dry and less cheesy than desired. So, after my first bowl I read some of the comments and decided to 1) mix it a little bit so all the ingredients and cheese were throughout 2)sprinkle on about a cup more cheese and 3) add a few slices of butter to the top. Then I threw it back into the oven at 300 degrees long enough for the cheese to melt. Next time I'll be sure to dial it back on the breadcrumbs and add lots more butter and cheese right from the start :-)

I really liked this. I left out the red pepper flakes because I forgot. I used the crumbs, butter and Parmesan. Since I didn't have Italian bread crumbs, I just added 1 t Italian seasoning. I cooked my cauliflower in the oven covered with a cup of water and a large sliced sweet onion since I was baking a very large meatloaf, then I drained off the remaining water and added the crumb topping mixture, baked for about 20 minutes. This was So awesome!!!!!

I tried to stay true to the posted recipe but I didn't have the red pepper flakes.  I used smoked paprika instead.  Either way the recipe was great.  Will be making it again.

For my first attempt I'm happy with the outcome of this casserole.  But a few things to mention:

I used margarine instead of butter, and I feel that 1/2 cup is too much for the combination of bread crumbs and parmesan cheese.  The mixture was a little soggy and soaked, IMO.  Next time I will be using 1/4 cup margarine or 1/2 a stick and see how that turns out.

I will also try cutting the florets smaller, as I created sizes that were more like what you'd see in a veggie platter.  I also did not use the pepper flakes as I one, did not have any, and two it didn't sound good with this mix.

But overall, this is a great side dish or even an entree.

I made this according to the recipe directions..might have added a little more butter, Parmeasan cheese and Cheddar cheese since I very rarely exactly measure, but thought this was GREAT!!!  Loved it and so did my dad.  I would definitely make this again.

My husband said I made it easy to eat cauliflower. Here is what I think. Cauliflower needs only 5 minutes of boiling. Otherwise it'll be too mushy. I replaced butter with olive oil and reduced pepper flakes to 1/2tsp. It tastes very good, but the bread crumbs might form sort of like a crust with the crumb mixture if you are using an aged cheddar cheese. We will be using this recipe in the future. Thanks!

Easy to  make, but did make some adjustments. Sprinkled, even amount of Parmesan and breadcrumbs, added only 1/4 cup of melted butter over the crumb mixture . The red pepper flakes add a ton of flavor, to an otherwise boring vegetable. I've made this several times and the additions are unlimited and so is your cheese choice.
Thank you for Sharing.

excellent!!, i did add the chopped onion as was suggested. My parmesan cheese was quite ripe which really added to the flavor. Lastly, I mixed everything together in the pot I boiled the cauliflower in and then baked it. Mixed a salad and that was our meal. Can't wait to make it again.

I brought this dish to Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it. I replaced the Cheddar Cheese with a whole pound of Velveeta.  I was asked to double this recipe for Christmas - I will.  There were no leftovers.

This was okay. i think it has potential but made as written, it was a lil off. The bread crumb topping is very pastey and is not sprinkle-able. once it baked it stayed clumpy. I think the butter should be drizzled on the cauliflower,  instead of mixed into the bread crumbs. i will make this again but play with it a lil.

I followed the recipe as-is, and the only exception was I had to mix italian seasoning with my plain bread crumbs.  I thought this was slightly bland, and possibly too many bread crumbs.  I may try this again with actual Italian seasoned bread crumbs to see if I possibly didn't season them enough.  Kind of a dissapointment.

Quite tasty...  being in Romania, I had to make some substitutions (gosh I miss cheddar cheese)...  and as others mentioned, I didn't mix the butter & breadcrumb mixture.  I tossed it together, first added the butter, then breadcrumbs using less than 2/3 c of breadcrumbs.

i made this as written and we just did not care for it so much. it was kind of dry, had an off-texture and flavor that didn't do it for me. maybe i just prefer creamy-cheesy when it comes to cauliflower, and this wasn't either of those things. thanks anyway :)

It was okay.  I read the reviews and followed the instructions as listed by VICSGARDEN.  The only difference that I made was I added asiago and parmagiano-reggiano cheese in addition to mild cheddar.  I would eat it again, but I'm in no great hurry to make it again.

After making a few of my own "healthier" changes, this gets 5 stars from me!! I have been trying to eat healthy so every recipe I give an overhaul. On this dish I used margerine instead of butter (next time I am going to try using a broth), whole wheat breadcrumbs and garlic salt and reduced fat cheeses and lessened the amount. Unlike some other reviewers I made a thin layer of the cauliflower and cheeses then poured the margerine and breadcrumbs on that. I use less ingredients and it gurantees a nice crispy crunch in each bite. Will definetley be making again! Thanks!

This was a good dish. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding no bread crumbs. and instead of red pepper flakes I used some creole seasoning. I also added a packet of Goya Sazon, I just love that stuff! I did use the suggestion of another review that said to add any additional cheeses on hand and used some American cheese on top of the cauliflower before baking. 
Next time I make it I will use the bread crumbs and maybe some broccoli for some color.

I have been making this since last year when I found it.  I give it 5 stars because it gets wonderful reviews from my guests!  There are never any left overs...so tonight when I make it I am making a big pot of it!  I like all of the suggestions, I have never had any issues with it; but like the idea of more red pepper and different cheeses.  Really really good!

Bored with the usually vegetables... I tried this cauliflower recipe. Based on the reviews and what I just ate. Even my husband who isn't into new vegs liked it. Parboiling the califlower is a great idea. 
Hubby liked the red pepper kick in what is typically a bland veggie. The cheese helped too.
I made this modification to reduce carbs and butter fat. Used crumbled soy chips, typically 8 or 9 carbs in one 1 cup. Reducing the fat will be better next time. I panicked when I saw that the consistency was off and added 1/4c of water. Too much separation. Might try 1 tbsp flour base for the butter. 
I know I'll do this again because even with all my mods, it was very edible!

I really don't like Cauliflower much, but it was on sale, so I figured I could find a recipe here... THIS RECIPE ROCKS!  OHMIGOD, I could have eaten the whole thing myself! It's so easy!  No need to wait for a special occasion. Put some extra cheese ontop tho'.

I only used 2 tablespoons of butter(unsalted). I also have my red pepper in a grinder-I only turned it once and just used that(a little more than a pinch)I added some of the cheedar cheese to the Cauliflower after I boiled it-while it was still super hot and than put it in the casserole dish and made as directed from there. It was soooo good! I'm always looking for hearty comfort foods for fall and winter-Instant top 5!

I made it as written and was not impressed.  A bit greasy, too many bread crumbs, flavor passable but I wouldn't go back for 2nds.

It came out really good and I am not someone that really likes cauliflower.  I especially liked that the red pepper flakes gave it an extra kick.  My boyfriend and I ended up eathing the whole pan.

I forgot to rate this one and I came across it while looking for something to use up my broccoli with. Anyway-this was delicious! My boyfriend and I couldn't get enough of it. I scaled it down a bit but wish I hadn't because the next day we had to split one serving. We like things spicy so I just shook a bunch of red pepper flakes in, and wow! I think I went a little overboard, but I tend to do that with spices I like...oops! All in all it's a great recipe. I think I'll make it tonight as I think back of how yummy it was. A must try!

Loved this. I used a combination of Smart Balance and butter, and I omitted the pepper flakes as I was making it just for me and I'm a pepper wimp. I would agree that it's a little on the dry side, but the flavor was great. Thanks, Betty!

This recipe is delicious and easy! I cut back a little on the crushed red pepper flakes, but other than that I followed the recipe as written. Both my husband and I really enjoyed it! I will definitely make this again!

This was pretty good, I used a broccoflower and steamed it to keep the nutrients. The bread crumb topping was very tasty but very dry. I mixed it all together instead of just sprinkling on top. The pepper flakes added a nice little zing, but I didn't use the full amount. Definitely a nice change for culiflower instead of just steaming it.

I was making this one night for dinner, my husband saw I was making cauliflower.  He said, I won't be having any.  I said, ok and continued to make it.  I put it on his plate when dinner time came, he ate it all!  And then went back for seconds!  Loved it!

This is a simple enough recipe and can be made rather fast!  My family will eat cauliflower if I do make it into a casserole and this works for us.  It's not cheap in calories, but it is tasty for a once in awhile side dish.

Everyone loved this recipe! I did as others suggested and lightened up on the bread crumbs a bit. Next time, though, I would just mix in the bread crumbs and cheese before baking. I thought it would all kind of "seep" in and it just kind of crusted on top.

My family enjoyed this dish. I did modify by adding in about half a cup of spicy cheese dip with the crumbs and also mixed in extra Tabasco sauce with the butter. I sprinked the top with paprika and it was very nice. Next time I may add all the ingredients but the crumbs and shredded cheese together and pour over cauliflower and add the crumbs and cheddar cheese on top.

I made this recipe using fresh cauliflower, and although I wasn't sure how this would turn out with such few ingredients, I was pleasantly surprised. Easy to prepare, and was baked nicely. I didn't over butter, and dotted the top with cheese, but the bread crumbs added a nice crunch.

This recipe was ok, my husband said it was fine.  I thought it was a little blah, I might try it again though and kick it up with a little creole spice mixed with the bread crumbs, also will mix up a little cheese sauce to pour on the cauliflower and then add the crumb topping.  I just did not like the cheese on top as it was just there.

Added Broccoli like suggested, turned out pretty good. Was a little dry, but I did not get a chance to sample it till a few hours after it was cooked (potluck). Did not have a problem with butter pooling at the bottom.

Great, easy side dish!!  We loved it.  We added more parmesan and red pepper flakes and kept it covered during baking -- perfect balance between crisp and moist!!

This was a tsty side dish. I did use a 16 oz. bag of frozen florets. I kept the crumb mixture the same though, and it was a bit much. Probably because I didn't use a whole head of fresh, I think the amounts would be fine for that. I also didn't measure the cheese just heaped it on there. I only put it in the oven long enough to melt the cheese. Overall a simple yet tasty dish that I think almost anyone would enjoy. Will definately be making again.

This went down very well, certainly amore interesting way of cooking cauliflour, particularly with combination of textures. I think this is going to be regular in our house.

Yummy!  I love the spiciness, but with little kids, you probably want to skip the red pepper flakes.

I didn't care for this.  I think it might have been the bread crumbs.  I didn't think it complimented the cauliflower.  I guess I'm just a plain ol' cauliflower and cheese sauce kinda gal.  I wouldn't try this one again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  I usually don't write a review but I had to for this one.  Even if you don't like cauliflower you will like this.  It was nice to have a different side dish recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed every morsel.  I plan to make this when my in-laws come to visit at Thanksgiving. Yummy!

This recipe was so good it inspired by first review! I cut the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon for the perfect amount of heat for us. We loved it ... definately my new favorite way to serve cauliflower!

Excellent recipe!  I left out the parmesan and it was still delicious.  The whole family loved it and usually I have to battle with my kids to eat their vegetables but they ate this right up. No leftovers!

This was very good. We prefer just the plain old cheese sauce better. But this would make a nice pot luck dish. I used frozen cauliflower and it turned out perfect. It was so easy to put together.

I thought this was so-so - my partner enjoyed it.  If I were going to make it again I would leave out the cheese - mine kind of just globbed together (I'm thinking maybe it wasn't fresh enough).  The breading was delicious and I followed other reviewers suggestions and used a lesser amount of breadcrumbs.  Thanks submitter.

This was excellent and I'll make it again.  Surprisingly, when I made it, there was absolutely none left!  Next time I might try mixing the cauliflower with some broccoli and carrots.

This recipe tastes great but my family found it to be dry.  I would like to find an ingredient to moisten it without compromising the taste.

I thought this was a good recipe since I am not a big fan of cauliflower.  I think I might add less butter next time as the topping was a little mushy.  I will also omit the salt.  Cooking the cauliflower in the microwave is an easier way than cooking in water.

This was a delicious recipe!  I had some of my dinner guests try it that don't normally like cauliflower and they asked for the recipe.

Well, once again, a vegetable recipe that I enjoyed, but my husband wouldn't touch. My advice: if your people won't eat cauliflower prepared this way, just give up, there is no hope. I didn't have any problems with the recipe, although I would say that if you're not big on heat, to go easy on the red pepper flakes, it was pretty spicy. Thanks Betty.

We thought this was good and did not have the problem of butter pooled on the bottom of the dish like other reviewers did.  I am going to omit the salt next time and maybe use a different cheese.  It didn't melt well and kind of dried to the top of the casserole.

Flavor is good - but it came out dry.  Hubby thought it was some kind of potato dish and was surprised to find out it was cauliflower - he doesn't like cauliflower - but he said this casserole was good!  He's even taking some for lunch tomorrow.....that says alot!  I'll look thru some other reviews for some ideas before I make it again.
