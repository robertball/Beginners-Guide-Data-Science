Flavors are awesome.  I tried with green beans but I didn't like it.  Substituted for some brocolli and halved brussel sprouts and it was fantastic.

Outstanding recipe.  I didn't have any mushrooms, red pepper, or the apricots.  I added sliced carrots instead.  It truly is the ginger that makes this such a flavorful delight!

Didn't have ginger or apricots so substituted the sesame oil/soy sauce for TJ's pineapple teriyaki sauce- super easy and yummy! Excellent side dish for Japanese grilled chicken over brown rice. I loved how fast it brought my meal together.

Excellent recipe!  This is one of the best stir-fry meals I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly, except for decreasing the canola oil to 1/2 tablespoon and using a full 8 oz. pkg. of mushrooms.  I love the straightforward instructions.  I chopped everything up and had it ready to add, so I just followed the directions and set a timer so I wouldn't overcook the veggies each time I made an addition.  The apricots and the toasted sesame seeds really made it special.  Can't wait to make it again!

Yummy! I used olive oil instead of canola oil.  Next time I want to cut-out the oil and saute the beans in water to start.  I also added sliced water chestnuts & sugar snap peas.  I didn't have sesame oil or apricots, but it still tasted great.  My husband went back for seconds and thirds!!

This green bean dish was a pleasant surprise. I enjoy plain green beans, but the addition of the other items makes the common green bean a special centerpiece. I substituted yellow bell pepper and raisins for the red bell pepper and apricots, adding a bit more soy sauce and ginger, supplemented with a dash of lime juice and red wine vinegar. This side dish went well with vegetarian chicken patties. I will make this one again!

This was really good.  I love the flavor of sesame, so I was excited to try the dish.  I didn't have the apricots so I left those out and I added some carrots and Chinese snow peas.  I also added just a tiny bit of hoisin sauce at the end, because I like that flavor. Overall, it was easy to make and really good. The vegetables all came out cooked but not at all mushy -- perfect!

Delicious!  We loved the flavor the dried apricots added.  Served alongside egg rolls & sushi rice.

I loved this recipe! I don't really like mushrooms or apricots so I left those out. But I used fresh ginger and garlic and it was very tasty! We ate it with chicken fried rice yum.
