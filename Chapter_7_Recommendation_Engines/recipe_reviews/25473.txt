I was somewhat hesitant to try this recipe after seeing that it had only 3.5 stars (I know, 3.5 - I don't like wasting food). However, I tried it, as I wanted a plain burger that I could top with ketchup, mustard, onions, and pickles - in other words traditional toppings. I'm not one for fish burgers or anything gourmand-like like that. 

To the user that said that this burger was tasteless, I would say that the burger would be tasteless by itself and with no condiments. However, I added a slice of cheese (let it melt a bit under the burger patty), pickles, ketchup, mustard, a couple slices of onions, and wow. It was great. Let me just say that I won't be going to Burger King for a while. This burger tasted great - it tasted so juicy and meaty! I had one for lunch and one for dinner. Deelish.

This is exactly as stated "a perfect basic burger".  It's simple and if you look at the ingredients the flavor will come from the beef you use, so use a good grade of beef.  It also holds the burger together well on the grill.  It's almost like what McDonald's uses. This is the perfect base to add some really great condiments.  I used cheese, pickles, finely chopped onion, lettuce, tomato and "Best Burger Sauce" from this site. I normally don't do that with other burger recipes from this site because they stand on their own due to the amount of seasonings, spices and other additions.  Those call for just lettuce, tomato and bun.  You don't want to ruin the flavor with a bunch of condiments. If you're looking for a lot of spice this isn't for you.  If you want to experiment with some different toppings or condiments this is the burger to try it on!

This is a BASIC recipe, very few ingredients so what would you expect? A lot of the taste will come from the ground beef you are using, low grade ground beef will yield a pretty much bland tasting burger.  You should always use a good ground beef for plain hamburgers, use good, you get good.  Simple.  These are great tasting.

This is just that the perfect basic burger, nothing fancy and really a rather plain taste.  However, if you are planning on dressing it up with toppings it is the way to go as your hamburger patty will not compete with the toppings.

Simple, traditional, and good for the masses because it's versatile.  I served them at a casual cook-out of family and friends. If you are looking for a non-traditional, gourmet burger then this recipe is not for you. I made as directed. Those guests that wanted cheese added cheese, those that wanted onion added onion, etc. Just like it reads, this was the perfect basic burger.

It was the description that made me want to make these! Since the weather was so nice - I decided to barbecue. A simple recipe but I added some fresh spinach leaves and cheese which dressed it up.

Tasteless.  Just add your favorite seasonings to the meat and a little liquid smoke for the perfect burger.

Basic burger is right.  If you want something else then don't make them this way!  These are great just the way they are.  It's the veggies and condiments that flavor the meat.....

Are you kidding me? A perfect BASIC burger, just like Lindsay says. It leaves it wide open to add whatever your heart's content calls for. Far easier to add to a recipe than take away. I think some people just don't understand basic. Thanks Lindsay, a real keeper, something I can dress up if I want, or enjoy as is, with my favourite condiments & some cheese.

Nothing more than meatloaf on a bun. IF I want meatloaf I'll make it. Ok, for individual servings. They do hold together fairly well on a grill, but not really a hamburger.

Sorry I agree with the meatloaf comments.  I find the perfect basic hambuger is 80/20 ground beef, broiled steak seasoning, minimally handled/shaped and grilled over charcoal. Top with fixings of your choice on a fresh/toasted bun. Perfect and Basic yum.

Gave it a try and was very disappointed.  Not juicy and due to the breadcrumbs it had a texture closer to a processed chicken patty.  Sorry, not a hit with our family.

I loved this recipe.  Instead of bread crumbs, I used one slice of bread soaked in 2 TBS. of milk. I also added 1 tsp. of grilled hamburger seasoning to the mixture.  I grilled them on a George Foreman grill for a total of 6 minutes.  They were very moist and tasty. I will make this again.

Definitely the perfect basic burger!  I used Panko brand bread crumbs, and none of my guests could tell that there were any in this recipe.  Even my picky DD ate her entire burger without prodding for a change.  Great recipe!  Ignore the poor reviews. :-)  Thank you for sharing!

Great basic burger. I have a very picky husband and he likes to taste the burger and not the added stuff. Works great for him and my kids. Topped with bacon, cheese and lettuce for the perfect bacon burger!

Plain ground beef burgers DEPEND on using quality beef. That means not super lean, and not super fatty, and not so old that it's turning colors (even safe colors.) If you have good, fresh beef, this is a great recipe to use. If you have cheap beef, low-fat beef, beef mixed with turkey or chicken, or old beef, then you're best off using a flavorful recipe that will mask those things. Many chefs suggest not using any seasoning other than salt and pepper--not even eggs or bread crumbs! Why people would vote this one down for being, essentially, "too basic", is beyond me--it's the very first burger recipe most people learn to use!

This worked out really well! I had some spicy breadcrumbs and used those in place of regular bread crumbs with some slices of jalapeno cheddar. SO GOOD!!! Will totally make these a million times this summer.

This burger was perfect for me, who slathers my burgers with the works, and with some garlic and onion powder thrown on while cooking, perfect for my husband who merely eats his burgers with cheese and ketchup! Also, we made it on the stovetop. Love it! This will be our regular recipe from now on!

Loved these!  Actually tasted like a regular burger and not meatloaf or salisbury steak.  Wanted a plain burger for our cookout Memorial Day.  Served with the light and fluffy buns on this site.  Only thing I did different was on 2 of the burger patties I added jalapeno powder to spice them up.  Like it both ways.  Great recipe!

Fantastic! Exactly what I was looking for. It did not taste like my meatloaf or meatballs at all (I make sure they are all distinctive). This burger was perfectly seasoned, and complimented all of my toppings (I'm a traditional ketchup, mustard, onions; my husband prefers BBQ sauce and onions)
I'm so glad I came upon this recipe. Please note: this recipe is what it says; "basic burger".

I think I would call this a "meatloaf burger". If I try it again I'll add some chopped onion and serve it on sliced bread, no cheese, with a little ketchup/cocktail sauce.

This is how my mom made burgers 40 years ago, long before the advent of tossing in exotic (and sometimes disgusting) international ingredients with the ground meat. It's the way I make burgers. 

The burger is meant to be a blank slate and all the rest of the weird, trendy stuff people eat now is reserved for topping it. I have a refrigerator full of condiments and cheeses family and friends can choose from for burger toppings (you'd be surprised at the wide, eclectic selection and varying heat levels), but none of these will ever be mixed in with the burger meat itself. Obviously this must work because I haven't gotten any complaints yet, and I've been making burgers this way since high school.

It's a great recipe if you've got good beef - or even if you mince your own - why add all sorts of other flavours when the beef will shine through? It's also a useful guide to proportions if you want a burger with other seasonings.

according to the title it`s just basic buger, which means that U can add what ever u like . if U r sure that the quality and the flavor of ur ground beef is high so U don`t have to add any thing. for me I add 1 small chopped onion , garlic powder and season salt but I add just 1/4 cup of bread crumbs .

I guess some people didn't read the whole title :-) This was exactly as described. If you wanted the 'perfect sweet burger, or smoke burger, or your personal tastes burger' Then you really should have been tipped off when you read the ingredients that this was as stated 'Basic'. Add what you want, but don't complain that something was exactly what it said it was. Now for the review /rant off. This was tasty, I had my butcher freshly grind the beef for me. The flavour was uncomplicated and worked great for all the guests we had. I set out a variety of traditional and more exotic burger toppings (wasabi mayo alongside ketchup lol). I for one, really prefer to add individual flavour this way instead of in the meat where people can have wildly differing tastes and likes/dislikes and you can't change it after its cooked. Thank you for the post, its in my recipe box :-)

To the folks who say this recipe is "bland", "tasteless" or other such comments...  This is a "basic" burger.  Some of us have (bachelors) never quite been able to get burgers to the right consistancy and such even BEFORE adding other stuff to it (myself included).  If you're looking for something "no frills" that you can experiment with and dress up (either with condiments or extra ingredients), this is what you need!

This recipe with an egg and bread crumbs should be called a meatloaf burger. I like meatloaf, but when I am looking for a tender juicy burger, i don't want fillers in it.

I love this recipe. I really enjoyed it because it was so basic that everyone could add anything they wanted to their own burger. I did not have propane for my grill and I felt kinda lazy, so I added another egg in the mix and pan fried them. Will be using this recipe again.

I have used a similar recipe for burgers, but I add a couple tablespoons of dehydrated onions, season all salt, and instead of bread crumbs I use rice Crispy Cereal.  When I make these burgers, there isn't a single one left.  Whether you are an onion lover or not, you will sure to enjoy these.  Try it you might like it, my son who deplores onions just gobbles them up.

Save the breadcrumbs for your meatloaf. I'm sure this is great if meatloaf burger is what your going for. Myself I just add Worcestershire and liquid smoke (salt & Pepper of course) or sometimes some onion soup mix if I want to get fancy. 

I'm already eating enough bread in the bun without adding it to the inside of the burger as well. JMO

You have to be very careful not to blend the mixture more than you need to.   Just gently fold the seasonings into the meat. Gently form the patties.  Don't squish them between your hands.   You want to preserve the spaces between the bits of ground meat because that is where the juice ends up.  If you mix the meat into a smooth homogeneous mass, the juice will run out into the fire.

Great basic burger. I've done two tricks in addition to this recipe. I've added 1/4 cup of water to plain ground beef which helps with the dryness and omits the bread crumb/egg and have also asked the meat guy at the market to grind chuck for me. GOOD quality beef is what makes this recipe a winner along with NOT overmixing/
overhandling. I've also asked the meat guy to grind flap meat ONCE, added 2 Tablespoons of melted butter and formed patties that way. All good. Thanks for the recipe. Not all of us like "gourmet" for a quick meal.

Just made this for dinner, I made a whole pound thinking I could eat a half pound burger, but now I have to GLADLY save the other half for tomorrow! I also made another one for my friend who eats a bit more than me, and he gobbled down his burger!

Tip! When making this stir in the bread crumbs last, I made the mistake of mixing them in prior to mixing the meat, and it was too thick (but I also live in a dry climate, so if that happens to you, add a little water after mixing in the meat, like a teaspoon, and that should fix everything)! 

Great recipe! :D

This recipe makes a pretty good burger. It does a nice job of holding together the meat during cooking to make a plump patty that tastes more like a restaurant burger, than homemade. I will definitely be using this one over and over!

this burger is great... very versatile, i wanted a basic recipe so i could do some sprucing up of my own and they came out great... if you think that they are bland then add you favorite seasonings. Everythings better with a little personalization.

Jus average! Kind of had a bit of an  from the bread crumbs. If I made it again I would delete the bread crumbs. They were just okay. Not awful, but not "wow" either.

I can't believe something SOOO basic & boring could make the "daily recipe". I'll stick to my tried and true 3 ingredients - ground beef, dried onion soup and an egg to bind.

Ingrediant wise this recipe is great! I had all of the ingrediants with me already and it was easy to prep! No slicing or chopping, just mixing! I read all the other reviews and decided to mix some pepper flakes and a little bit of garlic powder into the mix. I am planning on putting cheese inside the burgers next time. They were GREAT!

I have always made my burgers this way, and they are not tasteless because I top with cheese, avocado slices and a slice of fried ham and sometimes a slice of jalapeno and add to the toasted bun... Obviously your burger will taste like nothing if you just slap it on the bun without great toppings....

Pretty respectable burger. I think I’ll add a little onion powder next time to add a little more depth to the flavor. It was definitely a good burger, though.

This is an excellent starting point for a burger you can really make your own. Use only the egg yolk, and it will hold together with add ins (diced jalapenos and shredded cheese for me). Some people are puritans about making a burger with only beef, but these always come out tender and tasty, while the pure beef ones shrink like crazy and are often plain and dont hold together if you like to add things. I also add a bit of worchestershire to the mix.

This recipe is properly named as it was the perfect basic burger. Easy to throw together because of the basic pantry ingredients. I did not find the burger bland but as others have mentioned you can build your flavor with condiments etc. I plated the burgers and set out a mini burger bar of condiments and add ons such as lettuce, pickle tomato, onion and spicy ketchup. Everyone gets to build their own burger. Even though I’ve been cooking burgers for years my husband was wowed by this burger. I will use this recipe going forward for burger nights. I did cook it stove top due to inclement weather.

I made this Perfect Basic Burger recipe for my 14 year old son and he loved it!  The burger had excellent flavor!  I did add a sprinkling of garlic salt and freshly ground pepper on the top of the burgers while it was cooking.  My son likes cheese on his burgers so I also added a slice of Sharp Cheddar Cheese.  I loved the simplicity of this recipe and the fact that I had all the ingredients at home.  Will definitely make this recipe again :).

Was looking for a quick, easy, last-minute burger when I ran out of pre-made ones and this recipe fit the bill perfectly!  I just needed the basics and only added some additional spices (because what is cooking if you don't) and these turned out fantastically.  A lot better than many other recipes I've tried.  They were moist, held together well while cooking, and the flavouring was great.

EZ simple ingredients. I also add in garlic powder, onion powder, parsley, and a bit of cayenne. 

I'm going to try the dimple technique this time to help prevent shrinkage (shape it like a doughnut without poking a hole in the middle).

I cook mine on a convection cooktop with a tad of coconut oil at 250F for 6 minutes each side. Use a metal spatula to get a clean quick flip on the stainless steel. Melt some cheese on them towards the end or melt the cheese in the  pan own its own. Let'em rest a bit and they come out nice and juicy.

This is my third time with this recipe.

I put half of an egg instead of 1. I added spicy red pepper since i love spicy food. It is better if you mix the ingredients and put it to the fridge for a couple of hours before cooking. Thanks for the recipe.

Made it for 2 servings by using only 200g of ground beef and keeping all the other ingredients at the instructed amount. Topped it with some melted cheese and it tastes great!!

This is fine, but please be aware that putting bread crumbs and eggs in your burgers will not be good for a lot of people:  those with gluten sensitivity, wheat allergy, possibly soy allergy (many breads have soy) and egg allergy.   If it's just for your family, great, but if it's for others, NOT GREAT.   Stick with meat-only or list the ingredients (for the buns too) with warnings for the guests.   Thanks from all of us with allergies!

My mom loves the old fashioned burgers where you can really taste the meat. This was perfect for her. She added her cheese, mustard, pickles, lettuce, tomatoes, onions and toasted bun and she was asking for another. Thank you for this simple recipe.

My husband made these for my Mom and I for Mother’s Day and they were delicious!   He baked them at 425 in the oven rather than bbqing them.  The only suggestion I have is to make the patties very flat as they ‘shrink and rise’ a lot during cooking.

These burgers are amazing!  I only added a few shakes of montreal steak seasoning, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This is now my go to burger recipe.

I thought this recipe was ON POINT. A simple burger that doesn't take away from your toppings. My kids felt it was "weird" so maybe ill experiment with some seasonings to cater to their odd taste buds. I reheated it the next day and it tasted even better. Thank you.

FINALLY, this is the one! I have been trying different recipes for years to make the perfect burger patty, I used most the bells and whistles out there, non of it was even close to being right, but this simple little recipe was just perfect. This is the taste I have been looking for. 
Ps: I used 1/2 tsp of pepper and 1 tsp salt.
Thank you

This is a great, easy recipe that makes tender, juicy burgers. The only change I made was to add 2 tsp of A1 steak sauce for a little extra flavor after mixing all the ingredients to grass-fed angus beef. Those who complained that the burgers tasted bland might have bought cheap meat or didn't cook them correctly. Making thin patties and then melting cheese on top with sauteed mushrooms is my favorite way to have burgers at home.

This was such a great easy recipe. My 12 year old wanted to make burgers for supper so I was looking for a straight forward recipe for her to follow. The only change we made was the addition of some garlic powder. Next time we will make 6 burgers rather than 4 as they were pretty big for us.

Excellent base burger. I added a few extra seasonings to give it the flavour I wanted, but by keeping what was in it basic, it held together well on the BBQ. I personally used seasoning salt instead of regular salt and added 1/2 tsp of onion and garlic powders. Yum!

Yes, it can use tweaks, but it *is* listed as the perfect BASIC burger....and for that, it is just as the title exclaimed. I used a few spices and some finely diced onion, followed the rest of the recipe down to the letter. They came out firm, juicy and, well...perfect :)

Burgers came out perfectly; didn't change a thing. Rainy Fourth of July, so I pan fried these on medium heat in a cast iron skillet. My two year old tore it up! Thanks sugar for the recipe.

Super simple and super tasty. 
I ran out of breadcrumbs so used panko instead which I think helped hold the patties together better. 
Dividing 500g into 4 gave me very thick patties. Perfect for a man sized burger.

I thought I was going to have a real mess on my hands until I added the bread crumbs at the end.   It seemed like a lot when I read it, but it worked out perfectly, the patties shaped up easily and the burgers cooked up deliciously.

My family prefers a simple but tasty burger, and this hits the spot every time. I add a little worcestershire sauce and garlic powder and it gives it a little more flavor, but not enough to confuse or overstimulate your mouth like other burger recipes. This recipe works best with real beef, not Walmart , and is perfect for those that appreciate the natural flavor of good meat in a burger. If you're looking for a quick, easy and tasty burger recipe, this is a great pick- I make it once a week and know it by heart now :) thanks for sharing!

Just made this burger the only thing I tweaked was I added garlic powder to it.  And my girls said it was the best burger they ever eaten.  Lol it was good and simple to make.

I thought it was tasty! No frills, but came out quite nice.  I bought a 1.5 # ground beef that was 80-20 lean to fat. Added a tiny bit more of everything and used panko as that was what I had on hand, and a sprinkle of Chinese five spice and cumin powder. Served it with buttered Hawaiian bread, avocados, fried egg  and it was good! Will make again soon

Great basic burger recipe with ingredients you probably have. I added 1/2 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of worstershire and they were great. My family likes simple flavors and they loved these burgers!

This is the Perfect Burger I never could get it right now I can I cooked it on the stovetop can't wait to try it on the grill. Add your condiments and whatever else you like on top and its more then Perfect. If you are looking for a gourmet one look somewhere else.

This was simple but delicious!  I added a tsp of Worcester Sauce but will likely add 1 1/2 tsp. next time to add a little zing.  Yum!

Great, BASIC recipe.  This recipe doesn't claim to be gourmet, it claims to be BASIC.  I was looking for a plain burger that is not complicated or that doesn't have a million ingredients.  We like our burgers with lettuce, tomato, ketchup and mustard and those toppings just don't work when you are making gourmet patties.  We LOVED this.  It will be my go to burger.  The burgers stuck together REALLY nicely, easy to make.  Hands down, this recipe is exactly as claimed in the title.

These burgers were absolutely perfect. The amount show isn't exact unless you want to make really big and thick burgers. I have a uncle who cooks at restaurants and he finds these burgers to be better than his!

I doubled the recipe and added one onion, a tsp of Lea & Perrins Worcester sauce, and a dash or two of hot sauce. They were simple but tasty and very juicy. Great for a cook-out where you want to please everyone!

This recipe yielded a very moist great tasting burger.  I agree it does matter what grade hamburger you use. I added a tsp of Essence of Emeril.  The results were a great tasting grilled burger.

This recipe gives the hamburger no added flavor.  To be the *best* basic burger, it needs something special.  Try breaking up 2 slices of bread into very small pieces and using that with half the bread crumbs.  That makes them very moist and it's still a basic burger!  And add a little spice to it!

Wonderful...I love meatloaf sandwiches and I make them from leftover meatloaf. This burger tasted wonderful and everyone was able (as stated) to add what they wanted. We all loved it and will use it again. Thank you so much..

It really is the perfect basic burger recipe! I add a little dry minced onion and garlic for an extra kick.

This is the perfect starting place to create your own burger. My 11 year old whom is beyond picky ate 2! My wife and I spiced ours up but this is the perfect springboard to add your own. I would recommend this recipe.
