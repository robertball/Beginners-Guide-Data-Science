MY OH MY!!!!! (as the late great Dave Niehaus would say) This is amazing! I followed this recipe but had to skip some of the hot peppers due to a lack of tolerance for "hot stuff". Two of the most notable components were the Mascarpone and the Garlic Basil Spread. They take this sandwich from very good to GREAT! Two other must have components.....a fork and knife. This thing is messy good and you'll want to get every bite. This puppy is headed for my super bowl menu. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

This is a really rich sandwich, that requires a lot of napkins. One of my kids favorites from this guys videos. He is so animated when he talks about his recipes.

This sandwich has great flavor and is VERY filling.  I didn't use hot chilies, and don't know what mascarpone cheese is, so I didn't use it.  I used provolone cheese and it turned out nicely.  We ended up eating with a knife and fork - I really piled the ingredients high.  I used a marinara sauce recipe from this site and the flavors and textures blended well.  Make sure your roll is big enough to take all the ingredients.  I used French bread and ended up having to wait to get the sandwiches out of the oven to add the marinara to it because the bread wasn't thick enough.  One negative is that it takes a little work to make them.  It's worth the effort.  Thanks for sharing.

So delicious, and so messy! But that's what I get for over stuffing my sandwich ;)

We gave up pretty early and used knives and forks on these sandwiches. They're just too messy and full to pick up and eat. But however you gotta do it, make and eat these because they are SPECTACULAR. The mascarpone and the garlic spread MAKE this sandwich. You could play around with the meats and cheeses, but don't mess with the spreads.

These are pretty good.  I thought the marinara overpowered the rest of the ingredients though.  I shall use less of that next time.

Killer sandwich for football playoffs today. Followed recipe except that I used basil garlic pesto that I had in the fridge rather than the garlic spread.  Very filling but everyone loved them :)

These were a bit of work, but worth it.  I used ciabatta rolls cuz they were on sale.  Excellent for lunch, or make lots for a gathering.
