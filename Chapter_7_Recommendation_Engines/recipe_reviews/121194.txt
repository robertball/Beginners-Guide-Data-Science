These were yummy cookies. Not sure if there was an altitude situation or I just used too much liquid, but the first bunch of cookies were flat as pancakes (still soft though). So I added extra flour to stiffen up the batter, and they were puffy and wonderful. Nice use of extra buttermilk.

I added about 1/2-3/4 cups more flour and put the dough in the refridgerator between baking batches.  This recipe reminded me of the orange cookies my mom used to make when I was young.  I also added a little grated orange peel to the frosting as well.  Pretty good cookie if you like soft cookies.

These cookies did not have much flavor and they came out looking like pancakes. I even added more flour and sugar to make them stiffer but it was not helpful. The frosting was too thick and too much sugar. I would not recommend this cookie.
