I agree with the other reviewer and there needs to be more breading. I DID use a whole pound and think it needs tripled. Other than that, this is perfect for a healthier alternative.

Being home as part of the Covid 19 shutdown, I made this during the week and found it to be quite good. I didn't have Italian bread crumbs so I used Garlic and Herb instead and it turned out to be just fine. If we are still at home in a couple of weeks, I'll make this again.....

Very tasty!! Due to dietary restrictions I made it with nut and oat bran “crumbs”, coconut milk, vegan butter and fresh parsley instead of dill, well, because fresh! Served with quinoa seasoned with salt, pepper and parsley and blanched asparagus.

It was simple to do. I adjusted tastes of seasoning .... I had to use more of each. It is delicious!! We will definitely use this recipe again.

Very delicious! If you make sure to spray or drizzle butter on it before cooking, it wont be dry!

Very tasty.  Made as recipe is written but next time I will use very little or no butter and bake on a foil lined sheet pan.  The butter prevented the breading from crisping up... still very tasty.

Like others, I double the batter. And used a little less butter. We loved it. Wonderful recipe.

I used this recipe to make Swai. Instead of butter, I used I Can't Believe it's Not Butter to spray over the top of the fish, and used Almond Milk instead of regular milk. My fish was crispy and delicious.

This was good and easy.   I doubled the breading or I don't think there would have been enough for that amount of fish and I had less than 1 pound.  Will be making this one again.
