Great Recipe:
I did make a few changes, I increased the caesar dressing to 3/4 cup.  After the pasta was cooked, and still warm, I tossed it with 1/4 cup dressing and let it cool in the refrigerator tossing it occasionally.  The pasta absorbed the dressing as it was cooling. I also added 1/4 cup Shredded parmesan Cheese.  Before serving I tossed the broccoli, pepperoni, cheese and dressing with the pasta and sprinked Italian Seasoning on top as a garnish. It came out great, and I was told that I have to bring it to all of our other family functions.  Thanks for a simple, uniqe and tasty recipe.

I have made this salad twice.  Once with caesar dressing and once with ranch dressing.  Both were a big hit!!  Thanks for the recipe!!

My husband loves this and begs me to make it for him. I used the pasta I had on hand, which was bow-tie, shredded mozzarella cheese (since it's what we had), sliced pepperoni that I quartered, and bottled Caesar dressing. To say he LOVES it like that would be an understatement :-)

I used turkey pepperoni and Italian dressing instead of Caesar.  It had a lot of flavor and was quick to put together.

Made this twice over Memorial Day Weekend and took to different family gatherings.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  Super easy to make and great for making ahead and taking to get togethers.  Will make again even just for my own family to enjoy at home.   Just for a change at time of serving we halved cherry tomatoes and tossed in with salad.  A very nice compliment!

This worked out perfectly because I had some pepperoni and mozz. cheese leftover from making pizzas last weekend. I like to blanch the broccoli before putting in the salad (takes away some of the rawness), so I just added it to the boiling pasta for the last 2 minutes and drained and rinsed along with the pasta. I used Kraft Caesar Vinaigrette with Parmesan dressing, one of our favorites.

I was able to make this early this morning, before it got hot, and let it set in the fridge until dinner. I wanted to add a little more chopped vegetables for color, so I threw in one large chopped/cubed zucchini, some sliced red onion and some halved small cherub tomatoes. I used Newman's caesar dressing for this recipe. I tried a little and found it tasty. Next time, I'll use a mixture of mozzerella and parmesan cheese.

So good! I added extra caesar dressing as needed, especially after having it in the fridge overnight. I also added some olives which were a delicious addition. I will definitely make again, this is also great with Italian dressing or Ranch dressing.

Very simple but the Caesar gives it a nice kick. I like to use up any leftover veggies by throwing them in the mix. Cauliflower and carrots are nice additions for texture.

I increased the pasta to 2 cups, uncooked, and the dressing amount was still good.  This was ok.  I just don't think I like the cold-ish pepperoni.  A lot did get eaten at the event I brought it to.

This was pretty good! I have never had Caesar dressing and used a vinagrette with parm. cheese. I also only had a six cheese Italian blend of shredded cheese...so that's what I used. Yum! Will try it again and use Italian or Ranch like others have suggested. Thanks!

This pasta salad provided a nice combination of goodies amongst the pasta and it was not over dressed.  Great idea to combine the Caesar dressing with the flavors of the pepperoni and the mozzarella cheese, almost and anti-pasta, pasta salad.  :)

The taste was amazing! I would cut the cheese cubes way smaller than a dice.  The salad looked good and it tasted even better!

This seemed to simple to be 'really' good -but I had the ingredients on hand and needed a 'make the day before' side dish to the Hearty Italian Sandwiches (recipe found on this site).  Was not impressed with the flavor right after making it last night, but just pulled it out of the fridge and gave it another taste - it's FABULOUS and couldn't be any easier!  Would also be a nice base to toss in whatever you had as well (olives, onions, carrots, you name it!)  Thanks for the recipe - this ones a keeper!

Great recipe! Flavorful without being over powering, and so easy to make. My whole family love it, and it's going fast so I'm glad that I doubled it so that I can have some of the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. To make it a little healthier I used turkey pepperoni and light Caesar dressing. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Barbara, I will be making this again soon!

I made this for a picnic and it was a hit!  I used the pepperoni that comes in a stick though and quartered it.  I also used penne pasta.  It's a refreshing twist on a plain old pasta salad.

I was looking for a pasta salad that did not include Mayo and this was perfect.  I did make some changes.  I used thin sliced salami, celery, black olives, green peppers and tomatoes all chopped small. The Caesar dressing gave this a nice light flavor. A good recipe to use up all those left over veggies.

I absolutely love this recipe, and its so easy.  Get lots of compliments on it.  Suggestions:  Definitely blanch the broccoli for a few minutes, as another reviewers suggested.  Not too long, but soften it up a tad.  Also good with cubed pepperoni instead of the thin slices.  And make it the night before to let the dressing soak in.

Next time I'm going to try it with a mixture of parmesan and mozzarella cheese, as that sounds delicious, but its really great as is.  Perfect make-ahead dish.

Didn't really care for pepperoni & caesar together. I only made a half batch to try & ended up throwing it out because no one liked it. I feel I should add that we love pepperoni & we love caesar salads, but this combo did not work for us!

turned out really good.  I used Parmesan instead of mozzarella and added some halved grape tomatoes.  Next time I'd use both Parmesan and mozzarella.  It is necessary to make this at least a day in advance so the flavors can meld together.

I'm giving this recipe 3.5 stars...it was good, but after sitting in the fridge for a few hours, it was extremely dry. We did enjoy the combination of flavors, but had I known how dry it was gonna be, I would've made more dressing. I made the 'Caesar Salad Supreme' dressing from this site and it was wonderful in this, there just wasn't enough, and I added more than called for (maybe I was supposed to use more of a vinegarette-type caesar dressing and that was the issue???). I may try to play around w/ this more, b/c, like I said, it was good, just dry...Thanks for sharing. :)
