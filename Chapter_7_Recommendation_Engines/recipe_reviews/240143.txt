Was looking for a light bread stuffing recipe similar to my stuffing for chicken or turkey to serve with a pork loin roast. I kind of played with this recipe using white flour (no wheat flour), 1 apple instead of 2, and totally eliminated the sugar substitute as I really didn't want 'sweet'.  I added 1/2 cup chopped onion and 1 tsp of chicken bullion. Thanks jjsMA.. really appreciated your recipe.. even though I messed with it to suit my needs..
