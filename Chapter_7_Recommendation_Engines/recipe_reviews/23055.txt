WOW this was Great!  I thought this cake was better after it was in the fridge for several hours and it was heated it in the microwave for 20 seconds and served with a scoop of  ice cream! YUM!

This was a big hit with our family. We had it with cool whip on top. It made a delicious and moist Summer time treat. I have had all kinds of requests for the recipe.

The cake went together in a snap!  It's very dense and satisfying.  The cream cheese frosting was a perfect compliment.  Although, you could easily serve it as a coffee cake without the frosting!  It's delicious and not too sweet.

I did change this recipe a little but can't seem to understand why it got such great reviews.  It was very hard to cut into with a fork and lacked flavor.

This cake was delicious.  I made it with cream cheese frosting and it was a big hit for Father's Day. So easy too!  The pineapple that I used was 20 oz. so it was extremely moist.

This cake was very quick and easy to make!  It was good, but I think next time I will try the cream cheese frosting with it.  I did not have vanilla so I used coconut flavoring.  It worked out well.

My entire family loves this cake. My husband said he expects me to make this at least once a week (but that isn't going to happen). I also use the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe and lightly garnish with chopped pecans.

Very moist and dense! Only changes: I ran out of white sugar so I ended up with 1 cup white and 1 cup brown, I didn't have any pecans but I added about 1 cup shredded sweetened coconut, and like some of the other reviewers I ended up using a 20 oz can of crushed pinapple with juice which definitely added about 15 minutes to the cook time.  I also followed the advice of several reviewers and topped it with the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe on this website to which I added the zest and juice of one medium orange and saved back a little zest to sprinkle on top. Nice combination!

Great cake, and easy, too!  Frost with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site.  They complement each other nicely.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very moist- good with cream cheese frosting. I used a 20 oz. pineapple so I had to cook it a bit longer. I'll take out the nuts next time (too coffee-cake-ish), and maybe add a little almond extract. good cake.

Fantastic!!  This cake is very moist and tasty.  All the flavors are perfect together.  It didn't really need any icing but next time I'm going to try it on the cake.  It's a keeper in my recipe box.

Very moist, but very sweet.  I used a glaze instead of cream cheese frosting that was suggested.  When I make this again, I'm going to reduce the sugar & try 1c sugar & 1/2c brown sugar for a little more flavor without the sweetness. (hope it works)

This is a very easy cake to make.  Had a good taste but was a little heavy, and the cream cheese icing made it delicious.

I made this tonight for a dinner party.  I did take some of the comments into account and changed a few things.  First, I used a 20oz can of crushed pineapple.  Also, used 1C of sugar and 1C of brown sugar.  I added 1/4 ts of both cinnamon and nutmeg.  I beat the eggs first, added the vanilla then the pineapple before mixing into the dry ingredients.  I baked for 50 minutes.  Used the Cream Cheese Frosting II and sprinkled half with toasted coconut and half in pecan chips (not everyone likes coconut).  I left with many compliments and an empty dish.

my kids loved. 
 only did heaping cup of sugar, since used can pineapple in syrup (2 cups was sweet enough).  the cake was a bit too moist/soggy for me- better baked as muffins.

It’s very easy to make and tastes very good. It just needs something not sure what but maybe apple pie spice?  We frosted it with cool whip and instant vanilla pudding!!

This cake was so delicious . Moist and full of flavor.  Especially with the cream cheese frosting.  Yummy.  I can't for the life of me understand the comment that it was so tough she couldn't cut it with a fork??  Definitely did something wrong.  Very moist cake!!

Used brown sugar and added a cup of shredded coconut and a pinch of salt. Big hit!
Today I added a can of no sugar added cherry pie filling in addition to the pineapple and it excellent. I think I will cut the sugar (brown only) to 1 1/2 cups when adding the cherries as it was very rich and sweet.

This was a quick and very easy cake to make. I made it as the directions stated, but next time I will cut the sugar in half because it was a little sweet but it was delicious. I also made a cream cheese frosting to go on top which made it even better. Thanks for a great recipe.

I thought this was very easy to make and turned out moist and sweet, even without adding frosting.  I would prefer this to be in bundt form, wonder what the cooking time and temperature would be for that?

This was easy, easy and probably my favorite cake! I loved it just the way it is written, and I loved it adding 1/4 cup of shredded coconut. Everyone asks me to make it. I live in Albuquerque (high altitude) and did not need to make adjustments! I make a cream cheese frosting made with Cool Whip to top.

Cake was easy to make and tasted wonderful!!! I frosted the cake with a cream cheese frosting, family loved it-was all finished in one day.
