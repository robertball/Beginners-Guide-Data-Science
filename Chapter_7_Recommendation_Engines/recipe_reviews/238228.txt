This is like the Crisco recipe I saved 'years ago' off the can. It is terrific, and not one person mentioned that they served salmon patties with a cream gravy made with some of the Salmon juice from the can. This is really good.

Made as written and used red onion because that is what I had on hand. These were good and held their shape well but I guess I prefer crackers/breadcrumbs over the oats when it is all said and done. I sprinkled some Old Bay over the last one in the skillet and this added another depth in flavortown. Experiment a little until you find the cake that is perfect for you!

These were good, I found them a little dry but that could have been my substitution of of flaxseed meal and water for the egg. I will definitely make them again.

I cut this in half for 2. I used 2 pouches of lemon salmon from " Chicken of the Sea". Half Italian bread crumbs, half oatmeal. Probably 2 tbl. onion. Olive oil with butter to cook. Turned out very tasty. We very much enjoyed it.
