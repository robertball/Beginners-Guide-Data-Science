My husband LOVES this salad!  I have made it per recipe & have added several additions (depending on what is on hand) such as; jarred button mushrooms, broccoli, artichoke hearts, grape tomatoes, cucumber etc.  We like it best when it's loaded!  Thanks Heather!

Heart of palm seems so exotic and, well, sorta  weird, yet everyone at my table devoured them. They are so so good, and I served them with this dressing on a bed of boston lettuce. Delicious and so classy!

Good! I cut way back on the oil (I actually ended up mixing the dressing, using white wine vinegar, pretty much according to the package directions - and then didn't use nearly all of it). I added some chopped sundried tomatoes and fresh parsley. Thanks!

This recipe is great as written. I've subsequently made it w/ a few changes - I use all kalamata olives (I don't like canned black olives) and instead of using the dry dressing mix, olive oil, water & vinegar - I used a tasty champagne vinaigrette from trader joe's (just simpler & more cost effective - TJ also has a good price on the palm hearts) I use real bacon (not a fan of the 'bits'). Let the flavors blend overnight, but add the crumbled bacon just before serving so it stays crunchy. You can also toss this w/ some chopped mixed greens. Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! I made only one change, which was cutting back on the olive oil, otherwise I did add artichoke hearts and cucumbers to my salad. Great summer meal - everyone LOVED it!!

This tasted great, but I did reduce the amount of oil to 1/2 a cup. Next time I will reduce it again to 1/3 cup. Great recipe!

I found this to be a lovely salad, but I have to agree with everyone who stated there is too much dressing and too much oil.  I scaled the recipe down--I only had one jar of hearts of palm, and a smaller one at that--so I only used one packet of dressing and I followed the directions on the packet for less oil (1/4 c oil, 1/4 c water) but left out the water.  Even leaving out the water and with the addition of some tomatoes and a large cucumber to this salad, there is too much dressing.  The amount of oil was fine in the dressing itself, but I'd say half the amount of dressing would be fine and would still allow the flavors to meld.  I certainly like the salad and will probably make it again, but I'll definitely cut back on the dressing.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is basically hearts of palm and Italian dressing mixed together, not that that's a bad thing.  On the contrary, it's an extremely versatile recipe---throw in whatever veggies seem to fit.  The champagne vinegar (although at the high cost I subbed half with another type of vinegar) takes it to another level and adds that extra flavor factor.  I only used half the olive oil, and that was more than enough.

Excellent!  Husband says its a "keeper".  Cut the oil to 1/2.  Added extras - broccoli, grape tomatoes, and button mushrooms.  I omitted the bacon, but only because I forgot it.  You do need to chill for at least 4 hours or overnight in order to get all the flavors to meld.

What a pretty salad! While it lends itself well to adding any variety of ingredients, I loved the simplicity and creativity of this just as is.  I did, however, give it a simple dressimg of white wine vinegar and olive oil, and used real cooked and crumbled bacon. This was interesting, delicious, and makes a beautful presentation, particularly if arranged as a composed salad.

Really nice and so easy to put together. I also beefed it up: cucumbers, red onion, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke hearts, stuffed green olives and only two cans hearts of palm... Left out the bacon bits because I got a healthier crunch from the veggies. My BF found it too tangy but that's because I cut the oil and didn't balance the vinegar. I liked the kick though. Kind of expensive but I'd definitely make it again for small dinner parties.

My family LOVED this! It was very easy to make and yes, better the next day. I did make a couple of changes, based on other reviews. I used 1/3 cup light olive oil and added broccolli and cucumbers because I had them in the fridge. This was delish!! Oh, and I used white wine instead of vinegar. We ate it all and now I need to make it again for a party next week! Thanks for a great recipe!

Thank you for a wonderful base recipe! I have to admit I did change the recipe quite a bit but your recipe was the inspiration!! 

I omitted the bacon bits and olives. I used a bottle of light champagne vinaigrette from trader joe's to economize as another review suggested. FABULOSO!

Awesome as a side or as a meal unto itself! I'd never heard of champagne vinegar until I tried this recipe but it is perfect with this recipe! I love hearts of palm and am thrilled to have a way to prepare it besides just tossing it on to a salad.

I felt like this was just altogether too oily and salty. I am interested in trying another recipe with hearts of palm, because I think it is an interesting ingrediant with potential.  But, I probably won't be trying this recipe again. Thanks anyway!

Fabulous!  Can't wait to have leftovers today!  I hate olives so those were left out and subed with cherry tomatoe halves and chopped up artichoke hearts and salt and fresh ground pepper.  I used white wine vinegar.  I deleted bacon too, just didn't sound right in recipe. It's a keeper!

Wonderful! I subbed one can of hearts of palm for artichoke hearts and left out the bacon bits, but still enjoyed it very much! And it's a pantry salad.

Next time I will add some anchovies and small pieces of Romaine lettuce.  Also will try with macaroni to make a macaroni salad.
I used Italian dressing from a bottle because I didn't have powder.  
My husband loved it.

I added sundried tomatoes, used kalmatas instead of black olives, artichoke hearts, and some green onion. With all that flavor you can dress it much lighter than the recipe. Great recipe to tweak to your liking!

Check the proportions - by following the recipe exactly, I ended up with WAY too much oil, which ruined the taste of the dressing. I poured off about a third of a cup but the salad was still drowning. Even with a reduction in dressing and the addition of some red onion, the salad was bland and uninteresting.  Also, this is expensive - $15 for the three cans of hearts of palm; way too much for a side dish!

I liked the idea but instead of the dried Italian Dressing I substituted regular Zesty Italian. I didn't need any olive oil or water after the substitution. I also combined it with a recipe for roasted hearts of palm, that called for Parmesan and parsley. After I roasted the hearts I let them cool then combined the two recipes. Yummy

This was good. I subbed rice vinegar because I didn't have the white wine vinegar on hand, and added sliced jalapeno olives (from Trader Joe's). I think it was a bit heavy from the oil and dressing, so next time I would decrease the amount of both. Thanks.

My husband and I loved this salad so much, we were surprised. I had bought some hearts of palm to try them and searched out this recipe, and it's five stars all the way. I skipped the green olives, as it was perfect after I added the rest of the ingredients. Pass this one along!

I made it close to direction, I had black and green olives w/feta in them, the hearts were amazing and soaked up the dressing, i placed it on a bed of butter leaf lettuce, and added the sun-dried tomatoes.  It is on the vinegar side, but I like vinegar.  Yum Yum, thank you!!

Great salad, we made one bowl with and one without bacon for our staff meeting and people loved it.
