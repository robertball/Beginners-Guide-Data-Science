I first made this using less than 6 cans of chilies, I was afraid of the strength of the chilies.  It was so good I made it a second time using the complete recipe.  It was terrific.  I was reminded to rate it today because I came online to peek at the recipe because I'm making it for dinner tonight!

This recipe is super yummy!  We made this twice in one week, and the second time, we omitted the tortillas and put it over saffron rice.... Superb!!!

This was just an ok dish.  Usually my hubby and teenage son just devour anything wrapped in a tortilla with salsa, but this one they both said was kind of bland and not spectacular by any stretch.  followed the recipe exactly, so maybe it just needs some tweeking!

Very very good! A lot of flavor and a little kick... Only down fall is it's not very healthy. Will make this again...
