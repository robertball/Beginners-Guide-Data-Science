Tasty, but the breading is completely unnecessary.  So is the egg.  Just fry the stuffing balls as is.

None of my family likes stuffing so when I told them I was making stuffing balls they all groaned. Once they tasted them they were all gone in no time. 
I added 1 tsp sage to the dressing and I served them with Cranberry Salsa recipe I found on Allrecipes. So good. My son in law said they reminded him of great bar food!

I really enjoyed these. They need a dipping sauce of some sort. I will definitely pair these with a gravy next time around. They went together quickly and took even less time to cook.

These were quite good though I basically just took this idea and made it my own.  We had a lot of bread stuffing left, so I added some melted butter, garlic, and a bunch of shredded mozzarella.  Then did flour, egg and milk, and bread crumbs coatings, and fried.  They didn't taste as stuffing-y which was what I was looking for, and I found they actually tasted best dipped in pasta sauce!  Will definitely make these every year with the leftover stuffing, but might change up the additions.

Absolutely yummy!  I made stuffing and put turkey sausage crumbles in it, which gave the bites a nice kick.  I air fried them in the oven on my copper crisper tray.
