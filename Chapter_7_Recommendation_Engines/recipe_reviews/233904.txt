I kept to the recipe with minimal changes. Pesto is made with olive oil, so I didn't add any olive oil to the dish (this helped cut down on the calories).  This was a fast lunch to make, and regardless of incomplete directions I figured out where the extra pesto was used.  Please don't allow someone who rated this low (without making it!) dissuade you from trying this.  It's quick, and it tastes good!

I know they say if you change a bunch of stuff, it's not the same recipe but I had to "McGyver" it based on what I had on hand.  For example, I was out of pesto so I bullet blended a bunch of fresh basil and fresh garlic and olive oil.  Not exactly pesto but it did the job.  Also added some butter to cooked orzo for flavor and moisture. Eliminated red pepper (too overwhelming in taste) and red pepper flakes (I'm a spice wimp) but chopped some tomato and added at the end for color/moisture/flavor and because I still have a ton of tomatoes from my sisters garden.  Also cut up some fresh spinach and added to orzo to resemble something we love from Macaroni Grill.

Made this dinner tonight and it was super delicious. We did make a few changes; fresh basil, fresh garlic, fresh shrimp, sundried tomatoes instead of red bell pepper and then added some chopped cucumber in at the end for a bit of crunch. This is a great base recipe. Will definitely make this again.

This was too bland and dry for our tastes. I ended up doubling the oregano and garlic powder and using way more pesto.

I cooked raw frozen shrimp in my instant pot first before starting with this recipe. I cooked the Orzo about 8 minutes and added asparagus and sundried  tomatoes since I didn’t have any red peppers. I also added spinach as others suggested. I loved this recipe and would definitely make it again.

I’ve made this many times (without capers) and it’s delicious every time.  Thank you.

I swapped peppers and capers for a bag of broccoli and left out the red pepper flakes. I didn't have orzo so I used angel hair spaghetti. It was perfect! My 7yr old had seconds and I kept taking bites of it from the pan even after I was done.…It’s two years later and my daughter still loves this.

Very good! I read that it was a little bland so I doubled the pesto and seasoning, it was perfect for us! I also added onions and spinach to bulk it up. I will make this again!

So easy! I didn't have any pesto so I just tossed in the ingredients found in pesto. I didn't follow the measurements exactly either but all the ingredients blended into a super fast & easy delicious dinner.  I'm sure its even better if you follow the instructions exactly.

I really liked the idea and simplicity of this recipe. However, it is marred by having way too little pesto. I doubled the recipe (we are only two, but like leftovers!. I always have homemade pesto in the freezer in small containers. I used the whole container without measuring, so I'm not sure how much I used. Next time I'll try leaving out the olive oil added to the pasta, as there is plenty in the pesto. If I think it needs more oil, I can always add it later.

Made as written except substituted chopped sun-dried tomatoes for the red pepper and I only had 6 oz. of dry orzo instead of 8 and that was plenty with the approx 1 lb. of frozen pre-cooked shrimp.  I also added fresh basil out of the garden and the parmesan at the end as the original recipe writer called for (Allrecipes needs to correct the recipe as it has been transcribed incorrectly, as another reader pointed out).  It was very good and fast to make

I used 2 pounds of large shrimp, 8 oz orzo and doubled remaining ingredients, with the exception of the red pepper flakes.  Might use a bit more pesto next time.  Family really liked it.

I'm really just delving into the world of "real cooking" and this recipe was perfect. Just the right number of ingredients and steps that I didn't feel overwhelmed. The end results were tasty, although I think next time, I'll cut back on the olive oil.
