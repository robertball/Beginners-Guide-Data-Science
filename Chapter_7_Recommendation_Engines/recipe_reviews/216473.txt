I used to make Celery Root "Mashed Potatoes" myself, until my local Grocery Stores quit carrying Celery Root.  I Miss it so much.  It is creamier & tastier than Mashed Potatoes.  I never tried it like this with 1/2 Potatoes.  I used strictly Celery Root with white Pepper, salt, cream & Butter.  I put it in my blender & My Family liked it better than Mashed Potatoes.....it is a little sweeter flavor than Potato.....a creamy, delicious taste.  Does NOT taste like Celery!

The celeriac added a delicious, subtle celery flavor to the mashed potatoes.  I used twice as many potatoes (6), less butter (2 T), and skim milk.  Turned out delicious, but I would say it probably serves more like 4 than 12.

This was great! A tip: use rice milk instead of cream (you'll never know the difference) and heat it before adding it in. It will combine better and won't drop the temperature of the potatoes!

I did my own take on this "Celeriac Mash," and loved it. I added a clove of garlic to boil with the celeriac and potatoes. I also added some chopped fresh parsley the last 3 minutes of cooking. It turned out awesome and I have a new favorite way to prepare celeriac. Thank you kboraas for sharing your recipe.

Celeriac is such a great addition to mashed potatoes!  It gives a subtle hint of flavor without changing the texture too much.  I like to use red skin potatoes, unpeeled.  The small bits of color make this an attractive addition to the table.  I also mashed this with plain low fat yogurt to keep it figure friendly.  Thanks!

I had never eaten celeriac before but enjoyed this variation on mashed potatoes. The celeriac adds a mild celery flavor, almost as if the potatoes had been boiled in celery water. The consistency was similar to mashed potatoes, and I suspect that you could use celeriac in a one-to-one ratio with potatoes in any good mashed potatoes recipe.

Only change I made was I used 6 potatoes and used half and half (and a bit more than called for due to the extra potatoes)...  We loved it so much that I've made it two days in a row!  Thanks for the share!
