My version is slightly different. I use a whole roaster chicken to start. I brine the chicken first. Then, I pat the chicken dry season it and place it into my crockpot. Pour the sauce over it and let it cook for 6-7 hours on low. The chicken will come out moist with a wonderful glaze.

YUMMY!!  The whole family fell in love!  It smelled so good while cooking and tasted even better.  We added sliced onion and 2 diced garlic cloves along with black pepper right into the sauce mix and let it simmer the whole 2 hours, it was perfect.  Will make often, super easy, so few ingredients.  Thanks

The family loved it!  I doubled the sauce and doubled the onions.  It was great over mashed potatoes!  I added cornstarch to the leftover sauce to thicken a little more, then used it over meatloaf the next night.  Another great meal!

This is delicious, especially if you add more of the sauce onto your chicken after you cut it up on your plate. If you can't grill outside, this is the next best thing for BBQ.

This dish is great with drumsticks, too! I usually don't use fresh onion I season the chicken with onion powder!

I was really skeptical at first when I put that can of coke in, but I could not believe how the chicken turned out. My husband loved it! I used chicken legs instead though. Any  chicken will work really.

I increased the garlic, but still found this somewhat lackluster. It needs something to rev up the flavor. The chicken was also a little tough - watch cooking time VERY carefully, as I think it needs less than stated.
