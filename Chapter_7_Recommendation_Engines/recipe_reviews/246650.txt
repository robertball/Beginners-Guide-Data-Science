This granola is good and crunchy. Because I can't have coconut oil, I used avocado oil instead, which probably gave less flavor than the original recipe, but was still good. I also ended up adding some dried cranberries for a little tang. I think I might peel the apples next time even though it would reduce the amount of fiber.
