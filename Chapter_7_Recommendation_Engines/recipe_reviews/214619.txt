There's nothing quite like Beer Can Chicken at an outdoor BBQ! Ever since stumbling onto recipes like these here on AR we make these every summer. And, since there's never a shortage of beer in this house or neighbor's to help us eat these birds they've become a favorite. One I made with regular paprika and one I made with smoked paprika and I added a couple teaspoons of garlic powder to each one. It's much easier to take the seasoning mixture and blend it with melted butter vs. veg. oil and place half of it into the beer can and baste the chicken with the other half. Invest in the holder that you can purchase at Wal-Mart or Bed, Bath, & Beyond, you'll be glad you did!

I used this recipe as my template - I sprayed the chicken with cooking spray, rubbed on my favorite spices and used the rest for the beer can.  Wood chips are a must!  I used indirect heat (one side of grill turned off), kept the temp at 350 turning the chicken around halfway thru.  Best chicken ever - moist and tender and flavorful.  We are SO using this to make dinner for Father's Day.  Best thing?  No hot oven to overheat the house during the summer.  Thanks, this is a keeper! :)

I also put a small red potato over the neck of the chicken so the meat steams from the inside and stays nice and moist.  you could also use small balls of aluminum foil.  6/24/2010  For those of you that don't have a rack use a 24oz can for more leverage.  7/11/2010 Sorry that's a 16oz can.

Very good recipe. This method makes for really tasty chicken. Play with the rub depending on your tastes or mood. I like to do one chicken with the paprika, brown sugar, cayenne and another more savory with rosemary, thyme and pepper for example. Also, pierce a lime or lemon and push that in to the neck cavity.

I didn't use oil and instead of brown sugar I used Old Bay seasoning, some ground cumin, chili powder ( instead of cayenne) , salt and onion flakes.  I highly recommend any kind of wood . Don't forget to put an aluminum pan beneath the chickens , lots of fat drips.

My girlfriend found it to be too spicy, but even tho I am usually the one to complain about hot & spicy foods, I found this to be very flavorful. Very good in my opinion.

This rub is really, really good. I switched out cherry wood chips for apple wood and it really complimented the brown sugar and had a great contrast flavor with the paprika and cayenne pepper. We will make this the day after Thanksgiving tradition!

It was awesome, and my daughter loved it!  I had to make some adjustments but it turned out fine!  

I added about a quarter cup of Maple Syrup for a Canadian twist.  I also added a splash of beer as the rub was a little thick.  It was very windy (and cold.  Ahh, Canadian spring!) to keep BBQ at right temp, so I brought it indoors and used Convection setting on oven.

Will definitely be a keeper around here!

Love this recipe, exactly as is is good, but I had a problem with the grill flaring up when the fat from the bird melted into the flames, and drying out the white meat too much.  I then added a small cookie sheet between the chicken/beer can, and the grill grates.  That really helped stabilize the temperature over the cooking time, and lead to a much more tender bird.  Will use this recipe again with cookie sheet. Excellent recipe and spice mixture.

Used 25% of the salt and increased all other ingredients proportionally.  Fantastic.  The most tender and juicy chicken you could ask for.  Great recipe. Definitely will use it again.

Don't worry if the skin burns, the meat will still be VERY moist and tender!   I love this recipe and make it fairly often.  Everyone raves how good it is.  You can get the beer can holders at Lowe's or similar home store.

This is, for the most part, a great recipe. It's too salty, however, and I'll only use half the amount of salt next time.

This beer can chicken was my first on a masterbuilt electric. I smoked it for 4 hours at 215 degrees. I used a tall boy suggested from the reviews. This was the best I've ever had. The juices poured out,fantastic thanks!

It was amazing and tender. We put it in our smoker at about 275-300 degrees and cooked it for about 2 hours and it was falling a part tender. I added a bit of bbq rub to the chicken and the beer. 
Best chicken ever BBQ'd/smoked.

Great combination of flavours in this rub. I prefer to add enough olive oil to the spices to make a 'sticking rub' and slather on clean, dried chicken. Leftover spices go into the can and a 1/2 lime placed into the top of the chicken for cooking. Thanks for sharing!

I absolutely love this recipe. The chicken turned out great and the rub is the best. I now use the rub on all of our chicken that we grill and it is sooo good!!! Thank you
