I won't claim to be a vegan/gluten free expert, but it appears this recipe qualifies as both! The bonus, it can be made as a make ahead mix -so long as you wait to add the apple and water. Thoughts...I didn't make the full batch, and with an odd number of servings the reduction feature wasn't so handy. Regardless, I reduced it by fourths (1/4 cup oats, 2 Tbsp quinoa, flax, walnuts, etc., you get the picture) the one thing I did change was to use craisins- I prefer them to raisins.
If you prefer added calcium swap in milk for the water. Some may prefer a pinch of salt or dab of butter. 
Oh the aroma- mmmm so comforting on a cold winter day!!!

I've made many different oatmeal many ways and this is one of the best.

A yummy treat for oatmeal lovers, and as advertised,  keeps you hunger free until lunch.  I was at a bulk foods store a couple of hours after eating this recipe, and I was not even remotely tempted to buy any sweets! (Believe me, that's a first.)

I didn't have any Quinoa on hand, and I minced sliced almonds as opposed to using almond meal, but otherwise used ingredients as listed.

  I always add some milk and a bit of brown sugar to my bowl of oatmeal.  Terrific!

My daughter loved it and right away asked for seconds. 
I don't think the quinoa cooked through all the way, so I may pre-cook it some next time.
