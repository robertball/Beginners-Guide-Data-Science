Okay, I would place my rating for this recipe at 4 and a half stars. The taste of this meal is absolutely incredible, and I'm fourteen and I found the recipe fairly easy to make (the part where they nail you is prepping up the stuff to cook).

Now, I took off half of a star because the taste is one that grows on you. After too much, you'll want to push the plate away, good as it is. 

I also used Black Forest Ham, which added a nice, fancy touch to it. Also used more onions because I'm an onion addict. All in all, tasted great, but don't put too large a portion on people's plate and tell them not to do the same. Instead, save uneaten portions for leftovers and eat it slowly.

This is a good base recipe for using up leftover ham.  I've made it now several times after coming home from a 12 hour work day.  It's fast and good.  I usually have quite a bit more ham so I add what I have.  Sometimes I put in a cup or so of frozen corn or peas.  I never use the sour cream...other wise I follow the basic recipe pretty much.  There are never any leftovers.  Thanks!

Any recipe that my picky kids will eat deserves 5 stars, although I did sub onion powder for the onions so that they would eat it ;).  I made this for breakfast, added white pepper, wrapped them in a warmed tortilla...YUMMY!!  Thanks Lola!

We loved the slight crispiness of the ham and potatoes and the soft sweetness of the onion (I used a vidalia).  We didn't feel this needed sour cream.  Although we had this for dinner, my husband thought it would be a nice side for eggs... or even the filling to an omelette.

Not bad at all.  Easy enough to prepare, and makes a nice change from plain hashbrowns with breakfast.  I added a little bit of grated cheddar cheese and let that melt a bit before adding the sour cream.  My kids liked it.  What's not to like about ham and potatoes?  Thanks Lola!

Sorry Lola, but this dish is average at best.  I followed the recipe using ham from a leftover roast and was very disappointed with the results.  Next time I will put my leftover ham to better use.  Although this recipe received several good reviews, it's not one I will use again.

This worked very well for 2. It is an easy recipe to make in steps. I try to get as much of my dinner prep done in the early afternoon so I can spend time with my daughter when she gets home from school. At dinner time I finished cooking in no time. I think that it would be just as quick to cook all at once. The dinner got raves from my love!

So good and so simple. Did not add the sour cream. Great with leftover Honey Baked ham.

Substitute Spam for the ham, fry the Spam first and with the grease that renders out, fry the onions and potatoes. Crack your eggs into the mix, scramble, and when done, step away from the pan...and the stampede to it.

I had some leftover boiled potatoes that needed to be used.  Chopped them, used diced baked ham and a sweet onion.  We did not use the sour cream.  This was a very easy weekday dinner, served with fresh fruit on the side.  The leftovers were used the next day as a filling for omelets.  Thank you for posting, Lola.

This is the best use for leftover ham that I've seen! My wife didn't even want any to begin with, but then had two servings. I used Russet potatoes to keep the price down, but can't wait to try it with Yukon Gold.

Sometimes I enjoy cooking breakfast for dinner and I thought that this would be a nice change of pace for me to make. I enjoyed the taste and it was a stick to your ribs kind of meal combined with eggs and toast.  I used Sara Lee Deli Ham as I didn't have leftover at the time and thought it was good.

I never know what to do with left over ham, and this recipe helped with that. I made it last week and now I must make it again tonight. I love it and my husband just sent an email saying he can't wait for hammy hash tonight. We like it for dinner. Thanks for this :)

I made this for dinner tonight. But I subbed Johnsonville Mild Italian Sausage. It came out very delicious. Served with eggs and toast. The sausage was a nice substitution.

Very easy to prepare and quite tasty. The right combination of ingredients that hits the spot. Can be made even easier if you had left over mashed potatoes. A simple recipe.

Great-tasting, simple recipe. Nothing special. Sometimes I make it with onions; this time I didn’t. Tastes good either way. The first couple times I made it I followed the recipe and boiled the potatoes, but they got too soft and fell apart. This time I just fried them which took longer but they turned out much better—crispy on the outside but still got soft on the inside. The only negative to this is that the potato and ham are both pretty dry—you need a lot of ketchup and/or sour cream to keep it moist enough.

Discovered that I don't like hash with ham! That's probably me rather than the recipe.

You have to work to get a good crisp out of the potatoes, but it's worth it. Added a clove of garlic & some paprika, a strip of bacon left over from breakfast & used the bacon grease. Sour cream & franks. Done.

Very good! We had this for breakfast, but it would also be great for dinner.
