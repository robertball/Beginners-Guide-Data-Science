Following the recipe as written, I had to drain off a good amount of butter when I took the pie out of the oven. On
the second try, I cut the butter to 3/4 c., added a dash of salt and a splash of vanilla.  Excellent! and the texture is *much* better.

This pie was very good. I followed the advise of some other reviewers and cut back the butter to 1/2 cup. When I was rummaging through my freezer looking for a bag of walnuts that was hiding in there I found a bag of Heath toffee chips so I threw in about a half a cup of those too. Added a tsp of vanilla too. My kitchen timer can be playful and sometime during the timing process it started counting backwards. That sly little dickens has done this before. I didn't notice it until I smelled the pie getting what I thought was a little too done. I whisked it out of the oven immediately. It was still very good but I would have liked it a little more gooey. My husband kept asking "When can I eat this pie?" so I let him go at it while it was still hot. We both liked it very much. It was not the recipe's fault that the pie was a tad overdone. Will definitely make this again and keep an eye on my capricious timer.

I changed it to 1/2 cup butter. This mixture was perfect for one 9 inch pie shell. It wasn't to gooey or pudding like. it came out great.

So I've made this twice. The first time there was just way too much butter. Hubby and I use to get toll house pie at a restaurant we would go to frequently when we were dating & first married. I wanted something less gooey. The taste was there... but the texture was off from all that butter. Also the pie we're use to had a graham cracker crust. So the next time I made it I cut the butter down to 1/2 cup and didn't melt it. I softened it (It was very soft..some of it melted). I made Graham Cracker Crust from this site first and pressed that in my pie plate and let it sit in the fridge for 30 min before I filled it. Baked for about 55 min (last 10 cover w/ foil) and it was perfect! Still nice & moist. With these modifications it's a 5 star recipe..but as is 4 stars.

My family loves this pie. Its gone within a day when i make it. I always add a whole bag of the chocolate chips instead of just a cup. I think that thats also what fixs the problem with the extra butter that some people said they have. And make sure the butter is cooled when you make this if you leave the butter hot it makes the pie gooey.

I made it the first way as given and then improvised for an improved version the second time around (at least according to my friends and me). Cut the butter to 3/4 C add 1 tsp of pure vanilla extract and add 1 cup of old fashioned (e.g. non-instant) oats. It cuts down on the richness greatly but gives it great texture and flavor.

One of our favorites here -- we make a few small changes. First I only use 1/2 cup butter I also add a pinch of salt a teeny bit of vanilla and I also add a small pinch of instant coffee. With the few additions it really brings out the flavor of the chocolate. We've also discovered we like it with a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of semi-sweet chocolate chips and milk chocolate chips. Absolutely fantastic with some vanilla ice cream.

Delicous However... Too much better. It was just dripping everywhere. Be sure to put foil under the pie as it will also over flow. Mine took 10 minutes extra to firm and even then it was soupy. Cooling did help. I think with a few modifications this could be 5 star recipe. Second time around made it with 1 stick butter and added 1 tsp. Vanilla. now a 5 star. serve warm

I've baked this pie several times before using the recipe as written. I read several of the reviews and made the following changes with great results: reduce butter to 1/2 cup add 2 tsp vanilla extract and 2 tsp instant espresso granules. Blend the eggs and sugar thoroughly before gradually adding the melted butter. The filling is really thick. Bake as directed. Excellent results! Tastes like a thick chewy chocolaty chocolate chip cookie.

Unfortunately I thought this pie was worse than mediocre. It has a very bizarre consistancy of pudding-ish goo. It was not what I was expecting and this was left virtually uneaten at Thanksgiving. I did follow the recipe exactly. I will certainly not be making this again. Sorry:(

Just pretty good but the reviewers are right. 1/2 cup of butter is plenty even with extra chocolate chips. Upon making this recipe for the second time I've added the Neiman Marcus secret ingredient of espresso powder. I found 2 tsp was good for my taste. Excellent

If you like lots of nuts and soft cookies then you should enjoy this. I personally would prefer to make bar chocolate chip cookies and nuts in a 9X13 pan. It was just a little too gooey for me.

I made this for our New Year's day celebration dinner and everyone loved it! The only changes I made were to add 1 tsp pure vanilla extract a shake of sea salt and I used a little over a half a bag of the mini semi-sweet morsels instead of the regular sized chips and pecans instead of walnuts. I used the smaller chocolate morsels to avoid having the chips all settle down to the bottom of the pie during baking as others have complained about. That trick really worked! I also cooked it for 1 hour and 15 minutes to avoid it being underdone (too gooey) as some cooks have mentioned. I tried to cut the butter down to 1/2 cup (which was softened not melted) but when mixing in the chocolate chips and chopped pecans I could tell the batter was a little too tight so I added in an extra half a stick (1/4 cup) of softened butter at that point. The texture was great and the pie crust was so deliciously buttery. I originally thought a cookie crust would have been better than a traditional crust but it really complimented the cookie filling beautifully. We served it with Cool Whip topping which was wonderful but vanilla ice cream would have been great too! I remember getting the recipe for this off the back of the Nestle Chocolate Chips bag and making it for my 18th birthday "cake" years and years ago. I don't know why I waited so long to make it again. I'm sure I will be making it often since I've rediscovered this fantastic pie after all these years. Thanks for posting!

Expected the chips to hold their own (like in a cookie) but they turned into a mass of gooey chocolate. Totally sinful. Get a big glass of milk.

I have been making this for years. Use toasted pecans and a Keebler shortbread or grahm cracker crust and you will love. Also make sure you let your butter cool it changes the whole consistancy of the pie.

Didn't know what people were talking about about the butter until I served it up... all the extra butter settles into the crust. This was yummy but will definitely cut the butter next time. Oddly enough the original Tollhouse Chocolate Chip Pie recipe on the Nestle site called for ANOTHER half cup of butter!

Oh this pie is sooooo good! Like the others I reduced the butter to 1 stick. I also used milk chocolate chips. Otherwise I didn't change anything else. It tasted just like the Toll House pie I've had in restaurants. It tastes best served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or some whipped cream. Mmmmm!

I followed the recipe exactly and I did not have any problems with excess butter. Make sure you take the time to beat the eggs until foamy and mix it all very thoroughly. I had a nice smooth batter to pour into my pie crust and it baked perfectly for me.

This was a gooey rich dessert. Like everyone else we reduced the butter to 1/2 cup. We also substituted pecans for the walnuts. My husband wanted to dive into it immediately but it took a while to set up. Great topped with vanilla ice cream or with a big glass of milk!

I had high hopes for this and made a two pies for a bake sale. Unfortunately 1 hr. of baking time was much too much for me (I even took them out 20 mins. early!) and the crusts ended up burnt. The filling tasted good but I don't know how well they will sell.

great recipe very easy to make. To keep the chocolate chips from falling to the bottom of the pie i used an electric beater to slightly beat the filling before putting it in the crust. it made the filling slightly thicker and held the chips in place! Baked beautifully.

Delish! I LOVE this pie! I did half the butter as a lot of other reviewers suggested This pie is delicious made with the walnuts! I have also subsituted pecans or toffee bits instead and both yielded amazing results as well so feel free to use what you have on hand!

This recipe was just okay for me. I followed the recipe exactly except for the part about the nuts which is a personal dislike for me. But the chips melted in the pie mixture and it turned into just a weaker chocolate pie with brown sugar. My family liked it because they are not huge chocoholics but I probably will not be making it again without some revisions.

I've made this pie years ago & it is excellent BUT there is too much butter in this recipe. I used 3/4 cup of butter & it came out perfect. I too am giving 4 stars because the butter is too much as listed. I ended up serving this with Whip Cream as I was taking it to card group. Next time I want to serve sliced smaller warm with vanilla ice cream & drizzle of fudge sauce.

LOVE this pie! I usually omit the nuts or use very little. Also, I find that if you melt the butter and mix in while it's still hot, the pie is too runny. Either use softened butter or melt and let it cool before adding.

Oh my god this is the best pie I ever had in my entire life. With it I won First place at a Pie Contest and then I went to the finals and won 2nd place. Homeade whipped cream is the best topping on this.

Turned out kinda like blonde brownies w/ a crust. I baked this in an 8x8 square glass dish. Instead of a pie crust I Did a shortbread crust ("Shortbread Crust") from this site. It'll seem like its not done after the entire 1hr of baking but if really is it just needs to sit and chill for a bit. Definitely tastes good w/ ice cream on the side. The conistency of this in my opionion works a little better w/ 1/8 cup added flour and 1/4 cup subtracted butter and no nuts.

This pie was a hit at our New Years Day Dinner! I did make a couple of very minor changes to the recipe. I added 1/2 cup more of chocolate chips and 1 cup of butterscotch chips. Those were the only two additions. I will be making this pie again! It has already been requested! Oh also we did try with cool whip but I do think it would have been better with vanilla ice cream. Thanks for this great recipe!

Wow! What a treat! I also cut back the butter to 1/2 cup and it came out perfect. I added 1/2 cup of coconut the last time and it seemed to make the pie a little more moist. Definitely a keeper.

I used a ready made crust in a deep pie dish and did not have any run over. I left out the nuts on purpose and only used a half cup butter on accident and it still turned out wonderful! My four year old daughter said it is "awesome". It tastes like the derby pies my Mom made when I was growing up.

I have made this recipe many times over the years. I originally got it from a Nestle chocolate chips ad. I have always made it just as written with the full one cup of butter and have NEVER had any issues with having to pour off butter as others have stated. They must be doing something wrong. I use a kitchenaid mixer to mix all of the ingredients except I stir in the chocolate chips and nuts. It ends up as a nice fluffy thick batter (I love to lick the bowl). I pour it into a frozen 9" pie crust. True it is gooey when warm. You cannot cut it as soon as it is taken from the oven. It must cool and set. I do like to eat it slightly warm when it is still a little soft and gooey. Once it is completely cool it is a solid pie. The chocolate chips sink to the bottom so it is like two layers inside the pie. When cool I always warm my piece for about 10 seconds in the microwave oven to make it a little gooey. It is heavenly. I took one to a holiday gathering with friends as a last-minute addition to the desserts and everyone loved it--more than my other dessert! It is fast and so easy to make and comes out perfectly every time if you follow the directions. And using a frozen pie crust really makes it super easy. I will say when I looked this recipe up today the Nestle website now shows only 3/4 c. butter on the ingredient list. But I have always made it with one cup butter and I would be afraid to change it since I think it is perfection made that way.

This recipe is not edible as it is. I don't understand why people are rating it based on their modifications. It would save you a lot of time to melt a stick of butter and add some chocolate chips because that is exactly what this recipe tastes like. I was so embarrassed to serve this to my family even after I drained off the butter.

I made this for my holiday party at work and it got rave reviews from my colleagues. I have made it since then and it just bring back wonderful memories of my first cooking job at the SeaDog. The baker there made tollhouse pie and it was just ooey gooey delecious. This definitely needs to be served with a HUGE scoop of vanilla ice cream and a chocolate sauce drizzle!!!

Great EASY recipe. Like the others I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup. I also microwaved the butter so that it was soft but not melted (instead of melting the whole thing and letting it cool - too much waiting time for me). The texture was perfect! I used a store bought crust which was just okay. I'll make my own next time. Thanks Janice!

I followed other reviewers advice cut the butter in half added vanilla and put in the oven to bake. I guess I was in a hurry and dealing with my toddler and pre-teen at bedtime totally missed the part about putting it in a piecrust!! I know how could have overlooked that it is a "pie" recipe. I baked anyway pulled it out at 45 min. and BAM! Chocolate awesomeness!! Can't wait till next time with the crust but still very good.

The amount of butter is unnecessary and it ruined the pie. I let the pie cool for 15 minutes and yet it was still a soggy greasy mess so I had to bake for an extra 15 minutes which then burnt the crust.

The first time I made this recipe I used 1 cup of butter like the recipe calls for. The butter pooled to the top and the pie was absoluetly inedible. Yesterday I cut it down to 1/2 cup butter and had better results. I used a roll-our premade pie crust. I didn't think it was sweet enough although others did. I will try it with 3/4 cup white sugar next time. Also I will add a little vanilla.

This pie has always been devoured when I have made it one of my friends even asked me not to bring it over anymore because he always ended up eating the whole thing! I have made this recipe several times always with a chocolate cookie crust. In a rush I will purchase a store bought Oreo or chocolate graham crust which always works out great. When I have the extra time I buy the expensive chocolate wafers (yellow box not sure of the name) and process them mix abt 1 1/2 c crumbs with 6 tbsp melted butter and 1-2 tbsp sugar (to taste). This makes almost a brownie crust at the bottom. After one gooey mess I followed the advice of other reviewers and reduced the amount of butter in this recipe to 3/4 c and the result was amazing. I have made this recipe without nuts completely and also using plain or toasted pecans. Also this pie NEEDS a splash of vanilla. Amazing served with vanilla ice cream! Great pie always impressive and EASY!

My pie did not turn out like everyone else's did but I suspect that is because I baked it for longer than the recipe stated because it looked undone at the recipe time. My husband said though that it was the best pie he has had and loved it. I used pecans instead and topped it with caramel sauce to make it like a turtle cookie pie. USed splenda instead of regular sugar.

I just tried this recipe. Followed some of the reviewers suggestions and used 1/2 cup of butter a splash of vanilla and a sprinkle of salt. It came out good but not as good as I imagined it to be. It was a bit dry though I did follow the baking temperature and time. Perhaps it's because I only used 1/2 cup of butter. I ate this with ice cream. Overall a very quick recipe if you are craving a chocolate walnut pie.

This was very rich but delicious. Out of seven pies and various other desserts that we had for Thanksgiving this was the only one that was completely gone- and quickly! I have had toll house pie at various restaurants and was expecting something like a chocoate chip cookie in a pie crust. This came out more like a rich chocolate pie- it tasted similar to the chocolate in the middle of chocolate croissants. Very good but very rich!

this pie has an excellent taste!! I will however decrease the amount of butter next time. I did encounter one huge problem and would like some suggestions. When I made the pie for the second time- and I used the same exact ingredients- the pie overflowed in the oven to a great extent! I don't know why that happened?? love the pie- but I may consider making it in a pyrex type of dish next time. any suggestions???

This tasted DELICIOUS!! I did not have a problem with butter pooling. I did however have the "too gooey" problem. It looked wonderful coming out of the oven but once cut a pool of batter spilled out into the pie plate. Not sure if reducing the butter is the solution seeing how it tasted just right. I'll try it. If not maybe I'll try softened instead of melted butter. I'll definitely be experimenting because this is a keeper.

I thought this pie was pretty good. I didn't know what to expect at first as I have never heard of it or made it before. It is very very sweet but very yummy so I can see why so many reviewers suggest a scoop of ice cream ( it would compliment and offset the sweetness of the pie:o)I used 1 c. of chocolate melts and a cup of crumbled walnuts. I started baking the pie at 145 ( forced fan oven ) and turned down the temp to 130 after 30 mins as the pie was already looking done. I ended up baking it for 36 mins in total and I would say it was completely done at that time. Top was nice and the bottom was nice ( not too dark ). It is a sort of gooey pie - a pass between a pecan pie but also tasting like a chocolate chip cookie. Next time I would cook the pie the same way or decrease the start time to 130 and bake it longer maybe 40-45 mins and see how it goes. A very rich and tasty pie.

I love this recipe. It is ooey gooey buttery chocolatey confection. It is easy to whip up fast and makes a great alternative to a cake. I make it for company and everyone loves it!

Haven't made Toll House pie for several years. I don't think this is the same recipe and it wasn't as good as I remember. It had way too much butter--the butter went all over my oven and filled my kitchen with smoke. It was a wonder it didn't catch fire. Now have a big gooey mess to clean up.

I also cut the butter in half and added some oats-- but it was too dense I'll leave out the oats next time. Instead of walnuts I used 1c Heath brickle bits but could hardly taste them. maybe it was because it was all equally buttery-sugary-sweet so the toffee bits' flavor didn't stand out.

I was so excited about this recipe. Luckily I tried it out before taking to the family Thanksgiving dinner. It did not turn out as I expected. The flavor was fine (my fiancé loved it) but it had a strange gooey texture. I may try it again with a few alterations. My suggestion--have a back up plan.

Came out pretty greasy maybe need to cut down on the butter? But still tasty especially with a scoop of vanilla ice cream!

Thanks for the tip to cut down the butter. I cut it down by 1/4 and it was great!

This was delicious. I only used 1/2 cup softened butter added 1tsp vanilla and used a chocolate Oreo pre-made cookie crust. I placed a piece of tin foil on top of the pie the last 15 mins of baking since it was getting a bit brown.

This pie was outstanding. I added only half of the nuts that this recipe called for. Truely sinful.

THis was a really great recipe! I halved the butter after reading reviews and I wish I hadn't! I think it would have been much better/richer with the full cup. I also think it needed a dash of salt. Oh - and I used a roll out refridgerator crust. It obviously would have been better with the home-made.

This is such an easy and tasty pie. It is always a big hit at pot luck parties. I use Pecan Chips. which I like better than Walnuts. Otherwise just great!

Try softening the butter...don't melt it! And cut butter back to 1/2 cup or 3/4 cup...add a dash of salt and some vanilla. Yum!

This pie is delish.  I did use a full cup of butter.  Keep in mind, this is a pie, not a cookie.  Remember to beat eggs 'til foamy and to cool butter as stated.  Maybe that will help those that were having issues with the melted butter.

As suggested by others, I only used one stick of butter (1/2 cup).  I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and 1/4 tsp salt.  I used mini-pie tins for a good to-go and gift option.  The recipe made enough for 4 tins.  I decreased the baking time by about 10 minutes for the mini tins.  A very good and rich dessert.  Served them warm with a dollop of whipped cream.
