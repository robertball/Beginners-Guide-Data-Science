A litte different, but it grows on you.  Didn't have any creme fraiche, so I used sour cream.  Came out fine.  Will fix it again!

I tossed the hot penne with sour cream prior to adding the hot tomato sauce--very silky.  Instead of tuna I added pre-cooked Chinese BBQ pork.  Kids loved it.

Some people might say that I didn't really have this dish, at all, but lacking some ingredients, I got a little imaginative with substitutions:
Lacking a leek, I subbed a small onion and some minced garlic
diced tomatoes (with juice) did fine instead of crushed
I forgot the honey. :(
Dales steak marinade worked well instead of soy sauce (they have somewhat similar flavors).
And with no 5-spice, no creme fraiche, and no sour cream, I used (don't laugh) ranch dressing, ground cloves, ground cinnamon, basil, parsley, and ground black pepper
I also threw some crunchy chow mein noodles on top before serving.

Maybe I changed too much, but my wife ate it, and I'm looking forward to leftovers for lunch tomorrow. :)

I really enjoy the flavors in this simple dish that is sure to satisfy. While it might not be a favorite, it's one I always come back to. I like to make it a little creamier than the recipe calls for. Try pairing it with salad and the Asian Ginger Dressing.

I can see how this would be an acquired taste for some. I liked it a lot, and it was easy to throw together with ingredients I already had in the house.
