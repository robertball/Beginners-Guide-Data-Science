The recipe turned out great for me, a first time baker @38yrs.old,but i think it called for too many eggs. The first one I baked was good, but the second one could have won a prize. I used 6 eggs instead and used margarine instead of butter.

The batter was SOOO buttery.  I knew this cake would be like heaven. I followed the recipe to the letter(except the bake time. It was done in about half the time). However, when I ate it after baking, it tasted more like cooked eggs. I really did not taste any butter.  I think it was a waste of my egg and butter supply.  Sorry, but I would not make this again.

Great recipe and so easy to make.  The only thing I ommited were the eggs.  The cake will rise without them.  I would recommend to this anyone.  This is even Great for Kids or Adults who have allergic reactions to eggs.

Very Yummy!!
I did go by the suggestion of only adding 6 eggs.. turned out fine... and no eggy taste!.... When it came to beating the whites I added 2/3 of the sugar required to form a meringue like substance... it always seems to work out better for me. I would also suggest glaze (for that extra sweet tooth!) with 1/4 cup of milk, and 3/4 cup of white sugar, with a teaspoon of vanilla(combine over medium/low heat).

I cut this recipe in half without any issues.  The recipe is just right... the cake turns out moist and dense without being overly heavy.  The second time I made it I poured half the batter into a bread pan, spooned a line of strawberry jam down the center and then put the other half of the batter on top.  Strawberry filled pound cake was excellent!

I don't know what everbody is talking about when they stated that this cake did not turn out too well for them. I made this pound cake for the first time using 14 serving yield and I must say it was a HIT!!! I followed the recipe to the "T" and my cake came out perfect. What I like the most was how moist the cake was, it didn't taste to bland and the the top was perfect. I made this cake for Thanksgiving and it was gone that day. I'm making another tomorrow because it was so good. Thank you so much Carol for this recipe!!!!

This is the best!  The first time I made it was wonderful and went together very easily.  However, the the next two times they were frothy.  I had to throw out the first mixture of egg whites because there was too much liquid after sitting.  Then, I did them again, only I waited until everything else was finished.  The whites still didn't stiffen up but I used them immediately so it was better.  My husband just read that you're supposed to put a bit of salt in it and a little sugar and use it right away.  He also read that older eggs do better due to the chemical breakdown.  I had extra fresh eggs! I will try old ones the next time.  I will also cut the eggs back to 6.  I never have this problem when making meringue for pies, but I add cream of tartar and sugar to that.   But, this is truly the very best pound cake I've had in years.  I lost my aunt's recipe and this more than makes up for it!  All my family and friends rave about it!  H. Martin

i used everything the recipe called for, except i changed the cake flour to all purpose flour.  instead of using a tube pan, i used a loaf pan.  i only needed about 2/3 of the batter, and i cooked it for 2 hours instead of 90 minutes, and it came out perfect!  i;ll be sure to make this again!  thanks for sharing.

This was so easy and simple, I used 2 small loaf pans and it worked out soo well. It was still moist even after the 2nd day. We loved the fact it had a gooey top on it because well...that's my favorite part. Will make this again hopefully in a pretty bundt style pan. Delicious!!!!

This recipe turned out better than I had expected.  The only alteration I made was to add the zest and juice of two lemons and I reduced the eggs from 8 to 6.  The first time I put in all the batter the cake took about an 1 hour and 45 minutes and it boiled over a little but was still moist.  I believe the beaten egg whites made a big difference in the moistness. This recipe makes a large amount of batter.  The second time I made this cake I was able to also make 4 miniature bundt cakes and the bundt cake itsef cooked in exactly 90 minutes.  Maybe I could hold it all if I get a larger bundt pan.  Overall I will definitely use this recipe again.

I think this pound cake is OK, by no means Grandmas.  I would not make it again.  It is a little to egg-y for our tastes.  Still searching for the perfect recipe.

Thought it was pretty good. Made only half in order to make it in a loaf pan. Used 1 less egg than recommended but still a little eggy. Used all purpose flour, took 1 tablespoon of the all purpose flour out of the recipe to make it more like cake flour.

This actually turned out really good exactly as the recipe is. However, next time I make it(yes, there will definitely be a next time), I probably will use 1 or 2 less eggs, as it was a bit foamy and eggy...and maybe add a bit more vanilla. Regardless, it is still very yummy. My boyfriend won't stop eating it. :P

This recipe is fantastic and has become a regular request at our ladies monthly tea party. I use home made cake flour by taking 2 Tbs. of flour out of each cup and replacing it with corn starch. I keep messing it up but this recipe always seems to be fool proof!

The first cake came out too heavy, the second i added 1/2 cup of milk and 2 teaspoons of baking powder, much better. ( i did use the 6 eggs as recommended)

I made this cake yesterday.  It is very flavorful, not too sweet.  It is a firm pound cake and had a nice thin crust on top.  It was a little dry, but that may be due to my baking skills.  I would definitely make this again.

I craved a pound cake in the middle of the night, found the recipe, made it, and regretted it.  Bake time was longer than anticipated and was very dry.  Will never make this again!

Thank you for posting this! I just tried and it turned out really well. My husband preferred baking it in loaf pan instead of tube pan.

Just a little too eggy but nice and moist.   May try the recipe again, omitting one egg.  I baked in two loaf pans for 80 minutes.  The batter was tasty and the cake tasted much better the second day.

Used 6 eggs and 3 cups of cake flour.  It turned out great!  Mixed condensed milk, whole milk, and whipped cream and poured it over a small serving.

My cooking time was about 65 minutes.  I had enough batter for both a bundt pan and a small loaf.  I added some amaretto--between 1/4 and 1/2 cup and a 2nd tsp of vanilla. Used 6 eggs instead of 8. I noticed some people said that this tasted "floury", so I used 3 cups of flour--making that third cup with just a little extra on top, so less than 3 1/2 cups, but a tad more than 3 cups.  Served it with whipped cream, and my taste testers loved it!!  (we "sampled" the small loaf yesterday and I'll bring the full cake for Christmas dinner today.) Thanks for sharing the recipe.  I'm not a baker at all--usually a box mix person, and I was very pleased with the results.

Very moist and smooth texture.  Tasted a lot like eggs.  A good recipe but I would not make again if I was specifically looking to make a pound cake.

Im not the biggest Pound Cake fan ever, but this really was pretty good! I read the other reviews, and almost everyone said to bake it for much less time then called for, but when I did, it popped like a balloon! BAKE IT AS LONG AS IT SAYS. Anyway, it really was pretty good! P.S. It seemed to taste better the second day. I recomend making it a day early.

This was very good! This was my very first pound cake and I made it for Christmas and it was a HUGE hit. Everyone loved it. I didn't have to throw any of it out. The only thing I will do different next time is shorten the cook time. Which I do think it is all on how good your oven is and mine is pretty powerfull. I always shorten my bake times. I think it would have been more moist had I only cooked it about 65 min. or so. I did shorten it some. I cooked it about 75min. But it really was delicious!! I would absolutely make this again. Very easy and yummy!!

This is not a bad recipe..However I did modify the recipe by using 6 eggs instead of 8, I added salt and heavy whipping cream. In my opinon I would add some more sugar and vanilla extract. This is your basic pound cake recipe. The thickness of the cake is great!! It took half the tie to cook it baked in about 50min.. It all depends on your type of oven.

I used this recipe to make the french butter cakes: madeleines. I added a little baking powder to it and lemon extract and they turned out to be better than any madeleines made from a true madeleine recipe. So if you're looking for a great recipe for madeleines, try this one. Also if you don't have cake flower just use 7/8 all purpose flour and 1/8 corn starch. It's a great substitute!

I made this cake to cut up and use in a trifle. The frozen stuff costs too much. I probably only used about 1 1/2 cups of butter and used all purpose flour in a 9x13 pan. It turned out just fine for what I needed it for.

It's amazing how many "pound cake" recipes on this site that are not the old fashioned, traditional pound cake like this one.  These basic ingredients are all that's needed.  Mine was done aobut 15 mins earlier than called for.  Turned out great.

Cake was gone in a day! :) I used 6 eggs and an extra tsp of vanilla... the bake time was the same, except I probably should have taken it out 20 min early. This is because we have a brand new oven though. I glazed and sprinkled crushed candy canes for the holidays!

Amazing, cruchy crust and moist interior, a little difficult to make, but it was well worth it.

excellent! I skimmed the reviews and followed suggestions and it turned out great! I used halved the butter, doubled the vanilla, added a little bit more sugar, added a little cream with the milk. It's absolutely perfect! Reminds me of angel food cake. I served it up with pureed fruit and fresh whipped cream. it was just great!

This recipe was easy to make, but the cake was dry.  I also had a hard time getting it to bake all the way through.  It took longer than the recipe stated.  It also didn't have a lot of favor to it.

When I did this recipe I used one less egg, and a tad more sugar. It came out wonderfully! It was my first time baking a cake, and even though I stumble over a few steps it turned out delicious. I decided to make some real whipped cream to go on top and my family loves it. I'll definitely be making this again and again!

Very good, tastes a lot like shortbread, especially in the dough stage. Quite light in texture, not heavy like other pound cakes

Delicious!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  My grandmother, who is 88, tasted this and loved it!  She is in assisted living, so she can't cook anymore.  She has requested this cake again!

EXCELLENT recipe!  So easy to make, so delicious and moist!..had everything on hand..my alterations were: I increased milk to 3/4 cup, doubled the vanilla to 2 tsps, used 6 eggs instead of 8, and added grated Hershey milk chocolate bars to the batter (about 1 cup grated), then baked for 50 minutes, not 90 mins. as stated.  Baked it in 9"x13" pan; my husband ate 1/2 of pan in 1st sitting..didn't last 24 hrs in my house! Thanks for posting this one!

This cake is delicious and if done properly the texture is awesome. The only complaint is that with the time given its slightly too done. Maybe 15-20min would be better. We also originally wanted no glaze but seeing it was a little too dry on the outside so the glass helped with that.

Just made a slight change since I ran out of eggs so instead of 8, I only used 7 and since I don’t have any cake flour too, I did the cornstarch/all purpose flour remedy. Photo doesn’t do much justice but the cake is heavenly! I’ll probably add some dried fruits one day or add some lemon zest. Sugar used was from 2 2/3 down to 2 cups only. Just my preference as I’m not much into really sweet cakes... thanks for sharing!!!!

I wanted to add a return but couldn't - have to finish the review here.  Despite difficulties getting it to mix well and the crust being a bit odd, it was a lovely moist cake.  I have made a few adjustments to my second try...5 eggs, a little less sugar and flour, a little more milk, and added the whites in the mixer at the end instead of hand folding.  The batter ended up much more workable and also much larger (I suppose better egg white results?), so I think this will be the ticket.  Oh since I cut out three eggs I also added about 1/2t baking powder.

I have made this cake number of times. I did make a change by putting a suger glaze on top of the cake. When I served the cake I would put a slice of cake with strawberries glaze on the side. The people just loved it.

This is a great recipe! It came out golden brown and fluffy. Tastes great too! The only change we had to make was we didn't have a tube pan so we just used two loaf pans.

OMG! I'm sorry to review without trying .  but I just feel I need to make a comment. People are reviewing this and complaining, without even trying. It is supposed to be pottery poundcake is supposed to have a pound of butter. It's not meant to be fat free or healthy .i  rely heavily on these reviews when trying new recipes.

I can't say for this recipes exact ingredients; but halfway into beating the whites I realized I didn't have enough butter. I had one stick of butter so I substituted 1 cup of sour cream and 2 bananas.  I added 1/4 of cake flour, 1/4 cup of spiced rum and maple extract. Baked in a 9x13 pan for 65 minutes. It turned out surprisingly amazing! With 3/4 of the amount of butter called in the recipe I call this "healthy".  I wonder how good it would be with all of that butter tho... will definetly make this again

I cooked this cake in a 9x13 pan with 6 eggs, and I accidentally burnt the outer layer of the cake, and I think the burnt part might actually be the best part! Delicious cake, phenomenal recipe, just cut down on the eggs.

At first I thought it my family would not like it because it was so dense, but family and neighbors demolished it and asked for more! I added more vanilla and almond extract, and i will add a tiny smidgen of leavening to my next cake to lighten it up ever so slightly...It definitely grows on you...

Too many eggs and unnecessary steps that did not make the cake taste like anything I would serve guests.  Definitely will not use this  recipe again.

Absolutely delicious.  I was kinda confused with folding the eggs, but it came out okay.  It's really great with a cream cheese spread.

Made this tonight as dessert! We used 6 eggs instead of 8. I also made a glaze for it. 1/4 cup milk, 1 tsp of vanilla and 1/2 cup of confectioners sugar. 

Definitely would recommend this and putting the glaze on. I am a starter cook so by all means do what you feel it needs but this turned out just right for a picky family.

It was a really nice cake and I made it for Church and it was the only cake that dissappeared did not even get to taste it the first time I made it but second time was great.
