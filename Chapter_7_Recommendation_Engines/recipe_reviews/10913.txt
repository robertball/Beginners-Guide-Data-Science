I give this recipe 5 stars, because it has GREAT flavor.  HOWEVER - I MADE A CHANGE which also resulted in a wonderful 'full' cookie.  Something to keep in mind when baking cookies is that if you use butter, your cookie will spread much more than using shortening.
After reading several reviews which commented on the cookie recipe spreading a lot, I decided to replace the 3/4 c butter with 1/4 c butter and 1/2 c butter flavor shortening.  This change will give your cookie a flakiness or 'shortbread' texture, yet keep it's shape as it cooks without spreading.
I also decided to alter the flour - I used 1/2 regular flour and 1/2 self rising flour.  This too helped keep the shape.
I also put my dough in the freezer for 2 hours to chill (I was working on rolling out a batch of regular sugar cookies) so that when I placed it on my well floured board, it rolled out perfectly.  
I always hate to see good reviews for a recipe that has been changed, as it really isn't the same recipe if it has been changed up. . . but this was a great base to work with and with the slight alterations, which didn't affect the flavor whatsoever, it will be a cookie recipe that I will use for years to come.
Thanks!

These were great once I made a few modifications. The first batch came out about a milimeter thick, so I added a couple tablespoons of flour and about 1/4 teaspon of baking powder to the remaining dough, and the next round plumped up just right.

I read lots of reviews before making these, but in the end decided to follow the recipe.  As written, I would rate this a 3, but with some changes, it is a 4.  I made one full batch, and they were indeed flat.  That would have been okay - some flat cookie recipes are meant to be just that and taste great.  These, on the otherhand, felt very greasy and tasted that way.  My husband really wanted maple cookies, and I was tempted to switch recipes, but decided to try this one again with some changes.  Reduced the butter to 1/2 cup and increased the flour by 1/4 cup.  They didn't come out nearly as flat, had terrific flavor and were softer, a little more cake-like.  I made the icing as directed and drizzled it over the cookies.  My husband loves these and agrees with the submitter's husband - these remind him of a maple bar - his favorite kind on doughnut.  Will probably make this again, but definitely with changes.

What a delicious cookie!  I used this recipe last year and have been "reminded" that I need to make these again for the holiday season this year!  This cookis is tasty without the frosting and VERY tasty with the frosting.  Nice subtle maple flavor! *note: only drop 1 tbs. or less of dough per cookie & leave 2" space between each for spreading.  Do not add more flour, the dough is suppose to be very sticky.*

It does not get much better than the taste of these cookies. However, I did have a few problems baking them, it took me a while to get it right -- be sure you make only VERY small balls of dough because these things spread like crazy without any leavening and not much flour. They are very sponge-y and soft and taste great with the frosting. My roommates ate the whole batch the night I baked them.

Can you say SUPER-YUMMY?!!  For the holidays, I made a wide range of cookies and bars, and I have to say, that these were the first to go!  EVERYONE loved these!!  I think it's because there aren't too many maple cookies out there, but whatever it is, a HUGE success with everyone!  The only thing I recommend is if you're going to stack them on one another, make sure to put a piece of wax paper between them, so you don't get 4 cookies stuck together!!  :)  Thanks!!

Absolutely Fantastic! Everyone who tasted one fell in love with them! This is definitely my only Maple Cookie recipe from now on. By the way, though, I couldn't find Maple extract so I just used generous amounts of Maple syrup. Yum!

These were great with the changes of another reviewer. Decreased the butter to 1/2c and increased the flour to 1 3/4c. These will definitely be added to our cookie rotation.

These cookies were soft and cakelike, yet very thin. They definitely need more maple flavor, so add extra maple extract to both the batter and the frosting. The cookies have a strong brown sugar flavor, so perhaps substituting 1/2 of the brown sugar with white sugar will remedy that.

Very good cookie!  Yum!  I used some of the hints provided in the reviews (more flour, more baking soda and butter flavored Crisco in place of some of the butter) and these cookies turned out beautifully.  The icing just puts them over the top.

These are so good! I can not stop eating them. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out great. They didn't spread to much while baking for me, but I did make pretty small balls. I will be making these again for sure.

After reading the reviews i was so excited to make these. I followed the recipe to the t. No offense but they were tasteless and fell flat. No matter what i tried, they were almosy paper thin. They were so greasy i had to put paper towel under them and it got soaked. The prep was simple, but the glaze tasted like pure sugar. I was so disappointed :(

These cookies are yummy and chewy but are rather greasy, and they do spread quite a bit. I used just a tad more flour than the recipe and a little more maple extract. My family thought they were very good, though I got more compliments on the icing than I did the cookie! I would make these again, maybe with less butter next time.

I thought these cookies were wonderful! I didn't have any problem at all with them spreading but I did add a tad more flour than called for. I also didn't have any maple extract. I used real maple syrup so they don't taste very "mapley"-the maple taste was very subtle. Next time I'll use maple extract. Cookies are not my forte but these were simple!

These cookies are awesome!  You definately need to add one cup extra cup of all purpose flour to the recipe and roll out on a well floured surface for them to hold their shape.  Instead of the icing listed, I used a royal icing recipe and added a little of the extract to give it a more professional look. Amazing! I wrapped them and sold them at a craft fair recently and they were a huge hit! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Will not make this recipe again.  Cookies spread into one another and filled the pan.  I should have just spread the cookie dough onto two cookie sheets.  I even added the extra flour and baking soda as recommended by another reviewer.  Ends were overbaked and center was not done.  Very disappointed.  I was hoping to have a great treat for the family.  We love maple cookies.  Will have to try another recipe.

Very good cookie!  I had maple extract in the pantry, and no clue what to do with it.  I took the advice of other reviewers, and used 2.5 cups of sugar, and I had NO trouble with spreading.  I found that it did not need but 9 minutes, but I made them relatively small cookies.

These cookies are pretty good.  I didn't use a lot of the maple frosting on them, just because it's so sweet.  But, I did take one raters advise and used 1/2 cup butter and increased the flour by 1/4 cup and they did come out more cake like than flat.  I'd make these again.

big hit at Thanksgiving.  I did them as cut outs (maple leaf and turkeys) and refrigerated the dough and then rolled out and frosted.

Sooo good. Used margarine instead of butter, as thats what I had... put a little extra baking soda, and maybe 1/4 cup more flour, as people said they spread too much? Ended up with perfect cookies that spread just enough, but held a good shape. As for the icing... I didn't have confectioners sugar, so I put in 1/2 a cup or so of sugar with a little yogurt and marg... blended it up with some maple extract and drizzled that over the cookies. Dried up more like a glaze than icing... but tasted wonderful.

The cookies themselves are awesome... totally worth making again!

I love this recipe! They bake up very flat, but that's not a problem.  I used a little bit more maple extract in the cookie.
They're ok right away, but they get 5 stars from me for waiting until the next day to eat them.

Fantastic cookies! I increased the flour by 1/4 cup and used 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening based on feedback from others. Also used 1/2 tsp baking powder. They were perfect! Nice and chewy, lots of maple flavor. They baked up nicely with just right amount of spreading. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great but not good for shaping into maple leaves.  They are good w/out frosting. W/frosting they are quite sweet and mapley.  A true lover of maple  syrup might be able to tell it's maple extract and not actual syrup added to the mix.  I'm using this recipe sans frosting for a harvest party.

These were phenomenal! I added 1/4 cup more of flour like other reviewers suggested and the cookies turned out just right.

I made these cookies for my co-workers. I made two batches, one with dark brown sugar and one with light. I would recommend using dark brown sugar- they are more colorful and hold shapes better.

These cookies taste great!  Easy recipe and quickly made.  I let them cook just a little longer so that they are crispy around the edges, otherwise they are soft and chewy.

I made these tonight to maybe take to my family's house for Thanksgiving.  The flavor is fine because I took another member's advice and added more maple flavor to the batter.  However, the cookies came out crispy and probably TOO thin.  I assume they're supposed to be like a maple snickerdoodle.  Maybe it's because I sitrred them too long (the recipe didn't say softened butter although I softened it for about 15 seconds anyway), but I am pretty disappointed.  I haven't frosted them yet, but I don't think that will save them.

The flavor is there...but these are NOT what we have been looking for in a "maple" cookie by any means.  They are super thin and more like a snickerdoodle.  I even "undercooked" them AND made sure my cookie sheets were cool, so that the cookies would not spread sooooo much...but, to no avail.  Very disappointed in this recipe.

5 Stars!!!!  These were really really delicious.  I used a little extra maple extract (my family lives for maple flavored anything!)  This is our new favorite recipe.

When I took these out of the oven, I decided that they really weren't the type of cookie that would be improved greatly by frosting, so I ate them plain.  They were great!  I made the suggested changes of half butter, half shortening, and a teaspoon of baking powder.  I used some maple syrup (not exactly sure how much) instead the extract.

Pretty good cookies. They had a really good texture and were really soft. However I kind of felt like they were missing something. I thought they could've used a little more maple extract,but all in all they were good cookies.

Since it was rated so highly, I didn't read the reviews until I removed my 1st round of test cookies from the oven.  They had spread all over the pan.  I added flour, but not enough.  I ended up adding about 1/2 c of flour and the cookies are still flat but at least not quite as greasy.  There are far better recipes for maple cookies out there.  AVOID THIS RECIPE.

This cookie was fabulous and absolutely delicious!!!  It does lose some flavor in baking and the frosting makes up for that!  I loved the taste of the plain ones and so did my kids.  That says a lot for a cookie recipe.  I will definitely be making again and again!  This cookie is now in our dessert rotation of recipes. Thanks so much for sharing xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo

Excellent but the consistency wasn't right for individual cookies so I put them in a jelly roll pan.  Baked for 8 minutes.  Could have used more frosting - next time I'll increase the frosting by 1/2 again.  These maple bars were so easy to make and tasted terrific.  The frosting added so much!!  I'll definately make these often.

These are really good! I used to crave those  maple leaf cookies from Canada, but these are so much better! Really rich maple flavor. This is my new favorite cookie. I suggest doubling the recipe, after you taste them you'll see why ;)
