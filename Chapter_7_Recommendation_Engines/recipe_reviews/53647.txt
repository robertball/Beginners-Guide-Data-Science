I used a whole head of roasted garlic and mixed the seasoning right in (garlic powder, onion powder, lemon pepper and steak seasoning instead of the Cajun). Skipped the sweet onions. Made the burgers smaller and used regular hamburger buns (never seen the Hawaiian rolls around here). Topped my burger with processed cheese, Emmenthal, lettuce, regular tomato, pickles, Dijon, mayo & ketchup. I did my best to stay true to the recipe. These are a handful and a mouthful, but so tasty! It does need to be seasoned a little more, and maye use raw garlic instead, as it was way to mellow to taste in my opinion after being roasted then cooked in the burger. Served this with "Spiced-Up Grilled Tater Wedges" from AR.

We thought these were DELICIOUS (and messy, lol)! I have to admit, while I did use all the ingredients called for, I didn't measure, but used them  more or less 'to taste', like more roasted garlic, spices and so on... I realized too late that I didn't have any gas in my grill, so I used the Goerge Foreman. Because of that I sauteed my onions in a pan, and then put them on top of the burgers after they were cooked. This does seem like a long list of ingredients, but these really do come together easily. I will definately be making these again, hubby already informed me of that, lol! Thanks for sharing. :)

A nice break from the same ol same ol. We all enjoyed these. Will make them again. They go good with the Tail burner firehouse french fry recipe on this site.
