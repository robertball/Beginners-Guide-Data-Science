This i a great little salad that looks really impressive when you take it to potlucks or make it for house guests, even though it's completely easy to make!  I  have played around with different cheeses in this salad, and montchevre goat cheese is my favorite so far--it's crumbly, yet creamy and smooth.  I also like to add julienned apples or pears, and fresh blueberries to the mix, for added color and flavor.  I have also found that I should make extra candied nuts, because I tend to snack on them before I put them on top of the salad.  :)

I make this all the time...it's a great salad...very refreshing. I've also added slided bosc pears to the salad which gives it a nice taste.  Sometimes I switch out gorgonzola for feta to change it up...very good salad!

I've made this a bunch of ways but prefer candied pecans instead of walnuts and have successfully subbed blue cheese instead of gorgonzola. Plan to serve for a Christmas dinner party.

Fabulous! Few tweaks - used plain rasp vinagrette, spring mix for the greens, and I used pecans and didn't let the sugar turn completely into syrup - instead removed them from heat after clumps of crystallized sugar formed on the pecans - more texture. Sooo good!

Awesome salad.  I tried to make my own rasp vinagrette dressing, but don't waste your time - use store bought raspberry vinagrette (I used Ole Cape Cod version).  The walnuts were an awesome addition. (be careful they get super hot in the pan)
 I did however add very thinly sliced red onion to the salad to cut back on the sweetness.

Very tasty.  I have made this salad twice now.

It is good with spinach as well.

Re: the gorgonzola, I would recommend using domestic rather than imported as imported tends to be creamier and less clumpy and therefore does not incorporate as evenly into the salad.

Also, I found the candied walnuts to be a bit sweet and would probably in the future make it using 1/2 cup walnuts and a little less than 1/4 cup sugar.

Overall, an excellent, elegant salad.

This was a great recipe. I had never candied walnuts before and they were easy and delicious! I simplified htis by just using a Kraft pre-made raspberry vinaigrette and skipped the oil and vinegar. Otherwise I kept all the other ingredients the same. Love it!

We all loved this salad.  It's so simple to make--and can be kept exactly the same or changed to fit your personal preference, current grocery supply, or whatever.  I used dried cherries instead of cranberries and it was delicious!

I found that it was better to add the walnuts when the sugar begins to melt to a syrup rather than right away - that way there was no crystallization and the walnuts didn't burn.

I have had this salad at an upscale resturant.  It was so good I had to go home and recreate.  I use dried cherries instead of cranberries and use Poppyseed dressing as a quick substitute for the vinaigrette.

This was a good change from a regular salad. Word of warning, be careful when doing the walnuts...if you cook them too long they will give off a slightly burned aroma and they will end up tasting like popcorn or cracker jacks.

My husband and I both loved this! We made it using spinach and made our own salad dressing from seedless rasberry jam, Balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

This salad is perfect. I was looking for something springy last year and came across this. Absolutely delicious! The only thing I do different is add salt and pepper to the greens and use less sugar on the nuts. Sometimes I add chicken to the salad to make a complete meal.

This salad is great but I made a few changes. I added 1 Granny Smith Apple (Cut into semi-thin slices) and 1 medium Avocado (cut into chunks).  I also used Newmanâ€™s Light Raspberry & Walnut Dressing rather than making my own and omitted the White Vinegar and Olive Oil. Yummm!!! :-}

Yum! I subbed goat cheese crumbles instead of gorgonzola (personal pref). I wasnt sure about the walnuts but I resisted the temptation to add a bit if water. Be patient the sugar will melt. Dont let it get it too brown. As soon as it melts toss to coat and pour them out!

Thank you Missy! I was a little annoyed with the extra effort I had to go through to find Gorgonzola cheese (small city) but it was worth it in the end. I don't think a thing about this recipe needs to be changed. It is absolutely delicious, I will make it again and again. P.S. The candied walnuts are amazing and make an awesome sweet treat. Make extra!

You can't go wrong with this salad. If you want to make it a little bit less sweet/healthier/faster prep  I suggest using regular walnuts. I've made it both ways and both times I LOVED It!

If you add a little Old Bay or Tony Sacchare's Cajun seasoning to the sugar mix, it adds a little bite to the nuts and is delicious.  Thanks.

I never had gorgonzola cheese before and I'm not a huge fan. I brought this to Thanksgiving dinner tonight (Canadian) and never received one compliment. I'm giving it 4 stars though because I don't think I enjoyed it because of my own taste preferences. The candied walnuts were sooooo good..although next time I will try a syrup on them and then roast them in the oven to prevent the sugar clumping together. I also agree that you don't need nearly the amount of sugar called for. Thanx for introducing me to candies walnuts these will be amazing on all my salads.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this!!!  Since finding this recipe I have made it 3 times in the past month:  for Thanksgiving, Christmas Eve and for my office dinner party.  It is a hit with everyone (even my kids and my picky sister who normally says mixed greens look like weeds!)  I cannot say enough about this salad.  Wonderful as is!

This salad is so easy to make and take and I always receive lots of compliments. I've just used a big bag of spinach instead of mixed greens and it tastes fabulous. I also slice up a ripe pear and add to the salad. To make it easier I use the Kraft Raspberry vinegrette dressing. Even my mother-in-law liked it. I've actually made the salad 4 times in the last 2 weeks and will be making it again this Saturday for another event. It's been great for the holidays!

Fabulous! I made this for Bunko night and it disappeared with requests for the recipe. I used a homemade poppy seed dressing instead of the vinaigrette...it created such a perfect combination together! Will make this regularly.

This salad was delicious. I spent hours making baked spaghetti from scratch so I cheated on this recipe to save time. I bought the walnuts already candied and used a pomegranite vinagrette from Whole Foods and addd sliced pears. Still came out great!

Simple, and delicious.  Made the recipe just as directed.  Yum!  I think the next time I will make it with candied pecans!

wanting to try this, but I can't find the vinagrette.  Where do I get it and what exactly is it?  All's I could find is the raspberry vinagrette dressing already bottled.

This salad if so refreshing. The goragonzola cheese adds such a wonderful tangy zip! Mixed with the sweet walnuts --- all I can say is YUM!

Awesome salad! I brought this to a dinner party, and everyone raved about it.  Gorgonzola was too expensive, so I just bought crumbled blue cheese and it turned out great.

I used red wine vinegar because I didn't have the raspberry one but it came out good.  I was worried if it would be too sour for my taste without adding any sugar in the dressing but the candied nuts and the amount of cranberries definitely helped.  But I needed more dresssing so I tripled it.  For those who are not used to make those candied nuts, like me, be careful not to over cook them or they will taste like burnt...  Also I tried both with or without water to caramerize the nuts and I say no water!  Like other reviewer said, they became like white sugar coated nuts and didn't taste good at all.

This was delicious! I used fontinella cheese just because I don't like gorgonzola very well. I used more walnuts and less sugar too. I used my own salad dressing, homemade shallot vinegrette and it was just fantastic.

This salad is great.  I prefer a sweeter and crunchier nut topping, so I add 2Tbs of honey to the nuts and sugar mixture, after the sugar melted.  I also tried goat cheese if I don't have Gorgonzola.

OMG this was amazing!  Did not change a thing, the proportions were perfect.  As suggested by some reviewers, used Ole Cape Cod Raspberry Vinaigrette and Craisins for the dried cranberries.  Note that the candied walnuts do take about five minutes to get going!  Excellent, will definitely make this again!

Really enjoyed the candied nuts, but the cheese was way too bold for this light salad. I think maybe a feta cheese would have been nicer.

My family loves this salad. I've used walnuts and pecans, our preference being pecans. The first time I made the vinagrette as listed. Now I use the dressing from Jamie's Cranberry Spinach salad from this site.

This is one amazing salad! The sweetness of the candied walnuts, the tang of the cranberries and vinaigrette and the bite of the blue cheese are contrasts that all worked beautifully together. These delicious flavors just pop in your mouth with every wonderful bite. Thank  you!!

Loved this salad!  I did add a chopped pear, and the flavors of the candied walnuts, the Gorgonzola, the pear and the cranberries were a combination made in heaven!  The salad dressing added a light, bright touch and complemented well.  This will definitely be a repeat!

This salad was very good, but I only gave it 4 stars because some of the walnuts were so hard after coating with sugar and heating. Will try a different technique next time I make this. Constant stirring of nuts in sugar???

could probably cut back a little on the sugar. also, might consider 2 T raspberry vinaigrette, 1 T olive oil, and no vinegar. i used blue cheese b/c it was all i could find. seemed like an okay substitute. i'm sure gorgonzola would be delicious. Second time: tried with goat cheese and romaine and it was super good.

Loved the walnuts!!  They took under 15 minutes to make.  Here are the things I did differently . . . 1. I used a 6 oz bag of walnut pieces and 1/4 + 1/8 c sugar.  2. Used Pomegranate dried cranberries (made by OceanSpray).  3. Didn't have the cheese so I just added some shredded cheese.  4. Just used the raspberry vinaigrette but am going to try adding the vinegar/oil to cut back on the sweetness of the dressing.

This salad is good, however, it's the walnuts that are DELICIOUS! They were so yummy that I made a huge batch of them, bagged them, and gave them out as gifts. Everyone loved them. Much , much cheaper than the ones in the grocery stores. They taste great sprinkled on ice cream, yogurt or to just snack on. Four stars for the salad, but 5 stars for the walnuts!!

EVERYONE loved this salad.  The biggest rec' I can make is to melt your sugar by itself and add the walnut/pecans after the sugar has melted.  I used pecans and they over cooked while in with the sugar.  All and all a FABULOUS salad!  I skipped the white vinegar and it was great...not a bite left at our dinner party.  While I was doing the dishes and wanting to clean the bowl, my friends were still putting their forks in to finish the salad off.  RAVE reviews.

Made this for a potluck in a huge bowl, equivalent to 30 servings. Only 22 people showed and the salad still got eaten. I probably ate 3 servings myself!

Delicious! My first time making candied nuts, next time I'll start melting the sugar and then toss the nuts in, instead of adding them at the same time. I had problems with clumps of sugar sticking to the nuts and not melting. And this salad doesn't keep well, so you should put it all together within an hour of serving and be prepared to toss it after a few hours out.

This salad was amazing. I used goat cheese because I couldn't find gorgonzola at the two different stores I went to. I also topped it with grilled salmon! Yummmy. My 4 yr old and 2 yr old both ate their whole bowls full.

So easy, and sooo delicious!! I had read previous reviews about this salad and decided that candying the walnuts on my own might not have turned out so good, so i just purchased some pre-candied walnuts from the produce department. It turned out awesome, and was even easier to prepare!!

Good salad, except for the candied nuts!!! Next time I will make this with pecans or slivered almonds. The sweetness of the sugared walnuts, along with the cranberries was overwhelming.

Candied nuts, goat cheese and dried cranberries are an AWSOME combination.  I used pecans instead of walnuts.  I don't care for berry dressings so I made my own.  Served this with a Father's day meal and it was a HUGE hit.  Dressing included: juice of 4 lemons, couple table spoons of olive oil, couple table spoons of brown sugar, pinch of salt, and a couple cranks of fresh ground pepper. (Basically just add everything to taste.)

I served this salad for eight guests last weekend - they loved it!  They all went back for seconds.  I am making this again for my daughter for lunch today.    I added slices of  pears and apple to the salad also.    There was the sweetness from the fruits but the bite from the cheese.  All tastes came together.    I did use  wild rocket salad mix, American and European blends of lettuces and also added some cress.  The different flavors from these also added a great taste.  I used bottled raspberry dressing.    This was an awesome salad.

This was a big hit for my Christmas dinner! I did use blue cheese, only because I couldn't find gorgonzola, but I'm sure it would work just great either way. Candied walnuts really added to the flavour.

This is THE most delicious salad I have ever eaten. The candied walnuts are AMAAAAAZING! I used Craisins, fat-free raspberry vinaigrette, and chopped walnuts instead of walnut halves, because I prefer smaller chunks of walnuts. I just had to break it off into little pieces once it cooled (it clumped together into one large piece) - took 10 seconds and it worked wonderfully! And of course, Gorgonzola cheese is my favorite. I wouldn't ever want to substitute it for anything else!

I brought this to a luncheon and it was a hit.  I used "tangy poppyseed dressing" and feta as others suggested.

AWESOME! I have found that blue cheese works just as well as gorgonzola cheese, and that I prefer Kraft raspberry vinagrette instead of the one listed here - not saying that it's bad though! The first couple of times that I made this recipe, I followed it to a T, and it was still a give star recipe! Yum yum!

Oh My Gosh...is this GOOD!!!  I added just a bit of sugar to the vinaigrette mixture and put in some apples but otherwise, it was a total winner!  Plan to make it for "company" next week, it was that good.  I had a similiar salad in a restaurant in Portland, OR, a few years ago and it "wow'ed" me so when I saw this nearly identical recipe, I had to try it.  Will make again and again, I'm sure.  Thanks.

This salad is awesome. I made it yesterday exactly as written, though I did triple the recipe as it was for a large dinner party. Everyone raved about the candied walnuts...they are definitely the star of this salad.  There were no leftovers!

This spring has been very kind to our lettuces and strawberries. Now that we're in the midst of our berry season, I couldn't resist adding strawberries and used an assortment of the lettuces in our garden.  Oh my, life is good!  Thank you for expanding our salad horizons! Great recipe.

This is a very good and simple salad!  I took it to a brunch and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I had never made candied walnuts before.  They were so simple and a definite must!  You definitely do not need all that sugar to candy the walnuts.  I cut the sugar back a bit and they were perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This salad is delicious. We were looking for something different than the same old boring tossed salad. This was a great change. I substituted strawberries because they were cheaper than rasberries. Delicious...

This was very simple and I really liked the combination of flavors.  I made it with pecans, but I'm sure I would like walnuts just as much.  I just used bottled raspberry dressing and added a bit of red onion for zip. I will make this again!

This came out great!! I had to use Blue Cheese instead of Gorgonzola since I could not find it but it came out awesome anyways.

Also, make sure the heat is low or medium before placing the sugar on the skillet. I put the sugar and walnuts on a skillet that was a bit too hot and it just made a smoky mess. The next time I tried it I made sure to turn the heat a lot lower first.

This is awesome and so easy! I buy already candied walnuts or pecans from the store for extra ease and used a couple of different kinds of feta different times. Also I made my own dressing once with cider, olive oil and lemon juice and another time with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, lemon juice and sprinkling of cayenne pepper. I would recommend not drenching it in dressing and making it overly oily as it is super good without too much. I have no idea where to buy raspberry vinergrette?

This salad had a nice variety of different flavors, but I did make several changes.  I added 2 strips of crispy bacon, substituted Italian dressing for the raspberry vinaigrette, oil & vinegar, and low fat feta cheese instead of Gorgonzola.  The candied walnuts are definitely addicting!  My boyfriend even enjoyed this salad, which is rare for him :)

This was a super easy salad and it was delicious. I chickened out using the gorgonzola cheese, but it was still great with feta. The walnuts were very easy to candy, and I'd probably add more next time.

I served this beautiful salad this past weekend for my son's 40th BD party.  It looked lovely, though a tad SWEET.  With the sugared walnuts and cranberries that was expected.  I was proud of my presentation.  I didn't change anything...perhaps maybe a different commercial vinaigrette.

Very good salad.  We used pecans in stead of walnuts, personal preference.  No need for vinegar and olive oil if you like your raspberry vinaigrette.

This salad is awesome-- and I'm not a salad lover. The candied walnuts made it a hit, my family can't get enough. I just used feta cheese instead of Gorgonzola-- still great!

I didn't have walnuts, but used pecans. The nuts weren't getting "candied" fast enough (sugar wasn't dissolving), so I added a little light corn syrup which worked great. I happened upon a dip called "Cranberry Celebration" which is cranberries, pineapple & walnuts sort of gelatinized together, so I plopped little bits of that on and tossed, it was easy and great. My raspberry vinaigrette has walnuts in it, too. My guests cleaned the bowl! Not one leaf was left, it was a huge hit. I'll definitely make this again.

Delicious!  Made as the recipe called except I substituted feta for the Gorgonzola cheese.  The only thing I might tweak next time is the way it calls for glazing the walnuts.  I have used other glazing methods that I like a little better.

I served this salad for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit. I wasn't sure about adding the oil and vinegar in addition to the store bought dressing, but it tasted great. The only changes I made were to use store bought glazed walnuts instead of making them myself and I also used craisins in place of the cranberries. Of the 16 adults at the party all but 2 commented to me how much they enjoyed this salad and the other too nodded in agreement. Even my husband who normally doesn't like "fancy" salads loved it. I will be making this again!

Excellent!  I substituted feta for gorgonzola and it was a great balance with the sweetness from the walnuts and cranberries.  This is my new go-to salad!  Perfect for pot-lucks and special occassions.

I wish I wouldn't have made this salad. Now my hubbie wants it every night. It is delicious! And the walnuts were very easy to make, I have to admit I was afraid they wouldn't turn out, but they come together beautifully.

This is a delicious salad; however I did change a couple things.  Omitted the gorgonzola, personal preference, changed the cranberries to dried cherries and added croutons.  Excellent..always receive tons of compliments on this one!

This was restaurant quality.  I was concerned that I was doing the nuts incorrectly because the sugar was not  turning to a liquid, but sure enough, by 5 minutes it did and the nuts were fabulous, mine were a bit hard so I warned my guests to be careful.  Like another reviewer, I chose to make the Raspberry Vinaigrette dressing from this site, I don't always like bottle vinaigrettes.  You really can do walnuts or pecans (I used pecans) and next time I may try with goat, bleu, or feta cheese.  I did add one pear and I liked the added flavor.  I used this as a side dish to grilled chicken pesto sandwiches but will definitely serve at my next "girlfriends" luncheon with grilled chicken on top for a meal.

This was great - especially the candied walnuts!  I used slightly less gorgonzola (maybe 3/4 of what was suggested) as my husband isn't a fan of it but even he suggested a 5 star rating!  So easy and I loved that the dressing wasn't an excessive amount!

I now use this method every time I candy nuts for my salads... they turn out well every time.
The vinaigrette ratio works out well also!
...all around, this is a great salad recipe.  Thanks for submitting it!

Good recipe, but try substituting pecans for the walnuts (less of a "nutty" flavor and very subtle), use brown rather that white sugar (dark preferred over light brown) and ad a few frsh endives! I add a little goat cheese with the gorgonzola for an added flavor that will typically not overwhelm the gorgonzola and will take a bit of the sweetness from the dressing- great i you're serving this during a 3 or 4 course meal instead of a side.

I have made this for guests, I added in more spinach, less cranberries (I find them too sweet alongside the candied walnuts), some red onions sliced as thinly as humanly possible, and pear chunks, and used blue cheese instead of gorgonzola.  Oh -- and I used bottled balsamic vinagrette as dressing.  So not very similar to the salad here, but based on this idea anyway.  The guests ate every bite!  Thanks for the great recipe, I love how easy it is to candy walnuts.

Followed exactly except for using pecans instead of walnuts. One fellow said it was probably the best salad he has ever eaten.  I used Annie's Raspberry dressing and white wine vinegar.  Once I tried to wing it myself without measuring and it was not a fun eating experience.  This recipe is perfect.  I keep a big batch of sugar roasted pecans on hand at all times which makes this a fast recipe.  It doesn't take long to roast a pound of pecans with sugar and egg whites while I am in the kitchen doing something else and they can be used in many delightful dishes.  A little goes a long ways.

Really delicious!  It's easy and gives salad a nice twist.  Used feta i/o gorgonzola cheese.  Also used store bought raspberry walnut dressing and had it on the side since one of my family doesn't like raspberry dressing.  A keeper!!

This was a very tasty salad that I made for Christmas dinner and my husband actually commented on what a good-looking salad it was. I, too, used pecans (mainly because I had a two pound bag of 'em sitting around; I do like them but I'm sure walnuts would also be delicious) and I just bought a pre-made vinaigrette. As another reviewer stated, I only melted the sugar long enough for it to be glazed and dotted with bumpy sugary bits on them mostly out of laziness...it was taking too long to fully melt. VERY tasty. Had some nuts left over and could not stop popping them into my mouth. My only advice to you would be this: sugar that is in the process of melting is HOT. And it's STICKY. So if a nut flies out of your pan while you're stirring them, RESIST THE URGE to pick it up off the stove and throw it back in the pan. It WILL stick to your finger(s) and BURN them severely. I speak from experience. So please allow me to serve as an example of what not to do. Otherwise, thoroughly delightful.

This was very good! I used spinach instead of mixed greens and raspberry vinegarette dressing. I think I will add some red onions next time to balance out the sweetness.

I was inspired to try this recipe that I had already saved after having a similar salad at a restaurant.  It was my 1st attempt at candied walnuts and both my husband and I were very pleased! I used goat cheese because that's what I wanted and forgot to buy raspberry vinaigrette, so made the dressing from Grilled Chicken Salad with Seasonal Fruit (reduce sugar and oil by 1/2). I added some raspberries as well.  Pears, peaches or blueberries would probably also be good additions. Will make many times again!

This  salad is awesome. It has the right amount of sweet and sour (so to speak for the cheese). I actually make this daily and take it to work. It's healthy, tasty and appealing to the eye.

This salad was awesome!  I was a little hesitant with the dressing ingredients, but once I tasted it, I knew the ingredients complimented each other.  I bought glazed walnuts to save time, used Feta because that is what I had on hand and added a tiny amount of red onion.  Loved this salad and so did my guests.

This is a WONDERFUL salad! Only thing I did different was to use pecans instead of walnuts (just my family's personal preference) & I purchased a raspberry dressing from my farmers market. Wonderful combination od ingredients. Will be making again! I think next time I might try a cheese that isn't quit as strong....just my preference. I made this delicious salad again, but wanted to serve it as the "main dish" and added grilled chicken breast and it made a great meal with some crusty bread to go with it! Thanks for a terrific salad!

Absolutely loved this salad.  I didn't have any raspberry vinagarette, so I used Ken's fat free raspberry pecan dressing.  I've made it with the dried cranberries, and also tried with dried cherries when I ran out of the cranberries, great either way.  Delicious!!

great recipe, for variation, try adding half of a diced gala apple, and feta cheese instead of gorgonzola, you can also add thinly sliced green onion or red onion.  It is SO GOOD that way too!

This salad was absolutely delicious!!!  Instead of dried cranberries (don't like them) I used some fresh chopped pears.  The walnuts was out of this world!!  I broke them apart with a spoon once they cooled.  I will be making this salad again and again.

Perfect.  Much to my chagrin, my wife did not put the full amount of candied walnuts in the salad.  It actually turned out perfectly, even for my sweet tooth.  My first time to candy walnuts and they did not clump together.

This salad is very simple to make and tasted great!  With the addition of a thinly sliced barlett pear, it was a hit!  We used "Old Cape Cod" Light Raspberry Vinagrette.

I trippled the recipe because I was making this for a large group. It seemed like it took a long time for the sugar to melt and walnuts ended up being a bit hard.  Perhaps I had too much for the size of my pan, also I thought it was too much sugar.  This is a good salad and an easy recipe to substitute whatever you like.  I think next time I will cut back on the sugar and use pecans.

This salad is awesome! Like others, I added apple slices. The candied walnuts are the best part! (I did cut down on the sugar though) I loved them so much, I ended up making an extra double batch which I served on top of baked brie with raspberry preserves. Amazing!!

I used a spinach and spring mix combo, which is good.  I agree with a couple other people about the sugar, mine clumped, which was a bit too sugary.  But, my husband (a picky eater) still loved it and the flavor of the walnuts.  I agree with the gorgonzola, I used an import and it became creamy and wasn't clumpy.  Take all of that into consideration, still excellent!!

This is a delicious salad. It makes your house smell heavenly when you brown the nuts and sugar. To save time, I have also used the bottled raspberry dressing and it is also very good.

The hardest part is doing the walnuts in the sugar, and that's easy, actually.  Take your time with it, don't burn it. It only takes 5 mins or so.

USE WHITE SUGAR.  I used brown...it doesn't melt good enough...I had to throw in some white and then it melted better.

I've made this recipe twice.  The first time I used blue cheese because that's what I had on hand.  Tasted good.

Both times it was all eaten and commented upon...how delicious it was.  The second time, a man wanted the recipe to take home to his wife.

This is a tasty and great recipe.  Thx.  Even my husband eats it, and he is a man who doesn't like vegetables in his salad! LOL!  I still laugh at that when he said that!  No vegetables in his salad! LOL!

This salad is a weiner (that's how I say winner).  A company salad....people love it....and you know how hard it is to get people to eat their greens...at least most of the folks I know.

:-)

Love this! I make it with plain, uncandied walnuts just to cut down on some of the sugar. It is delicious and I always get some oohs and aahs when I bring it with me for lunch at work.

This salad is super easy and yet everything goes very well together.  I used Pecans instead of walnuts because I was out of walnuts.  I also added halved grape tomatoes.  As for the dressing I used a white Balsamic Vinaigrette.  Delicious!

Yummy!  Accidentally burnt the walnuts when I was attempting to "candy" so I used pecans and it was very good.

This salad is absolutely wonderful! I doubled it and served it as a Thanksgiving side. It went over quite well and hubby particularly enjoyed it. It's a pretty salad and tastes as good as it looks. Used a 'field greens' salad mix, and used pecans rather than walnuts since our family is a bunch of pecan 'nuts' (no pun intended!). Thanks for the great recipe!

Awsome salad, the candied walnuts were great and even though I had to sub feta for the gorgonzola and also red wine vingear for the raspberry vinagrette it still turned out perfect. I've got to say I am totally in love with this salad.

Very nice salad. Although, I made some major alterations. I added fresh peaches and strawberries in the place of the cranberries. Also, I used goat cheese instead of the Gorgonzola after deciding that the Gorgonzola was too bitter, I strongly suggest using the goat cheese instead. Some members of the family prefer good-old ranch dressing, and it even tastes good with it instead. So, overall, this is a very versatile salad, a very yummy versatile salad! :)

Loved this salad.  Great combination of sweet, salty and cheesy.  However, I used shaved parmesan cause I just don't like gorgonzola or any type of blue cheese for that matter.

Delicious salad, but the only changes I made for myself as I don't use candied walnuts, I just use regular Walnut pieces I crush down to be a little bit smaller. also I'm not a fan of raspberry vinaigrette so I use Italian vinaigrette dressing. Absolutely delicious!

If you want to impress people, make them this salad!  Seriously, I've made this so many times, I've started purchasing the ingredients in bulk when I can.  I top it with "Easy Raspberry Vinaigrette Dressing", also found here on AR (1 TB raspberry jam, 1/4 C white vinegar, 1/3 C olive oil, s&p) - incredible!  I made a huge batch and took it to a potluck at work, and it was GONE IN 60 SECONDS!  Like any salad, it travels well if you add the dressing right before serving.

So delicious.  I made the salad on this 4rth of July and everyone  enjoyed it with compliments.   I used candied pecans and blue cheese and will try the walnuts and gorgonzola the next time.  I added a bit romaine and radicchio for color and  micro  greens with the mixed greens.  Perfect summer salad.  Will def. make it again!!

Excellent go to recipe for a salad.  A couple of notes: (1) caramelize sugar and then candy the walnuts (it create nice taste kick), (2) make your own vinaigrette using fruity vinegar and grape seed oil (less distracting flavor than olive oil); I use aged Sherry vinegar to make home made vinaigrette (shallots, mayo, etc.,) and it comes out perfectly complementing the rest of ingredients.

This is probably the best salad I've ever made and it's so easy!  I like to make a larger batch of the candied walnuts so that I can just make small salads all week and have this for lunch or dinner.

This is a great salad. I did not candy my walnuts as I am not a sweet salad fan, but I did toast them. I skipped the oil and vinegar and just used Rasberry vinaigrette and added grilled steak meat sliced mixed in with cucumber and tomatoes!! Was deliahous!  The Gorgonzola gives it that bite it needs.

I made this salad last night for a dinner party that I hosted. I followed the recipe as written.  It is a very pretty salad and the flavors 
are amazing.  Everyone raved about.  One dinner guest wants to serve it go Christmas dinner.   Healthy and delish!

I made this salad with mixed greens and spinach leaves.  I added sweetened dried cranberries, diced pears, halved red grapes, almost 1 cup gorgonzola, the dressing (which I found to be perfect), and freshly ground pepper. I chose to candy pecans because I don't really like the flavor of walnuts...this turned out so very awesome!!

I'm rating this for the candied nuts.  I made them and put them in a dish on the Easter dinner table.  Awesome!  Crunchy and sweet.  One walnut  flipped out of the pan while I was stirring, and when I picked it up to put it back in the pan, I cooked a blister onto my thumb.  Don't touch hot walnuts!  I will make these again for Christmas.

Amazing salad! I used goat cheese instead just beacause I already had some on hand. My husband asks for this salad frequently now.  I am still trying to master the walnuts though.

This recipe has been a life savor for me for entertaining and just to serve for my family. My picky husband who normally hates salads...much less fruit in his salad loves this. I cut up a Bosc pear insead of the dried cranberries and omit the oil. People always have seconds or thirds so get enough lettuce.

I make this salad all the time and it is my favorite. It makes a great dinner entre by adding chicken I also like to add granny smith apples. I have found that the best dressing for this salad is the rasberry, walnut, gorgonzola dressing from trader joes it makes it taste amazing. For the greens I buy a salad mix from fresh n' easy that has chives and cilantro and all tipes of refreshing herbs that really add an amzing refreshing taste to the salad.

I absolutely love this salad.  You could use so many ingredients in place or along with the ones mentioned.  I'm hoping to find candied nuts at the store next time as mine usually turn out clumped together.  I can break most of them up but I'd rather skip that whole step altogether :)

This salad was really simple to make. Not a ton of ingredients which I really appreciate. I did not care for the gorgonzola cheese and next time will substitute with feta. Also, I added pears like in the picture and it was delicious. Thank you MrsPorkChop for the great recipe!

This was a very easy and tasteful salad.  I used 1/2 light brown sugar & 1/2 white sugar.  I have never candied nuts before and was worried that it wouldn't turn out but it came together nicely.  Next time I will use pecans instead.  I also used a premade Raspberry Vinaigrette with Poppy seeds from the grocery store.  Thanks!

Very good recipe.  I substituted pecans for the walnuts.  My wife insists on this at least once a month.  I make the recipe for four and she has it for four straight days.

This salad is great.  I've usually bought candied nuts to put into my salads before, but this is the first time I've made them - I never knew it was so easy!  I used pecans instead of walnuts, as I like them better.  Everyone loves this salad!

YUM, YUM, YUM!  I changed this recipe as follows:  used crumbled blue cheese, did not use white vinegar or olive oil, just served with raspberry vinaigrette.  Made this for a Christmas meal: VERY FESTIVE with red/green!

This salad was delicious.  I used bleu cheese crumbles since they didn't have the gorgonzola at the store and spinach.  I also ending up buying the raspberry vinaigrette because it would have cost more to make it! Will be making it again.

This salad is great!  I add Granny Smith apples cut into small chunks and thin slivers around the top to decorate.  I also use half gorgonzola and half blue cheese, and use italian vinaigrette - leaving out the extra oil and vinegar in this recipe.  This salad is my favorite!!!

I don't know what I did wrong, but I'll try it again since you've gotten 5 stars from most members.  It must taste very good and sure sounds like it does.  Thanks for letting me see you recipe.

I thought this was good, just not WOW quality.  I used Ken's Steakhouse Raspberry Walnut dressing, and as others mentioned, I think there was too much sugar which resulted in some of the crystals sticking together (almost like rock candy) which made for some VERY crunchy bits in the salad.  I probably won't make it again, but that's because I think I like spicier salads (i.e. Italian and caesar).  Thanks for sharing how to candy nuts though!

I made this exactly as written for lunch for myself and 2 co-workers.  It received 3 standing ovations!  It was great!  Will definitely be making again.  It goes together in 5 minutes, outside of sugaring the walnuts, which could be done the day before if necessary.  Would also be good with some grilled chicken added.  Way to go, Missy!

I love this salad!  I have made it for two family holidays now.  The one thing I change - I don't like sweet salad dressings, so I just use olive oil and a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Play around with different vinegars if that is your choice - I would think champagne vinegar would be very good with this.

I think this is a great salad.  I buy one carton of organic salad greens and use the whole thing with the dressing.  This salad is gone quickly!

I loved this salad! A great meal on it's own or to bring to a party. It does go bad quick-must be eaten the next day-and doesn't taste as good. I added turkey bacon once-it took it to the next level.

So good! The only change I made was to replace the white vinegar with more raspberry vinagirette, oh and I added chopped apples.

I made this to go with dinner I made for the husband's boss and everyone loved the salad and had even larger seconds. Very good combo with the candied nuts, cheese and cranberries. My husband even had me make it again to go with our leftovers.

A wonderful combination of flavors.  Very elegant presentation, too.  But I wished that I'd not used the light (Newman's) dressing for this.  Next time, I'll use the regular type.
