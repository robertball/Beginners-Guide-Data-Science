Oh, did hubby and I enjoy this! Simple, fresh and light, this really hit the spot. I had a medley of bell peppers on hand, so I used a mixture of orange, red, yellow and green peppers which really lent the dish a lot of color. No need to measure ingredients exactly, just add or subtract to suit your own taste. Also, in keeping with the fresh flavors I was after in this dish, I opted to use fresh, chopped tomatoes rather than canned.  Simply beautiful dish with a delicious blend of flavors.

Great base recipe. Gave it 4 stars due to some tweaking.... the recipe doesn't state when to add the tomoatoes - not a big deal just throw them in when you add your peppers.

Tripled the garlic (personal preference), doubled the tomatoes and the wine. the result was a nice light, healthy meal.

Thanks!

Geez. Am I ever having a clunker of a day in the kitchen. Breakfast was a flop and dinner was too. I guess I'm just making poor recipe choices today.... While the taste of this was allright (nothing special, but edible), it was the texture that snubbed me. The broth / wine mixture, when combined with a thickener and then added to warm ingredients, made for a wierd "gooey" sauce. I have no aversion to creamy sauces, but broth / wine are an odd pairing for a pasta sauce. Perhaps I had my burner set too high???? Also, as this recipe implies, I was expecting an Italian stir-fry meal. I should have known better.... Sauteeing veggies for 5 minutes and then simmering for another 10 minutes will undoubtedly turn them to mush (especially onions). I think this would have been MUCH better if my veggies were crisp-tender (like a traditional stir-fry should be). Served with Italian bread, this was an "OK" meal. My hubby liked this a bit more than I did, so I guess it wasn't a complete loss lol! Anywhoo, I hope this will float your boat cause it sure didn't mine :( Thanks anyways, JBLUVS2COOK!

DH tried this tonight, and it turned out pretty good, except he thought white wine & white wine vinegar were interchangeable.  Actually was edible, if a little vinegar-ish.  Gave it 4 stars because even with the vinegar it wasn't bad.  Want to try it with the wine.

Wow! This recipe was delicious!! I marinated the chicken in italian dressing for an hour. I added mushrooms, omitted the green pepper & used a whole red pepper. I used 1/2 a red onion & for the tomatoes I used 'Rotel' canned tomatoes & chiles. I didn't have wine, so I used a little white vinegar(2 tablespoons). With this recipe, you can add more or omit ingredients to suit your personal preference.  There was so much flavor, my husband & I loved it.

Great recipe! I was looking for a chicken/pasta dish but I didn’t want anything too creamy and heavy full of calories. This was perfect because it’s light, all the ingredients blend well and it has lots of flavors. I didn’t have any bell peppers on hand, so I only used tomatoes. I think mushrooms would go really well too. Also, I used fresh basil instead of dried, this was a really nice addition to this dish.

3 stars, just for the "Italian stir-fry" description and the soggy veggies. Tastes a bit bland but I'm fine/neutral with it. You can always customize the spices to suit your taste a few minutes before cooking is finished. No big deal there.

Third time, double garlic, added 1 tsp thyme on top of oregano and basil, 1 minced green chili pepper and stir-fried the bell peppers and onions (and leftover asparagus heads while I was there...) a few minutes before ready to eat, so they were nice and crisp. Made sauce without pasta/veggies a few hours before and it thickened nicely, started pasta when ready to start dinner, started stir-frying the veggies right after that, heated sauce, mixed all just before serving and voila. Nice and crisp veggies, al dente pasta with a juicy sauce, topped with Peccorino cheese shavings.

Easy, I typically have all the ingredients on hand. My daughter and my husband really liked it. Only changes I made were to coat the chicken with flour prior to browning, adding some halved, sliced summer squash because I had it, and added some red pepper flakes.

When I made this, I doubled the recipe so that I could have enough for 6 people.  Everyone had their fill, and there's still about half leftover.  It's pretty filling.  Also, and this is just personal preference, I would try to make this a bit thicker with maybe a bit more cornstarch and more tomatoes.  Lastly, parmesan cheese (lots of it) is a must.

I made this dish for my family and it was a success! My hubby said to add it to our "normal meals". The only thing I would change next time is to drain the juices from the chicken before adding the bell peppers and onion. (This was probably my mistake anyway) The sauce was a little runnier than I'd hoped but was still delicious! Again, probably due to not draining the meat. I like the idea of adding wine to the sauce. Next time I am going to try it with a little less chicken broth and a little more wine. Other that that it was fantastic and my entire family enjoyed it!

A side note-I have added crushed red pepper flakes(about a tsp-more if you like really spicy)after chicken broth mixture has been added so that it can cook into the mixture.  I don't add salt as part of the recipe because it's too personal.

This was ok.  I tried to take the advice of others and added a bit of crushed red pepper but it still tasted bland.  It is a simple recipe that I would recommend to someone just starting off, but other than that I wouldn't make this recipe again.

Didn't add the wine since I didn't have any on hand. Did add some red pepper flakes to taste. Pretty good.

obviously i'm in the minority as well, but i thought this was a really strange dish.  it took more cornstarch than called for to get the sauce to thicken,- and the resulting clear-ish yet thick sauce was thoroughly unappetizing looking.  the taste was okay (hence the three stars) and i like the concept of an italian stir-fry- but i won't be making this again without using a different sauce entirely.

This turned out soooo good for me!  I made some changes though.  I used half of a green & yellow pepper and then added two red chili peppers (sliced).  The color combination this created was really nice and the chili peppers added a bit of zip to this dish without being too spicy once cooked.  I also added salsa instead of canned tomatoes, which really gave the sauce nice color.  I didn't have oregano and basil separately so I added two teaspoons of italian seasoning. The consistency of the sauce was so perfect. It coated the penne so nicely and the flavor was really good!  My husband who isn't a big eater went back for seconds!  I think this was company worthy and I will definitely be making this again!

Easy and filling meal! My family loved it. I will definitely make again. It was a little bland but with a few tweaks it worked well for my family. I doubled the pasta amount, added another TB of cornstarch and a little over 1/4 tsp of red pepper flakes. I also didn't have bell peppers on hand so I sautéed the onions and added another tsp of minced garlic. I also breaded the chicken with bisquick, salt and pepper prior to cooking. It made about 8-9 cups of warm goodness with a hefty amount of parmesan cheese over each portion. The only changes I might make for future variations is to add other tender vegetables,  olives and mushrooms. Reading other people's reviews were very helpful in creating a successful meal for my family!

This was a hit.  A classic that you can make while chatting it up in the kitchen.  Some quartered baby poratabellas where added with the diced tomatoes.  The family is already asking for this again.

This was very good for a romantic meal. I let this simmer in the wine sauce for a bit longer than the recipe called for. This gave more of a marinated taste. All-in-all this recipe was better than the chicken penne that I've had in nicer restaurants. 5-stars!

The flavor of this dish is okay, albeit a tad on the bland side. It is extremely watery, as the corstarch really doesn't thicken it up to bind to the other ingredients. As a result, it doesn't keep very well, as the watery juices soak into and break apart the penne pasta.

Very easy to make and quite tasty.  I added an extra tablespoon of garlic and an extra 1/4c of white wine.  In the end, I had to add more salt, but overall I thought this was a very light, tasty dish that the whole family enjoyed.

I made this last night for my wife and we liked it except that next time we will not put the penne into the dish.  Rather, we will just put it over top of the pasta at the end.  It made the noodles too soft, even with them being cooked to al dente.  I also added an extra can of tomatoes and added 8 ounces of sliced mushrooms to bulk up the veggies.  But we had enough for several meals.  We will make it again.

Very bland for my tastes.  Ended up adding some salt, red pepper flakes, fresh basil, and a couple tablespoons of tomato paste.  It was fine, but I probably wont make again.

There was way too much sauce for the noodles and chicken.  Besides that, there's nothing very special or flavorful about this dish, although it wasn't that hard to make.  I don't think I'll be coming back to this one.

The sauce was very flavorful. I think l will add mushrooms and zucchini the next I make it.  I followed the recipe with the exception of the bell peppers. I used mini sweet peppers instead.

My fairly picky kids gave it a thumbs up so I have a new meal to add to the rotation.  I didn't have peppers so I made it without.  I cut back on the liquid, there was a bit too much, and I put in more oregano, etc.  I put some fresh mozzarella cubes on top with the shredded Parmesan.

It definitely does not look like the picture shown.  It is very good.  You need to let sit for a little bit so that the noodles soak up the sauce.

Definitely needed more of all herbs/spices and the addition of salt, black pepper and red pepper flakes.  Even with the flavor adjustments, I wouldn't make it again.

I followed this according to the directions except:  didn't have white wine, so didn't use it.  Also I didn't measure the spices, just shook them in.  It was delicious, made plenty, and was great the next day, too.

The recipe was nice but a little bland.  In fairness I made changes without making it as is the first time.  I had no tomatoes but used fresh asparagus and used more garlic and doubled the sauce.

I tried this recipe as posted, but added 2 TBS corn starch and it thickened up nicely, was glossy and clung to the pasta. I also added spinach which was good. However, next time I will make it with italian sausage and omit the oregano.

I really wanted to like this recipe, and I can see I'm in the minority, but I just don't see what makes it so good.  I found it be really bland, and the sauce doesn't thicken, even with the corn starch, so it doesn't bind to the penne noodles.  It looks pretty and smells good but I think it fell flat.

I followed the recipe as is, but used dehydrated onion and pepper. This was good but i'd probably go a bit heavier on the spices, garlic and onion next time. It was very quick and easy and with a few of my own tweaks next time, i think it will come out better. I'll keep this handy for nights i need something quick.

A nice, fresh chicken dinner. I added the onions and peppers at the beginning with the chicken and garlic, but only because I like nice soft veggies. I used green chili tomatoes for some spice, and actually skipped the cheese on top ( I didn't think I'd miss it). Thanks very much for sharing, I'll definitely be making this again :)

Tasty. Fairly easy to cook.  I'd reduce volume of chicken next time it made a lot of extra meat when compared to pasta serving.  Excellent sides (from allrecipes) I used were Basil Buttered Bread and Tomato Gorgonzola Soup.

My changes were 1 cup fresh halved grape tomatoes instead of canned, about 4 cloves of garlic, 1 cup of sliced baby-bella mushrooms added with the tomatoes, and only 1 cup of the broth. 
Incredibly easy to make - tastes great, and looks nice on the plate. 
Thanks Jeanine!!!

I made this and my husband LOVED IT! Even though he's tired of pasta, he said it was amazing! I didn't use the peppers or tomatoes because he won't eat them, and I used at least twice the amount of basil. We will definitely be making this more often!

Doesn't need the chicken broth or corn starch. Not much to see here, it was good but not that good. Of course I had to add salt.

This was excellent! My family and I all thought it was great, including my 3-y-o granddaughter. The only thing I did differently was waited to put the garlic in until the onions and peppers were almost done, add about a tsp. of sugar along with the tomatoes (I was always taught to do that by my Italian grandma), a little dried parsley with the oregano and basil, and substituted a little vinegar and lemon juice for the wine(about a tsp. or so of each), as I didn't have any on hand. This will be a regular for sure. Thank you!

This made for a great delicious meal.  I went by the recipe but changed the directions a bit.  I added the garlic at the end of sauteing, right before adding the liquid, because I didn't want it to burn.  Also before adding in the chicken broth, I added in the wine first to reduce down with the tomatoes, it gives so much more flavor that way.  I also didn't saute as long as it says in the directions, because it will overcook your chicken and make for too soft of vegetables.  I may add in some chile flakes next time for a little kick.  Lastly, don't skimp on a good quality freshly grated parmesan cheese.   The freshly grated parmesan cheese over top, will make the dish stand out.  Thank you for the recipe!  I will have to make again sometime and will serve with a nice crusty bread and a salad.

very tasty, I've made this a couple times and I keep experimenting. It's not too heavy, but with the garlic salt, italian seasoning I added, it was very tasty. I wasn't too stingy with the parmesan either....  ;-)

This was a very easy meal to make and it tastes delicious. I experimented somewhat by adding some figs to the dish. What a treat to my palette when I got a slight sweet sensation. I will add more figs next time.

It was delicious. I ended up using fresh cherry tomatoes instead of canned and added bell peppers. It was quick too which was perfect since I just got home from work.

Really tasty and easy!  I used the grilled chicken breasts from Costco chopped up and 1 full red bell pepper instead of green and red, no wine because I didn't have any, otherwise just as written.  Goes together quickly - will definitely make again and again!  Thank you for sharing!!

Love the recipe. I did use the Rotel diced tomatoes with chilies peppers instead of plain diced tomatoes. It gave the recipe a nice spiciness . Loved it. I would definitely make it again.

I made this recipe this evening for dinner.  As I rarely rate the recipes from this site, this recipe was plain, fast and simple. It was a watery soupy texture, I did not add white wine as I really couldn't see the point.  The seasonings had no impact at all. I won't make this again. If you want flavorful recipes, and you love to cook, this one isn't for you.  I have made meals in 45 minutes for start to finish for my family when working full time, and I would never have put this on my table.
My husband didn't "mind" it.

The chicken wasn't really stir fried in the end- nor were the veggies;  the tomatoe simmer sort of simmered them to death.  I would do this differently next time.
The noodles sucked up too much of the juices.
I just don't think the proportions are right.

I added fresh baby spinach, fresh mushrooms and instead of diced tomatoes I used 1 can hot rotelle and 1 can regular rotelle tomatoes. Seasoned chicken with season salt, garlic powder and pepper. Added more chicken broth and a little corn starch for thicking. My husband said it's a keeper!  He loved it.

I found it lacking in flavor. If I made it again, I would definitely add some red pepper flakes to pump it up, but I'd also like something to give it some depth.

Very light and refreshing entree.  I substituted zucchini for the peppers.  I seasoned the chicken with sea salt and pepper and used more dry basil and oregano and garlic than recommended.  Definitely a dish my family enjoyed that I'll make again.

Made this yesterday.  Like another follower, I found this to be extremely thin n bland. I had already dbl’d down  on cornstarch.  This helped thickness.  The canned tomatoes saved the day.  Had no peppers in-house but I used Italian Style with red n green pepper in them.   Also added a sm can of tomato paste n perfection!

The bones of this dish were here, just needed a little tweaking.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Will be making again

I recommend adding more cornstarch and flour if you want to thicken the sauce. I didn't have cooking wine so I excluded it. In addition, I added shredded mozzarella cheese on top of each serving. Delicious!!!

Well my husband and two very picky children are loving this! I used vodka instead of white wine and fresh tomatoes instead of canned, minus the green peppers but otherwise followed it pretty closely and I think it's safe to say this is something I will make again!

It was decent. I used seasoned breaded chicken filets and added zucchini which went well with the tomatoes, onions and peppers. . I would absolutely OMIT the cornstarch. It's unnecessary and it gave it a weird powdery taste. I'll probably try it one more time using fresh chicken and without the cornstarch.

I always cut the pasta in half in recipes and never regret it. This was great. I used frozen veggies. It would be good with spinach or mushrooms added.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  Need to season the chicken as it was a bit bland but the sauce was great with the white wine and chicken broth.  Besides the dried oregano and basil, I added fresh oregano and basil on top of the dish when serving along with the Parmesan cheese.  The sauce was the best part so I served the dish in soup bowls and it was great as it permeated the penne.

I am a very big fan of stir fry and a huge fan of pasta. I onlyused a very small amount of white wine and a generous amount of Ground black pepper. 

Very tasty - kudos to Jeanine Farrar Bubick for submitt9ing the recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as directed. It was very bland and watery.  To save it I had to add a bit of salt some pepper and more garlic. And most importantly, simmer off all the liquid, It's good as a base but it needs more seasoning! I also melted the cheese into the pasta instead of topting it.

This was good but not as good as I hoped. I think there was too much pasta for me. Next time I will reduce the pasta a bit. Thanks Jeanine -I love your name, the same as my daughter's.

The flavors here are nice but it's a very...wet...recipe, and I ended up serving it in a bowl. Next time I will reduce the broth/wine amounts. I'm sorry I didn't have fresh Italian bread to have with it. Husband loved it and at the end tipped the bowl and drank it.

This is Michael, Linda's hubby.  I do the cooking.  This was great!  I made NO changes at all, strictly per recipe and that is rare for me.  I had everything on hand.  I did only use 1 big chicken breast, the combo was perfect as I love pasta more than the chicken.

This was superb! I'm giving it 5 stars even though I made a slight modification. I added a little Lowery salt when cooking the chicken. Once I had all the ingredients in there I felt like it was a bit too soupy so I added heavy cream. That made a huge difference! I didn't use the tomatoes bc I didn't want to use canned and was out of fresh. But I loved the orange pepper. The sweet taste really added to the overall flavor. I'm going to try it again with other veggies, maybe also add an artichoke. Great recipe and so very easy!

I thought I had diced canned tomatoes but instead it was diced tomatoes in tomato sauce. I used that and actually turned out quite well - no issue with the sauce not being think enough nor tomato looking. Otherwise I followed the recipe. Definitely make it again. Perhaps others may use diced tomatoes and a can of tomato paste if you want the same results and cant find diced tomatoes in sauce.

I love it and yes I made a couple of changes.  I didn't add any peppers.  I didn't have the cornstarch either.  So I added a half can of Cream of Chicken and Mushroom soup to my broth. I added mushrooms and oregano and basil and plenty of garlic.
I didn't have penne pasta so I used shell noodles. I didn't have the wine.  I'm sure that would have added a nice boost to it.   It turned out great. My BF is on his third plate of it.  Guess we won't have any leftovers.  It was very easy to make.

It ended up being a little too saucy. I did add fresh basil, salt and pepper. I found that the salt really brought out the flavor. Next time, I will drain the tomatoes before adding them. It was good, but it could be better. I was thinking that sun-dried tomatoes may make this dish. Good luck, and enjoy!

This is pretty good. As I was cooking it, I was a little skeptical, because the sauce is pretty thin. It thickened up a little bit after simmering, but it's still pretty light. I actually doubled the recipe, keeping the chicken amount the same, and it worked out well. I also added a little tomato sauce since I added more vegetables and pasta. Turned out very well and I actually like the light taste. Thanks!

I make something similar to this recipe. although instead of adding the cornstarch/ chicken broth mixture, i skip that step. after the chicken/veggies & pasta are ready to be mixed together, add a few tablespoons of olive oil along with some fresh cracked pepper & crushed red pepper flakes to taste. can even add (1tsp) balsalmic vinegar if looking for a stronger flavor

This is a pretty easy meal to make. It is a little bland but still good. I made it when Mike had a bleeding ulcer so it was good that it was bland at that time. Next time i make it i will probably add something more flavorful to the recipe i just dont know what yet. Also i made it without the white wine.

It tasted good, albeit a little bland. After a few taste tests I ended up adding quite a bit more seasoning and it still didn't pop. Think it might be good as a cold dish. Did not refrigerate well. Leftovers the next day, even to my 'eat just about anything' boyfriend, did not taste good.

This recipe exceeded my expectations.  I thought it might be a little bland, but it's truly not.  What a great mix of flavors, and a great way to get veggies in there.  Even my vegetable hating boyfriend happily ate this.  I followed the recipe almost exactly...added a little bit more garlic, and reduced the white wine by half (boyfriend's preference).  Thanks for the great recipe, this will definitely go into the dinner rotation and I'm saving the leftovers from tonight for lunch tomorrow.  EDIT: I just made this for the fourth or fifth time and I used yellow peppers instead of the red peppers, because I happened to have a yellow one...I would definitely recommend this for presentation purposes; there is already red in the dish from the diced tomatoes so the yellow peppers are a great color addition to that and the green peppers.

This was good, quick healthy food for a weeknight.  I didn't have the parmesan cheese so I cut half a pound of part skim fresh mozzerella cheese and added cubes to the pasta before serving.  It was really tasty!

I followed the directions to a T. It was good but not great. I would cook it again.

I added carrots, but I liked this and it was easy besides.  I also always season meat while I'm cooking it so I salt and pepper the chicken while cooking.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  We tried it with the crushed red pepper and the kick of spice was just perfect.  I will definitely be making this again.

I thought this was a great recipe.
My 12 year old daughter made it for dinner and we all really liked it.

Very good.  Add salt and pepper to chicken prior to cooking.  Used veggies from our farm.  Great dish!
