This was my second recipe tried in a quest for an excellent clam dip.  Unfortunately, the clam taste never made it through the parmesan cheese.  Some folks will love this dip if they like parmesan cheese.

Excellent!! Just made a few changes. Used fresh garlic and real butter. And used crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs. Thanks for a great recipe.

Was pretty disappointed in this recipe, I used more than the recipe called for of freshly grated parmesan, and neither the taste of clams or parmesan came thru, I think it calls for too much lemon juice & bread crumbs 'cause that's all I tasted...The dog enjoyed it tho!

LOVED this!!! I crushed up fresh garlic cloves and sauted then added other ingrediants, and I also added american cheese to the top when it was nearly through cooking.  Perfect recipe - not too clammy - People that HATE seafood were going crazy over this dip
