This recipe was delicious.  My family felt the blueberries were a little too tart, so I mixed sugar directly with the blueberries the next time I made it.  It's a keeper!

A variation of "Blueberry Buckle" only in that it does not include salt - it should, ¼ or ½ tsp., and does include a teaspoon of lemon peel – it shouldn’t, it’s distracting. Oh, and this variation includes nuts in the topping, which I omitted.  This cake is moist and very good, but in my view, the genuine Blueberry Buckle recipes on this site are far better, especially because they don’t include the lemon peel, which I could smell even as I was cutting the cake.  If you do think you’d like to include it, I’d reduce the amount to half of what is called for in the recipe.

I only made two small changes--I added a half teaspoon of salt to the batter and I used the last bit of pecans I had to the topping instead of using walnuts as we do not like walnuts. I baked this in my cast iron skillet. We absolutely loved this breakfast cake. Out of the whole skillet, two pieces remain and I doubt those will make it to the end of the day.

Pretty good.  It only needed a little tweaking.  I would definitely add salt next time (maybe only 1/4 teas.).  I did add a heaping TBS of sour cream to the batter and it came out really moist.  It could have been a little sweeter for me.  I would probably toss the berries in a little sugar next time and that problem should be solved.  I was short on blueberries so added a few blackberries and it was delish.

We really enjoyed this. I did add 1/4 tsp. salt with the dry ingredients. Very tasty for breakfast or a snack.

Delicious! I did make a few changes. I used half whole wheat flour and added 1/2 teaspoon salt. I also decided to use "buttermilk" instead of regular milk. I combined 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda with 3/4 cup milk and let sit about 5 minutes to sour. (If you sub buttermilk or soured milk, you'll definitely want to use 3/4 cup, as it's much thicker than milk.) The result is a moist, light, amazing breakfast cake. I made two and we're having one for dessert and will have one for breakfast tomorrow. Thank you for the great recipe!

I used almond milk instead of regular milk and added in a little extra lemon extract and some salt as others had suggested.  I think next time I will try it with butter milk and maybe use 1/2 a cu instead of 1/4 as the batter was extremely dense.  I also tossed the blueberries in a little bit of flour before adding to the batter so they don't all sink to the bottom during baking.

This result was a bit dry for me, & the batter needs just a pinch of salt.

Much like a blueberry buckle, which is one of my favorite desserts.  I followed the recipe, but used a springform pan for easier serving.  I also made a vanilla glaze and just did a light drizzle.  The topping is so good, and I like the addition of the walnuts.  Definitely add in the lemon zest, it's the perfect addition.

Our family loved this recipe. I used sliced almonds in the topping and they toasted up and added a nice crunch to it.  Recommend this one!!!

This recipe was really good...Well, with a couple of modifications. I doubled the amount of lemon peel and I made it into cupcakes. I did not sprinkle sugar on top. I baked them at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. I then let them cool and put a thin icing glaze on top. They are great for school and work lunches.

I made bakery size muffins with this recipe using fresh blueberries, and did not change a thing.  My family now asks for these almost every weekend.

Very good cake.  I forgot the salt (no big deal) and tossed the slightly wet berries into some flour/sugar mixture to keep them from sinking.  Added 1 Tbsp. fat free sour cream.   Used pecans and orange zest instead of walnuts and lemon zest. It was moist and tasty.  Might use a bit more sugar in the batter or more crumb topping next time.  Not overly sweet - although that's not a bad thing.  Very tasty!  Will make again.

Very good cake. Be careful the topping gets soggy if you leave it in aluminum foil if its still warm. Wait until it's totally cool before wrapping in aluminum foil. 

I added 1/2tsp salt to mine. Next time I would try sweetening the berries (like soaking them in sugar water overnight) because they were a little sour. Good recipe overall will make again.

My batter was very very thick.  I thought I did something wrong but baked it anyway.  Turned out good. I will make this again.

I forgot where I originally found my recipe for blueberry breakfast cake. I tried making it again for my family this morning, used this recipe and discovered it was NOT the right one. This produced a dough, akin to dry scone dough. Worse actually, as I had to add an additional 3/4 c. of milk in order to even drag a spatula through it. When you are making a breakfast CAKE the dough should come out as only slightly thicker than a regular cake better.

This recipe makes a nice blueberry coffee cake.   I made the recipe exactly as written but I would add a little salt the next time to enhance the flavors.  It’s an enjoyable breakfast cake.

This was exactly what I was craving!  Left out the lemon and walnuts, added a 1/2 teaspoon of salt and used turbinado sugar for the topping to give it extra crunch.  Mmmmm.... thanks!

I made this for a Saturday morning treat with fresh blueberries. I incorporated the suggestions of 1/4 tsp. salt, 1 heaping TBSP of sour cream, and tossing the blueberries in sugar. It turned out fantastic and I will definately make this one again and again.

For my family's taste, this recipe needs much more sugar to balance out the tartness of the blueberries.  It is scarcely sweet at all.
