Mmmmmm and super easy to make!  I did cut the butter down to a 1/4 cup and after I stirred the pasta into the sauce it thickened up quite a bit.  Next time I might add another 1/4 cup of milk to the sauce to help thin it up a bit.  Overall it had a wonderful flavor for being so simple and so few ingredients, it is very similar to an alfredo sauce.  The hubby and kids loved it and gobbled it all up.  Try sprinkling the top with some fresh parsley to brighten the flavor a bit and give it a little color.  This is a keeper for our family!

I add chicked and portabella mushrooms to mine.  I grill the chicken first and sautee the mushrooms with the garlic.  I have gotten rave reviews.  Also, I drain the bacon grease into a cup and add it as I think I need it.  It keeps it from being too greasy, esp. if you use bacon that is a little on the fatty side.

We've been taste testing carbonara recipes, but have stopped now because we LOVE this one.  Although not a traditional carbonara with eggs, it's delicious.  The changes we made to be sure it was perfect are: 1# penne pasta, 12 ounces bacon (reserving 1/3 cup drippings), and 1-1/2 cups petite peas.

Very good, I added chicken to mine and next time I think I will add a veggie as well. My only complaint is that I thought it was a little greasy, I may drain more of the bacon grease next time. Overall, I really enjoyed this, and my family did too!

Used 1/4 c butter, 1/2 bar of the reduced fat cream cheese, used 6 strips of turkey bacon, 1/4 c Parmesan cheese and 1% milk. Serve with Tyson chicken strips. Sauce makes 9 - 1 1/4 c servings at 104 calories. Chicken is 100 cal per strip = 204 + noodles. Very yummy! Hubby said it was restaurant quality. My 5 yo and 8 yo both loved it! Yay!

This is the best recipe.  Not only is it easy, but I always have these ingredients on hand.  I would recommend this to everyone.  I add mushrooms, broccoli and other veggies.  Chicken goes well also.

This recipe was very easy to make and my husband LOVED it.  I love pasta and I thought it would be tasty with the cream cheese, but I didn't care for it and my kids wouldn't eat it (they are big pasta eaters usually too).  I will make it again for my husband sometime since he ended up eating all of it, including all the leftovers.

This was very good pasta!  I used herb and garlic cream cheese, and this combined with the bacon flavour was very tasty.  I have tried cream cheese pasta sauces before without being too happy with the flavour, but the cream cheese flavour was NOT overpowering in this recipe.  I used penne pasta, and the sauce coated nicely.  Next time, I think I will try seasoned chicken in place of the bacon.  Yum!

Very tasty. Very easy. Easy to modify.  Add veggies, meats, alternate cheeses other than the Parmesan. Handy recipe to know.

i made this with al dente linguine, 5 pcs thick cut bacon, 1/4 cream cheese, 3/4 c frozen peas,  2 t minced garlic, 3/4 c heavy cream, 2 T butter, 3 T minced maui onion and black pepper with grana padano parmesan sprinkled generously in and over the pasta dish.  i found it thick and pasty but this was my fault, i wanted the sauce to be much thicker than the recipe seemed to call for, and i did use a whole carton of pasta.  i am going to have a second serving and try to thin it with additional milk and butter.  for me, the peas make this dish, the sweetness of the peas and onions goes well with the richness of the sauce. just need a small glass of wine now.  this is super fast and easy, much easier than bolognese sauce, even and the flavor was far superior to what i expected with the omission of the eggs.  this one's a keeper.

My family loved this! I did drain the bacon grease and didn't have any problems with it being too greasy. Chicken and broccoli or asparagus would be good additions.

Maybe it is just my family's taste buds- but I thought the recipe was bland and a little to greasy as I followed it exactly.

Amazing! I made this sauce as is and it was great. Last minute aftter muliple ah hem...taste testing lol I added one can of chopped mushrooms. A great sauce to try and then add on to. For everryone that said this was bland well your supposed to spice it up to your liking. I think i added way more garlic than called for but thats just me other than that this is a must try! There are so many possibilities with this sauce!

Super easy to make and you almost have everything you need at any time.  I whipped this up and was amazed at how delicious it was.  It's not a traditional carbonara, but it tasted great and was so simple.  You can spice this up with anything from chicken to sun-dried tomatoes, pesto or some veggies.

Very good and easy.  The whole family loved it.  I did put some cut up chicken tenders in when I cooked the bacon.  Also I cooked the bacon, chicken and garlic all together because I forgot and put them all in together.

This was the first time I've made my own sauce for pasta, and I absolutely LOVE this recipe. Even my boyfriend loved it! I put some lighty pan fried chicken in there with a little bit of garlic seasoning and some seasoned salt on it and the chicken really complimented the sauce. I think next time I will put broccoli in with the garlic and saute them together. I think it would be great in this dish! However, we did realize that it was VERY filling and we had enough left overs for at least three more servings! But my boyfriend didn't complain! =]

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner and my family complemented me on the sauce.  I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic (I did not realize I was out of garlic!); half and half instead of milk; and added white pepper, salt, nutmeg as well as more parmesan cheese than recipe called for as my family and I LOVE cheese.  This is a good recipe!  I know I will make variations of this over time.

Delicious. I tripled the recipe, only added an extra clove of garlic and reduced butter by 1/2 cup, used thick sliced bacon so removed a lot of grease. Looked lovely when I put the finished recipe in my crock pot set on low and took to a potluck. But when served an hour and a half later it didn't look creamy, looked like tiny pieces of cream cheese, but still tasted delicious. Will serve immediately next time.

Really good!  Used turkey bacon instead, because that's what I had in the house.  The only thing I added was, I added about 5 fresh basil leaves (chopped) because I had some on hand and wanted to use them before they went bad.  Also added 1 chopped green onion.  Only gave it 4 stars as my oldest daughter was "iffy" on if she liked it, but my youngest daughter and I really liked it!

Fantastic, and restaurant quality! I took some of the suggestions of cutting the butter and cheese (to reduce salt and fat). I also dabbed a bit of the bacon drippings out with a paper towel. It came out perfect! 

This turned out super-filling and absolutely delicious. We also added grilled chicken to make it a complete meal!

And in recent versions I've added peas and broccoli to make it even more outstanding!

Way too cream cheese-y, if I were to make this again I'd probably only use half the amount. It also needs some mushrooms and veggies of some sort.

Pretty high cal and not worth it. Added sauteed mushrooms, garlic and roasted asparagus, cut back on the butter but just wasn't anything spectacular.

Very good. My husband, who is not fond of rue based white sauces, thought this was great. I did pour off all but a tablespoon of grease and omitted the butter. I added some lightly steamed broccolli.

So good and fast to make!  To make less halved the butter and used turkey bacon.  Sauteed mushroom and spinach is also good in it.

I love this recipe. I have cooked traditional carbonara many times  but enjoyed making this one better. You can actually place this in a warm oven if not ready to serve immediately and the ingredients do not break down. I only added abouth half the bacon grease, though, and thought it was great.

Made as written, I was dissappointed that this was not carbonara sauce that I have been searching for.  :(   I gave it 3 stars because the basic sauce was rich and creamy and has potential, but the bacon flavor was overpowering and was not in character with the "restaurant quality" carbonara sauces I love.  So, I will still search.

This is a new family favorite. I followed the recipe except for adding some chopped grilled chicken and a little more milk due to the fact that I cooked down the sauce a little too much. My kids and husband ate this up, fought over who got the last plate full and are already asking for me to cook it again

This sure is a winner. I use fettuccine, everything else remains the same. A nice way to cut the fat in a family favorite.

This pasta dish was divine. I cut the serving size down to one and enjoyed this all by myself. Such a simple recipe, so easy! When I added the pasta to the sauce, I was afraid there wasn't enough liquid. But when I dug in, it was just perfect. Thank you for the recipe. :)

I'm always hesitant to try the Carbonara versions with raw eggs in them so I was happy to see this one. My family totally enjoyed it, even my picky 11-year-old.

I have made this several times and have found the recipe to be fantastic!  I eliminated the bacon and added grilled chicken, asiago and romano cheeses.  Everyone I have made this for goes crazy and asks for the recipe.  It's quick and easy!

This was delicious!  The only changes I made were to use garlic powder instead of garlic (only because I was out of fresh garlic!), and I drained all of the bacon grease.  I liked it very much as is, but you could easily add peas, or chicken, etc.

It was edible.  I don't cook boxed foods and this definitely tasted like it could have been one.  The 11 yo was disgusted by it.  I finally had to whisk the cream cheese to a smooth texture.  It was a bust.

My boyfriend likes fettucine, so i used that and added some mushrooms that i sauteed with the garlic, Also I add chicken sometimes seasoned with italian seasoning a cooked in a little of the bacon fat. Last time I made it I had to double it so instead of using two packages of cream cheese, I used one and one package of the new philidelphia brand garlic flavored cooking cream. Delicious! The fam loves it.

this is still on my stove!  So yummy I can't wait to eat.  I did cut back a little on the butter, used fat free cream cheese and skim milk.  I added peas and parsley.  And a bit extra of freshly grated asiago cheese.  Will be making again

I thought this was just okay. I halved the recipe because it was just me and my husband. We both thought it needed more sauce. It was very dry and kinda bland. I added rotisserie chicken breast and some mushrooms and it was just okay. Probably wont make again.

I have to say I was reluctant to use this recipe since it differed so much from the typical egg recipe I'm use to. I'm so glad I gave it a try though. Absolutely delicious. I left out the Parmesan as I didn't have any on hand and it was still a hit with everyone. I probably used a bit more bacon as well since we're all bacon lovers. Thank you for sharing.

We loved it! We added twice as much cheese and used finely shredded instead of grated!(: It was AMAZING. I highly recommend it. It is really rich, just a heads up. One of the best recipes I've gotten from this website. Thank you so much!

This was very good fresh, but did not sit well.  I was surprised to see that people took this to potlucks because after 1/2 hour mine was practically inedible.

Extremely good recipe.  Easy to fix.  I didn't have garlic cloves so I just used a few shakes of garlic powder.  Make sure you go ahead and use the bacon drippings.  Wonderful!  Real close to Pasta House's version.  Thanks for the recipe, I will make it again.

I used 1 pound fettucine pasta, 8 oz. meat of choice (Ham, Bacon, Chicken), 1 cup of Horizon Organic Brand Fat Free milk, and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  I removed the drippings and used about 1 tsp. of butter to saute my garlic and added 1 med. sized onion (diced of course) to this.  This should be a light brown color when it is done. After mixture is sauteed add 6 tbsp. tomato and cook until tomato is much lighter (almost pink/orange in color). When you add your meat to this mixture add 6 tbsp. peas as well (Frozen and cooked while meat is cooked.) My tbsp. are heaping in size if this helps anyone.  Try this if you do not love it please change it until you do.  [Note only the meat and pasta should be larger than the size of a pea.]

A little too much cream cheese for my liking.  Other than that, not a bad recipe.  Will try again with less cream cheese, also adding some peas.

Great recipe! This may not be true to the original intention of the recipe, but I added about 1/2 cup of Ragu sauce, just to give it a little extra kick.  My entire family, including my picky 5 and 2 yr old enjoyed it.  (Leftovers were kind of "off" though.  Maybe mixing more milk in would help?)

Great recipe.  The perfect blend of buttery to cheesy taste.  My family loved it.  This was better than alot of restaurant alfredo sauces!

Yes this was quick and easy. Start to finish was less than 30 minutes which is always a winner but Carbonara it's not. Too bland and didn't have the pop of a good Carbonara that highlights the many ingredients. This was just another bland cream sauce pasta with an enormous amount of fat and calories. 

Substitutions/changes- I added fresh sliced mushrooms. I reduced the cream cheese by a third, reduced the butter in half, and added 1/4 c milk extra as others have recommended. Edible so it got three stars but we won't be making it again.

This was delicious and really simple to make. It was a lot different from any carbonara I've ever had, as most of them include eggs. Overall however, it was a very good dish and didn't take too long.

The only changes I made to this recipe was to add chicken and mushrooms. Oh and I used 10 strips of bacon, we love bacon. I think the recipe is missing some spices. It was very good but I think with a little seasoning it will be as good as Olive Gardens. Will make this again, thank you for a quick and easy meal.

I made this pasta recently. Was definetely very simple and quick. I thought sauce was a bit too thick and intense, I would try with more milk next time. I also added chicken to my dish.

This was very yummy.  If you're watching your waisteline watchout.  I followed the recipe but sauteed up some onions and diced carrots in butter and added them to the noodles.  And once the butter melted in the bacon drippings I cooked the eggs in that and then just dumped it all into the noodles and stirred.  To get more meat I also took ham and diced it up in there.

Wow, I really like this recipe! It was pretty easy, and I had to substitute light cream cheese and tub margarine b/c that's all I had on hand, and it was still really good.  Tip: I had to wisk the sauce once it all melted-before the bacon  and cheese-to have it all come together, and that worked great.  yum!

I was looking for a carbonara-ish recipe that didn't have the eggs.  This is it.  I made this for my family, and we could not stop talking about it.  This is by far the most cream-cheesey-garlicy-bacon-ey-goodness that has ever graced my table.  I have never reviewed a recipe here, but this deserved it.  I follwed the instructions for the sauce, only adding about 1/4 cup additional milk to smooth the sauce a bit more.  I also waited on making the pasta until the sauce was closer to being finished, as opposed to the "meanwhile" suggested here.  I did serve this with a grilled chicken breast lightly herbed with Italian seasonings.    Due to the richness of the sauce, I wouldn't put this on the weekly menu, but I will definitely be making this for company, as it will surely impress.  I wish I could give this more than 5 stars!!

This is a great recipe.  The only changes I made were:  I used ham, rather than bacon and I added a little bit of Splenda.  The Splenda doesn't make the sauce overly sweet, but it does add something to the overall flavour.  I make this recipe, with or without the ham, often.

Very good with some variations. I sauteed garlic and chopped onions with the a little bit of the leftover grease. Had to add one egg to the sauce mixture and a pinch of sour cream (also, didn't follow exact measurements)- turned out very, very good!

This was ok. If I make it again I'll use half and half rather than milk, add a jalapeno, increase the amount of bacon, and add more black pepper. It was so close to delicious but seemed to fall short on boldness and richness of flavor.

This didn't have any flavor.  I even added some crushed red pepper, but the cream cheese completely over powered all the flavors, so I was left with a really thick, tasteless dish.  I won't make this again.

This sauce is marvelous!  The 250g pkg of cream cheese is not sold here in Germany so I used 300g pkg instead.  This made the sauce a bit runny so I sifted 1 tbsp of flour to thicken it up.  You can also add some freshly chopped parsley for extra colour.  I served it with 250g whole wheat spaghetti and used only half the sauce.  Next time I will make half the sauce for for just my husband and I, or if guests show up unexpectedly, I will double the ingredients.  This is a great dish to "wow" your guests.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I wasn't very impressed with this recipe. It didn't seem to have enough ingredients so I added mushrooms, chicken, and broccoli to mine and it still seemed to lack in flavor. It was a little better with some added salt. My husband thought it was pretty good, but I probably won't be making it again.

SO GOOD!  Something to make for a special occasion because it is very fattening.  It is easy to make, but looks and tastes like it is much more complicated and time-consuming.  DELICIOUS!

I think the flavor of this was good if you're in a pinch...and don't have heavy cream like I didn't.  I found that it was awfully greasy though with all the cream cheese and butter.  Also, my cream cheese curdled a bit when I put it in the pan so if I were to make again, I'd soften it more in the microwave first.

I made this for dinner last nite and my family loved it.  They said it tasted like something from Macaroni Grill.  Very easy and quick to make.

I have some diet restrictions, so I didn't follow the exact amounts (2 slices of bacon instead of 6, ect.) but my goodness this was good. My mom isn't big on cheese and even with all the creamy stuff she liked it. It smelled like my favorite Italian restaurant in my kitchen. Very good, I will most definitely be making this again.

I know real carbonara is suppose to be made with eggs- no cream or cream cheese. This was just too gooey and fatty for me.

Quick and easy. I used 1/3 less fat cream cheese because I had it on hand and it worked great. I added halved cherry tomatoes, a can of sliced mushrooms, some frozen peas and chopped fresh parsley because I had them to use up. Very fattening but very good. Served with Spinach Apple Salad, also from this site.

This was my first Carbonara and it was incredible! My husband and I devoured it.  I added zucchini and tomatoes bc we weren't having a salad beforehand.  I can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow!!

This is very delicious. I did as most recommended of cutting down the amounts of butter and cream cheese. Next time I will change it up with chicken or a vegetable. But very good and my picky eaters enjoyed.

This is a great recipe and really quick. this was my first attempt at a white sauce... 

I used half the butter, almond milk instead of regular milk and I used chicken breast instead of bacon.. came out healther and tasted great. I also added some sauted bell pepper(orange), julianned...

Easy, fabulous and takes no time at all. Even my picky eater kids loved it. I used Turkey bacon and Nuefchatel cheese to make it slightly healthier. It turned out great.

My family really liked this recipe...and it was easy!  The fat content is a concern to me, so next time I will try to use some lower fat alternatives.

Great as written! Easy and also fast, once you have made it before. I was in a rush the second time I made it, and burnt the garlic in the bacon grease, heads up!

Very yummy and rich. I cheated and used garlic powder instead of cloves and I poured some of my bacon grease (I used a skillet with a grease catcher on it) straight in with my milk and cream cheese. I also added some minced onion and ground nutmeg. VERY good!
