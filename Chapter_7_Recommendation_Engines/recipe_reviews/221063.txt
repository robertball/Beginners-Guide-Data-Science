I thought I would like this better than my usual recipe, but just didn't care for all the peas in it for some reason.  Was ok otherwise, but still like the old way better

I used leftover coleslaw dressing for the creamy salad dressing ingredient. Also, I found canned sliced black olives with jalape√±os, so I used those. This salad was a hit, especially with my vegetarian daughter. I'll definitely make this again!
