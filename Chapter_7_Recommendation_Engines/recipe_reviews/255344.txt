3-Ingredient Cookie Haiku: "Odd but good 'cookie', want to swap chocolate chips, but for what, dunno." I had a squishy brown banana on the counter, a near-empty bag of mini chocolate chips, and quick cooking oats, so blammo, this recipe was easy for my young daughters to throw together. If it wasn't for the chocolate, I would make these a breakfast treat. I wish the recipe submitter mentioned in the notes how well and long they keep - wrapped, covered, refrigerated? For now, we just ate them all. A bit smooshy, but tasty nonetheless.

Instead of chocolate chips, I used dried coconut and they turned out quite good!
They are super easy to make and I will probably make them again!
Though they did take a while to bake. And when they came out they looked kinda rubbery, but I took one bite and loved 'em!

I had my first thru second grade club students make these cookies because they were so simple. The kids loved it. We found that this recipe size made just a few cookies which was perfect for our group size and timing.
Personally I found the cookies to be a bit bland. A dash of salt, vanilla and cinnamon will likely give these cookies the flavor boost they need. 
I will make these again in club, but not likely at home.

I decided to try this because it only had three ingredients but couldn't resist adding a few things I had in the cupboard.  I added slices almonds, protein powder, peanut butter and dried cranberries.  just a tablespoon or two of each .  I also added an egg and a bit more oatmeal based on other reviews.  So, I didn't try the original recipe but I really liked it with the way I made it.

A completely easy and healthy tidbit. It’s not exactly my idea of a cookie, but it definitely works as a little sweet snack. I added a few tbs of chopped walnuts, a little salt, vanilla, and cinnamon, plus a bit more oatmeal then a sprinkling of flour because it was still too wet.

Sorry to say, not a fan. Husband wasn't fond of them, either. They've got a 'rubbery' texture to them. Baked them a bit longer than called for hoping because they were so gooey when we 1st took them out of the oven.  Not sure if raisins vs. chocolate chips would have made a difference. I did pop the others into the freezer to see if they're any better as a frozen treat. Will update accordingly. Thank you for sharing your recipe, OP.

These are yummy and healthy. More of a good snack rather than a dessert but for those who want a healthier option and less sugar this is great!

Added a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of vanilla. Replace the chocolate chips with almonds or peanuts for a healthier twist!

For a vegan/whole food plant based cookie, it was very good.  The recipe gives the option for raisins so I used them rather than chocolate chips to keep it a little healthier.

This was pretty yummy. I added more oatmeal (another quarter cup) and an egg, which definitely solved the consistency complaints someone else mentioned. Instead of chocolate chips, I mixed in a little butterscotch, almonds, and dried cranberries. My bananas were *very* overripe, which I think is the secret to adding no additional sugar. These were *so* sweet. I probably don't need the butterscotch, though it went great. Without the candy, this would be so healthy. VERDICT: Would bake again.

I had to give these cookies a five star.  These are quite addictive and if you're not careful could eat a whole batch.  My very picky son loves these and everyone who tries them wants the recipe.   No one can believe they are so simple to make plus being so tasty.  I had some raisins left over from another recipe and added those with the chocolate chips.  Since I had plumped them up for the other recipe they made this even better.  Thanks for the great recipe.
