This is very good.  I made some adjustments however to suit my taste more.  I left out the schnapps, and used regular rum instead of lemon flavored (didn't have any on hand).  After I muddled and mixed, it tasted too sour to me so I added some simple syrup I had on hand.  Delicious!  Even my husband who isn't a mojito lover loved this one.

I don't normally like mojtos, or actually the strong mint flavor, but this recipe caught my eye because it had the sour apple and pineapple juice.  We have some mint growing in our garden and thought I would give it a try and it turned out to be very refreshing.  I did use a bit less mint, just enough to give it flavor, but not so much where it was over powering.  Great summer drink, very enjoyable.

This was pretty good. It was a little too sour for my taste.

Perfect with Asian Barbeque!  I made the drink for one, and did find it a bit too sour.  When making it for 6 of us, I adjusted the recipe and used Shasta Pineapple soda instead of the club soda and 1/2 the amount of pineapple juice.  Delicious!
