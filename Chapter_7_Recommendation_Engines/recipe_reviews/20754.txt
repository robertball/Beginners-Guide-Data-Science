I made this right after school just for fun and it was very quick and easy. I also used fat-free milk so it had fewer calories and it was still good.

This was a way over rated recipe. All the hard work of grating the chocolate was enough to turn me off from the begining. It isn`t good tasting and it takes a long time to do. If you want hot chocolate get it out of a packet!!!

Good recipe, however, I made some modifications before I was happy. I got rid of the microwave completely and cooked in a sauce pan. The egg gives it nice texture. To get rid of the egg bits, simply pour the completed hot chocolate through a strainer. Also I doubled the chocolate chips.

The egg must be properly beaten beforehand or you'll get lumps in your hot chocolate. If you do, you can always strain it, as I found the egg hardly affected the taste at all.

I made the same recipe again using 1 cup of milk, a smaller fraction of the egg, and chocolate drops in stead of grated chocolate. I will omit the egg next time. 
A good recipe overall.

Although this recipe was created for preparation in a microwave, I prepared mine using the stove top.  Microwaves are notoriously finicky.  And then there was the issue with the egg.  For all those that had an issue with "scrambled" egg, be sure to "temper" the egg first.  For all those bakers and cooks who don't know...tempering an egg is done by adding the hot liquid of the recipe to the egg a little at a time until the egg is warm enough to throw in and not scramble it in the process.

Yummy...I Just made this for my boys!!! I made mine on the stove and used Merkins choc. If you beat the egg you will not have problems. I added marshmallows and dipped a candy cane in it.

Good and simple recipe, I did it a bit differently, I didn't use the egg and I added a pinch of Cayenne pepper and it came out fantastic. Oh and I did it all on a sauce pan since my microwave since mine doesn't work.

This is the best homemade hot chocolate I've ever had! I did this on the stove because I don't like using a microwave, and it was perfect. I also used chocolate chips which melted just fine in the warm milk. SUPER YUMMY!

Wonderful!  Instead of mixing the egg into the chocolate mixture, it works well to mix just a little of the warm chocolate mixture in with the egg.   Whisk well, slowly adding more and more hot chocolate with the egg.  Then when you add the egg mixture to the hot chocolate it won't be lumpy.  We made it on the stove top and it worked great.  It's nice to have an after school snack with some extra protein.  Thanks, Steph!

Best hot chocolate ever... I doubled this recipe and didn't use egg.  I also used semisweet chocolate chips mixed with dark chocolate chips melted in microwave and then stirred into the 2% milk warming on the stove.  Whisked constantly until hot.  Served, topped with whip cream and grated Ghiradellie 60% cocoa sprinkled on whip cream. Cinnamon is what makes this recipe.  Again don't use the egg.

Just so you all who are talking about clumps of egg, if you temper it by mixing a little bit of hte chocolate mixture in with the whisked egg, and then add it to the rest of the chocolate mixture, it will prevent clumps WAY better AND tends to help with the creaminess of the hot chocolate.

I used two and a half cups of skim milk, a cup of cream, six squares of chocolate and added a little chili powder and a little vanilla. I omitted the egg. An excellent base, though, for alterations.

Delicious!  You must work the egg in slowly, whisking constantly.  I used 2 cups 1% milk and 1 cup evaporated milk.  Also, a pinch of cayanne and nutmeg.

This made very nice hot cocoa.  A tip with the egg so it won't make chunks: wisk the egg well in a small bowl so that it is an even color yellow, when the chocolate is all melted in the milk spoon 1 tablespoon of hot chocolate milk into the egg in the small bowl and mix well.  Do this 2 more times, then add the egg slowly into the milk and mix it in right away until the milk is frothy.  The trick is to make the egg just warm enough that when you put it into the chocolate milk it doesn't cook as you add it.

This is the best hot chocolate I have tasted yet. I opted to make mine on the stove instead of the microwave. I also used milk chocolate instead of semi-sweet and I love the cinnamon taste. I think the cinnamon makes this special. I topped with whipped cream, cinnamon and nutmeg. A five star keeper in my book!

I LOVE this recipe but dropped a star because I think it would be really weird if left as-is. I mean, 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon?? I just used a sprinkle and it was already a little too much! (And I love cinnamon too, so that's saying a lot! Don't you want to be able to taste the chocolate here??) Also, add a splash of vanilla and a pinch of salt! I used unsweetened chocolate and extra sugar to make up the difference, simply because that's what I had handy, but I'm sure the semisweet is great too. Using the egg is brilliant! So creamy and rich! But I can't for the life of me figure out why people are complaining about lumps unless they just don't know how to cook with egg as a thickener. Beat it well before adding and whisk it in GRADUALLY! I made this both on the stove top and in the microwave and like the stove top much better, but the microwave method is good in a pinch. With the adjustments, this is a perfect homemade cocoa!

Good, but i made a few changes. **TIP** TEMPER THE EGG!!!! That means slowly adding some of the hot liquid while whisking the egg. This will bring the egg up to the same temp as the milk with out the temp shock and then scrabbling. I did mine on the stovetop since i don't have a microwave. I also doubled the chocolate that the recipe calls for. And i used chocolate chips i had in the cupboard! Don't bother grating the chocolate! Either cheat and use chips, or do a rough chop with a knife on a cutting board if you're using a bar of chocolate. I hope this helps some people! Love and peace! Cheers!

Temper the egg(whisk the entire cooking time), use on a stove top, omit the sugar if using chocolate chips, and add a dash of cayanne if you're feeling adventurous. I also kept the cinnamon, but used just a little less then called for. I just sent my husband off to work 20 minutes ago with a big smile on his face! Next time i might add a packet of starchucks instant coffee to it as well. Keeper!

Great recipe, especially if you have a vitamix!  Just dumped all the ingredients in without grating the chocolate & about 4 minutes later, steamy, frothy, yummy hot chocolate.  Everything blended up perfectly.  Will be using this again.  Thank you.

this recipe is great and easy to do on the spur of the moment when you are snowed in!!  Instead of grating chocolate, I used the mini-morsels, and it melted up fine!!

Very good hot chocolate.  I used chocolate chips because that's what I had.  Next time, I'll try it with half the cinnamon.  I'll also try it without the egg just to see if I can taste a difference; if it's as good without using the egg, I'd rather not deal with the little egg bits.

Honestly, way more trouble than its worth....BUT, if you wanted to really wow guests I propose the following:

Do this on the stove, not the microwave
Ignore the egg.
Be sure to use Whole Milk.
Heat the milk with a Vanilla Bean and Cinnamon stick to steep.  Add the chocolate 1/4c per 2c milk which is a little bit more than what the recipe calls for.  Before service, BE SURE TO STRAIN which will ensure a silky smooth texture without any choco, cinnamon, or milk bits at the bottom.

This needs more chocolate!  Approximately double the 1/3 cup.

did a single serving in my 1 3/4 cup mug.recipe 1 1/2cups 1%milk,1/4 cup nestle's semi-sweet chips, 1 1/2 tsp sugar 1/8 tsp vietnamese cinnamon 1egg 1/16 tsp vanilla bean paste.  put milk on high medium, I have a stirrring attachment on my hand blender. drop egg in cup and stir.  as milk heats up add a small amount of warm milk about three times up until you add the choc chips and stir those in milk add alittle more to cup and stir again then dump into pan an stir in with cinnamon and bean paste and sugar. pour into cup when hot enough to drink. easy and marvelous.  I always substitue bean paste for extract.  All you have to do is taste side by side and you'll almost never use extract again.  It is $9 a bottle but keeps forever.  I might eliminate the cinnamon next time for a more pure chocolate taste. I have done this 4 times and dropped the cinnamon.  Liked it better.  A REAL side benifit with a whole egg it is so filling that I"M full all morning.  Have dropped 2 lbs

I did this on the stove top on low.  I also used semisweet chocolate morsels.  Just stirred continuously until hot.  I also left out the egg.  Fabulous...my kids and neighbor kids loved it.  Definitely a keeper!

I customized this recipe to meet the needs of my family.  I have a child with food allergies and so I made it gluten and casein free.  The substitutes I used were rice milk, GFCF chocolate chips (which I did not even try to grate) and honey for the T of sugar (but then I topped it with GF marshmallows, so substituting the honey was kind of pointless, but oh well).  I whisked the egg very well before adding it to the mixture and I had very few lumps.  My kids drank this up!  I had a mug, as well, and the cinnamon was very nice!  We'll be making this again!  Next time I think I'll make it on the stove, though.

Awesome.  I left out the egg entirely (I didn't think it would make much difference) and cooked it on the stove where I could whisk the heck out of it.  Once it was strained into my cup it was absolutely brilliant.  Great on a cold night. :)

Every good and worth the effort.  I have made this with and without the egg.  The egg seems to add a little something to it, but it was fine without it. Kids love!!!!

My husband asks for this every chance he gets.  I add two mugs full of milk instead of 3 cups that way I have just enough. I use chocolate chips that I keep in the freezer.  I still use the rest of the ingredients even the egg(you may not need it if you are using whole milk but we use skim so it makes it frothy).  Make sure you whisk it in a separate bowl and then add it to the warm milk.  Seeing as its the holidays we are now adding crushed candy cane to make a peppermint hot chocolate. Yummy!

Mmm, absolutely delicious!! I loved it, the cinammon really added flavor! I was trying to use up some Nestle swirled semisweet and white chocolate chips leftover from another recipe, so I couldn't grate the chocolate. I melted them in them microwave instead (put in microwave on medium for 1 minute, take out and stir, put it in again for 30-60 seconds before taking out and stirring again). I didn't have any lumps of eggs mentioned in other reviews. What I did was whisk it vigorously for 3-5 minutes :)

Really a keeper-- I'm definitely switching to this recipe!

Easy and delicious! Be sure to whisk the egg thoroughly and add a little of the warm liquid to the egg before adding to the mix. This will prevent the egg from scrambling. Pour some spiced rum for the adults! 1oz per serving.

I made this because I really wanted some hot chocolate and we were out. We were also out of regular milk, so I used dry milk. After cooking, and looking at it(it had lumps), I balled up the recipe and threw it in the garabage. I decided to taste it anyway after stirring it more(it works with chocolate chips too), and the taste was truly delightful! I was really surprised! So, I came upstairs and reprinted this recipe.This was very good!
Thanks for the warning about the lumps. I will do better next time!

I didn't use the best chocolate and did not have any cinnamon in my house therefore it was not that great. I believe with a more expensive chocolate this recipe would be very tasty! Also, be sure to mix the eggs really good or else ou will have scrambled eggs in you hot chocolate!

I did this over the stove top.  I'm wary of letting kids use the microwave and hot liquids.  Liquids in the microwave can look deceptively still and then explode when you try to take it out of the microwave.  The taste wasn't quite strong enough.  I added more chocolate but I used a Toblerone chocolate bar and I added more sugar.

My first time making it from scratch and it was great.  Used hazelnut flavored agave nectar to sweeten which gave it a great nutty flavor that I love.  Will keep this one for sure!

This was incredible.  I doubled the choclate and used Whole milk which made it really rich.  I used a hand mixer to beat the egg to ensure it was beaten well without the chunks in it.  My family all liked it but my wife could have done without the cinammon.  Next time I will try adding a little vanilla instead.  Thanks for a great recipe.  It is so much better than a packet.

This is a wonderful recipe! This was my first time making my own hot chocolate, and it took me only a few minutes. I did make a few modifications, just due to my personal preferences--I omitted the egg, doubled the cinnamon, and added more chocolate chips. It was delicious! (Also I made this with fat free milk, and it was yummy!)

A pretty good hot chocolate!  This is the first homemade recipe I've tried for hot chocolate, and it hit the spot!  I added a bit more sugar to each mug, and next time I believe I would leave out the cinnamon.

Pretty tasty.  It was very easy to make.  I thought the cinnamon was a little heavy--I taste more of that than chocolate.  I would probably use this recipe again using less cinnamon.

I made this with changes. I give it 5 stars the way I made it. I used the stovetop. I tempered the egg with the hot liquid. I deleted the cinnamon and added extra chocolate chips and a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. It thickened a bit as it cooled. It was so creamy and good. I also briefly blended it in a high powered blender and that gave it extra smoothness.

I shredded crunch bars for my 1/3 cup of chocolate and didn't put in the egg.  When it was all finished I added some Malibu to mind and turned it into a drink that my friend said she orders at the bar called a mounds bar.  I will maybe use a little less cinnamon next time.  Thanks for a good recipe!

Perfect for rainy days!
I think the egg is the most important part- makes the creamy texture.

I was skeptical about egg in hot chocolate, but tried it, and found that it really adds to the flavor. I was also skeptical that there wasn't any salt in the recipe, but the egg (a high-sodium food) seems to do the trick. I recommend keeping it!  I used only white chocolate (all I had in the cupboard) and it was good, though with only a "delicate" chocolatey flavor. I'll try doubling the amount of chocolate next time. However, it's WORTH the time to use real, grated chocolate!

Just make sure you beat the eggs REALLY good or you get little chunks which are really yucky.  but it's delicious if you do it right.  I take frozen chocolate chips and put them in my small chopper and it works great for the chocolate.  A dash of vanilla is really good also.  And we top ours with a dallop of whipped cream.  ummmm.... perfect for coming in out of the cold and warming little hands up.

Complex and tasty.  I added a pinch of chili powder, which was delicious.  Rather than straining the final product, as someone else suggested, be sure to temper the egg before adding it to the hot mixture, and you'll have no lumps!

Very yummy!  We cooked it on the stovetop, and used a thunderstick to beat the egg, so there weren't any globs of egg.  It was great as is, but we like things really chocolatey (plus we have colds, so our taste is dulled), so we added another 1/3 cup of chocolate.  Turned out great!

I made this with chocolate chips because it’s what I had. I put them in my Vitamix to break them down, added the sugar and cinnamon, and followed the rest of the recipe until the end. It wasn’t mixed well enough, even though I whisked it quite hard. So, I put everything back into the Vitamix and whirred it up until it was fully mixed and frothy. It was good, but I will not put the cinnamon in next time, as it overpowered the chocolate.

A great base able to be adapted to what's on hand! For the mugs at work, 1.5 cups milk, 2 TBSP Cocoa, 2 TBSP sugar. Cooked on stove because it was easier to watch to the boiling point. Slight problems with egg clotting, but it did make it richer.

It was good but I'm still searching for the perfect hot chocolate recipe. The cinnamon made it gritty and I got the egg umbilical cord thing in my mouth during the last swig. That was definitely a big turn off. Otherwise, I didn't have any of the egg chunks that others complained about. You can prevent that by whisking the eggs smoothly and tempering it.  The way you temper it is by adding a couple hot spoonfuls of the hot milk mixture into cold whisked eggs. Whisk it together before adding the slightly warmed egg mixture into the hot milk. Then whisk them together again.

It was yummy, I did it on the hob instead of the microwave, The egg kind of went funny but after reading other reviews i understand why. I didnt really like the cinnamon in it either it was quite strong. But it has a great texture and will be using the recipe again with some tweaks !

I made this on the stove top. The egg made this creamy (to avoid clumps I whisked the egg in a cup, added some of the hot milk while whisking, and then poured it into the pot), and the cinnamon was a nice touch, but there wasn't nearly enough chocolate. I added another handful of chips, and some chocolate syrup, but it was still lacking the rich chocolatliness I look for in hot cocoa.

This recipe was terrible! From the beginning it tasted disgusting and when the egg was added, it turned a sloppy mousse.

The egg wasn't worth the trouble and it was bitter. I added a lot more sugar.

Perfect! I added a little bit of mini marshmallows. It is really thick (which I love) and has a good consistency. The only thing is that you have to make sure your egg is beaten very well. If it isn't beaten well it will come out clumpy. I will definetly use this recipe again.

I made this on the fly when we ran out of packets on a snowy day.  I was leery of the cinnamon and the egg chunks others warned about.  I decided to blend the milk and egg while it was still cold with an immersion blender before I heated all the ingredients on the stove.  I found this to be more simple and the ingredients were all well mixed by the blender, which created a froth as well.  The cinnamon turned out to be a pleasant surprise.  It was not too strong and not too sweet.  Just right.  Even my children begged for more.  This one's a keeper.

Quick question; on step two when I "return the the microwave," do I mixed the warm milk with the chocolate mixture, followed by heating it again?

I loved this recipe. I didn't bother grating the chocolate, instead I broke up the microwave time and wisked the mixture to ensure the chocolate was melted and well mixed. Then I added the peppermint schnapps. Yum! The egg made it nice and creamy.

This is a great recipe! I used only milk, no water so really creamy. I made one cup as my family turned up their noses at the ingredients. Guess what, after a taste I was making three more cups so I could finish my own, thanks!

I used my hand blender to get the egg beaten thoroughly, so no egg whites would congeal later on.  I tried to cheat and used mini chocolate chips, but I had to use my hand blender again to get them to really blend in well (after I washed it, of course).

I liked this recipe...all except for the egg. There were chunks of egg whites in the hot chocolate. It was pretty easy to make besides grating the chocolate.

The recipe was easy to make and prepare but make sure to whisk the eggs completely smooth. I didn't take the time to completely whisk them smooth and I got big egg chunks in my hot cocoa.
