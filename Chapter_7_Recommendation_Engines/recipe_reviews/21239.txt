Hubs and I, and our two grown children, will be leaving for Italy in just three short days and I have been able to think of little else. In celebration and anticipation of our return to Italy, Hubs and I enjoyed this wonderful, buttery smooth after dinner drink tonight as a commemorative toast,  Frangelico being my favorite liqueur on the planet.  The thought of bits or even chunks of hazelnuts ruining what would otherwise be a smooth and creamy treat didn't appeal to me, so I left them out, just sprinkling a few chopped hazelnuts on the whipped cream garnish.  Just as I had anticipated, this was really delicious - rich and creamy and, because of the outstanding Italian Frangelico, a very fitting after dinner drink on the eve of our exciting trip.

I used chocolate almond ice cream, omitted the milk and upped the liqueur. Very nutty.

I loved all the ingredients but didn't care for all those nuts floating around.  Maybe they should be chopped down more, or leave them out and add more hazelnut liqueur.
