We enjoyed this very much! I think after I prep everything next time, I will make the Hollandaise and sausage first, that way I can focus on poaching the eggs and then the assembly of the dish.  That said the sauce was a little thin for me, next time around I will have some more cheese ready to thicken it up as well.  We really enjoyed the combination of flavors, thank you!
