This pork dish was crazy good!  I didn't have access to a grill due to the cold so I opted for the baking it for 40 minutes on 400 degree method and it was fabulous.  I followed the recipe to a T but added in minced garlic to the marinade.  We thoroughly enjoyed this and enjoyed the sauce it made served over white rice.  Thank you for another great one!

Very tasty!  I buy pork tenderloin when it is on sale, mix up the marinade in a Ziploc bag, toss in the tenderloin and freeze.  This way it is ready to go when it thaws and it's an easy, tasty meal that is ready for the grill.

I made this recipe last night, and it was fantastic. Instead of throwing away the marinade, however, I boiled it (to kill the raw-pork germs) and then used it to baste the tenderloin while grilling. My tenderloin took about 40 minutes to cook over indirect heat, and I turned it every 10 minutes and basted. The results was was very tender meat with a fantastic glaze. Yum!

This is a fantastic recipe.  I did not cook on the grill however, I first browned the tenderloin on the stovetop in a dutch oven with a little oil.  Then, I added the sauce and baked in the dutch oven on 325 for about an hour, until the pork was cooked to 145 degrees. Also, when the pork was resting, I heated the sauce on the stove with a cup of chicken broth and little corn starch.  Served the sauce over the pork.  Thanks for the recipe!

I found this recipe on here about 6 months ago and it has since bcome my main marinade for pork. I even use it on my roasts. Sometimes I add some chopped rosemary and I always mince some garlic or use powder. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very delicious and easy.  Marinated overnight and also saved the marinade and made into a wonderful gravy.  Made it in winter so baked at 425 for 35 minutes in oven.

This was very tastey and my kids sat down saying they wouldn't eat it and ended up finishing the whole dish!!  Very easy.  Being January, I roasted in a 400 degree oven for about 40 mins rather than grill it.

Just finished dinner with this as the star. It was delicious beyond description, and I am not kidding. The ONLY change I added for us was 1/4 tsp minced garlic and a dash of cayenne to add a bit of heat, and I mean very little heat. Marinated in a ziplock bag 4 hours; boiled the marinade while the tenderloin was in the oven, then poured that syrup-thickness sauce over top and finished. Total cooking time 1 hour at 400 and it was a perfect 145 degrees at exactly an hour. Roasted red potatoes and onions (paprika, garlic, Olive oil) alongside; served with the greatest baby carrots (Dijon Glazed Carrots from this site--those are simply wonderful). It was one of the best meals ever. Husband quote: "I have honestly never, ever had pork this good before". THANKS for the recipe ! We'll be keeping for sure.

The flavor and tenderness of this recipe is outstanding - I would recommend it to anyone.  And it is a low fat recipe - no oil added and a low fat pork.  All in all, definitely a keeper.

YUM!  We love this recipe, even my 4 and   6 year old sons.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  The only thing I did differently was to reserve the marinade, whisk in a little chicken broth, and boil to reduce.  Served the sauce on the side and my kids drowned their rice with it.  Very good recipe.

We really liked this on the grill.  We boiled the extra sauce and it worked out great!  We get the 2 pack tenderloins which each have 2 loins in each pack.  I make 2 bags of marinade out of this recipe and put 1 loin in each one.  One goes in the freezer for another day after marinating in the fridge till supper time.  Then thaw over night before grilling.

How could something this simple taste so amazingly good?? I used ancho chili powder and prepared as directed. Perfection! The marinade was so good that I boiled it down and served it as a glaze at the table. This one's a keeper for sure!

This was just OK for us.  The meat was certainly tender but I felt it was rather bland.  I added minced garlic to the ingredients, marinated overnight, then boiled the leftover marinade and let it reduce down and add a bit of butter for richness.  Don't know if we'll have again.

This was great.  I let it marinate all day and the tenderloin came out so nice and tender.  I like a little bit extra of a zip so I added about 1 teaspoon of the chili powder.  Will make again for sure.

FANTASTIC!  My husband found this recipe and made it himself.  He does not cook much, and this was awesome.  It sat in the fridge about 24 hours, after he tenderized the pork loins a few times with a fork to get the marinade in the meat. He seared it first, then cooked with indirect heat on the grill and it was fantastic.  2 different neighbors stopped over, had a bite and said next time we make it to let them know and they will bring over their own tenderloins for him to cook!  Simply amazing!

good but no great. i think it was a little too sweet and not tangy enough for us. I cooked it in the oven 400 , 60 min. It took a lot longer than other reviewers said, it felt tough so I kept it longer and came out good (we like well done in our house) Added garlic as other suggested as well

It was good, but it didn't blow me away.  The recipe for chipotle crusted tenderloin is much tastier than this recipe.

Oh was this recipe ever good!  I followed the ingredients exactly.  I ended up marinating this for two days before I got around to using it, and baked it in the oven for 40 minutes at 400 degrees.  It was so juicy!  I made the sauce recommended by others by mixing the remaining marinade with a cup of chicken broth, but I didn't care for it too much.  I think the next time I make it I'll just boil the marinade as it is and use it as it's own sauce.  And I will be making this again, it was super easy and delicious!  Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

Excellent recipe.  We made it for the first time for company, and everyone loved it.  
I did not have dijon mustard so I used Boars Head Deli stlye mustard instead. 
I also added a little extra chili powder. We will definitely be making this again!

Loved it!  Made as is, marinated for 4hrs.  However, being Winter, I simply cooked it in the oven.  Tender and tasty:)

We really enjoyed this!! It was sooo easy, using ingredients I always have in the house. My husband's comment was that it was "outstanding", which is something since he usually says "very good" if he likes something...
I halved the recipe for use on about a pound-ish tenderloin, and boiled the remaining marinade to use as a sauce- in future, I would probably just make a separate dish of the marinade to use as a sauce b/c it was really good. Grilled to exactly 160 degrees & it came out perfect. Thanks!

This was good and I agree with some that the outside was tasty but the inside needed something.  Next time I'm going to puncture the meat with a fork to see if the flavor goes to the inside.

Great marinade!!  I increased the chili powder to 1/2 teaspoon and also added onion powder and minced garlic...why not? This makes quite a bit of marinade. We had 2.44 lbs of pork tenderloins and I could have still reduced it some, but does leave extra for basting while grilling. Pork was so tasty and juicy tender. My husband said to put this in the keeper recipes.

Sorry, but I found it quite bland and I added hot sauce to balance the sweetness. I grilled it and the outside was great but the pork didn't absorb much flavour - but a good way to save this recipe is by heating up the marinade and using that for dipping. That makes it a 4.

I marinated the Tenderloin overnight and my husband bbq'd according to instructions. Totally to die for. I served it the next day, heated slightly and my grandson said, "This is delicious!"
I have already made this again with the same results.

I made this last night for my boyfriend and he loved it! I added minced garlic to the recipe but only had about three hours to let the tenderloin marinade. I placed it on the top rack of the grill for about 30 mins. Yummy! I'll definately make it again.

Turned out better than I thought.  It passed the "kid test" with flying colors as my children asked and received 2nds!  They even ate the leftovers the next day!

This is such a wonderful recipe on the grill.  It turned out perfectly.  I did add a teaspoon of garlic powder because I put garlic in everything.  I also sauteed mushrooms and onions to serve on top of the pork tenderloin.  It was delicious.  Thank you for such a good recipe and I am an expert cook.

Got rave reviews.  Browned the pork on the stove and then baked at 400 for about 10 min.  I deglazed the pan with some white wine and threw in the marinade for a quick and easy sauce.

Absolutely delicious!  I used a full 1 t of chili powder and it was just nicely seasoned, not spicy.  We boiled and reduced the marinade to use as a dipping sauce.  Also let it marinate overnight.  The meat was wonderfully tender.

I marinated it for 48 hours, and there STILL wasn't enough flavor for my hubby and me; quite boring, in fact.  I thought it was going to be spectacular from all the rave reviews, but it was very disappointing.

This was so easy to prepare and tasted delicious!! I marinated my pork tenderloin roast overnight and my hubby barbecued it on indirect heat. I took the excess marinade and boiled it (so that I could reuse it). I poured the marinade over the sliced tenderloin...amazing! This is definitely a keeper!!

Easy and ymmu. I added mushrooms, bells and onions to the mix than I put them on kabobs and grilled along with the tenderloin, both the meat and veggies had so much flavor.

Even marinating overnight I thought it was lacking in flavor. Good base, but needs soy sauce or garlic perhaphs.

We grilled this for dinner tonight, and it was very good.  We followed the recipe exactly, but I think next time I'd add a little extra chili powder and pepper. I'll be glad for the leftovers!  Thanks!

Average recipe.  It needs more time chilli powder the noted.  Possible other flavors would be adviseble if you have them in the house (garlic, red pepper).  I used boneless pork chops and expected less marinade time needed, even more was needed then suggested.  Good but not great.

Terrific flavor! I roasted it in the oven (someone forgot to buy charcoal for the grill...) and it turned out moist, tender and very tasty. Will try it on the grill later this spring/summer.

I marinaded the tenderloin overnight, but didn't think it was terribly flavorful. If I were to make it again I would add garlic, more chili powder, and lots of black pepper. Thanks anyway.

This was very good.  I used 1 TABLESPOON of chili powder and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, also a little onion powder.  The recipe just sounded like it needed more seasonings and the additions worked out well.

I change this up just a little by adding olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  I poke the loins with a fork and marinate at least a day before no more than 2 days.  Then I keep the marinade and boil it to burn off any bacteria and glaze the loins on the grill.  This is one of my favorite marinades for pork loins.

I made the recipe exactly as directed. I felt it was good, but not outrageously so. The honey came through but overpowered the chili and salt so the flavor was a little lacking. The meat was not as tender as it usually comes out when I grill. I did not overcook- I always cook to medium and let rest for juicy tender pork. I may try it again but with some of the suggested modifications.

This dish was delicious! I also used the oven method and boiled the marinade so it could be used for basting. If you don't care to boil and use the marinade, I recommend having a smaller batch made up for basting. It was so juicy, tender and very flavorful. I will definitely be making this again!

I liked it, but I thought it was too sweet.  So for more bit, less honey & more mustard.  Granted, I marinated at room temp for 1 hr (did not have 4 hrs to spare).

Excellent - Had one pork tenderloin and three Italian sausages (all marinaded together). I always measure with the eye, added 1 heaping tablespoon chili powder and garlic salt. BBQ's 25 min over indirect heat (after searing it over flame). Boiled off the marinade. It was amazing !!! Thank you. Will definitely make again.

Very, very good.  I used honey dijon mustard because I didn't have enough honey on hand.  Still turned out great.  I cooked it for about 12-14 minutes per side on medium heat on my grill.  Definitely plan on having again.

Excellent! I have a new favorite recipe for tenderloin! Even my husband liked it and he's not big on tenderloin! I made the marinade and left it in the fridge overnight then grilled slowly so the honey didn't burn - juicy and tasty. Thanks for sharing!

I made this the other night with pork steak and my hubby and I really liked it. I think next time though I may add a bit more chili powder to increase the bite, it was a little sweet as is. But definitely a keeper!

Very good!! Made this for a dinner party and everyone loved the pork! Be careful not to overcook unless you make extra marinade to baste with while grilling.

Excellent marinade.  I only wished I had doubled the recipe for extra sauce.  I  used 3 tenderloins, so I didn't have any leftover sauce to serving. I received many compliments.

Very good.  I added chopped fresh rosemary and garlic.  Grill on medium low heat as you want some charing, but not too much.  The honey will burn leaving a lot of carbon if the heat is too high.  Keep brushing the marinade on throughout the cooking.

Have made this a couple of times.  I marinate it overnight and add some HorseRadish to the marinade for a little kick.  Haven't tried boiling the sauce for dipping but maybe I will given all the positive feedback from others

The best pork tenderloin I've ever had! I started them on the grill basting with reserved marinade(set aside before marinating)and finished them in the oven wrapped in foil. I served them with a light sweet potato casserole also taken from this site and it was a super spread!!! A+++

My whole family loved this one. I did not have access to a grill so I roasted it in the oven, making sure to brown the outside during the cooking process. It still came out tender and flavorful.

I took the advice of others and boiled the marinade to use as a sauce for the meat. With the addition of some apple cider vinegar it makes a fantastic salad dressing to use with the leftover meat.

Ok now I doing something that drives me crazy when others do it.  I didn't have all the correct stuff so I used what I had and I'm still rating it.  
I used honey, horseradish mustard, chili powder and a little extra prepared horseradish just to give it a little extra zing.  This is the 3rd tenderloin I've baked and by far the best, this was EXCELLENT.  It was SO tender and was sweet with a little heat!  I baked it with diced potoated seasoned with Ms Dash and EEVO, added whole mushrooms (seasoned the same) for the last 25 minutes.  Again this is a winner!!!  Thank You!

Followed recipe as directed.  Reserved about 1/4 C of marinade for basting.  Marinated for about 10 hours and grilled on our gas grill for about 30 minutes on LOW.  Very tender & tasty, although I think I would like a bit more kick.  Next time I may try increasing chili powder, perhaps a dash of cayenne?  The leftovers will make great sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing this simple & delicious recipe.

NOTE: This review was accidentally put under Grilled Pork Tenderloin - I forgot it was the Tangy that I ended up going with.  My kids HATE pork, and they loved this.  That makes two successful pork dishes I've prepared from this site!  What can I say?  If I can hit another winner with the One Hundred One Year Old Pastry Recipe from this site, today, I'm setting All Recipes as my home page!!  This pork tenderloin was exremely flavorful, both with or without the extra sauce for dipping.  Highly recommend.

Easy and yummy. This has a different flavor that my husband and I really enjoyed. It was a bit too cold to use the grill today so I broiled in the oven and it was great.I used a spicy honey mustard instead of Dijon. Will make again!

I asked my  DH  what he thought after a couple of bites.   He said it is different, i knew that was not good.  Then he said the first thing that he thought is,  it tasted like  Hot Dogs.   That did it, he is right, I will not make again.   The only thing I did different  was I added some garlic.  There  are so many good  Pork tenderloin recipes out there, i will try more of them.

OMG!!!! It was amazing the kids and I absolutely love it! My three year old usually leaves the meat on his plate unless its a hotdog. Both kids ate it all and asked for more. I am so happy I made this tonight. This recipe is a keeper. My mouth is still watering.

This was good. Followed the recipe exactly, except I baked at 400 instead of grilling. There was not as much of a mustard taste as I expected. Taste was mild/a bit bland.

This was so delicious! My husband, a non-pork tenderloin person, couldn't stop eating it! I boiled the marinade, as others suggested, with some chicken broth, for about 40 min. to kill bacteria, & it turned out fantastic. The marinade smelled too good to just throw out :) This is a definite keeper. I am going to try this marinade with salmon soon!

This recipe was great! I followed the recipe, except I did add 3 garlic cloves because I LOVE garlic in every other dish I make. I baked it in the oven (425F, about 30 minutes) and served it over rice. I made the the recipe in advance and froze the pork and marinade together. I took it out of the freezer and put into the fridge the night before so that it marinated during the day. I'll try to keep one in the freezer for a quick weeknight dinner.

This recipe is an instant favorite!  I am not a pork person, but we found a tenderloin that was really cheap.  So, we decided to look for a recipe that looked good.  This is so simple, yet so delicious!  I didn't have a regular grill, so I used my George Foreman Grill.  I'm glad I did, because the searing you get on a grill really enhances the marinade.

This was great! My grill isn't ready so I baked 40 minutes at 400, based on other readers' suggestions. Would definitely make again.

Didn't have quite enough honey, so added a  little honey dijon mustard too.  Like others, increased the amount of chili powder.  Marinated 4 hours, then grilled on indirect heat.  They were perfect!!!  Everyone raved, this will be added to the regular meals.

This was an awesome and easy dish to prepare.  I took other reviewer comments and turned leftover marinade into a sauce by boiling it and adding chicken stock.  Highly recommend turning once in cooking and recoating surface to get crispy glaze to cover entire tenderloin.

Fantastic... I did this recipe exactly as it stated and it was awesome on the pork tenderloin, and bbq'd it. The BBQ gave it a really nice flavour.   I also used it on boneless, skinless chicken thighs and baked them in the oven and got the same result. Just awesome.  This is a staple recipe in my kitchen now! Thanks so much for this easy but incredibly tasty recipe!

Wow! Definitely boil the leftover marinade and use it as a sauce. Make sure if you grill to cook it on the top rack rather than right over the flame or the outside will burn like mine did, but it was still wonderful. Imagine if I had cooked it right the first time!

Sauce was good, though it didn't penetrate into the meat.  My 12 and 14 year olds didn't care for it but it was ok.

This is as good as everyone says. The grilling probably added to the flavor, moist too. Served it with sweet potatoes. The yummiest yet easiest dinner I ever made without much work.

The tenderloin was awesome ! I cooked the marinate and brushed some on while it was grilling , and then served the rest over the sliced up pork on the serving plate. Great presentation and wonderful flavor !! I warmed up the leftovers the next day and it wasn't dried out!! Thanks for a great recipe ! I'll be making this often.

Great recipe.  I brought the marinade to a boil and used it while the tenderloin was cooking as well as a sauce that guests spooned onto their servings. Turned out really good.  Will be making again.

I made this for Father's Day and it was awesome!  One thing that was quite different was that it only took 10 minutes on our grill.  I marinaded it over night and I think that added to the tenderness.  I also added a little minced garlic because I love garlic, and a few crushed red pepper flakes.  This is a keeper.  We will definately make this again.  If you are looking for a yummy side dish for this, I made mushroom hazelnut rice pilaf from this site with it.  That dish was awesome too!

This was very easy and very good.  As recommended in other reviews, I added two cloves of minced garlic to the marinade and marinated for about 4-5 hours.  I also added a cup of chicken stock to the left over marinade and boiled to use as a dipping sauce.  I will also add that the tenderloins took longer than I expected to get up to temperature.

Followed recipe exactly.  My husband liked it but felt that the marinade did not give meat quite enough flavour.  I thought the taste was fine, although meat did not come out as tender as I would have hoped.  My four year old did not care for it too much.

This was really good and super easy. I ended up marinating for 24hrs because I started it in the morning and then my Husband came home and had already eaten. This I'm sure just made it better. I'm sure I will be making this regualry.

This is one of the best bar-b-qued pork recipes I've tasted yet.  We cut a 9 lb pork loin into 1/3's and then sliced it down the middle, length ways.  Marinaded as the directions said but I was out of honey so I tried light Karo syrup.  When we removed meat to bar-b-que, I also added about 1 cup chicken broth and cornstarch to the marinade and boiled until thickened.  We bar-b-qued it on medium low, direct heat for 30 minutes basting it with the boiled left over marinade.  Then used the left over marinade for dipping sauce.  Every one of us enjoyed this tendor, juicy, and very flavorful main course.  I served with sweet corn and seansoned tater tots for the kids.  Was a wonderful meal!

Oh my gosh...this was soooo good and sooo easy! Thank you for the recipe. I didn't change a thing. The only suggestion I would have is to save the marinade after you put the pork on the grill. Boil the marinade to kill any bacteria, then use it as a dipping sauce. It is soooooo delicious!

I have made this recipe twice now and love the tang. I actually use this as a marinade for boneless tenderloin chops and make them on the grill. I love it and will make the marinade many times.

Super easy and super delicious.  I intended on using our pork tenderloin (a bit over a pound) for 2 nights' worth of dinner.  However, the taste of the pork was superb as a result of this marinade, and my husband and I (and our 2 dogs received scraps) wound up eating the entire thing!  I added about a tsp. worth of chili powder, as we like our food with a bit of kick.

I was a little bit skeptical because this recipe calls for so much dijon mustard, which I don't usually like. If you don't like dijon like me, don't worry. This recipe is delicious. And you can shred the leftovers for sandwiches with a kick the next day.

My family loved this recipe- the tenderloin was so moist- I did not have the dijon mustard so I used honey mustard and some horseradish so give it some kick- FABULOUS!!!

A great recipe, and super easy.  I used more chili powder than called for, and also added garlic powder and soy sauce.  Turned out very tender.

I have become a recent crockpot convert, and so I decided to try out this recipe a la crockpot.  I salted and peppered the 3 lb. tenderloin, then seared it in a frypan with a little olive oil.  After it got a nice brown color, I poured all the recipe ingrediants (heavy on the chili powder) into the crockpot and let it go on low for about 6 hours.  The texture of the meat was strandy and pull-apart tender, which is obviously different than it would be if you just grilled the meat.  But the taste was good.  I'm used to some kind of acid being in the marinade that I use (e.g., vinegar or citrus juice), so I might try to add something along those lines next time.  Actually, the primary purpose of the acid in marinade is to break down some of the protein in the meat to make it more tender, and this meat was REALLY tender without that.  Still, I like the piquant flavor an acid adds to a main dish, so that's what I'll try next time.  Otherwise, really quite good.  Thanks!

This marinade is absolutely delicious.  Made it tonight for a party.  I took some other reviewers suggestions and added a little minced garlic and used cayenne pepper verses chili powder.  I took the marinade from the bag and boiled it so if someone wanted to add a little more after the pork was cooked we had it ready and safe to eat.  Thank you for sharing will definitely make again.

Made this last night for the second time but instead of pork used chicken and it was delicious!  Shared it with my neighbor and she loved the marinade.

Made this tonight. Husband loved itt. So did I. Made to almost exactly,  it used a few dashes of cayenne instead of chili powder. Bought the chili powder, but couldnot get the darn thing open! It was delicious. We did cook it a bit longer, since it was quite thick at one end. Will definitely make again. Easy and delicious. What more to ask?

I made this for a football party on our patio last night and got universal rave reviews.  I followed the directions and made no changes except the meat marinated for about 7 hours.  Whether that was responsible for the incredibly tender meat or not I don't know, but I will most certainly make it again for another party next week.  This is so easy to prepare and oh so good to eat - a winner in all respects.

I've made this recipe twice now.  The first time I had a used a good quality tenderloin but the second time I bought my meat from Costco and it was tough - lesson learned.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add garlic and as other reviewers suggested, I boiled the marinade and used it to baste while cooking and to serve along side the meat.  Very tasty and easy & I'll definitely make it again.

This marinade made for a good sauce.  I cooked it down and poured it over the pork.  I marinaded the pork for almost 24 hours (on accident).  I didn't notice any difference in the taste with the pork alone.  But, again, the sauce made this really good.  Thanks!

This is awesome. I used  a one pound top loin roast, cut into one inch thick slices. Using a fork, I pierced them well before adding the sauce, marinated them 20 hours, and turned them several times. As the recipe calls for  2 pounds of pork, I had ample marinade and reserved some to use as a serving sauce, and am very glad I did. Delicious! It was very tender and extremely flavorful. When I make this again, I will reduce the honey as we found it a bit too sweet. Can't wait to try it with other pork cuts and perhaps chicken.

Good but not great.  Found it lacked any punch  perhaps replacing the plain Dijon mustard with a more hearty country style Dijon will do it.  Would go that route if I decide to make it again.

Even my super-picky 4 year old loved it and raved about it. We grilled ours, as called for in the recipe. It took longer than 25 minutes, but it was our first time grilling this cut off meat, so we were being extra careful.

This was a great way to cook a flavorful pork loin. I used a 2.25 pound roast and I marinaded it in a plastic bag. I put the honey, dijon and chili powder and salt in a plastic bag and then added the uncooked pork. Once I made sure it was well coated with the marinade I let it sit in the fridge for 3 hours. We then cooked it on the grill. However, instead of discarding the liquid we rubbed it on the pork while it was cooking to baste the pork. I think it added more flavor. When the  pork was no longer pink inside we sliced it and it had a wonderful flavor. I served it with black beans and rice and a salad. There were hardly any leftovers. I will make this again.

The basics are sufficient for a very nice recipe.  Mustard, Salt, Honey.  Easy to adjust with other herbs and spices to each preferred taste.  I suggest that the great majority of people use their ovens in the kitchen rather than the out door grill.  Perhaps some tips on providing a tasty surface crunch before savoring the succulent insides.  I always use a cast iron skillet with a little oil to seize the meats.  I do not rush this as I watch the magic of the foundry seasoned pan do its work.

I have made this recipe twice, following the directions exactly, and it is awesome!  I put it on the grill, but used a roasting pan instead of putting it right on the grate.  It makes a nice centerpiece for a holiday or company dinner and is so easy!

After making this recipe once, I agree it was too sweet. So, I decided on the second attempt to simply add a touch more dijon mustard (maybe another tablespoon full) and that seem to balance the sweet and sour taste better than the 1/2 cup dijon as recommended. Naturally, taste is in the tongue of the beholder and some may like it sweeter. However, the second attempt got very good reviews from our dinner guest.

Made this tonight and it was fantastic! Heated grill to high, cooked 5 minutes, turned over for 5 more minutes. Turned grill to medium low then put tenderloins on upper rack to finish cooking with indirect heat, again 5 minutes each side for a total of 20. They came out succulent and perfect. So good. Used honey mustard instead of dijon, and still came out great. Served with sweet potato fries, asparagus and the 'simple arugula salad' recipe from this site. Delish, delish. Company worthy.

very yummy!  I used chipotle chili powder instead of regular chili powder to raise the spice level.  Also added some garlic powder.  The pork was very juicy and had a very nice taste (the people who said it was dry maybe grilled it directly instead of using indirect heat? )  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and heated the leftover marinade to a boil and added some white wine to thin it out and served this over the sliced pork--very good!

Thanks to a few reviewers which helped me make this an awesome dish.  I gave 5 stars because of how quick and yummy it is.  I used equal parts honey and dijon and did add more chili's (to mine and dh).  I marinaded it while it was thawing in the sink in the ziploc for approx 6 hours. Used a grill pan to sear it on high heat until it was all brown (approx 5 mins).  Remaining marinade I boiled and reduced and added white wine (as was suggested).  After searing I put in a roast pan in oven at 400 with some marinade/sauce (just a little) and added some water. Cooked for 15 mins uncovered.  Took out and tented with foil for another 5mins.  I cut medalions and poured some sauce on top.  So tender and yummy!  Perfectly done!  Dh loved it!....so did the kids!  No leftovers.  Definitely a new recipe for the rotation.  Thanks for all the tips!

This was absolutly outstanding.  I have NEVER grilled before.  I was extremly careful.  Follwed the directions of another and kept the marinate and boiled it to use it to basting.  Used indirect heat and turned every 10 minutes.  It came out juicy and perfect.  We are so going to use this recipe again and agin....Thank You so much.

This took way longer over indirect grill heat than noted. In my attempt to save dinner, I cooked it over direct heat which charred the exterior. I rated a 4 under the assumption that if I would've had another 30 minutes or so to grill over indirect heat the flavor would've been good. Based on the actual flavor I got over direct heat, I would've given it a 3.

Delicious. I used garlic salt instead of table salt. Baked for 35 min. @ 450 w/ marinade. Then cooked sauce w/ chicken broth and corn starch. Fantastic served with rice.

I thought this was pretty good but like others, I thought it needed more chili powder, as well as garlic, otherwise it was too sweet yet bland.

My kids loved this. I rated it four stars because I liked it better fresh and didn't think the leftovers were that great. Though they would probably be great in a salad.

My granddaughter asks me to make this when she visits. I do add 1 tsp. of chili powder to offset the sweetness. I've grilled and cooked in then oven and it comes out great either way. I always boil the marinade and use it to baste the meat. A regular in my cooking rotation.

The marinade was very good but I could not get my pork to cook properly.  I grilled it for over 30 minutes and it was still completely raw inside.  I finally had to cut the pork into medallions to get it to cook enough to eat it.  The pork wound up dry.  My husband and I agreed that grilling this for 5-10 minutes to get that smoky flavor and then finishing this in the oven would be a better method.

I was looking for a new way to make a pork tenderloin and this was it! I didn't have any dijon mustard so I used some dusseldorf mustard that I had. I also added some minced garlic. I took other reviewers suggestions and boiled the remaining marinade to serve on the side as dipping sauce. Really tender and flavorful! Thanks for the recipe.

OH YUM! If you are looking for something simple, healthy and delicious look no further. I never thought it could taste so good. Of course I had to do my own thing....1st I cut the tenderlion into pork tips 2nd I used Grey Poupon Honey Dijon with Coarsely Ground Mustand 3rd I marinated it for 2 days 4th Made pork skewers and alternated sweet vidalia onion and orange slices. I would reccomend this for anyone who likes pork!

The flavor was great, but boiling the marinade and drizzling over the meat before serving is a must, or I think the flavor would have been too mild.  Great variation for pork!

My failure with this was my own fault.  I put tenderloin and marinade in the oven.  The marinade burned to the pan, and the tenderloin was good, but not great.

LOVE IT!!  We make this often.  Even in the  winter we bake it in the oven with potatoes.  The potatoes take on the flavor too.  It is best on the grill but we like it both ways.

Yum. Flavor balance was perfect, pork was so tender.  I baked it in the oven on 400 until the meat thermometer read 140.  The 3-year old asked for seconds.  Will make this again and again.

We didn't find anything tangy, sweet, spicy or anything exciting with this marinade.  I marinaded it all day & grilled it.  The pork was good but the marinade was so mild flavored we couldn't even really taste it.  I guess I like a little more "bang" when I marinate something.  Thanks anyway.

This was a big hit on Father's Day.  It was very tender and had great flavor.  Many people asked for the recipe prior to leaving.  Most said they wouldn't have even tried this recipe due to the chili powder, but you can't even taste it.  It's a keeper!

I made this recipe as is and found it very tender and tasty. I kept some of the sauce aside instead of using it with the meat and I heated it with melted butter as the meat finished grilling. To serve I sliced the pork in thin slices and drizzled the sauce over top. This was very enjoyable and I will definitely make it again.

I have wanted to fix this recipe for about a week or so and finally got around to it today.  Wish I had done it sooner.  YUM!! YUM!!  I really like pork and this really gives it a good flavor.  The pork was so tender you didn't need a fork.  I marinated mine for about 6 hours.  Also put a clove of garlic in the marinade.  Wonderful.  My husband loved it.  Had it with rice and green beans.  A wonderful meal.  Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this recipe and it was a hit. I followed the recipe exactly. However, due to a downpour I had to change plans and use the oven instead of the grill. I followed other reviewer's idea and baked at 425 for 40 minutes. The meat was tender and delicious. This will be made often. Thanks for a great new way to cook a pork tenderloin.

THis was good, will probably make again. It just was missing some pizzazz-I only marinated it for 4 hours, will try and marinate overnight next time.

Terrific recipe.  I too marinated it overnight, poking with fork to be sure it penetrated.  I also boiled left over marinade with a little chicken stock and served as sauce.  Hubby went wild !

This recipe was excellent. I used pork chops instead of pork tenderloin. The only thing I would probably change is use a little less honey and add cayanne pepper to give it some zing. Otherwise, excellent, cannot go wrong making it as is. Will DEFINITELY make this again and again

This is so good!  I like to marinate it overnight to really let the flavors meld together and when it's comes off the grill, it's so tasty and tender.  I make it for company quite often and it's never disappointed me.

simple and delicious. a real break-thru for me and pork. I used half the amount of marinade and it turned out just fine. When all the juices are smooshing around in the zip-lock bag, the meat doesn't really need to be swimming - just covered.

I baked this and it didn't end up with as much flavor as I would have liked.  Next time I'll make more marinade, add a little chicken broth and reduce for a sauce.  Also will increase chili powder a little.  Cook only to 150 degrees and let sit for 10 minutes to let juices redistribute.
Thanks for sharing!

The recipe was OK, but I really didn't taste anything special eventhough I marinated the pork for 8 hours.  It was really juicy though!

Loved this recipe.  I did not have time to marinade and the taste was still wonderful.  My only change was that I used Chipolte Chili Powder instead of plain.  Made with Restaurant-Style Hashbrown Casserole & Herbed Mushrooms with White Wine from this site.  Thank you!!!!

Thanks for such an easy tasy recipe.  I have not up till now found a pork dish my honey likes.  This one got a thumbs up and said I could make it again.  I always tweak or change recipes ever so slightly.  For this one I substituted half the honey for peach jam that I have an over abundance of.  I also increased the chili powder to 1 tsp.  I marinated for a day and a half.  Coated them in a little dusting of flour and pan sauteed (planned on grilling but the weather didn't cooperate).  They were to die for and will keep this recipe in the permanant file.  I love pork but my honey doesn't and for 7 years I have been looking for a recipe we both would enjoy.  I can't thank you enough for the recipe.

My DH is a chef so when I attempt to cook, I am always nervous that it will pale compared to his creations.  But we LOVED this recipe!  It was a bit sweet, like a honey baked ham, so next time I might put horseradish or cayenne pepper in the marinade to give it a kick (we're not big into sweet stuff).  

I ended up having to grill it for nearly an hour (think I had the grill too low) but at the end we turned it up to med-high and made the outside edges a little crusty.  SOOOO good that we served it for our next dinner party, because the bulk of the work was done the night before.

I used this recipe over pork chops and it was fantastic. I replaced the salt with Mrs. Dash and I sprinkled the chili powder and Mrs. Dash on the pork chops and then poured the honey-mustard mix over the chops.  I grilled the chops up on my George Foreman grill and the family RAVED. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was delicious.  I marinated the pork for about 5 hrs then cooked exactly according to recipe.  The marinade gave just the perfect amount of flavor - not too overpowering.  I would definitely recommend it!

I took this recipe and modified it a little adding a few things.  I used cumin, cayanne and some ground dried ginger.  I also added a little fresh orange juice and used it to coat the pork loin.  I marinated it in the fridge for about 2 hours then i cooked it on the grill using indirect heat for 2 hours and for the last 10 minutes i put it over the flame for a little crunch on the skin.  Completely awesome, it didnt last long at all and the meat came out super flavorful!

This was fantastic and wonderfully simple.  I marinated the tenderloin over night and it came out moist and tender, the soft sweetness of the honey having seeped all the way through.  It is something that I will definitely be adding to my regular rotation.

Even with double the amount of chili powder, this is still just plain old honey-mustard pork.

This recipe was very good and I'd make it again - the tenderloin turned out very tender.  It ended up that we didn't have dijon mustard so we had to use honey mustard so the marinade/sauce was much sweeter than intended but it was still really good.  Our BBQ wouldn't light (too cold outside) so we had to bake it in the oven and we baked it in some of the marinade and it turned out really well.   We will make again for sure.

I added extra chili powder and a good splash of E. NC bbq sauce to loosen the marinade a bit. I heated up the marinade as well and used it as a sauce. This was delicious and will be a monthly meal at least!

This was FANTASTIC!  Made exactly as directed, but it took longer to cook than the recipe said - about twice the amount of time specified.

Will definitely make this again and reserve a little of the marinade before adding the meat to it, to use as a dipping sauce!

Good recipe as a start. Like others, I upped the seasonings to about 3/4 tsp each and added the same of garlic powder.

The only thing I did was add a little garlic because I put  garlic in everything.  This recipe is so easy and yet so  unbelievably yummy. I have a picky eater. No not your normal picky eater. I 
 mean he's 16 and likes to cook and still eats very few things and he loves this roast.  We always cook it in the oven at 400 and it has been perfect everytime.  We eat with with mashed potatoes and peas because that's what my son likes.  Thank you for this awesome recipe!

EZ, quick and tasty. I gently brought the marinade to a boil to serve as a sauce for the finished product.

This was excellent I did not change anything in the recipe at all...it was so tender....just perfect.  I must admit I think I will add a tinge more chili powder  next time just to give a little bit more zip.  (but in some flavors I do love a bit more hot)
So easy and absolutely loved it.  I would definitely makes this again.  Carole

I have tried many tenderloin recipes looking for the best. Last night, after 2 bites, my husband said “you found it”. Guess that is the true test. Given it is cold outside, I cooked it in the oven at 400 until it reached 145 degrees. I’m now going to delete all the other tenderloin recipes from my page

Glad others enjoyed this.  I marinated 24 hours, but this was  disappointing.   Hubs and I agreed it was ok but we enjoy other recipes for pork better, so I'm not likely to make again.

This is such a great recipe and the only way I have done pork tenderloin since I tried it. I marinade for about 20 hours and I make extra sauce on the side to baste the tenderloin a couple times near the end of grilling.

For me, there was nothing really memorable about this recipe.    The meat turned out to be very moist and tender, but the flavour was just OK.  I prefer foods that taste bolder, more savoury and spicy.  This was on the very mild, but still nice tasting.  I let the meat marinate overnight but even that extra time didn't really do anything to season the pork to taste any richer.  Good recipe for the middle of the road person who doesn't like spice, or if you're cooking for your average family.

Wow, really good and easy. I just threw all the ingredients into a crock pot on high for 4 - 5 hours and it was amazing (I didn’t even marinate first).Was a bit sweet for me, so I might try a little less honey next time, but everyone else thought it was perfect.

Had to cook it in the oven due to weather. Wished U had boiled marinade and basted it while cooking. Still, it was very moist. Took the leftovers the next day, sliced it up and put in pan with a new batch of marinade and cooked it with it. Very very good!!!!!

Made it exactly as the recipe but baked at 375 instead of grilling, so no char, but absolutely great taste.  Will make again and we shared with friends who also couldn't get enough.

Simple marinade that was delicious. I always grill my tenderloin for 16 minutes (4 minutes on each side) and it comes out perfect.

Quick and easy with great flavor.  I  like to buy a pork loin when on sale and keep in freezer for meals on busy nights, pull out day before to thaw in a marinade and it works great!

Didn’t put chilie powder in because making for a four year old that doesn’t like ANY spices the pork loin came out very flavorful and I made it in a smoker on 220 degrees for 5 1/2 hours until it reached 175 internally. I like honey mustard mixture and this as delicious, family enjoyed it too my daughter cleaned her plate and had seconds.

We use a smoker and always looking for warm up ideas! This is so easy, moist. Sliced pork and marinade 4 hours. Simmer an hour and done! Serve with fried broccoli!

Hubby liked this one!!!!!

This recipe was easy and tasted great! The only change I made was instead of pork tenderloin, I used chicken breast halves. I sealed them in a Ziploc and left them to marinate over night. 

My wife and kids loved every bite!

Only thing I differed on was the cooking method.  I marinated it for 4 hours, browned all four sides on a very hot oiled skillet and put it in the oven at 400 for 30 minutes uncovered.  Since my tenderloin was only 2-3 inches in diameter, it didn't take as long as it might for a thicker piece of meat.  I then let the pork rest for 10 minutes, sliced and served with rice and brussels sprouts.   I do agree that the marinade should be boiled on the stovetop and served for those wanting gravy.  It was very good and now I know how to make a great pork tenderloin.  Thank you to the individual who posted this terrific recipe.

I didn't have soy sauce for one of my regular pork marinades so I tried this and I will definitely use this recipe again.  We boiled the leftover marinade down and drizzled it over top of the pork and it was very good.  I'm going to try minced garlic in the marinade the next time, but it's great as is and very easy.

Marinated it for a few hours. 
Sauce was great even with leftovers.
Baked it in the oven and was very tender.

Well, it's obvious that different people have different tastes.  I made it exactly as the recipe said but neither my husband or I liked it.  I'm just glad I hadn't made it for company.  We ate some of it but fed most of it to the dog. (Without the sauce of course)

Made it just like recipe.  But marinated overnight.

It was very moist, even with leftovers a few days later.  Not a lot of honey mustard flavor in meat but anything that keep the meat moist is a big plus.

Loved the recipe.  Took a chance and made it the first time for company.  Rave reviews.  Baked it in the oven at 425 for 30 minutes.  Would recommend lining the baking pan with heavy duty foil for ease in cleaning dish.
Can't wait to make it again.

Good, but I think marinating it during grilling would have helped. It was hard to taste the honey or mustard.

This was OK, but, even though I marinaded it for over 24 hours,  there wasn't a lot of flavor.  I've used other marinades to greater effect,  so I doubt if I'll use this again.

This pork loin melted in our mouths; crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. It did require more time than mentioned; but grill heat varies; so that could account for the difference. I paired this with Brazilian rice and it was a lovely combo. Definitely will repeat this one.

Used the marinade on boneless pork chops instead of a loin. Soaked all day, then grilled slowly over low heat. Meat stayed super tender and moist.  We'll definitely be repeating this one!

This was tasty and unbelievably easy.  It did, however, need the remaining marinade as a a sauce.  Next time, I will definitely boil the leftover marinade and spoon it over the sliced pork.

I was SOOOO excited to see a marinade (especially for pork) that does not contain soy! Perfect amount of ingredients for a great marinade! Thank you! Turned out great...especially following a suggestion to freeze in ziplock, and cook when ready.

I was disappointed in this recipe. I marinated the pork for over 8 hours, even piercing it with the fork to try and let it soak in more of the flavor, but it still tasted bland. It looks like the majority of people who enjoyed it cooked it in the oven, so it must retain more of the flavor when cooked that way. I would not make this again.

I'm sure it would have been good as a tenderloin but I just used the sauce on pork chops - it tasted wonderful.  I would cook this again and possibly make the tenderloin next time.

This is the best basic recipe for marinating a tenderloin.  So many ways to change it up to suit your specific taste.  Try backing out of the honey and use some lemon juice in place of the dijon, but as is it works well.  Pork and dijon were made for each other.  I did just that,  backed out of the dijon and honey just a bit, added 1/4 cup lemon juice and used a single Chipotle pepper with a teaspoon of the adobo sauce in place of the chile powder.  Marinated 6 hours. Unbelievable flavor!!
Always take advantage of the grill time.  I like to grill corn on the cob with this tenderloin recipe. Try this... soak the corn,  unshucked in whole milk at least overnight but 48 hours is even better.  Throw them on the grill unshucked. The soaking keeps them from burning.  When the husks begin to turn dark and burn,  they are done.  Shuck,  add salt and pepper and butter.  Enjoy!!

I don't like mustard, but I loved this. I followed a suggestion by another reviewer and added chopped garlic to marinade. I also baked in oven at 400° for about 40 minutes as others suggested.

I only marinated the tenderloin for an hour (forgot to get it ready), and it was very flavorful!  I poked it all over with a fork before adding the marinade, added a clove of garlic, and doubled the chili powder.  I baked it in the oven at 400 for 25 min, and let it rest about 10 min before slicing.  I only made 1 tenderloin, so I halved all the ingredients.  I have to admit, when I was putting the marinade together, I was questioning why I wanted to try this recipe because I thought the ingredients seemed like they would be gross together - I was very wrong!

It's okay.  It didn't "wow" me at all, but it didn't suck, either.  It's just okay.  It is quick, and it is easy...just don't expect it to be a show-stopper by any stretch.

This was excellent. The only change I made was to sprinkle the loin with a pork/beef seasoning as I cooked it. Served with the 'cooked' sauce and grilled on my Hasty Bake Grill (charcoal).

Taste was good but it didn't soak thru the whole roast - 12 hours marinating in the fridge.

Make this for a small cookout and we all loved it!  Very easy to make, with ingredients on hand.  The flavor was nice, a little bit of spice from the chili powder went well with the sweeter honey flavor.  I only had time to marinade for 2 hours, and I saved a small amount of sauce to baste while grilling.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I thought this was good. It is pretty much honey mustard. Not really tangy... I used it for pork chops.  I think it would have been better had I marinated it longer.  The outside pieces were good, but the inside was just okay.  I'll probably do it again, but marinate overnight.

This recipe was FANTASTIC. I cut my pork in thin strips. Added minced ginger/garlic/chili. Didn't marinade. Used the marinade ingredients as a sauce instead. Added red peppers & onion & served over rice. Was absolutely delicious. Will make this recipe again and again and AGAIN...

This is an awesome recipe for pork tenderloin marinade.  I did poke holes in the tenderloin with a fork. Yes, it was tender and delicious.  Served with grilled zucchini.

This turned out absolutely delicious. The seasoning is a perfect balance of tangy and robust. Definitely making this again. I used my gas oven to cook this at 550 degrees for 11 minutes (5.5 minutes per pound), then turned off the heat and let it remain in the oven for an additional hour before serving. It turned out perfect!

I started to marinade some pork with pineapple juice and decided to look for some ideas; came across this recipe and YUMMY! Followed the directions with the exception of the pineapple juice instead of honey. Can't wait to try it with honey next time. So easy and flavorful! Thanks so much Sadie!

This is a great recipe, very tasty!  And oh so easy! I make it in a ziploc bag and stick in the fridge overnight - or until the next day's dinner.  I've separated some of the marinade and used it for veggies too.

We loved this. Cooked it on the grill after marinating nearly a day. Outside crusty by searing for awhile and inside was sweet and juicy. Served it with (God forbid) barbecue sauce and would do that again. Served it with great Buttermilk coleslaw recipe found on Allrecipes.com , which s now my standard coleslaw recipe.

This wasn't too bad.  My husband thought it was delicious, my kids gobbled it right down and I thought it was okay.  I didn't add the entire 2/3 of honey so it wouldn't be so sweet and I substituted with spicy brown mustard instead of Dijon.  I didn't grill it either but baked it at 350 for an hour.  Turned out tender and moist.

This was good but does that have the WOW factor.  instead it has the been there done that factor.  I would not go out of my way to make it or buy ingredients but if it was the only thing that I could make I would...if that makes sense.  I added garlic like others suggested and I did cook it over indirect heat.  It needs a bit more flavor.

Outstanding marinade! I was short this time...only let it marinade for 3 hours. Next time it will be overnight. Served with cornbread and baked beans. It was a great, hearty summer night feast. Can't wait to do it again!!!

Great Flavor! I didn't have alot of dijon mustard so I used 1/2 maille's dijon and 1/2 hellman's "dijonaise" and added about a tsp of minced garlic.  Grilled for time said and it was delicious!  Not one bite left!

Great and so easy!  I did increase the chili powder slightly.  I think I will try a spicey brown mustard for something different next time.

I marinated this overnight after puncturing the meat all over with a fork. Grilled it for about 30 minutes and it turned out perfect!

Family loved it.  Boiled remaining sauce and poured over sliced pork just before serving.  Will increase chili to 1/2 teaspoon next time.  Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent marinade and so very simple. The trick is to plan ahead and marinate overnight. Next time, I'm going to add some fresh garlic to the marinage. Thanks for sharing!

Very good.  Big hit with company.  It took much longer to cook than recipe stated on grill, but I cooked on very low heat, and basted with remaining marinade.

I found this recipe to be a bit bland.  
The outside is tastie, but the meat itself either needs more salt.  I followed the recipe exactly ..marinated it for 8 hours.. turning it often and while grilling, i regularly basted the meat.  I think it needs more salt and garlic would help along.

So good and so easy.  I used regular mustard and a dash of mayo because that's what I had on hand and it was delicious.  Thank you for sharing.  I will make this again.

Very easy and delicious. I kept the leftover marinade to rub on the pork while it was cooking. I added some cayenne pepper to the marinade for a kick, too.

My roommate and I really enjoyed this with our Foreman Grill. Beware of blackening the top of thick pieces, may need to be split for more even grilling. DELICIOUS and HEALTHY in 3oz. portions.

I used what I had which was no honey and no dijon mustard.  I used French's honey mustard, added soy sauce and replaced the salt with garlic salt and onion salt.  It has been so hot that I grilled this at 8:00 a.m. and then refrigerated it.  It was great cold.  I took the left over marinade, boiled it for 10 minutes and added a little tomato based bbq sauce and served it over the meat and brown rice.  I'll try it again when I have all the right stuff.

I wasn't sure this would work because I don't like Dijon mustard or chili powder, and my boyfriend doesn't like honey or Dijon mustard. Once it was cooked, we both loved it! Just sweet enough for me and just tangy enough for him - tender and juicy inside!
