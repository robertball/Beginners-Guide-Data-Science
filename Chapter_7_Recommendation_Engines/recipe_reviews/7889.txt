Maybe it was just me, but I followed this recipes to a T.  The mix wouldnt pour so I added more milk (making it 1 cup for each of the batters instead of 2/3 cup).  Also, the four layers were short and too much.  I recommend just making two layers..putting all of the gold in one and all the silver in another.

I made this for my mother's 85th birthday.  It's a BIG cake, but a great choice for a special occasion!  The only suggestion I would make would be to add a little yellow food coloring to the "gold" layers.  Mine didn't come out very yellow.  I used a whip cream type frosting and it was wonderful!  Everyone LOVED it!  It is a very magestic creation.  Definitely worth the effort.

I didn't like this one very much.  I tried making it twice and it just didn't turn out.  Very dry.  This could be my fault.  I don't have a flour sifter, so I just fluff the flour in a bowl with a fork for 10 minuites or so.  Maybe I'll try it again when I get a sifter.

Really yummy, but HUGE!  Needs to be in at least 9" pans; the 8" ones I used made it the size and shape of a top hat!
A very rich cake.  Lovely with a frosting of cream (~ 1 pint) whipped with 1 tablespoon brown sugar or treacle.

I thought this was a very lovely cake.  It tasted great and the layers were nice and even.  Only complaint was that the gold cake was barely yellow.

The batter for this cake was very difficult to work with. When it came out of the oven, the layers were so crumbly that three of the four fell apart trying to get them onto the cooling rack.

While tasty, this cake was so difficult to manage (even for a non-novice baker) that I will not use this recipe again.

Quite nice, I took the two halves as two separate cakes to a shared lunch and they didn't last long.  The cakes do end up quite similar in colour so add colouring if you want a difference.

I have made this cake a few times. It is really good and basic. Recently I made this cake for my brother's birthday, and added peanut butter filling, and vanilla pudding. It was amazing.

This is a delightful cake.  I agree it's a HUGE cake!  I felt like I was building the Eiffel tower or something. It would make a great choice for a large family gathering or some other celebration. I agree, the the color differential wasn't obvious. Using yellow food coloring to accentuate the "gold" would be a great idea. Lovely cake. I had no trouble working with it-other than worrying how I was going to cover it with a normal cake cover. I ended up using foil.
