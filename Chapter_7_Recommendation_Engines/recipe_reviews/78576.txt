I scaled this down to 4 servings. Half a cup of balsamic was WAY too much, and I even used white balsamic which is much more mellow-tasting. A cup and a half of red wine was also excessive, but I had to add it to dilute the overwhelming taste of vinegar. I have to admit, the broth turned out pretty well with a few minor adjustments, but there was just too much of it. I made this with sole, cod and shrimp.

Good recipe that will become a lenten favorite in our house.  (I used a combination of shrimp, tilapia, and little neck clams in place of the sole and lobster because they were freshest at my fish market, otherwise followed exactly.) It's nice served over a big scoop of homemade polenta.

I agree with Caroline C  the vinegar does need to be cut back.  This recipe makes a huge pot of stew it was more than enough for 8 people.  Very taste after a few adjustments.
