I didn't have any dijon mustard, so I used spicy brown mustard.  I also am cooking for 2, so I used it with a 1.5 pound ham steak, and pan fried it instead of putting it in the oven.  

Instructions for proper pan-frying: Put the ham in the pan, put the glaze on top, cook for 3 minutes, flip, put the glaze on top again for 3 minutes, flip one last time for 1-2 minutes - and you've got yummy ham steak!

Another good hint: If you have a meat thermometer, you can be sure that the pork is fully cooked at 165 degrees. :)

This was excellent. Everyone loved the sauce at Thanksgiving. Even my 7 year old and my 3 year old, who can both be very picky eaters.

This glaze is great.  I've made it twice now.  My BF who doesn't like dijon, even loves it.  It does not taste like mustard.  I like it because the leftovers aren't so sweet.  I don't like sweet ham in my eggs or scalloped potatoes and ham.  I don't change a thing!

Very good ham!  Even my fiance who doesn't like sweet tasting glazes, had 2 servings of this.  The Dijon added just enough spice to make it different.  Very easy to make also.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because my glaze became a little watery in the oven.  Wish it stuck to the ham a bit better.

Great glaze that had that real old-fashioned like mom used to make taste. It's a classic.

This ham turned out great, love the flavor.  I basted it several times during cooking time.  It took much longer because I was cooking a 12 pound ham.

This was good, but nothing special. I had a 6 lb ham so I increased the oven temp to 350 and baked for 60 minutes before applying the glaze, then baked another 15 minutes or so. I didn't think the glaze made a very good dipping sauce. So, if I were to make this again, I would cut the glaze ingredients in half and just use to baste the ham.

Very tasty!  I actually 'brushed' my glaze on quite often while the ham was cooking.  Only had full grain dijon on hand so used it.  I'm sure it would be wonderful serving the glaze on the side warmed up, but given we were having this with omelets and spinach salad, the brushed on glaze seemed to 'go better'!

My Husband loved this!!!!! I dont eat ham so I was worried it wouldnt be good but my hubby said It was super flavorful, and the glaze and the dijon is a good change from a regular honey baked ham. Ham was perfectly warmed throuh and I ended up pouring thre remaining of the glaze over the top of the ham which warmed up nicely(recipe made perfect amount of glaze) Plus it was super easy for me to make! I will definetly be making this again!!!

Sweet alternate, was looking for a ham sauce that didnt include a fruit. Enjoyed it, used it for a ham steak. Will make it thicker next time.

Very good! I love to cook with dijon mustard, it adds great flavor. It really helped to make the glaze not too sweet. Loved it!

This is the best glaze of a ham I've ever made.  A fantastic flavor and not too sweet and the mustard gives it a little twang.   My kids raved over this one.
