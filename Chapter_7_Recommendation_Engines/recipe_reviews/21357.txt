My (wonderful) Aunt used to make the BEST baked beans in the world.  Since loosing her to breast cancer last March, I have been on the prowl for a recipe close to hers.  This is somewhat close.  I'm positive that she added brown sugar (which I did not add) and bacon, which I did add.  This is a good recipe, I'm gonna play with it to see if I can get it right, the liquid smoke was very distinctive the next day, not bad, but noticable.  Thanks Bob!  Peace.

These were really good baked beans.  The second time (and every time since) that I made these, I added about 1/4 c. yellow mustard, 1/4 c. brown sugar, and some garlic powder.  Hubby loves it this way!

Very tasty! I halved this recipe and baked in a loaf pan. My only addition was 1/4 cup of shredded pork. Topped with 2 strips of bacon before cooking.

Awesome! This reminded me of a recipe my grandmother used to make.  She used to add bacon and brown sugar in addition to molasses and hers also took a long time to bake.  These were so good and I love the addition of liquid smoke. I will definitely use this recipe over the summer!

This is very tasty.  I think I used bush's baked beans (original) which already had some sugar in it and the recipe came out a bit too sweet for me.  Maybe I'll just use plain beans next time.  Regardless, the flavor was excellent.  I'll make again.

Thank you mom for such a good recipe. My family raved about how good these beans were. Suggestion: I used Sweet Baby Rays Bar B Que sauce. You can purchase it at any major supermaket. 
Enjoy!!!!

I thought the bake time was a lil off. Seems way to long. I took it out of the oven way before recommended bake time and it was still a bit mushy. The flavor was great though. I added cooked bacon towards the end. YUM! Will make again, but maybe a different brand of beans next time.

Everybody loved it!  Men said I was trying to take over their "baked beans titles".  It was really fun!  The only change I made was to add a tablespoon or two of regular yellow mustard. I got the idea after reading reviews.  Wonderful!

I like the flavor of these beans I followed the recipe to the t, but my beans seem pasty I am not sure what I did wrong. I only cooked them for 2 hours as suggested by an other reviewer but I still think I dried them out I will make again and not cook as long.

I used Bush's vegetarian baked beans because I wanted to be able to taste the flavor of the liquid smoke. Other beans had added hickory or bacon. The smoke flavor didn't come through at all. Even when I increased the liquid smoke. I followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1/4 cup mustard and brown sugar and garlic. But I thought it was too much mustard. Cooked all day in the slow cooker. I don't like soupy beans, glad I drained off the liquid in the canned beans first because the slow cooker made them too soupy even with draining. Doubt I would make these again. They weren't that more impressive than opening up a can of baked beans.

This didn't have enough beans for me, so I am rating what I did. I used 2 pork&beans undrained, 16oz size cans, 2 drained pinto beans, 2 drained dark red kidney beans and 1 can of refried beans. I used 3 medium onions, doubled the molasses and barbeque sauce (Kraft hot) and used 2 tsp of hickory smoke salt. Do not add any salt!  I didn't have any liquid. Cooked it all in a big bean pot and stirred every half hour. Total cooking time 2 1/2 hrs. on 325F.

These were fantastic. I thought they would taste too barbecuey and I don't like the barbecue flavor beans, but these turned out great and didn't taste like bbq at all. Sweet, very thick sauce. I mixed pinto beans with the pork and beans because I didn't have enough. Thanks Bob, these were great, I WILL make these again!

I make this recipe exactly as it stands.  I use Bush's vegetarian baked beans since my husband is a vegetarian.  I am asked all the time to bring these to family events.  I will say that I don't cook them longer than 2 hours....they seem to get dry after 2 hours.  Great!  Thanks for the recipe!

I guess that as an obsessive 'Heinz-baked-beans-on-everything' Brit, I like my BBs plain and simple. I can't really explain why I didn't like this; I think all the flavors were just 'too much' somehow. Thanks, anyway!

Excellent recipe.  Baked Beans have never been one of my favorites, so "4 Stars" is high praise coming from me.  As other reviewers have indicated, the hickory smoked flavor was excellent.  I used this as a nice side dish with fried chicken, cole slaw and biscuits.  Unless you don't care for the smokey flavor, you can't go wrong with this recipe.

Very Good!  I loved the deep BBQ/hickory taste.  Used store brand baked beans and cattleman's original BBQ sauce.  Tasted even better the next day!

These were good the first day, but great on the second! I live in France and was hoping to duplicate the US taste we love. I had to use a can of cassoulet (beans and sausages) since we can't get baked beans and homemade BBQ sauce...can't get that either. I did bring liquid smoke from the US and added bacon bits. Delicious!!

These beans were wonderful.  I made them last weekend for a big family cookout.  Everyone commented on how good they were.  They have that "cooked all day" flavor.  Yum!

I don't normally like baked beans.  As a matter of fact, I just DON'T like them.  But I made this recipe for the 4th of July, and couldn't get enough of them.  I did add garlic and I used extra spicey BBQ sauce.  It was the best dish at the picnic.

I will never top baked beans with bacon again.  These beans are really great.  We were having a bar-b-que and relatives can't eat onions. Will try next time with onions.  I'm sure they will be even better.  I did add 1 tablespoon of worcestershire sauce, just because my mother/grandmother always did.

I finally found a recipe close to the one my grandma used!  I did add brown sugar (cause I always remember my grandmother adding it), but other than that I followed the recipe.  They turned out wonderful, my whole family agreed!

These were so good, I used Cattlemen's sweet & spicy BBQ sauce and it gave them a real good flavor. I couldn't wait to pull them out of the oven and get started eating, they smelled so good. I can't wait to make them again, maybe i'll go right now, thanks.
