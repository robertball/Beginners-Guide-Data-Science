This is a great pasta dish! Word of warning must love garlic- I think two cloves would be sufficient! Creamy yummy! I think it would be equally good with chopped broccoli or spinach added to this.

This made a great, thick creamy base for a massive pasta dish. I added mushrooms and broccoli in to give it some nutrition. I did have to almost double it, I'd say about 3 1/2 cups of each liquid to fill the cast iron wok before adding an entire box of pasta. This is going to feed a family of 5 for a few meals/lunches.
