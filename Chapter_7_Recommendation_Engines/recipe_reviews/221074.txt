I was looking for a new use for black beans and this recipe seemed interesting. Its fresh with a hint if sweetness from the honey and jam. I did substitute peach jam instead of marmalade.

Light, refreshing and tasty.  Didn't have orange marmalade or the peach marmalade as called out by the other reviewer.  Used black raspberry jam instead and canned corn.  Such a versatile recipe that you can substitute the jam you have on hand as well as other ingredients.  Recipe is definitely a keeper.

After a while, it seems that all recipes for salads with cucumbers, black beans, corn, and cumin taste alike.  This one has differentiated itself by using the honey and orange marmalade in its dressing which gives it just the right amount of sweetness.  Will make this one again and most likely cut back the olive oil to 2 Tbsp.

My first comment on the many recipes I found on allrecipes!  OMG!!!  What a great start to an awesome cuke salad.  I added 1/4 chopped sweet red pepper, used a mix of freshly made strawberry & raspberry jam instead of the orange marmalade, added 3 TBS of apple juice, red pepper flakes & increase lemon juice to 2 TBS.  Love, love, love it!

This salad was delicious - a really fresh flavour combo. I didn't have any honey so omitted that and it was perfect, I don't think I'll use honey when I make this again. Thanks for the recipe!

Way better than you can imagine but be forewarned, this recipe is a lot of dicing and makes a TON! So if you're just making it for you, half the recipe

This was a refreshing and delicious black bean salad! Love the cucumbers. The only changes/additions I made were using green onions instead of a red onion and I added some balsamic vinegar to the dressing. Everyone loved it! Also, make sure to use fresh squeezed lemon juice.

I think what makes many recipes "5 star" is their flexibility, which is why I love this one so much. The recipe author was inspired by various ingredients in her fridge, and her final product further inspired me to use some summer veggies we get en masse from our CSA in a new and very yummy way. 

As written, the flavors are great. It's also very good with the addition of more black beans and/or summer squash and/or cilantro and/or bell pepper and/or balsamic vinegar. I've also used various jams, and it always comes out slightly different and very tasty (especially raspberry jam with white raspberry balsamic vinegar instead of lemon juice).

I accidentally left out the honey. Thought it was delicious!!! Made it a second time with the honey and thought it was too sweet. May recommend omitting honey

This is soooo good!  I needed something to do with the cucumbers mom gave me from her garden and this was perfect!  It's easy to prepare & perfect for a potluck or picnic too!

I would make this again! I used homemade jalapeno jelly in place of the marmalade and added some chopped fresh Italian parsley, plus fresh sweet peppers from my garden. Delicious and adaptable recipe that helps use up some more cucumbers now that I'm done making pickles!

Just made this tonight, my husband and teenage son LOVED it.  I also substituted the marmelaid - for seedless black raspberry jam and it turned out great! I used 1 1/2 cucumbers instead also. Thanks Emer for a wonderful recipe!!

This was super-easy to make and very tasty.  I used red beans because I was out of black beans and it was fine, of course.  Thanks for a very nice accompaniment to our fish tacos!

This was a bit hit at a pot luck dinner. I doubled the patch and added a little more marmalade for my taste along with an orange bell pepper for more color. What little was left over did not look so good the next day but tasted just as good.

So good! I left out the red onion (my family won’t eat raw onion) I used extra lemon for a little more brightness and used canned corn instead of frozen. Super delicious! New favorite! My kids love it!

Very versatile salad but not great as is.  I added some green pepper, cilantro and omitted the marmalade fearing it would over power the salad with sweetness.  Also, upped the cumin, added garlic and cayenne to taste.  That was a great salad after the changes and additions!!  Avocado would be great, too!!

The cucumber just didn't really go with this.  Kids liked the flavor of just the corn and beans in the sauce ok but overall it was a waste and went in the garbage.

My DH did the making on this one. He doubled the ingredients except for the dressing and omitted the honey. A winner in our family for flavour and a dish that I almost always would have the ingredients on hand. A beautiful summer salad.

I really enjoyed this unique flavor profile.  The veggies can be changed according to what you have on hand. The addition of fresh parsley added a nice, bright flavor. I will make this again. Thanks for sharing!

This was a dietary adventure for my husband and I. It was really good and was PERFECT for a Mexican-inspired meal -- grilled steaks, Spanish Brown Rice (from this site) and fresh cantaloupe.

Didn't have orange marmalade so used a tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate (thawed).  Also didn't have enough fresh lemon juice so got out my limes and used them, plus the zest from one lime!  It was great!  This is a keeper and perfect for all the cukes and tomatoes in the garden.

This is a good salad and the unique flavors make a nice change of pace.  I can see why other people thought it was too sweet, but I liked the sweetness.  I did think the onion was too strong.  Next time I'll use 1/4 an onion or less.  This salad isn't a favorite, but it'll be nice in the summer when we're trying to use up our garden produce.

I was looking for something to do with the abundance of tomatoes and lemon cucumbers from my garden. This is great.  Even my husband who doesn't like cucumbers or tomatoes liked it.  He & my 8 year old granddaughter asked for a serving in their lunch the next day.

2 Cups seeded and chopped cucumbers and 1 Cup seeded and chopped tomatoes.  Any sweet onion will do, I used Vidalia but Walla Walla would be good too.

Nothing too exciting...the marmalade kind of got lost in everything else.

This was really good.  I threw the leftover bean salad onto mixed greens... :)   I was tapping my new orange marmalade jar lid to get it off..and the whole top, glass included cracked off...so I had to improvise with plum sauce and dried orange rind...it worked...but I want to go buy some more orange marmalade.

Love this. I didn't have orange marmalade, just added a little strawberry jam. Love this recipe! Put it in a tortilla wrap-LOVED IT!

me and bf really liked this.. hardly used any cucumbers partially bc i forgot them since i was inundated with every other ingredient.. used a lot more lemon and added cilantro.. used regular chopped up tomatoes.. only used half the olive oil.. he said it reminded him of ceviche w/o the seafood.. i thought of it more like tex mex salsa.. ty for the recipe
