Delicious. I rolled the dough into a 6 inch log, and rolled it in about 1 tbsp white sugar. I then cut it into slices and set them on a baking sheets. I didn't brush them with the yolk... It was delicious. I froze the leftovers, and reheated them in the microwave for about 30 sec. They were still great. Thanks! UPDATE: Do NOT forget to let them stand 15 mn. I forgot the second time I made them, and they turned out pretty bad.

These scones were great!  I used two cups of flour, added dried cranberries (no curants on hand), patted into a circle, cut into 8 wedges, brushed with honey instead of egg, and baked in a circle with a little space in between on parchment.  They rose beautifully, baked to a golden brown, were light and fluffy, and tasted very good.  These were fast and easy and I will make them again. Thanks for the recipe!

These scones turned out fantastic!  Moist & fluffy.  I only had salted butter in but they still turned out great.  The dough was a bit moist so I didn't bother rolling out the dough.  Instead, I just divided the dough into eight pieces and pressed them into circles.  I also didn't bother brushing the tops of the scones with the egg yolk.  To me, that just didn't seem necessary.  I will defnintely make these again!!

Wonderful scone recipe - I froze the butter and then grated it into the dry ingredients. I also added a tsp. of vanilla and an additional Tbsp. of sugar, as I love a sweet scone. I used half and half instead of milk and after the egg wash topped them off with turbinado sugar for that extra added crunch. These are delicious with currants or raisins and a wonderful base for add-in's like dried cranberries and orange zest or mini chocolate chips. Delicious, light and moist - perfect with a cup of tea!

these were really good and not too sweet.  I doubled it and made twelve nice sized scones.  I also added blueberries to half of them and made an icing sugar glaze ( I flavored it with almond but might also try lemon or maple).  Note: when I doubled  this recipe I did not need to double the milk and did not double the baking powder.  Worked great!!!

Killer recipe.  I substitute buttermilk for milk  and everyone (including my two year old) loves them.  Sometimes I skip the egg wash because I bake these at my bed and breakfast and they are still a hit.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe!! I have made this over and over again. Easily made with  everyday items. I have made them with frozen blueberries, lemon and poppyseeds and even with Splenda. They come out perfect everytime. Don't waste time rolling them out, just pat into a thick circle and cut into 8 wedges. Top with sugar, bake and enjoy!

I love this recipe!  I've made it again and again.  These scones are the real deal, not muffins in disguise.  The flavor and texture are just right.  

To make it slightly easier, I just pat the dough into a large circle and divide it into eight triangles.  Then I sprinkle with sugar rather than doing the egg wash.

I added a little less sugar, 4 Tbsp instead of 5. And with no milk on hand, I used non fat yogurt diluted with a touch of water. And yes the waiting time is essential. Wonderful texture. I've tried tons of scone recipes and this is by far my favourite.

I just made these. First recipe I tried, but these scones taste better than any I have ever bought in a bakery or street fair. Very light and airy. I used zante currants, which is produced by the same brand as Sunmaid raisins. Also, 400 degrees is too hot in my oven.

I had never made scones before, and these turned out very well.  Very quick, easy to make, and everyone enjoyed them.  I used raisins and half and half (out of milk again).  The dough was easily shaped into a 3/4 inch thick circle, then I cut the circle into eighths.  I brushed each wedge with half and half, which gave them a nice finish.  I'll make these again for sure.  Thanks, Bianca.

These scones just didn't do it for me.  I added blueberries and sprinkled the tops with sugar, but they just weren't sweet enough for my tastes.  I might also add that they were not the dense and flaky texture I look for in a scone, but were soft and fluffy like muffin tops.  I would consider using these with ham and cheese for a savory brunch item, but never again with fruit.  Probably just never again.

Great scones, light, fluffy easy to make.  I did sub a few things; used low fat milk, Stevia and omitted the egg wash.  Best scones I ever made and I'm from UK

This is so good. Just a little adjustment, I added a 2tbsp of plain yogurt, 1tbsp lemon juice and 2tbsp pineapple juice to the milk. The scones turns out moist and smells so tropical....

I served this for News Years day brunch. I added dried cranberries and orange zest. I served with clotted cream and jam. They were great.

If you have one ounce of British Isles blood in your body, You'll get a warm fuzzy feeling with tea and scones at about 10:00 AM and at 4:00 PM!  These are as closest to authentic Irish Scones as you can get on this side of the pond.

I wanted to try a new recipe for scones and found this one that seemed easy enough for me to make a bazilion of. It was a very easy recipe!! I tripled it at first and instead of adding the currents, I add chocolate chips (my favorite kind of scone!). I didnt change anything in the recipe, even though I tripled it except that I didnt roll it out on flour, I used parchment paper. Much easier and way less messy. I then doubled the recipe, this time adding cran-raisins instead of the currents. I also used a heart cookie cutter instead of the round cutter, just to make them "cuter". :) These are wonderfully yummy scones and were a BIG hit at my Ladies Tea at church yesterday. I even took the leftover scones and gave them to the kids in Childrens Church for their morning snack! They gobbled them right up! Thanks for a wonderful recipe! I will make these forever now!

I just made it easy for me i didn't roll it out (it was to sticky):),so from now on I will use flour on my hands.  I then take a pice of dough and press it flat between my palms and put it on the baking sheet.  The rest is by the recipe.

I made a few substitutions based on what I had in my pantry and they still turned out delicious. I used 1/2 cup of dried cranberries/blueberries (mixed), and 2/3 cup of almond milk instead of regular milk. Everything else was kept as per recipe. Since I didn't understand what was meant by rubbing the butter into the flour, I just used two knives and using criss/cross cutting motions, cut the butter into the flour/sugar mixture as best I could. After you make the well and add milk, I used a fork to stir it all then once blended, used my hands. At this point, the butter made its way completely into the mixture. I used a 350 degree oven and kept the scones in the oven for 22 minutes. Oh and in trying to keep things easy, I also did as another reviewer suggested and just created a big circular shape with dough on a large wooden cutting board and then cut it into 8 pieces like pie slices. ENJOY they were great!

these were nice baking powder biscuits, but tasted nothing like a real scone, nice texture, rose nice, but bland in flavor. I will go back to my uk recipe.

These turned out just like in the picture, though I hoped they would rise a bit more (and look like the ones you get in Britain). Dough was easier to work with after I floured my hands well. I padded them into circles and didn't glaze them with anything. The taste could have been somewhat richer and sweeter but they were perfect with some butter and homemade strawberry jam!

This dough was extremely sticky to work with. I made the recipe exactly as the directions state.  They looked beautiful but they did not taste that great. My husband said, "You can throw out this recipe" so I guess I will not be making them again.

Instead of using currants, I added black walnuts and dried cranberries to the recipe and served these scones hot from the oven with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  They were a huge hit.  These are  the best scones I've ever eaten, and certainly the best I've ever baked.  Great recipe!!!

This is the best scone recipe ever!! It bakes nicely (temp. was perfect for me), and it comes out delicious!
I didn't use the currants, and I used soy milk instead of milk. All I had was salted butter in the house, so I used that...it worked, however, it must of slightly changed the taste.

Best Scones EVER! I've made them about six times now, and they always come out great. I've used both butter and margerine in the recipe, and I find that butter makes the scones hold their shape better, although margerine tastes just as good. This is defentely my new Scone Recipe.

My daughter has made this recipe twice.  Once the same as the recipe.  And she made it once putting apples and a little cinnamon.  Both times these scones were delicious.

These are my go to breakfast scones for company.  Serve them warm with good jam or preserves, add a bowl of fresh, cut-up fruit and you have a great light breakfast in no time.  I also add a little vanilla extract and whatever dried fruit I have on hand to the original recipe.  I have used skim, whole and 2% milk as well as 35% cream, sour cream and even greek yogurt and these scones always turn out well.

added 1 cup of chopped bosc pears and 1/2 cup craisins.  skipped currants.  did not knead but stirred to moisten and then baked it in a 9-inch round cake pan.  made a lovely tea cake to go with coffee or tea.  versatile as either a scone recipe with added flour kneaded in or a fruity tea cake baked without kneading in extra flour.  will make this recipe again for a tea cake.  thank you for a versatile recipe.  can add chopped apples and cinnamon or any combination of fresh and dried fruit.  prefer it as a tea cake to the usual scones.

I must have done something wrong... the dough was so wet I could not cut it with a pastry cutter. I added more flour and then dropped them by heaping TB onto my stoneware. they were still moist and yummy. I doubled the recipe and used some whole wheat flour as well.  I must have done something wrong w/the doubling b/c all of the reviews sound like it's an easy, no fuss recipe. Nonetheless, they were a HIT!  I'll make them again and pay more attention next time.

This is an awesome recipe, but being diabetic I had to alter it a bit, otherwise it would have been given 5 stars.  I used whole wheat flour instead, doubled the baking powder becuz of using whole wheat flour, took the sugar out completely, didn't use the egg on top but put butter on the tops when they came out of the oven and added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon, might even use a full tsp next time and used raising instead of currants.  Everyone loved these.  My younger cousin and kids are going to make these next time with chocolate chips instead.  Not a healthy substitute, but they are at least eating them.

I am eating one of these fresh out of the oven as we speak! This was my first time actually making scones, although I have eaten plenty in my lifetime. Very easy to prepare, except for dealing with the sticky dough/batter. It's much easier to just form the scones by hand then to try and roll it out and then cut. I only gave this recipe four stars because I tend to like scones slightly more dense while still being moist, but that is just my preference. If you are looking for a scone that is light and moist then this is the recipe for you. One change that I did make was that I used frozen blueberries and lemon zest instead of the currants.

I have never made scones before, but these turned out really well. I halved the recipe and instead of currants I used 1/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips. Turned out soft and delicious. This would go perfectly with tea or coffee. I'm thinking the next time I'm going to try squeezing a little orange juice into the batter (decreasing the milk by that amount), adding some orange zest and craisins instead of the chocolate chips or currants. I will be making this again and again. Thanks!

Very tasty, but the batter was a little too moist, which resulted in scones that were rather airy. I prefer a slightly denser scone, so I will use 2 c flour and perhaps 1/2 tsp less baking powder next time.

I made these to take to my office with my home-made jams.  What a hit!  I doubled the recipe and made them a bit thinner, I got about 2 dozen. Next time, I'll try some dried cranberries and grated orange peel.

this is the only recipe for scones i’ll keep for a while, it’s simple, sweet… mm. note: waking up to a near empty kitchen, i made a few slight changes, such as using chocolate milk and not brushing them with egg, but sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon. oh and patting the dough into a circle is easy.

This was my first time making scones and these were so simple. The only reason that I rated it a 4 is because I did make a couple modifications though. First, I used all whole wheat pasty four, Second I used honey instead of the white sugar. I used a whisk to mix it into the milk mixture ( i used skim milk). Third, I added a bit of vanilla to the milk/honey mix to add more flavor. Fourth, after the butter and flour was crumbled I placed it back in the refrigerator to keep the butter really cold for about 10 minutes. I also made mine with some orange zest. yummy! great base recipe that lends itself to many different combinations. I think next time I will add some orange juice in place of the milk to add a stronger orange flavor. I think lemon poppy seed would also be wonderful!

No need for egg wash. Turns out great with white chocolate bits and chopped dried cranberries, or diced apple with cinnamon. Even add cocoa and chocolate chips! Have with homemade clotted cream (1 part yogurt + 2 parts heavy cream and let sit for 12 hrs covered at room temp).

I freeze my butter, then grate it into the sugar.  It works well. Also I prefer to add a little white chocolate and cranberryies into the recipe and add a little sugar on the top of the scone.

The yolk gave a very strange yellow color haha... I'll brush it with milk next time. Also, I used a soft margarine instead of butter, since I have had bad experience with the butter staying in chunks and not melting properly. I added 1/4 tsp of salt, to help bring out the flavor of the other ingredients. (I'll try 1/2 tsp next time) The texture and moistness of the scones were very good, much better than all the other ones I tried that turned out dry and hard! It seemed just a little muffin-like though.

Very yummy. Modifications: 3/4c wheat flour and 1c white flour. Used low fat yogurt thinned with water rather than milk. Skipped the egg yolk brush and instead brushed the scones with melted butter.

I thought these were very good, but I will add more Splenda next time.
I made the following adjustments to this recipe. I used 1 cup flour, and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour, added 1 whole egg, added 6 packets of Splenda, and used 1 cup of dried cranberries unstead of currants...(don't even know what a currant is) LOL...  Scones are usually not sweet enough for me so that's why I added the Splenda.  Also, I suggest not preheating the oven until you have the scones on the baking sheet.  They have to rest for 15 minutes there so no need for the oven to be on that extra time. :)

Great recipe!  It was quite easy to make.  I used skim milk, but still had beautiful scones.  Also used raisins in place of currants.  After making the dough, I realized I was out of eggs!  I used instead 1 Tablespoon of melted butter, 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon and sugar, and brushed the top before letting sit.  They were wonderful, light, and very tasty.  Thank you!

My mom made scones just about every Sun when I was a kid.  These taste exactly the same.  Crumbly and just a tad sweet.  They are killer hot from the oven with a nice slather of butter on them.  This is a keeper.  Thanks for the recipe !

The best thus far of the scone recipies that I have tried! I doubled the butter, as suggested by another rater, went ahead and added a quater of a cup of flour to make 2 cups of flour.
I added one teaspoon on almond extract and drizzled honey on top of them before baking. OH HOW DIVINE they came out! The honey crusted the tops and added a little more sweetness to them.  
The scones are light and fluffy and are divine when dipped in coffee!!

These were great. I substituted fresh cranberries for the currants. And unfortunately ate 3 myself! I did add just slightly extra flour. But loved them.

Fantastic recipe - lightly sweetened and feather light!  Used it at our B & B to raves from all. I reduced the sugar in the scones to 2 tbsp and mix the remainder 2 tbsp sugar with 1/2 tsp cinnamon and sprinkled on scone tops.  I patted the dough and scored into 8 wedges instead of rolling it and cutting them out.

Great recipe! Very flexible too! I used fructose in place of sugar and dried sour cherries in place of currants. Delicious!

An easy and delicious recipe. Scones can tend to be dense, but these are light and fluffy. Perfect!

Perfect for a novice baker like myself.  We substituted butter-flavored shortening (no butter in the house), chocolate chips (my love's favorite scone) and honey on top. Moist, flakey, delicious. Going to make strawberry next.

Amazing!!! i substituted a half cup of rolled oats in place of the last half cup of flower to add a bit of texture. also sprinkled a bit of sugar on top of the egg yolk glaze. these were a huge hit, definitely to be repeated.

Awesome scones! Swapped out the whole milk for nonfat vanilla yogurt plus some lemon juice, and used frozen blueberries instead of currants. Just make sure to mix the dough thoroughly before adding the berries so that they don't burst (different timing than with currants).

I followed the recipe and the scones came out very good.  I did not add the egg yolk on top but followed the advice of another and added a little honey on top.  The scones tasted very good, not too sweet and everyone liked them.  I liked this recipe a bit better than the Huckleberry Scones recipe.

These are the best and easiest scones to make.  The trick is to grate the butter in a cheese grater to form the crumbles even better!

A terrific scone recipe. I like to roll out the dough into a round and cut into pizza-shaped triangles. Less hassle than using a cookie cutter.

These scones are simply delicious.  I whipped them up easily and baked them in my new pan.  Minor modifications include, only 4 Tbsp of sugar used in the batter, dry cranberries instead of currants, used 50% whole wheat flour and I sugared the top after brushing on the egg yolk.  They are so delicious plus are incredible the next morning toasted on the griddle with butter. mmmmmm

Very easy scone recipe! The egg yolk basically gives the scone a yellow look and a slightly eggy taste.  I used frozen blueberries and they turned out great!

i am new to the "scones zone", i gave it 4 stars cuz it seems for me that it needs more sugar for more flavour!
i didnt have currants and am not a fan of raisins so i added dry peach cut to pieces (mayb with currants it would taste sweeter), next time ill try it with more sugar as i said and nuts; am thinking almond and/or peanuts...
all in all it was a good one

These were my first scones, and I don't have reason to try another recipe.  My family and I love them.  They are moist and tender.
I used chocolate chips instead of currants, and substituted skim milk for whole.  Delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe and very easy.  I did add 1tsp. of real vanilla to the egg yolk for the topping.  I also sprinkled course sugar on each on after they were topped with egg yolk and vanilla.  I don’t care for currents so I used Ocean Spray Craisins.  I had never made Scones before so I was a little nervous.  However, I wish I would have made a double batch because everyone wanted more.  Great recipe, I will certainly make it again.

Amended review:  I had written how much my family LOVED these, but making them a second time they were so sticky and moist I almost threw the whole glob out.  USE MORE FLOUR. Additional flour and kneading didn't harm the scones a bit.  **I had no currants and my family isn't crazy about raisins, so I added 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 T extra of sugar to compensate.  Even my husband who isn't a fan of sweets said this was "perfect".

I substituted 3/4 c. of blackberries for the currents and increased the flour by 1/4 c.  I omitted the egg yolk and sprinkled the tops of the scones with sugar instead.  The dough was definitely messy to work with, even after adding the additional flour.  I think I'll try a different scone recipe the next time.

So easy I made them on a weekday morning! I used soymilk instead of whole milk and chopped dates instead of currants. The dough was very sticky so I just cut it into wedges instead of stamping out circles. Not too sweet & they had a perfect texture. Great with coffee or tea. My kids each ate 2 of them! We will make these again!

Good and easy.  Used blackberries so I doubled the fruit-just the right amount, and they are of perfect sweetness. Oh and used cream vs. whole milk.

I found the mix to be exceedingly gooey, far too sticky to either roll or shape and had to add extra flour just to enable this.  I now notice an earlier reviewer mentioned when they doubled the recipe they did not have to double the milk...I would have reduced the amount of milk used had I read that before.

I found the temperature of the oven to be too hot. I didn't use currants or the egg yolk. I used 3 tbsp honey instead of sugar and used buttermilk with grated lemon rind. They turned out tasty and will make these again.

Texture was lovely BUT something is missing...a bit bland...rather like a glorified baking powder biscuit.

This was my first time making Scones. The only changes I made was to add 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 cup of blueberries. No raisins. They came out perfect. I will be making more for my family on Thanksgiving.

Love this recipe!! I put in about 1/8 tsp of Mexican Vanilla and drizzled cinnamon honey butter over the top with a dash of powdered sugar. It makes it one heck of a dessert!

I changed them to Keto scones by switching out the flour for almond flour and stevia for sugar.   For this you need 2 eggs and about 2 Tbs more Stevia.                                      This time I made them orange cranberry white chunk chocolate.

This recipe is really great! I replaced the dried fruit with chocolate and white chips with the same amount stated and it turned out really good! I would recommend to add more chips if you want it to be more of “chocolatey”. Overall, this recipe is so easy and fast and turns out really yummy!

I found it too sweet and when I rolled it without kneading, it didn't rise much. I would lessen the sugar and knead the dough a bit next time and hope for better results.

really good. I've modified it a bit and added flaked, hemp seeds and 30% whole wheat flour. Plus I usually mix a bit of sour cream into the milk using the same total volume as recipe calls or a bit more if dough isn't sticky enough

Outstanding!! Thank you for this recipe!  I decided if these were good enough for one reviewer to use at her B&B they must be good - I was thrilled with the results!  Thanks for the tip to shape, cut and sprinkle with raw sugar.  Quick easy delicious!

Made exactly as recipe stated except used 1/4c of 1%milk (that was all I had) and the rest half and half. These were good. They were easy to make & came out really light & flakey but they were a little too sweet for my personal taste.

These are, as my dad said, "Freakin Awesome!"  However, I did change them quite a bit which is why I gave them only four stars.  

I used salted butter.   I used raisins instead of currants.  I shape the dough into a tall hamburger patty shape in my hands.  No rolling out.  I also add a little more flour to the dough to make it less sticky so I can do this easily.  I do not let them sit for fifteen minutes, and I sprinkle cinnamon sugar liberally on top after I brush them with egg.  Oh, and I use the whole egg instead of just the yolk. The result?   Delicious!  Like a sweet raisin biscuit!  A big hit  with my family.  

As a side note, this is a very forgiving recipe.

I used this recipe for baking these for a breakfast crowd of 650 people (not the only breakfast item) but I used 30 pounds of flour, 15 pounds of sugar, 15 pounds of raisins & currents, and 2 gallons of milk, a bit of salt. Always tastey!

I love this! I was going through recipes finding the best one. And I thought these were perfect! I love that it was doughy and dense, instead of being crumby. I ate them plain without any jam because they were tasty enough on their own. I tried baking them in my Philips Airfryer and it was surprisingly successful. I tried putting it in for 10 minutes at 200 degrees celsius, but when I checked them at the 5th minute mark, they were really dark. I was afraid they would get burnt, so I adjusted the temperature to 150 degrees. The scones which came out of the air fryer was not dried, as I thought they would be. Instead, they were a bit more sticky compared to the ones that came out of the oven. It may be due to the fact that I put it in for a shorter time, but it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inner.

This is an amazing recipe.Instead of currants i used craisins and they came out great. I also added some orange zest with a little of of the juice too. This is a good recipe, and its also good if your a beginner.

Absolutely AMAZING!!! I did not have currants so I substituted chocolate chips, rolled out a 8"-9" round and cut into wedges(like pie), sprinkled white sugar atop the brushed on egg and baked the required time. Absolutely perfect with tea, coffee or hot chocolate. I will try these with other variations in the future.

This recipe was easy to follow and the outcome is delicious...not too hard like some scone recipes I have tried before. Because I did not have currants, I added chopped apples and raisins. Very pleased with this recipe.

I changed this recipe to accomodate my daughters milk allergy.  Made it with dairyfree margarine (ice cold) and vanilla rice milk.  It was delicious and moist.  This is the second time I'm making it, we can't get enough.  This time I made it with craisins, last time with raisins.  Very easy too.

These were excellent. I actually doubled the currants (my friend gave me fresh ones) and also added some chopped walnuts. I think I too would cut them into triangles to get more even pieces.

This recipe sounds great - and simple, too. However, what type of tea should I serve along with these scones?

These are easy and delicious.  The only change I made was using cream instead of whole milk - it's probably why I'm such a big fan.

These were great and very easy. Light and fluffy. These are like english scones which I prefer. I found that they were very easy to roll out--not too sticky. Perfect for a light, simple breakfast.

This recipe is absolutely perfect if you double the amount of butter.  Everyone goes crazy when I make these.

Lovely,light,luscious scones! If you prefer scones that do not have a touch of sweetness, use a bit less sugar.  I used vanilla flavored soymilk instead of regular milk. My own personal preference is to omit the egg wash. I also did not roll the dough (too sticky) put patted it out on a floured surface then cut into pie shaped wedges.

This recipe is great. The scones are better than most i've bought in stores or bakeries. I made this using dried cranberries insteadof currants, and it was wonderful!
