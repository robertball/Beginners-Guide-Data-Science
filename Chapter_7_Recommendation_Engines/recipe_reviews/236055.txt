I more than enjoyed this recipe, it was delicious, all the ingredients of  my choice and the Tyson Grilled Chicken is also  tasty for me.  I didn't know this chicken was in the frozen department.  Thank you Allrecipe! I will definitely add this recipe to my recipe collection.

I used this just for the process and proportions, but I chose uncooked chicken and different vegetables.
