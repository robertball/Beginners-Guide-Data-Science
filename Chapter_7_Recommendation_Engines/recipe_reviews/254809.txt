Truly a great dip. Wasn't sure to drain the diced tomatoes and green chilies or not and the recipe didn't say to drain them so I didn't. Worked out perfect.

Best. Dip. Ever. A co-worker of mine actually gave me this recipe. My husband will eat it in one setting if I let him. (Who am I kidding, so would I!) It’s perfect for a get together because everyone LOVES it. It’s perfect.

I've made this several times, experimenting to get the heat right.  I'm not a spicy food lover, so it makes a difference to me and my guests.  I plan on trying this with canned tomatoes, onion and garlic to see if it works.  One thing to note with the Rotel - if there is anything left over (unlikely) the spice level will increase.
