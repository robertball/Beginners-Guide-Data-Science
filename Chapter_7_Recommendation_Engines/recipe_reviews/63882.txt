Very good soup for a really cold day. I used a hot pepper chopped up instead of green chilis and the spice was still great. Next time I would thicken the soup up a bit, though.

This recipe makes delicious soup! I used only 2 boullion cubes to cut down on sodium, and I substituted fresh diced jalapenos for the can of green chilies. I also added a can of dark kidney beans and 2 Tbsp. recaito, then garnished with fresh scallions. I skipped the chips to make it a little healthier. YUM!

Well, day after Thanksgiving 2005, and I'm in the store again to get ingredients to make this soup.  Not disappointing!  Very good and spicy...used left over smoked turkey from the grill..nice smokey, spicy flavor!  Well do it again (probably this week!).  Thanks for sharing!

As a newlywed and a new cook, I try new recipes almost every night to impress my husband, This is the first soup I've ever made, and it was wonderful! I added more turkey than the recipe, but my husband was a happy man!!

This was a good soup for one of the first chilly fall days. Went over well with a crowd of guys and they finished the pot off. I add more cayenne but we like things spicy. I will be using this recipe again for left-over Thanksgiving turkey.

This is delicious, I used chicken, and i added more vegetables, and rice, instead of all teh seasonings, i just use taco seasoning, its delicious, the longer you let it sit and simmer, the better it tastes. I always make it for my family and they like to put cheese and sour cream on top, with homemade tortilla chips.

I've made this several times, including this week for my extended family for Thanksgiving. Awesome and my parents even loved it. I was pretty much true to the recipe except: I used chicken broth (all I had), I probably added more turkey than called for because I had it; I had a package of frozen corn so I added it - much more than called for but come on, it's corn!; used more cheese than called for - but each person added the amounty they wanted.
Thanks for a wonderful after Thanksgiving dinner idea!

This soup was excellent.  If you use mild chiles, it's not spicy.  I added celerey and an entire can of corn so it would be a bit more hearty.  I also let this simmer for about 40 minutes.  Other than that, no changes.

This was some great warm up the insides suop!  Next time I will probably not use cayenne pepper though.  Too hot for my daughter.  Everyone else loved it.

This soup was absolutely delicious! Couldn't get enough. Wasn't too spicy for us. I'm going to use this for left over turkey a lot. Low fat too!

I followed the recipe except for using chicken broth instead of water and bouillon. It was very spicy. HOT! We like spicy, but I had to water this down with lots more stock. Added cooked rice which made it more of a meal. Will make again, but will tone down a little.

My family LOVED this soup! They all said it was the best soup they ever had.  I added a can of black beans, used a 15 oz. can of corn instead of the frozen and used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the tomatoes with chilies. It was perfect! Made this way, it was not too spicy for the kids to eat. Bravo!

This was almost a flop.  I thought it was too watery, and lacked flavor or something (like an incomplete recipe). 
What saved it was the dollop of sour cream I added to each individual bowl (on top of the crushed tortilla chips and shredded colby/jack cheese).  
However, this recipe  could have used a can of green enchilada sauce, some dark red kidney beans or black beans, and about a 1/4 cup of Cheez Whiz or Velveeta (stirred in and simmered during the last 3 or 4 minutes of cooking).

Holy...turkey! This is so easy and so yummy!  Follow the recipe, use the boullion cubes.  I forgot to buy corn, but had Mexican style corn, which was probably fate. DELISH! This is supposed to be a brothy soup, so if you are looking for something creamy, try CPK's corn tortilla soup. I did add cubed avacodo when serving, just like they do in Albuquerque...Will DEFINITELY be making this often.

When I made this soup, I browned some fresh turkey breast with a teaspoon of oil and the spices (I used dried onions).  I also cooked the turkey, chilis and stock for about 4 hours before adding the tomatoes and corn.  Overall, it was a nice soup, with great flavor, a touch of spice.  Make sure to serve with sour cream and/or chopped green onions.  For a heartier soup you can add a can of black beans.

This recipe is absolutely delicious, but I did make some substitutions.  I had some left-over barbecued turkey I wanted to us up; it made a wonderful smokey taste to the soup.  I didn't have any green chilies, so used 4 fresh jalepenos instead.  I also substituted the oxo cubes with some home-made frozen chicken broth, 1 1/2 cups of salsa for the canned tomatoes, and Kraft Tex-Mex cheese for the monterey jack.  Everyone raved about it.

This was excellent with wonderful flavor!  I also added a can of kidney beans to add more body to soup.  Next time I'll use less water as it was kind of a thin soup and we like soup thicker.  I also used cheddar cheese instead of jack because that was what I had.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent, spicy soup!  Best way to use up turkey leftovers.  I used 2 cans of chicken broth instead of boullion, and 1 cup salsa instead of the tomatoes.  Also added 2 cups Bloody Mary juice, and did not put corn in (don't care for it)  Will make this whenever I have leftover poultry!

Yum! Yum! A bit too spicy but my hubby loved it.He's the anti-soup kind! I'll keep this recipe on hand for the hectic nights. So easy to put together! Thanks!
