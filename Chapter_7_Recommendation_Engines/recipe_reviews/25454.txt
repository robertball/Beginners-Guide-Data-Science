This ham is delicous!!!  I made it on the stove top and cooked the ham in it.  I halved the recipe and it worked just fine too.  Highly recommended.

Followed Doreen's recipe exactly as written and continuously basted as written.  I know a recipe is great when my husband tells co-workers and family members about it.  This is a keeper and a must to try.

The ham slice was delicious, my husband said "It's a keeper!"  Loved the Horseradish flavor. I used my grill pan on the stove, worked out fine.  Used one ham slice and cut the recipe in half.  My slice was thin so it took no time at all.  Super!

Holy cow!! This is Julie Andrews spinning around on a mountain top good!! I used the original recipe...but I changed the amount of brown sugar. My husband doesn't like Honey ham at all, so I was afraid that he would think this too sweet. So I started with a 1/2 c. packed brown sugar...then whisked in another 1/8 c. un-packed until the taste was spicy with just enough sweetness.  I then cut (not scored, but actually cut slices into the ham steak) and put a few tsps of the marinade into a ziploc bag and marinated the ham for an hour, while reserving the rest. We don't have an outdoor/indoor grill because we live in an apt and have an electric stove....so I put this on a cookies sheet and broiled it while basting it a few times. I served the remaining marinade on the side for dipping....but I found simply pouring a little over top after cooking tasted the same. For myself I sprinkled on a little red pepper flakes (but that's a new craving for me so I eat it on everything) I tasted my husband's without it and it was DIVINE!! I served with steamed corn. We will definitely have this again. It was AWESOME!!!

Yummy! I used this marinade and baked the ham while it was sitting in the juice/sauce. I didn't have enough lemon, so I added some orange juice. Very good!

Very good recipe!!  To keep from having flare-ups on the grill when brushing on the sugary mixture, I just marinated my ham slices in the mixture.  We then grilled them.  They were great, we all enjoyed them for dinner and plan to do this again.  Much better than just plain ole ham slices fried in the skillet.

Great made on stovetop also... just keep basting and turning ham. Has more flavor than when made on the grill.

I've served this twice. It is VERY GOOD. I'm not fond of ham because of the gooey parts between the meat, but this changes the consistency and the flavor immensely!

I absolutely love this recipe. I've made it on the bbq and in the oven. I've used the sauce as a dip (thickened) served warm. I'm even thinking of canning the sauce to keep on hand whenever there's ham on the menu!!! Thank you!

This was a delicious change from the norm for my boyfriend and I, which is exactly what we were looking for!  The grill was out of propane, so instead of grilling, I mixed the sauce and cooked the scored ham in it for about 5 minutes on each side.  (The ham slices we buy are already cooked) One thing- try the recipe as-is first, then next time adjust the horseradish accordingly.  I prefer a bit more; my boyfriend prefers a bit less.

Delicious way to do ham on the grill. I have made this before without the lemon juice and a bit less horseradish and the sauce stuck to the ham more like a glaze. Yum!

I really enjoyed these ham steaks. I never know what to do with them, but bought them on sale & found this recipe. The only thing I did differently was to spread the sauce on both sides of the steaks & let them sit 1 hour before grilling. Great sandwich leftovers.

Oooooh so good!!!!!  I followed recipe exactly except for using the broiler instead of a grill.  The sauce was out of this world.  I was only cooking one ham slice but made the full amount of sauce for 2 slices - so glad we did.  We didn't have a drop of sauce left (we used it for dipping too).  This sauce is a keeper and we will use it on pork chops too.  Thanks submitter.

This is the second year I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone absolutely loved it. I used a pre-sliced spiral ham and had none left by the end of the night. Even my guests who don't normally like ham loved it. Don't change anything and enjoy!

We are big grillers but had never grilled ham before, in fact, it never even occured to us to do so! What an unexpected treat. The basting sauce is superior. Thanks!

We do ham slices on the grill all the time, but this really makes it different.  I made the recipe as it was listed, but only used one large ham slice (for two of us), then stored the rest of the sauce in a container in the refrigerator.  Used it for another slice approximately 3 weeks later...it was great!  Heated the sauce just before putting the ham on the grill.  This is a KEEPER..thanx Doreen!

What a nice change for a weekday meal.  The horseradish really makes this unique and does not overwhelm.  Followed the recipe to the letter, used one of those vacuum-sealed pkgs of Smithfield ham, and the end result was very good.  So if you're tired of the same old, same old every night, give this a try.  I'm glad we did.

After reading other reviews, I was willing to try it. It just didn't sound good. WOW, was I wrong! I prepared it in a non-stick fry pan because of some of the reviews about flare ups and stickiness. I cut the recipe in half for one slice, which was perfect. My husband had his doubts but encouraged me to use the ingredients Doreen listed. I always listen to my husband :-)  Thanks Doreen and all the reviewers. This is a keeper.

Very good recipe. As with others I was tentative with the horseradish but it ended up being very good.  Made it exactly as instructed and wouldn't change a thing. Will become part of the menu.  Defintely a keeper.

For such a simple recipe, the results are fantastic.  I cooked the ham in a grill pan, and used "creamy" horseradish, and the result wasn't very spicy (might have just been the brand).  The baste/glaze is delicious - no changes necessary, though some might like extra horseradish.

Delicious!  I used Splenda Brown Sugar Blend (what I have on hand) and loved this!!!!  I also cooked this on the stove since I don't have a grill.  Next time I will decrease the brown sugar a little more but I really loved the horseradish and lemon juice.  I'm so excited to make this again.  UPDATE!!!  Tonight I could smell my neighbor's charcoal grill next door so I asked him to grill a few ham slices for me.  This was again, delicious!  I wish I could rate this more than 5 stars!

Great recipe for ham.  It is really nice to have such a simple recipe that can be used on a busy worknight, and is not the usual beef or chicken meal.

Awesome recipe, didn't change a thing (other than making more for leftovers!) I've already made this one 3 times. A definite keeper! I plan on trying this with a baked ham in the fall.

We made two batches of this marinade because my daughter saw the horseradish on the counter before I mixed it and refused to eat it.  So...I made one batch with horseradish and one without.  The entire family agreed that the batch without actually tasted better.  So if you have any picky eaters in your house, just try mixing the brown sugar and the lime juice together for your marinade.  I've also heard that PEPSI (not diet) is good to add in with the brown sugar instead of the lime juice.

Just made this for dinner tonight.  (though I must admit, I'm the typical old fashioned cook.  I glanced at the ingredient list and then just dumped rather than measured)  The ham steaks were awesome!  What a great recipe and one I would have never dreamed up myself.  My husband and son loved them, too.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe.  I found it in my Betty Crocker cookbook when I got married 34 years ago.  Wouldn't change anything.  The ham cooks quickly on the grill so baste frequestly and don't overcook.

The only thing my husband likes more than ham for dinner is more ham.  This recipe is a winner.  I grilled it very slowly and the ham came out fork tender.  I used the leftover ham for sandwiches the next day and used yeast rolls.  The blend of flavors was amazing as each flavor became more distinct as we ate.  High five, Doreen!!!!

WOW!!! Never would've thought to put horseradish on ham steaks.  I didn't have lemon juice on hand.  Only had a half of a lemon.  So I squeezed out all the juice I could, which wasn't much.  I used Kraft prepared horseradish, which I found near the cottage cheese at Walmart.  Anyhow, I would maybe cut back the brown sugar to only 3/4 cup.  But, too bad this is too expensive to make for a potluck.  This is WONDERFUL!

I had bought a ham shank because my daughters had thrown out the ham bone from our Canadian Thanksgiving glazed ham.  I wanted to make some yellow pea soup and needed more ham/bone.

Okay, so I made this last night using some slices off the ham shank and it was absolutely wonderful.  I did it outside on the barbecue.  I didn't change a thing.  I sliced the ham relatively thick and it didn't take much time at all to cook.  Next time I would only make half the sauce recipe as it's only the 2 of us and I had a lot of sauce left over.

Personally, I love the plain slices from the ham shank but hubby does not and I had all this ham to use up.  Thank you so much Doreen for sharing this great recipe with us.  Hubby not only liked it, he thought it was 'interesting'.  I actually really enjoyed this myself.  I will make this recipe often.

I thought the glaze tasted somewhat similar to the Octoberfest mustard that I buy only not as sweet.

Made this with ham steaks on my stove top grill pan. Hubby loves horseradish on ham anyway, so this was perfect for him and the rest of the gang. Quick, easy and delicious. Thanks Doreen!

Wonderful quick recipe.  When I was mixing the ingredients together, my youngest son was concerned about how it looked and the ingredients that I was using.  When he took his first bite, he relaxed and ate without a complaint any only praise on how good it was.  Ditto for my other son.  My husband took his first bite, and all he said was 5.  Everyone in my family loved this.  I followed the directions exactly and used 2 ham steaks.  Thanks Doreen

Good flavor but a little strange.  It's not quite a ham you want to serve with baked beans and mashed potatoes, but more with something like Chinese noodles and bok choy!  I did mine on the stove top and the pan was a little hard to clean, but the overall flavor was good.

We tried this tonight and it is definitely a keeper! Since I'm not fond of lemon juice, I used orange juice and it was exvellent - still get the citrus flavor without the tartness of lemon juice. It seems like a lot of horseradish, but the citrus and sugar make it sweet and mellow - you really should try this!  We will make it again next week with pork chops.  It's a tasty, versatile marinade and dipping sauce.  And my husband was glad to see that the sweet marinade did not burn while grilling.  Thanks, Doreen!

Great recipe! Terrific flavor and so easy to prepare. I reduced the amount of horseradish because I was serving this to my picky kids. Plan on using this for my Easter ham dinner.

I have made this recipe twice now and it is so delicious.  I like to cook it on the gril until the ham gets a little dark on the edges and the left over marinade I baste on the ham while I am eating it.  So good!

I won a Taste of Home recipe contest with this recipe decades ago (Zesty Grilled Ham), and it remains one of my family's all-time favorite dishes. It's based on one from an old Betty Crocker cookbook (1970s, I think). I don't score the surface, but I do always cut through any fat on the edges and in the center of the slices (around the bone) at about 2-inch intervals. That keeps the ham from curling up. This is great broiled, too.

Dec 2013: Made this in a grill pan on the stove top, poured all the sauce in  and cooked it on high until the sauce was thick and gooey.  Yummy!  Jan 2015 update:  Just had to say again how delicious this recipe is.  It is an absolute favorite even among the former ham-haters in my house.

Delicious!  I basted it often while grilling, and watched carefully so the sugar wouldn't burn.  It turned out really great.  Next time I may up the horseradish a little, but it was yummy as is.  Thanks for a really easy and tasty recipe!

This was the perfect flavoring.  It was our first time grilling ham, but it turned out fantastic.  The sweetness was reduced by the horseradish to the point you could taste both in every bite.  Definitely a keeper!  Next time we're going to try with pork chops.  Thanks Doreen!

Simply amazing. I did about a half-batch of the sauce and I used six slices of half-inch-thick ham. I scored both sides as directed and just let the ham simmer in the sauce for five minutes per side in a pan on the stove. Excellent. The sauce tasted pretty nasty before adding the ham, but it was great after cooking on the ham and spooned onto stir-fry veggies. My daughter couldn't get enough! Thanks for sharing, Doreen!

My hubby and I really liked this one. I had a thick sliced ham steak. I didn't get a chance to do it on the grill. It was still delicious but I can't wait til it gets a little warmer than 15° outside. It will be great on the grill

This recipe was fantastic!  All my children loved it, even my picky 12 year old who complains about everything.  Never would have thought to put ham on the grill, but it was sooo good.  Didn't think I would like horseradish in anything, but the mix of flavors was really great.

Wonderful! Don't let the amount of horseradish scare you. Once mixed with the other ingredients and grilled,the taste is amazing, sweet with just a bit of a bite and the smell is equally good.
I plan on using this same mixture with pork chops. Thank You for Sharing

I have been making this same recipe since 1978 - I found it in my very first cookbook (Betty Crocker) - and it is true that absolutely everyone loves it!

Basting the ham as it cooked with this recipe didn't allow the ham to capture the flavors.  I wound up using the remaining mixture to dip my ham pieces as I ate, which was great.

Had this last night and family raved about it.  I did turn the grill to low and basted ham liberally after each of many turns until it was browned.  Very pretty on plate also.

Tried this last night and it was wonderful.  The only problem was that our grill kept flaming up. Regardless, this is a recipe we'll use over and over on grilled ham.  Maybe will even try it on baked ham.  Yum!

I did this in the skillet because when I wanted to start cooking, there was a downpour. I’m so glad I did. I had bought a whole boneless ham and sliced it thick to freeze 2 slice packages for dinners. I let the ham simmer for about 45 minutes until the sauce thickened. It was delicious. We even added the extra sauce on top after it was on our plates for more flavor. I think most of the deliciousness would be lost through the grates in the grill. I’m so glad it rained

I just went looking for this recipe again in my stash of allrecipe printouts and found that I've been making this since 2012!  It's much requested by friends and family and super yummy.  The only thing I do differently is that I line the grill with foil to make it a slow  cook and prevent the baste from falling thru the grate and into the grill.  Try it,  you're gonna like it!!!!!

Quick, and very flavourful! We used a whole pre-packaged ham (for a family of five) and have tried a number of different ways to slice and score. The best results have been just as the recipe mentions;) to slice the ham. We do cut the brown sugar in half and leave everything else the same in the recipe. The sugar crystallizes and chars a bit,  which adds a very flavourful element. Kids, 16, 14, and 11 love it. Serve it with something non-sweet enjoy best. We tried it with a delicious sweet potato recipe, but overall sweetness of the entire dinner was a bit much.  Very easy and quick to prepare.

A little too sweet for my taste.  Next time we will double the amount of horseradish and see if that cuts the sweet.

I've made this a least a dozen time.. my family of 4 loves  it..  my 10yr old request it often, calls it shrimp steak.. he says the sauce taste like cocktail  sauce.. my hubby tells me it's one of his favorite.. I use -8oz ham steak that's fully cooked.. and the sauce makes plenty for 4 steaks and I even refrigerate left over sauce and keep in air tight Tupperware for up to several months. that way on the way home from work when I'm trying to think of something quick to whip up it all I have to do is  buy the ham steaks. Thanks for sharing. definitely a keeper!

Soooo yummy. Was tired of regular old ham for Easter dinner. I cut thick slices (about 2 inches thick), kept in the oval shape, scored slightly and basted often while turning on the grill.  They were done in about 12 minutes. So fast and easy. Everyone loved it. Will look forward to ham more often.

I have cooked this several times exactly as posted. Now that is a common meal in our home I have tried different things and cooking methods. My favorite so far is to use a small can of pineapple juice instead of lemon and cook in a crock pot on low for 8 hours. It's awesome. Oh I also didn't heat up the mix, just poured the cold mix over one large ham steak.

Very tasty, adds interest to the standard ham steak.  Be careful that you don't dry out the ham on the grill, it doesn't need a lot of time.

AWESOME RECIPE! My husband hates ham, won't eat it, but when my mom fixes THIS ham, he eats like a pig (no pun intended!) I was vey surprised when she told me what was in it. But it works!!  It is amazing. She uses it as glaze for baked ham as well. I am going to make it myself this week, and plan on following the recipe as written.

I was a little nervous to try this recipe since I'm not a fan of horseradish, but I'm glad I did!  It tasted great, everyone liked it and I'm having leftovers for breakfast. It does make a lot of glaze, next time I think I will half the recipe and still have more than enough glaze.

So good.  Followed the recipe exact as listed.  Bought some extra thick ham steaks so they had a nice chargrill on the outside and moist on the inside.  Wife loved this one.

I really liked the flavor but the hubby said it "grew" after eating a few bites.  I had way too much of the baste mix, so would def cut this back.  I used 4 of the small sandwich/breakfast ham slices.

Flavorful but a bit too sugary for me.  Aside from that, though, this was easy.  I fried on the stovetop and used the mix as a marinade for uncooked meat.  Hubs really seemed to enjoy it, and the liquid was plenty for 2 large ham steaks.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a hit in our house, everyone asked for seconds and it made great sandwiches the next day. I used two large ham steaks, so doubled the recipe and ended up with some extra sauce that I simmered down just a little and poured over the ham before serving. My 6 year old had three servings, and then wanted it for breakfast AND lunch the following day :)

Excellent flavor!  I grilled the ham steaks too long (new cook error - LOL), but loved the sauce.  Will definitely make again!

Just what I was looking for for our Easter dinner for two!  Easily done on the Cuisinart Griddle/Grill inside.  Unique grilling sauce; hubby says this is a keeper!

Super delicious! I love the sauce, but just be aware, if you are using a fully cooked ham slice, you only need to sear each side on the grill which takes just a minute or two per side (or in other words, just long enough to get grill marks on the ham).

This is simple and delicious...the horseradish is such a pleasant surprise and for us the key to a 5 star review.  Next time less brown sugar and more horseradish for our preferences....my son liked it and he doesn't think he likes horseradish...so you know it's not overpowering in this recipe...

Very tasty way to prepare ham.  Everyone liked it (including my three year old!).  The leftover marinade was a nice complement to the sweet potatoes I served with the ham.

Wonderful grilled ham!  My family really enjoyed the marinade that recipe provides.  I thought the combination of the brown sugar, lemon juice and horseradish sounded a little off, but boy, was I wrong.  The flavors worked well together and added wonderful flavor to the ham.  I served this with 'Grilled Chipotle Sweet Potatoes", another AR recipe and my meal was a huge success.  I will be making this recipe again.
