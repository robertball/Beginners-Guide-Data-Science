The original recipe - Aunt Rocky's Magic Dough - calls for 1 tsp (teaspoon) of yeast. I have made it with 2 tsps and it is good. This is truly a Magic Dough! Thanks Aunt Rocky!

I have made this bread twice and it sank twice! I was scrupulous in following every step yet minutes after turning off the oven after the required baking time the beautiful high crown on the top of the bread sank like the Titanic! The bread still tasted delicious but the texture was more like fallen souffl√©
