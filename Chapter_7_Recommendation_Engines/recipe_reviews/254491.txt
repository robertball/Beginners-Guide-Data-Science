I made this for some cornish hens I smoked over the weekend. One word. Excellent! My only regret is that I didn't smoke a few more birds so that I could have leftovers for lunches. The brine made the birds super tender and full of flavor. They were so moist that they would re-heat nicely as well. As I mentioned, I did smoke my chicken instead of bake it and smoking has a tendency to dry things out but not with this brine. This one is a keeper! Thanks duboo!

Very simple brine that really works. The brine tenderizes the meat and makes it  absorb the smoke from smoker. My turkey was extremely flavorful and super tender.

While brining always helps my chicken stay moist, the flavor of this brine was not near as tasty as I anticipated. The herb bribed chicken was much preferred by my guests.
