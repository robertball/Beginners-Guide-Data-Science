Not a lot of flavor. The cheeses cubes didn't melt, would probably use shredded next time. Also, maybe add a little dill or onion powder.

This was easy and fun to make. I substituted the sour cream with ranch dressing. Next time instead of cayenne pepper, I will use a few slice jalapeños. Great recipe!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

I haven't made it yet but I think when I do I might put in some jalapeno or the green chili in the can. This sounds yum

I thought this was fantastic and my family loved it. I used sharp, grated cheddar cheese and added a dash of curry then sprinkled the top with grated parmesan. I served it sliced with melted butter and served it with beef stew. It was wonderful!
