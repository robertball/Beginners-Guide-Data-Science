SOOOOO Good! At first everyone wrinkled thier noses at the thought of cabbage in thier salsa, but after they tried it, they loved it. It's even better if you let it sit overnight.

This was very good salsa... just a little too spicy for me personally. I also would add more tomatos next time. I added some vinegar and sugar like the other reviewers suggested and it seemed to add a lot more flavor. I will be making this again. It was fabulous on fish tacos.

This is a great recipe; I added a sprinkle or two of white vinegar to enhance the flavor and also 2 tsp of sugar.

Very hot.  I used only 4 jalapenos and that made it hot enough.  Also, I added some cumin.

This is a great recipe! I did use Beefsteak tomatoes because they were in the frig and not as many garlic cloves (4) and the kids loved it. I think I can eat this stuff everyday!
