I don't like lamb as a rule, but we were given a leg of lamb by the neighbor for whom I make jalapeno jelly (long story).  I made the lamb in the slow cooker, didn't have marjoram, and used cooking wine instead of the lime juice I was fresh out of.  I even liked it, and had a 2nd piece after the reluctant taste test to see if it was done.  Thank you All Recipes and Robertjm.  I'd post a picture but it's probably all gone by now.  Blessings.

My Aunt suggested this recipe for me to serve.  I, and as well as my Father found your marinade to be far to overpowering.  Sorry but a tender leg of lamb has a delicate flavour that shouldn't be compromised by to many other flavors and should never be placed in a crock pot.  I will however, try your marinade the next time I try a stewed lamb for rice.  The flavour of the spice should prove to be pleasant.

It was perfectly good but didn't blow me away. I was hoping it would be tastier.

The recipe was very simple but gave the meat a wonderful flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I used the marinade and put it in a rotisserie. I served it for Easter and it was delicious ??
