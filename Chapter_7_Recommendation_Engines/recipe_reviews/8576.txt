This recipe made the chicken extremely sour, I think that I would cut back on the lemon juice.

We absolutely loved this chicken!  I followed the recipe exactly, and marinated it over night.  It was a bit sour, but that was what we loved about it!

so fast and so easy!  I used fresh lime juice because it's what I had on hand and it was fantastic.  If you are looking for a great, simple dish, this is the one!

Just use the Italian dressing.  Been cooking chicken like this for 40 years.
