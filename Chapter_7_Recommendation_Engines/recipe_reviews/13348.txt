This is basically the chicken soup I have been making for years and love.  The vegetables and fresh herbs listed in the recipe are usually what is in supermarket "soup mix vegetables" packages here in the U.S. northeast.  To reduce the fat I do use skin-on, bone-in split chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken.  There is still some fat under the skin necessary to hold the flavors.  To keep the vegetables from becoming flavorless mush, I cut them bite-sized but don't add them until ~20 minutes before the soup is done and don't puree them.  I add the herbs in the last few minutes.  My experience is that the split breasts are done and tender after 40 minutes of simmering.  So I start the breasts around 20 minutes before the vegetables in lightly salted boiling water w/ a couple of teaspoons of cider vinegar to draw some of the calcium and gelatin from the bones and skin into the broth which enriches it, then sprinkle in the black pepper.   Personally while I love all the other vegetables in this recipe, especially the parsnip, I find turnip tends to overwhelm the other flavors so I don't use it.  The turnip that comes in the soup vegetable package is delicious mashed into mashed potatoes, though.

We thought this was soooooo good!  However, I didn't not use a food processer and left my veggies cut up instead, it was really great soup.  Thanks for the recipe.  The 2nd time I made it I took advice from Marta and tried adding cream cheese.  I found it totally changed the taste of the soup and not for the better.  Keep the recipe as it is and you won't go wrong.  My family and neighbors love this soup because its sooooooooo awesome!!

This was a very good soup. My bf had been craving chicken soup for a while. I think this hit the spot! I did add some homemade Amish egg noodles to make it more filling and it may not have to be on the stove for the full two hours, the chicken fell apart before I could get it out of the pot. I will make this again! Thanks for sharing!

The taste of some of the vegetables, i.e. parsnip, turnip, overpowered the chicken flavor. It certainly tasted "healthy". I will probably make this only when I'm really sick with the cold/flu. If you're looking for clear/light broth-based chicken soup, this isn't it.

I came down with a horrible flue a little while ago as did my girlfriend.
This was the favourite recipe for chicken soup i found here and was a huge hit - nursed us both back to health - lasted about 3 days, only change i made was an extra leek - oh and i couldn't fid a bird over 3kg - but the 2.6kg on i found made it plenty meaty.
Never tried the noodles etc - just good old crusty bread and it was fantastic - in fact about to make it again only 23 weeks later.

The flavors in this soup are divine.  We did this differently (partly by planning to, and partly by misreading the directions, me thinks...).  Anyway, I cooked a whole chicken in water only (overnight when the night was short anyway).  Then I pulled out the chicken to cool turning the slow cooker up onto high.  After deboning the meat, I returned the bones to the crockpot with some vinegar, S&P to taste.  By noon time, I pulled out the bones and put in the veggies on high to cook throughout the afternoon.  When the veggies were tender, I didn't only process the veggies with my blender wand, I actually misread and 'trusted' the misreading, so I blended the chicken into the soup at the same time.  The expressions on my family's faces were dubious, and they expected to be reaching for the means to make PBJ's (doesn't happen often, but when one of my experiments doesn't work out, that's the agreed upon default....), anyway, when we sat down to eat the soup with salad and nice bread rolls, they were astounded with how yummy and filling, and how down-right comfort-food this turned out to be.  Sorry for misunderstanding... well, sort of, and thanks for sharing, Angchick, because this 'new' type of chicken soup really is comfort food, and I'm so excited that it's getting to be fall again, so I can make this again.  just picked up turnips and parsnips at the store this week, and had to share!  Thanks again!

I make chicken soup at least every other week, but this is the first time I have ever used a whole chicken instead of breasts and the first time I have used turnips and leeks.  I am now a whole chicken-in-soups convert, and the turnips and leeks made this seem really special.  We will definitely make this recipe again!

This soup is so good and healthy! We have a large family and everyone loves it...even the grandchildren. I have put it over noodles and rice...both were wonderful. I actually liked it so much that I used the rest of the turnips out of my garden and made the veggie puree and froze it for winter soups.

I didn't have any leek on hand and completely forgot to put in the onion and I used carcasses from whole roasted chickens that I had stockpiled in the deep-freezer.  It came out great.  I had never used parsnips or turnips before and find I like them!  This is a keeper!  Thanks!

This was easy and very good. I went out on a limb and used a whole bunch of turnips! This was a great way to get them by (into?) my kids - they thought this was "regular" chicken soup. Balance the bitterness of your turnips with carrots and a teaspoon of sugar. I don't like dill in chicken soup so I skipped that. My kids also liked not having celery in there - it was there but they didn't know because everything except some carrots and the chicken had been pureed.

Great flavor, but I wouldn't puree the veggies, I would cut them up before I put them in. A little something different every spoonful.  A hint I saw on QVC, was to put the chicken in a colander, and set it in your pot and cook as usual.  When finished, you lift the colander out, and no bones and skin floating in your soup.  Cut up the meat and add back to the pot.  Works great!

excellent soup! I threw everything into my slow cooker overnight and enjoyed it for lunch the next day. I added quite a bit of salt. I never had turnips before and was a little hesitant but it seriously adds to the flavor!

Great just the way it is.  I did add about 1 tsp of Mrs Dash Garlic and Herb seasoning and a tsp of minced garlic.  I didn't run all the veggies through the food processor only about half that way it was thicker and chunky.  Good soup!

When I tated the soup after following the recipe it was only 3 stars.  After a bit of enhancement it was 5 star.  I added a couple of teaspoons of chicken base and added soup pasta.  The broth was wonderful!  I will use this recipe from now on and add soup base, pasta and chopped vegetables for more flavor and interest.

This chicken soup had a very nice flavor. I have made it twice, once as called for and once with 1T sage and 3T chicken bouillion granules. It sure hit the spot when we all had colds.

stay with the recipe.  It's important to simmer for 2hrs. This adds flavor. (No, you won't over cook the chicken in water) 

Purée the vegetables. This is the difference between soup and chicken water.  If you like eating pieces of vegetables, then add more in the final 20mins.
My favorite part is that smooth oval piece you get from a chicken leg, so I add a few more legs to my whole chicken.  After 2 hours, the bones should slide
Off the meat. Also tie the parsley and dill with kitchen twine to easily discard

My family loves this soup. Wheather I do it after a long night out or to warm the belly for a cold, its a really wonderful soup. One rated this soup and added cream cheese, so I tried it. (NEVER AGAIN). However, I tired it without the cream cheese and added mushrooms as well as chicken legs instead of breast (dark meat is less dry). Best soup ever!!

It's time for winter vegetables, and found this  soup using parsnip, turnip, and carrots. I didn't have a whole chicken but did find turkey sausage in the freezer. I skipped the leek (didn't have any) added a can of chick peas, a half cup dry left-over Lentils, 2 Tb butter, and a teaspoon turmeric. Everything got a rough slice/chop. This smelled awesome while it was cooking. The broth was wonderful. The turnips gave a natural unexpected sweetness to the soup.  Wonderful - thanks for sharing!

This is a delicious basic chicken soup with a rich-tasting, almost creamy base, although there is no cream or milk in it, only healthy ingredients that soothe your soul and warm your bones.  I love the mix of vegetables that make up the flavor - complex yet delicate.  It made quite a large amount and I froze portions in plastic containers so we always have some on hand. You can ad flavors such as cayenne pepper (my favorite) or garlic before serving to make variations. Great on its own or over rice.

It is a good start but it seemed like it was missing something.  I did add noodles but I still wanted more chunks.  I think next time I will leave some carrots out from the puree.  I also think chunks of tomato might be nice.

This was the perfect soup for my cold! Smooth texture but nice and brothy.  I used 3 pounds of chicken thighs instead of a whole chicken.  Worked great, plenty of meat.  Highly recommend.

This is a time consuming recipe for sure.  The chicken fell off the bone after an hour and a half, I ended up adding more dill to the finished soup and some frozen peas just to give the soup some more "body".  I will definitely add cooked noodles for my kids and husband, it will make a hearty meal and best of all, the kids wont even know how many nutrient rich root veggies they just ate!

This was an excellent combo of vegetables and the broth had superb favor.  I was not able to blend the veggies since i don't have a blender or processor, but it still came out really delicious.  Also didn't have dill on hand so i used thyme.  Will definitely make again.

My wife and I agree - this is the best chicken soup we ever tasted! I added a package of frozen mixed vegatables and two hand fulls of pasta for a slight twist.
