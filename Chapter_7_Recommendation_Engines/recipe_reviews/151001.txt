My kids enjoyed the pie because they love egg nog.  I wasn't as impressed with it; felt as though I was eating a big slice of cool whip.

Great recipe, easy to make! I didn't have eggnog, so I made it simply with the vanilla pudding layer on the bottom, a cream cheese/whipped topping layer in the middle and another layer of just plan topping on the top sprinkled with coconut. Yum! Everyone loved it!

I don't care much for pudding pies, but this one was wonderful! My sister-in-law, who never eats seconds, had two pieces and asked for the recipe. My mother also asked for the recipe, and my entire family loved it! This recipe is SO simple and delicious that it's well worth the 10 minutes or so it takes to make it. Highly recommended.

This was ok I guess. It was just really sticky sweet, tasted "instant" to me,  and the bottom crust part ended up a little soggy.  I don't often do pudding pies, maybe it's just me. It was the fastest pie I have ever made, that's for sure. But I probably won't make this one again.
