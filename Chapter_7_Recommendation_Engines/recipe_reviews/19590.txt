This is a really good base recipe.  I changed the fruit to what I had on hand (I substituted peaches and pinapple for the raspberries, added extra banana) and it turned out really tasty.  I'll be trying with other fruits too when they come into season. Also, I didn't serve it over ice or ice cream.  I just stuck  it in the freezer for about a half hour to an hour and stirred. It wasn't too sugary sweet, and had a good drinkable texture.  The kids really enjoyed this "dessert".  :D

I followed this recipe exactly and then felt it was a little to runny for a smoothie and added 8 ice cubes to the blender. Next time I think I will cut the OJ in half to reduce some sweetness and leave my 8 ice cubes so the servings don't change.  There's just the right amount of tofu and banana without being over powering flavors. They let the other fruit shine.

This recipe sounds really good.... just make sure you use a "vegetarian friendly" yogurt. Most yogurt brands use gelatin, which is NOT veggie friendly. Other than that, I can't wait to try out this recipe!

Hugely popular with the kids and I. I used Stacy's organic vanilla yogurt, a combination of frozen blackberries and raspberries and a frozen banana and Dole's orange/banana/strawberry juice. We all LOVED it. The kids actually asked me to make another right after we drank the first!
