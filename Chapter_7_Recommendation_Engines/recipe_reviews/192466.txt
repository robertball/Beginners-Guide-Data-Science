I love this recipe, but i don't add any potato to it. Instead of frying, i bake them in the oven for 30mins at 350F, if they were cold to start with.

Yum!!!! I grilled on the Foreman rather than frying (cut a large potato in half and set the pieces upright in the bottom corners to keep the lid from smashing the meatballs) and served with spaghetti noodles tossed with garlic oil and basil. My husband loved them!!!!

These were very good! However, I baked them (uncovered) at 400 degrees until done, then I poured a simple pasta sauce over them and baked them for just a few more minutes then sprinkled feta on top. They were DELICIOUS! (I served with white rice)

These meatballs are DELICIOUS, but very greasy.  And it's hard to not burn them at the temperature suggested.  My thermometer said 275 degrees, and I still couldn't get them both cooked through and not burned.  I baked the second half of the batch at about 400 degrees for maybe 30 minutes.  I also didn't have any parsley or lemon.  I'm excited to include those ingredients next time.

These were ok. Next time I make these I'm going to cut back on the mint as it was overpowering and add about 1 tablespoon crushed garlic to add to make these less bland.

My elder mom whom I take care of every Sunday just loved this. I was loking for something with mint and basil and different and this fit the bill and fill our bellies, quite Yummy! I served it with Tzatzike Sauce for dipping.

Mmmmmmm! This brings back fond childhood memories.  My Dad used to make these and I'm so happy to have found the recipe. These taste exactly like I remember.

Didn't find these to be like what I know. Added cinnamon, allspice and fresh dill, rolled them in flour before frying and I got what I was looking for. I also serve this on lemon/parmesan orzo with a healthy squeeze of lemon

Traditional Keftedes are made with pork not beef. Great recipe, my kids love them. I make tons of them and freeze them. I give this to my kids instead of chicken nuggets.

As long as I have been anticipating trying this recipe, when I prepared it I did not care for it. The dried mint seems to overpower all of the other ingredients. I used three methods after preparing beef mixture: frying; baking and grilling these meatballs, however all three methods did not meet my satisfaction. I understand recipe says to deep fried them, but unfortunately meatballs came out very crispy.

I made them with ground lamb instead of beef, and I love them. I’m going to use beef next time and see which one I like better.

These were a hit but a bit overwhelmed by the lemon.  I will
 cut back a bit next time.
