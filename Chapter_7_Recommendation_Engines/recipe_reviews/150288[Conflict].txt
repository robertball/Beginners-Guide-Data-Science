This was awesome. You can't go wrong with a portobella sandwich. I've made them before but not with the citris dressing or roasted peppers. If you like it try marinating the mushroom in a teriyaki sauce...yum!

Yummy! I used a smoked gouda and seasoned rice vinegar in place of the balsamic vinegar. I also roasted the red peppers myself. So much better than the jarred. Besides it makes the house smell so good!

This was yummy! The only changes I made were I used provolone cheese instead of Gouda only because I had the provolone on hand and I used an English muffin instead of the sourdough roll (again its what I had). The citrus mayo really made the sandwich. Will definitely make again!

There are some good ideas in this recipe including the citrus mayo however it didnt impress. Next time i wont use balsamic vinegar in the marinade and i'll try goat cheese to give it more of a kick.

Very tastey! Oddly the roasted red pepper smoked gouda and citrus mayo also make a delicious sandwich with a fried egg.

We LOVED this! The combination of flavors was wonderful. I did grill a few onions and throw them on but everything else was as written. Wonderful!!

This was my lunch today! I was really a happy camper! I don't care so much for smoked gouda so I used a blend of Swiss and gruyere and the mixed greens turned out to be just arugula. This made a wonderful sandwich for me on Chef John's Homemade Hamburger Buns. I will for sure make this again! Thanks sierra!
