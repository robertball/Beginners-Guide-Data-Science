Two weeks now are up, so let me give you the good and the ugly.  First the good.  The pickles are very crunchy, and the level of heat from the cayenne is really tasty, just about perfect for me.  Now the bad part.  This liquid in the jar tastes like I just took a tablespoon of salt and put it directly in my mouth.  At first, I thought where’s the vinegar, but then I was told there are “brined pickles” that require no vinegar.  Well, all I can say is that 2 Tbsp of pickling salt (or sea salt as recommended by the recipe author) for 1-1/2 cups of water will do nothing but give you a jar of pickles that are too salty.  So here’s what I’m going to do in order to salvage what I have.  I’m going to drain out most of the brine in the jar and add some vinegar.  If that doesn’t work, then they will will go down the disposal.  Sorry for the harsh review (and I rarely do a 1-star review), but IMO this recipe has MAJOR issues that need to be resolved.

These were not good.  The favors didn't meld well at all.  I like the concept, but the reality was very disappointing.
