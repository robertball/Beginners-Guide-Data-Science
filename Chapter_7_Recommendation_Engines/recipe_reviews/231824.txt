I wasn't sure what to do with all of the radish that I had. I mean, I can only eat so many in a salad. So I was glad to find such a simple way to enjoy them. I used fresh oregano instead of thyme and really enjoyed the flavor. We also let them cook for almost 30 minutes and got a wonderful slight browning on the radish. This recipe takes some of the peppery bite out of the radish and they become a cute little morsel of tastiness.

Have tried this recipe using white radish but it was so-so. Don't think white radish tastes good oven baked unfortunately - found it to be somewhat lacking in flavour... will have to find another way of cooking white radish...

I thought this was absolutely delicious.  I think by adding more salt to my liking made it tasty and not bland.  I guess too much salt is not good for you so adjust accordingly :)

Wow made these as written except added some red onion and they we really good!  They don't even taste like radish. (I like radish)  I used regular red radishes and sprinkled with the lemon.  Thanks for sharing this one, it's now on my go to list.

Excellent side dish.  You can also add the greens at the end to wilt them in for a bit more sweetness.

I had never heard of roasting radishes but our garden yielded too many all at once, so I tried this.
I used fresh rosemary instead of thyme and added black pepper.
They weren't quite right but I tossed in a little bit of brown sugar and this helped.
I know now, though, that I can throw radishes in with other root vegetables.

I did do a minor tweak I put these into a foil packet and BBQ.  Boy were they ever good.  Will be doing again.

This was interesting. I used black radishes and lime instead of lemon.  Next time I will use lemon, as the lime was too strong. Thyme is a great compliment.  Thank you.

I have made this a few times. I always cook for much longer than the time in this recipe. I even cut the radishes fairly small and still cook for often an hour before I get a consistency I like. I usually also add nutritional yeast for extra flavor. Each time I make it, it comes out different and I’m still trying to figure out how to accomplish the texture I mistakenly got the first time I made it, which was crispy like a hash brown. Anyhow, I do love roasted radishes!

I used to recipe to eat radishes for the first time in my life. The flavor with the simple spices left something to be desired. I winded up adding in a good bit of garlic powder there was a weird after taste on just eating them with salt/thyme/pepper and oil. I personally didn't add lemon maybe that would of helped with the taste but I often find dumping lemon juice on stuff over powers it and it's all I can taste. As far as how to cook them this recipe was spot on they were almost like baked red potatoes in texture and I think for anyone trying this if you find they don't quite taste great switch up and add some different spices to make them palatable otherwise I winded up eating every last one.

Very easy and quick to make.  I sautéd until tender crisp and added light touch of garlic powder and dried thyme.  The cooking softened the peppery quality of raw radishes.  This recipe is a keeper!

This  is a great idea. I never even thought of cooking radishes. I do this with garlic powder instead of the thyme... but it is excellent.... I have also done with thyme and it was fantastic... this time i added a touch of balsamic vinegar.. OMG so good.

Learned that I liked cooked radishes from making Braised Lamb and Radishes from this site, so thought I'd try another radish recipe.  This one is simple and lends itself to customization re seasonings.  I followed the recipe for temp and time, and just used my favorite seasonings.  Turned out really good.  Served it with  broccoli, brown rice, and ham.  Next time I'll change up the seasonings and serve with sausages - I think that would be pretty good too.

I did not make any changes to the recipe. It tasted good but I think I would prefer it roasted with other veggies and or spiced up a bit more. That is my own preference.

I think I will stick with eating radishes raw.  This seemed like a good idea, and the texture of the cooked radishes was interesting.  I don't think I will make these again but if I do I will try tossing them in some zesty Italian dressing before roasting them.   Thanks anyhow for sharing the recipe.

These were delicious! They came out tasting more like baked potato or zucchini, but still had a slight spiciness. We added minced garlic and used fresh thyme.

Made as written and they were great.  Will make again for sure.  They do get pretty small when cooked so I would use more than the 2 bunches in the future, but otherwise, no changes needed.  Yum.

I don't what I was expecting, but this just wasn't all that and a bag of chips for me.   I think maybe IF I tried this again, I'd leave off the lemon juice and maybe add some garlic powder to the oil and thyme mix--it just needed something.

Easy and tasty recipe. The hardest part is remembering to pop in the oven every few minutes to rotate the radishes.

It was OK, something different. Kids and husband didn't care for it. Probably won't make it again.
