The Creamy Garlic and Herb Sauce perfectly complimented the mild flavor of the Halibut, and tasted incredible. The sauce was quick and easy to make, and was done at the same time the fillets were ready to plate. This dish went well with a glass of wine and was a perfect main dish for a romantic candle light dinner for two.

Let me just say that this "Creamy Garlic & Herb Sauce" is truly OUTSTANDING!!! I have yet to actually try it with halibut though, but it would be good on just about anything! I jump to Step 3 in the recipe and go from there. I've made it three ways so far. First I used it over crab cakes to rave reviews. Then I served it over cheese stuffed ravioli and again it was excellent. The other day I made a pasta dish with shrimp & spinach, along side an appetizer of pan seared sea scallops... this sauce is so good that we poured some over both courses! The whole tablespoon of crushed red pepper is a bit much though; I used about half that amount and it was still somewhat spicy. We seriously LOVE this and I can't wait to try it a dozen more ways!

The sauce along is worth making this recipe!!! It is wonderful.  I did make a couple of changes:  used nonfat half and half, didn't have red pepper, used about a tsp of red pepper flakes.  Hubby poured it over everything on his plate.  It seems it reminds him of a Bernaise sauce....whatever it was WONDERFUL!! Thanks!

I didn't have the cilantro or the almonds and cut the amount of dill in half (because I don't like dill).  Both my husband and I loved it and it will be something I make again for guests. The sauce would be great with chicken if you take out the lemon.

Overall, no problems cooking the recipe.  After reading other reviews, I cut the crushed red pepper to a teaspoon.  Even so, the sauce was still very spicy.  Additionally, as other reviewers have indicated, the tarragon taste is very strong and overpowers some of the other elements of the sauce.  Both my wife and liked it but were not in love with it.  All three kids however, completedly rejected it due to the fire in the sauce.  Overall, then, the average score for our family was 1.8 stars.

This was fabulous!  I made it last night with wild, fresh halibut and I was looking for a recipe different from the usual creamy caper or panko breading.  This was very flavorful (I cut the crushed red pepper to 1 teaspoon), we loved the fresh red pepper and herb combination.  So yummy!  This morning I realized I forgot to add the almonds but we do have leftovers for them.  Definitely a keeper and for company - and easy!

Great dish.  Next time I'll cut the red pepper flakes to only 1 tsp.  We love spicey dishes but even this was a little too hot for us.  Great herb sauce.

Fantastic! Used haddock, no cilantro, no tarragon, 1/4 tsp only of crushed red pepper, no almonds (although I think they're healthy & would be delicious), 6-7 cloves of FRESH garlic, and only used a few tiny squirts of fresh lemon on fish. Better than Restaurant food...amazing sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the almonds and it was amazing.  I used frozen halibut filets we had in the freezer for awhile - next time we'll use fresh halibut and I plan on making this often!

This dish was wonderful. I was looking for something out of the ordinary to do with my halibut and I sure wowed the family with this one. Didn't have any cilantro, but instead substituted with some different herbs. Served with a mediteranian style salad, made for a spectacular meal!

"One of the best dinners you've ever made" -- the g.f. 

Made this with halibut from Pike Place Market, so the fishmonger gets an assist, but this sauce was absolutely fantastic. Definitely prep all the ingredients ahead of time and put them in little bowls. I'd say all told you'll spend about an hour of solid work to make this, but it's worth it. Served with whole-grain rice and baked romanesco.

YUMMM!!!! I make this sauce when I need a tasty topping for different meats and veggies. Last time, I put it with fettucine and chicken schnitzel. Tonight, I will pair it with steak, asparagus and green beans. My husband and I love it, and so do our guests! It is quite salty, which we like from time to time.

Tarragon way to strong for the sauce and gave it a funky taste. Will not make again.

Great sauce! Lots of flavor. I mixed in about a cup of cooked orzo and cooked up some green beans and broccoli as a side to make a full dinner for 4.

I’m giving this 5 stars based on reducing the optional red pepper to 1/2 tsp.  It was spicy so beware if you plan to add 1T. 
Made all as written except used a T of cornstarch instead of the flour.  Served over Mahi Mahi.

I am always looking for a different recipe for fish, since we buy Halibut and Salmon from Alaska every year and put in the freezer. It lasts almost a  year without no change  in the flavor. This sauce is delicious and  has a  kick  to it. I made this recipe twice with Wild Caught Halibut and I made with wild Salmon once. A little bit of work, but well worth. I served with the orzo pasta twice   and once with white rice.  My preference? Orzo pasta - its lighter.
Thanks for the awesome recipe.

SUPERB! My new favorite cream sauce. I low boiled the wine & lemon juice 1st, fat free half & half, flour &  because we are spice wimps, 1/8 tsp fine cayenne pepper, which I'd probably up to 1/4 teaspoon next time.  I used it on chicken and egg noodles. Didn't have red pepper & almonds but next time I'll put the almonds in.

This recipe was delicious.  As with any recipe you read, you must tweak it to your palate, and everyone is going to have their own opinion.  I, personally, cook for people who dislike tarragon, so I left that ingredient out of the mix.  I will say, though, I got someone to eat fish who HATES fish by using this recipe.  So, for those of you who aren't very keen to fish, this is a great way to get started!

I don't have much of a tolerance for spicy foods, so I cut back on the tarragon and left out the pepper flakes entirely. I'd recommend starting the sauce just before you put the fish in the oven though. We ended up having to wait six or seven minutes after the fish came out for the sauce to be thick enough to serve. 

It was delicious though. Something I'll definitely make again.

This was not only easy, but VERY tasty! I didn't have half and half and used low fat  milk and it was perfect! I left off the almonds as well. Definitely making again!

It was way too spicy for me. I agree wtih other reviews to cut the red pepper way down. I liked the sause and will try it again without the red pepper. The halibut came out a little well done but it is tricky to cook perfectly. A good alternative to my usual halibut recipes though
