Loved It!  Made exactly as directed.  Used fresh basil, corn, etc.  Everything as directed.  Stop fooling around with this recipe you guys - it's great the way it is.  I served it was grilled apple-chiken sausages I buy at Trader Joes.  Fantastic!  If you make it the way it's written you'll love it too.

Nice! I sliced my tomatoes into mini disks, and subbed in cider vinegar & green onion. I also added chopped cucumber. would make again.

We love this recipe just the way it is!  Everytime we make it, people ask for the recipe.  We served it at a dinner party last night and got rave reviews.

This was a wonderful, fresh addition to our summer meal.  I would omit the raisins next time (just didn't seem to work with the other flavors), but loved everything else.  Easy to make and delish!

Pretty good. Made some changes, though. Omitted the sour cream. Used olive oil, balsamic and red wine vinegar mixed (ran out of balsamic), about 1-2 TBS mayo, 1 TBS minced garlic, dried parsley and finally, 1 finely minced jalapeno.

I made as directed and, although I agree that the raisins are surprisingly good in here, the other flavors did not seem to mesh well.  Interesting recipe - at first I couldn't decide whether I liked it or not.  I've decided I would not make this again.

This was a sweet surprise! I thought it sounded odd but what to do with all those cherry tomatoes? So I made it and it was really good! Yes, I was a little worried about the raisins but we loved them so much , I might add more next time! Very refreshing on a hot day and a great add to a summer cook out!!

I selected this recipe because I had some grape tomatoes I needed to use. Didn't have fresh corn but I defrosted some frozen kernels under running water.  Didn't have enough fresh basil either, so added some dry into the dressing and then lots of chopped fresh parsley in the salad.  Would I make this again?  I think so, but I'd definitely make it at least a couple of hours ahead of time instead of putting it together at the last minute and I would omit the raisins.

I loved this recipe. I made a few changes - I used fat free sour cream and lowfat mayo just to reduce the calories but it was delicious.

Didn't add the raisins and used light sour cream and a reduced amount of olive oil mayo.  Was wonderful with fresh sweet summer corn...will definitely make again!

Love, love, love this salad.  It is so different.  The raisins are a must.  Sounds weird, I know but make it to the recipe and you will be surprised how great it is

I found the onions a bit over powering so I subbed jicama.  I also added mozz balls b/c I love cheese.

Another great recipe for a vegatarian daughter in a house full of meat lovers.  I grilled the corn in foil w/EEO and salt/peppers  since I was grilling chicken for other family members.  Also didn't use raisins.  Family really liked it, great summer dish.

Very good recipe. The only change I will make the next time I make it, is to saute the corn a few minutes. This really is a great recipe.

Had a few ears of corn I needed to use up PLUS I had some leftover green salad I needed to use...I mixed the corn salad together and tossed it with the salad to make a sorta "slaw" very tasty dressing, next time I will make it just as the recipe states!

This recipe's ingredients seemed like they would work well together, but it wasn't my taste at all. I didn't like the combination of the mayonnaise and sour cream. It was too sweet and turned an unappetizing pink color because of the tomatoes.  I think the corn should be cooked too, and I didn't care for the raisins in it at all.

This was surprisingly good!  I did not have raisins and it still came out fantastic.  I can't wait to try this with raisins.

I have made this recipe several times and it is always a hit. This time I use frozen corn instead of fresh corn. Still good. 

I didn’t have fresh garlic so I used garlic powder. Not the same.

 I always used dried cranberries, which is how it was made when I first had it. Gives it a slightly tart taste.

09.11.16 ~ A delicious corn-tomato salad with a twist. That twist is the raisins. I made the recipe as written, but did think about omitting the raisins. They add a slight sweetness to the salad and a totally different texture. I enjoyed them, my husband picked them out. A very good salad that I will be making again, part with the raisins, part sans raisins.

I had a lot of little cherry tomatoes from Hubs' garden that I wanted to use, so I thought I’d give this recipe a try.  I halved the recipe using a can of corn, drained, as I didn’t have fresh, and I used currants because I didn’t have raisins.  This was good, but it didn’t wow me.  I think Hubs liked it better than I did.  He had no problems polishing off the leftovers the next day.

Yum!  This was wonderful!  I didn't add the raisins, thinking others may not like that addition but will next time, or dried currants would be great also.

I have made this several times, including a vegan version using vegan sour cream and mayo. My vegan friends LOVED IT!  Mine version is more of a corn salad with tomatoes because I cut the amount of tomatoes in half. Just my personal preference. Otherwise, I make it just as directed Excellent!

This really isn't a review of the recipe the way it's suppose to be made . But when I read the recipe I thought wow this would make a really good side dish warmed up .  Yesterday I had leftover corn on the cob so I thought great time to give it a try . The only changes I made to the ingredients was left out the mayo & sour cream , used white wine vinegar because I didn't have rice vinegar . I also used dried onions . What I did was add a little olive oil to a tin pan added the rest of the ingredients , they sat for a bit while I cooked the rest of the meal . Then put them on the BBQ to warm them up . We were having Med. seasoned fish and baked potatoes it went perfect with them . So thanks for the recipe to inspire me .

I'm not a tomato lover but I really liked this salad. I was surprised how well the flavors worked. I used frozen corn (thawed) because I didn't have any fresh and I used dried currents instead of the raisins. I'll definitely make it again. I'd love to try it with fresh corn.
