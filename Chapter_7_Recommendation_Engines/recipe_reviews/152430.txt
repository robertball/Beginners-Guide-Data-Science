Well, not ALWAYS delicious, as described in the recipe. This, for me, rather than "rich and delicious," was instead "sweet and greasy." Too much butter and sugar, not enough baking powder, and I believe it could have used some salt too.  So disappointed since this was to go with our supper, I sent hubby off to the store for a baguette...

This is hands down the best beer bread recipe! Can't stop eating the darn stuff. I always tweek recipes and I'm sure this is great as written but I did make a few changes for my own taste. I added 2 tablespoons of honey, 1/4 teaspoon salt,Penzeys spices: oregano,basil and pizza seasoning all to taste. Don't forget to use REAL butter! Wonderful! Thank you for a great recipe...it's a keeper.

As is, it's okay. You'll need to do what I did and add a little salt to offset the sweet of the brown sugar and bump up the baking powder, so it'll rise. I added a tsp. of garlic powder and a tsp. of italian seasoning, so it'll compliment tonight's Pizza Casserole a little better. EDITED: If I make this again, I'll cut the sugar and butter in half. Too much of both.

This was a good beer bread, however I do feel that the listed butter is WAY too much.  I used 2T and found that to be sufficient - a 1/2 cup would have left the bread swimming in butter.  Also added a can of green chiles just because beer bread can sometimes be rather bland....great toasted with some butter.  Thank you.

Recipe is great! I only used 1/4 c. butter instead of 1/2 c. I also found that freezing the bread allows you to cut it into thinner slices without it crumbling.

It was ok, a bit too sweet for me, and a bit too dense. Mine was swimming in butter but when I pulled it from the oven I "drained it". Wil try it again as it is a good base but needs some tweaking in my opinion.

We have tried several recipes for beer bread this year. My husband likes to try different types of beers at micro-breweries across the country. This was excellent. We used a specialty beer ver dark from germany. Not sure if the beer would make a difference in taste but we sure enjoyed it! I have told family and friends and they enjoy just as much. Thanks for sharing. :)

Not too impressed with the origional recipe.  Way to sweet, didn't hardly rise.  It is a good base recipe to tweak to what you want though.  I put in 1/2 cup of brown suger instead of 2/3, added 1 tsp salt, doubled the aaking powder to get a little more rise, and used a little less than 1/4 cup melted butter and a basting brush.  I recommend changing this recipe to make it your own.

The bread tastes good, however, because of the butter the texture around the outside is the same as if it is not cooked properly, the inside is cooked but it is really really moist around the outside. Next time I will add butter to the mixture as opposed to the outside to see if it will turn out a bit better. I added some shredded cheddar cheese and a jalapeno to the mixture. It gave it some good taste.

This was quite an easy recipe, but I definitely agree with a couple of the other reviews - it's too sweet, and I normally like things sweet! But this is too sweet for beer bread. I'd bring the brown sugar down to a half cup. I'd also increase the baking powder to 3/4 tsp - my bread did not turn out as fluffy as I'd like. Finally, I would decrease the butter to between 2 Tbs and 1/4 cup.   I would try this recipe again with the above modifications. If you're looking for a mild, easy sweet beer bread recipe, then this is a good place to start, and make your own modifications from there.

Not great for my first attempt at beer bread.  I added salt and cut down a bit on the brown sugar but it was still a bit too sweet for my taste.  Also, did not rise as much as I would have liked... I might try more baking powder next time around.  And I might try half white flour half whole wheat flour next time around.  Had to cut the butter a bit also, was way too much.  This recipe was just ok but I think I'll look for a better one next time I have a hankering for some home baked beer bread.

I made this for Christmas dinner (yes, we're tired of rolls) and everyone loved it!  I followed the recipe to the letter; the only thing I did which is not mentioned here is I let it rise a bit before baking; I poured dough into the bread pan & let it sit on to of the stove/oven for a while where it was warm.  Perhaps this is why mine didn't seem more dense than I expected it to be; as others have described here.  So, big thumbs up from me as this was my first attempt at home-made beer bread; this recipe was easily better than any restaurant beer bread I've had.

I have made this recipe several times, and it's delicious!! I do make a few changes as suggested by others - cut the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, increase the baking powder to 1 tsp, and add 1 tsp salt. When adding the butter to the top, I simply cut several slices (of real butter!)and let it melt on top, making sure to let the buttery goodness ooze down into the crack in the bread as well. 

One thing I did a bit different this last time - and will do from now on - is to bake the bread in 4 mini loaf pans instead of the larger one. This cut down on the doughiness of the finished loaf and made for a nice even texture. I baked at the same temp, removing the loaves and adding the butter at 25 minutes (instead of the 40), then baking for an additional 10, for a total baking time of 35 minutes.

Everyone who had the bread loved it!  Here is what I did:  used 1/2 cup dark brown sugar, used whole wheat flour, and I was careful not to over mix.  Instead of pouring the butter over at the end, I melted 3 tablespoons of butter in a stoneware bread pan in the oven while it was preheating.  I used 1 tsp of baking powder and the bread rose nicely.  If your bread doesn't rise, check the expiration on the can of baking powder.  I used Yuengling Traditional Lager.  We all loved this beer bread!  So much better than the box mixes you get and much cheaper!

AS WRITTEN, the recipe is too sweet and too low. I followed the directions, but did not put butter on top as we have a lactose intolerant child in the family. Best used for a "sweet" occasion as a tea, brunch, etc., The "bread" (more like a pound cake) would be excellent with jam, fruit butter, any nut butter, or cream cheese. It does not go with a savory menu at all.The next time I make it, I will use much less sugar, more baking powder, and a bit of salt. I'll report back.

I've had beer breads that were addictive and this was not one of them.  I think it had way too much butter and was missing more salt.  I would try another recipe for beer bread next time.

I used a pumpkin spice ale and added a small handful of chopped walnuts to the dough.  I wasn't really happy with it though.  The dough was very dry and thick  (definitely not "pourable") and the bread came out super dense and hard.  The flavor was ok though I would have liked it to be less sweet.  I'll find a different recipe next time.

Too sweet, too greasy, and it DID NOT rise. I always heard that when using brown sugar use baking SODA not baking POWDER. Won’t be trying this one again

This is a dense bread, but the instructions were right on for when to add the melted butter/margarine.  During that last 10 minutes check often with a toothpick and as soon as it comes out clean pull it out of the oven.  So good, I don't even want to share any of the loaf with others, but will with loved ones.

Disappointed. It didn't rise like I thought it would. It's about 1 inch thick. Got a little rubbery texture. ehhh. I wouldn't do it again.

Rated it higher than I would as it stands, because it was a good starting point. Like others, I cut the Sugar and Butter by half, doubled the baking powder and added a 1/2 tsp of salt

Big hit around here! Also experimented with Rosemary and Parmesan

I love it! Naturally, as with any recipe, it needs to be modified for my liking or what it is going to go with. But outside of that I can't stop eaton it!

Pretty good to start with. I decreased the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, made sure the beer was nice and warm before mixing, (this is more important than you think), added about 1/2 tablespoon garlic powder, then a few shakes of garlic salt, and baked in a stoneware loaf pan, using only half the butter in the recipe. Warm beer will make your dough rise better, trust me.

I made this for the first time today to go with a wonderful spinach salad.  It was a very good complement to the salad.  I only used a Tbsp of butter and it was still a little too much, but overall delicious.

Pretty good bread as long as you reduce the butter. I bake a bunch of thick cut strips of bacon beforehand and then lay them out in the pan as I put a little bit of the mixture in at a time so that their is a couple of layers of bacon within the bread.

The bread itself is nice. Good texture, springy-ness, etc. I did add a bit of salt and extra baking powder as suggested by other reviewers. I also halved the amount of butter I poured over the bread and it was still too much. Our bread pan overflowed and the butter burned on the bottom of the oven. We had a smoke-filled house in the middle of an Ohio winter. I will probably make this again, but without the butter.

very good but i made the mistake of baking it in a silicone bread pan & it didn't make a loaf, it was too heavy so it was flat & over baked.  i will definitely make this again but in a metal bread pan.  thanks for this recipe.

This was pretty good, but I like really sweet things.  It was best when eaten warm. The only thing that went wrong with this was my choice of beer.

This recipe for beer bread was good but I thought the 2/3 cup of brown sugar made the finished bread too sweet.
