My family thought this was really good.  I did not have fresh garlic or thyme so I used 1 tbsp garlic powder and 1 tbsp dried thyme.  Also, I did not have a fresh lemon on hand, so no lemon zest.  However, we found that it had a great lemony flavor without the zest.  Very flavorful, but I'm sure it would have been even better with fresh ingredients.  Did I forget to mention this recpe is SUPER EASY AND QUICK!!  5 stars!

Easy to make and lightly flavored chicken.  Did not have lemon zest, flavored cooking spray, or fresh thyme (used jar) but came out great.  We'll make these more!

Like many others,I didn't have the fresh garlic,thyme,or lemon zest. I used 1 tbsp garlic powder, 1 tsp ground thyme & abt 2tsp lemon pepper. Olive oil was also substituted with canola oil....yet it STILL came out Fabulous~! Marinated the chicken for close to 30 minutes as I prepared the alfredo pasta..then baked chicken @ 350 for 30 minutes. It was an amazing combo!

Very good! I used the recipe, but instead of cooking in a skillet, we took it outside to grill. I made kabobs with onion and green peppers to separate the chicken and it turned out great!

Very good. I used chicken breast instead of tenders though and ran into the issue of one of the breasts being too thick. It was a bit dry but that was my own fault. The recipe was great! Will definitely use it again!

I'd give this 3 1/2 stars if I could. This was really very lemony. I do enjoy lemon, but this much lemon was a bit much. My husband really didn't care for this and didn't finish his. I might try this again, but cut the lemon juice by half and just let them marinate for two or three minutes.

My family (four year old and six year old included) LOVED this! Instead of sauteing we threaded the chicken on skewers and grilled it. Amazing! Served with rice and grilled zucchini (which we marinated separately in the same thyme lemon marinade).

Excellant!  Reduced calculted recipe to "two" Used one large boneless chicken breast for three people. Pounded it out for even cooking.  Did not have fresh lemon juice so used bottled and increased the "calulated garlic" to one whole clove and then marintaed for about 30 mins. while I prepared rest of dinner. Fantastic! Served with roasted root veggies and steamed brussel sprouts, all fresh from the garden.  Nothing better!

We have a bumper crop of thyme this year, so I've been searching out recipes that feature it. These tenders turns out delicious! I made a few changes to the recipe: doubled the amount of fresh garlic, added a couple slices worth of freshly ground bread crumbs (for crunch), and cooked indoors on a grill pan. These turned out crispy and savory! My fiancée is a picky eater and he raved about them. Will definitely make again...quick and tasty! I served with mashed potatoes and roasted veggies.

Very flavorful and easy! My first time growing lemon-thyme and using it and I am in love!! I used chicken breasts, marinated like the recipe said, then place the chicken in a glass baking dish. I poured the marinade over the chicken and baked at 375 for 35 minutes. Will definitely serve again!

It was okay.  Family ate it but probably won't ever make again.  Could taste the thyme and lemon easily, there just seemed to be something lacking.

Always use FRESH lemon!  It was just the right amount of tang and seasoning.  Make sure not to overcook.  I served these alongside a tossed green salad with lots of colorful ingredients tossed with homemade italian dressing and a dollop of egg and olive salad on the top.  One of my favorite easy suppers now.  So yummy!

I was looking for something quick and easy to make with my chicken tenderloins, and this fit the bill to a "T"!  Like many others, I had to rely on the dry goods in my pantry (dried thyme and garlic powder, no lemon zest), but it still turned out great!  Even my finicky kids loved the chicken!  This recipe is a definite keeper!

Absolutely delicious!  I made with half the amount of meat suggested but with the same amount for all other ingredients.  I also cut the chicken into chunks.  Wonderful!  Will likely make this a 2x per month dish.

I made the recipe just as directed with one exception of letting the tenders marinate for a couple of hours as I like intense lemon flavor. The result was not over powering. Served with mashed parsnips, green beans and carrots.

I love how easy it was to make this. Most of the ingredients are a staple in my kitchen. I didn't have any lemons so there was no zest but it still was delicious. I'm not sure how long I ended up marinating it because I got a little distracted when I was prepping for dinner but they were delightfully tender and they got the hubby seal of approval. I will be making these again in the future.

DELICIOUS!  Didn't have lemon zest but didn't really need it. I paired it with "Creamy Linguine for Two"  ( recipe you can find here, just do a search)  The chicken can also be put in a salad! Yummy!!

TERRIFIC!!!  Very fresh and tangy.  Kids loved it!  A little strong on lemon flavor, but next time might try to cut that with a little soy sauce or honey, ... Or both!

Quick and easy. My 16 year old son made it for me tonight. He used dried thyme and added some lemon pepper for more flavor. Delicious!

We loved these tenders! I used breasts and boneless thighs strips and dredged them in a flour/breadcrumb coating to seal in the garlic and herbs.

This was very good even though I used dried thyme - just a pinch. Marinated only 1/2 an hour and the flavor was great. Wonderful leftovers. I used chicken tenderloins.

the lemon flavoring is much stronger than the other flavors. so I'd add honey to the seasoning or more thyme

Very good.  I recommend marinating longer than 5 minutes for better flavor throughout.  Needed to cook for closer to 4.5 minutes per side.  First batch looked good but could have been cooked longer.  Heat adjustment could obviously fix this, but the lower flame gave it the perfect browning.

Nice change. Very lemony, but not in a bad way. Tenders came out juicy, which I was pleasantly surprised considering they were cooked in a frying pan. I used real thyme and minced garlic. Used only lemon juice since I didn't have real lemons.  There was a lot of marinade left, so I added mushrooms to the mix and then cooked them after tenders were done. Too lemony, so next time I'll either add some butter or just use less marinade. Super easy and quick!

This was a lovely light meal! I used lemon thyme from my garden and when I put the chicken in the pan to sear on the first side, I added some smoked paprika also the rest of the marinate. It came out soooo juicy with a little Smokey flavor. I paired it with steamed Brussels Sprouts and some garden rice. I will definitely make this again. Thin bone-in pork chops I’m thinking next.

I thought it was pretty good; the family didn’t care for it. Kids said it was “sour”—I guess they didn’t appreciate the strong lemon flavor. If I would’ve had some ranch for them to dip it in though, they probably would’ve been sold. Also worth mentioning, I didn’t have fresh thyme so I had to use 3/4 tsp dried.

Family loved it! I used dried thyme because I didn't have fresh, and I used olive oil to rub the inside of my cast iron frying pan.
It turned out very well.

Very good!  This is becoming a staple in my house.  I split two large boneless skinless breasts in half and marinated in 1/2 c. lemon juice, 2 cloves garlic, tablespoon olive oil, fresh and dried thyme, and approximately 2 teaspoons lemon zest.  I marinated for about 1h, but I wish I would have had a bit longer.  Depending on the thickness of your chicken breast, stovetop grilling takes 5-6 min.

I first soaked my tenders in a brine.  I add the thyme there instead of in the marinate.  My 20 year old niece wants to eat it everyday!!  I also skewed them and cooked them on the grill!

I didn't have fresh spices - so used a tablespoon of garlic powder and a tablespoon of thyme.  I used 1/4 cup of bottled lemon juice.  It was delicious!  I think I will cut back just a tad on the lemon juice next time - but even with the dried spices it was very good.  Thanks.

Not that thyme-y, but definitely lemony. Just tasted ok.
