I never review these recipes, but this one is really really good. I decided to make quiona in my rice cooker instead of my XS crock, so I had a lot left over. I tried this thinking it's  fun way to get it down the hubby. WOW he scarfed them I did make them a bit smaller as they were to be a side dish. they are not a side dish. The next day a neighborhood teenager came over and I offered her one, she spit out her gum and scarfed a few more of them, they are this good.  I will make them again even though I used red quinoa.

These are so good!! why isn't this recipe more popular? I didn't add anything. I cooked it exactly how the recipe says. Oh, except the breadcrumbs were Italian style and it didn't take as long as 8 minutes to cook each side.

I'm not a fan of quinoa by itself, but these were very good. I think they are comparable to Qrunch burgers, but much much cheaper. They will probably become a regular part of our menu.

I love these burgers! I am college student and I make a big batch and then freeze the extra! So easy to reheat and eat quick! I added zucchini, sun dried tomatoes and basil this time and they are to die for! I put the burger on a bed of spinach or any kind of salad for some protein! So yummy!

My family enjoyed these, even my long-time vegetarian daughter, who does not generally like "meat-a-likes."  My husband and son ate them dressed as burgers.  My son said they actually taste like meat.  As we'll soon be trying out vegetarianism for a month, this recipe will definitely go in my keeper file.

I reduced the garlic and cooked them in olive oil.  Cooking them for eight minutes per side burned them.  My cooking time was more like half of that.

Delicious!  Reminds me of potato pancakes, but heartier and without the grease.   I used regular onions and did not have garlic, but the burgers still tasted great.  I  only used 1/2 of the salt , but sprinkled the patties with seasoning salt after they were cooked.  I topped with a dollop of sour cream .  I agree with another reviewer- the patties form better if your hands are wet.  As other reviewers stated, these would be good with jalapenos or sun dried tomatoes.  I will be making this one over and over!  Next time I'll try with cumin or curry!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

First, let me say that I don't like quinoa; it never appealed to me and I never intended to try it. Alas, I had a couple bags that a friend gave me, and I didn't want it to go to waste. All I can say is WOW! This was so satisfying in the most surprising way, even the hubby liked it! I made the following changes to suit our taste: substituted 5 stalks green onion for the sweet onion and added A LOT of paprika and cayenne pepper. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to portion out the mixture which gave me 10 patties. It took a couple minutes on each side to cook too. Definitely will be making these again with different flavor profiles. Thank you for this gem!

This is my first time using quinoa. I'm trying to cut down on rice and bread and a friend mentioned quinoa is a good substitute for rice. The recipe was easy to make. I cooked the quinoa using beef broth to give it a meatier flavor. Yes, there's a certain taste to quinoa but you can add anything you like to this recipe and anything to your burger that I think anyone could enjoy them. I did make my patties fatter, - made 6 instead of 9 and 2 burgers totally filled me up, but the consistency was close to a burger and none of the greaseness of a burger. I hope they are just as good after being in the fridge overnight and re-heated for lunch.

These are very tasty. I followed some of the suggestions from earlier reviews. The paprika was a great idea. With the last 2 I mixed in some cayenne pepper that was good for a little kick and some additional flavor. Use wet hands when forming the patties, that will make things a bit easier.

I didn't quite know what to expect, but this was excellent. As another reviewer mentioned, the texture was even similar to a beef hamburger. I made a few changes just to accommodate our tastes. I used one beef bouillon cube when cooking the quinoa. I increased the paprika and added Cajun seasoning.  Excellent with or without cheese on top.

Followed the recipe as written except I used seasoned bread crumbs sold in a cardboard tube at Walmart, C4.  I use a 1/3 cup per patty and cook them on low on my stove for 8 min. on each side and they turn out perfect.  I have used them in place of meat for hamburgers with all the trimmings and enjoyed it.  I have made gluten free using rice crumbs and spices for my sons girlfriend, with success, but I prefer the seasoned bread crumbs.  I even like the left overs cold with a salad.

I was a little worried about Quinoa; I've never had it & I'm a very picky eater. This was very pleasing! I added fresh diced  Jalepeño Peppers to add spice (experimenting) and it went so good with the flavor! (I added only a portion of Jalepeño but I'd recommend being generous with it depending on the serving size of course) I had a difficult time shaping them, mine fell apart a bit, but not too bad. Took maybe 3-4 minutes on each side to crisp. I fried it in butter as instructed. I added provolone cheese and yellow mustard just as toppings and it was absolutely delicious! I'll definitely be adding this to my favorites!!

The burgers have a great crunch, but are kind of bland. The parmesan that I used wasn't super flavorful, so that was probably part of the problem. Next time I will try adding some spices.

I love quinoa, so I was really excited about this recipe. I used and did everything it said, except that I didn’t have regular bread crumbs, so I substituted panko. I doubt it was a good idea because the patties essentially had no taste. I don’t know if they would have been that much better with regular bread crumbs. I kept thinking the taste would’ve improved if I’d have sauteed the onions before I added them. The patties also kept falling apart. I later added another egg and that definitely helped them stay together. Unfortunately, this was a bust for me. I’m either going to add black beans to the mixture and turn it into more of a veggie burger (recipe on Allrecipes) or throw it away, which I hate doing. For anyone who’s interested, there’s a great recipe in the site for cottage cheese patties. I read the ingredients and thought, “yuck!” But they’re actually really, really good! This was good to some people as well, so try it and see!

So good!  Didn’t change anything.  They look like my salmon patties but taste more like beef. My husband even ate them and he doesn’t like quinoa.

We really liked these! I made them just as written. I prefer this to the quinoa black bean burgers from this site. My meat eater husband said they don’t scratch the burger itch, but that he enjoyed them as their own thing.

The only change I made was adding some cayenne pepper and I swapped out garlic cloves for a smaller amount of garlic powder. It was great! Giving it a little bit of a bite was a really good idea in my opinion. I think you can be pretty experimental with it and add some extra chopped vegetables or seasonings if you want to. Personally I would've loved mine with avocado as a topping. Overall loved!

The adjustments I made:  Increased garlic to 4 cloves, decreased salt to ¼ teaspoon, added ½ teaspoon black pepper, ¼ t dried basil.  Instead of 9 small patties I made 4 large patties.  The burgers were excellent and I will definitely be making this recipe often.

I added a bit more cheese and garlic and they were delicious. They did not take the 8 minutes to cook on medium heat either. My husband, who rolls his eyes every time I say we are having quinoa gobbled them up!

OK I’d like to start off by saying I am a terrible cook. But my burgers wouldn’t stay together and were very bland. The batch I made was way more than 8 burgers and took forever to cook.  There’s a chance I did something incorrect but not worth it to me to try again.

I would love to make this recipe again and again! I only found one flaw. too much garlic for my taste. Overall, the recipe was quite good!

I really was surprised at how good these tasted.  Made the recipe exactly as written but only made 1/4 of the amount because I only had 1 egg.  Made 5 medium sized pancakes and more than enough for me.  Spread sour cream on top and will definitely make again.  I cut the onions fine with my P. Chef chopper.

I used  Giant Eagle brand steamable Quinoa and added red Bell peppers and Garlic powder, seasoned bread crumbs and only 2 eggs, they came out great whole family loved them.

I used shallots and scallions instead of garlic and onion, and did 2/3 quinoa and 1/3 brown rice made in a rice cooker.

Love these! Even better as a cold snack so I make a double batch and keep them in the fridge.

Absolutely fantastic. I see no need to ever eat a beef or turkey burger again. Followed the recipe as noted and can't wait to invite friends over to enjoy.

We ate these more like a fritter than a burger. Great base recipe, but a little bland on their own  (but better than most veggie burgers we've tried! Stayed together well.) Husband topped with hot sauce. 

Will definitely make again and modify for our tastes, possibly add corn and cayenne.

My children liked these and ate willingly (when they could dip in catsup). My husband and I agreed that they don't need as much garlic as recipe calls for.

I whipped a couple of these burgers up for my wife and I and we couldn't be happier, delicious! I added some paprika and chili powder and used white onion instead just because that's what I had. I will definitely be making these again.

These are great!!! they were filling and delicious! Hubby couldn't get enough of them!
Added some grated zucchini and a few diced jalapenos, but in my opinion, they didn't need the jalapenos - lots of flavor already. I would definitely make them again..!

I made this the first time, by the recipe, and also found it a little plain tasting.  Second time, I swapped the onion for some diced Jalepeno.  That made them very savory, and very good.
