I made this for a big family dinner and it was a huge hit!  I also made a graham cracker crust instead of using a pastry crust. This pie is so easy to make and the taste and texture is delectable.  Will definitely make it again.

I made this for a dinner at church.  Our preacher just loves chocolate pie.  I used Herseys milk chocolate chips instead of the dark chocolate.  It is a really good pie if you like it being really chocolatey.

This recipe is always on my Thanksgiving menu and everyone loves it!  It is rich, creamy, silky smooth, and looks luscious. The only change I make is that I always use milk chocolate chips instead the dark chocolate chips (I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate). If you like chocolate pie, you will adore this recipe!

Personally, I think this pie deserves 10 stars. I made this pie the first time for my mother's birthday in December, and am making it again today for my grandfather's birthday. The only difference this time is I'm making 2!! Delicious topped with French Vanilla Cool Whip and sprinkled with more of those scrumptious dark chocolate chips.

It was easy to make and turned out well, but think it was too chocolatly for me.  I even used semi-sweet chocolate chips. If I were to make it again, I would use milk chocolate chips.I also used a cookie crust.

I made this pie for my father and brother for Thanksgiving and they loved it. I loved it because it was so simple to make; however I also am guilty of eating a piece or two myself. As a result, I will also be making it for Christmas.

Very good and easy, held up in heat better than a pudding mix pie.  I used cookie crust and milk Choc. chips, next time will try dark chips.

Oh my goodness... this pie is amazing! I didn't make any changes at all. It's  very easy to make (especially if you are staying in the dorms with only a microwave and a fridge). It's very rich though, so take it slow!

Consistency was perfect.  I don't think it needed a topping, but I love dark chocolate.  Very rich and tasty!

the cornstarch was lumpy, otherwise yummy! I used Semi Sweet Choc chips for a not quite so rich pie, also use a graham cracker crust.

This is very good - wonderful texture and consistency (once chilled). It didn't get that final star because the flavor wasn't really above average - it was a dark chocolate version of MCL's chocolate pie. I would suggest some more flavor (either whipped cream or meringue) or maybe adding raspberry flavoring. Again, perfect texture - could be more flavorful.

This pie was excellent.  It's a very rich pie. I recommend it for any chocoholic.  This pie is not for someone who does not appreciate rich chocolate flavor.

Used milk chocolate chips -- came out good.  Tip: don't use the spray whipped cream, it turns watery very quickly.  I'll use cool whip next time.

*WoW*! Terrific recipe!!! My dad (a confirmed chocoholic) greatly approves and has had me make three of these pies in the last couple of days - two for us, and one to give as a thank-you. We go through them like, umm... chocolate. :D

Very rich, I prefer to use 1/2 a teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1/2 a teaspoon of almond extract instead of the directed 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract. Yummo!!!

This pie was too bitter tasting with the dark chocolate. It was definitely richer than chocolate pie made with the traditional pudding, but I would use lighter chocolate next time.

Took this to a big family dinner, and everyone loved it - except my husband, who said it was "too rich and too chocolatey."  Who knew there was such a thing as too chocolatey?  Everyone else thought it was the very best chocolate pie they'd ever had.  Definitely worth a try!

This was an excellent recipe, but I couldn't get a perfectly smooth consistencey. I finally decided to vitamix the whole filling prior to putting it into the shell. I also substitued 1/2 tsp of the vanilla for 1/2 tsp of almond extract.  With these modifications, it is the best pie I've made.

I've made this three times now and it's always gone within 2 days.  I used an oreo cookie crumb crust and topped the whole pie with whipped cream.  It is so chocolatey good and each bite melts in your mouth.

Excellent pie. I used a graham cracker crust, because that's what I had on hand, and it turned out great. It is a very rich pie so it will serve many. Easy to make and delicious. Will make again.
