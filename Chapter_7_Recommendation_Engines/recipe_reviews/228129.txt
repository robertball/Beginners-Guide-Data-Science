Of all the deviled eggs recipes I've tried from this site Hubs thought this one of the best.  For me these were fairly average, but he appreciated their simplicity, enjoying that they didn't have a lot of added  "stuff" in them.  "A deviled egg," he said, "should taste like a deviled egg."

I made these for Thanksgiving tommorrow. I think, it is kind of hard to mess up a deviled egg. With that being said, the dill taste and garlic powder were a little stronger than I cared for when I first made them. However, the next day they tasted very good for some reason. I used Duke's regular mayonnaise and it worked well. For the dill I did use dry, but used 1/3 of the amount as suggested on my spice bottle if subbing for fresh. I made 9 eggs, so I just did 1 1/2 times the recipe. Although, I did end up adding 2-3 more spoons of mayo, after tasting, as I guess I just like them a little more creamy and a little extra dijon to taste. I decided to add a little of the dill on top for a garnish despite it being dry. I thought it looked a little like dry grass, but then after I sprinkled on some red paprika it took on a Christmasy appearance. I thought they were good, but others really liked them, so I will make them again next year.

There seem to be two categories of deviled eggs: the dijon / mayo / vinegar flavor or the sweet / miracle whip flavor. Generally speaking, people tend to love one version and hate the other. As you can probably tell from the recipe, this is the dijon / mayo / vinegar version, and it's the best one I've ever used. Fantastic! Now if only my sweetheart weren't a traitorous sweet / miracle whip version fan.

I have tried five or six allrecipes.com five star recipes from this site and, frankly, did not like any of them.  At all.  As in, "Seriously?  This was rated five stars?  I can't even eat it!"  However, this deviled egg recipe did not disappoint like the others.  A classic egg recipe that has a bit of the tart bite that I remember and love.  I made these eggs for Christmas Eve with no alterations and they were a huge hit.  I made them again for Christmas Day dinner and added one thin slice of very finely chopped red onion and about 2 T (maybe less then a quarter of a stalk) of finely chopped celery and they were even better.

This will be my Go To egg recipe from here on out.  There is no need to try another one.  Thank you!

If you're serving immediately half the garlic powder because its very strong. If serving the next day serve as is. When the egg mixture has time to sit, the garlic flavor calms down a bit.

Love, love, love. Tangy, pretty and easy. It's fun to experiment with other versions but this one is the one that reminds me of the version I grew up with, it's pure comfort food and the MOST popular item on the potluck table. If you cut them on the short side and put them back in the paper carton, you do not have a dish to recover after the potluck, and they do not slide around on the way there. I sprinkle with paprika (because my Mom did) and garnish with parsley or cilantro or something fresh and green. Use Ken's Perfect Hard Boiled Egg recipe to guarantee success.

Excellent classic deviled egg. Classic to me, anyway =) ... I don't care for Dijon, so used regular spicy brown mustard. I might add a bit more vinegar next time, but will definitely save and use this recipe. Too often, my deviled eggs taste different every time I make them. Sometimes a good thing...sometimes not!

I really liked this recipe for making deviled eggs for my first time ever!! My husband loved it as well! I did substitute the mayo with miracle whip instead to see how much flavor I'd end up with. Turned out too flavorful!  Lol. But overall, great!!

Exactly what I was looking for!!  The only change I made was I used half miracle whip and half mayo instead of all mayo.  Perfect!

This is my first time making deviled eggs and I thought they were very good! I did make a few changes just because I used what I had on hand. I used rice vinegar instead of the rice wine vinegar and my garlic powder has parsley mixed into it so I used that. No dill for me since I had none, I decided to use some smoked paprika for color and added it on top at the end for presentation. Thank you for sharing!

Really yummy. I like the Dijon mustard and the vinegar in these deviled eggs. I also am a fan of real mayonnaise rather than using miracle whip. Makes it taste so much better. I added a pinch of sugar to counteract some of the vinegar. They were a hit at the dinner I brought them too.

Really nice consistency to the filling. We substituted 1/4t dried dill and sprinkled the finished eggs lightly with smoked paprika.  These were a BIG hit.

This was really good. I substituted the rice wine vinegar with balsamic vinegar since my rice wine vinegar has been in the cupboard for years and it was definitely expired. I knew it would give a different taste but I wanted to make eggs so I went do with that. It worked out really well. So for those who don't have the rice wine vinegar on hand, try balsamic vinegar. It's good too! The use of Dijon mustard was what made it a five star.

This recipe is very simple, yet tasty! I omitted the salt, and added a tiny bit more mayo and mustard. I also had some fresh dill on hand, so I used that and eyeballed it, as I love dill.

This recipe was OK but thought there was far too much salt. I would omit the salt altogether and add a little dry mustard to give it some zip.

These deviled eggs are very easy to make, and they taste surprisingly well! They remind me of my Danish Grandfather's deviled eggs, which he always made at christmas time, when I was a child, so they also have a melancholic feel to them for me!

The recipe doesnât tell you how to cook the eggs and itâs very important for a creamy texture. I brought about 2 inches of water to a gentle boil, then put the eggs in, covered them and boiled them for 15 minutes. After that transfer to an ice bath and peel when theyâre cool.

These are the only deviled eggs I make now  (sorry, Chef John!), and I've made them many times.  They're perfect when made exactly as the recipe states, but at times, I've added a bit more vinegar and mustard because we like the extra tanginess, and then decreased the mayo accordingly. I also usually add a full 1/2 teaspoon of dried dill because we love it's flavor.

This is my go to recipe for deviled eggs...or as my grandkids say, âstuffed eggsâ. 
I sometimes serve a bit of caviar on top, decadent yumminess!

This was the best deviled egg I have ever tasted.  I was missing the don mustard so I did not add that.  I also was missing vinegar so I just used a little wine instead.  It was fantastic.

This is my go-to deviled egg recipe and I haven't found anyone who doesn't love it!  I live in NC so I use Duke's mayo, and I think that's key. Growing up, I didn't like deviled eggs but my tastes changed and this recipe hits the spot. I love it.

I have made these 3 times already. They disappear so quickly at every event.  Here are the changes, mostly because I did not have all the exact ingredients. I omitted the dill all together. Used 1/2 tsp spicy brown mustard instead of dijon mustard.  Decorate the top with sliced black olives, and a little sprinkle of paprika. They taste great ! One batch I added 1/2 tsp Bacon bits. Very good either way.

These were great traditional deviled eggs. I tripled the recipe and made them exactly as directed, with the addition of about a teaspoon of dill pickle juice. The fresh dill is what makes this recipe so flavorful. I piped the filling in with a pastry bag and sprinkled with paprika and more chopped dill before serving.

We followed the recipe exactly and these were very good! They were perfect when the filling was first mixed. However, after leaving them in fridge for an hour before serving, they seemed much saltier. I will try them again with out any salt and see how they turn out.

Followed the recipe with one omission - did not add garlic powder. The dill weed and rice vinegar are what brought these above the average deviled egg. Thanks!

I'm making these for the fourth time now.  Who knew?  i've always just thrown stuff together - sometimes they're good, sometimes just okay.  Now I use this recipe EVERY TIME!  I love it, and as a low-carber, it fits well into my menus.

I loved the texture, but (and maybe it was lost in doubling the recipe) I found that for my flavor profile, there was a little too much. I think were I to do it again, single or double, I would cut the vinegar and the mustard in half. Otherwise, I enjoyed them greatly and my visiting family did as well!

Pretty good........but we prefer them with Miracle Whip.... try Keene's Dry Mustard (1Tbsp) some time...  and always a dash of Paprika on top!  Deviled Eggs are always a hit!!  Just for fun, at Easter dye the whites pink, blue, green with food coloring before stuffing them!

There is too much mayo  cut it back, add 2 tsp fresh minced onion. I used white but green very good too.  It was too runny and too salty.  which to me means too much Mayo.  good basic recipe other than that.  
The second time much better with some Wasabi instead of Dijon.  Also with Horseradish instead of mustard.

This is my go-to for deviled eggs with a couple of minor changes. I add about 1 tablespoon of very finely chopped onion and use just vinegar instead of rice wine vinegar. Really delicious!

I made it originally as directed and it was great. Also later omitted the dill, added pickle juice instead of vinegar and added pickle bits too. Simple, clean, good.

I made 18 deviled eggs for an event I was attending.  I adjusted the amounts and except for using dried dill, followed the recipe exactly.  It was really yummy, although I always have trouble with deviled eggs making the filling smooth.  I feel like I am doing something wrong, but the egg yolks are hard to mix smoothly. Loved this recipe.

This was super easy to make! I didnât measure everything to the T as I only had a spoon on hand, so you really canât go wrong as long as the ratios are close. I also didnât have the vinegar but I substitute it with a tsp or tbsp of sweet relish and it works! Thanks for the awesome recipe. Canât wait to bring it to my potluck this Friday :D

I used this recipe for Easter and most were gone before the meal was even served.  I didn't put in any dill but only because I didn't have any on hand.  They were a big hit and I will use this recipe again.

I didn't have fresh dill, used a little sweet pickle relish instead. It was well liked.  Good thing. I made 40 of them.

I made this recipe as it was written with no variance.  I didnât taste and tossed everything in.  At first I thought that was a fatal error because the dill and Dijon were very strong.  Then I looked at reviews and some found that to be the case too but then said let it sit overnight and it makes a huge difference.  Well, it really did.  The next day when I planned to serve them they were just perfect.  I didnât need to go into damage control at all.  I will make these again. The family loved them and asked for the recipe!!

Yum! My first time making my own deviled eggs. Subbed dill pickle juice instead of vinegar because I knew I'd appreciate. Smoked paprika sprinkled on top is awesome.

Amazing!! Absolutely the best deviled eggs!! I use Apple cider vinegar instead of rice vinegar but follow the rest of the recipe exactly and never have enough!  I have made them several times in the past couple years and everyone raves about them each and every time! Fantastic and simple!

Simple savory deviled eggs. We subbed the fresh dill for dried, but it still had great flavor. I usually use red wine vinegar but I think the rice vinegar and the garlic powder made all the difference! This will probably be our future go to just out of simplicity!

My family enjoyed these eggs.  I did add a bit more vinegar & mustard to taste but I also made 9 eggs & used the quantity substitute tool so maybe that's why I needed the adjustments.

Excellent recipe. The rice wine vinegar gives in the perfect hint of zing. If you prefer a less creamy yolk mixture you might want to cut back on the mayo a little. I also sprinkled mine with Hungarian paprika. Thank you!

Great recipe!  Used Rice Vinegar instead of Rice Wine Vinegar because that's what I had on hand.  Hubs is a true Miracle Whip deviled egg lover but he gave these 2 thumbs up over the MW version.  Added fresh cooked bacon crumbles on top - YUMMO!

Personal preference - I leave out the dill, and I add a dash of black pepper. Otherwise, this is my âgo toâdeviled egg recipe. Itâs always a hit at pot

I make these for any special occasion and everyone loves them! My mom said that theyâre the best deviled eggs sheâs ever had. We didnât have any rice wine vinegar, so I used red wine vinegar instead. I also didnât use fresh dill, I used chopped, dried dill.

Told by several people this is the best deviled eggs ever.  I followed the recipe exactly, then adjusted a bit too taste.  I found that it tasted much better after a few hours in the fridge.  Will definitely make again.

I thought this egg filling was basically okay and certainly traditional.  I made the recipe at first exactly as written, except tripled everything in proportion for a large party.  As I taste-tested before filling the eggs, I thought it somewhat bland and lacked something, so I found myself adding salad dressing to give it a bit more "zing", which is what I'm used to.  I am keeping this recipe and will make it again with the one change I made to it.  The "3" represents the filling before my change.

I made it as listed. Very bland, unless a hint of rice vinegar blows up your skirt. I've made hundreds of deviled eggs for context , plenty of bad ones and several good too. Skip this recipe and find the one with zing (not miracle wip zing). Cheers!

This was a pretty good recipe.  I like the addition of the dill.  It is missing that pop.  My mom used to add a touch of pickle juice.  I'll have to try that next time.  I also had the suggestion of the dusting of paprika on top.

Not bad for a bit more flavor compared to other "classic" versions. But, I found the amount of spices to be a tad too much/strong. Especially the garlic, and I loooove garlic- but this was just a bit too strong to where it took over with a punch instead of a little kick. 
Tried to add a little more mayo to tone it down because the amount of garlic with the dill ended up giving it a very strong aftertaste, but more mayo made it too runny to hold up a nice shape. I didn't have Dijon mustard, but regular worked fine- was glad it was regular in the long run after discovering the overly spiced flavor- Dijon would have been TOO much, along with the spices. 
Good, easy recipe for classic deviled eggs... I just suggest cutting the dill & garlic in half.

These were just okay for us.  I actually love garlic, but in this I felt it threw the taste off a bit.  It might of even been the vinegar also that we didn't like.  Either way they were still enjoyed and eaten all up.  But I do prefer other recipes for deviled eggs better.  Sorry for the average review but I did enjoy making the recipe!  Thank You!

I like different flavor deviled eggs and this recipe gave me just that. Loved the change using dill as the base flavor. I only had dried dill on hand, so I sprinkled a little extra on top at the end. Very good flavors and with fresh dill I am sure it would be even better!

The only reason this didn't get a five star rating from me is because I had to alter the recipe a little based on what I had available, but even with a few substitutions, it was incredible. I could tell the real deal would be a 5* no question! Fantastic savory eggs. I like mine with paprika so I did garnish with that, as well.

This was a BIG hit- little disclaimer is that I modified the recipe quite a bit.  I used the mayo,dijon and vinegar as directed however I added a little smoked paprika, garlic powder as well as finely crumbled bacon bits to the mixture.  It gave it a nice smoky flavor.

i was looking for a simple recipe and found it...just what i was looking for..i didn't give it 5 stars because i didn't have all the ingredients..but i think it would probably be close..i didn't have rice wine vinegar, i subbed red wine vinegar, i didn't have fresh dill and didn't want to use dried so i just put a little dill pickle juice from one of my jars in to taste...a couple drops of tabasco because i like to add it to stuff..and i sprinkled some paprika on top..turned out fine..i read some reviews about too much salt..i don't usually use a lot of salt and it tasted fine to me but probably could survive without it...it was creamy not thick like mostly egg yolk but that is the texture i wanted. i guess if you like it less creamy maybe reduce the mayo??..anyway...i've saved it, i'll make it again.

First attempt at making deviled eggs, glad for the base seasoning and spice list! I added minced thyme which made it taste fancy. A bit of sugar helped round out the flavor I was looking for :) as always cooks, adjust to taste

I will make these deviled eggs again. I used regular mustard because I didn't have Dijon . Used regular vinegar because I didn't have rice wine vinegar. I had to use dried dill addd only half because I thought it might be too much. Next time I will add what is called for. Excellent

They were too bland.  I followed the recipe, with the exception of the fresh dill--I used dried dill instead.  I don't know if that made them bland or not.

These were okay, I needed a lot more mustard in ratio to the mayonnaise.  I'll make again in the future though.

Wow!  On a whim, I decided to look for a different way to make deviled eggs. I saw this recipe which has twice the amount of ingredients of my normal deviled eggs, so I was skeptical at first. But I decided to jump in and give it a try!  I didn't follow exact measurements as listed in the recipe, but I did include all of them and kind of eye-balled the amounts. Instead of fresh dill, I used dried. Man, when I tasted them, I was in heaven!  The rice wine vinegar totally changes the flavor and gives it a little tang, and then adding the garlic powder and dill weed just made my tastebuds sing and dance!  I look forward to trying them tomorrow after sitting overnight.

I have to say that I really do not like eggs but I made these for my husband who loves deviled eggs. I did switch the vinegar to using dill pickle brine instead and since that is pretty salty I omitted the salt.  I used smoked paprika and flat leaf parsley on top. My husband said it was definitely a "keeper". He loved them!

This was what I had on hand.  Everyone loved them, but it was missing the crunch that I normally like, so I added some relish, which I did like better.  I didn't have Dijon, just regular, and it was alright.  Would I make this again?  I would definitely try it with Dijon next time.

I did not make any changes other than doubling the recipe. It was my first try making deviled eggs. I love the fresh dill.

One person sad they were almost "too pretty to eat."

Will definitely make again.

I liked these eggs but they were missing a little something. I have no idea what that something is, I simply recognize it's absence. That having been said, I had all ingredients on hand and the eggs were tasty. I mixed up all ingredients except the egg yolks the day before Easter so all I had to do was add them after the kiddos finished their Easter egg hunt. It worked perfectly.

I haven't made these in years, so I went looking for a recipe, and this one is a keeper!  I brought these to a party and my friend's 10 year old son informed me that he doesn't like deviled eggs.  And then he ate about 5 of them!  I'm not usually a big fan of fresh dill, but it was perfect in this recipe!  I'm making another batch right now before my dill goes bad and because my girls have gone quite crazy laying eggs with the longer days!!  Definitely recommend this recipe!!

Followed the recipe exactly except no garnish. My family is Crazy about them! Taking a couple dozen to church social tomorrow. Just tangy enough without being overpowering.

Great recipe and will be using it again! I made one change that  added a dimension of flavor. I used balsamic vinegar instead of the regular kind. That also makes the filling a bit darker.

I followed everything to the letter and found it a little too sour, so I added a bit more salt and 1/2 tsp sugar plus quite a generous helping of black pepper, and it turned out great. This is a great base recipe and variations are always possible.

These were edible, but that's about as excited as I can get when describing these.  Definitely I will never make these again...I threw almost all of them out because no one would eat them.  Big fail for us... :-(

These were a big hit with the kids. I substituted the rice vinegar and used sweet relish. Then I topped them with paprika & they were gone in 30 minutes. Thanks for the recipe.

These were ok eggs. I wasnât impressed by the brown mustard and prefer yellow mustard. I also didnât like how super creamy the yolk base was. I made these the night before and the next day the yolks were really soft and oozing everywhere. It also tasted to bland for our liking so we upped the amounts of spices mustard etc. I know I wonât be making these again

I am giving 5 stars as I believe it would still have been fabulous(Probably even Better) had I kept to the recipe. I did not have some of the ingredients so I used pickle juice to cover the dill, vinegar, and salt requirements. Whole family loved it so all is well that ends well.

As is, no changes. 

A definite twist on a classic recipe. The dijon/dill seems to add a more mature flavor to the standard egg yolk and mayonnaise combo.

My palette was confused a bit as my memories are colored by picnics and potlucks over 26 years of knowing what deviled eggs should taste like. But this was quite a delicate surprise with the sharpness of dill vs the light smokiness of the usual paprika. The rice vinegar adds a touch of lightness to the flavor and gives the normal heaviness of the mayonnaise a lift. 

The dijon is present but not in such a rude way as to overshadow the yolkiness at the heart of the dish. They seem to flow together well with each giving way to each other, almost if out of politeness to one another. 

Overall a great spin on what is normal picnic faire, but given enough class to pair well with a Reisling or light chardonnay.

Fantastically zesty - just how I like it.  I substituted some light sour cream for some of the mayo and couldn't tell a difference (2/3 mayo, 1/3 sour cream).

Very tasty.  One of my guests isn't able to eat garlic so I left it out.  That was the only thing that I did differently.

The flavors all worked out well together. I used fresh dill from my garden, and that makes a big difference over dried, of course. However, for some reason the yolk mixture was very runny, almost watery. There was only a small amt of rice vinegar, so I cannot account for this.

I've typically made my deviled eggs similar to this before but have never tried rice vinegar in them. To me, perfect portions of everything! Thx for sharing!

My family loved these. I like a deviled egg with a little kick. These were perfect. Not bland but not too overpowering either. I omitted the salt  and used white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar. This will be my new go to recipe.
