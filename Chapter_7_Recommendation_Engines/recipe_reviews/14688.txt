Yum! This recipie was really good for a quick dinner. (Although it definitely needed some tweaking) I used 6 servings of potatoes to just barely cover the 9x13. I added chopped onions to the beef, and cooked the macaroni for about 10 minutes (until it was done) while adding a little water every few minutes to keep it from burning. I also put gravy over the beef mix, and I put cheese over the potatoes. It turned out great!

We found the noodles & potatoes to be redundant so I used 1 10 oz box of frozen mixed veggies instead (I partially thawed them 1st).  Also, we found this to be too bland for our tastes so I added worcestershire sauce, onion powder, pepper & a couple shakes of Tabasco for more flavor.  6 servings of potatoes left a thin frosting on top.  I will use 8 servings the next time.

what can you say bad about this recipe?  Everyone likes it and it's super easy to make after a long day at work.  Plus, you can customize it according to your tastes or what you happen to have on hand that day.  I always add corn & mushrooms.  I also, like other reviewers, make more potato's than the recipe calls for.  I've found that making a serving for 6 (according to the box) covers a 9x13 pan perfectly.  We also add the cheese during the last 10 min's of baking - just enough to melt it.  Great recipe for a cold winter's day !!  Thanks Cathy

I used Onion Soup mix (store didn't have beef onion flavor) and it worked out fine.  I made enough mashed potatoes for 10 servings (according to product box) - and that was just right. 2 cups of mashed potatoes is definitely not enough to cover a 13x9 pan.  I added 1 can of corn, and 1 can of green beans, and topped it all off with both paprika and shredded cheddar cheese. I found that 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef was the perfect amount.  Hubby loved it, it was very flavorful and a great comfort food!

This recipe was simple and super easy. I added 1 can diced tomatoes and used real mashed potatoes instead of instant,added frozen mixed vegetables and I put shredded cheese on top of hamburger mixture before putting mashed potatoes in. I will make this i'm sure over and over again...

I had to use Beef Onion Soup Mix too.  This was very good but I would add some vegetables to it the next time i make it.

Very tasty dish that is quick & easy to make. I used 2 lbs ground beef and added some carrots (cubed), canned green beans and corn to make the dish more colorful.  Onion soup mix (1 packet) gave the dish a good flavor.  Idaho instant potatoes worked very well and was a great time-saver. I used about 8 cups of mashed potatoes in order to get a decent amount to spread on top of the beef mixture (my 9x13 baking dish was full). This is a great 1-dish meal!

Easy and tasty!  The best kind of recipe!  I did add cheese to the top but I think this time I am going to put the cheese between the meat and potatoes.  We all loved this one.

Quick, easy, and yummy!!Followed the reciped for the most part with just a few modifications: added canned mushrooms and a can of corn to the meat mixture before putting it in the baking dish. Placed a thin layer of cheese onto the meat mixture and covered with the potatoes per reviewers used 6-8 cups so it would cover the top of the casserole. Sprinkled paprika and after baking for 10 minutes covered top with cheese baked for another 10 minutes. Turned out great!! If you don't want any crunch in your mix, don't add corn. If you like the crunch corn is the way to go!

This is yummy comfort food, but I'm giving it three stars because I had to make some changes. After reading the reviews, here's what I did: used 1 1/2 pounds of beef, boiled the noodles separately for 8 minutes (to al dente), added 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 cup of frozen mixed vegetables to the beef, noodle, onion soup mix, and I topped it with 10 servings of instant mashed potatoes and shredded colby jack cheese. Without the cream of mushroom soup, I think it would be good served with beef gravy. Like I said, this is yummy comfort food!

This was just an "okay" dish for me. It was a bit bland even after adding veggies and cheese. Needs more spices. Very easy to prepare though.

I thought this was excellent. Quick, easy and full of flavor. I added corn & left out the paprika. We really enjoyed it. Thank you.

I am always looking for hearty inexpensive good casseroles so this one got my attention.  Not my fav. My husband really liked it.  Maybe adding a can of cream of mushroom to the ground beef mixture would've helped?

I haven't made this however it sounds really good! My coment is the the person who said that any dish made with beef should not have "Shepard" in the name. Well, "Sheprds" Pie has been around a long time and always has beef.

This was great and I usually don't like Shepherd's Pie. I added some dried onion and garlic powder when browning the meat. I also added a can of mixed veggies and cheddar cheese before adding the potatoes. I will for sure be making this again.

This was easy and tasty. I,however, added 1 can pinto beans as a layer on top of the beef,sprinkled with bacon bits, and added some shredded cheese on top of the potatoes. I like this recipe because you can do so much with it as far as flavoring.

This recipe was VERY easy and my family ate it pretty well. It is a great recipe to have on hand for those quick dinner nights. I felt like there was something missing, but couldn't figure it out. I did add corn and cheese per other suggestions, making it a whole meal. I will make this again.

This was a great, easy recipe.  I spiced it up a bit and added carrots and corn.  Oh yes, and I too made wayyy more potatoes than the recipe called for and it was perfect (made 8 cups instead of 2).  Perfect when you don't have much time and want something great.  Awesome comfort food.

My family absolutely loved it!!!  This is one of the most easiest dinners to prepare.  I followed a previous recommendation and made more potatoes than the recipe called for.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  I was able to find the Knorr beef with onion soup mix someone suggested.  I will definitely serve this the next time I need to make a quick dinner.

I try not to rate anything unless I tried it as written, I was tempted to add to this but I didn't. I gave it three stars because my crew likes boring bland food and there was no leftovers, I though it was awful.

Very simple and very good! I had to use regular onion soup mix and egg noodles because that's all I had. This will be in our regular rotation...so glad I tried it!

A huge hit! Best part was that between this & Martha's Veg. Beef Soup, I got 2 meals from nearly identical ingredients.  Didn't have noodles; used old frozen hash browns. Added frozen mixed vegetables. Couldn't be an easier recipe.

Great Comfort Food!  I followed several rater suggestions:  added slice onion, garlic powder and worchester sauce. Cooked the noodles til al dente.  When assembling, added cheese between the beef mixture and mashed potatoes (6 cups covered 9x13).  Got raves reviews!  It's a keeper!

This is a quick meal to make and it was very tasty. Well, it was either noodles or the mashed potatoe because that's just too much starch for my family so I went with intant potatoes.  Also used 1 1/2 lbs. of ground beef.  Added green beans to the mix and used the instant onion soup mix but added some low sodium beef broth as it was turning a little dry.  Also, I used a large cast iron skillet to simmer everything  and after topping with the potatoes I just popped the iron skillet into the oven to bake. Next time I will add some shredded cheddar to top the potatoes.

I really had high hopes for this recipe!  But I found it quite dry.  Only changes I made were to use leftover homemade mashed potatoes and added some frozen mixed veggies and cheese.  It was a little better for leftovers when I added some beef gravy.  I wouldn't make this again, though.

My family loves this!  Super easy!  Our 5 year old daughter calls it "Potato Cake".  I add 1 cup frozen peas and use rotelle noodles (that's what I happened to have on hand the first time I made this).  Always comes out good.  Thanks for sharing this one.
Very easy to tweak for a gluten free meal too.

I'm giving this recipe three stars because my husband really liked it.  I found it bland and dry and didn't really enjoy it.  I will make it again though, since my husband really liked it.  Maybe it just needs a little tweaking to appeal to me.  Thanks though for submitting the recipe.

Needed dinner in a pinch one night, whipped this up and it was a big hit! My husband and 1 yr old daughter loved it. I didn't have the beef stew mix, so I used a can of cream of celery and reduced the hot water by 1/2cup. I added a little cayenne pepper to the meat/soup/noodle mix. After adding the potatoes, I sprinkled shredded cheddar and the paprika over the whole thing. It was SO good! I'll be making this again.

Yum!  I really liked this recipe.  I followed some of the other suggestions and added extra (instant) mashed potatoes, 1 chopped red potato, corn, carrots and cheddar cheese on top.  My fiance (who is generally a very picky eater) loved it.

Recipe is pretty good and quick.  Instead of mashing the potatoes, I cut the raw potatoes (peeled) in round thin slices (Scalloped) mixed in a mushroom soup and spreaded on top of the beef mixture(Cooked beef, pasta, carrots, corn, peas, beans and tomato soup).  Tasted excellent and my husband and kids loves it.

My husband was really skeptical, this is not real shepherds pie, but he loved it.  I halved the recipe for two but needed to add a little more water to cook the macaroni.  I used homemade onion soup mix from this site (easy to half) and also added a little milk and cornstarch to thicken it up before baking it.  I made homemade mashed potato's using 3 and it all fit really well in my small round corningware dish. Topped with a bit of cheese too.  NO LEFT OVERS :)

Pretty good, My daughter doesn't like Shepherd's Pie so the second time I made this I cooked the beef mixture as directed but added 2 garlic cloves, then added 2 tbspns of floor with a cup of milk, cooked it over a low heat and cooked the potatoes on the side (not boxed) then it was a huge hit! My picky teenage daughter even went back for seconds and that NEVER happens! Thanks for the idea!

I myself am very picky when it comes to what I will and won't eat. I enjoyed this except for the beef w/ onion soup mix. I just used beef buillon cubes instead. Still very delicious!

Great dish especially if you're hungry. 14 yr old son gave it a 4*. Sauteed onion with the beef. Couldn't find beef-onion soup mix so I combined  onion soup mix with beef boullion powder. Added canned (x2) mushrooms to the mix in the skillet. Used powdered mash on top. Cheap, filling, flavorful meal.
Note: left-overs had much more flavor, taste!

I rated this a 4 only because I changed/added some things for a better flavor. Very tasty - a nice twist on the old version.
I used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 water and I cooked the macaroni with the hamb and broth for 10 minutes. At 5 minutes the macaroni was still hard. I added corn to the hamb mixture and I sprinkled some Colby/Jack cheese on top of the mashers. Without the beef broth and cheese it would have been a little bland for my family.

We enjoyed it but I didn't have any onion soup mix so i used spices, onions and garlic to season it, but was a little bland still.  I had to use twice as much potatoes as it called for and twice the noodles as well.  Will make again but maybe use cream of "something" next time.

I altered the recipe. I added string beans to the meat. Also instead of plain noodles I used mac and cheese and layered it. On top of the mashed potatoes I added shredded cheddar, and sprinkled grated parm. cheese. But what I think adds a nice touch is, when it's done baking, put it in the broiler. Just long enough for the cheese to get a bit crisp, and bubbly brown. It looks nicer and taste better!

Very easy.  variations - used more noodles (1.5 total cups), added layer of corn layer of beans, fresh cut up tomatoes and zucchini (cooked a little with the meat),instant potatoes for 8 servings, and cheddar cheese on top.  Fantastic!

I don't know what all the fuss is about except that this is easy.  Not much flavor and was disappointed.  Next time, I will have to doctor it up severely...maybe some tomato sauce, more seasoning, more noddles, definitely needs veggies.  Overall, very bland.  This would be something I'd use again if very desperate and have the ingredients on hand.

I really liked this one.  Instead of the onion soup mix I used cream of mushroom soup.  Very good and a family pleaser!

This is a very good recipe!  I added a little more potato than what is called for here.  My boyfriend loved it and wanted the leftovers for lunch the next day.

This recipe is a variation on an old favorite of mine.  It's VERY simple to make, and is something the whole family can enjoy.  This variation is more colorful and less bland than other kinds of shepherd's pie.  I love it!

we added mixed veggies, and all we could find for dry beef noodle mix was pasta roni stroganoff, we used 1/2 the noodles and  seasoning and put the other 1/2 in the cupboard for the next time, because my family was suprisingly pleased with this simple meal.

Wow! Such an easy and inexpensive recipe. I was absolutely amazed at how easy this was, and how well the flavors blended together. This is definitely a great weeknight dinner since it doesn't take long at all to make.

I thought this was pretty good for a quick, inexpensive week night meal. I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 + leftovers and had a really full 9x13 pan. I used regular onion soup and 2 bouillon cubes. Wanted to make homemade mashed potatoes but in a time crunch used boxed. Didn't measure the amount of potatoes I put on top, just piled them on. I would say if your meat mix is a little salty just cut back on the salt in the potatoes. It balances out well that way. One last thing I put a few pats of butter on top the potatoes.

This was the best thing I've ever tasted!!  I did put a layer of shredded carrots and a can of string beans on the meat mixture and used garlic mashed boxed potatoes on top with cheese.  It was sooooooo yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

A great way to use up leftover mashed potatoes.  I didn't have beef with onion soup mix, so I used a packet of onion soup mix and a beef boullion cube.  I also added a can of corn.  This was a tasty dish.

Love the base of this recipe. I only had the onion soup mix so I added 4 bullion cubes. I also thought it needed some vegis so I added peas, carrots, green beans, and corn. I also added onion and garlic to the meat while it was cooking. I wanted a saucier dish so I added 1 sm. can of tomato paste and a 1/2 cup of ketchup, and a tbls. of prepared mustard. I had to add an extra cup of water to the meat and mac mixture to allow everything to meld together. To the instant potatoes I added a pkg of Mc Cormicks 4 cheese potato seasoning. I topped it with a half cup of cornflake crumbs mixed with garlic salt, parsley, pepper and a tbls. of oil. I took a pic before everyone finished devouring it. YUM! Thanks Cathy for inspiring me to even make dinner last night.

Used about 2x the potatoes (we LOVE them) and a bit more meat (I had 1.3 lbs).  It was wonderful.  Good ol comfort food.  Husband & I had for dinner & lunch the next day.  We both loved it.  Also, had misc stuff I wanted to use up - so put shaved parm cheese in potatoes, cheddar cheese & fried onions on top.  With or without these additions it would have been great.  Easy!!

My entire family of picky eaters loved it. I was interesting, it was bland AND spicy. I'm use to it the tastes being incorporated into everything, like a marinade the noodles were the most bland, but regardless, it is something I would and will make again with experiments in tweaking.

This was so delicious and easy! Grilled onions and cheese on top makes it even more delicious! I used a 9X9 pan so there was volume to the dish & made it with mashed potatos not out of the box.

I also added corn, green beans and carrots to this mixture, and as I couldn't find beef onion soup, I used beef gravy along with other seasonings to flavor and thicken this. As for the Shepherd's Pie name comment, whenever made with beef, I’ve always heard it referred to as Cowboy Pie. I think that if you were in England, Shepherd would be lamb only, but in US beef is commonly used.

This was great!  I was looking for something new to do with ground beef and it worked out well, I made a couple of changes (based on what I had on hand).  I added some chopped onion to the ground beef when I browned it and used garlic & herb soup mix instead of onion soup mix.

This was a very easy and yummy recipe that I was able to make using ingredients I usually keep on hand. I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef, used 3 cups of instant mashed potatoes instead of 2, and sprinkled shredded Cheddar cheese over the top before baking. Delicious!

This was good-- I added a can of corn to the mashed potatoes, and some sprinkled cheese on top.  I still felt the beef needed more flavor, however... I will play around with this recipe and see what I come up with.  But my boyfriend liked it, and he doesn't like much!

Recipe was really good. I made it as a vegetarian low sodium dish. Basically, ended up improvising all the  ingredients. It was really yummy as a vegetarian dish, so I can only imagine it would even be better just exactly  as your recipe. I will make the vegetarian version again, but I will be doubling up on the mash potatoes and the peas i put in it made it even more flavorable..

I'm only giving this a 4 star because i didn't follow it to the tee, but love the result.
Instead of the soup mix I used tomato paste, fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, salt, pepper, cinnamon, olive oil and onion.
A keeper!

This was really easy and fast too. I made 2 small changes. I doubled the noodles, and I made some extra potatoes. I was really really suprised that it really didn't need any extra seasoning. The soup packet was perfect. Thanks for a great weeknight recipe!

Very easy and tasted much better than I thought it would.  I used a bag of instant potatoes that were cheese flavored and topped with shredded cheddar!!!! YUM!

I made a few changes to the recipe. I cooked corn and peas (frozen), ground beef (frozen), and noodles (dried). I didn't measure any of these things, just eyeballed it ... which I regretted because I ended up with a lot of noodles but it worked out since I ended up eating a lot of them as everything else cooked since this really isn't a fast recipe. Peeling potatoes takes forever. Cooking everything took forever. Especially when they start out frozen. I was starving so those noodles, which cooked the fastest, were sacrificed. No one but the dog noticed and I bought her silence with a few noodles.    I then combined them all and added dried onion flakes since I didn't have onions, beef bullion and some water (again I didn't measure anything). I added the mashed potatoes and cheese ontop. It came out amazing. I'm now printing my Professional Chef business cards as we speak.

I have to agree with many of the others that the amount of potatoes the recipe calls for is not enough.  I always make extra.  I've also started adding some mustard and Worcestershire sauce to give it some extra flavor.  This recipe is also a great way to disguise veggies for the kids.  My whole family loves it!!

Adding the macaroni is a great idea and adds to this receipe. I do not usually deviate from the recipe. However, I made this once before and it was missing something, so I added a can of mushroom soup, a little more water to the mix and added a layer of cheese before topping with potatos. The husband loved it.

Very tasty! I seasoned the hamburger a bit w/ garlic powder & the paprika while it cooked. I also added a can of corn & a can of carrots to the mixture before putting in the baking dish. I topped w/ some shredded cheese, then the potatoes & cooked for 18 minutes - it is delish!

I followed Alissa's recommendations and my family loved this.  I was worried the noodles would not cook in the oven so I did cook them a little longer on the stove top and they were a bit over cooked so I would recommend cooking them on the stove top for 4-5 minutes as directed by the recipe.

I enjoyed this recipe, as did my 13 yr old son.  I did tweak it a little, and added corn and cheese like several others.  But I mostly wrote to say that both the previous comments are incorrect.  In England, Shepherd's pie is traditionally made with lamb... hence "Shepherd".  When the same recipe is made with beef, it is traditioanlly called Cottage Pie.  

Whatever you call it, it tasted great!

This is a hard recipe to rate as my 11 year old who made it loved it and my husband and I thought it to be "ok". She used instant mashed potatoes and regular Lipton onion soup mix. I'm glad the recipe doesn't call for any salt because the soup mix makes it very salty. She cooked the macaroni for about 8 minutes over a low flame before moving it to the oven for 20 minutes. She sprinkled extra sharp cheddar over the potatoes and that was a nice touch. There weren't enough potatoes to cover the entire casserole. If she makes it again I'll recommend making it in a cast iron skillet and just baking right in that. There is no good reason to move it all to another dish. If you did want to put it in a casserole I would recommend something smaller than a 9x13. This is a great early cooker recipe.

This was a good recipe, although I do think the mix could have simmered a little longer for the macaroni to cook thoroughly. Overall, a good, quick recipe, even with screaming babies in the room!

Although this recipe isn't awful, the noodles were crunchy. I wonder if I didn't let them cook long enough. It was much better as left overs.

My husband LOVES this.  It is so easy to make.  I have always been against instant mashed potatoes, but I used them and honestly couldn't tell a difference.  I sprinkle cheese on the top during the last ten minutes and it gives it a nice kick.

For being such an easy recipe with only a few ingredients, it can't be beat.  I have made this recipe three times.  My husband likes it a lot, so does my son.  They are both picky eaters...I recommend you try it, you may be surprised.

Very good.  Even my 4 year old daughter who doesn't like onions ate it.  I will make this again!

EXCELLENT!!!  I didn't have the beef onion soup mix so I used (MAINEPOTATO's) suggestions and was a little aprehensive, but it was delicious.  My picky 8 year old and easy to please 18 month old both gobbled it up!  There is barely enough left for my husband when he gets home later.

Very easy.  I added 6 cups of potatos instead of 2 and also some green beans.  My family loved it!!!  These are the kind of recipes I am looking for.

It was okay - kind of bland.
