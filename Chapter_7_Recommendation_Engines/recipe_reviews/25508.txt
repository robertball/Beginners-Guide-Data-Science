Very easy and they are a big party hit!  To make them extra fancy, I add a small piece of pimento on top of the cucumber and sprinkle with dill weed.  The red (pimento) and green (cuke) are a great combination for your holiday table.

i served these at a party and they were a big hit, however-when i tested the recipe prior to the party i discovered that the amount of the italian seasoning dressing that was called for was way too much-so i scaled it back a bit. otherwise they were great.

Very tasty.  I made these for a party and everyone loved them.  I put a little dill on the top also to make them look a little fancier.  Since the party, I've made them a couple times just for my family because they liked them so much.

I served these sandwiches at a baby shower, and two plates of them disappeared quickly! Try making your own rye bread for the recipe. I used the German Rye Bread recipe on this site. This is a keeper--a light snack perfect for get-togethers.

This recipe was greatly improved by baking a loaf of refrigerated italian-style bread to serve with the spread. I topped with very fresh roma tomatoes also. It went over very well!

Perfect fresh from the garden summer snack. My husband and I ate almost the whole lot of them! Made some more and took to family gathering and everyone went nuts over them. Thanks for sharing.

This is a nice, light snack or appetizer, especially for summer. I used Philadelphia light yogurt cream cheese, and it had a nicer and lighter taste... and in addition to that I also sprinkled the cucumber slices in a separate bowl with lemon and a pinch of salt first... and finished with a bit of dill sprinkled on top! For my bread, I used blackbread (I guess it's similar to pumpernickel - but it has sunflower seeds in it... totally delish!)

Using the whole pack of seasoning made this spread a little too salty.  I'd use half and taste it to see if you think it needs more.

This is a great, fast, and easy recipe.  I made this for a Christmas Tea and received many compliments.  For evenly sliced cucumbers, my husband helped by slicing the cucumbers with the slot on the cheese grater.  "Grate" idea!

excellent!!!  my husband and i don't care for rye bread so i used white bread.  i cut circles out of the bread by using an upside down glass.  it turned out perfect b/c the cucumber and circle bread were a perfect fit!  i also sprinkled a little dill on each sandwich.

Good! Cucumber sandwiches are always a hit. This recipe is yummy, but I much prefer using regular cream cheese and just sprinking some dill on top. I guess I'm just boring :) Thanks!

Classic summer party fare!  I've made this many times as directed, but today did not have italian dressing mix.  I substituted Good Seasons Garlic and Herb and I think I like it even better!

Took to 7/3/11 BSO concert @Oregon Ridge.  Guys liked these girlie sandwiches.  Particularly Greg F. who wants horseradish added to the cream cheese.  Didn't use as much salad dressing mix as called for. Topped with thin sliced ham. Went with Ferguson's, Eric, Santos, Norriss and their son Evan and his friend.

This was okay, but the only Italian dressing I could find was Good Seasons. I used only half the envelope and that was enough flavor, but it had a heavy oniony bite to it. Won't make again.

I took the advice of previous reviewers and used about half the seasoning packet and then used Breton crackers instead of bread. Very easy - very tasty. It also made much more than I expected.

I made this exactly as the recipe said. It WAY too salty.  I added another 4 oz of cream cheese just to  make it edible. Very disappointing teaparty fair.

I love these cucumber sandwiches!!  I like to have a nice layer of cream cheese on the sandwich but not too much so that it overpowers the cucumber (about 1/8 of an inch thick).  I also like to use the ranch seasoning mix instead of the Italian seasoning mix...it is goooood.  I also like to make the cucumber slices a bit thicker so you have a good bite and crunch when you sink your teeth into them,about a quarter of an inch thick or a bit less and sprinkle with dill weed.  Delicious.  Everybody always loves them.  They are a good light appetizer next to the heavy ones that are usually offered.

This was a good recipe, but I still felt like it didn't have quite enough flavor. I felt that the rye sort of overpowered the cream cheese and dressing. I simply added about 1 1/2 times the recommended amount and I felt that this helped. So cute though! I would make this again.

I did not care for the ranch flavor of the cream cheese.  I ended up throwing away most of the cream cheese and not finishing these.

Excellent flavor. I loved the cream cheese with this. It was a lot better than the usual mayo. Very refreshing, light and cool. This would be perfect for those hot dog days of summer when you don't want anything too hot, heavy, or filling. Thanks!

Cucumber Sandwichs???  I thought this sounded a little gross but my girlfriend insisted on them for the baby shower I had for her.  They flew off the plates.  They are so yummy and so easy to make.  I cut them into little triangles and they were so cute.  Definately will make again.

I didn't care for these too much. The dry Italian dressing was too strong and over powering! I changed it and used cucumber, cream cheese, crab meat and cocktail sauce...much better!!!

Quick and easy and a definite crowd pleaser.  Make this one if you want a lot of compliments.  I sprinkled dill on top of the sandwiches.

I had fresh cucumbers from my garden so I made these sandwiches for a treat day at my work.  I used my Pampered Chef bread tubes and refrigerated french loaf dough to make the bread.  They turned out great and my co-workers ate them up quickly.

I liked the cream cheese mix and will probably use it again on other sandwiches or bagels in the morning. However, I didn't think the sandwiches were anything special.

These are excellent.  I sprinkled on Italian seasoning instead of mixing in the dressing.  I also added fresh dill on the cucumbers.  Very light and refreshing.  Perfect summer snack!

This recipe is a hit at my woman's club annual tea. For Christmas I top the cucumber with a small piece of dill and hold it all together with a red cocktail tooth pick. Looks like a Christmas tree. I would highly recommend this recipe.

I made these for a family event and a company picnic and they were a hit both times!  I sprinkled "It's A Dilly" a McCormick spice that is a blend of lemon and dill on top.  It really complimented the flavor!  So simple and really good!

I love eating these.  I am not a cucumber fan and still love these.  The cucumber makes it so refreshing.  I've seen many others bring these to parties and always wanted to know how to make them.  Now I know and have made them twice so far.  I will definitely be making these in the future!

WOW!  This receipe was a home run.  I needed a "healthy" snack for my daughter's tennis team.  Mixed the cream cheese the day before and put in a pastry bag.  Served on cocktail rye (cut the crust off). Took very little time to make but was a beautiful presentation.  Topped off with fresh dill - Thanks for a great receipe!

Definately let the mix set for an hour or two before assembling.  These were good.  I used regular cream cheese and mixed a little mayo in for easier spreadability.  I also made them into sandwiches with a very thin coat of spread on each side of the bread and used 4 cucumber slices each on crustless bread.

I used party size dark pumpernickel bread instead of rye.  Would definitely use regular white or wheat bread next time.  The pumpernickel (and I think rye would also be) was too dry.  Otherwise good recipe!!

I though these were pretty bland in flavor. Although other reviewers said to cut down the italian seasoning, I ended up using the whole packet to boost the flavor. The bread did not save well, curling up by the end of my party, and I found I only really enjoyed the flavor when the sandwiches were chilled. Just ok for me, but this is the first time I've tried cucumber sandwiches, so maybe I just don't like them.

I made these for a quick summertime lunch. I toasted the pumpernickle bread and used Trader Joe's 21 Salute Seasoning mix instead of the dry dressing mix. It's salt free, MSG free and has the same zesty taste as the dressing mix. Very nice sandwich, I will be making this often for lunch.

Excellent basic idea which can be modified to taste.  I used 1/2 a package of regular ranch, 1/2 of spicy ranch & the dill.  Then put a bit of dill atop each cucumber.  Everyone, even non-veggie lovers enjoyed this new years eve.  Nice combo and very easy with few ingredients.

Good and easy to make. Got many compliments when I served these at a baby shower. But I did pass the recipe along to my MIL who made it for a shower and she did not care for it at all. Soo I guess to each its own. :)
I think the cream cheese spread would be wonderful just served along side bagels.

I have been making this recipe for several years.  I did not get the recipe from this site, but it is the same recipe.  If I'm taking these to a party, I usually add dill on about 1/2 of the sandwiches.  It is a good, easy recipe and I've never had left overs.

Quick and easy 'make-ahead' recipe. I mix the cream cheese and dressing a day before the party, then construct the sandwiches early on the day of the party. I've made these for years and always sprinkle crushed dill on the top. They stack up beautifully on a platter and are among the first appetizers gone!

These are delicious.  I used ranch dressing instead of Italian and they were so good.  I haven't tried these with Italian, but I hear it's very good too.

These were just okay. I cut back on the amount of seasoning I put in the cream cheese because the flavor was so overwhelming. I would make these again, but it's not something I'd gloat about making.

Not a repeat.  It was just okay.  I used only 1/2 ro 3/4 of the seasoning beacuse it was too much as stated.  Not a keeper, will never make again.

These were great.  I already made these to the funeral over at my church (everybody loved it) and also I made these for the baby shower, too.  It is nice to have something like this besides a lot of sweets.  Thanks for the good and easy recipe.

I tried this at an office luncheon.  I was skeptical at first but after I tried one I could not stop eating them!  They are delicious.  Even the men love these little snacks.  As another reviewer said, a little dill on top adds a good flavor.  Great appetizer.

I made this for a women's tea social and it was delicious.  I doubled the recipe and it's a good thing I did because of all the food there, this tray was empty first!  I decorated the top of each cucumber with a small sprig of fresh dill which made the plate look very appealing.  Everyone loved it and I will make this again soon!

I have made this recipe dozens of times.   My variation includes using good seasons mild Italian dressing mix.   Instead of rye bread, I use Pillsberry French loaf dough.   I put the French loaf in one of the bread tubes sold by pampered chef.   Standing the bread tubes upright in the oven, I bake at 375° for 50 minutes.   When the breads are cool, then I sliced narrow piece of the french bread, and continue on with the recipe.

 EVERYONE (Men, women and kids)  love these little sandwiches!!

These were a hit and went very quickly at a party I made these for. Very easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly, although I probably got 24 servings out of the recipe versus 15. I also sprinkled each with some parsley.

I make this all the time (although I didn't get the recipe from here). It is AMAZING! I use baguettes instead of rye. They are always the first thing gone! If you have any of the cream cheese mixture left, it is wonderful for sandwiches!! What a great recipe!

This recipe was pretty good.  I took all other reviews into consideration with regards to bland taste at for some and mixed in some flavoured cream cheese for added kick (roasted red pepper).  Went over really well at a baby shower with lots of vegetarians in attedance.  Will use again.

I loved the whipped cream cheese with the Italian dressing flavor.  It was fantastic.  However, once I added it to the bread it became unappetizing.  So I tried it with just some carrots, cucumbers and celery and it works great.  It makes a yummy dip.
