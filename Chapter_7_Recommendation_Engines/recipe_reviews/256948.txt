Not great unfortunately. I thought it was a long shot to turn out well, but I had some extra pizza dough about to expire and thought I'd give it a shot.  It was fun to make,
 but it wasn't good. Not offensive or terrible, but I wouldn't make it again.

If you do decide to try this I'd recommend being light handed w the filling, and don't heat the peanut butter or jelly too much. I used a little too much, plus heated it too much, and it was a little runny and as a result combined a bit too much. Still tasted like a pbj but didn't have separate layers like a sandwich would.
