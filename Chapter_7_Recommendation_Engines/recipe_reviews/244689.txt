This has very good flavor, although I didn’t think there was enough sauce for my sauce-loving husband, so I added a can of chicken broth. It was a little soupy, so I thickened with flour, but it made it perfect over pasta (I didn’t have egg noodles). Of course the key is getting a good browning on your chicken which gives the sauce it’s flavor. I also added a bit of sugar, as I used a dry Traminette which made the sauce somewhat acidic (the author didn’t specify, but most Riesling’s in the US are sweet). This was delicious and a definite make again!

De-boned a whole chicken and used that for the meat which worked really well. Everyone who tried it thought it was fantastic.  I served it with home made spätzli noodles to make it more authentic to the Alsace region.  Will make it again!
