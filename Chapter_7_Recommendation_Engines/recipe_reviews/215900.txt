I tried this recipe as written and gave it the 4 stars. The apples added a nice crunch to the mix. After trying things this way, my brain wanted more. I made this again and doubled the amount of tuna used wanting to add more crunch and depth. I added 1/4 green bell pepper, 1/4 red onion and 2 celery stalks- all diced, use the WHOLE apple and 1 more egg. Now I was happy! Thank you RAINYDAZE for this jump start. I would have never thought of using an apple. :)

Excellent!  I added some chopped spinach and another egg and omitted the salad dressing.  Very tasty.

I used a Gala apple and mayonnaise as I didn't have the dressing on hand. This was fantastic. I'll definitely be making this again. The apples added a nice crunch that stuck around even after refrigerating.

I am not a fish fan at all - but the addition of the apples really breaks up the fish taste. I used crushed cashews instead of pecans and it still tasted great!

My boyfriend thought this was just ok and I liked the idea of it but im not a big tuna salad fan. The apple and pecans were great and I will use these in another type of salad. I want to note that for this recipe I would dice the apple extremely small. The egg was also a good idea. Overall, it was just ok with us. I have found other recipes I prefer, like the Summertime Tuna Pasta salad which I put in a wrap for lunch on the go.

WOW! I love tuna salad and this is probably the best I've ever tried. I didn't have miracle whip on hand so I used light mayo - about half that the ingredients ask for. Still great! My sister and I have been eating this every other day for 2 weeks now, YUM!

I just had it for lunch. I made it about 30 minutes before eating and chilled it only for 30 min. I added one fourth of an onion but didn't add salt or pepper. I used all of the apple and one egg and didn't measure the mayo, just two spoonfuls. I toasted bread and let the bread cool slightly before eating. Yum :)

My grandmother always used apples in her tuna salad. This one is very similar to her recipe. I used half of the recommended apples and added some grapes and celery to spice up the color. Also added a touch of dijon mustard. This is very, very tasty.

Easy way to put a new twist in your old tuna salad recipe... I made it just as written. I did not have salad dressing so I used mayo with a bit of paprika sprinkled in it. I also added a couple of diced grapes. Will defiantly make this again!

Amazing!!!  Like others, I used it as a jumping off point--used two cans albacore, a mix of toasted walnuts and sunflower seeds (it's what I had), and guessed on the mayo.  SO GOOD!!!!!  And yep, the apples stay crunchy the next day! Thank you!

it's ok, the apples give it a different twist to tuna salads.  I will add some more ingredientes next time to make it flavorful, thanks for the idea of adding apples though!

I've been making almost this exact tuna salad for decades, and it is wonderful.  The difference from mine is that I add chopped onion and celery seed or chopped fresh celery and chopped dill pickles.  The contrast between the pickle and apples is nice.  I haven't tried it with the pecans, but I will, since I use pecans in my chicken salad.  And, I do use fresh ground pepper.

Apple is a classic ingredient to tuna, though it's not "widespread knowledge."  The taste is fantastic.  I just added a table spoon of red onion... so good.  Thanks.

I dice up the apple and egg really small, I guess you'd call it "minced." Because adding the egg might be a little drying, I think the apple moistens it up. Great way to stretch expensive canned tuna.

Fabulous recipe! I have been trying to work more tuna into my diet, but needed a tastier way to eat it. As another reviewer mentioned, the apple takes the "kick" out of the tuna so it is less fishy and more like chicken. Exactly what I was looking for! Will definitely be making often. Thanks for the idea!

I really like this tuna sandwich. The apple gives it a little sweet and the toasted pecans give it a little gourmet. I usually always have these ingredients.

This is really good. I put it on my gluten free pumpernickel bread with my 9 day pickles on the side and enjoyed every bite. I swapped the pecans (which I didn't have), for a green onion that needed to be eaten. I think I will put green onion in it again. I used almost the whole apple since it was small. I don't enjoy celery in tuna salad, so this was the perfect recipe for me.

I would say to leave out the salt.. In my opinion, the salt addition doesn't go too well with the apple. The salad itself could use maybe a bit more fresh apple crisp..  I doubled the recipe, therefore using a whole apple instead of half.. but I'm thinking I would've liked a bit more apple to it.. maybe also adding some sweet vinaigrette on top of the salad would help with hiding the strong tuna flavor.. I usually love tuna.. maybe it was the brand.. who knows.
