I have been looking for a recipe like this.  When I was in high school they had cherry chip cookies and this is it!  I used 1/2 tsp almond extract & 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  I also upped the temp on the oven to 350 and still baked them for 12-13 minutes as I had seen in some other recipes for a simular cookie, they sill came out light and crumbly.  thanks for bringing back a fond memeory!

This cookie will only be as good as the quality of the chips you use.  I found a good mini cherry chip from King Arthur Flour Catalog. My kids loved these.

This is a pretty simple cookie recipe, but it works! I used butter instead of margarine and used 2 tablespoons less than the recommended 1 cup and it still came out fine. I couldn't find cherry chips so I substituted chopped maraschino cherries. The dough was a bit dry and wouldn't stick together so I added about 2 teaspoons of the maraschino cherry liquid with the chopped cherries. Because of the dryness of the dough, I found that I had to scoop some up in my hand and press them into balls before placing them on the cookie sheet. I also left the cookies in the oven for about 5 minutes longer. The oats give this cookie a nice crunchy texture. Thumbs up.

This is a very light cookie which does not spread as it bakes.  Oatmeal and cherry chips are a very nice complement to each other.  Very tasty!

Made these exactly how it says. I didn't realize I had no oats. :( Just added some chocolate chips, a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg. My dough was really crumbly so I splashed in some milk until it looked like cookie dough and it came out great. 15 min at 300degrees and yum! Thank you so much!

Such a great basic cookie recipe.  I was looking for an eggless chocolate chip cookie recipe and found this one.  I substituted semi-sweet chips for the cherry chips and they turned out wonderful.  Very crispy and light but with a great flavor.  I only had half a cup of powered sugar so I used a half cup of granulated and they still came out great.  I did increase the oven to 350 degrees but my oven runs colder, and baked for fifteen minutes.  Still, they were delicious.

I made these as part of this year's holiday treats for gift tins, and these were my favorite!  Very light and crisp.  I'm making another batch just for me!

I think these might be good with butterscotch or white chocolate chips as well.

This is a great eggless cookie!  My daughter is allergic to eggs and we are always looking for new recipes to try, this will make our Christmas cookie list every year.  I made a double batch and only had 1 1/2 cups of cherry chips so I added another cup of milk chocolate chips, fantastic!  I also tried to up the oven temp to 325 but found that leaving it at 300 and just increasing the time to 15 minutes was perfect.  I also used butter as that is what I had instead of margarine.

These were okay, but were a bit sweeter than I expected.  I also think they should bake longer than 12 minutes.

These cookies were very tasty. Light and crispy, and I enjoyed the cherry chips. Also, I like that they are eggless. The dough is very tasty, especially with the oatmeal, and I don't have to worry about eating raw eggs!

This recipe is perfect for any kind of chip. I've used it to make chocolate, cherry, white chocolate, mint, and a few other kinds of cookies. It is easy to make and it tastes good. I was in a hurry once, so I didn't cream the sugar and butter, and instead I just mixed it all together. It works just as well, and it saves time.

I was not sure about this recipe, but I tried it anyway.  I love these cookies.  They really like how light they are.  They are not as heavy as other chip cookies can be.  They were so easy, it took no time to make them.  Thank you for this recipe...it's my new favorite!

the cookies themselves were divine.  However, the oven needs to be set at 350 and they need to bake for 14 min.  My first batch I followed the directions to a 't'.  I even baked them for 18 min but they still fell apart.  My grandson is allergic to eggs so I was overjoyed to find this recipe.  Thanks for posting it Joylyn.
