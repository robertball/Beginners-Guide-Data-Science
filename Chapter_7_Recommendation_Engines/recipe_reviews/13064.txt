This is SO good! I followed the advice to add Velveeta (about 6 ounces). Since it did that, I used slightly less shredded sharp chedder (about 2 ounces less). I didn't have green onion on hand, so I used yellow onion, and light beer so it wouldn't overwhelm the soup. I salted and peppered the veggies while they sauteed and I forgot to steam the cauliflower separately, but it cooked perfectly during the 20 minute simmer. I didn't want to use 3/4 cup butter, so I used a few tbsps olive oil, and a couple tbsp light butter. I can't believe how good this soup is - the best soup I've had! I will absolutely make this again.

I made this exactly as written, only using mild Cheddar rather than sharp, and light beer - and was initially very unimpressed. While I loved the chunkiness of the vegetables, the broth itself was watery rather than creamy and even had flecks or grains of cheese in it - not pretty.  I took a guess on what would correct this and added a good chunk of Velveeta, noted for it's smoothness and melting quality.  I can't tell you what an incredible difference this made! The soup was totally transformed and became creamy, rich and smooth! I was so pleased! Even though to start I really wanted to rate this as three stars, the soup ended up being so darn good I didn't want to take the risk of turning anyone off to it. With just this small change of adding Velveeta, this became a five star soup!

I really loved this soup!  This has to be one of the best soups I've made/eaten - and I don't like beer!  I didn't have any califlower but used potatoes, adding them with all the other veggies.  I added a bit of sour cream in the end and I had less than a bottle of beer to put in it but you could still taste it.  We topped it with additional parmesan cheese.

This was very tasty - my new favorite way to eat cauliflower!  The recipe called for 3/4 cup of butter. I only used 1/4 cup of butter, and it was fine.  I also used low-sodium vegetable broth instead of chicken, and about 1/2 cup more carrots and celery.

This soup is so easy and turned out great.  I omitted the mushrooms, celery, cauliflower and onions because I didn't have any.  Instead I used frozen mixed veggies, corn, peas carrots, and added broccoli.  My 2 and 4 year old loved it!!

Awesome soup, served with chunks of crusty french bread! I used Henry Weinhard's Organic Amber Premium Ale for the beer. The taste was a little too "sophisticated" for my 15 year old though.

This is the absolute BEST beer cheese soup I have ever had in my life...I made a few little changes based on other suggestions and it was superb!!!    First of all...the only vegis I used were the green onions and celery...Next time, I will add chopped potatoes however...I used a honey-dijon mustard as I didn't have any mustard powder..and it worked just fine..I also used only 4 cups of chicken broth and added one cup of cream of chicken soup (as this is usually the base of most beer-cheese soups)...I then used only 4 ounces of Cheddar and substituted the other 4 with Velveeta....I also forgot to use the Parmesan cheese but it didn't matter...the soup was absolutely FANTASTIC!!  Perfectly smooth texture and not gritty or grainy at all...I highly recommend this recipe and it is now my beer cheese soup staple...will make it again and again!!   Thank You!

Aside from excluding the mushrooms, I kept this recipe the same.  I also made a beer bread that I found the recipe for on here.  Used a honey brown lager for both.. and both were delicious!!

Be careful which beer you choose.  I used a dark beer with a slightly bitter after taste and was disappointed. I added Velveeta, a brick of cream cheese and a 1/2 cup of parmesean cheese to make it better.  It made a decent cheese sauce, but next time I'll try Beer Cheese soup III.

Would have been perfect without celery.  It just doesn't go well with the taste.

I made many changes, just to suit my own taste - I left out the celery and cauliflower, used half cheddar cheese, and half velveta, and used dijon mustard instead of mustard powder, and I was really pleased with how this came out!  Thanks!

This soup was wonderful!!  I kept everything just as listed, except for omitting the mushrooms and adding some steamed broccoli and I also added a small amount of Velveeta to help the rest of the cheese melt.  Definitely a keeper!!

This recipe is for a genuine, and good, beer cheese soup. It was definitely worth the effort. The only warning I would give, is that you can taste the beer, so pick what beer you want to use wisely, and don't expect people who hate the taste of beer to like the soup. They don't have to really love beer, but at least not hate it.

Made this recipe for a 4th of July party. Everyone enjoyed it. I have had this soup at many gatherings. Thank you for sharing the recipe. I used Coors Light beer in my soup. Going to make again, but this time add in some mild Italian sausage. Making some biscuit bread to go with it too.

I made this recipe last week, and my husband, friend, and baby son (age 10 mos) loved it.  I did a couple of things differently.  As much as I hated to use processed cheese, I did add about 4 oz of Velveeta.  I didn't use celery because I didn't have any.  I used extra carrots and mushrooms because I wanted to use them up.  I used water instead of chicken broth, again because I didn't have any.  I used good quality extra sharp cheese, I think it was slightly more than 8 oz.  And I used a stout beer (Deschutes Obsidian) which was a great choice.  All in all the soup came together wonderfully - with all the chunky veggies it was really more like a veggie soup in beer cheese broth but what a great way to eat your veggies!  Yum!

Unfortunately,
we
didn't care for this soup so much. I wanted to taste a beer soup,
but it turned out just not our taste. The texture was pretty dense, but
the taste a little boring. I didn't use cauliflor and don't think it
would make a much difference. I don't think this is a recipe I will be
using again.

I made this recipe Wisconsin style and it's my favorite winter soup. I use Spotted Cow beer, Wisconsin cheddar, and add sliced grilled brats. It's so awesome how the flavors of beer, broth, and cheese meld together. I don't care for the flavor added by the green onions, but the rest of the vegetables are good. The only deficit is that the cheddar melts and clumps at the bottom. I need to work on modifying the texture without resorting to Velveeta.

I made it without the beer because I couldn't find our bottle opener. It was really good as just cheese soup so I bet it's great with the beer! I'll try it again now that I've found that bottle opener.

4 stars as is but 5 stars with my  changes.  I added minced garlic to the veggies, plus salt & pepper.  I threw the cauliflower in with the broth, beer & cheese rather than steaming it first.  Most importantly, I used WHITE SHARP CHEDDAR because it melts smoothly. Don’t ruin this with processed cheese. At the end I threw in 6 cooked sliced brats.  Yum!

This is absolutely delicious!  I puréed it into a smooth soup.  So used a little less liquid (maybe just under 4c chicken broth, and the beer may have been missing a few swigs ;)).   I almost doubled the mushrooms (just because I love them).  I used 3 stalks of celery and 2 (very) small yellow onions (rather than green onions as that is what I had).  I sautéed in skillet with butter, then added the mustard/flour,  sautéed a few min, then added the broth, cooked another few minutes.  Then I transferred to a pressure cooker (instant pot) and poured over the raw cauliflower.  Set to 19 min.  When done puréed with stick blender then added cheese.   Used 8 oz of the sharp cheddar, but was generous with the Parmesan, probably doubled it (I used preshredded).  This will definitely go in the soup rotation!

Pretty much followed the recipe to the letter.  It wasn't bad, but I probably won't be making it again. It's a lot of effort for something that's pretty average.

Yummy!  I used 2 900ml of veggie broth, 3 bottles of homemade beer and 3/4 velveta cheese with the 1/2 cup shredded cheddar.  I omitted the mushrooms, and didn't steam the califlower.   I also made sure to boil the beer down since my son and nephew will also be having some.  Super YUMMY!!

I'm a tiny house gal, so I use a small pot. I had to morph the ingredients to make it fit. I also put in a lot less butter, cheese to make it healthier. Very delicious. Next time a tad less beer. I'm not a beer lover anyway. I liked this recipe better than some of the other beer cheese soup recipes.

First time making this and my husband and I loved it!!! I didn't add the green onion or carrots, instead I replaced with diced red potatoes, chopped white onion and kielbasa that we needed to use up. I also used 4 cups of chicken broth and 1 cup of milk. Used 8 oz. of Sharp Cheddar Cheese and 8 oz. of Monterey Jack and no Parmesan. My husband likes things to have a bit of a kick so I added about 1 1/2 tsp. of Cayenne pepper and ground black paper for taste. As for the beer I chose Sam Adam's Boston Lager which made it come together wonderfully! Served in toasted sourdough bread bowls and we had the perfect warm meal on a cold night :)

This was pretty good! I thought the flavor came out fairly bland prior to adding s&p, but I used half reduced sodium chicken broth which probably affected the flavor somewhat. I used extra sharp cheddar and Yeungling Black & Tan for the beer. The texture is nice and I particularly like the cauliflower in this! We served with a loaf of beer bread from Tastefully Simple and it went great together. :)

Very good. I am no beer drinker - can't stand the stuff personally, but had great beer cheese soup at a local restaurant and was determined to make this at home. I was hesitant about how this would turn out because the only beer we had on hand was Bud Light Lime and I heard that the best beer soup is made with dark beer. But never-the-less I proceeded and followed the recipe exactly, except I omitted the mushrooms and cauliflower. I also added processed cheese cube (Velveeta) to the cheese mix. This was delicious and my family loved it. It was rich, creamy, and nice with just a hint of the beer taste. I will definitely make this again!
