I made this yesterday and I must say it was delicious.  I used green onions instead of regular onions and it was good as well. however I used store bought stuffing. don't know if making my own stuffing will make a difference.  maybe next time.

My husband liked this dressing a lot and ate half of it himself.  I did not put into the muffin pan, instead placed it in a baking dish.  It turned out really well.  Will make again in the future.

This has been our family recipe for generations, it wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without it.  We call it “Daddy’s stuffing”.

It was a little dry. I added additional broth, which helped. Not sure if I'm going to make it again.

Taste was great! The muffins had 1 good bite each. The rest was dry. I added the bacon drippings after the eggs.  It was my first attempt at any stuffing.

My raw, mixed product (before baking) was very dry so I added an ingredient not in the original recipe: broth.  That helped considerably, but it's occurred to me  that some imprecision in the recipe also might have contributed to the problem.  The need for "two loaves of bread" needs more precise quantification.  I used two bags of dry (some might say "stale") Arnold breadcrumbs which simply may have  been too much volume or too arid an ingredient.  I'd welcome any amplification how to improve directions for this recipe.

Two loaves made way too much bread, all the rest was great, definently used the turkey drippings for moisture.
