I thought this turned out pretty good. I did cut back on the syrup and also added some all natural salt and pepper blend but that was the only change I made. My salmon was pretty thick so I grilled it 5 minutes longer to be safe. It also still had the skin on so on that last 5 minutes extra I set it directly on the grill to "burn" the skin making it easier to eat. The meat was super tender and slid right off of the skin. This is a good recipe and one I would make again.

Sorry but this was not my taste at all. The salmon turned out too wet and sweet for my liking. The syrup was overbearing. It might have worked better with brown sugar.

We loved it. We eat a lot of fish and am always looking for ways to cook it. This was easy and different for us.

Followed the recipe exactly except baked on plank in oven.  Didn't find the marinade to be anything special.  Probably won't make again.
