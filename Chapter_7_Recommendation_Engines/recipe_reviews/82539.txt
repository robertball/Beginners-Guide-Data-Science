This is an excellent sandwich however I did do it a bit differently. I used deli sliced lemon pepper chicken and instead of mixing everything together with the mayo, I just layered the mayo, chicken, cheese and onion on the bread and baked it. Very tasty! The whole family liked them!

Delicious!  Very quick and easy to make.  I didn't have mozarella cheese so I used swiss and cheddar instead.  If you are looking for a simple and tasty sandwich spread, you should give this one a try!

What a delicious lunch!  I used far less mayo (but opted for a full fat version) and used monterey jack cheese.  I loved the idea of mixing shredded cheese in instead of using sliced.  I grilled these on the stove rather than baking.  Even my 11-month-old boys loved it...I made them a half a sandwich before I added the mayo and they gobbled it down!  I served this with tomatoes on the side, and I really wished that I'd put it on the sandwich.  I think the sandwich could have used a little more zing:  a little mustard, maybe some kind of fresh herb (parsley, basil? I'm not sure, I'll have to experiment).  I also overstuffed my sandwiches (a half recipe made 2 and a half sandwiches for me) and it did get really goopy and leak out the edges.  Good, though!  Thanks!

My family thought these were GREAT!  And if you can't use all the mix it stores great in the fridge for a quick lunch.

I didn't use canned chicken, I just sauted up a chicken breast which, I'm sure, was much better then the canned stuff. Very tasty :)
