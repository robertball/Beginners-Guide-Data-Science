This turned out pretty good. It was more sour than hot so next time I'd add more heat. The cornstarch mixture made it really cloudy. It tasted good but didn't look that great. I liked the darker color the soup had prior to putting it in. Overall this was good but I plan on tweaking it a bit next time. Maybe use rice wine vinegar instead of the red wine and only use the white of the egg.
