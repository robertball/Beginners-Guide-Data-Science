WOW this recipe was amazing!  I sauteed a small onion with the garlic and used curry powder instead of the coriander and tumeric, because the first two ingredients of curry powder are coriander and tumeric!!!  I also halved the recipe and it was perfect for about 5 people. I added some fresh chopped tomatoes and some sliced olives.  Don't bother using one whole bunch of parsley and cilantro, I just used about 2 tbsp. of each and it was PLENTY!!!  If I would have used anymore, it would have been overpowering.  My hubby loved this recipe and he is so picky and hard to please, so when he says something is good, it must be really good!!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  Next time I make it I will try grilled chicken pieces instead of the ground turkey.

I make this recipe vegetarian by leaving out the turkey and using vegetable broth instead of chicken.  I also add a coarsely chopped onion.  I love it!!!  I eat it for dinner, then have leftovers for lunch a couple days.  I've also frozen it with success.

For more flavor, I doubled the amount of spices, and then drizzled cilantro-spiked yogurt sauce on top (2 cups plain whole-milk yogurt, 3/4 c finely chopped cilantro, 2 tbsp lemon juice)- a MUST.  I also added roasted cauliflower (tossed in oil, salt & pepper, 450 for 30 min, then 500 for 10 until caramelized) and melted onions (with oil, low heat 20 min).

Yum. This will go into regular rotation. I only used one can of chicken broth, and one can of each of the beans. Makes a lot of food! Served with pita bread, and a romaine, tomato, and feta salad. Stuffed it all in the pita and topped with plain yogurt. Try it!

This was an excellent recipe! The only thing I did differently was to add spinach with the beans. I served it on a piece of naan (Indian flatbread) and topped it with a dollop of yogurt and a squeeze of lemon, which brilliantly accentuated the flavors of this dish. My husband loved it, and he is not normally a fan of beans!!

Thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  Ate it with plain yoghurt on the side like my Iranian friend does.  
Ground Turkey is unavailable where I live, so had to make it with ground beef.  Next time I would brown the beef with some of the spices as browned by itself the beef is bland.  (That was the only reason I didn't give 5 stars.)  In Middle Eastern cooking spinach is often utilized as a herb with cilantro and parsley so for extra vitamins I'm going to add that next time.....and there will be a next time and soon!

1.  Definitely cut down on the chicken broth/stock; I used about 2.5 cups for 1 cup of rice. 
2.  Just one can of each of the beans.
3.  Like another reviewer, I added onion with the garlic.

This recipe isn't bland by any stretch, but I agree that it's a good idea to cook the turkey in spices as well as the rice.  I'll do that next time.  And I found a good handful of parsley and cilantro to be a good amount for this recipe.

This recipe was one of the best I've tried in a long time. Fragrant and delicious. One thing I will do next time is to cut the chicken stock down a bit, as the dish came out a bit watery (but then, my weather conditions in the mountains more than likely contributed to this!). Thanks for this awesome recipe, I served it with a tomato, avocado and feta salad to rave reviews from the homefront.

Wow...VERY good! I subbed spices with 1-1/2tsp Curry powder, omitted the turkey (vegetarian) & parsley (none on hand), added 1/4C chopped purple onion as rice sautes. The aroma this dish has while cooking is amazing!

This is a good, healthy recipe that is a cinch to make.  I would suggest using less tumeric -- it overpowers the dish -- adding extra cayenne (i like my food spicy!), and using much less broth (i use two cups of broth for one cup of rice).  I don't think it's necessary to use two cans of the black and garbanzo beans.  One can of each is plenty for one cup of rice.  Finally, I added the same spices from the rice into the meat because otherwise it would  be too plain.

Loved this!  Subbed ground lamb as suggested in the recipe description.  Lamb just seemed a better fit to me for this dish.  Omitted the coriander, tumeric, and cilantro but otherwise followed the recipe.  The rice was kind of soupy with all that chicken broth...I cooked it for about 15 minutes longer.  I think I'll cut back on the chicken stock in the future to the amount listed on the rice box.  If you can find it, try this with Greek yogurt (Trader Joe's is the only place I've been able to find it).  Otherwise, use some plain unsweetened yogurt...really accents the dish well.  Yum, yum!  Thanks for the delightful recipe!

Middle Eastern Rice with Black Beans Haiku: "No less than 5 stars! Really, this blew us away! Good with garnishes." Halved the recipe for 2 adults, 1 child, and skipped on the chick peas. Didn't have turmeric, so used a little curry. Definitely didn't skip the optional cilantro! Served ours topped w/ plain Greek yogurt, toasted walnuts (cheaper than pine nuts and more versatile, IMO), diced cucumber, Sriracha, and additional cilantro. This tasted like something I'd order at a Persian restaurant that I adore in Atlanta - not difficult to put together at all and certainly in the keeper file now!

This is great!  I've added zuchinni, frozen spinach, eggplant... the spices are really nice.  I've noticed that depending on type of spice, the hotness can vary greatly.  I serve it on a bed of lettuce with a dash of rice wine vinegar.  The fresh cilantro is a must!

This was great!  Needs salt, but of course that can be added at the table.  Makes 8 - 1 1/2 cup servings.  Low in calories, high in protein.  Definately will be making this again.

This was a true winner for our family. We come from a middle eastern background and this is just like we were eating food from back home. I added some extra fresh garlic, and some cumin and curry powder to the meat. My only thing that was just a little too much was the chicpeas. I put just a can and a half and that was just right for us. This is one that I will continue to make for out family.

Excellent dish...love it!   For those who decided to add the seasonings to the turkey instead of the rice, I believe that the toasting of the spices with the rice brings out the flavor more then adding it to the moist turkey.   It's a common Middle Eastern / Indian cooking technique.   Try it!

Some changes to make this UH-mayzeeing: DOUBLE THE SPICES, except for the Cayennne. This one you should add more of little by little so it doesn't get out of hand.  Also, add 1/2 can TOMATO PASTE when cooking the rice, as well as 1/2c RAISINS.  I'm vegetarian, so no meat for me. Doesn't need it.  I added DICED TOMATOat the end, and servd with homemade YOGURT. Wow. WOW!!!

Don't be afraid to use a lot of cilantro and parsley. It adds a lot. I used 99% fat free ground turkey - a little more than the recipe called for. Omitted pine nuts because they're expensive. I also highly recommend adding vegetables to make this a fully rounded meal. I added shredded carrots and spinach, and meant to add mushrooms but forgot I had them. Used brown basmati rice, cooked in the rice cooker. Overall, this was a good, very healthy weekday meal.

Tastes even better the next day.  I added a small can of chopped tomatoes. Served with a salad and Naan bread from this site.  I will make this again.

Great flavor, you will think that all the spice in the rice is going to be crazy. After you mix, it all makes sense. I would recommend that you add the cilantro and parsley, it gives it a very nice edge. The chicken broth has enough salt, so you won't need to add any. If you have the spice's, it is an inexpensive meal to make. I will make this often. Thank you Juliep - Good stuff...

This was very good. Next time I think I'll double the spices and saute and shallot or onion with the garlic. I used lamb instead of turkey. I also added fresh chopped cilantro to some Greek yogurt for a topping.

This was incredible - I followed a few of the other reviews and cut the chicken stock to about 3 cups, added some cauliflower, onion, and substituted curry for the coriander/turmeric.  I also added the cilantro to the plain yogurt with some lemon which was incredible.  Definitely making again and next time I'm adding just a little more cayenne.  Thank you!

Fabulous!  Added 1 small onion to initial seasonings.  Cooked ground turkey with half of the seasonings.  Added a few handfuls of fresh spinach at the same time as the beans.  Served over fresh spinach with greek salad.  Used 1 lb turkey, 1 can black beans, 1 can garbanzo beans & regular volume of brown rice (cooked 40 minutes).  Will definitely make this again.  Maybe tomorrow!

I halved this recipe for 4 people but I kept the spice level the same...so in a way I doubled the spices - I loved it! What I did was use half the seasoning on the rice and the other on the beef ( I used beef) so they both would have flavour throughout. It's great with some plain yogurt or sour cream....yum yum yum. thanks!!

This recipe was delicious!! I used it to stuff a zucchini. I halved the recipe and added just a little bit of pepper jack cheese to help it all stick together and it was great in the zucchini.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this.  For a healthier twist, substitute Quinoa for the rice (~3/4 cup) and add steamed carrots (adds a beautiful color to the dish as well)

This was great!  The only change I'll make next time is less cayenne pepper, it was a little too spicy for my kids so I add sour cream to theirs to cool it down.

YUM!  We loved this!  I make it once a week now.  I use curry instead of coriander and turmeric and don't usually have cilantro or parsley on hand.  I'll definitely try it with those two herbs and I'll even give it a try with yogurt too.

Loved it! Took other reviewers' advice: I served it with plain yogurt mixed with cilantro and lemon juice, and I added a little chopped spinach along with the cilantro--I am so glad I did. Thanks for the great recipe and reviews!

I thought this was a great recipe.  I did as someone else did and added about 1 small onion and seasoned the turkey with the same spices as called for in the rice mixture (added about 1/2 tsp of each in addition to the measurements suggested in the recipe), and added lots of black and cayenne pepper (I like it spicy).  I personally love the yellow color of the rice brought by one of my best friends, turmeric.  I also topped it with tons of fat free plain yogurt sprinkled with ground cumin and again covered the entire spread with more cayenne to step it up a notch.  I topped one half with diced cilantro and the other with diced parsley then alternated bites for a tasty good time.  Portion was large, but I get to have it for lunch all week... sweet.  Good stuff and would definitely recommend it. – Jesse Todhunter

This was fabulous.  I didn't expect my kids to enjoy it so much with all the parsley and cilantro, but they did.  I added sautéed onion and mushrooms with the garlic.  I also sautéed the parsley in a little butter and lemon juice from half a lemon before I added it to the mixture. I went sparingly on the cayenne pepper and didn't have pine nuts.   We set greek yogurt and salsa on the table for anyone to add to it.  We preferred the salsa with it.  Tomatoes are definitely a compliment to this dish.  We will eat this again.  Thanks so much for sharing it.

Delicious.  My first attempt at middle eastern cooking and it was a big hit.  Thank you for sharing! Didn't have enough rice so I added lentils to make up the difference but other than that I followed the recipe as written.  I did garnish with tomatoes and another reviewers yogurt sauce.   This recipe will be a regular in our house!

This was a wonderful base recipe! The flavor turns out relatively mild, so I'd recommend increasing the cumin and coriander. Turmeric can be a little overwhelming if you use too much, so I didn't increase the amount. I added fresh spinach at the end and served it with cilantro and paprika yogurt. Which I believe someone else did without the paprika.

I liked this recipe, but I didn't love it. I thought it was a good way to stretch a pound of ground beef and it made a lot of food.  I thought the fresh cilantro in it brightened the flavor, but next time I think I would put some raisins or dried apricots in it.  I also thought the cayenne gave it a nice kick, but wonder if a lot of folks thought it might be to spicy.  I also had to add a lot of salt to the final dish.  I was very flat without it.  I kept thinking it was missing something.  Thanks for sharing.

Easy, flavorful, and a nice change from the usual! My mom said the balance of spices was perfect!
I omitted the turkey as I did not have any, and followed the rest as written. Great side dish!
thanks!

We made this for a pot luck and many people asked for the recipe. I used ground chicken breast and put half of the spices on the chicken while frying it. This rice is good enough to eat without the meat, beans and chickpeas if you are looking for a flavorful rice.
Thanks for sharing!

Delicious. I used brown rice instead of basmati so it took longer to cook. Didn't have cilantro or pine nuts but bet they would be awesome! Served with a whole wheat pita, delicious.

I didn't add any beans. Used 2.25 cups of broth. Added about 5 cups of baby spinach. Topped with crumbled feta. VERY VERY GOOD. THe spinach stretches the meal, and like other reviewers said, is like an herb. I didn't add turkey to the rice, but instead made a turkey meatloaf.

I made the vegetarian version of this and thought that it was wonderful. It was a great quick and healthy meal. The coolness of the cold cucubmer & tomato salad that I served with it was a nice compliment to the rice and beans.

This was a great recipe.  Entire office loved it.  I made 4 servings and it comfortably fed 8 people.  I made some of the suggested changes.  3/4 cup brown rice in 2 cups chicken stock.  I used 3/4 lbs ground beef, I used the 1.5 tsp of curry instead of ingredients 4-6, I used a couple shakes of red pepper flakes instead of the cayenne, I used spinach chiffonade instead of parsley.  I used an entire bunch of cilantro.  I also served it on flat bread with a topping of greek yogurt about 8 oz. mixed with the juice of one lime.  Super good. and easy to make, except for all the darn time to cook the rice.  Next time I'll use a faster cooking rice.

I made this dish as a surprise for my Turkish husband.  I must say that if I am to make this again I will cut the spices in half, also add only one can of each of the beans.  It is very flavorful but even my husband said that it contained much to much spice.  I did mix up the plain yogurt with cilantro and it was very good but next time, if there is one I will use the dried version and less of it rather than the fresh.  This dish tasts much more Indian than Middle Eastern.

I used calrose med. grain rice and it worked fine. Did not include the pine nuts or the cilantro. Only used half a bunch of parsley and added 1 cup of chopped onions along with the garlic. A pleasant and easy curry that the heat level can be adjusted by increasing or reducing the pepper amount. Although we like garbanzo beans, next time will reduce it to one can as they dominated the flavor rather then melding into the dish. I served with sour cream but plain yogurt would work too.

Except leaving out the meat, using one can of each of the beans, and using a little less stock, I followed this recipe.  I really liked the flavors, and will use this often as a meat-free option in the menu rotation.  My four-year-old didn't even mind eating it!

YUMMY! Just the right amount of flavor. I followed other reviewer's suggestions and sauteed an onion with the garlic. I also added only 3 cups of stock instead of 4. I left it meatless and served it with plain yogurt and lemon juice. I like the fast cooking time and easy cleanup ...just one pot and a cutting board to wash! :)

This was great!  I took other reviewers' advice and served it in pita bread with plain yogurt.  Very satisfying.  I also added only 2.5 cups of chicken broth.  I had it as leftovers today wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla.  It was still good, but I liked it better with the pita bread.

My changes: I used 3 garlic cloves, and also substituted good quality curry powder for the turmeric, coriander and cumin. Not sure how much, just added until it tasted perfect. For fun I added a bit of mint and cardamom, too.  I used brown rice instead of basmati, and aduki beans instead of black (what was on hand).

This is going to be in my regular rotation!  It was very easy, most of the time spent was just waiting for the turkey and rice to cook - the house smelled amazing.

This recipe is wonderful! I omitted the ground turkey and added a 10oz pkg of spinach and a couple extra cloves of garlic (we have a high garlic tolerance). The mixture of spinach, black beans, and the turmeric create a gorgeously colored healthful meal.  I made it for the first time last week and my husband has already requested that I make it again.

Recipe was good.  My five star rating comes with the caveat that the following additions are made:

2 tsp salt in addition to the spices at the beginning.

Onion and celery in addition to the garlic.

fresh mint in addition to the cilantro and parsley.

Other than that, very good and easy to make

This is FANTASTIC!  I've made it twice so far, and both times it was wonderful!  The first time I used kidney beans instead of chickpeas, but the second time I used the chickpeas.  I only used 1 can each of the beans, because 4 cans of beans seemed like too much.  This is something that I will make over and over!

My husband and kids didn't care for it, and I thought it was "OK". I prepared it as the recipe stated and found it a little too bland for my liking. It's worth trying again though--I'd use less turkey and season it (like one reviewer said) with garlic, cumin seeds, coriander, salt, and maybe even a little lemon juice so it'd have more flavor. I'd also halve or even "third" the recipe--there was way too much to eat, even as leftovers. I'd also try yogurt and olives (kalamata) as garnish, as another reviewer did.

I made it as written with the exception of pine nuts. We loved it. Really loved it. I think it would do well with a variety of meats. Next time I'll try boneless/skinless chicken.

Great recipe. Thank you!

This dish was GREAT!  Very tasty! 
I seasoned the ground beef w/ salt and pepper b/c ground turkey can be bland.  I also threw in the beans (just one can of each) so that they would warm up and soften.  

I only used 1 tsp of curry and 2 tsp of cumin b/c that was all I had.

I also replaced the basmati for brown rice - following the directions on the box and adding about a half cup more of the stock.  It was SO moist.  I think a whole quart would have been way too much.

I cannot wait to make this again.

The spices for this dish are very overpowering!  Not cooking the turkey with spices (maybe some onion?) bland-ed it.  Also, the portions are HUGE!  I'm going to be eating garbonzo beans for a week!  :)  I'm not a fan of yellow-stained rice, either.  Nice try, but it was just OK.

Good, but man do the spices try to kill your sinuses! Maybe it's because I was using fairly fresh dried spices from the bulk section, but I don't see how anyone could call this bland. After reading the reviews, I divided the spices between the rice and the turkey, and cooked the cilantro and parsley with the turkey. I only had 1.25 pounds of turkey, but it worked out fine, and I thought that the full amount of beans was perfect. I was concerned about the amount of broth, but if you let the rice sit there for a few minutes after it is done cooking, it absorbs the excess broth nicely. Overall, this was tasty and filling, but nothing I'd rave about or make all the time.

Delicious and crazy nutritious!  Sauted some chopped onion with 3 garlic cloves and used 2 full lbs. of turkey.  I find 15 minutes to be enough time for the rice to cook.  The cilantro and parsley are a must!  I used ALL the broth which ended up making the concoction moist but not soupy.  Outstanding leftovers.   Loved this with the dollop of yogurt/lemon cilantro.

This recipe is great and I always make it for the Jewish holidays that we celebrate. However I must note do not over cook the rice!! Flavor is still there, but it gets very mushy.

This was great!I followed the advice of others and doubled the spices, using 1/2 for the rice and 1/2 for the meat. I also sauteed up some onions with the garlic at the beginning. I wouldn't reduce the amount of broth, as mine came out great as written. It definitely would have been too dry otherwise. I will absolutely make this again!

This recipe was really great and so easy because you can modify it to include whatever you've got in your fridge and pantry pretty easily.  I had leftover cooked quinoa that I used instead of the rice and I put in chopped green pepper and onion for an extra veg.  I didn't have chickpeas so I used white kidney beans instead.  All in all you can make this your own, different each time if you want and the base of the recipe will be a staple for me from now on.

A good and simple recipe. With some modifications it will definitely become a regular in my kitchen. It needs more spice, perhaps some mint and a spoon of yogurt on top.

Loved this recipe, will be making this over and over.  But I did make some changes:  1. I made it with quinoa instead of rice.  2. I added some yellow diced onion to the quinoa. 3. And added a handful of torn spinach when it was done cooking. 4.  As other people mentioned I only used one can each of black beans.  And instead of garbanzo,I used one can of white beans.  5. I used only 3T of cilantro 6. 3T of parsley.  I served it with a big green romaine salad of tomato and feet.

Loved this! I followed the advice of some others and only used 1 can of  black beans and 1 can of chickpeas and only 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock. I also only used half the amount of cayenne called for and served it with homemade pita bread. Such a great meal.

The flavoring was yummy but we didn't have the parsley, My mother made this for Easter & a couple people REALLY LOVED it.There was prob. only 1 C. (if that) leftover, however I personally was not a fan of the chickpeas...but If you are someone who is, then this is GREAT!Oh, and we didn't do any turkey & used veggie stock instead of chicken!

I have made this twice. The first time I did not have all the spices so I altered it. It was very good, but I can't remember what all I did to it lol. I know I did not use any meat. Instead I added red & green peppers & onion. I found it to need a lot of salt, though, which I didn't like.
This time & had all the spices (I did not measure them I eye balled it), & I still opted for no meat. Still added peppers, but yellow & red for this attempt. I also omitted the cilantro, parsley, & pine nuts (I'm not a fan of cilantro & parsley, & pine nuts are too expensive). I used long grain brown rice in place of the basmati rice as well. The flavors haven't had time to marry yet, but it already tastes  incredible!

I made a 4 serving version.  Based upon reviews of the rice being too liquidy - I cooked the rice separate according to the rice package instructions (I did not saute or use garlic).   I rinsed the rice, soaked for 15 mins & simmered on low for 35 mins using chicken stock and I added half of the spices to the rice.  Cooked perfectly.  I then cooked the turkey with 1/2 cup onion and the other half of the spices using slightly less (1/8 tsp) of cayenne. I heated the beans up with the turkey for a few minutes.  To the turkey mixture I then added the cooked rice, 1 TBS parsley and 1 TBS cilantro.  This was not too spicy...mild to med.  I did not need any salt, pepper or pine nuts.  VERY tasty!

I totally rearranged this recipe but what was the real star for me was the spice mix.  So tasty.  I had cooked rice already and so I mixed the garlic with the spices and added them to the beans (just black beans, no garbanzo) added minced onion too, then served the spiced beans over the rice with a fried egg and yogurt.  I also had sliced lettuce and spinach to complement it.  Wow yummy.

Interesting textural contrasts between the meat and beans and rice.  I felt like it was missing something, though, and I haven't tried it again with anything added yet...

I didn't have any of the 'optional' cilantro, but I wish I did. The flavour definitely would have added to the dish. My whole family (kids and all) really loved this dish, but I'm only giving it 4 stars as opposed to 5 because serving it with yogurt or sour cream is so essential to the finished product that I feel it should be written into the recipe :)

I halved the recipe and used the ingredients I had on hand. Cooked the turkey with half an onion and the spices (cumin, curry, turmeric, parsley and some red chili flakes). Only used about a cup of chicken broth. Added some cooked rice at the end. From my experience, this is a forgiving recipe!

Wow this is REALLY good, I'm so glad I finally made it! I skipped the turkey as I wanted it meatless, skipped the turmeric as I didn't have any and skipped the cilantro as I didn't want to buy a huge bunch. When I first added the beans to the rice I thought it was going to be WAY too much beans but once it was all mixed together, it was a great amount. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

It's ok. IT tastes similar to the Kitchari recipe I found on here.
 I used beef broth (half the amount) and added yogurt at the end. I also subbed curry powder for the coriander and tumeric. I think next time I'll only do 1/2 t of red pepper though...it was a little spicy for me (since I don't eat super spicy stuff much).

Oh my YES!!! This is delicious! I used ground pork and seasoned it as it cooked. I doubled the spices, used a tad less stock, and omitted the pine nuts. I dressed it with yoghurt tinged with lime, cayenne, and cumin...WONDERFUL!!! And soooo healthy!!! Thanks you for sharing this GREAT recipe!!!

Alone-this dish was a bit bland. However, I made some Raita to top it off and it was wonderful! Raita is a yougurt, cumin, garlic and cayenne pepper sauce often used in Indian cooking.

I made this as directed.  It was very good, but I wanted more complexity to the spices; it felt like it was missing one or two flavors.

This is delicious! I'm eating it right now and it's so good! I used instant brown rice as that's what I had on hand. I threw everything in the pot (I skipped the turkey) and simmered it for about 15 minutes. I then covered it and let it simmer, stirring occasionally, until it was as thick as I wanted it. I'm eating it with a little sour cream on top. Fantastic!

LOVED this dish.  skipped the meat - didn't think it was necessary with two kinds of beans.  sauteed the onion and garlic together with the spices to start with.  added a couple of sliced carrots at this stage too.  threw in the beans along with some frozen peas and corn to bump up the veg factor.  also toasted the pine nuts to bring out the flavour.  love this dish - made lots for leftovers too.

this recipe was great. i added a little salt and pepper to the rice while cooking. the liquid seemed to be a bit much, but actually it was just the right amount. it added moisture to the rest of the dish. i also added about a tbsp of butter to the rice after it was cooked, but before i mixed in the rest of the ingredients.    i didn't have any coriander, so i used 1 tsp tarragon leaves and 1 tsp of sage. i also added a little curry powder to the turkey while cooking it (as suggested by others, since it has the coriander in it), and it definitely made it taste great. i only used parsley, no cilantro, and it was a large handful rather than the whole bunch. i felt it was plenty.  overall, it was tasty, healthy and even my hubby, who doesn't like rice, ate it up. will definitely make again.

This was fantastic!  I made it vegetarian by using veggie broth instead of chicken stock and by using TVP instead of turkey.  I also doubled the spices and just used brown rice instead of basmati because that's what I had on hand.  This variation of beans and rice makes my mouth water!!  Great coupled with a flat bread!

Made vegetarian. I just threw everything but the beans in the rice cooker and turned it on. I heated up the beans in the microwave and added after the rice was done, bc I wasn't sure about whether or not beans were meant to be in the rice cooker. Couldn't be easier! The taste was delicious as well. Will make again for sure.

This was very good!  I made a few changes...I added a can of diced tomato, baby spinach, and frozen peas.  This made it a one dish meal which was nice.  Everyone loved it except my youngest brother but since he never likes anything with spices he doesn't count.  People who aren't used to spicy food might want to go easy on the cumin though.

My GF is a vegetarian so I substituted veg stock for chix stock. I also added some fake chicken pieces (Quorn). The Yogurt topping another reader suggests is a great idea, too.

I love all of these ingredients, but this dish just didn't do it for me. And it wasn't just me because I have way too much leftover as no one took seconds - and I'm talking about 10 Israelis who love their spices... Just didn't grab me.

SOOOOO GOOD!!!! I used heaping measurements but that was the only change.  Delicious!  I serve with a lemon and cilantro spiked sour cream (rarely have plain yogurt on hand) and my husband can't get enough.  He likes to wrap them up in corn tortillas.  I'm a vegetarian so for my version I used Morning Star Farms crumbles and cooked in a no beef broth and added a little cumin.  This recipe is on permanent rotation in my house!

I would make this again.  I followed some suggestions of others as well as my own impulses and made the following changes:  1) Used 3 tsps curry in place of coriander & turmeric. 2) I used HEAPING tsps of spice in the rice (except for cayenne).   3) Use no more than 3 cups broth. 4) Saute an onion before browning meat. 5) Add same spices to meat while simmering (and I slow cooked it for a while!). 6) Used only 1 can each of beans. 7) Did not use cilantro, parsley, or pine nuts. 8) Added golden raisins.

Very good! I will be making this again.  I used curry and added a little extra coriander and cumin.  Also added cilantro and some yogurt on the side.  Did not use pine nuts or parsley, as I did not have those on hand.

Since it was meatless night, I did not use the ground turkey. I only used 1 can of chickpeas and black beans and omitted the parsley. I could not find pine nuts. Also, I used much more spice than the recipe called for and less chicken stock. Topped with light sour cream. My husband even liked it! This recipe is a part of my meatless folder. Will definitely make again.

It was pretty good. I cut the recipe in half on the site. To be fair, I did not follow the recipe exactly because I did not use basmati rice.  I used already cooked rice (2 1/2 cups) and added chicken flavoring to it. I also used 1 tsp. jamaican curry powder since I did not have tumeric. I browned the turkey with onion and garlic then seasoned the meat after draining it so it would retain the flavor.  I found that I needed to add some more seasoning and salt after adding the rice and beans... please add the fresh cilantro and parsley as other reviewers have suggested and if you like, a pinch of brown sugar, as it really brings out the flavors.

The aroma and flavor was great, but next time I'll double the rice and add onions and maybe hold back on the cayenne.  The ratio seems a bit off, but maybe I used too much gr turkey.

I used ground turkey, added chopped onion (as several reviewers noted) and because I like spice, doubled the amount of spices (again, one reviewer recommended); used brown rice because I watch carbs.  I liked it very much, seemed very healthy, but next time I think I'd use the amount of spices in the original recipe and see how that tastes, especially if I want to cook for a potluck or something, as double spice may be too much for some palates.

Fabulous! I used 3/4 of the chicken broth called for and it turned out great. This recipe makes ALOT of food.. we cut the recipe in 1/2 and still had a ton leftover! Served with pitas and hummus. Thanks for a great recipe.. we will definitely make this again.

Served this for dinner tonight.  It was very tasty however, the measurements seemed off. For one thing, 1 cup of rice is not enough and we could barely taste the rice. This might be because I used brown rice which is not as fluffy as basmati.  I only had one can of garbanzo beans and 1 can of black beans.  The recipe called for 2 cans of each but 1 can each was plenty.  Also, I would probably use a little less turkey as there was more of this than anything else.  Other than that, the seasoning mix was perfect and everyone loved it including my 2 year old son.  I will definitely be making this again.

this is amazing! didn't have tumeric but i'm not familiar with that spice anyway. apparently it's an important one because Martha Stewart says we should be putting it in everything since it's so good for the body. guess i'll use it the next time i make this. i can't believe i made something so delicious! fresh cilantro is a must! i bet it's gonna taste even better the next day with all those great spices.

Pretty good.  I would make this again but might make some changes.  I followed the recipe quantities as is but used only one can of each type of bean. Firstly, this makes enough to serve 8 as indicated on the recipe and that quite a bit of food when all done. I couldn't imagine myself using the 2 cans of beans for each type. If I make again I will cut recipe in half because I'm just cooking for one.  Also, for some reason my basmati rice was slightly on the mush side. I followed other reviewers suggestion of decreasing broth so I guess next time I will use spices with water to cook basmati so it comes out the way I usually make the rice. I'll probably leave out the turkey next time as it was a bit pricey and I think it will be just as tasty with beans only. I added a small side salad or topping of tomatoes and cucumbers in lemon juice, olive oil, s&p and thought it complimented the dish.

I made this exactly as the recipe calls for except one thing - I took the advice of another reviewer and kept the parsley and cilantro to 2tblsp of each.  It was very good and even my picky "I hate curry" husband loved it.

Wow, I can't believe I made something that tastes so good! Eight servings seemed like a lot, so I halved the recipe. Glad I did because my skillet was almost overflowing! I took the advice of some of the previous reviews and subbed a doubled amount of curry powder for the dried seasonings. I also added spinach that I cut up (I decided to forgo the cilantro and parsley). Also chose 3/4c. brown rice instead of 1/2c. basmati rice as the halved recipe called for. These tweaks resulted in a beautiful dish, so colorful and fragrant! I had no idea what to expect taste-wise, but I'm more than happy with how this turned out. Easily one of my favorite recipes that I've experimented with on this site thusfar. Can't wait to dig into the leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

I make with two cups of instant brown rice and one cup of chicken instead of turkey. I also use Goya pigeon peas instead of black beans.

I made this in advance at lunchtime to eat for dinner, and the meal ended up as my lunch because it was so good. I actually added diced tomatoes and carrots to sautee with the garlic to get extra veggies in, and just added chickpeas as I had no black beans on hand. For the spices, I put half each in with the rice and meat to get the flavour throughout.

Wonderful!  I used ground beef but stuck to the chicken broth, and I used 1 1/2 teaspoons of curry instead of the corriander and tumeric.  Flavorful, spicy, and easy.  This will be a favorite in our home, I'm sure.

The flavors in this recipe are absolutely terrific. I backed off a bit on the cayenne pepper keep things from getting too hot, but otherwise kept everything the same. I would not omit the parsley and cilantro if you can help it - they really add to the dish. I was very glad that the recipe made so much - I have been enjoying the leftovers for lunch! I can definitely see this as a vegetarian dish and omitting the meat altogether. I look forward to cooking this recipe that way for my vegetarian in-laws. I served this with a salad made from diced fresh tomato and marinated mushrooms.

DELISH!  We loved this one.  We spooned the rice into pitas and my husband referred to it as "Middle Eastern tacos."  I also made a Tzatziki (sp?) recipe from this site.  Great pair!

This was really a good recipe and quite different. I did not use any meat or turkey with mine, but I did add onion as one reader suggested.  Very tasty.  Next time I might grate up a little carrot (and perhaps add a little celery) for color. Will definitely make again.

I made this exactly as listed and it was delicious. I didn't use curry as some suggested because there's more than the two main ingredients in curry.  I had no problem of too wet of a dish although I thought it may be when I read reviews but I  wanted to do it original . Everyone ( 8 people) loved it.  So this will be made again.  I could americanize it but all in all it was great .

I read some of the top comments and made the changes they recommended, and it was alright. I sauteed an onion with the garlic, used 2 tbsp. of parsley and cilantro, added the spices to both the turkey and the rice, used one can of beans each, and used two cups of broth instead. I had two issues with the dish though, it was very dry (maybe need to add more broth) and the chickpeas were too crunchy compared to everything else (maybe need to cook the beans with the turkey instead of just adding them at the end).

Great recipe, with a few modifications.  DEFINITELY cut down the chicken stock!  Or you will have soup.  1 cup of rice/2 cups broth is the correct amount.  I also enjoy adding green cardamom to the rice as it cooks. Don't be shy with the other spices...a little extra cumin/coriander/cayenne will make it pop.

I found this recipe about 5 or 6 years ago on allrecipes. It is so  good that I added it to my normal dinner rotation - so on average I make this about once a month (for the last 6 years).  It amazes me that I find it just as good each and every time I make it.   

A couple of helpful hints:

Don't follow the quantity of broth on the recipe, rather just follow the liquid-to-rice ratio on whatever type of rice you are using. 

Cut Cayenne pepper in half if you are feeding people sensative to heat.

I only use 1 can each of chick peas and black beans and typically do 1.5 cups of rice. 

And my favorite thing:  add a dollop of sour cream to the top of each dish - it's Delish.

Good with Naan.  I only used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper.  That was good amount for the kids.  I would add less meat next time (1/2 lb).

Very good! Such a change to throw in your weekend meals or even weekday. My husband and 15 year old son loved it, my 14 year old daughter enjoyed it but had to have it with sour cream because it was too spicy. If someone doesn't like spicy than hold out on the cayenne pepper. All other spices are phenomenal!

I didn't measure the spices but I know I used a lot more than the recipe called for. I also added curry powder. I cut the recipe in half and it made a ton of food. It's very tasty and I am sure will be making this again.

Very good! I didn't have coriander, but it was seasoned nicely anyway. As recommended, I cut down stock (I used vegetable stock to accommodate my vegetarian daughter) to about 3 cups. I'd also didn't use pine nuts (not in the pantry) and used only one can of each bean. My chef husband thought this was really good.

Came out well enough, but I'd recommend leaving out the meat and just using it as a side dish instead. If you do want the meet, I'd advise against turkey, which disappeared among the spices.

The specified recipe will make A LOT--living alone, I'm finding it hard to go through all the leftovers before it goes bad. As a side dish, I'd say it's enough for more than a dozen people, and even as an entree it could probably feed 10.

Delicious!I omitted the turkey since I'm vegetarian and added roasted cauliflower. I followed suggestions to cut down on the broth, so only used 2 cups. So, so good! Added a spoonful of plain yogurt to the top to finish the dish.  My 5 year old had 2 huge platefuls.

Exchanged smoked paprika for cayenne.  Only added one can of garbanzo beans.  Handful of cilantro and a little less parsley.  Perfect for packed lunch and improves as leftovers!  I made it without meat.  I also made a version with brown rice I had soaked overnight, and that worked well, also.

I really liked this dish. I followed the recipe with a substitution of toasted pepitas for the pine nuts. This could easily be made vegetarian and that is the main reason I chose it, but we added turkey as written this go 'round. Thank you for posting!

This was very yummy! I added a small chopped onion to the garlic, used less coriander and cayenne, and I only used one can of garbanzo beans. Next time I will probably only use one can of black beans as well. I also added a little curry powder to the turkey. REALLY good! Thanks!

When it comes to flavor, this was spot on. I made some adjustments per other reviews I read, such as using 1 can of broth, using curry powder in place of the other two spices, and cooking the chicken with the rice. The only problem I had with the recipe was the rice. It took much longer than the said 20 minutes for it to even get soft. Instead, it sat on our burner for over an hour, and that is only after cranking up the heat. Not really sure what went wrong. Used the basamati rice, unless it was because it came straight from the freezer. If anyone knows, it would be helpful to know, because I'd really like to make this again---but not with the time involved. Still had to give it four stars, because other than the rice, it was really good!

Btw, I used chicken instead of turkey.

Wow! Fantastic flavors, ingredients are easily adjusted to your taste/availability. I used what I had around the house- dried blk beans, soaked then cooked in broth and spice; sauteed onions & carrots, mixed with brown rice and spice and broth (45 min); about half a lb each ground turkey & turkey bacon with spices; added some corn, and served on a bed of spinach topped with toasted sesame seeds. Since I used the spices in each element seperately, who KNOWS how much I used, lol! Since it received rave reviews from my kids- 4, 8 &10- as well as adults, it must be a keeper!! Thanks so much for a new twist on beans and rice.

Delicious, will make again! I made a few changes, but I don't think it affected the main idea of the dish. I halved the recipe but used 1 lb of ground pork (instead of 3/4 lb ground turkey). I browned the meat with the garlic and spices. I used cooked rice because that's all I had and eyeballed the amount of chicken stock, adding just enough to keep everything moist without drowning it. I used the cilantro and parsley but not the pine nuts (didn't have any). I think it would be great garnished with chopped fresh veggies, such as red onion, tomato, avocado or others.

I haven't eaten very much middle eastern food and I certainly hadn't cooked it before, but my friend wanted to have a middle eastern meal so I found this recipe.  It was a huge hit!  I was really outside of my comfort zone when I cooked this and I used spices that I had never used before, but it was so easy and the taste was incredible.  Next time I make it, I've decided to add some fresh spinach.  This is the kind of dish that you can add different things to.  I've never used coriander or turmeric before, but I really enjoyed using them and the taste is sensational.  This will be a recipe I use and reuse again and again!

Not horible but very bland.  It was just missing something.  Maybe seasoning the meat would be a better idea but I did not like the taste enough to try this again.

This was a great quick recipe, we had everything on hand. I added some onion, and threw some flax seed in instead of pine nuts for a crunch. I would try this with lean spicy turkey sausage as well.

I think an important part of this recipe is adding spice to the meat.  The flavor was wonderful in the rice, but didn't saturate into the turkey and bean mixture well enough.  In agreement with over raters, a bunch of cilantro and parsley is way too much for this dish - unless that is the only flavor you want to come through.  Despite sounding critical, I'm a big fan and will definitely make again with my suggested modifications!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!!!

I love this dish.  I cut it in half and use veggie crumbles rather than turkey.  I do use the full amount of cayenne pepper to get that extra heat.

Turned out great.  Great middle eastern flavors.  I used 1/2 the cilantro (husband does not like) and added 11/2 of chopped baby spinach.  Will be in our favorite meal rotation.  Froze leftovers in single serving portions.  My husband liked it so well I don't think it will last long.

Very Good. I halved the recipe, didn't have basmati rice-subbed Jasmine rice, didn't have chickpeas - subbed cannellini beans, used ground lamb and followed the rest of the recipe. Very delicious with lamb. A little soupy which is just perfect for a cold night.  It is worth a try.

This was a wonderfully, different use for ground turkey, rice and beans.  I modified the recipe a bit based some of the reviews and it came out great!  My 6-year-old said: "I don't know what you are making, but it smells great".  It tasted great too!

We really liked this.  I made it without meat and only used 1 can each of chickpeas and black beans.  I also only used 2 cups of chicken stock (as indicated by the bag of rice).  The flavor was fantastic, but next time I would cut back on the cayenne pepper (and we usually love spicy foods)!  As suggested by one reviewer I served this with cilantro yogurt, which my husband loved.  Next time I will add the meat and also make some naan to serve with it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was fantastic.  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of using walnuts in place of pine nuts  because I didn't have any on hand.  I considered cutting the cilantro and parsley as recommended by another review, but I ended up adding the full amount in increments because every time I added more, it just got better.  This is going in my permanent recipe file.

SO DELICIOUS! I make this twice a month now, after I made it this summer for the first time...and every time I make it, there are no leftovers! It's just amazing.  For those who are like me and tend to scorch your spices rather than toasting them, I found that you can work around that. Add the spices that are listed for the rice, straight into the meat after you've cooked it; the rice will still get that great yellow color. The flavors aren't quite as intense, but it's a lot easier for some of us :)

LOVED IT!  I followed others' suggestions and reduced the broth (by 25%) and it came out perfect.  I would go easy on the parsley, I used a third of a "tube" of the crushed cilantro and just a little parsley. That's probably the max I'd want to use.  This was REALLY good with a dollup of plain "greek style" yoghurt on top (it's like sour cream). I ate it also in pita bread too.  I will make this again for sure!

Wow, I LOVE this dish!  I already want to make it again this week, but will spare my husband and wait until next week :)  I forgot the pine nuts and didn't have fresh cilantro or parsley, but could tell that the parsley especially would have been a nice compliment.  I halved it and it made enough for leftovers for my husband and I the next day (my picky 2-year-old didn't like it).  Wonderful flavor and just the right amount of heat!  Will be making this often!

This is absolutely delicious!  I had a few improptu guests and this made 5 large portions, enough for everyone!  It was a huge hit!    I made a few additions and substitutions: I used cannelini beans instead of chick peas because it was all I had in the house.  They held up well when I added them at the end.  I also added spinach and fresh ginger to the turkey while it was cooking.  The ginger really added a wonderful flavor!

Very yummy!  I didn't have turmeric or ground turkey, and I halved the recipe.  Still yummy though!

LOVE this recipe!  I had so much food, I brought in two large bowls of leftovers to work and it disappeared!  I paired it with Peppy's Pita Bread (from this site-I added garlic powder to the dough) and the yogurt sauce with garlic and cilantro suggested by another reader.  Absolutely wonderful dish!

This came out with a really disagreeable, gritty texture. Perhaps I should try a different kind of ground turkey or another meat or none at all.

my husband and I really enjoyed this - we had everything on hand except the cilantro, parsley and pine nuts and it tasted great without them.  However next time, we'd like to add the pine nuts and some onions cooked with the turkey

YUM! Next time I'll cut the cayenne a bit, too much for my 3yr old. Took another poster's tip and stuffed this in pita pockets, fresh cilantro on top and yogurt on the side to dip. Really delicious and could easily be done without meat in my opinion. Will be making this one often!

I used this recipe in combination with a mango chicken curry I found on the site and it was spectacular. Just leave out the turkey and sub chicken. Also I thought the cilantro was essential, it gave it just enough kick. Great recipe!

I've made this multiple times, even substituted the ground turkey with ground chicken.  I have also done it subbing pigeon peas for the black beans.  I only cook with brown rice and it works well with this recipe. I season the ground meat so it isn't bland.  Dish is fulling and keeps well.

This was very easy and tasted good.  I used no-salt added beans and I thought the oveall taste was a bit bland.  I may use regular beans next time.  I ended up adding back in the salt at the end anyways.

0mitted tumeric because I was out.  Great dish, bit I may consider cutting back on the beans next time as they seem to overwhelm the dish.

I am so glad I came across this recipe, although I had to adjust it to my taste. 5 stars with the changes I made: 3 tbsp olive oil. 3 cloves garlic. Add 3 chopped green onions to the oil and garlic. 2 cups rice. Curry powder instead of turmeric. 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper. 5 cups chicken stock. No meat. No salt. 1 can of each of the beans. A handful of cilantro. This was soooooooooo good.

I will make again becasue it is delicious and healthy but I was somewhat dissapointed. I felt it needed some tweaking. I used dried beans and added a good amount of salt because of that. I would probably double the spices next time except the cayenne. The rice was wetter than I expected. It was a lot of liquid for that amount of rice called for but maybe that's the way it's supposed to be? Make sure you get the good quality basmati (mine at Sam's Club). You should always rinse it of the startch so it doesn't stick together. I didn't do this for the recipe but now I know to do it for the future. I didn't use any meat and didn't have any of the optional ingredients on hand though I'm sure they would have added a nice touch.

This recipe was fantastic, and oh-so-easy! I doubled the spices, and used half with the rice, and the other half while browning the turkey. I used veg stock, but I'll try chicken stock next time and also use strips of chicken breasts rather than turkey (though the turkey was delicious). We served thickened plain yogurt (strained yogurt through cheesecloth for a day) ontop. It made enough to feed an army, but it's versatile enough that we can change the leftovers into burrito fillings, etc.

WOW! These spices all mix so well and it's so flavorful without being overpowering. It's so easy to make too! I did make a yogurt dip that some one else suggested with two 6 oz cups of plain yogurt, the juice and zest from half a lemon & some of the fresh cilantro. We had a friend over for dinner and she loved it and so did we!

I followed the recipe except that I reduced the beans and stock, and cooked half the spices with the meat and the other half with the rice as per several reviewers' suggestions . It was ok. Im sure this tastes good for the recipe it is; maybe Im just not crazy about this particular spice combination--although I like Middle Eastern spicing. If I were to make it again I'd probably add raisins and some cinnamon, just to give it some contrasting flavor-- needs a little sweetness or something. I added a generous squirt of ketchup, maybe it was my attempt to add some sweetness.

Wow I don't know what to say. I loved the spice combination and the beans and chickpeas. The rice, well not so much. I would use Jasmine rice. This recipe has inspired me to create my own dish. I would use jasmine rice, tomato juice in place of broth, green or jalapeno peppers and top with cheese at serving time.

I found this recipe to be a little bland.  It's missing some sort of acid, like lemon juice or something. I had to top with salsa and sour cream for added flavor.  I agree that raisins would be a good addition, but I'm not a super-fan and won't be making it again.

I enjoyed this dish. At first taste i wasn't sure because of the seasonings.. I wasn't familiar with them.On second,third and fourth taste.. I REALLY ENJOYED IT. I did use only 1 can of each of the beans, which for me was enough. i had company that day so i had extra taste buds for review and they liked it also.Next time i will add a little more spice. It's a reall nice change from the everyday meal.

Very good. Used the recipe calculator and only made enough for 2 servings (made a cold bean salad for the next day with the leftover beans). We didn't add quite as much cilantro because one of us isn't a big fan. We added slivered almonds instead of pine nuts and it added a nice texture. Will definitely make again.

Very, very good! Next time I make it, I'm going to swap out 1/2 - or maybe all - of the black beans for golden raisins. I kept wanting a slightly sweet balance in the dish, and I think that would do it.

This was very tasty. I didn;t find it too spicy. I did think it was a little dry, but I resovled that issue by shredding up a little zucchini , sauteing it a bit and stirring it in.  I did half the beans as recommended by others and that was the right choice. I'll make this again.

Since it's just me and hubby, I reduced everything except the rice by 1/2.  Came out great! The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I can't imagine having 1 qt of liquid to 1 c of rice!

This recipe is definitely a keeper.  I added added chopped onion with the garlic, cut down on the chicken stock, and left out the turkey.  It was good hot, but it was great the next day when I served it cold over salad greens and tomatoes, with nutritional yeast and Bob's Salad Dressing (from this site).  Next time I make it, I'll jazz it up a bit by doubling the spices, but that's about the only thing needed to make it a five-star recipe.

This was "okay."  Careful if you prefer milder flavors like we do. It was a bit too spicy for us (esp for me as I did not put turkey in my portion- husband had turkey in his and said that cut down the spiciness some but still not enough)- I wish I had used about half as much cayenne.  Without so much heat, I would add more spice but right now am not sure which/how much over the cayenne. Also, this is my first time cooking with basmati rice and it came out quite mushy- more I expected.  I don't know if it is supposed to be that way or not for this recipe, and maybe my stove's low cooks differently or something, but I would have preferred a firmer rice. I did notice that the cooking directions on the rice box are about half of what the recipe states so if I ever made this again I would follow the box directions for cooking instead. Loved the tons of beans- husband and I are both huge fans of beans.  This needs to be eaten with a HUGE salad or something light to balance it out as it is such a dense dish.

Has potential.  If I made it again, I would half the cayenne and double all the other spices.  Also reduce broth to 2 1/2 cups and only use 1 can of each bean.  I think that might do it, but my husband is not willing to try it again.

I thought this was great! Used 1 can black beans and 2 cans chick peas -- liked that proportion! Used 2-3 TBL parsley - that was plenty.  Out of cilantro -- will Definitely add that next time. Pine nuts - a must too!

This was bean overkill! That being said, it had a really good flavor the hubby and I loved.  Our kids were another story, two out of three declared war while it was cooking and all of them ended up eating PB&J for dinner.  Next time I make it, and I will, I will only use one can of beans, but as the description states, the add-ins are endless and I'll use my imagination.

I really enjoyed this recipe.. I had to change it up a little due to the ingredients I had available and my being vegetarian. I used instead long grain rice, pinto and black beans, no ground coriander just lots of extra fresh. No pine nuts and I used V8 and a cup of water in place of stock. I probably doubled the spices in the end. It was yummy and I served it with plain yoghurt mixed with cilantro, lemon and a couple of serrano peppers. Will definitely make again!

I doubled the rice/spice ingredients (with the exception of cumin) and the beans/chicken/rice ratio turned out just about right.    This looks like it would be overwhelmingly spicy with the called for amount of cayenne, but it's not.  Just a nice 'not boring' kick!

Excellent recipe. All in family raved about the healthy ingredients and flavor. Added green and red pepper, onion and some fresh diced tomatoes as well as some extra herbs from the garden (basil/rosemary). Cut the quantity of beans  in half. Will definitely make again.

This stuff is good!  I went meatless and only used 1 can of each type of bean (more than enough).  Spices were perfect as listed.  I also used only 1 15 oz can of stock and about 3/4 cup of water...perfect.  Added a dollop of sour cream to each serving which went very well!  Will definitely make again.

Very good recipe.  Like others, I added some chopped onion to the garlic.  I had already dumped in all the chicken stock when I remembered people saying it was too much, so I added some more rice to compensate.  Overall, this is a very good, hearty dish.

Excellent!  The rice took a little longer to cook due to the rice to liquid ratio, but so very worth it!  Can't wait to turn this into something mexican later in the week.  We loved this and so healthy.  Thanks.

We used soy crumbles in place of meat to have a veggi main course.  This is a fabulous tasting meal!  But, there is no reason to double the amount of liquid used for the rice.  Parsley and cilantro make this recipe - don't leave them out!  Add the Persian Cucumber Yogurt Sauce as a side and you won't be sorry!

This recipe was great! Even my kids loved it! I realized after I'd already started that I was out of turmeric so I just left that out. I also substituted ground beef since that's what I had on hand. It was still delicious. This recipe makes a lot of food (leftovers!). I stuffed some into a wheat pita the next day for lunch and it was fabulous! Thanks for a great recipe! Will definitely make this one again.

Easy to make, smells wonderful, packed full of protein, and the kids loved it.  I had plenty of leftovers and repurposed the turkey, beans, and chickpeas in tacos--just added some Mexican seasoning and served with all the fixings.  Two hits from one recipe.

I thought this was wonderful.  I left out the cayenne for the kids.  Even the baby loved it!  I used brown rice and let it cook a lot longer than the recipe called for.  I also added dried chopped apricots, which was a delish addtion!

Very yummy and nutritious recipe!  I personally cut out the turkey and used veggie stock.  Also took other reviewers advice on using only 2 1/2 cups of water.  Didn't have any of the optional ingredients on hand but still was delish.  I plan to use both the cilantro and parsley next time.  Thanks for sharing!

We really enjoyed this recipe. The flavor balance was delicious. Made plenty of leftovers to take for lunch the next couple of days.

This was delicious, we will definitely make it again. It was a little more soupy than we expected it to be, but that could have been something we did and in no way affected the taste of the dish. I would expect it to thicken up tomorrow when we have it as leftovers. YUM!

Very aromatic, yummy tasting and easy to make.  You can even make adjustments if you don't have all the ingredients on hand.  The amount of stock is a bit much.  I used 1/2 c rice and 2 c stock... even that was too much.  However, I let it cook on low for an additional 5 minutes and most of the liquid was absorbed. I also only used 1 can of black beans since I didn't have chick peas.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

WOW, this is one flavourful dish!!  I only used one can each of the beans (only making it for the 2 of us) and only had about 3/4 lb of ground turkey.  I did keep all other ingredients as is except cut the cayenne in half (due to experience with other recipes using cayenne).  Per some other reviewers, I didn't use a full quart of chicken stock (maybe about 2 1/2 cups) and it all came together beautifully, with a nice kick too!  Oh, I didn't add the cilantro as we don't like it and just eyeballed my fresh parsley as a whole bunch would have been overkill in my opinion!  Also, this makes a ton and the leftovers are just as fantastic...maybe even better!

Delicious!  I've made this recipe multiple times.  You can really play with it if you're missing ingredients.  If you don't want yellow rice, don't add the turmeric.  I've used different types of rice and they all taste great.  The timing, of course, just changes for each one.  I sub almonds for the pine nuts since they're so expensive.  You can also sub in peanuts.  Either way, you should cook the nuts in a little oil on the stove first to bring out the flavor. Serve with a plain yogurt or sour cream and an Arabic salad (chopped tomatoes and cucumbers with lemon juice, salt, and pepper).  It's a huge recipe so I always half it for 5-6 people.

This was very good! I added chopped onion and a small amount of tomato juice from a can of tomatoes. I also squeezed a little lemon when it was ready to serve.

This is the second time I've made this - I wanted to make it again for my parents because I thought they'd really like it too.  I did only use one can of black beans and one can of chickpeas but the same amount of turkey.  If I was making the dish for myself, I'd add more spices than called for.  They are not as adventurous when it comes to eating as I am when cooking, so I stuck to the recipe amounts...  Instead of adding pine nuts, I like sprinkling slivered almonds toasted in butter on top.

I thought this was a little bland, despite all the spices. I would cut the beans in half, first so I could taste those spices, and second because this receipe made sooo much, we were eating this for days!

This was excellent.  I cut the recipe in half because there were only two of us eating.  The only changes I made - used fresh mint for the herbs and omitted the turkey.  When the rice was done, I stir fried some blackened shrimp to go over the rice.  For a side dish (and to cool things off a bit!), we had a dilled cucumber salad made with sour cream, mayo and a touch of vinegar.  Wonderful combination.  Will definitely make this again!

This great recipe had so many reviews that I had no patience to reiew them all; please excuse me if I repeat.  Instead of adding the spices to the rice, I added them all to the ground turkey.  I figured the ground turkey would absorb the flavors better. Additionally, I added a cup of kalamata olives at the end with the parsely and the pine nuts.  Yum-o!  Kudos to the recipe creator for giving us all a basis for creating our own special healthy meal.

Very good!  I used 2 cans of garb. beans instead of black beans.  Also added chopped onion with the ground turkey which I cooked first then added everything to so there was only 1 pot.  Would be very good with eggplant and/or zucchini and yogurt to top.  Next time will add more rice, I felt there needed to be more (it was more gr turkey with rice than rice with gr turkey).  Very nice flavors though, will make again.  Even my husband whom doesn't like beans gobbled it down.

I thought this was a great tasting, healthy meal. I cut the recipe in half (3/4lb ground turkey, one can each beans, 1 can chick broth, and the spices to our tasting). I did however use 1 cup uncooked brown rice because I found the recipe a little to watery using half. Other than that, I thought it was great.

This is delicious.  My husband loved it and my children did as well.  Warning though, they were fighting over who was taking the left overs for lunch the next day.  I had to step in the middle of the fray and claim them for myself!  Teach them...

DELICIOUS!!!  I made this exactly as written - except used curry instead of tumeric , and dried cilantro and parsley. Also didn't use pine nuts.  This made a TON of food!  It's good reheated though, and it's so delicious that I don't even mind eating it for a couple more meals!  I may try it with pita and tzaziki as recommended.  Thanks for the great recipe!  It's a great year-round recipe and I will be making this again and again!

Outstanding recipe!  I added some onions with the turkey as suggested by the other reviewers and it came out great!

Watch out for the ground turmeric...it really stains, so don't wear your best clothes if you are cooking or eating this.

Although I can only give this recipe 5 stars, in our house it rates a 10! My entire family loves it (a rarity), it's fast and easy to make, and it's healthy and packed with protein. I use ground beef instead of turkey, dry herbs (because it's winter) and increase the garlic (which helps keeps us healthy in cold/flu season). Like a previous reviewer suggested, I add seasoning to the ground beef. It's become a regular and very popular dish and I'm delighted to have found it.

This was amazingly delicous.  I love middle eastern foods and I served it at a pot luck.  I left out the chick peas and added another can of black beans.  I also added garlic about 4 cloves as I put garlic in everything.  Everyone was asking me if I had the recipe.  Tasty and filling....

I made this with a few adaptions: I used Jasmin rice and cumin and curry as mentioned in a review below. I substituted pine nuts with roasted peanuts and cayenne pepper with a jalapeño pepper I had in my fridge. I had no meat so I added fresh corn with the garbanzo and black bean. I served it in a pita bread as mentioned in another review and added tomato and natural yoghourt. It was delicious and will be a definite repeat!

This was a very tasty mix of spices and textures. My sister is a vegetarian so I used vegetable stock and no turkey. I doubled the amount of rice since I didn't use the turkey. Even with the changes, this dish was still great.

Wonderful, easy recipe that makes a lot of food.  Provides a lot of flavor without a lot of time.  Also, once the initial spice purchase is made, it is a very economical meal.  I have made it twice now.  I didn't have turmeric the first time around, it's definitely better with it, but not bad without it either.  I did throw in 1/2 diced onion to saute along with the meat.  Last night, I served it with fresh pita bread and greek style yogurt as an accompaniment.  Definitely a keeper.

I loved this recipe. I made a few changes, such as omitting the onion and black beans, and cutting the amount of meat to one pound, and this still made a ton of food. I use jasmine or basmati rice, and will try it soon with brown basmati. I've made it with ground turkey and with ground beef and the beef has more flavor. However, I'm thinking about omitting the meat entirely and maybe adding some red lentils for some simple rice and beans. The flavoring of the rice is absoloutely delicious. This recipe is good with pita or with some warm naan. DON'T SKIP THE CILANTRO! Definately a keeper, it has all the elements of a meal that fits into my busy life: quick, simple, flavorful, filling, and inexpensive.

The quantity was good and the rice itself turned out decently.  I didn't like the black beans or the chickpeas.

This was really tasty, and I'll definitely make it again but with about half of the cayenne pepper. I think roasted the spices in the beginning really brings them out, and it made this dish SO spicy.

I really, really liked this!  Too much rice for my taste--will cut back on rice and broth next time--but the spice mixture was fabulous!  Hubby loved it too and requested to have it on a regular basis.  Made LOTS...so we've got plenty of leftovers for lunches.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good. I used jasmine rice. I halved the recipe and used 2c of vegetable broth (even though that amount of rice called for 1.5 cups of liquid.) I liked the pine nuts -- it added a nice crunch to the texture of chickpeas, rice and beans. I used grilled chicken instead of ground meat. I also served Chris J's tzatziki sauce in his Chicken Souvlaki Gyro Style recipe on this site (minus the cucumber). I warmed pitas on the grill with the chicken (only a minute or so).

I would have loved to give this recipe 5 stars.  It was really tasty, but it called for way too much water!  I ended up having to drain my rice after I had added all of the seasoning.  I literally drained off about 2 cups of water.  I also added shredded chicken instead of any ground meat.  But it was tasty and different.

i left out the meat all together and the pinenuts (couldn't find any) and it was great. if i ever make this w/meat, i'll only use one can of each type of bean. i also added some red pepper flakes, which gave it more kick!

Very good. Next time I make it, however, I will definitely use less broth and more spice. Think I may add some dried fruits as well -- just a little bit to mix it up.

This recipe needs to be punched up a bit. I added a half of a Vidalia onion and omitted a can each of the beans. Used 2 cans of broth. Also added a half teaspoon of the spices while browning the turkey. After completed it still tasted a bit underwhelming but was very fragrant. I went back and sautéed the other half an onion and two cloves of garlic. These few little adjustments made a big difference so as is three stars after the alteration four stars!

I was looking for a rice and bean side dish and tried this one.   Being a side dish did not add the turkey.  I also did as other reviewers had suggested.  1.  used no salt chicken broth.  2. used only 2 cups as some had suggested the liquid amount was to much.  3.  reduced the amount of the chick peas and black beans to 1 can each.  I only had 19 oz cans and the 1 can was plenty.  4.  reduced the amount of the parsley and cilantro to only about 5 springs of each which was the perfect amount as there was just a small amount of color.

Will be making again.

This is just out of this world yummy.  I actually crave it the next day and it's as least as good if not better the second time around.  I tweak the spices for our taste and always add lots of cilantro just before serving.  It's now become a regular in our home.

We really enjoyed this dish; even my picky youngest who doesn't eat veggies gobbled up  every last bite and asked me to make it again! Fast, easy, and fairly healthy. The only changes I made were to substitute a ground beef/pork blend for the ground turkey, as that's all I had on hand. I did also season the meat while I was sautéing it, as per other reviewer's suggestions. As well, I added another half cup of rice or so just before it was supposed to be done, when I realized that there was too much liquid and it was going to be very soupy. It was a good consistency with the added rice.
I liked the idea of serving this with a yogurt-lemon sauce on the side, as other reviewers suggested. I used what I had on hand which was kefir and lime juice, mixed it with a little garlic salt, and this put the flavours over the top... everyone LOVED it with the sauce! This was a perfect amount for the 4 of us with leftovers for lunch. This is going in the regular roster.  :-)

Tastes good, but only needs half as much meat and beans, in my opinion. It’s also a lot of liquid for the quantity of rice, so the rice is fairly soft. Still liked it overall, but might use a little less broth next time.

very good.  Went with semi-vegetarian by leaving out the ground turkey but added diced dried apricots.  That added the "something extra". Wil make it again for sure! oh, also cut the cayenne in half and it was still plenty spicy.

This is my FAVORITE kind of recipe. As written, it's basic and totally fine, but adding spices to my taste and roasted veggies makes the dish for me. I will use this again and again, with and without meat. Thanks for this one!

Definitely one of my favorite dishes ever! I am heavy handed on spices, so I definitely added extra, and I used chicken pieces that I chopped up. Definitely will be on my rotation. I would probably cut back on the recommended amount of cilantro and parsley, don’t get me wrong, I love both, but the amount recommended was a bit excessive.

I put diced red onion in with the garlic & spices, a can of diced tomatoes with the rice & doubled the spices to put half in with the ground beef (next time I’m going to try it vegetarian with extra veggies).  I halved the recommended spices then put 1/2 the amount in of curry powder essentially using 3 times the spice amount & the flavor was perfect. Served with homemade naan, and topped the mixture with sour cream.

It was great. I like a lot of spice, but I used slightly too much cayenne, so it was just a tad bit hotter than I intended. But it was great and my daughter loved it too.

I didn't have any basmati rice so I used jasmine rice instead - unfortunately it turned into a paste and had that overdone oatmeal texture rather than rice-like texture. I'll try with basmati next time. Otherwise, it was very quick and easy to make and was excellent for a cold day. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this last night. Zero flavor to this dish. I'd suggest tripling the amount of spices if you're going to try this recipe.

Hubby and my 12 year old liked this. Actually my 12 year old had 3 helpings!! lol. I did reduce the cayenne  and sauteed onions to go along with the garlic. I found it a little lack luster though. I ended up adding some extra chicken bullion to build the flavour up a bit. It's good; jut not "I can't wait to make this again" good.

Wonderful dish!  I used one can each of the beans and added spinach and a small onion. ( I am not a cilantro fan.)  I added half of the spices to the rice and the other half to the turkey with a small onion and garlic.  Next time I will add arugula instead of spinach for more flavor.  I followed the instructions for the rice when adding chicken stock, so I did not use the full amount in the recipe.    Very flavorful and has a nice 'bite' to the finish.   This is definitely a favorite.

I would add something to provide more flavoring to the turkey and bean protein combination.  The rice is flavorful but not quite enough to jazz up the rest of the meal.

My family really liked this dish!  Next time I will double the amount of rice.  Otherwise all I changed was to add one onion and to season the turkey as well as the rice.  Overall this was a simple and delicious meal!

The first time I made this recipe I double the spices as per one reviewer's suggestion and found it way too spicy. To remedy this I added dried cranberries (because it was in my cupboard).  Now I follow the recipe as written but add a 1/2 cup of cranberries. I'm glad I made the initial mistake to create this little kick of flavour.

This was alright, but I don't think I'll add to it my regular rotation.  The spices just really don't make me too happy.  I served it with a green salad.

Awesome! Used chicken instead of turkey and about 2 tsp curry instead of coriander and turmeric. Next time, I'm going to cut it in half (the full recipe made probably close to ten servings!) and do half as much cayenne as called for...just a bit too spicy for my taste. But loved it and will make it again!

this was worth 5 stars when i made it EXACTLY according to recipe, but since i've been tripling the garlic & cracking whole
spices minutes b4  i throw them into the sizzling  oil with the 
turkey (just as meaty tasting if u only use 1 lb),  terrific.  7 stars
if i could (so healthy:)

Easy and Good!  The best combo for a fast dinner.   I always like a good recipe using ground turkey.  It does  make up a lot, but, great for leftovers.  I am sure I totally messed up the spices...I think I confused curry for cumin, but, still tasted fine!  Did not use whole bunch of cilantro and parsely...maybe under half.  Oh, and I only added 2.5 cups of chicken broth per other reviewers.  Served in a bowl w/a dallop of plain Greek yogurt!

This is so good! I went a bit light on the chicken broth and used almost 1 1/2 cups of rice (what I had left).  I added a fresh tomato and spinach that needed to be used and forgot all about the cilantro and parsley!  I added a bit of Sriracha in my bowl just for a bit more spice.

Delicious and easy!  My daughter asks me to make this so she can have it for lunch the next day.   I use Better than Bouillon vegetarian soup base for the broth.  Tastier than chicken broth.  And, my kids don't do much spice so I back off on the cayenne.  And, I use only half of the beans.  It makes quite a lot for 4 people.  Highly recommend!

My boyfriend and I enjoyed this recipe. I did not have pine nuts so just sprinkled with sunflower seeds and just had white rice. It was good. I used all the herbs as instructed which  gave it great flavor and some spice. I added carrots, tried it with sour cream and drops of lemon. It's good with or without the sour cream.  Next time will use the pine nuts and rice. Looking forward to making this again.

I sautéed the garlic and rice with 1 tsp curry and 1 tsp cumin before adding the rice. Then after browning the ground turkey (1lb pkg) I sautéed an onion with the meat and another tsp of curry so each layer would have the flavors, as recommended by previous reviewers. Also I only used 1 can of chickpeas and 1 can black bean. And I used dried cilantro and parsley as that's all I had. This was very dry and it definitely requires sour cream or yogurt. With the sour cream  it was pretty tasty but nothing I was in love with. I topped it with a lot of cinnamon which helped make it slightly more complex in flavors but still nothing amazing. My four year old who isn't crazy for curry or cumin liked this but my two year old who normally likes these flavors didn't like it at all. Go figure... Also I separated it and made half with the chilli powder and half without for the kids.

This just didn't go over well with my family. I made it according to the recipe, but added some spinach. After the first taste, my husband said it needed a jolt of something, so I put it all back in the pan and added more spices, even adding some harrissa for heat. We ate it, but it was not a hit.

Everyone loved this -- decreased beans to one can of each and still made plenty for 10 people. Needs salt.

My family liked this recipe.  I only had ground beef, omitted the cayenne and did not have black beans  and it was very good.  Will add black beans the next time!

I used bulgur (healthier then rice) and also beef stroganoff.  I couldn't find my pine nuts in the kitchen so I used sliced almonds instead. Finished meal was delicious but nothing that exciting. Basically you cook rice (bulgur in my case) with spices and add beans+meat. Thats it.
Spices might be doubled for more flavour.  I also added very small chopped onions for some crunchiness, goes well with the parsley and meat.

Loved this recipe!  I left the ground turkey out because I was making grilled chicken.  I also left out the pine nuts because I didn't have any.  I plated the rice and beans with the sliced chicken on top, with a dollop of tzatziki.  Delicious and eazy!

It had great flavor and I kept the liquid the same.  I did remove lid and cook down for a few minutes before adding meat.

Awesome recipe, ended up adding about half a cup of sweet peas and used a lot more spice than suggested. Tasted great with sour cream and a sprinkle of lemon juice.

Made this for dinner tonight. LOVED IT! I skipped the parsley and used vegetable stock rather than chicken because that's what I had. Pretty much followed the directions on everything else. I am looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow. I will definitely make this again and will add carrots and spinach per other reviewers' suggestions.

yes,but I did not have access to chicken broth,coriander,turkey,garbonzo beans or chick peas. I substituted left over porkchops for the meat and substituted white beans instead of chick peas.I did not use any broth or coriander. It was very good without the deleted ingredients. This is one of those recipes that you can add or subtract to make it your own.Good one to keep on hand.

Thank you for sharing this delicious recipe! I made several changes: 3 cups of chicken stock instead of 4.  Left out: turmeric, garbanzo beans, cilantro, and pine nuts.  Added sautéed cubed chicken and onions with black beans.  I also used 2 cups of brown rice one time and 5 grain rice another time. Put finished mixture on whole wheat tortillas w/sour cream, lettuce, and tomatoes. Delicious!

I just made this. It is very good, but way too much turmeric!!! I had to throw out have the rice mixture because of the overwhelming turmeric. With only half of the rice mixture blended in with turkey and beans, it was good. A darn shame I had to do that. But it was very good after eliminating all that turmeric.

I loved it.  I used 2 pounds of ground turkey so I wouldn't have a half package left over.  Subbed brown rice for the kind called for and added the cilantro and parsley. Beware...you need a big pan.  I used my wok and had it full. It is a little spicy and was too spicy for my wife...but I love spicy things but she not so much.  It was very good and I heartily recommend it! Makes plenty!

Great recipe, very tasty - I took a reviewer's advice and eat it with some Greek yogurt, and it's always delicious.  I also cook the turkey in with the rice because I'm lazy and it turns out fine.

Very homely dish. I used about 2 cups of chicken broth for the rice. Can be a great side dish without the turkey.

i made this almost exactly as written except for extra garlic and only one pound ground meat.  as suggested i topped with greek yogurt.  i love it and next time will add some onion.  it is very spicy and dont understand how people could say it is bland.  the recipe makes enough to feed a small army.

Nice recipe! Like some others I left out meat because I didn't have anyon hand, so I reduced the turmeric & cayenne for that reason. Also halved the recipe & added some chopped onion & red bell pepper. Without meat, using 1 can each of chickpeas & black beans was fine with 1/2 cup raw rice. Had no fresh parsley or cilantro so added some dried to the cooking rice, as well as some frozen chopped spinach. I would like to try with ground meat & the fresh green herbs next time.Would also reduce liquid a bit. Very flexible & tasty dish.

DELICIOUS!!  Did as others suggested and added  1/2 onion, 2-3 cups spinach, only 1/4 cup parsley and 1/4 cup cilantro, and seasoned turkey before browning. My family loved it.  Will be a regular weeknight meal....SO QUICK TO MAKE!!

I made this vegetarian since it has two kinds of beans and doesn't need meat. I grate a large carrot and add it with the rice and spices. At the end, I add in 1/2 cup of golden raisins along with the toasted pine nuts and cilantro.

The ratio of water to rice was waaaaay off.  I adjusted for 16 servings for a family meal and tt had me add 8cups of stock to 2 cups of uncooked rice.  Which was a complete fail.  The rice came out way too mushy.  I should've just used common sense and for 2 cups of rice I would have only needed 3.5 c liquid.  MAYBE....4 cups but in trying to follow the recipe I used the 8 and ended up with MUSH!!  Tasty MUSH but MUSH nonetheless.

This is amazing. Being it was my first complete dish ever, I'm very satisfied with the way it tasted and my guests' reviews. But I did do some things differently according to other reviewers' suggestions:
I mixed all the spices together into a bowl and used half in the rice and half when cooking the ground turkey. Only 2.5 cups of broth. I also used half the amount of beans (only one can of black beans and one can of chick peas). And I used only a handful of parsley/cilantro. The pine nuts were my favorite part. I'm not used to eating them and they were a delicious surprise. And it adds a cool texture.
I recommend this dish for anyone. It's a bit on the spicy side (I have so little tolerance) but most of my family really enjoyed it so I suppose it depends on each person's taste.
Yay! Enjoy everyone!

Given how easy this was, it was 5 stars.  I increased the spices every so slightly.  It definitely needs the parsley, though I did not use the pine nuts or cilantro.  Next time I will try cooking a little onion with the turkey.

This was pretty good, although a little on the bland side. We liked it enough to make it again sometime, but I think I will probably tweak it a bit. Maybe I will try seasoning the meat with the spices and that might help. This was a very filling recipe, and made TONS so if you're wanting to feed a bunch of people this would be a good recipe to do that with. My two year old ate it right up, but my five year old kind of picked at it and ended up not eating the chick peas or much of the rice. He seemed to like the turkey and back beans really well. This will be a good recipe to take with me to work for lunches the rest of the week because it is filling, but it won't leave me feeling too overstuffed. Thank you for sharing the recipe with us, JULIEP!

I had such high hopes for this with it's high ratings, but I should have read the reviews first in regards to the amount of chicken stock it calls for. The rice turned out like complete mush, and even after powering through the texture issue the meal was very bland...me nor my husband could eat it. The kids wouldn't even try it.

Fantastic.  Going to make this a regular on the menu.  Entire family loved it, including two teen-age boys. Will reduce the amount of chicken broth, as the rice was more wet than I like.  Excellent flavor.  I didn't measure spices so I might have been on the heavy side with them.  Might add some sautéed onion to it next time and possibly some spinach or chard.  I left out the turkey and nobody missed it.  This is a great recipe as is or to tweek.

A little spicy  Added yogurt on side to cut the zip.  Could reduce the cayenne to 3/4 or 1/2 t and add back as desired.  Good flavor.

Great recipe!  I used curry powder instead of turmeric and cut all the spices in half, as my family does not like spicy food.  I also used one can each of the beans and chicken broth.

Thanks for the wonderful recipe...I reduced it down to serve 5 and still had leftovers! Reducing the broth to 2 cups for 1/2 cup rice.  Subbed curry seasoning for corriander and tumeric but kept recommended cayenne and cumin for the rice. I followed several suggestions about seasoning the turkey while browning with the following:
1/2 tsp curry seasoning
1/4 tsp cumin
1/4 tsp cayenne
Sea salt and pepper

Turkey was seasoned well but will add a bit more sea salt next time.  

Also, whipped up a quick tatziki with Greek yogurt, mint and garlic to top.

Yummy dish - my family has asked that I make once a week!

I loved this dish. I made 1/2 and it came out great.  I liked the spices so I used the same amout of spice as I would have for the full dish.

This is good. I've made my own version several times too. I either use chicken or go vegetarian. I also have used it with and without the black beans and it's good either way. I've added candied ginger, green onions and dried apricots before. Serve with a cucumber mint yogurt sauce and grilled flat bread and it's outta this world!

I have made this several times now and it is always a hit. I've ommitted the optional ingredients, and instead garnish the dish with scallions / green onion and basil.

Either you have an iron stomach or my cayenne isn't like your cayenne... but I only used 1/4 tsp and it was WELL ENOUGH.  Apart from that, I only used 3 cups chicken stock, no ground turkey, and replaced the black beans with 19 oz of kidney beans since I didn't have anything else on hand.  I omitted all the optional ingredients.  It was surprisingly good for the simplicity of the recipe, and next time I'll add some chicken, cauliflower, raisins and whatever else I might find (:  Thank you.

Very very delicious!  I used much less broth and it came out perfect!  Also, I only used one can of each of the beans.

Excellent recipe--I've made it twice now. My only modifications include browning the turkey in some salt and spices (as others suggested), simmering the turkey in the rice/broth mixture for a few minutes before adding the beans, and doubling all the spices except the cayenne pepper. It's very simple and nutritious, but also really delicious. It's great to pack and eat cold for lunch the next day!

I had to rate this 4 because of the alterations I made.  I just used curry powder, because that's all I had and needed.  One can of black beans and one can of garbanzo beans is enough for this recipe.  Any more, and all you taste is beans not rice. I used two cans of chicken stock and just added water as needed.  Makes a great meal for lunch and dinner.

WOW!!  This knocked our socks off!!  I normally do not review recipes that I make substitutions to, but this was so good!!  I did not have turkey - so I left the meat out completely and I only had one can of black beans.  I did not have any yogurt so I did not use that either.  Even with these subtractions, this was a great dish - especially if you like spicy food.  I can't wait to make it as written.  Thanks for posting.

Wow!  This was so good, my kids are from Haiti and they totally loved this dish!  I just added 1 more cup of rice to compensate for the plenty chicken broth.  Also substituted the hot madras curry powder for the coriander, etc like someone else suggested - awesome!  I will definately be making this over and over again.

I made this with bacon, drained off the fat and just used the residual grease in the pan to saute the rice. I also only included one can of beans each.  Two would have been overkill. Delish!  Even our toddler liked it!
