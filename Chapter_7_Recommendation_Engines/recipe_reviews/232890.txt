Made this recipe last weekend. Got part way through before I realized it called for an ice cream machine. I put it in a cake pan and threw it in the freezer, stirring it every half hour to 45 minutes for a few hours. Had it with apple crisp. Delicious!

The flavors were awesome. I didn't have apple pie spice so I used the allrecipe one on this site for it and added about a pinch of each ingredient as well as a bit of ground ginger. I previously made the peanut butter cup ice cream recipe on this site and I found that the condensed milk in it made it too syrupy and sweet so I only used half of what this recipe called for and used whole milk as the substitution. I also let the batter just chill in the refrigerator over night before making it.

The taste of the ice cream was awesome. The apple chunks were a weird texture to me though. I made smallish pieces and I actually wonder if I would like the pieces larger. I don't think there is anything wrong with the recipe though. I just need to find what size I want the apples.

I really liked this recipe. But I think if I am to make it again I would make the apple pieces smaller. My son thought it was chunks of ice! and If you do not have an ice cream machine...I do not.. Whip the whipping cream to stiff peaks then add the condensed milk. Then add the apple mixture after it cools. Fold it in. spread in a pan and freeze works so much better! The flavor was awesome!
