Yummy! I wanted this to be an appetizer so I put the recipe into mini muffin pans. It only took about 20 min. to cook this way, they were good as the recipe states-but better for our family with green chilis or jalapanos and cheese added. Beautiful appetizer at Thanksgiving! Thanks!

Made this as a side for the "Bacon Mushroom Swiss Meatloaf" recipe on this site. Very, very good. I took a few liberties with the recipe based on our tastes - I think we might have found it a bit bland otherwise. Adjusted the recipe to make a 9 x 13 casserole and tossed in shredded sharp cheddar, garlic powder and crushed red pepper flakes. Turned out great!

I wanted to use up cottage cheese so I made this recipe. I even made corn bread mix from scratch. I didn't have any broccoli so I made it with cauliflower. I put red onion in stead of sweet onion and butter (unsalted) in stead of margarine. It browned in less than 40 min in my oven. Tasted great!

This bread is great served cold, straight from the fridge, which makes it perfect for breakfast on the go.

Very good bread--if a little sweet for me.  I used half margarine, half butter and omitted the salt.  I also used a full 12oz package of frozen broccoli.  I think it would also be good with some garlic powder for an extra little oomph, and to tone down the sweetness.  Thanks!

Made this for a friend and her family, going through a rough time. They absolutely adored this!!! My teenage Daughter, who hates cornbread, like her Father, even loved this!!! It's a keeper!!! It's SO moist!

Excellent side dish. Very addicting! I use a different recipe, same ingredients but mine says to melt the butter in the pan and then add the corn bread/ onion/broccoli mixture without mixing in the butter. Creates a nice crust...so yummy!

Yum! This was a nice new side dish for us! I added some garlic powder, but no other changes were made.  Will be making this one again!

Absolutely delicious just as written.  I made this last night for dinner and my husband just sat down and polished off the leftovers tonight straight out of the baking pan.

This was delicious but a little soft. When I cut a piece it practically fell apart before I could place it on the plate. But the taste was great.

I thought it would taste too much like broccoli (which is not my favorite) but all of the flavors merged together to make a delicious corn bread quiche-like dish. It is super easy to make. I used 1 broccoli crown in place of the frozen broccoli (2.5 cups).

Wow! I was not sure how this would turn out, but it was great. Made exactly as the recipe stated. (One should never rate a recipe if changes were made.)

Oh gosh!  This cornbread is sooo good!!  I made a loaf of this cornbread for my volunteer team and it was gone in less than an hour!  I barely got a piece for myself.  It's quick, inexpensive, nutritious (minus the butter ha ha), and very delicious. You can't ask for more than that!  I will be making this again soon. Thanks for posting such wonderful recipes!

Quite delish!! Only thing I changed, substituted 1 teaspoon of garlic salt for regular salt and added sharp cheddar cheese. Sooo easy to prepare and smelled wonderful while cooking. I might try parmesian as well next time. Thanks for an easy delicious recipe!!

Yummy yummy, I used chopped spinach instead of the chopped broccoli because that is what I had on hand and it turned out very good.  I will certainly make it again and again. -CJ from Cincy
