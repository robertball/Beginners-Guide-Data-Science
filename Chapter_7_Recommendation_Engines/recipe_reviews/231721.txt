Thank you for a delicious and versatile recipe. I did make some changes to suit our tastes. I used 1 cup of regular long grain rice. I sauteed it in 3 tbsps butter until lightly toasted and then added 2 cups water. Brought that to a boil; reduced heat; covered and let simmer for 15 mins until water was absorbed. I then added salt to taste and 1 tbsp chopped fresh parsley. While the rice was simmering, I browned the meat. I halved the recipe because I was only feeding 2. I used 1/2 lb Johnsonville Sweet Italian Sausage. Browned that and then added 1/2 of a chopped onion with 1 teaspoon of minced garlic. Finished cooking the meat with the veges and then added the chopped tomato pulp and some salt to taste. Scraped all the bits off the bottom of the pan and gave it a taste. I added a tbsp of chopped fresh basil and I omitted the tomato sauce. It was juicy enough for me with the tomato pulp and everything tasted so fresh and yummy. I added 2 cups rice and stirred it all together and then filled the tomatoes. I only used 4 tomatoes. Cooked for 20 mins and then topped each tomato with a slice of asiago cheese. Melted the cheese and served with the rest of the rice. It was absolutely delicious. I ate one and my husband ate 3!! and he finished off the leftover filling!! Definitely a keeper. I will make this whenever I can find good tomatoes on sale. Thanks so much!

Loved, loved, loved this recipe.  Must say that I substituted Johnsonville All Natural Ground Italian Sausage for the ground beef.  I think that the flavor of the sausage really went well with the rest of the ingredients in this recipe.  My DH said that it was better than one of his favorite meals Stuffed Bell Peppers.  Will be using this recipe often.

this was super easy!  being from Wisconsin i added shredded cheddar to the rice mixture and some chopped green peppers and celery.  i also cheated and use bottled spaghetti sauce instead of plain old tomato sauce.  added more cheese to the tops 5 minutes before taking out from oven!

A pleasant dish and easy to prepare. Another time I would adjust the seasonings to give it more pop.

I followed most of the directions, except I added a few things.  I used a few more tomatoes, added Basil, a cube of Monterey Jack cheese on top of the stuffing, and I put the tomato filling and ground beef in  my food processor. It turned out great!  Next time I'm gonna add mushroom bits, and

Added some cheese at the bottom and on top of the mixture. There was about enough mixture for about 16 tomatoes. Otherwise pretty good.

While others made several changes to the recipe, I actually followed the recipe. There was way too much liquid so I could have filled up 14 tomatoes and still had liquid left over. I'm not sure if the original recipe is incorrect or what the problem was. I guess I did add some extra mince garlic since  it didn't seem to have a lot of flavor. It was very good I just had too much of it. Tonight I am making a taco soup with my leftover stuffed tomatoes as well as the excess ground beef rice mixture!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight.  I followed the recipe as written with a very small addition.  When cooking the stuffing for the tomatoes, I added a pinch of cyan pepper and a pinch of cinnamon.

Only problem I had was I found out my son-in-law and grandson don’t like cooked whole tomatoes.  What kind of Italians are they?

They ate the stuffing while I enjoyed the tomatoes and the stuffing.
I recommend this recipe.  It tasted just like the stuffed tomatoes my wife used to make.

They will even taste better tomorrow.

I doubled the rice, added cheese, and added a ton of leftover veg from my fridge (carrots, pepper, cukes) and served with a side of spagetti squash. It was delicious! PS you will need more tomatoes.

This is my first time having Stuffed Tomatoes but it definitely will not be my last! YUMMM!!! I did tweek the recipe as it seemed a bit too juicy for me. I halved the recipe but used a mixture of beef and sausage. I didn't use any extra juice or even the sauce as the reserved tomato pulp was more than enough. I also added some Italian spice blend and plenty of mozzarella cheese. Even halving the recipe I had some stuffing left over so I just plopped it in the pan in the middle of the tomatoes and it helped stabilize them further during cooking. In the future I think adding some mushrooms would be awesome and even some diced jalapeño pepper. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!!

I made this recipe...strained tomatoes and used only a little pulp and 1 can tomato juice...cut sides of tomatoes on 4 sides to open more to fit more filling.  Used shredded mozzarella cheese and sprinkled adagio cheese on top.  Did not use tomato tops...I used jasmine rice to mix with filling instead of instant.

This is a great recipe. The only thing I did different is add cheese to it since I love cheese on everything. Very tasty and easy to make.

Great Recipe! I did a couple things different...I used leftover shredded beef from a pot roast with onions. (it had the garlic flavor in the roast.) I did not use the tomato sauce...just used the homegrown tomato juices and meats from the center of the tomato and followed the directions from there. I had cooked rice already so I mixed the shredded beef, tomato and juices together and any other ingredients and put right into the tomato. Cooked as directed and it came out perfect. I will be making this again. Thanks for the recipe!
