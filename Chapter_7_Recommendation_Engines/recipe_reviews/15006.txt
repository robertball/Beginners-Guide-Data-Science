Mmmmmm! This recipe is excellent. I roasted my own peppers (To do this, place pepper directly on the burner over a medium flame until skin is blackened on all sides, toss in ice water, remove skin, and voila! roasted red pepper) Soooo good! and much cheaper than store bought.

I am not a big fan of hummus but this recipe was great! I made this for my boyfriend who loves hummus, this was the best he ever had.  I liked it because of the easiness and quickness - everything goes into the blender!  I also liked the flavor that the roasted red pepers gave.  The only hard part was finding the tahini at the grocery store.  I was lucky to find someone who knew what tahini was.  Prior to this recipe I did not know what it was.  It is (if you don't know) ground sesame seeds.  It is paste-like and comes in a jar.

This is my favorite hummus recipe.  It's easy to make, very inexpensive and I can adjust the garlic and cayenne pepper to suit my taste (I like a lot of both).  I have this on hand all the time as a treat for me!  It's not as high fat/high calorie as some other hummus recipes.  The color is really pretty too.

We loved it. The roasted red peppers made the hummus such a pretty color, and added another dimension of flavor. The only thing I did differently was to add in some light olive oil as I was blending in the proccesor. (Made the mixture smoother, and it came together better.) Thanks.

Delicious! I tweaked it a little to suit our tastes, cutting the cayenne to 1/4 teaspoon and adding 1 tablespoon of olive oil. I also pureed it a little longer to make the hummus extra light & fluffy. Thnaks for the great recipe!

This turned out so good! It was way better then store bought and cheaper!!!  I went to the store to buy tahini (i have never bought or used before) and the stuff is expensive and only comes in fairly large amounts...so i decided to make my own since all it is is sesame seed paste.  To make, slow cook sesame seeds for 15min @ 300. make sure the don't brown.  I did 1/4 cup seeds. the ratio is 1 part oil to 4 parts seeds.  Place seeds in food processor with 1/2 the oil and pulse until mixed then add the rest of oil and chop/pulse until it forms a paste. When I first mixed all my ingredients together I though the tahini overpowered the recipe but once it chilled for about an hour it was PERFECT!!!  I will make this all the time!!

Oh man! Loved loved this!! I doubled the recipe for my family and they thought it was the best they ever tasted. I also added a lil more garlic and a TB of EVOO. I also used cilantro instead of parsley, made for  unique change and tasted soo fresh.
Will definitely make for a long time!

Disclaimer: Not a big fan of hummus. Did this according to recipe except used half the cayenne recommended and it's plenty hot.  Otherwise it tastes pretty bland.  I used the Hummus III recipe last time and added cumin, roasted pepper, and red pepper flakes and I think I like that one better.

This recipe is delicious as is, but I added extra Cumin and Cayenne Pepper and a bit extra red peppers.  If you don't have Tahini, it is very easy to make it.  Just lightly toast 1/4 cup of sesame seeds in a 350 degree oven for about 5-10 minutes, but do not brown them.  Let cool, and then put them in a food processor with about 1 Tablespoon of EVOO, until the Tahini is paste-like.  Top the humus with some chopped up roasted red peppers.  Very delicious.

FANTASTIC! I did roast the red pepper myself, because I couldn't find any jarred ones at the store. [Method: I cut off the stem of one red pepper, then cut it in half, cut out the ribs and smashed it as flat as I could. I put it under the broiler on a piece of foil for about 7 minutes (your mileage may vary). Once it was nicely blackened, I took it out and put it in a ziplock baggie for about 15 minutes to steam. When I took it out, the skin peeled off very easily.] I also added a small amount of oil -- maybe 1 tablespoon -- to help thin it out a bit, as it was VERY thick.

I merged this recipe with "Hummus III" and it was fantastic! Basically, the changes made were to increase the tahini to 3 Tbls., add 2 tsp. olive oil, and increase salt to 1/2 tsp. Awesome!

Loved the hummus with the roasted red peppers!  I cut back a bit on the cayenne pepper but the lemon juice really hit the spot!  To make the tahini from scratch I put 1 cup olive oil to 1 cup roasted sesame seeds (they were in bulk at the store), blend that, then put in the chick peas (with the liquid), 2 garlic cloves not minced, and the rest... made TONS and cut up veggies which was a huge hit! Defintely make this again!!

I've made this hummus over and over again, it's my goto recipe for snacks or meals. Flavor is outstanding too. I find roasting my own peppers to be cheaper and provide a far more superior flavor. I also make my own tahini, which can be costly if premade. Not hard to do if you have a food processor or blender.

Yum!  I made a double batch, following the recipe except for incorporating these suggestions from other reviewers:  I used one whole red pepper that I roasted and instead of adding back some of the liquid from the canned beans I added olive oil (about 2T. for the double batch).  The olive oil really gives it a smoothness that you don't get otherwise.  Thanks for sharing!

Holy smokes this recipe is soooo good!  I am a huge hummus fan, and recently my teenage daughter has become addicted to it as well.  As chickpeas are a superfood, I always kept some in the fridge.  Then I thought I could make my own for much cheaper and after I had cooled it in the fridge for half a day, I tasted it and almost fell over, it was so good!  I have Celiac Diasease so we eat it with Lentil Chips, GF pretzels, and rice crackers.  Thank you for the recipe.  Unfortunately my husband can't work through the texture, and he eats everything.

I made this for a party, along with Hummus III and this was the more popular of the two.  I rolled the chickpeas between moistened paper towels to remove most of the thin "shells" on the canned chickpeas.  I'd read that helps the consistency and taste.  It was a bit tedious, but worth it, IMO.  Other than that, I prepared the recipe as written and would not change a thing in the future.  It is now in my recipe rotation so I will definitely be making this again and again.

Super recipe.  I roasted my own pepper (an orange one) and also toasted a tablespoon of sesame seeds and crushed them up with my mortar and pestle, and added a bit of olive oil to make it a paste, since I don't have any tahini.  Cut down on the cayenne and left out the parsley, and added some more olive oil and a Tbs of water while I was blending to help it come together.  Topped it with a bit of chopped roasted pepper I had reserved.  Love it.

Much better than store bought! I Omitted the cayanne pepper and the fresh parsley as I didn't have any on hand. I also used garlic paste rather than minced garlic. I added in 1 tbsp of EVOO to give it a more creamy texture. Paired with toasted pita wedges and cucumber slices this made an awesome entertaining starter. I do recommend using an emulsion blender for this. Gets rid of all the lumps.

First of all, I'd like to say that roasting your own red pepper is NOT easy and NOT a good idea. After seeing Jenny's review, where the directions were given to roast your own red pepper directly over the stove burner, I decided to save money and do it myself! I put my pepper on a fork and started roasting.However, as the pepper got softer, it started to slip off the fork, and fall directly into the flame. To top that off, drips of pepper juice kept oozing out of the pepper and landing on my stove, creating not only a big mess, but lots of sparks. I wasn't sure how long to roast it, so after it started to get limp, I put it into the ice water as directed. NOT a good idea...only tiny bits of burnt skin flaked off, and got stuck to the ice cubes and my hands. Figuring the pepper wasn't fully roasted yet, I grabbed my fork and started roasting again. It was worse this time, as more juice kept dripping off. I tried the ice water again, and the skin still didn't come off. I finally threw the  thing into a hot skillet, and cooked it for a while. After a third ice bath, my mutilated pepper lost most of its skin. Next time, I will just buy them from the store. If anyone has a foolproof method for roasting red peppers, you can find me over on the Recipe Exchange. Oh, yes, the hummus was super simple, and super delicious as well!

Delicious! I roasted my own red pepper to save some money and had to sub tahini for some peanut butter...I was able to find tahini but it was larger than the average jar or pb and not knowing the taste I didn't want to risk 7 dollars and have to throw it away just using 1 1/2 tbl worth. Will be making this often...if I can find a small jar of tahini i'll try that but until then the pb will work just fine. *UPDATE* Invested in the large jar of tahini because peanut butter just doesn't compare. If you are new try it with the pb but the flavor is better with tahini. My kids love this stuff and I love it with veggies or in place of mayo on a sandwich.

If I could kiss you, I would. This is the recipe I have been searching for!!  There is a national brand that makes a 'fourty spice' hummus. I have been trying to find something that tastes like it and THIS is it. (It looks like it too.)  I used a little less of the hot stuff, and used roasted garlic.  It is perfect. Wow, the money I will save, and there is nothing unhealthy in it either. Thank you so very much!!!
***Been making this for years! Simply the easiest thing to make. I don't dice anything...just plop it all in the food processor and let it spin. I do add olive oil and when I have fresh cilantro I use that in place of the parsley and that is amazing. I also add a bit more cumin and garlic, but that is personal preference.

I thought this recipe was AMAZING! I added one more tablespoon of lemon juice, one tablespoons of olive oil, and doubled the spices. I also added about 1/2 tsp. black pepper. I served it with pita bread. It was SO GOOD! Even my brother who won't eat hummus because it reminds him of paste liked it! It takes about 2 minutes to prepare. Definitelly a keeper.

Very good, better with fresh roasted red pepper... roast on the stove, then wrap in paper towels till cool and peel off charred skin, never rinse, you lose so much flavor.  I also added some extra virgin, about a tablespoon... very good...

This was very yummy!  I took it to a church function and everyone raved.  Perfect seasonings.  I made my own tahini too which was worth it.  Now that I can make tahini I am hooked on hummus.

I used the regular hummus recipe on this site and tried this for a change...very tasty. Although I made half of it regular and the other half with roasted red peppers. Yum. A little tip if you dont use up all your roasted peppers in the jar. You can place them on a cookie sheet individually, freeze them and put in a zip lok bag for a later use.

Tastes great. Tahini is hard to find, especially in the middle of the night when ethnic markets are closed and 24-hour grocery stores don't generally carry it (generally when I would crave something like this)..   As a substitute for tahini I blended 1/2 tablespoon of toasted sesame seeds in a food processor for ~15seconds, and added a tablespoon of natural peanut butter (i used Adams 100% natural peanut butter), and a drizzle of sesame seed oil if you can find it (i found all 3 of these ingredients at wal-mart), then I put in the rest of the ingredients listed on the recipe and processed. Turned out awesome.   Roasting your own peppers is also better, just roast directly over stove top flame or grill until evenly charred all over.   Mm mm delicious!

Oh so good! I doubled this and followed the recipe. I made my own pita chips and also served vegetables. I had made it for an appy at a dinner I was having. A couple of friends stopped by and put a serious dent in it so I made another double batch. Nice and spicy without going overboard. Thank you!

I really enjoy this hummus and so do my friends.  It’s a staple in my house now as I always have the ingredients on hand.  Here’s a little tip, keep cans of garbanzo beans and jars of roasted red peppers in your refrigerator.  Then when friends drop by unexpectedly, throw this together in seconds and you don’t have to worry about the chilling time.

Really good!  I substituted a whole roasted red pepper and a combo of almond butter and crunchy peanut butter for the tahini.  I also added olive oil to make it creamier.

This hummus came out great...I love the flavor! The only thing I would recommend is that you drain the roasted red peppers....it didn't specify, so I didn't drain them. The hummus came out a little too runny for my liking. Guess I will just keep in mind for next time.

Fantastic!  I have made the other hi-rated Roasted Red Pepper Hummus on this site, and this is FAR superior.  I was looking for a replacement to the Trader Joe's version that they no longer sell, and this was exactly it.  I love it!  Oh, I did add a tablespoon of oil to get the consistency that I wanted, but that is my only modification.  I've made it twice now, and it's about 1 juiced lemon and one big scoop of tahini... that makes it even easier.  Thanks!

Made this and brought it to my friends graduation party.  people loved the spicy flavor.  will definitely be making this one again.  I liked that you can't taste the tahini because I don't particularly care for that flavor.

This is delicious! I was sick of paying so much for store-bought hummus and knew I could make it for a lot cheaper (and healthier), and indeed, this recipe is a lot lighter than most prepared hummuses. I left out the cayenne pepper and parsley simply because I didn't have any on hand and it still turned out great!

Almost prefect!  We used a little more red pepper than mentioned, and the flavor was wonderful!  Brought to a family dinner and got lots of compliments and people who have never had hummus before LOVED it!

Got rave reviews from my coworkers. Use sesame oil in place of the tahini.  Oh and don't be afraid of the cayenne pepper. It isn't really that hot. Excellent recipe!

This recipe is a delicious alternative to regular hummus; the spicy and sweet flavors are perfect. Like any hummus recipe it's easy to tweak to your personal preference (more sour, more spicy, etc.). Sometimes I use roasted garlic for even more flavor. I literally licked the inside of the blender when I first made this, it was so good! :)

A new staple for hummus!  I ground sesame seeds and oil for the tahini (much cheaper and not a lot of work) and also ground toasted cumin seeds.

Easy and excellent.  Adding the red peppers gives this a pretty color.  We ate it with toasted pitas and as a dip for pretzels.

This was very good. I had never tried hummus so I have nothing to compare it to. Very nice red pepper flavor with just the right amount of kick from the cayenne. It was kind of grainy so I wonder if I didn't process it enough.

This is now a staple in our home! Delicious!!  Trying to watch our calories, we put 1-2 tablespoons on a rice cake for a snack or as part of a light lunch.  Sugar snap peas dipped in this hummus are an excellent and tasty snack!  I do roast the red peppers in the oven by coating them with oil and broiling.  I sometimes roast several, peel, deseed and freeze them so the hummus takes just minutes to make.  I also add a tablespoon of olive oil and decrease the lemon juice by 1 tablespoon.

Made this for at-work party and people just LOVED it!  This is tasty and a nice change for those of us that eat "plain" hummus on a regular basis.  I used lime juice instead of lemon the last time I made it and I think it came out even better...give it a try!

This is delicious, healthy, & SO easy to make!  I didn't have any tahini on hand, so I just omitted it, and it tastes just fine without it.  I will be dipping into it for lunch this week with whole wheat pita bread, carrots, celery and green onions.  Thank you!

I roasted my own peppers which were delicious. The flavor was better the longer it sat. The only problem with this recipe is the nutrition facts are wrong. I used Spark recipes calculator and it came out to 94 calories per serving. Still not bad, just a big difference if you're watching your weight.

1/2 teaspoon of cayenne may be a bit too much for some.  Try half of the amount... you can always add more.

Yum. I roasted a red pepper over the stove instead of using jarred. And I used 3 Tbsp. sesame seeds instead of the tahini. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. It's delicious.

I thought this was great (although while it was mixing a Persian friend said it smelled like chili dogs, which I dont think was a compliment).  I put the garbanzo beans in my Kitchenaid mixer on speed 2 until they started to break apart, and then i cranked it up and dumped all of the other ingredients in.  I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dry; I didn't bother to measure the lemon juice, just squeezed two juicy lemons in - turned out fine.  This is a keeper for me!

I liked this much better than regular hummus. It has a lot more flavor. I had to add more salt, though, it was kind of bland to begin with. I also made my own roasted red peppers and I couldn't find any tahini paste (small town...). I added some fresh cilantro and served with tortilla chips. Yum!

At Easter I made this for my vegetarian friends for the most part, because they always seem to come out on the short end since they don't eat meat.  But EVERYONE scooped this up (I served it with pita points) and there were no leftovers.  I put in a bit more red pepper because I do like a "bite" to my dips ... my guests couldn't get enough of it!

absolutely delish!  What little bit was left was sent home w/my neighbor.  I use packaged dry beans and keep them in the freezer after I cook them.  I measured out 12 oz. cooked since they usually are a little dryer than canned when making hummus.  I added just more juice from the jar of roasted peppers, a little EVOO, and added a little bit more roasted pepper.  upped the garlic to 1 clove raw and 2 cloves roasted to give 2 levels of garlic flavor.  Even my DH who does not like hummus, loved this!  It is also made more eye-appealing by the color.  Served w/pita triangles and garnished w/lemon slices and drizzle of EVOO. thank you for this wonderful recipe.  This will become a staple at parties and get-togethers.

This recipe is delicious!  The best hummus I have ever tried.  I served it for a lunch party for my inlaws and everyone loved it!  I prepared it exactly as is, and served it with flat bread cut into triangles and warmed up in the toaster oven.  I highly recommend this recipe!!

This was an incredible hummus recipe!!! I had to tweak the recipe a touch though in order to reach my acquired taste. In order to get the spice to sweet ratio that I am acquired to, I had to add a touch extra cayenne pepper. For one of the attempts that I had, I added some hot sauce and that added an extra kick with some nice flavor. Overall this was an excellent hummus recipe and it comes highly recommended by me.

I made this recipe at my dinner party and all my guest loved it even those who said they had never tasted or liked hummus before. I used fresh chickpeas, chili powder instead of cayenne pepper, and olive oil to replace the tahini because that was what I had in my pantry.

I have made this recipe often by whizzing it up in my food processor.  The addition of four ounces of crumbled feta cheese elevates the flavors immensely.  I usually toast pita bread that I split, brush with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and Parmesan, however this spread is great with crackers or flat bread.

Having only eaten hummus once before, I didn't really know what to expect when I made this, but boy am I glad I did!!  This stuff was excellent!  My husband had never tried it before, and was floored when he tried it.  I did add some olive oil when processing it, but this had such good flavor, and really, you can eat it with anything, and we did.  I made a yeastless pizza with it, used it for the sauce, topped it with peppers and mushrooms, and couldn't eat it fast enough.  Thanks for a great recipe, that'll be made repeatedly.

Very good recipe.  Used a homemade version of Tahini Paste instead of the expensive Tahini you buy at the store.  Served with AR's Garlic Pita Bread Bites.

This is my favorite hummus recipe.  To kick it up a notch we use approximately 1 1/2 tbsp chipotle peppers in adobo sauce instead of the roasted red peppers and we add an extra clove of garlic because we LOVE garlic.  :)

I roast my red peppers at 450 for 30 min, turning once and peeling the skins off.  I triple this recipe for a typical dry 1 pound bag of garbanzo beans.  After soaking and first boil I change the water and retain that water to add back into the mix if it's a little dry.  A couple of tablespoons of olive oil help to make it smooth.  Love it.

It is delicious but I must have made way more than the recipe calls for.  I added and roasted the garbanzo beans and garlic.  Then mixed it all with all the red peppers and olive oil.  Juice from 1 1/2 lemons salt/red pepper flakes, cumin and a fair amount more of olive oil.  After all of that, it is scrumptious.  Thank you for a great recipe.

OMG! I finally found a recipe for hummus that I absolutely love. I doubled the recipe. I love Trader Joe's 3-Layer Hummus dip (especially the spicy layer) and can eat the whole container in one sitting. I needed to find a recipe in which I could make it by the pail (not some small little container) -- I think I found it. I could eat this for every meal of the day. Thank you for sharing! I would give you 10 stars but the max is 5. ;-)

This is SO much better than what you buy in the grocery store, and very easy to make!  I made this the first time as the recipe states, and the second time, I doubled the tahini, just because I love it.  Great recipe!  I've recommended it several times.  Thanks!

Pretty good, but I think it needs a little something else to perk up the flavor a bit. Next time I would probably increase the salt and lemon juice. I had to add quite a bit of olive oil to get it to a smooth consistency. I roasted my own pepper using the Easy Roasted Peppers recipe on this site, which was easy and I would recommend.

FULL of excellent flavor with a hint of heat.  If you want less heat, or none at all, reduce or eliminate the cayenne.  I did use salt substitute to reduce the sodium, but this is a great recipe.

Made this recipe as written.  Really very easy and very very good.  It does have a little kick.  So if you dont want that, use less of the cayenne.  I am going to add just a little more garlic next time.  I went to a local Indian store for the tahini (tahina) paste.  This is a liquidy past made from sesame seeds.  I also picked up Naan (a great Indian bread).  In all it took me about 5-10 minutes to process and serve since I had all the ingredients out.  Coworkers loved it!

I loved it! I didn't have a jar of red peppers so I used the dried ones that I had from the produce section. I used a frozen ice cube of lime juice b/c no lemon and used tahini, garlic and salt. It was great. My 18motnh old couldn't get enough of it. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

This was the first time I made hummus, and it turned out well!  I was in a hurry and just guessed on the measurements, but it didn't seem to make a difference.  Love the sweet spicy taste.  The color was more orange-y than I anticipated, and the tahini was hard to find, but I just googled specialty food shops in my area and found one close by.  Great recipe!

We sampled this hummus while on vacation and loved it.  However, we didn't like the $8.99 price tag on the Robert Rothschild brand.  This was so easy to duplicate and simple to prepare.  I also made my own tahini (roasted some sesame seeds and put them in the food processer along with olive oil) very easy!

Great recipe!  I cut the cayenne back to 1/4 (for a double recipe) and that was just the right amount of "background kick" I needed.

I made this for my wife, who is new to hummus.  She pretty much moaned and groaned (in a good way) the entire time she was eating it. Only half of it made it to the fridge for chilling. I have added this one to my box of tricks for sure.

I think this could use a wee bit of olive oil to round it out.  That being said, this was delicious and we had no leftovers.

I make a hummus almost every weekend for my husband to snack on. So far this one has looked and smelled the nicest to me. He said to give it 5 stars, and when I asked if he had anything to say about this recipe, he replied, "It's tasty." :=)

So good!  I made the recipe as directed, except for two small changes: (1) I cut the amount of cayenne in half, as I was afraid it would be too hot (incidentally, I probably could've added the whole amount, but if I was making this for a party, I'd only use half); and (2) I reserved some of the liquid from the beans and added a couple tablespoons to the mixture, which helped incorporate the ingredients better.  Thanks for sharing!

There are about as many recipes for hummus as there are people to eat it, but unfortunately this wasn't one of my favorites. I followed the recipe exactly, and I thought it tasted like bean dip (I know, technically hummus IS bean dip); it's too heavy on the cumin for me. I ended up adding another clove and a half of garlic. This wasn't bad at all; it just wasn't as good as other recipes I've used. Thanks, anyway.

Awesome hummus recipe! Definitely the best I've ever had. The only thing I did different was I used about 7 cloves of garlic (I LOVE garlic!) and a little more lemon juice and spices than called for. Also, this recipe really needs to be refrigerated to taste its best, but I was impatient and ate right out of the blender, and it was still delicious!

This is quick, easy and delicious. Update: I made this for the second time today and took it to a whole new level.  I add about 1/2 small jar of sun dried tomatoes, 2 garlic cloves, and 1/2 of lemon freshly squeezed.  I will admit it is a little garlic and citrus-y but it you'll love it!

This is an awesome recipe.  I thought I didn't like hummus until I tried this recipe.    I have made it over a dozen times since trying it.  Each time I just like it even more.  I have made this without the cayenne pepper for my Mother-in-law and it is still delicious. In fact, she has requested that I make it for her often!

This is an excellent hummus recipe!  Taste great with pita chips.  If you haven't purchased tahini before, I found it in the peanut butter section of the grocery store.

I just whipped this up and it's awesome! So easy! The tahini I found at my local grocery was salted, so I left out the salt and it's perfect. Just a warning - it's got some kick. I love it, but just hope my guests feel the same way. :)

I couldnt get the hummus to be whipped enough and didnt want to use more tahini (because of the added calories) so I added a couple tablespoons of broth so that my blender would make it smooth. I added more salt and pepper because it seemed a little bland.

This was good, but not the best I've ever had. I did only use half the cayenne & eliminated the tahini. I knew from experience that I wouldn't miss the tahini.

This is the ONLY hummus recipe you will need. It tastes even better than the hummus that you buy at the supermarket in an 8 oz yellow container at a fraction of its price. 

I use a fresh red pepper and it's much cheaper. I grill it right on my toaster oven rack and then peel off the skin and chop it up a little before adding it in. I like it a little chunky, so I usually add the pepper last and I only chop it a little more in the food processor.

Made a double batch based on reviews. Also included basil from one of the other recipes. Seemed good up until I added the cayenne which made it come out so hot it was almost inedible. 2 stars. Perhaps almost no cayenne and some olive oil.

This has become a staple for me that I make all the time.  I triple the recipe, mix in a food processor, and store in multiple small tupperware containers (freezing when necessary to preserve).  I add roasted jalapenos to give it a bit more kick, and mix in cilantro instead of parsley.  Sometimes I throw in dashes of soy sauce and/or Worchestershire.  It's a bit different each time, but I love it each time.

Excellent! I used roasted red and yellow peppers from Trader Joe's, added a little bit more garlic (for my taste). The only thing I will change when I make it again, is to add some of the juice from the garbonza beans to smooth it out. Ate this for breakfast and lunch w/ Soy and Flaxseed tortilla chips from Trader Joe's! Thanks for such a great recipe!!!

This was pretty good - I liked the slight sweet taste of this hummus. I didn't have a jar of roasted red peppers so I roasted my own by broiling them until they were quite blistered.

This is perfect, don't change anything...that is, if you like spicy foods. This leaves a little heat on your tongue. I've tried to make hummus a few times, but could never find tahini. I finally found it and now know it is the KEY ingredient to a good batch. I will never buy pre-made hummus again.

This was so good and easy. My husband is not a fan of hummus, but he said this was the best hummus he'd ever had. I agree! I didn't have tahini so I used an equal amount of natural peanut butter. I served this with warm pita and the Greek Chicken Pasta I found on this site.

This is probably the best hummus recipe I've found.  My 2 year old daughter loves to just eat it with a spoon!  For her, I back off on the cayenne pepper by half, but add an extra clove of garlic.  It is also great with just a bit of olive oil, or you can add some of the bean juice too, if it's too thick.  Personally, I don't change a thing from the recipe.  Great with pita chips, multi-grain tortilla chips, veggies, you name it!

I made up a batch of this for Christmas Eve afternoon appetizers, and it was so good, I had to immediately make another to ensure there was enough!  The only thing I did differently was to reduce the cayenne pepper to a scant 1/4tsp for the sake of some guests who couldn't tolerate the heat; this gave it a "just-right" amount of spicyness while still allowing for the other flavors to come through.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe, Holly!

Fabulous recipe. Tastes just like the expensive stuff in the grocery store!! Now that I've invested in the tahini I can make this so cheaply all the time.

this is my new favorite type of hummus.  the red peppers add a natural sweetness.  very tasty.  i had a fresh red bell pepper, so i just sauteed that on the stove and used it instead of jarred peppers.  this recipe is very tasty, and it's a very nice change from basic hummus.

This is soooo good!  I didn't have tahini, so I used peanut butter, and I forgot to get cayenne pepper, so I used chili powder.  It came out great!  I can already tell that my roommates will request this one a lot.

Wow! I WAY over did it and still came out great! Ok here's what I did, and bear with me, my man is a produce buyer at an organic co-op, so all ingredients were as such:
6-7 red peppers roasted over the stove and peeled
3 cloves garlic
2 cans garbanzo beans
3-4mire lemons 
2-4 limes mixed variety
Olive oil
2/3 c tahini ( misread the recipe!!)
Salt
Pepper
Bunch of fresh French parsley
Organic hot ghost/Thai powder (friend made)

***results *** a bit thin(due to so many peppers) but great flavor and versatile! Like granola, it's a recipe to use as is, or as a guide! Thanks!

I added 2 tbsp of water and one whole pickled jalapeño. I did not have fresh parsley, so I omitted. I only used 1 Tbsp of Tahini. It's always best to put a little in and add more as needed.

This was wonderful! I added some chopped roasted garlic instead of minced. Put it all into my Nutri Bullet. I reserved some of the garbanzo bean juice from the can. I was worried that it might be a little too thick for the  bullet. So I added some juice towards the end. It made creamier and it was fantastic!

Excellent.  Last time I made homemade red pepper hummus it just did not turn out, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.  I made a couple of slight changes, decreased the lemon juice and added some olive oil, increased the garlic and decreased the cayenne, and it was near perfect.  I've tried roasting my own peppers and I think buying the jar was worth it.  I got a 12oz jar for a reasonable price, and this recipe only called for 4oz so I have enough to make this 2 more times!

SANSU... Canned chick peas are already cooked. People, I don't understand why you would write a negative post when you totally change the recipe or if you just don't  like it. Try following recipe as written then write your thoughts. If you know you wouldn't like the ingredients in a recipe then simply try it. GEEEZZZ!!! I loved this recipe and I love hummus.

Made a batch of this yesterday and just finished it off this morning. Delish! Only changes I made were to use 3 TBSP Tahini (Instead of  1/2 only because I love the stuff) and I added 3 TBSP olive oil (because that's how I was taught to make Hummus by a Palestinian friend) to get it to the consistency I wanted. On a personal note, I would add a bit more salt next time. This stuff is even better the next day, after the flavors have had a chance to develop in the fridge overnight. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is my favorite humus recipe!  I leave out the tahini because I have a hard time finding it and I have also roasted my own red peppers (instructions here: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Easy-Roasted-Peppers/Detail.aspx) which made it cheaper and even more delicious!

Loved it, it keeps well in the fridge it seems like forever. I add a little olive oil when I serve it after being refridged for a while. I only has a 2 cup food processor and you can imagine this was not the thing to do, but it still turned out great. I have now purchased a larger food processor which I needed anyway.

Yummmm!!!! I doubled the recipe (except for the cayenne) and kept everything else the same. Keep in mind if you make this a day ahead all the flavors intensify, so keep the amount of garlic as directed.
This recipe is a keeper. Thanks

Didn't have cayenne pepper so I used chili powder.  It was good but needs more chili powder (and garlic.  I was out of garlic, but that's my fault)  for my taste.

This recipe is fabulous and so easy to make!  I have been buying a large container of hummus from Costco for years, but no more.  This recipe is absolutely delicious and much, much cheaper to make at home.  I make six batches at one time and my family eats within a couple days.  I use all organic ingredients and roast my own red peppers on the grill.  After roasting, place peppers in a bowl and cover with a hand towel for 15-20 minutes and the skin will easily peel off.  You will LOVE this recipe!!  Perfect dip for parties or pot lucks.  We use pita chips, crackers, tortilla chips and veggies.  Enjoy!

I took this to Women's Club with multi-grain pita chips.  Everyone really liked it.  I was concerned it may be to hot due to the amount of cayenne pepper in the recipe.  It was not.  I made the recipe as written except for adding an extra clove of garlic.  I always add extra garlic to a recipe that calls for garlic because I am fond of it.

I love this recipe! Easy, quick and healthy snack to make before work :) If you like more spice I put in about 3 or 4 tablespoons wasabi sauce, alter depending on taste!

didn't have garbanzo beans so i used white kidney beans and it turned out well. also roasted my own red and yellow peppers and skinned them instead of using from a jar. i fine tuned the spice and lemon levels to my taste and also added an herb mixture. didn't have tahini so i tossed in a handful of sesame seeds and olive oil. this is a good base recipe and is very versatile to suit your taste. fantastic with tosted pita chips. thanks for posting marbalet

The ingredients are about right, but the steps are all wrong. The beans need to be cooked before pureeing. And it has to be pureed alone, maybe just with the seasoning first. Then the tahini. Then the peppers. When I followed the recipe, it was inconsistent and chunky, because the beans were so unforgiving, even more so with the peppers in the mix. The idea's there, but the execution is all wrong.

This was very good but fortunately I read the other reviews indicating a little too much cayenne.  
Update-I made again and with these modifications rate 5!!
Use much less cumin (about 1/4 tsp) and even less cayenne (a little more than 1/8 but not quite 1/4 tsp) and 3/4 of bigger jar of roasted red pepper.  I put in most of the juice of roasted red peppers for a smooth, creamy texture.  This way the roasted peppers come thru and aren't overpowered by the other spices, particulurely the cayenne.  But just enough to give a suttle bite.

I had never made my own hummus before, but came across this. It's fantastic! The only thing I did different was lessened the tahini and in place used olive oil and also added feta. Evertime I bring this somewhere people rave about how good it is.

This sounds really good! I absolutely love hummus! For some reason mine never turns out as smooth as the hummus I've bought before. So far it's always been very chunky. I used my blender, moved the ingredients around to make sure it all gets pureed. What am I doing wrong?

I give this recipe a 5 star because it was excellent.  I love hummus and I could not see myself paying $5 for hummus in the store so I decided to learn to make my own.  This recipe is super easy and all my friends that tried the hummus loved it.  My friend said she will not buy anymore hummus.  So I guess that means I will have to make it for her all the time :-).  The only thing I did was omit the cumin because I did not have any.  The next time I make it, I will definitely add the cumin.

I also added some sun dried tomatoes for a nice flavor boost.  Also good with pine nuts  but will need additional red pepper or a touch of olive oil to avoid it becoming too dry.

Absolutely fabulous!  Of course I doubled the recipe and added a little more parsley, 6 garlic, a splash of olive oil and I used fresh roasted red peppers (2); cleaned and seeded.  Stored in little containers for snacks with lunch throughout the week!

This was the best hummus recipe I've ever made.  A perfect balance of sweet and spicy.  I usually use a little bit less (only 2 tbsp.) of the lemon juice unless I'm in the mood for a more tangy hummus.  If you like very smooth hummus I HIGHLY recommend removing the skin from the chickpeas beforehand.   It's very tedious (usually takes me an extra 20-30 minutes of prep time) but I promise it is well worth the extra labor.  Also worth noting, I've noticed that I sometimes end up having to add a bit of oil and/or water while processing to achieve the desired consistency.  Enjoy!

I've made a couple other hummus recipes on this site and this is probably the best.  I roasted the peppers myself and added olive oil for a smoother consistency.  I ate them with pita chips I made with directions from this site, which complemented this really well.

The taste was great. The only problem was that it was grainy. I think next time I will removed the skins of the beans before making the hummus.

A friend made this and shared the recipe with me b/c it was so fantastic!  When I made it, it was spicier, so I'd recommend using less cayenne pepper unless you like spicy!  I don't think I"ll ever buy hummus again.

I use this recipe for every event that calls for appetisers! SOOO good! If I know that the folks I'm cooking for don't tolerate a lot of spice, I halve the cayenne pepper, but I like it better with the original amount of red pepper.

Excellent flavor, especially after chilling and ingredients melding. We found some sweet Anaheim red peppers at Sam's and I roasted a couple of those to use-great for this!   Took advice of other reviewers and added juice from canned garbanzo beans for better consistency.  DH really liked it and will be making it again!  Thanks Marbalet for the post.

This is great!  Just whipped this up in the blender and I can't wait to taste it again after it has refrigerated for a while.  Two changes: I used lime juice because I did not have lemon (did not seem to affect the flavor); and like another reviewer, I did not have tahini so I substituted with 1 T. sesame oil, and it worked great.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe came out very well. It was my first time using a jar of roasted red pepper, so I used a bit less than the 4 oz. listed in the recipe. I also added some extra virgin olive oil to make it a bit creamier. I'll be making this one again!

This is an amazing recipe!! I took it to a bbq with some pita chips. It was gone so very quickly. My kids liked it so much they want me to make it again. Only change was to add a little olive oil as other suggested and reduce cayenne pepper a bit. Thanks for sharing this recipe!!

This was delicious and oh so smooth....!  Instead of using the Cayanne pepper, I had added a tablespoon and a half of Sriracha to the mixture.  Also, I added a little olive oil to the mixture at the end as it was blending.  Delicious!

This was my first try making hummus.  I cooked my own chick peas but other than that, followed the recipe and it was delicious!  I will be making it again soon!  Oh, and my company who had never had hummus before liked it too.  Thanks for the recipe.

We will never purchase hummus in a store again.  This recipe was wonderful and my husband and I ate the entire batch this evening.  I didn't have any tahini so substituted sesame seeds instead.  Also added some of the garbanzo beans liquid while blending to get to the right consistency.  My jar of roasted red peppers said 7.5 ounces but the peppers alone were 4 ounces so used them all.  Great recipe.  Will make again and again.

Move over Ranch and dill dips, this hummus is yummy. Another hummus recipe I tried, called for so much garlic, I couldn't taste anything else... I know, I didn't think too much garlic was possible, either. This is just right, and has a delightful blend of tasty, interesting flavors. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the PERFECT hummus recipe according to my idea what what hummus should taste like.  I reduced the cayenne to 1/8 b/c my kids would otherwise think it was too spicy.  This tastes pretty much exactly like Trader Joe's roasted pepper hummus.  Excellent!

It was delicious! My food processor broke right before making it so I had to use a blender instead... wasn't as creamy as I would have liked but I'm just blaming it on the processor.

mmmmm GOOD!  I did add a tsp of Olive Oil. While rinsing the beans, you may want to take the time to gently rub them between your hands to remove the "skins" on them.  It (IMO) makes a big difference in the flavor and texture.

Hummus III recipe is th ebest hummus recipe on this site.  To make Roasted Red Pepper Hummus, I would suggest using the Hummus III recipe and adding the amount of red peppers from this recipe.  However, the red peppers will make the consistency of the hummus more watery, so when making the hummus III recipe, add the red peppers BEFORE incrementally adding the reserved chick pea juice, checking the consistency after each processing.

This is very good. I used about half of a 12 oz. jar of the peppers, and also added a T. of olive oil. I wanted to check the spiciness to make sure I didn't overdo it, so I started with 1/4 tsp. of cayenne and 1/4 tsp. of Frank's Redhot sauce, then tasted it and added a little less than 1/2 tsp. of Frank's. At first I thought I had overdone it a bit, but I had made it the night before I needed it, and when I took it out the next day it seemed like it had mellowed just enough to make it perfect. I have a friend who really likes hummus, and he was very enthusiastic about this.

Awesome flavor!  I was afraid that I wasn't going to like the texture because I couldn't get my FP to blend it as smooth as my favorite store bought but it came out great and I was really glad I decided to try it.

Doubled the garlic and cumin, used freshly roasted peppers and added a tablespoon of olive oil. Delicious!

The ONLY reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I couldn't get a "whipped" consistency and I didn't have parsley. I don't like to give 5 stars unless I do everything the recipe calls for :) It has an amazing taste...so different from normal hummus! We had some on vacation that was similar..tried to recreate and def did the trick :)

Yum!  My husband and I loved this.  I cut the cayenne pepper in half as suggested by other reviewers and it had just the right amount of spice for us.  I will definately make this again!

Very good!  Love the spiciness and zip - better than any store bought types.  I did add a drizzle of EVOO to smooth it out a little.  Will make again!

OMG!!! I love Hummus and found this great recipe. All I can say is WOW!! I just did not make enough. I had the weight loss surgery and have started to become a vegan. I have been trying out new foods that agree with my new lifestyle. Thank you so very much for posting this great recipe.

This is our favorite hummus recipe so we always make a double batch.  The roasted red peppers add such an excellent flavor.  We also like our dips extra spicy around here and throw in a chipotle pepper (the kind that comes in a can with adobo sauce)  This adds a bit of nice, southwestern heat and taste.

So good!  I've been using allrecipes for over a year and this recipe finally made me create a profile so I could add it to my recipes.  I also added 1 Tbs olive oil, but I don't know if its necessary or not.  I just did because other reviewers did.  It turned out great!  I'm having a party tomorrow night and this will be great with pita chips!

I can see how this might be a bit too spicy for some. I highly recommend adding only 1/4 tsp of the cayenne pepper at first. Then if you feel its not spicy enough, add the other 1/4 tsp.

Great recipe- even better when you use fresh ingredients. I roasted a red pepper and used squeezed lemon juice. I'm sure it will be a hit.

This is a great hummus by itself, but my friend makes it with some changes that give it that much MORE flavor!  She replaces the 3T lemon juice with 2T Key Lime Juice and 1T pepperoccini juice and adds just a pinch of fresh rosemary!!!  WOW!!!

Love this recipe!  I didn't have parsley, so I subbed cilantro.  Also didn't use garlic, but added about a teaspoon of garlic salt and a tablespoon of olive oil!  Fabulous!

Delicious!  I made a double batch - if you do, be sure to add additional lemon juice and some of the retained garbanzo bean can liquid or olive oil.    I brought this to work today - Big Success and Great color - looks fabulous on the table!

I love this hummus! I have made it a few times and it's always a big hit. Tahini is kind of expensive (esp. considering you only need 1 1/2 T for this recipe!) so I actually used sesame oil instead which has a nice nutty flavor, and it's useful for lots of other recipes.

This wasn't the best hummus I've had, I didn't have cumin or olive oil to add, so I used curry spices on a smaller scale to subsitute for cumin. There was still that red pepper "twang" aftertaste that you get when biting into a fresh pepper. Maybe because I made my own roasted red peppers, I might try canned next time and buy some cumin and EVOO. It was also a little chunky, maybe EVOO would've fixed that. I'm not discouraged yet, but if I do make this again, I'll make those changes for sure. Tasted good on a turkey pita sandwich.

Awesome hummus recipe! I did cut the cayenne pepper to 1/4 teaspoon as suggested by some of the other reviewers, and I used roasted red peppers that were marinated in olive oil and garlic - which turned out great to me. Definitely a keeper!

Way good start for a recipe. I did mess up, and bought sesame oil instead of tahini, but it worked wonders! I also about doubled the cumin, and red peppers. In the end, maybe a hint too spicy, but with some work, I think this will be a keeper. I love it. Homemade hummus is the way to go. I can't believe how easy it is, either!

This was really good.  We actually made 3 batches of this, this morning.  I made the first batch and thought I would bring some to my family for x-mas.  I added a little more red pepper to the second batch, just for a spin.  Delicious!

Another 5 star recipe!! Loved it. Easy, I can't see why a person would buy it when you can take 3 minutes to do your own. I only had 1/2 jar of roasted peppers, but it was still really good!

My husband loved it, I made it too spicy for me, but still thought it was great.  I didn't have tahini, so I ground my own sesame seeds, and roasted my own pepper.

This is good hummus but it is very dry and grainy. It needs something to get it creamy - more lemon juice or tahini or maybe olive oil?

This was good but not great. If you use more tahini (like 1/4 cup) it will be smoother and have a richer taste.

I was really excited to try this recipe, but can only give it 3 stars. I used organic tahini which is a tad less viscus, but I felt that it ruined the texture, despite adding olive oil. Also, I had to add much more salt than I expected. Made this in my  magic bullet so I could tweak the recipe, and each time I ended up adding more lemon juice as well. It was a little bit too sweet for me, I will attempt again because I LOVE roasted red peppers, but perhaps with fresh lime and crushed red pepper added.

I roasted the peppers myself.  Easy and SO good!  It is a bit spicy, so be sure to adjust to your own taste.

Great!  made it in my magic bullet!! ^_^ I didn't have tahini so I just ground up some roasted sesame seeds (I'm korean so that stuff is ALways around) and added a little sesame oil.  I roasted my own pepper but think I'll skip that part next time.. I added the roasted pepper last and LOOOOOVED how the hummus tasted before i put it in - after I put the red pepper in, i thought the hummus was just "good"  BUT i think that was my fault for roasting my own pepper and not following the directions.

This is so yummy, just like the ones you'd buy at the market, and so easy to throw together.  Inexpensive too if you take a little extra time to roast your own bellpeppers.  I didn't have any tahini, and I've never had it before, so I'm not sure what it adds to the hummus. But I still thought it was delicious, and so did my guests!

This was my first time making hummus and it turned out great. I did roast my own peppers and I also added some olive oil for a smoother texture. Not sure is olive oil is traditionally in hummus but it wonderful.

Wow! this is a great recipe-I served it with veggies for a light summer meal. I used 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper and 1/4 tsp new mexico chilli pepper to give it a full flavour with a little less bite. Will definitely be making this again!

Use 1/2 of a 12 oz jar or red peppers ( a little of the liquid for thinning), and 2 garlic cloves, and extra cumin.  Yummy with carrots, honey wheat pretzel twists, tuna sandwich.

Add a tablespoon of sour cream, an additional clove of garlic and half a dried crushed chili pepper for heat and I've died and gone to heaven!  I don't want to share, I want to eat it all myself.

Easy excellence!  I'm trying to cut down sodium, so I used salt-free garbanzos, and didn't add salt.  I added extra spices to make up for this, and it was delicious!  Also, I was out of lemon juice, so I used 1/2 lime juice, 1/2 rice vinegar, and put a little lemon pepper in, and it seemed to work.  I also didn't have fresh parsley so used dried, but added some fresh cilantro which was really yummy.  Can't wait to try it again when I have all the right/fresh ingredients!  Oh, I also added some Olive Oil (just a little) for more creaminess, but I think it would be fine without - just more fluffy and not as creamy as traditional hummus, but with great flavor and low fat!  
UPDATE: I made this again following the recipe exactly and it was even better - yum!  I didn't use olive oil this time - so this is a very low fat hummus.  I mixed it with my Bamix hand blender, which can really get things creamy, so I think that helped.

Perfect! Way better than anything I've ever bought in a store. I made this for a party and it got RAVE reviews. I made a few tweaks to our tastes: Added a little EVO (about 1 - 2 tbsps) and a little extra garlic and cayanne. Thanks for sharing this recipe. It's the best hummus I've ever had!

Really great and really easy.  I soaked dry garbanzos overnight and used those instead of the canned ones.  I thought that the hummus was slightly dry.  Maybe it was because I didn't use the canned beans?

Definitely delicious!  After reading the reviews, I too lessened the cayenne pepper to 1/4of a teaspoon, and it was just enough spice.  I din't have any tahini, so I left it our and it tasted just fine.  Great way to change up a regular hummus recipe!

This has a really good and refreshing flavor.  I added a few extra cloves of garlic.  My only complaint is that it isn't as thick as I would like.  Still good though- love the flavor and color red peppers add.  I used Trader Joe's roasted red peppers and served with Trader Joe's multi-grain pita chips.  I put in just a sprinkle of cayenne so it wasn't too hot.

I've made this recipe several times, and here are a few things I've noted when I make it.  One, there is not enough garlic.  I always double it.  Then again, I REALLY like garlic.  Second, there's not enough red pepper either.  I also increase the red pepper a little more.  I usually buy the 11-12 oz jar and use at least half.  The downfall of this is that using the garbanzo beans as they are does not leave a smooth hummus like store bought.  I've often substituted white beans for a can of the chickpeas when I make a double batch.  It doesn't affect the taste much and makes it a little smoother.  You could shuck all the skins off the garbanzo beans, but that's a lot of effort.  I also sometimes add crumbled feta, which makes it even better.   I usually serve this with carrots, celery and drizzle olive oil and garlic over cut pitas to toast my own pita chips.  Yum!

Good flavor and easy to make.  Add a touch of olive oil if it seems a little dry after sitting in the fridge.

I drizzled 1-2 TBLS extra virgin olive oil into the mix to while blending. Next time I'm going to use roasted garlic instead of raw.

Great recipe with a terrific flavor blend, ingredient proportions and resulting texture!

Excellent hummus recipe! Today I didn't have tahini on hand so I used the same amount of peanut butter. I also added more garlic because I like my hummus very garlicky.

Excellent hummus with just the right amount of heat.  Instead of chickpea liquid to thin it, I used some of the roasted red pepper liquid.

Well, I thought 1/2 tsp of cayenne was a lot and it was. This was a pretty good recipe and I absolutely LOVE spicy/hot food but I think I prefer my hummus to be a bit milder because after the first bite all you taste is the cayenne pepper.

This recipe is great!  I didn't bother with roasted red peppers, I just threw in fresh!  about 2/3rds of a pepper and a touch of olive oil.  YUMMY!  I couldn't stop eating it!  I hope it's good for dieters like me! I'm going to start keeping lemons on hand for dip all the time!

Excellent. I used 8 oz of red peppers, brushed them with olive oil, and broiled them until the skin started to turn black.
I put them in a bag for a few mn to remove the skin more easily. I think adding a little bit of water would make the consistency smoother and bettre. Will make it again.

Yum! I used peppers that came in an olive oil and garlic marinade and just left out the garlic and it turned out wonderfully! Great texture and nice kick.

This was really good.  I roasted a red pepper and removed the skin. I also added 3 cloves of garlic because i like it spicy. I made my own tahini with sesame seeds and olive oil. I also added 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil.I doubled the cumin and cayenne pepper.   added just a teaspoon of sugar. I added some olive oil and a couple of tablespoons of the reserved juice from the beans. It was better than store bought for sure and it makes much more too. After it sits in the frig overnight it is the perfect texture.

I accidentally used a quarter cup of water soaked sun-dried tomatoes instead of the roasted red peppers. It turned out fabulous and I’m thrilled with my “happy little accident”.  I loved the little bit of heat at the back of my throat due to the cayenne, And even my hubby who doesn’t particularly like James generally did take a bite and liked it. He also detected that little bit of heat at the back of his throat and liked it.
I added just over a quarter cup of the bean liquid to thin it out. And.. I t didn’t need any oil!

I will definitely make again!!! I didn't have any cayenne so I added a tsp of red pepper flakes.  I think next time I will try with 2T of lemon juice vs 3.  Just a little on the tart side for my preference.  So easy and fresh!!

I make a double batch of this regularly.  When doubling it, I use three garlic cloves, and use heaping teaspoons of both the cayenne and cumin.  I also add a bit of olive oil and let the food processor run for about five minutes.  Lastly I use equal parts of lemon juice and tahini (1/4 cup each when making a double batch).  I usually add some of the water from the roasted red pepper jar until I get the consistency I prefer.

If you use chickpeas that have been dried instead of canned, I think it tastes even better.  When you do that you need to double the salt and also use additional water to get the consistency the way you like it.  After you make it and it sits for a while, it tends to get thicker, so I make it a little on the runny side.

I tried one of the other spicy hummus recipes on your site and this one is sooooo much better. It isn’t quite as spicy as I like but I can always adjust that in the future. I did not make any changes to the recipe at all. I will be making this again and again.

This was a great hummus. I roasted the peppers over the open fire of my gas stove and they had an amazing flavor. The spices and veggies blended so well together and left a smooth taste with a spicy kick at the end. I made it the night before so the flavors would really meld together. It was a huge hit at the party. We paired it with pita chips and veggies. People loved it. Thank you for an easy recipe. Wouldn’t change a single thing.

Very delicious.  I used a red pepper that I roasted myself.  I urge everyone to do so, the flavor is fresher and it is cheaper than store bought and it's easy to do.  I didn't use the cayenne pepper instead I used half a small chipolte in adobo.  Definetly
making again.

I made a double batch.  This was my first attempt at making hummus at home.  I found this recipe easy to follow that provided great flavor.  It was really easy to tweak the spice level for your pallet.  Just remember the flavors intensify a bit after things meld together.

Hate to be negative about such a highly rated recipe but this one is not for me.  Although I liked the red pepper flavor, the cumin and cayenne were too strong for my taste. Next time will use just a hint of each.

I love hummus and this is easy to make. You will not buy the prepackaged stuff again. My mom always made her own hummus and the Spaniards gobbled it up. I use piquillo peppers and it is fantastic. On Namn or pita chips great snack or in addition to a great meal.

This is delicious! It has just the right amount of tanginess and I love the roasted red pepper flavor. I think I will decrease the amount of cayenne pepper next time.

Delicious! I made my own tahini, roasted my own peppers, (fabulous quick video if you search this site for "roasted red peppers"), and Instant Pot cooked dry garbanzos rather than canned. Skipped the olive oil to save calories. Flavor and texture is outstanding! This recipe is definitely a keeper. ??

Okay, so I must admit I changed the recipe quite a bit by using cannellini beans instead of garbanzo beans, as my husband likes a more creamy texture to his hummus. Which I cannot seem to achieve a smooth enough texture when I use garbanzo beans. Only other change was I did not use 3 tablespoons of lemon juice, rather only 1 T. But this turned out wonderful! My husband's favorite flavor hummus is roasted red pepper so he gave it a big thumbs up!

This is a major hit at parties and for sharing at work!  I doubled up on the garlic and spices (as usual) and added a little smoked paprika. But even if you left this recipe as-is, you will be happy!

I really love making my own hummus. This recipe is wonderful.  I love the flavor of the roasted red pepper.  I only use 2 T lemon juice because I like the sweeter flavor, but this is my go-to recipe when I have people coming and I need something to offer while they are waiting for dinner.  I usually serve it with either pretzels or tortilla chips.   Thank you for the good recipe!

The outcome was good once I made a few adjustments.
>I had no Tahini so I used some of the liquid from the can of chickpeas
>My blender was having a hard time with the thickness of the dip so I added a little extra water
Overall I found the hummus lacked a good flavour profile
I'll keep searching for a great hummus recipe

Delicious and soooo simple! I omitted the cayenne pepper since I was making it for my 8 month old son. Next time I will add more salt and more garlic (my own preferences) & try adding cayenne when I make it for me! Not as smooth as store bought, but very flavorful and much cheaper!

I compared this to Tribe roasted red pepper hummus just out of curiosity and this recipe blew it away.   I used only 1/8 tsp. cayenne cos of my kids and it was perfect for them with just a hint of spiciness.  If I was making this for myself I would use 1/4 tsp.  Next time I will roast my own red pepper cos the jarred ones are expensive and need to be used within 1 week after opening.   
Definitely a great hummus recipe!!

Be careful with the cayenne as this recipe has just a little bit of heat to it.  It was delicious and so much better than store bought.

I make my own and didn't use tahini sauce - once I used almond butter  another time I used peanut butter instead. For the small amount called for, there's little difference. It's just a way to thicken. Be creative, don't be afraid to experiment.

Fantastically simple and simply fantastic! We like a little more kick in our hummus so we double the cayenne (and double the cumin so the flavors balance correctly).

Mixed up nicely, flavor was good.  Not a favorite with guests at a party, unfortunately.

Made this for my family's Pre-Christmas party.  My mom loves it!! To ensure the hummus has a smoother consistency, I always pop the chickpeas off their skin. I used 1 can of chickpeas and 1 can of Butter beans. I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used smoked paprika powder.  I also used two large freshly roasted red peppers (baked 230degrees 30mins) skinned. Even the caramelised juice from the peppers were added into the processor for extra flavour. Fresh lemon juice AND lemon peel all added into the processor too! 
Initially the hummus was too hot for liking so I added more Tahini. I also used sesame oil and extra virgin olive oil to make it smoother. if some water reserved from the can of beans are added, the hummus would have been even smoother amd softer!

Great, easy recipe!  This is the first time I have ever made hummus.  I think it came out good, but a little too spicy for me.  Next time I will add a little EVOO and reduce the cayenne, cumin and lemon juice a bit - eventually I'll get it to where I like it!

Not my favorite dish.  We are hard core lemon hummus eaters, so I guess the change in flavors was just too much for us to adjust to.  I made the recipe exactly as written, although I make my own chick peas from dried and I roasted my own red peppers, but other than that it was as written.

This tastes great! The only thing I didn't follow exactly is adding the cayenne pepper as I don't appreciate spicy. It's not one of those dishes that relies on the spice to supply the flavor, this stands alone quite well without. Next time, I may try combining it with my other recipe that calls for roasting a whole head of garlic and then throwing the cloves in the food processor.

Awesome recipe! First hummus recipe I tried and was very successful. I added more red peppers to increase the zest and richness of the flavour. Family and friends can't get enough of it. I make it at least once per month. Very healthy!

This turned out pretty good. I will make it again. But only after I get a "powered" food processor instead of using one by hand... not as smooth as it should be, but pretty good considering...

It's pretty good but I prefer my hummus smoother so I added a lot of olive oil to it till it was smooth enough for me.  It was also a bit spicy so I would cut back on the cayenne next time.

I've made this several times now.  It really is a good and easy to make hummus recipe.  Fits in really well with my healthy eating phases.  Try this even if you don't usually make hummus.  It will be well worth it.

This is the first time I've made my own hummus and it is delicious. It was so easy. The only change I made was that I used a whole 12 ounce jar of red peppers cause I really like the flavor.(I didn't use the juice in the jar. Wasn't sure if it was suppose to be drained or not)

I followed this recipe exactly.  Then I let it sit in the fridge for a couple of hours.  Then I tasted it.  Then I doubled the cumin and cayenne pepper and tripled the garlic.  I like it much more now!  And for those of you searching for tahini.... have you ever tasted it?  I make a lot of hummus. I quit worring about it and started using peanut butter.  Same taste.  Less $ and always in my pantry!

I use organic peanut butter when I can't find tahini.  The taste is almost the same and you can't tell the difference in the recipe.  The organic peanut butter is not as sweet as Jiff or Skippy brands. This is my favorite hummas recipe.

I detest hummus, but my family LOVES it. I made this, and they loved it. Just a few notes, from other observations. A 4 oz jar of roasted red pepper = a small or 1/2 large pepper. I did broil it for 7-8 minutes on foil, then steamed it in a baggie for 15 to get the skin off (as someone suggested, which worked great). No tahini, but I found a site for substitutes: 3 parts peanut butter and 1 part sesame oil, which also worked great. Added the 1 Tbs olive oil to fluff it a bit. Swapped the parsley with cilantro (good substitute). So essentially, other than the right substitutes, and one added Tbs of olive oil, I made the recipe as is. Go for it, if your family likes hummus.

I made this for a craft club function. It's wonderfully spicy with a hint of garlic. I doubled the recipe and it worked beautifully. The only thing I did different was to add a little water to make it the consistency I prefer. I love this and will make it again.

This is wonderful!  It's the first time I've ever made hummus.  I had to make just a change or two based on the ingredients I had on hand.  I did not have tahini and a substitute suggestion was to combine sesame oil and natural peanut butter so I used that.  I did not have 4 full ounces of roasted red pepper, but I had a jar of sweet piquant peppers so I used some of them to make up the difference.  I threw in a handful of smoked sundered tomatoes just because and whipped it up.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I've made this several times, so much better than store-bought. I customized it by adding canned artichokes (14 oz. in water) chopping about half up and the rest put into the blender with everything else. After the hummus was creamed I stirred in the chopping artichokes.

Great recipe!  I added 1 Tbsp. of olive oil and a little bit of crushed red pepper for more heat.  Also, used my own roasted peppers that I had in the freezer.  Will definitely make it again.

This was pretty easy to make. The only thing I did differently from the recipe is to roast my own red peppers as opposed to using the kind that comes in a jar. This makes an excellent and nutritious snack.

I enjoyed this recipe! However, I couldn't help myself and added my own zing by adding 1/2 tsp of Agave Nectar and a small red jalapeno out of my garden (seeded and minced).  I found the nectar balanced the acidity and warmth of the peppers.  I garnished with cilantro and served with lavash bread and raw veggies.  Yummmmmmm!

Yum! Rated 4 stars because this needs some olive oil or marinade liquid. I found nice jars of marinated roasted red peppers (with garlic cloves) at my local dollar store of all places. They are perfect for this recipe. I used some marinade from the red peppers while blending. I live in Phoenix and found Fresh n Easy neighborhood market is the place for Tahini... one $5.99 jar makes a lot of hummus.

Yummy and I even forgot the lemon juice.
** I have made this over and over. BIG hit! Take the time to soak and cook your own beans if possible. I also use a half pint of my home jarred roasted red peppers.

Very good.  I prefer the original hummus (Hummus II from this site).  However, this recipe is better for the reason the calories are on the low side.

Absolutely the best hummus recipe I've found.  I followed the recipe to a T, except I used 1 tsp dried parsley in place of fresh parsley.

Okay, I am pregnant, hopefully not for much longer but the first 3 months of my pregnancy this is basically all I could eat.  I ate it for breakfast, dinner, lunch and in between for snacks.  I made this like it was going out of style and I always had the ingredients on hand.  100x better than the store bought stuff, amazing on basically anything - carrots, sliced red and green peppers, sugar snap peas, naan bread, pita chips, you get the idea.  I would try fresh basil or cilantro instead of parsley but it all came out yummy in the end.  Do I still eat it this much?  Eh not really,  I am extremely burned out on hummus not BUT that doesn't change the fact that this recipe puts easy and high quality hummus on your table without a lot of fuss.  And it kept me and the new baby going in a time when I couldn't eat anything else!!

This hummus is has awesome flavor and is terribly addicting! I made one batch exactly as written, the next time, I only had cilantro on hand, I used that instead of parsley. It was a great flavor combination as well!

Great hummus recipe! I roasted my own peppers and added a few more spices (seasoning salt, garlic powder, and curry). I also put in about twice as much lemon juice. This was my first homemade hummus and it came out great!

Delicious! I doubled the cayenne pepper because my boyfriend and I like spicy hummus. The recipe was so easy and it turned out perfect. Because I only have a blender, I usually end up adding the chickpea liquid so that my blender can actually process the hummus without catching fire. I usually make my own pita bread to go with it for a quick dinner. "Traditional Pita Bread" from this website works great.

This recipe for hummus is really easy and delicious.  The only thing I would change next time is to use only a dash of cumin to let the taste of the red pepper show through more.

This was my first time making hummus (and I'd never really even had it before).  It was great!  I couldn't find a 4 oz jar of roasted red peppers, so I bought a 12 oz jar and used half.  Served with toasted pita (just cut the pockets in half, cut them into triangles, brush with olive oil and bake at 350 for 6 to 8 minutes).  This is going to replace guacamole as my favored snack food for TV sports!  Lower in fat, calories and cost!

This was delicious- I don't think I'll ever need storebought hummus again! Next time I will be making it with half the cayenne, though, because it is definately very zesty(great if you love that, but too much for me and my family). Thanks for the awesome recipe!

Really easy recipe but I think it has way too much lemon. I added only 1.5 Tbsp lemon juice and that was already too much. Had to add 1 more Tsp of tahini to balance the flavor. Tasted much better the next day and goes well with homemade pita chips.

Much more delicious and economical than buying hummus from the store!  I roasted one whole fresh red pepper in the oven instead of using a jar of peppers.  Also removed the skins from the chickpeas.  Seasoned with cumin, cayenne, and salt.  Had such a creamy but kind of whipped texture.  Perfect!

This is a hit here in Santiago Chile with all of my ex-pat & Chilean friends.  I didn't have cayene, so I used red chili flakes.  Forgot the salt and it turned out just fine.  It's spicy and sweet! I will make this recipe over & over.

I made this recipe exactly as stated and thought it came out great. It seemed just a tiny bit on the bland side, but I think I will try to make up for that by adjusting the spices next time. Otherwise, a great appetizer that I plan to make again. I served it with hot pita wedges (store-bought and toasted in the toaster)

I didn't have any tahihi or cumin at the time I made this.  I used sesame seeds and some olive oil and it turned out fantastic.  I like my foods spicy so I added a little more red pepper too. Thanks for the great recipe.

Great flavor...the only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the store bought is better...it's just creamier than my food processor could ever achieve.  Yummy, but just as easy to go to the store.  My fiance couldn't stop raving about it though.

This was a very good and easy recipe for hummus. I did add a little more cayenne because we like it hot...but other than that I made it just as stated. Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Very yummy.  I loved the smokiness of the roasted red peppers.  Next time, I will add a couple tablespoons of raw jalapeno - to bring it a little more kick.  I garnished with chopped parsley & served with triscuits.  I will NEVER buy hummus ever again.

This was a nice dip for appetizers, and went very nicely with veggies as well as pita wedges.  Was a little bit thick - I added some olive oil to smooth it out a bit.

Oh wow!!!  Really good...didn't have the peppers, used 3 sun dried tomatoes packed in oil instead.  Added about a 1/4 cup of water to thin it out a bit.  Really top notch!  My hubby was like, "humm what?", and then gobbled it all up like a two year old in a mashed potato eating contest!!!!

My first time making hummus and it was a success! I followed the recipe to a T and it turned out great. I left mine a little bit chunky and like it better I think. I took it to work and got some authentic approval from a co-worker who is Lebanon. He loved it!

This was my first attempt at making hummus, and I will definitely be making it again.  The only change I made was roasting my own pepper and adding a little extra chili powder (now a bit too spicy) However, I do feel that it is lacking some flavor - but I don't know what yet.  Next time, I may try adding roasted garlic or maybe some lemon zest.  It'll be fun to experiment.

This hummus is excellent!!!  I had yet to find a homemade hummus recipe I liked until this one.  I could sit and eat it by the spoonful!  The only alteration I made was that I added a little bit of the juice from the beans to make the mixture more smooth.  And the cayenne pepper is just the right amount of heat.

Hummus is supposed to be sweet, this is waay too hot for what I am used to (and I have had and made a lot). I do not recommend this recipe for someone who has never had hummus before, and surely not for a party.

Bar none the best hummus I have EVER had, homemade or store-bought, and it is so easy to make!  I did add a little extra cumin and cayenne - but for a milder taste follow the recipe.

This recipe takes the "ho-hum" out of hummus! Really tasty and good!

The first time I prepared it I substituted peanut butter for tahini (worked okay) but when I realized I would be serving it often I went ahead and bought tahini.

We prefer it on tortilla chips.

This is delicious. The recipe is so easy, and it turned out great. I didn't have any lemons, so I left out the lemon juice and just added a bit of water for consistency, and it was still fabulous. I cut back by about half on the cayenne, and the spiciness was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

My all-time favorite hummus recipe!  It's great with pita wedges, but I also love it as a dip for fresh vegetables and as a sandwich spread.  If I don't have tahini on hand I substitute natural peanut butter and it tastes just as delicious.  I'd give this recipe more than 5 stars if I could!

This recipe is great and will be using from now on. I added a bit of the juice from the garbanzo beans as was suggested by others and it turned out great. Not too spicey. Thanks for the great recipe. :-)

What a wonderful hummus recipe!  The color is beautiful, making it a great dip for company.  I reserved the liquid from the garbanzo beans and roasted red peppers and added just a touch to the blender to smooth out the consistency.  I doubled the reciped due to the great reviews, boy, am I glad I did!!  I love hummus, and this is my new favorite!  Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful! A fantastic combination of flavours and just the right amount of spice. The colour is attractive, too - perfect for a party. If the consistency is too thick, try adding some of the liquid from either the can of garbanzo beans or the jar of red peppers.

Very good hummus!  Super easy to make.  Used it for an autumn party and the color was great!  I used natural peanut butter instead of tahini.  Also added a bit more lemon juice as I was blending to help get a smoother consistency.  Defintely a keeper recipe!

This recipe is absolutely delicious. It is great on a pita sandwich, on baked pitas, or just on a spoon! It is fairly healthy, and nice and spicy.

This is so good.  It makes a great snack or light lunch dunking in pita bread.
