There is way too much baking soda in this recipe. It calls for 2 1/2 tsp but should probably be 1/2 tsp. Had to throw the whole batch out.

There is no sugar in the donut portion of this recipe. Surely this was an oversight. I added 1/4 cup of sugar just before I baked them. Will probably add 1/2 cup next time. The texture was just right like a light muffin but the baking soda was all you could taste and it left a bitter taste in my mouth. Suggestions welcome. I'd love to try this again.
