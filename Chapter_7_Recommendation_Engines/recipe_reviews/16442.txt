Very quick and fairly easy to make.  I had all the ingredients on hand too!  The taste was nice and the presentation was impressive as well!  I used some green and some red apples and added a touch of brown sugar to the cake mix.

This was a very fast and easy recipe to make, but I thought it was not very 
good. It was a very dry cake and following the cooking time it did not
cook the apples all the way. I will not make this again.

I'm not sure about anyone else but I looked at this recipe thinking it was made in a dutch oven. I have a dutch oven that we use when camping which is not put into an oven but used with charcoal.  This is not what this recipe is for.

This was good and easy to make but needs more apples in my opinion.  I'll put in double next time.  Too much bread with only 3 apples I think.  But, I do appreciate how quick and easy it is.

Certainly like the convenience of this cake but to counteract some dryness add 2 tbls. of oil and this certainly helps when using baking mixes.  Also, the apples need to be sliced thinly otherwise they might not be soft enough - depends on what type of apple you use.
