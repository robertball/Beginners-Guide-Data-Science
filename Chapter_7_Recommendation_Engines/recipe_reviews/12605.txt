I'm in the middle on this. I'm soo puzzled. While the recipe was easy with ingredients and instructions. It wasn't overly sweet but it was tangy tart. But not overly tangy tart it's partly an after taste. I followed exactly to the T but realized that I had a deep dish 9 inch pie. So the ingredients didn't fill the pie all the way. I assumed it would be like a pecan pie. But didn't rise like one at all. So It's sitting on the bottom rack of the oven temp is 325 (have a thermometer inside)...30 minutes comes and it's not even lightly golden at all. So I kept looking about 45 minutes it was lightly brown. Pull it out and let it cool for 3 hours before I cut it the inside ran out so perplexed. The center was still a bit goopy. So Honestly. I don't know if that was suppose to be that way. Sorry.
