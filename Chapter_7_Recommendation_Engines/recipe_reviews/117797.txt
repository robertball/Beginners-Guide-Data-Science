I was a little skeptical of this recipe because I envisioned a dish full of stewed tomatoes with soggy bread. O.K. I was wrong.  I used 2 cups red tomatoes and 2 cups orange tomatoes, which I seeded before chopping as a personal preference. I thought about peeling the tomatoes but decided against it, and in spite of the seeming long cook time (for tomatoes), they didn't breakdown into a sauce with tough bits of skin but stayed in reasonably whole pieces. I resisted the urge to tinker too much with the recipe and used the whole wheat bread instead of the leftover sour dough bread that begged to be tossed in. The most significant changes I made were to add some minced garlic and fresh herbs; basil, oregano and parsley. I also topped it with a bit of Parmesan cheese. We very much enjoyed this dish served with Barbecued Ribs, Spaghetti with pesto and fresh local corn. I will make it again but probably will add some mushrooms and chopped zucchini to flesh it out a bit. I wouldn't make it without the garlic and herbs because I thought that it could have used even more than I added. Great light summer side dish but consider you own tastes when you make it.

This recipe really surprised me. First of all the texture was perfect. Not watery like I expected. I only used 3 cups of tomatoes and I thought it was the right amount in ratio with the rest of the ingredients. The honey gave it a nice sweetness and I liked the flavor the mustard gave this dish, but I didn't find that it had enough flavor. Next time I would like to add garlic, herbs and Parmesan cheese as other reviewers suggested. I will use this recipe as a base and really have fun with it.

My husband and I both liked this.We had this with steak and garlic bread. I had wished I would have added some garlic to this, but I did the recipe as is .It really showcased the tomatoes which are the true stars of this recipe.

I was pleasantly surprised at how well this dish turned out.  I altered the recipe minimally, EVOO instead of butter and dry toasted bread cubes.  I had only multigrain bread, which was slightly sweeter than regular whole wheat and the flavor did come through, but in a good way.  I also used a coarse, brown mustard since that was all I had at hand.  If I make it again I will add garlic and more onion and get creative with herbs since this was a little blander than I prefer.

I made this twice. First time was a watery mess. Thought I would give it another chance, so second time, I deseeded the tomatoes. Much better. It was just ok for me. A little bland. Husband and son said just ok. Definitely needs some more spices. I would have to jazz it up some, maybe even with some cream in it. We are not really tomato only type dish fans, too much like stewed tomatoes with bread.

Very nice flavor and nice light side dish.  A great way to use up your garden tomatoes.  I served with sausage links and a garden salad.    My kids didn't really like it and they aren't picky so that was a little disappointing.

Great dish. I de-seeded the tomatoes and ended up with a perfect consistency in the end. I added garlic to the onions and celery. Had no bread, so used croutons instead. Other than that, no changes. The honey mustard adds a nice flavor to the tomatoes. Use the best tomatoes you can. If you use flavor-less hot house varieties, you will end up with a flavor-less dish. I halved the recipe with great results. We are on a food plan that counts points, and each serving came out to equal 2 points. Will make this part of our regular rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Awesome side dish; made it for the first time. I used fresh tomatoes on the vine, what wonderful flavor and so easy to make. I will be making this a lot more. I absolutely loved the fresh flavors.
