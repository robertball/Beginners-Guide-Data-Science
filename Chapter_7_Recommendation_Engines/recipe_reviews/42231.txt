Better than any restaruant can do!!!! This recipie rocks and is easy to do.  I sought out and bought the Shiso, and could not really taste it - so don't worry if you can't find it.  I also found that I needed to cook the fish in the oven a bit longer than suggested to get it cooked all the way through.  You owe it to yourself to try this~!!

I was initially skeptical about this recipe combining western ingredients with an eastern recipe, but my husband and I, who are both self-professed foodies, were very pleased. 

I saw no need to bake the fish, I kept everything on the stovetop and it came out beautifully. I grated more ginger, added more wine and cream and a touch more soy sauce. I used sole for my fish, which cooks very quicky. Seared seasame was wonderful. After flipping the fish once, I turned the heat to low, covered the pan briefly while I blended the sauce. I turned the heat on hi again afterwards and poured some of the sauce on the fish and let it simmer for a few seconds. Then I turned the heat off completely and covered the pan so that the fish could sit in the warm sauce while we ate our udon beforehand.

WOW!!!

OMG! This is BY FAR the best fish I've ever had!  The sauce was the best part - Dee-Lish!  I use 2 TBSP+ of ginger for the sauce.  Also, make sure the lemon you use is a large one.     

I usually make this with seared tuna steaks, brushed with sesame oil then salt & peppered.  

All my friends have had this recipe and beg for me to make it!  Thanks for the great recipe!  :)

This also works with other fish besides mahi mahi. Halibut, wahoo, swordfish, salmon, and tuna also work well.

Amazing!  I made this for a dinner party last night.  This morning, the emails are flying around about how amazing it was. The friends who were unable to attend last nights dinner party are begging for a repeat.  The friend that did attend last nights dinner party are begging to be invited to the repeat.  I was unable to find the shiso leaves, but as others did, I substitued fresh basil and mint.  I used halibut as opposed to Mahi-mahi.  It was cooked to a nice medium-rare to medium and was melt in your mouth good.  I served this with Miso soup, sticky rice, and sauted green beans.  Thank you for the recipe...  My friends now think that I'm a much better cook than I really am!  :-)

Amazing!  This is one of the best fish dishes I have made.  The sauce was labor intensive, but can be made in advance and just warmed on the stove.  My sauce was a little too thin, so next time I will have to reduce more or add a thickener.  But the flavor was fantastic.  I used basil instead of shiso, but next time will just omit it and add more wasabi as per another poster's suggestion (I only added a tiny bit, next time will add at least a tsp).  Don't skimp on the ginger in the sauce either.  We liked it so much, we're making it again with tuna tomorrow.  Serve with steamed green beans sauteed with yellow bell pepper and toasted sesame seeds.  Perfect!

I found this to be a pretty good dish.  If you are having trouble finding shiso leaves, then go to any half way decent sushi restaurant, offer to buy 4 leaves, and they will more than likely give them to you.  Basil and/or mint do not make good substitutes, you would be better off simply omitting the shiso.  The sauce is basically a beurre blanc sauce with a Japanese influence. Muscadet is the traditional wine used for beurre blanc sauce, but any dry acidic white wine will do.  I usually use a Sauvignon Blanc with a very nice acidity to it, and I never use a wine for cooking that is not good enough to enjoy on its own.            I like my beurre blanc to have a very high acidity to it, like this one does, but for those who don't like a very acidic sauce, I might recommend cutting back a tiny bit on the lemon juice.          Next time I will try cooking the mahi mahi in olive oil, instead of canola, as I think that will improve on the flavor.

If there were more stars offered, this recipe would get them.  It is FANTASTIC!  The sauce is out of this world good!  I didn't use mahi mahi becuase it wasn't fresh, so I used orange roughy.  I too was unable to find shiso leaves.  I served the fish on a bed of jasmine rice (Allrecipe.com recipe) for a dinner party and everyone raved about it.  This is my new favorite fish recipe.

The fish was really good but the sauce was awful!  It made me feel sick by the few drops that made it in my stomach.  I will make the fish again, but not the sauce.

My picky boyfriend loved it!!!
To make it a little lighter, I omitted the heavy cream and only used about 1/4 of butter called for.
It was still really good with wonderful flavors!

Absolutely delicious.
Sauce is also great on Ahi tuna and - you wouldn't believe it - pork tenderloin!
You may also try adding a 1 tsp wasabi paste to the sauce into the blender and use less soy sauce (we try to use less salt in our food).

This is a great recipe.  It is fairly easy, and turns out fantastic, literally something you would get in a nice restaurant.  The ginger butter sauce was also a perfect complement to the light flavored fish.  This is definitely a dish we will be making regularly.

I don't get it.  This sauce was VERY lemony and SOY was the only other flavor I could taste. I didn't have the shiso;maybe that would have balanced the flavors out more...?  Also, my lemon was very large and juicy (recipe just says "1 lemon, juiced"). ? I will try this one again, (due to the great reviews)with a smaller lemon and I will find this "shiso". Maybe it will change my 3 stars. Until then, LOVED the mahi mahi seared with the sesame seed topping. Will definitely do that again. FYI, I bought FROZEN Mahi Mahi (at a Sam's Club)and it was delicious! The only problem was each piece was a DIFFERENT THICKNESS, making some done more than others, but still very good flavor and texture.

Outstanding! Used Chilean Sea Bass instead of Mahi Mahi, but it was still awesome.  Couldn't find the Shiso, but the sauce was still unbelievable. Thanks!

I would give this six stars if I could.  We don't usually cook a lot of fish, but made this on vacation when we had access to fresh mahi mahi, and oh my goodness it is out of this world. The sesame crust is a very nice touch, and the sauce.... oh the sauce.  Amazing.  Since then, we've made it with talapia, but prefer it with the mahi mahi. We made a lot of substitutions b/c of what was available. We used onion instead of shallots, half and half instead of cream, fresh mint and basil instead of shiso, and plain sesame seeds instead of black. We also added chopped shiitaki mushrooms to the sauce. Served it over brown rice. It doesn't take long to make, not that hard, and very very good.  It is a recipe that we drool over.

This is my favorite recipe to make for company or a special occasion.  I use tuna instead of mahi mahi, but the sauce is perfect!  My guests always ask for the recipe.  Shiso is often served with tuna sashimi and soy sauce in Japan, and this is a great Western take on that combination.  If you can't find shiso, you could probably buy the seeds online and grow it.  In my humble opinion, there really is no substitute, although I'm sure the recipe is good without the shiso.  If you make up extra sauce and freeze it, this can be a quick meal on a weeknight.  Sometimes, it's difficult to reheat the sauce without it separating, but the flavor is unchanged.

I loved this recipe. I have difficulty to find a great recipe for white fish, but this recipe is so delicious. The sauce was amazing. You can use this sauce on anything. I didn`t find shiso leaves and I used basil + mint.

was very good. served with white rice....i seasoned my fish with white pepper and kosher salt the nite before so that the fish was extra flavorful. Will definitely make again. This is a good recipe to use when you are trying to impress someone or for a dinner party.

Stellar.  I did not have shiso, so I substituted four large fresh basil leaves and a few mint leaves.  Also olive oil rather than canola oil.  Probably the best fish dish I have prepared.

I loved it; my three-year-old loved it; my picky husband thought it was okay. I substituted salmon, and to cut some of the calories, used 2% milk instead of cream and only half the butter. The sauce was a little thin but tasty. The milk started to curdle a little when I added it to the shallot/lemon mixture, but the blender whirled it all together nicely in the end.

I live in Japan and haven't been able to find even a translation for mahi mahi, much less mahi mahi itself.  I used swordfish steaks with the recipe scaled for 2.  It was excellent, though a I would recommend increasing the wine, cream and butter a little to make more sauce.  I juiced a lemon, but next time will probably just use lemon juice to cut down on hassle.

I've made this twice now.  The first time I forgot to add the soy in the sauce and absolutely loved this dish.  I made it again anxious to add the forgotten soy, well, I liked it a lot more without the soy!!!  I'm surprised as I love soy sauce.  Very tasty either way!

I was literally drooling when I read this recipe, but I was a little disappointed with the end result. The sauce was too sour for my taste and needed a little more Eastern flavor. Next time, I will omit the lemon juice and add sesame oil to the sauce. Thanks for the inspiration.

WOW! This is a great dish. The sauce and the sesame seed crust are wonderful. My store didn't have mahi mahi, so I got tilapia. No shiso either, so I skipped it. Other than that I followed the recipe  exactly, and it's a new household favorite.  I made a side of "Udon Peanut Butter Noodles" using a variation of the recipe here. Also served with steamed broccoli with some butter.  It's going to be repeated for sure.

The sauce was incredible and balanced very nicely with the sesame crusting.  I could not find Shiso leaves so I substituted basil leaves.

Fabulous! Mine was too salty, but probably due to user error rather than bad recipe portioning. That said, taste as you go (always a good bit of advice for cooks, I guess).

This sauce is AMAZING! We had it with Mahi Mahi the night I made it and its delicacy matched the fish perfectly. But I had some leftover and notice that the delicate flavour had strengthened in the fridge overnight so decided to do a rolled chicken/prosciutto/dijon recipe I had (usually with a Chardonnay sauce) to use up the leftover sauce. It was top-drawer restaurant quality!!...and so simple. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. Plan to try it with red wine instead of white and rosemary for herbs served with lamb. Will share how that turns out.

This was amazing! made this for a hawaiian themed cooking night. Very easy and delicious. Biggest hit of the night! could not find shiso so substituted basil and mint as others had suggested.

This is simply fabulous.   I didn't change a thing with the exception of the shiso because I couldn't get it in the burbs.  Used fresh basil and mint leaves instead.  If you are looking for a mahi mahi recipe....look no further.  My kids loved it too and asked for seconds!

This is the BEST dish I have ever eaten, and I've eaten in quite a few top rated places. TIP: I didn't want to open a whole bottle of wine so I used mirin (Japanese rice wine) which gave it a subtle sweet flavor. Otherwise, made as directed. THANKS! This will be my go to company recipe. My husband was eating the sauce with a spoon.

OMG! Eating this was like being at a expensive resturant. So easy, yet so gormet. Couldn't find the shiso, so I just left it out. What is it anyways? My husband is a fisherman, so now I have the recipe I've been looking for. Thanks!!!

This recipe is nothing short of EXCELLENT.  I live in Hawaii and luckily, have the opportunity to eat great local fish at some of the most world renowned pacific rim restaurants.  This could have easily been at any top notch restaurant.  My family was so impressed with my cooking.  As for the recipe, I used basil instead of shiso and did not cook the sauce in a blender, just on the stove and it came out great.

Great!  I cut down on the butter to make it a bit heathier and  I do not think the taste was compromised. Also, next time I will not salt the fish as I found it too salty.

This is a fantastic recipe, even if you leave out the shiso leaves.  No idea where to find such things - perhaps an asian market?  Oh well.

Very good recipe. I used it with tuna because I couldn't get fresh mahi and it was very tasty. Make sure you season the fish with salt and that will bring out more of the sesame flavor from the seeds. I could not find shiso so I used thai basil and it came out very good. I'll try the shiso if I can find it.

I fixed this for a Hawaiian theme Mothers Day dinner at church.  Over all everyone who dared to try it liked it.  It reminded me much of my mothers Japanese egg roll dip.  I did modify the recipe a little, adding a tablespoon of honey (it tasted a little bitter), I used 1/2 tsp mint and 1/2 tsp basil as per another review in stead of the shiso, white sesame seeds only, and tilapia filets.  I can only imagine how this recipe would taste with the correct ingredients had I had access to them.  My husband and the other husbands serving us thought that it was quite good also (cold).  I will make this again for my family only with mahi mahi, since mahi mahi for four is not quite as pricey as for 24.

Made this with orange roughy, and my parents really seemed to like it.  I thought that the sauce was really lemony (even with only 1/2 of a large lemon) and way too salty (and I did not add the extra kosher salt), but they thought it was a lovely complement to the fish. I thought it was quite a bt of work - I probably will not make this again.

Absolutely delicious! Though I couldn't find the shiso, I decided to use basil, and it really fit well with the recipe. I've cooked it for 3 people and then for 6, I've always gotten rave reviews!!!

Excellent recipe which I have used with Mahi Mahi and Salmon.  The butter sauce was excellent despite not being able to locate the Shiso in Oklahoma.

Wow. Delicious!  Even my picky 5 yr old asked for thirds but there was no more. I couldn't bring myself to use all the butter so used about 1/3 c. Did not have shiso. Mahi is such a nice, firm fish so I finished it on the grill instead of the oven. Superb. Oh, one more thing...it took me more like 30 min prep- the sauce just takes a some time to complete. It could be done ahead- the actual cook time is quick. Thank you for this recipe!

First, I'm not a fish lover. I do these because it's what the family wants. But this was simple, fast and looked ok. The down side is, the mahi mahi was expensive. This whole meal must have reached $30.00 for just the fish. The sauce was good to me but the family raved about it. It's fun to try the something different and this is one of those. I'll pass on the next round but given everyone else's opinon of it, I'll be making it again.

I adore this unusual Asian-French fusion type recipe and have made it with both mahi mahi and halibut.  (The halibut was better, but the magic sauce makes it pretty delicious no matter what.)  I like to sprinkle my black and white sesame seeds in rows on the plate, so the fish comes out striped.  It looks badass!  Next time I'm gonna try a heart or some other shape.  

Great for guests because it's easy but looks (and tastes) gourmet.

We love this dish! Even if I don't get around to making the sauce, this is an awesome way to prepare mahi.  A little ginger mayo or horseradish on the side and the fish texture is just perfect.  A++

I'm a big fan of using what I have in my kitchen. Substituted half and half for heavy cream, ginger paste (halved the amount) instead of fresh ginger, and poppy seeds instead of black sesame seeds. Turned out amazing!

I was really hoping to give this 5 stars!! Especially after the rave reviews here!! 
Made this tonight and it was fairly easy(didn't have shiso, substituted basil leaves as others did). I've never made any type of fish at all- and never had mahi mahi. The fish was great(giving 3 stars), but the sauce.... egh. It was alright with the perfect amount on the fish(and some on the jasmine rice I prepared as it's side), but if you had too much or tasted it by itself- not too god. Tasting it first, by itself, was a turnoff. That's what takes the most time here, too, so it was a little upsetting/disappointing. My guess is MAYBE subtract some of the soy sauce? It just seemed to overpower the other ingredients- somehow!
My picky 5 year old, however, disagrees. He chowed down and loved it. My mom- which normally gobbles my cooking up- did not like the sauce or the sesame seeds, would've preferred it plain(although she did scrape the seeds off and didn't even put sauce on(just dipped a piece)- said the salt and extra virgin olive oil tasted great by itself. 
The fish came out flaky and juicy and yummy though- given they were frozen from Bottom Dollar, I'm surprised! But considering I can't compare it to fresh, I really can't say about that.

This sauce was great and although it sounds a little hard to do, it really isn't. I took some people's advice and the only changes I made was to add a little cornstarch thickener because it was a little runny, used basil instead of shiso, and I also added wasabi powder (I added 2 tbsp., but I like it spicy) and put it over seared tuna... AMAZING.

This was fantastic! I made it for one so trying to blend it didn't work - I used a whisk instead. I didn't have black sesame seeds, but the regular ones were delicious. I also didn't have the Shiso - but other reviewers said it didn't matter. I will definitely make this again.

I liked the sauce a lot. Of course anything with that much cream and butter is going to be good. Over all a very good recipe.

Would definitely make this again. I found out at the last minute that I only had powdered ginger and I didn't have the shiso but it was a great tasting sauce anyway. The fish was tender and delicious.

Very nice. The reduction is a key to this recipe. Make sure that you reduce it down as stated in the recipe and it turns out delicious. I will make it again!

this recipe by far is the best fish recipe!!  I made this for my husband who was complaining about chicken and beef menues every night.  The taste was fabulous - the sauce can be made ahead the the cook time was quick!  Everyone wants the recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

Very good!  I think next time I will use half a lemon instead.  I used frozen basil from Trader Joes and instead of shallots, I used a red onion.  I took the advice of another review and just made the sauce in a pan instead of a blender.  I served on jasmine rice, it was great!

Wow! I was really impressed with this dish.  I used Opah because it was fresh and used scallion and basil substitutes.  OMG! The fish was good without the sauce but with it was awesome.  I almost licked my plate!!  Thanks so much!  I will be making probably once a week at least.

I prepared this dish for different guests few times.  They all love it so much.  I didn't cook with mahi mahi, I have used seabass and black cod.  They turn out very good.  One of my favourite for sure

This was great...I used talapia instead of mahi mahi and also basil instead of shiso. The ginger butter sauce was the best part. What a great taste. Will definently do again. Thanks.

I have been wanting to try this for ages. We don't really like seafood so I used chicken instead. The sesame crust didn't have a lot of flavour but the sauce was very nice. Used a little Mint & Basil instead of the Shiso and added half a teaspoon of white sugar.

Very, very good.  Sauce seems to have a lot of latitude, because I substituted onions for shallots, and used 1/2 tsp dried ginger (Penzey's China #1) instead of fresh.  So quick and easy -- I made the sauce on my lunch break, then dinner took almost no time to put on the table.  A definite keeper.

This was very good. An unusual but good sauce combining flavors I’ve never tasted together before (wine and cream and basil and mint).

We couldn't get mahi mahi so substituted halibut instead; and also we substituted 1 tablespoon Thai basil and 1 tablespoon mint for the shiso leaves. We loved the sesame crust and the sauce was so good!

My husband loved this dish.  He is an Chief Engineer on mega yachts...He is spoiled with "Chefs"   Again, he loved this and said it would be found on a yacht table for the guests.  So...can you tell he liked it?  He said the sauce was to die for.  I may have jazzed it up a bit.  Used a least double the ginger.  I didn't have the shiso, so I used basil and mint from the garden.  Should have used more...I think.  Next time i will make sure the pan is hotter to sear sesame seeds.  And..Ps..I used grape seed oil  Just be careful not to over cook.

This was amazing. I couldn't find the leaves that were called for, so I substituted basil-- didn't taste anything so I think it's fine to leave off. I felt the mahi-mahi did need a touch more time. It's a much easier dish to make than it appears. I made the sauce ahead of time & reheated it. The kids loved it too, I can't wait to make it again.

MAYBE one of the most delicious meals I've ever eaten. The boyfriend agrees. We subbed sushi-grade tuna steaks for mahi as the mahi at the local grocer looked "off." The sauce is the key. CRAZY delicious, and not difficult! This sauce would be amazing on anything - pork is the next place I want to try it! We did sub basil for shiso and it was great.

Made this last night using the following changes only because of ingredients I did not have.
-Used sesame crunch topper from an epiqure party that I attended.
-Did not have the shiso
-Used salted butter
-Used powdered ginger
-did not put sauce in blender(it is broken)
-Put a little hoisin sauce on the baking sheet.(just for fun)

This was wonderful, I will seek out the proper ingredients next time but I will cook it this way again for sure. Except I have to find out who sells that sesame chrunch topper, I used it all up.

Delicious~ very rich. We forgot to add the shiso but it still turned out great. I think there was too much sauce and sesame seeds.  Maybe half the amount is perfect? Overall, it was so good!

I was quite disappointed. The amount of lemon juice was apparently crucial. "1 lemon juiced" is rather vague... My 1 lemon was large and juicy. I used half of it which overwhelmed all other flavors. I tried adding extra cream and 2 more teaspoons of ginger to no avail. I strongly suggest easing into the lemon...

I thought this was fabulous!  I made it as described in the recipe, but did not have the shiso so I just omitted it.  Seriously.  Really, really good.  Thanks for the recipe, I am adding it to my permanent files!

This is a fantastic recipe for mahi mahi! I did not have shiso (or basil and mint) or white wine, and it still turned out excellent- can't wait to make it again- with all ingredients! I made seems noodles with broccoli as a side but think it would better with some jasmine or brown rice and broccoli as other reviews suggested.

This was a terrific recipe. I have never prepared Mahi Mahi before and this was easy and done to perfection. Very moist and the sauce is yummy! Hubby is not a fish lover and even he was impressed! I could not find shiso leaves so I substituted 1/4 tsp of dried basil, I will continue to look for the shiso leaves though to try the real version!

I made this for a dinner party and got RAVE reviews! Since one of my guests was lactose intolerant, I made two sauces, the original, and one where I replaced the cream and butter with 3/4 cup ripe, mashed avacado. My guests had second helpings of both sauces, and still couldn't decide which they liked better. I replaced the Japanese herb with fresh basil and mint. Thank you for this wonderful treat! The mixed sesames make it a very pretty dish, too.

Easily the best thing I have ever made in my life. I had my guests both begging for the recipe and asking me how long I was hiding these cooking skills. Combined it with stirfry veggies in a thai peanut sauce and rice pilaf. Really, really good. I only changed the shiso for basil since I've never even seen that.

Wow!  This was fabulous!  H did not have Shiso leaves so I substituted 1/4 t. dried basil, and 1/4 t. dried mint.  I sauteed these with the shallots, ginger lemon juice and wine.  I also had no black sesame seeds so used only the white ones.  This turned out great.  I am going to cook it again next week.  Thanks!

I fixed this for my husband and he loved it and said it tasted restaurant quality. I followed the recs of some of the other reviewers. I halved the sauce since it was just me and my hubby, I sub'd fresh basil for shiso, added 1/2 tsp of wasabi powder, used 1/2 small onion for the shallots and i finished the swordfish on the stove top instead of in the oven. I served it with rice and asian vegetable medley. It was great. Will make again!!

OK. We were snowed in; I had 2% milk, no cream. I used basil like another reviewer. This was by far the best sauce for a fish EVER.

OMG! YUM! This is my first review but had to comment on this recipe because this is the sooo delicious, even though I have no idea what shiso leave are and didn't use them and used onions because I didn't have shallots. Soooo delicious. I can't wait to make again with the correct ingredients and see if it is even better.

Wishing there were more than just 5 stars! I made this for my daughter and me,we took 1 bite and just looked @ each other,knowing I stumbled on a keeper! I am cutting back on calories and fat,used skim milk in place of cream and used only 1/4 cup butter.Didn't have white wine,used red(shiraz). Didn't have shiso leaves,used 1/2 teaspoon dried basil.Still made a fantastic sauce. Only had 2 good sized mahi-mahi filets,used 2 salmon filets along w/  mahi-mahi. .Didn't have black sesame seeds.just used reg. sesame seeds. When wind chill factor is -10*, us snowbirds make do w/ what is in the house! Can't wait to impress family and friends w/ this one!

This is an exceptional dish! In fact I am currently making it for about the 6th time. My Fiancee and I just love it! The only thing I change is I sear it in sesame instead of canola for a little bit more of that sesame flavor. Don't try to make this dish healthy!! I did and it was not NEARLY as good. Just let this be a special treat! That is what it is in our house. Also the sauce goes GREAT over mashed potatoes so I usually make something the next day with mashed potatoes just so I can use the leftover sauce.

Fantastic flavor.  My husband said "this is the mother of all sauces."  I didn't use the black sesame seeds, shiso leaves or kosher salt because I couldn't find any.  Instead, used extra white sesame seeds and regular table salt.  Still came out wonderful, but next time I will use about half the salt.  This is by far our favorite mahi recipe now!

The sauce was awesome!  I went to Costco (they have the best fish) and they were out of Mahi Mahi so I used Halibut filets.  It was still delicious.  I will make this again.  his was delicious.

This recipe was amazing! The flavors melt together and perfectly compliment one another. We put the Mahi Mahi on a bed of Jasmine rice with steamed fresh green beans as a side. This recipe is a keeper!

My family and I thought this was good, but not exceptional. I do agree with the other reviewers that this is restaurant-quality food. That being said, restaurant-quality food is -and should be- rarely, if ever, as good as homemade. Should we decide to give it a try again, I'll definitely make some substitutes for all the fat and cut the salt; unfortunately, this also resembles a restaurant meal with its high saturated fat and sodium content.

The sauce is quite incredible. I followed one reviewer's advice and used two small lemons instead of just one, and that made it way too tart! I had to add sugar to balance it out, but that ended up adding a nice touch of sweetness.

This sauce is excellent.  I couldn't find shiso leaves, I used some cilantro instead, but it was heavenly!  However, I would suggest pan searing in butter, not oil, because I think butter makes a much nicer crust.

This was good, this was a fussy recipe, I didn't think it was exceptionally good. I used Red Snapper fish.  I couldn't find 'japanese basil', I used thai basil, wonder if it made a difference.  Served this with japanese sushi rice and mashed asian butternut.

I just made this & we loved it, but I did something wrong. First of all, I thought the fish I was cooking with was Dorado (Mahi Mahi).. *my husband is a fisherman, so we have all kinds of fish in our freezer* but he had given me sea bass to thaw out last night instead of Dorado. Now don't get me wrong, Sea Bass is a great tasting fish, the only thing is: it's a bit more 'meaty' than Dorado, so this recipe sort of dried it out which Dorado wouldn't have. It still tasted great...my husband & I thought the next time I make it (w/Sea bass) I'd do everything the same, except after searing the fish, I'd put it in the oven w/that great sauce poured over it, so it absorbed some of the sauce, instead of using the sauce just as a side.  Other than that, this was great! The sesame seads were great and again the sauce was awesome! Thanx for the recipe.

This was awesome with Tuna. I got some bluefin tuna right off the boat and knew it was meant to be seared. If you make this with tuna just coat with the sesame seeds and pan sear each side for 45 secs. There is no need to bake tuna. I made the following modifications for a smoewhat healthier/not so rich sauce and accented taste: Leeks for shallots/ Real grated organic giner root/ Low fat milk for heavy cream (with the butter you really don't need the cream)/Cut the butter portion by 1/4 and used Smart Balance spread for the remaining amount/ 1 extra tbsp reduced sodium soy sauce/ Cilantro instead of Shiso/ Organic Olive Oil cooking spray/2 tsp real wasabi paste.
I served it with some miso-leek-nori soup and seaweed salad. AMAZING!!!!

I only made the sauce, but it was awesome. I actually tweaked this a bit because of the lack of my own ingredients. I added only 2 green onions, 2 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger, regular white wine and guessed on the bottled lemon juice, and added one Trader Joes frozen chopped basil cube instead of the shiso leaves and part salted butter and part unsalted (since I did not have enough unsalted). Everything else the same. I did nothing in blender, but all in the saucepan. This was easy for me and it tasted wonderful! I will make again.

This dish took longer to make even with the help of my husband and my sauce didn't quite thicken and I used basil instead of shiso (whatever that is). AND SO WORTH THE TROUBLE!!! It was a great meal, in fact my husband declared it the best dinner of our three year marriage.

My family really enjoyed this!   My two sons are home from college for a couple weeks, and I made this special recipe using tilapia and fresh basil, and it was so good.  We liked the pungent lemon flavor.  The toasted sesame crust is also a real treat!

I was actually quite disappointed with this recipe; however, I'm young and haven't cooked a ton, so it could just be that I am too inexperienced and was too amitious with this recipe. I did thing the sauce was quite tasty, but I think I used WAY too much white pepper which ruined the taste for me. Next time, I might try the sauce on another fish for a more tasty meal. My boyfriend kept raving that he loved the meal, but he was  probably just being nice.

I couldn't find shiso leaves either, so I used a combination of fresh basil and mint. The sauce tasted good, but I would definitely like to try it with the proper ingredient. I made this with tuna steaks as that's what I had on hand. We had this with Shieldzini (cucumber salad) from this site, and noodles. Thanks, Ryan!
