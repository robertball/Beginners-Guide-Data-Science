This recipe definitely is worth trying!  It has so much flavor to add to the fish, and it is baked right into it.  I cooked this with mashed sweet potatoes on the side, and some parmesan baked squash and zucchini...this makes for a colorful and tasteful meal!!!  You have GOT to try it.

Instead of using the Cajun Seasoning and thyme leaves listed in the recipe, I substituted approx. 1 tablespoon of Bayou Blast, a.k.a. Emeril Lagasse's Essence mixture (2 1/2 tablespoons paprika, 2 tablespoons salt, 2 tablespoons garlic powder, 1 tablespoon black pepper, 1 tablespoon onion powder, 1 tablespoon cayenne pepper, 1 tablespoon dried oregano, 1 tablespoon dried thyme). My husband always keeps some Bayou Blast on hand in a little plastic tub, and it's a tried-and-true addition to any Cajun recipe we try. That was the only thing I changed about this recipe, and the result was excellent! One of the best catfish recipes I've tried, and I've done a bunch of them.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  With every bite came a different level of taste...the lemon juice really added a nice "zing" to it.  We accidentally used 1/2 the amount of pecans (because we doubled the recipe) and it still turned out fantastic.  The only thing that we did not like about it was that when the fish flesh was flaky, the breadcrumb coating was still gummy and we ended up having to finish it off by pan-frying.  Other than that, it's a great recipe!

This recipe was EASY and TASTY! I wanted a catfish recipe that called for baking instead of panfrying. I am always a little cautious when it comes to baked fish, but with the New Year resolutions to eat better... I needed to try something new. This was yummy. My husband and I ate every speck of the fish. We will definately serve this one up again and again.

Delicious!  I purchased "cajun" catfish filets that were preseasoned at the market so I didn't add the cajun seasoning called for in the recipe.  Also used sweet & spicy pecans I baked in a soy sauce, Tabasco & brown sugar mixture which added additional flavor.  Add a garnish of sliced lemons and parsley and it's company worthy !!!

This recipe was very quick, easy, and very tasty.  My family said it was like eating something from a restaurant.  It made a "middle of the week" dinner a treat.  I served it with wild rice (from a box) and steamed broccoli.

I'm not big on "hot" food, so I substituted Old Bay for the cajun seasoning.  I thought it gave the dish the right peppery flavor without being overpowering.  The combination of the seasoning and pecans was really nice.  Might want to think twice about squeezing some lemon juice over the finished product, I found it overpowered  the other flavors.  Can't wait to share this with my boyfriend!

I really liked this recipe and the family loved it as well.  I used a little extra parmesan cheese because we love cheese.  The flavors were great and I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was only OK for me. It didn't seem to have enough flavor, or at least enough of the right kind. The pecans seem to overpower the cajun.

This dish tasted just like that of a local restaurant. I made it with tilapia fillet and it was just as good. I used red pepper infused oil instead of olive oil and it added a nice flavor.

This recipe is far better than fish from most restaraunts....absolutely wonderful...such a unique blend of spices and flavors and textures....

It is also disgustingly easy to make...in 30 minutes i can have a full meal ready.....

It does well with tilapia, salmon and mahi mahi too....

My husband and I are trying to eat more fish but its hard when there are only so many healthy ways to prepare it.  My husband and I LOVED this recipe and it only took about 5 min to prepare and it was done in 15 minutes!  I highly recommend it.

I will make this again, but the topping was so rich that I will have to alter it a tiny bit. I think I added to much lemon and too much salt.  I'd try it on salmon too! Good base recipe to work on! Thanks!

This was a fantastic recipe. My husband is a critic when it comes to my cooking and I got 2 thumbs up on this one. I used grouper instead of catfish...

Easy to make and tastes GREAT!  I have also made by omitting the oil, exchange bread crumbs for cornmeal, added lemon pepper and pan-fried.  It's yummy both ways.

Loved this recipe.  Simple to prepare yet very tasty.  One kid loved it, other one thought it was too spicy but she doesn't like spicy food.  The rest of us liked the "kick" that the cajun seasoning added.

This was an excellent recipe for catfish.  I used nuggets, not filets, and walnuts, instead of pecans (hey, use what you have...).  We LOVED it.  Let it get a little crunchy on the edges and it's perfect.

Very easy. The pecan/cajun seasoning combo was a little weird at first, but I got used to it. I think I was expecting something w/ some sweetness b/c of the pecans. Next time I'll try a little brown sugar as someone suggested.

Excellent, I double the amount of pecans and I thought the recipe didn't make enough mixture to put on top of the fish so I doubled that also to give it a nice rich flavor. Also when finished I drizzled a little lemon juice on top.
