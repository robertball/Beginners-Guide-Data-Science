This is my recipe, and they did not include 3 green onions to the ingredients. I have contacted them but they have never fixed it. So, add 3 green onions to ingredients and chop it up with everything else. Also the water can be adjusted to how thick you like your sauce. I usually start with a half cup and add to my consistency.

I thought this salsa was awesome!  I mainly followed the recipe, except substituted lettuce for cabbage.  I loved the taste of poblanos in this salsa.

Not bad, but not great. A little too much avocado for me, and I love avocado. Next time, I would decrease the amount. The spice is perfect, though.

PERFECT!!! I made this recipe last night and I can't stop eating it! I made the salsa exactly as the recipe stated (except maybe a little light on the salt), using my own home-grown poblanos and jalapenos. I was impressed by how quick and easy it was to make, especially when compared to traditional salsas. The flavor was outstanding! It was the cool, creamy flavor of a good guacamole followed by a nice kick of spice. I would almost qualify this recipe as closer to a spicy guacamole than a salsa. I can't wait to make this for my next house party! This may not replace the salsa at my next party, but it will definitely be my new go-to guacamole dip!

WOW fantastic flavor! I was looking for the recipe for the green (avacado jalapeno tasting) sauce we always got at the taco truck down the street.  This is exactly like it.  I love it on tacos, as a dip or on tamales. I didn't know what hass avacados were and I think I used to big of avacados because mine was very thick so I had to thin it with more water.  But it was still very spicy and tasty! This will be a staple in our house for sure.  My husband took it to work and everyone wants me to make them some. I did add a little lemon juice to keep the avacado from turning brown as it started to do on the top, just a couple table spoons. Great taste!

For me, it needed the juice of two limes and four poblanos, two per the recipe and two roasted, gutted, and skinned. Mmmmmm tasty.  I seeded my japalenos two and went with less water.  Makes a great chip dip.

added some anaheim peppers and red onion, seeded the jalepenos. just enough kick for those with spicy taste but mild enough for those who aren't so spicy.  None left.  Great on fish, pork and chicken as a condiment.

I also cut the water to a 1/4 cup and added approximately  1/4 cup of fresh lime juice.  I think this is what the recipe was missing.

I go to Laredo, TX for work and eat at a little taco stand outside of a truck stop there. They make a salsa of butter, peppers and cilantro. I love the stuff but wanted a healthier option. This is it! WOW! I omitted the lettuce, doubled the peppers (for my tastes) and still added about 1 C melted butter. This stuff is knock your socks off good.

First, I agree with the original "owner" Nia, it certainly doesn't need a full cup of water; would be way to thin.  I used 1/2 c and the consistancy was good.  But on taste?  I followed exactly, including the 1/2 c water and 3 green onions, just seemed like it needed something, like something was missing....not sure what yet.

This is great. Cool and refreshing. I added an extra Poblano, and a Pardon Pepper. I also added a Tomatillo. That added some zest.  was wondering why it didn't have onions, after reading the review by Nia, I know to use onions next time.

Delicious. I skipped the serrano (store didn't have any) and seeded the jalpenos (but didn't work too hard at getting the seeds out).  It was quick and we really liked it.  Next time I may try it with a lettuce that has some nutritional value.

I used the original recipe and it is spicy enough for my taste and mild enough that my wife can also enjoy it. In future batches I may use recommendations of other fans of this dish but I really enjoy as is!

As it is ok. I left out the lettuce and Serrano, roasted the jalapenos,THREE poblanos, and a bit of onion and it was fantastic. I would have preferred serranos to jalapenos but not everyone in the family can handle that much heat :)
