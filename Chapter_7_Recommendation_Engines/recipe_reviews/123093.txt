I loved this soup, very simple and so healthy. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for the recipe Gayle! UPDATE 6/04/09: Just wanted to let you know that this soup freezes really well, I have made a couple of batches and I freeze in individual containers.

I've had my eye on this recipe for about a week now, and was finally able to make it. It is as yummy as I thought it would be. I did add a clove of garlic, but I add garlic to almost everything. lol. I also subbed sage for the basil because I realized that I was out of basil, and I thought sage would go well with the sweet potato. (It does!) I will definitely be making this again!

This is delicious.  Mine was quite thick, more like baby food, but I'm sure that was because my sweet potatoes were generous in size.  I ended up using almost 6 cups of chicken broth to get it to soup consistency.  I would recommend having more broth on hand in case it's needed at the end.

I love this recipe and have made it many times, the only change I make is that I leave out the oil to save on fat. Even my kids like it!

Yum! This is one of my favorite soup recipes! It is delicious just as written; I used olive oil and cut the amount down to about a tsp. with delicious results. Next time I make it I will try it without using any oil at all. Give this recipe a try; it is a wonderful and healthy way to eat more sweet potatoes!

Yum. I made this recipe vegetarian by using veg. broth. It tastes just like a cream based soup but is way healthier. Also I wanted to double it but I was two sweet potatoes short; I used 4 sweet potatoes and 2 regular potatoes and it turned out great.

This was a hit with my family. I used 1lb of sweet potatoes (2 large instead of the 3 medium) and that seemed to work well with the measurements of the rest of the ingredients.  Make sure you get the "threads" out of the celery because they don't blend (I missed some and had a few strings in my soup,  but no big deal). I used an immersion blender instead of a food processor and saved the reheating step. I would suggest serving with cinnamon to sprinkle/shake on top. Thanks for the recipe, it was a good one!!

used 1lb 4 oz sweet potatoes and fresh basil.  I dropped the oil put all ingredients in the crockpot on low for 9 hours.  Recipe just enough for 3 no left overs. change prep time to 15 minutes.  Added some fresh grated nutmeg to second bowl not really wow different.  Will do again ever time I make chicken stock(did have fresh stock)

A nice simple healthy soup.  Other then adding garlic, I made it as posted.  Everyone ate it, there were no complaints, but no compliments either.

Very tasty & perfect for a chilly evening.  It tastes great as is, but I have a hubby who loves cinnamon so I put a few dashes in at the very end & served it garnished with some scallions.  My husband had also just grilled some chicken so I put a small handful of cubed chicken at the bottom of each bowl & poured the soup over it.  Wonderful!  I'm saving this recipe & looking forward to making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good.  I added a dash of pepper.  Next time, I would leave the salt out (even though I used low sodium chicken broth), as my husband thought it was a bit too salty.

I really liked this soup - it's very filling and healthy to boot.  The first couple times I made this I misread the recipe and used four sweet potatoes instead of three, and liked it just as much.  It's better with fresh basil (but what isn't?).

i was very impressed with this soup. it was kind of a pain to use the blender, but otherwise, this was easy to make, smelled good and is filling. i added a little extra salt and basil because the amounts seemed to small, but they're just probably fine as written too.

Tasty, healthy, and easy.  Very thick, if made as is - next time I will thin it a bit.  My partner was surprised how creamy it was with no cream or milk in the recipe.  I'd like to tinker with the sweetness and spices a bit, but it's fine as is also, depending upon what flavor one is looking for.

Loved it. Used white sweet potatoes that I precooked, mashed and added a bit of butter. Seasoned with garlic, ginger and paprika with a dash of curry.

This soup is very good  but slightly bland. Since the texture is similar to split pea soup, I added some freshly ground black pepper and it was great!

I used coconut milk in order to make this soup vegan - it made it thicker and richer and turned out terrific! I also doubled the recipe and I brought it to Thanksgiving Dinner and everyone loved it - leftovers were gone within 2 days.

Simple to make!
Some suggestions: I sauteed the sweet potato cubes with the onion and celery. Also, I added all my spices (hint of curry, cumin, garlic powder, and pepper) during the saute step to infuse the flavors into the veggies more.
Served it in a bread bowl.

This turned out quite a bit better than I expected, as I'm not at all a fan of sweet potatoes.  First, I added an extra cup of water after reading all of the baby food comments,  Then, I tried to get away with mashing the potatoes in the pot rather than running it through the blender - that didn't turn out well at all.  Finally, I puree'd it as suggested, and couldn't believe the difference in flavor!  I added a dash of cayenne, and topped it with chopped cashews.  Delicious!  My husband even had seconds, and he's less enthusiastic about sweet potatoes than I am!  Will definitely make this again.

Solid, easy to follow recipe, plenty of flavor from the sweet potato and onions.  I added a bit of allspice and cinammon to give a more Autumn spin to the dish.  Instead of dried basil, I used a handful of fresh basil that I added to the cooked soup prior to pureeing it in the food processor.  I also added in some fresh corn after pureeing.  Despite the additions, I think the recipe would work very well as is.  The absence of butter or cream is not missed, as the sweet potatoes themselves give a thick, smooth, hearty texture to the soup.

Quick and delicious. I substituted sage for the basil and added 1 tsp of minced garlic and 1/2 T of curry powder. Fantastic! Even my 18 month old loved it! Will definitely be making this again.

This soup was delicious! I am the type who can never leave well enough alone so I added about 1 tsp. chopped celery leaf, some chopped baby carrots (3-4 larger ones), a clove of garlic chopped, and used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Thanks to previous rater who mentioned this freezes well, I have half a batch in the freezer as we speak. I will absolutely make this again!

This was such a great recipe! Very, very simple, but very, very good! I roasted the sweet potatoes first (cut in half length-wise and put skin-side up on a baking sheet, bake @ 400 for ~25min, then peel skin off. Gives such a great flavor, definitely worth the time!), and I also added some carrots, and used an immersion blender (such a great invention!). Served them with Cranberry-Apple muffins from this site, and it was a very fulfilling, flavor-filled meal. Will definitely make this again (and again, and again!) :)

Delicious and easy. Mine turned out rather thick but the potatoes I used were pretty large, as another reviewer commented something similarly. I suggest simply toggling the amount of chicken broth depending on what consistency you like.

So awesome! I'm new to cooking/making soup and I could do this. I cubed the sweet potatoes before putting them in the oven. Next time, I will peel them first because the skin is hard to get off without a fat on it while baking. I also did not have celery and used a complete small onion. I did not use any oil. I broiled some cashews in the oven on a cookie sheet for 5 minutes to release some of their oils, put that in the blender, and grounded them up until they were practically dust before adding the soup contents. Added some all spice and hot sauce. Fabulous! I'm definitely making this again!!

I love this soup and make it all the time.  It is healthy and tasty.  Sometimes I add additional vegetables to it if I have some extras in my fridge that I want to use.  The only other thing I do differently is use Canola oil instead of vegetable oil.  I would recommend this to everyone.  It is a good way to get your veggies for the day!

My husband loved it. That alone makes it a five star. Unbelievably easy and so so so tasty.
