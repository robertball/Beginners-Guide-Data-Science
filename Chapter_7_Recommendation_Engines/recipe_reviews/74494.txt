Yum.  This recipe was great.  I reduced the amount of butter used but other than that, I didn't chage a thing.  Thank you for a quick and easy weeknight fish recipe.  This one is a keeper folks  :)

This recipe worked out okay, and the flavor was also okay. I just discovered that the only way I like catfish is cornbread battered and fried. Probably more me than anything wrong with the recipe.

I've been using a variation of this receipe for years.  Try adding Cajun seasoning in place of the pepper for a real kick!!

This was the first time I have ever made fish. It was absolutely delicious.  Even my picky toddlers ate it!
