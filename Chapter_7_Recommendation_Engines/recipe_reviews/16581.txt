I make this chicken all the time - my kids say it's their favorite! It is good, and very easy, but I recommend pre-cooking the bacon otherwise it's just too soggy. Every time I make it, I use about 1/2 to 3/4 of a bottle of BBQ sauce (and I use hickory instead of honey, because I always buy hickory smoked bacon and when I tried it with the honey BBQ sauce, it was nasty). I usually cook 2 slices of bacon per chicken breast and that's plenty enough. I bake the chicken in the BBQ sauce while cooking the bacon on the stove, and then add the bacon during the last 10 minutes or so of baking.

I chopped up bacon and onions and cooked until very brown. I mixed this into the barbeque sauce and then poured the sauce over the chicken. I covered with aluminum foil and it was done in 30 minutes. I added a piece of crispy bacon on top and some cheddar cheese which I let melt in the oven. It was very good! My boyfriend licked his plate clean!! We used KC Original BarBQ Sauce

I don't understand how this recipe got such good ratings.  It is a very simple recipe and i followed it exactly.  It was just plain horrible!  It was like chicken swimming in a sea of hot barbeque sauce and bacon fat and the bacon did not get crispy - i even turned the broiler on for a few minutes.   please don't waste your time and money on this one.

When the submitter suggested serving this with macaroni and cheese and tater tots or French fries, I knew it would be best to skip it. I tried it anyway, though, and I was right in the first place. The addition of the flavorful bacon is a good idea, but DEFinitely cook the bacon first. The cooking time was most assuredly inadequate. Best not to use this recipe, unless substantially modified. And then you'd have an entirely different recipe, wouldn't you.

This recipe was pretty good. I read the reviews before hand so I cut the sauce in half and used a half pound of bacon that I pre-cooked for 2 minutes in the microwave. I also just brushed the sauce on the chicken then put the bacon on top with out any more sauce. I think next time I will reduce the cooking time by 10 minutes or so... it was a bit overdone. Also, I think I will cook the bacon even longer before I put it in the oven. But overall, pretty good!

Wow, this was great and so simple I alost past it by.

I didn't have honey bbq sauce so I just made it myself using honey and bullseye bold.
I used chicken thigh, the dark meat goes well with the bbq sauce, and the extra cooking time makes sure the bacon cooks and bbq sauce caramalizes.   I also chopped some onion into the sauce.

Easy. I used bullseye honey garlic. I partially precooked the bacon, topped each chicken breast with 1 slice of bacon put on the bbq sauce and baked for 35 min. next time I might throw some cheese on it the last few minutes and garnish with scallions.

This was great and couldn't be easier.  Because of past reviews, I partially cooked the bacon first in the microwave so it could all be served with the chicken.  I used 1/2 lb. bacon instead of 1 lb. and it was more than enough.

I have been making a version of this for years. When I make it, I first cook the chicken covered in foil without sauce for about 30 minutes while frying bacon in skillet until done, along with diced onions. When the chicken is done, I add bbq sauce (i use sweet baby rays original recipe, as it goes great with this recipe), top with the cooked bacon and onion and some shredded cheddar. Then I pop it back in the oven long enough to melt the cheese. The submitter is right, it does pair well with mac & cheese. (but it is not a "trailer park" meal). I serve mine with mac &cheese OR wild rice and pineapple is a perfect compliment to this dish. HIGHLY recommended!!! (with the alterations I use my whole family gives this a five star rating!)

It was easy to make and pretty good.  Not the best dish ever, but I'll probably use the recipe again when I need something in a hurry. If you need an easy, no fuss recipe, try this one. The disappointing part was that none of the bacon got crispy.  I suggest putting the bacon on top instead of the remaining sauce.

I believe the different reviews comes from using a bitter or bad BBQ sauce.  I had bought a honey mustard BBQ sauce and it taste horrrible!!!!  I had a bottle of  KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce and I added a tsp of honey.  The recipe tasted really good.

I didn't like this recipe the way it was written, however I wrapped the chicken in bacon, holding it with toothpicks, then grilled it and basted it with bbq sauce. The flavor was better and the bacon was crisp.

I grilled the chicken (basting with bbg sauce while cooking)and when the chicken was almost done, then I placed the bacon across the chicken(which I had already cooked till almost crispy, precooked bacon works well too.)Brushed on a little more bbq sauce. You can secure the bacon with toothpicks. Grill a few more minutes. This gives the bacon a nice smoke flavor. Garlic mashed potatoes is a great side.

Cooked bacon and onions in skillet beforehand to brown, added to bbq sauce. Then cooked in slow cooker and made into sandwiches with whole wheat buns. Was delicious! Will be making this again, thanks!

Too much sauce for me.  The bacon didn't come out crispy because of all the sauce, but otherwise very good.  Next time I'd use half the amount of sauce.

I make a similar recipe and it's really pretty good, you just need to adjust it to your taste.  I salt and pepper lightly pounded chicken breasts, layer a single strip of bacon over each, and then I brush the BBQ sauce over each piece (on top of the bacon).  The bacon doesn't get super crispy, but neither does the bacon on a filet mignon. It's more about the flavor.  

It's a great recipe for those days when your plans to bbq get rained out.  My family really enjoy it served with baked beans and garlic bread.

I am sorry to give a bad report on this recipe, but this recipe was awful! There was WAY too much bacon fat on the chicken. I tried to pat down the bacon with a napkin but it didnt work. I honestly would not recommend this recipe to any of my family or friends. -Please do not waste your time and money on this recipe. =[

This is a great recipe. You don't need all the barbeque sauce, a half bottle is more than enough.  I don't eat pork, but turkey bacon turned out very good.  Great on sandwiches too!!

This does need many modifications so I have to give it a very low rating.  The bacon does not get crispy at all the way the recipe is written.  And it definitely calls for too much sauce.

This was just OK. The chicken comes out juicy but bland. If I ever make this again I will put a good dry rub on the chicken first. Adding some sliced onion may help also, but nobody in my family would eat it then *sigh*. Maybe this would make a good scout camp dinner in a Dutch oven and something spicy to liven it up

My family loved this!  I used 1 pack of pre-cooked bacon to cut out some of the grease and Original KC BBQ Sauce and it was 5 stars!  This was so simple and everyone loved it - even my picky kiddos!

The idea is good but you definitely have to tweek it. Cook bacon first unless you like soggy rubbery bacon. Dont use the honey bacon unless you really like it. Works much better on a grill than in your oven.

I only gave it a 3 star because I had to make numerous modifications to make it non-blah.  But it is a great springboard recipe.

I had the same problem as another poster. I followed the directions and when it came out, it was a mess of bacon floating in BBQ grease. We tried to salvage dinner but I wouldn't try this again. There seemed to be just too much juices happin' at once.

This recipe is good, but it's even better if you top everything off with shredded cheddar cheese.  After it's done, you can serve it with diced red onions and tomatoes on top.

I took the advice of other's and precooked the bacon till it was crispy. Then laid it on top of the chicken and BBQ sauce. Came out very good! Easy to make.

This was a big hit with our family.  Our 17 year old said it was the best chicken he ever had.  I went back for seconds and it was gone.  We will be making this again.

Very good.  I read reviews where they said the bacon didn't get cooked.  So I opted to cook bacon first, chop and add to sauce.  I read this in review #2.  Per that reviewer I also added some diced sauteed onion to the sauce.  Baked until meat thermometer read 165 (which was about 45 minutes).  My husband who usually dislikes BLSL said he really liked it because the chicken was so moist.  Topped each piece with some pieces of bacon, which added a nice crunch.  Everyone devoured this!  Yum!

Very tasty.  After reading the reviews I poured half the bottle of barbecue sauce in the bottom of a baking dish.  Then I partially cooked the bacon and wrapped chicken strips in the bacon.  I then baked everything for 30 minutes.  I then poured the other half of the barbecue sauce on top.  The bacon was crispy because it was baked without the sauce on top   It was a hit!

Altred it for my own variation, and it turned out delicious!  I fried the bacon first, then crumbled it into the bbq sauce, which I used some dr. pepper bbq sauce, added some onion powder, garlic powder, and black pepper, stirred it all up, then poured it onto the chicken, then baked it on 350 for 45 min.  it was amazing!!

Love this recipe!!! On a personal note precook the bacon before putting on the chicken and I also added onions. The best barbeque sauce to use is sweet baby rays

I tried this recipe for a quick meal to make for a weeknight dinner afterwork and the chicken was great. Only problem next time I would cook the bacon maybe just a few sec in the micorwave. Also I let my chicken breast sit in pineapple juice for 30 mins .. Thanks for the recipe. Kids love it husband love it . and for lunch it was great as a chicken sandwich..

This was an instant hit the first time I cooked for my mom, brother, and uncle for the fourth of July almost two years ago. My brother loved it so much that he asked for the recipe so his girlfriend could make for him once he moved to Illinois. It also made the mouths drool of my ex's coworkers. I just suggest wrapping the bacon around the chicken and then putting the BBQ sauce over everything. It keeps the chicken from drying out.

This has become one of my favorite recipes that I pulled from this website.   My family did find that the BBQ sauce was a bit strong, so instead of completely soaking the chicken in sauce, I actually brush the BBQ sauce onto the meat.  It takes longer to prepare but it leaves the chicken with a good flavor without completely overpowering the meat.   I also wrap the bacon around the chicken and serve as is - not the best if you're looking for crunchy bacon - but definitely filled with flavor.

I made this dish for dinner today and it came out really good! My husband gave it great reviews! However, I did change it up a little after I read a couple of reviews. First of all, I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder and seasoning salt, secondly, I browned the bacon and chicken a little before putting in the oven. Lastly, I put BBQ sauce both on the chicken and above the bacon. It came out great and will definitely be making it again!

Since so many people commented that this was bland I added some seasoning.  I laid my chicken in the pan and covered each with 1-2 strips of bacon depending on how big the piece of chicken.  Then I put onions over the top and sprinkled it all with salt, pepper, and chili powder and baked for 30 min. I cooked the rest of the bacon with some onions and the same seasoning in a skillet and put them on top of the chicken at the end under the broiler for just a couple minutes.  Turned out great.

My son and I liked it, but my husband said it was bland. If you ate the chicken without a piece of the bacon, then it could of used something else with it.

This was a hit at my house! Between my husband, me and my two kids we are ALL picky eaters and all like and dislike different things so it was AMAZING to have a meal that EVERYONE in my house liked with no complaints! I agree with a lot of people that say you should cook the bacon a little before baking it with the chicken. I fried the bacon about half way then took it out and put it on the chicken. It made the bacon crisp but also let it cook on the chicken to give the chicken a little more flavor.

A very ggod recipe, and I agree with other reviewers - you have to use quality BBQ sauce. It must be thick; hickory works as well as honey. Also, full bottle is too much - use less on the chicken, and add bacon on the top. If you wish to have more BBQ flavor on the bacon, carefully brush the strips with sauce - that way they'll be crisp at the end. You can make any chicken pieces this way, and even full chicken / cornish hen. Will definitely make again!

My husband and I really liked this dish.  I only cooked 3 brests, used chicken seasoning salt and ground pepper.  I used about 1/2 cup of honey mustard barbecue sauce and 1/2 cup of honey barbecue sauce.  I also like my bacon crispy so I fried 6/7 slices first.
I also put a couple slices of onion on top of the brests first, then the sauce, then the crispy bacon (which stayed crispy) and cooked as instructed. I served it with corn and some candied carrots.  Will definitely  make again.

My suggestion is to cook the bacon forst on the chicken turning it once too insure that it is cooked...then drain the bacon grease off and baste it with the bbq sauce before serving. I realize that this takes a little more time, but it insures a better product.

I cut this down to 2 servings and used no where near a full bottle of sauce, and it was still really strong. I cooked some turkey bacon and diced onions to top my chicken, baked at 350 for 20 minutes, very good!

The bacon lends flavor to the chicken and the bbq sauce makes the bacon sweet and delicious. If you want crisy bacon cook it on top. Quick, easy, and delicious.

This is the best chicken recipe that I have ever made.  My fiencee that doesn't like chicken loved this, and was a big hit with my 2yr old and 8yr old.  I will make this again very soon.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This was soooo easy.  I did cook the bacon in microwave for 3 minutes prior to oven and used turkey bacon.  WE loved it.  Ate it with rice and veggies for dinner and on a bun for lunch the next day!

I put about half the bottle on the bottom of the dish, added chicken & then poured other half on top.  Also seasoned with salt & pepper.  I had plenty of sauce for 6 boneless chicken breast.  I added precooked bacon toward the end.

This was a hit with my family. Dh, my three sons, and my dad loved it. Dd didn't like it, but she just doesn't like barbecue sauce. I rarely eat meat, so I didn't try it. I used six chicken breast halves, about 2/3 lb of bacon (my chicken was completely covered), and approximately 3/4 bottle of Kraft Honey Hickory Smoke barbecue sauce. When I took the dish out of the oven and saw the bacon, I thought it wouldn't get eaten, because my family doesn't usually like chewy bacon. I was shocked when my pickiest eater said that he loved the bacon and begged me to fix the recipe again soon. Next time I'll precook the bacon about halfway, though.

Simple, basic ingredients and tasty.  My husband really liked it too.  I used the precooked bacon and just covered the top of the chicken with the sauce.  A whole bottle sounded like way too much BBQ sauce.

I'm only giving this four stars because I didn't follow the exact recipe.  I thought a whole bottle of bbq sauce sounded like a lot and thought the whole idea of this recipe would come out better on a grill.  I brushed the chicken with bbq sauce, wrapped two bacon slices around each one, secured the slices with toothpicks and tossed on the grill.  Came out great and will definitely make again!

I made this recipe quite some time ago, and for some reason never reviewed it.  Very easy and good recipe.  My picky little guy even enjoyed it.  Precook your bacon a little bit to make it crispy.

Wouldn't make this again. Next time, I'll just baste my chicken with BBQ sauce and grill, which is much better than swimming in sauce and topped with soggy hard-to-cut bacon.

I cant complain about the chicken...bacon yes...chicken no. I used the BBQ sauce on the site (omars bbq chicken. The chicken was moist. The bacon and chicken combo not so hot....maybe if the bacon was crisp it would have a better taste....who knows...not me.

This is good but you MUST pre-cook the bacon.  It is a simple dish that is great when you don't have a lot of time to stand over the stove and "cook".  My 5 yr. old niece helped me with this one....and liked it.  We will use again.  Thanks for the post.

EXCELLENT! This was absolutely great. Without a doubt you must precook the bacon at least half way. I made the following modifications: 1) Sliced the bacon in half and precooked it in a frying pan. 2) Sliced up red onions and mixed it up in the bbq sauce.. Very very good..

Boy am I torn!  The whole point of putting the bacon on before cooking it is so the fat will render and lend its awesome flavor to the chicken.  You also screw up the easy factor by having to fry the bacon before you put it on the chicken.  The chicken was very moist and flavorful.  I used Kraft Spicy Honey BBQ sauce and found the flavor perfect.  I am upset that not even the top pieces of bacon crisped.  I think next time I will use half the bacon and only put a drizzle of sauce on top to help it carmalize.  Maybe even broil it a few minutes at the end, next time?  Overall the flavor was great and it was so easy to make.  I just hated all the limp inedible bacon.

My husband likes this more than I do.  I microwaved the bacon for 2.5 min and only cooked the chicken for 35 minutes based on previous suggestions.  It came out cooked properly, just nothing I would especially rave about.

Easy & good.  I precoooked the bacon in the microwave for about 2-1/2 min, and only used 1/4 lb.  I used about 3/4 of the bottle of bbq sauce.

My Husband loved this recipe, but he is very fond of bbq sauce which might be a main factor.  I only had plain no-name brand bbq sauce but I added a dash of honey to it to sweeten it up a little.  I found this recipe very easy to make, and with a side of steakhouse chips made a very enjoyable meal.  I would have to say that you must at least like BBQ sauce to enjoy this.

Overall, the sauce came out tasty.  The only problem with this recipe is that it calls for A LOT of bacon (3/4 of which you can't eat because the recipe states to only serve the top layer of bacon).  I'm not sure I'll use this recipe again it seems a bit wasteful on the bacon.

This is a wonderful. easy recipe, but I feel that 1lb of bacon is a little too much.  It makes it a little too greay.  However, the chicken is really juicy and tender.  Overall, a true winner!!

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is easy, and none of the ingedients are distasteful to children.  I'm all about shortcuts for those of us rushing in from work that don't have much prep time.  Try using the already cooked bacon.  (the kind you put in the microwave to crisp before eating)  It works great, crisps nicely, doesn't require cooking first, and part of the bacon fat is already cooked out of it.  Also, try sprinkling some cheddar cheese on the chicken the last few minutes of baking.  This recipe also makes a fantastic, and somewhat sloppy, sandwich similar to restaurant "Western Chicken" type sandwiches.

This was delicious!!! I did cook my bacon on the stove top as others suggested....also cooked onions with the bacon and then added to the bbq sauce.  I used Cattlemen's Original BBQ sauce and it was great.....topped with melted cheese.  I will definately make this over and over again..even my young children at it all!

Cooked this tonight and it was good.  You do need to cook the bacon at least half way.  I used 3 large skinless breast and cut each slice of bacon into 3 pieces and laid it on the chicken.  I also chopped up some onion and cooked with it.  It is a keeper!!!

Love,Love,Loved it! I made a few minor changes..  Instead of a butterflied chicken breast, I just took two thin slices of chicken breast & tied a string around them to keep them together, it got allot more flavor that way. I also cooked the bacon before I wrapped it around the chicken. Two pieces of bacon per serving is more than sufficient. Also, I fried some onions & chopped bacon together, then mixed them in with some BBQ sauce, then poured the sauce on top of the chicken  10 minutes before it finished baking. Some chopped cilantro on top of the finished chicken is really nice as well. Awesome recipe!!

This was a great recipe. I agree with the rest that you need to cook the bacon a little beforehand as it can come out soggy, but all in all a pretty good easy dish.

super easy to make, good to eat.  A perfect dish to throw in the oven when I get home from work, and not have to worry about.  Also great for leftovers the next day!  I don't put the full amount of bbq sauce on, just enough to cover the chicken (and I use  just a regular bbq sauce, not honey bbq flavor).  I also just cook the bacon on it's own, and stick it on top before eating (so it doesn't get soggy, and remains crispy).

The bacon should definitely be pre-cooked before being placed on top of the chicken.  I also added shredded cheese at the end.

This was very tasty. I didn't use the second pouring of sauce and I added cheese on top at the end and let it melt on. It was a little greasy but most of that stayed in the dish when I removed the chicken. Personally I think the flavor was very good...and the family liked it alot. My very picky son even ate a second helping...I love recipes that he will actually eat.

a good recipe, but the bacon did not crisp, it was as tender as the chicken... perhaps it would be crisp if cooked by itself first.  and 18 0z bbq-sauce is too much, it pools around the chicken, and carmelizes on the pan, making it hard to clean. I'd recomend using about half the ammount of sauce recomended.  i also cooked it for 35 minutes and it came out fine.

This is an average meal.  Nothing spectacular, but it is tender with flavor.  It is quick and easy to cook and that has made this part of my regular meal plan.

This was SO easy and tasted really good, with a couple changes. First of all, I used hickory smoked barbecue sauce. Also I recommend completely precooking the bacon before putting it in the pan - it worked really well for me. In the pan, layer some sauce, then chicken, the rest of the sauce, and then the bacon spread out on top. Finally I covered it with foil and baked for the recommended 45 minutes at 350 degrees. Excellent!

A very simple chicken recipe that makes you look like a 5-star cook. I followed the tempreture and time directions, but chicken in baking dish, added a coat of honey teriyaki sauce, placed bacon straight out of package on top of chicken, added second coat of sauce, put in oven, set it and forget it. Came out great tasting, juicy tender chicken. Excellent dish!

Really yummy. I will definitely be making this again. 

Only a few minor changes that I would make next time:
Precook the bacon or it is too soggy to eat. It does give a lot of flavor to the chicken though.
& Cook for longer than recommended. The chicken wasn't cooked all the way through and I had to put it back in for awhile.

Thanks for posting!

Not bad. As others said, I pre-cooked the bacon to make it more crispy. My husband liked it, but his verdict was "isn't it just chicken and barbecue sauce?" to which i answered "yes, with bacon." I'll make it again.

Try this as a sandwich on a bun/roll!  This recipe is so great because it's easy and very tasty!!
I would suggest, as others have, to precook the bacon just a tad.
Thanks!!

Wow.  My very picky 9 year old raved about this one!  I was torn between cooking and not cooking so I did both.  I cut up the bacon in small pieces so it would be easier to eat and dish out.  Next time I will not put the uncooked on and will partially cook all of it.  I don't think it made that much difference in flavoring.  I also used our favorite BBQ sauce- Sweet Baby Rays instead of honey BBQ.  It was a hit with the whole family.  Was great with a loaded baked potato.  Next time will save some of the cooked bacon for the potatoes too!

I wholeheartedly agree with the other reviewers that the bacon needs to be cooked first.  I just put fully cooked bacon on top the chicken breasts in the last 10 minutes of cooking and added slices of jack cheese.  Very good.

This was a very easy recipe and my chicken turned out very moist.  After all the reviews, I worried about a bunch of soggy bacon, but didn't want to mess up another dish to precook the bacon.  So, I followed the cooking recipe as directed except I cut back the bacon and only used one slice per chicken breast (cut in half and criss-crossed over the breast) so I could avoid too much grease.  I also used a smaller casserole dish that the chicken breasts fit in  close together and I just poured on the amount of BBQ sauce that covered the chicken breasts good (it certainly wasn't a full 18 ounces).  The dish was very good for how simple it was to put together.  The chicken was juicy and I like the bacon the way it cooked, though it certainly wasn't crispy.

This is a great, easy recipe.  I also cooked the bacon before adding it, and I also used a smaller dish than 9 x 13,so that the chicken baked more in the sauce.  It was loved by my whole family!

I wish I had read the reviews before I cooked this.  What a waste of bacon!  I needed to precook the bacon first.  The chicken was very good, though, but it also didn't need a whole bottle of BBQ sauce.  I'll make it again, but with major changes.

It was ok... BBQ chicken is always good, but the bacon didn't add a lot to the table, nor did it have a chance to crisp with all that moisture..

I made this dish for some friends for dinner and everyone loved it!  I believe the exact quote was "Awesome!"  Very easy to make and besides, how can you go wrong with bacon in a dish!

it came out really good. even my 2 and 5 year olds are it all! I cut them into tenderloin size pieces to cook faster then jacked up the heat to 400 at the end to crisp the bacon. I also wrapped the bacon around the chicken on a broiling pan to stay crispy. I will definitely make it again.

made as listed with exception of the sauce.  didnt have the honey bbq, but had pineapple bbq and it turned out fantastic.  Will definitely make again, but will take the advice of others and precook the bacon some.  This is a keeper

My husband and 2 kids (11 and 13 ) LOVED this recipe!  I have made it twice so far and will continue to do so.  I pre-cook the bacon about 1/2 way before I make this because we like it crispy and they can't stand bacon that isn't cooked all the way.  Delicious!

We used Sweet Baby Ray's Honey BBQ sauce; my pieces used a combination of Sweet Baby Ray's Honey and the original Sweet Baby Ray's. The bacon didn't crisp when my mom did this recipe for us; she says she should have cooked the bacon half-way before doing the recipe. This was pretty simple, so such details count a lot. The saltiness of the bacon combined well with the sweetness of the BBQ sauce. Was served over brown rice with brocolli.

Made some modifications...added honey to the BBQ sauce, pre-cooked the bacon and it was good. This a decent "starter" recipe definitely not glamorous but a decent family meal.

While the barbecue sauce and bacon juices left the chicken tasty and juicy, the bacon  did not crisp at all. We ended up eating the chicken but not the bacon.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  And it was good and I would make it again.  However, next time, I will do as others have suggested and pre-cook the bacon first.  I even put mine under the broiler for last few minutes of cooking time, and that still didn't crisp it up enough.  But definitely worth cooking again.

I made this dish tonight, but I did two things differently to it. Instead of placing the bacon on top, I took the chicken and wrapped the bacon around it. Also, I used original barbecue sauce instead of the honey flavored because it gave it a more spicy flavor to it. This was an all right dish. It's not one of my favorites though. I would make this again, but not anytime soon.

I don't know if the recipe is better with or without chicken! For breakfast, I will sometimes pan fry some turkey bacon, add some shredded cheddar on top, microwave for 10 seconds, then dunk in bbq sauce (I prefer Jack Daniels original spicy bbq sauce). If making with chicken, cook the turkey bacon for a few minutes before adding to the chicken. I will try making this recipe again with very thin sliced chicken.

Like all simple recipes this one requires some pretty quality ingredients to make it worthwhile. This would be great with a homemade bbq sauce, but I was satisfied with KC Masterpiece Hickory BBQ, which I had picked up because it was rated highly in the Cooks Illustrated taste tests. A poor bbq sauce would make this recipes inedible, I am sure. I used a thick cut, smoky bacon, and actually discarded it after cooking, so I can't speak to its consistency. It added a good flavor to the sauce. I also added in some red onion (ringed) and some garlic powder before I poured over the sauce. I used a whole bottle for four hefty sized chicken breasts (along with their tenders). This was a simple approach to BBQ chicken which I wouldn't have thought of. It was tasty with some Southern-style mustard greens and rice.

This tasted really good, but I didn't like how soggy the bacond turned out.  I even used fully cooked bacon, but it didn't crisp up in the oven because of the BBQ sauce.  The chicken was great for sandwiches, though.

Made this last night with just a couple modifications.  I sliced the bacon in half and precooked until about 1/2 way done.  Poured 1/4 of the bottle of bbq sauce on the bottom of the baking dish, but other than that I followed the directions as provided.  I highly recommend sweet baby rays bbq sauce for this recipe!  Will be making again!

I ccoked the bacon halfway in the microwave, but it still didn't get crisy AT ALL in the oven.  My husband liked this, but then again he's not very picky.

A super easy dish, that everyone,including the picky eaters enjoyed. I took others advice and pre-cooked the bacon before putting it on the chicken. I used honey BBQ sauce, but I would think that any BBQ sauce that you prefer would work great.

This is a great recipe, everyone in my family loved it. I sprinkled some bbq seasoning, precooked the bacon,and used less bbq sauce and it turned out well.

My family loves this recipe.  I never precook the bacon as some of the other reviewers.  I love serving this over a heaping pile of mashed potatoes and corn on the cob on the side! Mmmmmm!

I rated this chicken two stars and DH would have rated it 3.  We found this to be a massive waste of bbq sauce and even though I wrapped the chicken in bacon and seared it, the bacon still came out soggy because of all the bbq sauce.  We *may* try this again, but DH will grill the chicken and we will brush with a little honey garlic bbq sauce during cooking.

Good and easy to make.  I followed the other reviews, pre-cooking the bacon.  Next time I will not pre-cook the bacon to see how much of the bacon flavor gets to the chicken. UPDATE: Decreased rating to 3 stars since the bacon always ended up soggy for me. If you don't precook the bacon, you will end up with bacon flavored chicken, but the bacon will never crisp. If you precook the bacon and pour the additional sauce on top, the bacon will end up a little soggy too--probably depends on when you add the cooked bacon on top of the chicken along with additional sauce and how long you finish baking the chicken.

This is a great dish. I have 6 kids and they are all very picky. This dish was a hit with them and they actually asked for seconds. It is easy to fix and great flavor. You will enjoy it.

Excellent.  I cooked the bacon first.  We loved this receipe.  I think that your chicken won't be dry if they are thicker pieces.

A recipe just the way I like them! Easy to make and tasted great too!  My husband eat the leftovers we had on a hoagie roll and thought it tasted just as great!
