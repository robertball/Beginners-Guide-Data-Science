Wonderful chicken salad - nice and creamy! Plus it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken. I used Hellman's light mayo and added a bit of finely chopped celery along with the almonds. This was great on mini potato rolls.

Very good recipe.  I made this for a baby shower and scaled the recipe to make 35 servings.  I added celery and grapes, which I love in chicken salad, and it turned out great.  I didn't have fresh tarragon on hand, so I used dry tarragon (only used half of what the recipe called for since I used dry seasoning instead of fresh).  The next time I make this, I will not put in as much tarragon as the recipe calls for, since I thought it was a little overpowering.  However, I am pregnant and that may be why I found the taste to be a little much.  Overall, this is a very good recipe and is easy to make.

This dish is especially good when broccoli, cauliflower or celery are added.

Left out the almonds and didn't bother to whip the cream.  Added a wee squeeze of lemon and a teeny bit of finely minced onion.  Loved the fresh tarragon, but I mostly was wowed with using grilled chicken rather than poaching it.

The measurements were all off on this one when I reduced the serving size to only one. I ended up with tons or whipped cream so the chicken salad was extremely "whipped cream tasting." I added more seasonings and it just didn't come together as well I as thought it would have considering the reviews. Maybe I will make it again using the recommended amounts.

I really like this recipe because it's so creamy and doesn't taste entirely like mayo. I added green grapes and celery to give it an extra kick and it was fabulous on toasted bread. It's perfect for a women's tea or brunch and even works great on a bed of lettuce.

Delicious and easy!!  I used dried tarragon - a pinch or two.  With salted snokehouse almonds there was no need to add salt.

Very good, mom loved it! Seems a bit strange with the whipped cream and tarragon, but definitely delicious. :)

Everyone liked this one.  Used canned chicken and it worked very well.  I put the almonds in the food processor to chop them.  Next time will reduce the time, maybe just pulse to chop so there are still chunky pieces.

I thought this recipe was one of the best I've had. I think the whipping cream is a nice touch and tones the chicken salad down so it's not so tangy and strong in mayo flavor. I didn't add the tarragon and I did add sliced grapes, which made a good addition.

Nice change, I had never used whip crm b4 in a recipe. I used toasted slivered almonds, because I cant stand the flavor of smoked. Added finely diced celery and grn onions to mix (I like crunchy chix salad)

I love this receipe.  I cook the chicken in the crockpot with water, italian seasonings, onions, and some other stuff I can't remember.  I tend to just throw stuff in.  I omit the tarragon just because it is so expensive and I never use it for anything else.  I have a toddler so I finely chop the nuts and he can't get enough of it.  I serve the salad on buttered toast and it is heavenly.  Plus I don't heat up my kitchen.  Great summer meal serve with melon on the side.

Loved that there wasn't so much mayo.  Adjust whipping cream to equal parts whipped cream to mayo.  Made two batches...one with parsley & one with dill.  My personal fav was dill.  I also added purple grapes & toasted almonds.

Very tasty. I was a little scared of the tarragon so I used a little less than called for. I used sliced almonds and added sliced green grapes and chopped celery. I would make again. Thanks.

Very good.  Toast the bread and butter for even a better, warm, easy dinner.

I was delighted by this recipe,I have whipping cream in my frig and I needed to use some of it and this intriged me,I made it a little differently,I didn't have tarragon so I used garlic powder and I put bacon bits in,no green onions and I really enjoyed it but the more I ate,the more I realized how sweet it is,you need something in there to counterbalance and I think I may try some guacamole tommorow for lunch. Couldn't hurt.

I really dig the whipping cream thing, I was quite pleased.  Next time I will be increasing the amount of wet ingredients, it wasn't as "creamy" as expected.  Delightful lunch fixings none-the-less, thanks for the recipe.

Didn't have almonds, used walnuts instead. Very good.
