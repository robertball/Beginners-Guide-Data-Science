This is a five star recipe with my changes. I halfed the chicken broth to 4 cups and substituted heavy cream for the cream of mushroom. I also add dijon mustard to my cheese broccoli soup, it is the secret weapon.

Yummy comfort food! Being vegetarian, I used veg broth. Also used cream of broccoli instead of mushroom soup. Used combination of shredded sharp cheddar and mixed shredded Mexican cheese blend. I finely diced half of the fresh broccoli before adding it to the soup (rather than using a blender) and the consistency turned out great! Will definitely make again!

I love this soup!  It has a smooth texture and cheesy taste!  Very easy and quick soup recipe!  Leftovers are great too!  I thickened with potato flakes like other reviewers as well-made it very quick and easy!  Thanks for sharing!

AMAZING. Just as good if not better than Panera's broccoli cheese soup. Creamy, cheesy and delicious. I used one can of chicken broth, 1 1/4 cup milk, 1 stalk celery, 1/4 of an onion, celery salt, salt and pepper, frozen broccoli (heated in microwave for 3 minutes), and just sharp cheddar cheese. Also, I didn't have cornstarch so I looked up the substitute and used 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour.

This recipe was simple and very tasty.  I used chicken bouillon cubes because I didn't have any chicken stock.  I also used half and half cream as well as the mushroom soup and with my immersion blender this soup turned out fantastically creamy.  I don't think that you have to follow this recipe very closely, it is very forgiving.  I will make this again for sure!

My whole family, even the 2 yr old loved this soup. The only thing I added was one tsp of nutmeg. the nutmeg takes out the bitter broccoli taste. I have made this soup several times and will make it again!

I made this soup for a large group and had all compliments and several requests for the recipe.  I used a suggestion from another member to use instant potatoes instead of cornstarch.  Excellent.

This had a wonderful taste but the texture was all weird...I did what others had done and used potato flakes...maybe that was the problem? I prefer my broccoli cheese soup much creamier...I probably won't be making this again just b/c of that...it tasted good though!

I've had better. Didn't like the texture and adding a can of ready-soup isn't "from scratch" like I was looking for. At least it was an easy recipe though.

I LOVED this soup! It was very good, but I added garlic cloves, potatoes instead of the corn starch and carrotts.  Good starting base, excellent soup!

This was a really good recipe that even my kids loved.  Although I did make a few changes.  I precooked the onion and celery before adding the broth and mush soup.  I also added fresh broccoli at this stage and simmered for the time indicated.  I then used a hand blender to make it a bit smoother, leaving some broccoli whole.  I would also recommend cutting back on the milk by half as it was too liquid.  I am used to cream soups being more thick.  Adding leftover mashed potatoes also worked well to thicken.  At the very end, I added crumbled cooked bacon on top.

This soup turned out thinner than I expected, but had a great flavor. In retrospect, it was a little too salty. Next time, I will add salt incrementally instead of blindly following the recipe. I blanched the broccoli, which turned out great. I boiled the florets for two minutes, then placed them in a bowl filled with ice water. My family enjoyed this soup, though we prefer it to be thicker. If you also like a thicker soup, just add additional cornstarch.

This soup recipe is very good. The only thing different I did was saute the onions and cerlery in a stick of butter and used 1/2 and 1/2 for part of the milk to make it richer.

I loved this soup, although I did add some bacon just for a little touch of meat and about a cup of velveeta cheese.  Wonderfully satisfying. Thank You.

Yummy! I omitted the cornstarch and added leftover mashed potatoes which made it more of a potato soup with broccoli in it, but was it ever tasty.

Enjoyed this recipe but did not add salt. Canned broth is usually salty enough. Had turkey broth and chicken broth so used both. Flavor is very good. Used carrots in my soup and then pureed everything when it was done. Very, very good. I thickened with two large potatoes, cooked and mashed. Worked very well.

This tasted great, but was a little too thin for me. Next time I might use cream instead of milk to make it a little more robust.

Great soup! I made a few alterations: 4 cups vegetable broth and 4 cups water, 1/2 T salt, omitted the celery and added the raw chopped broccoli with the milk. This is absolutely delicious.

So...full...now... I've never made cream of broccoli before and I found this recipe so easy to make for a newbie. I just finished a bowl maybe 15 minutes ago and I'm still savouring it in my head. I halved the recipe and just used a cup and a half of marble cheese, it was fine.  Next time I'll double the onions.

I love this recipe, but I cannot give it the 5 star rating, because I altered it a bit for my taste. I leave the condensed mushroom soup out (my daughter doesn't like mushroom and I don't think it is essential for the taste) and I add no salt, in fact I use only 6 or 7 chicken broth cubes. It is no problem to add more salt afterward, if you like it with more, but you cannot take saltiness away afterward. It is important to use American cheese. I've tried some other cheeses, which is ok, but not as good.

This recipe is exceptional. I didn't have chicken broth so I substituted beef broth but it still worked out well. I had 1 cup of leftover mashed potatoes in the fridge so I added it just to use it up. I will definitely be making this one again. Thanks for the recipe.

Good tasting soup!  I cooked the onion and celery in a little garlic infused olive oil before adding other ingredients and used a can of evaporated milk and one can water.  Got "thumbs up" from a teenager - will definately make again.

Wow very good. Made lots of changes as I am terrible with following directions: i adjusted the servings to 5. Used heavy cream in place of milk, used 2.5 Tbsp of cornstarch and 1 Tbsp four to thicken up more, cream of chicken instead of mushroom, 1/2 C of sour cream 1 1/2 C sharp cheddar and 1C mexican(all I had in fridge) Dijon mustard, chopped up 2 C broccoli.

As others have done I made a few changes. I used 6 cups of broth, one cup of milk and one cup of half and half.  I mixed the cornstarch with white wine. I only added one t. of salt. Two cups Cheddar and 1/4c of Parmesan. I added 1t. of nutmeg, some garlic granules and a few shakes of Cajun seasoning. I had to add a flour slurry to make it thicker. I puréed everything with my stick blender. It hit the spot on a cold windy day. There’s just two of us so there is a lot left. Thinking of adding crab or poached salmon to change it up a bit. Very good soup.

My favorite recipe.. Sometimes I'm  the mood for this soup, and just use two packages of frozen and thawed Green Giant cheesy broccoli if I can't get to the grocery store for fresh broccoli. I still follow the rest of the recipe including the cheeses.

I've made this recipe several times. This recipe can be enjoyed as is, with substitutes or exchanges. This is now my wife's favorite soup so It's safe to say that I will be making it many more times.

This soup was fantastic!  I followed the recipe very closely with the exception of two things... first, I added a little carrot with the boiling veggies and second, the cream of mushroom. I didn't have any, so I used cream of chicken instead. The only thing I would do differently would be to grind the celery, carrot and onion so they end up finer. My kids were picking at them a little and didn't really want to eat them. Aside from that, grab some fresh bread and enjoy this creamy bowl of amazing soup!

Really good as-is or blended, which is what my kids prefer. Also amazing with some sour cream mixed in! We used vegetable broth and I eyeballed the amounts of onion and celery.

This recipe was a hit...no  - a "homerun" according to my 1o year old son!  I altered it a bit; after simmering the onions and celery and after the broccoli was done, I pureed the entire batch.  No milk or cornstartch needed - they loved it as is!

I made this for my mom who was sick and it turned out very good.  She didn't have American cheese so I subbed with velvetta cheese that she had on hand.  Came out very rich and creamy.

This soup is wonderful! Instead of cleaning all that broccoli, I bought precleaned broccoli florets, and steamed in the microwave to save time. The only thing I altered was the salt content.  With the chicken broth, 1 Tablespoon was too much.

This is great soup.  I didn't have celery, so I grated some carrots and added those instead.  I used a 4 oz. package of cheesy mashed potato mix to thicken the soup, and that worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great!
I cut the salt and also used the leaves from the celery stalks.  Considering adding fresh mushrooms into the leftovers.
