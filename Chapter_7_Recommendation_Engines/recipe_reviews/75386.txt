My initial reaction was dislike, the chicken liver has a very soft texture when hot(but I loved them cold). The mustard and olive recipe is messy, and didn't coat well. Needed extra time cooking. You want these to be bite sized, next time I try these I'm going to make them about as wide as the bacon, and just wrap over once.

I did not use the olives.  Perfect.  Also made bacon wrapped little smokies and bacon wrapped water chestnuts.  Kept them all warm in a crockpot separated by foil.  Very few of any of them remained at the end of the evening!
