I loved this (5 stars!) but hubs not as much (3 stars), but then he's not a fan of gnocchi in the first place. I am, and I thought this sage-butter sauce was perfect with it. I didn't measure seasonings exactly, just to my own taste.  What I'd love to try next time is to subtley brown the butter and use fresh sage. Great dish, however, just as is, keeping mind that seasoning measurements are useful as a guide, but don't have to be strictly adhered to!

This was soooo good!  I tripled the recipe and followed it exactly, except that I poured the sauce into a bowl with the gnocchi and tossed it because I had too much gnocchi for the pan.  I've only had gnocchi with regular spaghetti sauce before and did not care for it, but I LOVED this!  Great with a salad and garlic bread.  Thanks for sharing!
P.S.  I used freshly minced garlic and I think that really adds a lot of flavor

I cut the recipe in half and used 1 (16 oz) package of gnocchi. It fed my husband and I and two small portions for my toddlers.

Quick & Easy, what's not to love?  I cut the recipe down and used 1 (16.8 oz) package of gnocchi.  I also cooked some chicken tenders in the sauce and this became an instant hit at home.

Yummy :)  I used fresh sage and, so, had to guess at the quantities a little but it turned out great.  I added sauteed zucchini at the end and served it as the main course.  Very good.  Very easy :)

I needed a quick side dish for gnocchi one night and found this recipe. It was a big hit with my family. My husband loved it and said it reminded him of garlic cheese bread that you would find at a pizza place.

I loved this delicious recipe!  The garlic, sage, parmesan, salt & black pepper make a beautiful mix of color, texture, & flavor for this butter sauce.  Wouldn't change a thing.  This gnocchi was by far the best I've had!  Thank you SO much for sharing this recipe!  Will be making this again!  :)

Except for adding a little fresh sage with the dried, I followed this recipe exactly. It was very good. Next time however I think I will try making it into a cream sauce as there is a popular gnocchi dish at a local Italian restaurant that I love that tastes very similar but it is creamy instead of buttery. Overall, very nice flavor and I love the sage!

This was tasty!  The Parmesan cheese brings it all together.  Since the gnocchis was finished a bit ahead of the rest of my meal, I drained it, tossed it in the pan with the butter, garlic, and sage (fresh...about four-five leaves, chopped), and let it sit on low heat.  A few minutes before serving, I added the cheese and tossed it all again.  I served it as a bed for chicken breasts cooked in a marinara sauce.  This is a very pleasant way to serve gnocchi.

This is an excellent treatment for gnocchi, keeping it light and revealing the flavor of the dumpling itself.  We made fresh gnocchi, and used fresh sage and salted butter.  Remember to slightly undercook your gnocchi since you'll be throwing it in the pan and don't want it to turn to mush.  Also let it drain well so you don't water down the sauce.

I found this recipe trying to duplicate sage-butter sauce I tasted on pumpkin ravioli. This wasn't quite what I was looking for but  equally as good.  I used about 1/4 cup of olive oil and a generous tablespoon of butter.  I also added a few extra cloves of garlic, and also some thyme with the sage.  Very, very good.  I didn't have an gnocci so I served over tortalini.

It's potato puffs with butter and cheese. It would be hard to go wrong but this is too blah.  Next time maybe some chives or parsley... something but this as it is won't be making another appearance on my table.

This was a great recipe! Quick and easy and tasty! I will reduce the butter next time to 3 tbsp as 1/4 cup was way too much in my opinion and I am a butter lover! I used fresh sage as well about 10 leaves chopped. Delish!

I liked this, but my husband didn't care for it. He said it was 'too much spice'. I had made some modifications, because we were using this as a side dish. I only made 10 oz on the gnocchi, and 1 Tblsp of the Parm, 1 Tblsp of the light margarine. I think that making 24 oz of this for too people is a lot even for a main course.

When I added the sage it all clumped together into one big mass!  I took the clump out, added the gnocchi and stirred it in what was left, then sprinkled sage, parmesan and pepper on top and stirred again.  I did not care for it all!  I don't get how this got such good reviews..

So delicious.  An option: Add pancetta and sweet peas, over the top!  Make plenty of extra, you will eat most of it while "taste testing!"

Just made this recipe, using only 1 box of gnocchi, half the butter but the same amount of spices.  I added cooked smoked turkey sausage cut in pieces and a handful of spinach.  It was awesome!!!

WOW this is good!!! Had a 17.4 (?) oz packet of gnocchi instead but kept all the other measurements the same and it worked out great. SUPER easy, SUPER fast, and soooo good. (Also did a few cloves of garlic, a heaping tablespoon of sage, and generous pepper just because I wanted more flavor.)

I love this recipe!  I've recently become a fan of gnocchi and purchased a whole wheat sweet potato variety to try something new.  I've always used gnocchi with chicken or in soups and was a bit nervous how this would turn out.  Fan-freakin-tastic!  I loved it.  My husband loved it more than me.  I think 2 servings for this recipe is nuts because we only used a 16oz package and had at least a third leftover.  We also made green bean and mushroom medley from this site and it was a delicious meal.  Thanks for this recipe!!!!

I just made this to go with half a bag of frozen three cheese tortellini and it was fantastic! You can taste all the flavors.  I did stay pretty close to the specified measurements but added a little more butter. Because I only used half a 19oz bag of pasta there was plenty of the sauce! Thanks for posting this!

loved this recipe!  It was my first time trying gnocchi and I couldn't have found a better recipe for my first taste!  I used real sage  and real butter.  It tasted so good!

This was pretty good.  I wasn't impressed, but I wasn't disappointed either.  It was fine...might make it again but probably won't crave it.

This is a very quick, very simple, but very delicious way of preparing gnocchi!  The flavors are excellent exactly as written.  Make sure you use unsalted butter or if not, omit the salt.  I have also prepared it with chopped proscuitto (again, omit the salt).  Excellent recipe Gina!

I make my own gnocchi with instant Idaho mashed potatoes using a 1cup mash, 2cup flour, 1 egg ratio and use the sauce from this recipe. My family (husband and two toddlers) devour it regularly.

Well. I'm guessing this was hit and miss in my house. While my very picky son said blah he didn't like the taste, my girls said they were fabulous and got 2nds, hubby thought they were good but too strong in flavor but did eat them. I had 2 and thought they were fine and noticed the sage being slightly strong. But since I have never made or tried gnocchi before this recipe, I'd make the gnocchi again trying some other recipes and I'd make this again, so long as I toned down the sage some. maybe to 1/2 a tsp. TY

Fantastic! Would've rated 4 1/2 stars if possible only because I think with all that gnocchi, it needed more butter. The rest of the recipe was spot on. Husband and I both loved it. Thanks for posting gina.

The flavor was good but for my first time eating gnocchi, I was a bit disappointed.  I didn't care for the texture, it seemed a bit too soft and almost sticky but maybe I overcooked.. Followed the directions on the packages for the gnocchi!  Served with some marinara sauce on the side.

Tasty, but a little salty for me.  I halved the recipe, and if I make it again, I'll just use a pinch of salt, or maybe leave it out entirely.

This is a wonderful sauce that goes perfectly with gnocchi.  I made the "quick gnocchi" recipe from this site, and put the sauce over that.  Really put it over the top delicious.  I ate way too much, and the sauce was just as tasty the next day.  This is saved in my recipe box, and I am already trying to think of what else I could pair with it!  Lots of butter means I won't make this every week, but a very tasty indulgence.

This is great! Tried it for the first time this evening for supper and I couldn't get enough. Even my husband liked it, and he's not a big fan of garlic or Parmesan cheese! I halved the recipe and it was plenty for 2 adults and 2 kids. I will be making it again - soon. Too bad there were no leftovers...??

This was DELICIOUS!!! It was so simple to make. The only thing I would do different is leave out the salt. I love salt, but for some reason it was too strong. Oh, I used marjoram because I didn't have sage.

The butter sage sauce was fantastic, and the gnocchi I bought was the best I have ever tasted. I did what I hate other people doing: I added an ingredient (pancetta). But the gnocchi and butter sage sauce stole the show. SO GOOD!

Very simple to make and very delicious! I had some fresh tomatoes that I needed to use up, so I chopped and added them to the saute process which gave it some nice texture, color and flavor.

We really enjoyed.  I had to use up some dried *gnocchi* type pasta thing hubby brought home (really, just gnocchi shaped pasta), so we didn't get the real gnocchi experience, but we liked them with the sauce.  For those saying there wasn't much flavor, I made my sauce (half recipe) early in the morning (goodness knows it's simple enough) and it sat most the day so the seasoning really had a chance to do its thing.  Will make again.

This was quick, easy, and delicious! i will absolutely make this again. The only thing that I did different was that I used a 16 oz package of the Gnocchi and half a cup of the Parmesan. and it worked out really well. I loved having the extra sauce with it.

I liked it but I think I'd cut the butter in half next time as it was too rich for me with all that butter. OH but I see now it was 2 packages of gnocchi! Well that would have been just right then. Silly me I missed that.

Very tasty, quick and easy.  I added chopped parsley to color it up a bit.  I'd also suggest that the portions in the recipe are quite large, unless you're a big eater.  Half of the quantity was fine for us!

I LOVED this. Added mushrooms after the garlic was browned, used whole wheat gnocchi, then served it atop a bed of fresh baby spinach, with lightly sauteed chunks of zucchini on the side and some sauteed chicken with shallots. Can't wait to get some more gnocchi and make it again!

This is a very simple recipe for a dish that's very tasty! I used the real Parmigiano Reggiano for this dish- and I used at least 3/4 cup freshly grated. I also used 3 tbsp's butter (not 4, as was in the recipe). In fact, when I make this again, I'll use just 2 tbsp's, because that's all it really needed. I used oregano and basil, instead of sage (don't care for the taste).

excellent - the only change I made was the cheese. I didn't have parmesan so I used asiago and it was wonderful.

I enjoyed this recipe. It was the first time I cooked gnocchi. Would try this recipe again using sage. Very Tasty!

Didn't have any sage, so I used Poultry Seasoning I had on hand & a little Chicken-Seafood Seasoning mix. Did not add salt once cooked to reduce sodium.

I had some pre-cooked chicken so I diced it, heated it in the microwave and placed the pieces on top of the finished dish.

Super-easy and very yummy. I'd imagine the sauce would work on just about any kind of pasta, too.

We love the simplicity of the sage garlic butter sauce and have used with gnocchi as well as other pasta dishes. We made the sauce with a mini penne and sliced up grilled sausage and peppers with it. Very good. Tried adding a dash of red pepper flakes and liked it as well for those that like a little kick.

Way too rich for us.  We could hardly eat it.  And this is coming from someone who eats raw butter by itself.

I was very excited about trying this recipe after having Gnocchi in restaurants many times.  The right idea with the combination of sage, parmesan, and garlic, but yikes, Calories! I would definitely cut the butter in half otherwise it is a very greasy dish.

Another idea is to use Monterey Jack or Mozzarella shredded cheeses in place of the parmesan for a creamier texture.

These gnocchi were gnucky.  I've only eaten gnocchi at restaurants so I was eager to try this recipe.  I used store-bought (Archer Farms) gnocci and was really disappointed in this dish.  I only used one pack and reduced the other ingredients accordingly.  I love garlic and butter (see fat content in this recipe - yikes), but the actual gnocchi were bland and dull tasting despite the garlic and butter.  I would suggest adding much more sage, I could barely even taste it.  Overall this was big flop.

It was good but a little salty for my taste. I would cut down the salt content next time because you cook the gnocchi with salt, and when you add the recommended salt and parmesan cheese it's salty.

I tried this recipe today and really liked it!  I had a 16 ounce package of gnocchi so I basically halved the recipe.  It made 4 servings.  I substituted "Herbs de Provence" from my spice rack for the sage and it was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe that really highlights the flavor and texture of the gnocchi.  I add more garlic (about 3 cloves), and I use one 17.6 oz. package of gnocchi.

Delicious! I cooked it for my boyfriend (who is not a fan of Gnocchi AND a very hard critique) and loved it! I did add a little spinach, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and onions the second time around and it was good! Thanks for sharing!

I love this!  I used a 16 oz package of the sweet potato/whole wheat gnocchi, reduced the Parm cheese a little and the butter a little, and fresh sage.  I did add 1/4 - 1/2 cup of chopped pecans to the mixture for some crunch, and that was awesome!!!!

This meal took only minutes to cook and was very tasty.  I didn't change a thing and my husband loved it!  I'll certainly keep this recipe for those nights when I'm not in the mood to cook.  All the ingredients were on hand in teh pantry and refrig making this a real hit.

Very nice flavor. I have a "meat and potatoes" family and they scarfed this down. I added the chicken (yeah! for one pot dinners!) and tossed in the gnocchi at the end. Quite filling! Will make again. Thank you!

The sage cooked in the butter give these Gnocchi a great flavor! I added a Parmesan/Romano blend of cheese to mine, it tasted so good.

I enjoyed this dish, but my 3 year old didn't, but no big surprise there!  Next time I would go a little bit lighter on the sage or switch to fresh, I felt like that flavour was a little overpowering.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for lunch today. Not that bad but the recipe calls for way to much sage, I added half the amount and thought it was just ok. Next time I will just omit the sage.

Nice flavor. But it seemed dry. Also, I think the original recipe actually would probably serve 3-4. I made it according to their portions for 5 and we ate less than half of it. Next time I'd add some zucchini or another veggie to add to the nutritional value.

This recipe is so easy to make and delicious! I made the recipe exactly as written and served it as a side dish to go with salmon. Although this dish was delicious, I was missing the hint of sage in this recipe and next time will add a little more or use fresh sage. Thank you for the recipe!

We loved it!  I like more veges on my pasta, so I roasted tomatoes and kale in Italian seasonings and olive oil.  I boiled frozen peas with the gnocci.  Followed this recipe.  Mixed together and sprinkled Fuegorita for some kick.  Yum!

I made the recipe exactly as written. The gnocchi came out too "greasy" and the sage was a little overwhelming. I won't make this one again. I didn't like it, but my husband thought it was ok.

I didn't have the full amount of gnocchi, so I reduced the other amounts accordingly.  I used fresh sage and wasn't sure how much to use.  I would have liked a stronger sage taste than the three leaves gave.  Nevertheless, this was an easy and very good dish that I wouldn't hesitate to make again.

We made this but unfortunately, did not have any sage so we went ahead without it.  It was good, but I may have browned the garlic a little too much.  I also browned the butter (which we normally love).  I also guessed on the ingredient amounts because Indid not have the amount of gnocchi that the recipe called for.  Maybe if I had made it as stated, it would have earned a higher rating.

It was delicous! To step it up a bit, I added extra garlic and some penzeys herbs which hit the spot. I also recommend that while adding the gnocchi into the pan that you sear it on both sides to get a light golden brown. This makes the flavor stronger and even more delectable. :-)

Very good side dish or part of a main dish.  I have made it both ways. Last night I made this and added shrimp and fresh broccoli to the mixture. Had to up the cheese content a little bit to cover the extra, but this is wonderful tasting and smelling dish !!

I added more sage and used fresh garlic in the sauce because our household loves the taste of garlic! Easy and quick recipe. I even added shrimp which I preseasoned with powdered garlic, pepper,  and dried parsley. Great dish!

Followed the recipe exactly, it turned out correctly however was not good. Would not make again and would not recommend. Try making a sage cream sauce instead, I've made that before with gnocchi and it was a lot better!

Thanks for excellent recipe.  Used 2 tsp fresh sage because that was what I had and since I was 2 tbsp short of Parmesan, I added some fresh grated Asagio cheese at the end.  It worked well, but will definaly try it with just Parmesan next time.  We also thought we will try adding prawns and/or chicken for a meal rather than a side.

I had my Culinary Arts students make this recipe and it turned out perfectly! We used fresh sage, and added fresh basil as well as 1/4 tsp each of crushed red pepper. The spice balanced nicely with the gnocchi. We are definitely making this again next year.

I made this last night and my 6 year old saw it still on my computer and said, "Mom, should we rate that 'love it'? Because I really really loved it!"  Which I think is a pretty stellar review :)  My 2 and 4 year old were unimpressed (but I don't think they even tried it), but my husband and I also liked it.  I didn't have two packages of gnocchi so I just made the sauce according to directions and put it with my one package - I definitely think that spreading the sauce over two packages would have been better.  This was our first time trying gnocchi and I think it was a success, we'll definitely be trying it again!

Fast and easy recipe for a quick and lovely dinner! You can cut the recipe in half if you are cooking for yourself. Goes great with vegetable side dishes.

I added butter to the drained gnocchi and added garlic powder, sage, salt, pepper and parmesan.  I thought it was very good.  It was our first time gnocchi and I am still not sure if I like the texture, but will probably make it again.

Cut the recipe in half since just the two of us and served with salad.  Is a good way to serve gnocchi without "sauce".  The browned butter adds a nuttiness that is great with sage.  My only change next time will be to use fresh sage & fry in the butter.

I made this tonight and it turned out beautifully! I did make just a few changes, however. I browned the butter before I added the garlic, and I also used three teaspoons of fresh, chopped sage. I will be making this again! Thank you for posting.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious! My 2 & 3 year olds even ate their entire portion! There are a few things I would tweak, but that's just my taste. This was an easy and quick recipe which is just what I need with 2 toddlers running around!

This was a quick and easy dinner. We just made the butter/sage sauce with the gnocchi to go with other things and it was delicious! I'll definitely make it again. We even discussed using it with other pasta.

Husband, one year old and I all loved this! I did not change the sauce recipe, but used a 16 oz package of gnocchi. To make it heartier, I cooked several chicken tenders in a skillet (just olive oil, salt and pepper) and removed them from the pan when done. When the gnocchi was done boiling (only about a minute and a half) I drained it then tossed it into the pan the chicken had been in and sautéed it for a minute or so- toasts the gnocchi nicely and gives it more flavor. Then the gnocchi and diced chicken all went into the butter sauce together. Wonderful light meal!

Had this same dish at a modern restaurant in Berlin. It's a great substitute! I added in minced garlic with the butter and increased the amount of sage.

I tried this recipe and I absolutely love it! What I did different is I first cooked the sage  for a minute  then took it out  and set it aside. Then I cooked the garlic added mushrooms and sweet Italian sausage. It was a perfect combo with the sauce! I posted a photo so you can see how my dish came out :)

Four stars good!  The kids even ate it!  Five stars if it had a veggie, it's not very healthy.  We added peas.  Maybe a salad would be a good side.

Had some Trader Joe's butternut squash raviolis to use up and wanted a non-tomatoe sauce to use.  This was perfect.  I mixed the sauce with the raviolies and then liberally grated some parmesan on....yummm.  Served with Italian Breaded Pork Chops from AR.  Thanks!!

This was my first time cooking gnocchi and we loved this recipe. I used one 17oz package of gnocchi and used 3 cloves of garlic. I eye balled there rest of the ingredients and it turned out wonderful. I can see this becoming a regular side dish in my house.

I made this on a whim on a boring Sunday afternoon to go with roast pork.  I used the "quick gnocchi" recipe on here that uses instant potatoes for the gnocchi part.  These were SO GOOD! 
The sage-butter sauce, is just so different from "the usual" stuff we eat. I was not expecting them to be as delicious as they were, and the family to love them as much as they did.  Now they keep asking me to make them again, and frankly, they were kind of a nuisance to make ;-)

What put this over the top for me was I used it on homemade gnocchi.  I love sage, garlic and browned butter.  The little crispy bits from sauteeing the gnocchi just was fabulous.  :)  I used fresh sage since I had it on hand.

I made this dish for my younger cousins (age 12-14) who are vegetarians. The sauce is delicious, quick and easy to make. Instead of buying pre-made gnocchi, we made it a fun craft day to make the gnocchi from scratch. It was great bonding! 

I slowly browned the butter and used fresh sage and garlic. Served it with a side of sauteed mushrooms and almond, cranberry, apple, spinach salad. It was a hit with the kids! Can't wait to make this again for friends and family.

I've made this recipe twice now. The first time I only had shredded Parmesan cheese so I used that, the second time I used the grated Parmesan cheese from a bottle and it was not nearly as good. The shredded parmesan cheese gave it so much more taste and the cheese kind of melted all over the gnocchi.

Yumm! I made a roux from the butter added flour and then added cream and chicken broth and rest of the ingredients and made it more like an alfredo gnocchi and it was so good!

I tried this skeptically, as I have yet to find a homemade gnocchi sauce I love. I thought I burned the sauce, I thought it tasted too bland. I fretted that my gnocchi may have been too cheap and would ruin the dish. Then, I put it all together and tasted...pure heaven. I attribute the success to quality sage, properly cooked gnocchi, and a simple but effective sauce I never would have thought of on my own.

I loved it!!  I had a 1lb pkg. but kept the same sauce  directions (love butter).  My husband didn't really like it but he doesn't like anything.  I made for dinner and then went back all night picking and ate today for lunch.  Thank you for such a simple recipe, would have never thought to put in sage.

Delicious!  I made 1/2 recipe because I only had one package of gnocchi.  It ended up a bit dry, but otherwise perfect...probably didn't measure correctly on the butter!

Don't let the simplicity of this dish fool you, it's fabulous!  I added sliced mushrooms and used 3 garlic cloves instead of just one.  Perfect dish, perfectly seasoned!  I will serve this as often as I have a need for something fast and delicious!

3 stars from me - 4 from my dinner guest.  I'm going with my guest's rating because it was my personal preference (I love my pasta drowning in sauce) that makes this an average, instead of fanstatic, meal for me.  My guest, however, does not enjoy overly-sauced foods, and we both agreed the ingredients and seasonings were spot-on.

Wonderful! Used on homemade gnocchi. Super simple, had all ingredients on hand, and made plenty for a very large batch of gnocchi (probably more than 24 oz). Preferred over red sauce and cream sauce by my whole crew.

This dish was FANTASTIC! My husband and I couldn't stop raving while we were eating it. It's hard to believe something so simple could be so good! I accidentally browned the butter and garlic a little but it turned out great, maybe even better than it otherwise would have. This recipe is going into regular rotation at our house. Thanks for sharing it!

Delicious sauce! Substitute rosemary for sage for a yummy alternative.  The sauce also goes well over grilled or roasted chicken.

Excellent, melt in your mouth recipe. I used 2 lbs (32 oz) of Gnocchi, and added a little extra of all ingredients. As a main dish, this served 4 people. Next time, I'm going to add diced, cooked butternut squash for a little bit of color and sweetness.

I was very disappointed. I love gnocchi, and unfortunately this didn't make the cut. I thought the sage and garlic were way too strong together, and it was too greasy for me. If I were to make this again, I'd probably cut down on some of the garlic or sage, but I don't think I'll attempt again.

Normally I would love a recipe that consisted of potatoes soaked in butter, but this left much to be desired. I followed the recipe and served it to 3 of my family memebers, all of which didn't really care for it. I feel like it had a good concept, but needed some heavy whipping cream for a sauce. Won't make it again.

I made this with Trader Joe's portabello mushroom ravioli instead of gnocchi. Very good.

It is easy to prepare and the ingredients are ones that I usually have on hand.

I'm rating this on the sauce, I didn't like the gnocchi maybe it was the kind i bought. But the sauce was excellent! 1/4 teaspoon of salt was wayyyy to much for me and i like salt, but other than that i loved. I also added a 1/4 cup of cream just preference. Next time i'll use a different pasta though.

The first time I made this my boyfriend proclaimed "We eat like Kings!" It's a winner. I used fresh sage. Sometimes I add cut up Canadian bacon near the end or diced leftover cooked chicken. We made this for friends, the husband is Italian. He initially said he didn't like gnocchi (I know, rude is wrong!), but after trying it he ended up eating seconds. Two days later his wife called for the recipe.

Very good, I used fresh sage from my garden and used whole wheat gnocchi. I served it with the "Garlic Chicken" recipe from this website.

Really Good! I've made this a couple of times now, both with fresh  and dried sage. Both were excellent.

OMG - this is one that will stay with our family. Love the simplicity and the taste. I only added a couple of shakes of the parmensean and that was just right for us. Great side dish to "Chicken Breasts with Herb Basting Sauce" found here on All recipes.

I did not think this was good at all, the sage butter sauce has absolutley no flavor to it and the parm cheese seemed to be a waste because I couldnt even taste it which is surprising for the amount of it there is.

I liked this and so did my 2 year old, but my hubby didn't - I think it might have been too much sage.  I think it's a good base for any sort of butter sauce to use on gnocchi, and I will definitely try it again with different herbs and spices!  On the plus side, dinner was ready before the table was set - took me under 10 minutes and that is a bonus!

I didn't really like it. It was okay, but not great. Though it might have been the gnocchi. I've never had gnocchi and used a store bought package. Maybe I just don't like gnocchi.

Loved the taste! Feel like the cheese made it a bit too sticky.

I left the cheese out (didn't want it so salty), and it was still awesome!  Drizzled the sauce over both the gnocchi and some plain cooked chicken.  Yum!  Thanks, Gina!

Great, easy, fast recipe.
Added olive oil with the butter, lots of fresh garlic, and chopped carrots and broccoli.  Then the sage and the parmeasan cheese.
I loved it.  My hubby---well, he decided that he doesn't like the gnocchi, and would have preferred another pasta.  
Great recipe, though.
Thanks!

I made a ricotta gnocchi from this site which went perfectly with this sauce. Wish I had had fresh sage, but the dried worked out nicely. Very good and loved by my family. Thank you!!
