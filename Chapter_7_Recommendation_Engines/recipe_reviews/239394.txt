I made some modifications to this recipe, out of necessity (haven't been shopping in the last week), but I had a fresh pumpkin that I prepped and threw in there, homemade chicken/veggie broth and doubled the Parmesan, since I didn't have any Gruyere in the house. It was delicious and I had to body block the youngsters in my house from gorging on more, so I could have some for leftovers, today. Delicious.

This is the 4th risotto recipe I've tried and it is by far my family's favorite.  I didn't change anything and it is great.  Doubling the recipe and making it for a dinner party tonight.

What a lovely surprise! I cut back slightly on the pumpkin for fear it would put the kids off, but I probably needn't have worried. Yum, yum, and YUM!

Delicious but, of course as most, I modified the recipe to use fresh pumpkin puree and 2 diced serrano peppers instead of cayenne and canned pumpkin. In addition to the substitutions, when adding the fresh pumpkin and chesses at the end I let the risotto remain on the heat to absorb the flavors and set up a bit firmer then the photograph shown. I also doubled the recipe as I was taking it to Thanksgiving dinner for 10 people.
It was a Big favorite among all the friends!
I will make this again and as a lover of spicy food I will double the serrano peppers

Excellent. Best of the various pumpkin risotto recipes I have tried and relatively easy.  Made 6 servings for 3 and no leftovers!  Only change was added the pumpkin to the broth rather than add it at the end.

This was absolutely delicious!!! The broth to rice ratio was way to much I ended up using 2 1/2 cups and probably should of just used two. Great rissoto recipe.

I enjoyed the spice and the pumpkin-y flavor.
