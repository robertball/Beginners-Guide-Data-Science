We really enjoyed this Middle Eastern 'chili' for all the authentic flavors, although calling it 'chili' is kind of a stretch. It definitely is a curry. The diced tomatoes added a bright touch to the dish. I also ground my own chicken thighs as I don't care for the taste of store-bought ground chicken. I also served it over brown basmati rice with Greek yogurt and chopped cilantro, and Naan. Very hearty and tasty. I'm sure to make it again. Thanks, Hunt's!

I liked it! At first, I was skeptical because it was sponsored by Hunts and had not been reviewed or even made by anyone on this site. 
But it's quite tasty. I does not make as much as one might think, but it's very good.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's not spicy  hot enough for my taste. 
The finishing touches of the yogurt and cilantro are key. I'm sure the leftovers will be better tomorrow.

I will definitely make this recipe again. Nice combination of flavors. Only change I made was to alter the amount of Curry paste and Curry powder. That is what is great about good recipes, you can change them slightly to your own tastes. This is also an easy recipe to throw together. Love it.

I was really excited to make this and followed the recipe exactly with 2 minor exceptions: 1) I used ghee instead of vegetable oil and 2) I used lean ground turkey instead of chicken. It was OK but not as good as I had hoped. I've had many coconut & tomato based curries before but this didn't seem familiar to any that I can recall. The best I can describe it is like a mashup of Indian & Thai curries. I did serve it over a whole grain rice I don't normally use (MinuteRice) that wasn't up to par but I accounted for that in my rating. I wish I could be more specific in what it was lacking but I can't put my finger on it. I probably won't make this again nor would I order it in a restaurant but I'd certainly eat it if someone cooked it for me.

This was delicious. I had to make some changes due to availability of ingredients, but it still turned out great. Next time I'll up the spice, and maybe use tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes, mainly for the sake of having more sauce. I served over rice, with cucumber raita from this site on the side, and pita bread (because the grocery store with naan bread was closed today..) very good. And...you forced me to finally make garam masala from scratch. Thank you!

I have made this a few times and my family has enjoyed it. It has a great mix of flavors.  I wouldn't change anything.  As previously mentioned it tastes better the next day so I usually double the recipe.

I want to try this again.

I added red curry and salt as directed, and it's too salty for me. Next time I'll just add salt to taste. The red curry paste that you use is probably an important consideration, as they are likely to all be different.

The texture is good, and you could make this vegetarian and enjoy it.

Used ground turkey instead.  Did not have some of the 'special' ingredients but it worked well anyway.

Not bad, nothing groundbreaking though.  I didn't have red curry paste so I used panang, and it still turned out.  I subbed olive oil for the oil to keep it healthier.  BUT, this is not chili.  If you're expecting chili, you may not like it.  This is definitely a curry type dish.  I also made in the crockpot to simplify, and there was no adverse effect.  I'm looking forward to doing this again with the red curry to see how it turns out.

Delicious!  I used ground turkey the second time I made it and liked it more than with the ground chicken.  My recommendation is to make this a day ahead to give the flavors time to meld.  It's much tastier the second day!

I made this exactly as the recipe directed and it won great reviews from my family.  It was amazingly simple, in spite of what would appear to be a large list of ingredients... there's very little actual prep work required.  It is finished quickly, requires very little time to actually cook, and leaves few pots.  I strongly recommend you use the suggested cilantro and yogurt on top, with the naan bread.  Delicious and it's not so spicy where everyone can't eat it.

Ooooh yummy! Excellent flavor. I shredded 3/4 of a pound of cooked chicken breast instead of using ground chicken. It's slightly spicy, but could use a little more heat. Adding a little crushed red pepper flakes will do the trick. Will definitely make that again.

Tasty recipe. Only change I made was to add a couple teaspoons of cayenne pepper. Next time I think I'll add some turmeric also.

Excellent.  Made with ground turkey and no other changes.  Gonna try chicken sausage next time.  Keeper recipe.  Use real ginger and garam Masala!   Naan was great as a side.  Recommend both the cilantro and yogurt - not optional to me!  I added siracha to mine, hubby didn't.

I made it per the recipe and my whole family loved it.  We definitely agree that the dollop of yogurt was a great addition.  Next time I think I'll use chunks of chicken instead of ground chicken, though, I dunno

Too ordinary for such a fussy recipe. I agree with another reviewer, not spicy enough. I ended up adding sirache to my individual serving afterwards. Either I'm not a fan of garam marsala or 2 tsp. was overkill. It had a slightly odd flavor for a curry, or was it chili? I'm sure the leftovers will be better tomorrow but I won't be making it again thank you.

Yum! This is basically chana masala with chicken but no complaints here! I used chicken breast cut up instead of ground. Also I omitted the cornstatch & extra broth & just added the tomatoes with the juice.  It didn't thicken up too much but who cares? Throw it over rice, mm-mm good!
