I'm always looking for new ways to use healthy quinoa and love this one for breakfast. I substituted the calories from the apple juice for brown sugar:) I used all water to make quinoa and 2 tsp. brown sugar instead of agave. I thought 1 tsp cinnamon might be a little much for this little recipe so I went with 1/2 tsp. Thank you for a nice quinoa breakfast recipe. Next time, I'm gonna try a banana and maybe 1/4 c. blueberries (a staple in my freezer from Costco) combo.

It was missing something - a little plain. I think the adding of some half and half could help.

Not great, but not bad, might be better with maple syrup on top.

There was not enough liquid when it was time to add the apples - I added at least 1/3 cup more water and apple juice to cook the apples. I also added raisins just for fun. I agree with others that it is a little bit bland.  I also think there was too much cinnamon. I would cut it in half if I try it again.

Have been making this every day for breakfast since Thanksgiving (it's Sunday now!) and love it.  I've made it quite a few times over the past year or so too, and I keep coming back to it.  The recipe is perfect in timing and ingredients in my experiences, though I normally put in half the apple at the first 8 minute mark to let it warm up and start sweating before things dry up.  Then I put half #2 in along with a teaspoon of sugar and stir things up real well.  By the time the second 10 minutes has gone by, the apples have gotten incredibly soft and most of the juice has been absorbed by the quinoa or boiled out.  I'm actually wondering if people that are having problems with it getting too dry are simply letting it sit at too high a temperature.  On my electric stove I start at 7/10 and lower it to 3.5/10 when it boils, and cover it.

this was a good recipe! I tweaked to meet my dietary needs I used Fuji apple pear Life water by SoBe instead of the juice. and I used truvia to sweeten. I did add a dash of salt after tasting. but as far as the liquid and cinnamon amounts they seem to be perfect.  maybe those that had trouble with the liquid amounts didn't turn down the heat enough. thanks for sharing

I agree about adding more liquid. The base recepie is good but I did tweak it a little. I added a handful of fresh cranberries while the quinoa and apple juice were boiling and then added some crushed pecans and a little pumpkin pie spice and dialed back on the cinnamon. It was delicious!

needs more liquid than recipe stated and longer cooking time.  Otherwise not bad.

Didn’t have Granny Smith so used a Fuji apple. Otherwise followed recipe. Love this. Just got put on an elimination diet so no grain other than quinoa and rice. This was an absolute wonderful breakfast. I’m hooked.

I used all water, added 1 tsp. raw sugar, a pinch of salt and a pinch of ground cloves. Also I used only 1/2 of a Cortland apple.  A drizzle of maple syrup made it extra special. All in all a good breakfast!!!

Not sure what I could have done wrong! When it came time to add the apples there was NO liquid left and the quinoa had burnt to the bottom of the pan. I did exact measurements and thought it seemed like there wasn't enough liquid but since it was my first time I followed exactly. I never even got to taste it as I only had one apple. I'll try again but any suggestions on the juice/water/quinoa ratio?
