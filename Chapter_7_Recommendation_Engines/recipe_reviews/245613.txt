Holy mackerel, this stuff is good! I could just eat this stuff with a spoon! I made a half batch, and still ended up with quite a bit of pate. I added black pepper in addition to the salt and thyme, and would definitely do that again.  I think this could also be really good with walnuts in place of hazelnuts! Thank you for the recipe!
