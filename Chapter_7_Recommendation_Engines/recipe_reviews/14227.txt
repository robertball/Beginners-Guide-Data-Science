This is a nice change from traditional fruit salad. It tastes GREAT and is healthy! I used less celery,also used golden/white raisens,pecans and whipped orange yogurt. The lemon juice prevents the banana from turning so it does make the salad a little runny- the extra moisture collects at the bottom of the bowl so just mix well before serving or drain a little off,mix and serve--it will not compromise any flavor. Great recipe!

I doubled this recipe to take to a potluck and recieved rave reviews!  I'm allergic to walnuts, so I used pecans instead.  The salad does get a bit watery if you let it sit for a while, but stir it a little and it's fine.  Great summer recipe -- I will definitely make it again!

Thought this was a great refreshing summer salad.  Almost like ambrosia - next time I think I'll had a handful of coconut.

I used tangerine no fat yogurt and skipped the nuts to eliminate fat content.  Delicious and a great way to get kids to eat cole slaw!

More of a dieter's recipe.  I found that those that didn't needed to watch their calories didn't care for the low sugar taste.  Being a former weight watcher, I found this workable with daily exchanges.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe.  It's like fruit salad with cabbage.  Fabulous.  Will make it all the time.  Also, really simple to put together with pre-shredded cabbage.

This salad is great and extremely simple.  We loved it.  We added 2 Tbsp. of dijon mustard for a little more zip.  It was great.

This salad was ok, it was crunchy and had some flavor.  But, I found it a bit watery, had to drain it off a little before serving.  Next time will try to adjust the ingredients a little.  Also, the Banana turned, so next time will try something like Mango.

Mmmmm. This was a hit with my family. I tweeked the recipe just a little though. I sustituted macadamian nuts in place of walnuts. I also sprinkled each seving with some shredded coconut. And because i don't care for celery i passed on that. My banana's came out just fine, turning was not a problem for me. If you allow the banan's to soak up the lemon juice they shouldn't turn. Thanks for the salad!!

Really good! I used a 6 oz. yogurt and omitted the pineapple juice and it wasn't watery. I also used pineapple tidbits.

Pretty good.  I liked how it used orange yogurt for a different kind of slaw.  I didn't use the pineapple juice.  I think this helped not to be so runny as others had complained about.  I also used orange juice instead of lemon juice.  Allergic to nuts, so skipped it.  I did add a dash of vinegar for a little tang.

I didn't have all of the ingredients to make the salad, but enough to get the idea . . .  Received compliments on it.  I'm looking forward to making it again.  Thanks!

I read the reviews about the runniness, so I left out the pineapple and lemon juices.  Made this morning for the evening's dinner, and consistency was good with using only orange Greek yogurt. I did squeeze just a little lemon juice over the bananas to keep them from discoloring.  The one thing that I didn't like was that the bananas turned mushy after being refrigerated all day.  If I were to to anything differently the next time, it would be to cut back the walnuts a little (personal taste preference).  I liked the sweetness contrast with the crunchiness of the cabbage, but I don't know overall if I liked this well enough to make it again.
