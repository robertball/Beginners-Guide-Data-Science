This was dinner tonight. I made a couple small changes only because it's the day before Grocery Day and I wanted to use what I had on hand. Instead of celery seed (which I did not have), I used Beau Monde seasoning (not the all purpose Beau Monde, the kind that is basically onion powder and celery salt), I used all chopped red pepper and Steam Fresh frozen whole green beans. Terrible name or not, my whole family loved this soup.......even the picky youngest child. I have to admit I was sketchy about using jarred three bean salad but it totally works. Great flavors, awesome combination of ingredients! I paired this with homemade Skillet Rolls and it was a very comforting and filling meal.

That is a terrible name for this soup.  The soup is very good though.

I was apprehensive that this soup would be over-seasoned, but made exactly as written it was exceptional,,, one of the best soups I've ever tasted, period. Next time, I might add the zucchini a little later as it was a bit too soft for my liking.

I really like this soup. It yields a lot so it’s going to last us all week! I made a few changes: I did not add any bell peppers, I used potatoes and corn instead. I also added Parmesan cheese. I used dill weed instead of celery seed. Can’t wait to eat again for lunch tomorrow!! So yummy

We found this to be really tangy which I'm assuming is from the three bean salad. It just wasn't for us.

I remaned this soup I've died and gone to heaven soup. It is that good. I will make two changes next time and that is 1 tbl of olive oil instead of 3 and 2 tbls of butter instead of 1/2 cup.  I also used rotel mild diced tomatoes but will use regular diced next time.

I never made a minestrone soup before but this one will be part of my regular favorites !  Loved the flavor result from all the spices...it was so smooth and delicious.  To make it more hearty for my carnivorous husband I added a 1 lb. tube of browned Jones pork sausage and 3 links of Italian spiced  chicken sausage sliced.  This rounded out the flavors and really fills you up !  
Yes, will make again!

I’ve made this several times, everyone loves it!  I did change two things...I added a bit more pasta and substituted one 15.5 oz. organic, low sodium red kidney beans for the three bean salad.

Took a big chance making this for a dinner at church, not knowing how it would turn out since I had never made it before.  I tripled the recipe, made no changes and it was delicious.  Several requested the recipe and I told them where to find it.  Will definitely be making this again and again.  I may cut back on the amount of butter and olive oil.  I think it will not make too much of a difference to the outcome.

Was a hardy soup and is flexible with your ingredients.  I only used 1/2 the tomato sauce and not the three bean salad.  To keep it vegetarian, I used 4 cups of vegetable broth.

this soup is excellent!  made it as described, except I forgot the green beans so added a frozen mix of corn, green beans and carrots.  I also added a couple handfuls of spinach at the end for added nutrition.  I will definitely make this again and again.  Hit the spot perfectly!

Very flavorful, wasn't sure how it would taste with the can of three bean salad, but it was great. The only thing I did differently was I put in 1 cup of macaroni, 3 stalks of celery, and 2-3 carrots, and I did not add a Bay Leaf. I got more than 6 servings from it.

This soup was delicious and flavorful, and easy to make! I made a few tweaks based on preference. I don't care for squash, so I put some corn in, even if that's not a traditional thing to put in minestrone! And I doubled the amount of pasta. I couldn't find a can of "three bean salad," so I got a three bean medley instead. It didn't have any seasonings, just 3 different kinds of bean. I also used vegetable broth instead of chicken since my daughter is vegetarian. She's picky, but  she said it was good! My husband liked it too. I'll definitely make it again.

We loved this soup!  I cut the recipe in half for two of us- it still made quite a bit. I forgot to add the zucchini, but it was still fantastic.  This will be in the rotation for sure!

I loved it! Great flavor and very hearty. Thank you. I omitted the squash and used only frozen green beans and it worked great. Next time I will add more carrots, canned green beans and double the broth because we love broth! Thanks again!

Very nice!  Made it just per the recipe.  Was so delicious.  My husband & I ate it for a week.  No salad, but did do the garlic cheese bread.  Hmmmm wonderful fall meal & lasted a full week for 2 people!

Pretty good. I always leave pasta separate so it doesn't get mushy but other than than I followed the recipe exactly. We liked it but found it slightly sweet. Really don't know why.

Delicious soup.  I didn't change a thing.  Even served it with garlic bread and a simple salad.
Not sure why some reviewers said the name is 'terrible'.  Minestrone means 'to serve'.
Thanks so much, Styx1017, for Fat Granny's Minestrone.

I have to say that I have never been a big minestrone fan..that being said I made this today and it is by far one of the best soups I have ever had.  The seasonings are spot on and the veggie choices are perfect.   Thank you for sharing

Used some kind of veggie Mac noodles. I've never heard of 3 bean salad, almost just skipped it.  Glad I didn't, I think it's a key ingredient making this soup kick some serious tail!

This soup was delicious! And has so much potential! I made it as is and the only change was I added a little more pasta. It was delicious and a hit with the whole family even my picky 5 year old! I will definitely be making this again. The spices are perfect. I wouldn't change those a bit. If I made any changes it would be just added more or different vegetables. But I have every intention of make this as is again! Thank you!

Made a few adjustments (added potatoes, different pasta) but otherwise the recipe was fantastic! I'm definitely going to make it again when I run out.
