OMG this is a great recipe I first tried the pumpkin custard at Cracker Barrel it was served with ginger snap cookies and a caramel mousse it was awesome well this recipe is much much better I made the cookies and the mousse really guys this is better then anything you can get in a resturant just a few extra steps and WOW give it a try instead of brulee add ginger snap cookies smashed up on top and caramel mousse yum.

Excellent alternative to pumpkin pie - it was delicious - I'd never made a brulee before, so I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!

Excellent!!! I went a little lighter on the brulee layer as I wanted it to break a little easier for guests. A total hit at the party. DO TRY THIS ONE!!!

Oh, wow! Super delicious! I love this recipe!! As Chef John says right off the bat, this does NOT have the same texture as a creme brulee, so no one should be disappointed or lower their rating because of this, but it does have its own wonderful, creamy texture and a flavor that is amazing. Thanks Chef John - another winner!!

I will make this instead of pumpkin pie next Thanksgiving! Delish. I would HIGHLY recommend straining this mixture before filling the ramekins :)

I knew it would be like this, but I missed the silky creamy custard of a true creme brulee. It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but the pumpkin texture just made it like a fancy crustless pie.  Nothing to be done for that with this recipe, and my kids thought the torch was the coolest thing ever...

Very easy to make, although not as creamy as "regular" creme brulees. I used my broiler since I didn't have a working torch; the results didn't look as good but did not affect the taste.

Wonderful! Creme Brulee is probably my favorite dessert, but this was the first time I've ever tried to make it myself. This recipe was easy. It made a wonderful Thanksgiving dessert ... just right after an extravagant dinner. I made it exactly as described. My 6 ounce ramekins were shallower and larger in area than pictured, so I could have baked them a bit less ... 25 to 30 minutes. Note too, that it takes a while to flame these. It took some time to do 12.

I really liked this recipe but that it was a little different than usual creme brulee texture. My kids actually ate it and it was nice to see something different and super easy to make.

Delicious!  I have made this for Thanksgiving before, but now we have a wheat allergy in the family and can't have pie or trifle or Pumpkin Gooey Butter Cake (we like to change things up sometimes...). Yes, the texture is a little different from regular creme brûlée, but this is a perfect mixture  of smooth and spice with that wonderful brûlée crust. This will be our new "pumpkin pie" -- thank you , Chef John!

The pumpkin puree ruins the texture of the Creme Brulee, and using white sugar on the top absolutely does not work. I think I would just add pumpkin pie spice to a regular Creme Brulee to add a holiday flair.

This one is a keeper, because:

* You mix it up in one bowl with a whisk, throw it into a baking dish or ramekins placed in a larger pan of water, and into the oven.  SO easy!

* Blow-torching food is always in style.  And fun.

* Delicious! Nice balance of flavors, sweetness, creaminess.

* Great presentation, in a larger dish (I used a clay cazuela) or in ramekins.

Note: The custard is light and delicate.  If you prefer a firmer custard, add one additional egg yolk.

Made the pumpkin puree myself for this creme brulee. Unfortunately the creme did not get "thick" (so stayed a bit too loose). I'm gonna give it another shot soon, but I'll use a bit less heavy cream than recommended.
But nevertheless the taste was excellent and everybody loved it!
Update: I found out that my selfmade pumpkin puree was not perfect - had too much moisture in it. This time the puree turned out perfect (let i drain for quite some time) and so did the „brulee“.

This is delicious. The only changes I made were using deep dish ramekins and cooking it longer at a slightly lower temperature. I did spray some canned whipped cream in the the corner after I melted thew sugar with my brand new Galiner Culinarian's Lighter!! I might just go out next time I need to enjoy this, if I can find a locale up to spec!

This recipe with simple and easy to make and very tasty but it took much longer to bake than 30 minutes. I even had to turn up the heat to 350 and bake it for another 30 minutes because it was still liquid. After the extended baking it turned out fine.

I didn't bother with the burnt sugar on top because I don't have blow torch and don't need the extra sugar. It was good without it. Next time I will definitely double the recipe to make more.

I think every time I make a Chef John recipe, I feel it's the best thing I ever made!  My only issue was that apparently my ramekins are too large, as it barely filled seven.  (I made two batches to have 14; I could have easily poured them both into the original seven.)  The taste was delicious.  Of course the texture is not that of normal crème brûlée, but the comparative ease of preparation was a gift as I prepared 15 dishes myself over 3 days for Thanksgiving this year.  This was gluten-free for my niece without making her feel left out, and my father-in-law loved it - ate two and took another home for later!

Unfortunately 35 min was not enough time to cook the creme brulee.  Increase cooking time for an additional 10 - 15 minutes to have the creme brulee to be "set".  

If you cook for 30 - 35 minutes, the middle will still be raw and the dish will be inedible.

I cooked this in a deep casserole dish, and served it with molasses spice cookies and whipped cream. So yummy! My mom who doesn't like pumpkin pie spice style things loved it, and so did my dad who doesn't like pumpkin!

What an easy delicious change from pumpkin pie.  If you're not used to using a Brulee torch, like me, you will get the hang of it each time you use one.  This is a keeper recipe in my house.
