This was much better than the stuff that comes in a can. If you have the time, I would definitely recommend that the next time you make enchiladas you use this sauce.

We halved this recipe, pureed the crushed tomatoes, and left out the chunky onions and bell peppers.  We ended up with an amazing thick-but-smooth, perfectly spiced red sauce!  Just spicy enough to be interesting, but not too hot to eat.  I used this with a copycat recipe for Taco Bell enchiladas, and the results were 100 times better than any fast food place or restaurant!  The sauce really made the meal, and a half recipe made enough for 5 large enchiladas (and we used a lot of sauce).  Truly this is a must have for any Mexican or Tex-Mex meals we make in the future!

The flavor is wonderful, but I want an enchilada sauce that is thinner, saucier, like the kind on restaurant enchiladas. Next time I will either use two cans tomato sauce in place of the crushed tomatoes or thin it out with broth. Also, I used 1/4 cup chili powder because I didnt want the heat to be overpowering, and it came out just right!

This sauce is so yummy!  I don't even like enchilada sauce.  I made this and even used the left over on a pasta and it was still great.   I have started to do a couple things different to make it healthier.  I use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. For step 1 I toss all the same stuff into a blender.  I do saute the onion and bell pepper.  After I combine them all I don't cook them on the stove.  I put the cold mixture onto the enchiladas and just heat it long enough to make it warm enough to eat   It is quicker and easy.  It also uses less heat so it doesn't kill as many nutrients.

Deeeelish! I added a few fresh poblanos and jalapenos that I happened to have on hand. Pureed the heck out of the sauce for a smoother texture, and viola! Great flavor.Elaine in CA.

Easy and yummy enchilada sauce!  I thought it had just the right amount of spice and flavor.  The only thing I changed was I substituted olive oil for butter.

My first time making this enchilada sauce was a big success!  I may add more chipotle for a little extra zing next time, but you can bet I'll be making it again very soon.  I suggest doubling or tripling the recipe and making it ahead and freezing if you're going to be using it in other recipes.  It's that good!

This recipe is okay. I guess if you are used to using canned enchilada sauce, this sauce is a couple of steps up. It's definately not a traditional enchilada sauce, it was more like spaghetti sauce with chile in it.

This was wonderful, but only after some modifications, thus the 4 star rating. Substituted one can of tomato sauce for one can of beef broth to thin out the sauce and make it less "tomatoey". It was just the right thickness then, and the way most restaurants serve it. Also, I sauteed the onions and bell pepper (chopped in large chunks) together and then added the rest of the sauce ingredients. I used garlic powder instead of minced garlic and added a little more salt then stated. I simmered the sauce for 20 min., then to make my enchiladas, I turned the heat down low and dipped my corn tortillas in the sauce as I made them. I then covered my enchiladas with the sauce and smothered everything with shredded cheese. Delish!

Wow this recipe made a lot! I doubled it for expected company and made two very large pans of enchiladas and still had half a pot of sauce left.  However, it was very tastey and everyone raved over how good it tasted.  I did substitute dried cilantro for oregano since I don't care for oregano.  And I substitued the bell pepper with a mild chilie pepper. Very very good! I will definitly make this again and freeze any extras.

This is exactly what we were looking for in an "authenic" tasting enchilada sauce!  It made a ton - had a lot left over.  We will definitely make this again!

I liked the nice, thick texture the crushed tomatoes gave the sauce. But for me, the flavor just didn't hit the mark. And the nice, thick texture gave the feel that this sauce was trying to decide whether it was a texmex condiment or, like a previous reviewer said, an Italian-style tomato sauce with chili powder and cumin added. Not a winner for me.

I won't buy canned sauce anymore. We actually made this to pour over burritos. I can't wait to try it with enchiladas soon!  We left out the onions and bell peppers and still tasted great.  Didn't want chunky sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

I think this recipe turns out great... if you use a bit less chili powder than it calls for.  I use about 1/8 cup.  I also sometimes leave out the onion and bell pepper and I havent noticed a difference either way.  Goes great with Chicken Enchiladas I from this site!

This deserves to be the first recipe I rate on here... it was AWESOME.  I made a few minimal changes due to what I had on hand: I used one 15 oz can of tomato sauce and lightly blended about 5 roma tomatoes.  I did not have regular chili powder, so I used a couple teaspoons of cayenne pepper and a few splashes of tapatio (cheating a little with that).  I followed the rules for everything else.  I will never buy canned enchilada sauce again!  Chili powder is on my shopping list for next time.  This was perfect, thank you!!  By the way, I was eating it out of the pot ;).

My husband, who is from Texas, didn't like this sauce.  However, he is very picky about his Texmex and cooking in general.  He likes the sauce you can find at Mexican food restaurants in South Texas.

nice, i read all the reviews and used both onion and bell pepper bc my family loves those flavors. i agree it was a bit too thick but didn't bother to put it in the blender.  my mexican husband told me it tasted delicious but "white" and if i'm honest - it was really labor intensive and probably a bit more expensive than buying a $3 can of Las Palmas. haha

I used this sauce when i made spinach enchiladas. It went really well together. I think I would use a bit less salt next time though. A bit messy (make sure that lid's on tight!) but tasted great!

This was my first attempt at enchilada sauce and I have to say it is a keeper.  I really loved this I pureed this in the blender after I finished it was incredible.  I think I did cut the chili powder down to about 3 tablespoons as this was all I had on hand. You have got to try this. Bet it would be great canned for gifts!

Cutting this down to three servings made just enough for one pan of enchiladas. I used organic tomato sauce, fire-roasted tomatoes, california chili pepper, doubled all the spices, used four cloves garlic and added about a half cup of diced organic cilantro. This was a bit thick, so I added about a cup of V-8. I think next time, I might puree it, for a thinner consistancy. I always am taken aback by the quality of homemade ingredients over canned and this was no exception. Using organic ingredients just took it over the top.

A wonderful enchilada sauce! I doubled the recipe,  used 1 cup with 2 cups chicken broth and 1 cup rice to make Mexican Rice.  Turned out better than you find in restaurants! One guest stated that he does not eat the rice at Mexican restaurants, but this was excellent! I also used a hand blender and blended until smooth.  We are not "chunky sytle" eaters.  The rest of the sauce was frozen for future use! Truly a wonderful sauce.

I was unable to find packaged enchilada sauce, so I used this recipe....very nice flavour. I suggest adding just a pinch of cinnamon.

Very good and simple to make. The only modification I made was running it through the blender so the kiddos wouldn't fuss about the chunks of tomato. I used this as a substitute to the packaged sauce call for in the Beef Enchilada II recipe.

Delicious! I forgot to purchase my green enchilada sauce and had to make my own, so I tried this one and ....WOW....YUMM! Will not be purchasing my green sauce anymore, this one was so easy to make and tasted great!

I just love this recipe! I made a few tweaks like reduce the chili powder to 2 Tbl. I also saute the onions, garlic and bellpepper first and then throw everything else in the pot. I run it through the blender to make it kid friendly!

Great reicpe!  I double it and throw all the ingredients in the crockpot (minus the butter).  Cooks on low while we're at work.  We add more kick with a jalepeno or habenero pepper(s) as well.  I use a handblender if I find it too chunky, and freeze the leftovers for another time.  Just a note...You don't need to add salt if using canned tomtoes/sauce, and you can really reduce the sodium with salt-free canned tomatoes and sauce, without affecting the flavor.

This was great - I've been looking for an enchilada sauce recipe and this sounded easy and based on the reviews it seemed it would be a success.  I normally follow recipe's to a "T" the first go around, however, all I had was a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles, so I pureed them in my blender and then followed the recipe as written.  Incredibly easy and delicious!

Last fall - when the tomato crop was overwhelming me - I tried this recipe to use some of them. I substituted 41 ounces of chopped (then slightly drained), fresh tomatoes that I pureed in the blender in lieu of the tomato sauce and crushed tomatoes. I canned it in pint jars, and it freezes well, too.

This recipe was delicious!   I needed sauce for my hot dish for which I normally buy a can of enchilada sauce.  I am glad I decided to search for a homemade recipe and am glad I came across this one.  I did however cut the ingredients in half and altered some.  Here is what I used as well as the rest of my beef enchilada hotdish recipe.

First brown 1 lb hamburger using a packet of taco seasoning, use instructions on the package.  Set aside.

Heat 1 can of refried beans.  Set aside.

You will need 6  tortillas. 

2 cups of shredded cheese (a bag)

Now make the recipe for the sauce.  

    *  1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce
    * 1 (16 ounce) can crushed tomatoes not drained
    *  3 tablespoons of chili powder
    * 1/2  tablespoon dried oregano
    * 1/2  teaspoon paprika
    * 1 teaspoons ground cumin
    * 1 teaspoons ground black pepper
    * 1/4 teaspoon salt
    * 1 tablespoon of garlic powder
    * 1 tablespoon of onion powder

Boil  and simmer for 15 minutes.

While this is simmering, prepare the hotdish.

Spray  a 9x12 pan with pam and then place 6-8 flour tortillas folded in half,  ready to fill.

In each tortilla layer with refried beans, handful of cheese, taco meat, 2 large tablespoons full of  enchilada sauce.

Fold each tortilla like you would a taco.  

Pour remaining enchilada sauce and cheese over the top.  

Bake at 350 for 20 minutes or until the cheese melts on top.

Yes. I was looking for something different to put over spaghetti that would go with bbq ribs. This turned out great.  A little too much chili powder for my husband, but I loved it. The rest of the party loved it too.

I thought this was good! Not sure why I don't want to give it five stars, but didn't quite seem 5 to me. Would have given it 4 1/2 if I could have. I made it with diced tomatoes (1 regular and 1 can red pepper & fennel). I put it all in my food processor to blend it and smooth out the tomatoes. I added the sauteed onion, green pepper and garlic to the tomatoes, sauce and spices in the food processor.

Good, but overpowering for me.  I also thought it was too thick, maybe I should add a bit of water or more tomato sauce.

This beats anything out of a can any day!  Once you use this, you won't go for the canned stuff again.  This recipe makes a lot and it freezes really well, too.  I just pour any extra into zip lock bags and pop them in the freezer.  Thanks for this recipe!

This sauce was really good. This was my first time making enchiladas and my children can be picky so I really wasn't sure what recipe to go with. I'm glad I went with this one, we all gobbled it up. I just cut back on the chili powder a good bit and used pureed tomatoes instead of crushed. Thanks for the recipe!

I changed servings to 4. I used 1 can tomato sauce, 1 can diced tomatoes crushed in processor, 3T chili powder, 1T oregano, 1/2t cumen, 1t pepper, 1/2t salt, pinch of cinnamon, 1 clove minced garlic, 1/2 onion and 1/2 green pepper. I followed directions then mixed 1/2 sauce with 1 shredded chicken breast and 3/4 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese. Heated 2 corn tortillas in damp paper towel in micro. Put 2 heaping T down center of tortilla and rolled. Placed seam side down in sprayed dish. I made 6 fat enchiladas. Poured rest of sauce over. Topped with 3/4 cup cheese. Put on dish lid, Baked 350 for 25 min. This was outstanding! Might reduce chili powder to 2T next time. Might saute gn. pepper with onion in olive oil. This makes plenty of sauce. I could have stretched it to make 12 enchiladas.

I used this as a base, fudging the amounts of seasonings and it came out good.  Not as good as I'd hoped, but much better than the store bought brands I've been using.  I added a touch of Hot picante sauce too.

I was not very impressed with this recipe. I was quite disappointed because it had pretty good reviews. Way too much chili powder and I used less than 1/4 of a cup. Also not the good spicy flavour that mexican food should have. Anyway will most likely not make this again.

I followed this recipe exactly and I can't see what everyone is raving about.  I'm from North Texas and was expecting something more like a Ranchero Sauce.  No offense, but there is way too much chili powder in this for my taste.

Really good- not traditional but we loved it. Bell peppers really sweeten it up and add depth. Let it cook a while to develop flavor. Changes: I sautéed the bell pepper with the onion and used smoked paprika.

For how easy this is, it's definitely 5 stars :)  I used my immersion blender to puree everything up at the end, to get a smooth sauce.  Very yummy and everyone enjoyed!!

Love it! But on the tomato sauce i subbed half with chicken stock, used fresh tomato instead of canned (blended in food processor), subbed dried cilantro instead of oregano (figured that had alot to do with the spaggetti sauce comments) and used some chili peppers i was needing something to do with instead of bell. The onion and peppers i put in a food processor till smooth, i wanted a less chunky sauce... otherwise followed the instructions exactly :) Scrumptious!!!!

Marginally better than canned.  But much easier than cooking my own tomato sauce.  Good for weeknight meals when I don't want to spend much time.

Excellent! Due to the fact I did not have any crushed tomatoes, I used 1 15oz can of diced tomatoes chopped in my mini chopper till they had the consistancy of crushed. I  also used 1 10oz can of tomatoes and green chilies (my husband and I love heat in our foods). It added a great kick, but still had abundant flavor. I also sauted the onion in extra virgin olive oil instead of butter for I'm not a big fan of butter. This recipe was delicious and made alot. Thank-you so much for sharing it.

This was a great change from our regular enchiladas.  I usually use store bought enchilada sauce.  It was sweet and more of a tomato flavor than we are used to.  Will definitely make again.

I couldn't believe how much better my enchiladas tasted using this sauce versus the kind from the can.  I made enough to make three batches of enchiladas, and just froze the extra servings for the next time I needed it.

It was amazing.   I thought it would be too spicy with that much chili powder but over the tamales and with some sour cream it was perfect.  I left out the green peppers because I didn't have any.

This is really really good!  I have made it twice now and love it.  I use half for enchiladas and the other half I put in the crock pot with raw ck breast and cook several hours until chicken shreds easily.  We eat it like tacos on corn tortillas, or my fav is the ck on top of a crispy corn tortilla with a hard fried egg on it for breakfast.  Sprinkled with feta cheese and avocado slices it is just like a dish I had a brunch at the Four Seasons in Dallas, TX.  Delish!!

Good stuff!  I didn't have the onion so I couldn't put that in but everything else went in and it turned out great!!  (Although I did decrease the amount of chili powder due to my grandma not liking that particular spice very well).  It made my enchiladas taste great!!  Definitely be using this recipe again!! :)

I thought it should get a 5 stars but my husband said it was good but not great. I did however follow some advice of some other reviewers and left out the bell pepper because I didn't have it. I also used a 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and 3 fresh roma tomatoes and blended them up for a thinner sauce instead of the 24 oz can of crushed tomatoes it called for. I also blended the onion after cooking it. My husbands main thing with it was that even after blending it, it was still a bit thicker of a sauce than we usually buy. I think it is worth a try. I loved it. I am sure it would be good with the bell pepper as well. I will make again for sure.

This was a great sauce and simple to make.  I cut the onions and peppers into big chunks and sauteed then added the other ingredients then pureed it with an immersion blender.

I thought this sauce was excellent and not difficult to make.  I skipped the baking step and just rolled up chicken stuffing in corn tortillas and splashed the sauce on top.  I let everything soak for a minute and then served with cheese on the side.  It is great for those with dairy allergies in the family.  This way the little one could eat the chicken and tortillas and the rest of us could still enjoy the cheese.  I served with guacamole and Best Black Beans from this site.

This was my first atempt making enchilada sauce and I don't think I can ever use the sauce from the store again. I only omitted green bell pepper because I didn't have any. Very easy to make and tasted very good.

4 stars for the recipe as is. It has a nice mild to medium heat to it. I did put a little over 1/2 of the sauce in a blender (our son wont eat it if its "chuncky") to smooth it out. I made chicken enchilada's (1/2 with smooth mix, 1/2 with chuncky) and I used the rest of the smooth sauce to put on top while baking. Next time I think I'll use jalapeno's and chile's instead of a green pepper and add some cilantro.

Fabulous flavor! I like Mexican food mild to medium heat, and so I cut the chili powder in half. That was the perfect heat for my family. I also added some extra salt. Yummy with my favorite bean and cheese enchilada recipe!

I did not care for this recipe. In my opinion, for a REAL enchilada sause you use cream and/or a good broth, not tomatoes.

Makes delicious enchiladas....a few suggestions....reduce chili powder to 1/4 cup, add diced jalapeno when you add the onions, replace 28 oz can tomatoes with one can of rotel and one can of petite diced tomatoes.

This was pretty good, however next time I will tweak it a bit. I didn't find it all that spicy so I will add some chiles or something. I would also lessen the crushed tomatoes as I found this made it too thick. A great base recipe though!

My boyfriend and I made this last night and it was delicious.  It tastes like real enchilada sauce.  We did substitute crushed tomatos for tomato paste and water because of the comments about texture and we don't have a blender or food procesor. And we completely left out chili powder (we didn't have any).  Tastes good to us!

This sauce was fabulous. My boyfriend loved it and took the leftovers to the "girls" at the office for their lunch.  I used the Spinach Enchilada recipe from this site as well as the Mexican Rice and had a huge hit for dinner and the day after.

My family loves enchiladas but we were getting tired of the same old store bought sauce.  I tried this and now it's all I will use.  It's excellent.  I like to add a couple of more cloves of garlic and puree it in the food processor like another reviewer mentioned.  This recipe makes a lot but it freezes well.  My stepson even asked if he could have the recipe so he can make it when he moves out.
