I cut all the ingredients in this recipe in half EXCEPT the garlic and garlic powder. Huge hit with the boys--they ate every single piece.

Made for recipe group. I used vienna bread, sliced the whole loaf in half, spread on the mix, it was enough to cover both halves, wrapped in foil and grilled on the top rack. I put it on, then put on the steaks, turned it every time I checked the steaks, took it off, just starting to blacken the bread. It was good, son said 7 stars. We have another cheesy bread recipe we really like, but this was good! Thanks TOH!

This bread tastes wonderful, but following the recipe I ended up with a lot of burned spots!  I used Smart Balance in the cheese mixture, (it was nice and buttery tasting).  I cooked it for the 15 mins. on the grill, (turning it halfway), on medium heat.  Next time I will only cook on low heat, and yes there will be a next time!

Yum!  Made exactly as written.  My family absolutely loved it.  I used a dual-side fire (one side hot, the other cooler) and cooked it on the cooler side of the grill.

This was fabulous and so easy! I used Smart Balance as well and it turned out great. No on knew the difference. Mine cooked a bit faster so just watch you time. We will be doing this often! Thanks!

I enjoyed this recipe tons. I added some chopped jalapenos to the spread mixture and served it with stewed beef. This bread dipped in that gravy was very delicious. Thanks for posting.

Very good.  I cut back on the butter a little & still excellent!

WOW!  This tasted so fresh and delicious!  I made it twice: once with Parisian loaf (which was much crunchier and a hard bread), and once on deli rolls (very soft).  I could focus more on the taste of this spread when the bread was softer, and not so hard to get my teeth through, but consider toasting the soft bread a little for a little crunch.  DELISH!!!

I originally gave this a 4, but it actually tastes a lot better the next day! So from now on I will make a batch the day before I plan on serving it.

I thought this was good. This would be a great accompaniment to spaghetti or chili or soups too. I also opted to bake in the oven at 375*for 20 minutes. It came out with just the right crustiness. I will try this on the grill next time I barbecue. We liked it!

I made this for Recipe Group and we really, REALLY liked this! I only wanted to make a half of loaf of bread, but I'm glad that I still made the full amount of spread because I used it all. I can't really see how this would be enough spread for an entire loaf, front and back of each slice, but maybe I'm just heavy-handed, lol! I did sub dried parsley for fresh because that's all I had. I baked this in the oven, as per the footnotes @ 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Easy, cheesy and VERY YUMMY! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was amazing and easy to do.  Will certainly become a regular for us.  We sliced the bread in half length wise to make it simpler.

I made this for friends while camping, and they loved it.  I'll be making it again, but I'll be making 2 next time.  I used an Italian loaf and mozzarella cheese because that's what I had.  Absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be trying it with the cheddar.

Very simple to put together.  We cooked it on the BBQ.  The kids just loved it. Very very good and easy.

The family loved this. Even my picky wife who hates everything new.
