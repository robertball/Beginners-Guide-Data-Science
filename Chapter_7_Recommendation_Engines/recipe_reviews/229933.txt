These were so good and so easy.  I used celery salt because that's all I had on hand.  Will make again for sure.  Thanks for sharing this gem.

Very good. I added a clove of minced garlic and some black pepper. I also flipped the uncooked biscuits over in tye butter/seasoning mixture to coat both sides before baking.

These are delicious!  I did not put the cheese in the bottom of the pan.  I made double the butter mix with some garlic powder and then sprinkled a generous portion of freshly grated parm on top.  Loved 'em!

I wasn't super keen on this. next time I think I will use dough balls or cut crescent pieces. I found them very dryish. I think they would be good sweet...brown sugar, pecans or walnuts some allspice, cinnamon ect. I'll try it again with some tweaks, its really easy and adds to a meal as a nice side treat.

Wow, so easy, so good! Kids devoured these. It's easy to adjust the seasoning to your taste & do variations. I seasoned with a little garlic powder, onion powder, & dill then baked for 10 minutes at 425. Looked really pretty too!

These are so quick and easy and very tasty. Made them for my book club and got rave reviews.
