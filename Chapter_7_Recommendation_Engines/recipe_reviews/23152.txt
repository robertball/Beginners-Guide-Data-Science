My entire family loved this stew!  I cooked the floured meat right in my soup pot and deglazed it with the liquid.  Perhaps that is why mine came out nice and thick, not at all like a soup.  I used half beef broth and half water with a touch of better than bouillon for the water.  I used petite-diced tomatoes, less celery, and added some frozen peas at the end of cooking for both color and flavor.  This was comfort food at it's best!

Deeelicious!! This beef stew made a wonderful bowlful of delicious beef chunks, gravy and vegetables. Once I added the vegetables (carrots, potatoes) I only cooked it another 30 minutes because I did not want the veggies to overcook. It was perfect. We went through a whole loaf of sourdough bread making sure every last drop was gone.

This stew is stick to your ribs hearty and delicious. I thickened it at the end with about a 1/4 cup of flour water. My husband commented that the flavors blend beautifully - no one flavor over-powers the other. I agree!

This recipe as it stands is very good hence the 5 stars but there are a couple of things I'd like to point out.

First browning 3 pounds of meat is no easy task, you have to do it in batches and make sure you use a non-stick pan.  I made some medallions for my brother and I just using the browning part while we waited for the stew and it was fantastic and tender.

I followed other suggestions and used 2 cups beef stock, I think the 3 cups of water with the bouillon would have definitely been to soupy.

I was also a little skeptical on the amount of wine but it turned out to be just fine in the end.

I agree with a lot of other readers that you should rate a recipe based on as is no tweaks, if you want to tweak it then post your own recipe for review.  This one as is, is fantastic and will definitely be a keeper in our house.  Thank you very much for the post.

Very good!!!!! I added all and threw in the crock pot and everyone loved it, I did have to thicken it with flour to get a more stew like base. Once I got into peeling the pearl onions I almost left them out but it was worth all the work, that is the only difficult part about this , time consuming peeling those tiny little onions!!!!

Simple and tastey!  Just the way we like it.  The only change that we made was we added halved mushrooms at the same time as the rest of the vegetables and it worked out excellent.

Very good. I added extra wine and eliminated the beef bouillon cubes (they usually have MSG - best avoided).  Water worked just fine.  Used herbes de provence rather than any individual herbs - quite tasty.  No extra flour needed at the end - just didn't put as much liquid in to begin with. Put just enough in to cover the meat, then add a bit more when veggies are added. Uncover for 10 mins at end to reduce the liquid so it's thick.

Delicious. I did substitute Ribeye for the stew beef and added a touch of worstershire sauce plus corn for the carrots. Easy to make for a single man like me and once refrigerated it lasted for two weeks.

this stew is awesome! people that said it was bland lack imagination ;)
cool things to add: portobello mushrooms, sun dried tomatoes, red chili powder, and a little brown sugar.
also, it helps to have some extra red wine and tomato pure on hand, as mine was a little thick and i went back and forth from adding these two liquids versus adding more water. (we like it thick)
**major bonus:** there was enough left over that i didnt have to make lunch the next day.

A good, basic beef stew recipe.  I browned the meat  in flour and placed it in a 5-quart crockpot.   I used beef broth (1 can) rather than water and beef boullion, 3 stalks celery rather than six per personal  taste.  The ingredients filled the crockpot to the rim and were cooked for 8 hours on low.    The stew was rated five by the family, but by personal taste we'll replace the wine with additional beef broth and add a can of Rotel tomatoes next time.  The broth seemed thin while cooking, but thickened up well as it cooled.

Five star +  I added a little bit more red wind and it was just great.
Everyone loved the stew.  Even my wife who never eats beef stew loved it.  Great recipe.

A lovely, comforting stew.  I added mushrooms as well and I think that complimented the wine flavors.  I too had to add flour to make it thicker (i just added 1/4 cup at the beginning and spooned in a couple more at the end).  I also did this on a stovetop and let it cook on a low heat for a total of 4.5 hours- worth it!!

Great - I made some changes, which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars. I doubled the amount of wine and water because it seemed to be thick. Also, added spices just to taste, and left out the celery and pearl onions. Great, heart stew for a cold winter day. Wonderful flavor!

I found the secret to this stew, as with many hearty dishes is to use my cast iron stew pot.  Start with a good chuck roast.  Then brown the meat in the cast iron stew pot, deglaze that with whatever you like - a bit of beef broth, red wine what ever.  Also - use the low salt beef broth - I think it's heartier and less salty than the bouillon. I like to control the amount of salt in a dish.

Serve with fresh biscuits or warm bread - KNOCK OUT

My entire family loved this stew! I used beef broth instead of boullion cubes/water and reduced the liquid to 2 cups to make it less soupy. Very, very yummy!

Not great by any means, but not bad either. Much more bland than I was expecting. Whenever I explore a recipe with beef and red wine as primary focal points, I just expect a bit more depth and richness to the end result. Since we love homemade beef stew though, my husband and I still went through it fairly quickly. This recipe's flavors and textures ("gravy" was a thin even with all the flour from the beef) left enough to be desired that I won't use this recipe again. Again, not bad, but too subtle for our tastes.

this was a very good basic stew recipe that is easy to tweak based on personal preferences. the red wine really gives it a nice rich flavor! i omitted the water and beef bouillon and used about 4 cups all natural beef broth and 1 1/2 cups red wine for my liquid. also added a bay leaf and a few tablespoons of worcestershire. used sweet potatoes instead of white since my hubby and i try to avoid white potatoes. will definitely make again!

cooked in the crockpot.  i didn't sear the meat first, but did coat with flour.  added a small can of v-8 instead of the peeled tomatoes and beef stock instead of water and bouillon.   i also added a handful of frozen peas.  delicious everytime.

This was great! The beef was the most tender I've ever had, it melts in your mouth! The only thing I had to do differently was give it an extra 20 minutes or so until the potatoes were actually tender. Some crumbled bacon makes a great addition, too!

Delicious.  I made the following changes to fit our preferences.  I used vegan beef tips. I substituted half the "meat" for mushrooms, added 1T fresh thyme and fresh rosemary, used fresh tomatoes, and orange peppers instead of celery and onions.  Used vegetable broth in place of the beef, and vegan butter of course.

This recipe is so amazing!  One of the first stews that actually thickens up perfectly with no fuss.  The only changes I made were an additional cup of red wine and adding beef broth instead of water.  Really fabulous and hearty!  Dipping artesian bread into this stew is the best thing I've tasted in long time! Thanks for an easy, delicious dish Kathy!

This was delicious, and very easy! I love beef stew, so finding something so simple was pleasing. The best part about it is that it's very adaptable; I was clearing out some leftovers the last time I made it, and just threw things in, including some balsamic vinegar gravy. Wonderful! It's also possible to cut the cooking time with a few shortcuts if you're in a rush, but I recommend taking the full time to cook it whenever possible. Even better reheated the next day.

This stew came out great.  I had to improvise after I started cooking and realized I didn't have any beef bouillon or anything that I could even substitue except a packet of ua jus gravy.  Worked out just fine.

We were snowed in when we made this, so we just pulled together what we had. We added a little extra red wine and a bay leaf in the beginning, didn't have any celery or pearl onions. We ran out of flour after working on the meat, so we thickened the stew with bread crumbs and half and half milk. Also, after adding the vegetables, we only cooked an additional 45 minutes. The vegetables retained a slight outer firmness but were soft inside, the beef was tender and absorbed a wonderful flavor, the stew was rich and delicious. We enjoyed it with sweet Challah bread, and will DEFINITELY make it again!

UPDATE: Made this again and had to make a few small changes. Being pregnant, I decided to avoid using the wine, so I replaced with 1 more cup of water and 1 more beef bouillion. Also doubled the garlic, and unfortunately forgot to pick up pearl onions for this. Had to cook an extra 5 minutes to soften the potatoes a little more. YUM!! This came out absolutely DELICIOUS and will continue to be a repeat, with and without wine.

I tried this and tweaked a couple of things,first off,I didn't use any water at all as it would mean too much liquid which would result into using flour which I wanted to avoid entirely. Secondly,I added just about half a teaspoon of fresh ginger. Lastly,I ommitted the potatoes and substituted them with peas....I still have guests requesting when I can make the stew again.

I liked the flavors. I browned the floured meat right in the stockpot then added the liquids and deglazed the brown bits. That's how you get a thicker sauce. I added a lot more water than the recipe called for and the sauce still came out thick. It was even thicker the next day, and yummy too.

WOW!  Very good!  I used 2 pork chops and 1/2 lb ground beef, omited the 
butter and tomatoes, and was extremely pleased with the results.I also added
 a few more herbs to personalize it.

I made this and it was wonderful.  I have never made beef stew before.  I added a little more wine and bouillon then was called for, it was so good! I will most certainly make again.

Better than five stars. So good. Made exactly as directions said, but added a tiny bit more red wine, because I'm a fan. So, so good.

Really delicious, a keeper! Good recipe for the leftover red wine that had been sitting in our fridge for a few months (I had reserved it for cooking). Next time I would prefer to use an all-natural broth instead of the boullion. I did not have fresh parsley, pearl onions or enough potatoes and it still turned out great! For a change add a touch of cream.

AMAZING! My only go to stew recipe for sure. I've made this many times now and here are my changes. Instead of a can of whole peeled romas, I use a can of diced romas. Instead of water and bouillon I use 2 cans of beef consume with the water. I omit the thyme and pearl onions and through in a bay leaf during simmering. I also usually end up adding more than 1 cup of wine.....it's SOOOOOOO good! Thanks for the recipe. I also do the whole 2 1/2 to 3 hours of simmering, it SO worth it!!!! Enjoy.

I made this stew for our Super Bowl party and it was a huge hit among adults and kids.  I only made a couple minor changes.  Instead of potatoes, I used parsnips.  If you double the recipe as I did, I recommend six.  I also added three tablespoons of ketchup and three tables worcestershire sauce (if you double the recipe).

This is a terrific recipe - only change is that I also added some Rosemary and used Guinness instead of Red Wine - made it very beefy.

Tastes great, the only thing I did differently was to substitute Guinness for red wine. It's more like a Irish stew, yummy. Served with cornmeal bread.

Wonderful! I have always gone the old route and made beef stew with the onion soup mix and flour. This stew was awesome. I did follow the advise of some other members and eliminate the water. I used 1 1/2 cups of beef broth and the 14.5 ounce can of petite cut tomatoes with zesty jalapenos. I promise it was not spicy at all. I also used sherry for the wine and added some Worcestershire sauce. Everyone loved it. I will definitely make again.

I'm a pretty inexperienced cook and I made this a couple days ago for the first time. I am very happy with the results, it tastes really good. I just followed the recipe and it pretty much all worked. I was confused that the recipe asked for an 8oz can of whole tomatoes -- that is pretty small and I couldn't find it at the grocery store. I put in two 14.5oz cans instead, with the juice of one, and it came out good.

Delicious!  I did cook it longer than written and used a 15oz can of tomatoes.  Also left out the pearl onions and added some mushrooms.  I love the flavor the red wine gives this stew.  Thanks so much for a great recipe.

This was good. Very close to how I make it. I omitted the tomatoes and celery. I use regular onion cut up. I add more seasonings for taste. Good hearty meal. Serve with crusty french bread.

Very, very good. My family gobbled it all up in 24 hours!   I didn't have the small onions so I replaced it with a full onion. The wine makes this stew delicious!  Will definitely make again. Thanks for sharing.

I changed water to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 1/2 cups beef broth. I also used sherry to thin. I thickened it with 1/4 cups flour water. I thick it would be great served with sourdough bread.

My wife and I really enjoyed this stew.  It ranks as one of our favorite stews.  I cooked the beef and onion in the same pot as the stew, used a good burgundy wine and added whatever vegetables I had on hand (carrots, celery, mushrooms and zuchinni).  I scaled the recipe to 8 servings to serve 4 and I used a 14.5 oz can of diced tomatos and only 1 cup of water. I had to thicken the stew a little at the end with a flour paste.  Will definately make this again.

Just what I was looking for...a healthy beef stew. Can't give it a 5 cause I changed so much. 

Scaled it to 6 servings. I used one tablespoon olive oil instead of  all that butter/veg oil to sear meat. Used about 1/4 lb more meat then called for, but trimmed the fattiest pieces. Whole wheat flour for the coating and about two tablespoons worth to thicken it. Probably could have gotten away with less. Used about 3/4 less potato then called for. Store was out of pearl onions, used boiling onions, quartered.

That all should have brought the protein/carbs/fat closer to 40/40/20 which is what I try and make most of my meals. Yummy too!

this stew is perfect for me for the very reason some others were disapointed.  It is more like a soup.  Which is what my partner likes with dumplings.  I like a thick gravy with biscuts.  With this I can have it both ways.  Simply remove some of the liquid befoe making the dumplings and thicken it for me and then good to go to make his!!  Delish and stops us from fighting the war over the stew!!

This was more like a soup than a stew; I wanted something with a thicker liquid.  It was ok for a soup.  My husband only had one serving then ate cereal; he wouldn't eat the leftovers--a sure sign that it wasn't very flavorful.

Very good beef stew!  I followed this recipe pretty closely, but I used beef broth for the water/bouillon, and instead of pearl onions, I used regular onion cut into wedges.  The amount of flour that stuck to the meat before sautéing was just enough to give the broth some body.  This stew had a nice depth of flavor, not doubt due to the addition of red wine.  I would make this one again for sure!

Loved it AS IS!  Great flavor and was not too soupy or thick.  The reason it was perfect was because I didn't try to change the recipe.  If I changed the recipe it probably would have effected the taste and thickness of the stew.

Excellent! I used butter to brown the beef and used beef broth instead of bouillon cubes and it turned out awsome! We had sourdough bread and black butte porter with it, the stew really brought out the tastes of the beer.

Turned out great. Next time I won't use the pearl onions, instead I will increase the amount of chopped onion. I will make this one all winter long.

Great recipe!  Of course I tasted it along the way and added more red wine (splashes here and there).  I also increased the seasoning by my taste.  I didn't use pearl onions, because I didn't have any.  Great recipe and easy enough to add extra spices based on your own preferances.

This is the best beef stew I have ever had, I think the red wine was the main touch, but it was thick, and tasty, and I make this now every time I want beef stew, you won't be disappointed!  Thank you Kathy!

This is what Stew is supposed to taste like!  A good old fashion comfort food.  I halved the recipe and it turned out perfect.  The soupy part of the stew is quite thin but there is not very much of it so overall the stew is chunky.  The only thing I did differently was I used yellow onion instead of pearl onions.  Trust me, make it!

Simple and comforting, straight-forward recipe, yet rich and tasty beef stew that has a balanced flavor that can be built upon: worcestershire sauce, smoked paprika, cayenne...*key* must brown the meat well to create bits for flavor foundation and saute all the spices to bloom the flavors before deglazing with onions and other wet ingredients such as red wine and tomatoes.  My son asked for seconds!

I tried this over the New Year and thought it was a bit bland.  However, I have been trying several beef stew recipes in the last few weeks because of the cold weather.  Don't think I will make this again.

Very good and hearty.  Used beef broth instead of water and boullion.  I used one pot and added an extra cup of broth.  The result was a very thick stew.  Delicious!!

The best beef stew I've ever had!  It was absolutely delicious and I will definitely make it time and time again.  I would say the serving size is a bit off though..it looks more like to would serve 8-10 (unless you have people that eat very little)..

This recipe is simple to prepare, tastes great and can be easily adapted. The tomatoes in the recipe can be switched to tomato sauce, tomato juice or even fresh tomatoes. I now always marinate the beef for at least a few hours and add the carrots earlier than the recipe calls for, it reduces the cooking time and makes both more tender.

This turned out well-not soupy-thick. It simmed for 2 hours. I added another bouillon and the flavor was very nice.

This stew was pretty good.  I enjoy a thicker stew but if you want one that is more soup like this is a good one.  I thought the wine added a unique taste.  Good to share with others because it makes a lot!

This stew is excellent, with just the right flavor and thickness.  I cook the meat and onions in one pot, I also add peas at the final stage of cooking.  Delicious!

One of the things I love about all recipes.com is the different ways people make changes to the recipe and whether or not those changes made the recipe better. I read a few of the reviews and the tweaks offered by the other reviewers were spot on. Some of those tweaks include cooking the beef in batches, using beef broth and thicken the stew at the end with a little cornstarch. 
Not sure why but there was not a lot of liquid after cooking the meat for an hour. I added another cup of broth and another cup of wine before adding the vegetables. The flavors were bright, no one flavor overwhelms another and not at all bland. I used extra lean beef and was worried it would be too tough, but   sauteing  the beef before hand sealed in the juices and they were so tender. This was a huge hit for the family and having enough for several days is a great bonus.

Great recipe -a few changes --  Used beef broth instead of bullion and water.  I added my own spin with mushrooms and peas.  Next time I'll up the wine a bit (adds a nice flavor) ... Also, next time I'm make the larger recipe!  I sized this down thinking it would be too much -- It was gone in no time at all and everyone loved it!  thank you

Good soup, bad stew.  This was more of a vegetable beef soup than a stew but still had good flavor.  I was just dissapointed because I was expecting gravy like juice not broth.

Pretty good; very traditional, but not the best I've ever had or anything.  I just felt something was missing.  I did cut the recipe in half and used a crockpot after searing the beef with flour, just FYI.

Easy to prepare.  Tastes good.  Family loved it.  What else do you need from a recipe?

One caution, I made 8 servings according to the recipe, but we only got 5.

I was looking for a hearty stew to serve after a cold day of sailing and this one hit the stop. I cooked it on very low heat for a much longer amount of time (crock-pot style) and added frozen peas in the last half-hour. It makes A LOT of stew so I ended up giving it to neighbors. The wine adds an element of depth.

This was by far the best beef stew I’ve made. The texture and flavor were perfect. The only exception I made in the recipe was to use better than bullion instead of bullion cubes.

I was looking for a good base for a stew and this was it.  I added a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and can of diced potatoes at the "one hour remaining" point rather than fresh, but this turned out great.  It's a keeper.  Very rich base that has a touch of sweetness.  Good stuff.  The only thing I did was before serving, I added some cornstarch so it would thicken up because it was still more like soup.

Both kids (teen boys) thought it was tasty.  Big win in my opinion.  Beef was melt in mouth tender.  Only substitution was beef stock instead of water & boullion and left out the pearl onions which I don't particularly like and would never have on hand.  Next time I will try adding a few peas and mushrooms.  Had 5 people for dinner and had a 1 1/2 quarts left over.  I want to try freezing some and see if the taste and texture is just as good.  Always looking for good freezer meals.

As a simple base recipe it was good but a bit on the plain side. Second time I made it I substituted a dark stout beer for the wine, added extra garlic, and added mushrooms with the rest of the veggies. Simmered it all in the crock pot then thickened with flour/water at the end. It was much more flavorful.

This was really good.  I did have to thicken it a bit after it was cooked, but used a 14 oz can of tomatoes and 2 cans of beef bullion.  I also added quartered crimini mushrooms.  Loved it, but it wasn’t that much better than my pressure cooker beef stew, so don’t know how often I’ll make it.

The flavor was very good in this recipe, although I think another time I would think about adding more seasoning. The volume was way off. I reduced it to 8 servings and increased the meat for that number, but it only made enough for 4 servings - counting a serving as a bowl full.

This a great stew recipe! I use a chuck roast instead of stew meat. It’s more tender. I brown the meat, onions and garlic all in the same pan and deglaze with beef broth instead of bouillon. I also add peas and mushrooms the last half hour of cooking. Nice hearty stew. My family loves it!

One of the best beef stew dinners I ever made. The only thing I changed was I briefly cooked the carrots and potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes before throwing them in the stew so they only needed to cook for about 30 minutes in the stew to absorb the flavors. I also mixed about a tablespoon of cornstarch with a little bit of water and added that to the stew just before serving it to thicken the stew.  Easy recipe with delicious results!

Great recipe, easy to prepare.  I cooked the beef in a pressure cooker for a half hour and this cut back on the cooking time.  You can then just prep the meat and go right to combining all ingredients.

This is a wonderful recipe.  I used the leftover prime rib from Christmas and diced it up.  Like the picture, I added green peas and green beans that were not in the recipe.  They were not in the recipe.  I added some extra red wine also because I like the stew with a little more liquid.  I also separated the fat from the au jus of the prime rib which make a rich and flavorful beef stock in the stew.  Yep, it will use this recipe again!!

I made this exactly as the recipe and it was a hit.  There were requests for the recipe.  It did seem a bit thin until it sat for a little bit and then it  was perfect.  It's a keeper.  but use a BIG pan,  a 5 qt. dutch oven wasn't big enough.

Excellent recipe.  We seasoned the meet with salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and Tony's.  We also substituted chicken stock, as suggested, for water, and added peas, corn, green beans, mushrooms, can of rotel tomatoes.  We also added powered brown gravy mix and starch dissolved in a cup of hot water at the end to thicken.  Luckily, we found discounted t bone and strip steaks instead of stew meat.  Delicious!!

Simple straightforward recipe. Note: I don't 'follow' recipes in as much as use the proportions as guidance.  I made a few changes to this one, including upping the herbs dramatically, especially garlic (we're one of 'those' households). Plus I used a bit of flour at the end to thicken it.

I'm not terribly big on beef stews, but the husband is and with our variations this one has become a staple in our home, usually cooked in a huge vat with plenty frozen for leftovers.

I'm not sure of the protocol on this site (been creeping for years), but happy to share my variations if anyone msgs me (that happens here eh?)

It was delicious!! Did everything exactly as described but did add a can of low sodium peas and at the end a 1/4 cup of flour mix to thicken. The best I've ever made!

My favorite beef stew recipe.   I added some extra spices and left out the pearl onions and cooked in the crock pot.    Will definitely make again soon

Really good stew.  After browning meat with chopped onions I cooked it in my pressure cooker for about 20 minutes.  While the meat was cooking the veges were simmered on stove top.   Always season to your taste and it turns out wonderfully.

Flavor was a good classic stew.  I used this as my base leaving out the things I don't like (pearl onions and celery) and adding peas.  I used beef concentrate instead of bouillon b/c it's what I had, same basic idea though.  Also, cooked it all in one pot for easy cleanup.

This stew was amazing! Nice and hearty...I added peas, and I substituted the red wine for red grape juice. We don't drink alcohol, and I really liked the tangy sweetness it added. I also cooked it all in the same pot from the beginning, and used the grape juice to deglaze the pot.

I have been using the same beef stew recipe for years. Out of boredom I decided to search for a new one to try. This was AMAZING. I made this in the slow cooker on high. I didn't cut up my beef into smaller cubes bc I figured the meat would fall apart anyway, which it did. I added peas at last 10 min of cooking. The red wine and browning the floured meat with the onions is what really makes this recipe kick butt. New favorite beef stew recipe!

A great recipe, although I did make several modifications to better suit my preferences, (added mushroom, used less potato, and added a dash of Worcestershire sauce), I still give this recipe 5 stars as-is, cuz it definitely would have been fine without the modifications that I made, I'm just really picky when I cook for myself simply cuz I can be lol

I must say I like the end result, although it would be nice if it were just a bit thicker. I'm not as good of a cook as I would like to be, so, not sure how to thicken this easily without risking ruining it... The other thing I have trouble with is browning all the meat easily. Its quite the task! But the stew is a tasty meal and my boyfriend truly enjoys it which is important!!

Love this recipe.  I have made it a number of times and have found that upping the wine and the garlic makes it more to my family's taste.  Also, added frozen peas for color and I usually have to thicken it a bit at the end.  Wonderful!

Just tried this recipe and loved it!! I added a few additional onions with the beef when browning, thickly sliced, and left out the pearl onions. I'm thinking of trying a pint of Guinness next time instead of the wine. I didn't have trouble with mine thickening. It turned out just fine. Definitely going to add this to the winter menu!!!

I followed the recipe but just didn't find it exceptional or worth repeating. I  don't believe the canned tomatoes helped; the next beef stew reciped I try will not include tomatoes

A very delicious and simple stew. I use a nice French bordeaux for the wine which adds depth. I also lessen the pearl onions by half and add a cup of frozen young peas near the end.

Excellent flavor! Been making this stew for years and even the kids love it. Freezes well too.
