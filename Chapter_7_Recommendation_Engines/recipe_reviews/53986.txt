I love tuna salad for lunch - this was a bit different with the addition of Worcestershire sauce which I haven't seen in many tuna salad recipes. I used light mayo, light sour cream, dijon for the prepared mustard and added a little garlic powder. Since you're adding lemon zest, you may as well add a couple squirts of fresh lemon juice. I didn't bother putting this into the food processor but rather choppped the eggs very fine and added some chopped celery as well.  Overall, if I made this again I might leave out the Worcestershire.

Excellent.  A good blend of spices and condiments for a different flavor.  Don't change anything on this recipe.  Serve it on melba toast or romaine lettuce with club crackers.

Didn't have any sour cream nor lemons so I doubled the mayo and used 1/2 ts of lemon juice. I also grated the eggs and mixed everthing in a bowl rather than mess up my food prosseser. Really GOOD! I love the use of herbs. Makes good chedder Tuna Melts. The Fish flavor is still there but I can blame that on the canned tuna I used. Might be good with some capers??

I don't eat tuna fish and that makes it very difficult for me to prepare it for my husband's lunch.  He is also a picky eater and doesn't like onions, pickles or eggs.  So I am always looking for ways to make it flavorful without those ingredients.  He loved this recipe, although I did leave out the eggs.  I will continue to use it since this seems to be his favorite of the ones I have tried.

This is quite tasty-the worcestershire sauce is a nice touch. I did not puree the eggs. I like my tuna salad nice and chunky. I also used fresh rosemary because I had it on hand and plain yogurt because I didn't have sour cream. Not spectacular, but tasty enough to make again.

Rather than making my traditional tuna salad, I tried this recipe because it had received so many high ratings.  I was however unimpressed with the taste and the texture of this tuna salad.  Placing the eggs in a food processor with the mayo and other ingredients (minus the tuna of course) resulted in a tuna spread rather than a chuncky tuna salad.  In addition, I thought the overall result was rather tasteless.  I personally didn't care for this recipe and won't be using it again :-(

I didn't find anything special about this recipe.  Maybe my spices are just old, but I didn't think they did much for the tuna salad.

This was pretty good! I'd made it a long time ago, and forgotten how it was, so decided to make it again. Didn't have any sour cream so substituted Greek yogurt. Also, I decided to add diced green onions (four for this recipe size) because I love green onions, and I felt the lemon would be too sweet (Meyers lemons). 

I suggest combining the ingredients as you put the eggs to boil. This gives the flavors a chance to meld. Then, once the eggs are done let them cool for an hour before blending it all into a "sauce." Combine remaining ingredients and then let it sit in the refrigerator over night to set up a bit. 

Served with home made dill crackers for an awesome lunch!!

With few adjestments I added italian seasoning with the little rosemary and dill, added onions, mustard, salt, pepper and  took out the sourcream, lemon zest and worcestershire sauce and made it like a regular tuna salad nice and chunky... next time I think im going to add a little lemon zest to give it a little zing... other then great recipe.

I used 2 eggs but halved the rest of the ingredients (because I only had 1 can of tuna). I didn't have lemon zest so I substituted a squirt of lemon juice. I did put everything in a food processor before mixing with the tuna. Glad I did because I didn't need to use half of the sauce (so I saved it in the refrigerator for later, when I can get more tuna). I also mixed in a chopped green onion. Since I'm trying to live without bread, I ate it on celery sticks and also made a lettuce leaf burrito. Both were delicious! Thank you for posting this wonderful recipe. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good and quite healthy and low in carbs/sugar. I cut this down to three servings, added a couple chopped garlic dill pickles and that was just enough for my boys and I. I left theirs on whole wheat bread but I had mine mixed up with a little shredded cabbage and it really was super filling. Next time, I think I could get away with a little less mayo and sour cream, but as is, we all enjoyed it. Thanks! NOTE: I also did not puree any ingredients. We like ours a little chunkier so that worked well for us.

This is a nice change from the same old tuna.  I omitted the egg, but followed everything else exactly.  I tasted as soon as I made it and thought it was ok, but after it was refrigerated for a few hours and the flavors had an opportunity to meld it was wonderful.  Thanks for sharing!

Very good! I loved the flavor combinations in this. The lemon was very subtle, but refreshing. I've never been one to enjoy egg in my tuna salad, so I omitted that. Thanks! :)

I would have given this a 3, since the lemon was overpowering, but that was partly my fault, since one can of tuna fish that I used was flavored with lemon already.  I didn't use a food processor, since I wanted the tuna and egg chunky, but the only problem with that was the rosemary pieces (next time I will leave it out, or grind it first). I also won't add any lemon next time, due to my unpleasant first experience.

This was a very good recipe. I also chopped the eggs and I added more mayo. Overall though, it was delicious! Such a pleasant change from the average tuna salad. We ate these as sandwiches on pita bread. Next time I'll add some celery and green onions for my husband though. Thanks Shelley!

Did not puree eggs and dressing.  Taste was okay, nothing exciting.  Herb flavor is a little strong and I even went light on the herbs.

Very good, its different and it was fun to make. I like recipies that take some time and effort to do and this was one of em. The taste is very good, its not your typical tuna salad, you may like it or you may not, depends on how much you like tuna and your openness to different tastes.

I've got to give this one five stars too!! Granted, I subbed yoghurt for sour cream, and soy sauce (with a couple dashes of tabasco), but I think it tasted pretty much as intended.

Personally, I made it the night before, and we put it on toasted whole wheat bread. AWESOME!!!

This is a great new way to do Tuna salad.  I have never used sour cream before, and it really made the salad good.  I added extra sour cream and mayo, as my family likes it creamy - I am added the chopped eggs rather than put them in the blender.  Awesome!

This was good. I especially liked the lemon zest flavor.  I would not recommend this recipe for tuna sandwiches but better served with asssorted greens and /or sliced tomato. In addition to the two blended eggs, I added one diced egg to tuna salad.

This was just not good to me.  I was looking for a variation for tuna salad sandwiches and even topped this off with a slice of swiss cheese, but I still couldn't finish it.  The only thing I didn't have was lemon zest, so I added a pinch of lemon pepper instead. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. The flavor just wasn't for me, sorry.
