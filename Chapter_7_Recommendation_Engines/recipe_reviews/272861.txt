Delicious. I increased the spices a bit and instead of fresh chopped tomatoes I used a 14oz can of diced tomatoes in the tomato juice. I also used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead as well, and topped with a little bit of cheese. Turned out delicious and moist, not dry. Squeezing lemon juice on top made a big difference and was the perfect ending touch
