Delicious! Pefect if you have a craving for something sweet, but are short on time! I cut the recipe in half and subbed a little cinnamon and nutmeg for the cloves.  I toasted the coconut vs. baking it and spinkled it over top when the bananas were done baking.  I served this with vanilla ice cream - YUM!

Wow! This recipe was great. My husband raved about it and stated he will never again throw away spotty bananas if this is what can be done with them. The only change i made to the recipe was to simply sprinkle all ingredients on top of the bananas then dot with butter, rather than creaming them together with the butter. I think next time i make this recipe i will slice the bananas into coins instead of slicing lengthwise to make it easier to serve over top of vanilla ice cream.

These bananas were fabulous!  I had some turning bananas, but my roommates and I are sick of banana bread so I went in search of something different.  I only had 3 bananas to use, so I modified the recipe a bit. I did not cream the butter and sugar.  Instead, I just drizzled orange juice on the bananas, sprinkled with brown sugar, dotted the top with butter, and sprinkled on a handful of coconut. This was not too sweet... perfect for using up extra bananas. I think using less butter and sugar is better, as it just gives the banana flavor a little boost.

I made this for a big "Cuban food" party I hosted.  It went well with the pork roast, rice and beans we served.  I didn't add the coconut but it was still good.  Very easy to prepare ahead and just throw in the oven 10 minutes before chow time.

I was looking for a really quick and easy desert using bananas and this is definitely that.  It's really tasty, a great light dessert.  I love the fact that you get the taste of rum without the alcohol.

This was a nice treat, but it lacked the "lightness" I was looking for.  The bananas are packed with sugar...so much that I could hardly eat more than a couple of bites.  But those few bites were delicious...especially with vanilla ice cream.

Nice impromptu dessert when we found ourselves with a sweet tooth that needed to be quickly satisfied.  I don't care for cloves so I omitted them, but added a dribble of vanilla. I left out the coconut as well, simply to suit our tastes.  This was a little on the sweet side, so it definitely needs to be offset with some whipped cream or ice cream (and a drizzle of chocolate syrup).  Not bad for a spur of the moment dessert.

Nice recipe. The only change I made was to bake bananas for 15 minutes. Very good to serve them with ice cream.

My family LOVED this!  I had some bananas that didn't really seem pretty enough to eat plain, so I searched for a way to cook them instead (as to not waste them).  I decided to try this recipe because it was so very simple.  I did as most others did, and sprinkled the banans with the ingredients and dotted with butter instead of creaming it together.  Also, I used freshed squeezed clementine oranged instead of OJ (I used more because fresh squeezed is milder than OJ).  I also drizzled the bananas with dark rum (a VERY little).  It came out fabulous and would have been even tastier with vanilla icecream or frozen yogurt.  Super easy!  Will do again for sure.

Okay, I have to admit I made this similar to a "bananas foster." I subtituted the cloves with cinnamon, added a dash of vanilla, and left out the coconut. The sauce part is wonderful over ice cream! Next time I will make in a saute pan, like original recipes for cooked bananas, to speed up the process. But, I enjoyed tonight with my ice cream, thanks.

This had a nice flavor and went well with vanilla ice cream. It is very sweet. I expected the coconut to toast somewhat while baking, but that didn't happen. If I make this again I will toast the coconut first.

I used orange juice concentrate instead and more importantly (and deliciously) after baking, put it under the broiler for a few minutes to toast the coconut and carmelize the brown sugar and orange concentrate.  Much better!

Very easy.  Very good.  Very very sweet.  Best attempted with bananas just coming ripe.  3 to 5 minutes more oven time was required and I had to use a larger baking dish.  Dynamite with creamy vanilla ice cream.  I will definitely use this one again.

I used older bananas in this and it was watery after 10 minutes. I had to increase the temp to 450 to get it to carmelize and brown on top and had to cook it for 5-10 more minutes. The flavor was great, I did substitute honey for the sugar and put a dash of nutmeg on top. Can't wait to try it on ice cream!

I made these for me and my wife and they turned out better than I could have expected.  I also served the bananas over french vanilla frozen yogurt with cinnamon sprinkled on top and it really made it a great well rounded dessert.  Highly recommended!!

very yummy and sweet, a different twist on the quick dessert, only thing....it needs to be eaten pretty quickly because the bananas will turn brown if refridgerated.

This was a good and different way to use up bananas, but I think the baking time should be increased. I baked my dish for 12 minutes but it could have gone longer. The bananas were not baked through.

Yummy! I didn't have any cloves, but I did have some brown sugar, a bit of Vanilla extract and a spalsh of orange juice. I added these 3 ingredients to a pan of a bit of melted butter and it was sooo good! I didn't have any banana's but I did have some very ripe plantains and it was just as delicious!

We had so many bananas from our tree i was looking for another  easy recipe to use the bananas.   This was great.  I didn’t have orange juice so used maple syrup.    Sprinkled with cinnamon and nutmeg.  I did t have coconut on hand this time but can’t wait to make again when I do.

Mouth-watering!  Nice to have such an easy recipe to whip up to satisfy a sweeet tooth.  I didn't have brown sugar, so used honey instead, and would highly recommend that.  I also added an equal amount of cinnamon to cloves.  Will definitely make again!

I made a few changes to the recipe to substitute for my allergies and they worked great.  I simply used 1/4 C virgin unrefined coconut oil instead of butter and 1/2 tsp of asorbic acid (Vitamin C powder) dissolved in water (mixed to desired sourness)of which I only added 1 3/4 Tbs substituting for the orange juice.

The coconut flavor made this dessert even more tropical.

This was awesome.  I made it with lamb and spinach orzo.  Went great with it.  My Kids liked it a lot.  Everyone liked it.

I made these for company because they had a pretty good rating.  My company did not like them, nor did my husband or I.  They were waaay too mushy.  I followed the recipe to a T.  My husband was a little more lenient with his opinion but still would not eat them.

This was much better than I had expected--the thought of warm bananas was a turn off.  I had some bananas I wanted to use up and was tired of my usual methods.  This turned out wonderful.  I, like others, simply sprinkled the sugar and butter on top (I decreased the amount of sugar).  Instead of orange juice I added a peeled and sliced fresh orange (I think pineaple would be a good addition as well).  Very good over vanilla ice cream.

I made this for my mother, father and husband and they all loved it!  We put whipped topping ontop.  If you like cloves you'll love this!  My mom is not a fan of bananas but she was raving!
