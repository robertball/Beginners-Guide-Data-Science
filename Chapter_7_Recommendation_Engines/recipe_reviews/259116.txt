I made this for a party I was attending. I and others did not find that you could taste the maple syrup in the crust or the cheesecake itself. I also followed the directions completely and I found the cake did not bake properly. I have made several cheesecakes and have never had that happen.  I probably will not make this again.

Only had 3 packs of cream cheese so had to scale down the 'filling' ingredients by 1/4. Did not add the maple syrup to the crust as we used local extra dark maple syrup and thought it would be too sweet. Sadly I was mistaken as no one tasted even a hint of the maple syrup and it just tasted like a normal plain cheesecake I usually make. It was good but definitely need something to boost the maple flavor.....
