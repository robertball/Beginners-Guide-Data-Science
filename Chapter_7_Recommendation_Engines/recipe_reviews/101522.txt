These were delicious!  Like several of the other chefs I added egg to my mix.  My partner and I really enjoy making Veggie Patties and have tried several of our own creations,and this recipe served as a great base to start with.  Admittedly I am a professional chef so most recipes I only use as a guide.

A few pointers for those having problems with binding.  Once my beans are cooked I slightly cool and use my kitchen aid to make a a chunky bean paste.  I would also add the rice to this mix (although I substituted quinoa instead).  Also if you are unsure if the mix will hold try a mini test pattie.  This will also allow you to adjust seasoning as beans take a lot of salt, and flavors come out with heat.

Additional suggestions are try adding some grated carrot, fresh parsley, and also can go half and half with black beans and another of your favorites.  As well, I like to make a large batch of the mix and make my burger for dinner and shape the rest onto a parchment lined cookie sheet and freeze patties.  Once frozen I portion them into packs.  Make sure to keep a layer between them or it wont be fun pulling them apart!

Jerk Mayo and cheese also top these off nice.

Never having eaten, let alone made a veggie burger - I have to say that these were pretty good! I halved the recipe and still made 4 good sized burgers.  Made exactly as written.  For those reviewers who said that these didn't form into patties and crumbled when cooking, you didn't follow the directions! Mixing thoroughly with your hands is a MUST.  I started out mixing with a spoon and the mixture was dry and loose, then I dove in with my hands and really mixed and mashed it up and that made all the difference! Had NO problems forming patties and very minimal crumbling,  only around the edges when cooking.  There is no need for an egg in this recipe if you follow the directions.

I both make and buy a lot of vegetarian burgers, and this recipe is the best by far!  I've made these twice now for my family - once on buns with melted cheese, lettuce, sauteed onion and tomato, and once as just patties with our favorite Jerk sauce, sweet peppers, and onions to complete a Caribbean themed meal - both were complete hits!  Having small children I substituted the habanero with a jalapeno, and also used a dash of cinnamon instead of the allspice, as I didn't have any on hand.  I made the recipe for 8, using two cans of drained and rinsed black beans.  The fresh ginger is a must!

I am sitting here eating THE VERY best veggie burger ever!  Thank you for the recipe!

I used brown basmati, and homemade whole  wheat breadcrumbs.  I also added two eggs, and coated with cornmeal for a very nice crunch.

Edit: I am editing my review and giving it 5 stars because I did not read the instructions properly the first time I made these. You do not need egg - mashing the mixture holds it together great. Such a wonderful recipe, thank you!  Great recipe! I would've given it 5 stars, but it was really lacking a main ingredient as others have stated: egg. We used 2 and the burgers held together great, even on our grill. Otherwise  it would've fallen completely apart. Topped with lettuce, tomato and slices of avocado, awesome!

Not sure what the last person did wrong but these burgers formed excellent patties - so good that we were even able to BBQ them which was a welcome change from frying.  The only thing I changed in the recipe was that I used 2 cans of black beans and used Basmati brown rice.  The taste was awesome - not too hot but enough to know you were eating something with heat.  I will definitely be making these again.  The recipe also make a lot more than six patties which is OK because I'm looking forward to the leftovers.

Awesome tasting veggie burgers, better than any we've tasted before! I needed to add agg to bind this together although the recipe doesn't call for it. Three vegetarian friends have placed this recipe on their FAVORITES list.

I believe this recipe could make T-Rex less of a carnivore. I made this exactly as stated and cannot think of any alterations to make. I used a 3"x1/2" round cutter to form "burgers" and served it as a sandwich burger with the typical condiments. Using the cutter, I had ten servings and put the leftovers in the freezer for another time.

This was soooo good! The only thing I would add is an egg to help hold it together which I'll try next time I make it. I served it with some sliced mango which really made it tasty. Also, I used a jalepeno instead of habanero. Definitely worth making again.

These had an unusual taste for a veggie burger but we enjoyed them.  I give it a 4 because I had trouble with the patties staying together.  I did substitute ground oats for the bread crumbs which maybe could have caused the problem.  If you are looking for something different yet east, this recipe is great.  If you are looking for something resembling more of a "traditional veggie burger" this may not be the recipe for you.

I love these Burgers, Hannah! However, I can't give this recipe five stars until I figure out why mine fell apart in the pan! (???) I don't what went wrong but I tried so hard and yet my burgers were crumbling and broke up as I would flip them. Can anybody help me? I want to make these for my vegetarian Nieces tomorrow but I fear it will turn out the same way as the last three times I made them.

My first attempt at making a veggie burger and they turned out GREAT!  I used brown rice instead of white and put them on the grill.  The consistancy was so similar to a beef burger and with the brown rice, it even looked like a beef burger.  Next time I might leave out the ginger and add more garlic.  Definitely need to use your hands to get them to stick together and I had absolutely no trouble with them falling apart on the grill.  This recipe made 8 very large burgers.

These were tasteless. I don't know, I didn't know quite what to expect and I gave these every advantage, making home made buns, the works. I used Basmati rice which has a flavor we adore. For the record, use an egg, squishing it all together is something you'll still have to do to form a patty, perhaps a 2nd egg might help but to what end? I might try something like this again but it would have to be radically different.

My husband is a die hard carnivore and he absolutely loved these! Since my daughter has Celiac's disease, I toasted 6 slices of Udi Gluten-free bread and tore them into small pieces for the bread crumbs and then ate them bunless.  I smooshed the mixture together by hand until it was the texture of raw hamburger and they held together well. We all thought these were the best veggie burgers we'd ever eaten!

One of our favs.  Instead of forming burgers, I put 1/2 of the mix into a pie plate lined with a Pillsbury pie crust and bake 350 for about 30-40 minutes until brown. I freeze the rest of the mix for use at a later date.  The taste brings me back to a small restaurant that I visited in Jamaica.  Yummy!

Uber delicio-so! Used a jalapeno instead of the habanero, brown rice instead of white, and quick oats instead of breadcrumbs. I mixed them with my hands, and had no problem with them holding together. I baked them at 375 for about 15 minutes. Topped them with avocado and lettuce, and served them with homemade crispy sweet potato chunks for an awesome vegan meal. Thanks for this recipe!

This was my first vegetarian burger and I wasn't disappointed! Followed directions exactly and they were not too dry. If mixed with hands an egg is not needed.

Fantastic burgers!  These have a great flavor and, if you add the breadcrumbs a little at a time until you are able to form the patties, they come together beautifully.  I didn't fry the patties, I baked them and even then they stayed together and weren't dry at all.  This recipe is a real winner.  Thanks, Hannah!

These burgers were FANTASTIC in flavor and texture! I made as stated with a few alterations. I used coconut oil, brown rice and jalapeno. I didn't have trouble making patties, I just really mashed everything together with my hands. I made six HUGE burger patties. My husband like his, but wasn't crazy over over it like I was. We ate like a hamburger steak with a slice of cheese on top, sauteed spinach and tomatoes as sides. I will make this again and again.

Well, understand I'm not a vegetarian, but I do enjoy vegetarian meals.  This is not one I enjoyed.  Flavour was good.  Texture was just too pasty for my liking.
edited: I liked this recipe better the second day, patty's firmed up,  so added another star to my rating.

awesome! This is the first recipe off of All recipes that my husband truly liked and got excited about eating again. We love all the different flavors in this burger. Definitely recommend. We used 1 teaspoon of the garlic in a jar and that was good for us.

I thought these were really yummy, but my hubby was less impressed (he's more of a meat burger kind of guy). I omitted the pepper, as we weren't in the mood for spicy; next time I might increase the amount of fresh ginger as I could barely taste it. I had no problem with the burgers binding together, and we did them on the BBQ... I just made sure to mix/knead them really well with my hands before forming the patties. No egg required.

My husband and I had our vegetarian friends over as guests for a summer picnic.  I had never cooked for strict vegetarians before.  This recipe sounded enticing.  The result was exceptional!  Even the meat eaters were requesting these burgers instead of the ones made of ground beef!  I will certainly make these again!

I really didn't enjoy these burgers. They had an unpleasant taste, and I had to drown them in ketchup and cover them in cheese in order to choke them down. The only change I made to the recipe was adding an egg to the mixture to keep it from falling apart.

These were really tasty.  Some things to note though...these do not take only 17 minutes to make.  We made these the other night and it took well over an hour.  Additionally, the recipe makes a lot more than it states.  We made it for 4, and we have enough for 6-8 burgers.  We also had to use two eggs to keep things together.  I found it important to REALLY smash the ingredients together with your hands to make everything stick.  It was a tasty recipe, but due to how long it actually takes to make, I dont think we'll be making these again.

These turned out PERFECT!!!! I added about 1/2 cup of sauteed portabello mushrooms and smashed the black beans with a potato masher.  They were a big hit, especially with my finicky veggie burger connoisseur hubby.  I'll definitely add these to my recipe book.

I can't believe how good this is.  Not looking for something that would "spice me out"...this was "spicey" enough with room to heat it up to taste.  For the first time making it, I followed the recipe except using Quinoa as a reviewer suggested.  It's a complete protein and significantly boosts the nutritional value without compromising texture. Also, I didn't add salt. I hadn't used Jalapeno peppers before and almost think it could have used another small one. I'm not ready for a habanero pepper yet. After mushing it together, I didn't need an egg.  A vegetarian keeper for sure.

Nope, not going to be made again.  No flavour, HEAVY and just uninteresting as a meal. Way too much carb for a person to cunsume in one sitting. Held together fine once I added an egg- it is really needed due to all thy dry ingredients.  Recipe says prep is 2 minutes... sure if you have chopped onions and precooked rice in the fridge but that should be included in the prep time. Oh and what makes these Jamaican?

This was my first time making a veggie burger ,and these were quite delicious. It's definitely nothing like a traditional veggie burger. I used a food processor to break down the beans, then mixed them with the other ingredients. I used brown rice instead of white. I didn't have to use an egg, and had no trouble with them falling apart.

These are great! We used Jalapeno instead of Habanero pepper (because that's what we had). Also subbed in brown rice. Had no trouble forming patties or with crumbling. I'm a stubborn omnivore with an aspiring herbivore for a wife. I think I liked these even more than she did!

Top'em off with a slice of pepperjack, red onion, and some homemade guacamole!

The only thing I will change is to cut the recipe in half. This made a ton of burgers.

these were tasty.  to weigh in on the egg/ no egg debate, i made a patty without an egg and it stayed together ok, but, since i'm not a vegan, i thought i would add two eggs to make it stick together better.  the patty with the eggs stayed together 1000 times better.

I was hoping that this would be good.  I was excited to make this.  Didn't taste good.  After thinking about it, I agree with another post about the load of carbohydrates.  How good can rice, breadcrumbs and a little bit of other stuff on a bread bun be?  I am glad others enjoyed.  Won't make again.

Delicious!  I've had better luck with leaving some liquid in the beans and pureeing them, which helps the burgers stick together.  I've also used oats instead of bread crumbs, however when using oats I use only 1 1/2 cups and it's necessary to leave a bit more liquid in and allow the oats to stand in the liquid for about 20 minutes otherwise it's sort of like eating newspaper.  :)  This recipe is very flexible and from the basic ingredients, your favorite seasonings and substitutions can be easily adapted to suit your fancy.

Made it tonight and it was a super hit. I made a few subtle changes.

1. Replaced habanero with Chili flakes and green Chili as we did not have habanero at home.
2. We love ginger so apart from the grated ginger, I added some julienned ginger as well.
3. Didn't have allspice or nutmeg; used only garam masala.
4. Cooked the spices with onions and garlic.
5. Added half lemon juice.

This was a great hit and thanks for sharing the recipe.

Mix with your hands an an egg isn't needed.  Very tasty but habaneros aren't readily available here so I used a jalapeno instead.  It was still quit good.

AWESOME. I added an extra dusting of all the spices and it was a huge hit...also, it made super fatty burgers. Will definitely be making this again. Have already passed on the recipe!

These were tasty.  However the recipe took much longer than stated and made much more..and they were very crumbly.  Added an egg and it held better.

These burgers are very tasty, but I found the mixture to be too dry and couldn't get them to hold together so I added an egg and used less rice.  Also when you press the black bean a little it makes the mixture stickier.

Didn't really have much of an issue with "crumbling."  Although it does happen just a tiny bit around the edges of the patties during flipping, I found it far less troublesome than most other veggie burgers I've made.  No need to add any "adhesive" into this recipe -- just really dig down deep with your hands & SQUISH when forming your patties.  We loved the nutmeg flavor (I subbed cinnamon for the allspice and wheat germ for half the bread crumbs.)  Next time I will decrease the amount of onion - 1 large is plenty.  Served on Belles Hamburger Buns from AR, with muenster cheese & tomato.  Awesome!

Absolutely amazing! We had friends over for dinner and they were floored by how good these were. I used besmati brown rice and fresh beans. Definitely increased prep time but made it soooooo worth it! No need for eggs - use your hands people! I will be making this recipe again and again!

This recipe is incredible!  We added fresh tomato slices and a little bit of mayonnaise to the sandwiches.  It definitely made more than the recipe stated, we made 8 good sized patties.  The leftovers were incredible, will be making this again!

Makes a lot. I cut this recipe in half and made 5 small or 4 large burgers. These tasted great but wanted to let viewers know that the texture is like a soft burger. You won't get the same feel as a boca burger. I'm vegan and served this with a thick slice of tomato, lettuce, vegenaise which is a cholesterol free mayo topping you can get at Whole Foods or Trader Joes or even Publix. Try to get a thick big whole wheat bun to serve with these.

I've made this recipe twice and both times I've been disappointed.  The mixture does not stay together, even with an egg added, so the second time I formed it into a loaf and baked it.  If I were to make it again, I'd increase the proportion of black beans to rice and tone down the nutmeg and allspice.

I used pinto beans instead of black beans, bell pepper instead of the hot variety, and brown rice instead of white rice.  I loved the spiciness, and when not sharing with family members, I'll be sure to include the hot pepper! This is a wonderful vegetarian burger!

This recipe was fairly bland and came out more like turkey stuffing than a burger. The dry spices got mostly drowned out by all the carbs. Also, I had expected these burgers to look dark like a hamburger based on the photos and the fact that it has black beans in it, but they came out very light... which makes sense in hindsight given that there are a lot of onions, bread crumbs and white rice in the recipe. It did hold together pretty well, so no major complaints there.

Great taste and loved the habanero kick. I did feel that it needed a hearty vegetable or something cut the starchy feel, but overall it was still a tasty burger. I will keep the recipe and add my twists.

I messed these up.  I tried to use oatmeal as a binder because I was out of breadcrumbs.  I used brown basmati rice (maybe not sticky enough). I added 2 eggs because they were dry.  They weren't very beany and ended up being more of a black bean fried rice which tasted OK but didn't fit the bill.

First off, for those making these burgers, note that these are HUGE burgers. You make these, and your family or friends will feast like royalty.

This is a great recipe to make, but it's not too easy. Still, the end result is delicious, and that habañero kick is great. I made sure to toss the seeds in for that heat. The ginger measurement in this recipe is a bit much, so I might tone it down next time I make it. However, this is a great recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and couldn't get the burgers to form, i had to add 2 eggs. They were good. I would make them again. My husband liked them better leftover. We had them on whole wheat buns, I added either horseradish mayo or wasabi mayo for an extra kick.

All seven family members ate them and asked for more...that is a 5-star recipe in my book.  I did omit peppers (I know misses the point of the recipe, but the kids won't eat spicy food), added extra of the seasonings to taste.  Working into patties just fine (the little ones loved helping with that, since it was a bit messy).  Fried up great, no egg needed.  Definitely a keeper.  Thank you!

I'm giving these five stars because I'm confident that they would be delicious and perfect if I hadn't messed them up. :o) I used sticky short-grain rice because it's all I had and I think that made them more dense and gooey than they're meant to be, so they didn't cook through all the way.  Med-High was also too high for my stove, so people might consider that if yours seem to be burning before they're cooked through.    I didn't have allspice or nutmeg, but I put cinnamon, cloves and a bit of black pepper in their place and they turned out great flavor-wise.

This recipe is very good. The allspice gives it a "jerk" flavor known well in Jamaica.

Maybe this recipe would be good if it actually formed patties, but when I followed the instructions, I ended up with a crumbly mixture of breadcrumbs, rice, and beans that could in no way be formed into patties.  I added water and oil and attempted to fry it that way, but it fell apart in the pan.  The crumbles that I tasted had great seasoning, but the recipe needs some serious alteration to work.

I gave the recipe three stars because it was just "OK."  I did not dislike the burgers, but found them bland -- I followed the recipe, but substituted jalapeno pepper -- I doubt that habanero  pepper would have mattered.  The burgers are certainly good for you!  I probably won't make them again.

This was a delicious vegetarian option and very filling as well. These flavors worked wonderfully here. One thing I did differently was to lessen the burger patty portion (made 8.) Regular rice works here as well. Aside from its dryness, I was able to keep my patties formed together without the egg as other reviewers mentioned. Work through it very well with the hands to combine. But do whatever you find easier :)
Enjoy your burger with your favorite toppings and a sauce to counter the dryness. Lettuce, tomato, Swiss cheese, and burger sauce (mayo, ketchup, Worcestershire mix) paired wonderfully. Good veggie patty recipe.

Thanks, Hannah for this awesome recipe! It was a hit at my family's Jamaican theme Christmas party. I made them into sliders with Hawaiian rolls and they worked nicely. Prep time took me quite awhile, but I don't cook much so it probably took a lot longer than it should. But loved the flavor and spice!

Blah, not much flavor & doesn't stick together. To salvage I just fried it up & we ate it. Poor hubby ate most just to get rid of it.

I subbed jalapenos for the habanero pepper. Made these for a meal swap so had to be kid-friendly.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  They were a huge hit!  I'd love to try them with the habanero.  The flavor with the jalapenos was great, but could have used more heat.

Totally delicious, but I was a bit confused. Granted I am a total beginner - but, I took the suggestion of some reviewers and added egg in - except I ended up added three eggs and using a potato masher to help me truly mix things together until I could do it better by hand. The mashing and the eggs helped me a lot with keeping it in one piece. And I definitely got a lot more than 6 "servings," ... i.e. - use a BIG bowl. For any of you that have the NuWave like me, I enjoyed them a little crispy - so I put them in on about 8 heat for about 6 minutes on each side. 

Thanks for the recipe!!
