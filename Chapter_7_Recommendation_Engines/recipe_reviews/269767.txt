Made the recipe just as written. Awesome and so easy. That says a lot from someone who is challenged in the kitchen. Will make again!

I did make changes - as I had veg broth that needed to be used and omitted cream (hurts my stomach),  Excellent -but it over steamed (in microwave) cauliflower. Huge hit with hubby and I.

This was very good!  Like other reviewers, I doubled the amount of liquids so I had enough sauce for pasta (used Orzo for the pasta, which worked well).  Instead of heavy cream I used half-and-half, which I had on hand (and cut the fat down substantially).  I also substituted 1/2 package of frozen chopped spinach, squeezed dry, which worked well.  This recipe is a keeper!

Very good recipe. I had never used dried tomatoes before, so I didn’t add the whole amount because I was scared I wouldn’t like it. I wish I would’ve added it all. They make the recipe much better!

It was so good. I cut up the chicken breast into strips because we aren't really big eaters and still had plenty left.

This is an absolutely wonderful, great for "your soul" recipe.  I added fresh, cooked asparagus to the mixture and served with boiled cabbage, as a side dish.

We liked this.  I used 3 cups or a 6 oz bag of spinach. Used extra garlic. Added 8 oz of cooked rotini to the pan.

I used half and half because I had some on hand. Great recipe! The flavor was awesome. My sauce  was a little runny because of the half and half. Next time I'll use some corn starch to thicken it up.  We love mushrooms, so I thru some in also. Perfect!!

Fantastic! I served it over whole wheat orzo. Will be making this again. No changes, I think if you change it you should not review it....that makes it a different recipe

The flavor was good but my sauce was too runny. After reading the reviews I decided to use half and half cream instead of heavy cream and doubled the sauce. Next time I'll try the original recipe as written.

Tweaked it a bit:  Only had coconut milk since heavy cream is not for me but just added some arrowroot powder to thicken sauce.  Used kale and fresh tomatoes since I did not have spinach or sundried tomatoes on hand this time.  Served it with Balsamic rice and fresh green beans.  Hubby loved loved loved it!!

I love the simplicity of this recipe for such a complex-tasting dish.  Next time, I will double up on the spices and add mushrooms (just my tastes), but it was excellent as written.

I have made this numerous times and my husband just requested it again for tonight.  It really is a wonderful meal and easy to make.  The hardest part for me was to find the sun dried tomatoes (in Montana).  I used real grated Parmesan cheese and the flavor is richer than using the jarred powdered stuff.  Try this - you will not regret it and your family will love you for it! (I even sent this to my sister in law and her family raved over it too!)

I didn't put the spinach in because I had already cooked my spinach before I found this recipe.

Totally as advertised, quick and easy to prepare. As we are watching our calorie intake, I used 2% plain yogurt in place of the heavy cream (this did require thickening at the end)
This was delicious, fantastic, served on a bed of rice. The portions called for result in a big feed for two. Be sure to slice the chicken breasts, speeds up cooking and allowed us to have multiple pieces of different portions and left overs

I forgot to buy sun dried tomatoes, so i just diced a fresh one up, and it was still delicious. Put it over some cauliflower rice and I liked it, but wife didn't, so she did regular rice. Either way. We really enjoyed it. Definitely recommend!!!

This recipe is just delicious!  I added mushrooms, and doubled the sauce, using fat free half and half for the doubled portion.  Fabulous!!!

I pretty much made this recipe as stated, however I had Romano grated cheese instead of Parmis on and used that. Would definitely make this again and again

Awesome.  We made it with penne and cut the chicken in chunks instead of filets.

This was fantastic and easy to make. I increased the amount of sauce and added more spinach and it was delicious reheated for leftovers. A family favorite!

When I opened my sun dried tomatoes, they were no good so I used portabella mushrooms instead. After cooking the chicken I quickly added freshly grated garlic and the mushrooms. Then I completed the recipe as directed. It was delish. Next time I may deglaze  the pan with a little white wine before adding the broth and the rest of the ingredients.

The flavor was good and the chicken was juicy. I would double the sauce recipe because it was not enough for the pasta.
