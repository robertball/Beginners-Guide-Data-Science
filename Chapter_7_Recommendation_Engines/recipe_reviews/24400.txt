This is the best soup I've made to date!  I will make it every time I have leftover turkey.  Here is my two cents.  I wanted to include a few more veggies for color and taste.  Along with the green onion I chopped some leek, carrot, and shallot.  Instead of adding to the broth, I cooked in 1 Tbsp. butter and 1 Tbsp. olive oil adding some garlic at this point.  After veggies were softened I added a large can of chicken broth which ends up being more than the recipe calls for but it works. For the rice I used 1 package of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice.  I cut the amount of butter and flour to 1/4 cup of each and then added 1/2 c. half and half, 1/2 c. lowfat milk, the poultry seasoning, and the seasoning packet from the Uncle Ben's Rice.  I omitted the salt and pepper.  There is plenty of salt in the broth and the seasoning mix.  Also, I did not use bacon but put some bacon bits on the side so the kids could sprinkle them on.  Making these changes cuts quite a bit of the fat.  Adding the seasoning packet gives it a great flavor.  Trust me it was fantastic.

I was looking for a recipe to use up some leftover turkey and gave this a try.  I modified it a little by putting in the crockpot for the afternoon.  This recipe was really easy and tasted wonderful.

This is the best turkey rice soup I have ever experienced.  I have made it four or five times since I found the recipe back at Thanksgiving time and it has turned out exactly the same each time.  I have shared this soup with friends and they love it.  I can't say enough to explain the wonderful taste of this soup.  I have even subsituted chicken and it still tastes great!!  I love cooking from scratch and this is the most consistent recipe I have ever used.  Do you get that this is WONDERFUL??  Give it a try you will not be disappointed!!

This soup is great!  We used it with our Thanksgiving leftovers... we added in some carrots and corn to give it a little color.  It was fabulous!

In the interest of reducing the fat in this recipe, I took other reviewers' advice and reduced the butter/flour by half.  I also omitted the salt and used unsalted butter instead of margarine.  Next time I'll reduce the butter/flour further since the soup still came out extremely thick - like gravy consistency.  The flavor is very good but this recipe does need some tweaking.

This recipe was really good, and we don't usually eat soup as a meal!  I used turkey stock and I didn't have any half in half so I used 1 c. heavy cream and 1 c. skim milk.  I also substituted brandy for the sherry, because that is what I had on hand.  One other thing, just heat the soup through, if you continue to simmer the soup continues to thicken and this changed the flavor slightly.  Excellent recipe I would recommend that anyone try this.

I had my Thanksgiving a week late so I decided to use my leftover turkey for this soup and I will be making this every year - this soup is great!  I only made a few changes:  I followed some other reviewers and added some shredded carrots and frozen corn for color.  I also used about 3-4 Tbsp of read bacon bits and used fat-free half & half.  I think the next time I make this I may try to make it a little lower in fat and follow the previous reviewer and cut the butter and flour amount in half and use only 1 cup of fat-free half & half.  This soup is great and I will definitely be making this again!

This recipe is very good, I did omit the bacon though and still tasted good. I have also tried this with cut up chicken and it is tasty as well.

This is a keeper!  I did add garlic, celery and carrots.  Used Fat Free Half and Half.  The sherry was a really nice touch.  I fried the bacon, drained and then used the same pan to make the roux / cream sauce.  Saved a pan and added great flavor from the bacon.

Great way to use leftover turkey! I added a carrot & potato chopped while the rice was simmering. I also substituted skim milk for the half & half and it was still creamy enough for us.

What a tasty recipe for leftover turkey!  For convenience, I used 4 Tbsp of real bacon bits.  I also used fat-free half & half and added some shredded carrots for nutrition and color.

A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  

I played around with this recipe only because I didn’t have everything on hand.  I used white onion instead of green onion, brown rice instead of wild, real bacon bits instead of bacon, seasoning salt instead of poultry seasoning, and I omitted the dry sherry completely.  Since I was trying to use up turkey from Thanksgiving AND because my husband likes thick, meaty soups, I actually used 4 cups of diced turkey and made the soup very thick….almost like a chowder.  It was divine!  I’ve made it two more times since and it’s just an incredibly wonderful soup and really simple to make.  Oh, and my picky 9 year old AND 2 year old ate it, and the hubby has asked me to make it again!  THANK YOU, JORDANNA!

Very good! Basically, I followed the recipe.  I used about 1/2 gallon of my own turkey broth, didn't add all the flour and butter (way too much, imo) and added chopped celery and carrots for color and flavor. I fried up the bacon in the soup pot, drained out almost all of the grease and sauteed the veggies in the remaining bacon fat.  I added about 2 T.  butter and about 1/4 c. flour and let it cook for a few minutes before adding the broth.  I cooked the rice in some of the turkey broth ahead of time because it takes so long.  Then all I had to do was to combine and heat. Very yummy and my guests enjoyed it.

This soup was fantastic- and I don't say that often! I have had wild rice soups in the past that I just didn't care for. This recipe is a keeper. It's a great way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Only change I made was to add some chopped celery, carrot, and garlic. The sherry at the end adds great flavor- don't leave that out.

I had to majorally tweek this to get it to work for me. First, I just used 6 cups of chicken broth, but I probably should have used more. I started with 2 tbsp olive oil and sautéed 1 tbsp minced garlic, then added diced celery and carrots. After cooking for 5 minutes I added about 3 cups of chopped potato. To this I added my broth and rice. Because I was wary that the soup would be too bland, I added 2 tsp dried oregano, 2 tsp dried basil, 1/2 tsp pepper, and 2 tsp dried parsley. I also knew the soup would be WAY to thick using an entire 3/4 cup of flour so I scaled it back to 1/2 cup. I also used whole milk to cut back on the fat a little. When I added the cream mixture to the rice mixture it was more like rice pudding than soup, so I ended up adding another 4 or 5 cups of chicken broth to make it creamy soup consistency. Oh, I also didn't bother with the bacon because I had none. So all in all a good start, and with my changes it turned out to be a nice soup. It was a HUGE batch, however, so I froze some for later. Thanks for the spring board!

Amazing Recipe.  I did add a bit to it however.  I sauteed garlic, onion in a tiny bit of olive oil, then added chopped baby carrots and mushrooms.  I sauteed that for about 10 minutes until the mushrooms looked like they were getting cooked.  Then I added the chicken stock, rice and a handful of green onions.  I followed the recipe for the next 2 steps.  I probably will mix half and half and milk next time and cut the butter, but this soup came out amazing, worthy of Panera.

used unsalted butter instead of margarine. used a mixture of 1 cup 1% milk and 1 cup heavy whipping cream instead of half-and-half. used 2/3 cup green onions. used just under a cup of wild rice. used 1/2 cup flour instead of 3/4. used 1/4 tsp pepper instead of 1/8 tsp. added about 8 chopped baby carrots in with the onions and rice at the beginning. turned out delicious; my husband said it was the best soup I've made. next time would add more pepper (or perhaps the wild rice seasoning mix).

We had already cooked the rice for stuffing and boiled the bones after eating Thanksgiving dinner for soup, adding celery & carrots to it as we did. The soup lacked flavor so I went searching. Great idea to add bacon, half & half and butter. I melted the butter in same pan as bacon was cooked, added flour, cream, salt & pepper and thickened it, then and added to soup stock along with rice. Excellent!

Even the kids liked this one - I think the bacon sold it!  Leftover turkey soup is never one of the favorites but this creamy version was delicious.  I used leftover gravy as part of the liquid for cooking the rice.

This is the perfect recipe for leftover turkey, because it doesn't TASTE like leftover turkey!  This recipe is going in my Thanksgiving file!  I threw in some leftover corn and green beans just because they were leftover too and they were great in it.

Very good.  This is a forgiving recipes and can be easily modified.  I use less margarine, only a couple of tablespoons.  I also add carrots and celery and use a regular sweet onion instead of the green onion.  Also, montreal chicken seasoning is a great substitute if you do not have poultry seasoning.

This was a great recipe.  I made it because I was trying to get rid of left over Thanksgiving turkey.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I forgot to put the sherry in.  Perfect consistancy and great flavor!

I've been making this soup for a while now ... and like most cooks, have made some changes.  I cook 2 chopped carrots, a chopped onion and 8 oz of sliced mushrooms ... set those aside until I add the turkey and 1/2 & 1/2 mixture ... I only use half of the butter and flour to save on calories and double the water and chicken broth ... this soup is still thick and creamy ... thanks for a great recipe.

This was a really good, tasty soup.  I made a note to add some corn the next time I make it because I thought it would be good and add a bit more color.

Yes, this was wonderful.  My entire family loved it.  I followed some other reviewers recommendations however I kept the majority exactly as listed.  I boiled a turkey breast and used 3 cups of the broth and then added two more cups of canned chicken broth.  I cut the flour in half and I didn't add the bacon or sherry.  I added celery and carrots and would probably add more next time.  Overall outstanding.

All I have to say is OMG, this is awesome-good. Will make it again. Only thing that I did different: I bought turkey cutlets, pan fried till cooked through. Then mixed the butter into the same pan to loosen the bits & pieces and continued with the recipe. YUM thanks

Great soup!  I did make a number of changes.  Rather than the concentrated broth and water, I used all chicken broth.  I skipped the bacon entirely.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 5T. flour.  I skipped the sherry also, because I didn’t have any.  I added 1/2 cup carrots and 1/2 cup chopped celery.  I shouldn’t have cut the flour quite as much as I did because my soup never really thickened, which caused all the solids in the soup to sink to the bottom.  I would have preferred them to be somewhat suspended in the soup, but that is easily corrected next time.

I just made this using some leftover turkey breast.  This soup had great flavor and was easy to make. I prefer my soup a little more meaty, so I doubled the amount of turkey - since I had it anyway.  I also added some carrot that I had in the freezer.  If I make this again, I would try adding a little more rice as well.  Omitted the bacon.  I think the soup is fine without it!

Made the soup and loved the flavor but would add some thyme next time and cut the flour amount....3/4 c. was way too much.

My family loves this recipe.  Gave it 4 stars sice I tweaked it a bit.  I added pasta & corn instead of rice, and omitted the bacon & sherry.  We also made a pan of stuffing, and added a scoop on top to garnish.  Yummy!

I made this for the first time this year. It is a great soup to relax with because of the turkey and cherry. I think we will make it every year. I made my own turkey stock and used that instead of using condensed chicken broth. It was great!

I was looking for a creative way to use up Thanksgiving leftovers. This was awesome. Tasted a little too "flour-y" for my liking but I will definitely try it again. Added some garlic salt, carrots.

Best thing I've ever made!  I couldn't find condensed chicken broth so I just used a 32oz container of the regular stuff and I still added the water.  I also used brown rice since I already had it.  I didn't have sherry so I used dry vermouth instead which I either doubled or tripled the amount.  I also used butter insted of margarine. I accidently doubled the pepper as well and it was still awesome.  This soup would be perfect for a bread bowl.

Yum Yum...only rated 4 stars due to a bunch of changes (mostly just cuz I'm lazy...lol).  Uncle Bens in the pot w/broth (more than called for, not sure how much), then put in turkey & green onions, the seasoning packets...let that simmer for about an hour.  Then poured in 2 c cream and the sherry at the end.  Topped with the bacon at the end.  Delish!

I'm giving it a 4 because as written I think it would be dull. I used the Unlce Ben's original wild rice as another review suggested and used the 23 herb seasoning packet that came with it instead of the salt and chicken poultry seasoning. I also used carrots, celery, and mushrooms but only because I prefer some subtance in the cream. This was an excellent meal and VERY filling. I will make this often!

This recipe is really good and easy. I would double the amount of rice used and not use bacon. The first time I made it I omitted the bacon. After making it a second time with the bacon, we all liked it better without. However, even with the bacon it got great reviews from fam & friends.

My wife normally doesn't care for soup and she loved this one!  In fact, she has insisted that I make it again.  I added carrots, peas, corn, and 1/2 c. barley to the recipe, but next time I would add twice as much broth to accomodate the liquid the barley absorbs.  Delicious, though!

Most excellent. Having never making it before, this was easy to follow and the "authorities" in the house (wife and daughter) give it two-thumbs up. They are already asking me to make another turkey so we have more leftovers. Don't know what else to say. Am looking forward to making another turkey.

My hubby loved it, my kids loved it.  I made it with a gluten free flour mix so it would be gluten free.  I sometimes make it with just turkey, sometimes just bacon, as a variation (and depending what I have thawed out).

This soup is DIVINE!  One of the best ways I've come across to use up leftover turkey by far.  My husband was ummmming through the entire meal.  I made it exactly as written except for throwing in some frozen peas and carrots for a bit of color:)

I have to edit my already glowing review because I made this soup and it is so divine!  I could honestly sit with the entire pot, a loaf of French bread and eat the whole thing.

This soup was really good! Take reviewer's advice and halve the flour and half and half, unless you want it really thick.  I also used extra wild rice.  This one's a keeper for the Thanksgiving turkey leftovers!

Ok this is a great recipe.  I change a couple of things.  First I used maple bacon.  I really gave it a nice flavor. Second I used real sherry not cooking sherry.  Lastly I added 3/4 of barley with the wild rice.  I also added an additional cup to cup and a half of broth because of the barley.  I love barley and it really added a nice texture and complement the wild rice.  A super recipe that can be tweaked to your liking!

This is a favorite for sure - I like a bit more wild rice in it, but that's just my preference.  Great recipe - have made 3 batches and froze them.  Big hit with the family.

This recipe makes a very tasty the day/week after Thanksgiving soup. I think next time I will add more wild rice than what is listed. The rice pretty much disappears right now. 
Increase the poultry seasoning to about 2 tsp. Next time will try it with boneless, skinless chicken breast. Looking forward to it.
Thanks Jordanna for a really good recipe.

Delicious and very easy!  I did not have bacon, green onions or poultry seasoning.  Instead I chopped an onion, softened the onion with some butter before adding the rice and broth.  I also used heavy cream instead of half and half.  And for a little mediterranean twist I added a little bit of curry powder.  Yum!

I am on the site looking for leftover turkey recipes.  I already know we are going to have this.  I've made it before and it is FANTASTIC.  I have also used chicken.  Sometimes I add a little shredded carrot for color and flavor.  Please try this - you will love it.

Hands down the best wild rice soup I have found!  Love it, so much so I have made it twice this week!  The only rice I had on hand was a preseasoned wild rice blend from the bulk section of my grocery store.  I just cooked that according to the instructions instead of doing step 1.  I am glad that I ended up doing it that way, because when it came time for step 3, I used the broth to thin the marj/flour/milk mixture to a more manageable consistency.  I like it with either chicken or turkey, and instead of marj I have tried Smart Balance 50/50 blend which worked just fine.  The only other thing I do to cut the fat is remove the fat from the bacon and cook just the meat.  You get all the flavor, just avoid some of those extra calories.

very thick, but I added a handful of barley, this could have contributed. I also used milk instead of cream. next time, add more broth (if adding the barley). Good use of left over turkey. I also added carrots and corn for some veggies.

This recipe was great, I made several modifications to reduce calories/fat and it still had trememdous flavor. I doubled the rice, sub'd milk for 1/2 of the half and half. I also decreased the margarine to 1/4 c. and the flour 1/3 c. I used fresh thyme, rosemary and sage instead of the poultry seasoning 
(really added a amazing flavor) and I also subbed red wine for the sherry. It was a bit thin, so I added 2 cans of Fat free cr. of mushroom and added shredded carrot and chopped celery for color/texture. It was a hit! Loved it put it in my permanent keepers!

My husband and I are always looking for those "leftover" turkey recipes to help us whittle away at what's left of that gigantic turkey. 

And while our search will never be over, I'm glad to say that this recipe has found a permanent place in our leftover turkey recipe collection.

Now for the savory details! We followed the recipe as directed except that we reduced the flour to 1/3 cup for a lighter soup, and we added 1/2 of a red bell pepper for some additional color and flavor; it was delicious!

Our next project will be to try and make a reduced fat version. I'll edit this post if we succeed.

This was a great recipe! I agree that this came out a bit thick and will probably add a bit more chicken broth next time. I didn't have wild rice, so used 2/3 cup long grain rice instead. I also added a can of sweet corn. I did not have dry sherry, so just left it out of the recipe. It was delicious and my guests really loved it. It was a hearty, thick, creamy soup that hit the spot on a cold winter day. I will definitely make this again!

When I made this soup it came out very thick and chunky.  I had to add 3 cups of water and some chicken boullion to make it a nice soupy thick.  It tasted very good and was filling.

I used this recipe and modified it to what I had on hand. I had most of the ingredients. Had to use brandy instead of the dry sherry. Added some baby portabella mushroom and a few more spices and herbs. I added alittle tabasco sauce to mine when I served it. Turned out great. Will make again. Thanks for the easy recipe.

Fantastic recipe! Absolutely delicious. My only alterations: I used butter rather than margarine, and I added a single diced carrot. Probably worth mentioning that I don’t know much about sherry. I used a “Medium Amontillado blend”, because other than cream sherry, that is the only kind I can find in the nearby stores.

I’ve made this soup since 2002.  It’s a family favorite.  
I add diced carrots, onions and celery - cooked after cooking bacon.  Half of my family prefers it brothy (rather than cream), so I make both.  To make brothy, just omit creamy steps.   We garnish with bacon and chopped green onions.

I tried this recipe.  I decided to add carrots and celery for more nutrition.  The only problem I ran into was with the flour mixture.  It did not turn out creamy and bubbly but really lumpy like dough.  I redid it with only 1/4 cup flour.  Much better!   The soup turned out delicious and I will definitely make again as I love creamy soups!

Used white rice instead of wild but was still incredible!! Made it 2 different times, once cooking rice separately and boiling stock and once with rice cooked in stock. Needed extra liquid when cooking in stock. Both ways were still delicious.

Made no changes.  It did thicken up a lot.  No problem.  I just thinned it out with a little more broth.  I finished my bowl then took my spoon straight to the pot!  Life is good. Yum, yum! Still can't figure out the need for the sherry but don't want to change anything.  It's an excellent turkey soup recipe.

Made it as directed except I omitted the sherry as I didn’t have any in.  Yummy soup.  Next time I will omit the added salt as it was a tad too salty. Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I looked at other reviews, and sautéed 1/4 cup sliced carrots, 1/2 cup diced celery, 1/2 cup green onions, 1 tsp. minced garlic, and 5 sliced brown mushrooms in 2 Tbs oil until soft. I added this to 1 qt. turkey stock with wild rice. I made a roux with 1/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup butter, and 1 cup half and half. I added the salt, pepper, and 1 tsp. poultry seasoning. I added an additional cup of chicken broth to thin it a bit more. I only added 2 strips of crumbled bacon, because that was what I had on hand, and omitted the sherry because I didn't have any. My husband, who is not the biggest turkey soup fan, loved it!

I think this is a very bland soup. I followed the directions exactly but still feel I needed something else to perk it up a bit. I guess it will be more S/P. Don't think I'll make it again.

I just finished making this soup and it's amazing! The store did not have wild rice so I used brown and I added 2 full cups of turkey meat. It tastes delicious and I can't wait to taste it tomorrow!

Loved the flavor - but 3/4 C of flour was waaaaaay too much. It resulted in a thick paste which in turn made the soup thicker than I wanted. Thinned it with some more chicken broth and it was okay. The other change I made was to boil the turkey carcass in the cooking wild rice. I’ll make it again, but with these changes.

Delicious. We used turkey stock that we made from our turkey instead of the condensed chicken soup and water. We also added more bacon. Yummy. Even the kids liked it.

We make this a few times a year,  adding chopped spinach and red bell pepper and also decreasing the roux (butter/flour mixture) by half and using half and half and 2 percent milk mixed. No one notices the difference with 1/2 the roux and cream.

Flavour was delicious, but it turned out a bit too thick for my liking. I will thin it out next time by either using more chicken stock, or less flour. Very tasty though!

I kept almost most everything the same. I just added way more vegetables , leeks, frozen corn, frozen peas, carrots, shallots and used the home made broth we made from the Christmas turkey. ITS DELICIOUS! Nice, thick, hearty, perfect for a winter soup!

I always make changes :) Used homemade turkey broth. Rice was precooked so added it at the end. Added gravy to the soup and a little flour and water mix. Had no milk so used 4 oz of cream cheese to cream it. All in all it was great and the hubster loved it. Thanks!

The whole family loved this. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned or perfect! I would consider adding a bit more wild rice just to hearty it up. Bacon was fine but I would consider leaving it out next time. I might add celery.

The soup is easy to make, but it was pretty bland, and I even made it from a Fried Turkey Carcass I boiled down to get the turkey stock instead of the chicken stock.  Recommend adding Italian spices, garlic, basil, and a dash of Cajun spices.  Also the recipe calls for too much flour in the butter.  Cut by half.

Update on my previous review!  Having eaten dinner rather than tasting /testing my soup I can attest that the quinoa I suggested adding (1 cup organic red, black and white quinoa from Sam's club) absolutely took this soup/chowder to not only the next level but nearly off the chart!!! But the next (hopefully not final!) addition I came upon is adding your choice of clean, trimmed and chopped spinach or kale!  Additionally, with the super grain quinoa going into the pot, followed by a milk roux versus a cream one , accompanied by either the spinach or kale, I honestly cannot think of s more fulfilling, wholesome, delicious and most OF ALL HEALTHY SOUP you could find!  Emphasis on healthy!  Thanks for allowing me to get excited about soup!!!!

I didn't have bacon or green onions, so I think it would've been even better that way, but we all still liked it. Great way to use leftover turkey. Good comfort food. Next time I might bake biscuits on top in the oven.

Veryyyy yummy soup! I substituted the chicken broth with home made Turkey broth which I think really kicked up this dish. I also used uncle beans wild rice and herb mix so it cut down the time of cooking just a bit and added the package from uncle beans to the cream mix. I found this very flavourful and thick making it a must make comfort food!

I knew this recipe would be bland as soon as I read it, so I followed some of the front page reviews. Added more vegetables, reduced the flour and butter by half, and added in 2 tsp each of basil, oregano, and parsley. The herbs made it. I tried the soup without the herbs, and it was terribly bland with no flavor. Much better with the herbs added in. It's a great recipe as a base, but you definitely need to follow other reviewer's advice to make the recipe better, or experiment on your own with it.

A great soup for leftover turkey! I am not a fan of turkey, however, I will eat it & make it for thanksgiving.  This year I was looking for recipes to use up leftover turkey.   I was actually surprised at how well this soup tasted an how easy it was to make. I did not have bacon but it still was great! Otherwise I made the soup exactly as written. Next time I will add the bacon.  A must try!!

This was a very tasty soup!! It tasted as good as it looked.  The one difference in my version was that I used venison (deer) bacon instead of pork bacon.  (We make our own bacon.)  The venison bacon we make is much thicker and meatier and definitely gave it a good flavor in every spoonful.  Since a lot of people wouldn't have access to venison bacon, I think a good alternative would be smoked polish sausage or kielbasa.  

I agree with others that adding corn would be a good addition.  I will try that next time.  Another change I would suggest is to add more rice.  I didn't think this amount was even noticeable in the soup.

I try not to make huge changes to a recipe and then rate it BUT this was too good not to post! It will become a yearly staple for using up extra Thanksgiving turkey! I made two big changes. First, I used fat free half and half and the taste did not suffer but I could not imagine omitting the bacon. The second change was using a gluten free flour (that is mostly rice). I figured this is a rice dish and I really wanted my GF kid to be able to eat it too. I used pinapple juice for the dry Sherry (according to a substitution website) and you could not taste the juice at all. Actually, ALL my boys liked it (even the pickier 5 year old). I served it with Panera Bread Bowls I got at SAMS. Yum!

Wonderful soup! I added carrots, white onion, garlic, used Uncle Ben's Wild Rice, and ground turkey. I sautéed the veggies for 8-10 minutes before adding the broth and rice. Try it, you'll love it!

The only change I made was to substitute 7 cups of organic chicken broth (not condensed) for the cans of condensed broth and the water.  Everything else I did exactly as written...It is absolutely delicious!  A lovely way to use up some of those turkey left-overs.

used 4 pieces bacon.  used cooked leftover chicken about 2.25 cups.  Cooked bacon, removed, then sauteed leek 2 cloves garlic and celery.  Added broth and used wild rice mix.  When rice 1/2 cooked (20 minutes) added carrots, cabbage and corn.  cut flour down by 1/2. cut butter to 1/2 stick (did 1/2 butter and 1/2 margerine).  Used 1 cup 2% milk.  Didn't have poultry seasoning.  Used salt, black pepper (upped black pepper to 1/4 tsp), thyme, paprika and a pinch cayenne. Delicious!

This is my new favorite soup for leftover turkey from thanksgiving dinner.  The green onions vs. white or yellow onions really gave it that "fresh" taste.  I used frozen home-made turkey stock and threw in 2TBS frozen turkey drippings.  I cut back on the flour (eye-balled) because I didn't want it too thick and I also  added 1 TBS dried thyme leaves.  I added in chopped up broccoli stems for nutrition.  Also, I  simmered for 15 minutes at the end vs. just heating through.  It was delicious and a hit with my picky kids.  Very hearty and filling on a cold winter day.

This recipe is fast and easy to understand as written.  I make no changes and it turned out perfectly.  I believe it would be easy to do step 1 in a crockpot, low for 3-4 hours.  I'll be making this soup again.

This is a delicious soup, and relatively easy also.  Like some other reviewers, I used 2% milk rather than half & half, and cut the flour back to about 1/3 cup.  The consistency was perfect.  It would have been way too thick for us with the full 3/4 cup flour.  I also added just a bit more poultry seasoning, and upped the black pepper as well.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I love to use this as a base for other cream soup combination.  I used Zataran's Wild Rice but only half the box and it already has seasoning in it.  It really turned out great.  I think I will use less half and half and perhaps use part milk.  I also prefer real butter

I have been making this recipe for years, it is an all time favorite with me and anyone I make it for.  Absolutely delicious. Looks beautiful in a bowl with the white creamy broth the black rice, green onions and the bacon.   My recipe does not have the sherry in it but will give that addition a try the next time I make it.

I'm usually not a huge fan of leftover turkey, but this soup is fabulous!! I couldn't find wild rice, so I used the Uncle Ben's Long Grain & Wild Rice with the seasoning packet, and it was super flavorful without adding any salt or pepper. I just served the bacon on the side. Will definitely make again!!

I have been using this recipe for about 2 1/2 years now and absolutely love this soup. The first time I used it I was looking for a recipe for leftover Thanksgiving turkey. Since then I have made it numerous times, usually making double batches at a time so I can share it with others or freeze it. I usually don't deviate from the recipe at all and it comes out perfect. Sometimes I do add a little water to thin it down so it goes farther. The only thing I do differently is I use a precooked turkey breast bought from the store chopped in a food processor. Who has time to cook a whole turkey? lol For the rice I use Carolina Long Grain & Wild Rice with Seasoning just because that's what I found when I went shopping. I think it adds excellent flavor overall to the soup. This is one of my favorite recipes and I make it about every 1 to 2 months, even in the summer.  In fact I just make a batch and am sitting here eating a bowl as I write this review, soooo yummy! :)

Great recipe as is! However, if you get upset with reviewers who make changes, then read no further :)  I've made this several times, and have adjusted to accommodate what I had on hand. I use frozen, cubed bacon "lardons" with some chopped up carrot and celery as the first step, rather than adding bacon at the end. Once the bacon has rendered and the carrots are starting to caramelize, then I add the broth. I didn't have green onions on hand or wild rice, so I used long grain rice.  I used seasoned salt instead of regular, omitted the poultry seasoning and used milk instead of half-and-half. The sherry adds great flavor, so don't skip that!

I was so pleasantly surprised at how fabulous this soup was!  I'm not familiar with 'condensed' chicken broth so I used 3 14.5oz cans of reduced sodium chicken broth and only 1 cup of water.  I added a handful of matchstick carrots & didn't measure how much turkey I added, but otherwise made as directed. It was so good I ate two bowls for dinner!  Even the reheated leftovers stayed creamy and rich.  This is definately a keeper for my leftover turkey.

THIS recipe, with the roux, would be way too thick, so I only gave it 3 stars.  However, I tried it with 50% more chicken broth and just added 1.5 cups of whipping cream and it turned out really good, a 4 star.

Simple to make, ratios worked fine for me.   Missing vegetables to lighten it, was very heavy.   Made again with sauted carrots, onion, and celery (about 3 cups total) and whole milk, and about 1t. Curry powder.   Wow!   Thanks for great way to use turkey leftovers

I made this for a football game half-time meal at my local watering hole and received many rave reviews.  This was very tasty!  The only thing I did different was use Canoe canned wild rice instead of the uncooked rice called for in the recipe.

I scaled the recipe up to 12 servings.  Added carrotts, celery and 4 cloves of garlic and simmered left over turkey legs and wings to enhance the flavor.  Also doubled the rice, which meant I needed to add more stock.  About 3 cups.  The flour and butter should be cut in at least half, as it makes way too much rue.  Only added half of what I made.  Used 50% half and half and 50% fat free half and half.  Added more salt and taragon at the end.  Very hearty and delicious!

Good base recipe that I could play with to make my own to use ingredients I have on hand, use up the last of the Thanksfgiving turkey and make it lighter so I don't feel guilty eating it.

Oh my gosh! My entire family absolutely loved this! My son, who doesn't like soup at all, thought it was fantastic!!! I didn't have sherry so I used wine instead. Definate keeper. I'm headed out now to buy some more stuff to make another batch. Thank you for sharing!!!!

This was not that great. First of all, it was a bit bland. More importantly, the directions for the cream part made a lumpy mess. I was able to still salvage it, but was left with some small clumps of flour in my soup - very unappealing. Also the bacon became mushy and chewy in the soup which was not good and I love bacon. My sister and her boyfriend liked it though, so I am still giving it 3 stars. I, too, added some veggies to give it a little more nutrition. I left out the sherry because I forgot it (was busy dealing with the clumps) so perhaps that would have helped the blandness.

I've made this two years in a row and the family loves it!! I don't use any water only turkey broth from the carcass. Add carrots and celery and omit the Sherry because I didn't have any this year and couldn't tell the difference. Let it sit for a bit and it thickens up. Pour over noodles or white rice. Yum!

Fantastic!!!  I did tweak a few things because of supplies I had on hand.  I used chicken, boiled it with the rice/broth and then cubed.  I, too, cut the butter and flour in half, and then I added condensed milk instead of cream/half-and-half.  Tossed in a few frozen green peas and It was splendid!  Thanks for the great recipe...it's nice not to use those high sodium soup cans!

This was an absolutely delicous soup.  Great for those cooler days outside, to warm you up on the inside.  Fantastic taste!  My husband isn't a soup fan but he loved this one.

This was really good soup! I added diced smoked sausage, frozen corn & black beans. I omitted the bacon and used real butter, rather than margerine. This is a fantastic recipe to work with. I'm looking forward to making again, using different variations. Thanks for sharing!

Incredible just as is.  This last time I didn't have any bacon thawed so I add a little of Baco Bits.  Little bit healthier and still pretty darn good.  Would recommend this to everyone.  This is an all time favorite especially after Thanksgiving.

YUM!  I made this for a crowd, so I made some changes.  I used a whole white onion, several carrots, some corn, and celery.  I used a cup of wild rice, a quart plus a can of chicken stock, and 3 cups of water.  I had a 1 lb of ground turkey and 1 lb pork/bacon sausage.  This was the meat I used.  I added chicken stock granuales to taste.  The end result was a real crowd pleaser.  I finally know how to make a decent creamy soup perfect for those cold ND winter nights!

My very extended family LOVES this soup.  The first time I made it, I kept thinking there was something missing and then I realized there was... the Sherry.  I forgot to add it.  Once I did, this was fantastic. I usually add celery, carrots and red bell pepper for color.  The last time I made it, I didn't add any salt at all, but threw in a couple of teaspoons of Konrico All Purpose Greek Seasoning.  The family declared that the best batch yet.

Excellent flavor and very filling.  I add 1 Tbsp. of chopped pimento to this recipe just before serving for a little something extra... I recommend serving the soup with a hearty wheat or rye bread.

This soup was really good. I would make a couple changes next time though. I would leave out the salt and use a lower sodium chicken broth.

This is quite delicious.  I added a can of sweet corn and used 1 cup of half and half and 1 cup of non-fat milk.  To save even more on calories and fat, I didn't add the bacon.  Everyone at the table thought it was excellent.  I did have to add more pepper to spice it up a bit.  Thanks for a great recipe that I'm sure to use again!

Loved the soup!  The first time it was too salty so the next time I used lower sodium chicken broth and omitted the salt.  To lower the fat I used milk instead of half & half.  I also added corn.  Delicious!

Absolutely delicious!  I used leftover chicken instead of turkey (and decreased the poultry seasoning).  Next time, to reduce the fat, I'll omit the bacon.  It's good but doesn't add that much to the recipe.  Had to add some milk at the end, it was so thick.   This is a terrific fairly low-carb dish.

I'd like to give this 2 stars however my husband made so much mmmm noise while he ate this, I had to bump the rating up to be fair. He'd give it 5 stars.  I didn't like it, nor did the kids.  I used half home-made turkey broth and half chicken broth and I used long grain white rice instead of the wild.  Also, instead of using 1/2 cup margarine, I stirred the flour and seasonings into the bacon grease.

Very good recipe but reminded all of us of clam chowder (must be the bacon and the half and half).  Good flavor and great way to use up left-over turkey, although I 
couldn't hep but feel guilty eating this with all the margarine, bacon, and cream.

I made this soup on Friday after Thanksgiving and it was great.  Even my picky four-year-old liked it.  I made it exactly as the recipe called for except for the sherry; my mom did not have any.  Next time I am going to try a lower fat version but I will be making it soon.

This recipe was not too bad, however it was missing something.  I even added carrots and mushrooms.  It is lacking some spice or maybe more black pepper.

This was the best after Thanksgiving soup yet!
I had leftover mashed potatoes and I have a big family so I stretched it by adding more broth and then adding the mashed potates in with the cream, it kept it's creamy texture even with the additional broth and added flavor too!

Like other reviewers, I, too added some carrot and corn for color.  Also, I added another cup of broth to thin the soup since it was a little thick for my tastes.  Overall pretty good, but not sure if it is worth all the fat.
