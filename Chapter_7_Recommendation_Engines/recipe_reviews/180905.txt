I thought this recipe was deliciuous! My family loved it! The only thing I would do differently the next time I make it is double the bacon and bread crumbs. That sweet crunchy topping was wonderul and I wanted more!

VERY rich, filling and decadent.  it is delicious, but i would tweak it in the following ways.  use a whole package of bacon - 4 slices is not even close to being enough.  definitely double the rest of the topping mixture, but mix it in all together with the pasta before baking.  also, 8 cups total of cheese is a little much - i used about 6, and even that was a lot.  i would probably go with 4-5 cups next time, any cheeses of your choice is fine but the asiago has a great flavor and paired surprising well with the bacon.  i also added chopped broccoli and shiitake mushrooms to the pasta mixture, which was delicious.  i used buttermilk instead of regular milk because it was in my fridge and i had to use it up, and that worked fine too, but probably definitely added to the richness of this dish.  next time i will also sprinkle a layer of panko and parsley on the top of the pasta before baking for some added crunch and color.

Well, I debated a long time on how many stars to give this recipe. If I could have given 3 1/2 I would have. Let it be known that I made this recipe to the letter.  The recipe takes MUCH longer to prepare than the said prep+cook time. I also believe there are too many ingredients. Most of the best cuisine is created with few ingredients - just travel to Italy or Spain and it is apparent. Some of these could have been modified or left out (maybe bumping up the quantity of more important ingredients).  I won't be making this again; a little too rich and way too time consuming for a side dish. Don't let that deter you, though, because Im glad I made it and if you love all things mac-n-cheese, go for it. That being said, the outcome is good. Very gourmet tasting, and has beautiful aesthetic appeal.

This was THE BEST macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted! I cut back on the fat by draining and discarding the bacon grease, and using non-fat cream cheese and non-fat sour cream elsewhere in the recipe.  When adding butter to the cooked pasta, I only used 2 tablespoons, instead of 4.  In place of the milk, I used non-fat canned milk for a nice, creamy taste and texture.    I've tried this with both medium and sharp cheddar cheese.  I think the medium is best because it doesn't overpower the wonderful flavor of the asiago cheese.  For the bacon, I put it into the freezer just long enough to firm it up then thinly sliced it before frying.  Like many reviewers, I doubled the topping. Because the recipe takes awhile to make, I usually double the recipe, baking it in 2 9x13 inch pans plus an 8x8 inch pan.  I chill it after baking, cut it into serving sized squares and pop it into individual freezer bags for a quick and easy treat.  Pepper Bacon is wonderful in this recipe.  My family loves this recipe.  I'll be making it again and again.   Thanks to the submitter!

WOW!  Only 3 stars because...This recipe took 2 hours to prepare BEFORE putting it into the oven.  (11:38am in the pan at 1:40pm) It also seems to dirty lots of dishes!   BUT.. it is SUPER YUMMY!!!  Will make again when I have more time and energy for all those dishes!  I'm pooped!  :O)

This was amazing! I LOVED the cheeses used!!! My hubby and daughter gobbled this up for dinner and we have left overs for lunch tomorrow! It took me an hour to prep, but I had to grate the cheeses myself and I doubled the recipe. Yummy!! Thanks for this recipe!

Excellent mac and cheese.  This was very filling.  Like the other posting, I would double the bread crumb mixture.

This was a good recipe. I had to change a few things just out of necessity. I used cheddar cheese and what I had left of some Parmesan. I really like the topping of this but the prep time does seem long but worth it. Read the entire recipe over and then prep. I also doubled the amount of topping as suggested by other reviewers and I definitely recommend that. Thanks very much for this recipe.

Oh my oh my oh my - this recipe takes a loooong time to prepare, but it's deliciously worth it. If you have problems getting the delicious bacon stuffs off the pan, deglaze the pan with a little white or red wine and it will cook nicely into the onions.

We were in need of serious comfort food tonight and I remembered this recipe. This is the ultimate mac and cheese! We absolutely loved it. Asiago is one of our favorites. Pair it up with the sharp white cheddar I used, and it was a perfect match. I cut this down to 4 servings and it still easily fed 6 - 7 people. It does take a little longer to prepare than most mac and cheese recipes but it sooo worth it. I'm thinking this needs to be on one of the menus coming up for the holidays. This is definately our favorite mac and cheese now. Thanks for sharing!

This is a terrific recipe. I added carrots and bell pepper to the caramelized onions for a little color and diversity. I am thinking about adding broccoli or celery along with the other vegetables in the future. This recipe is a keeper!

This was outstanding. I'm constantly looking for new mac and cheese recipes- this one really delivered. It does take much longer then 20 minutes to prep; however, if everything was bought pre-shredded, etc, it might cut down on the time. To save time, read through the recipe and move the steps around to better coordinate with your own kitchen.  Thank you Thank you!!

Now this is what mac and cheese is supposed to be like! Very rich and creamy, I didn't use any low fat anything in it, it's comfort food. Not something I would eat every day, maybe every other day. I doubled the bacon because I like to add bacon to the mac and cheese mixture, Ya can't ever get enough bacon. This is one of the 3 mac and cheese recipes I will always rely on.

Made this for family Thanksgiving pot luck and it was met with rave reviews.  Everyone kept asking if it was "real" macaroni and cheese (?).  The recipe is labor intensive and does require many pots and pans but the end result is worth it.  I think some tweaks could be made to make it some easier - my biggest suggestion would be to mix the bacon and onions into the macaroni instead of being on top.  We had some issues with the bacon burning on top.  But that is our only complaint!

I live in London and made this yesterday for my Independence Day celebration.  I received two marriage proposals because of it.  So I guess that means this will now be my staple mac and cheese recipe.  The real question is, Aussie or French?  Decisions!!! 

P.s. I used 2 cups each of emmental (swiss), mature aged cheddar, and mozzarella for the main dish and used 1 cup of parmesan cheese and 1 cup mozerella on the top!  I didn't have paprika or ground mustard and didn't feel that it was missing anything without them.  Seriously proposal worthy!

This recipe was phenomenal.  It tasted amazing but HOLY MOLEY IT'S A PAIN IN THE BUTT.  I dirtied almost every utensil and dish that we own.  Clean up was a pain.  The only reason I won't make it again is because of how long it took to prep.

Flavor = 5 Stars.  Dish = 4  Agree to what other reviewers recommended in doubling up on the topping.  I like my mac & cheese a little creamier and I suggest cutting the flour down to 3 tablespoons and adding another cup of milk for a total of 4 cups.  The noodles do not need to be cooked prior as it will cook in the oven leaving the consistency perfect!

Fantastic. This is my go to Mac and Cheese. After making I freeze some for later. This is work the time and effort. I cook a four lb pack of bacon periodically & freeze it. When bacon is called for in recipes, I simply take some out of the freezer. Thank you for sharing.

This is a very yummie recipe. I took other's advice and doubled the topping. I am not a lover of strong cheeses, so I changed the asiago to havarti and it was very good --just not quite the bite to it. It was even good as a leftover the next day for lunch

Super great instead of doubling top i halved the mac... it didnt take as long as everyone else was saying for me prolly 30 minutes prep. I believe anything worth doing is worth the time to do it... this was worth it :) i dint change anything other than halving it

Keep in mind this is the first time I have cooked a real meal. I love love love mac and cheese, just any version at a homestyle restaurant. My obsession came from childhood and eating at hometown buffet. So I love creamy mac and cheese. This is part of the reason why my rating is only four. I wasn't necessarily expecting creamy or anything, but it did come across as dry. It was just melty cheese that stiffened, but it was soft and gooey enough for me. I went into the grocery store, not sure how much of the recipe I wanted to make. But when I looked at the prices of the cheese, I was about to make a 2 person serving. I was so shocked, but I really wanted to make the recipe. So I bought, a 10 oz block of Vermont and 8 oz block of Asiago... and I didn't really grate the cheese, I kind of half heartly did and mainly shredded. I had to do this for about 1.5 hrs. I managed to get 2 cups of each cheese (although I don't think it should've been that much), so I made half the recipe, and it was too much cheese IMO. There are way too many separate things going on this recipe that it stressed me out being an unexperienced and anal (about measurements) cook. All the dishes left afterward made me upset. But I love bacon and onions and the breadcrumbs so it redeemed itself. I blame myself for it not coming out the best, because when I reheat it, it tastes brand new and a little more creamy, but overall I just want regular mac n cheese. Too expensive and fancy. :P

Wow!   This is soooo good.  It takes a bit of work but the results are well worth it.  I've made homemade macaroni and cheese for years always adding the cheese to the sauce.  Adding the cheese directly to the noodles and then mixing the white sauce in makes the mac and cheese much cheesier.  The only thing I did differently was use about a Tbsp. of dried parsley and omit the paprika and hot pepper sauce.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was delicious.  I only used 2 cups Asiago,  but kept the cheddar the same.  I used regular bread crumbs, and a whole small pack of bacon.  YUM!

Oh goodness, this recipe took forever to make and I am actually really tired now. Has a good taste but all that cheese can't be good for anyone so I only used 8oz asiago and 16oz cheddar and it still tasted good. Please  be prepared before making this dish for the excessive prep time and for every dish in your cabinet to be dirty.

been making this recipe for over a year now, don't know why I am just now writing a review because I should have long ago. I love this recipe! So does my husband and our 5 kids (one is not eating solids yet or I'm sure he would too). It is amazing. The ONLY thing that I changed is that I double the bacon/carmelized onion mixture because it is so delicious I can't get enough of it.
You won't be disappointed!

A little labor intensive, but a GREAT Macaroni & Cheese! Yes, as others said double the topping.  I  used Kirkland's (Costco Brand) Real bacon bits and warmed them in a non-stick skillet, removed bacon bits and proceeded the rest of the way, just enough bacon drippings for flavor and I added a little more butter. Thans for a great recipe!

I made a "healthier" version of this recipes for Thanksgiving and got great reviews.  The orginial recipe looked too rich and heavy for my taste, so I took out a bunch of stuff to make it work as a side dish.  I thought the flavors and the spices were great, but I made the following modifications to make it healthier without compromising too much of the flavor. I omited the sour cream and cream cheese b/c I didn't have any; I used 2 cups of grated Gouda and 2 cups of Cheddar instead of 4 cups each; I sprinkled a generous amount of parmesan cheese on top.I only used 1 Tbsp of butter for the noodles; I used 8 strips of turkey bacon and cooked the onions in the bacon fat without oil in a nonstick pan, and also double the panko per everyone's suggestions.  

People were saying the prep time was a lot longer than listed, and for me it was because of the thickening of the milk.  I took me about 20 minutes for all the flour and butter to melt in the milk, and if I had known it would take that long, I would have started it the same time I boiled water for the noodles.  Some reviews said their mixture looked soupy, so I added 5 heaping Tbsp of flour and added a bay leave to this milk while it thickened.  

I think if I used all cheese and butter, it would be too heavy for my taste.  This way I could eat more of it without feeling TOO guilty.  I really liked it though and will definitely be making it again!  Hope this helps anyone looking for a "healthier" version of this recipe.

A hearty mac and cheese! The topping is great- especially appreciated by my husband who isn't a big fan of mac and cheese. I accidentally cooked too long (got busy and forgot about it) and it came out dry- don't overcook!

This is amazing!! We are cheese lovers so we used a variety of cheeses (not just asiago and cheddar). We also used parmasan and fontina. Romano would be great as well. Like other reviewers, I think this would be better if the bread crumbs and butter (the dry topping) were doubled.

This would be a great thing to bring to a Fourth of July picnic. Honestly, as a main entree, it starts to get boring after a while so it would be nice as a really good side dish with hot dogs or something off the grill.

This was so yummy! My husband doesn't even like macaroni and cheese, but gobbled this up. Only change I made, was I doubled the topping, and used Havarti cheese because I couldn't find Asiago. Takes a while to make this one, but it's worth it!

This recipe looks a little intimidating but there are a few shortcuts you can take to cut down on the prep time. Even with this changes this recipe was delicious and got rave reviews from my family at Thanksgiving. The first thing I did was use real bacon bits instead of frying slices of bacon. These are found in the salad dressing aisle (at leas that's where they are in Cub). I also just used an assortment of shredded cheeses- sharp cheddar, mozzarella, Parmesan and an Italian blend (it's what I had on hand). I didn't add any of the bread crumbs and I also didn't add the caramelized onions because I knew certain family members wouldn't like them because they (gasp) don't like onions! I basically followed the directions for the cream cheese, sour cream, egg mixture and then the roux. Mixed that all together with the pasta, added the spices and the cheese. Then baked until golden brown and bubbling. With a few of those changes it should cut down your prep time. Next time I make it I will be adding the caramelized onions because I think that added sweetness would be delicious! And, adding bacon to anything instantly makes it a crowd favorite! Don't get too scared by the number of ingredients and give this a try- you won't be disappointed :)

OMG!!!!  This was the BEST mac and cheese that I've ever had!!!  I didn't use the Asiago cheese (pregnant...over cautious) instead just used more cheddar (Tillamook extra-sharp Special Reserve).  I cooked the bacon and onions as directed and tossed the noodles with sour cream, egg and butter as directed but also added Parmesan cheese.  Instead of tossing shredded cheese with the noodles and making what appeared to be a roux, I just made a simple cheese sauce; whisked together the milk, butter, flour and spices, let it come to a boil, reduced and added cheese cubes, stirring until all the cheese had melted.  Then I mixed it into the noodles and followed the directions as written. DEFINATE KEEPER!!!!!

This is an awesome recipe..the only thing that isn't correct is the prep time!! This takes me forever to prepare, I just sat down after an hour of cooking the different portions of the recipe. Maybe someone more experienced in the kitchen would be quicker.. At any rate, I will continue to make this for large events, as there is a TON of this yummy dish when you are finished making it!! Thank you sooooo much for this wonderful take on boring old mac n cheese!

This is not JUST macaroni and cheese this is mac and cheese on steroids.  Goodness it was a lot of work and I kept saying this better be worth it...and it didn't disappoint.  It is fabulous and you have to try it but be prepared to spend some time on it.  As I was in heaven eating it, I said, I guess this will be company mac and cheese but who wants to do all that work when you have company so ....while I won't make it every time I want mac and cheese I will make it occasionally because I can't go the rest of my life without having it again.  The topping is what makes it, obviously, so double up on it without question.....and it doesn't need that much cheese.  Next time I will try 3 cups of each and maybe possibly 2 1/2 cups of each.  It's a lot and overkill and I LOVE CHEESE.

This was so yummy. Due to other comments, I doubled the topping.Glad I did. Also, in addition to Asiago and Aged Cheddar, I used some Gouda. This recipe would make awesome potatoes au graten as well. I may try that next time. Thanks for sharing this,
it's a keeper!

A little time consuming, but definitely. I knew it would be good because anything involving bacon and onions will be fabulous. Unfortunately, may husband forgot the cheddar cheese so I only had asiago cheese, but even w/that, it was still delicious. My only concern was that the liquid milk mixture didn't seem to be enough...the mac overall was a little dry. I would increase the mixture by half.

My husband and I both enjoyed this.  I used 2% Sharp Cheddar Cheese (because that is all I had on hand) and light Sour Cream.  While I am not a low-fat cook, it was so flavorful with the bacon and onions, that I would use lighter cheese and less butter next time as well.  Definitely add more bacon.  I served it with Roasted Asparagus.  A good comfort food meal and nice change from your typical Mac & Cheese dish.  Oh, it definitely takes longer than the said 20 minutes to prepare.  I think it took me about 45-50 minutes.

The prep time is underestimated.  I doubled the carmelized onions (2 large onions) and increased the bacon to 10 slices and got rave reviews.  It's a lot of prep time, but well worth it.

Eh... not great! Although, I did leave the onions out- just lacked flavor, I guess- it was good, but for the amount of preparation that goes into it (MUCH longer than claimed!), I don't think it's worth it.

I followed this recipe almost exactly except I used 2 cups of Parmesan and 6 cups of sharp cheddar. I also used cornflakes instead of bread crumbs and doubled the bacon and crumbs like other reviews suggested.  It was AWESOME. My husband LOVED it. I let the leftovers cool and cut it up and froze it in individual baggies. They make great lunches!

Using sour cream AND cream cheese seems a bit redundant.  We thought this was a bit dry as well.  Looking for a creamier, saucier recipe.

This was my first ever attempt at making homemade macaroni and cheese.  Even though I felt a little intimidated, it came out SO DELICIOUS!  I made this for a PotLuck luncheon I was hosting and one guest called it, "Life Changing!!!" We all heartily agreed.  I will *definitely* be making this again!

Best Mac & Cheese recipe ever. I quadrupled the recipe and made 16lbs of it for a Christmas party and everyone loved it.

A lot of work and worth every bit of it. I also doubled the topping and added a little butter to the panko crumbs. Had to keep people from trying to get just topping. A great side to a ham dinner if you like to eat.

This is the truth.  I have made several dishes from this site. I get the recipes emailed  daily. They all  are amazing. 
But I haven't ever taken the time to write a review. But today is a must. 
I did double the bread crumbs too and used an Italian  4 cheese with sharp cheddar.  My boyfriend LOVED it. Said he was full but had to have another bowl. It's a lot of work but worth it!!!

We loved it!  Like everyone said, I doubled the topping and I'm glad I did because it's the best part. I didn't have Asiago so I used all cheddar and I also used seasoned bread crumbs and hubs liked it just fine. I also shorted the butter a little here and there, just for health's sake (I know, 'hahaha'). Also, had I read all the comments about it being so time-consuming and messy (uses a lot of dishes) I probably would have passed over this recipe BUT, since it turned out so good, I'm sure I'll make it again.

Incredible! By far the best Mac n cheese I've ever made. It's definitely worth the extra effort. It was an easy recipe just a bit time consuming. The only change I would make is double the topping. It was so delicious and we wanted more bacon. Thanks for an amazing recipe!

This recipe was delicious. I'm actually craving it and need to make more as I'm completely out. I froze individual portions and stored them in the freezer. Heated them up in the microwave, from frozen and they were perfect. Even though it took me quite a while to put this recipe together, it was SO worth it. You will not be disappointed. Great to make for a party or to give as a gift. Thanks for a keeper recipe.

This was delicious - even my kids gobbled it up. I used a bit less cheese and used parmesan instead of asiago,then I added shredded carrots and chopped leftover ham to the mix and skipped the bacon just because that is what I had. Also thought I had panko and didn't so I just used bread crumbs I made in the food processor from a couple heels of whole grain bread. The topping was great even without the bacon. I will definitely be making this again, but not too often, I'll eat too much of it!

This was delicious! I dont like Mac & Cheese but keep trying. I used pepper jack cheese with the cheddar and it was wonderful. I will more than double the bacon topping because there wasnt enough but it was delicious.

Wow! Yes, this takes a while to put together, but it's worth the effort. Based on other reviews, I did increase the amount of topping, but the rest of the recipe is fantastic as-is.

Ummmm yah. I've made this dish 3 times now over the past five years. This is like my secret weapon. I ONLY USE THIS WHEN NEEDED! For instance: 1). thanksgiving potlucks when you know everyone who's coming only cares about turkey and mashed potatoes. 2). When your sisters dog dies and she needs some macaroni love. 3). And lastly a last ditch effort to get your wife (or anybody) to forgive you... If you

OMG fabulous!!!!!!!  I served it for a ladies luncheon with a salad.  The ladies couldn't get enough of it! I followed the recipe exactly, but doubled the topping as suggested in some of the reviews. Next time, I'll top with foil when baking and only remove for the last 10 minutes to brown the crust.... "for company" the top got a little darker than I wanted.(could be my oven!)

Excellent recipe. I found the Asiago cheese to be quite expensive so only used a small wedge and made the difference up with old cheddar, also added small broccoli florets. Family says definitely make again. Thanks

this is my first time ever reviewing a recipe here.  the topping for this mac n cheese is off the chain!!!  OMG it is delicious.  i didnt have panko break crumbs so i used the progresso italian breadcrumbs and used shredded cheddar cheese.  in error i used 1/2 tbs of black pepper and mustad and it was still delicious and creamy.  this is wonderful and i will definitely make again,  the only downside is that it takes more than 20 minutes prep time.

I learned something when I made this recipe...I don't care for Asiago cheese. I cut the recipe in half which filled an 8x8 pan just right. My only change was to use the full amount of bacon. This recipe takes a long time to make but looked amazing. My wife liked it but neither my son or I did. I may try it again, replacing the Asiago with another cheese. It was creamy and tangy but was to strong of a flavor for my taste.

This was a delicious mac and cheese but never again.  This recipe ended up being a comedy act for us. Maybe I’m lazy, but this was a lot of work for a mac and cheese. The amount of pots and bowls I was using filled the dishwasher before we even had a chance to eat.  So much for the rolls I was planning to bake.   I recommend making twice the amount of topping, and having your glass of wine poured and ready because you’ll be drinking it way before dinner.   So, if you have plenty of time on your hands and lots of bowls have at it, because it is quite good and everyone liked it.

WONDERFUL! didn't have asiago cheese so i subbed some parmesan and it was still great! I used precooked bacon and added it to the onions when they were almost done to cut down on cooking time. This is seriously one of my favorite recipes. If my waistline could afford it i would have it every week!

Didn't really care for the onions and bacon portion of this dish. It was a really good macaroni and cheese recipe without the extras on top. Definitely going to keep it and work on it. Thanks for the submission!!

I only made half the recipe but I kept the toppings for full recipe. This was delicious. Everyone loved it. You need to multitask to get this prepped in twenty  minutes. I put my water on to boil. Fried the bacon. I sliced the onion while bacon was frying. I started the onions as soon as bacon was done. I cooked macaroni as soon as the water boiled. Made the sauce  as soon as  the onion mixture was finished.

The best macaroni and cheese recipe I have ever made! Rich and decadent! The bacon and caramelized onions add a delicious crunchy topping with the Bread crumbs which makes the dish! Yummy !!

This recipe is fabulous! This has a lot of steps and takes a bit of time, but of so worth it! It was all the rave at our Thanksgiving feast!  As per other reviews, I doubled the topping and used 3 cups each asiago & extra sharp white cheddar - divided. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is highly underrated. I've been making it for years now and I get rave reviews every dang time. It is labor intensive, but worth it. My husband just said the other day that he can't ever get excited about mac and cheese anymore unless it is this recipe. It's that good. I do not add the hot sauce because I usually don't have any and I cook for kids, too. Still amazing. Otherwise I make it exactly as stated.

Just like old school mac & cheese Grandma used to make, but with a twist. Awesome flavors. I used jumbo elbow macaroni. Next time I will add a bit more bacon to the mixture!

Lots and OOOOhs and AAAAHs with this one.  This is a big rich casserole.  The asiago and Vermont cheddar is a fabulous mix.  The carmelized onions and bacon offers a salty/sweet offset to the warm creamy cheese.  It's richness makes it go a long way and the crowd at Easter dinner did it justice!

Great flavor.  My husband is not a fan of mac n cheese, but he loved this.  

It is a lot of prep...But worth every minute.

While this recipe can be stressful to make it is absolutely worth it!!! I've made it three times now and every time it does not last long. I made a double batch for my nursing staff at work on Christmas and left with 3 empty pans and a happy staff. I still hear from them about loving it.

5 stars for  a truly delicious dish.  I made a couple of changes because of last minute missing ingredients.  I  only had 2 cups of Asiago and so added one  cup of some Monterey Jack that was in the refrigerator.  The change probably made a mellower  blend.  Also, when I took out the bit of cream cheese I had it was moldy and so I left that ingredient out.  I am not sure that it was missed.  As other reviewers I cannot stress enough that you need to double (triple maybe) the topping .  It really makes  the dish.   Finally this is delicious but it is a lot of work.  It took me about 2 hours to get it ready for the oven.  I will make it again but save it for Christmas Eve or some other special event.

Thank goodness for previous reviews.  I think the author of the recipe meant the prep to be 1 hour and 20  minutes? I used asiago, velveeta and cheddar cheese you must double the topping with bacon and the sauce. A total of 2 hours and 15 minutes including baking time.

I only rated it three stars because I COMPLETELY disagree with the directions. This is how I did it take it as you wish to.
I  cut up some red onion and threw it in a pan with some pancetta and butter,brown sugar until it was caramelized just enough for me. Then I went back and did the rest of the steps, I mean who wants pasta with all of those ingredients just sitting there while you fry the bacon,etc? That was unappealing to me so that's how I did it. The directions are not written right in my opinion,it makes it really really time consuming when it doesn't have to be.

This was amazingly flavourful. It took me about 1.5 hours to make. For “16 oz” package read 4 cups of dried macaroni.  I used dried parsley.

I added ricotta cheese to the cream cheese mixture, cooked the bacon in the oven at 400 degrees for about 35 minutes flipping halfway which made things a lot easier. This is the ultimate comfort food.

This was delicious! I made very few changes, just a bit of chili powder and chili oil for a bit of spicy flavor along with some extra Panko on top. I may have also exceeded the cheese amount called for.....

Tripled the panko. Doubled the bacon. Carmelized the onions naturally over a 2-hour period without brown sugar.  Used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce.

OMG. So perfectly complex and delicious. Prep time was nowhere near 20 mins. All told, it took about 1:45 to make.

FANTASTIC.. I did add some mushroom and broccoli and some of the bacon bits  to the pasta as did some other posters..turned out great!! So why not 5 stars??? OMG!!! NOBODY except a tv chef could prep this in 20 minutes!! An hour IF your lucky!!! AND I filled my dishwasher w/the dishes!!!  But end results were great.. "me thinks" less ingredients would make it a much more appealing dish tho.. Make it again? YUP if I have a day off and PLENTY of time.

I’ve made this many times and it’s my favorite Mac n cheese.  It is a lot of work but worth the effort.

My family loves macaroni and cheese, so I made this for a birthday.  They liked it but preferred our traditional recipe made with cheese sauce made with cheddar and no egg, sour cream, or cream cheese, so I will stay with tradition and on occasion top it with this bacon crumb topping.

I agree with the other reviewers.  Firstly, on flavour I would give this a 5.  It is one of the best mac and cheeses I've ever eaten.  HOWEVER, and this is a big HOWEVER.  It took waaaaayyyyy too long to make - and I'm currently unemployed so have the time.    So for that I rate it a 1.  This averages out to my 3 rating.  3 hours and tens of dishes later I was exhausted before I'd even put it in the oven.  I made it exactly as outlined in the recipe and feel there must be a way to reduce the amount of ingredients and steps (and dishes used!).  Would I make it again - perhaps - but I will improvise and reduce next time.

why not carmelize the onions in the bacon grease instead of butter.

Best Mac 'n cheese I've ever had but be sure to have some time to prepare this. I didn't realize there were so many steps to making this and I started it right before everyone came over for Christmas dinner!  Needless to say we ate later than expected but it was worth the wait. The caramelized onion and bacon give this such great favor. I'm definitely going to make this again but I'll be preparing it the night before so I can just pop it in the oven the next day.

Super delicious. I was hesitant about putting the onions in, but they added such depth of flavor. I agree with others to double the bacon and onion topping. However it literally took me 2 1/2 hours of prep before it went into the oven, as well as every dish in my cabinet, so I will not make this again unless I'm making some to freeze as well.

I followed recipe to a T. This was good but I'm unsure whether it is worth the time (took me 2 hours!) and expense (cost $30 Cdn to make). I love good strong cheeses so wanted to try it. I will try it 1 more time and decide if it's a keeper. Definitely a "gourmet" form of Mac and Cheese so if that's what you're looking for,  this is it! Thanks for this unique recipe.

This is the best mac and cheese ever.   I only made very minor changes to this recipe - I didn't have 'vermont cheddar' cheese, but mild cheddar was fine.  I didn't use all the bacon drippings - I wiped some of the excess grease out of the pan, and only used a bit of the bacon drippings to cook the onions and garlic because I felt there was enough fats in place already.   If you are on a diet, this dish is not for you, but my family loved it.  It was worth the extra effort.

This is sooo good. I halved the recipe so it would fit in my 3 Qt. Pyrex dish. I used a combination of extra sharp cheddar and Emmentaler Swiss because that's what I had on hand. I did not have sour cream or creamed cheese but  it still came out silky smooth and delicious. Followed the rest of the recipe. No matter what mac & cheese recipe you use try this topping....amazing. I doubled the bacon of course and the topping took this Mac & Cheese to the next level.

I added more bacon as suggested. Not a budget friendly meal as cheese was expensive as well the bacon. Prep time is more than stated and I am an experienced cook. It was good but. Not worth the time involved.

Overall, very disappointed with the final product. Followed exact directions but texture and taste fell flat.  This recipe calls pre-mixing cheese with macaroni instead of mixing cheese with milk mixture... why?  It was gunky and difficult to mix. When I poured the milk mixture over the macaroni and cheese combination, it loosened a bit, but was still stiff and unmanageable. It was like a big tight glob! As for the ingredients, I love asiago   cheese, but not in Mac and cheese. It tasted terrible.  I think the spice measurements were inaccurate as well. (1/8 tsp of brown sugar?) In the end, the recipe was dry, lacked the traditional taste mac and cheese needs to have and needed more mustard powder, brown sugar and other flavors. Keep Asiago out of mac and cheese!

This Mac & Cheese dish will DEFINITELY be on my table again! The rich flavor of the fresh grated Asiago and the sharp element of the fresh grated New York Sharp Chedar (couldn't find Vermont Sharp)  came together perfectly! Add in carmalized onion and BACON!! How could it be anything but GREAT!

I made it with 1/2 the cheese and no paprika, but I prepared it for 50 co-workers and am playing it safe with the spice (and I didn't want to pay $20 on cheese, ha). I used mostly sharp cheddar with some high-quality Parmesan I had in the fridge. I also made twice the bacon, because everyone (except my weird, but super awesome, 11-year-old son) loves more bacon. 

THE GRAVY IS BRILLIANT, and I will be making it with sausage and adding it to homemade biscuits. (Oh, yes. I noticed.)

Please rename this "Dreamy Mac n' Cheese" ...Seriously. 

LOL at the people who said this took too long. Because, it's so worth it. It took me almost 3 hours...WORTH IT! 5 STARS, MY COOKING CHAMPIONS!

Woo-hoo! this is YUMMY! I did take suggestions and doubled the topping part but I used 1/2 red onion and 1/2 diced sweet baby peppers. I also mixed about 3/4 of the topping into the pasta and cheese and used the remaining mixture for the top. I only had about 6 c. total grated cheese (Asiago and medium cheddar) so I sprinkled grated parm on the top before putting the remaining topping on. This did take quite a while to prep--about 1-1/2 hrs. I measured out all of the ingredients first and made sure to let everything get to room temperature. I also combined a few steps by snipping the bacon into pieces before cooking and then I added the onion, peppers & garlic when the bacon was almost done. I removed this mix to paper towels and patted extra grease off. In the same pan (NOT a non-stick!) I did still add the 2 T. of butter before making the rue/sauce, making sure to scrape all of the bacony goodness when whisking. It's a fair amount of work but totally delicious! I am loving the cheddar/Asiago/Parmesean combo.

Sinfully decadent, like other reviewers have mentioned I doubled the topping but decreased the amount of cheese.  It took me approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes to get this on the table, a little longer than regular Mac n cheese but well worth it. I will be spending all day tomorrow at the gym to repent though ;)

I used 2 cups of Asiago, 2 cups of Sharp Cheddar, and 2 cups of Medium Cheddar. My family and I really enjoyed it. It did however, take forever to prepare- yes, it seemed like a lot of work! Don't know when I'll be up for making it again but when I do, I will double the bacon and bread crumbs.

Wow Wow Wow was this ever good! As another person has already said, definitely double the topping.  Next time I'll also increase the milk/flour mixture to make it creamier.  The cheese was a lot but I wouldn't reduce it at all. I didn't have quite the required amount of Asiago Cheese (about half) and no Vermont cheese.  I made up for both with a mixture of other hard cheeses I had on hand.  This is THE best Macaroni and cheese I've ever had. Thoroughly enjoyed by all who ate it for dinner this evening. Served it with a simple tomato salad- sliced tomatoes, crumbled Feta cheese and Italian salad dressing.

Made a half recipe  as there are only three of us.  Did the carmalaized onions in the crock pot so cut down on time to make the dish.  It was amazing...will make again as a whole recipe for Easter or when I have a large group.  EVERYONE loved it! I did double the topping as suggested and glad I did.

This was very tasty! The only problem is that it takes a LOT longer to both prep and cook than stated. I will probably never make this again due to the amount of work and time needed for it, but I WILL definitely make this topping for other Mac n Cheese recipes! Thanks!

We loved this recipe and the richness the flavours bring. However, I would double the topping recipe and mix it in the macaroni to let the wonderful flavours fill the entire dish. Top with a light dusting of panko crumbs.
This recipe far exceeds any restaurant style Mac 'n cheese we've had in a restaurant.
Bon Appetite!

This was very delicious, but I am not sure I would make it again due to how long the cooking process was. Not to mention how unhealthy it is with all the butter and bacon grease...

Amazing mac & cheese.  Made it 2x and the 1st was exactly as written and it was awesome.  The second time I did it with using a package of already cooked bacon (less messy), not as good as written but still yummy.  Also I cut back the asiago to 2 cups and added more sharp cheddar, I liked it that way better.

This dish was more complicated than I anticipated and took quite a bit of time to put together, but my husband said it was the best Mac-n-Cheese that he has ever tasted. That's the best compliment he has ever given me on anything that I've ever cooked (he is a Mac-n-cheese connoisseur). I probably will only make it on special occasions, but I am so happy to have it

So this recipie is amazing but, I changed some things.  Like others I doubled the topping.  I didn't use asiago because I don't like it.  I used a variety of pre-shredded cheeses I had (pepper jack, mozzerella, parmesan and "mexican style").  I also followed one reviewers advice and added a can of evaporated milk and it really upped the creaminess. I love this. My roomate and his whole family love it.  If you know your way around the kitchen, the prep time isn't too bad but still longer than stated. I had my roomate do dishes while I was cooking to avoid a giant mess afterward. He complained a little the first time.  He has since offered to help me make this anytime becase he can't get enough of it. Great recipie!!

Delicious! The best mac-n-cheese I ever ate for sure.  I agree the prep time was way off, it took a lot longer than 20 min, however it was well worth it.  A lot of ingredients but the flavors were great.  I have only made it once and followed the recipe exactly, I may end up trying it again but experimenting with less ingredients (especially in step 5).  All in all 5 stars, only because i cant give it more than 5!

A lot of dirty pans for an ok Mac and cheese. I just mixed the onion mixture with the Mac to blend the flavors more. Not sure if I would make again but it was ok. Sprinkled a little more panko with asiago on top.

The pasta and cheese combo is pretty basic. What makes this dish, as MANY others have noted, is the breadcrumb topping. I think next time I will make the same amount of pasta/cheese, but use two pans and make quadruple the topping. It is that good :D

I made this for Thanksgiving and my family enjoyed it.  I did some alterations based on the reviews and own personal preferences.  I doubled the topping recipe which worked out great.  I also added 8oz blue cheese for contrast to the cheddar and asiago.  My only complaint was it was a little dryer that I like my mac and cheese and would add a can of evaporated milk in addition to make it a little creamier.  Great overall, and look forward to making this again.

These were great.  Based on others' reviews, I cut the cheeses in half and it was still very cheesy.  I also used ziti noodles since that is what I had on hand.  My family is already begging me to make it again.

If you know someone that is a Mac n cheese snob (like me) feed them this! Awesome. Make sure you have a few hours to devote to making, as it involves several steps. I used a whole package of bacon and half the amount of cheese and it still turned out fantastic. Try this at least once, after tasting it you, will find out it's worth the effort.

oh, so so greasy! Grease from bacon, butter, cheese, not necessary people, it's just as good with less than half the fat!  I tried it both ways, the taste is even better when you aren't reminded how fattening it is with every drippy bite.  Topping should indeed be doubled, it's quite yummy, I love caramelized onions!

WOW, this was AWESOME.  Made it for Christmas and then again for a New Years party because it was so good.  I did double the toppings but that's the only change.  Guests said it was the best mac and cheese ever and I agree.  Definitely lots of work, but well worth it.

I loved this recipe! It does have a little longer prep time but it was absolutely worth it! I usually skip over recipes that have this long a list of ingredients too but don't let that scare you off as most of the ingredients I had on hand anyway! I disagree with those who said that there wasn't enough bacon topping. I thought it was perfect as is!

Great! The prep time is more than I like to do but then it seems they are always the best recipes! I am going to cut back on the the Asiago cheese next time, it was a little overpowering. My daughter's boyfriends begs her to make it but she says it takes to long!! I will make it at Christimas again so he can get it at least once a year. LOL.

My family of 7 loved this meal. Only one of my girls commented that the topping was too sweet. For the rest of the family it was delicious, not enough.

This was good and nice change from plain old mac & cheese.  Next time I'll use half the asiago as its pretty overpowering.

I may tweak the type of cheese used in the base but OMG. the topping was delicious. I used regular old bread crumbs instead of the panko and doubled the amount of bread crumbs like someone suggested. My fiance and his friend just gobbled it up, and it made a pretty large casserole. Definitely a keeper, I want to bring it to potlucks and it would be fantastic on a Thanksgiving buffet. Thankyou!
