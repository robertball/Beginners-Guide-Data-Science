Easy to make, and everyone enjoyed it.  Reminds me of chili the way my mother used to make in large volumes; always good to enjoy for a couple days after.

This was a great easy recipe.  My 16 year old made it for the family.  I doubled the tomatoes, added a can of Rotel and it was just enough for four hearty sized bowls.

I was in a hurry, and this recipe came up in my search. Outstanding! And it was unbelievably easy and quick to make.
I had some canned chicken breast, and I used kidney beans instead of pinto beans. Worked great.
I didn't have any chili seasoning mix, so I had to make one. I used this recipe, http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Chili-Seasoning-Mix-II/Detail.aspx, which was quite aromatic even before I added it to the skillet.
My wife liked this dish, which is saying something, and she said that our daughter, who has 3 girls, would like this recipe.
Five stars for this one!
