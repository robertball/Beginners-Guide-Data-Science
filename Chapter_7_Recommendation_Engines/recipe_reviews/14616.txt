This is a good recipe.  But i altered the recipe to my own liking.  First, instead of using can mushrooms, use fresh ones (do not worry about the liquid from the can mushrooms - it adds a horrible taste to the sauce!)  I used fresh garlic.  Instead of following the recipe by the book, use your own measurements for the sherry and cream of mushroom.  I like to add more sherry and one extra can of cream of mushroom, that way you have alot of sauce for the beef to cook in.  Fresh ground black pepper add an umph to the recipe.

This was really good.  I didn't let mine simmer for an hour though or all the sauce would have dried up.  About 30 mins was plenty for it.  I served it with rice.  Hubby loved it so it's a keeper.

I can only recommend this if you're going to use fresh mushrooms.  I used fresh mushrooms and red onions.  There is no way you can cook the  meat for an hour with the amount of liquid mentioned. I had no choice but to serve this alone because it was too dry for a topping.  The mixture had a great flavor, but the beef was tough as expected.  It was similar to stroganoff.  I served with mashed potatoes and french green beans.  This is worth trying if your have all the ingredients on hand.  If you want to serve over something you'll probably want to add something to thin it down.

I took the advice of other reviewers and altered this recipe a bit: 2 cans condensed cream of mushroom soup 1 cup of sherry 1/4 cup of water-in place of water from mushrooms (it tasted tinny to me; kinda like the can) Glad I changed it, there wouldn't have been nearly enough sauce for the recipe. The extra sherry gave the recipe a great flavor that my wife and kids loved! I'll make this one again with my substitutions and changes.

I thought this recipe was a great idea when i read it, but as I started putting it together, felt it needed a little more umph, if you will.  I substituted real (from the jar) minced garlic and fresh sliced mushrooms... then at the end of the cooking time, put in about 3/4 cup of fat free sour cream.  I think it made for a richer, even more elegant entree.

My husband loved this - it's nice and homey, so I wouldn't call it "elegant."  Here are my suggestions - when browning the beef, take care not to crowd the beef.  I did mine in two batches.  Also, don't stir the beef around while browning - just let the beef strips sit in the hot oil until very brown on one side.  Only then, flip to the other side.  This adds a nice brown color (and flavor!) to the sauce.  I used fresh garlic and no mushrooms as I didn't have any fresh on hand.  I deglazed the pan with the sherry before adding the mushroom soup.

I had left over rice and left over steak so I threw together this sauce and it was delicious! I love the sherry in this - it makes it so tasty. 5 stars all the way.

Absolutely fabulous. I prefer not to change up a recipe much if at all the first time I make it, since I'm just BOUND to mess something up. All I did to this one is add some pepper, omit the mushroom juice (ew... shrooms out of a jar just don't have flavourful .. waterstuff), and cook for a few minutes less.  Keep an eye on this if you want any liquid left! I've gotten requests for this dish quite a few more times since! Thank you!

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe. I didn't have sherry on hand so I substituted dry vermouth and it came out tasting excellent! I also used vermouth instead of the reserved liquid from the mushrooms. Also found that it cooked much faster than 1 hour - it was ready in about 30 minutes total.

I love this dish!  I have made it three times, and each time, it has come out absolutely wonderful! I never use canned mushrooms though, I just stick with the mushroom soup.  I dont have many mushroom lovers in my family.  The sherry adds wonderful flavor to the meat!

Loved it! I made a cream of mushroom soup substitute as I didn't have any, and also put in real garlic and mushrooms. This is one of my favorite recipes.

It was excellent. I also used fresh mushrooms and just added a little bit of water to replace the can juice. I went back for seconds and that rarely happens.

Wow! What a quick and easy meal. I cubed the meat and sauted it together with 1/2 a bell pepper and 1/2 an onion. This made a nice gravy that I seasoned up with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Put in the soup and sherry, simmer about an hour, served over white rice...My son and I both loved it.

We really liked this one, however I did make a few modifications:  I omitted the canned mushrooms (I have 2 kids who dislike mushrooms), and to replace the liquid from them, I added about 3/4 cup  lite (reduced-fat, NOT fat-free) sour cream instead, near the end of the cooking time.  I didn't have sherry but had a similar cooking wine (white) I used instead.   I also added about 2 tsp. of minced garlic to the meat/onion mixture as it cooked, instead of using garlic powder in the soup/mixture.   VERY yummy!  I love how VERY quick and easy this recipe is, and uses stuff I pretty-much always have on hand.   I used my rice-cooker to make Jasmine rice, which made  this recipe even easier.

Ten year old picky daughter loved it.  I think it needed something else. Not sure what though.  Like others suggested, I used fresh mushrooms and fresh garlic.  I will make this again but keep tweaking it.

This tasted good, but I listened to the other reviews and only let it simmer for 30 minutes.  My Husband and I both liked it, but felt it could use some sort of herb thrown in for a kick...maybe tarragon..I will play with this recipe, it's a tasty base!

This is good, but by no means "elegant."  It's strips of round steak in a brown sauce over rice.  I used fresh garlic and mushrooms.  I also didn't have any sherry I googled to see what  could use to replace it.  I used mostly dry vermouth, with about a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar.  It could have used more of the balsamic or something to give it more of a kick or tartness.  Definitely a great starter recipe, but anyone whose cooked for awhile will have their preferences on what to add or how to  modify.

This was quite good and a great way to use round steak.  My husband liked it and I will make it again.  I used 2 T Worcestershire,  2 t garlic, 1+ cup sherry,  and 2T olive oil for the marinade.  I threw in some Italian Seasoning during the marinade with real garlic.  I marinaded about 3 hours because I had the time.  I did use 1 can cream of mushroom soup.  I did not use the liquid in the mushroom can (I drained it) and I didn't need it.  If I were to add water I would mix 1/2 c beef broth in it but with the extra sherry I added, I had enough liquid.  I simmered low for 45 min. and then added frozen peas for an additional last 5 min.  (50 min. total cook time.)  
Although it was very good and I did add an onion, next time I might add a little onion soup mix for additional flavor. We used rice but also would be good with fettucine noodles or like a stroganoff.

Not bad, nothing great either, but wouldn't call this 'elegant'.   Gets points for an easy weeknight meal.  Even with added herbs, still tastes like what it is...round steak and canned soup.

I particularly liked this recipe and so did my kids. The gravy came our good and went well over the rice. I didn't use mushrooms and only 1/4c of sherry and it came out good. I used top sirloin also. I think I will have mashed potatoes and a veggie next time.

It was good, but I probably won't make it again.  Nothing really exciting, (or elegant) but we all ate it and no major complaints. In the grand scheme of great meals this just didn't measure up.

Quite disappointed!  I no longer eat beef, but still prepare it for my family, and my husband ate it, but requested that I never make it again.  When trying the sauce I realized why.  VERY BAD FLAVOR!

I thought this was good but no one else liked it. Maybe over noodles they would have liked it better but I probably won't try it again.

I made one change, added some Worcestershire to the beef.
I used my rock dutch oven so the fluids did not escape and cooked it for an hour and a half. Yumm! very tender meat.

I read the reviews about it being tough and not enough sauce before I made it, so I did a few alterations and my family loved it. I added 1/2 cup of beef broth and a tablespoon of butter. I let it simmer for about 45mins on REALLY LOW heat. I omitted adding the mushrooms. I'd give it 5 stars, but I don't eat meat so I have no idea what it tastes like. ??

This was fantastic and I never would have thought of it. Instead of just boiling the rice I sauté d onions and garlic in olive oil in a large pot, added in rice and a little more olive oil and then sautéd it all until the rice got that nice nutty smell. Then added in water and cooked as usual. Didn't have round steak but used some leftover sirloin and instead of garlic salt I used freshly minced. Had no sherry so substituted sweet Walter red and mixed in a bit of onion soup mix. Tasted great.

great recipe! I recommend doubling the cream of mushroom soup and use 1/2 cup of sherry to deglaze the pan after browning the meat. My family has been making this for years and has always been one of my favorite meals.

Very tasty. Since I was trying to stretch this meal and listened to comments about the limited amount of sauce, I added 1 1/2 cups of beef broth at the same time as the other sauce ingredients, plus an extra helping of fresh mushrooms. Next time I will cut down a little on the garlic salt and use fresh garlic instead since the broth added plenty of saltiness. Cooked everything about 45 minutes, and that was enough time to tenderize the meat.

Have been preparing this dish for 25 years.  I use thick sliced onion with whole fresh mushrooms. Presentation has more to offer with sliced onions. My guests love it.

This was pretty good. A word of advice, however...I don't like the taste of sherry, so I substituted that 1/2 cup of liquid and the 1/2 cup of liquid in the mushrooms with wine. It was just as I was pouring the RED wine into the mushroom soup that I realized this was a poor choice, at least as far as the color, which was an unfortunate shade of dark pink, rather like Pepto Bismol. Not attractive, but tasty all the same!
