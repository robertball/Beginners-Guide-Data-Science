This was not the most flavorful creamed spinach recipe. If I did it again, I would add more salt

It was easy to make and really good, I did add more garlic and onion powder though but definitely a keeper! Went great with our Rosemary garlic pork chops

Way too salty for us.  Next time, I think I will substitute cream of mushroom soup, and skip the salt completely.

I followed the recipe but my add ins were: a little heavy whipping cream garlic a little cayenne pepper some chunks of Gouda cheese shallots instead of onions or onion powder and a dash of Greek seasoning to top it off. Worked amazingly.

Was really good. I don't feel the need to follow this long lasting fad of adding garlic to everything so I didn't add that. Also to give it some more flavor I added shredded gruyere cheese and a little extra butter.
