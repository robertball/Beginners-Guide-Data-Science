Delicious and easy to make.  Followed recipe as written.  There are a few steps, but simple ones.  A friend brought these to work and everyone loved them.  I'm making them for the first time today.

I brought these to work and received many recipe requests and raves.  They were delicious!  Only tweaks I made were to cut the recipe in half and make in an 8x8 dish and to use low-fat cream cheese and low sugar cherry pie filling.  This was delicious & a crowd pleaser!

These bars are very easy to make and come out fantastic! I made them for a dinner party and everyone loved them. I didn't have almonds so I used pecans and it turned out just great that way too. I can foresee making a blueberry or Apple variation in the future.

This turned out to be a great Christmas Day dessert. Easy to make and very flavorful. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the "streusel" crust and topping. I would make this again but just do a graham cracker crust and skip the cookie topping. Maybe an extra can of cherries too :)

These did not turn out well for me at all. I greased the pan well and the bottom still absolutely glued itself to it to the point of not getting any of it with the cheesecake. The cheesecake itself has no flavor and there's not enough cherry on top to make up for it. Will not make again.

I love anything with marshino cheeries.  This was a little time consuming but well worth the effort.

So delicious! Easy to make and pretty for a holiday party. The only thing I "tweaked" was to add an extra 1/2 tsp. almond extract because I love that flavor. Also, mine was done at 35 minutes. I will definitely make again!
