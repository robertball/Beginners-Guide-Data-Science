Wow! This is a great recipe. We made this last night served on some lettuce wraps which makes for a great presentation. This tasted better than most you can find in many restaurants we've been.  We didn't have shrimp paste so left this ingredient out and it still tastes great.

This is exquisite no matter how many times I alter it. I have to say, although galangal sounds exotic enough to not be found easy through most groceries store, it is definitely worth getting. It is so aromatic and adds so much flavor to the larb! I would have to say the first time, allowing all of the juices to evaporate in the 3rd step made the chicken too dry. The second time, as soon as i finished seasoning the ground chicken with the shrimp paste, fish sauce, and sugar (and crab paste just because i was curious), I added the lime juice, mint, and basil right away. The 2nd time turned out alot juicier and my whole laotian house was happy. You can't mess this recipe up! Authentic and delicious! Thanks Nana!

I love this recipe!! I have been searching for a similar dish laab and have to say I like this one so much better.  It is wonderful on top of lettuce, or wrapped in lettuce.  I have made it with the ginger/lime and it was wonderful but have to say ginger was missed when I did not have it.  This recipe is so good, I will find the galangal and buy lots of it because I could eat this a few times a week.  I did not use the shrimp paste, and can't say I missed it, delicious.  Thank you for sharing!

Super star recipe~Perfectly delicious!  The ingredients are simple; the flavor is authentic, intense and spicy-hot!  Really enjoyed making this salad at home and it's such a pretty presentation.  I serve it with basil and mint leaves, squeeze of lime and wrap the chicken with the green cabbage. Thanks Baking Nana!

My sister in law is from Thailand and makes this recipe. She makes it with ground pork, chicken or lamb. She did not use shrimp sauce or galangal. You can also buy already ground rice at most asian markets and then you just brown it up. If you can get thai peppers, that makes a difference. Once the chicken, pork, lamb is cooked, you add the rice, thai peppers, shallots, green onion, fish sauce, lime juice to taste and cilantro. We always serve with cabbage leaves or over rice. It is sooo good and really easy to make. Also good served cold.

I'll have to defer to our Laotian friends as to this dish's authenticity, but holy mackerel, it was good! I upped the chili peppers a bit since I'm an insatiable chili fiend, but it had that perfect blend of hot/sweet/sour/salty/aromatic that I've come to associate with Southeast Asian food. And even with all the flavors, the fresh herbal quality really shone. I ate it mixed with leaf lettuce over rice with cucumber spears on the side and I can honestly say that I could eat this every day and never tire of it. (Galangal isn't available in my area, so I substituted half the amount of ginger and a quarter the amount of fennel seed since to me, galangal has vague licorice notes.)

I skipped the shrimp paste (too smelly for me!) and the rice (fewer carbs!), and served it lettuce-wrap style with crunchy Napa cabbage leaves. Delish! Even Mr. Nicholio liked it. Thanks, Baking Nana!

This dish was delicious! My daughter, who lived in Laos for a few months, said that next time we will use less meat and chop it instead of grinding it. Also, we will up the mint and basil. 
Thank you for posting this!

This is good. Definitely get rice flour beforehand though because I had a hard time getting it into a fine enough powder. I also had to leave out shrimp paste, because I could not find it. Thanks.

Will make it again.. easy recipe to make, flavours fantastic.. I didn't have fresh galangal but had some powered so used that. I didn't have basil, but used Thai basil, its adds an aniseed hint.

I made it with pork because I couldn't find ground chicken, and it was great.. Got compliments. You need to adjust the chilis to your tolerance...and maybe your guests.

Exquisite! I can't believe how good this is. The fresh, crisp flavors just bounce at you, then the spicy peppers kick in. Wow. The rice adds a dimension to the texture which is very nice. I had to leave out the shrimp paste and fish sauce due to allergies, so I subbed fermented bean paste and vegan/gluten free "seafood" sauce (a mix of tamari, fermented bean paste and other flavors). I served this inside romaine and radicchio leaves. The romaine added a nice sweetness whereas, the radicchio gave it a nice bitter taste that went very well with the lime/mint/basil flavor. Thank you for for the lovely recipe.

Asian markets do sell small packages of toasted rice flour, which is much easier than toasting and grinding your own rice.  I also keep galangal in the freezer to have on hand.   This is one of our favorite summer time meals.

This was a good base version of a Thai Larb, we have made for years. We used bone in chicken thighs, which worked fine after a tedious deboning. We also did not add Basil, I just am not a fan of the taste mixed with Mint. It was a perfect match for what we usually pay to order. Using a Red Serrano and Red crushed pepper to increase the spice.
