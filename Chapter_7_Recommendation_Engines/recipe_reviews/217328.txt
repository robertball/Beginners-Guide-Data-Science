Another excellent recipe! The only change I made was to use chicken breasts.

This recipe is my represents my first success at cooking Indian food at home. I followed the recipe exactly as it's listed, but I marinated the chicken for two days.  The flavor was exceptional.  However, there is not as much sauce as you might expect from a curry dish, so I will try and double the sauce next time.

I followed the recipe exactly except I used boneless skinless chicken thighs and cooked 10 minutes longer and it was so delicious. The potatoes were so creamy inside. The chicken cut with a fork. The house smelled so great my adult kids were going crazy for a taste and everyone loved it!

The first time I've had an Indian curry turn out like something I'd get in a restaurant. Soooo good!
 I used boneless skinless chicken thighs (and will continue to make it with them...YUM), and added 1/2 of a small tin of tomato paste.
 Next time I will use half the amount of oil and add the potato chunks to the curry when I add the marinade, skipping the separate frying of potatoes to save some calories.

Great flavor! Definitely go to an Indian Market and pick up dried curry leaves. SO DELICIOUS
