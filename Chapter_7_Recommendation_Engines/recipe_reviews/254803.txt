Definitely a cake to try as it has super potential. I would suggest lowering the temperature, though. I baked for 25 minutes at 175Â°C and it almost burned the top but the bottom was soggy. I used a 9" round cake pan as described in the notes. So, low and slow may be the key to a uniform doneness. I used coconut oil for vegetable oil and added some dark chocolate chips on top. Thank you for the recipe.

I made this because I needed a gluten free dessert on short notice, and I had all the ingredients.  I didn't cook the bananas, but instead used very ripe ones, and mashed them with the oil and honey.  I thru in a handful of semi-sweet chips.  Baked it at 350 for 30 minutes, and while it looked done, I kept an eye on it for another 10 to see if it would pull from the edges, which it began to do.  I took it out of the oven, let it sit for 5 minutes, ran a knife around the edges to pull away.  It was real spongy.  We ate it a few hours later, and it was quite good.  A bit mushy the next day.  I'd make it again if I was in the same pinch!

I followed the recipe as directed. the bananas had too much liquid. I baked the cake for 40 minutes and it was still mush. the taste was okay, but the texture was awful. I may try again, but not cook the bananas first.
