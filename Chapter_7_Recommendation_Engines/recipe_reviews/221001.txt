This was a great recipe.  My husband doesnt usually like this dish, but he loved this recipe.  He really liked the 'mushy' potaotes in it.  i loved how easy and quick it was. And the potatoes were done! I did add 1/2 cup of diced onion instead of the onion powder. Other than that it was perfect! I highly recommend this dish.

There are so many words that could describe this:  rich, cheesy, yummy, sinful.  It’s like cheesy, chunky mashed potatoes.  The only flaw I found with the recipe was the serving size.  I think of scalloped potatoes as a main dish and this only made 8 small servings consistent with a side dish.  I used med. large potatoes and when spread in the 9 x 13 pan, it was barely ¼” thick.

I liked it. I did change up a bit. I used two cloves of garlic and an eighth of an onion and used a hand blender to combine them 1/2 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of melted butter and 1/4 cup of Greek yogurt (in place of the sour cream). Then I added the mixture to half of the potatoes and used the hand blender on them. Instead of mixing in the other half of the potatoes, I lined the bottom of the pan with them, covered them with half the mixture, added the diced ham, covered the top with the remainder of the creamed potatoes and then cheese to cover it all. I will try this recipe again, for sure.

Very good!!  I chopped one medium onion and cooked it in the 1/4 cup butter until translucent instead of dried onion powder.  I also added a teaspoon of ground mustard powder and a few dashes of dried dill.  The ham I used was slightly sweet and it was the perfect combination of flavors.  We ate three servings each on Christmas Eve even though we weren't hungry anymore, it was that good!  Tis' the season for glutany after all! :). I also increased the cheddar cheese to 1 1/2 cups.

I used two russet potatoes for the mashed part and four red potatoes for the sliced part. I used the same amount of sour cream but backed off on the milk and used just enough to make the mashed part spreadable (not even 1/4 cup). The red potatoes give more texture, while the russets give more binding power. The overall taste was superior. I used 1/2 teaspoon each of the onion and garlic powders and the sharpest cheddar cheese I could find. The flavors exploded. Gonna do this one again!

This recipe is delicious!!!!! I got a lot of complements from this dish! Every one of my guests loved it, as did I. I cannot believe that this dish has so little reviews. I am going to be spreading this around!

The only thing I did to alter the recipe was not adding the salt (I figured the ham had enough on its own).

This is a very flavorful recipe!  I made a few substitutions with what I had on hand (cottage cheese in place of sour cream & a combination of Monterrey Jack & sharp cheddar cheese in place of cheddar).  I also omitted the ham, as I am serving this with a pork loin.  Thank you so much for sharing!

Cottage cheese substitute for sour cream: 1 C. cottage cheese blended with 2 tsp lemon juice & enough milk to blend easily

Too much ham. Have had other potato and ham scallop dishes much better than this. In the other recipes potatoes were thinly sliced and not precooked before putting in oven, and fresh onions were used.

The boiling time is too long as written.  I boiled mine for 15 minutes, and it was too long.  Next time I will boil them for 10 minutes.  I subbed ranch dressing for part of the milk, and it gave it a lovely flavor.  My family gobbled this up.  Next time I will probably make two pans for the seven of us, and enjoy the leftovers for lunch the next day!

Used plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream, 2% cheese, and added green pepper and onion (because that's what my family likes). I'll definitely be making this again

Double yum!  I used red potatoes.  The only thing I will do differently next time is remove the half of the potatoes that stay sliced 5 minutes earlier from the water.   It was hard to mix everything up at the end and keep those slices intact.

These were very good.  I either cut my potatoes too thin or cooked them a little too long.  They all ended up pretty much like mashed potatoes.  Still, this was a tasty meal on a cool, early Fall evening.

Delicious and absolutely hit the spot! I made a few changes based on what I had and others' reviews: I used about 2.5 cups of diced ham (weighed about 10oz) and 5 medium baking potatoes which brought the number of servings down to about 6+ (I adjusted down the milk, sour cream, etc as well). I added sauted mushrooms and onions to the casserole and topped everything with cooked and crumbled bacon and panko crumbs lightly sprayed with Olive Oil. 
I boiled the potatoes for 10-12 minutes, then removed half, then continued to boil the remaining potatoes another 5 minutes or so. I baked it about 20 minutes and finished with about 3 minutes under the broiler. Comfort food for sure! Served with roasted broccoli.

I am always looking for tasty ways to use leftover ham. This is really good. I am lazy, so I did not mash 1/2 as suggested. I used 1/2 cup of milk, 1/4 cup of yogurt, and sautéed a little onion and garlic in the butter (as suggested in another review). I also used a mix of cheddar and jack cheeses, just because I was short on cheddar and wanted a lot more cheese. I layered half the potatoes, onion, milk mixture and cheeses ending with cheese. It is really yummy and my most picky eater loved it!

My family liked this. Per suggestion, I topped it with Panko Bread crumbs and drizzled butter over it, broiling for the last 2 minutes. That added a nice contrast to the creamy potatoes. I also added extra cheese.

Great recipe!  I used red and russet potatoes.  I cut back on the butter slightly adding a little olive oil and sautéed half a chopped onion, which I added to the potatoes, milk and sour cream prior to mashing.  Also, I used a can of Campbell's cheddar cheese, which added great flavor!  I will definitely make these again.

supper easy and delicious, I think it is the best scalloped and potatoes and ham I have every made, I only used about 1/3 of the potatoes and put them in a blender for the sauce part, and I also use fat-free 1/2 and 1/2 to replace the milk and sour cream, tasted great with less calories

Spot-on recipe that's comfort food personified. I did carmelize onions instead of powder (the sweetness worked well with the ham, I thought.) Also, cook the potatoes as directed. I tried pulling the sliced ones at 15 minutes, and they still were too firm after baking.  Stick to the recipe for great results.

I couldn’t even wait to taste this before I took the picture. It is soooo good!!! The only thing I did different was add some finely chopped Swiss chard and instead of using powdered onion and garlic, I sautéed chopped onion and minced garlic before adding to potato mixture. This is a recipe I will be making often!!!

Good! I like how flexible this recipe is.  Used this but added 2 - 10 oz bags of peas/carrots in order to make it more of a one dish for breakfasts throughout the week.  Also added a bit of dill and some Ms. Dash seasoning.  Super forgiving and open to customization.  I'll make this again.

This was delicious!! I made this for Sunday dinner and the next day my hubby asked me where the leftovers were for his lunch. He was disappointed when I had to tell him there were no leftovers. We had eaten it all!  The only changes I made is I added more of the garlic and onion powder (1 tsp each) and I added 1 tsp of dry mustard powder. I also made this for the family reunion and it didn't take long to disappear.

This is just like eating mashed potatoes with ham. Going to make it into soup today. Too thick. Not enough creaminess.

Was trying to.find ideas for the leftover ham from Thanksgiving. This recipe was easy and very tasty.  Very kid friendly as it has no "foreign objects" aka vegetables. (I have a pic key eater.)

My fiancé and I both don't like scalloped potatoes and ham, but I had a little ham in the fridge and about 8 potatoes left to eat so I said why not! I liked doing the mashed potatoes instead of slices of potatoes!!!

I mashed all my potatoes and diced my ham. I also cooked 8 striped of bacon while the potatoes were boiling and took my diced ham and threw it in with the bacon to brown the edges of the ham; it gives the ham and extra taste too! I mixed the ham and mashed potatoes together then put it in the dish with cheese on top and cut up my bacon and sprinkled it on top! Muah! It was delicious!

Savory flavors pull together to make a delicious main dish or side....reminds me of the Pioneer Woman's twice baked potato recipe but a lot easier to pull together. Delicious!!

Totally different than any other scalloped potatoes I have ever made.  It is simple. Cooks quickly as taters are boiled.  We loved it! Added a bunch of leftover baked ham and didn't make any changes except doubled it to fill a 9 X 13 full. And we did use fresh dug Red Pontiac taters with skins on. Thanks for sharing!

I really liked this recipe.  I made it the day after Christmas with the leftover ham.  Great taste.  I paired it up with some mixed vegetables and it was a great meal, no complaints from anyone!

A good selection to use up some leftover ham I found in the freezer.  I made a half batch and baked it in the toaster oven.  The one change I made was adding a 1/2 cup of chopped onion to the potatoes as they boiled.  Mixed this up in the morning and baked in the evening.  This was served with cottage cheese, pan seared green beans and orange slices.

We really liked this dish!  We had it as a main dish with some fresh bread and a salad, but would also be a good side without the ham!

I made a few changes, but the basic recipe still would rate the five stars I believe. 
This was to be served with ham, so I dropped that. I had some heavy cream that needed using, so that went instead of the milk, and I misread, so the full amount of cheese went in, and then the same amount on top.
Great, tasty recipe, my family all loved it.

I was looking for a scalloped potatoes recipe similar to the old fashioned ones that my Grandparents used to make.  I did not find that in this recipe.  None the less, this dish was a treat to the taste buds.  The texture of this recipe is more like mashed potatoes with ham.  Creamy, cheesy, delicious!  I didn't have any garlic powder or onion powder so those were left out.  This dish was a big hit in my house.

With the changes I made, my family loved this. I liked it OK. What I did differently: 1/2 cup of cheese blended with the mashed potato mixture; 1/2 sauteed onion added; 3 cloves garlic added. What I'd change in the future -- try to figure out how the make the mashed mixture so the texture's not so gluey!

I'd give this receipe a "Great thumbs up"! Used what I had, cheesewhiz instead of cheddar and some quesadilla cheese on top. Put it in my favorites. Glad to see recent reviews on this receipe.
