So moist and delicious!  My husband has been asking for a doberge cake ever since we lived in New Orleans 10 years ago.  I tried one once that was complicated and didn't turn out well.  This was easy and perfect for his birthday.

This was really good. Very sweet. I only made 2 layers then split each layer so ended up with a 4 layer cake. Pure laziness on part since it was late and I didn't want to wait for 5 cakes to bake and cool. I thought the frosting was a little to sweet so I would cut the sugar in that. I think combined with the pudding and frosting it just seemed like a bit to much sweetness. Also I used heavy cream in place of the milk. Think I probably used about 3 T of milk. It was very easy to prepare but I think I'll look for this recipe with everything made from scratch. But for an easy and quick cake this was pretty good. Thanks for the recipe!

I make cakes for a living, and I wasn't to thrilled with the end result. 1st. The recipe all in it's different components were great. However, this cake is soo light, it easily crumbled as I added the frosting. The cakes stacked 5 high, didn't stay put either, as it jiggled while frosting the cakes. It would have been better dividing 2 cakes in half and stacking then stacking all 5 whole cakes. The cakes were soo tender, that when I cut one slice out and placed on a serving plate, I was immediately dealt with the dilemma of catching the rest of the cake, for it split into 2 more pieces and fell off the cake plate I had it on. And I do mean, catching the cake, it exploded everywhere. My husband had to help me get the cake on other plates because I had my hand on one side of the cake holding it up. The frosting was quite delish but I ended up adding over 3 TBSP of milk to thin it. Don't think I'd make this again. I'll make the frosting again for sure. Just not this particular cake recipe. Sorry.

An easy and delicious cake that impressed everyone!  The icing is the best I ever tasted and so easy to spread but I had to double the recipe to cover the top and sides.  Highly recommended!

This was pretty good. Kinda sweet for my liking and very light texture. Could probably use a few tweaks but i'm not really a baker so I'm not sure how to change it. Funny story behind how I even found this recipe: I was at a local brewery and one of their stouts had tasting notes listed as  "caramel and dobash cake". I had to look up what a dobash cake was, and here we are!
