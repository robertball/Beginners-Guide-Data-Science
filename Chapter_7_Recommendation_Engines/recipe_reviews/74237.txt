I made a couple of minor alterations to the recipe. Used black beans and added a bit of minced garlic. I liked the flavor a lot, but the texture was a bit too soft. I think next time I may add in some ground up oatmeal to give this a bit more firmness or else try with one less egg white.  I did make this again and added a little ground up oatmeal. It was just what it needed.

Okay, I have never made my own veggie burgers from scratch till now and I would totally recommend these Brocco Burgers to other vegetarians!

It was easy, quick and fun!

This turned out to be a lot more work than I anticipated. I really didn't care for the burgers much. Sometimes it's a matter of perspective, as my vegetarian friend thought they were pretty good. She took the leftovers home. Either she liked it, or she was being polite. If I were going on my tastes alone, I would have given this 1 star (or 1/2, if that were available). I do think that there is some potential here. My recommendation would be to make sure that your patties are flat, otherwise, they'll end up mushy in the middle. Also, I'd probably change the spices a bit, but I have no recommendations.

Taking cues from the PP, I used black beans, used one egg white, and also added some breadcrumbs - 1/4C or so.  They were good.

The taste was ok but it certainly needed something to firm it up a little. Average recipe which needs some tinkering.
