The key to really good chicana is mixing the beef in flour before you saute. This is a pretty authentic recipe but you need to thicken sauce like a gravy or stew

SO easy & SO good. I used sirloin tips and the meat was so tender.  Used a whole red pepper and added a dash of cayenne. Instead of water I added a can of diced tomatoes with jalepenos, minus some of the liquid. Served over white rice with a beef boullion added.  Thanks for the great recipe!  We will use again & again.

Good, easy recipe when you don't have much time to prepare. I added a bay leaf and would skip the water, as it gets too runny. Served over rice with corn tortillas. Yum

I usually don't rate recipes, but this was very good!  I served it over rice and added shredded cheese and sour cream, excellent!  What a simple way to make fajitas!  Next time I will 1/2 the water and double the chili powder.  Maybe I'll try with chicken, too.  Thanks!!

This was great with a few minor changes. I completely omitted the water, used 8 oz of tomato sauce and 8 oz of diced tomoatoes along with some home canned banana peppers. It was still pretty runny so I removed the lid for the last 15 minutes which helped with the consistency. Excellent flavor!! Can't wait to have the leftovers of tortillias (I served it over Mexican Rice I)

I gave this five stars because my husband really liked this alot.  I think it was missing something but I am not really sure what that would be.  I surved it with spanish rice and a salid.  I added only half the water because I was warned and I was glad I did.  I will make this again it was very nice and everyone seemed to like it alot.

I used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the tomato sauce, and didn't add any water.  I thickened with cornstarch after simmering for 45 minutes and served on tortillas.  GREAT flavor and reheated well.

This turned out pretty good. Like others brought up, it was really liquidy. I didn't even add any water and there were still lots of juices. I added mushrooms and a can of garlic onion petite cut diced tomatoes to mine. We served our in tortillas and the juices were great to sop up with the tortilla.

This was okay, I made a few additions to give it some flavor.  I added a few peppers in there and I also didnt like it chunky and so I threw the sauce into the blender and made it smooth.  Then served it with rice.  Not sure I will make this again.

Very good.  Easy too, just get in on the stove and let it cook. We used a whole onion/green pepper, and omitted the water.  Also added salt/pepper to taste at the end. (Had a 1/2 can of mild chiles in the frig, and wanted to use that up too, so I tossed them in there.)

I tried doing about 3 different things with this.  First, if something is liquidly like this, I will use the extra as the liquid to make rice with.  So I served it over rice.  I also tried it in a tortilla, filling one half with just the meat mixture and the other half mixed with the rice.  I thought it best plain in the tortilla.  However, I still thought something seemed missing and didn't take a particular fancy to this.  It would also be *very* nice if the ingredients were listed in the order used.

This recipe is  pretty good, but I wish I had read the other reviews before making it. I would have definitely reduced the amount of water in it; it came out way too juicy. It is very tasty, though, and I'll definitely make it again.

I liked this recipe--it tasted like a chili recipe.  I added some sauteed, fresh mushrooms to enhance the mix.  I, too, thought it was a bit watery, so I will omit the water next time, and perhaps melt some shredded cheese on the top before serving.  Thanks for the recipe.

Tasty! I used a fresh diced tomato and skipped the tomato sauce and water. I drained the mixture before serving it on tortillas with shredded cheese. We'll definitely be having this again!

Very good and easy recipe. I'll make it again. I followed some advises and used only half the water (it was juicy enough)and served with flour tortillas. Next time i'll try adding other ingredients - tomatoes, mushrooms, different meat, etc. That's a beauty of this recipe - you can use lots of variations.

The recipe was fine, though not quite what I expected. If I decide to build it again I would defenitly increase the chili powder and garlic for a bolder flavor.

I first had this dish when visiting an old friend who grew up in Mexico.  She serves it with Spanish rice and fresh tortillas.  It's so good! I add about half a cup of chopped celery and leave out the cup of water.  It's also good as a taco or burrito filling.

I liked this recipe even if I did change it a little. I added a 10oz can of diced tomatoes with gr chillis and about 1/3 cup of water just to rinse out the tomatoe sauce can and also used some Shillings Mexican spice.  Turned out real good.

Great.  Definitely omit the water...I only added about 1/3 cup and it was still a little runny.  Make sure to season well with spices, salt, and fresh pepper.  I might add a can of diced tomatoes, as well, next time.  Serve over saffron rice for added flavor!

Wonderful recipe and my hubby LOVED it!!! I just made a few changes to it like instead of bell peppers, I used jalepenos and thickened the juice. Thanks for your recipe.

Fixed this exactly as listed, then used it with the "refried beans without the refry" recipe from this site and made big burritos for dinner. Wonderful. I will be making this again!!

The first time I made this, I didnt review this, but I remember loving it. I made it again tonight and was a little disappointed. Im not sure what I did different but it just didnt come out the same, and this time was way too wet, I even omitted the water. Ill be making this again once I figure out where I went wrong.

mmm this was very tasty, followed the recipe almost exactly. Only thing I did different is take the advice of another person and coated the meat in flour and slightly browned it before following the directions to the T afterwards.  I also used a can of diced tomatoes instead of the water.  We ate it like a stew and dipped tortillas in it.  Scrumptious!

We liked this a lot!  It was only family-fare, but simple and tasty.  I left out the water per recommendation and used half chili powder and half chipotle chili pepper (seasoning).  Mmmm.

The taste was good, but the sauce was a little too liquid. I wish I had read through all the reviews first.  I ended up adding come cherry tomatoes and chili peppers at the end to make it a tad thicker.

REALLY tasty!  I browned everything before I put in the tomato sauce and I only used 1/2 the water.  I also added a little bit of salt.  This would be easy to do in the crock pot, too.

Really delicious!  It was just spicy enough for my kids, even though I used only 1 tsp of chile powder.  I think 1 tbsp would be too much for children.

The only thing keeping this from being a five-star recipe is that it does come out a bit soupy. But it's very tasty and something I will probably make again. I followed other reviewers' comments and didn't add much water, using partially drained diced tomatoes. But I ended up having to add a bit of water at the end to cut the spicyness (that's a lot of cumin!). I also added a can of black beans which really went well in this dish. It works well over rice but I don't think it would work well in tortillas, at least not this wet. But still a keeper.

The whole family loved this recipe!  I took the advice of others and didn't add the water.  Instead I used a can of diced tomatoes & chiles along with the tomato sauce.  Perfect!

This is the best & so easy.  I followed the recipe exactly except I used beef stew meat.  I cooked it forever (hours) and when meat was good & falling apart took off the lid & simmered down the sauce then added the tiniest bit of salt.  My daughter loved it over rice, but I scarfed it down in tortillas.  That was last week, I'm making it again tonight since my hubby wasn't home & we loved it so much he didn't get any leftovers.  Tonight he'll get some!

While this was very easy to make, my husband and I both thought it was quite bland. Unfortunately, I didn't read any reviews before making it and put in the whole cup of water. It was much too liquidy. The meat was good and the rice, but we didn't care much for the rest. Probably won't make it again.

This was incredibly easy to prepare and the result was a great tasting meal.  I added a little bit of brown sugar and used pork cubes which I had in the freezer instead of the round steak.  The next time, I may use a little less water, but still it was great.  This would be a great recipe for an inexperienced cook as it requires only minimal effort but gives good results.

I’m going to make changes as the previous comments suggested...
I’ll try adding a bay leaf.  Instead of water (no water) add a drained 14.5 oz can of diced tomatoes with jalapeños .  Add a dash of cayenne pepper and a beef bouillon cube.

My family can't handle a lot of heat so I only used 1 teaspoon of ancho chili powder. I added celery and carrots one can  rotel, one can chopped tomatoes and half cup of red wine to deglaze the pot I browned the meat in. I used my crock pot on low for 6 hours and served over rice with avocado

it came out great. and about the sauce being too runny. well i prefer it that way because i served it over rice.
