Really good recipe! We don't eat Paleo, so I just used regular mayo. I ended up using an extra chipotle pepper and it wasn't that spicy. Don't be afraid of the peppers! Easy to make and the flavors just come alive the longer you let it sit. I served this with the Grain Free Chicken Tenders from this site. Yum!

My family and I loved this dip!!! Made it for dinner tonight with chicken stripes and needed up using it as a dip also for our steamed veggies and it was incredible!! Great taste and not too spicy. I will be keeping this in my frig at all time.

Excellent sauce! I used Duke's mayo (what's a paleo ?!), and made the sauce according to directions thereafter.  I thought 2 chiles in adobe was spicy - luckily we like the heat.  If I were to make this for company, however, I would use 1 1/2 chiles.  The sauce was delicious paired with Chicken Diablo which I bought already made from Central Market.  The sauce competed with the chicken a bit, but Hubs ate every morsel.

This was SO good! Added a little honey for balance and used regular mayo. Was amazing!

Our go-to for fish taco sauce but really good for anything honestly!! We don't eat paleo so regular mayo is just fine. Otherwise I make exactly as is. YUM! Perfect way to turn a simple dinner into a delicious masterpiece :p

This sauce tastes so good we are having it on fish tacos. I added about Tablespoon of sour cream to cut a little of the spice. Other than that I wouldn't  change a thing

Fantastic!  Just having it with plain grilled tofu and some veggies for dipping.  Husband is loving it over grilled chicken.
