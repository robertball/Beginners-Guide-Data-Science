I would call this a savory bread pudding and not a quiche.   Do yourself a favor and soak the egg mixture  with the bread for longer than 1-2 minutes.    Also- recommend a water bath to keep it nice and moist in the oven.

Yum! Used ham instead of bacon and substituted garlic powder for onion. Tried it on guests and one of them said it was the best quiche ever!

Family thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful recipe!  I roughly added a tablespoon of organic crushed rosemary for two more quiches.  All disappeared quickly with high compliments!  Thank you!

The croissant quiche is excellent. I added chopped tomato & substituted diced orange bell pepper for onion.  Used TraderJoe’s caramelized onion cheddar cheese. My family loved it. This recipe would lend itself to endless variations.

I definitely agree that this is a savory bread pudding. I liked enough to make again, but I definitely need to play with it a little. It was a little bland and could use more cheese and/or some additional seasonings.

This was so delicious it's hard to not binge on it. When I make it again I plan to double the spinach bcs once wilted it isn't enough for me. I added some dried basil to bring up the flavor. In the future I would use a variety of cheeses, Like 3 different ones. Sharp chedder, Smoked Gouda or some Havarti along with the Monetary Jack. This is keeper!

Got great cheers at our Family Easter dinner. I don't pre-cook my greens  though. I myself am gonna have to try it again because the whole quiche was gone by the time I got there.

Awesome ...used Publix braided garlic & Italian seasoned crusty bread, added another 4 oz of Monterey cheese, added 14 oz thawed spinach since I didn’t have enough fresh spinach.  I portioned leftover & frozed.

I had a few homegrown cherry tomatoes I tossed in the skillet then smashed into the mix. I loved the flavor. Next time I make it I will add another egg and decrease the milk. Great savory quiche but some may not like the "soggy" bread texture.

We loved this quiche!  I made a few changes to suit our tastes - used a combination of riced broccoli, cauliflower and kale and one finely diced shallot instead of spinach and onion.  Sauteed the veggies in olive oil for about 5 minutes then cooled before adding to the egg mixture.  I used Cabot seriously sharp cheddar for the cheese.  I baked it for more like 45 minutes at 350 (center wasn't set at 30 minutes).  It is delicious hot or at room temperature.  Great recipe!

Made this double sized in a large round cake pan. Followed the recipe exactly, but mixed an hour ahead and put it in the refrig until ready to bake so it would be warm at serving time. Absolutely delicious.

I loved this — made a few changes after reading the comments. Added 1 teaspoon of herbes de Provence, changed the dairy to 1 1/4 cups of half-and-half, and added another egg. So it wasn’t mushy, everyone loved it. Can’t wait to make it again!

I didn't have croissants on hand so I used dinner rolls. I used 2 instead of three and baked for an additional 10 mins - turned out nice!

My family does not care for Monterey Jack so I substituted Sweet Munchee and Mozzarella  ... both good melting cheeses. It came out runny  but very very good!

1.5.17  Had some mini croissants that needed to be used up, so I used four of them and also substituted Egg Beaters® for the eggs (watching our cholesterol a bit).  This is so easy to make, the texture was perfect, it’s creamy, and with that first bite, you really do get the taste of classic Quiche Lorraine.  Also like the way that this breaks down nutritionally, you can enjoy this without destroying your diet.  Thanks Chef Kaiti, we loved your recipe.
