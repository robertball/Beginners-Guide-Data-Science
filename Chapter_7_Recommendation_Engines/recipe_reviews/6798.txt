I have a hard time with cornbread recipies because I like my cornbread dense and grainy, but sweet.  Most recipies are either sweet and cakey, or dense and salty or bland.

The first batch I made followed the recipe exactly and was quite good.  It was a little salty for my taste, but delicious drizzled with honey.  

Once I had a feel for the flavor of the original recipe, I set out on my own.  I reduced the salt to 1/2 tsp, and added 1/2 tsp sugar and a good squeeze of honey.  It was just about ideal.  If you try it this way though, watch it carefully as it bakes.  The added sugars can make it brown very quickly.  You may want to compensate by baking it in a larger, shallower pan so that the crust doesn't brown before the center is cooked through.

This is the perfect cornbread! It's the kind, being from Arkansas, that I was raised on and have eaten my whole life. I can't stand the sweet, cakey cornbread that most people make today - this is REAL cornbread!! Gritty and dense and not sweet at all - excellent! This brings back great memories of my Grandma's cooking. Perfect with a bowl of black eyed peas and a big glass of iced tea! :)

This is a great skillet cornbread recipe.  I used regular milk rather than butter milk and it was still great.  
This makes a dense bread with a crunch crust.  I prefer corn bread this way as it was how I was raised.  If you are looking for a sweet corn bread recipe this is not it.

Thank goodness, a non-sweet cornbread! My husband and I hate sweet, cakey cornbread and this was just like my mother-in-law used to make.  Will make often.

This was exactly what was stated, it was a dense grainy cornbread that was easy to prepare and came out exactly like she stated.  I have to admit I was wanting a lighter cornbread and did not like this type.  I do like to make it in a skillet so this was what tempted to make it.  I won't prepare it again, the family did not like it.  It was my own fault for not picking another variety to choose from.

My club used this 5X.  Some used 1/4c maple, agave or honey, our fats varied(shortening, butter, coconut oil, canola) & we used thick cut polenta. R was great w/each preference combo & texture was incredible! My $.02:  SALT:Too much for amount of soda used. Forget topping the original R w/butter! We 1st used the R as is, then needed to reduce the salt. I think it was a typo because the recommendation for adding salt to flour is .5tp/1c flour. There's only 1c here. Plus, baking soda is a salt. With confidence you can reduce the salt to taste because the rising will be unaffected (there's no yeast in this R).  BAKING TIME:16 minutes tops! I used a 9" glass pan. With a sweetener the top and sides will burn if not watched after the 11 minute mark. As soon as you like the color place foil lightly over the CB and continue to bake. Sugar has carbon and therefore will turn to charcoal in heat; 450* is HOT and this happen fast in the R. No sugar? Start checking after 13 minutes by lightly tapping top of CB to feel if its solid. Like moist CB? Take it out as soon as it's solid.  Not using CISkillets? Don't mind flour? Flour pan generously for less sticking.  BAKING SODA:Baking soda can replace baking powder but reverse is NOT true. One must use bs or the CB will be flat.  MILK:You can't use milk in this R. The Baking soda will only combine w/ acidic milk to form CO2 & leaven this R.  MIX:Mix wet/dry separately.Combine at last sec. to retain as many CO2 bubbles as possible for the oven.

I made this cornbread with low fat margarine in a cake pan in the oven, and personally thought it tasted great warm, but my family didn't like it as much as the sweeter corn muffins I made from a different recipe. I liked it, though, and will make it for myself again.

This recipe was great! Exactly what I have been looking for. I don't like the "cake like" texture of cornbread I prefer the grainy texture of the good old fashioned kind.

If you use regular milk rather than buttermilk, make sure to use baking powder instead of the baking soda.

What I loved most about this recipe was its versatility for wheat-free cooking. The cornbread was great, but that's not all I was able to make. Using the same basic formula, I substituted the cornmeal with quick oats and came up with a deliciously spongy Oat Bread instead. That same recipe, using the oatmeal substitution, made a great muffin mix base (makes 6 muffins). Non-stick cooking spray and cake pans work just as well as shortening and a cast-iron skillet.

I did not have buttermilk so I mixed 1 cup of skimmed milk with 1 T. of vinegar, and I also added 3/4 cup of flour. Like many others, I also only used 1/2 t. of salt. Then, I added about 1 T. of oil to the recipe, too. I did not let the shortening melt in the pan. I instead used  a 9" cake pan, and greased that with oil. Then I poured the cornbread mixture. I did not mix the mixture with the oil on the pan. My cornbread was ready in about 20 minutes. Yum!

This definitely is an "old-fashioned" version of cornbread, so don't expect it to be cake-like in texture or to rise as other recipes.  I sprayed the bottom of my pan with Pam for baking and I added the melted butter to the mixture along with a Tbsp. of white sugar.  Watch your baking time as it's done when it's a nice golden brown.  Simple and delicious - perfect topped with butter or honey!

My husband and father both come from the south and HATE what we use as cornbread here in California. It is sweet and cakelike...and although I love it, I have had to listen to them lament about missing REAL cornbread. 
   When I found this recipe, I hoped that it finally put an end to their complaining...and it did! It was all they had hoped for...I did make a few adjustments after reading some of the other reviews...changing the salt to 1/2 tsp. , added a 1/2 tsp. of baking powder, 3/4 C. flour, and 1 TBS. oil...and it was perfect for them both. (In fact, the only reason I gave it just 4 Stars is because I did have to alter the original just a little...)
   Thank you sooo much for this recipe...and for the previous reviews! This one will be one of our regular recipes from now on!

This is pretty much the way I grew up making cornbread & still make.  However, I use a self-rising cornmeal so that eliminates the baking soda & salt.  As soon as I pull the skillet out of the oven & put the hot oil in the mix I add 1 Tbs of butter to the skillet.  It melts immediately and when you pour the bread in you get a nice buttery flavor on the crispy crust.  I find that the bread is done & browned in approx. 25 minutes.

I wanted to make this low fat, so I used 2 egg whites instead of 1 egg. Because other reviewers said this cornbread didn't rise very much, I whipped the egg whites until they formed stiff peaks; then I folded in the other ingredients to the egg whites. I liked the results--the cornbread wasn't as dense as some cornbreads that don't have flour.

Lose the egg & most of the salt, then add a tsp baking powder and you will come out with beautiful non-sweet cornbread like my grandmothers mother taught her in the mid-1880s.  If there are other people around when you take it out of the oven, you had better bake twice as much as you originally intended, since half of it will be consumed on the spot with a little butter!  Crumbled up in milk, it makes a scrumptious late night snack.  Reheat later with a small amount of water in a separate microwave container and it will be almost as good as when it first came out of the oven!

This was a great cornbread with some of my personal modifications (some because of lack of items on hand):
1 TBS of sugar added
Substituted shortening with "Smart Balance” butter spread
¼ tsp salt
I used regular corn meat along with just a regular 8”x8” square baking pan.
Because of the added sugar, I lowered the oven temperature to 400o  and only cooked 25 minutes.
My husband thought it was the best cornbread he had ever tasted.
I tried this recipe because we just found out my husband was allergic to wheat (after 50+years).
Thank you for this wonderful "wheat free" cornbread.  My next venture..."wheat free" banana bread.  I'll let you know what I come up with.

I really like that this recipe has no sugar.  I used stone-ground cornmeal and reduced the salt to 1/2 teaspoon, based on other reviews.  I used clarified butter instead of shortening and baked it in a divided cast-iron pan, so I got 8 wedges.  It was done in about 12 minutes.  I discovered that if it bakes too long, the cornbread deflates.  I will definitely make this again!

I am a southern gal.  But somehow this cornbread just didn't do it for me.  I thought that because it didn't have flour or sugar, I could count on some homestyle cornbread.  It was not what my Granny makes.  It was not what my father-in-law makes.  Way too flat and dry.  I don't like sweet and cakey but this extreme opposite is not much better.

For some reason I can't make a pan of cornbread to my taste and that doesn't fall apart unless I use two eggs.  So I did with this recipe, and it's perfect every time, flipped over onto a plate out of an ancient cast iron skillet, crusty on the outside, dense and delicious on the inside, and not a trace of sugary sweetness.  I like it best just out of the oven, slathered with real salted butter.  This is the cornbread of my childhood, and although my father's Tennessee farmer mother used homemade buttermilk and lard, I can't make it any better.  Great doings, Nancy!  Thank you.

This is a very traditional cornbread recipe.  Nothing fancy, but quite delicious.  If cornbread makes you think of Jiffy...you probably won't like this.

not very good.  too salty.  i'd omit the salt in this recipe next time.  i'm sure the baking soda adds a salty flavor as does the buttermilk.  i only cooked if for half the time and the bottom was almost burnt.  good thing i checked it halfway through!  i've definately had better cornbread!

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was far too salty. I was looking for a recipe that was not full of sugar and I will try it again just with half the amount of salt or less even. It was pretty crumbly, but I am guessing maybe it is supposed to be that way.

This is exactly like my recipe (mine uses double the ingredients but the same proportions) except I use bacon grease instead of shortening. Try it for a little added flavor.I had begun to think we were the only people who dont like sweet cornbread. I see I was quite wrong!  As my husband says, I'll have desert AFTER dinner. Thank you for making this available!

This is a wonderful recipe. I do not like cornbread to be cakey or sweet. It tastes just like my grandmother's! I think the key is the cast iron skillet.

Having read the other reviews, I made this with only 1/2 tsp of salt.  This cornbread recipe has its place, which is to serve with chili.  It is not the slightly sweet, spongy cornbread you might be used to.  This is strictly for putting at the bottom of the bowl and then ladling the chili over it.  Used that way, it is fine.  I recommend making it in an 8-inch cast iron skillet (not 9-inch), and checking it after 15 minutes in the over.  It does cook more quickly than the printed recipe calls for.  The 1/2 tsp of salt is just right.  I would not put sugar in it...it's not that kind of cornbread.

Thanks for this wonderful recipe...so quick and easy and lots of flavor.  I like the fact that it is baked in a skillet which adds a little crispyness.  I used olive oil and regular cornmeal since I didn't have stoneground cornmeal in the house but it still was delicious.  Bet its really good with stoneground.  Beans, cornbread, fried potatoes, greens and of course, white onions quartered...Can't be beat!!!

Excellent!! Finally, a true Southern Cornbread recipe - NO SUGAR!! We had this once a week when my mother would cook an all southern vegetable meal for a break from the meat oriented meals during the rest of the week. We five kids loved it with yellow squash, yummy turnip greens, blackeyed peas and whatever was garden fresh that week. But our favorite use for this cornbread recipe was for Thanksgiving Turkey Dressing to - die - for. Lots of chopped onions, celery and giblets....cooked in the turkey and in a cast iron pan so it would be all crunchy. Heavenly with fresh cranberry sauce and turkey and gravy and sweet potatoes...oh my!! Absolute perfection.  
If you want the truly authentic Southern Cornbread recipe version use bacon grease in the cast iron pan rather than lard. No corn kernels or jalapenos or cheese for the purist. This is in no way meant to please a sweet tooth.

Love the simplicity of this recipe!  I don't like that most cornbread recipes call for flour (and LOTS of flour at that), so I was pleasantly surprised to find this simple and yummy recipe.  I made buttermilk with 1% milk and a little vinegar, cut my salt to 1/2 tsp., and added 1/2c whole corn, and this recipe was great!  Dense, grainy, and delicious, and the whole corn adds a bit of a sweet taste to the hearty bread.  Loved this recipe, will definitely be making again.

Just what I needed- a cornbread without flour. I baked this batter as muffins, since I needed to freeze them ahead of time. Also added 1 T. Xylitol sweetener and 1/2 tsp. baking powder. (No idea why on the last ingredient!)

Great recipe!  Easy and fun to prepare.  I'm surprised how many guests prefer this old style cornbread to the sweet fluffy variety.  Be sure to use a fine-gring cornmeal.  The popular medium-grind cornmeal is too coarse and results in gritty cornbread.

Finally!  I've been searching for a real cornbread recipe but kept coming up with cake like corn muffins instead. This recipe is the real thing.   Only note is that at 27 minutes at 450 it was about to over cook so keep your eye on it starting at the 20 minute mark.   Going to make some today for a yummy southern thanksgiving dressing.

Good skillet cornbread.  We like savory & grainy when it somes to cornbread as opposed to sweet & cakey, so this was a good choice for us.  I love cornbread from a skillet with that crispy bottom and edges.  Thanks for the recipe!

Finally, a true southern cornbread recipe that isn't a sweet cake-like bread. If I wanted sweet bread, I'd bake a cake... This recipe goes wonderfully with pinto beans as well as chili. Nothing like using fresh stone ground meal as well...YUMMY!!!
For those who claimed it didn't have any flavor. Did you use the BUTTERMILK??? That's where the flavor comes from. Another thing, this is a very small batch, bake it in a small skillet, not a 9 inch one..more like a 6 inch cast iron. Fresh stone ground cornmeal doesn't have baking soda/baking powder/salt.....Most old-fashion/seasoned bakers knows that. It should have been added to the recipe...

Very nice, quick and simple recipe. I cut down the salt to 1/2 a tsp and cooked it for only 13mins before it was done. I also used ricotta cheese rather than shorting to cut down on the fat.

Corn bread should not be sweet and fluffy! This one is the dense salty kind that goes really well with a pot of beans and ham bone. I back off the salt in this recipe a bit though.  The sweet fluffy kind is, I admit, pretty good as a muffin for breakfast:)

I hate to give a bad review, but this did not turn out at all. I double checked the recipe and I followed everything, I didn't read the reviews about the time and I wish I would have. I baked it for 30 minutes in my cast iron skillet, it did not raise at all, not one bit. It was also very dark brown on the sides and bottom. It was not even tastable.

I had to make this recipe twice because the first time I thought I did something wrong but it doesn't rise much and the other reviews are right about it being way to salty and I don't think my husband has ever thought that about anything. I will not make again. sorry.

This was a satisfying accompaniment to a pot of spicy chili.  (You don't want to be eating sweet, fluffy cake masquerading as cornbread with stuff like that!)  It was really fast to throw together, too.  I think I may add a bit less salt next time.  Also, this only took about 15 minutes to bake in my oven, so keep an eye on it.

THIS is cornbread.  Perfect recipe.  I like my cornbread to be a bit sweet so I add a couple tablespoons of sugar, but that's just a personal preference.  This recipe is great for those on gluten-free diets.

My husband is gluten-free and so I'm often limited when looking for good cornbread recipes.  This was a good base, but I would suggest a few changes.  I found this way to salty, so I cut the salt down to 1/2 tsp.  I also added 1 tablespoon of sugar just to add a touch of flavor and softer crumb.  Very good!

we were really surprised! when we took it out of the oven, we thought we were gona have to find a different recipe, but we LOVED this! We were surprised that it was so flat, but it was nicely brown, the taste is out of this world!! It isn't sweet or cakey, and lots of reviewers say it was too salty, but we didn't find that to be true. It was flat enough that we couldn't slice it in half and butter it, so we put the butter on top,and it worked so well. it doesn't make a large amount, but we don't need a large amount. its a real keeper! We couldn't be happier! Its going to have a special place in our recipe file! thank you!

I modified this recipe for a friend who's allergic to gluten and dairy by subbing soy milk for buttermilk. I had my doubts because the batter is so watery, but it did come together. If I ever make this again I will use vegetable oil instead of shortening and whisk everything together WELL before baking to avoid having an egg-y coating on the top of the bread. I like other cornbreads on this site much better, but this works if you can't have gluten.

I did add about 1/4C honey and 1/4C white flour to the recipe and baked in a non-stick, metal cake pan for about 20 minutes.  Only had regular cornmeal, not stone ground.  Love the texture.  Even with adding honey, still not sweet and still very good!

I really didn't think this was going to work. I usually add flour to my stone ground cornmeal recipes. I also thought the heat would be too high. My husband is a diabetic so I decided to go for it. I took a peek at it during cooking & it looked like it was a weird boiling mess. But, I'll admit I ate half the pan. Kept coming back for more. Really liked it. I even did the vinegar, skim milk trick since I didn't have any buttermilk. Can't wait to try it with buttermilk. I also only had butter flavored Shortening so I used that. It's a simple recipe that I really liked. I did take it out at about 25 minutes. It was started to get really brown around the edges.

this recipe turned out great! when i make chili for dinner i like to have cornbread go with it and the sweet stuff seems to make the chili taste funny. this recipe was perfect for it. the only thing i changed was to add about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar to the batter.

Great, easy recipe. I've made it many times and love it. That said, HALVE THE SALT!! Sorry but it's MUCH too salty for my taste, as written. You can always add salt at the table. Other than that, I've substituted whole milk for the buttermilk many times, and I've always made it with butter rather than shortening (I rarely have buttermilk and never shortening) and I don't notice any difference. I've also added frozen corn and honey to the batter, and thought both were great additions.

This is what I was looking for!  I've been trying to find a cornbread recipe that I like, but most of them just taste like yellow cake with some corn added.  This is perfect.  It's not sweet, it's dense and moist and delicious with chili.

Quick and easy cornbread just like Grandma used to make. Hubby loves it with pinto beans. Don't have cast iron, but comes out just fine in a loaf pan. Thanks! Made a healthier version by using milk and leaving out the oil!

This was just OK. It DEFINITELY doesnt need to cook any more than 20-25 minutes. I didnt find it salty, just tasteless. Im a good ol'Southern girl from VA, but this wasnt for me. I'm going to put the rest UNDER the chili and eat it that way... great suggestion!

I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting whole milk for the buttermilk.  I thought it was just o.k.    My husband said that it had a spongy texture and he would only give it a 3.5.  It was super flat and I guess I'd rather not have it that way.  I cooked this in an iron skillet in my oven and it only took 15 min.  I'm glad that I checked on it b/c a few more minutes and it would have been burnt all over.  The outside was plenty done but the inside wasn't.  I think the only thing that made this kinda tasty for us was the butter I spread on top of it!  I probably won't make it this way again.

i loved this cornbread.  just like my grandfather used to make every morning on his virginia farm.  however, salt does need to be reduced to 1/2 t, and i used skim milk and it turned out fine.

I usually prefer the cakier, though not necessarily sweeter, cornbread, but I chose this recipe because it contained no regular flour.  My husband has sever allergies and is trying to go gluten-free.  We did not like it.  It was easy and true to its description, but just not to our taste.  If I do it again I will probably add some creamed corn, cheese, and maybe some onion to liven it up some and cut the grainy density.

I accidentally used baking powder instead of baking soda so that might be why it was really dense but the flavor was awful. All I could taste was the sourness of the buttermilk.

So easy! Too salty for us though, so the second time I tried it, cut the salt in half which was just right. Also tried adding a third cup of corn, which was also good. Very nice basic recipe to play with. One note: in my convection oven, at 450, it cooked in 20 minutes, so folks might want to check how it's going in their ovens.  This will be our go-to recipe to build on.

I haven't tried it because its the same as mine. And generations before me. Of coarse you add different things to make it a side dish: like corn and jalapeños onions etc. all that is great sometimes but I prefer it most in its plain form.  Sometimes I have substituted mayonnaise for egg and the oil (you can also  use vegetable oil instead of lard) and it works  (about 1 1/2 to 2 tablespoons). Sometimes I add 1 tablespoon anyway and it turns just right not too dry. Another good tip is to warm pan ( not too hot) then poor a couple of tablespoons oil ( or lard) then over sink or drip pan swirl around if not too hot with fingers as too oil pan well then pour off excess oil a little left in pan won't hurt a thing. This helps for the bread to crust  perfectly and to release from pan with ease.

I wondered how this would work with no flour, but I followed directions.  I poured the very thin 
batter into my hot greased skillet and stirred in the fat  (olive oil).  I set the timer for 30 minutes, but peeked in at 22.  Good thing, since the edges  were quite dark.  I took it out, cooled slightly, and cut it.  Quite dark on the bottom (not burned).  It's only 1/2 inch thick.  The flavor is OK.  I agree the salt is a little too much.  This is not going to be my new favorite cornbread recipe.  Sorry.  UPDATE:  I revisited this recipe today.  I read the reviews suggesting a lower temperature and to make sure to put vinegar in the milk if not using buttermilk.  I also realized my skillet is larger than the recipe calls for, so I increased amounts by half.  My result was a thicker bread and I turned it out of the pan so that it would not continue to brown.  It looks beautiful.  But, alas!  I miss the sugar and flour!  So although this may be what YOU are looking for, it is still not for me.  But I really tried.  In this case, people who DID NOT follow the recipe's directions, but left a review telling what they did instead, really helped me.  These directions do not seem to be accurate for many people.

I've made cornbread this way all my life... the TRICK, is to add a 1/2 tsp kosher salt!  Also, DO NOT use shortening - only bacon grease. (If you don't hear a sizzle when you pour the batter into the skillet, your pan isn't hot enough.)  Remove as soon as possible onto a serving plate or flip it into a glass pie pan, otherwise, it will continue to "cook" as it cools!  And since my daughter is gluten-sensitive only when consuming large amounts, I am still free to add my 1 Tbsp. AP flour, which does give it a lighter rise.  I am always asked to bring my "skillet cornbread" to functions and gatherings!

This was delicious cornbread.  Not sweet in anyway, which is what I'm used to in cornbread.  That said, the directions are completely nutso.  I used a 10-inch iron skillet, adjusted all the ingredients to 1.5 the called-for amounts (i.e. 1.5 cups cornmeal instead of 1 cup), and baked at 350 for 23 minutes.  Came out perfectly cooked and just slightly browned.

I needed something quick and without flour (gluten free).  This fit the bill.  It was a little too salty for my liking, so next time I would just add a bit less salt.  Otherwise, I would say this is a good quick substitute for a cornbread with flour.

I didn't care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly as it was written and the cornbread looks NOTHING like the picture. It also nearly burned to a crisp in my oven. This was after baking it for less than 30 minutes. I will never make this again.

Holy smoke, this is good.  True southern cornbread like I grew up with.  I doubled the recipe and baked for 23 minutes in my 10-inch iron skillet.  I did come back to change my rating to 4 instead of 5 stars because it really is too salty.  At first I thought I liked it, but next time I'll try cutting the salt in half.  Otherwise a great recipe!

After trying this recipe, I have to say that I much more prefer sweeter, cake-like cornbread.  And I know this recipe is not supposed to be like that, but we just didn't enjoy it very much.  It was too salty and gritty.  I think my skillet was too big because it came out more like a cornbread pancake!  If you have a larger skillet, then I would suggest doubling the recipe.

On the second try I reduced the salt to 1/4 teaspoon and I added 1/4 cup of sugar.  I made two seperate batches and poured them in a cast iron pan to bake.  Baking powder not baking soda!

Perfect recipe if you're looking for a "not sweet" cornbread.  I made mine in a large piece of stoneware so it was thin and cooked up very quickly.  Was very tasty with butter and/or honey.

This is fantastic!  Perfect.  If you add sugar and honey to it you deserve to have it scorch.  When did people decide that cornbread needed to be sweet and cake-like?  This is a also gluten-free recipe and very much like the cornbread my Tennessee side of the family make.  Thank you for sharing. Nelly.

30 minutes was too long. The part that wasn't burned tasted good though. I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk and added 1/4 cup of honey. Next time I'll just try 20 minutes. Otherwise not bad!

This is almost certainly the recipe my grandma used. She said if it's got sugar, it's CAKE!!  Of course she substituted bacon grease for the shortening...as will I...but a million thanks for the true southern cornbread!

I would have given this another 1/2 star but this site doesn't allow it! This is a great recipe and does and is just what it says. If you want sweet and cakey, then go to another recipe. Enjoy with chili, bbq ribs, fried chicken and all kinds of great southern dishes.

My skillet was too big for this recipe, so I lined a muffin pan instead. The batter was VERY liquidy, so I made 4 muffins according to recipe, then added 1/2 cup of flour, made 4 muffins with that, then added another 1/4 cup to the remaining batter and made 4 of those....overall the 4 with the most flour came out best, but these were not tasty. They also stuck to the paper liners. Not planning on making these again.

Mine was very shallow in the pan and stuck like mad to the cast iron skillet.  Taste was dead-on though.  Next time I'll double it and grease the pan more generously beforehand.  I also cut the salt in half.  REALLY GOOD CORNBREAD.

Just a note on the directions:  Baking at 450 for 30 to 40 minutes isn't right, especially since it's so thin.  Mine was ready to catch fire at the 27 minute mark when I--thank goodness--checked it!

Excellent! I used plain soy milk, rather than butter milk plus one TB raw honey! It was a little salty for my taste so I think next time I will use a little less. Since I cant eat dairy or wheat I will surely make this again!

Coming from a Kentucky girl, this is REAL cornbread!  No flour, no sugar! This is the cornbread my mama made and taught me to make, right down to putting the shortening in the skillet and preheating in the oven! It's great!

Sadly this recipe just didn't live up to my expectations. I read and reread it and I baked it as per the instructions in my cast iron skillet and it came out thin, hard, and salty so I ended up not using it.

This recipe worked well for me, I can't imagine what could have went wrong for others. I decreased the salt based off other reviews, and I cooked it at 400 degrees for only about 15 minutes. My oven tends to run pretty hot though. I served under white chicken chili. perfect!

Thank you so much for this recipe Nancy! As per other reviewers, I didn't cook the bread but about 25 minutes and I reduced the salt by half.  The only other changes I made were to add about a tablespoon and a half of Masa Harina (I love that stuff) and a couple tablespoons of honey.  Just based on taste this recipe is certainly five star but it stuck terribly to my pan, I will be making this very soon and will try more shortening.  My only other complaint was that the recipe didn't rise as much as I wouldve liked, but that was probably my fault; I used self rising cornmeal so I left out the baking soda (which I was out of anyway).

Cooking time was too long in this recipe, only took about 25 minutes.  I didn't like the idea of using shortening so I substitued butter but you must watch the melting butter very carefully as not to burn it.  I didn't mix the butter into the mixture, rather just poured the batter into the melted butter.  This was OK but think a recipe with flour, sugar, and butter is best for our taste.

This is the real thing. Thanks for sharing--this is what I remember from childhood in rural Georgia, only I remember that my mom and grandmother didn't use the egg. Wondering if I could just leave it out of this one. Would appreciate it if someone could post a recipe for egg-less cornbread.

Super easy to make! I used milk with vinegar instead of buttermilk. I like mine a little sweeter and would add sugar next time. Mine was cooked at about 25 minutes, so keep an eye on it!

Moist and great presentation in a Texas shaped skillet.  Next time I will add some honey for a hint of sweetness.

Ooooh yum! Based on reviews/preferences/allergies I made this with the following adjustments:
Almond milk instead of dairy (and one tablespoon of vinegar, to make it like buttermilk), 1 tablespoon of honey, 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder to lighten it, half the salt, and a tablespoon of flax and 3 extra tablespoons of almond milk as an egg substitute. I wouldn't have minded it without the honey, but it was nice with it too. If I had used another kind of syrup it would be vegan. Super tasty and great crust!

This was delicious! Just the recipe I was looking for with no added flours or sweeteners! I do not keep buttermilk at home, but thanks to a suggestion I found on The Kitchn, I substituted 3/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup water for the 1 cup buttermilk and it worked perfectly. 30 minutes was plenty of baking time. My whole family liked it, even my husband, and he’s pocky about his corn bread.

I like that this recipe didn't have any sweetener, most cornbread recipes out here do call for it. I did like the straightforward corn flavor. That being said, I didn't like the consistency of this cornbread once baked. I prefer to use a medium coarse grind cornmeal because I want a grainy crunchy texture. This batter was very soupy. I think this recipe could be improved by adding AP flour, probably 3/4 to 1 cup and 3 tablespoons of melted butter or oil. I'll give this recipe another try with these changes and see if it improves the finished product.

Made it exactly according to the recipe, per my mom's request, only doubling everything since my cast iron pan is so large. 

It slid out the pan like a dream! Browned up perfectly, too. Since I made such a big batch, it barely fit onto a standard cooling rack. 

It was semi-gritty, semi-moist in texture, neither sweet nor dry, and that was what my mother wanted in a homemade cornbread like she had growing up in West Virginia. We made it to crumble onto pinto beans, and it did work nicely for that purpose, but it was also great as a slice to dip into the bean juices.

Goodness, I am definitely making this again and again! (Try it, seriously.)

I made this mostly the same, except bacon grease instead of shortening and I used  a smaller size iron skillet. It was done in about 20 minutes. 
I wanted a flour-free cornbread for my gluten-sensitive husband. This was absolutely delicious, held together well, when cut (& buttered) was a nice thickness because of the smaller pan size (about 7"),and we didn't miss the flour at all. Highly recommend & will make again.

Now, this is cornbread!  It's almost like my grandma's family recipe.  The most important ingredient is the stone-ground cornmeal.  Make sure this is the type of cornmeal you use.  
The only thing I changed was using bacon grease instead of shortening.  Just something Grandma used when making cornbread.

My husband is from Arkansas and doesn't like sweet cornbread. I have had a difficult time finding a good cornbread recipe for him. 
I did add a half teaspoon of sugar and it came out perfect. This is  wonderful and moist.

Excellent texture and flavor. This could go savory or sweet. We added a tbsp of sugar and had it with honey.  We used butter and it could have used a bit more. Probably would be fine in a greased glass dish. The texture is better than the recipes with wheat.

This made great cornbread. I liked the taste, but the cooking time was too long. I checked mine after 24 minutes and it was already too brown. I replaced the shortening with butter, and used regular cornmeal, but other than that made it like stated and it turned out really well.

450 was WAY too hot! I burned the first batch within minutes of putting it in the oven. Lowered the temp to 375, and the 2nd batch cooked just fine. Added a TBS of sugar and a large squeeze of honey, which added nice flavor.

This is just right. I have made this dozens of times - for some reason I still don’t have it memorized! But it is just the most basic southern (not sweet!) cornbread. I don’t have a cast iron skillet, so I make it in glass: a 9” pie pan or 13x9” casserole if I’m doubling the recipe. It has never done me wrong, whether I just need the cornbread or I’m making it as the base for my cornbread dressing. So good! It’s in the oven now, again, and I can’t wait for that first slice!

This recipe is entirely misleading, usually cornbread is baked at 350. I thought 450 was a little high but I tried it anyway, it turned out burnt and totally flat - didn't rise at all except on big bubble in the middle. It was a waste of a perfectly good cup of milk and cornflour.

As written, the fundamentals of the recipe are there.  The baking instructions, however, are misleading.  450 degrees for 30-40 minutes is too hot and too long - resulting in a blackened, burnt crust. Other cornbread recipes bake at 350-400 degrees for up to 30 minutes. Make this recipe, but watch it carefully.

Perfect cornbread - not sweet and cakey but hearty. Also, it's an easy gluten-free bread to have with dinner. We have made this many times and there are rarely any leftovers. It would also be a good cornbread to use for stuffing.

This was a really good cornbread. I liked it better than regular. I didn't have plain yogurt so used plain Greek yogurt. You don't even taste it. I will definitely be making this again.

Just like my Missouri-born Mom used to make it with one difference.  We use bacon grease instead of shortening and the flavor is excellent.  We usually make it in a square baking pan and heat the bacon grease in the pan, roll it around to coat the pan and pour what's left into the batter.

Just like Granny's and perfect for dunking into a bowl of beans, soup, or chili. I have tried all of the 'just add milk/water' mixes out there and nothing came out quite right.  I finally decided to try this recipe.  SO very glad I did.  Thank you!

Yes!  Real cornbread, not corn cake!  Thank you so much.  Just finished a piece with my spicy black-eyed pea soup and had to have another little sliver to soak up the remaining juice--YUM!

Gritty, crunchy, not sweet at all.  Your kind of recipe if you don't like the normal sweet, cakey cornbreads, which I don't.  I used the 9" cast iron pan called for in the recipes and it took 21 minutes to cook to perfection, albeit fairly thin.  Whoever took the featured photo must have used a double recipe.  The other comments regarding an excessively salty taste caused me to cut the salt in half to 1/2t. and that was just right.

I was looking for a dense cornbread to use for my dressing tomorrow for Thanksgiving.  The problem is it might not be around tomorrow morning because it is so good.  I have a larger iron skillet so I doubled the recipe. So easy to make! Funny how some ratings are only 4 stars but that's because they modified it.  This is a great traditional cornbread!

I am definitely going to keep this recipe around! I think it goes great with a hearty soup or stew. The dense, gritty texture is a nice break from the type of cornbread most of us are used to. I made it vegan by using unsweetened soymilk (with a splash of lemon juice to fake the buttermilk) and a flaxseed/water combination for the egg substitute. My oven typically cooks slow, but this cornbread only took about 35 minutes until it was nice and done.

Great recipe! It was my first time making cornbread and I was very happy with how it worked out.  I did make a few changes - I used slightly less than 3/4 cup medium cornmeal, 1 tbsp plain flour, 1/4 cup coarse wholemeal flour, cut down salt to a scanty 1/2 tsp, added 1/2 tsp baking powder as well as the baking soda, and added 1/2 tbsp honey and half tbsp caster sugar.  I also used a cast iron casserole dish and sunflower oil, as I didn't have a skillet or shortening.  It came out a little lighter / fluffier i.e more cake like than I expected, but this was probably due to me fiddling around with the recipe! Either way, it was great, and a healthier option than many others out there! Thanks for the recipe :D

Thanks for this!  I like the sweet, cakey one, too, but it's not really cornbread, is it?  This is literally just like Mother made, in the iron skillet I still have !!

I made mine in a 12", rather than a 9" skillet.  The bread was thinner, but still great!  I also added 1/2 cup of frozen corn to the batter.

While the recipe isn't that bad, I find that the pic is misleading of the final product. This was alittle too dense and grainy for my liking, and it ended up very very flat. I'm not sure if it was user error, or what but I was not happy with the looks.

Fantastic! Made exactly the way the recipe described it, but I used a slightly larger cast iron pan (10 inch) because that is what I had. I had to watch it very carefully, and it cooked up in about 20 minutes. My boyfriend lived in the south for many years and declared it "perfect".

I made this tonight and it was the texture and corn taste that I was looking for.  It was too salty though, for me.  I baked it for the lower time and had some sticking and it was very brown (no burnt taste), but my oven temp may have been off by a little.

I looked up this recipe because my husband and a friend wanted cornbread.  I don't like cornbread - but they wanted it so I wanted to bake it for them.  I found this recipe and made it tonight.  Absolutely delicious!  I don't like cornbread, but I like THIS cornbread!  Moist, tender and delicious.  Even my husband and our friend were impressed. Thank you so much for sharing. Hugs, Anj

As far as the recipe goes, it turned out well, and tasted fine.  I just think for me, I prefer the more cake-like, sweeter version that I grew up on.  Thanks for sharing an alternative though.

I should have read the reviews. I loved the texture and grittyness, just like my Granna used to make, but this was too salty for me. I will make this again, but I'll cut the salt to 1/2 tsp. as others have done. Didn't seem to rise vey much.

I made this to go with some vegan chili I made and it went nicely with it. As advertised, this wasn't a sweet or cakey cornbread, but it was rather chewy and grainy. I kind of liked it like that actually, as this was the first time I've had a non-sweetened cornbread before. Mine was done in 20 minutes, so watch yours carefully.

Very easy and very good.  I used a stainless skillet so it took less time to cook.  My husband and I both enjoyed it.
