I wanted to make these cookies but I couldn't get in touch with my mom for the recipe. This is exactly how I remember them growing up. A few tips for people who said these were a gooey mess or very crumbly: When ever you heat Sugar, you are using the science of candy making, which allows for the heating of sugar to very particular temperatures, and since many stoves very in temperature, relying on 1 minute of boiling may not work for everyone so try this: Remember the stages of sugar making Thread: 230-235 (This will make a syrup) Soft Ball: 335-240 (This is the stage we will concentrate on for making these cookies) firm ball: 245-250 hard ball 250- 265 Soft crack- 270-290 hard crack- 300-310  For this particular recipe, after 1 minute of boiling, get a cup of cold water and drop a small spoon full of the syrup into the batter. If it forms a small, soft ball in the water, take it off the heat. If it creates a stringy thread, it's not done yet.

I boil this for 6 minutes - I also use 5 tbsp cocoa.    If it starts to get crumbly, stir in a teaspoon or two of hot water and they should set up fine.

This is an excellent recipe, especially if you are not a peanut butter lover.  My family loves the cocoa taste!  It is very easy to make.  The key to making it great is to remember to let the mixture come to a boil and THEN boil it for one minute longer.  Great treat!

This is the worst recipe I have ever used.  I made it twice thinking I did something wrong the first time.  The cookies don't set up at all.  We couldn't even eat them because I had to spoon them off the wax paper.  Finally, I threw them in the trash...TWICE!  Horrible cookies!

I LOVE this recipe and have been making it since high school. It is so easy and the dirty dishes are minimal. I make just a couple of small changes. I boil the cocoa powder with the sugar, milk and butter. I also add 1 cup of peanut butter and reduce the amount of oatmeal to 2 1/2 cups. The cookies have a smoother texture and appearance with less oatmeal.

So Good, and ready in less than 15 minutes if you put the cookie sheet in the freezer.  I would recommend spraying the wax paper with non stick spray before dropping the cookies on it.

I love no-bake cookies, but since I'm allergic to peanuts, it's difficult to find a recipe that works. This one is great though. I'd suggest cooking it 2 minutes after it starts boiling though or the cookies tend to be super sticky and don't taste as good. Otherwise, good recipe!

OK, a couple of observations - If you are wondering about this recipe, it is worth your time to refer to the review on "Dec. 23, 2009 by nicks_sister" - but to summarize - for this recipe to work, you want the temperature of the sugar to get to 235-240 degrees F.  Too hot and they will get crumbly, not hot enough and they will never set  up (I have actually eaten these with a spoon in the past - before the science part kicked in).  The big mistake I've made in the past is that I was afraid to let the sugar mixture really 'boil' - I figured 'back the temp down so the boil is not violent' - WRONG! It has to get hot enough.  One minute... Six minutes... doesn't matter - get the temp to the right range and it will work. See the referenced review for 'how to tell without a candy thermometer'. Outside of this critical piece, this is one of the easiest recipes you'll ever use. They are exactly what I remember as a child, and what I have loved forever. the peanut butter versions are good too, but this is the one.  There is a lot of room for frustration with these cookies, but all of that rests on that one specific detail. I Love these Cookies.

One big problem with this recipe: one minute is nowhere near long enough to cook this, unless you like to eat your no-bake cookies with a spoon. This recipe should be cooked to soft ball stage, about 240 degrees F. It will take about 8 minutes, not 1 minute, to get there. Otherwise the cookies will not set.

Followed the recipe with a bit of changes ;) for one, followed another reviewers adjustment of boiling (on med-high heat) the Sugar, butter, milk and cocoa powder, but I went ahead and added the 1tsp of flavor (which i used 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract and 1/2 tsp of butter extract). I boiled for 5 mins stirring very often. In another bowl I put in the 3 cups of quick oats, with just two handfuls of mini marshmallows, 1 cup of semi sweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans then tossed well using my hands. I added the hot mixture to the dry and mixed well with a spoon. I had cookie sheets with parchment paper that I just lightly sprayed with Canola Oil. Dropped the mixture by the spoonfuls and let set for just a min or two, buy then it was cool enough for me to form the mixture into perfect little circle/disks. I let cool to room temp for apprx. 10 mins (ate one, just as a test ;) while it was still a little warm. It had a very little crumble to it and it was soft and chewy but formed perfectly) Oh! then stuck them in the refrigerator till dinner time. They are absolutely delicious and oh so sweet (enough to satisfy my sweet tooth!). Hope this helps. Happy Baking!

I'm doing a low glycemic index diet so I made a few changes: 1/2 c. Splenda (equivalent to 1 c. sugar) Unsweetened Almond Milk in place of regular milk Increased cocoa to 1/4 c (4T) and accidentally used old fashioned oats.  Will definitely make again although quick cooking oats would be better.  Cookies already setting up after just a few minutes in the fridge!  I did wait for a rolling boil and then boiled for 3 minutes.

This sounds easy so you naturally want to try it.  I've followed the instructions to the T two times and they DO NOT set up!  Instead of continuing to boil for 1 minute you have to let it continue to boil for at least 5 minutes in order for the cookies to set up.

I made this recipe for a jewelry party I was hosting and I had mixed reviews.  I personally thought these were VERY cocoa-laden and I probably will cut the cocoa down to 2-2.5 tablespoons next time.  However, one of my friends completely LOVED these cookies and took a whole plate home with her!  I ate these cookies when I was a kid, and I can't find a recipe that yields that familiar taste.  But these were overall very good (just a bit too chocolate-y for my tastes).  

ALSO: I used one cookie sheet covered with wax paper and filled up the cookie sheet with cookies to set.  I then put another layer of wax paper over the cookies and put more cookies on top (because I didn't have another cookie sheet).  This was a BAD idea ~ when the cookies had set, the top layer of cookies were sticking to the wax paper and I had to slide a knife underneath each cookie to get them off the wax paper (otherwise, the cookies were breaking as I tried to pull them away from the paper). Maybe a more experienced baker would know NOT to put two layers of non-hardened cookies on top of each other (even with wax paper between them), but I wasn't aware of this!  :)

great flavor but I think the butter/sugar/milk mixture needs to boil a bit longer than 1 minute. The cookies are too mushy and don't set up well. That said...no bake cookies are no bake cookies...they rock even if you have to eat them with a spoon! :-)

The "batter" was very thin, and I had to put them in the refrigerator because they would not firm up.  They tasted good enough.

If you only have old fashion oats,just follow the receipt and after you've added the oats, micro wave for approx 4-4 1/2 mins cover with foil for another 10 mins stirring then spoon onto wax paper...
It works great!

I would say a pretty good recipe.  However, I would suggest that you add more cocoa powder.  They weren't chocolaty enough for me.  Also should boil syrup for two minutes instead of one.

I am not sure about this recipe.  I remember making these I was a young child, and when I tasted them, they did not bring back memories.  I probably will not make these again!  Maybe it is because I used Splenda instead of sugar.  This is due to the fact that I am diabetic.   I also used Hersheys Special Dark 100% cocoa, butter, and vanilla that I paid $25 a bottle for.  There just seemed to be something missing.  Or maybe as I have gotten older, I am missing something.

I really like the version of this recipe with peanut butter, but wanted to try one without PB, as my husband isn't a PB fan.  I really liked this recipe.  It turned out just fine for me.  In my opinion, if they don't set up, just eat them with a spoon!

These are wonderful quick chocolate fixes!!  You can add 1/2 peanut butter for more of a reeses flavor.  You can also cut back sugar just a bit if you don't like them so sweet.  Just remember to bring to a rolling boil for about 4min. at least.  Anything past four starts to get a lil' crumbly for me.  Thanks for sharing.  I lost my old recipe.

YUM! I made them almost as stated - I did put the cocoa powder in the pan and cooked it along with the butter, sugar, and milk just because I didn't read the directions all the way through - and they still turned out perfect! Wouldn't change a thing about these cookies! Do make sure you get your mixture to a big old rolling boil before you set your timer for a minute and they will set up just fine!

I had an extreme craving for chocolate and was out of sweets so I thought I would try this recipe since I had what it called for. These were delicious! I read the other reviews first and added less sugar and more cocoa, cooked it for 4 min., but otherwise I followed the recipe. I ate two big spoonfuls even before I put it in the refrigerator and they were scrumptious. The oatmeal made them nice and chewy too.  I didn't have any problem with stickiness. They set up nicely on a large plate. After they were cold, my son and I ate a few and we both said, "Yummy, this recipe is a keeper!" Next time I may add some pecans and/or chocolate chips when they are ready to go into the fridge. Thank you Sandy for posting it.

I understand what some of the people are saying about it not setting up.  Use a dark pan, not a light one.  Everytime I use the dark pan its perfect.  Everytime the light pan, gummy.  Hope this helps

This is the recipe that I grew up making. It is still one of my favorites. HOWEVER... once the mixture comes to a boil, you really need to let it boil for three minutes. Less than that and they don't set up. Longer than that and they get very hard. Thanks for posting this recipe. I was excited to see this here.

Keeper for sure, I did add a bit of peanut butter to the mixture of butter and sugar.  Easy as, I put in the fridge as soon as they were done and within 30mins I had a nice chewy fudgy choc hit.

Unlike some other people, I didn't have any problems with this mixture setting.  I let it boil for the full minute as others have said and they were just fine.  Taste great too.

These were good, with some modifications.  I prefer this type of cookie without peanut butter, so I was glad to see this receipe.  My changes- I cut the sugar by about 1/4 of a cup, added an extra 1/3 of a cup of oats and doubled the cocoa.  Seems like alot of extra chocolate, but I love that bittersweet taste.  The extra oats makes them stick together better, but they still stay pretty moist.

I'm not sure what went wrong when I made these but they never set up. I did use old fashioned rolled oats instead of quick cooking oats (they were what I happened to have) I might try this again with quick oats, but I'm a little afraid the same thing will happen again. They tasted good despite their gooeyness.

I have lived where their is lots of humidity and now i live in the desert.  I have never had a problem with this recipe as long as I make sure the mixture is at a full boil for a full minute.  This is an awesome recipe with or without peanut butter.  In fact, my family likes it a little too much.

I am sad to say, this was an awful recipe,The humidity had nothing to do with it either.I tried turning it into a bar and it just fell apart,I ended up not only throwing them out but wasting all these ingredients I had put into it.It was a waste of time and money.

My fiance & had a sweet tooth but were limited on supplies. We used half/half instead of milk (we were out of milk) and we used 6 maple and brown sugar oatmeal packages since we didnt have quick oats. They actually came out really good! They were sweet but not overwhelming. I might use an extra pack of oats next time so the cookies are less chewy and more flaky. :)

These are wonderful! I am not a big peanut butter person, but wanted a good chocolate no-bake cookie. I did boil the mixture for closer to 3 minutes, rather than the recipes suggested 1 minute. And as for the oats, I free-hand poured them until the mixture looked the correct consistency. These were set after about 5 minutes in the freezer. They have a nice chocolatey taste, and the sweetness isn't too strong. Will definitely be repeating this in the future.

This is the recipe I grew up making. I like peanut butter just fine, but it doesn't belong in these cookies :)   
I can remember as a teen, being impatient & not cooking long enough once it started boiling. 
My siblings and I however did not trash them, we grabbed spoons. 
It didn't take long to figure out that boiling long enough would make sure the cookies set up.  
Thanks for sharing because until I found this one, everyone would share their peanut butter recipe. 
Many used chocolate instead of cocoa also.  Not in my cookies ;)
I like the original, no peanut butter and cocoa instead of chocolate ;)

This recipe is a favorite in my family for years.  My mother's recipe is slightly different.  In the saucepan goes the sugar, butter, milk and vanilla.  I also add a 1/2 cup of corn syrup to the pot (add syrup when everything is melted).  Slowly heat until you don't feel the grit of the sugar, once the sugar is fully liquified, turn up the heat a little more and bring just to a slight boil on the edges of the saucepan.  Take off immediately and pour into oat mixture (I use 4 cups oatmeal, 1 cup shredded coconut, 4 heaping tbsp cocoa powder, already mixed in a large bowl).  Drop by spoonful and let sit at least one hour.  They should turn out perfect.

I LOVE this recipe! I add 1/2 cup peanut butter. I make it gluten free and other stuff free. I use rice milk and Bob's Red Mill oats. Sometimes goat's milk. It still works out great!!! I have the biggest sweet tooth in my family so I make these a lot and they are so easy! If it is too liquidy I add more oats.

These came out great the third time I tried. Nothing wrong with the recipe but it took a bit to get the boiling part down. Other than that a great recipe. I added peanut butter to half and it was still good. I love letting my nieces and nephews make this with me when they come over!

I modified this a little, Using evaporated milk, and scaling it to make 12 cookies. I pressed it flat in a pan, and promptly put it in the freezer to set. It was yummy, even still warm!! Oh, and I also melted a handful of chocolate chips and threw those into the mixture that I put over my oats. It was very YUMMY!

These cookies seemed very bland to me.  A pinch of salt would help.  The peanut butter version is way better with much more flavor.

Although they tasted good, they were very gooey. None of them set very well, even though I followed the recipe exactly. I had to leave them out on the counter the entire night, and they still didn't harden. I would suggest making smaller cookies, and adding more oats so the moisture is soaked up better.

ok.....my little bros and i decided we were hungry and wanted to make something that didnt need to go into the oven....what do you know.....cookies......so we started to make the cookies when we discovered that we had no more milk .....so...we decided to use water instead.....in the end this wasn't such a good idea because ....water makes the sauce to liquidie and the batch never set.... we still enjoyed the recipe though because we called no bake soup instead of no bake cookies :D

This is a good recipe, but I have a couple of things to add: 1. use real butter 2. in addition to all ingredients, add a splash of coconut rum. With these additions, people I have made these for have RAVED about this recipe!

Did not set up at all, and I tried the recipe 2 times. First time I thought it did not work since I used soy milk. I used regular milk the 2nd time, and it still did not set up. Plus it is a bit too sweet. Would not make again.

I've been looking for a recipe like this for a while (one without peanut butter).  These set up nicely but they weren't the best.  Next time I will definitely try some of the other reviewers suggestion - like more cocoa and less sugar.  They weren't very chocolately and were kind of grainy.

I was really excited when I found this recipe.  It seemed to be the same as a delicious recipe I lost a few years ago.  It's similar, but not the same.  This recipe lacks flavor.  If I make these cookies again...i will cut the amount of butter and add more chocolate.  I think this would make them more flavorful.

This recipe is perfect, except you have to add peanut butter.  I usually make a triple batch.

My goodness these are exactly the taste I grew up on!

Key as others has said is that you need to boil longer than a minute I found. Somewhere 3-4 minutes for me! The softball test that other commenters were advising was 100% bang on!

I used a candy thermometer and boiled the mixture til 235F but it instantly crumbled when I added the oats. I tried adding a few tsp of hot water to help like another comment suggested, that didn't work. Then I added peanutbutter thinking I could still rescue them. That also didn't work dry, crumbly cookies. I squeezed them into balls, and they're still edible. but NOT a good rendition of the traditional no-bake cookie I was going for.

These were delicious! I used all measurements and ingredients listed but combined butter, sugar milk and cocoa powder together. Got it to a rolling boil stirring constantly for exactly 2 minutes. Took off the heat and added the vanilla and oats. Scooped onto a lightly sprayed cookie sheet. They set nicely. Perfect for those with peanut butter allergy who  love these cookies!

These weren't as good as the cookies I remember my mother making when I was young, but it's the closes thing I've had. they were still good. Thanks for the advice of testing the sugar with a few drops in cold water before removing from heat. When it wasn't stringy, I proceeded with the recipe as suggested.

I made this recipe five times. I stayed up until one am having started at ten. I wanted them for an aunt because it was a nostalgic recipe and I wanted to make her happy. I threw away five batches of this, went to the store three times, went through two containers of oatmeal and ran out of butter, and cried and cried. I tried everything, other commenters suggested boiling it longer but that did nothing. It was all a gooey waxpaper mess and my kitchen was a wreck and it was one am and I was so frustrated my husband and I ended up tense at each other after a night of working so hard only to fill our trash can with sticky chocolate crud. My only suggestion is to get ready to *camp* next to your stove with this. Boil the sugar mixture for half an hour if you need to, because 15 minuets didn’t work for me. Doubling the oatmeal didn’t work. Cooking the oatmeal mixture didn’t work. Freezing them after setting them didn’t work. Four hours and a trash bag of groceries and nothing to show for it.

The recipes for these cookies are always hit and miss.  They must be cooked to a stage so they will harden like a cookie but not be brittle.  If you boil for only 1 minute, the mixture will be soft and sticky like candy.  Boil for 3 minutes or test with candy thermometer.  You could use the method of dropping a bit in cold water to see if it will form a ball.

This is Basically the same recipe I got and made in Grade 7 Home-Ec Class, 46 years ago. OMG has it really been that long?!? 
Except for two tiny details, first - my original recipe calls for 4 Tbsp. Cocoa Powder, and second -  these are supposed to be called "Fiddle Diddles" sounds way more fun than unbaked cookie. 
Anyway, over the last 46 years these have only failed to firm up nicely twice. Once because it was a smokin hot summer day and since we didn't have AC back then, kitchen was just too hot. And once  because I was letting the kids help (back when they were little) and measure and we may have doubled the milk. So that time they had spoons of cookies. LOL.
I have always waited till its come to a full RAPID ROLLING boil and then set the timer for 2 minutes. Always have everything measured and ready to dump in and stir up right away as soon as you take the pot off the heat. Always add/blend the cocoa to the finished hot syrup, don't boil your cocoa powder! Then add the vanilla, stir a bit, then oats. Do this all fairly quickly.
 Maybe that 4th Tbsp. of cocoa makes a difference, I don't know... But it's always turned out great for me for the past 46 years, and our family has always loved these and now the grand-kids do too.

liked the recipe, only one thing I would change. put 6 tbs coca instead of 3, there's just not enough flavor. otherwise this is a good recipe and peanut free which is hard to come by in no bake cookies.

As written, your cookies will not harden the way they are supposed to.  They will be sticky and gooey.  The entire mixture needs to be boiled together.

These were amazingly delicious and easy peasy to make.
I followed directions, made sure to start my minute boiling after it came to a rolling boil.
I could not wait till they cooled to eat. I have saved this recipe as I Know I will be making again. Thank you for sharing.

These are just like the cookies I made all the time as a teenager.  My mom had cleaned out her recipe box after all the kids were gone so I thought I was just out of luck ever finding it again.  Most other no-bake recipes have peanut butter but I knew my old one didn't.  Thanks for bringing it back.  However, I think my tastes have changed since I've gotten older and they are just a little too sweet now.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar and increase the oats so they aren't so runny.  Great cookies though.  Thanks!

This is my husband's favourite cookie.  I boil the cocoa sugar butter and milk mixture in a saucepan until the bubbles get smaller;about 2 minutes.  It makes for a nicely set cookie

Great recipe.  My family has food allergies and this recipe is a favorite for all of us.  We also like using dark cocoa sometimes for a deeper flavor. And, on occasion will add coconut as well.

I liked how it hardened, but I would change how much oatmeal to add. Instead of 3 cups of oatmeal I would probably try 2 1/2, or just 2. Other than that pretty good

Excellent recipe. I actually bought a candy thermometer just for this recipe. That made all the difference. 235F for FIVE minutes, not one minute. Turned out perfectly! Plus, after adding the oats and stirring them in, I added 2 oz of finely chopped walnuts. Tasty :)

The flavor was great(I used more cocoa, though)
But it needed to cook more. They never really set up, but I'd still prefer a sticky cookie to a dry crumbly one.

This is a recipe from my childhood that I was looking for!  It turned out perfect for me, thanks to the advice from nicks_sister about making sure the sugar mixture was "soft-ball".  

The only changes I made were to half the recipe and also adding a bit more oatmeal because I love them that way.  I  also used regular oats, since I didn't have quick oats and they came out just fine.

These were delicious. It's great to have a GF and nut-free option. The only change I made was to increase the cocoa (I used 5 Tbs rather than 3) because I like them REALLY chocolate-y.

This type of cookie is always hit or miss with me...  I made them at Christmas time and they were dry little hockey pucks, with peanut butter too.  This time I was out of peanut butter so I used this recipe and they turned out perfect.  Best of luck to you!

First time making these and they turned out really good! 
It's true that you have to get the sugar to the right stage in order for these to set properly (should form a small ball or "glob" when placed in cold water) - I'm glad I read the reviews beforehand. 
It definitely took more than 5 minutes of boiling, although I wasn't going by time. I just kept testing the sugar until it was ready.
I made the whole thing in one pot, added a touch more cocoa and then spooned them onto a lined baking tray, let them sit for a while and then put them in the fridge. 
The mixture left in the pot started to dry out, so I added a bit of hot water and when that wasn't helping, I tried peanut butter. That second tray (batch) turned out alright too, they were much softer and chewy, yet still held up.
Will definitely make these again!

Only change was boiling for five minutes instead of one minute. I think it needs a little more cocoa but otherwise they were very good and set up well.

You HAVE to use real butter.  These are cookies/candies - can't use anything less than the guilt-producing butter they were born for!!  Also, you MUST boil the sugar/butter/milk mixture a FULL minute or they won't set up at all.  Delish!!!

Love! Exact recipe I've used since I was a kid. No changes. No problem with them setting up. Sure, they are a little runny at first, but let them cool for about 30 minutes and they're perfect. I've never liked them with peanut butter, so this is my go to recipe. Easy and my husband's favorite. Win/Win! :)

So I screwed this recipe up the first time, and almost did the second too. Here's what I learned:
Don't use baking calculators to increase the recipe. This is not a baking recipe. 
Don't use whole milk unless you reduce the amount of butter (I have no idea on the amount to reduce by).
If it comes out runny after adding the oats, put the whole thing back on heat. You won't be able to salvage it completely, but doing this will allow you to at least make a very sticky cookie and not a runny mess. Keep stirring the mix to keep it from burning.
If it's dry after adding the oats, add a bit of milk, this WILL salvage the recipe and make perfectly normal cookies.
Don't use steel cut oats accidentally.
Cook the sugar on HIGH heat and keep stirring. If you do medium because you're cautious like me about burning, the whole process will take three times as long because the sugar won't get the consistency you need otherwise.

The recipe does not include that you should leave the cookies on the wax paper until they harden into cookies: We waited about 20 minutes with some of the cookies but left the others on the wax paper overnight and they formed cookies.

I made this recipe with me preschool class,  we heated the butter, sugar and milk in the microwave for 3 mins. then I stirred it and boiled it for another 1 min. they came out great. I let the kids decorate them with small candies. the kids loved them, they were very excited.  I thought they tasted a bit like fudge with oats.

This is a great recipe!  The cookies set up perfectly, and this was great for my first time making these cookies.  I don't like peanut butter, so this was good for me.  I've probably only made 15 things by myself in my entire life, so  if I can make it, anybody can.

Easy peasy! I made these for my daughter's kindergarten snack day. One of her classmates has a peanut allergy and this was one of the few recipes that omitted the peanut butter. I had no problems with the consistency of the cookies (read the other reviews- I put the mixture on high heat and boiled for a little over a minute AFTER the mixture reached a hard boil.) They taste great!

I liked how the recipe on here is but when i made it the first time it did not harden like they are supposed to so the next time i made it i  got a tablespoon and pulled a tablespoon of the milk out of the cup of milk. it worked perfect.

I was looking for this recipe as my mom used to make it all the time... glad i finally found it!  and no peanut butter so it's nice if you're worried about allergies.

This is my family recipe (which I had lost so was looking for a match) except that we double the cocoa - sooooo much better with lots of chocolate taste - and we add one cup of coconut.  So easy and ready quickly!  (plus it's even delicious to eat the warm scrapings from the pot when you've finished spooning it out into cookies.  Yum)

Good recipe, reminds me of what I had as a child!  I used splenda (1/2 of sugar amount) + some honey, used part coconut oil with butter and substituted part coconut for the oats (total 2 cups, not 3).  They did not set up, I am not sure if it is because I did not cook it long enough or because I made some changes, it still satisfied my chocolate sweet tooth!  Thanks for posting, I made one recipe that added peanut butter, but that was not what my family made, we used this recipe.

I made this recipe for the first time this weekend. It came out perfect! The cookies set and were delicious. I brought the mix to a boil and then boiled for an additional minute stirring constantly and then removed from heat and added the remaining ingredients. I also used fat free lactose milk and it made no difference. They were still delicious.

I use the can milk, and a good dollop of Peanut Butter.  Pecans are optional as well.  They are delicious. And crowd pleasers as well.

no peanut butter that is good. but see these cookie are generally tooo soft. so i add a minute well now to hard and crumbled. no matter which receipe i use its too soft or too hard. and i would NEVER use instant oatmeal. i dont want to die. so if u are going to eat oatmeal you mizwell eat real oatmeal. makes no difference in cooking making.

Very easy to make. I did follow the suggestions to boil a bit longer than a minute, about 2. They set great and quickly in the freezer. They are delicious, though a tad sweet. Great recipe!

I had a great guy friend make this recipe and it didn't turn out right the first time following the directions to the T. The directions were misleading in that you have to bring the mixture to what we ladies call a "rolling boil" for about 4 to 5 minutes before it will actually set up right. That is, it bubbles all the way through the pot from the outside in. We boiled it constantly stirring for about 5 minutes. If it does get dry as you stir it before spooning it out, add about 3 oz of hot water to it to make it softer. Also, we added about 2 extra teaspoons of cocoa to make it more chocolatie. His first experience ended up in the frig to set, and they did a day later. So, just a little more boiling and more cocoa and this recipe rocks! Overall, very tasty recipe.

I added a bit more cocoa and some more oats.  Bf said they were dryer than his grandmother's but otherwise were spot on.  I suppose next time I won't add the extra oats.  Very easy, and I let the mixture boil for 2 minutes like other reviewers.  I didn't like them, but I don't like no bake cookies as a rule anyway.  Bf gets to rate these.  :o)Thanks for the recipe!

Worst Recipe I have ever used.  I've been makin no bakes for years and I couldnt find my recipe so looked for one to replace.. I've tried making these over and over again thinking I may have done something different, but they never come out right. The chocolate doesn't even taste right... Guess I'm going to have to look for one to replace this.

My cookies didn't set right at all... They are far to dry and crumbly. Perhaps I did over boil the sugar mixture, but one minute just did't seem long enough.

i very rarely post a negative review but im sorry to say that although i followed this recipe exactly, it turned into a gooey, yucky, mess! so many sent in good reviews so maybe i did something wrong(cant imagine what). sorry but everything had to go into the trash - we couldnt even pick them up - they were like glue!

good flavor, of course I doubled the vanilla (but I do that in ALL my recipes, yumm!) I did boil for three minutes, maybe should have stopped at 2.5, a little crumbly, but not bad.  overall, pretty good, I'll probably use this recipe again!

I made this cookie tonight because hubby wanted something sweet. The cookie is great except for the amount of Oats I had to use 4 1/2-5 C. of oats vs. the 3 in the recipe. I also used just a tad more vanilla for taste, cocoa was almost to overwhelming, I will use less next time. All in all a great recipe. Thank you

In all my years of cooking I have never made No Bake cookies.  Needing a snack to bring to Cub Scouts, I decided to give these a try.    I almost botched the recipe as I was doubling it and left out 1/2 of the sugar.  I noticed as it was boiling it didn't thicken up as expected with candy.  Then it hit me...need more sugar.    I deleted 1 cup of Oatmeal in the double batch and added 2 cups of Crispy Rice cereal.  Then I tossed peanut butter chips at the last minute (so they wouldn't melt) and they turned out fabulous.    Thanks for the recipe!

I gave this a 4 b/c my kids loved them. I agree with some others that the sugar could be reduced and cocoa increased.  It's very much like old-fashioned fudge in it's flavor and consistency (minus oatmeal of course), and like fudge, mine set up very quickly - before I had half the cookies on a tray!  So I ended up with a bowl of "crumbles", which taste yummy, but are not cookies!  I think I'll use them for yogurt toppings!  I'm sure we'll make these again, with a few adjustments.

WOW!! I didn't think I could make no bake cookies without peanut butter. I was craving them and was out of peanut butter. so I looked for recipes and this worked great. I will try to boil longer next time, maybe they will set up better.

These were very easy to make, only I couldn't get them to set on the counter. I had to put them in the fridge for about a half hour and they set in there just fine. I don't like no bake cookies but my husband was very happy with them. Big smiles.

this is the best recipe that i have found for these cookies. i love them but have become allergic to all forms of nuts and nut oils so i cant use the peanut butter in the normal recipe. these have turned out really great for me and i have made them a few times now.

I have always used the recipe my mom handed down to me and I could never get the cookies to harden.  I tried this one tonight and they firmed up very quickly and are really good.  My mom's recipe has been replaced! I followed the ingredients exactly and didn't have any problems at all.  I will use this one again and again.  Very quick and easy.

Mmmmm...... Yummy!!!!!
If u dont have the vanilla essence, dont worry. i made it without, and the results were very popular at home anyway! I would recommend not adding quite as much cocoa as it says in the recipe, because they are very strong!!

This is the best!!! I was talking to a childhood friend and we were remembering the old days and this is exactly the one we used...I couldn't remember "how muchs" of everything and when I read this this was it...Love it, and I put them in the freezer for about 8 - 10 minutes and they are wonderful...For a change sometimes we would add 1 cup of shredded coconut and it would be taste along the lines of a mounds or almond joy...Thanks so much, I have been looking for this for awhile and I knew the ones I saw, although very good, were not the one I had made as a kid...
THIS IS THE ONE!!!! Thanks for sharing and giving back a piece of my childhood...I actually emailed this to the bunch of us that used to make them and they are aall so thrilled, some have children and will be passing it down to them as well...Have a Wonderful Day and Happy Cooking!!! Terri

These are the easiest treat I know how to make. I can get my boyfriend to do ANYTHING if I offer them in exchange. When adding the peanutbutter, I stir well, to ensure a very creamy texture. THEN add the quick oats and vanilla... PERFECT!

It needed more chocolate flavor, the 2 cups of white sugar ended up making the cookies grainy and tasteless

This is one of the easiest cookie recipes I have ever tried! Not only easy, but very delicious. I make these once a month or more, my family loves them!

These cookies are fantastic!  I've been eating them on special occasions since I was a little girl.  The family just loves them.

Yuumy! Just like my grandma makes! This is excellent with peanut butter and/or chopped nuts as well. To the reviewer that said she/he had to scoop it off the pan: You must boil the mixture for a full minute or it will be a runny mess (although a yummy mess!)
