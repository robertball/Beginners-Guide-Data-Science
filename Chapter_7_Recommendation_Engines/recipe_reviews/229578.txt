I've never used a sweet potato in a smoothie before, but we all thought this was crazy good.  I microwaved the sweet potato, peeled it, and then put in the freezer along with a banana for about an hour.  They were chilled, but not frozen, so I added some crushed ice to the blender.  I used Silk light vanilla almond milk (which I like for cereal) and served this with a dollop of whipped cream sprinkled with cinnamon.  With the addition of the ice, this was enough for three of us for lunch today.  Really enjoyed this.

I used regular lowfat milk instead of soy and I added a touch of brown sugar and pure vanilla extract. I was surprized, this was actually quite good and the kids liked it, too.

I think just about any fruit or vegetable like this can be blended with a banana and turn out well. I followed the recipe exactly at first. The only change I made was halving the recipe and using frozen banana. I thought it was fine but kind of reminded me somewhat of a thick pumpkin pie filling before it is cooked. So, I tweaked it to taste. I threw the other half of the banana in the blender, added a splash of vanilla, and 4 ice cubes for half the recipe. I got 2 servings. I did do the microwaving the day before. The 10 minutes was accurate with my microwave. I also tried the smoothie with or without the whipped topping garnish and it was fine either way.

I actually came up with this idea on my own and just looked it up after to see if anybody else had. I made mine with coconut milk instead of Soy and it was DELICIOUS! The only reason I rated it 3 was because I don't think it would taste very good with soy. You can also add a tablespoon of coconut flour as a protein powder to this. PS I wonder how this would taste heated as a hot drink with pumpkin spice and maybe a dash of rum...

I love this recipe! My family thought I was crazy for making it. With the sweetness of the ingredients, it surprisingly tasted like pumpkin pie filling. Even a small amount of this smoothie kept me full for hours. Will definitely make again!

This was fantastic!  I did alter it slightly - no milk on hand.  I used vanilla almond milk and pumpkin pie spice rather than just cinnamon.  I also added 6 ice cubes to make it frostier.  The best smoothie I think I've ever had!

Just tried this smoothie.  I used a frozen banana and low fat milk instead of soy and used a little honey.  Not bad even hubby said it was good.

This was overall very good, and healthy!  I peeled my sweet potato and then cut it up and boiled it.  Ready in 7 minutes.  I like my smoothies more thick, so I used 1/2 c. of almond milk and a 1 c. of ice.  You can also add your protein powder or flaxseed.  If you have a sweet tooth, top with some whip cream.

I would have never thought to use a sweet potato in a smoothie but it turned out delicious! Getting my vitamin A and potassium in one drink-fabulous.

It works with sweet potato too. I had made a loaf of bread and had sweet potato left over and added vanilla extract and it was pretty good and it fill you up super quick.

This smoothie makes me feel as though I'm eating healthy and getting my veggies in for breakfast! I froze the banana and used skim milk. I felt it needed a sweetener of some kind, so I added Splenda to mine.

Simple and filling.  Pre-cooking sweet potatos for the week is a great way to have a sweet, healthy snack.  This was a new way for me to include them.

My son thought it tasted like drinking pancake batter through a straw and I thought it tasted like that barium stuff they make you drink before a Cat Scan.  Needless to say I won't make this one again.

This was pretty good! The texture was a little strange, but I am not a fan of fresh bananas in smoothies because they are slimy and feel creepy in my mouth. Next time, I'll freeze the banana. That texture is usually more agreeable to me. I will also add some vanilla for a little umph. It was just a touch bland.

I cubed and boiled some sweet potatoes, bagged them up and put in the freezer for future smoothies. 
I made this smoothie with some sweet potatoe, a banana, ceylon cinnamon and kefir. It was delishious. Ive also made one with some spinash  and pineapple in it as well.

My boyfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by this smoothie recipe. We followed the recipe exactly and it tasted absolutely delicious! I'm even more impressed that we didn't have to add any sweetener because the flavor was so good on its own. If you haven't had roasted sweet potato blended in a smoothie, I highly recommend it!

I like my smoothies cold; so I added a cup of ice in place of a cup of almond milk. I also added pumpkin spice and used Okinawan sweet potatoes.

Made this with whole milk and I thought it was super tasty. Plus, I used purple sweet potatoes, so the shake was a pretty light purple color. Not very sweet and a perfect way to start the day.

It was pretty good that I actually made it twice in one day! I picked this recipe for my Daniel Fast this month. My grandmother like it but we prefer much colder before serving though....

P.S. I added a few drops of pure vanilla extract and added less soy milk in mine.

I made this this morning and it turned out great! I added chia seeds and half of a carrot for some extra nutrients and it didn't seem to affect the taste at all. I'll definitely make this again!
