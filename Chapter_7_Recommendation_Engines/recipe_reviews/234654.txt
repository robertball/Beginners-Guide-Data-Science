OMG! This recipe is so delicious so hard not to have more because I am counting my calories. If I wasn't I would eat about three bowls that's how delicious it is. I thought it was strange with bread and eggs etc. but it's delicious. It actually taste a lot like pineapple upside down cake.YUM!!!

I really had my doubts, but this was amazing! I took it to a friend's for a dinner side dish, then wished I hadn't so I could have eaten more of it myself. I used a greased 8x8 pan and baked it about 40 minutes.  I have celiac disease, so I used 6 slices of canyon bakehouse gf bread instead of 5. (Gluten free bread slices run small) I also added an extra egg since gluten free baking does best with more egg too. I kept everything else the same ingredient-wise, but I did mix the butter in with everything instead of pouring on top. It was on the sweet side but not too sweet for me or my friend and her family. It would still have been good with a quarter cup less sugar, and maybe a touch more pineapple. I may try those changes the next go round. I will definitely be making this again!

Delicious and so easy! I wasn't sure how this would turn out. The baked pineapple I grew up with did not use bread. I was pleasantly surprised. We all loved it and this recipe will be part of my favorite recipe list. I did not make any changes to the original recipe.

Quick easy treat. I added a little granola because I like more texture.

I used half the sugar and used half and half instead of milk only because i had it on hand. It came out quite grease so next time i will not use near the butter recommended(I cut that too). All in all this is a wonderful recipe i cant decide if its a breakfast, dessert or side. Its super easy to make. and mmmm mmmmm so so good. Its kind of like a pineapple bread pudding. So so very good. Will definitely make it again. Easy tasty and cheap. Cant get better than that.

Awesome recipe! I did change it a little though. I didn't have anymore vanilla extract so I used hazelnut extract instead. Instead of milk I used heavy whipping cream just cause I love that rich flavor. Then after baking for 30min at 350 degrees I broiled it to caramelize the crust and it came out so good! It tasted like a pineapple cobbler! It really doesnt look appetizing but I found some of the best tasting foods look gross lol But ill definitely make it again. Ill probably try some more variations on it to make it look more appetizing but even if I can't make it look more appealing Im still gonna continue to make it! Thank you for this recipe!

Very good but very rich. i doubled the recipe and the full stick of butter was still a little much. I would only do half of a stick next time. All in all a great dish and would make again!
