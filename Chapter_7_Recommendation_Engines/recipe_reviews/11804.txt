I made this recipe, but I added two cloves of garlic to the butter at the beginning and added two sliced chicken breasts.  I served it over bow tie pasta and it was wonderful!

Yum! Just finished eating this, lol and I'm stuffed. This sauce was great! I added some thin sliced chicken breasts which I sauteed in butter and garlic to the sauce after it was done and it was excellent!

This is a quick and easy sauce to make for a weeknight (or Friday night) supper. I added loads of shitake mushrooms (they're less than $1 a pound here in Japan!) and some green beans and doubled the entire recipe so I could freeze some leftovers. To make it a bit more healthful, I skipped the butter and made it in olive oil -- the canned soups contain plenty of cream and fat for this sauce. I like peppy sauces so I added two cloves of garlic. Went nicely served over bowtie pasta.

I made this sauce and used it as a dipping sauce for steak and chicken fondue.  We had company and it was very well received by everyone.  I followed another person's advice and added about 1/4 c. marsala wine.

Followed others and made some changes too.  Sauteed chicken with garlic and butter, added some "Italian" herbs, salt, pepper, and worcestshire sauce.  In a baking dish, placed sauce over cooked rigatoni pasta and covered with shredded cheese.  Baked for about 1/2 hour.  Very tasty.  Cook once, eat twice.

I have never given a bad review since I usually figure it's just a difference in taste buds rather than a bad recipe...having said that, this was gross. The only change I made was to add garlic to my saute. I like all the ingredients in the recipe, and I like the idea of it but it really didn't work. It just tasted like cream of chicken soup with some vege, which makes sense since that is what it is. Oh well, you win some you lose some. Thank you for the idea anyway. Back to the drawing board.

This was perfect.  I was looking for something to put on rice.  I boiled some chicken, shredded it and added it to the pan after the mushrooms and onions were done cooking.  Perfect!!

Love this - I used FF half and half.  Doubled the recipe and the next night added carmelized onions, chopped raw celery and frozen peas.  Added more half and half and some sour cream to thin.  Added chopped chickan and Viola Chicken ala King!!

In addition to all of the other ingredients, I added 1/2 cup of orange bell pepper (just because I had some in the fridge), 2 cloves of garlic, and a pinch of cayenne (we like spicy). My family devoured it.

Maybe it's just me but it wasn't as great as I expected.  I did use condensed mushroom soup with roasted garlic... could that be why?  I also used some cheap mushrooms... maybe that's it?  

Anyway, it definitely was good (the husband loved it), but it's not going to be a regular around here.

This goes really well over garlic chicken.  It also works as a left-over, cut up and on fettuccine noodles.  It's marvelous!

This is an excellent sauce. i didn't have any peppers in the house so I made it without and it was delicious. I can hardly wait to try it with the peppers. Thanks for a great tasting easy recipe.

When looking for veggies to use up, I came across this. I doubled the recipe exactly & I followed to a T in the beginning. But because I doubled the recipe...there was a lot of butter in this. I drained some of it before adding the soup and milk. The one thing I found after I mixed in the soup and milk...was that, there was more bell peppers then mushrooms and the flavor was the same.. Nice but not mushroom sauce because the peppers overwhelm the flavor the mushrooms. Plus it was extremely "soupy" or liquidy. So because I still had more then half a 16oz container left of sliced bellas, I used the excess butter I poured off in the beginning and saute'd the rest of the mushrooms and added them to the sauce. This helped with the overall flavor and allowed the recipe to be combined quite nicely with a package of gluten-free penne pasta. My girls loved loved it, as the end result. Will make again doubled and using an entire 16oz of mushrooms.

This recipe was great and easy to make. It definitely needs to be seasoned to your taste though. I added garlic, salt, and pepper and it really set it off. I also added shrimp to it.

This was a very versatile, flavorful sauce.  I changed the recipe to change my tastes -- I sauteed 16oz of fresh sliced baby bella mushrooms and 3 cloves of garlic with the butter and onions.  I omitted the peppers due to personal tastes, and substituted golden cream of mushroom soup.  The result was a heartier sauce -- beefy with the portabellas and a deep flavor with the golden variety of cream of mushroom.  I served over dumpling-size egg noodles, and it was reminiscent of beef stroganoff without the beef.  I will definitely make again to serve over meats, or even enjoy the sauce alone as a thick, velvety mushroom soup.

Excellent.  I have used it over steak, lamb, pork, chicken , pasta.  Just about everything it is great.  I only cook for 3-4 most of the time, but I make the enitre recipe and even my son who hates mushrooms will eat it and use bread to get all of the juice.  Thanks for this great recipe!!!

Man, this was soooo good. I'd give this more stars if I could. I switched out the milk and used cream cheese and that just made this sauce over the top. I also added a couple cloves of garlic just cause I'm a big fan of it. Served over some spaghetti noodles. Chicken or shrimp would be a good addition. Will make this again and again....

This was an easy recipe, and the flavor was good. I served it over breaded chicken breasts. 
I think this sauce is fine for an everyday meal, but for a sit down dinner, I'd reccommend something more subtle.

Great! While cooking the sauce, I added chicken breasts cut in dices, and kept in the heat for a little while longer, to allow the chicken to cook; I then served it over spaghetti. it was easily transformed into a main dish!

I'm a beginner cook and a vegetarian and this sauce worked well for me! I used onion, bell pepper, celery, and tofu and replaced the cream of chicken soup with cream of celery soup. Delicious :)

Quick, easy mushroom sauce.  I sauteed a couple of cloves of garlic first, but it was still a little bland.  Could use "something" more to pep it up a bit.  All in all a good recipe though!  Will make again!

Pretty good.  I followed the recipe except I couldn't find a red bell pepper and had to use a yellow one.  Good, not great.  I wouldn't serve this to company but I would make it again for a quick meal.

I was a little disappointed in this recipe. I could hardly taste the mushrooms or the other vegetables in it, just mostly the cream of chicken taste.. I followed the recipe exactly, maybe less soup and more veggies would make it tastier.

This is a fantastic sauce.  I created a "white lasagna" that I used this with.  Included Ricotta, Spinach, Artichokes and Black Olives.  Layered as normal, and used this sauce to cover the lasagna, and it was out of this world!  Thanks for a great sauce!

Great simple recipe!  Must try this recipe with Cream of Mushroom soup instead of Cream of Chicken soup and a mix of oyster, shiitake and porcini mushrooms on linguine!

Thanks for sharing this one Karen - it was great!  I served it over egg noodles and my family gobbled it up!  I think I'll add more mushrooms next time and cut back on the green peppers - but more for my personal taste.  Very good, very easy and very quick to make!

this was a great sauce to use in lasagne type recipes which call for a white sauce or Alfredo.  I used in in a spinach cheese lasagne recipe and it improved my recipe.  thanks.

I like this sauce. I utilized Cream of Celery soup instead because that's what I had on hand. I thought about using Crm of Mushroom, but decided against it for a "lighter" taste. Worked just fine.  I also used fat-free half-n-half instead of milk, which added a richness without heaviness (and it's what I had in my frig).  Overall you will not be disappointed with this recipe if you use it as is or with your own twists.

I added the garlic that other people have suggested.  I like all the veggies in the sauce.  If I make it again, I'll probably add more spices or perhaps some wine, oyster sauce, or soy sauce for more flavour.  I found this meal a bit bland.

This is very good for a quick and easy weeknight dish.  Used cream of mushroom soup to keep it vegetarian.  Left out the bell peppers (didn't have any) and added extra mushrooms.  Served over cheese ravioli and it was very good!

Excellent served over fettucine pasta and cubed fried tofu. I ended up putting way more mushrooms (baby bella and shiitake) and garlic in there though, because it seemed to need more. The green and red peppers made the dish not only tastier but more beautiful. Will definitely make it again.

This is the first time that I have cooked mushrooms. I have had mushroom sauce's in the past, but this one is just outstanding! WOW, I used it over rice and a thinly sliced petite loin steak with a garlic rub. It makes a perfect combination. My family loved it so much that they didn't talk during the meal.

I made this sauce to pour over some thick steaks that I had covered in course black pepper and grilled the way we like them (very rare). I used some sliced portabella and brown mushrooms as well as some white to add some uniqueness to it. It was perfect!

Excellent!  I don't know about you, but I get tired of red sauce all the time.  This is a wonderful sauce for just about anything.  My husband and I LOVE mushrooms, while my son and brother can't stand them.  So, I minced the mushrooms very fine and all ate it.  I would have preferred larger bits, but it was still excellent.  Good job Karen...

This was great!  I had a bag full of morels I wasn't sure what to do with, so I used them in this sauce.  I used dry sherry instead of milk and added some garlic powder.  Definitely a keeper.

This was really yummy....I just served it over cooked noodles. I have also added in some cooked chicken to make it a bit heartier.
