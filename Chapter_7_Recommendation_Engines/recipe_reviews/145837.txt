Delicious! I baked mine, as no grill or campfire was available, and still ended up with a melt-in-your mouth fish that was so good I even ate the skin, something I don't usually do. I'll definitely make this again!

We didn't have a whole trout, so I used two fillets and put them together, skin side out. This worked great. Also, didn't have fresh spices, so used dried and sprinkled it on the fish. Fish was flavorful but not overwhelming in flavor.

This was very good and the trout came out so moist it melted in our mouths.  I did not add parsley or the chopped rosemary.  I didn't want the rosemary to overkill.  I seasoned with a little garlic salt and seasoned salt and the flavor was so good.

This is the second time I have attempted to make Trout, well I altered it just A little, on a grill pan, seasoned with a non-stick coating put the whole trout stuffed with lemon and onions etc. right on the flames. Timing for me is by look, When the outer coat is nice and brown and you can see that the trout is done then go ahead and take it off the grill pan, I know clean up isn't that easy, need to let the pan soak, but the Trout is awesome,  Made a Dill Sauce to top the Trout, The only advantage I have is that I live in Az. we can always Grill!

I didn't have any fresh rosemary or parsley, so I used dried, and I didn't have a lemon.  I melted the butter and stirred in 3tbsp lemon juice, added the dried rosemary, parsley , added minced garlic, and poured over the fish.  It was easy and awesome!

This was good, but I thought it was missing something. Even though rosemary is a strong herb the taste of the fish seemed to overwhelm it (maybe because my fish were so fresh?). I think that next time I'll add a bit of onion powder. That might do the trick. Don't get me wrong, though--good trout recipe!

This recipe is perfect! Made it "as is" and used fresh caught Montana Rainbow Trout and it was delicious! I will grill trout this way for now on.

First time I've made fish this way, and I was very pleased with how easy and good it was.  I don't know if this has happened to anyone else, but the skin stuck to the foil when I pulled the foil off, and I considered that a plus.  I used lime and varied the herbs a bit (replaced rosemary with winter savory).

I felt that the rosemary and lemon flavors melded perfectly with the trout in this recipe.  The timing on the grill was also ideal.  Easy, tasteful, and a showy presentation.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this for a big outdoor party and was very pleased with it.  I did substitute chardonnay and olive oil instead of using butter.  I'd make it again for sure.

Very tasty!  Only changes I made:
- sprayed the foil with non-stick baking spray before putting the fish on it to keep it from sticking 
- cooked on a propane grill at medium high heat for about 10 minutes w/o flipping it
- I only had dried parsley, so used about 1/4 of what the recipe called for in fresh herbs. I think this could be increased because parsley has such a light flavor. 

This is my new favorite trout recipe!  Flavorful but it doesn't overpower the fish.

This recipe was simple and delicious. Our neighbors gave us some fresh caught trout which I had no idea how to cook.  Allrecipies to the rescue!  Wrapping each fish in its own packet worked out well as they varied greatly in size, and thus cooking time. There was more than we could eat in one meal so I used the leftovers the next day to make trout salad sandwiches, just adding a bit of mayo. Yummy!

How can you go wrong with fresh trout?  If you do, it's user error.  :).  Our error was that we had truly whole fish and were not able to butterfly them properly.  I suspect it is because we are city folks and not familiar with how to filet.  Soooo...it was hard to put all the 'stuff' inside as it kept falling out and then when cooked..lots o bones and mess. We did figure out how to get rid of the spine which helped but the recipe did not say to cut the fins or tail so we left them on which caused some angst in the form of more bones.  Bottom line - taste was great but I would have preferred proper filets.  Used fresh herbs from my garden including dill, cilantro and rosemary.  Delicious but watch those bones!

We used fresh rainbow trout caught in twin lakes colorado. It was really good, and my friends were very happy with it. It was also easy!
