I love, love, LOVE this simple recipe! In the summer, we do a lot a "cold noodle salad" dishes - too warm to eat anything otherwise ~ and when I stumbled upon this recipe, I couldn't wait to try it! A twist between a noodle salad and a lettuce salad! You can use a variety of "seasoning" for the chicken (lemon pepper, old bay, etc..) and still be amazing.  In addition to the cheese, I shredded some carrots, diced some celery, and sprinkled parmesan overall. Also nice is that each individual can choose their dressing: French, Ranch, Cesar, Raspberry Vingerette, etc... To top it off is that is light but filling meal - perfect for summer evenings! Thanks for the keeper!

Easy, delicious recipe, and simple to adjust to your specific tastes. I pan fried the chicken with steak seasoning instead of grilling, added cubed cheddar and pepper jack cheeses instead of mozzarella. I also added 1/3 cup light mayo mixed with 1/3 cup Italian dressing and poured over all. It makes plenty for leftovers,(only two of us) and I add the shredded lettuce right before serving, so the leftover lettuce doesn't get soggy. Thanks for the great tip of adding steak seasoning on chicken! Will make this again and again!

This is a wonderful salad, my husband would not eat cold pasta salad, but after me asking him to just "try" this loves it and asks me to make it again and again! We use our own dressings that we like and I make it up in a large tupperware container and it lasts 4 or 5 days!

Great easy fast recipe. Some changes/additions: Use multi-color rotini- presents better. I also used garlic jack cheese instead of mozzarella and added olives and red bell peppers. I think the salad would taste better without the lettuce though. I used lettuce but did not mix with the salad..used as a 'bed of lettuce'.

This recipe was really tasty.  I used Monterey pepperjack cheese instead of mozarella and it was wonderful.  It added some spice to the dish.  I will definately make this again.

Since asparagas is in season I used one bunch of spring/baby asparagas; cut into 1" pieces and put in pasta water a minute before pasta was done cooking. I varied from Step 4 a bit so I can use as leftovers. In large bowl I put everything but the lettuce, added extra tomatoes and about 1/4 c asian ginger low fat salad dressing. Tossed then mixed only one serving with chopped romaine. Very tasty and it keeps well for a few days.

A winner!  I used a roasted chicken from the market and cut up the white meat and prepared the pasta ahead of time but drizzled some olive oil on it to keep it moist.  When I assembled the salad, I also added some carrots and artichokes.  I chose Newman's Own Olive Oil & Vinegar dressing.  We took it out on our boat for an evening picnic and it was a hit with everyone and it traveled well.  The romaine lettuce was a good choice since it doesn't wilt easily like iceberg lettuce.  Seconds were requested!  I had some leftovers and it was just as good if not better a day later!

I love that you can play around with this recipe and that the ingredients are items I always have on hand. I used tri-colored rotini, cubed cheddar cheese, shredded parm cheese, and scallions in place of the onions. Also used more tomatoes than it called for. Top with your favorite dressing, delicious!

Like a glorified garden salad, but the chicken was really good with the steak seasoning.  Better than with chicken seasoning, that's for sure.  I might try this with a homemade spicy ranch dressing recipie I got from Bon Appetit.  I added bell pepper, carrots and scallions as well, and grilled the chicken in my grill pan since it's still a little cold (40 degrees?) to grill in Alaska.  Didn't add onion to my salad, though, since I don't care for them raw.  Pretty quick and easy dish, and very filling!  I'll be making it again.

This is one of those great recipes that you can play around with and make it to suit your specific taste. I love how versatile that this recipe can be also; it can be a ladies lunch or a summer supper. Different pastas also help set the tone. Delicious and refreshing!

A very good fresh idea for salad... filling but light. I added spinach, because I didn't have a full head of lettuce and tossed in a little sun-dried tomato dressing as well. Will make again for sure.

This is delicious! I added a little zesty italian dressing to it. (Really dry without something on there!) I also added cucumber, black olive slices, artichoke hearts and red bell pepper, diced, with pepper jack cheese, as suggested in another review. Big favorite with the family now. Made it twice in one week! What a great way to have a lite healthy dinner.

I added 1 cup of chopped, boiled mushrooms, and substitued the Mozarella for Cheddar (as I forgot to buy Mozzarella!!). This was good, It was light and filling. It's nice to have a recipe with no mayo for a change! :-)

This is one of my favorite meals. I toss it with a homemade honey mustard vinaigrette. This recipe is very open to variations. You can add Parmesan instead of mozerella, you can add basil or spinach leaves, and you can try different marinades and seasonings on the chicken.

I really loved this salad. What I loved most was the steak seasoning on the chicken breast.  Why did'nt I ever think to do that?  It was super good.  I took a shortcut and used Tyson grilled precooked chicken breasts and it was delicious. Great salad!

Instead of rubbing steak seasoning on the chicken, I cooked it in a pepper steak sauce.  Once the chicken and pasta were both cooked, I tossed the pasta in the remaining pepper sauce in the pan before adding it to the salad.  Gave the pasta a fuller flavor. Turned out great!

This was pretty good. It was a nice, light dinner. I added a bunch of things (eggs, olive, etc.) and there were a lot of flavors competing with each other, so maybe next time I won't use so many different ingredients. I used a vinaigrette dressing.

I used lemon/herb spice mix for the chicken and grated the mozzarella but left everything else the same.  It was delicious, I will definitely make this again.

Excellent flavor, great mix of textures, easy to make and pretty to present.  Using left over grilled chicken made preparing the salad super fast.  My husband and I liked it with Italian dressing, my son preferred Caesar.  This salad is yummy as is, but it's so versatile it would be simple to put a personal spin on it.  Next time I make this (and I will make it again), my husband suggested adding some prosciutto.  Perfect summer meal but would also make a good dish to take to a cookout or BBQ.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I added green pepper and used the lettuce as a bed, so it would keep better as leftovers.  My family loved this recipe and it is so easy!  Thank you for sharing.

Very versatile recipe. I used half of a leftover roasted chicken, egg noodles (the only pasta I had in the house!), diced roasted red peppers and some bacon that I cooked and crumbled. It was really great and the kids enjoyed being able to use there favorite salad dressings. It was even better the next day as lunch leftovers!

As written I give this just three stars because it is just weird to serve the chicken and pasta with lettuce.  i think it is much better as a pasta salad.  You can always serve a side green salad.  Without the lettuce it is definitely a five star dish.  Seasoning the chicken with steak seasoning and grilling it really makes this special.

Awesome meal! I cut up my chicken, some of the onions and pan fryed it in a litte olive oil with the steak sauce. 
I then used the sauce from this coat the noodles. This made the noodles very tastey! YUMMY

Excellent recipe! It was very  humid out yesterday and my sons asked for something refreshing.  This dish truly was.  I doubled the recipe for leftovers but nothing was left over.  The only thing I did do was use grape tomatoes whole.  Each of us used our own choice of dressing.  I have already been informed this recipe must be made again soon.

I added chopped baby bella mushrooms and diced red peppers.  I just used leftover grilled chicken, and tri-color rotini and subbed cubed pepper jack for the cheese.  My husband LOVED this recipe and it tasted great leftover.  Adding this one in to the permanent rotation!

I made this last Monday for dinner and ended up having it for three nights in a row. Monday served as main course, Tuesday served alongside a fruit salad, Wednesday served alongside of leftover fruit salad and grilled pork chops. It was fabulous every single time.  This is now my absolute favorite summer pasta salad and will be making it lots.  We used Feta/Oregano low calorie dressing.  What a great salad. Thanks for posting this.

This is so simple it is wild there is a recipe for it! However, it is the perfect combination of ingredients to create a delightful dinner salad! Loved the idea of the pasta to make it a bit more filling without being heavy. I made a vinaigrette, cooked the pasta, tossed it in a tablespoon of the dressing and put it in the fridge to cool while grilling the meat. Then added a touch more dressing to the lettuce combination, tossed in the pasta and laid the sliced meat across the top. I did make this with a New York strip but will make it again with the chicken soon. So easy to customize!

It was a hit with all 4 kids! Added some Italian dressing at the table. I pan fried the chicken instead of grilling. I also used multi-colored rotini and grated mozzarella instead of cubed. Made a double recipe so we would have an easy lunch tomorrow.

It's really up to you how good this dish is.  You choose the seasoning and that's where it all starts.  I used store brand "A1" sauce and Dom Deluise Steak Seasoning, salt and pepper.  I bought pre-cut Romaine to save the time, and put the onions on the side.  I used a very tasty Kraft Brand Light Rasberry Vinegarette Salad Dressing. Kids even loved it!

Love this recipe!  Thought it was sort of strange to add noodles to a salad but added great texture.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.  It was a great lighter summer dinner.

I added a half cup of creamy it. dressing to tie all the flavors together.  Will make this dish again.

This salad required a little addition to make it 5 star, for my taste.  The addition of Balsamic & Virgin Olive Oil.

This salad was excellent!  My children loved the addition of noodles.  It had great flavor.  My husband enjoyed the leftovers for lunch the next day and loved it even more.  This is a keeper that I will be making over and over.

I made a roasted red bell pepper dressing and this salad complimented the dressing very well.  I did not have steak seasoning so I used italian seasonings instead.

I made this recipe according to the directions, but we are an a Italian family and love olives, so I added 8 sliced green olives. I also put in green pepper and sliced celery. I make my own Italian dressing and used that. My husband thought it was excellent and I now have another good recipe in which I can use the extra cooked chicken breasts. We will enjoy this recipe often this coming summer.

Well for being so simple this was VERY GOOD. I knew we'd be strapped for time on Monday night so I grilled the chicken and boiled the noodles on Sunday. The chicken was so juicy. I grilled it with dry rosemary and garlic rub and let it rest. I stored it whole in the fridge and sliced before serving. I added a bit of olive oil to the noodles to keep them from sticking. Nice Monday night meal.
