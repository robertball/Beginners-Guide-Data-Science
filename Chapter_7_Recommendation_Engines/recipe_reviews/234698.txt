Sorry, this didn't really work for us. The chicken was moist enough but the flavour was lacking. Thanks for sharing Samantha.

Me and my hubby loved this! I marinated it 24 hours in the fridge. Used my cast iron skillet and we put it over baked potato! Would make it again.

Absolutely delicious!  I gradually added the honey until it suited my taste.   Why it had to be cooked in the oven I do not know.  It wasn't at all necessary, so I didn't.  Much quicker and convenient on top of the stove.

The cooking instructions were spot on.  The sauce was delicious.  I browned in my cast iron pan so the meat released quickly.  I coated the chicken in salt, pepper, garlic powder and curry powder.  Everything else was followed as instructed.  Thank you!

If I would have stopped the recipe after cooking the chicken on the stove it would have been fine, but I added the other ingredients and ruined it. it never became a sauce, just a muddy mess.

This was a hit, but there was no heat. I did seed the pepper, so perhaps next time add another or leave seeds on. Based on our personal preference, I reduced the honey in half. Also thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch.
