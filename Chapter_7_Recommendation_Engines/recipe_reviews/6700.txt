This recipe was rather easy for a bread recipe and made good bread.  There was no way that we could eat 6 loaves of bread before they went bad so after I let the dough rise the first time and shaped the loaves I froze the dough.  This was very easy, just once the loaves are shaped cover them in Saran Wrap before they are allowed to rise.  Then freeze them in a ziplock bag.  I've heard that you can keep the dough like this for up to 3 months, but I am really not sure.  When you are ready for a fresh loaf just unwrap the dough and place it in the pan, cover and let rise.  It will take several hours to thaw and rise, but it will.  A very easy way to always have fresh homemafe bread!

I bake bread laboriously every week, sometimes twice a week, and this is the best recipe I've ever used.  It makes great hamburger buns, too, and rolls and the recipe follows exactly like it is written.  I didn't have quick oats, so I used some regular oats that I chopped up in the blender first.  Also recently I omitted the oatmeal and added 1 cup of wheat germ and one cup of wheat bran and about 1/3 extra brown sugar and it's great, too.  This recipe is the best. It's the recipe I've been hunting for. If you have trouble getting your loaves even, just roll the dough out in one long even roll and use a tape measure to measure it into equal pieces and cut it and then roll the pieces into loaves.  You can also rise this dough in the oven by letting the temp. get to 150 and cracking the oven door while you cook and then put an oven mit on the rack, put the dough in a bowl on top of that, cut the oven off and leave it for an hour with the light on.  Rise the loaves the same way cutting a long slit in the tops first and then when they're almost as high as you want, just turn your oven up to 350 and leave them there to bake for 30 minutes (cut 5 min. so the bottoms won't brown too much).  Make sure you leave room at the top of the oven so the loaves don't hit the top.

Wow...this is amazing.  AMAZING.  I had never made bread before, and I didn't have a bread machine OR a large mixer...and it still turned out great!  I kneaded the dough according to the instructions on this site, and I also followed another person's suggestion and used honey in place of the brown sugar.  Perfection!  It makes store-bought bread taste sickening.  My husband and I finished off the first loaf in less than one day!

What an excellent all-purpose sandwich bread! It has such a lovely  texture and delicate taste, no doubt from the oats and brown sugar.

I made the recipe as written but with the following two alterations:

2 cups old-fashioned (rolled) oats in place of the 2 cups quick-cooking oats

9.5 cups all-purpose unbleached flour + 0.5 cup vital wheat gluten in place of the 10 cups of bread flour

Also, I only baked one loaf today... after the first full rise, I shaped the dough into six loaves and stuck five into oiled ziploc freezer bags and put them into my deep freezer. I'll just pull them down as needed, let thaw and rise again, and then bake.

Thanks, J. Drury, for an excellent recipe--I will be making this often.

Just bit into my very first loaf of homemade bread.  Whoa baby, that was good! My 11 year-old loved it too. And it only cost me $2.00 for the entire batch. I buy bulk, it's cheaper. Even the yeast.  NOTE: 3(.25 oz dry active yeast)is equal to 1-1/2 TBSP of dry active yeast,if buying bulk. I froze the other 4 loaves (pre-baked) for later enjoyment.  I melted some butter w/ fresh chopped bay leaves & used it to dip the bread in.

Great recipe. I made it without a mixer or any high tech gadgets, just some elbow grease, a bowl, and an oven. It's my first time ever trying to make bread, and I'm enjoying it now with my coffee! Great recipe.

This is perfect!I've been trying out several recipes for a good home made bread, and several times came out with a so-so result. But this one's the best so far.A real keeper. Had to cut down the recipe for 2 loaves and still came out good.Thanks a lot J. Drury!

I haven't even made this bread and I already am giving it a "5-star" rating just from reading all the reviews!  I have a question and I hope that you experienced bread makers can help me.  I am not very experienced and am lacking in bread making confidence for truly homemade bread, however, I do very well with my 2-pound bread machine.  Question: How can I adapt this recipe to use in a bread machine as far as adding the ingredients?  The method recommended by my machine is to put all liquids in the bottom of the pan followed by the dry ingredients and finally put the yeast on top.  How long would I bake it ie. what setting?  Help!  Thanks, nursela

Delicious, although i always veganize the recipe (I've found both vegan margarin and vegetable oil works instead of butter, and instead of eggs use "Ener-G Egg Replacer", or just 4 tablespoons of water).  Everyone loves the bread, with or without walnuts and chocolate- a bit of brown sugar sprinkled on the top is fun as well.

Oh. My. Goodness. This is the best bread I've ever eaten, let alone made. I couldn't believe that it didn't need to be kneaded, so as I was putting it into the loaf pans I said a few "please be good and please rise" prayers. ;o) Amazing texture and taste and soooo easy to make. If I can make it, you can. Trust me. 

I substituted a few things: used 1/2 olive oil and 1/2 butter for the veg oil (as suggested by other readers), used honey instead of brown sugar, and used unbleached all purpose flour instead of bread flour. Made 2 oversized loaves and 12 hamburger buns (highly recommend making these. Just form dough with floured hands into balls and squish slightly into bun shape. Bake 20 min.)

Thanks so much to the original poster for this recipe. Delish!

Hi J.Drury .. I just subscribed now to write a rate and review for this wonderful bread recipe,a lot of thanks for your mum Elaine and her great generation with their marvelous receipes.I did that bread before, using my lovely kenwood ( my right hand in the kitchen) and never come 6 loaves only 4, but it was so great, and i did it again today and made just 3 loaves but they were huge and fantastic ,in both times i changed the flour and used an organic wholemeal flour (stone ground)and add 2 teaspoons baking powder  because i had informations that it helps with the yeast to make the dough fluffy  also i add 3 tablespoons each :linceed seeds,sunflower seeds,pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, poppy seeds and some dried oregano but the first time i added fresh thyme ,in both times it was marvelous,also i used extra virgin olive oil, i brushed the top with some milk and sprinkled with a mixture of the seeds and oats i used inside it ,and because i am so proud with this recipe i gave it as a gift to my freinds and neighbours and told them its name is Elaine's loaf and ofcourse i said its story ,and today i never buy bread from supermarket which costs me about $6 for the good quality wholemeal loaf with grains. After i bake it, i keep it in the freezer and before use i thaw it little , cut it thin slices with the electrical knife to be as toast and heat it in the toaster.I got some photos for it and i will try to send it on my shared items soon. Once again thanks a lot for mum and all her

I've been making Peasant Bread (from this website) & everyone has loved it, but in an effort to eat healthier, I wanted to find a good whole wheat/grainier bread recipe that would work in my bread machine.  I tried this one today (my machine makes a 2-pound loaf) and it turned out well! Husband likes it better than Peasant Bread. BREAD MACHINE ONE LOAF: 1) Converted recipe down to 24 servings to make one loaf.  2) Mixed together the warm water/dry yeast/bread flour/white sugar in a separate bowl.  3) Placed liquid ingredients, first, in the bread machine (warm water, canola oil, honey instead of brown sugar, & yeast mixture).  4) Mixed together regular whole oats (rather than quick-cooking), wheat flour, salt and added to machine.  5) Recipe for 24 calls for 3-1/3 c bread flour.  Instead I did 1 c whole wheat flour & 2-1/2 c bread flour (I'd read the recipe wrong and added 2-1/2 rather than 2-1/3 but it turned out great!).  Loaf is big and a little crunchy on the outside, soft & light brown inside.  For those of you who have been trying to figure out if this one works in the bread machine, it does!

I've made this bread at least ten times now and it always turns out fantastic-soft, slightly sweet, and wonderfully balanced.  What I like best is that it isn't as dense as so many homemade breads.  I tried freezing four loaves before proofing them a second time and they just never rose quite the way the dough does when fresh.  Instead, I usually make only half the recipe and then make two slightly larger loaves.  Thanks for this excellent recipe!

I like this recipe.  I make it in my Kitchenaid mixer.  It is easy to make substitutions and different variations.  I'll add ground flax seed, and/or a bit of soy flour, sunflower seeds, or just make it with plain white flour. I found that it only makes 4 loaves, in my pans.

Love this recipe.  I usually scale it down to 48 servings and then my 5 quart Kitchen Aid can handle it. I use at least 3 cups of white wheat flour in place of some of the bread flour. I usually make 2 loaves of bread and a pan of monkey bread (grab off balls of dough and roll in butter and cinnamon and sugar, then layer in bundt pan to rise).  Soooo good!

This is a FANTASTIC bread recipe, my new favorite.  I replace the brown sugar with 1/2 cup BlackStrap molassas and the two cups oats with one cup oats and then a cup of bran and a half cup of flax seeds.  Adds some fiber and additional vitamins to an already great recipe!

I've been baking bread for 45 years and this  recipe is one of the very best I have ever made and I've made lots of bread recipes. This is also an excellent recipe to make for people on a low cholesterol diet. Thank you J. Drury. It has become one of my favorites.

Absolutely outstanding bread! I've tried several recipes on this site and, while all were initially delicious, none were quite as easy to make or held up as well over time as this bread (it was still soft and moist even a week later). I substitute milk for the 4 1/2 cups of warm water (both evaporated and regular milk will work), and I also brush the crust with melted, unsalted butter to really soften it up. My husband raves about this bread. We've decided it will make great Christmas gifts.

I've tested many wheat and white bread recipes and all of them seemed the same to me.  But this one was finally different.  I love the added nutrition of oats.  I use fresh ground whole wheat flour for all the flour because I never have bread flour.  I love the brown sugar in it.  Everyone who's ever tasted always wants the recipe!  I'll never change bread recipes again!  Thanks you!

Exceptionally easy recipe.  This neophyte to breadmaking was able to pare the recipe down to two loaves worth and make two (malformed) very tasty loaves.  Thanks for the recipe.

We loved this bread.  We did end up making it by hand since I don't have a heavy duty mixer with dough hooks.  I used Nora Mill's 10 Grain instead of Just Oats.  Made a wonerfully Hearty bread.  Not to heavy, not too light.  Perfect.  I also broke the dough down into 4 1.5 loaves, because my pans were big.  Froze and thawed Also made great bread.  Great time saver.  Make once have fresh bread when needed.

I am crazy over this bread!!
I use honey istead of sugar and when I break it up into smaller loaves, I add whatever I like to it: sesame seeds, caraway seeds, flax seed, or just raisins and a hint of cinnamon.  I even tried it with sprouts in it!!  It is just such a flexible recipe.
I have froze some at that time and I have also frozen it after baking so I could take a loaf out of the freezer when I needed it.  
Normally, my husband and I do not eat a lot of bread but this is so good and so easy that we usually make it once a month.

this bread was great I made it with only whole wheat flour and it was very good and healthy.  But I could only get 9 cups of flour in the mix.  Thanks for the recipe I will use it again.

This is a fabulous recipe.  I bake a LOT of bread.  Whole wheat, white, you name it I've probably tried to bake it.  This recipe is so versatile.  I've substituted molasses with a little sugar, honey, extra wheat flour, extra oats, flax seed, I think you get the idea.  The one trick I have discovered with bread making is to use cooking spray to roll out your dough.  The more flour you add, the tougher it gets, so I make my dough in my bosch and when it comes off the side while "kneading", I put the still sticky dough in the oiled bowl, let it rise and dump it out on a sprayed board and roll it out and up into loaves.  PERFECT every time!

My whole family absolutely swooned over this bread. Fantastic! I added 1/2 cup each flax and sunflower seeds, and about 1/3 cup wheat germ. This made a delicious, hearty bread. It took a bit less flour than the recipe called for after these additions, I think I used about 8 1/2 cups. This makes a LOT of bread! I don't have that many loaf pans, so I tried freezing some of the dough for later use. That was a mistake, it did not turn out well at all when thawed and baked later. Take my advice: just bake it all at once, or scale down the recipe. I will be making this bread regularly!

I've been making bread consistently for a while now and I'm soooo glad I found this recipe. It's easy to make and tastes wonderful. I made a couple variations that turned out so well, I can't wait to make them again. With both variations... wait until the dough has risen once, then separate and add the goodies to each loaf individually. I ended up with 4 large loaves with this recipe. One variation is to add 1/2 cp. parmesan cheese, 3/4 cp. chopped black and green olives, and a tsp. of chopped garlic. Makes a wonderful specialty bread that goes great with soups. The second variation is to spread the dough on the counter and roll it out. Then add cinnamon, brown sugar, and butter (don't skimp), and roll up then place back in bread pan to raise. Both are sooo good... THANKS for an awesome and versatile recipe!

Great tasting but it was too much for my Kitchen Aid mixer.  I'll certainly make it again but next time I'll try splitting the recipe in half.

I accidentally made it with white sugar...not sure if this affected how it tasted.  It was good, but it didn't have the fresh homemade baked bread taste I was looking for.

This was a really fabulous bread, I agree!!  I made rolls, loafs and all different things, let it rise overnight.  I also love how this doesn't use to much yeast, and uses different ingredients aside from white flour.  Definitely a keeper, will be making this one regularly.  As a pointer, if you are making dinner rolls, keep them big, or they will be tough.

Sweet and delicious bread, really a winner!  I have tinkered with this recipe to increase the amount of whole wheat... using all whole wheat it turns out flat, of course (even using gluten), but very, very good tasting.  I have never gotten six loaves, usually three with two mini loaves and maybe some rolls that would all equal one more loaf (so four total).  I'm not sure why, but I don't mind, it's still the only bread recipe I will probably ever use.  One of my secrets that makes the bread extra enjoyable for me is this-- brush on a timy amount of butter or whatever on before you bake followed by a generous sprinkling of wheat germ...then I brush it again very lightly at the end of baking.  This really seems to make the crust soft and tasty.  Thank you very much for the recipe!

I've tasted better homemade bread, but this is pretty darn good.  I'm a first-time bread maker, and mine turned out great, despite the fact that I used old yeast.  I cut the recipe in half and made two loaves.  Will make again.  Thanks!

This is now my favorite bread recipe.  I use my Kitchenaid Mixer to do all the work and it turns out perfect every time!  I substituted an equal amount or Red River Cereal (a 3 grain cereal like Sonny Boy) for the oatmeal and it worked great.  Too soften the cereal I soaked it in the water while the yeast mixture was foaming up.  Thanks so much!

Love the flavor! I cut it down to 24 servings, which would be 2 loaves, and used one loaf to make turnovers filled with leftover pork. Baked up the other loaf as stated, turned out great but needed a bit more time in the oven than stated. I brushed with melted butter before baking. Oh, and my whole wheat flour was organic whole wheat pastry flour, which has a nicer texture. Awesome easy bread, and I love that you don't have to knead it :)

The Best..Easy and great results..I did add 1/2 Cup Wheat Gluten to the dry ingredients. I found the wheat gluten on the grocery shelf near the whole wheat flour.  My 6 qt. Professional Kitchenade mixer handled this amount of dough but I recommend using the All Recipes feature that allows you to  reduce the amount of servings to 48 for a smaller mixer.

This has become a staple for me. My loaf pans are 9 inch, so I scale down to 48 servings (2/3 recipe) which gives me 3 nice size loaves. Wonderful bread, delightful with anything or on it's own. I'd love to be able to do the 6 loaves, but I can't figure who would have the oven space. Baking 3 at a time would mean leaving 3 loaves to rise too long. I thank J. Drury for this recipe, it's simply wonderful, easy and nutritious. Like Elaine, I make it by hand as I feel bread needs the hands-on kneading. I also generally use unbleached all purpose flour. Trust me, this bread is always worth the time to make. Just remember to avoid adding too much flour, this dough is, and should be as stated, a little sticky. Thanks again for sharing!

The best bread I ever made. I did make a couple changes though. I used honey instead of brown sugar and I did not use a mixer. The bread turned out excellent, really moist. My husband declared that we are not buying bread ever again. Thanks for this recipie

Really great bread. It's my second try at bread making, the first was a recipe from the Joy of Cooking that just didn't cut it. This one was best for a beginner like me. I still need to work on shaping my bread a little better, but otherwise it rose like a champ and it's so light and tasty. Thanks!

Love this recipe. I made it exactly like the original recipe the first time and it was good but sweeter then I wanted for sandwiches, so the second time I made it I only used 1 tbsp & 1 tsp of the brown sugar and left the white sugar out completely and it was perfect. I minimize the recipe to only make 2 loaves at a time though. The only other thing for me was the rise time in loaf pans is longer then 1 hour to get bread as high as I wanted. Overall I love this recipe and it's my new go to recipe when making homemade bread. Thanks

WELCOME FALL and I'm so glad it's bread baking season again! Nothing not to like about this yummy bread. I always use honey instead of sugar to proof my yeast but I did use the brown sugar in the recipe as I wanted the flavor of the molasses to come thru. It was light on the inside and nice and crusty on the outside. It went wonderfully with our green bean soup. Thank you!

This was very good.  Not so much a sandwich type of bread, at least it was a bit dense for us, but delicious alongside soups or really any dinner.

I love this bread.  I have made it many times.  I like it as written, but will sometimes increase the amount of wheat flour.  I don't have an electric mixer, so I just make it by hand.  I find that it's easier to knead in the bowl, just make sure you have a very large bowl, because this makes a large amount of dough & can be difficult to work with.  This will make 6 small loaves, or 4 large ones using a 9 x 5 loaf pan.  I usually just bake one loaf, then freeze the rest of the loaves after the first rise. They take awhile to rise, but they always turn out well.  Also, don't store this in the refrigerator, it will dry out very quickly.  I just put mine in a plastic bag & leave it out & it stays fresh for several days. Very delicious bread, thanks for the recipe!

Incredible!  I didn't have quick oats so I did as another reviewer recommended and just ground up thick cut oats in the food processor a bit.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.   Made 3 into loaves, 1 into dinner cloverleafs and 2 into cinnamon raisin swirl bread.  So good.   The recipe is missing the kneading directions, but I used my dough hook and kneaded it for 7 minutes like I do most breads.  (Wanted to point this out for new to bread bakers)   I gave some to the neighbors and they were raving about it as well.  It won't last long around here.

You absolutely cannot screw up this recipe.. I tried really hard, but couldn't do it. It was so great. My first try at homemade bread. I forgot to add the water with the first set of ingredients and then added too much flour. I was so flustered, the dough kneaded for 3-4 minutes. I didn't put enough oil in the bowl and the top of the dough dried out. To make things worse, the temp in the house was too cool, even with the oven on and it took two hours to rise. I was about to throw the whole mess out when it finally rose. I punched it down because of all the work I had done and put it in the pans, looking like blobs with appendages. It rose again in about an hour and I baked it. It smelled wonderful! 

The bread was so great. I had used a technique my daughter suggested to prevent the crust from being too thick or tough, spraying one spray of water in the oven every 3 minutes for the first 9 minutes. The crust was perfect. 

Even my daughter, who has been baking bread for awhile said this was a great bread (and she didn't try it until 5 days later). 

I will be making this a lot. The 16-yr-old male in the house even bothers to cut this for himself. 

Wow, thanks so much!

Absolutely wonderful. This is the first bread recipe that I have actually had success with. Like the other raters mentioned, I halved the recipe... it didn't turn out the first time, however. An experienced baker informed me that I was not supposed to halve the yeast. 

I have made this recipe twice now with success and each time subsitute a little more whole wheat bread flour for the regular bread flour. I also added a cup of rye flour. Very good. 

A silly thing: I can't find a good place to let bread rise in my drafty apartment... even the oven doesn't always work. Tonight I let the bread dough do its second rise in... the dishwasher! It worked wonderfully and was the first loaf I've made that didn't fall in the oven.

Very nice. I made by hand and used only strong wholemeal flour and added slightly less water to prevent sticky dough.Turned out crispy outside and soft inside. Kneading time is about 8 min.

I skipped the brown sugar--I couldn't find it on the recipe! This recipe takes a long time for rising, so I kept a book close by. I halved the recipe and it didn't have enough dough. Next time, I'll make it with all six loaves--they disappear so quickly! If we could rate any higher on this recipe, I'd make it a 50!

This really is fabulous! I added 1/2 cup of ground flaxseed (for added nutritional value) and reduced the oil a bit.  I also baked it on my pizza stone - just formed it into loaves, brushed the tops with egg white and they all turned out great!  If you don't use stoneware to bake the bread in you are really missing out! Thanks for the recipe, it's a keeper!

I just made this bread, and while I got four instead of six loaves out of the recipe, I have to admit that it's the easiest, best, tastiest bread recipe I've made yet!  I may eat this first loaf all by myself....

This is fantastic bread! I have been looking on and off for a couple of years for bread with the same flavor as store bought (only with the much better home made taste!) This bread is soft, delicious, and not to sweet or heavy! I finally found my bread! Thank you. And for our family of six this makes enough bread to make it through most of the week, so I don't have to bake every few days. Wonderful!

Yes I tried this recipe too with good old fashioned elbow grease too. ??  I only baked it for about 20 minutes and I always brush the tops with margarine or butter, whatever on hand.

Loved this recipe especially since it mixes very well with my kitchen aid stand mixer. I have made this at least six times and it always turns out perfectly. I substituted Robin Hood Multi-Grain bread flour for the 10 cups of bread flour so it has lots of seeds incorporated into it.  I found it made smaller loaves than I like so I just make it into 5 loaves and they come out nice and big but the slices still fit in the toaster without trimming which is a problem I've have with other recipes.  Also I've found that this bread doesn't get stale in a couple of days.  I've had a loaf for a week in the bread box on the counter and the last slice is just as fresh as the first.  I live in a dry climate so you might have a mold problem if your climate is very humid.

I was so worried while making this recipe.  It's not like any other bread recipe I have ever made.  There is no kneading involved and that scared me.  This dough is SO sticky and that scared me too! I got out my 32 cup tupperware bowl and just went for it.  My whole family is so impressed with this.  Like some other suggested, I froze 4 rolls of dough and baked 2.  I'm regretting that now! Wish I had baked a 3rd!  My VERY picky 10 year old son LOVED this...even ate the crust! He has no idea there's whole wheat flour and oats in this! I will make this again and again.  As with all my breads, to form a loaf I roll the dough out flat with a rolling pin and roll it up like cinnamon rolls to get a really great and even texture with no air pockets in the final product. 
2 thumbs up from our house on this bread! Make it and enjoy!!

I just started making bread in the last three weeks.  I like this recipe, but I don't LOVE it.  It tastes delicious fresh out of the oven, but after a couple days not as great.    First time I did this I must have killed a little of the yeast as it didn't rise very high.  After I did some research on various yeasts I found that I didn't need to get my yeast wet first, so the second and subsequent times I have made this I put it all in my bread machine (on the dough cycle).  In order to do it this way just add all the wet ingredients first, second sugars/oils, then the oats and flour.  Last put the yeast on top.  I have bread machine yeast which works best when the yeast does not get wet.  I also learned that you can do this regular active yeast and instant active yeast.  I'm not sure with cake yeast or not, but those are the three types of yeast I happen to have at  my house, so I read as much as I could about these three yeasts.  I did make the two loaves because I didn't have a big enough mixer and more than two would not fit in my bread machine.   Thanks for the recipe will be a great starting place to try some more things, like I was thinking of adding cinnamon and raisons after I roll out before putting in the bread pan for some cinnamon loaves.

A staple in our home.  I've substituted all the flour for unbleached whole wheat flour with great results as well as substituting all sugar for white sugar.  Such an easy recipe for getting 6 loaves out.  I freeze the loaves after I shape them and thaw in the fridge, let it rise an hour more and bake as directed.

So far, I love this recipe.  I decided that I should start baking my own bread so that I know what goes into it and I don't have to worry about deciphering labels.  I followed the recipe exactly so far, except that I substituted 1/3 cup of melted butter for 1/3 cup of the vegetable oil, and olive oil for the other 1/3 cup.  The dough is currently resting in the refridgerator.  I will take it out tomorrow to raise it, form it into loaves, rise it again and bake it.  I wanted to tack a warning onto this recipe tonight though.  If you have a small kitchenaid mixer, split this recipe in half.  I just barely managed to pull together an entire batch of this dough in my mixer, but there are bits of dough up in the crank shaft and I am going to have a heck of a time cleaning this out.  Even two batches of this quick and easy to throw together bread will be worth the time and effort.  Especially with bread running $3.00 a loaf at the store.  My poor mixer made an awful burning smell tonight.  I am convinced that I will always half this recipe in the future.  Hope that this is helpful.  I will let you know how the finished product turns out.

Excellent bread.  I was confused by the lack of kneading in the instructions.  My dough came out very sticky and I kneaded in a bit more flour to one loaf to make it a little less sticky and even more flour to another for a more traditional bread like feel.  I will probably knead next to the more bread like feel.  I think the very sticky dough may be why others have problems with "falling" and bread that falls apart.  However both versions tasted great!!

Wonderful bread.  I scaled to two loaves and used the dough cycle of my bread machine then transfered it to bread pans to rise.  A GREAT slicing bread.  Makes delicious sandwiches and toast.

We have made this bread recipe several times in our family.  Very moist, very tastey!  If you have not made this yet, you MUST.  The hardest part for me is dividing it out into 6 equal parts.  A must try!!!!

I use this recipe to make the bread we use in our Church's Sacrament service each week.  Its gets rave reviews always.

FINALLY - I made successfully made bread w/o a breadmaker. This is the BEST recipe. I didn't have any whole wheat flour, so I used more bread flour and increased oatmeal. I also added rolled oats to the top. Just like my grandma used to make. Thanks for sharing - this one is a treasure!

This is by far the easiest, heartiest, best recipe for whole wheat bread I've ever seen.  I totally screwed up the recipe on first try, and it STILL came out delicious.  On second try, I got it right, and it was honestly the best bread I've ever had.  Following the other reviewers' recommendations, I used all brown sugar and wheat flour instead of white flour and white sugar.  It took a grand total of 15 minutes to prepare (minus the wait time for the rising, of course.)  I don't think I'll ever have to buy bread again.

This Bread is Wonderful!!  My family fights over it at family dinners.  I have made bread for years and this is our favorite.  My youngest son has declared that I should never buy bread from the store again.  I freeze the extra loaves and use them later in the week.

Whoopie! This recipe is wonderfully easy to follow. I nervously divided the recipe by one-third and added wheat bran for more fiber.  Success! My husband thought it was tasty. This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for the submission.

I substitute honey for sugar, and reduce the flour to 8 cups.  I also knead by hand, in order to get the feel of the finished dough before putting it in a bowl to rise.  It makes 4 large loaves.  This is by far the best bread recipe I have used, and I have used quite a few.  Everyone one wants a loaf or two, so I seem to be making it frequently.

I love this bread! I messed up the recipe and it still turned out great. I misread the steps and used all white sugar instead of brown and then just added some honey to compensate for it. I was nervous about having six loaves of bad bread but it turned out amazing and my family loved it! It was also incredibly easy considering I didn't use an electric mixer or a bread machine and I've never made bread before. thanks for this recipe, way better than store bought bread!

The recipe 'Simple Wheat Bread' from this website was our long standing favorite for homemade bread for about 4 years, until I just came across this one! The recipe blows my old favorite out of the water. Thanks for sharing this awesomely yummy recipe!

Love this!!! My only issue was that I have a KithenAid mixer which could not handle the 10 cups of flour at once. I followed the recipe up to adding the flour and then split the mixture in half and added 5 cups of flour to each. Then divided into 3 loaves each. Worked great and my family devoured them!!!!!

I have had this recipe for years and never stopped by to review it. It has been awhile since I've made it, but from what I remember it was delicious and easy to make. After I got married I wanted to learn to make bread and I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. It turned out great. My sister actually came to visit and I made this for her and she ate almost an entire loaf. :) If you're looking for a good bread recipe and easy enough for a beginner this is it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

YUM.  I made this yesterday and gave it to my neighbors for Christmas along with several other homemade goodies.  Within a  couple hours I had several phone calls to tell me how wonderful the bread was!  This is fantastic and I'll definitely be making it again.  There's nothing like the smell of homemade bread baking in the oven!

I followed this recipe and ended up with 4 loaves and I found it a little too sweet for bread.  Next time I will decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Otherwise the texture and taste is pretty good.

I dumped my bread machine to start making bread in my oven.  I have tried many different recipes and this is by far the best bread I have ever made.  The only thing I did differently; I used milk instead of water.  I also half the recipe since my family is small.

Great Recipe!  I used 1/2 the amount of brown sugar and was VERY happy with the results.  I also froze the prepared loaves after splitting the dough into six portions.  Wrapped each in plastic wrap and froze before they started to rise.  When ready, just lay the dough out for a few (3) hours to thaw then place into bread pan to rise for another hour.  Tasted just as good as the fresh batch!

Really great bread.  Just made my first loaf of this (scaled the recipe to one) and ate the first slice.  Easy, simple recipe - you don't need to have a lot of extra ingredients.   Will definitely make again.  EDIT:  Just ate half the loaf!

I used this as the jumping off recipe for my current favorite ww bread. The first time I made it as written, scaled down for 2 loaves, and it was very good bread. I've since tweaked it to get it healthier and it is now my go to bread recipe. I make it every Sunday and use it for sandwiches for the week. My changes: (scaled for 2 loaves) 1 tbsp +1 tsp bread flour, 1 tsp sugar, 1 packet of yeast, 2 cups whole wheat flour, 1/4 cup wheat germ, 1/4 cup ground flax, 3/4 cups old fashioned oats, 1 tbsp mahleb, then follow the rest of the scaled recipe. I get 2 tender, delicious and HEALTHY loaves of bread every time :-) Thank you for the great base recipe!

This bread is fantastic. My husband is a somewhat picky eater, and he absolutely loved it. I made a half batch, and substituted 1/2 melted butter and 1/2 olive oil for the vegetable oil and it came out great. I have been trying to find a good non-bread machine bread recipe for a while - this one is a keeper!

This bread is incredible.  I added 2 Cups Whole Wheat flour and 2/3 flax seed and 2/3 cup sunflower seeds.  My husband likes this bread better than the whole wheat with seeds breads that I have made.  I didn't make six loaves I nade four large loaves instead.  Just the right size for sandwiches.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Will be making this one often.

This is a great recipe. I hate dragging out my bread machine to cook my bread, so this recipe was made for me. The sweet, yeasty taste is so versatile and I love to use it in my garlicky grilled cheese sandwiches. They melt in your mouth.

I loved this recipe! I wanted more of a multigrain taste and added the 12 whole grain mix that I got from the local bulk store. Fantastic! Make sure your water is warm or it won't rise enough.

Excellent and kept very well.  My neighbors loved it, as I thought I halved the recipe but the measurements remained the same in the text and I had to make all 6 loaves!  I had to split it up in my mixer.  Next time I'll be more careful!

This is my first time making bread and it's a great success. I divided all the ingredients by half and used two 9x5 loaf pans instead. Otherwise, I followed the recipe straightly. With the help of the KitchenAid Accolade mixer, it made the whole process easier for a first timer like me. Both loaves baked out nicely and didn't fall. They tasted great too.

This is the best bread I have ever tasted! I like it so much better than anything you get at the store. I only made one loaf, but it was gone in a day. I don't know if they are the same or not but I used all purpose flour when it said to use bread flour. Thanks for the recipe!

I was a bit dubious about this recipe as I noticed it had received several negative reviews recently.  I only wanted one loaf so I quartered the recipe and made it by hand as I don't have a bread machine.  I also live in France so I don't have a bread pan, and I've never seen bread flour here either, so I just used regular white flour.  I was also starving and couldn't wait so I only let it rise for half an hour the second time around.  Despite all this, it turned out great.  It made a huge loaf, but my husband and I devoured half of it minutes after it came out of the oven.  Granted, we were starving, but the taste and texture were great too.  I don't know how anyone could find it bland - we ate it plain!  I toasted some later and had it with grilled cheese and it was great that way too.  It was a happy medium between white and wholewheat bread, not too sweet, not too salty - perfect.

Wonderful bread.  I used it to teach a class at my church. Everyone loved it, I took a loaf already made and the ladies were liking the plate to get the crumbs. Best bread I've ever made and I have made alot of bread.  I added 3 cups of whole wheat and 3 cups of oatmeal to make it a bit more substantial.  I have people stopping me all the time wanting more. thank you so much.

This was the third bread recipe that I've tried and, I have to say, it is the best.  It wasn't hard to prepare (as with all bread, most of the preparation time is waiting for the yeast to do its stuff.)  When baking, the entire house filled with a great aroma (had my family salivating like Pavlov's dogs.)  The end result is awesome.  Tastes great and slices really nicely.  This may replace our store-bought bread!

This bread has the absolute BEST FLAVOR!  It is also moist, not crumbly like most wheat breads.  I added twice the amount of whole wheat flour, reducing the amount of bread flour.  It still retained the moist, soft consistancy.. Your mother knows what she's doing!  Thank you for a recipe I will definately keep!

This bread was great, but I like to make 2 lbs. loaves, so I get just 4 loaves out of this recipe.
Love the texture, flavor! Do not be afraid to try this recipe, it really is delicious.

THANK YOU! I have tried several bread recipes and have had horrible results.  This recipe was AWESOME!  It reminds me of the homemade bread my mom used to make, but hers was shredded wheat bread w/ molasses.  She always makes her bread from scratch, but I cheat w/ a mixer & dough hook.  I halved the recipe as 6 loaves was way too much for my family of 4 (plus my mixer could handle that much dough).  This will be added to my bread recipe collection right next to my Mom's recipe.  I should find that and post it too ... haven't seen one like it at this site!!!!

Turned out terrible!  I'm an experienced bread maker, and this was the worst bread I've ever made.  The risen loaves flopped when I set them on the counter after they did their rising in the oven.  I'd try this recipe again, but I wouldn't use the bread flour.  The flavor and texture was nice, but my loaves are only two inches high!

I wasn't positive I was going to do this right, but the directions were spot on, and my children LOVED rolling out the dough, and then watching it rise, then of course eating it! If you haven't tried this recipe I suggest you make it. It does have a bit of a breakfast (wheat) taste to it, but it's so wonderful! thank you Elaine!

AMENDED:  We had the bread for dinner tonight and I'm changing my ranking to 5 stars.  WOW!  Light and airy.  The bread, if cut when cool with a good bread knife, does not fall apart or crumble.  My son had 3 slices!  It is very good.  I will make this again and again and again.

First review:  Since the bread is in the oven right now, I'm not sure how the finale will be.  However...I'm perplexed to read how some reviewers couldn't get a rise from the dough.  No sooner did I get the dough in the oiled bowl, and it started to rise.  It doubled in less than an hour.  My son, my daughter and I all tasted the dough before I put four loaves in oiled bags to freeze, and two more in loaf pans for a second rise.  The dough was nicely flavored, not too sweet and not at all flat.  The two loaves rose nicely in the pan in less than an hour.  For both rises, I covered the dough with plastic wrap and set it on my counter.  As I peek in the oven now, I see two gorgeous lightly golden fluffy loaves of bread baking away, which smell amazing!  Other recipes I've tried on this site don't always work.  My best advice...use fresh yeast!  I get Fleishmann's active dry yeast and keep the jar in my fridge.  Bread never fails with fresh yeast.  Thank you for the recipe! I think this will be another family favorite.

Ok, NOTHING I"ve ever made from this site, while good, was enough to prompt me to write a review = but I've made bread pretty frequently and I almost always mess it up (too hard or too dry etc.) but this recipe was absolutely amazing to the point that even I did it correctly and our bread turned out AMAZING. The only thing that I did differently was that I halved the recipe. I did everything else the way it was written and made 3 wonderful, fluffy loaves. THANK YOU!

This is a good, easy, basic bread recipe for those who like to have loaves on hand.  It has a nice chew, has a bit of texture, but is still soft enough for those who like all white flour breads and a little bit of sweetness.  Next time, I may add a little honey.  This is a new 'go to" bread recipe.

Fabulous doesn't even begin to describe this bread!!!!!  So amazing!!!!  It is soft and perfect!  No, it doesn't fit in a KitchenAid mixer, but I used mine until it was too full and then did the rest by hand.  Still came out perfect.  I also substituted honey for the brown sugar and replaced 1/3 c of oil with unsweetened applesauce.  I only got 5 loaves and I baked 2 and froze the other 3.  We'll see what happens with those 3, but of the 2 I baked, I am very happy!

I am not one for writing reviews but i decided to write one for this recipe. I haven't bought a loaf of bread from the store in over a year, so naturally i have tried several different recipes to see what bread works best for our family. I have to say that this was the best bread that i have discovered so far. the texture of this bread is unbelievable. the white bread that i have made would dry out quickly and the wheat bread i have tried i could never get to rise properly. This bread stayed nice and soft and chewy. made excellent sandwiches and toast. was also fabulous by itself with a little butter. The recipe itself was too large for my kitchenaid mixer to handle, but i did it the old fashion way. The extra work was well worth it. My family was unanimous in the decision that this will be the bread that we have in the house from now on. If you have any reservations about trying this recipe, don't. although you might want to scale it down. I will say this....i only got 5 loaves because i weighed the dough to be about 1.5 lbs per loaf and i will make them closer to 2 lbs next time. excellent recipe!! thanks so much for giving my family a bread they don't just like...but LOVE!! =)

This is fabulous for my family of six. I mix the whole recipe with half or less of the brown sugar and mostly honey. We have one loaf with chowder, then regular toast is divine for breakfast, then a loaf for fluffy french toast recipe from this site. I like that it is so versatile and not a one and done meal. I've had great luck with this bread recipe and I do not have a bread machine or stand mixer...just the old fashioned way:)

I am an avid bread baker, and although I liked the texture of this bread and the lightness, I found it to have a very flat flavor. I made it with all whole wheat as I don't eat any white flour. If I make it again I will definately substitute honey for the sugars and possibly add a TBS molasses. Also, you can add all ingredients into the sponge except the oil, salt and last 10 cups flour- no need to make it so complicated. Just let it bubble for 15 minutes instead of 5.
To those who froze dough- just bake all the loaves and freeze the bread, it keeps very well and saves time.

This was my very first time making bread at home by hand (no bread maker or Kitchen Aid mixer) and I have to say that I made delicious bread!  This recipe is so easy to follow and make that it took no time at all to get the hang of it.  The only thing I did differently was take the advice of another poster and used regular Quaker oatmel and ground it in the blender.
Added bonus...my house smells wonderful!

LOVED this bread!!! My first time making bread from scratch and I chose a big recipe - -go big or go home ya know. I used molasses instead of brown sugar and today I am using this recipe to make bierocks. Easy and FABULOUS taste and texture.  I dont have a bread mixer so I just did it the old fashioned way and kneaded the bread by hand. It was wonderful!!!!

First time bread maker here. I did not use any fancy equipment. Just me and good old fashioned methods. I love this recipe. Easy to follow. My second time making it turned out better. So, I think the more I make it, the better it will get. I also used the honey instead of brown sugar.

For a first time bread maker, this was the perfect recipe.  I'm now using the recipe to branch out and experiment, but even on its own merits, we'll be making this one again and again.

I have been making homemade bread for a while now and wanted to  try a different recipe.  I changed a few things: I scaled the recipe to only make two loaves as a trial.  BIG mistake...the first loaf is already gone!  Will have to make more next time.  I also added a handful of whole soaked bulgur wheat, added some wonderful texture in the finished loaves.  This recipe is much more involved than my other recipe, but turns out an excellent loaf of bread with a light, airy texture.  If you are looking for a good sandwich bread recipe, this is it!

Great bread!  I have a 6-qt KitchenAid mixer and mixing the entire recipe is a bit for it to handle.  I now just cut the recipe in half.  I have frozen the dough after the first rising and shaping it into loaves.  It does take about 10-12 hours for it to thaw and rise before baking, but it comes out beautifully and taste great.

Awesome recipe! Easy to handle the dough--thought it would take a lot more elbow grease. I did substitute all-purpose flour for the bread flour and added more whole wheat flour. For the 10 cups bread flour I used 3 whole wheat and 6 1/2 cups all-purpose. Thanks.

Thanks for the fantastic recipe!  For anyone who wants 3 good size loaves, cut the recipe down to 54 servings and use the larger loaf pans.  Still use all three packages of yeast.  I replace some of the bread flour with 1/4 cup flax seed meal.  I also replace some bread flour with whole wheat flour, as we like more of a whole grain bread.  The only other change I make is using honey in place of the white sugar, which I think is just a matter of personal preference.  Overall a fantastic recipe!  Thanks!

Fabulous doesn't even begin to cover it! I made this bread today for my son's birthday dinner in 2 days thinking that if it flops I have time to find another recipe. I think instead, I'll have to bake another batch that morning. I have a favorite frozen whole wheat bread dough that I purchase from a local grocer whenever I am in the mood to bake bread. NEVER AGAIN! What a feeling to know that I can make bread with out cheating! And, I know everything that's in it. I chose to use 5 cups of whole wheat flour and 7 cups of unbleached white because our family prefers wheat bread. I also shaped the dough into Italian loafs since spaghetti is on the menu for my son's party. This recipe is great and looks and tastes just like the wheat bread dough I always used to get. At least try this recipe once. You'll be glad you did!

My first bread with whole wheat flour (3rd bread ever) that didn't end up heavy as a rock. It was like somebody else made it!
I used honey to prime the yeast and halved the recipe.

Hm, this bread is pretty good. I used white whole wheat flour in place of the bread flour, and halved the recipe. Ended up with 8 dinner rolls and one big loaf. Just polished off three rolls as dinner, so hey, I guess I can't complain, lol. 

I did the whole thing by hand, and used about 1/2C less flour than called for. The bread was very sticky, and I sort of plopped it into the pan to rise -- not so much in the way of "shaping." 

The rolls and the loaf all rose beautifully, and the bread has a very delicate crumb. Not bursting with complex wheaty/nutty flavor or anything,  but as a mild sandwich bread I imagine it'll be pretty tasty.

This bread fell while baking. I've been baking breads for about 2 years now and while not every loaf has turned out perfectly, I've never had a loaf come out of the oven shorter than when I put it in.

Yummy! I got 1 huge loaf from my bread machine. Here's what I did. I changed the servings to 24 to fit my 2lb bread machine. I also added 4T of Wheat Gluten. It came out soft enough to make my kids peanut butter & jelly sandwiches on. As a snack I toasted and and put butter and honey on top. 4 and 6 yr old ate the whole loaf in 2 days! Thanks for the recipe. This one is a keeper!

If I could rate this bread more I could, it was my very first time making bread and it was a huge success! I didn't use whole wheat flour, I used all bread flour, and it was still delicious! It will become a family favorite!! Thank you for the wonderful recipe!

I must echo the sentiments posted in most of the previous reviews...DELICIOUS and EASY!!!! 
I only made two loaves (with no fancy adjustments to yeast measurements or anything...just divided everything by three. Of course, I realized *afterwards* that you can simply use the 'Scaling' feature to enter 24 servings instead of 72 and the website will do all the calculations for you!) 
I brushed the tops of the loaves with butter after I took them out of the oven. So LIGHT and FLUFFY!!! My first attempt at breadmaking without a bread machine, and it was worth the time (actually very little) and even the extra dishes :)

I have been struggling making my mother's bread, then there was light. This bread is perfect, as my sister-in-law said nothing could be better. The texture is awesome, light and holds together. The flavor makes it powerful enough to be eaten alone. But the only downside is our fault, we didn't read the reviews first. If we had we would have learned that it doesn't fit in a Kitchen Aid. But besides that it is 'The Best'

This bread is incredibly moist and delicious!! I used 3- 9" pans instead of 6- 8"x4" pans. I wish I could show you a picture of the bread and how high it raised over the sides of the pans.  Impresive looking bread!!  I also rubbed a little butter on top of the bread when it came out of the oven.  This softened the bread from having a really hard top. My children loved the bread! I hope this is helpful.

Great bread. I admit, however, that I was too lazy to make it by hand, so I used my bread machine. I scaled the recipe down to 24 servings, and it made a nice sized perfect loaf of bread. Just put the ingredients in the order recommended by the manufacturer, omitting the 1/2 cup of water, 1/4 cup of flour and tablespoon of sugar for the starter. I baked mine on the fast bread cycle.

I've been looking for a recipe like my mom's and this is it - but much simpler to make.  I used all whole wheat flour and it still turned out moist like I like it.  A great recipe that will stay in our family for years to come.

I have been baking and trying new bread recipes for years and this is one of the best EVER!  Delicious flavor and aroma, beautiful texture, slices perfectly, stays moist and delicious even a day or 2 after baked (if it lasts that long.)  Only think I did differently was used old-fashioned oatmeal as I didn't have the quick kind.  Turned out awesome!  Next time, might add sunflower seeds.  THANKS FOR GREAT RECIPE!

What a hearty bread.  Nice texture, slightly sweet, wonderful comfort food.  My husband just had his evening snack, this bread toasted with raspberry jam.
J.Drury thank you for a winner!!!It also made wonderful buns with Italian roast beef from the slow cooker.

Great bread... perfect texture and taste.
Looked like it came from a bakery. I made five loaves and 12 buns. I bake ALOT so I know good bread, it doesn't get any better. I have a bosch too so it is sooo easy to make.

Great, quick,  and easy. Good texture and tasty toast. Makes what it says it does-6 loaves. I have used either Red Wheat Flour or White Wheat Flour. I prefer, White because it is a milder flavored flour than the Red.

We recently moved and I couldn't locate
my tried and true wheat bread recipe
so tried this one. It is wonderful.
Everyone really enjoyed it. This will
replace the recipe (that I have now
found) that I have used for years!

This recipe had only one downfall--too much for my mixer to handle, so I made one half of the amount. The loaves rose nicely and browned well in the oven.  As my husband and daughter would say, "It's a keeper!"

Still my favorite!!! I can easily adjust wheat flour, oatmeal, and throw in some cracked wheat and still come out with great flavor and moisture.  I haven't found a better recipe YET! even after trying some from Breadworld.com!

I have been making this bread for years and years. It is so good and really easy. My daughter, who grew up eating it is now making it too. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.( I do use rolled oats, not quick and let them soak in the water for 10 min before adding flour, and I use 3-4 cups of whole wheat flour and reduce the amount of white flour I use. It is the BEST!

I would be sure to freeze some of this bread. I really don't understand the problem with 6 loaves if you have a freezer. Just makes your life a little easier. I love freshly made bread. The store stuff just turns me off!

The bread rose great the first time, but on the second rise it would not rise above the pans. I let it rise for 2 hours instead of 1 and then baked. Surprisingly it wasn't dense. The flavor and texture were good but the tops stayed kind of flat looking like they hadn't risen all the way. Probably wont make this recipe again, but it wasn't horrible.

I absolutely LOVE this bread! I just finished making my first six loaf batch and am sure there are many loaves in my future! The recipe was blissfully easy to follow- THANK YOU. I am NOT a baker, or creative in the kitchen, by any means. This was my first attempt at bread (and when I say that- I mean all kinds- including banana breads, boxed breads, etc) so for the bread to turn out as well as it did, it must be wonderful! To give you an idea of how novice I am in the kitchen, when I went to the store to get "bread flour" I ended up buying 3, 5lb bags because I needed 10ish cups of flour. (Now, I am not terribly unintelligent but my mind just doesn't think like a baker! I know a cup doesn't equal a pound but for some reason the number 10 stuck in my mind so I bought 10 pounds plus a little extra just in case... ) When I got home and realized that I had purchased enough flour for 60 loaves of bread I figured I was already doomed. But, 10 cups or so later (and two unopened bags :) ) I am happy to say that the mission was a success! Thank you!

Great recipe! I used my Bosch mixer. I used all fresh ground whole wheat flour (plus the oats) and added 1/4 cup vital wheat gluten. Delicious and all whole grains! I made 4 loaves and a dozen rolls. Next time I may make more rolls. They are fabulous!

One of the reviews on here said .25 oz is equal to 1.5 tablespoons. Being new to bread making I believed that. After a few failed attempts I looked into it. It is actually 2 1/4 tsp NOT tablespoons.
I hope you see this before the other review. It makes a big difference. Now it turns out great every time.

This was so good!! I cut it down to 24 servings and made it in my bread machine. It came out a nice dense, flavorful loaf!! I used All Purpose Flour with an egg white to give it the extra protein that bread flour has in it. This will be my go to recipe from now on!!! Thank You!!!

I just bought a Bosch Universal Plus...WHAT A MACHINE!! -that's a whol 'nother review!   I found this recipe because we are not big fans of 100 percent whole wheat breads...they just dont feel soft enough, we LOVE super soft bread. I thougt I would try this because over 400 people CANNOT be wrong!  WELL TEHY WERE NOT WRONG!  THis bread is easy to make and uses ingredients I always have on hand.  I ended up having to use a cup more of flour as it kept sticking to the bowl (I weighed not scooped the flour, so maybe that's why?)  The recipe doesnt say how long to knead it in the machine, so I did 5 minutes on the number 3 speed setting.  BOY did this have the best gluten strands ever.  The dough is SUPER sticky but reading the reviews, it was what I expected.  The dough rose (actually almost tripled) in 30 minutes and it they rose in the pans in 30 minutes (to a HUGE height). The loaves smelled wonderful, baked perfect and are so deliciously soft with the perfect crust!   I brushed butter over the tops while loaves were hot which  melted in and gave the crust a gorgeous look and taste.  I made three loaves and froze the other 3, which I will use for loaf bread and dinner rolls in the not too distant future.  The title says it all.....it truly is FABULOUS HOMEMADE BREAD.  It's so good it's a shame to put the sandwhich ingredients on it!

This turned out excellent: light and fluffy.
I recommend you use a VERY large bowl, as mine overflowed in in the first rising.
Reduce the time if u use non stick and if u make buns or dinner rolls.

I live in Trinidad, West Indies thats in the Caribbean and I have been searching for a good healthy homemade bread and I will recommend it.  My Viking Mixer could not hold the volume so I made it with my hand and I added a 1/4 Cup of Fennel to it and it was GREAT.  Thanks for a great Recipe

We have been trying to get away from buying bread and were having great success with a bread machine recipe. Something happened though and the machine stopped working. We have yet to figure out the problem and were back to buying bread from the store... YUCK! I am happy to report that this will be the last recipe that we need and there will be no more bread from the store! I made many things so far with this recipe: Loaves, dinner rolls, hamburger buns, and cinnamon rolls. I intend to have this be my only yeast bread recipe. My family loves it and they are getting more fiber and nutrition than they realize becuase they don't know what all is in it so I REALLY love it!

I've been making various types of breads, mainly wheats & multi-grains but this bread is the all around perfect bread for any purpose! It is great for sandwiches as well as to eat fresh from the oven! Unlike most denser bread recipes this one is moist with a fluffy texture! If you want simple goodness follow this recipe exactly or if you're like me & want a touch more sweetness add a Tablespoon or two of Molasses or Honey which kicks it up just a notch! The Brown sugar in this recipe really makes it have more character without overpowering it! This will be my basic bread from now on! It is also the perfect dough for cinnamon rolls & other goodies!

I made this yesterday. I halved the recipe.  It tasted good but it is so dense.  I didn't use a bread machine or a mixer so i just kneaded the dough which was hard to do because it was still so wet even after 5 cups of flour.  I think it didn't get to rise fully even if I left it to rise for a long time. I wonder what I did wrong.

This bread is nice-- a little dense, but otherwise it's very good.  I halved the recipe so I could use my bread machine and made a few different types of loaves.  It's good for sandwiches because it doesn't crumble too much, and it's hearty.  I like that it has ww in it, and it's pretty simple to make.  The finished loaves freeze quite well.  Thanks for the recipe!

This bread is truly fabulous.  I reduced the oats to 1 1/2 Cups and added1/2 C milled Flaxseed.  Really yummy warm from oven.  Also made great toast.

So easy to make and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly and froze four of the loaves after the first rising. I plan to use this the loaves I baked for sandwiches, french toast, and bread at dinner. Good wheat flavor without tasting too healthy. Update: the bread did not rise after thawing. I am really disappointed because I froze most of the dought!

Maybe I should do 5 stars due to new bread maker error. I dunno. I have never made bread with out the aid of a bread machine. But we do NOT like bread machine bread for a lot of reasons. This bread is amazing in taste. I rolled one out and put cinnamon and raisins, brown sugar and pecans in it. I haven't tasted it yet but can't wait. The one I made for sandwiches was short. It took two to = a regular size sandwich but this may be my fault. My hubby liked it but said it fell apart too much. Again maybe my fault. I lost count of cups of flour so I had to go by feel and I have never made bread before  so I have nothing to base my "feel" on. I don't have a mixer so I had to knead and mix by hand. Overall I love it and can't wait to eat the other four loaves in the freezer. I will let it rise more next time. I guess in my head it would puff up in the oven but no such luck. :) YUMMY

This was my first time making bread so I was a little nervous.  I scaled it down to 2 loaves but followed directions exactly and it turned out perfectly!  I gave it 4 stars because I don't really have anything to compare it to and... it is just bread so it's not like it's the best thing I've ever eaten but it is def going in the recipe box.  Thanks!

Excellent recipe. My first attempt at homemade bread without a bread machine. Hubby/ MIL, and FIL are homemade bread connaiseurs, so, the pressure was on. This recipe was easy to work with and produced the best bread any of them has tasted. Very light and fluffy results - this is a keeper. I'm still beaming from all the raves! Thanks for sharing.

All I can say is WOW ! I have made this recipe 3 times. After months of seeking out the best home made bread recipes, this is one of our top 2. My guests actually seem to prefer this one over the other a rustic italian bread). This is sweet, and has a spectacular taste from the whole wheat, brown sugar and oats. Amazing.. make it and you will love it.

Have used similar recipe for years called "Hay Hand".  I like to mix the dough by hand and place in black garbage bag in the sun.  Dough rises and comes out wonderfully.  I also usually soak my oats in some of the water before adding.  You can also try adding instant mashed potatoes or left over mashed potatoes.  It gives a slightly different texture to the crust I think.  Have also added garlic herb mixture to make a great herb bread.

Very moist bread. Very light brown inside from the brown sugar. Not overly sweet. My husband says this is the best bread I have made.  I added approximately 1/4 cup of cracked wheat for a little extra chewiness. i made 4 large loaves from this recipe.  I think it would make great buns too.

At first I joked with my darling husband about the huge blob of dough growing in my warm oven- thinking that there was No Way that this recipe would work out right... Yeah, right!  I HAVE NEVER EATEN BREAD THIS GOOD IN MY LIFE!!!!  The only thing I changed to this recipe is that I put a small sauce pan with water in on the lower shelf of my oven while baking to obtain a chewy crust. (which I love)  Be warned- make this bread once and you will never want store bought again!!  Oh- and if you are also intimidated by the amount made, don't be- I froze the other 5 loaves successfully and baked them later with no problems.

This is the best bread recipe that I have tried so far. Please note that I made only two loaves, however I will make 6 next time. It was so hard to stop eating them. HELP - I do plan to freeze some for later use. Any suggestions on how to defrost them and get them to rise. Do you defrost in the refrig and them pop them in the oven or is there some other step I am missing? Thanks for the help!

Wonderful bread! I cheat and use my kitchenaid for the mixing, and I also replace some of the white flour with WW, and add things like flax seeds and sunflower seeds just to boost the nutritional content a bit. For me this recipe makes 4 loaves since I use the extra long loaf pans.

This bread has a nutty flavor and even my children, who do not like "wheat" bread, raved over it.  One amazing thing about this bread is that unlike store purchased bread, it has no preservatives, yet it lasts for a very long time(7-10 days) on the counter before it begins to mold.  I did learn a lesson about the use of my Artisan Kitchenaid mixer.  It can not accomidate more than 8 cups of flour, so I had to half the recipe.  Otherwise, the dough gets all jammed up in the workings and when it rises the dough pokes out of every nook and cranny.  It was a MESS to clean!  Don't try it!  Thank you for this wonderful bread recipe!!!!

I reserved my rating on this until I finally felt a loaf had come out the way it should have. My first few loaves (from one batch) were very doughy inside. I then reduced the recipe to 24 servings and used my bread machine, then is was very dense. The last loaf of dough from the first batch (I had frozen some)I rolled with some more white flour and let rise, then I baked at 350 degrees and waited until it sounded hollow (35-40 minutes?). I made that loaf last night and it is all gone already! So, I think the original recipe stands with just a little flour rolled in. Turned out very soft and just right for slicing.

Excellent bread, even though I screwed it up.  Most bread recipes encourage a kneading process, which I did.  I was about 5 minutes from having a nice soft (not sticky) dough when I realized my mistake.  Still, it turned out great. It was soft, moist and delicious.

This is an awesome bread recipe. I even messed it up and it still come out light, fluffy, and with a wonderful taste. I accidentally used white sugar. After I realized this, I did not want to start over so I added one tablespoon of molasses. Half of one of the loaves is already gone. I had a hard time getting the loaves to rise above the bread pan. I don't really care. I always go for taste and function over appearance.

This recipe is very good.  I changed the wheat flour to 5 1/2 cups, added 1/2 cup gluten, and 6 1/2 cups regular white flour.  I used 2/3 cups honey instead of brown sugar and mixed it in my KitchenAid mixer until the batter went over the dough hook.  I put the dough on a floured surface and kneaded in the remaining flour for about 5 minutes.  I also made four loaves. Six loaves would have been too small. Very good!

This was the best tasting bread!  The recipe was very easy, I also used my Bosch mixer.  I did use honey instead of brown sugar,as suggested in another review. I also only baked the bread for 32 minutes.

I loved it. My family wanted more. We live with extended family so the six loaves were just enough for dinner. I used a little more whole wheat flour that the recipe called for but it came out perfect.

I have made this recipe many times over the last 6 months and it is just as the name says fabulous. My husband is very picky and he loves this bread. I take it to potluck at church and they all rave about it as well.  I do add more oatmeal and wheat flour and less white flour. I prefer to use honey instead of sugar. Any little changes that you make to it will turn out perfectly. There is no way to mess the recipe up. It is absolutly Fabulous!!!

it tastes ok and that's about it. it's not pretty, it falls flat not matter what, and it falls apart when you try to cut it. i've been trying alot of new bread recipes and I didn't care for this.

Wow, wow, wow!  I LOVE this bread!   My new favorite that I will be making all the time.  I did sub a cup of the flour for ground flax and added some honey for taste.  It did not last long, lol!!  It's dense and great for sandwiches and it stayed moist all week.  The only thing is it only made 4 loaves but it was worth it!!  Maybe I can try to get another loaf out if it next time.

Very tasty! I added 3 cups of whole wheat flour and 9 cups of bread flour and used rapid rise yeast and it still comes out nice and airy (only makes 5 loaves though). You just can't beat fresh baked bread for your family!

do not try to make  full recipe of this using your mixer - it's impossible.  rather, mix well using a wooden spoon and remember that you don't have to knead this dough too much - it's supposed to be sticky.  excellent flavor, good texture and moist.  mine didn't rise above the pans either time i made it but came out just fine.

Though I know this is nothing that many haven't already said in other reviews, this bread is wonderful! I made a half recipe by hand and it turned out great, very flavourful and with a great texture. Its a keeper!

Ever since I found this recipe, I've stopped buying bread. Instead, I make this every week or two. It's great, and so much healthier than store-bought sandwich bread. Very good.

Great flavor...easy bread.  Makes four nice tall loaves instead of six. Also a tad soft...is a bit crumbly for sandwiches, etc.  WONDERFUL toasted...nice "nutty" texture/flavor. Have made it several times.

Wonderful!  I agree with another poster, you really can't mess this one up.  Tongiht when I made it, I had old fashioned oats, not quite enough veggie old, and I messed up and put white sugar into it instead of brown!  Still excellent bread!

Oh wow, this bread is good. I mixed mine in the bread machine (1/3 recipe) and then baked it in two pans in the oven. After baking, I buttered the tops. Mmm, mmm, good. And AWESOME toasted.

I make this bread often.  I made 4 loaves for Thanksgiving to use for turkey sandwiches, figured we'd go through 2 with a big family and still have some for the weekend.  Nope.  The kids took 2 loaves downstairs and devoured them with a whole tub of margarine.  Oh, well, more pie for us!!

Great bread. Very light and soft. The quantity size of all the ingrediants was a bit much for my mixer.  Tried to scale recipe down to 3 loaves, but the measurements weren't scaled down in the direction part.  Wanted 3 loaves, ended up with 6 fabulous loaves.  Will make again!!!

This is wonderful bread. I used six cups of fresh ground hard spring wheat and six cups of bread flour. The loaves were a perfect texture. I was a little concerned that it would be too dry. I'm not used to working with sticky dough and kept adding flour as I kneaded, but it wasn't dry at all. I made three loaves, six buns and 10 rolls. My children loved it and said that I could make this bread all the time! Even my Golden loved the bread; she stole the rolls as they were cooling on the rack! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is what convinced me to buy a Bosch mixer instead of another well known brand. I'll always be thankful to J. Drury for that because I love my mixer. The recipe itself makes very nice loaves that slice easily. I use white whole wheat instead of regular and the bread turns out lighter in taste and color than regular whole wheat and very yummy. I try a lot of bread recipes but there's always a loaf or two of this in the bread box for our sandwiches. It's very good made with honey instead of brown sugar too!

This was FABULOUS bread.  I cut the recipe in half because I'm only baking for two and have limited freezer space.  My husband and I LOVED it.  Perhaps I'm using a larger loaf pan, but the half recipe made two loaves, not three.

I couldn't wait to try this bread just from all the reviews - but I have to be honest. It had a very bland taste, and my loaves fell during the second rising after about 30 minutes.  Maybe I did something wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly.  The crust did come out very rustic, as one person mentioned.  It just needs more flavor.

This bread was great!  I was looking for a recipe just like this.  Since I didn't know how it would be I only made three loves, but only ended up with two because my dog stole a whole loaf. My fault I know!  I'm only 17 and I have not baked too much bread in my lifetime, I was so pleased how this bread came out!  I would toast the bread, then put peanut butter and cinnamon and then slice some bananas on it.  Also just a plain peanut butter and jelly sandwiches which I usually hate.  Yum!  Yum!  So good!  Two thumbs up!  This is going in my recipe book!  Thanks so much!

Absolutely lovely recipe.  Funny enough, I actually tried the full recipe in my KitchenAid mixer.  Knowing full well that 12 cups of flour would be way too much.....I was sure it was going to be a complete flop when I saw the dough creeping up the mixer.  Nevertheless it was the best bread ever.  thanks for sharing. God Bless.

Mmmm . . . my house smells divine from the fresh bread.  :-)  I'm really bad at baking bread.  I just don't have the touch.  The recipe has given the best results thus far.  I'm still having some sort of issue with the bread falling a little towards the beginning of baking, but the loaves are still good.  I'm assuming it's MY problem -- not the recipe -- given my history and all of the wonderful reviews everyone else has given it.  I'm going to try this one again in a few days and see if maybe I can do a better job next time.  Thanks so much for this YUMMY bread recipe!

This bread was wonderful.  I've never made homemade bread like this, so I messed up and it still turned out good.  I think a 10x6 loaf pan worked the best for me; it was a nice, hearty loaf.  However, if you use this size pan it will not yeild 6 loaves.  Will make again, but using all wheat flour.

I made this using my Kitchenaid mixer, and it came out GREAT!  I have tried a bunch of different bread recipes, and this is by far the best one.  The bread is so moist and chewy - I've been toasting it and eating it plain!

This is the first bread baking experience I've had.  The recipe was easy to follow and the output (the bread :)) was simply the best!!!  It would be difficult to go back to buying bread from stores after tasting this.  I did use half whole wheat and half bread flour as suggested by some of the reviews.  Thanks!

This is a very good bread. This was my first real attempt at making bread, and it went smoothly from start to finish. But the taste was lacking something, my HB agreed. I don't know if I'm thinking of that yeast taste I'm used to from homemade bread?...But anyway, it's a keeper. Thanks for posting it.

This turned out to be a very good bread, though we prefer a heartier bread, but it was light chewy and tasty.  My mixer can't handle such a large recipe either so I made it by hand, kneading in the flour when it got too hard to stir.  Then I froze half the loaves like another reviewer suggested.  Very happy with this recipe.

I loved this bread!  I didn't have bread flour though, so I added 1/2 cup high gluten and the rest all purpose.  I also allowed it to rise again after punching it down the first time, then formed the loaves.  The texture was perfect--not crumbly or course!  Fabulous!

5 stars for ease in creating this fabulous sandwich bread.  I cut the recipe down to make two loaves.  The second rising took about twice as long - 2 hours - as noted in the recipe, but patience was all that was needed to get a nice rise.  I usually make crusty Italian loaves or rustic breads so this is a nice addition.

Fabulous indeed.  It love that the bread is dense and soft. I eat it toasted with honey butter for breakfast. It is also great for grilled cheese. Made it the old fashion way since I don't have nice kitchen toys, but it was easy and really worth it. I halved the recipe. Baked one loaf right away and froze the other two. I took out the frozen to bake several weeks later and it was just as good.

Awesome recipe!  I have used the same recipe for quite a while and loved it.  However, this bread is my new go to!  I love that oatmeal is added.  I was given 15 lbs of oats, and needed to find a way to use them up.  I found this recipe, and wow!  I will be buying oatmeal after I run out and continue making this!  I made 4 minor changes:  I used half oil and half soy lecithin.  I also added dough enhancer and vital wheat gluten (2 tbsp of each).  In addition, I used honey in place of sugar.

This is the only bread recipe that comes out light and fluffy every time. I usually reverse the amounts of whole wheat and bread flour for a darker and more fiber rich bread. Also, I usually make rolls instead of loaves, count on 2 servings per roll when scaling down the recipe. I bake the rolls at the given temperature for 14 minutes. The formed rolls freeze very well: just freeze in a freezer bag right after forming them. To bake, get them out of the freezer the night before and let them thaw in the fridge. When completely thawed, let them rise and bake as usual.

So easy to make!  This was my first attempt at bread and it turned out great. The crust was crisp and the crumb was soft, but not crumbly so we could spread butter/mayo/peanut butter easily without a mess. Perfect for sandwiches,  but I'm wondering if anyone has added anything to it to dress it up, we'll have to look around the reviews.  My husband said that he bets some herbs baked into the dough would be amazing...still a very good bread. And sooo easy to make :)

The first time I made it with All Purpose Flour instead of wheat because I was out and it was ok but when I made it with the whole wheat flour OMG this was outstanding.  They only issue I ever seem to have making it is it never is done start to finish in 3 hours or less though usually takes at least 4-5

I've made this recipe twice using a combination of an electric hand mixer and old-school kneading, and each time it came out great!  (I have "wow" written down on the recipe.) The only things I did different from the recipe were (1) I cut the recipe down to 2 loaves and (2) it took 33 minutes in my oven. I'm not an experienced bread maker, so I was thrilled to find this recipe and have it turn out so well. Thanks!

This is a reliable straightforward recipe!  It is an excellent recipe to use to make sandwich bread.  It is firm and easy to slice, but soft.  It has whole wheat and oats, but doesn't appear or taste like "healthy" bread to my children, so they eat it without complaint.  I cannot make the whole recipe at once-I use my KitchenAid and it is too much. So, I generally make 2/3 of a recipe-roughly 4 loaves (I usually make 3 large loaves).  I tried the freezing the raw dough to store it, but I did not like it, so I generally cook all loaves, slice them and freeze them.  It works great!

This has become my favorite base bread recipe.  I replace most of the bread flour with whole wheat flour and add grains and seeds and it always makes a wonderful loaf of bread.  When I go below 2 cups of bread flour I add 1 or 2 tbs of Virtual Gluten and it has never failed to make beautiful loaves.

Awesome! Since this recipe makes so much I used it last year as my "food gift" with a jar of homemade jelly. This bread also freezes beautifully. I made mine without a bread machine and it came out perfect, just be sure to use the biggest bowl you have for mixing/rising, you will need it! Happy Baking and thank you to J. Drury for submitting! This recipe has become my everyday bread, I bake a batch freeze all but one loaf and thaw and use them as needed, NO MORE BUYING BREAD FOR ME! :)

This was tasty and easy- especially with the standing mixer. I think I'll do 9x5 loaves next time- the 8x4 is a little tiny for sammies.

I have made this recipe about 6 times now and have switched up the flour to make it more wheat than white, etc and it has been really good each time.  Everyone loves my homemade bread.  Even gave it as gifts this year for Christmas!

Great recipe.   Easy to make.  I served a loaf with dinner and everyone loved it.  I froze the rest after slicing the bread and used the bread for hamburger rolls, sandwiches, and toast with eggs for breakfast.  I am new to baking bread and this is the 2nd recipe i've ever tried so anyone can make great bread.

This was really good bread and I followed the advice of another review and froze the other 4 loaves. But, my bread never rose again after I took it out of the freezer. I'm so bummed! Anyone know what could have happened during the freezing/thawing process?

My favorite bread recipe. I admit, these loaves barely have time to cool before I've eaten half of one.  Nothing on it, just lovely warm bread.

This makes a nice sandwich bread with reasonably interesting flavor, considering it has such a quick rise.  I tend to favor breads that are made with a long slow rise for the best flavored breads, but this was very convenient for producing several loaves in a short time.  I froze them and take them out a loaf just when I need bread for several sandwiches at one time.

I have been looking for the perfect sandwich bread recipe for a few years now, I finally found it ! Thank you, thank you , thank you.  My 4 year old and I ate 2 loaves in 1 day, yum !! I am going to share this with her Waldorf kindergarten class this coming school year ( the kids make their own bread for lunch at school ). 
The only thing that I did different ( by mistake ) was I used white sugar and not the brown, but it still was awesome.

This is a really great recipe for a standard loaf of sandwich bread that is really beginner friendly.. it comes together very well. I cut the recipe to make 2 loaves but I followed the recipe except that I used old fashioned oats, which I ground up in a food processor a bit before I added them and I used honey instead of brown sugar. I don't have a mixer so I kneaded by hand for about 10 minutes. I'm just getting into bread baking, this is probably my 15th attempt or so, and it came out absolutely perfect, just what I was looking for in a sandwich loaf. Thanks so much for a great basic recipe.

I am making my third batch today. The first batch tasted awesome but it didn't rise. I figured out that the water was not warm enough. 
The second batch did rise wonderfully.
Today I made the dough as perfectly as possible and like the first batch, it has only risen about 1/3 of what I was expecting/lead to believe it should and this is the first rising. 
I'm about to give up on this recipe. 
I keep trying because every seems to rave about it. 
I don't have a mixer so I am mixing with a fork until I get about 3 cups of flour in, then I switch to hand mixing.

This really IS fabulous! My expectations weren't that high being that it's bread (I'm more of a pie and ice cream kind of girl!) but it blew me away. Perfect consistency and texture and very easy. Will definitely be making this again!

This bread recipe was fabulous!  I'm not an experienced bread maker, but found the instructions clear and easy to follow.  One problem I had was that the recipe made way too much for my KitchenAid Artisan mixer (I had quite a mess and ended up pulling it out and mixing/kneading by hand).  Next time I will have to make 1/2 batch at a time to make it more managable for my mixer.  I baked all the loaves and froze a few for later.  It tasted just as good after it had been frozen.  After reading other reviews, I plan to try freezing a few loaves of dough next time too.  Thanks for a great recipe that's even easy for beginners!

This is the best bread recipe I've tried so far, especially for sandwiches. My husband even said he liked it, and the crazy man prefers white bread from the grocery store to anything I've made.

This is perfect bread!  The whole house smells wonderful and the taste is even better.  I have made this one several times now and the last batch I made was the best (practice has helped) I made french toast with the last loaf as it was already two weeks old bread and getting a bit hard, this was the best french toast I ever made according to my teenage kids.

I love this bread!  I just started making my own homemade bread and I am very happy with how this one turned out.  I have 9x5 bread pans, so that meant that I made two loaves and froze two loaves, instead of having 6 loaves as discussed in the recipe.  The taste is great and even my pickiest eaters enjoyed the bread.  I did this all by hand as I don't have a mixer, so that wasn't a problem either.

I could only get in 8 cups flour. I'm guessing because the air is so dry. The rest of the recipe I followed and my bread fell! The taste was good. I also rolled out some and made a pepperoni cheese loaf. That was very good. Why would it fall? It was quiet here. Any suggestions?

How can you ever go back to store bought after trying this recipe? I use regular oatmeal and will alter my bread flour to wheat flour ratio. I've used as much as half (6 cups) of whole wheat flour and had it turn out fine.

We don't buy bread anymore. I make this recipe every week. Super easy to make and very delicious!! I used 75% Whole wheat and 25% white flour and substituted the sugar for honey. So I had a Oat honey wheat bread!! Fabulous!! :P

I must have made a mistake. I froze my extra loaves and when I thawed them in the fridge and then set them out they did not cook right. They didn't rise. I wouldn't really say it's the recipes fault. Maybe I just need to try again.

Light, airy, rose nicely. Made 1/3 recipe in 2 9x5" loaf pans (using Allrecipes scale feature, scaled to 24 servings, used those measurements). I might add more whole wheat plus a bit extra water, as I prefer heartier breads, but this worked out just fine.

BEST bread I've ever made.  My mixer isn't big enough and I had to switch to mixing by hand half-way through.  Other than switching the Tbsp. sugar to honey, I followed it exactly and it's perfect!

This was a great bread, a great place to start.  I replaced the bread flour with equal parts white and whole wheat and it still yielded soft slices.  I'll get my kids hooked and slowly replace the white flour with whole wheat.  It is slightly intoxicating right out of the oven.

Bread is good and tasty.  However, the texture is something I need to get used to.  I will cut the recipe in half next time.  6 loaves is a bit much. I froze 2 cooked loaves and 3 uncooked.

This bread is delicious. What sets it apart from other bread recipes for me, is that it is the prefect chewiness (I think the oats have something to do with this.)  I didn't use bread flour - just regular all purpose flour. I didn't use wholewheat flour either, but I did add about 1/4 cup wheat bran. I divided the recipe in thirds, which yielded 2 loaves.  I definitely recommend this one!

My husband and I love sourdough, but, we were looking for a whole wheat recipe to keep it healthier and were surprised at the awesome"sourdough like"flavor of this bread. It was easy and fun to do together. We halved the recipe and froze 2 loaves in a loaf shape (flour a plastic bag first). This was very easy, just thaw in the fridge the night before, turn the oven on to 100 to 150 degrees than shut oven off and let it rise in the oven for an hour and then bake; it's truly that easy. We would have liked the bread to rise more, but the flavor makes up for the size. Next time will add a little more yeast or dough to the pan.

I make bread quite a bit.  I never have great luck with wheat bread for some reason.  It usually comes out dense and flavorless.  But this is an amazing recipe.  I halved the recipe in case it didn't turn out....wished I hadn't.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I don't use bread flour because it is so expensive, I use white flour and add 1 tsp of gluten per cup of flour.  It is way cheaper then bread flour and does the trick.  I noticed though that there are no kneading instructions.  So I just kneaded it like my other bread recipes for about 2-4 minutes and until it had a good texture.  The bread turned out soft and wonderful!!!  Great recipe, thanks for sharing. I have five boys and they loved it and so did my "I only like white bread" husband.

I have baked breads for a long time. Mixed by hand, mixer, breadmashine.
I have been searching for a recipe that is healthy and easy. THIS IS IT!!!!
I have been baking these breads since Thanksgiving, and I always make the whole batch. I make 4 loaves out of the amt. given or make rolls. I always experiment with new ideas for this bread. I add seeds, spices, toppings, fresh herbs (add a little more flour for moist additives) and everyone LOVES this bread. You can substitute the wheat flour with rye flour or other flours. Serve it with your favorite herbal butter and its the best bread you have ever tasted. I always bake all the breads at once and then freeze 3 of them in an airtight bag and defrost them when needed. I froze half of the dough once and then defrosted it in the fridge, then let it rise again outside. For some reason it was still a little unbaked on the inside, I guess I should have let it defrost or bake it a little longer. This recipe is almost foolproof and is totally worth it. I mix it with the dough hooks of my handheld mixer. 
I don't buy bread anymore. LOVE IT, thank you for sharing the recipe with others.

I love this recipe so much.  I unfortunatly have a smaller kitchen aid mixer and either I cut the recipe to make four loaves ,or make it up to six cups of bread flour and do the rest by hand.  Nothing wrong with a litte elbow grease, but when you have kids running around its hard to give it more time.  I use this bread to make bread crums; which by the way check out the Alaskan Salmon Bake on this site or you can use it to make the bread pudding II recipe. My Husbands Nanna looks forward to me bringing her bread every week.  Its just right and so much better for you.  One of my kids can't stand oatmeal and doesn't even know its in it. Ha Ha.  I don't know what else I can say about it.  It really is easy and quick, considering that your making bread, but 6 loaves.  Thats a weeks worth of bread in our house.  I'm just hoping to get a bigger mixer soon. lol.

Makes good bread for a PBJ.  This is the second bread recipe I've ever made in as many weeks.  I only wanted to make one loaf and so I divided the measurements by six.  One ninth cup of brown sugar?  Ended up doing my best with the measurements, used a wooden spoon and my hands, and it turned out great. Give it a try.

this was the first bread I have ever attempted to make, and it made me very confident to go out explore other recipes!  it was sweet, so i wouldn't use it for sandwiches, but it makes a very yummy snack and toast in the morning!  i can only imagine what the french toast or a bread pudding would be like because we didn't have any left over!  definitely will make this again!  also, it was a lot of dough!  but i am blaming this suprise on my novice skills.

I really wanted to give this recipe 4 stars. I didn't want to believe all the hype. WOW! The only adjustment I made was to use 1/3 EVOO and 1/3 butter instead of vege oil. I could only fit just over 8 C. of the flour. Made 6 mini loaves and 2 med loaves!!! AMAZING!

Fabulous. I added sesame seeds, flax seeds and soy protein powder to this recipe and my kids devoured it.

This was well worth the work.  By mistake I used white sugar instead of brown and it still taste great.  My son loved it, best bread ever he said.  I divided the dough up and then froze half of it.  This would be a great side to bring to a dinner or give to friends.  I never usually make bread but this is worth it!!

This bread was pretty good.  Nothing incredible, just really good, basic bread.  We're having to cut costs and this recipe helps, plus homemade bread is wonderful.  I mixed mine in my Kitchen Aid and it went well - though I recommend doing a minute or two of hand kneading to mix in all the little bits.  Made just one loaf and a whole bunch of buns that I made in muffin tins.  Next time I want to add some herbs & spices, or maybe some seeds for different tastes.  But as is it makes very good sandwich bread.  Also good if you make thick slices and make into garlic bread.

Baked this today and messed up ending up with an underdone loaf but the taste was so good I didn't care that it was underdone and couldn't stop eating! Now that I know what I did wrong, I'll definitely make this again and if all goes well it will probably turn out really soft and fluffy.

I've been trying in vain to make bread that is fluffy and does not taste like saltines for a while now, and I finally succeeded in graduating past that with this recipe. I did not have bread flour and only had one pack of dry yeast so I thirded the recipe. I added some vital wheat gluten to normal white flour as a previous reviewer recommended, and I added a squeeze of honey into the flour as well.

I guess where I went wrong in the past is that I didn't let the bread rise in the bread pan. I did that this time and now I have DELICIOUS, fluffy, thick, slightly chewy, filling bread. I plan to use this recipe for bread for now on... eating fresh homemade bread with butter and honey is more of a delight to me than homemade cookies with milk.

Simply fabulous! I made this bread for the first time and it turned out really great.  I used instant dry yeast, and substituted the sugar with honey as suggested by other reviewers.  Will definitely be making it again soon.  Thanks J. Drury and your mother for this great recipe.

I just made a batch. It's the first time I've made bread and was glad to have this recipe. It was very easy. Smells great, looks good. It's still cooling but I am sure it will taste just as good as it smells.

This bread was perfect.  I don't have a mixer, so I made it by kneading.  I was afraid it would be too sweet, but it was wonderful.  I didn't have quick cooking oats, so I used regular (without grinding them like others have) and I couldn't tell a difference.  This bread has great texture and crust.  I will be making this bread weekly.

I cut this recipe in half and it made two beautiful large loaves of bread. The crust was tender and vastly superior to a bread machine loaf. I kneaded mine by hand since I do not have a mixer. I wish I could give this recipe more than five stars. The taste was superb. I also like the health benefit of the oats and whole wheat flour.

I really like the flavor of this bread and the family goes crazy. I do add more yeast and honey. The only problem is that both times the loaves have fallen after being put in the oven. Any ideas?

I made this recipie today, and oh boy does it make quite a bit of dough.  Since I had only 3 loaf pans, I made rolls.

I wouldn't change anything, followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderfully.  I will definately make this again.

This bread is incredible! I have never baked bread from scratch and I was a little nervous. I only made half of the recipe because I was afraid of having 6 bad loaves of bread LOL. Instead I ended up with 2 of the tastiest loaves of bread plus a few rolls on the side.  It was easy. I had regular oats so I shredded them in the food processor to make oat flour.  I also substituted a cup of bread flour with 1/2 c wheat germ and 1/2 cup flax seed. The whole family loved it - but it was gone fast. So I am making the full batch today!

This is a fabulous bread recipe! I haven't ever had much luck making homemade bread. It always turned out like a brick, until this one! It was light and fluffy. I assembled and kneaded it in my new stand mixer, and I only made a half-batch. I don't think I used quite as much flour as the scaled back recipe recommended, maybe 1/2 to 1 cup less. I also made 2 instead of 3 loaves, and they were big and beautiful, way over the top of the pan. Both big loaves are almost gone in 2 days! I will definitely make this again.

Very good bread - This one will become a standard for bread and buns for us. My niece who visits often is Vegan so 
I love that this has no egg, milk product or animal fats yet is super delicious.
Thanks for sharing this recipe !

My very first time to make homemade bread.  I was a little nervous, but gave it a go...AND...FANTASTIC! I even kneaded the doe with my bare hands, after using my hand held mixer! (not a good idea, by the way).  Immediately after cooled, I ate two slices with crunchy peanut butter. YUM!

This was the first time I made bread and it turned out great. The instructions for kneeding were not that great and if you try to scale it in half I found that it was too dry and I had to add another cup of water. My picky 5 yr old practically ate a half loaf so that is saying something about the taste. I think that I will try honey next time and maybe just a pinch more salt. All in all a very good recipe.

This is a wonderful bread recipe.  I use my Bosch to mix it up and it is done in a snap!  I also add grains to give the bread a little more texture and extra white sugar to sweeten it a little more.

This bread is wonderful! I had to sneak a slice before the loaves had finished cooling. It was still fluffy, yet dense, with a nice flavour. I didn't have any bread flour, or gluten, so I upped the yeast and it still turned out great. This was my first time baking a yeast bread - reading the other glowing reviews gave me the courage to try it. I followed the recipe as given, using all-purpose flour throughout, and added a cup of bran. Fabulous!

This was a really nice, easy recipe. I substituted maple syrup for the sugar, but other than that, followed exactly. The end product was a little dense, not quite as airy as I was hoping - but I may not have let the dough rise enough before popping it into the oven (it's really cold in my house and I have to double or even triple typical rising times). I will make this again.

This recipe was WONDERFUL!  I had baked these a few days before we had a power outage...so all the neighbors came over and they tried it and were amazed.  One neighbor wouldn't even eat it with jam because he just wanted the taste of the bread.  I've made it twice, once forgetting the salt and another accidentally putting in white instead of brown sugar.  Both times it was fantastic.  This one's going in my recipe box.

Wonderful bread!  I wasn't sure my family would go for such a health recipe  which included wheat flour and oats, but they loved it!  I used no electronics for mixing and it wasn't that difficult and turned out beautiful!  Thanks for sharing such an awesome recipe.  I plan to make this on a regular basis in place of store bought bread!

Very good.  I have made this twice now and plan on using it as a regular for our family.  There is nothing quite like good, homemade bread.

This is a wonderful bread recipe.  Ive never made bread successfully before and this loaf turned out perfectly.  I made only one loaf instead of multiple ones because I didnt want to get stuck with a lot of dough that didnt turn out right.  Its absolutely fantastic and Id definitely make it again.  Next time I might even play with the ingredients by using honey like another reviewer suggested and maybe even some whole grain flour.  In any case this recipe is a winner.  Thanks.

The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars is because it really did look fabulous and have a terrific texture. Unfortunately, that doesn't do much for me if the bread ends up having less flavor than Wonderbread.

Very good!  I just had my first slice of this bread and it's delicious.  The recipe was simple enough to follow and it turned out just right.  I even mistakenly put 2/3 cup of white sugar instead of the brown sugar and it turned out just fine.  I can't wait for my kids to try it first thing tomorrow morning as part of their breakfast!  Thank you for sharing!

This bread recipe is simple and always turns out wonderfully. Sometimes I replace the wheat flour with all-purpose if I want an even lighter texture but only occasionally. I usually halve the recipe so it will fit in my mixer.

I normally don't post reviews, but WOW, this bread is great!  I think everything went wrong in the baking process for me, and it still turned out fabulous.  I ended up having to put it in the refrigerator for a while, because I didn't have enought time to finish it.  I just took it out several hours later, let it finish rising, then put it in the oven, and it still tasted better than basically any other bread like it I've ever tasted.  I definately reccomend  it!

Outstanding recipe for a very light textured, moist, and mild flavored bread.  One half the posted recipe makes TWO wonderfully tall 8-4 inch loaves.  Perfect for sandwiches or just enjoying by itself.

I'm on my second try with this recipe.  First time I divided the recipe and used 3 9" loaf pans.  Although the dough had rised to the top of the pan, it actually shrank while baking, so they turned out flat.  Taste great, but very thin.  Today I'm trying again with 2 loaf pans, and they're looking much better.  Still, though, they are deflating somewhat from when I put them in the oven.  Is this normal??  I read another review which talked about how much they puff up!  I'm using a KitchenAid mixer with the dough hook.  Could that be part of my problem?  Any advice?

This recipe is the best!  I've already made it several times and it turns out great each and every time!  After the first go-round I added more wheat flour and the bread still turned out delicious.  I also make 3 LARGE loaves instead of 6 small - and I have to finish kneeding by hand because my 5qt kitchenaid gets overwhelmed by all the dough.  Great recipe!

This was only my second attempt at baking bread.  The first attempt, using a different recipe (not on this site) was tasty but otherwise crumbly and dry.  I chose this recipe because of all the raves plus the fact that it's a little lower calorie than most of the other whole wheat recipes. I used half wheat flour and honey, and my bread came out just great!  It tastes wonderful and even looked good.  It was also very easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe!  I substitute 1/2 cup of wheat germ for 1/2 cup of the wheat flour, just to give it more nutritious goodness!  I also substitute regular oats for quick oats and it gives it that wholesome feeling.  Easy and rewarding!

I am a novice breadmaker and found this recipe to be a snap using my standing mixer.  I cut the recipe in half, and it turned out great.  This is a nice, soft bread -- perfect for toast and sandwiches.  Like some of the other reviewers, I will increase the proportion of whole wheat flour the next time I make this recipe for a different taste and to increase the nutritional value.

Yum! This is an easy recipe with great results. I used mostly whole-wheat flour because I ran out of white flour after 2 cups. oops. but the bread still turned out great with a nice flavour and great texture.

I would definately give this 100 stars if i could.  I waited to make this until after I read alot of the reviews.  I made this today and I made 3 loaves.  This is the best bread I have made.  I made it with whole wheat flour and all purpose flour it came out moist, delicious and very soft.  I am very impressed.  Thank you for the best  bread receipe ever.  I will keep making this bread.  I love it!!!!

I made it just as written except I forgot to put the flour in the proofing mix of yeast, sugar and water.  I also used honey in place of the brown sugar.  This is very similar in taste and texture to the normal bread recipe I use, except it's a bit healthier with the whole wheat flour. My kids ate all the rolls and half of one loaf before I knew it! Hubby and I enjoyed it with lemon curd.

This recipe is fabulous, as written, and it is still fabulous if you double the whole wheat flour (reducing the bread flour accordingly).  It is still good if you tip the ratio even farther in favor of whole wheat, but maybe not fabulous anymore.

Had to cut recipe in 3 to get 1 large loaf.  Used rolled oats soaked and 1/3 flour einkorn whole wheat . Went together well , baked for 35min @350. Should have done an IT on it as the loaf was underdone. Taste is great! Cant wait to try next one baked for 40+ min and drain the oats!

Made this bread today with no substitutions. This is the best bread recipe I’ve ever had. Thank you for sharing it with us all. I have 5 more loaves in the freezer and the best part is, we know every single ingredient that went into it.

Great recipe - easy to make and bread was delicious! Only problem was that this recipe could easily be halved if you just want 2-3 loaves. I used the whole recipe and the dough was so abundant it overflowed my Kitchenaid Stand Mixer to the point where sticky dough was squeezing up into the mixing head. I spent an hour picking dough out of the mixer's innards with a toothpick. Other than that, a perfect recipe.

My go to bread recipe every time and I have made bread for years. Love the quantity and the  foolproof recipe.  I bake the bread, let it cool and put the left overs in the freezer.  So good!  Love it for everything, sandwiches, toast, buns, etc. Best bread recipe ever!

First off, let me say: I am not a baker. I cook; my wife bakes. But, I tried my hand at this one. I cut the recipe for just 2 loaves, and had pretty good luck if I do say so myself. Definitely a keeper.

Beautiful bread. I make this with whole wheat flour and sometimes brown sugar instead of white, but the recipe itself is perfect. I love that it makes so many loafs at once. Bread is difficult, and if I’m going to the trouble, I like getting so many loafs.

I haven't tasted it yet as 2 loaves are still rising (I'm freezing 4 loaves for future as another recommended), BUT I would not make this amount again because I felt I needed commercial size equipment!  The bowl with my KitchenAid Mixer was filled to the top and I had to dig dough out of the head to clean it.  In this regard, I would be better off doing "manual mixing" (and getting the workout)!  Also, my biggest bowl would not have allowed the rising room, so I had to use a large 7 qt. pot and it still spilled over the sides.  The dough is definitely sticky and it should not touch ANYTHING that isn't floured first!  I have quite a mess to clean up.  I hope the taste is worth it.  If so, I will work on adjusting it to 2-3 loaves max.

Can't really give the bread a rating on The Taste but I am disappointed in the recipe the recipe calls for brown sugar but nowhere in the recipe did it say when to add it so I forgot to put it in and now it's too late cuz the breads already in the oven cooking and I didn't realize I had forgot to add the brown sugar and tell now I hope I didn't waste my time on making bread that isn't going to taste good I can't believe no one has fixed this am I the only one that recognized it

Made this to the exact recipe. Turned out really good. My first attempt was eaten with chili that i also got from this website. Absolutely phenomenal.  Bread is a little too sweet for me but my wife loves it this way. Cheers

Started baking bread again and couldn't be happier with this recipe! My family and friends were amazed as well. Taste & texture is absolutely fabulous-a definite repeat for us!
As well- morning toast with butter has new meaning with this bread!

Oh my gosh! I've made LOTS of bread over the years.... this one is the best EVER!! Soft, light, sweet...  
 I wasn't paying attention when I was adding the flour. I accidentally added two extra cups of the wheat flour. When I realized my mistake I added the white  bread flour and kept on mixing, hoping it would come out OK. It's DELICIOUS AND PERFECT! Will be making this one often!

Smells great and the taste is very good, but honestly I used at least 13 cups of flour and the dough was still very slack but I stopped adding flour at that point . Either I really made an error in measuring the liquid or this recipe is off.  The loaves did not crown properly at all.  Im an xperinced bread maker so this is frustrating that my loaves aren't pretty, but they are very tasty!!

I have been experimenting with home made sandwich breads and this is the best one so far. I didnt have 10 + cups of bread flour, so I mixed about 8 cups of all purpose flour and two.5 cups of bread flour in a mixing bowl and then added it cup by cup to the liquids. Another thing I altered was accidental- I used 2 tablespoons of white granulated sugar, when I realized the mistake I added in a tablespoon of brown sugar incase there was an issue with consistency. The loaves came out perfectly. We only needed two loaves to get us through the week, so I froze the remaining 4 portions before the 2nd rise in saran wrap and then put all 4 sections of dough in a freezer gallon bag. Im so excited I found this recipe- it is absolutely fabulous

Seemed entirely too easy and turned out spectacular!!!  I was skeptical since it didn't require kneading and since I tend to mess up most things that require yeast as I live at a very high elevation, however, this recipe is just awesome.  So very thankful for this recipe.

First time making this homemade bread.  I started in my kitchen aide mixer, but realized, with the standard bowl and the hook, this needed a much bigger bowl!  I kneaded the bread by hand.  No problem!
It turned out fantastic.  I made 2 bigger ones and 3 smaller ones.  
Delicious!

I have made it a few times now, I let it rise in the oven with the proof setting. I have not tried it since I have moved to a colder climate, but the result is a loaf with no holes in it, great tasting and love it for sandwiches!

I used more freshly ground whole wheat flour to increase the nutrition and flavor, about 5 or 6 cups with the same amount of white bread flour. Turned out great!

The first time I halved the recipe and loved it. I used my  Bosco mixer it will only hold 1/2 the recipe. since then I added 1/3 of a cup of sunflower seeds and this is great the wife loves it , so do I. I have also added 1/4 cup mixed crushed grains and a 1/3 cup sun flower seeds   the doe needed more water , I added 40 ml about    turned out great

Used olive oil in place of vegetable oil. The recipe amount is quite large so it taxed even my pro kitchen aid mixer using a hook. But overall pretty simple to make. Makes great bread. I used a large bundt pan and used 1/3 of total dough/2 loaves, and put cheese in the middle. Came out terrific and looked really nice and was super easy to cut. I have made it two consecutive weekends. Recipe is a keeper.

I'm giving this bread 5 stars despite the fact it didn't turn out quite the way should have. This was not the recipe's fault, which is a good and tasty recipe, but my fault for causing the dough to fall. It wasn't a total dinner catastrophe thanks to the sweet delicious flavor of the bread itself, which is why it is still getting 5 stars. The recipe was easy enough, delicious and made a nice complement to homemade chicken soup.

Absolutely delicious (I am eating it warm now). The recipe is very easy too! I think I will be making this recipe quite often. One of the reviewers recommended freezing the dough. I could see doing that also.

The one thing I changed on purpose, is I used salted butter in place of the oil. I make that change in any recipe I make. I enjoy the real butter taste.

I have never made bread before. This was a first. I followed the recipe and everything happened the way it was supposed to.

Before I put the bread in the oven, I smeared butter on top of the loaves and added some oats to the top. Although they did not stick, the bread came out with a beautiful crust on top.

A new favorite for me!

Excellent bread. Or I sound say Fabulous. I halved the recipe because I only have 4 bread pans :) I used regular AP flour and only had old fashioned oats so I used those.

This has become the staple bread recipe in our house; I make half the amount, so three loaves almost every week, though I have played with the recipe a bit to tweak it to our satisfaction; I use all brown sugar rather than white, and I increase the amount to 1/2 cup; also increase the oats to about 1.5 cups. My husband generally eats an entire loaf in about a day and a half by himself, and people request me to bring it in at work. Quite delicious!

Thank you so much for this recipe! I love bread but have never attempted to make it before. This was so easy and turned out great. We couldn't eat 6 loaves so I shared a loaf with several family members and everyone loved it!

I made this bread with whole wheat and all-purpose flour instead of bread flour, and for every cup of regular flour I added 1 tsp of wheat gluten. From the beginning my yeast did not seem to bubble, and when I checked on the dough after the first rising it was the exact same size as when I left it! I scrapped the second rising and put the dough in the oven, divided into four loaves because of the lesser volume. They took an extra 10 min (approx.) to bake because they are more dense, but baked evenly and rose nicely like a regular loaf of bread. All in all, the bread tastes just OK (a little chewy) and I have definitely made better but this is likely to do with it not really rising.

I have started baking my own bread and am trying out different recipes. This bread is fabulous!  I put the oats in a coffee grinder as another suggested and it worked great.  I also used the recipe calculator for two loaves. Although the recipe called for 8x4 bread pans, if you convert to two loaves, 9x5 are perfect. The 8x4's would have been too small. Husband, who is a white bread eater loves this bread too!

This is my 3rd time making it.  I've shared this bread w/friends and family and they all loved it.  I've made rolls, loaves and mini loaves too.  The mini loaves are perfect when you slice them they are about the size of crackers, although I cut mine thicker and get maybe 3-4 mini slices.  I just add 1 tablespoon of caraway seeds in the dough and it flavors the bread in such a good way.  Everyone thought I bought it at a specialty bakery store.  HA! Thanks so very much for this recipe.

Ths should be renamed "Dangerous Homemade Bread". Holy cow- this is soooo good.  I have to halve the recipe for a couple of resons: 1.We'll eat the 6 loaves in the same amount of time we'd eat 3. (Sadly by "we" I mean me.) And 2.It makes such a HUGE blob of rising dough it surprised my husband who found it overtaking the dishwasher. *That's where I let it rise in my cold, unevenly heated kitchen.  I put it in an empty dishwasher and then set it on the "heated dry" setting. Perfect.

Anyways- perfect bread.  Fluffy and soft, but solid enough to hold up to spreading peanut butter.

My family loved this.  I had never made bread from scratch before, only in a machine, so I was a little nervous at the start, but this recipe is so easy that I had no trouble.  My son told me that I should stop buying bread at the store and just make this all the time.  YUMMY!!  YUMMY!!  YUMMY!!

Bread turned out so delicious and hearty.  All my family loved it, and it is much more nutritious and cost-effective than store bought bread.  Froze the extra loaves so we are stocked up on bread for a while!  Excellent as toast.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe I will use again and again!

This is the most wonderful bread and very easy to make.  It's the only bread my husband and I eat now.  I make up the entire recipe and then freeze the extra loaves for later.  Smells so yummy while toasting in the morning!!  Love it!

This was SOOOOO good!  I have never made bread before, and don't have a large mixer with a dough hook, so I did it by hand.  It was quite easy, and the bread is probably the best bread I have ever tasted. We ate it with spaghetti one night, and with soup the next.  I will definitely make this again!

I'm new to bread making and I have to say this is the easiest yet most delicious bread I've made so far. It was a hit for my kids. My husband and kids ate a loaf and a half within 20 mins of it being out of the oven. So amazing and delicious! Thanks so much!

I've made MANY recipes from this website and this is the only one that has prompted me to write a review. YUM YUM! This bread is very little work for what the outcome is. It has a lightly sweet flavor, is tender and chewy and not at all crumbly. This is the best homemade bread recipe I've made, and I've made quite a few. I will not be buying store-bought bread anymore since this is so easy and so delicious without all the nasty preservatives/additives. I'm glad I found this recipe to use for my kid's sandwiches too. 

I made the full recipe, which gets to be a little much if you use the standard Kitchen Aid stand-up mixer. The dough was coming out of the bowl when I was using the dough hook to knead it.
However, it is great to get 6 loaves of homemade bread (we froze 4). Also, I ended up using only 9 cups of bread flour vs 10.

Happy bread making!

I have tried other homemade bread recipes before and my famliy of 6 was never too thrilled about them. They couldn't get enough of this recipe and ate all 4 loafs in 2 day's (other 2 loafs we gifted out) and are requesting more. I didn't have brown sugar so substituted with 1/3 cup 100% Pure Maple Syrup.

Delicious Bread!!!! There are only two of us, and we don't go through bread that fast so I only make one loaf at a time! I think it is a perfect mixture of wheat, white, and oat! I mixed everything by hand, and if it turns out that says a lot! :) Don't overcook your bread tho!  I did that on the first batch and it dried out very fast.

I've been baking bread for awhile now and I was on the hunt for the perfect go to recipe. I found it. It was awesome, moist and hearty. My family LOVED it! froze a few of the extra loaves to pull out another day. WONDERFUL!!! Thank you for sharing.

Amazingly yummy! I was silly and accidentally used white sugar instead of brown, but it was still awesome! I also made only four loaves, but two were in a 9X 5 bread pan.

too dense.  dough was crazy sticky even after adding more flour to dry it out.  Tasted fine, probably won't make again.

This was the first bread recipe (involving yeast) that I had ever made. It came out excellent and tasted wonder. This bread has a great  texture, however, if you want to use it for sandwhich bread, let it sit overnight and it firms up a bit. It is absolutely delicious.

This is the best bread I have made ever! I have tried lots of recipes and none compare.  It was so easy to slice.  I made a batch of 3 loaves.  Followed directions to the T. Wonderful - even made hamburger buns out of one batch.  My only issue was it didn't rise as much as I thought it would. I'm thinking that was my yeast/warm area issue though.  Also, I did everything by hand and kneaded the dough by hand. Thank you J. Drury!!

Delicious!  The only changes I made were that I added about a half cup of Flaxseed, used regular white flour for the bread flour, and did not use brown sugar.

This is hands-down my favorite bread. I make 4 large loaves, rather than 6 smaller ones. I keep 2 of them and the other 2 I deliver to friends and family who could benefit from a loaf (just had a baby, sick, going through a hard time, etc.). Thank you for this amazing recipe!

Tasty but not my grandmothers recipe.  Still searching for that slightly sweet very yeasty recipe that may have left this earth when she died.  This recipe is certainly easy and good, but not sure if it is worth the work?

Love this recipe. I tried to duplicate my mother's (measure by feel) recipe on several occasions with no success.  Finally found this recipe...VERY easy and the family loves it! I won't buy another loaf of bread from the store again!

Amazing bread.  I used honey instead of brown sugar and my family of 4 gobbled down the whole batch in 2 days.  I only got 3 loaves out of it, not 6, but this will be my go-to recipe from now on.

I'm new to breadmaking and don't have a mixer, but this bread came out great made by hand.  Best bread I've made yet.  I pared down recipe to make 2 loaves...next time I think I will make half the recipe and divide into two larger loaves.

The Bread came out a little too dry and had a very bland taste like it was missing something.  I make bread often and think I did everything correctly.  I won't make this one again.  It was edible and I used some for homemade croutons which were great.

HOLY MAZOOLY does this make a lot of dough!  My kitchen aid was overpowered by it.  It got up into the mechanism, so I hand-kneaded the last two cups of flour in.  The mixer wasn't fun to clean up.  I only have one loaf pan, so made rounds instead.  Well, one was the size of a pizza after rising!  (I read 3 loaves instead of 6, so that's part of my problem).  No matter how ugly or mis-shapen, my loaves, my rounds and my rolls all turned out perfectly.  I think next time I will half this recipe. Keeper!

I now figured out the problem, I added 3 TBSP yeast, because thats what our packages have in them. Oops maybe I should have read everyones post. Other then the yeasty taste, it turned out to be a very nice light bread. I will definately try again using the correct measurements.

YUM!  I love the subtle texture the oatmeal gives.  I substituted honey for brown sugar as another reviewer suggested.  I also substituted four cups of bread flour for whole wheat flour (6 cups total whole wheat flour), and added another packet of yeast because it didn't look like three would be enough.  I mixed and kneaded by hand--kneading took about 12 min.  My loaves were done in 30 minutes, baking as many as would fit on one full oven rack at a time.  As another reviewer suggested, I froze some loaves in oiled ziplock bags after the first rise and shaping them, then will thaw later, allow to rise, and bake.  It's a good thing I froze some, so we don't eat it all tonight!

This bread is so amazingly light and fluffy. I didn't want to make 6 loaves worth of dough, so I cut the recipe down to 1/3 (I only made 2 loaves) and it was great! The next day though I noticed the bread was a little dry even though I stored it in an airtight bag, so I think cutting the recipe either lost some water or gained some flour. I used my mixer most of the way, but hand-kneaded a lot of the flour. I ended up having to make it the next day for someone else who wanted to take it to a party, but in little muffin form! For that I just put a little dough in the bottom of well-greased pans, let them sit for another hour to rise, and baked for 15-17 minutes. They turned out just as perfect as the loaves. Just don't add too much flour - you want sticky dough when it comes to bread or you'll get a dry loaf.

This was great bread! I didn't adjust anything, just followed the directions, although I used my mixer at first, I had to knead in the last 3 cups of flour by hand. I do not have a bread machine so I made it in the oven. Everything else went perfectly. It's a nice level of density, not too fluffy/dry like some homemade breads can be but not heavy, either. My whole family loved it. It's delicious toasted with butter!

Great recipe.  Easy to make and is very very yummy.  I didnt add the entire 4 1/2 cup water, i just added 2 because it seemed like a lot.  had to add more then one cup of bread flour just with 2 cups of water.  But came out tasting wonderfully.

I loooooooooooove this bread! I cut the recipe in half and it worked out soo well. Next time I'll do the full recipe since the bread was eaten in no time.  In the recipe I only used white flour since it was all I had and it still came out great. One loaf I put cinnamon and raisins and swirled it and my husband loves it!

I only wanted to make one loaf so I down sized the recipe to 12 servings, bit it made a pretty small loaf. It tasted good. If I make it again I will try a 20 serving size.

This bread has been a huge hit with family and friends.  I scaled the recipe back to two loaves and make it in my bread machine on the dough cycle then bake it in the oven.  I do the yeast mixture in a small bowl then transfer it to the bread pan to let it grow but after I have done that I lose patience measuring out half spoonfuls of this and that so I changed the brown sugar and oil to 1/4 cup each to make it simpler.  I also add 1/3 cup of wheat bran (since it makes me think I am adding extra nutrition) and the end result is fabulous.  This bread freezes well and makes excellent toast.

This bread is fantastic!  I had to cut it in half because 6 loaves of bread is a lot.  It turned out light with a wonderful texture and was VERY easy to make.  I will absolutely continue making this bread and try some of the suggested variation in the reviews.

This bread is delicious! I cut the recipe down and used just whole wheat/white all purpose flour. It turned out soft and warm and my roommate could not have enough.

This really is a fantastic bread recipe. Bread always intimidated me but i make it all the time now! Generally, I substitute some whole wheat flour for the bread flour. I like to put flax seeds in it too. You can do anything with this recipe, it's great!

Fabulous is Right!  I didn't have quick cooking oatmeal so I used the regular and it worked fine also.  I made the 6 loaves and divided into 4 of the larger pans.  It was a huge hit, thanks for sharing.

This was my first attempt ever to make homemade bread.  I got a kitchenaid mixer for Christmas and felt I should learn to use it.  I had a similiar experience as another user in that I thought - well this isn't that great, but then couldn't stop eating it.  My children came home from school and three of them consumed one entire loaf.  I think this is a hit and a definite keeper.  Thank you for posting.

This bread really IS fabulous! I made it on Sunday and baked 2 loaves and froze the other 4. The bread was perfectly fluffy and delicious. Next time I would make 4 loaves out of the dough rather than six as I found them on the smaller side. I made this recipe in my KitchenAid mixer and it was very easy. Thank you so much!!

Unbelievable!  I have never made such flawless bread and so easy as well.  It was a perfect sandwich bread; I tried it first making a 1/3 batch and will follow up with a full batch and freeze the leftover loaves after the first 'rise'.  Also makes fantastic rolls (will work wonderfully as hamburger/hotdog rolls, it has such a soft crust).

I have made a reduced version of this recipe, using a small Kitchenaid that struggls to mix the dough, almost weekly since reading this recipe 3 months ago.  And I haven't made bread since I gave away my bread machine almost 3 years prior.  This recipe truly is excellent! I generally don't like to eat the crusts of bread. I like the crust on this bread. Everyone who has had this bread loves it.  I asked for a Bosch mixer for Christmas just to make making this bread easier and just got it and had to look up the original recipe amounts. Try it, you won't be disappointed. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

I made this for the first time last night. It was SO easy even without a mixer. I cut the recipe down to four loaves, and froze two. One of the baked loaves is already gone. I'd say it's a hit.

I made this recipe several months ago and my family loves it!  I stopped buying commercial bread and we only eat this bread now.  With my bread pans it comes out making 4 large loaves.  I keep 2 out and freeze the other 2.  This is the best bread I have ever made!  Oh, and the smell of it baking is intoxicating.  My husbands co-workers love it when he brings a loaf to share.  This is a staple recipe in our home now and I mix up this recipe usually every 2 weeks.

I have made this a few times now.  We love it!  I add a littel bit of honey and flax seed to mine but that is the ONLY thing I do differently.  Also, I have never had trouble making 6-8 loaves when I use the "throw away" pans.  The in-laws and the neighbors love it too.  I have printed this out for others many of times.

Used stone ground whole grain flour for the whole wheat and did not cut up the oatmeal and used walnut oil for vegetable oil. Only did 1/3 of the recipe and cooked one loaf and have another in the freezer for later.  This makes a pretty light loaf.  Thanks for sharing.

I have been using this recipe exclusively for quite awhile. I rarely buy store-bought bread anymore. My 12-year-old daughter made it a couple times too. Once she miss-read the recipe and added over 4 cups of oats and panicked! I told her just to add less flour and it would work itself out. It did and it was fantastic! Very hearty with the extra oats! Perfect recipe though it takes longer than 3 hours to make including cooking time.

I am new to this site and i have never baked bread before but wanted to try. I don't have a bread maker so i did this by hand. I followed everything to the point(except i made bigger loves of bread) and ended up with 4 loaves instead of 6. Well as i waited for it to bake in the oven i could smell fresh bread throughout the house(but was still wondering if it was going to taste good) oh my goodness i was so surpised at how delicious this tasted and the fact that i had made it. Very easy directions to follow and wonderful tasting bread, taste ALOT better than any regular bread i have tasted. Thank you for sharing this recipe. Definately going to be making this more often.

I've yet to actually rate anything on here but this recipe I had too! OH MY GOODNESS! Seriously. THe only thing I did differently was add alittle honey to the recipe. My family ate it up in less then two days flat. I only made enough for two loaves that time, this time around going to make the whole six loaves. Its awesome!

I cut mine to two loaves. Slightly disappointed because it didn't rise as well as it should have the second time(sat for two hours and only as high as a banana bread), but I baked it anyway and while it is flat and I can't make sandwiches of it, it is still very good and I hope next time is better!

This was my very first time baking bread ever. My 10 and 13 year old helped me knead it, it was fun for us to do! I read all of the reviews prior to even buying the ingredients and with such rave reviews I though how can I go wrong?! I added the honey option instead of brown sugar.  I halfed the recipe and made two large loaves and 12 cinnamin buns...absolutely incredible...  I really don't ever want to purchase store bought bread again, this bread is so delicious and I love that fact that you can substitute the brown sugar for all natural honey...way healthier.  Thank you so much for posting this recipe!

I'm pretty new to bread-making, so I was glad this turned out so well. I wasn't sure how long to knead (I don't have a Kitchenaid), and wheat dough is sticky to work with. I was afraid I was working in too much flour, so I only kneaded for 5 minutes or so. I did have to throw out the first batch because the oil I used was old, and the bread tasted rancid (luckily I had cut the recipe in half). In the next batch I substituted margerine for the oil, and  added about 1/4c honey for a little more sweetness. I might try some of the other suggested variations too next time. One more comment - I don't think the recipe as written makes 6 loaves (unless they are very small). I made two normal-sized loaves from 1/2 of the recipe. Yummy good.

I am always looking for a new bread recipe to try and this one is incredible.  I used "LTLWNG" review suggestion and added 1 cup of wheat bran and 1 cup of wheat germ and ommitted the oats. I used unbleached flour instead of the bread flour and it worked out well.  I also substituted turbinado sugar for the white and brown sugars.  My Kitchen Aid mixer just wasn't large enough so I had to hand mix in the last few cups of flour and then I kneaded it for about 5 more minutes.  I let it rise twice for an hour each time (punching down between rises)and then divided it.  I only have 4 bread pans so I made the remaining dough into dinner rolls...yummy!  My husband was waiting by the oven for them to be done and then he devoured a couple...My dear husband said I could make this bread every day and he wouldn't mind. (I think 6 loaves of bread a day would be a bit much but it proves this recipe is a winner!!!)We love it!!!!

Thanks so much for this recipe! I took the advice of other reviewers and halved the recipe. Froze two loaves for later after the first rise, and baked the third. Yum! Next time I'll try subing honey as others have suggested.

This recipe is so good! I've made it several times, and am now waiting for it to rise so I can bake it. I can't wait! I don't have a mixer big enough, but I find the kneading cathartic:)

If there were six stars, I'd gladly give them to you! This bread recipe if fantastic! The best I've tried so far. The only substitution I made was switching some of the white flour for more whole wheat. Still amazing. I'd recommend this recipe to anyone. Even my kids like it! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe with us! Definitely a keeper!

This is definitely a wonderful recipe for homemade, healthy bread.  We use it for sandwiches and toast.  Dividing the recipe in half makes a loaf and several rolls.

This was great, but I was confused about the lack of kneading. My bread did fall, so I am going to retry it with kneading this time. Otherwise it was very yummy! I am looking for a recipe to make all of our bread, and I may have found it!

The bread turned out perfect. I did not have quick oats so I used regular oats instead; otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The bread is tasty, chewy and soft. For the people who said this recipe didn't make six loaves, I had no problems getting the full amount. Just be careful not to punch the dough down too much after the first rising. This will be my standard bread recipe from now on.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out very tasty.  I think for my own personal tastes I'd prefer to add more oats or nuts to make it heartier.  I ate quite a bit of this with some whipped honey.

DELICIOUS! The only thing is that the texture was a little interesting. It was like a cross between bread & cake texture. I'm wondering whether this has to do with my kneeding? (or rather not enough of it). I kneeded it for about 5-7 mins. Or does it have to do with the fact that I used 1/2 wheat flour & 1/2normal flour?

I really like this bread. I only give it 4 stars because it falls apart easy. I love it toasted. By hand 6 loaves is a lot to knead, I customized it to 4 loaves and it was better.

Excellent bread. I thought I would have to freeze some because this is a very
large recipe, but heating 2 day old slices for a few seconds in the microwave makes them taste like they are freshly baked. Also great toasted.

Very good.  I quartered the recipe and it came out quite well. Didn't have a proper loaf pan, so I just rolled into a log -worked wonderfully.  Smelled amazing while baking in the oven.  I didn't find this bread quite as dense as I would like though - would increase the amount of whole wheat flour and oatmeal next time.

WOW!!!  I mixed this in my new Kitchenaid - it's the 6qt model so it had no trouble handling the amount of dough.  I had searched for a recipe to 'test' my mixer out :o).  The dough seemed a bit too sticky so I added one more cup of whole wheat flour - it still looked sticky but I didn't want to dry it out so I figured I would just see what happened!
 I set it to rise in my oven (then ran to the store because i realized that I only had 2 bread pans!!) Well, I took a bit longer than I wanted to.....kaboom!!! ;o)  Luckily, I only lost enough dough for about 1 loaf to the bottom of my oven.
 I finished making the loaves (wish i had read other reviews first about making less than 6 - or in my case - 5 loaves)
Anyway, I made 5 gorgeous loaves of bread last night - I think there are 1.5 left; and there are only 4 of us in this house!!! This truly is THE best bread I have ever made. Thanks for submitting this recipe :o)

I have made this bread numerous times and even though it falls in the oven every time, it is still tastes light and delicious.  I have tried  putting the bread in a cold oven and heating it slowly and putting it in a preheated oven.  Even though it falls, it is still one of the best breads I've ever made and will continue to make this recipe.

I have had many disasterous results when attempting to make bread, one time my kids used it for a football....this is the best ever!! I cut the recipe in half and it turned out far better than I expected. This one is going to be used quite often. Thank you so much J. Drury

This bread has a wonderful taste, and my 14 month old just loved it.  I made sandwiches with this bread, as it cut easily.  I too used a lot of wheat flour and just a couple cups of bread flour.

I was at the end of my rope with my bosch mixer.  It's been a pain to use for cookies, cakes, and not one bread recipe I tried worked with it.  It was headed for E-bay.  This recipe was the last chance for Boschy - and Hurray! it worked beautifully.  It's now a staple for my family (and I usually have an extra loaf to send over to my Mom :)  Three cheers for J. Drury and her Grandmother - thanks for sharing!

Absolutely fabulous. I cannot say a negative thing about this recipe for the second time I let the dough rise as long as it took my oven to preheat but it all came out great. In addition I added a tablespoon of butter with the yeast. My family and friends love this first timer.

I recently got married about a month ago and I made this recipe as part of our first homemade meal together.  The bread was very good, jut like my mom used to make it.  I substituted 2/3 cup white sugar for the brown sugar.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top before baking.

GREAT!
This is my first no-doubt and no-fail bread recipe. I reduce whole into half and add raisin and currants in electric mixer after the dough was almost done. 
My husband loves crusty bread and very fuzzy with soft bread but this was so great he couldn't resist.
Great taste naturally, healthy, light, moist and stay fresh and soft  even a few days overnight and in the fridge. I LOVE THIS RECIPE.  NEW BAKER, THIS IS A MUST-TRY!

I gave this four stars, although I didn't like it one bit, but that's because I think I was the one who messed things up: I had bought whole wheat flour just for this recipe and I was planning on only using whole wheat, as several users recommended, but as I was scooping it in I thought it looked too hearty, so I changed plans and used some all-purpose flour (about half and half). I have since come to find out that this was NOT the kind of flour to add. There is a reason why they make "bread" flour. My loaf was heavy, bland and I don't think I will be making this again. But it's not because the recipe isn't a good one--I'm just not happy with my mistake and I'm not happy with the wheat flour I bought. Best of luck to you, though!

I agree with all the many previous rave reviews.  This bread is pretty easy to make, has an incredible flavor, and makes absolutely the best toast I've ever tasted.  I'm toasting some now!  I think I'll try it next time with honey or more brown sugar, and with more wheat flour.  Amazing!

What a great bread! I actually hand-kneaded it, and found it a relatively easy dough to work. The end product is a gorgeous rustic-looking loaf that tastes fantastic. I scaled it back to 24 servings and used some loaves for a get-together. My boyfriend and I feasted on the rest of the loaves, along with berries, cheese and wine for a filling and satisfying dinner when we were both too tired to cook during the week. It really is quite fabulous, I recommend it 100%.

Oh soooo light. When toasted, the delicate center is contrasted with the wonderfully crunchy carmelized crusts.
Best toast I've ever had!

Fabulous is right!  I made this in a rush and accidentally used white sugar instead of brown, and I intentionally substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.  Still, fabulous and sooo easy to make!

This recipe was WONDERFUL! My family loved it. Next time I may try adding more wheat flour for nutritional value (although it's perfect the way it is). It was so moist and the flavor was irresistible...

Delicious!  I cut the recipe to 24 servings, and it made one large loaf.  I used more whole wheat flour than white flour as well, and it turned out wonderfully!  It's moist and soft with a wonderful flavor.  This is a heavy, filling bread.  I brushed the top of the loaves with water because I like a crisp crust.  This was perfect!  I highly recommend it.  Thank you for a great recipe!

YUMMY!  This was so easy and "fast" compared to the starter breads that I usually make.  Even my picky DS loved it.  I even "Flubbed" by putting in white sugar instead of brown sugar and it still was great!  Thanx!!

This recipe is a winner. I reduced the recipe to only make two loaves because I wanted to try it first before going "all out" and doing the six loaves that the recipe calls for. This is the first time that I've ever baked bread. It turned out great and it was soooo yummy!

Good recipe. The wheat and oatmeal go together well for a nice flavor and chewy texture. Would have liked a sweeter crust though.
I agree with previous posters that the recipe makes too much and cutting it down in half can be a pain in measuring the proper amount of yeast,etc. so it's the recipe's only downfall.
If you like bread with character, give this a try.
