This recipe is very similar to the one my Italian Grandmother taught me to make. Here's what she would do: (1) used a large Dutch Oven (the "spaghetti pot") rather than a skillet; (2) always used Olive Oil as her "vegetable oil"; (3) dipped the chicken pieces in egg prior to dredging them in flour; (4) used parsley and/or basil rather than oregano; (5) never used mushrooms; (6)pierced the onion and put it in whole (and then discarded it before serving the stew); (7) sliced the green peppers in strips rather than chopping them; (8) used red wine rather than white; (9) added carrots and potatoes (which she had cleaned, peeled, quartered and par-cooked) to the pot half-way through the cooking time (which was more like 45 minutes than 30). We used to eat this right from the pot when we were kids it was so delicious. I tend to remove the pieces from the pot first to a serving dish or salad bowl, let them sit for a while (perhaps 10 minutes), and then remove them, the vegetables and as much of the "sauce" as I want to yet another serving dish (less greasy that way). My family loves this dish, and prepared this way, there's no need to serve it "over" or "alongside of" anything.

Fabulous!  I did change a few things.  3 cloves garlic.  A can of Italian stewed tomatoes in addition to the diced tomatoes.  1 cup red wine instead of 1/2 cup white.  The extra ingredients worked well to cover the chicken while cooking.  The chicken turned out SO tender!  It was falling off the bone.  I really didn't think a half hour would actually cook it.  It really needed salt to bring out the flavor, though.  I recommend 1 tsp. salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.  Next time I would only use 1 cup flour for a lighter coating.

Don't understand why anyone would call this recipe boring. Yes, I too added more seasonings and totally skipped the flour coating as it's not necessary and actually gets in the way during the browning process. The key to a really good cacciatore is to brown the chicken very, very well. The oil is also not needed as the chicken will produce its own. Once browned, you're left with those wonderful tasty bits on the bottom of your pan that helps to make an incredible and almost brown colored hearty sauce. I also suggest letting the chicken and sauce simmer for a couple of hours to really bring out the flavors. If you have a cast iron skillet or dutch oven, all the better. Good basic recipe Jana and thanks so much!!!!

Terriffic recipe!!!  Easy too.  Omitted the flour based on other reviews and used Italian seasoning instead of just oregano cause I didn't have any on hand.  Used two cans of diced tomatoes for more sauce and added green onions along with regular one.  I like my sauces THICK, so I added 3 small cans of tomato paste.  If you don't, use at least one or the sauce will be tasty but runny.  The longer you cook on a low simmer, the more the meat will fall off the bone.  Remember to occasionally stir for all cook times, long or short.  Oh yeah, if you're able, brown chicken in just about ANYTHING but vegetable oil (olive, canola, Country Crock spread.....all are a little healthier).  Thanx for the recipe, yo!!  I swear I love this site!!

This recipe was fantastic. Made it as written and I very much enjoyed it. Thank you so much for sharing!
On a side note, I SO don't understand some of these reviews. The ones saying, I changed this and that and added these things and used a completely different cooking method so with my alterations its 5 stars. WHAT???!!! If you're doing it differently that is totally fine, but how dare you change the recipe so much and then rate it whether it be a good or bad rating. I'm utterly baffled! When I change a recipe I will not rate it because it is no longer the posted recipe! *Sorry for venting*

This is a great recipe.  As usual, I read the reviews (thanks) and took a few suggestions.  I used 8 boneless breasts (always my preference), verly lightly floured them (less than 1/2 cup of flour), and I used a touch of olive oil for browning.  I doubled the peppers and onions, but cut them into 1-inch pieces.  I used a cup of red wine, twice the garlic, and a small can of tomato sauce at the end when I thought it was a little too liquidy.  I love this.  It's lowfat, very tasty and even easier to make.  Thanks!

This was really fantastic! The only change I made was that I used skinless chicken breasts and a cabernet instead of white wine. This will most likely end up on my weekly rotation!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

GREAT!  I have to say this, if you are changing more then two main ingredients, or techniques in a recipe, Just write your own recipe and post it and let us all review your recipe. I wants reviews on the recipe I see there in print, not huge modifications - its no longer "that recipe".  There is a huge list of Chicken cacciatore recipes, get one closer to what you want to make. This was great as posted, thanks to the original poster.

I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts (8 of them) along with a few drumsticks. I mixed 30 oz of Italian style diced tomatoes, 1 sm can of tomato sauce, 1 c of chicken broth, 1 c of wine, mushrooms, onion, green peppers, fresh parsley, oregano, basil, garlic and poured on top of chicken and put everything in the crockpot. Since I was pressed for time, I cooked on high for 2 hours & low for an add'l 2 hours. I did coat with flour & brown each piece of chicken first. Served on top of angel hair pasta. Very good! Would definitely make again!

Made a huge batch of this for a big family gathering...everyone loved it. Made a few changes, based on other reviews. Used red wine instead of white and a ton of garlic. Finished the dish off in a slow cooker which worked great. Definitely don't skip the step of coating the chicken with flour...makes a big difference in the sauce.

THIS IS A GOOD STANDARD CHICKEN CAICCIATORE. I CUT MY CHICKEN BREASTS UP INTO BITE SIZE PIECES, COVERED WITH FLOUR, BROWNED IN SOME OLIVE OIL, REMOVED FROM PAN AND THEN COOKED THE PEPPERS AND MUSHROOMS NO ONIONS (HUBBIE DOENS'T LIKE THEM) :( WHEN THOSE WERE COOKED ADDED BACK THE CHICKEN AND A CAN OF HUNTS TOMATO SAUCE AND A COUPLE OF GOOD DASHES OF ITALIAN SEASONING. SIMMERED FOR ABOUT 1/2 HOUR. YUMMIE. SERVED WITH ZITI. HUBBIE SAID IT WAS "AWESOME" THANKS FOR THE POST.

This was a beautiful recipe, for which I don't feel any tweaks or changes are needed.  Having said that, I was out of white wine, so I used apple juice, and it worked just fine.

This is by FAR the best Chicken Cacciatore I have had. Better than restaurant Chicken Cacciatore. I used boneless breast and added a tiny pinch of red pepper flakes. Don't skip the flouring of the chicken, it helps keep the chicken remain juicy and thicken the sauce.

I gave this 4 stars only with my modifications, many of which came from other comments. First, I can't imagine how someone could make this dish with only 1 (14.5 oz) can of diced tomatoes. I used 1 (28 oz) can. To thicken, I used a whole 6 oz can of paste but you really only need 1/2 of that (3 oz). Double the garlic (at a minimum) and use 3 whole chicken breasts (purchased as 6 halves) cut into 1" strips. You only need 1 cup (or less) of flour for coating. Use olive oil instead of vegetable oil. Also add extra oregano and some dried basil. way too bland otherwise. Finally, I cooked on medium for 30 minutes and then simmered for 90 minutes. The meat was incredibly soft. With these changes, it's an excellent, 4 star meal and easy to make (I served over rigattoni).

I made this for my boyfriend last night.  He and I thought it was wonderful!  I did exactly as the recipe said, but I added a little more garlic because we both love it so much.  I served it on a bed of angel hair pasta.  It has a great flavor to it.  I can't wait to make it for company. :-)

I tried this recipe one before, as-is, and my husband wasn't crazy about it...so this time I 'doctored' a bit to suit his/our taste.  I prepared the chicken, using thighs, and added paprika to the coating...got them sauteed in a large stock pot and removed when finished.  Then I cooked the onion, garlic (which I doubled), bell peppers (half a green, and a full red and orange) in the leftover oil and fat from the chicken.  I liberally salted and added cracked pepper as well as plenty of paprika (this is how I would start my pasta sauces normally), cooked those until 'saucy', and then I added a the can of tomatoes, drained a bit, as well as only 1/4 C. white wine and 1/4 tsp. or oregano (mine was ground so I cut the amount in half).  I allowed that to simmer for about ten minutes and then added a jar of Bertolli Organic Garlic and Basic pasta sauce to speed up the process (normally I would cook down my own fresh tomatoes).  Once everything started to come together and flavors were well blended I added the chicken thighs, covered, and allowed to similar on a low to med. low setting for the next hour.  The last few minutes of cooking I added fresh chopped Italian parsley and served over spaghetti noodles.  My husband really enjoyed it after I made the changes, and the chicken fell right off the bone!  I would have given five stars with changes, but since I did add quit a few extra touches I figured it wouldn't be fair to rate the original recipe this way.   A great base recipe!!

Although I really didn't follow this recipe, I did want to comment about flouring the chicken... doing so helps to thicken the sauce a little, and I prefer to deglaze the pan with wine, getting up all those delicious chicken bits.  Also, I used white wine and thought it was delicious (I prefer red wine in red sauce, but in my "research" found that white wine was more traditional for cacciatore).  I replaced carrots for peppers, and added 4 cloves of garlic.  I'm rating this four stars because in order to get a rich sauce, you really need to let it simmer for atleast an hour.  Enjoy!

Made this tonight, and it was amazing. Increase the garlic by 2. I also browned the chicken and put everything into a dutch oven and bake it at 375 for about 1.25 hours.

I just tried this recipe with a few minor alterations. Instead of breading and frying in regular cooking oil, I opted to saute the chicken in a small amount of olive oil with the garlic and onion, then added the cooking wine. I also used fresh herbs. Though sauteing may take away some of the authenticity, it still tasted amazing, with just the right infusion of flavors. I served it over angel hair pasta tossed in a little bit of olive oil and minced garlic with 1/2 tsp basil, 1/2 tsp. oregano, and 1 tsp parsley for light flavor and presentation.

I insist on using fresh vegetables (fresh tomatoes, in season) and herbs when available, as their flavor can't be compared to that of dried or canned. Overall, I'd recommend this recipe to anyone.

I only made a few changes.  Used a pound of boneless chicken breast, pounded thin and then sliced, and only needed about 1/2 cup of flour.  Doubled green pepper, onion and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes.  The rest was pretty much like the reciped called for.  Served over pasta with a sprinkle of parm cheese.  It was delicous.  Light and healthy tasting.  The only thing I would do differently next time is season the chicken a bit more. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this at the hospice where I volunteer and it is wonderful! Made just as written using boneless skinless chicken thighs and it turned out just perfect. Real comfort food and still nutritionally sound. Try this recipe!

This was a huge hit with my family.  I only made a few changes: used red wine, added chopped carrots, more garlic and did not flour chicken legs and thighs (used cornstarch to thicken sauce since hubby needs to eat gluten-free).  Served it with Cheesy Polenta from this site.  Made enough leftovers, so, for second meal I added browned Italian sausage slices and I cooked angel hair pasta for something different.  Delizioso!

Excellent, I went heavy on the garlic and seasonings and this was great! The chicken is juicy and tender, the sauce that was created was so flavorful and there was plenty to serve over pasta. We really liked this one Jana, thanks!

This is good, but I made a few changes.  I didn't bother to flour the chicken, also left out the mushrooms and wine as I didn't have any.  Finally, I didn't think the sauce had enough flavor so I started dumping in spices until I thought it was right.  I will continue to make just because it is one of those dishes I usually have the ingredients on hand.

I grew up near "The Hill" in St. Louis. This recipe is very near the cacciatore that I used to eat at my Italian friends houses. My family loves this.  To reduce fat, drain chicken on paper towels after you brown it.  You can also fix this without flouring the chicken.  Delicious!

This was really good. I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, dusted with flour and Seasoned Salt, and sauteed them in olive oil. I also added a red bell pepper to the vegetable assortment, and used baby bella mushrooms (sliced). I substituted red wine for white, and added half a jar of Bertolli organic Olive Oil, Basil, and Garlic sauce. Served over whole wheat penne pasta, very good.

I didn't dredge the chicken in flour. I also omitted mushrooms and wine. I didn't have them. This was just the base I needed to make a wonderful meal. I served it with a crusty roll to sop up the juice. Yummmmmy. I will use this recipe again.

I've made this recipe a few times - sometimes substituting red wine for white (I always use fresh oregano and red pepper as we don't like the taste of green) and it's always excellent.  This is my favorite cacciatore recipe!

This is a great recipe, but with a few modifications. Firstly, do NOT skip the flouring process, it really does give the chicken pieces a nice golden brown appearance. And I'd recommend olive oil over vegetable oil, for obvious reasons. I left out the green peppers but added a small can of sliced black olives. For full flavor and the most tender chicken, cook in a covered casserole dish in the oven at a medium heat for about an hour. Serve over white rice with steamed broccolini on the side.

Not too shabby! I'll add my two cents...the other reviewers are right, the secret (in most other recipies too) is in the browning. Dredging the chicken in seasoned flour and browning well really enhances the taste and helps to thicken the sauce later. I added some chili pepper and rosemary to fry with the onions for our liking and threw in a zuccini I had hanging around. Also, try a can of crushed tomatoes next time. It gives it more of a saucy consistency like you cooked it for hours. Enjoy AllRecipers!

This dish gets a 5 star rating: 4 for the recipe and 1 for all the great suggestions Here’s what I did:

Added carrots: 3 and cut to about 1”  “sticks”, placed in small bowl, added water to cover cooked in microwave for 9 mins. 
Egg washed the chicken: I beat 2 large eggs with a tblspn of water and covered chicken pieces.
Chicken: Used chicken with bone – more tastier than just meat. Removed skin and fat, but had to add more olive oil.
Doubled all the seasonings: I used half with the flour and added the other half at simmering time! – delish!
Added and replaced some seasonings:  (1) Replaced salt with garlic salt. (2) Added Ms. Dash seasoning (did not have Italian Seasonings) (3) Added 1  teaspoon brown sugar – kills tomato acidity! (4) Did not have diced or  Italian stewed tomatoes or tomato paste. I used 1 large can (28oz) Crushed Tomatoes with Basil only – nice and thick and flavorful sauce that my wife always buys.
Deleted some veggies: no green peppers or mushrooms -- my kids don’t like them, yet.
Frying:  Golden brown fried the lightly, well coated chicken pieces in very low heat.
Wine: Added red wine to hot skillet (no heat) and scraped bits of chicken – this also reduced the wine!
Simmering:  Added and gently mixed all the ingredients, including the other half of the seasonings, sugar and carrots. Simmered covered for 45 minutes over low heat.

This came out wonderfully tasty! 
My only 2 cents is: make double – as your family and guests will want seconds.

This is a fabulous recipe to make for a large group of people.  The flour from the coated chicken thickens up the sauce which is packed with chopped up peppers, mushrooms and onions.  Delicious!

I pretty much followed the recipe except I used skinned thighs (with bones). Cut up the peppers and onion very chunky. Used a large can of crushed tomatoes. No oregano as I don't like it and used french seasoning, and fresh basil. Also I used a large can of mushrooms. Sometimes you have to use what you have.Cooked it long and slow in a heavy dutch oven on top of the stove on a very very low flame.
Wonderful.  It will be even better tomorrow night.
I didn't add ANY salt and didn't miss it at all.

In my opinion, this is a very good basic recipe.  However, the sauce did need a bit of tweaking once it was made according to the recipe.  First of all I did double the sauce recipe, adding additional minced garlic.  Also the oregano was adjusted according to taste, with the addition of basil and parsley, and a robust red wine substituting for the white.  I cut the mushrooms back to 1 cup of fresh, sliced and sauteed, resulting in a fantastic cacciatore sauce.

Although the traditional recipe calls for dark meat chicken, I too only used breasts. To make this heart-friendly for my bf's dad who needs to watch his sodium I used low-sodium canned plum tomatoes and didn't salt the pot until I served my own plate. I wanted to use red wine instead of white but white was all I had, and it was fine. Added more flour to thicken up the sauce, as I like it chunky and hearty. Added capers and served over brown rice. Was great!!

4 stars since it needed some changes, but with the changes, I might give it 5. The sauce was very thin, so I added a 6 oz can of tomato, 8 oz of tomato sauce, and a little bit more wine. From the advice of other reviewers, I used red wine instead of white. I garnished this with fresh chopped parsley.

Yum!  Only thing I did differently is I took the skin off of the chicken prior to cooking - I'm sure lots of y'all did this but I thought I would mention it.  Also - I had l/2 of white wine in the fridge - used it - but then decided I wanted a bit more wine to make the sauce go further.  All I had opened was a bottle of shiraz - so I threw in about a cup more.  I probably broke a 'cardinal sin' by mixing up my wines, but it sure tasted good.  I also added about a half a can of tomato paste.  I served this over spaghetti.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I added a lot of garlic seasoning to the flour before frying the chicken.  I used leg quarters (it's what I had on hand).  After making the sauce, it tasted bland so I added a lot of seasoned salt, fresh pepper, and garlic seasoning.  It turned out really good.  I recommend tasting it before taking it to the table and adding as much seasoning as you would like or, as other reviewers commented, it may turn out to be too bland for your liking.  I will definitely make this again!

This was DELISH! I, like some others, used 1 cup red wine, 2 cans of chopped tomatoes and 1 tsp red pepper flakes and a bay leaf.  Also, I sauteed 5 strips of bacon and fried the chicken in the bacon fat.  Then, when it was time to add the tomatoes, etc, I added the chopped, cooked bacon along with some capers (1 TBS) and black olives, about 10 (halved).
What a great flavor the bacon adds.  Just like my Italian grandma would have made.  Jana, sorry for tweeking the recipe so much but its in my nature!  I hope I can duplicate this next time!
This is a keeper.

This was delicious. I totally disagree with the comment about skipping the flour - that's what I loved about it! I used skinless chicken breasts, which worked well - though thinner slices might have been a better idea. I added some olives, which gave it a more mediterranean taste. Overall, delicious!

Wonderful; my first time making cacciatore! A few modifications, based on what I had on hand...chicken broth in place of white wine. Rotel diced tomatoes with green chilies. Added some chopped fresh mushrooms. Served over spaghetti. Delightful!

This is a delicious and very forgiving recipe, as I have used chicken breasts (sliced in half lenghtwise)or chicken tenders.  I have also used Marsala Wine or Red Vermouth and the recipe always turned out great.  I only use olive oil and have never  added mushrooms or green pepper but still wonderful.  Before serving I mix 1/2 C fresh chopped parsley with 2 cloves of crushed garlic and 1 tsp. lemon zest and stir it into the sauce.

I took the advice of others and did not flour the chicken. I did season and browned it, then diced the chicken while the onions mixture was cooking. I made it into a chicken cacciatore sauce, put it over penne pasta and it was amazing. Will definitely make it again.

This was delicious and came out exactly as it's written.  I used boneless Chicken Thighs and was so impressed.   Family loved it and I would say this is a pretty easy, but totally satisfying recipe!  THANKYOU

I give this 4 stars!  We tried it over Linguini noodles and over Steemed Basmati Rice.  Both ways were a hit!

I didn't use the flour nor the did I put any mushrooms nor peppers, as I was out. I used oregano and basil and I used stock instead of wine. I also used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I deglazed the pan with stock as well, before letting it simmer for an hour or so. The sauce turned out a little bland (probably because I omitted and changed so many things) but my chicken breasts were very tender and juicy. I pan fried the breasts for 8 minutes each side on medium-high. Next time, I will add the peppers and mushrooms as that will likely give it more flavour.

I added some sweet italian sausage to this dish. It was not MY favorite dish but it gets 5 stars due to the fact that my extremely picky 5 and 6 year old boys loved it! They even insisted on having the left overs for breakfast the next day. ???? Kids and food?? I cant figure it out! :-)

Easy.  Used boneless skinless chicken thighs.  Browned chicken, sauteed onions and peppers, then tomatoes, mushrooms and everything else separate and added an extra clove of garlic.  Then rested the chicken on the sauteed onions and peppers.  Topped the chicken with the mushrooms and tomatoes, and poured one can of tomato sauce on top, baked for 3o min at 350F topped with mozzarella, broiled and served.

The ONLY reason that I am giving this recipe four stars is because I know what good chix cacciatore is supposed to taste like and I was able to make this recipe into a good tasting chix caccitore that me and my family good actually eat.  I don't know what this recipe would have turned out like if I didn't.  Like some other reviewers I too used 3 cloves of garlic and red wine.  In addition, I used two 14.5 oz cans of diced tomatoes.  I also added a can of tomatoe paste, because even with those two cans of crushed tomatoes the tomatoe taste was not there.  I had to add tons of seasoning, like seasoning salt and garlic seasoning salt.  If you new to cooking, try another recipe because you will be disapointed.  If you are some one who has been cooking for a while this is a good base recipe to get you started on making chicken caccitore.  Good luck!!

My mom was Italian and made this all the time. She never floured her chicken or used breasts (as they are always dry and stringy). I have made this using onions, peppers, tomatoes, tomato sauce, parsley, basil, salt and pepper,(never oregano) like my mother did. I also have tried adding red wine, carrots and mushrooms. I like it both ways. Mama used to serve it over rice and we prefer pasta. As always on this site, I double the sauce, as there never seems to be enough for me.

This is a similar recipe I've used for 50 years  I too do not dredge the chicken, not necessary.  Along with the suggested ingredients I have added chopped black olives, thin sliced pepperoni, and spicy Italian sausage with the chicken for added heat. I use a good Italian seasoning already put together as it seems to have the perfect balance.  I never use wine in the sauce, prefer it on the table. Be sure to brown the meat in olive oil not vegetable oil for wonderful flavor.  Also I add a little parmesan freshly grated to the sauce while cooking to incorporate the flavors, plus have it on the table to add when serving. If the sauce is a little too sharp, add a sprinkle of sugar to mellow it. Careful not to use much, you don't want it sweet. This is a recipe you can be creative with.

In a separate pan, browned one nion, one whole garlic head, minced and chopped green bell pepper. Can on diced tomato, two fresh roma tomatos (chopped) three - four good shakes of Italian seasoning and a half bottle of red wine (Cab). Simmered for 50 minutes and added mushrooms for last ten. Ate it over penne pasta. YUMMM!

I used no flour; breaded the chicken lightly with fine bread crumbs. Also; I did not use the wine, but added some 2 TB balsamic vinegar and a little water instead. Mine was a little sweet, but still very good. Next time I will try the wine.

I used 4 chicken breasts, and followed the recipe. Mine was coming out much dryier than I wanted. I added more wine, and a can of tomatoe sauce. We had unexpected company for supper. To hear them I am one of the best cooks in the world (free meals do that). All said and done I was proud of the meal.
Thanks Jana for sharing.

Very good.  Read the reviews and added red instead of white wine a long with a little spicy peppers, fresh veggies and fresh basil and parsley.  Man, it sure was delicious.  It's on the permanent list.  I didn't use flour and I used chicken breasts instead, too.  Along with olive oil, as always.

Had to change it up a bit as I am doing a "low carb SB thing" right now.
No flour, 2 cans of diced tomatoes, 3 large boneless skinless chicken breast, fresh flat leaf parsley to add to the herbs. I had mine as is and my hubby had his with Dream Field pasta and said that it was excellent..
The flavors blended very well and the added fresh herb made a difference which was a positive.

i'd say 4.5 stars if i could - 5 for ease of preparation, and about 4 for taste - my mom LOVED it and my dh and i definitely enjoyed it.  i did add a pinch of cayenne pepper to my flour with the salt and pepper.  i used thin cut chicken breasts, olive instead of vegetable oil, and chicken stock instead of wine since i didn't have any white on hand.  i also has a small handful of baby bella mushrooms that i used.  it came together very easily and was super tasty.  this will be added to my kitchen rotation!

What an awesome recipe. I did however make a couple of changes due to the fact that I'm not a fan of white wine. I used boneless skinless chicken breasts cut into small pieces, and I also used half the flour. I used 1 cup of red wine instead of the white, and added a can of tomato sauce. It was awesome to say the least on top of some pasta. Pretty much any kind works.

I love garlic so I added a bunch more, probably 6-7 cloves. I also added more mushrooms. 1 cup of flour was more than enough for the coating. Because we love sauce, I doubled the amount of tomatoes and I used the ones with basil,garlic and oregano. I did as Linda McLean suggested and simmered it for about 1 1/2 - 2 hours. It came out really good. The chicken was very tender and flavorful and the sauce was chunky and delicious. I did thicken it up with a bit of diluted cornstarch. I took some of the liquid out (about 4 Tablespoons) and diluted about 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in that liquid. Then I added it to the dish and in a couple of minutes the sauce thickened and it was perfect.

Mmm! Tasty! I had to make do with what I had so I couldn't follow this exactly; only 4 chicken thighs, no mushrooms, red wine. I made some other modifications for fun; I think this is a good base recipe for cacciatore. My chicken was dipped in egg then coated in flour seasoned with a few dashes of thyme, rosemary, paprika, poultry seasoning, salt and pepper. I added chopped celery and carrot with tomatoes, which were fresh, not canned. It was too thick so I added 1 can crushed tomatoes. I also added 1 sliced zucchini squash halfway through cooking. All in all it was good, and smelled great. There was something lacking in the overall flavor and I'm not sure what...the soup base needs more oomph.

Great base recipe! With some minor adjustments, this was absolutely delicious.  Besides the can of diced tomatoes, I added a large can of crushed with Italian seasonings.  I used cut up chicken breasts, and gave them an egg wash before flouring them.  I also added garlic powder to the flour.  I added italian seasoning to the sauce, doubled the garlic and threw in 2 sliced carrots. I served it over angel hair pasta and my hubby went crazy over it.  Thanks so much for the recipe Jana!

I made this recipe for the first time tonight and I thought it was awesome!  I substituted stewed tomatoes (italian style)and added chicken broth instead of white wine because I didn't have any.  I also used yellow summer squash in place of the green pepper becuase it was what I had on hand.  I think the italian style tomatoes must have added the seasoning that others have commented that this recipe lacked because it turned out yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe needed some adjustments.  I used fresh basil and gave the chicken an egg & water wash prior to flouring. I also added 1.5 teaspoon of garlic salt in the flour and used 1 small can of diced tomatoes and 1 small can of crushed tomatoes for the sauce.  Also, doubling the garlic resulted in a delicious dinner!

This was wonderful! I have never made cacciatore, but it very close to what my Grandma used to make. I did add some tomato sauce near the end to make more sauce for the pasta, used skinless, boneless breasts, and cooked it on low for 1 1/2 hours. Delicious!

Quite good.  I substituted port wine for the white wine, left out the green pepper, doubled the tomatoes, and added some extra dried basil.  It's a good cacciatore.  4 stars without my additions, 5 stars with them.

This recipe was a very good starting point, but it needed A LOT of work.

I used fresh diced plum tomatoes. (equivalent of 2 cans)  I doubled the garlic.  I added fresh basil, italian seasoning, and lots of garlic salt. I also used red wine and some chicken stock.  I thickened up the sauce with a can of tomato paste.  Next time I will add some garlic salt to the flour also.  TFS.

Fantastic!  I cut the recipe in 1/2, as my 2 older children wanted grilled cheese, and I ended up (as it was cooking) adding a .....yes, I hate to admit, a JAR of ragu.  I added it because I needed some extra sauce for another recipe.  The sauce ended up turning out awesome (chicken really does the trick in this gravy).  Great meal Jana, we loved it, thanks!

This turned out pretty good. I would reccomend doubling the "sauce" and adding more salt. You could also cut back on theflour some by 1/3, I ended up having way more than needed.. A little more garlic and/or oregano would be fine too.

I've made this several times using boneless skinless chicken breasts because that is what I prefer, and I always use extra veggies.  Love it!  I'm not a big pasta fan, so I serve this with a cheese and spinach stromboli.

I gave this 4 stars for I had followed other suggestions. I love the recipe, but, I needed a better 4 heart recipe. I used chx breasts, fake egg washed and flour, no salt stewed toms, and a lg. can of crushed toms from Target, a lot of their stuff has less salt, surprized, I was. I added 3 cloves garlic, 3 tb. fresh basil, 3 tb. fresh parsley, 2 tb. dry oregano, 1/3 c no salt ketchup ( I know) but it needs sweets dude. 2 green bells thinly sliced. 1 sweet onion cut into 4, 2 lb. mushrooms cut into 1/4 as suggested, additional italian seasoning...1/4 c with no salt. I found this one at the dollar store haha. Go figure. I used 3 chx breasts skinned deboned, 4 got to mention, and I browned the chx in evoo, then placed into crock pot with all the rest. Forgetting to get to the store in time to reduce red wine to the half cup mentioned, although I used 3/4 c because it's how it worked. Placed egg noodles underneath el dente before serving. My crock pot took four hours on high. I turned it off before starting the noodles and placed ladels in the serving bowls, for my fam" was hungry.. lol. Just to let it cool enough. Ate by 5:30.... haha

I've made this 3 times and we love it! I haven't had mushrooms the last two times and it was fine. I also used red bell pepper instead of a green pepper, (personal preference). My husband makes a great cacciatore but he likes this just as well. Plus it's pretty easy and fast to make. I usually have all the ingredients on hand (except the bell pepper) so that makes it really convenient too. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This is a great recipe, loved it. I did tweak it and add some cajun seasoning to give it a little kick and my family likes it a little sausier so I add 2 cans of tomato paste and water which made this perfect, even my picky 2 year old ate it!

I have made this recipe quite a few times now.  I use boneless skinless chicken breast cut into bite size pieces.  I coat the chicken with flour and fry it.  I then transfer it to my crockpot and add everything else.  I use juice and a splash of vinegar instead of the white wine.  Cook on high for 3 - 4 hours.  Thanks for the recipe Jana!

I liked this quite a bit, but my family didn't care for it as much.  I thought it was a very good representation of cacciatore and would not hesitate to serve to people who were fans of the dish.

Great recipe! I made this when I was visiting my parents & siblings, and they gobbled it up! There wasn't as much of a sauce like I was expecting, but everyone assured me that it was just as delicious. This is a keeper!

I used boneless chicken...two breasts and 5 thighs.
I used two cans of tomatoes, one whole green pepper, and a half of a red bell peppler.   Added a sprinkle of basil as well.   I served it with quinoa instead of pasta or rice because we're always trying to find ways to add whole grains in.  I also sprinkled some parmesan cheese on top like I would with spaghetti.  I loved it, but one of my kids was kinda skeptical.  Husband said it needed more flavor so next time I will give it a bit more salt (I used less than it called for) and maybe some crushed red pepper for some zing.  All in all, I thought it was way yummy!

This definitely tastes better the next day! I basically followed the recipe but added a few things based on reviews. I used garlic salt when I seasoned the chicken and added some paprika. When making the sauce added a small can of tomato paste. Increased Oregano to 1 tsp and also added 1 tsp of basil leaves and 1 tsp of marjoram. I like my sauce with a little sweetness so I added 1/4 cup sugar. Served with penne pasta. Was really great!

Quick and easy , delicious.  We served it over spaghetti and I thought it was a very good pairing. 
I was out of mushrooms, it would have been more nearly perfect with them.  Well, next time.

What a great recipe.  I used my Gluten free all purpose flour mixture to coat the chicken and also served over rice pasta.  The whole family loved it, thanks for sharing!

Good recipe!  I used red, yellow and orange mini bell peppers instead of the green, and I didn't have any white or red wine in the pantry, so I used 1/4 cup Worcestshire sauce instead.  It gave the dish a nice, spicy kick.  I also used skinless and boneless chicken thighs.  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Very good. I did mix Italian breadcrumbs with my flour to coat the chicken pieces, and browned thoroughly, before the remaining steps. I added rosemary and basil as well. I placed 3 portabello mushroom caps on top before covering and finishing. I also used Chianti instead of white wine, as I like a sweeter sauce.

Was a little disappointed.  I could have done something wrong.  I had to add more oil because it kept cooking down and burning,  I had to add a can of diced and stewed tomatoes because the one was not enough to cover the chicken and 30 minutes was not enough time for the chicken to cook.  It looked horrible when done but I still ate it with spaghetti pasta and it tasted pretty good.  My finicky daughter originally was afraid to eat it but I made her and she asked for seconds.  Like I said, I may have done something wrong.  I will try it again.

I make a similar cacciatore.  I've used boneless, skinless breasts and I've used bone-in breasts and thighs...both work great.  I don't cut up the chicken...if you let it simmer in the sauce it is so tender, you don't need to!  Plus it looks prettier leaving them whole.  Also, just dredge the chicken in heavily seasoned flour.  I use shitake mushrooms as they're SO much more flavorful, more garlic than called for, and would probably agree with throwing in a can of tomato paste or sauce to thicken it up a bit.  Serve it over fettuccine or spaghetti...YUM!!

Very good recipe.   I used suggestions from others.   Plus one or two of my own ideas. I used olive oil.  I did not use any coating to brown the chicken.  The best move I made was using Cento San Marzano D.O.P. Certified Italian Peeled Tomatoes 28 oz.  added a 2 tablespoons of tom. paste.   One cup of red wine, 6 cloves of garlic lots of oregano and some basil.  The trick with the garlic and other spices is to add them  near the end .   I simmered for a long time. The sauce was nice and thick , chicken was falling of the bone.   Oh yea I added cilantro when I served it.  It was great!  Next time I will do half the  chicken skinless.

yummy yummy  i used to work at this italian restraunt and this is close to their recipe, theirs was just way spicy. if you wanna heat things up just add crushed red pepper flake when you simmer your sauce. also i like to pair this with 'percateli' noodles. they are like a straw and suck up all the sauce!

This is an excellent recipe. As we don't drink wine, I substituted a 15 oz can of chicken broth. I left out the peppers because I don't like them, and used fresh herbs from my garden. I ended up cooking spaghetti right in the same skillet. ManassasMa is out of her mind with a review like that. That wasn't a review, that was a whole other recipe.

I've been looking for a recipe like my grandmothers and this seemed to fit the bill. I did change a few things, however. I used boneless, skinless chicken breast, olive oil instead of vegetable oil and added a can of tomato paste as others suggested and it turned out great. Thanks for sharing!

Very yummy!!!  My husband and I love this recipe!! I made it according to the directions at first,, then the second time I pulled the meat from a rotisserie chicken and after I cooked the veggies,, I dusted them with flour,, let that cook a minute and then went on as the recipe called for again.. We like it over angel hair pasta.

This recipe is so boring. I fixed this recipe because I loved the chicken breast pierre which is made in a similar way by browning the chicken and adding a stewed tomato mixture. Plus I love to cook with wine.  I added a red wine to beef up the flavor a bit - it didn't help.  Several people said the chicken breast pierre was too spicy - they might like this.  All of you who think this is too bland try the chicken breast pierre.
I gave it a 3 stars because it wasn't a total flop but kids didn't finish.  In their words "The chicken was okay but it was kind of boring"

I tried this recipe tonight after making several of the alterations suggested in other reviews. (red wine, more tomatoes more garlic and some basil, celery and olives) Everyone loved it and it has definitely won a spot in our starting  lineup.

I enjoyed this simple recipe very much.  I didn't give in to the temptation of changing it on the first throw and was very pleased.  I would add more salt to the flour next time.  Otherwise, don't mess with it.

This was very unique, not at all what I expected. I made the switch to red wine and added more garlic; the sauce came out much more like a gravy, not a tomato-ey red sauce. The chicken fell off the bones, and the mushrooms were delicious. Everything smelled fantastic as it cooked. I spooned it over those thick "bucatini" spaghetti noodles, and served it with the chicken to my boyfriend; the sauce with mushrooms only was fine for me. Thumbs up, Jana, and thank you!

This recipe is excellent!  I make it all the time now.  Of course, everyone likes white meat so I use chicken breasts, instead of a whole chicken.  It comes out just as good and the chicken is so tender you can cut it with a fork.  The only thing I do is add a little fresh basil for personal taste but, otherwise, it's great the way it is.

This was amazing! We used rabbit in place of the chicken and the kids didn't know the difference. Added a few extra spices as well.

Excellent as written.  Just a couple of small "tweaks" based on our personal tastes - used Italian seasoning rather than oregano & some tomato paste at the end to thicken the sauce. Might add red pepper flakes next time (as mentioned in another review) to spice it up a bit.

I used about 2 lbs chicken breast halves. I didn't use any flour. Instead of vegetable oil I used olive oil. Added an extra tsp of minced garlic as well as a tbs of tomato paste. Very good. Thanks for the recipe!

First time making cacciatore and I am wondering what I was waiting for!  Absolutely delicious.  I made basic changes to suit our likes, but did not change the bones of the recipe.  Used chicken breasts (about 3 pounds), a 28 oz can of petite diced tomatoes, no mushrooms (so I used an extra pepper - will use 3 next time), olive oil for browning, red wine instead of white and added a few shakes of crushed red pepper.  My fiance and I raved about how good this was.  Looking forward to leftovers for dinner tonight!

Unbelieveably great! My family just devoured this meal. Honestly this meal says its for 8, this fed 5 adults with absolutely no leftovers! I followed the recipe almost to the tee,just tweeked it alittle. Instead of 14oz can of diced tomatoes I used 28oz can( knew I would need more sauce)we used all fresh herbs from our garden and added about 2tbs. of fresh basil with the oregano. We double the peppers and onions and garlic,using 2 peppers,2 onions and 4 garlic cloves ( we love garlic).Used spagetti and fresh baked local italian bread. Other than that we followed the recipe and no leftovers as I said! Thank you, it was a great Saturday night dinner.

Hubby loved it! I added double the spices & garlic plus 1/2 tsp of paprika for the chicken les & thighs, which I pulled the skin off of, 1/2 cup dry red wine, & a small can of tomato paste. It was rich & delicious! We didn't use rice or noodles & now one of his favorites. We threw shredded Parmesan on top and Oh So Good!

Wonderful! I added fresh basil and zesty Italian seasonings instead, and a can of tomato soup.
I also cooked it in the crockpot after browning the chicken. I have made this 3 times now, the first time according to the recipe and made my changes this time. I also didn't use flour to brown the chicken, and seasoned the chicken before browning. : )

I thought this was good but nothing special.  A tomato based chicken stew. I was hoping for more flavor and complexity. It was definitely heart.  Served on rigatoni.

This was very, very good.  Everyone gave it rave reviews. The only thing I did different was using chicken breast because that is what I had on hand, but I think the addition of dark meat as in the original will make it even better.

Followed the recipe mostly to the tee. Only need one cup of flour though. I used a 4 1/2 lb. chicken and 1 c. was plenty. I added the minced garlic toward the end of sauteing the onions/peppers cause I'm always afraid of burning it.

This was very good.  Thought it needed a little more tomato, so I added an extra can of diced tomatoes.  I also used bone-in chicken thighs instead of the cut up whole chicken, as that's what I had on hand.

Very good recipe.  I added a bit more garlic and used fresh oregano, basil and thyme.  It came out great.  I will make this again.

Oh my, this was great! I used italian seasoning instead of oregano, but for the most part followed the recipe, and it was wonderful. I served it with Angel Hair Pasta, garlic bread, salad and a glass of wine. I will definately use this recipe again.

Sooooooo good! So very good!  I added a little tomato sauce to make more sauce and seasoned to my taste.   i also seasoned the chicken before flouring it.  Just delicious.

The sauce was a nice balance of flavors and everything went well together. My family liked it as well. Served my dish with a side of broccoli. Thanks for the recipe.

The first time I tried this, I used wine vinegar since it was the closest thing I had. That turned out to be excellent. Then I used dry white wine. I never thought it would be better...but it was. I have since made it once a month. It is a definite keeper.

I had to use a big package of bone in chicken thighs and this was perfect for them. I didn't change a thing except to leave out mushrooms so I wouldnt have to hear my husband complaining about having to pick them out. It was fabulous just the way it is written! Everyone had huge servings!

I wanted a recipe that could be made with ingredients I already had.  I came across this recipe but made some alterations that still made a fabulous dish.  I used boneless chicken breast, and dredged with 1/2 cup flour, salt and pepper.  ( even with a whole cut up chicken I think two cups of flour is too much, and slightly wasteful.  I used fresh tomatoes that I blanched, peeled and seeded(my garden produced a bumper crop of tomatoes this year).  Instead of wine, I had none, I used a 1/2 cup of chicken stock. I also used olive oil and butter instead of vegetable oil and three cloves of garlic.  I served it over rotini.  What compliments I got from my little family.  Its easy to cook and like many Italian style meals can be easily modified to suit all tastes.

As others suggested, I used a cup of red instead of half of white wine. I doubled the amount of tomatoes, using one can of whole stewed and one can of crushed. I finely diced a shallot and added that in with the onion in that stage. I find that everything tastes better with sauteed shallots! I used both oregano and basil. I cooked it for at least 45 minutes, on a low bubble in the dutch oven on the stove top. At the end of the cook time, it needed a little zip, so I added more salt and pepper and about a teaspoon and a half of balsamic vinegar.   My best move was going to the butcher instead of the supermarket and having him cut the chicken into pieces for me.  It was my first time using an entire chicken. It felt like a responsible and economical way to go, however we had to be extremely careful about bones--slow cooking a whole chicken, bones end up all over the dish, including tiny, unexpected shards of bone--any bite could've been my last if I hadn't chewed so slowly and carefully!   I served over whole wheat spaghetti the first night and leftovers over whole wheat rotini.   I served five whole dinners.

Absolutely fantastic! Used red wine instead of white and chicken breasts (personal preference). My husband could not stop talking about how good this was! Great as leftovers too - the sauce is even better the next day.

I thought it was a good basic recipe, but like the other reviewers, I added to it. I used a 28 oz. can of diced tomatoes and a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce, plus water. I also added some sliced carrots, a bay leaf and extra garlic and oregano.
In upping the volume this way, I would add an extra bell pepper next time.

Great recipe but tastes better over rice than pasta because rice absorbs the flavor/juice of the somewhat thin sauce. Also stick to a dry white wine like Sherry or Chardonnay if you're going to have it over rice. I used extra salt, pepper, onions, bell pepper,oregano, and EXTRA WINE. I also used garlic salt and roasted garlic olive oil for more flavor.  I don't eat dark meat so I just use chicken breast but keep the bone in-adds more flavor to the broth. And if you want the sauce thicker just take off the lid for the last 10 min so it reduces.

Based on reviews, I skipped the flour the first time I made this and added extra tomotoes - that came out WAY TOO SOUPY! This time, I made it exactly as instructed and it turned out fine. In fact, next time, I may even add tomoto paste! PS: Both times, I added a can of drained black olives b/c that's how my mom-in-law makes her chicken cacciatore - the kids love it!

Ok, maybe its cheating to rate a recipe when you make a lot of changes- but I really just used this recipe as a base.  And it worked out great!  Followed original except: I didn’t coat the chicken in flour, and I cut the chicken into small pieces.  Cooked it in a non-stick skillet so omitted the oil.    Used fresh tomatoes from the garden, added garlic powder, minced onion flakes, and red pepper flakes.  Simmered it till it was pretty thickened and added orzo pasta.  Turned out really yummy.  Thanks Jana!!

This was really very tasty, I subbed red wine for the white wine though, and used boneless skinless chicken breasts instead of whole chicken cut up. Served over thin spaghetti, even my 2 year old wanted bites from her mama's plate! Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this last night and truly enjoyed it and so did my 5 year old.  I follow the receipe pretty close except I ussed about 3 large chicken breast, which I seasoned with Italian spices before dipping in the flour.  I also added chicken broth, to have more sauce.  
This was an instant classic and was immediately saved in my receipe box. Thanks!

This is an absolutely wonderful recipe that has become my favorite.  I do not flour the chicken before and I use fresh tomatoes.  I also use a dry red Bordeaux wine in place of the white wine.  I simmer for at least 30 minutes or more as some others had suggested.  I start it when I get a chance and we eat it whenever we are ready.  The chicken comes out very juicy and tender.  I love it!

I have made this recipe 4 or 5 times now and everyone loves it, I've made it for my husband and for company. I used Baby Bella(Portabello) mushrooms and added extra bell pepper (both red and green) I also added about 1/2 c. of chicken stock to make a little more sauce & because I tend to leave things warming on low a little longer for my Husband to get home from work. Thank you for this great recipe.

This was a wonderful recipe and very like the one my grandmother used to make. I substituted 1/4c burgandy for white wine and only used half the onion & 3/4 bell pepper.  I also used egg noodles.  It was a great hit with the family.

Overall, pretty boring.  I made this for my boyfriend's birthday since cacciatore is his favorite, but we were both pretty disappointed.  I followed this recipe exactly except I used red wine (as many other reviewers suggested).  This dish was just blah.

Tastes almost like my mom's cacciatore! The only difference is that my mom's recipe has no peppers and she adds chunks of bacon (not the skinny breakfast kind, the big, thick slices you buy at the butcher's) while the garlic and onions are being sauteed. You'd be surprised at how much flavor a few chunks of bacon can contribute to this dish!

This was very deceiving! It seems that there is not enough spices in it. Wouod be way better with basil thyme. I'll continue looking for a better recipe.

This is a great recipe to start with and then add your own flare. I added a red bell and extra garlic and omitted the onion. I also used a can of prego instead of tomatoes. The wine and flour are mandatory for good flavor and moist chicken. I also used boneless pre-cut breast pieces. Very Tasty!

Great recipe and SOOO EASY. We do meal sharing with a family from church and it was also my day to cook for another family who lost their mother. i made three batches of this consecutively.  i was chopping while the other was cooking, while I was cooking the chicken.  I knocked them all out in less than 1 1/2 hours.  It tasted GREAT!  Of course when it came to the wine, my cup ranneth over a bit. I used red.

I have never been a big fan of chicken Cacciatore but someone asked me to make it for them and YUM!  This recipe is a keeper.

I was very happy with this recipe.  My changes: more onion, bell pepper, wine & tomatoes (a couple of short bursts in the food processor first) than the recipe called for, then simmered for a few hours to reduce the extra liquid added  - which made the chicken wonderfully tender too. Served it with mashed potatoes the way I have had it in an italian family-style restaurant.

It tasted OK but not good enough to make again.  I used boneless chicken breasts, & they did come out moist.  The addition of the white wine still gave it a blander, just tomatoey taste.  I'm guessing that I'd like the taste of a marsala or red wine better, instead of the white wine.

This is my first review.  I've made this recipe twice now, and it's been great both times, even when i haven't followed the exact measurements.  I didn't use flour either, and it worked very well. I put mine over penne pasta.  My husband says it's a keeper!

A greasy, gooey mess.  skip the flour and use skinless chicken breasts.  Sauce needs some help too.

Not enough tomatoes as is.  While cooking, I added a small can of tomato sauce to make it red as the sauce was very pale.  Had to add a lot more salt and pepper because it was very bland.  Added tomato juice to what was already in our plates.  I will make this again but certainly put 2 cans of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce.

It was delicious!!  I used all thighs and removed the skin so I needed more oil.   Served it with rigatoni and a cucumber salad.   Will make it again.

I found that the browned skin fell off the chicken (which was a time consuming task) so I may just go skinless next time. Other than that one issue (that is easily resolved) I found this to be a delicious recipe and will be making it again!

Okay I laugh at reviews that say it was great but I changed the recipe.  I changed recipe due to circumstance - I had no mushrooms and I used tomato paste as well and added seasoning, such as basil ( approx 1 tsp) and rosemary(approx 1 tsp)) and more oregano ( 1Tbsp).  Family loved the results.

Excellent Cacciatore recipe!  I found this recipe to be not overly complicated and full  of flavor.  I used only chicken thighs as a personal preference but that was the only change and I doubt it altered the flavor much.  I made this for my family (including two small kids) and some workmates and everyone loved it!  This will definitely be getting made again.

Delicious and yet so simple. I cook for a large family and it is not always easy finding something that everyone loves. This one was a winner. I work so it is important to find dinners that are fairly quick, but still taste good. A new favorite at our home.

I thought it was great.  Put in some parsley and a wee bit of chilli as I like it hot.  The only thing I change is the green pepper.  I put it in at the same time as the mushrooms otherwise it becomes a mush.

This was great.  I followed some others suggestions.  I skipped the breading, especially to make it gluten free, and browned the chicken in coconut oil.   I used a can of diced tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce; added a few drops of red pepper sauce,  a little extra garlic, and some basil and parsley in addition to the oregano.  It had just enough spice and was very tender.

Loved The recipe. I served it with penne. Changes: did not flour chicken, 2 cans of  diced tomato much better. Cut up chk tenders & added last 10 minutes after simmering for flavors for 20-25 min. Cut chicken into cubes as suggested by another reviewer.

After reading the 1-star comments on this recipe, I did add a little Italian seasoning (a well known brand of salad dressing, in fact!).  I used skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes), and about 4 diced fresh tomatoes.  The sauce was thick, the chicken was well cooked, and the whole family loved it!!  Definitely going to become a regular in my kitchen.

I think that for the folks who found the sauce too thin, that's what comes of using lots less flour, which clearly acts as the thickener for this sauce, hence so much of it*!* I'm with the folks who thought that there's tons of other recipes, why not post your own, if it's vastly different? I do love reading all of your reviews and do take ideas from them all, so there is that!! ENJOY**

Was delicious. My family loved it.I ended up using a little more wine because the liquid. In the pan dissipated. Too much. I have never cooked with wine before. The flavor the wine added was surprisingly different. I purchased. A decent wine because I figured if the wine tasted bad then the dish would. Then had a cup of the wine while cooking.

This recipe was fine.  There is nothing exciting about it.  I worried about it being bland, so I put more garlic and added a bay leaf while it simmered.  Overall it was fine, I just prefer a heavier pasta dish.  This is a good recipe for someone wanting a lighter dish.

Wonderful recipe. My family loved it. The only thing I did different was I cooked it in my crock pot, It made the chicken melt in your mouth. The veggies were very tender. It was a fantastic served with a salad and warm bread.

This very good but a little bland.  I will make again and add red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning.

Great recipe. Made it for dinner today & it was quite a hit. I omitted the white wine with red wine, used less flour. Someone suggested stewed tomaoes & diced tomatoes and it gave it a little xtra flavor which was very nice. I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs & Served over Penne Pasta (Both on sale) Meal for four plus 2 extra lunch servings cost me less than $10.00 to make. Great recipe.Keeper.

I made this with a few changes. You certainly don't need 2 cups of flour. I used 1/2 cup and threw out at least 1/4 cup of it. Also, I added 1 cup of wine instead of 1/2 cup and I used 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning. This is very good. I did use chicken breasts as we are trying to cut down on fats.
Due to my changes I only gave it a 4 star rating. It isn't the best I have had but very good.

This was a really solid, tasty recipe that I'll definitely be making again.  I ended up adding more peppers and mushrooms because my family loves veggies.

This was a huge hit with my family.  My husband gave it a 4 or 4 1/2 but my son said a 5.  Since my son is a very picky eater, I went with his rating.  LOL  I took some of the advice from other reviews and wrote them down.  This recipe will become a regular at our house.  Thanks you so much for helping me find something new and different to make with a picky eater in the house.

wasn't the worst but its not the cacciatore I a grew up eating. I will definitely only use chicken breast next time because it came out really greasy tasting. I agree with the other reviews and recommend using red wine for a richer taste and more appealing color. the final result was a thin, orange, greasy,  sauce.

I made this in my tiny apartment kitchen, and invited my best friends (two hungry college boys) to come help me. I'm glad I had them on hand to wash dishes, because I needed several pots and pans. It was delicious and worth the effort. The portions are big!

EXCELLENT! Made this for a 10-person dinner party - big hit! At the advice of others, I DID flour the chicken, and it came out tender and juicy.  I also substituted the white for RED wine, and added tons of garlic.  This has become a family favorite, and I'll be making this again many times!!! Thanks for a great recipe!

Tried this for the first time though I have no basis for comparison as this is the first time I've tasted chicken Cacciatore.  I almost always try the recipes as given first before altering it at all, just to see how it evolves.  This time however, the red wine vs. white wine seemed to make more sense.  I also went with Olive Oil again because it just made more sense.
While cooking it I wasn't too sure as I smelled the dish, but when finished it was fantastic.

This was a really good recipe.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I pretty much took the advice of the other reviews to modify it.  My only major change was the switch from white wine to red, which I think was a great choice.  Oh and I used fresh diced tomatoes and no mushrooms.  It was really flavorful.  I served with yellow rice, broccoli, and sliced tomato. Yummy.

This was pretty good if your in the mood for italian. I would have added a habanero pepper to spice it up. I guess I was expecting something different tasting from all the reviews but it wasn't shockingly delicious.

Maybe I overcooked this, but it just didn't have enough flavor for us.  In my opinion, it was underseasoned.  Has potential, though.  Thanks for the recipe.

absolutely wonderful!! Only thing I think I messed up was using Olive oil in place of vegetable oil which im sure would be fine, wish I would have drained it out before adding the onion and peppers. Over all this recipe is good the family liked it and i will make again the flavor is wonderful!!

I liked this but it had a little bit of a scorched taste to the sauce; I'm thinking it was my fault since I used more oil than called for to fry the chicken.  Afterwards the flour on the bottom of the pan looked quite brown and I didn't  take it out, I added my veggies as the recipe stated to that oil.  Over all the flavors were good; like others said it would have been thin so I added a little bit of spaghetti sauce I had leftover.  Thanks!

This was just ok...'nothing special' my husband said.  I always relate how much I like something by how good it tastes in relation to the effort put into making it.  To us, this wasn't worth the effort and I will likely not make again.

This dish was ok to me, but my husband absolutely loved it. I added a small can of tomato sauce and I omitted the mushrooms because I didn't have any. Next time I will not use any flour just as other reviewers have suggested.

Very flavorful recipe !  I used bone in chicken breasts, removed the skin and browned in olive oil without any flour.   I like my sauce to have a thick texture so I used 2 cans diced tomato,1can stewed and 2 small cans tomato sauce.  Followed everything else as written, except 1 cup red wine and more seasonings.  Sauce was amazing!  The flavor of the meat on the bone really flavors the sauce and gives it that meaty flavor that you won't get from boneless chicken breasts.  Loved it, will definately make again and again

We really enjoyed this!  The sauce turned out very thin, so I added some canned tomato sauce to thicken it up. If I hadn't had to do this, I would have given it five stars!

Very good. 1 cup of flour is plenty, to which I added a 1/2 teas. garlic powder with the salt & pepper shake excess off chicken pieces before sauteing, and keep heat med. temp to keep flour from burning.  Sauted sliced onions with the mushrooms before adding 1 can diced tomatoes with basil, 1/2 can ground tomato's + small can of tomato sauce.  Had no red wine, so skipped  it this time and added 1 teasp. minced garlic, salt, pepper and some parsley.  Had plenty of sauce for the chicken and to pour over the speghetti.  Very good, Jane,

This was good, next time could be better!  I only used 1 cup flour, and not even all of that, for chicken thighs & legs.  Extra flour just seems to burn when browning (am I doing something wrong?).  I added 1 can of Italian style stewed tomatoes.  While it cooked I skimmed fat off the top, maybe next time will try chicken breasts or take some skin off legs & thighs.  Served with whole grain wide noodles, delicious!

Awesome!   I have some picky eaters but they loved this dish.  I changed a few things; I used 6 Boneless, skinless breasts, and omitted the mushrooms. I served this with a vegi rice pilaf and watermelon.  The kids ate it all, I thought there would be plenty of leftovers.  This is going in my recipe box.

Lovely recipe.  'Using cavatappi (spiral maccaroni) pasta & bone-in, skin on, thighs cuz it's what I have on hand.  I've substituted 2 stalks of sliced celery for the bell pepper, and simmered the mushrooms for the whole 40 min.,out of consideration to my finickey 10 y.o. Sauce is beautifully balanced thanks to the many reviewers notes about thorough browning.  No wine, used a 1/4 c of rice wine vinegar in 1/2 c chicken stock.  Tangy and complex.  Thankx Mom.

I actually modify this recipe for a crock pot. If I have time I follow the coat/brown method than pop in the pot with the rest of the ingredients for 4 hours. Usually I just put all the ingredients in without browning the chicken (using thin sliced breasts) and just let it go. Super yummy and very easy. We eat this a few times a month!  PS I do use red wine instead of white.

Fantastic recipe, full of flavor. One of the best ways to use bone in chicken. Followed exactly with no changes. One note, salt liberally. This on on my regular rotation now.

A very satisfying meal.  I made several changes though.  I thin sliced the bell pepper instead of dicing, and I use Italian Seasoning mix instead of just Oregano.  Being a hunter myself, I also tried it by substituting rabbit for the chicken.  It turned out great.  We served it over rice.  Chicken or rabbit, it will please the whole family.

This was fantastic. I made only minor changes. I purchased a whole chicken already cut up and after browning and then cooking the onions and peppers I transferred all to a casserole dish and baked with the wine, mushrooms and tomatoes at 350 degrees for 40 minutes. This was only because my skillets were not large enough. My fiance was skeptical as he never liked Chicken Cacciatore as a kid, but was pleasantly surprised. I will definitely make this again and will be a great meal for entertaining.

The recipe was pretty good, but my husband decided he just doesn't like chicken with pasta very much.  So that was too bad.  I added some fresh broccoli from the garden.  I used penne noodles.  I really liked it the night I ate it, but I ended up tossing the leftovers which I hate doing, but everyday I wuold try to eat the leftovers-it just didn't look good anymore.  Maybe I will make it again and use a different sauce.

I made this one for a dinner party.  Everyone loved it.  I made a few modifications based mostly on other reviews.  I used four cloves of garlic, red cooking wine, boneless chicken breast (its all I had), and olive oil instead of vegetable.  The only other things I did differently was once it was all together, I let it simmer for about 2.5 hours.  I imagine if you want the vegetables a little more firm, simmering this long wouldn't be a good idea.  I thought everything turned out great though.

This was really quite fantastic.  I fried ths chicken nice and slow and made sure that that I browned both sides really good.  There was a remarkable depth of flavor in this dish.

I served this over polenta that I made with milk rather than water and finished with butter and cream.

Overall this turned out extremely elegant, especially considering what it is.

I have to say it was my first time cooking this particular chicken cacciatore. And it was very easy to make I don't have an oven and I ran out of wine but it turned out great. I had it with penne pasta. Then melted some cheese on top it was fab.

It was better than OK, but not great.  Maybe I used the wrong kind of wine, but the recipe was unnecessarily vague on what wine to use.

This was a very easy recipe to follow.  I used chicken breasts marinated in a tomato base sauce and chicken broth instead of wine. Delicious, even better the next day as left overs.

I made this the other night, delicious. Simple and tasty. Chicken falls off the bone. Made with a side of white rice, the family loved it.

I've never had cacciatore before, so I don't have anything to rate this against, but I didn't think it was that good.

Very Very Good! I added a few more spices and lots of garlic and wine too. Used boneless skinless breasts cause that's all I had. Only thing different I did was to add a small can of tomato paste, as suggested. Excellent over rice. It soaks up the sauce REAL GOOD!YUM!

i slightly pounded my breasts
then per other reviews dipped in beaten egg then floured and browned.  someone said it's all in the browning and i truely believe they are 100% right!  thank you.  I don't use vegie oil, it's not good for u.  I used grapeseed oil.  I used Italian seasoning vs the oregano (although orengano is an immune booster) per antoher review, i used red wine and no peppers cause i don't like them and didn't have any.  I'm not the cacciatore fan, my hubby is so mushrooms didn't feel right.  I used a big can of fire roasted tomatoes.  after the chicken was brown.  I put it in the pot with the tomatoes and let it simmer for a good long time.  YUM  I wish i had made more!  I would've given this a 5 star if i hadn't made all the revisions.  THANKS for sharing!!

Made this using recommendations from other reviewers and still I thought the flavor was off just a little. I usually make a new recipe twice before deciding to keep or toss. I haven't made this a second time as of this writing, but I will probably make this again in the near future.

I wish I'd read the other reviews first. I should've skipped the flour because it came out a little thick.  Otherwise, it was very good. I served it without pasta because of the thickness and called it "Italian stew." It went over fine.

I doubled the veggies and added chicken broth to the rest of the ingredients. Chicken Cacciatore is suppose to be thin like marinara so I just fried my chicken pieces in olive oil , and did'nt thicken it. When I first read the recipe I thought you use cut up chicken but when I went back and read it a second time I realized it said "1(4 lb. chicken)cut in pieces) not 4 lbs. of chicken cut up! Thank you for the recipe it was exactly what I was looking for!

I must agree with most of the other reviews that this is a good "base" for cacciatore. Like many of the others, I added a can of tomato paste, used Italian style diced tomatoes, Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, and garlic salt and powder to taste. This is a family favorite!!

My whole family enjoyed this healthy meal served with whole wheat pasta, even my fussy toddler.  Chicken turned out very tender after simmering for an hour and a half. I used legs for the kid's and a couple of breasts for my husband and I. Doubled the tomatoes, used Sherry instead of wine because I didn't have any, lot's of garlic, oregano, basil and added a little bit of chicken stock near the end because it was a little thick. Tasted very yummy!

Had to use pork tenderloin, because my mom doesn't like chicken. It's a good recipe, but next time i'm going to marinate the pork, to make it a little tastier. Added 4 tablesponns of cream cheese to the sauce, and baked for 25 minutes until the meat was cooked through. Of course, next time i'll use chicken.

My dish looked nothing like the photo.  The sauce was thin and I had to cook this for a very long time until the chicken was cooked through.  No one liked this.

this is a great recipe. thanks for posting. I made a few changes. First, I added a generous amount of hot pepper. I like a hot cacciatore. Second, I let it simmer on the low heat for more than an hour, stirring every 10 min or so. I like to let the chicken really soften up and soak up the sauce. Finally, prefer sherry over white wine.

Very good! I followed most of the recipe. I didn't flour the chicken just on personal preference. Didn't use white wine b/c I didn't have any, so I used chicken broth. Didn't use a green pepper, not b/c I didn't want to...I started cutting it and there was a WORM in it! Gross! I didn't buy it at my usual grocer and this is what happens! Anyway, it was excellent. Served it over no yolk wide egg noodles. It was really good ~ I ate so much my stomach hurt afterwards. I also served it with a side of sliced carrots, I'll probably just throw those in the pot next time. Excellent!

This is a great recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and added an extra can of tomatoes and used red wine. It was on the bland side. My neighbor tried the same recipe but under my advice added twice the garlic and twice the oregano. She said it was perfect. This is a keeper!!

This was pretty good...I added a second can of tomatoes based on other reviews and the sauce was still VERY thick. I doubled the garlic and added some Italian seasoning with the oregano. Also added some garlic powder to the flour mix. We're not white wine drinkers so I substituted red and you could definitely taste it.

Very tasty... I used chicken thighs, and substituted low-sodium chicken broth for the white wine, and let it simmer for about 1 hour.  The chicken was incredibly tender and fell off the bone.  Served over brown rice, it was delicious!

This was all right...I tried using a lot of suggestions from others, and I think I overspiced it! I would try to tone down next time. The chicken was very tender.

THis recipe was good but needs some additions. The sauce is too thick as it is and needs another can of tomatoes added. I also added a tsp of Italian seasoning and fresh basil and oregano. I cooked it in my electric skillet at about 350 degrees and found that I needed more oil to fry the chicken in. Overall, a good basic recipe just needs some tweaking.

This was excellent!  I put in twice the oregano and also added dried basil, plus a little extra wine, because I enjoy a healthy amount of seasoning and I served it over egg noodles.  Mmmm good!

Chicken was very tender and tasty prepared this way.  Not your traditional heavy tomato sauce, but a great flavor and a good way to get your veggies.

I have made this a few times now, and everyone really likes it. I omit the flour coating and I use chicken breasts just to make it a little lower in fat, and serve it with Tomato Basil spagetti noodles. Thanks for the recipe Jana.

I have made this recipe several times but always found it lacking.  Then I tried port wine instead of the white wine and it was awesome!  It gives the meal exactly what it needs.  Just enough of a punch to get that earthy flavor it claims to have.

This was delicious.  Didn't have wine, so I used stock instead, I don't think it's a noticeable difference.  This recipe makes good chicken, but the sauce - over a bed of whole wheat fusilli - was incredible.  I will make more of the sauce next time.

This dish was very very bland!! I did use chicken breasts and not a whole chicken.  I know that alone would have gave it more flavor and probably would have been just what this dish needed...still worth 4 stars - I didn't have to throw it out (would have been an expensive waste if I had!) and it was edible, bland but edible.  Might have to try this one again, it was really easy to make!

I used a burgundy cooking wine instead of white wine, and used fresh tomatoes, and this recipe turned out lovely.  Very nice over noodles.

After all the rave reviews I was a bit disappointed with this recipe.  I will try again using sherry instead of white wine and less of it, a lot more seasonings and a little brown sugar.

I absolutely loved this recipe.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I thought that the sauce should have been a little thicker.  I used red wine instead of white, which I thought would go better with a hunters sauce.  Glad I did.  Next time, I will par boil the chicken to get rid of the excess fat, which should thicken the sauce.
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Great recipe! I used a red pepper,black olives,more mushrooms,tomato sauce and tomato paste to thicken the sauce.I like to use boneless chicken breasts (cut into smaller pieces)and boneless thighs. After browning I cooked it in a large crockpot. I served it on linguine. My hubby and company loved it. It's a keeper!

:( I was disappointed with this recipe. I embellished it after reading all the reviews and it was VERY bland. I added about 6 cloves garlic, and fried the chicken in bacon fat (trimming the bacon afterwards and adding the meat) I used red wine and I used a dash of red pepper. It was really bland.

This recipe is so delicious.  More garlic of course - always more garlic.  Also, make at least twice the amount of sauce so there is enough to go over the pasta (I absolutely detest when, for example, at Italian restaurants the waiter brings a side of pasta with bland marinara sauce.  What are they thinking???)  THe bacon is an excellent touch.  My boyfriend likes it with sauteed red peppers in place of the green ones.

We love this recipe!!!  I have made it a few times.  I do add a little extra garlic, a red bell pepper, black olive slices and some capers.  The whole house smells good when this is simmering on the stove.  Guests always ask for this recipe!

This was pretty good and super easy.  I seasoned the flour more with cajun and the sort.  I also left out the mushrooms and bell peppers since I didn't have any on hand.  I used stewed tomatoes (which I diced up) and simmered this all in chicken broth (which I sub. for the wine) and served it over linguine noodles.  Nice and simple meal.  Thanks

My husband loved it!  Definitely a good starting point, though it needs a few alterations to make it just right.  I added red pepper flakes to give it that kick it needed.  Next time will use more garlic and herbs, and drain the canned tomatoes or use fresh tomatoes.  Between the tomato juice, wine, and liquid from the mushrooms, the sauce was just a tad too liquidy.  Great over pasta.

Great basic recipe. I added 1 teaspoon crushed red pepper and went by others advise and used red wine.  Also added 2T of tomato paste. I will increase red pepper next time I make this. Family really enjoyed.

Excellent recipe, used a 28oz can of diced tomatoes and added 1 small can of tomato paste but other than that, kept it as listed.  Turned out delicious, will definitely be making again.  Thank you very much!

I tried to make this 'as described' but I messed it up a bit.  I used the wine to deglaze the pan after I browned the chicken.  I also added some basil, because I grabbed the wrong spice jar when I was going for the oregano.  The only intentional change I made was to use bone-in thighs rather than a whole chicken.

I'm not sure why it's important to brown the chicken first, when it's going to end up stewing in the juice.  The skin was nice and crispy before the wet ingredients were added.  By the time the dish was served, the skin was limp and unappetizing, so we just removed it afterward.

I also found the sauce to be a bit too oily by the time it was served.  Probably because I had used only thighs, with skin on.  The next time I make it, I'll use boneless, skinless thighs.

The flavour was excellent and this will now be added into our list of keepers.

Loved this recipe for perfect cacciatore inspiration:) I swapped the white wine for a cup of red wine, added a can of tomato paste, and used chicken thighs instead of breasts. Enjoyed making and eating!

It turned out really good! Good recipe! I used 3 big chicken quarters. Next time I make it, I will put the chopped green pepper in at the end with a lot of mushrooms.

I found this recipe to be superb.  I CAN’T STAND it when reviewers COMPLETELY change the recipe and then leave a review.  Make it as is, eat it, and review it. If you change the recipe keep your opinions to yourself, or better yet, submit your own recipe!!!

I generally make the recipe as written which most people should do first. If it is good then fine give it your review, Then if you change things to your liking. If you added more garlic then that is to your liking. Some people do not know why certain things are omitted while others do. Flour for instance. The chicken will brown and it will also thicken the sauce which comes from all the other ingredietes. Most people will change thing to their liking which changes the original recipe making it THEIR recipe.

The only change I made was that I used my own tomato puree. It made the sauce not as chunky.  I would not used canned tomato puree but if you want it less chunky use crushed tomatoes. Excellent flavor.

It was a good recipe,although it  was lacking in flavor. I  used boneless skinless chicken thighs. I would increase the seasoning and it would be a five star dish.

I followed the directions and it was pretty obvious that my dish was not turning out like others.  I normally do not have such bad luck with recipes, but this was sincerely a toss in the trash and come up with something else really quickly.

This was actually better than I expected, but still not a keeper.  I did add grated parm at the end. Frying the chicken and then braising in the tomato sauce is a bad idea, all that crispness gets soggy and some of the breading fell off.

Excellent chicken; Rustic, comforting, flavourful and easy to make. I didn't use the flour and just seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before cooking. I did find the sauce needed a bit of thickening due to omitting the flour so I added a bit of cornstarch slurry (about 2 tsp of cornstarch) along with the mushrooms. I used two bell peppers and cut into strips instead of diced but otherwise made as listed. The cook time is right on,  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this as alternative to my spaghetti sauce, so I make it up and freeze in smaller containers to serve 2-4 persons.  Added red wine, instead of white and add a can of Italian tomatoes, a sprinkle of sugar and more red wine when reheating.  Yummy!

I followed the recipe but added more garlic and oregano. If I make it again, I think I will skip the flour for the chicken and add more spices as my family thought this recipe was a little bland.

I used extra virgin olive oil, a bold dry red wine with a earthy taste, red onion, chicken thighs, and half of a bulb of garlic.
Simmered the chicken in the tomato juices and wine for a few hours to give it some thickness and then served it on brown rice.

Awesome!  Even my fussy 12 year old daughter loved it.  I didn't have any wine so I substituted balsamic vinegar and added a tablespoon of honey.  I also substituted red pepper for green pepper.  Had it on rice the first night and pasta on the next night.  Delicious!

I made this with some variations because I was snowed in and could not get all the recommended ingredients.  My VERY picky step kiddo's were thrilled and dare I say it is a do-over!  Here are the changes, I added 2 tsp dried oregano to the flour, S & P.  10 boneless, skinless chicken thighs dredged in flour mixture, then browned for 10-15 minutes in olive oil.  In same pan I softened 1 red onion (it was all I had) and heaping tsp of garlic.  Added back the chicken, 2 cans of 14.5 diced tomatoes, 1/2 can of black olives, 2 tbls capers, 1 cup of Merlot (I think a red makes it richer in flavor), 2 tsp oregano, 1tsp thyme,2 bay leaves, a pinch of red pepper flakes (I will try the mushrooms next time).  I cooked for 30 min and let it sit off the heat for 2 hours until we were ready to eat.  I served it over rigatoni noodles and voila!  My mom used to make this for me as a kid...  I miss her, but she would have been proud!  Give it a try!!!

I made this tonight following the recipe.   I liked the flour as it thickened the liquids.  It came out great.  'Onlyyummy', I too do not understand how people can rate a recipe after they have changed it up, added this, or that.   In those cases, these cooks should post their own recipes.

This was good. Too much flour. Don't need that much. Next time I'll use just 1 cup and I'll season the chicken before I coat it with flour. I absolutely love garlic. Next time I'll add a bit more. I prefer olive oil so that's what I went with. Also used 1 1/2 c of white wine. I spread it over a bed of 100% whole wheat spaghetti. Wife and kids were stuffed and impressed. Cheers!

I really enjoyed this dish. Loved the flavor combination. I added some Italian seasoning also, but Hubby thought it was a little bland.  The second night I served this I added some hot sausage links; that spiced it up for him!  :)

It was good but not great so not sure if I'd make again. Did light coating of flour and used less tomatoes since don't like too many. Also added1/2 tsp basil.

I always think that recipes like this don't call for enough oil for browning and this was no different. the end result was really good although, I had to add a good amount of salt and pepper to our families taste.  I served over Penne

I made this last night for my family and they loved it.  It was perfect for some family members with dietary restrictions.  So those who needed more salt or heat did themselves.  Will definitely cook this dish again.  Thanks!

I liked the ingredients and saw the cooking video, so I was good to go cooking!  It turned out so good!!  My husband does not care for chickens and said that he never liked the dish before.  Well, the recipe is so great that he liked the dish.  I tweaked by adding followings: 1)Added powder of paprika, onion and garlic in the flour to coat chicken. 2)Kept white wine instead of red. 3)Add both dried oregano and basil. 4)Used fresh tomatoes instead of can’s. 5)Add a few dash of cayenne pepper to kick. 6)Add 1/2 tsp of chicken bouillon to add the flavor. 7)Added shredded carrots. Depending on your taste preference: I did not like to have strong tomato taste, so I did not add any tomato sauce or pure, but the dish had wonderful mixture of all vegetables. Also, Usually chicken and white wine go very well, and I would still highly recommend white wine for the dish!!

made this with just two chicken breasts cut up but left the sauce the same.  Did not put chicken in for all of cooking time.  Put it in with the mushrooms so that it was tender at the end.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Travis loved it.

Very good.  I added a little garlic powder and bread crumbs to the flour before coating the chicken.  Used a red bell instead of green, and fresh tomatoes and basil from the garden, skipping the oregano.  Added some capers when I threw in the mushrooms. Served with some good bread to soak up the delicious sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

This dish is okay.  I think I discovered that I don't like chicken cacciatore.  It has nothing to do with the recipe, I'm just not a fan.  I wish I had read the review that stated her grandma made this "stew".  That would have told me a lot, since I don't care for stew.  Glad I tried it though.

Excellent- so juicy! Very easy to make. I basically followed the recipe except I used 4 chicken cutlet breasts, a lot less flour to coat the chicken, and used red wine instead of white (personal preference). This is a keeper!

I have tried this recipe 3 times. The first as written, it was wonderful. A great was to get veggies into the diets of my husband and children. The second time I left out the flour as others had suggested and I must say it was not as good as the first time. I also try to eliminate flour in many recipes but for this one you need some. This time I laid out my chicken on a board, sprinkled it with celery salt, garlic powder and black pepper, then sprinkled enough flour to rub on the top of the chicken before putting it in the frying pan. This was just enough to keep the flavor!

This recipe is good, but a couple points :(1)- NEVER use plastic bags to bread ANYTHING...dumb, dumb, dumb!. . . a heavy, brown paper bag in just the right size won't stick to itself, especially when battering before breading.
(2) - Whoever heard of "quartering" fresh mushrooms? . . . perhaps they meant slice in 4 slices!

I used flavored diced tomatoes (italian style) and served the chicken over whole wheat linguini. 
YUM!

Used basil instead of oregano.  Put it on top of noodles. Thought it was very tasty. Will be making again, next time with oregano.

I used chicken thighs, italian seasoning instead of oregano and stewed tomatoes.  The sauce was thin for our liking, next time I will add some tomato sauce or paste.  Served this over angel hair pasta with garlic bread and a green side salad.  Thanks for posting.

So good!  I used boneless breasts and seasoned diced tomatoes.  It needed just a pinch of crushed red pepper.  Fabulous - thanks for sharing!!

I do this in the oven.  I brown the chicken without flour, add  onion, celery sometimes. I don't use peppers or mushrooms or wine. I add a bay leaf. I season it with oregano and garlic. I can't eat peppers. I serve it with spaghetti but it is just as good with rice. The secret is to season it to your own taste.

I did not care for this recipe - it was a waste of $20 worth of ingredients.  Way too much green pepper.  I tried to tweak the sauce with a bit a sugar, fresh basil and I still didn't like the taste.
