I made this recipe yesterday, starting it before work and coming home to the most wonderful aroma. (I just love slow cookers!).   I used a homeade vegetable stock I had on hand instead of boullion and adjusted the water accordingly. I too did not change anything else because it looked good to me on paper and I'm happy to report that it turned just wonderful. The meat was so tender and the flavor was great.

For my own preference I took a bit of liquid out just before serving and whisked in a bit of flour till it was smooth and then poured it back into the cooker for about 20 minutes to thicken is up a bit. I prefer a thicker "stew".  This was so tasty and just what I needed after a long day.  I highly recommend :-)

My husband and his mom loved this recipe. We followed the directions to a T. My husband generally doesn't eat red meat so I was very happy he enjoyed this.  I personally like a lot of flavors so I was happy with the seasoning and probably won't change that.  To the reviewer below though, it's red wine, not red wine vinegar.  That probably would taste really bad in a slow cooker.  Great recipe overall. Thank you

This was easy and very good!  Don't let the description that says a LOT of onion scare you...it is not at all overpowering.  The only thing I expected to be different was the consistency...I thought it would be Thicker so maybe next time I can remedy that by adding less liquid.  Ate it over cornbread and was very tasty and filling.

My family did not like this at all.  I took a few cues from other reviews and cut the rosemary and thyme in half.  The red wine vinegar over powered all other spices.

This was probably the best beef stew I've made in a while if not ever.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it but, as a previous reviewer said, I don't think this recipe will feed 6 people. I will definately make this again but next time I'll add mushrooms and a few more vegetables.  Also, a couple of Tbsps of quick-cooking tapioca will thicken the sauce while it cooks (a tip I learned from the booklet that came with my crock pot).

Double the flour when coating the meat. After removing meat and adding onions, sprinkle remaining flour over them. Brown onions and put meat back in pot. Add 3-4 tbs of tomato paste, tossing all to coat. This gives a rich coating and adds another taste dimension and also helps thicken the stew

I MADE IT AS WRITTEN, and it was good.  Next time I will add more wine.  It will NOT feed as many people as it says.  I made it scaled for 6 servings, and it barely fed my husband, two kids (ages 2 and 5) and me.  I didn't think the rosemary was overpowering at all either.  I will make this again with the addition of more wine, but will scale it for more people.

We really liked this stew; my husband especially loved it and said it was one of the best beef stews he's ever eaten. I did make a few changes. I didn't put any wine in, and the second time I made I used half the thyme the recipe called for. The first time I made it we all thought the thyme flavor was a bit overpowering, so we liked it better with less. Still, a five star recipe!

This was very good. Easy to prepare and tasty.
I left out the Wocestershire (only because I didn't have any) and it was still god.  Next time I might add some mushrooms.

This was great!  I really enjoyed it, and it was easy to put together.  I needed this for lunch, so I made it at 10pm and let it cook overnight on low.  I didn't pre-cook the beef or onions.  I omitted the wine but used a splash of red wine vinegar.  I also used a can of beef broth instead of boullion, and added lots more carrots and some fresh green beans.  Also added a fresh garlic clove.  About 1.5 hours before we ate, I thickened it with a flour/water paste (twice) because it was more soup-like than stew like.  I know I made a lot of changes, but this is still a 5-star recipe because it lends itself very well to changes.

I love this recipe! Feeds a house full of hungry men. I usually add extra beef carrots and potatoes. But other than that I wouldn't change anything. Also good with bread bowls

Loved it!  I'm pretty sure you need to double the recipe though.  The way it is written will not feed six.

I'm bummed that I wasted the ingredients because it doesn't taste good.  Next time I'll make my regular beef stew - it has a much better flavor.

Oh my gosh! This is the BEST beef stew I have ever made. I was one recipe away from never making beef stew again and I decided to try this one! I finally found a recipe I love! The only thing I did different was no rosemary (out) and no potatoes (out of these too!), but I didn't add anything or do anything else different. Absolutely fabulous! Thank you!

This stew was delicious and so easy.  I used tiger sauce in place of the worcestershire and it added a great touch.  Reviews are right...it won't feed four as is.

This was easy and very tasty. I left out the onion as my wife and I arn't onion eaters. I also added a can of whole corn kernals right at the end of the cookining time. And I used beef broth instead of water and a beef bouillon cube, I'm guessing they have the same effect. All in all a very delicious meal.

Thanks for a simple and delicious recipe. My family didn't find the rosemary and thyme overpowering at all. I couldn't use the onion due to allergies, but the stew was very flavorful without it. I took the suggestions of others and doubled the recipe, this fed our family of four comfortably with a little left over for lunch the following day. As with all soups and stews it was even better the second day. I added a cup and a half of frozen peas, preheated in the microwave, and used prepared bouillon instead of a cube and water. As others suggested, it was more a soup than a stew so I also thickened it during the last few minutes of cooking. I will definitely make this again.

This was an awesome recipe. My Parents have never had slow cooker style stew, and they came back for seconds! Since we're not big on wine, we omitted it, and it still came out great! We just substituted more beef broth. Definitely a keeper!

I usually don't write reviews but this is the best beef stew recipe I ever tried. Very flavor full. I did not have wine and used 1 cup of beer instead. SO GOOD !!
Thank you for posting the recipe :)

I used a 2.5 lb roast instead of stew meat.  It made plenty and I'll freeze the leftovers and make a beef pot pie in a few weeks.  I thought it was pretty good; I added too much water though because it was pretty runny.  The meat was wonderful and I shredded it with a fork before serving.  I think a few more veggies would be nice.  Next time I'll add a little more spice.  Definitely missing something but I'll make it again.

Hi there..... Pretty tasty recipe.... I thought the rosemary and the thyme were a bit over powering but would make it again and just add a little less of those..Overall we enjoyed it... thanks....

This is very similar to my beef stew. I don't use thyme because I don't like it. I did add wine this time and it was good. One review said the "red wine vinegar" overpowered it..probably because the recipe called for "red wine" and NOT vinegar! You can add instant potatoes to thicken any stew or soup w/o changing the flavor.

This was mighty good, instead of wine I used beef stock because that is what I had on hand. This was so good, that even my son who hates onions ate it and had seconds. I did however double the recipe. I fed four with just enough left for one serving for lunch the next day. For lunch I served it over rice, and it was still delicious.

Yummy and easy. Only thing I didn't differently was add a can of vegetable stock instead of water at the end. I also eyeballed the herbs and it was perfect. Can't wait to make again.

I took a risk making this recipe for the first time for a lunch party. It was an incredible success with everyone. Not a drop left.  I seasoned to taste with salt and added some sausage. Can I say scrumptious?

Very good, but the spices were very overpowering.  I won't add nearly as much next time.  Also, I thickened it during the last few minutes with a little bit of cornstarch and cold water.  Overall, it's a great crockpot recipe!

Good basic starter recipe.  Needs to be adjusted to taste and veggies can be added to or changed.  OH BTW If you think red wine and red wine vinegar are the same.....Oh my 1/4 cupmust of been quite strong.

Seems as if this would work just as well to cook in dutch oven on the stove and complete in an hour and a half stove top to the dinner table.  I apologize for comming across as a negative nancy but cooking ingredients before transfering to a slow cooker seems to defeat the idea of simplicity behind slow cookering.

This was not a killer recipe. The wine was too strong and the souce was super thin. My kids refused to eat it. I am sure that it has a taste that some people love but we won't make it again.

Highly recommended. Delicious and easy.  I work full time and am always looking for good slow cooker recipes.  The meat was so tender and even my son asked for seconds.  I can't get him to eat much else but bologna these days so you can imagine I was very happy about that. My husband enjoyed  it enought to as kme to "please" make it again. The only think I changed was I added my version of dumplings at the end. Steaming them for 20 minutes. For me it really added to the dish.

Not what I expected from the ratings. This would be a great venison recipe though. I like my beef stew traditional, this is definitely not a 'traditionally tasting" beef stew. The wine and rosemary and thyme made it more sweet than hearty.

Made this recipe exactly as stated and it was wonderful! The red wine gave it a very deep rich flavour. The only thing I found when serving was that there was definitely not enough for six so I would recommend doubling it if u need to feed more than 3.

Go Diego Go!  I loved this recipe & so did my boyfriend.  I had about 3 pounds of stew meat.  I added 1 cup of red wine and used a pound of carrots and a bag of baby potatoes which I cut in half.   I didn't have any bouillon cubes so I used beef stock. I had fresh rosemary so I threw in a few sprigs in place of the dried.  I also threw in a bay leaf.  The flavor was great. The recipe is a keeper.

We loved this recipe.  Changed the herbs but not the flavour.  Used real garden herbs instead of dried herbs.  Added two tablespoons of mixed oats for thickening.  Otherwise all flavours authentic to the recipe.  Turned out wonderfully.

Love beef stew. I do not buy stew meat as to me it is the tough part of meat. I buy a good cut of meat or even steaks and cut it up and it makes a much better stew.

I made this tonight and it was really good. I took the advice of the reviewer below and added flour towards the end to make it thicker. I agree with a different reviewer in cutting back on the spices, they were a bit overpowering. Other than that, my husband and I loved and I will be making this again!

As previous reviewers noted, this stew is deliciously adaptable. Recommend using a bit more flour - 1 TBSP not quite enough. I used TBSPs (not the 1/2 tsp) for the rosemary, thyme and two chopped cloves of fresh garlic. Also used 1/4 C Worcestershire. Otherwise, followed it exactly adding broccoli and cauliflower the last 1/2 hour and it turned out great! But 6 servings? We got 3 out of it. Liquid did not need thickening.

Good basic recipe, but like other reviewers, I had to modify it.  Doubled the amount of beef (came out just right for family of four), which also meant inreasing the boullion and red wine (which I added proportionately more of to give it a richer flavor), and added a bit more worcestershire sauce)and some minced garlic.  Also, for my slow cooker, this dish was done in less than 6 hours.

This stew was quite tasty, I did however use fresh garlic, canned beef broth (what I had on hand) and stirred in a couple of spoonfuls of tomato paste.

Unfortunately this recipe did not turn out as intended. The sauce was bland and watery.  Too much wine and not enough beef stock/salt. I don't know why it says it has a lot of onion. The onion was a pretty ordinary amount.

My husband loves his mom's beef stew, but when she shared her tips, she forgot to mention a special ingredient... Coca cola! So I reduce the water in this recipe and add coca cola at the end and mix everything well in the slow cooker! Yummy!

I've tried many slow cooker beef stew recipes. Pick this one.

This was delicious!  I added an extra potato, 1 whole bag of baby carrots (12oz), I doubled the rosemary because I was out of thyme, and then added some gravy mix at the end (I always do this with stew).  It was super-delicious!  Will definitely make again!

I normally do not ever add salt to a recipe but found this stew needed it. I also thought the overall flavor was bland.

A very tasty beef stew. I made a couple of minor substitutions: minced garlic for the garlic powder, and a can of beef broth in place of the bouillon/water. I did thicken the broth some.  I served it with cornbread, and it made for a yummy comfort-food dinner!

I have made this stew a few times, and have always loved it! I have made a couple of changes, I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of garlic powder. I cook one clove when I caramelize the onion and throw the other right into the crock pot. I also use 2 bullion cubes and don't cook with the wine. Its always a hit with my boyfriend!

I've made this many times and love it without making any changes. It's so nice to  have dinner done at the end of the day without any last minute work.

Followed the recipe as written with the exception of using 1 1/2 lbs of beef and 2 potatoes,  it was just enough for my family of 4, no leftovers :(  It was delicious, my kids loved it, will definitely make again!
