Tastes great!  Time-consuming and messy to make, but worth it.

This bread is WONDERFUL!! I made this bread a couple of months ago never having made a bread that you had to knead before. My husband loves it better than bread from the store! And at our Thanksgiving dinner we had at church I had a LOT of compliments saying that it was the best. I am planning on making this bread for Christmas presents this year!

I love to make bread. This one is truly great! The only problem I had with the recipe was that the dough will not all go into one 9X5 bread loaf pan. I made it into two and divided it into 24 slices rather than 16. The nuts give the flavor a great "surprise" twist. Good and hearty without being too heavy.

Great flavor and texture!  I made this in my Zojirushi bread maker--it got a little too high and the top collapsed, so I had a very rectangular looking loaf.  But it was still great for sandwiches, and I'll definitely try this recipe again the "old fashioned" way on a day that I have more time.

This is the first bread recipe that I've actually gotten to rise.  It is light, fluffy, and extremely tasty.  Excellent recipe.
