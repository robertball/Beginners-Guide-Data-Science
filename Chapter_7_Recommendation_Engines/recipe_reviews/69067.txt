The main thing that I wanted to comment on for those who may be looking, I had to tweak this recipe by using green enchilada sauce in place of the green salsa, and I opted to bake the taquitos instead of frying them.  We had good success by baking them for 9-10 minutes on a cooking sheet at 500 degrees.  Before putting them in the oven, we would baste the corn tortillas with olive oil.  Worked great!

Wow "hslonka", these were fantastic and what a great way to use up leftover chicken! I used regular flour tortillas and shredded cheddar because that's all I had in the house and they were still delicious. To make the tortillas more pliable, I gave them a steam bath by wrapping them in a damp paper towel and placing them in the microwave for a minute. To eliminate the open ends, don't place the filling in the middle, but close to the end toward you. Much like you would assemble an egg roll, start by folding the right and left sides inward and then roll forward while continuing to tuck in the sides as you go. The little bit of moisture from the microwave will also help seal them. Once rolled give them a good firm press and then thread your toothpicks. Yummy and thanks!

I couldn't get the tortillas to stay rolled long enough to fry them. I even tried 2 different packs of corn tortillas with no luck. I may try this again but first steam the corn tortillas before even attempting to roll them again. I ended up throwing away 1/2 a package of corn tortillas. :o( Attempted again, this time I steamed the tortillas first so they would roll easier. However, when I put them in the oil, they stuck to the bottom & ripped apart. So I decided I could bake them instead so I steamed each tortilla, sprayed the bottom of a glass baking dish with oil and sprayed the tops of the tortillas with oil as well. They came out just right and were very good. I placed some shredded cheddar cheese on top of them at the very end of baking time. I baked them about 10 minutes, but didnâ€™t actually time it exactly. Served with tomatillo salsa & sour cream & Mexican rice.

Ok.  I'll admit, I'm bias.  I LOVE TAQUITOS!!!!!  Regardless, this is a great recipe.  The entire family loves it.  I love it because I can double the recipe and make a whole bunch at once and freeze the rest.  Yes, you do have to warm the shells before rolling.  Hint for freezing:  Freeze the taquitos BEFORE frying them. Then just fry them frozen.  Don't need tooth picks for those and they stay together nicely.

my Grandmother thought me to make taquitos manageable when frying by lightly coating the outside end of the tortilla on the  with a flour paste  (mix 3 tsp flour 2 tsp water to a thick batter)Its like  using flour.

Instead of chicken, I use leftover pork from the Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker recipe (found on this site- yummmm!)... especially helpful if you can't find smoked cheese.  Also if you can't find smoked cheese, you can always stir in a couple drops of liquid smoke (more or less to taste) with the shredded chicken mixture.

WoW! This was a huge hit! We doubled it and served it at a party and nobody wanted to quite eating them. The only changes I made were instead of smoked I used Sharp cheddar with the swiss and I used green onions. The "green" Salsa I am assuming is salsa verde?? That is all I could find and I only used half because I didnt buy enough. It didnt matter much though. I had put the chicken it a crock with garlic and onion for a few hours till the meat was tender and fell apart. The filling was so  delicious. I also didnt have peanut oil so just used canola....worked fine. Served it with Guacamole,Sour Cream, & Salsa. The taquitos I usually have have hardly any filling. I like to get as much in there as I can. It makes it harder to keep together when rolling and frying but is so much more flavorful when you are eating them. Absolutly one of my favorite recipes I have made!

It took me a couple of tries to figure out that I needed to "loosen up" my tortillas before rolling them (the kept breaking!!)  I wrapped them in a damp paper towel and popped them into the microwave for about 30 seconds and that made them much easier to work with.  Kids loved them!  Thought I had made too many and it turns out- I didn't make enough!!

Too bad my husband doesn't like corn tortillas because these taquitos are delicious and I want to have them all the time! The key to making them turn out is not to use too much filling. The taquitos I've always seen are only as big around as your finger. So use a teeny bit of filling and wrap the warmed tortilla tightly before securing with toothpicks. I just wish they were as good when baked instead of deep fried.

Wow, so good and easy. I am not the greatest chef and my husband gets tired of the same ol'-same ol'... these taquitos really spiced up the dinner table. 
I used beef and chicken (seperatly) and regualr salsa because I live in the Middle Of No Where and we don't have green salsa. I also liked the beef better, but the chicken was good too. But I loved these taquitos! So easy! And I froze the extra filling and made more taquitos two nights later. So good.

I haven't made this recipe yet (I have my own that I use) but wanted to give a hint on getting the tortillas flexible so they don't break when you fill them.  
If you are deep frying them anyway, before you fill the tortillas, dip them into the hot oil (one at a time) for about 5 SECONDS -- just until they bubble a tiny bit (you can flip them one time during this process).  Then lay them out on paper towels to drain the oil from them.  After you do this, the tortillas get nice and flexible and won't break when you fill them.

I thought this recipe was really good.  I  boil 4 chile pods and added it to the mixture for a more spicer sauce.  Plus I seasoned the meat with 1 tsp of cumin chile powder and little black pepper.  That is the only thing that i added.  Other that i followed the recipe step by step.  Yummy.... the family loved it:) Thanks for sharing.

This recipe was excellent, I did make a few changes to make it more appealing to the family.  I skipped on the onions, added some chili powder, garlic salt, and a little Cajun seasoning to punch up the flavor. I steamed the tortillas in the microwave for about 30 seconds to make them easier to roll up.  I did baked the taquitos rather than fry to attempt reduce the calories.  Since they were baked I did not have to roll up the ends, I just rolled and laid them seemed side down in a glass baking dish.  Cooked for 15-20 minutes at 400 degrees.  Great Great dish.

Awesome!! I baked these instead of frying and brushed some olive oil on them. I also used bottled, fire roasted green salsa from my local market, Wegman's. The smoked cheddar was a perfect addition. I served them with guacamole, sour cream and mild salsa. Yum-O! I will serve these again for sure.

Linda Mclean had a great idea using the flour tortillas and steaming them in the microwave. I tried the corn tortillas and they crumbled. So I got out my flour tortillas, microwaved them, prayed oil on a cooking sheet and spread the tortillas with olive oil. Stuffed them, and baked at 500 for 10 minutes. Perfect. Oh and I used m.Jack and sharp cheddar cheese. So good!

Very good!! We don't have a deep fryer so we used a skillet, but they still came out very crispy. And we used mozzarella because we didn't have swiss, which I think worked more to our taste anyways. We couldn't stop! Definitely had to microwave the tortillas in the wet paper towel, they're very finicky! Will do again but maybe add something else to it, like maybe chopped chili's or something to give it a kick.

These were good :) I did mine in the oven, and as I expected, my poor corn tortillas split open. They still tasted great. I think if I'd been deep frying them right as I formed them up they'd have worked ok, but sitting around on the pan waiting for me to finish the others, gravity took its course and stretched the little tortillas past their breaking point. I had fully intended to deep fry them when I thought there would only be 20 of them, as per the recipe, but I had a lot more than 20 6-inch taquitos! I had those 20, plus another 10 or so regular sized flour tortillas full as well. So be advised, this recipe makes more than it says it does! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These are yummy! My kids all love them, and since I am always cooking mexican, I have all the stuff on hand. I also add a beaten egg in with the filling, it seems to hold together better and the taquitos are not as dry after you fry them. Delicious with the White Cheese Dip recipe!! Also, if you're watching what you eat, these are also tasty with the whole wheat tortillas.

I bought the thinnest corn tortillas I could find, gave them a steam bath, and toothpicked them to get them to stay rolled, but they just wouldn't.  Next time I think I will flavor the chicken a little extra and use a different kind of tortilla.  Not a bad recipe in all, but not exactly what I had in mind.

My taquitos turned out amazing! However, I made tons of changes to the original recipe. I didn't have any green salsa or smoked cheese so I just used regular salsa and normal Cheddar, kind of estimating on amounts.  I halved the recipe and still had enough filling for about 20 taquitos - I didn't put very much filling in each tortilla, so they were more like the frozen kind you buy the from the store. I steamed the tortillas in the moicrowave like over reviewers suggested which helped make them easier to work with.  I baked them on a cookie sheet at 500 for 9-10 mins. as others recommended and they turned out perfectly!

This is a highly customizable recipe.  We substituted ground beef seasoned with taco seasoning and instead of green salsa, we used a jar of three chili salsa.  One tip:  Rather than using up a ton of toothpicks, use bamboo skewers, which you can resuse over and over as you're cooking.  It's a labor intensive recipe, but comes out wonderful!

These were very tasty! I followed a few other suggestions; I used green enchilada sauce in place of the salsa, warmed a stack of tortillas in a ziplock bag (not fully sealed so they can vent) in the microwave to make them pliable, brushed both sides of each tortilla with oil (and once more over the top before placing in the oven) and baked at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes. Perfect and crispy. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were terrific! I also put the tortillas in the microwave wrapped in a damp towel for a minute, and it made it easy to fry them. I just used cheddar cheese and green enchilada sauce, so anything else would just jazz them up. Excellent!

Awesome. Loved them (and I don't really like smoked cheddar cheese).

Boil the chicken.

Tortilla softening recommendation:

You've got to use enough paper towels. Can't just use a single damp paper towel.  I used two, folded in quarters, stacked on top of the tortillas.

But, maybe layering one inbetween each tortilla would be better.  I wouldn't try microwaving a bunch at once. They'll start stiffening up again as you start filling & rolling them.

I'd do 3, maybe 4 at a time.

Another idea (if you're baking them like I did) would be to brush olive oil on one side of the tortilla before filling & rolling. That might help in the softening.

I used my baking stone, too.

These were so great! I cooked my chicken in the crockpot with a jar of salsa. I mixed the shredded chicken with some onions and placed it into my steamed corn tortillas. I placed the tortillas in a wet paper towel and microwaved them for a minuted. They were soft and I had no probelm with breaking. I didn't fry but brushed them with olive oil and baked them until crispy. Sereved with queso, quacamole, and sour cream. This a fun Saturday night meal that was a great alternative to eating out.

These were fabulous!  I've never cared much for jarred green salsa, so since tomatillos were on sale at the Mexican market, I made my own.  I also couldn't find a smoked cheese blend, so I used reduced fat smoked gouda from Trader Joe's and some cheddar I brought back from England (they have the best cheese over there).  I followed the advise of other reviewers and brushed the taquitos with oil and baked them.  They were so very good.  I served them with homemade quacamole (avocados were on sale too) and dinner was delicious!  DH and I fought over the leftovers the next day.  Thanks so much for the recipe, HeidiS!

Loved them! I did bake them instead of frying so they wouldn't be so greasy. I steamed the tortillas like others said to do and I took it further and brushed each one with oil.  That way they would get nice and crisp while the baked.  All in all it was a very yummy dish!

I can't give this a true rating since I baked instead of fried.  I boiled my chicken for 18 mins, then cooled for 5-10 mins & shreded.  I added a little bit of liquid smoke since I didn't buy smoked cheese.  I microwaved the white corn tortillas in a wet paper towel.  Rolled and put in glass baking dish seam side down.  Sprayed tops with pam, but most of them broke IN the oven.   I thought it was missing some seaoning.  I saw a recipe on food network that seasoned the chicken with 1tsp Cumin & 1/2tsp dried Oregano.  It also suggested dipping the tortillas in 1 inch warm oil.   I'll try that next time.

Awesome recipe!  I made it exactly like the recipe and they came out great.  A huge hit with the family.  I dipped the corn tortillas in the oil for a couple of seconds to losen them up and that made them easy to work with.

This dish made the super-bowl a hit. I did need  a way to better seal the tortillas to prevent the oil from searing the meat during the fry process.

Delicious! I took other reviewer's advise and wrapped the tortillas in a damp paper towel then microwaved them for about a minute. I had no trouble rolling them. I covered them lightly with canola oil and baked them at 500 degrees for 10 mins. I also used a spicy green salsa to give it a kick.

This are truely amazing but I changed it up a bit to make the recipe easier! I only mixed together in a bowl,  shredded cooked chicken, crumbled Queso Fresco, and my easiest to make homemade  green salsa. ( For green salsa, cook green tomatillos and jalapeÃ±os in boiling water and then drain and blend in a blender and add salt to flavor.) For break free tortillas when rolling your taquitos make sure you heat each tortilla in a pan. Place about a tablespoon of the mix at one end of the tortilla and roll towards the other end tightly and secure each end with a toothpick, this is very important because you don't want the filling to spill out. Then fry and enjoy!

This recipe was awesome. For those who are "folding challenged" try folding left & right sides in then roll. Not the usual way to roll taquitos but it works for me!

This recipe is really bad!  I have never rated anything in here below a 4!  My corn tortillas would not stay together even after steaming them so I made it with flour tortillas.  The flavor is awful and these even made me sick and I only ate half of one!  Do not try!  It is a waste of ingredients.

made this last night, what a mess. (1) cut recipe n half still made twenty. (2) even when tooth picks were used to hold the taquuitos they fail apart, or the tortillas broke all up. Those that were eat-able did taste very good. Either alot of practice is needed or a better way to roll them is,

I may have used too much chicken,  but I added more sauce to balance out the extra chicken I had put in.  It was not as flavorful as I was hoping.  My room mate used to make flautas/taquitos in college and hers were so much better than this!  This could use a clove of garlic, maybe a 1/2 tsp of salt, and some cumin.  Hopefully that'd give it a little bit of kick.  Brushing them with olive oil and baking them did wonders!  Eating them with guacamole, salsa, and/or sour cream made them taste much better.

These were fantastic! I changed up the filling ingredients with what I had on hand and they turned out perfect. I did bake instead of fry and that worked great.  Oven at about 500 degrees and watch after about 8 minutes or they might burn! I will make these again and again!

My husband and I love taquitos so I went out and bought a deep fryer to try this recipe. I used Ortega green tomatillo taco sauce and I was surprised at how good it was. I skipped the onion and mixed together pepperjack cheese, shredded chicken and sauce.  I steamed the corn tortillas 4 at a time in the microwave and secured the taquito with one toothpick. I fit 4 at a time in the fryer basket and they only took a few minutes to cook. These taquitos were perfect!  My husband wants me to make them for the next family gathering, they're that good. Wonderful taquitos dorados, gracias!

The corn tortillas would not stay rolled up and the stuffing fell in the oil even with 2 or 3 toothpics.  They also tend to break even after letting them get soft.  It was a big mess when I was through with it.

Easy recipe, a bit time consuming since I had to cook the chicken all day in the crock pot and then individually wrap each taquito but very good taste over all, I skipped the onion because I had cooked mine chicken with salsa, cumin, and garlic previously then added the green salsa verde, didn't have smoked cheese but used a Mexican shredded blend I had on hand, steamed the corn tortilla and used the flour paste as someone mentioned and didn't even need the toothpicks, no problems holding together before I placed them into the deep-fry basket. Due to the size of my deep fryer I could only do 2 at a time so it was a bit tedious, overall good flavor and nice crunch.  I didn't have the peanut oil but vegetable worked just fine, be careful not to use an easy burning oil like olive they need to cook a good 5 minutes for that nice browned crunch.

Gave 3 stars because the flavor was great.  The corn tortillas are NOT my friend.  these things were hideous when done(my lack of talent when it comes to using the corn tortillas).  I stopped halfway through and just heated the filling then wrapped in warm tortilla like a soft taco.  Very tasty but really hard to use corn tortilla!

I've made this recipe several times, each a little different. I rate this a 4 instead of a 5 because the filling really needs seasoning. I rarely have green salsa on hand, so now, I instead add red salsa (usually homemade) until the chicken/cheese mix is just moist enough. I'll also use Bob's taco seasoning from this site to flavor it up. I broil these at 400 degrees for about 10 minutes, flipping about halfway through. I warm up the corn tortillas before filling and securing with a toothpick. These partially come apart every time, regardless of white or yellow corn tortilla used, but they're still yummy.

Long time user, first time reviewer. I'm giving this only 4 stars because I had to make some changes from the original recipe. I can't have cheese (among other things), so I used a refried bean recipe to replace it, and used the baking tip at 500' for 10 minutes and the tip to microwave the tortillas, but they are DELICOUS!! Thank you so much for helping me add a recipe to my rediculously restricted diet!  I have finally found something that I can  contribute to a "potluck" that everyone will love!

Another recipe that everyone in the family LOVED! These were super easy & delish! I wrapped in warm/steamed tortillas(we prefer flour, so that's what I used) & froze for 2 hrs before deep-frying. Excellent!!

This is a very good taquito recipe. I have been using it for a long time. If I don't feel like cooking chicken I will buy a roasted chicken at the grocery store and shred that up and use it. Yummy! Love the green Salsa blend.

If steaming the tortillas isn't working, here is a suggestion...flash fry the corn tortillas in veggie oil or olive oil (not sure why peanut oil is called for here) before filling and rolling. Fry them one at a time a small skillet for about 8 seconds each just until they start to bubble. This is how I prep them when I fill and roll them for enchilladas too.  They never tear.

This recipe was EXCELLENT! I wrapped tortillas in damp cloth and microwaved for 30 sec first, this really helped. Also, I used green enchilada sauce instead of the green salsa. This added a great flavor. I put them on a bed of spanish rice and topped with sour cream and salsa. We had a family gathering and it was a HUGE hit. Thanks for the great recipe!

Seriously, this recipe is awesome-good! And.. it was awesome-fun, too. My dad, brother, and I have been chatting, chopping, shredding, laughing, mixing, frying, and feasting all night..  And, the flavor exceeded our wildest expectations - I promise, if there were room in our bellies, there would not be taquitos in our fridge. 

Now, as a disclaimer, I must admit that this recipe served as more of a starting point than a blue print. We did use salsa verde, but we opted for queso fresco instead of the cheeses in the recipe, and we added green chiles and spices to the meat mixture. We also substituted crema mexicana for sour cream.

My family and I had a truly amazing time tonight, and we had an even better meal.. I suggest you do the same. :)

These taquitos came out really good and were very crispy!  I used regular salsa instead of the green salsa and they came out delicious!

I've had the same trouble many reviewers have had in regards to the corn tortillas breaking up.  My best luck has been when I've been able to find freshly made corn tortillas.  I'll give the steam bath and oil brushing a try when I do run into tortillas that break - thanks for the ideas!

These were excellent; I used a mexican cheese mix and green tomatilla sauce I'd made for another recipe along with a store bought roasted chicken and they were delicious.  My son is allergic to soy and all the pre-made taquitos have soy in them...so I end up making a lot of stuff from scratch.  These are wonderful and lend themselves to just about any filling you want to use.  I did quickly fry them in some oil so they were more pliable and while messy and more time consuming, it was just the trick to make them stay together and not split.  Will definitely make these again, my husband LOVED them!!!

Very good & easy to make.  I used flour tortillas because that's what I had, steamed them in the microwave for 20 seconds to make rolling easy.  Placed them in a baking pan and sprayed with Pam...baked @ 400 for about 10 minutes. Topped with salsa and fat free sour cream. Still had great taste, just lowered the fat/calories.

I don't give a lot of 5-star ratings, but I really dug these & my husband did too!  My only complaint was that they were difficult to roll.  But when I rolled them quickly & fried them 4 at a time they worked out o.k. Just took a little trial & error.  I did however change the recipe quite a bit.  Here's how I did it:
3 chicken breasts boiled & shredded
1 1/2 cups fiesta blend cheese
2/3 cups thick salsa
1 4 oz. can green chili
2 tbsp. taco seasoning
This is a great addition to our "Mexican Monday" rotation!

this was my worst failure yet from this website's recipes. I tried the steambath for the tortillas, but I just couldn't make them stay. So my husband suggested we use 12" flour tortillas and we made 4 chimichangas out of the recipe instead. They were delicious, needed more cheese though.

Excellent! I was a little afraid to try this recipe as I do not enjoy frying, but they were so great! I used Smart Balance oil in a deep frying pan and put the chicken breasts in the crock pot with a can of chicken broth for about 4 hours. This made it way easier and the chicken was so tender. I found that after you put the chicken filling into the corn tortillas, you have to immediately put them in the frying pan or the corn shells will rip. They stayed nice and crispy, we dipped them in sour cream and ate with black bean and corn quesidillas (from this web site). So yummy! Will add to my Mexican night rotation!

The chicken was a little bland for me.  I will make this again, but I will make sure to use more seasonings.  This is a great recipe to be able to incorporate your own flavors.

These were very tasty and easy to make.  My 9 year old liked them a lot.  Like others, I microwaved the corn tortillas to make them easier to work with.  I found that doing 6 at a time with a damp paper towel made them pliable, then I filled, rolled and fried them immediately.  Several of my first attempts "ripped" while waiting to be fried, so I found it easy to work in small batches and fry them right away.  We'll make this again, but not too often since they're fried.

I couldn't make these fast enough for the family!  It was great that I didn't have to even measure my ingredients.  I simply guessed and it worked out so well.  I had to fry them in a pan and that worked fine.  They were even crunchy the next day.  Wow!!!

These were delicious. Made them for a party and everyone loved them. I had to fry my tortillas a little before rolling added extra time but it kept them from ripping while rolling them. Also added some cumin and onion to the chicken. Used queso fresco cheese. Yummy!

Great taste and really easy.  I cooked 3 chicken breast halves in the slow cooker on high for 4 hrs with just a bit of salsa.  then removed and shredded the meat before mixing it with the salsa verde and just regular cheddar cheese because that is what I had. warmed the corn tortillas in the microwave wrapped in a moist paper towel so they wouldn't break (I did this 3-4 at a time) then rolled them up and fried them 3 at a time.  Really wonderful flavor.

I prepped the corn tortillas by frying them in a pan for five seconds on each side (just until the tortilla starts to bubble). This prevents them from tearing or breaking. Delicious.

Your supposed to warm the tortillas first on the stove untill the soft, then add the chicken mixture and fry, but I find it easier if you put them in the fridge for about 30 mins, I also use geeen enchillada sauce.

I put the corn tortillas in hot oil (I use coconut oil) long enough to get soft enough to roll without falling to pieces, so about 2-3 seconds per side. Set aside until they are cool enough to handle, then fill, roll, and put them seam side down to fry. Didn't fall apart at all, and they were cooked closed. I didn't have any salsa, so I just did cheese and some garlic powder and onion powder and they were gone pretty quickly. I will try them with salsa next. Thank you for a great recipe!

I changed his recipe some. I warmed up the tortillas. As far as the meat, I had some steak that I shredded up and instead of onion I added garlic. I also baked them for abou 6 min.

This recipe is great but you have to use homemade salsa with these.  No jar salsa for this recipe!!!  Also a dollop of sour cream on top is a must.  I was taught how to make these by a Mexican friend and... recipe is perfect but homemade salsa/sour cream are a MUST!!!! The ONLY downfall for me is that they are a little time consuming to make with 4 little ones around the house!!  LOL

Very good! the filling was great! I had some serious issues with frying the taquitos though, it wasn't that the tortillas weren't pliable (i microwaved them first), it's that the oil splattered everywhere, and i was covered in burns! if only there was a better way, maybe i;ll try baking them.

Really Good! When i went to use corn tortillas they just crumbled and let in to much oil.  I then tried flour tortillas and they made a delicious chimichanga!

Not bad.  you should blanch the tortillas in the oil for like 5 seconds first, it makes them easier to roll without cracking.  Corn tortillas are more traditional but you can use flour although the name does change to a flauta then but they are still good.

Very hard to get to stay together!  Also, flavor is slightly lacking.  Will try another cheese next time instead.  Will make again, but with different ingredients!

Being in the UK i found it difficult to find green salasa or green enchilada sauce, plus i didnt have time to make my own so i bought a jar or sliced jalepenos instead and it worked wonders!! Also i couldnt find swiss cheese so went for Leerdamer instead - a dutch cheese!! Everyone loved them....beware of deep frying these babies cos i killed the first one cos the oil was far too hot! I fried half and baked the rest, the fried obviuosly tasted better but the oven ones are just as good for the more health consious....oh an another thing if you cant find peanut oil, use groundnut instead...

Fantastic!! My wife loves taquitos and now she will never eat them out again. I did place the taquitos in the oil with tongs and held on to them for about 3 to 4 seconds, this kept them from hitting the bottom of the pan. So they never got to stick to it. Thanks for the recipe it is a staple in our house now.

I thought these were delicious!  Even my very picky daughter loved them.  Like others, I steamed the tortillas before rolling them.  I also added one chopped orange bell pepper to the filling.  Finally, I baked the taquitos after spreading butter over them.  They turned out really well.  This recipe is a keeper!

I loved these. My husband would have like his spicier so next time I'll spice his up separately. I made only half the corn tortilla then the recipe. I wanted less wraps so I filled them twice as much as the recipe called for. I could only eat one,they were that filling.  I used a rotisserie chicken, made it a fast dinner.
