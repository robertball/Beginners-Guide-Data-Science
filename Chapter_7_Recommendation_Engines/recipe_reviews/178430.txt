This is a great recipe for cabbage lovers -like me.  My prep is alittle different. I use the same ingredients but slice rather than shred and I also throw in a big sliced onion and about a cup of beef stock.  Into the big frying pan it all goes until tender. Finally I dump the pasta in a well I made in the middle of the cabbage and align pieces of the sausage around the pan like spokes on a wagon wheel for presentation. (I fry the sausage first - sometimes I use Keeebassa)

I made this recipe the other night for dinner.  My husband loved it!  I followed the recipe as written except I used a small head of cabbage and added one sliced onion.  I also put in more garlic than called for because we love garlic.  We forgot to put the cheese on top but it was great without it.  This recipe is a keeper.

I leave out the garlic because I can't have it. 15 minutes cook time on the cabbage is too long. You will get a bitter tasting, very pronounced cabbage flavor by cooking it that long. No more than 7 or 8 minutes is plenty.

This was just darn good.  With minimal ingredients the flavor was wonderful.  The only changes I made was to cut down on the butter, added 1 extra clove of garlic and I used macaroni because I didn't have bow tie pasta on hand.  I served it to my husband and a friend neither who like cabbage and my friend asked me to send him the recipe!!!  How cool is that?

This was a very quick and easy meal.  It tasted wonderful!  One of the other reviewers said that you should only cook the cabbage for like 5 minutes.  I ended up cooking my cabbage for probably 15 minutes and I like to still have some crunch to it, so it is all on your preference of how cooked you like your cabbage.  My husband and I loved this and it reheated really well too!  That is an important factor for me because my husband and I both usually pack lunches for the next day.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a very filling meal! Would be great for families trying to stretch their grocery dollars!  I cooked the pasta as stated in the recipe.  However, I made a few changes to the cabbage mixture.  First I cut back the amount of oil & butter by 1/4.  I added 1/2 chopped medium onion to the oil first, then the cabbage, then the garlic. (Chopped not minced).  Then I added the sausage and let the whole mix cook together for about 15 minutes.  Next time I'm thinking of browning the sausage first, then adding all the veggies so that more of the sausage flavor will be in the cabbage.  Overall, very good and VERY filling!

My husband, brother, and I liked this a lot. My normally not-picky kids ate it, but weren't crazy about it. There's definitely way too much butter/oil going on, so it gets a little on the heavy side after a few bites. I added red peppers and vidalia onions to mine to compliment the smoked sausage, which added color and flavor. I would have given it 5 stars if I'd listened to other reviewers and decreased the butter and oil.

My family loves this recipe. It is definitely comfort food. I cut down on the butter and olive oil quite a bit. Last time I added some paprika and it was a great addition. I use lean smoked turkey sausages to cut down on the fat a little.

This is a good tasting recipe except for the fact that it has too much oil and butter that is unnecessary as most other's said.  Way out of proportion to what would be needed.  That's the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5. I halved the recipe and used only about 3 tblps of olive oil, no butter or margarine, used a whole large clove of garlic for the half recipe and added sliced fresh carrots.  It was awesome!  I also added shredded cheddar instead as my husband does not like parmesan.

My low rating is for the dish prepared as published.  It was very greasy and lacked flavor IMO.  However, I made this again with a lot of my own adjustments and LOVED it!  I only used a 1/4C. butter, no olive oil.  I also browned the sausage first with a sliced onion, then removed the sausage and continued to cook the onion with the garlic and cabbage in the sausage grease/butter.  The original recipe just lacked something and I couldn't figure it out really, but I did drizzle the whole thing lightly with soy sauce and BAM, it was delish!  I will be making this again with the adjustments and love that it's very economical!

Oooh this is so good! This was a great recipe to get DD to eat cabbage. I loved the flavor the sauted onion and garlic gave the dish. I also added a couple more spices and left out the parmesan cheese. This is a keeper!

My cabbage-skeptical husband and two young kids asked for seconds!  I made the recipe as written, only substituting a more heart-healthy spread for the butter.  Thanks for sharing a yummy recipe!

Not bad, however.....1/2 cup of butter + 1/4 cup of oil? I don't see that being necessary. I omitted both. I use only 2 table spoons of oil, veggie, and only to cook the sausage in. I guess the oil stuf is to make it saucy. I used 1 can tomatoe soup instead. add a couple tablespoons of water...I really liked it! this is a keeper.

I added a chopped onion and additional garlic. Next time I'll try it with doubling the cabbage and omitting the pasta for a healthier, low-carb dish. (There was a LOT of pasta in this, and I'd prefer more cabbage.)

This is one of my favorite pasta dishes EVER.  Just before draining the pasta, I scoop out 1c of the water and use it to add more "sauce".

I used gluten-free elbow macaroni - this was delicious!  I only used about 2T of olive oil, and 1 T of butter, and still could have gotten away with less.

I loved it but my husband did not, unfortunatly.  I will still make it again for me and my friends.  I did use shredded cababage from the slaw mix at the grocery and it was great.That was the only change

I did as others and cut back on the butter & oil, But I also used brussel sprouts quartered instead of cabbage,chopped mushrooms and added pickled red onions, and crusted red pepper flakes for some heat also. My husband doesn't like brussel sprouts, but this he couldn't get enough of, I will do this again !!

I didn't have smoked sausage so I added 1 package Hebrew National hot dogs, 1 chipotle sausage, and some leftover pork chops and a few slices of leftover lunchmeat. I added an onion and cut the oil and butter in half. I also added some creme fraiche when I eat it. Yummy.

Tasty! But my hubby did comment on the greasiness of it. I'm sure the fact that I added about 5 slices of bacon to the mixture didn't help with the grease factor but it did make it taste yummy. Next time I'll cut the butter in half and add the olive oil after I have tossed everything together. I also added some red pepper flakes which gave it a little kick. I can't believe that I had all of the ingredients needed just laying in my kitchen

A new regular dinner for rotation.  I did as others and added onion and halved oil and butter.  Much much better the next day.  A lot more flavor.  In the future I will make everything but the noodles, the night before.  Then make noodles fresh and mix in, after reheating meat and veggies.

It's good, no doubt, but not superb.  To me, this is a variation on Haluski - cabbage and egg noodles.  It still needed a little something for some kick, even with the smoked sausage.  I added some Cajun spices, some onion and green peppers.  To me, that made this recipe 5 stars.

My husband and I both enjoyed this dish.  I think the next time I make it, I will add a 1/2 pkt of dry Italian dressing mix.  Thank you for the recipe!
Update:
I made it again and this time:
In a skillet slice up sausage in bite size pieces.  Melt 2T of butter and add cabbage, garlic, shredded carrots and a stalk of celery chopped into bite size pieces.  Cook until the vegetables are crisp tender.  If you like your sausage browned, cook it a bit before adding vegetables.

When the pasta is cooked and drain, add 1-2T butter, 3-4T Italian salad dressing (this replaces the olive oil).  Add the skillet content and stir to distribute oils, add the parmesan and stir until well coated.   Enjoy :)

My husband and I both liked this.  It's a very easy recipe.  The only thing I did differently was I pre-heated the sliced sausage in the microwave for about a minute and a half on high before adding it to the pasta/cabbage mixture.

Made it using 1/2 large onion, 3 cloves garlic, 1/2 head small cabbage, 2 links smoked chicken sausage - saute in non-stick skillet with 1 tsp. evoo and 1 tsp. butter.  Had 1/2 C left-over extra wide noodles chopped up. More than enough for 2, a lot fewer calories, and very, very tasty.

This is a great way to use cabbage. Only cook the cabbage for about 5 min. I cooked the sausage first, used skinless smoked sausage, wiped the pan out so did not have to much oil. Used less butter and oil based on previous reviews. used more garlic, and a little more parmesan. It is an easy and yummy recipe!! Will make it again.

I think most of us reading these recipes have been in the kitchen a time or two so we know how to adjust to our personal liking. I used taters instead of pasta. Perfect!

Very sorry, but one half cup of butter is ridiculous.  Look at those calorie and fat gram numbers and know that you can make this with 1-2 teaspoons of butter, or no butter at all, just olive oil.   Also, I use a thinly sliced onion in it, with 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of minced garlic after the onions are sauteed to transparency.   The pasta, in my opinion, is superfluous as all it does is add what most of us do not need, which is more carbs.   When I make this dish I add just a touch of chicken base with a splash of water, perhaps a half teaspoon, then adjust the salt only at the end.  You have enough fat calories in the sausage, which is great to have now and then.   Just my take on what is a comforting dish on any night of the week.

So I changed this up a little.   I used precooked chicken that I had frozen instead of sausage and added a handful of fresh chives from the garden. 

This was amazing!  It smelled pretty bad while cooking and I expected to not like it but me and my husband and all 6 kids loved it and had seconds!!

Just to help the next guy, note the amount of cabbage used, it felt like it was going to be way too much, but after it was all mixed together it was the perfect balance.  

This one made it into the cookbook!

Wow was this good. Made a little different, just used what I had rather than go to the store. Only had linguine so used that. Same with sausage. Only had sweet apple smoked chicken sausage and added some turkey bacon. Will surely try it with some pork sausage. Easy to do and very delicious. Thanks for sharing.

This sounds weird but it was really good. I do not add any oil and I halfed the butter. I used Penne pasta and added some more garlic and red pepper flakes for a little kick.

This has become a family favorite! It is simple to prepare, and tastes great. It is also a good side dish if the sausage is left out.

I love cabbage and smoke sausage together so I had to try this.  It’s very good so I’m glad I did.  The Parmesan cheese is a nice addition of flavor!  The cook time for the cabbage depends on how small you slice or shred your head of cabbage. I will make it again leaving out the oil and adding a sliced onion.  My husband even liked it and he’s not a fan of cabbage!

I love cabbage - my husband and son don't feel the same as I do about it! In fact, when my husband asked what's for dinner and I told him, he asked what he and my son were having! They changed their tune during dinner - they both thought this was very good and went back for seconds. I made some modifications due to lack of ingredients and trying to vegefy (new word?) our meals. I used an egg noodle instead of bowtie pasta, added an onion, carrots and cauliflower. I cut down on the butter. I didn't have any fresh garlic cloves, so I sprinkled garlic powder generously, along with salt and pepper. I sliced the cabbage the same width as the egg noodles and sautéed the veggies together prior to adding the cabbage, sausage and noodles. I'm sure this recipe would be terrific as is, and I'm grateful for the recipe as I would have never thought of the combination of pasta and cabbage. Delicious!

Good recipe. I made a few changes based on recs from others, plus a few of my own. I browned the kielbasa in 2 T butter and removed from pan. I added 2 Tbsp olive oil to pan and sauted 1/2 a small cabbage, sliced, 1 sliced onion, 1 sliced red pepper and added 1/2 tsp caraway seeds. I covered & cooked about 15 min., stirring occasionally. Then I added the sausage and 8 oz. of penne pasta. I sprinkled 2 cups o cheddar over the top and mixed in and served.

I liked it  I think it is a bit greasy and you did not say when to put the sausage in.  I think next time I will remove some of the bacon grease.

I made the receipt with changes . I used green peppers, onions and fried the beef smoked sausage in garlic and old fashioned bacon drippings. I chopped a small head of cabbage .. I used just a pat of butter no oil. I also used medium size egg noodles in place of the  bow tie pasta. My husband loved it. He wants me to make it again . I also used some crushed pepper flakes and used a lot of garlic . It was also great warmed up today for leftovers. I will be making this again.

Surprising great recipe.  Did change recipe to cut calories.  Only used 8 oz. pasta, half of the butter.  Added Soy Sauce as suggested.

Definitely follow the rest of the reviews & add way less butter and olive oil! I’m not a fan of measuring, but I just added oil and butter to my liking and went with that! I added 1/2 cup or so of Beef Stock because I had it on hand and read that tip from another reviewer — GREAT addition!! I’d use the recipe as a base, like many other reviewers and myself have done, and add/subtract to your liking! But I LOVE this pasta because it takes 20 minutes total and is SOOO full of flavour!!

1 oz butter, double the garlic, add a red onion, thinly sliced, slice the cabbage, and cook for only 5-7 minutes.  Wonderful .

- The published recipe seems like it would be unnecessarily greasy. I added about a tablespoon of butter only and it was sufficient.

- Sauteed onion is a good addition.

- The taste of this will depend heavily on the type of sausage you will use -- a nice kliebasa would probably be the best.

- Since I didn't have a good sausage (just used some Italian-style sausage from Trader Joe), I added an extra kick by mixing in kimchi at the end (+ used seven spice seasoning).

Excellent! Per other reviewers I added an onion and only used half the butter-although I’m sure it would have been more delicious had I used the whole stick! I also browned the sausage slices first because we like them that way. Next time I might chop the sausage up into smaller pieces because-when I was dividing it up for leftovers it was harder to make sure each serving had a portion of the sausage.

AS  SOME REVIEWS STATED I ADDED BACON AND ONION. I ADDED A TOUCH OF APPLE JUICE TO THE CABBAGE. THIS IS A KEEPER. NEXT TIME I MAKE THIS I WILL OMIT THE PASTA, (JUST A PERSONAL CHOICE) I ALSO CUT WAY BACK ON THE OIL AND BUTTER.

I liked the recipe and will make it again. The next time I'll use about 1/4 of the oil/butter the recipe calls for. I might even change my recipe and use a cup of beef broth instead of any oil at all.

I gave it a 4/out of 5 only because the recipe is better by making the adjustment noted in the comments.  I used my favorite Louisiana smoked pork sausage which is the key to the whole recipe. The more intense the sausage the better the final recipe.  We moaned as we ate it. We also like cooking the cabbage and sausage longer than indicated; this makes the flavors more intense   Be sure there is always enough liquid to keep it from burning. Once modified, this is a awesome recipe

Delicious but I had to cut the amount of cabbage in half. My 5 quart pan was still filled to the top.

My mother made fried cabbage which my family loves so knew we would like this recipe.  I added a small sliced onion and a diced carrot and everyone agreed this is a "keeper" recipe!

I just made this for dinner as written other than adding some onion & browning the sausage. Preference only. Loved it! I used about 4 skillets/pots to make it in. I didn't have one pot that would hold it all. Then combined in one big skillet at the end. Will definitely share this recipe.

Really loved this.  Great with a nice side of apple sauce to round out the meal.  I added a little bit of Maggi (German Soy Sauce) to enhance the taste.

The recipe didn't specify how many servings and it was way too much for my husband and I!  There was no way I could get everything in the largest frying pan I have!  Also, it didn't say how finely to shred the cabbage and I felt the preparation directions were too vague.  I won't be making it again.

I really liked this, real comfort food. The butter and oil combo makes it especially yummy. Easy to make, too. I think I’ll try turkey sausage next time.

Definitely will make it again.  As other reviewers noted, I cut the butter and olive oil in half, and it was just right.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.  Next time, I’ll add a sliced onion.

Oh.......... YUM!  Made this today with just a couple of changes.
I cut the butter & olive oil amount in half, added 1 large sliced onion, & also added 1 can of beef broth when cooking down the onion & cabbage. 
So quick to make & it's  a huge hit here.  I'm told to be SURE to save this recipe!

This is excellent however to cut some calories I used light margarine and I used turkey smoked sausage instead of the regular smoked sausage.  I love it!!  Wheat pasta could also be used.  I will definitely make this again :-)

I make this all the time, it's a family favorite.  I do not use smoked sausage, I use bacon and omit the oil and butter. I chop the bacon and cook till crisp and remove from the pan and drain on paper towel, I saute an onion along with the cabbage right in the bacon fat, and I use extra wide egg noodles. In my house we call this dish lazy mans pierogies.

Delish.  I used coconut oil instead of butter & vegetable oil, basically for health reasons, and it was great.  Also, browned the sausage first & cooked the cabbage in its yummy sauce for added flavor.

This is really good for keto diets too, of course minus the pasta. As long as you season the cabbage just right and of course melt the cheese perfectly it'll  be perfect!

I made this the other day just because it reminded me of a recipe I used to make when I was first married a thousand years ago, I learned the recipe from my grandmother.  I make my own pasta which gives it a rougher surface that absorbs the butter and oil rather than having it on the bottom of the dish.  I also bought a homemade sausage from a local sausage maker here in Maine, but most importantly (I think is this dish requires that you cut the cabbage a certain way), don't just buy a bag of shredded cabbage, cut fresh in roughly in thick slices.  I used about a teaspoon of fennel seed and skipped the parmesan cheese altogether. It was very much like my grandmother used to make.

Love this recipe! Just made it this evening! I do agree with some previous reviews, I will definitely cut down on the butter and oil next time. Also, I added sliced baby portabella mushrooms! Yum! I can see so many different things you could add to this without changing the heart of this recipe!

Cabbage & Smoked Sausage Pasta Haiku: "Greasy oil slick! I can nom some comfort foods, this was too heavy." Between the butter, oil, grease from the smoked sausage, and the too-many noodles, this humble, inexpensive and easy-to-prepare dish became a stomach bomb. I love the way butter transforms cabbage and pasta (particularly egg noodles) but this recipe just turned made all of the ingredients way too slippery. I'd make it again with ample adjustments and reductions in the butter and oil and pasta, probably swapping bow tie for egg noodles as well because I like how their shape mimics that of chopped cabbage. (Fool the kids, I guess.)

I tried this recipe to use some of the cabbage from the garden.  I backed off a little on the olive oil and because I was using things I had in the kitchen I used tricolor rotini which added a little color to the dish.  I cooked three brats in beer and sliced those and used 5 cloves of garlic.  My wife and I both enjoyed this meal and I will definitely try it again.  I might try some onion as other reviewers did.

Loved it!  I only altered a couple of things,  and it was my 1st time making it.  I added 1 chopped onion and some parsley to the butter, olive oil, butter and cabbage(I used 1 &1/2 bags of shredded)mixture.   Also increased butter by 1/4 cup and double garlic.    And because 1 lb of pasta sounded like alot,  I included 2 packs of 12oz. Smoked sausage instead of the 1 pound.

Very yummy!  The only things different I did was I used egg noodles in place of the bow tie pasta, and I used a coleslaw mix for the cabbage to save time on the cutting up and shredding.  Will certainly make again!

this came out bland, unfortunately.. i cut the recipe in half.. subbed chicken broth for the butter and bacon grease for the olive oil.. i, like another reviewer, guess the grease is supposed to be the sauce? i'm not sure.. i ended up adding a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup and seasoned it up with some dry ranch dressing mix.. i'm trying to think if this is supposed to be like buttered noodles.. and if that's the case i probably shouldn't have chosen this recipe as it's not really our type of dish

We browned the sausage, then removed from the pan and cooked the cabbage in the drippings and olive oil, until it started to brown before adding the garlic and cooking for a couple minutes.  Mixed in the cooked sausage, 1T butter and pasta, then topped with the parmesan just before serving.  Made this way, we loved it.
The recipe as written seems like it would be terribly greasy.

I pretty much followed this recipe as written, except I used fresh Polish sausage instead of the smoked. I had some shell pasta and used that which incidentally turned out awesome! One thing...I boiled the Polish and ten minutes before that was done I tossed the shells in the same pot...

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and found it too greasy and also pretty bland.  With the leftovers, I added onion, more garlic, a few more seasonings and a can of chicken broth.  I think I needed that broth to counteract that greasy taste. I may make it again, but will definitely have to cut way back on the butter and oil and add some additional flavoring.  The doctored leftovers were probably worth 4 stars.

This is the first recipe I have wanted to review. My family loved it...even my very picky 10 year old who doesn't like her food mixed. I took some of the pasta and set aside for her along with the cabbage and sausage. Once served she did something my husband and I have never seen her do, she mixed it all together and ate all of it. Not sure if it's cause she helped make it but I was impressed. We did only use 1/2 cup of butter and omitted the oil. We added a half a onion and smoked paprika. We also used smoked venison sausage.

My family and I really enjoyed this recipe. I omitted the olive oil and added butter and a lot more Parmesan cheese. Not necessarily healthier but definitely tastier!

This has become a staple recipe in our house. Both my husband and I weren't very fond of cabbage, but this recipe has changed our opinion! I have altered the recipe to our liking. I saute the garlic with the sausage(any kind I have on hand works!),sliced onions, and carrots. Once the carrots start softening, I add the sliced cabbage, salt, pepper and a cup of beef broth. I let that simmer until the cabbage is to our liking, then I add the pasta and some Parmesan cheese. Plated, add a sprinkle of cheese on top with some crusty bread... DELICIOUS! My three boys gobble it up!

I made this tonight.  I would give it 5 stars, but I changed the recipe some.  I don't usually leave reviews if I've changed the recipe, but my daughter LOVED this so I had to leave a review because she can be somewhat picky.  I only used about 3/4 of a large head of cabbage.  I omitted the butter because of my sons allergies and we topped it with mozzarella on our dishes.  I added a small onion and about half of a tomato simply to use up some veggies I had.  My husband and I felt like it still needed something (perhaps the butter and parmesan would've taken care of this).  My 5 year old daughter originally turned her nose up at the sight of this but then ate 3 large helpings and declared I should make this again!  I think next time I will try to use butter and parmesan and feed my son something else. I may also add paprika like another reviewer suggested.

I wasn't thrilled with it, it was bland. If I would remake this I would definitely only use 1/2 the box of pasta or double the sausage and cabbage.  I also only used only evoo, no butter, and added paprika and some onion.

Good recipe, but the reviews are right.  Don't use the amount of oil and butter called for.  I used 1/3 stick of butter and it was still too much.  Otherwise, fast and easy.

I also cut the butter & oil in half and added onion as suggested by previous posters. I also saved 1 cup of pasta water as suggested. I am thankful that I did, as the cabbage was still a bit too "crunchy" for the kiddos even after the full 15 minutes..can't imagine what it would have been without it! Red pepper flakes were a nice touch as was yellow mustard..Would have also done less pasta. Will make again.

This recipe was pretty plain.  Not enough flavor for as much cabbage as it calls for.  Had to add about three times as much meat. Won't make again.

This was very good and easy to make. I did use Chicken/Roasted Red pepper sausage instead tho and added a bit of cream. I used the sausage because it was what I had on hand. The cream just made it have a creamier texture. :) It worked out very well and my husband agreed I could make it again. Leftovers will be eaten up . Yay

I added about 6 oz. of Velvetta cheese also. That made it good. And left out the parmesan cheese.

Quick, easy and oh so delicious.  This is now a favorite in our house and will be making again for sure.
