oh boy, these are really good. It is really important to reach hard crack stage with these candies. To test for hard crack stage without a candy thermometer, use the ice water method. Have nearby a bowl of ice water. Periodically test the syrup to see if it has reached hard crack. To do this, drizzle a small amount of syrup off of a spoon into the cold water. When it has reached hard crack stage, it will form treads in the water. When you take the threads out of the water, they will be hard and brittle. If they are still soft and pliable, or if it forms a ball instead of threads, keep cooking and checking until you get hard, brittle threads.

If you dont cook to the hard-crack stage, you will end up with sticky "caramel" on the popcorn. At the hard-crack stage, it becomes crispy when completely cooled. When you bite off a piece from the ball it is like caramel corn. As the mixture was cooling, I added some red hots to give it a Christmas theme look. Another tip is to put each hand into a plastic sandwich baggy's and mold the popcorn into balls with these on. That way the warm caramel wont stick to your hands. These are sweet caramel corn tasting popcorn balls. Very delicious. If you dont like them sweet, you add the vinegar to tone it down. I used my hot air popcorn popper to pop 1/2 cup kernals.

These popcorn balls taste just like a gourmet popcorn shop from back home.  They really taste rich and buttery!  We must have popped too much corn, because ours weren't covered as much as the photo.  Does anyone know how many cups of unpopped kernels makes 5 quarts popped?

Kids of ALL AGES love these popcorn balls.  Don't be thrown by the 1/2 cup of popcorn, that is the measurement for unpopped corn.  Makes just the right amount!

These are absolutely the best! Just make sure you
reach "hard crack" stage when doing the syrup. I
did go to 300 deg. on my thermometer, but it wasn't quite hard crack and these wouldn't come
off my teeth and I had to toss. However, the next
batch turned out YUMMY and were perfect. I used about 3 tsp. of salt on the popcorn - seems like alot but you need to make them salt/sweet like the old fashioned kind. FABULOUS!

I think your grandpa and my 92 year old grandma knew each other.  She makes these every Christmas, two separate batches, one with green food color, and the other red.  My 46 year old husband and 39 year old sister fight like kids over them every year!

We loved this recipe.  I made a few batches for my preschooler to take to his Halloween party.  We wrapped them in cellophane and tied them up with green pipe cleaners.  I then attatched a green tag cut like a leaf saying Happy Halloween from my son.  Next we curled up the pipe cleaners on a pencil to resemble a vine.  Finally, we took a sharpie marker and made a jack-o-lantern face.  These were so fun!!!!!

Thank you for sharing your Grandfather`s recipe.  I made two batches this evening and they turned out great.  I decided to add food coloring to mine(red and green for Christmas)at the same time I added the vanilla extract.

What a perfect popcorn ball.  Be patient with the syrup, candy making can be tedious but so worth the results.  I might experiment and add a tad more butter for more richness.  Super, super, super

A couple of hints. POPCORN: Pop it first and keep the correct amount in large bowl in a warm oven. Get the bowl hot as well.   CARAMEL (1) stir sugar/butter mixture constantly over medium high heat until it begins to foam. Once foaming, leave it alone except for the occasional slow stir.    (2) it needs to boil several minutes longer than you think.. the caramel will look ready, but if it hasn't reached the proper stage, it will turn to fudge instead of candy when it cools.   (3) once it has reached the stage you are after (I like taffy stage) remove from heat, add vanilla ans stir slowly.   (4) This is NOT THE TIME for KIDS to help. The hot caramel is extremely dangerous and will burn to the bone -- pour mixture onto the popcorn. Mix with two long handled wooden spoons. Be careful to not get your hands into the hot caramel.   (5) Let the popcorn cool to the point where you can handle it with bare hands. Cover your hands with butter and begin forming balls. (This is where kids can safely help, just be sure they wash their hands first!).   (6) You will need at least one helper in order to get all the popcorn formed into balls before they harden.

Delicious! Before I made this recipe I tried the Best Ever Popcorn Ball recipe posted on this site (because it was well reviewed and seemed faster), but ended up throwing them out - they just tasted like confectioners sugar. It is worth the extra time to boil the sugar to hard crack stage. These turned out crispy and light. I used both the vanilla and the vinegar. For the popcorn, I popped 1 cup of popcorn seeds, but ended up only using about 2/3 or 3/4 of the popcorn. To help shape them I started with buttered muffin tins. I scooped out the popcorn using a buttered 1/2 cup dry measure and pressed them into the muffin tins. After I had all the tins full, I reshaped the popcorn into rounder balls using my greased hands. This seemed to work well - it allowed me to portion out the popcorn while it was hot, and work them by hand before they got too cool to press into shape.

I am sure these are great and would love some advise. The first 2 or 3 minutes in the bowl, it all started to harden and I could not get it up into a ball. It was hard as a rock. I started making them into balls right away and only got a few done before it all stuck together and got hard. What did I do wrong?

These were the hit of the Halloween party! My husband said they were the best popcorn balls he has ever had. Tip for beginners: any time you cook sugar, use a pot that is much much larger than what you may think you need. It will bubble up and boiling sugar is not fun to scrape off of a stovetop and could cause serious injury to your hands. I learned this the hard way making jelly for the first time. You could also make these caramel popcorn balls by substituting 1c of the white sugar for 1c of brown. It takes 4 regular sized bags of microwave popcorn to make 5 quarts.

I made this recipe with some small changes and additions for a Christmas bake sale taking place today.  

First, I only took the sugar mixture up to 275 degrees since kids will be eating them and I didn't want to rip out everyone's baby teeth.  This worked fine--the balls are crunchy and a little chewy, but not very sticky (since I have to package them up).  The samples I tasted were excellent--buttery and sweet.

Then after I mixed the syrup into the popcorn I sprayed my hands with Pam and started working with the popcorn on the edges immediately since it was the coolest. I formed the balls around pretzel dipping sticks to give a handle to the ball.  I was just finishing the 18th ball as the mixture was getting too stiff to form around the pretzel.

Finally, I drizzled melted chocolate chips and caramel onto the balls for a fancier looking treat and put them into foil cupcake holders.

They are individually wrapped in clear plastic treat bags with red and green ribbons, waiting to head off to the sale this afternoon.  Very pretty!

These are great, not too sweet cuz i love sweet.  These were easy i did not have a candy thermometer so i did as the poster said with the waterbath.  Also to anyone that wants to know how much popcorn is needed to make 5 quarts you will need to measure your kernals right in between 2/3 and 1 cup on a measuring cup. (4 quarts is 2/3 cup and 6 quarts is 1 cup)

For those that like less sweet popcorn balls:  omit the vanilla and the vinegar.  add an extra 4-6 cups of popcorn to the 5 quart (20 cup) recipe.  This worked fantastic for us!    I did NOT use a thermomater for these... you need to reach hard crack WITHOUT over cooking, and sometimes the thermometer is not as effective as dropping into a cold glass of water.  when it comes to a frothing boil to see where you are... if you can push it around into a ball but its still squishy its soft ball... if you can push it into a ball and it then gets hard its hard ball... and if you push it into a ball and it then crackles up or you can't quick get it into a ball before it crackles up its PERFECT.  Mine did NOT turn brown before it reached this stage and in my skilled took only 5-10 minutes.  They formed nice firm balls without breaking your teeth.  I cooked in very large  cast iron skillet with tall 4 1/2" sides.

DON'T go for hard crack stage on the caramel sauce  if you like CHEWY popcorn balls! The first two batches I made I waited for hard crack stage and the popcorn/caramel was terribly hard to mix and turned to hard candy right away. The balls did form nicely but when we went to eat them, we could only eat 1/2 before the caramel stuck to our teeth in a death grip/filling wrenching way. No one ate more than 1/2 ball. The next batch I made I cooked the caramel to between soft and firm ball stage(240 F): the popcorn and caramel mixed well, the balls are nice and chewy though forming the balls was a bit tougher but with a little work and buttering your hands, you'll be fine.

Perfect! Just what I was looking for. My Pyrex measuring cup has multiple measurements and according to it, 5 quarts equals 20 cups and that amount was perfect. I didn't wait to start forming, used all the mix and got 35 balls. Thanks.

This recipe was awesome and so easy.  I was craving caramel popcorn one evening and decided to make these.  I used brown sugar instead of white and omitted the vinegar.  I also used microwave popcorn, a 3.5 bag makes 10.5 cups of popped corn so I popped 2 bags. I also did not feel like making balls so I buttered a 9x13 pan, spread out my popped corn and just poured the syrup over the corn. I also used a candy thermometer in combination with the ice water test because at hard  ball stage the syrup still was not hard enough.  Will definitely keep this for future use!!! Yum yum!!

AWEsome recipe!!  I've made these to share at potlucks & people loved them!  My variation was that I rolled them as mini balls, to be better served in a potluck-type setting, with so many other foods.

One note from my personal experience, which may be a no-brainer for most, but not for me. :)  These were so great while they were still warm, that I tried to rewarm the entire batch before taking them to the first potluck.  DO NOT REWARM.  This resulted in very chewy balls that, while delicious, were a hassle to eat.  I took them cold to the second potluck and they were a hit!

These are always excellent!!!  I use 3 bags of microwave popcorn and wait just long enough after completely the cooking process for the sugar to cool enough to keep from burning and they roll up perfectly well.  I do NOT wait until the hard crack stage, as I wanted popcorn balls which are not difficult to eat.  

Another thing... I do not cook past the soft butter yellow coloring...once it starts to turn clear, then beginning browning, it's well past the point of it staying soft for popcorn balls. 

Everyone loves, loves, LOVES this recipe.  :o)

i was worried because they looked a little darker in the photo, but they turned out great!  using plastic bags on my hands instead of buttering them worked very well.  I also recommend forming them into balls as quickly as possible.  They were much more pliable, were able to be smushed together, and held their form.  I took them to a Halloween party and they were a huge success!  I used non-dairy margarine in place of the butter with no problems.  Unpopped, I used 1 cup of corn kernels, but could probably have done another quarter of a cup with the amount of syrup I had.

This has a very good taste, I had some trouble making the balls and so I will try again, recommend having someone stirring while you are pouring, to get it to mix correctly or it will go to the bottom.

These were a cinch to make.  I don't see how anyone had problems??  I used a large le creuset pot to pop the corn then stirred in the candy mix using the popping pot as it was greased already.  You absolutely have to wait until the candy gets to hard crack, this WILL take a half hour or so.  Also, if it is humid outside don't bother. Humidity in the air keeps the moisture level too high for the sugar to reach hard crack stage.  Sugar gets hotter as the moisture evaporates, when it is humid in the air this wont happen, or happen properly.  That could be the problem for some.  You really do need a candy thermometer to be successful with these.  Also, please wait about a half an hour before eating and they shouldn't stick in your teeth, they take a bit of time to harden.

great recipe! I wanted a sweeter popcorn ball so I left off the vinegar. I had a problem with my brand new candy thermometer... even with a gas stove I couldnt get it to read past 250!! so I quickly googled hard crack stage and found if you drop a bit of the mixture in cold water... wait for it to cool.. and if it's hard and cracks ... it's at the hard crack stage.  Why did I go buy a candy thermometer for this?... it was at hard crack stage the first time I checked it.

My kids wanted popcorn balls that they saw the the store, so I decided to make them while they were at school.

  I made them when the caramel was still a little soft, they seemed to stick together very well.  I did not have enough corn syrup to make them so I found a substiution for it... for 1 cup of corn syrup use 1/4 Cup water and 1 Cup sugar.

  They loved them, especially my picky one who doesn't like popcorn.  Now I have to make them for  his Halloween party at school.

These turned out great!  Good thing I tested to see if it was ready using the ice water method because my candy thermometer turned out to be broken.  Everyone loves them!

Just made today.I tasted the syrup with a piece of popcorn early on. Was so excited about the old fashioned flavor. Unfortunately,recipe has you add vanilla at the end..that totally changed the flavor to a likeness of Cracker Jacks. Bummer.Perhaps adding vinegar would have mellowed it out.(I didn't have any)Be very careful while handling the hot syrup as some got on my thumb giving me a blister. It is hard to incorporate syrup to all pieces of popcorn,but mine held together for most of it. I popped 2 bags of micro popcorn,was just the right amount.I put the loose popcorn stragglers in a baggie as kettle corn.Thank your Grandpa for sharing :)

This is a great recipe. My father and I use an air popper, and pop plain popcorn kernels. We use our sink to pop all of the pop corn into, and then we pour the sugar over it while it's in the sink. It's important butter (or spray Pam) onto any surface you're going to be making the popcorn balls in. I like to have a bowl of ice water handy to dip my hands into while I'm making the popcorn balls so that the sugar doesn't burn me too badly. But when you're working with hot sugar, it's pretty much inevitable. And just for reference, don't quadruple the recipe. We tried that, and we had to use our very biggest pot, and it took FOREVER to get it to 300 degrees. And also make sure all the popcorn gets coated in the sugar, or pieces will be falling of everywhere. I love this recipe! It tastes great!

I made these for favors at a baby shower (along with Gourmet Caramel Apples) so to make them a little more festive I colored the caramel pink with food coloring gel.  They were really cute.  I don't recommend letting them sit for 5 minutes as I had a hard time getting the last few balls to hold together because it had gotten too cool.  Work fast!!  I got 12 balls.

Wonderful popcorn balls.  If you want easy clean up, mix the popcorn and candy in a metal bowl. When you are all done fill the bowl with hot water and boil it on the stove.  It dissolves all the candy.  You can do the same with the pot.  Enjoy them I know we did!

Wow! What a nice treat! The recipe was so easy and they taste just perfect. Remeber the ones you'd eat when you were a kid ? Well, these are them. I used leftover microwave popcorn (10 cups), cut the recipe in half (easier to work with), added salt ( a must), vanilla and NOT the vinegar.

Thank you and we will use this recipe for years!

The flavor of these is quite nice, however, I would reduce the cooking stage a bit if you are wanting softer popcorn balls.  I got something more like candy popcorn, sort of Poppycock or Crunch in munch, without the nuts.  It was still delicious, though!  You may want to try this recipe a few times, as the firmness of a popcorn ball is a personal preference.

The flavor was good, but these were so hard (followed directions of cooking to hard crack) that they can break your teeth!  We had to throw them out.

The taste is amazing, I used vinegar in it so it was more like kettle corn that caramel corn. HOWEVER the recipe never specified where to place the popcorn when you pour the sugar on it. I used the bowl I popped the corn in. BIG HARD MESS! I had to throw out 75% of it because it all stuck to the bowl. I am going to try it again because I want to master this classic snack, and I am going to put the corn on the cookie sheet I will place the balls on to cool that has been lined with a piece of parchment.

I also got a tip from my Gramma, who used to make popcorn balls every year, butter your hands before shaping the balls.

These were delicious! People said they tasted like cake. It was easy to figure out hard crack stage using the water method, dribbling some of the sugar mix into ice water and waiting until it instantly hardened. It took about 20-30 minutes though. It was hard to spread the mix over the popcorn. I used four bags. It kept collecting in one place and sticking to the bowl. The second batch I greased the bowl, and whatever wouldn't stick well enough for balls, I tossed some salt on and called kettle corn. Also, for VEGANS I used soy butter and it worked fine.

Excellent recipe.  I scorched the first batch by letting it go a hair past hard crack.  I tried it again and added the vanilla and vinegar a second before the thermometer reached 300.  PERFECT.  

We used two spoons to mix the caramel with popcorn (we used about a cup and a quarter of corn in a hot air popper).  Make sure all un-popped kernels are removed before adding the caramel.

We buttered our hands to before shaping them into balls.  

The kids at the party LOVED them and many came back for seconds!  We will definitely make again.

As other reviewers noted, the temperature is way too high. I used a candy thermometer and at 300 the syrup was very dark and burned. The balls are a bit too hard and have a smoky, burned flavor to them. I'll try a lower temperature next time. That said, this recipe definitely has potential.

A nice recipe, but something was lacking a little in the flavor for me.  Perhaps next time I'll use brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I used about 1 1/4 cup unpopped popcorn to get 5 quarts of popped.  I also greased my hands with butter prior to shaping the balls...this seemed to help a lot.  After shaping the balls, I placed them on waxed paper so they wouldn't stick.  I got about twenty 3-inch balls in the end.  Will probably be making these again ~ kids love'em!

Super easy and delicious; I had a hard time getting the balls to stay together so I'm not sure if it was something I did or if the recipe directions were lacking. It was my first attempt and I'll definitely try them again.

Delish! I didn't have light corn syrup so substituted pancake syrup which is mostly corn syrup anyway. It seemed to take quite a while to get to hard-crack stage - 8-10 minutes (I'm at 7000 ft of altitude so maybe that makes a differenece.) As another reviewer mentioned be careful when mixing into the popcorn. The syrup will give a nasty burn as it is supposed to stick and harden and is well past boiling temp. Instead of making into balls I just spread out in a single layer as 'caramel' corn.

These were absolutely wonderful. They tasted like crunch and munch without the nuts. The one bad thing is that I was making them with my 5 year old niece and they were way too hot for her to form into balls. They were also very very hard for her to eat. We ended up smashing up the balls into pieces which worked out very well. Delicioud recipe though and I will definitely make them again.

Took a LONG time to get to the "hard crack" stage, but having reached it eventually, the end result is correct (crunchy balls with a little chew left in the finish). Recipe says "salt to taste". I followed the 3 tsp recommendation of another reviewer and found them WAAAAAAY too salty - and I LIKE sweet-salty combos!!!  Now I have a batch of (to me) barely edible balls. I even tried to dust them with sugar to even out the salty edge.  My 4 yr old doesn't even care for them.  I think my 16 year old and his budz will find a way to mow through them, however.  Next batch = WAAAY less salt! BTW, the I made 2 batches of 1/2 cup uncooked popcorn (1cup total), and could have used more popped corn. I lost some syrup to boil over, and still had more syrup-to-popcorn ratio than I would have preferred. Depends how candy covered you like your popcorn.  Next time I think I'll do two 3/4 cup (unpopped) batches.  May take some experimentation to balance the flavor and ratios "to taste".

AWESOME!  This reminds me of eating crunch n munch butter toffee flavored popcorn.  I used 1 bag of butter microwave popcorn and achieved the perfect balance of sweet and salty and butter taste.  I ate more than my kids!

I did half brown sugar instead of all white sugar to give it a caramel flavor/look and it was great. I also did not use the vinegar. Loved it.

Very good...I just finished making them, and I am eating the first one. I wasnt sure about the 'vanilla OR vinegar' thing, so I added both....very tasty, and it ended up making 18 3" balls....

I liked these a lot, made tonight. I guess my mother never cooked the syrup and sugar as long as this recipe calls for.  

When the balls cooled they were so hard. I guess some like it this way, I just preferred them more chewy.

Next time I will take the syrup off the stove before it gets to that hard point.

Very yummy, though quite sweet. I wish I knew how to make it the same flavor but not quite as sweet... I've also used this recipe with brown sugar in place of white, and it makes for delicious caramel balls.

These were sooooo good. I used vanilla, but want to try it with the vinegar. I thought they tasted better the next day. Some reviews said the popcorn mixture stuck to the bowl. I sprayed the bowl with pam spray before putting the popcorn in it. The popcorn mixture did not stick to the bowl.

We've been making these for years in our family and we love them. Now that we're older we have to be careful with not losing our crowns when eating them. After popping, shake the popcorn and all the hulls and seeds will go to the bottom, then avoid the popcorn on the bottom. One other tip, we rub a "little" Crisco or shortening on our hands when forming the balls. The popcorn is still hot to hold but much quicker and doesn't stick with the shortening on our hands.

This recipe was a disaster. The sticky stuff gets too hard too fast, and its so sticky that you'll think you're fillings are being ripped out.  I'd recommend using something with a marshmellow base for an easier to work with consistency. Sorry gramps!

My wife made a couple of batches while I assisted.  They were a bit sticky since we did not have a thermometer, but using the ice water test, it helped quite a bit.  She ate most of them, but I snuck a couple in =).  Very tasty!

A great tasting and easy popcorn ball, I used 4 bags of buttered popcorn and 1 stick of butter and this turned out great,I didn't use the vinegar, and I cook the mixture to the 250 degrees that other readers suggested. Thanks for sharing your Grandpa recipe. I will be using this recipe all the time.

The flavor of the "syrup mixture" on these is fantastic!! I just think I cooked it TOO LONG and they were toothbusters (haha). But the flavor was GREAT!! I'm going to try it again and not cook the mixture so long on the stove. (No candy thermometer).... THANK YOU for sharing this recipe!!!

This was not easy at all. I did everything and the popcorn would not stick together. It did not even look like a glaze anymore after pooring. It got like hard clumps of dry sugar after cooling. I tried to do it when it was still hot and it was burning my hands. Popcorn gone to waste.

i have tried this 3 times and each time once the sugar mixture hardens it turns into a sugary mess. the taste when its hot is to die for. if you are a newer cook like me and have a difficulty with hard/soft boil stages i would recommend trying this recipe prior to when you want to serve them. as they have proven non dependable on 3 occasions for me.

There is nothing wrong with the recipe. It's fine, but these are a pain in the butt to make. It's messy. You have to burn your hands in order to form the balls while it's still pliable, and meanwhile the hulls are stabbing your palms. I think the syrup coated the popcorn a little too thickly, so next time I would use more popcorn and stir more thoroughly to coat better. They were yummy, but I think I'll stick to caramel corn instead.

I made these for halloween this year and they were very good. not enough candy for all popcorn, so I made an extra batch and colored it blood red and pored over the balls I already had balled up for a bloody effect and poured the rest into the corn w/ no candy. Good.  the second batch I added salt and more vanilla and to me it tasted like worthers original candy(my fav) so I'm gonna try again just for candy

This was very sweet.  I had a hard time figuring out how much 5 quarts of popcorn was unpopped.  (I didn't have microwave popcorn, so I couldn't use others' reviews of how much.)  I found one person had said that they used 1/2 cup of kernals, so that is what I used.  I didn't have near enough popcorn.  Next time I make it I will try at least 1 cup un-popped kernals.

I have used the butter microwave popcorn about 5 bags. It is best if you put the popcorn in the micowave until the popcorn kernels pop until there is a 1-2-3 second delay of popping time space of time and take it out.  I've made these many times and they are the best you can get. I use rubber gloves but I also butter the gloves and the spoon with a little butter. Not so sticky,and it works for me. They are worth it!

This is the best popcorn ball recipe I've ever tried!! Be sure to cook sugar/syrup mixture until it reaches 300 degrees. If not, the sugar will be chewy and stick in your teeth.

This recipe is really quite easy and makes the most delicious popcorn balls.  I did as another reviewer suggested and boiled the mixture to a temperature of just above 250 degrees.  The result is a nice chewy, vanilla caramel texture.  They held together very well right away and didn't crumble apart as some have that I have tried.  I will definitely use this recipe again!

These were absolutely delicious !!!!  And I assume the entire family thought so as well since I made a HUGE container full at Christmas and everytime I walked into the kitchen I noticed the popcorn balls kept disappearing.   Worthy to note is the fact that they were on a level too high for the grandchildren to reach on their own so, unless there's a ghost in the house, I would have to assume that my grown children and their spouses were the chief suspects!!!!!!!!!

These came out o.k.  but my problem was that the balls didn't get evenly enough coated with the glaze.  Someone suggested to use 5 bags of popcorn & that was too much.  I'd start with 3 bags & add 4 if it needs more.  Also, the balls set up so fast that I would highly recommend having another person helping shape balls because the time before set-up is so limited.  I took another persons suggestion & shaped them in the sink which worked great.  I also took another persons suggestion & made jack-o-lanterns out of them by adding orange food coloring, tying them with green pipecleaners, an drawing faces on the wrappers.  They were cute, but a little tough to draw faces because of the bumpiness.  Finally, i didn't have a candy thermometer, so I used ANOTHER persons suggestion & used the ice water method to test the glaze and that worked greaT!!!!

I made these yesturday and this morning have had 4 for breakfast!  I wanted a more carmely popcorn ball but these are really addictive,chewy and good!  I used 4 bags of microwave popcorn and the liquid covered just perfectly and coated great.  I followed recipe exact and I would give these 5 but the amount this makes just has to be off.  I ended up with 30 huge size popcorn balls.  10 would have been more like it since the kids thought they were too sticky to eat except my 2 year old and I'm eating them like crazy.  I'd make again but I would definately 1/2 the recipe or wait to take to some event not just for 4 boys.

These are wonderful and easy to make. If the popcorn balls didn't stick together or were mushy as some of you are saying,maybe the sugar mixture wasn't up to the right temperature. They turned out perfectly for us.

We love this recipe but could somebody please change the law that says, "As soon as it's about to hit hard crack stage, you'll turn your back!" It still works out when you go a little higher, but I burn my hands trying to get them shaped before they harden!

This recipe was very easy to make with delicious results!  I did have to get my husband to help roll the balls before they cooled and got too hard.  I found that older children loved them but the little ones did not like how the popcorn stuck to their teeth (like glue!).

Great recipe!  But you have to get the temp up to 300.  To avoid those burnt fingertips use a large spoon to portion your balls immediately.  You can then wait a minute or so to press them together.

Fabulous recipe!  It worked perfectly for me.  The only thing that is off is how many popcorn balls the recipe says it makes.  It claims to make 10 3in balls, but my son and I got 24.  I'm pleased!

Great taste.  I cooked until the hard crack stage 300 degree F.  I had to start forming the balls about one minute after mixing.  Turned out great! FYI: 1/2 cup of unpopped corn = 5 qts. of popped corn.

I wish I could give this recipe more than 5 stars.  Excellent!  I grew up making crispy crunchy popcorn balls with my mom and detest the chewy caramel type.  Mom never used butter in hers, the glaze was clear.  

That being said, these are FABULOUS!  I just made a batch that are cooling on the counter and they turned out perfectly and taste terrific!  I will make these again and again!  Thanks!  (As a side note, I did add the vinegar before I started cooking it, AND added the vanilla when it reached the hard crack stage).

I made smaller popcorn balls; consequently, I got about fourteen. To arrive at five quarts of popcorn, I used 3/4 cup of unpopped corn and 3 tablespoons of oil. These popcorn balls are just as I remembered as a child. They were fantastic. Caution: Use rubber gloves to form the balls or you will burn your hands.

I'm not sure what happened, even though I used a candy thermometer they came out too chewy.  The flavor was delicious though!

Wow. These are so good!!! I never had a popcorn ball before and I now love them! I followed the recipe exactly, added both vanilla and vinegar. Salted my popcorn well and heated the candy to hard crack. YUM YUM YUM. My husband is nuts over them too!! I will be making these over and over again!

I couldn't believe how easy and fun these were to make. I think these may become a tradition with my family. The kids really enjoyed making and shaping the balls. I put a little twist to them, I split the popcorn and did half with honey roasted peanuts.

I cut the recipe in half and only used one bag of microwave popcorn, however the popcorn seemed to be too weighed down by the mixture and would not stay as balls. They kept collapsing and were really hard to make, very messy!!!!

One thing just made another batch i used 2-1/2 bags of microwave popcorn this time but after reading the reviews some asked how many cups is 5 qts. i would  say 12 but the way i measured it was using my kool-aid pitcher and i used 2 1/2 of those since i know it is 2 qts. and i made roughly 14 balls each time. The bag of popcorn each bag was 5 cups popped popcorn.

I did recipe as directed,  I think there is a typo error with the temperature.  I have a candy thermometer and let it go to the 300 hard crack as directed.  The mixture is burnt and taste terrible.   I would stay with the 250 at hard ball.  As I have seen in other popcorn recipes on this site.  (When the mixture was at the temp of hard ball it looked great).

I saw your review of the popcorn balls.  The problem is you didn't cook the candy long enough.  Sugar will become liquid as the temperature rises.  Ideally you need a candy thermometer to follow the recipe.  If you don't have a candy or meat thermometer, boil it around 10 minutes and you should be close.

Followed the recipe as printed, except I omitted the vinegar.
What a MESS!  First, caramel sauce was too hard,  (although I stirred constantly with wire whisk and even used 2 different candy thermometers.) I then repeated the caramel sauce and took off heat at 250.  Even played with it to put it in and out of microwave oven in order to make it "spreadable" on all the popcorn.  Never could get it make into a ball form.  Will NOT WASTE my time, effort, energy with resultant frustration with this recipe again.  In search of easier and foolproof recipe.  Would give it a zero if I could.  Never have had such a bad experience/recipe as this one from my favorite recipe site.

I was looking for the old fashioned popcorn ball recipe from my past, clear,sweet, crunchy & wonderful. This is even better, I think because of the butter, probably without the butter, it would be the same taste. It's amazing reading reviews how many different ways people like their popcorn balls, whenever I try a new recipe on this site, I try to read the reviews first, to give me some prior insight on others experiences. Thank you for a wonderful recipe & happy holidays.

Loved the old fashioned taste . I  was forced to tweak this recipe ad  i only had 3/4 cup of corn syrup  so I added  a 1/4 cup of honey  and and extra tsp of vinegar . and added still yet another tsp vinegar  with tsp vanilla  after removing from heat .   I love the old fashioned vinegar honey taste . you must pour this  mixture in a thin stream only tour popcorn . using  ladle helps  stirring  after  every few scoops   to thinly coat  all the corn. . Some people  just  mix in and have a hardened mess.

I made this vegan! Replaced butter with vegan butter.  Very good. The first time I omitted salt and vinegar. The second time added 3/4 tsp salt and used vinegar. I prefer the second way. I also use half the vanilla. Perfect!

I had a terrible time with this recipe. Cooking it to the hard crack is a disaster. It gets way to hard on the corn and hardened to the bottom of the pan before I could even make the balls. A lot of work to have to throw it all away. I could not find my usual recipe so thought I would try this one  big mistake.

These were perfect.. My father always made these at Halloween and Christmas. We always added red and green food coloring at Christmas. I used butter microwave popcorn, it was all I had and three to four bags is perfect. I didn’t have to add salt since was already salted. Thanks for sharing such a tradition of a receipe.

I made about 200 of these popcorn balls to give out to neighbors and friends. The response has been so positive I am now at close to 300 balls. I like them, which is good,as I get to eat the goof ups.

Thanks for this yummy recipe.  Big thanks to the reviewer tips as well! I haven't made popcorn balls in 20 years at least but when my sweet husband asked for them, I knew I had to find a good (and easy) recipe.  I turned to Allrecipes - love this site!
Good old-fashion simple popcorn balls!

this recipe tastes really good but I ran into a few problems.  I followed other's reviews and didn't let the mixture sit for five minutes and instead poured it directly on.  While forming the first couple of balls I used the plastic bags which only burned my skin more.  DON'T USE THE PLASTIC BAGS!!!!  Later when I only had a few more I couldn't make any balls because the mixture had hardened within only 3 - 5 minutes.  The finished result is super hard and personally I like my popcorn balls more chewy.  I don't think I would make this again.

These popcorn balls were a hit with the kids at the potluck dessert event. Made the recipe as directed. Super easy. Just work fast to make the balls once slightly cooled. I had extra hands to mix and shape balls.

Oh these are ridiculous!  SO GOOD!  It helped to have my husband pour the candy while I stirred the popcorn.  Be careful though, some landed on my hand and I burned myself pretty badly.  These are easy to make, and taste so good. Mi will be making them again and again!

I have made this 3 times.  The first time over cooked a couple minutes and were really hard!   The second time they were perfect!  The third time undercooked a bit and the balls wouldn't stick together.  So I callled it popcorn ball pull apart and everyone loved it.  If I had read to let it cool for 5 minutes they probably would have stuck together as the first times I did it I let them cool as I had to answer the phone and then take laundry out.  I will only use this recipe when making popcorn balls or pull apart ( everyone's favorite)!

My second attempt at a review - the first one posted way before I was done.  They turned out great & this is my first time making anything like this.  I used enough popcorn to equival to 1.5 bags of 3.5 oz microwave popcorn to make a half batch.  My pots had quart measurements listed on the bottom of them, so that can also help with measuring.  I only had 1/4 cup light corn syrup, so I added a 1/4 cup pancake syrup to reach a 1/2 cup of syrup (again, this was only for 1/2 a batch). I added red food coloring at the same time as the vanilla.  No vinegar, as my microwave popcorn was already butter flavored and I'm sure is loaded with salt.  I put plastic sandwich bags on each of my hands and coated them in vegetable shortening to make the balls.  Oh & I didn't have a candy thermometer so I waited until my meat thermometer got up to 255-260.  That's when I stopped and took the syrup off the stove.  I also dabbled with the hard candy method, & my threads were somewhere in between pliable and brittle :).  This tastes just like caramel corn (I'm munching on the finished product right now) & my kids are going to love them. Unfortunately, they will most likely be the only ones to enjoy them, as my teeth are not in the greatest condition and these definitely stick to them :)

Tastes like caramel popcorn. I made half the recipe and ended up with 10 popcorn balls, which was perfect.

Great recipe i used 1/2 cup popcorn to pop up . this was perfect amount. I did not use vinegar turned out fine. Very buttery tasting . make sure you watch and take off right at 300 or will get to hard to eat.

My family really liked this recipe. I made it so that it was softer and more chewy (took it off the heat at 275 instead of 300).  Just like the popcorn balls my family likes from the local candy shop!

These are awesome! The only change I made, was I substituted the two cups of white sugar for one cup of brown sugar.

I agree with the person who said not to cook it to 300 degrees (instead 250).  I would have liked the syrup not to be so hard because it makes them difficult to eat.  Flavor was good.
