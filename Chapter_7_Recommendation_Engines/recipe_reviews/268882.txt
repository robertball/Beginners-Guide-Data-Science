Loved the flavor, next time I will omit the hominy (not a fan) and add some potato and carrot instead. Thanks for sharing

Recipe sounds good, but you might want to change the recipe to note that if you are cooking the meat in batches, you need to return the meat to the pot before adding all the liquid and cooking.

Made this for dinner, had to adjust some spices, only because I was supposed to make this over a camping weekend and left the spices in our trailer...it was amazing!  Will definitely make again and adding this to my rotation of recipes.

I made this close to the recipe.  Cooked the pork for 25 min before NR.  Added another 15 oz can of hominy.  I made it on the mild side, but the flavor is incredible.  This is one of the best  I have had and highly recommend it as a great recipe to try if you've never had it.  an instant favorite.

Oh, yes, and don't forget the garnishments - we had lime, tortilla strips, and (Mexican) sour cream. Avocados and shredded cabbage would have been good, too.

Good soup! I made the following substitutions due to what I had in my kitchen and it was delicious:

1. I didn't have red enchilada sauce, so instead, I used pasta sauce and added 2tbs chili, 2 tsp oregano, 2 tsp basil, 2 tsp cumin, and 1 tsp garlic powder to it

2. I only had 28 ounce cans of hominy. Added the whole can (drained) and it was great

3. I didn't have pork, so I used some NY steak instead

4. I didn't have cilantro, so that got left out. Would've been better (I think) if cilantro was added.

5. Added some avocado as garnish.

This was so good I ate it all in less than a two days, easy dish -  I found some country style pork ribs and cut those into chunks and it worked great

It was delicious but generally a little spicy because I added the med heat chilies.  I substituted pork tenderloin in place of the shoulder to reduce the extra fat cooked in.  Next time I will reduce the chilipowder by half and use the mild chilies and add extra hominy.
