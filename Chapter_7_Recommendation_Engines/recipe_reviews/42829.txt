A very tasty recipe, but I did make a few changes.  I doubled the sauce and added approx 1 T. soy sauce to the sauce (I didn't like the strong "fish" taste).  Going on others' suggestions, I added carrots and broccoli.  I didn't have any sherry and so I used Beef broth (which I use as a substitute for sherry most of the time).  It turned out great!  Thanks for sharing!

This was yummy! I doubled the sauce and added a splash of soy sauce, as someone recommended. I also added freshly diced ginger and broccoli and called it broccoli beef. I made rice and fresh wontons to go with it (I used the recipe inside of the wonton wrapper to make them). There's definitely no need to add salt to this as it's pretty sodium-rich (maybe it was the splash of soy). My Mom gave me some asian cooking tips as she was over: Stir fry is done at very high eat, so crank it up. Cook the beef first, then remove it. Add the veggies (no more oil) and about 1/4 cup of water and put a lid on it. About a minute later return the beef to the pan and created an opening in the center of the pan. Pour the sauce in there and stir it around in the middle until it's translucency changes (about 1 minute). Combine all ingredients and serve. My husband said that this was restaurant quality and perhaps the best broccoli beef he's ever had!

This is an excellent dish. I didn't have any sherry so used port instead. I also added some regular sliced onion, garlic & mixed veges and served with fried rice.
YUMMY!!!

I did end up doubling the sherry and fish sauce component of the sauce but left the other measurements the same. I served it over my own fried rice recipe. It turned out amazing! I will be making this again.

This was my first time making a stirfry, so I wasn't sure what temperature to have the burner at...I ended up going back and forth between high and medium-high.
I used red wine (merlot) instead of sherry and added 2 T of this garlic-ginger stir fry sauce I found at the store.  Next time I will either add more of this sauce, or use fresh ginger to get that great flavor.  I also added broccoli.  I wasn't too big on the flank steak...way too fatty, and therefor chewy.  Next time I will use a lean cut of meat, and also add a lot more green onions, and perhaps some shallots as well.  I couldn't taste the onion at all.  Also, although I liked the flavor of the peanut oil, I may try olive oil (or a mixture of the two) next time, as it was the flavor that stood out the most to me...but I would like to be able to taste it all!  All-in-all, I really enjoyed it and am excited to do some more stirfying!  :)

The family loved it.  You can add a variety of vegetables to this recipe.  I added yellow pepper, red pepper and garlic.  I doubled the sauce to spoon over the rice.  Will definitely make this again!

OMG! This was SO Yummy. I did make a couple of adjustments. I used White cooking wine instead of sherry because that is what I had on hand. I doubled the sauce and added broccoli. This was very easy and tastey. Don't leave out the oyster sauce. It just makes the recipe.

I am rating this a 4* because as is I think it deserves a 2-3*, but with the modifications it deserves a 5*+, and I don't want people to dicouraged in trying this. I followed the recommendations: double the sauce (still wasn't enough for me, so I wound up whipping up some more right after adding the sauce and veggies to the meat then adding that also), add a TBS soy (per serving of sauce). I didn't have dry sherry so I used sherry cooking wine I had on hand (and added 1TBS beef broth per sauce serving just because I had a bit left over in the fridge). I added about 3 cups broccoli florets, and about 10 or so baby carrots cut in quarters lengthwise. Last but not least I added 2 cloves garlic and about a quarter of an onion, both thinly sliced. I will add more green onions next time. Besides the time it takes to cut the veggies, this is a SUPER FAST AND DELICIOUS meal! Tasted like we'd ordered out! I served over white rice. Enjoy!!!

This was a quick weeknite meal. Added broccoli and red pepper strips. Also, took advice of reviewers and added soy to the sauce. Very nice.

Overall, a very easy and good basic stir-fry recipe.  I added 1T soysauce and 3T water (I don't like thick cornstarchy sauce base, I prefer mine thinner).  Green onions were a bit over cooked for my taste so next time I'll throw them in at the last minute or two.

I made this tonight only used beef tenderloin instead of the flank steak so I cooked it for only a few minutes. This recipe is absolutely delicious! The flavor is great even though there are only a few ingredients. You won't be dissapointed in this.

I give this 5 stars because of the few ingredients, the simple prep, the nice presentation.  (Incidentally, I forgot to add the cornstarch, and it was still great!)  Thanks, Linda, for the fine recipe!

Thanks for this tasty recipe - it's great for 'add-ons' as reviews mention.  I find that the reviews almost always contain handy tips and always read them before trying a new recipe.  As one reviewer mentioned, it's perfectly fine to substitute more liquid already used in the recipe for any alcohol called for.  I have many allergies and food intolerances and alcohol is one of the many.  Love your recipes!

Amazing!  I have to admit, the smell of oyster sauce has kept me from cooking with it for a long time, but now I've seen the error of my ways.  I added a tbsp of soy sauce to the original sauce recipe and made 4x the amount.  Used London broil sliced very thinly.  After frying the meat in sesame and olive oil quickly with some onion and garlic, I added mushrooms, broccoli, cauliflower, red, yellow and orange bell peppers, zucchini and water chestnuts, along with the sauce, and let it steam for a few minutes while I boiled some Udon noodles.  The sauce was amazing, the meat was tender and flavorful, just an all around wonderful dish.  Thanks for sharing.  We make stir fry all the time and this will be our new go to recipe.

I was definately PLEASANTLY surprised with this recipe. I did add soy sauce to cut back on the fishy taste as recommended by others. But I didnt taste it much. I doubled the recipe because i had 2lbs. of meat instead of one, and added red pepper flakes for a little kick. I will surely be making this again very soon.

Used a more tender cut of beef and added 2T soy sauce to the liquid ingredients.  Very quick - loved that it didn't require advanced marinating!  Served with take-out fried rice and a bag of microwaved Mann's broccoli (steamed right in the bag!).

I cooked this recipe according to the directions. My wife and I both enjoyed it! I added a package of frozen mixed vegetables in order to make it a more complete meal. I also served it over rice.

I had some filet mignon that I had to make really quickly so I used this sauce recipe. This was pretty good and my husband really liked it but I think I prefer a marinated steak (this didn't have quite enough flavor for my liking). I would use the same sauce again if I didn't have the time to marinate. It was quick and easy.
