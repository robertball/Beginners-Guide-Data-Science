This was awesome!!!! It should be on top of the popularity list and ratings it was moist and really delicious. My husband loved it also (being a South Dakota boy he really knows his pheasant)

I followed the recipe except I used panko bread crumbs and poultry spice rather than the stuffing mix. It was delicious!

Yummy and easy. I cooked for 10 min less than suggested and probably could have reduced cooking time even further to help reduce dryness

I added 1 teaspoon of fresh diced rosemary. I have also added basil which goes well with the creamy sauce and even some tarragon.

Loved it! Husband said favorite pheasant recipe to date. I tweaked it a bit - left out the mustard and used chopped green onion instead of chives. Excellent!

I made this recipe exactly the way it was described and it was wonderful! One key thing to remember is not to overcook... (so they don't become dry) You can always take them out of the oven before the hour is up pending on the thickness of your pheasant breasts. Really good recipe. Thank you for sharing. It's a keeper for me.

Made this awhile back and would do again with some changes. 1st I'd debone the pheasant as much as possible. 2nd I wouldn't bake as long because the meat seemed dry in some areas. We didn't have any mayonnaise so used miracle whip. We didn't realize how many breasts were in the bag of frozen pheasant breasts so if given more we'd divide it into smaller pkgs. The way it was we had leftovers for several days & I was burnt out on pheasant.

Even the 4 yr old grandson liked it. It was pretty easy and very tasty. The pheasant wasn't dry at all even having to bake for an hour. Excellent!

I made this when someone gave us pheasant breasts. We really liked it! I left out the dijon just because I didn't have any.

My 3 year old daughter loved it and she's a really picky eater. My husband and I loved it too. My husband brings home a lot of pheasant and this is by far the best meal I've made with it!

Not sure I would classify this dish as "elegant" but I would classify it as delicious. I expected it to be dried out and way too salty but I was very wrong. This was extremely moist and you could taste each ingredient in every bite. This had a big Thanksgiving feel to it with the bird and stuffing mix which makes me want to experiment with some sort of cranberry reduction to drizzle over the top of it. This one is a keeper and I'm sure it would work just fine on turkey breast cutlets as well.

As written except I did 4 breast portions and baked at 375 uncovered for 50 min. Perfect moist. Definitely a keeper!

The was excellent. I served it to guests who had never eaten pheasant and they loved it. The pheasant breasts came from a good friend who keeps us supplied so we will definitely be using this recipe again. I made the recipe as written except for the chives only because I did not have any.

Very good.  I substituted stuffing with Herb & garlic bread crumbs and I would recommend doubling or tripling the coating ingredients as I made 2 pheasants.  My two boys loved it and so did I.  It was my first time cooking pheasant.  Will definitely make it again.
