I loved this cake, even though I had to change the recipe a bit because I live overseas and didn't have all the ingredients available. The best part, I thought, was the frosting. I didn't have a whipped topping, so I substituted 1 cup heavy cream whipped together with the pudding and a couple pieces of crushed up pineapple with about 2 T. juice. It was delicious -- I made it three times in a row for three different events and everyone loved it. The best part is, it's easy, easy, easy! Some other combinations of cake mix and stir-ins that I tried were strawberry cake mix with pineapple and strawberry cake mix with mashed bananas. Both combinations were delicious. I thought the strawberry banana cake tasted best with vanilla pudding in the frosting. The strawberry pineapple cake tasted great with white chocolate pudding in the frosting.

Very good, very easy recipe.  Smells great as it's baking.  Will be making again, maybe trying blueberry filling next time.

ATTN COOKS: DON'T FORGET THE EGGS IN STEP #2! :)

Don't be a dork like me, and have to mix the 2 eggs in after you've poured the mix in the pan and swirled in the strawberry topping!  I forgot until almost the last minute! Whoops!

But I made this for a work party, and it was gobbled up in the blink of an eye. Very moist and tasty. I used white cake mix instead of the pineapple flavored mix.  All was well in the end, even though my eggs were not as mixed in as they could have been ;)

Wow! So simple to make and so absolutely delicious! This cake also freezes well. I highly recommend this one.

I was extremely unhappy with the lumpiness that the pineapple in the cool whip/pudding mixture made. It just looks awful and makes it hard to spread "frosting".

This cake probebly would have been better if made with a white cake mix instead off pinapple cake....too strong of a pinapple taste for me.

Delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  It was light, not too sweet, and pretty.

Not a fan... be sure to double check that the cake is completely baked.

Cake was good, but my "frosting" never set. I followed directions, maybe too much liquid because of the pineapple? Instead I served the cake with the pudding/cool whip/pineapple on top in a bowl.
I would make again if I knew how to adjust the topping so I could place it on top of cake.

Good. I do like the pineapple and pudding, but the pineapple cake itself didn't have quite the flavor I was expecting. It was super easy even my husband made this one and we served it at a party with compliments. In the future I'd experiment with the cake flavor.

Very moist and flavorful.  Perfect for a summer BBQ.
