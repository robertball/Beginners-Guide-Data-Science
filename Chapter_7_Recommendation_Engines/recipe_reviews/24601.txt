Recipe submitter, here, with a few new comments. You can make this recipe with Splenda* brand sweetener. It's great, and doesn't mess with your insulin or blood sugar level. (course, the pinapple juices will, but hey..) Making punch with the drippings isn't optional, just so you know. I'ts fabulous. Mix it with homemade lemonade for a summery treat! You can adjust the marshmallow content to your liking. If you and yours arent crazy about 'those' salads packed with marshmallows, cut back. They're not really good for ya anyhow.  And do use real cream, don't desecrate this recipe with miraclewhip* or anything like that. The fat is not really bad for you, read the book: "The protein power lifeplan" for good basic nutrition research. You'll be glad you did. (Look around; does america seem to have 'nutrition' down pat?) Good luck with the salad! It's yummy!

I was unable to find either fresh or frozen cranberries (in February) in my grocery store. But I wanted to try this salad. I substituted a 1 pound bag of tart frozen cherries and followed the rest of the directions (omitting the nuts as my family requested). It turned out wonderfully! Just in time for Valentine's Day and Presidents Day when cherries are so popular.  I put a small bowl of coarsely chopped walnuts on the table for anyone who wished to add the crunch of nuts. This was a hit. I have added it to my keepers. Thanks Chandell!

We've had a very similar recipe in the family for years. It's easy and delicious and a perfect addition to Thanksgiving dinner.
We usually use 1 cup of sugar instead of 2 cups, and it tastes great.

Great Recipe!  Fast and Easy!  I wanted something tart and tangy for Thanksgiving and I got it!  I had to use dried cranberries as the store was all out of fresh and even that worked great!  Also, the walnuts provide an interesting texture for your mouth.

This was wonderful - so much better than jello-based salads!  My store was out of cranberries, so I used 12 ounces of frozen mixed berries, and it turned out fantastic!  Wonderful!!  This will become a holiday staple at our house.

I used only about a cup of sugar with my cranberries and it was sweet enough.  I also added some halved red grapes and skipped the nuts (allergies).  I think the crushed pineapple really adds to this recipe....it was very yummy and decadent!

This is the same recipe as Christmas Cranberry salad, except that one ses drained pineapple. I love this salad. I buy cranberries when they are in season and freeze so I will have them. I only use 1 cup sugar and usually leave out the marshmallows. I've made it with out the nuts, but it is so much better with nuts! Only use real whipping cream(unsweetened-not cool whip!)

WOW! I made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it! I saved drained juice to make punch. Here is what I did: The night before I filled two ice cube trays with one cranberry in each slot. I poured lemon up into one tray, and water into the other, then froze. On thanksgiving I poured a bottle of lemon up, the drained juice and ice cubes into a punch bowl. I also placed about five slices of fresh lemon, and three slices of fresh lime in with it. I had so many compliments! The salad was wonderful too, and I did NOT cut the sugar. I did cut the marshmallows though, about in half. It all depends on your tastes.  (Use a 2 liter bottle of lemon up)

Great alternative to the typical cranberry sauce.  My kids don't usually eat cranberry sauce, but liked the marshmallows in this, so they did eat it.  The only thing we didn't like was the pieces of cranberry skin.  They were a little tough and made the texture a little weird.  I also only put in a few nuts, chopped not so little, so that my kids could pick them out if they wanted.  I am glad that I tried this recipe.

Very good!!  Not too sweet and not too tart!  I let the cranberries and pineapple drain in the fridge overnight and added 2/3 can of cherry pie filling that I had left over from another recipe, which made it a nice pink color.  Tasty!

This was just "alright." I added the full amount of sugar and even then it was too tart at the end. I don't think I'll make this again.

My version is that I add 2 cups of red seedless grapes cut in half to this recipe. I also place the sugar and cranberries in a bowl in the fridge overnight.....drain crushed pineapple very well separately. I usually omit the nuts because of allergies with children since they usually devour this salad. 
In the summer I also make this recipe with fresh strawberries...it is a hit also!

We ate the marshmallows out of it.  I followed the recipe completely.  Coconut might be better than marshmallows... who knows.. I was amazed at how much more juiced drained over night.  That's a good suggestion.

This is the best cranberry salad recipe I have found anywhere.  It has just the right amount of sweetness and tartness to make for a delicious side to any holiday dinner.  It will definately be part of my holiday family dinners from here on out!  This salad makes for a very festive presentation as well.

Very good!  I did use Splenda in it as the submitter said you could do.  Great dish because it's not overly sweet and it had just the right combination of sweet and tangy from the cranberries!!!!  Try it, you won't be disappointed!

New Family Favorite!

I added chopped white chocolate chips to the recipe also.

I used canned WHOLE cranberry sauce (4 cans), letting the pineapple and cranberries drain overnight (used the remaining juices for my mimosas).

So fast and simple, the taste was absolutely amazing!!!

Never even finished making it; after letting stand overnight the cranberries were still hard and over the top tart.  Didn't even try to doctor them up by following rest of recipe.

I brought this salad to the Thanksgiving meal and it was a real hit! I used 1 & 3/4 cup sugar as others suggested and sprinkled another tablespoon or so of sugar on the salad while it sat in the frig ready to eat and then mixed it all up once more before serving.  Several people asked for the recipe - i take that as a good sign.  I'll definitley use this recipe again!
