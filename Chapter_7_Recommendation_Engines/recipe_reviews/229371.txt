These are great! I've been baking for years, but never made cupcakes from scratch. This was great! 

I was out of milk, so I substituted buttermilk and I always add a pinch of cinnamon to all things chocolate to bring out the flavor. I didn't know when to fill the cupcakes with cream, so I let them cool for about 5 minutes then filled with the cream.   Yum!

I wouldn't recommend this recipe as it is.  Instead of using 2/3 cup of shortening, I would use 1/3 cup shortening and 1/3 cup butter.  I would also increase the confectioners sugar to 1 cup and the white sugar to 1 cup.  The frosting I made from the original recipe tasted very greasy and was not sweet enough.

The batter scared me at first because it looked to be on the thin side. But it baked up very nicely. The cake itself does not have to great chocolate taste. I took another reviewers suggestion on increasing the sugars for the sweetness and adding more white sugar was a mistake. The filling was crunchy and stayed crunchy. Hopefully as they sit for 2 days in fridge that might reduce some. I would only increase the conf. sugar. I don't think I would frost the tops with this filling as stated. I went with a chocolate glaze. Did not oooh and ahhh over this.

Everybody loved these cupcakes. I added more frosting on the top because they looked a little boring. The only word that describes them is amazing.

I have to be honest, I made these for my family one night, and they were ok. It was probably just my frosting tube, but it just didn't come out right. Everyone still loved them, and I'll try this recipe again with different ingredients.

These are great cupcakes! They are moist and delicious!! (: when I added the water and baking soda it was quite runny so I added some coco powder and more flour until it got a little thicker. On the icing, I hate crisco, so I used butter and it tasted fine, also, I made a lot more then what it called for. These are defiantly keepers and easy to make!

These were pretty good.  I didn't fill them with the filling in the recipe.  I created my own raspberry cream filling but the cupcake itself was pretty good.
