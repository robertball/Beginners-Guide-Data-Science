Not good.  I used teaspoons instead of tablespoons for the salts and it was still way too salty and I got thumbs down from the whole family.  DON'T MAKE THIS.

This is a tasty and "normal" meatloaf recipe without any added ingredients to complicate the taste.  I did read the reviews before making it, and noticed the ingredient amounts didn't match the amount of beef.  There may have been a mistake in the submission of this recipe. I used 1 can of tomato paste, about 1/3 of the 15oz can of bread crumbs, 1 1/2 tbsp of garlic salt and seasoning salt.  I actually forgot the egg, all that does is hold it all together so it stays in a slice.  I would use only 1 egg.    I loved this recipe for its simplicity in taste!

1 Star because I can't give it 0. I too wish I would have read the reviews. And halfway through realized the measurements were wrong. So, I managed to add more meat and make 2 loaves out of this, but it was still awful....mine was also burned on the outside and raw on the inside and just plain weird...I love meatloaf and this was awful.

This recipe has GREAT potential, but the 3 Tablespoons of Garlic Salt and 3 Tablespoons of Seasoned Salt should have been TEASPOONS

This "meatloaf" tasted more like paste-loaf. There was too much tomato paste and the consistency was WIERD! Ick. This recipe actually forced me to go out for fast food at 9:30 at night.

The baking time was not correct. The center of the meatloaf was red. I placed it in the oven for additional time and it was still red. I was also hard to judge because it had a red tint from the paste. The meat never cooked thoroughly and I had to throw it away. I do not recommend this recipe.

So I followed the recipe, thought it looked "funny" when I was done shaping the loaf, then I put in the oven....THEN I read the reviews. So I started making something else right away while it baked in the oven, assuming it would come out as bad as everyone said it would...OMG.....it was worse than that. It looked like a big mound of burnt clay. it tasted like what I would imagine dog food would taste like and the salt...omg, it was so salty it made ya wanna puke. I wouldnt even feed this to my dog. What a waste of precious money!..awful Joke Mr. James Ruben. Delete this recipe!

I would change the 3 tablespoons garlic salt to either real garlic or garlic powder. I would also add onions and decrease the seasoned salt by  1/3 or more! Too salty like it is.

I decided to make a serious attempt at using the ingredients stated, but adjust the proportion of them & try to turn this into a real meatloaf.  It wasn't a half-bad effort.  I'm not sure I remember completely, but I THINK that I used like 2 cans of tomato paste, 1-2 eggs, and then used 3 tbsp of garlic *powder* (to hopefully keep some flavor, rather than just reducing it to practically nothing), and then did 1 tsp. of seasoning salt.  I don't know bread crumbs in ounces, but I think it was 1 cup -- I added that last, until it seemed a good consistency.  In the end, it wasn't bad this way but could've used more flavor.  And I didn't have any issues with it burning on the outside before getting done in the middle.  (I'm inclined to believe that's only cause it *looks* not done cause it's red from tomato paste.)  I noticed one person called it a "normal" meatloaf recipe except the measurement were accidentally off.  Well, I can certainly forgive accidentally writing tablespoon instead of teaspoon, but when you have to adjust practically every ingredient so drastically!, this is no longer an accidental mistake in listing, and it certainly doesn't deserve a 4 after having to fix everything.  What I got out of it, after fixing it, was maybe still only a 3.  And I'm certainly not going to rate it a 3 when I had to intentionally set out to see how I could fix what was an obviously messed up recipe.  (Or perhaps it was a joke -- that had not occured to me.)

This recipe made our evening meal a disaster. I didn't read the reviews first. I wasted food and time.  I cut back on the salt and tomato paste and it still turned out bad. I can't recommend it.

I honestly agree that the tablespoons of salt should have been listed as teaspoons.  We couldn't eat what came out of the oven.  We had cut back on the rest of the items (for lack of having them handy--lucky break!) so outside of the salt, the meatloaf was ok.  Personally I would try a different recipe instead of attempting this one again.

I was searching for a recipe and saw this one and can't believe that it has not been deleted from the web site. It has to be a joke is all I can say. By the way the 1 star was my only option in order to post, I would not even entertain the thought of trying this.

I also should have read the reviews first.  Maybe then I would not have put all of that salt, tomato paste and eggs into 2 lbs. of beef.  I also ended up with meat that was burnt on the outside and raw on the inside.  If I do try it again, I will certainly be cutting way back on those ingredients.

Sometimes amateur pictures of food don't always look as appetizing as the food really is.  This picture was accurate.  Even reducing the crumbs and salt didn't help the consistency.

The seasoning measurements for this recipe are clearly wrong and even if they were I think this would STILL bad.  I asked my g/f to search for a meatloaf recipe and this is the one she came across, unfortunate that she didn't read the reviews.  I kept asking her if she was sure the seasoning wasn't listed in teaspoons and she said "no." Against my better judgement I followed what she wrote down.  What came out of the oven wasn't even edible.

I too should have read the reviews first.  This is only my second time making meatloaf and my first results were only so-so.  So when I made this I thought the fault was with me.  However, even though I cooked it for longer that the instructions stated, it still ended up burned on the outside and raw on the inside.  I won't be making this again.

After reading the reviews, I changed this recipe a bit. I used 4lbs ground chuck,(alot to feed) 2 6oz. cans of tomatoe paste, 1 14oz can of Salsa, (drained) 2 eggs,(beaten) 1 pack of Saltine crackers,(the long pack out of a box of 4) 1 TBS Italian Seasoning, 1/2 TBS Seasoned Salt. Mix all and put into 2 6x9 pans. and cook at 350 for 1 1/2 hours. At the last 20 minutes, pull them out of the oven and cover with a light coat of tomatoe sauce. Finish cooking. Thumbs up!!

I made this last night and it was fantastic!!! I'm a newbie when it comes to cooking (literally, I've only cooked about 5 times in my entire life!) This was simple to make and my entire family LOVED IT!!! The only change I made was using garlic powder in place of the garlic salt, I'm not a big fan of salty foods.

Three stars for potential.  i cut the salt, but not enough....oh my goodness! but I added 1tbl steak sauce or worshtershire, 2 tbl horseradish mustard 3/4 c each diced onion and celery and all the extras would have made it really good but that darn salt. I can't believe I didn't read reviews first.

-1 star, actually. Such a waste of two good pounds of ground beef. Such a lot of salt.
On the other hand, we'll not use another of these recipes without first checking the reviews.

I think the tomato paste could be lessened to one can rather than 4 and the seasoning should be lessened also.  The taste was good but overpowering with seasoning.  I will adjust and use it again.  Thank you.
