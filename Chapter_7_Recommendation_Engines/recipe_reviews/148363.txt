I didn't make this for myself - I made it for my wife (this kind of drink isn't my thing).  And she liked it - she said she really, really liked it.  Not too sweet, not too strong (although she said be careful, it DOES pack a little punch) and, just as simple as this, it just plain tasted good.  Won't replace her favorite chocolate martini, but it made her all happy.

Took the advise of a previous reviewer and tossed some crushed blueberries into the shaker. Very tasty!

Very good but, I would cut back on the limoncello next time and muddle a few blueberries into the mix. 
Cheers & thanks for the recipe!

Too sweet and too strong.  My husband thought the combination of flavors tasted like bubblegum.  A bubblegum martini - yuck!

Absolutely lovely. We've had them 3 nights in a row.
