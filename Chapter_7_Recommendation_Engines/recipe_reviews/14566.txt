My boyfriend made this for us tonight and it turned out great! We didn't have the full 6 hours to let our steaks marinade (I think they were only in there for about 3 hours) Still turned out great though! Nice and flavourful. We didn't reserve any of the juice for heating up. All thought it would probably be a nice addition, we certainly didn't miss it. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing it :)

I was extremely skeptical about 'ruining' a steak with oranges!  I halved everything in the recipe EXCEPT the garlic--I used the full amount.  The consensus of the family was that this steak was 'nice', my own version is better.  There is no salt in this recipe so for those who are used to salt-seasoned steak might be extremely hesitant on making it.  This has good potential, but I still think it needs some kind of salt--a bit of soy sauce, maybe?
