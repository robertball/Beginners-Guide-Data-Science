I used this as the fish in a fish taco and used the white sauce in the fish taco recipe poured over the shredded cabbage over the fish inside a four tortilla- outstanding!

Delicious !. I used more garlic and i actually marinaded the fish for a couple of minutes and also basted on grill.  This was a big hit - the key is to NOT overcook the mahimahi.  I will definitely make this again.

I will try writing this again!  This is a wonderful marinade for fish!  I have used this exact recipe for around 3 years and finally decided to write a comment!  Absolutely love it!

Simple and delicious. I cooked it on a grill pan on the cooktop, about 4-5 minutes each side.

Loved it! It was mild and accented the Mahi flavor nicely. I will definitely be using it again.

Awesome, awesome, awesome!  Loved this!  Made it with 2 Mahi Mahi filets and had marinade left over, so I mixed it in with my rice.  I had to broil it, though, because it was raining when I made it!  Next time I will grill it!  Thank you for sharing!!!

My husband and I really liked this! Easy and uses ingredients that we always have around. The recipe made more sauce than we really needed for the 2 of us so it could even be cut down a bit. Thanks!

Easy. I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet with avocado oil. I basted it as directed, and seared the mahi on both sides, about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, then poured the remaining sauce into the skillet, covered it and put it in an oven at 350 for 10 minutes. Served it with mango chutney, DELICIOUS.

We made this following the recipe and cooked it on an indoor grill.  It smelled fantastic and made the whole house smell delicious, but we found the actual meal somewhat disappointing and a bit bland.

This was very good! I used 3 garlic cloves, because we love our garlic.
