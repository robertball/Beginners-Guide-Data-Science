If anyone in the US knows great Chinese food, it's New Yorkers, of which I proudly count myself. And this native New Yorker can tell you, this is hands-down the best lo mein I ever put in my mouth! The only changes I made are very minor. No red bell pepper because I'm allergic, and used pork, chicken, and shrimp in place of only pork (making this my own version of "house lo mein".) The flavor lingers pleasantly on the palate, and the sauce enrobes the linguine gently with no trace of gloopiness. Just the right hint of sweetness, not overpowering as so many are. It really doesn't  matter what protein you use. The sauce is a symphony of taste, which elevates anything you choose to feature. In my case, said choice was dictated by what was in my fridge. For the pork, I diced up 2 small boneless chops. Loved the liberal use of mushrooms. Bamboo shoots and/or water chestnuts could be successfully added, as well. This recipe needs no tinkering, however, to ensure a virtuosic blend of flavors. Phenomenal!

Didn't have any linguini, so I used a package of stir-fry noodles i'd bought the last time I was at the Asian market.  I added more ginger, but that's just a personal taste preference.   We were longing for just a little spiciness, so we ended up adding a sprinkle of red pepper flakes at the dinner table which brought it up to speed for us.  Pork was tender and juicy, vegetables were crisp, and the sauce was loaded with flavor.  Thanks, Kendra, for sharing your recipe.

Sauce was incredibly good! Kudos. I did double it in case the pasta soaked some up, and I was kinda glad I did.

I did reverse the cooking order. Stir fried the pork and some of the onion first, then set aside, then stir fried the veggies. Combined all in the dutch oven used to cook the linguine to save a mess.

Finally, sugar snap peas were so expensive in the store, I went with 16 oz frozen Asian veggies, and fresh mushrooms and a red bell pepper.

This is a definite keeper. I cannot wait till more find it! It is so worthy of many, many likes. Thanks Kendra

This was wonderful and we loved the sauce. I was leery it wasn't going to make enough for the dish, but with the juices of the vegetables it was perfect. Followed as directed, but used half red and green bell peppers. This would be good with chicken or shrimp also...and was the perfect amount for four of us... Thanks Kendra!

Prepared this for Recipe Group Sept. 2013...really delicious and super simple prep.  Hubs loved this.  I prepared as written with a couple of "enhancements"...marinated my pork overnight (soy, hoisin, garlic, rice vinegar, sherry, pepper), and added a spoonful of Thai garlic paste to the sauce for a little heat and spice.  As Sherri pointed out, this recipe would work with any protein or veggies.  A definite do-over.  Served with spring rolls.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with us, Kendra :)

I made the mistake of using regular soy sauce because it's what we had in the house. Don't do what I did - it was wayyyyy too salty for our tastes. Use the reduced sodium like the recipe suggests.
When you break this down, it's a simple recipe and I really liked it... stir fry some veggies, add the sauce, add the cooked noodles. Might even make it meatless next time.

Made this for my man a couple of nights ago. He is already requesting it again. He says its better than any Chinese takeout. I was leary about the amount of sauce but there was plenty. He is not a mushroom fan but actually loved them in this recipe.
The only downside is I don't think I will be getting takeout any longer.

the only thing I would do differently would be to double up on the sauce...everything else was awesome!  What a way to use up leftover roasted pork loin!!!

'Think this recipe is okay, but I prefer a more flavors in this type food - especially the sauce.  A good base & easily adjusted.  I used regular soy, but reduced to 1/4c.

I make a lot of Asian dishes, but I have to say this was by far my favorite...I doubled the sauce for a pound of lo mein noodles and added in a couple of dashes of Oyster sauce.  I had a lot of leftover pork tenderloin after News Years, and this was a great way to use up the leftovers!

I made this for recipe group. I think we could have used 1/2 to 3/4 of the pasta and been fine. This was more than 4 servings for us, closer to 5 or 6. That being said, it was good and the only real complaint I have is that this is a lot of food for even my largest skillet. The meat took longer than 2 minutes even though I added it to the peas and onions prior to the rest of the veggies.  The peas got overdone trying to finish the meat and not only lost that nice fresh green color, they started to fall apart. I would make this again but I would cook the meat first until no longer pink and then add the rest. My only change was that I used white wine vinegar since I didn't have rice vinegar and ground ginger instead of fresh.

Yummy!  I made a few modifications:  I used a wok.  I doubled the sauce, used a 16 oz. box of linguine instead of 8 oz. and I sliced boneless, thin-cut, pork loin chops instead of using pork tenderloin.  Everything else I followed to a tee! It was delicious.  Leftovers were eaten the next day--even my picky children loved it.  About a week later, I used this same sauce with a couple of bags of stir fry vegetables, leftover spaghetti, and sliced chicken tenders in my wok.  That was delicious, too.  The sauce is the boss in this recipe.  Thanks so much, Kendra!

I made this with red and green bell peppers, onion, peas, and kohlrabi (which adds a nice crunch, rather like water chestnuts), and leftover roast pork.  I doubled the sauce, as I had a lot of veggies, and served it over boiled Japanese udon noodles.  Perfect!

This was the best stir fry combo I've ever made. I didn't have any red peppers but they were not missed. I used 1/2 tsp of ginger in place of fresh.  As in other stir fry recipes the cutting and measuring is time consuming beforehand but it all came together nicely.

I like to make stir fry because it is so easy going.  I don't always follow the recipe to a T cuz I usually don't have all the ingredients. Still turned out great.  As my husband says "It's a keeper"

My pork was already cooked so I adjusted the cook time one it and I omitted the mushrooms.  This is fantastic!  I doubled the pasta and sauce as I had last minute extra guests.  Nothing was left but full bellies.  Easy to add what veggies you have on hand and I'm sure would be excellent with other proteins.  Next time I'd add a bit of red pepper flakes, but that is just me!

Very good. Followed it exact but I thought pork was a little bland. I wonder if it would have more flavor if I marinated it like one of the other reviewers. Will make it again and maybe try that.

It was a great way to use up the leftover pork loin from New Year's Eve!  However I chopped the vegetables into small pieces (per the directions), and I also cut the pork into small pieces (not in strips as directed).  I found it difficult to eat with the linguine.  Maybe the sauce was too thin?  I also did not find the sauce very flavorful.

This is really good. I doubled the sauce. Otherwise, I used all ingredients as stated, but added a dash of crushed red pepper. I cooked it slightly different. I stir-fried the thinly sliced pork first in the canola oil (you don't need 2 Tbs of oil; use about 2 tsps.) and took it from the wok and kept it warm in foil. I also removed any extra liquid from the wok after removing the pork.

Then stir-fry the snap peas, onions and red pepper for a few minutes. Then add the garlic mushrooms and ginger so the mushrooms don't cook as long and get over done. When the veggies are crisp tender, add the pork back in and then add the sauce. 

My husband and son really liked it, too,

This was so simple and I loved it.  I made it for my very traditional asian parents and they ate all of it. I did replace the linguine with tagliatelle in the same proportions to give it a more asian feel to it by using egg noodles.  Thanks!

This was okay - I think it would have been better had a made it ahead of time and allowed the pasta to soak up the sauce.  As it was, the noodles themselves had very little flavor.

Recipe Group Selection:  21, September 2013 ~ Delicious recipe to prepare lo mein.  I got a great deal on blsl chicken breast, so I made ours with that rather than pork.  We really liked the sauce in this dish.  My husband is not a big fan of soy - but this was mild with great flavor.  I did skip the mushrooms as we are not fans of them.  This recipe is so versatile that it could be made with the  protein and veggies of your choice. I served this with 'Autumn Apple Salad II' another recipe from AR. Thanks Kendra:) for sharing your recipe.

Made this for Recipe Group...This was very good! I made the mistake of using rice noodles instead of linguine b/c I had some to use up. They ended up getting pretty gummy, but it was no fault of the recipe. The pork, veggies and sauce were tasty, and I will def be making this again, with linguine, lol. Thanks for sharing. :)

I used leftover roast pork, had no linguine so used a small handful of spagettini instead. A little more sauce would have been nice. But overall a very nice dish that I would definitely make again.

Sauce was a little sweet for our taste. Will try again cutting back on sugar and vinegar. Maybe add some chili flakes for a little kick. Is a good base recipe for my first attempt at Asian noodles.

Great basic recipe. Thanks for posting Kendra. As you suggested I added some veggies: julienned carrots, celery and water chestnuts. As several other reviewers suggested, I doubled the sauce amount. I will definitely make this again (and again)!

Loved it! Used leftover pork tenderloin,  and I doubled the peppers since didn’t have snow peas. Had to sub canned mushrooms  because my fresh ones were spoiled and we used Chinese noodles instead of linguine. Yummy easy recipe.

This is a great meal. My only complaint is chopping the veggies. It’s a new way for us to have pork tenderloin which is often sold at a good price.

FANTASTIC!  Small adjustments I incorporated 
• I had cooked pork roast ... so shredded chunks vs strips which turned out great. 
• I had broccoli on hand so fried that vs the Snow Pea Pods and that was terrific
• I used summer squash veggie noodles vs standard linguine and that was great because just incorporated those at the end and the veggie noodles didn't get too soft ... were perfect.  
Sauce was terrific ... even had a 2 lunch meals a couple days later and all ingredients were perfect!
DEFINITELY in the make again list!

I did what many people suggested and doubled the sauce. I'm glad I did because I ended up making a lot. Problem was, when I tasted it, it was super salty! I used low sodium soy sauce. To sweeten it up, I used a sweet chili sauce lightly over the top, maybe 3 or 4 tablespoons, and mixed it up. Turned out okay. I think I am just going to stick with the stir fry sauce from the Asian food section.

Yum...A family favorite!  The Hormel pork tenderloin I can get at my grocery store is 24oz. I've used the whole tenderloin and only doubled the sauce with excellent results. It's better (and cheaper:) than take-out! Thanks for the recipe!

Went together really quick and easy.  This was good, didn't change anything.  Might add some heat if I make it again.  Some red pepper flakes or something like that.  Needed just a little more kick.

I like to use sesame oil, fresh Chinese Lo Mein and add some hoisin sauce to mixture. I always thicken the sauce with a mixture of corn starch and water. I like more ginger root than what was called for. This is good for chicken and beef stir-fry Lo Mein.

Pretty good except to salty from the soy sauce. Next time we'll cut back some.  The cooking time when you add the pork, mushrooms, red pepper, garlic & ginger is more than 2 min.  I think ours was in the range of 5+ mins & the pork was thinly cut.

Very good.  Used pork tenderloin, marinated in soy sauce, rice vinegar, garlic, sesame oil.  Otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. Did increase sauce by about half.

This recipe is very easy and very delicious.  The sauce was just right, and I will use this recipe again to experiment with different combinations of meat and veggies.  Last night I substituted carrots for the mushrooms due to husband's preference, but otherwise made pretty much as directed.

I added more ginger.  It was good but didn't have that distinct Chinese flavor.  Needs working on.  I'm going to look up other recipes and do some combining  until I get the taste I want.  Ever get a lo mein some place new and first bite is like, OMG that's good lo mein.   That's what I'm looking for.

I loved this so much and the sauce was delicious!

I made a few changes to it. First, I had actual bought actual Lo Mein noodles from the Asian market, so I used those. Additionally, I added tofu and eggs into the lo mein along with the pork and other ingredients. End result was a dinner that tasted so much better than anything out of a restaurant!

This was very quick and easy to make. The flavor was very good and the pork very tender. I usually don't like dishes like this leftover but this was good the next day.

Easy enough but next time I'll sub teriyaki for the soy and probably add more ginger.

I followed this recipe exactly as written. Even with the low-sodium soy sauce, this was incredibly salty. (I used the Kikkoman brand, which I feel is pretty mainstream.) I just did not like the taste, and I couldn't eat it.

This was a very good recipe. I did not include the bell peppers or snap peas and I cut up a bunch of green onions and added them at the end of cooking. I also used a full 16 oz. box of linguine. I followed the other directions for the recipe and it turned out great.

Wow!This really is a great recipe. I didn't make any changes that would alter the taste. However,  I did increase the sauce by half again as much and use soba noodles instead of pasta. Awesome!!!

Love this recipe. I have used beef, pork and chicken and next time, I will try it with shrimp. I do double the sauce cause the linguini does soak it up. I have also used fine soup noodles which are thinner and hubby liked that even better and sometimes I put it all over some white rice. YUMMY!

Great flavor- I used this as a base to use up some items I had. The sauce is the key and it is exactly what I was looking for. I'm listing the changes so you get an idea of how versatile you can be when making it. I used 2 pork chops deboned and sliced thin, frozen broccoli-defrosted, fresh carrot sliced thin with veg. peeler. I omitted snap peas and more mushrooms.

It is hard to mess this one up! 
Used it as base recipe & threw in veggie ends & pieced I had on hand, e.g.: greens tops from fresh beets/cut away the stalks & blanched 1 minute first in boiling water; defrosted frozen shelled edamame soybeans;  white tender portions of the green onions; zucchini; slices of yellow, orange & red mini peppers; canned water chestnuts; heaping Tbps of jarred minced garlic & tube ginger root;  thinly sliced beef strips/ fat cut away; thinly cut leftover asparagus stalks; Asian rice noodles/soaked 25 min in hot water first [per pkg instructions]/then drained & added to stir fry; dry wantons & sliced almonds on top along with the sliced green portion of the green onions].  I skipped the snap peas & sweet onion bc I did not have any on hand. The sauce mixture is a definite keeper!  Even with all these ingredients, I did not have to double the sauce. I did add a 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes to the sauce.  One key is to keep the veg slices about the same size so they cook uniformly, and you get many flavors on a fork full.
I usually discourage my husband from going back for seconds, but this one is so full of nutrition, I encouraged him to go back for thirds!  AND we still have enough for lunch tomorrow.  I would definitely make this again and again.

This sauce is amazing! I made the rest of the recipe very differently, this the 4 stars, but I'm sure it's great, too.

I used buckwheat noodles (Japanese soba noodles) and, as recommended by another reviewer,doubled the sauce and used a package of stir-fry vegetables (14 oz Birdseye). This recipe would be 5-star even without these adjustments.

Very good. I enjoyed this dish. Used half as much pasta and added a cup of broccoli florets. (Typical for me...to decrease calories and increase nutrition...) Slightly varied the order...cooked onion and mushroom first, then added snap peas, then broccoli and red pepper, and pork, as I was using leftover pork tenderloin, already cooked.  I thought the amount of sauce was adequate, but I did use less pasta. Next time I will try honey in place of sugar and add a sprinkle of Cajun seasoning. Yum.

Yummy sauce. Doubled the sauce as a reviewer recommended and glad I did. I think my pasta ate it before we did. Only used about 4 oz of pasta, grated the ginger and left out green onion because I didn't have any. Easy and we all enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing this recipe with us!

Thanks for a good recipe, with easy to follow directions. I used what I had in my refrigerator; pork chops, carrots and cabbage with the onion and fresh garlic, added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to the sauce, and otherwise, prepared as directed. Also used regular soy sauce. The only thing I will change next time will be to experiment with flavors, as we like our Asian food to have a little more kick.

Quick and easy!  I used left over pork tenderloin, no onion (personal preference) and the only other change was the addition of some fresh lime juice.

Made this as written. After my kids tasted it, I then realized it was not enough for the three of us. It is so good! The next time I make it, I will double the recipe.

Was pretty tasty.  I may add more garlic and ginger next time, and perhaps a touch of hot sauce or chili flakes.  I liked that it wasn't overly sweet.  Very easy to make.

The sauce on this is just like you eat in an Asian restaurant.  Need to use this sauce on all stir fry dishes as it tastes very authentic. This is a winner for sure. This is a keeper for me!
