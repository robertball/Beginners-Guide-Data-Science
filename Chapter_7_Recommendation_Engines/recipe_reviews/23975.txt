Very quick and very easy to prepare, but above all this recipe was delicious.  I used fat free sour cream and skim milk rather than the heavy cream, and still managed to pull off the magnificant flavor.  We will definately make this again!

HOLY SMOKES!!!!  I can not even express how delicious this sauce is.  My husband and I both loved it.  Both of us agree it is our favorite recipe found here yet.  I'm thinking the recipe calls for too much pasta so I would recomend making less when you make it.  DEFINATELY make it though.  It is a must try!!

This recipe was great. I made a few changes along the way. I used more tomato sauce and less cream and also used parmesan cheese because that is what I had. I will make this again.

Our family has a new favorite!  This dish is absolutely delicious.  Even my two-year-old thinks it's "tasty!."  We enjoy it with french bread, and salad.

I made the recipe, event though I had to make changes as I had no farfalle, roqueforte cheese or heavy cream! I simply used what I had on-hand: linguine, some leftover Paul Newman's spagetti sauce, parmasean/romano cheese and non-fat half and half, which I always have for coffee. The result was delicious, and now I know how the restaurant chefs come up with that beautifully hued "pink" pasta sauce.  I'm not sure I'd like it with the roquefort cheese - sounds a bit heavy, but it's a great recipe and will be my "this time I'm cooking what I want!" meal.

YUMMY!  I too had to make a few changes by using sour cream and milk instead of heavy cream, but it turned out so good!  I use allrecipes all the time and like most of the recipes I try, but this is going to the top of my recipe box.

My husband and I tried this recipe.  It was wonderful.  It reminded me of a dish served at Macaroni Grill.  We served this at our daughter's baptism and it was a hit.

We have an italian resturant in town that makes this and I was looking for how to make it. I did substitute a couple things to what I had on hand. I cooked the murshrooms, onion, and bacon and when they were cooked I added about 2 tbs of flour before adding milk, since I didnt have cream. I let that heat up till thick while stiring and then added 2 oz of parmasian cheese. I also realized I didnt have tomato sauce, so I pureed a can of tomatoes and added a couple spoonfuls of that. It was very very good and tasted just like my fav restruant!

wow! so good!  I omitted the butter & substituted 1 can of condensed milk instead of heavy cream, used 5 strips of bacon, 5 oz. of gorgonzola(didn't have roquefort), and 8 oz of tomato sauce.  I also added about 3 T. of flour just before adding the liquids-helped to thicken it up a bit.  Delicious

I'm making this again this week because its so delicious.  I made exactly to recipe and wouldnt change a thing.  Oh I used gorgonzola so I guess that's not exactly to recipe.  This sauce is 'sop-it-up-with-your-bread' good.  You've gotta give it a try!

This is a winner!! Definitely try this. I didn't have the right cheese but I subbed gorgonzola and it still was an incredible meal. We all loved it and the next day leftovers kicked a**!! Try it, just try it.

Ok I loved it BUT NO ONE IN MY HOUSE LIKED IT. My husband said it was to dry the kids ALL four said it was dry. I made as is. I liked the sauce and thought it was a nice blend. Well I might make for myself but with the cost of the cheese needed for the recipe probably not often!

I loved this recipe. I had to substitute Gorgonzola for the Roquefort for lack of availability, but the Gorgonzola did great. Mushrooms, bacon, and onions are great in this dish.

I accidentally used a  12oz (well, might not've been 12, but a larger/more average sized can) can of sauce instead of 4, and it turned out delicious, so I think I'll keep my version of the recipe that way ^_^

This was delicious.  But anything with bacon and blue cheese has to be yummy.  I did use a small can of petite cut tomatoes instead of tomato sauce because it was what I had on hand.  Also had some shitake mushrooms, along with the button ones.  I agree with another reviewer, that 18 oz of pasta is way too much, and I used probably 10 oz, not quite a whole box.  Leftovers were delicious.

Love, love.  After reading the comments about the dish being dry from several people, I decided to double the sauce ingredients and use a full lb of pasta.  Worked perfect for us, we like to have plenty of sauce.  Will make again!!***Made it again while my daughter's boyfriend was in town and again it was great.  Doubled the sauce again too.

I made this last week and wasn't thrilled by it. I am not a huge fan of blue cheeses but thought I would try this anyway because I loved everything else in the recipe.  The roquefort was too strong for me and I put in less than the recipe called for.

It was very good - nothing too special, but a nice change from the ordinary pasta. I used penne pasta. I didn't have the roquefort, so I used 1/4 cup mozarella and a bit of parmesan. I didn't have heavy cream, so I just used milk. I used some real bacon bits rather than pieces of bacon. I used about 1/2 cup of Trader Joes mushroom tomato sauce rather than opening up a can. At the end, I added the pasta to the sauce and mixed it all together rather than just topping the plain pasta. Basically, this was a recipe that was a good starting point and inspiration for what the meal became.

Excellent recipe just from the sounds of it and what I made turned out absolutely fantastic!  I didn't have either heavy cream, fresh mushrooms nor roquefort cheese so instead, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup and half parmesan, half mozzarella in place of the roquefort.  I also added two cloves of minced garlic.  The recipe was a huge hit with the family~

Great dish!  But yes, way too much pasta for the sauce.  I'd say 8-10 oz. pasta, and only 1/4 teaspoon salt.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I made some changes and didn't like it.  As I made it, I would have given it a 3.  Basically, Roquefort cheese is stinky and expensive, so I went with Gouda instead.  I guess it didn't work because it wasn't that good.  I did use a full 8oz of tomato sauce and only about 8oz of pasta.  I think 18oz of pasta is WAY too much and must be a typo.  Anyway, don't make with Gouda and maybe it will be better!
