I gave this recipe 4 stars but with a few changes it is a 5. I am the kitchen manager for a rescue mission and have to feed alot of people on a small budget. And this dish is definetly a low cost meal that delivers big results. Here are the changes I made - first I sauteed together chopped onions, celery & carrots - which is called a mirepoix. Then I added the flour and then milk with some chicken stock. To this I added additional seasoning - garlic powder, thyme, rosemary, and sage. Then I added canned vegetables and canned chicken. Of course fresh would be better - but I use what comes in the back door - so we get alot of canned items. The consistency is like thick gravy. Then I poured this mixture into my pans. I have a bakery mix that is much like Bisquick I used to make the biscuit mixture. In reading the other reviews I noticed that the same issue kept coming up - the biscuits were done on top but still gooey/runny on the bottom. So I made my biscuit mixture a little on the "sloppy" side - not runny like pancake batter - and not doughy like biscuit dough - but somewhere in the middle- "gloppy". Then I spooned the biscuit batter on top of the chicken mixture in spoonfuls that left about a inch space around the "glop" as the glop will rise and expand as it cooks. It is important to leave a little room around your glops as this allows the biscuits to cook through. I got sloppy with my glops on the last pan and put them too close together and they didn't cook all the way th

This recipe is excellent and was just what I was looking for -- I had no wish to use "whack-em-on-the-counter" biscuits like so many other recipes call for, and I didn't want to use pie dough. For those folks who had problems with the biscuits not being cooked on the bottom: prepare the biscuit dough BEFORE you make the chicken mixture, and be sure to preheat the oven so it's ready as soon as the chicken mixture is poured into the casserole dish and the biscuit dough is QUICKLY spooned on top.  The point of putting the biscuit dough on the HOT chicken mixture is to start cooking the biscuits immediately, so they don't get soggy on the bottom. This is why dumplings go into HOT stew, and cobbler dough goes onto HOT cooked fruit.

We love this recipe!  It's a wonderful way to use up leftover chicken.  I use frozen peas, but slice my own carrots and cook them for 5 min. first before adding them to the chicken mixture.  To cut down on preparation time, I used frozen biscuits.  I baked them on a separate pan at 375 degrees for only five minutes and then put them on the hot chicken mixture and baked at 425 degrees for 12 minutes.  Everything was perfect!  If you feel the biscuits are getting a little too brown, cover the dish with aluminum foil.  I served this with a mixed greens salad.  Fast, easy, and comforting with ingredients one generally has on hand.

Definitely a go-to recipe for leftover chicken.  I do make some changes, though: -I times it by 1.5 (x2 would be fine, too) and put it in a 13x9 dish -I use 1/2 butter, 1/2 olive oil (but I don't think you need to use as much as the recipe suggests) -I add thyme, sage, rosemary, and use white pepper vs. black, and next time I'll try garlic like one reviewer suggested. -I use frozen mixed veggies. -I use my own Betty Crocker baking powder biscuit recipe, cut out, place on top, and bake @ 375 for 40 minutes--comes out perfect every time.

This is the best chicken pie recipe I have ever tried.  I substitute Bisquick for the topping (for time's sake).  I have also topped it with a pie crust instead of the biscuits.  It tastes great both ways.

I preheated the oven at 450 degrees first, prepared the biscuit dough before I made the chicken mixture. I used fresh buttermilk and cold butter for the biscuit dough. I used half butter instead of all butter, low-sodium chicken broth and half-n-half milk for the chicken mixture. I use frozen peas with pearl onions, added diced celery, 1 medium orange, yellow and purple sweet carrots diced. For seasoning I added 1tsp of poultry seasoning, 1 garlic clove, chopped, fresh rosemary, fresh ground black pepper and Hawaiian sea salt.  As soon as I made the biscuit dough I quickly spooned them on top the HOT chicken mixture to start cooking the biscuits immediately. This helps avoid any soggy biscuits on the bottom. I had 12 biscuits spaced about 1 inch apart. I used a 13x9 dish and covered the dish with aluminum foil. I baked the chicken at 375 degrees for 30 minutes, turned off the oven, uncover the foil from pan, brushed the tops of biscuits with melted butter for a golden crust and left the mixture for 10 minutes before removing. The gravy was thick, creamy and savory! The chicken was tender and vegetables cooked just right. The biscuits were not soggy but golden brown, flaky and delicious. They rose and expanded while baking up almost touching each other. I served this chicken biscuit pie over a small mound of, “Creamy Smashed Potatoes,” also from this website. This is a true comfort food-very hearty, tasty and fulfilling.

This was pretty good.  I think the temp of the oven was too high though.  450 over browned the biscuits on top and left them slightly gooey on bottom.  I had to put back in the oven after the suggested amount of time.  Would probably lower the temp to 350 and bake longer.

Simple and good.  I used leftover turkey and added poultry seasoning.  Baked at 450F for 15 minutes, then left the mixture for another 15 minutes in the hot oven with the oven off and the door open before serving.  The biscuits were cooked through.  Will double the recipe next time.

I loved how this came out thick and very savory! I used flaky buttermilk biscuits from the store to save a little time and it worked wonderfully. I also did not have an onion so I simply skipped it.

This recipe is a good, basic pot pie.  I used mixed vegetables and refrigerator biscuits.  I added rosemary and thyme and baked them in individual souffle cups.  Quite tasty.

This has wonderful flavor and easy to make. I added other seasonings too.  It reminds me of those higher dollar store bought Chicken Pot Pies. I would definitely make it again.
  
Sorry!  No 'Kid Friendly Rating' because I don't have any.  But I were still a kid, I WOULD eat it.

Used less butter and added some olive oil instead of all butter. Low sodium-low fat chicken broth and fat free milk and low fat biscuit mix. Helped cut back on calories. Added some poultry seasoning and dry herbs to add to flavor to filling. Added steamed veges(just steamed a couple of minutes)  and chicken to pot and poured into covered casserole, shoved in oven while biscuits partially baked(hadn't started  to brown). Removed cover from casserole,  topped with biscuits and placed back in over to finish baking biscuits to golden. Came out pretty good. Will probably play with recipe. Maybe add seasonings to biscuit mix--garlic, chives, rosemary or tarragon. Maybe fat free shredded cheese. Luckily my husband will eat just about anything when I'm experimenting.

Had some leftover chicken so thought give it a go. I used the same ingredients, but in different order, I cooked the onions, with part of the butter, added the veg shortly after and cooked it . Once cooked added rest of butter, put flour in and made a roux. Then added broth, and milk and meat. Added bit of parsley and pepper for bit of taste as well. Put it in casserole dish, I made top as per he recipe, but didn't do biscuits, I mixed it up, rolled it out and put a full top on it.......was really good. OH TURN DOWN THE HEAT.  That has to be a typo, at that temp half will burn and other half raw. I cooked it at 375 for about 20-25 minutes and it was gorgeous.

I put a pie crust on the bottom, to give it a base so it didn't fall apart when it was dished up.  I used 2 cups of mixed veggies.  Rather then make the biscuits I just put Flaky Grands on top.  I found that the underside of the biscuit was still doughy so, I flipped the biscuits after they were browned and baked until the otherside was browned too.  The entire baking time was close to 50 minutes, but worth it.  The fam liked the changes and gobbled it up.  Repeat recipe here.

OK, 5 stars after minor tweeking .... I added thyme, oregano, and grated fresh garlic.   For the biscuit, I used Glutin Free Bisquick.  Hubby and I are totally jazzed with eating a biscuit topped casserole since we are (trying to be) GF.  This is comfort food!!!  So easy.  I will make this many times. ;)

As an apple crumble is to an apple pie, this recipe is to a pot pie. Unfortunately, this is a little on the bland side, although still enjoyable enough to try again with variations. I like that it tastes like a pot pie, but the biscuit mix as written isn't very exciting. Additionally, the ingredients should list 1/2 an onion as a whole onion ends up being more than either the carrots or peas! I like the idea of this, but I'm going to look for a different biscuit recipe and a chicken potpie filling to find how to make this better.

with added spice this is pretty good and easy to do.
I work at a day care center and I am the cook, very busy so I experimented with the topping a little 
I made a pancake batter without the sugar and vanilla, used egg whites, which I beat stiff first and than just gently fold it in the batter, you just pour it on top of you chicken mixture and voila

This is so much better than the traditional canned soup/bisquick recipe! I like using fresh vegetables instead of frozen, but the frozen isn't too bad either when I'm in a hurry. The only problem I always have is the biscuits don't bake all the way through and turn out really doughy, even if I bake it longer. From now on, I will do what others have suggested and bake the biscuits separately. A great, warming meal for winter!

I too, as some others pre-cooked the vegies. I did mine in the microwave to save time. Adding a few herbs I found this to be a very nice comfort food meal especially right now that we're ending autumn and entering winter. As you may guess, I live in the southern hemisphere of our world, so to people like "tat" just thank your lucky stars that you have Bisquick and Pillsbury's products to fall back on. I'm so glad that this recipe has the ingredients for the biscuits included as there are very few that do. I much rather recipes that has every thing from scratch rather than from packets or cans, that way I know there's no preservatives or artificial ingredients. Thankyou for sharing this heart warming meal with us.

The recipe was great, however, if I were to make it over I would cut the biscuit part in half.  There was way to much of the biscuit portion of the dish.

First try and it was SO good I took it to my Bro-in-law's while it was still hot. They couldn't stop eating it! Sis-in-law asked me to take it away as she is dieting!! I used some T-giving leftover turkey from my freezer and a crescent roll can that was about to expire.....FAN-tastic!!

Added some extra veggies (celery, corn, etc.) and used all milk rather than broth.  Kept biscuit dough gloppy, as suggested, and baked at 350 for 14 min.  450 would have been way too high a setting.  My kids LOVED this casserole.

This is really good! I did lower the oven temp, as others suggested, and it just took a little longer. The biscuit topping was perfect! I covered the whole top of the pie, leaving air holes for ventilation. I also sprinkled it with parmesean cheese and garlic salt. Oh, and don't forget to add garlic to the filling! It definitely helped to add flavor. I added corn from 2 ears of roasted corn, and maybe next time i'll add in some cooked potato cubes. You can really use whatever veggies you have on hand that you want to use up!

This was a hit for my family. I made it exactly as the recipes calls for . The only thing I changed was I baked it about 5-6 minutes longer after reading some of  the reviews.  The biscuits came out perfect for me. I did hesitate and almost  used frozen biscuits, but decided to give this recipe a full shot!! I'm so glad that I did because it was perfect for us. Thanks!!

Love this recipe!  Very quick.  Using a large silver pan, doubled the recipe, but added a few dashes of garlic salt, a few more dashes of pepper an extra 1/2 cup of broth.  Also, instead of making the biscuit dough, used two cans of Grands biscuits (8 in each; use plain, not butter flavor).  The Grands calls for a 350 degree oven and the recipe calls for a 450 degree oven so I just placed a piece of foil on top of the biscuits after 10 minutes (did not tighten) because they browned too fast.  I turned the oven off to let the dish sit for about 20 minutes in the heat.  Next time I will bake using the instructions on the biscuit can.  This is recipe is indeed a keeper!  Will probably use Grands Jr. biscuits or regular sized biscuits next time (two cans of smaller sized biscuits for doubling the recipe should be perfect and without too much bread).

Very very good. A touch bland if you don't add a few extra spices, as others have suggested.

This tasted absolutely delicious and is actually somewhat simple-this is coming from someone in the process of developing cooking skills. :) I did add fresh carrots instead of frozen and will not use frozen peas next time.  Also, I added more milk to the biscuit mix because it was not very moist. After cooking the suggested length of time, I turned the oven down to 350 and cooked until the biscuits were cooked through. Overall, this dish tasted wonderful...and I look forward to making it in the winter months by adding potatoes and garlic seasoning.

Very good. After reading reviews I cooked Bisquick biscuits separately and poured mixture over them. Next time I will add more spices, seemed a little bland. I also only had fresh carrots so I steamed them beforehand.

This is an EASY meal that tastes great. The only thing I would do different next time is double or at least increase by half, the sauce. The biscuits are great, but would be even better with more gravy.

I thought it was awesome. I added some rosemary and some thyme to the biscuit mixture. I myself love the "wet" mixture so I would maybe double that next time. And also set the oven at 375 and bake for at least 20 minutes so the biscuits get done evenly.

Super easy and versatile recipe.  I added potatoes and used boxed biscuit mix for the biscuit topping.  My pie lacked flavoring so I had to add quite a bit of salt and pepper.  Will make again!

I felt there was too much onion flavor, a little over powering. I'll adjust next time. I used my own go to biscuit "bisquick" mix for the biscuits, I also used mix veggies instead of just carrots and peas, so it would more of a traditional pot pie. The flavor is nice, just cut the onions by 1/2 so you still get the flavor, but not overpowering. Also, if you add 2 small cubed potatoes to this boil them a bit first in the broth to help soften ahead of time. Some recipes you can just add in, but since this one thickens before the oven and only bake 12 or so mins, the potatoes, no matter how small won't cook all the way through...duh! Oops! LOL Also, I think this would do better baking at a slightly lower temp, 425 or so, the biscuits browned to quickly before the filling started bubbling. Slower is better, especially if you add potatoes. ;)

I initially received this recipe from the weekly newsletter & decided I would try it out at home. I like to get creative with my pantry ingredients so I decided to use things that I already had. We scaled the recipe to four servings & it fit perfectly in a 2QT casserole dish & didn't bubble over. We cooked it at 450 for 18 minutes as it seemed to be undercooked at 12 minutes. The biscuits turned out perfectly. Golden brown on top while light & fluffy on the inside. I used margarine instead of butter & a 12oz frozen bag of mixed vegetables & also a 12.5oz can of chicken chunks that I shredded in place of the chicken. It all turned out great!

Great dish for leftover chicken...I added a bit more seasoning to perk up the flavor. I used a little Bell's seasoning and some celery seed.

This is excellent!!!  I made a few changes... started by sauteing some onion, celery, and fresh carrots until tender and then adding flour and making the sauce.  I used a bit more chicken broth and milk to make more gravy..  its awesome.  My entire family loves it.

My husband said this recipe is a keeper!  He complimented me the whole evening for such a delicious meal.  Quick note:  I used a meat mallet to make the chicken breasts 1/4" thick, then drenched them in olive oil, salt and pepper.  After 20 min. in the oven, at 375 degrees, I chopped them and tossed them in the skillet and continued on with the recipe.  The recipe took about 35 min to finish.  Thank you for such a wonderful recipe!

My husband and I really liked how this turned out.  I did cut the amount of fat to cook the onions in 1/2 and changed it to olive oil and also used low fat bisquick to top it to help reduce the total fat content.  Both worked fine, but the underpart of the center of the biscuits were not 100% done, so in the future I will lower the temp and cook longer.  We definately plan to use this recipe again!

Good tasting, inexpensive and easy to make.  As an aside, you can also cook the biscuits seperately a d place them on top.  This allows you to brown the bottoms.  But good either way.

This recipe turned out very well for me.  I completely eliminated step #3, by using refrigerated Pillsbury Grands Buttermilk Biscuits (which I took out of the fridge and separated beforehand...so that they wouldn't be too cold when I put them on top of the casserole).  I also added a small clove of finely minced garlic, and I used 2 cups of frozen peas & carrots which came in one bag (not separately).  This dish was very easy to prepare, and I'll definitely be making it  again.  We all loved it!

I have made this for years, prepare the gravy and vegetables on top of the stove in a dutch oven and bring to a boil, add which ever biscuits you want on top of the boiling gravy and put immediately in the oven at the temperature you bake biscuits.  Biscuits will be done and brown on top every time.

We thought this was a really tasty recipe...and I was THRILLED to not use fake canned soup or biscuits!! Followed the recipe to a T except to substitute real butter for shortening in the biscuit dough. I didn't have any problems with soggy dough. I put together the dry ingredients for the biscuits before doing anything else. Then when the chicken mixture was ready (and hot), I mixed the milk into the dry biscuit ingredients and quickly put on top and got it into the oven. Baked at 450F for 15 minutes (we are at high altitude so that works good here). Will definitely make this again...great way to use up left over roasted chicken.

Instead of dropping the biscuit batter into the vegetable mixture, we made the mixture and the biscuits separate so that my family an I  could make little "sloppy joes". Also we did not even use this the recipe for these biscuits bout another one we found in a cook book so that they would cook at the right temp. and turn out to be the right consistency. I really don't think it matters what kind of biscuits you make, but another plus about making the biscuits separate is that you get to eat the leftover ones in the morning toasted with jam or honey!

My biscuits were too brown on top, completely undercooked and runny underneath, there was too much biscuit in comparison to the filling, and not enough sauce.  Followed the recipe as written.

This was tasty and pretty easy.  My husband loved it.  However, I had to bake it significantly longer than the instructions indicated to get the biscuits cooked all the way through.  Other than that, very good!

I enjoyed this but I changed the sauce. I used 1 can cream of chicken soup and 1 can cream of onion soup. It was really good.

Delicious! I didn't change anything about the recipe beyond following KitchenWitch's advice, and used margarine instead of shortening, as well as unsalted butter - also, no onion, just because I didn't have any. Boyfriend was a HUGE fan, almost looking forward to winter so I can make this on a chilly Sunday!

I used the basic ideas here, but did change the recipe quite a bit.  I doubled the recipe for two families, used more chicken, frozen mixed vegetables, and canned biscuits to make it all faster and easier.  The biscuits, I pulled in half horizontally, and they seemed to bake through quite well.  I baked the dish at 350 for about 40 minutes.  I used large enough casserole dishes that the mixture didn't bubble over in the oven, which is always a good thing.  It turned out really good and a satisfying comfort food.

Great recipe.  The biscuits got done all the way through and on the bottom, no problem with them being soggy. My husband said over and over what a great dish it was. Even my two year old ate it, and he is really picky.

Great meal. I used butter instead of shortening in the biscuit topping, roasted the carrots  and I also added cubed cooked potatoes. I would make this again.

This was absolutely wonderful!! I doubled the recipe and we didn't have one bite left!! I didn't put it in a casserole though with home made biscuits, I made Grands Flaky Biscuits and laid them open-faced and put the chicken mixture on top! OMG it was wonderful!

After adding additional spices for flavor and cutting the butter in the sauce in half and cooking at 400 degrees for 25 minutes - it turned out nicely.  All and all it's not exactly healthy but it's nice comfort food.

Exactly what I wanted.  Added celery and carrots to the sauteed onions.  Awesome biscuits.  I too had the doughy biscuit problem noted by other reviewers, even after making the biscuit dough before the filling and adding to hot filling.  Turned off the oven and left the dish in the warm oven for about 10 more minutes and the doughy problem rectified itself.  As a vegetarian, it's hard to find satisfying winter comfort food, so I subbed in seitan and "not-chicken" broth.  Stored leftover filling in separate container than biscuits and reheated in the toaster oven.  Perfect snowy comfort food!

Very good!  I used this recipe more as a guideline, as I tweaked it quite a bit for my own family's preferences (ie:  I used only peas).  i also added some wine to the broth and used cornstarch to thicken rather than flour.  I also added some herbs de provence and tarrogon to make it a little more complex.  It was a good basic recipe, though, and the drop biscuits on top were very yummy.  It's a good and satisfying dish.

Was very good. Only thing I would change is to lower the temperature to about 375 depending on what you are cooking in. Enjoy!

This was a very quick and tasty meal.  My son (who does not like meat) had seconds.  I would have given this 5 stars but I did make some substitutions.   I make the biscuit mix first so the mix would have extra time to get fluffy.  I added extra milk so the biscuit mix was more like VERY thick pancake mix.  I used 1/2 bag of mixed veggies. I brined 2 chicken breasts (15 min,) and cooked them on my Foreman grill and added them cubed.  I put the chicken mix in a 9x13 cake pan and added dollops of the biscuit mix (allowing room for spread).  I covered the pan in tin foil the first 1/2 of the bake time (this make the biscuits cook through but prevented the tops from becoming too cripsy.  Next time I will double the Chicken stew mix for a 9x13 pan.

This is a great option when you want chicken pot pie, but don't want to spend the time on a from scratch recipe.  Husband and I were watching a food show about chicken pot pie and he asked if we could have it for dinner.  Had everything on hand for this and it was delicious.  I used refrigerated biscuits that I baked while getting the chicken mixture together.  Diced fresh carrots worked well - just microwaved them for 3 minutes before adding to mix.  You should definitely double if you have a family of 4 or more.

This turned out pretty good but I had to add some seasonings to it for flavor.  The biscuits were tasty but like other reviews I had to turn the temp down and cook longer otherwise the tops would burn and the bottoms would be doughy.  Next time I will add some cheddar cheese to the chicken mixture too for more flavor.  2nd time used refrigerated biscuits but still had some trouble with them cooking through.  Added thyme and some chicken seasoning.  Forgot to add the cheese but it tasted quite good with the addition of the seasoning.

Excellent! I used two cups fresh carrots, and cooked the chicken breasts in chicken broth, onions and pepper, then used that broth for the recipe. I had to add a little more broth in the end to thin it out a bit. I made this on top of the stove, and used Bisquick for the dumplings. I'll keep this one!

mmm good! a nice winter comfort food. As good as any store bought pot pie, and easy to make as well. I only had canned carrots an peas, and it still turned out delicious, and I used a can of biscuits for the top layer, all I did was unroll them and flatten them out some and press them along the edges of the dish and it turned out great. This is a keeper:-)

Very good.  Based on other reviews, I made the following changes:  2 TBL butter and 2 TBL olive oil (in place of the 1/3 cup butter).  I used onion flakes instead of fresh (I put them into the broth and milk, and poured it into the simmering oil/butter/flour mix).  I used seasoned salt instead of regular salt, and added a generous dash of dried italian seasoning.  I reduced the amount of frozen peas and carrots (I used fresh) to a half-cup each, and added a small can of corn.  I used Bisquick Heart Smart mix for the biscuits.  To keep the biscuits from browning too fast, I covered them with foil that had been sprayed with cooking oil.  I cooked the pie for at least 20 min, and then took off the foil and let it cook for 10 min more.  The biscuits were cooked all the way through.  The time on the recipe would be way too short.

My kids ate it, which is a huge plus for me!

This was a BIG hit at our house.  The only change that I made was to use frozen green beans instead of peas, because that's what I had in the freezer.  I made it a day ahead and put it in the refrigerator.  It took a long time to cook (45 minutes??) since it was cold, but it was worth the wait!!

Very delicious!  I added some extra seasonings, including some rosemary and thyme.  And I had to cook it much longer than it said to get the biscuits done on the bottom, but it turned out great!  I will make this again.

Added about a tablespoon of basil to the biscuits and used a bag of mixed veggies from the frozen aisle. This is the third time I've made this and it never disappoints. Made a bit of rice to go along with it. Delicious.

My family and our guests love this recipe with a few tweaks. I sauté celery with the onion. We don't like peas so I substitute a can of green beans and we add corn. I used canned carrots instead of frozen. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe!!

This was very good. I made a few changes,cutting the carrots and peas in half and adding corn and celery. I was tempted to use can biscuits,but followed the directions and am glad I did,as it was different than a can biscuit. Before putting the dough mixture on top,I topped the filling with cheddar cheese,then the dough mixture.

My wife and I loved this recipe.  I used bone in skin on chicken thighs and slow cooked them until I could shred the meat.  I added corn and green beans to the suggested carrots and peas.  I used butter tasting Grands for the biscuits.  I preheated it in a microwave prior to cooking in the oven.  I baked it at 350 until the biscuits were golden brown.

I made this for 80+ at a Residential Environmental Education Center and it worked great! I did add some herbs to the sauce to up the flavor and took the advice of others and made my biscuit mix a little on the thin side so it would cook through. Everyone liked it and I'll make it again for work and I'm making it again at home tonight!

I made this today for Sunday dinner.  SUPER EASy.  however, because we like substance, I diced very fine 2 potatoes.  I also added fresh parsley.  My husband is not a big chicken fan, but this he really enjoyed.  We have a bit leftover, (enough for dinner later this week) and he asked for this to be put over rice.  I think the next time I make this, I may try using mashed potatoes over top like a shepherds pie.

Excellent recipe!  First time ever for me to make a chicken pot pie-just fear of it I guess-and it came out not only beautiful to look at but absolutely delicious!  The only major change I made is I used roll-out prepared pie crust, made my own chicken broth from boiling the chicken, added a small can of corn and seasoned with granulated garlic.  The flavor  and consistency of the cream sauce was wonderfully perfect!  I also baked at 400 F for 35 minutes...for a nice medium golden brown.  Thanks so much for the recipe!  ;)

My grandmother from Italy used to make her chicken pie doing the exact same thing as this and it was always delicious.  I follow this same method and the only difference is that I use Bisquick to make the biscuits.  A little healthier and more convenient.  It's great any time of the year.

Kept the integrity of the base recipe except left out the salt. I thought it had enough salt from the broth.  Did add kale and broccoli. Very good.

I would make this again. I like to poach or bake several chicken breasts at one time. Then shred it, divide it  into quart size bags and freeze. Cuts down on prep time for this recipe. Leftovers are good, too. I will also say that Allrecipes.com is among the top sites I look at for something new to make! I've saved this recipe and many others!

My family really enjoyed this meal! I did use refrigerated biscuits for the sake of time (I have 3 kids under the age of 5). The sauce was savory and thick and my kids even ate the veggies! Will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe with a bit of tweaking. I don’t use all the butter listed, and usually add chopped carrot and celery with the onions.  Roughly, I make approximately double the chicken mixture to make enough for two meals. For seasoning I add  garlic powder, thyme and rosemary. 
I keep the biscuit part as per recipe except to add parsley for colour. I use a 9x13 pan.
I also follow other reviewers who ensure the chicken mixture is piping hot and to allow space between biscuits to allow for expansion. Tonight I cooked at 400 instead of 450 as other reviewers they were too dark but raw inside at 450.

Would've gotten 5 stars if the biscuits hadn't started to burn on top. I used a mixed frozen vegetable bag so there were also green beans and corn which was good. I cut back on the onion to a half onion and added garlic salt to the vegetable gravy mix.

It was delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but I had to put back in the oven for another 10 min at 350 degrees because the biscuit didn't feel like it was fully cooked. Also, next time, I think I'll use only half an onion and add more veggies... Other than that, it was a hit!!!

This is a good basic recipe. I usually use 2 cups of frozen mixed veggies and also add poultry seasoning, thyme and oregano along with the pepper and a little salt to the sauce mixture.

My Mom use to make this as my favorite dish when I was little.  This recipe has come the closest to what my Mom made and I have made abt 20 different chicken & biscuit dishes. I used fresh carrots & celery which I cooked with the onions first, then added the flour and everything else, frozen peas last and throughly heat before I put in the casserole dish. I made Bisquick biscuits (not dumplings) and placed on top, cooked at 375 for 45 minutes in my gas oven. The biscuits came out perfect and my family loved it!

Added more salt some sage, mushroom and substituted fresh biscuit for Pillsbury grand biscuits. I also used all fresh produce baked 375 for 20 mins biscuits cooked to bottom.......comfort food at its finest, Enjoy.......

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. I made a whole chicken in the crockpot yesterday, but we ended up not being home for dinner. So, I deboned it and used that chicken in this recipe. 
I made just a few changes, and it was perfect for us.   
I only used 1/4 of an onion.  I also didn't have any frozen veg in the house, so I used 1 can of peas (drained) and some cut up fresh carrots that I steamed in the microwave for 3 minutes before adding to the mixture. 
I also used the drop biscuit recipe from the side of the side of te Bisquick box instead of using the biscuit dough from this recipe. 
The only other change I made, was to add 10 minutes to the cook time.

Very good and hearty.  I added 1/2 chopped red pepper with the onion and added 1/2 c. lowfat sour cream just before topping it with the biscuits and also added about 1/2 t. of seasoned salt.  I used Schwan's frozen southern style biscuits and it was delicious on a cold winter Sunday evening.

This was so good and perfect for a cold Winter day. I added some chopped celery and fresh chopped carrots along with the onions. I also added some sage which gave it a great flavor. I'm a vegetarian so I used vegetable broth and vegetarian chicken pieces. I baked it at 400 degrees for about 20 minutes. I did find the biscuit topping to be a little undercooked like other reviewers, but it was still very good. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love chicken pot pie and this is the best recipe I've made.  The flavor was excellent and the biscuits perfect...I did add a bit of cheese to them.   Delicious!!

This was absolutely fantastic! The gravy is creamy and the biscuits are flaky and delicious. My family and I devoured it. We had no leftovers.

I love this recipe!  I cooked my whole chicken in the crockpot all day with onions and carrots and use the broth, carrots and onions in the recipe.  I also add a couple pinches of rosemarry and garlic powder.  It is divine!
I would recommend following the advice of lowering the temperature to 350 or 375 for 40 minutes.  Biscuits will turn out perfect this way.

I added some fresh thyme and used raw bone-in skin-on chicken, simmering it in the thickened broth until cooked, then putting it in the oven. I also used butter in the biscuits because I didn't have any shortening. I loved the recipe: perfect and simple. I took others' advice and covered the pan for 10 minutes, then took off the lid for another 10. The biscuits were cooked all the way through and brown on top.

The biscuits were mushy on the bottom but cooked on the top.  If I made this again, I would cook the biscuits separately from the chicken mixture.

Great taste and a definite favorite with the kids (my ultimate food critics).  Use only peas and carrots for the veges.   Very authentic flavor.

I made this last night and we couldn't get enough of it!! I used ready-made biscuit dough and frozen mixed veggies to add some extra types of veggies in there. After 12 minutes on 450 the biscuits were pretty brown, next time I'll probably cut down the temp to 425 and go from there.

My husband and son loved this recipe.  Next time, I will add some steamed celery and a little more chicken broth; found the filling a little dry.  I also added a drained 4 oz can of sliced mushrooms to the recipe.  The casserole dish was empty within 30 minutes.  Will definitely make again.

This is a wonderful recipe. My whole family gave it two thumbs up. I did make a couple changes, I used my own biscuit recipe, added some corn, did not put any peas in it and I did what some of the other suggested and baked it for 40 minutes at 350. This recipe is now in my usual menu rotation. Thanks.

Yum!  We really enjoyed it and it was a lot easier than the recipe that I usually use.  I used fresh carrots and potatoes cut into small chunks - cooked for about 8 minutes and then drained - added them to the chicken/pea/gravy mixture.  I also had left over gravy from night #1 chicken - added that.  I put in a 13 x 9 pan.  Used puff pastry instead of biscuits.  It was yummy!

I thought this was delicious and had no problems with the biscuit recipe as written, though many have opted to substitute it.  I much preferred the taste of these biscuits to Bisquick.  Thanks!

This is the first time that I have rated a recipe on this site, and I have tried a lot of them!  My whole family loved this recipe. I used the basics but also added mushrooms, broccoli and corn for our personal taste.  I also topped with crescent rolls instead of biscuits.  Will use this recipe again and again, especially as a new mom dinner!

This recipe is great! I futzed with it a bit: used green onions, mock (vegetarian) chicken, green beans, leeks, and leftover potato hashbrowns - which was an excellent combination. I also added three cloves of garlic to the green onions, because I love garlic. I ended up doubling the recipe and it turned out beautifully, although I only multiplied the Bisquick ratio by 1.5, which produced just the right amount of biscuit topping. I ended up baking the thing for about 18 minutes at 450. It made a lot of food, but it's so tasty that I won't mind the leftovers! I will make this again.

All I have to say is yummo! I gave it four stars because I did cut the biscuit ingredients in half. It was too much dough for us. I also would not recommend using canned biscuits. Take the few extra minutes and make your own, it tastes so much better!

I made this, and my family loves it - my children just can not get enough of it. I do make a few changes, i use fresh chopped carrots, and i put them in the pot at the same time that cook the onions. I also add some cut out boiled potatoes at the same time that i toss in the chicken. It is wonderful. Thanks so much for this favorite family recipe!

This was really delicious! For some reason mine came out just a bit dry, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. Next time I make it I'll probably increase the fluid a bit. It's definitely a keeper and worth working with, though!

This has become a favorite in my house.  I always double the recipe and use a 9 X 13 dish.  Sometimes I mix up the vegetables a bit and use something different.  I almost never have leftover chicken so I just cook some frozen boneless skinless chicken breasts in a mixture of chicken broth, water, celery, onion, carrot, garlic, and whatever else I feel like throwing in.  After the chicken is cooked I use that liquid in the gravy part of this recipe.  For the biscuits I use half butter, half olive oil (as another reviewer suggested), mix some summer savoury in with the dry ingredients, and cut out biscuits instead of dropping the dough by spoonfuls on top.  I usually make this at least once a week.  I'm getting hungry just writing about it, lol.

My husband and I LOVE this recipe!  (I use packaged biscuits.)  The only thing I would change is the amount of onion I use - the first time I made it I used a whole onion and it seemed like way too much.  The second time I used half of a small onion and it was a lot better.  Next time I'll probably double the recipe and make it in a bigger pan so we'll have more leftovers to eat!  YUM!

We loved this! It was great comfort food.  I added poultry seasoning when I added the salt and pepper; I think it would have been a little bland if had I not done this.  I used Bisquick for the biscuits which tasted great.  However, like previous reviews, my biscuits failed to cook on the bottom as well.  When they were golden on top I just flipped them upside down and cooked for another 5-7 minutes until they were cooked through.  That solved the problem and they tasted great.  Next time I will probably pre-cook the biscuits for a couple of minutes before I place them on top.

Recipe was good, I left out the veggies, my husband prefers them on the side, I cooked my chicken in a little olive oil, salt and pepper and instead of making the bisciuts I used refrigerated biscuit dough and cut them in half. My husband loved it and it was great reheated later.

Great comfort food.  I've made it with ham as well and it's just as good.  Sometimes I use celery rather than peas, and sometimes I add grated cheese to the biscuits

This is a great chicken and biscuits recipe. I double the biscuits and cook half separately, as my kids also love them with jam or honey. It's a pretty fast recipe and nice since it contains all food groups so I don't have to make anything else on a crazy night.

I used the refrigerated biscuits in lieu of making my own hoping to save on time.  The biscuits never cooked!  I had to take them off the top and cook them on their own so they could finally finish.  It may have been something I did though, but it turned out well anyway.  We ended up just scooping the mixture over the biscuits.

This was delicious!!! I did make the following changes: I used bisquick to make the biscuits (same outcome and much easier!), and in addition to the salt and pepper I added plenty of poultry seasoning (mine has garlic, oregano, thyme, and other chicken spicing herbs). This was so good my whole family ate it right up!

Very yummy and easy to make.  Even better heated up the next day.  I used chicken broth with roasted vegetables and herbs, it added an extra layer of flavor.

Easy and tasty.  I used the Grand Biscuits and split them in half and added a little cheese.  I thought I had some frozen veggies, and found out in the middle, that I only had broccoli, add that plus some canned green beans and corn. It was really good.

We've loved this recipe for a long time and finally got around to rating it.  It's really creamy and we love the biscuits on top.  I add a little shredded cheese, because we are cheese nuts, but other than that, we follow it exactly.

MMMMM-mmm.  Wow.  My husband would've eaten the whole thing if he could've.  The biscuits made the dish, I wouldn't use store bought ones.  We had to use canned peas and cook fresh carrots.  I wouldn't change a thing!  We will eat this quite often.

We add more veggies prior to adding the chicken.  In addition, we bake the biscuits separately.  When we baked the pot pie with the biscuit on top, it seemed to draw out the moisture from the pie.

This recipe is delicious!  I’m vegetarian, so I substituted vegetable broth in place of the chicken broth.  I also add diced potatoes right when I add in the broth & milk, and use frozen mixed vegetables instead of just peas & carrots.  I take a small amount out to cook in a separate dish for myself before adding the chicken in for the rest of my family.  I also use organic canned biscuits instead of making them from scratch to save on time.  This is a favorite at our house!

Will definitely make this again.  As recommended by others, I turned the temperature down to 375 and covered with foil.  Great way to use up that leftover rotisserie chicken.  Used fresh carrots, added a little celery, fresh garlic and some thyme.  I cheated... and used a biscuit mix.  Came out perfectly...yum!!

Really really really good! Down home comfort food! I used a package of frozen mixed vegetables instead of the peas and carrots and topped it with my own biscuit recipe. I had to bake it about 18 more minutes to get the biscuits done. I will be making this often.

I have 3 teenagers and not one complained about this. I cheated and used Grands Biscuits because it was easy and other reviews complained about soggy biscuits. Other then that it was a great way to use up leftover chicken and quick and easy to the table. Will make this one again for sure.

Yummy kid pleasing dish. On the dinner spinner app the recipe says 2 cups flour for the "filling" part of this recipe I checked it against the recipe on the website because it sounded wrong. It is. It really calls for 1/3 cup flour.

I love chicken pot pie so I thought I would try this. I had tried a different chicken and biscuit recipe and the biscuits prevented the dish from properly cooking. I made 2 changes to this recipe. I used 2 cups of frozen mixed vegetables and I used "ready-made" pie dough (not ready-made pie shells). It turned out fabulous. It was exactly what I wanted. This is a keeper.

I made it twice.  The second time was better, cooking the chicken medley beforehand and just baking biscuits after that to avoid the doughy problem we encountered and many identified.  Also added 25% more veggies and chicken which improved volume and consistency.

I made a change I did not like, I had a bunch of organic "rainbow" carrots on hand, and next time will use only orange carrots.  the purple hued carrots, while very sweet, changed the color of the sauce to a purplish brown, reminiscent of adding mushrooms to a white sauce. (grandkids do NOT prefer this color :))

I used rice flour and made rice flour buscuits as we are gluten free - that turned out great.  the box of organic chicken broth I used was too brown and and smelled of onion (we don't eat much onion either) so next time, I would make homemade broth or use a canned broth that is yellow colored (Swanson's) instead of brown.   Still is was all gone in minutes!  Thanks!  Oh, and I added thyme to the carrots and celery while they precooked.

Made a similar recipe to this one with cream of chicken soup, frozen mixed veggies and puff pastry.  My kids loved this one.  I thought it was lighter and  very simple to make.  I added spices like rosemary and thyme.  Definitely will make it again.

I have made this several times, and it is a huge hit in my family. My brother tells me that it's his favorite dinner, and always requests that I make it. I sometimes double the recipe and put the mixture in a 13 by 9 inch casserole dish.

Family LOVED this!
I seasoned with Sage, Thyme, garlic salt & cracked pepper.  Mine took longer to bake as I didnt  have the biscuit dough ready - so would recommend having that at the shortning stage before starting.   I think the chicken mix cooled a lot while I measured & mixed.
Used a strong broth also.

We made this using canned biscuits and it was delicious.  I did add a couple spices for extra flavor- sage, thyme and garlic, and aside from that it was excellent comfort food at its best, and very easy.

The only thing I changed was I added a can of mushroom soup and used a little corn starch instead of flour to thicken it. My family absolutely raved about it! Will certainly make it again!

Great take on a pot pie style dish. Added fresh corn off one Cobb and used fresh carrots also. I cooked three chicken breasts with seasoning and shredded them. And made a bisquick style biscuit to drop on top.

I like this. I made it exactly as the recipe listed expect I made the biscuits first so they were placed on top of the hot mixture to help start cooking the bottom of the biscuits. The biscuits were not fully cooked through but I think I did something wrong as the dough was not as moist as it should have been and did not spread out as much during cooking as I thought they would. 

I have attempted chicken pot pie previously but the mixture was always runny. This recipe created a wonderfully thick mixture. I will work on getting the biscuits correct the next time.

Made it almost as written, but time was short so used the store bought Buttermilk biscuits in Grand size.  Would be better with my own herb biscuits.  Good roux to hold everything together, not layered with flavor, but ok.  Might want to use a bit of sautéed celery with the whole onion next, and add some parsley from the garden, chopped.  Used 3 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, a bit more than 2 cups.  Bought the frozen carrots and peas mixed in one bag, and used 2 cups total.  Pic shows corn, and that would be a nice addition next time.  But reduce the other veggies, since veggie to roux is a good balance as written.  Maybe a cubed, cooked potato too? Will try it again in cooler weather.

I did use store bought biscuits. Then I let the chicken mixture just cook on top of the stove for a few minutes until the vegetables were tender. I then served it on top of the bottom half of the biscuit and placed  the other biscuit half on top, more like the photo shows. Delicious.

Very good.  Used canned buttermilk biscuits on boiling chicken/veg, then they won't be raw.  Added poultry seasoning to taste and less onion.

I had lots of chicken and 5 people to feed so I doubled the flour and broth.  I wish I had doubled the peas and carrots.
10.5 X 14.75  2.25 backing dish allowed lots of room.
Cooked at 370 for 30 then kicked it to 440 to get dumplings browned. Everyone who ate it loved it.

Add to the biscuit mix a little poultry seasoning or just sage AND chicken bullion as part of the salt.  I  agree with the spooning on w spaces in between and a little gloppy. But to prevent sogginess/undone on the bottom of the biscuit spoon on the mix after the the meat mixture is already bubbling hot

This one is OK as written, but I found it on the bland side. So, I added garlic powder (a must), onion powder, and a little thyme to liven it up. I can't give you measurements because I added a little bit at a time, but it made a huge difference. I also chopped one celery stalks and threw it in.

Quite a decent recipe. Gave new life to leftover roast chicken. Used fresh diced carrots because I had them, but should have sauteed them with the onions though as they were a tad crunchy still. Although as a timesaver, frozen is best. Did take other review suggestions to add my own seasoning - garlic powder, poultry seasoning, basil, thyme and rosemary. Would definitely do again!

Quite good.  I have zero experience making biscuits or pie crust, so wasn't expecting much. I was probably a bit lazy about cutting in the cold butter - my crumbs were larger. I needed a bit more milk for the dough to come together.  I kept my drops of dough on the smaller size and they cooked up just right.

I'd make this again. Next time definitely adding garlic and dijon mustard.  Maybe add something to the biscuit mix.. make with buttermilk?

I really like this because I have all these ingredients at home and when I make huge batches of cooked chicken at a time I can make this with leftovers.

Very easy and delicious.  I used 4 chicken breasts that I had cooked in the slow cooker and then diced some and put some in the chopper.  Probably 3 would have been plenty.  Used 2 cups of frozen peas and carrots.  Added a little onion powder and some poultry seasoning.  Used Grands biscuits on top.  Husband said it was excellent pot pie.

I tweeked this a bit . I added some spices, fresh mushrooms, 2 large cans chunk chicken, half an onion, the rest of the ingredients and baked in 2 1/2 qt round casserole dish.  I put a pie crust on the bottom and up the sides of the dish and made the biscuit recipe from Bisquick Reduced Fat and spread it all over the top of the mixture.  Good.  Very filling.

Really good, especially for a base recipe. I felt there was too much biscuit for the chicken&veggies, but my husband said it was "perfect" so, there's that. :)

Also, it took MUCH longer than 12-15 minutes to cook, more like 20-25, and to be honest could have used a few more minutes.

Overall though we both really really enjoyed it. This recipe lends itself to improvisation which is handy for the style.

This has good bones. I made only a few changes as far as flavor to my liking and rolled out the biscuit and laid it on top.  It came out so good. Have made it a lot. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made this in a large casserole dish, so I bumped the chicken stock to 2 cups and the milk to 1 cup. I didn't measure the chicken, but it was probably more than 2 cups. I skipped the peas and added potatoes instead. As one diner can't have pepper, I let people add the salt and pepper at the table. The carrots added some color to the dish, but next time I think I'll use purple potatoes for a less bland appearance.

Not that flavorful. The recipe called for too much flour, the gravy ended up clumpy and more solid. Also too much onion. It has potential bit even the biscuits need more flavor.

The "guts" of this are amazing! I cut some time off and used Grands biscuits on top and it took longer to bake. Next time I would probably cut the biscuits in quarters and place them on top. The bottoms were doughy.

My adult family of 5 loved it! Gone! Only a couple small changes, a bit more milk, added garlic. I used premade fridge (pop open) biscuits.  The tops browned nicely, but bottoms were not 100% cooked. When the brown was right, I covered loosely w/ foil and gave it a few more minutes. Perfect. Thank you!

This a good recipe! I was looking for a creamy comfort food option but as I have been dairy free for a few months, I have missed many creamy meals. This recipe works well with rice milk instead of regular in making the "gravy". I did use a little cornstarch along with th flour, but I was glad it turned out! I also used rice milk in the biscuits as well.

This was very good.  Except I took the advice of other reviewers and baked it with Pillsbury biscuit at 350 for 45 minutes.   My biscuits came out hard.  Next time I'll just leave in oven for 30 minutes.  I'll definitely make again!

Delicious! As other reviewers suggested, I made the biscuits first. It was a good call since it prevented juggling duties when everything was hot. I cut a third of the butter and added sage. I will probably add some mushrooms the next time I make it. All in all, this is an incredibly tasty "stick to your ribs" meal.

I made this style of a dish based off this recipe. I needed a starting point to guide me and this was a wonderful canvas. I added,all fresh, mushrooms, onions, celery,potatoes,carrots a dash of garlic along with my chicken. I used the basic biscuit recipe from here because it is my favorite. It came out  awesome none left!

I made it and liked it but did add some things ~ celery seed and cubed yukon gold potatoes.  I brought the potatoes to a boil and boiled for a few minutes before adding to the mixture. I also increased the chicken broth and milk.  I noticed the biscuits browned fast so I covered them with foil around 8 min and finished cooking them with the foil on for a few more minutes.  I used the refrigerator biscuits and rotisserie chicken.  A small onion would do as well, no need to use a big onion.  I used a bigger dish as well.  I would definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly and found it lacked flavor.  If I make it again, I would cut down on the peas...way too many for a single recipe.  I would enhance the flavor with a tsp.  of "Better Than Bouillon" chicken base.Other than that it is very filling.

one of the best things I've made from this site.  Being lazy, I used frozen vegetables, cooked through in the microwave.  I also used canned biscuits, so I turned the oven down to 350* and baked 18 min by the directions on the biscuits.  I cook for two, so these leftovers are welcomed

Really enjoyed this but next time will make a few changes. i used a med-lge sweet white onion and it was a bit too much, and for me there is never enough onion but will use small-med next time. if i use frozen veggies next time i will defrost them 1st. i used a whole chicken i needed to cook and seasoned it under the skin with an herb rub i put together. worked out really well and i made a double serving. used refrigerator biscuits only because i had them but bisquick would be great too. diced potatoes for me, next time as well--just my personal preference. oh yea, made the apple crumble pie to go with it for dessert and the girls at card night loved it all! great for leftovers!

This was very easy, and tastes great! I enjoyed making this meal. I added more veggies because I sneak them in whenever I can. Instead of chicken I used buffalo meat because it is lower in cholesterol than chicken, changed to vegetable broth too. When served I heard, "Wow! Super good!" I will definitely make this again.

This is a good base recipe.  To make it 5 stars, definitely increase seasoning and switch up the vegetables.  To make this diet friendly and tastier, I used California style vegetables (no corn), seasoned salt, lots of black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder and ancho chile powder and shredded rotisserie chicken.  Then used CarbQuick low carb flour to make the biscuit crust.  I left the flour mixture crumbly then just crumbled it on top.  It cooked perfectly at the listed temperature and time.  Husband and I both thought this turned out amazing with those changes.

The only thing I would really change is using more seasonings. I also used frozen biscuits.

I followed this recipe and loved it.  I did use some of the tips by others such as making sure my base was hot when I added the biscuits dough as well as shutting the oven off and letting the pot pie sit for an additional 10 minutes.  

I used turkey left over from Thanksgiving and will definitely make this again

I've been making a similar dish for years with leftover turkey using frozen biscuits (and more spices). The secret to having biscuits that are cooked on the bottom is to bring the meat/veggie/sauce mixture to a bubbling boil, pour it directly into the pan and immediately top with biscuits and bake.  No more soggy bottoms.  I also usually top with buttered crumbs and more herbs.

Very easy and good.....  
I bought the frozen bag of peas, corn and carrots.  I see corn in your picture, but not in the recipe, you can add whatever your family likes.   I threw in some celery & poultry seasoning and used canned biscuits & a rotisserie chicken.  Definitely making again and great comfort food.

This recipe was delish! I used it as a filling for an potpie and I added a little more pepper (personal preference)  and more like a quarter of an onion.

Great recipe, but made a few changes.  Replaced the carrots and peas with fresh sliced mushrooms and celery.  Cooked with the onions.  Added 1/4 cup of chopped parsley once the sauce was finished.

I made this recipe for my husband and a friend. All three of us absolutely loved it. This is definitely going to become one of my favorite go to recipes. The biscuits were flaky, soft and fluffy. I followed the instructions exact and also added a little parsley to the mix. I wouldn't recommend making any major changes to this dish as it's perfect the way it is.

Great recipe! I changed a couple of things. I bought frozen mixed vegetables and simmered them in chicken broth. It have them a great texture and cooked them a little before adding them to the mixture. I also breaded and pan fried chicken breasts and cut them into cubes. I made my own biscuits using my own recipe. I cooked mine a little longer and kept an eye on keeping the temperature a little lower ( around 350) this kept the biscuits from burning on top. I liked the other viewers suggestion to put biscuits on top while the mixture is hot so it will start cooking. The

I, personally, thought this has a great flavor, but my 18 year old wouldn't even try it, my husband didn't like it, and my 9 year old only ate about a half portion. So, I don't see this recipe going into our dinner rotation.

My family and I really like this one. I did take the advise from another , and cook it at 425 for 40 minutes. I  have never tried it at 450 for 20, but I know 425 for 40 minutes has been working just great. I have made this recipe quite a few times, and I like to add some fresh chopped garlic, and cook   chicken bite size chunks in the butter garlic and onions. Definetly a keeper.

I made this last week for a quick last minute dinner.
I used carrots, onions and peas since that was onhand. The biscuts were ok, next time I will cook them seprately and add on top just before serving. I think this would make a great pot pie filling by adding puff pastry over the top. I just may try that next time! Thanks for sharing.

Good, easy recipe! Only things I did different was to use pearl onions (have a picky child who hates onions, can pick them out easy) and used refrigerator biscuits (what I had on hand). Made my life even easier by picking up a rotisserie chicken from the store. Great for a super quick meal during the busy week!

I thought this was a great recipe. I cooked two chicken breasts in a crockpot on high for about 4 hours with chicken broth, rosemary, thyme, and sage and then used forks to shred it. I used packaged buttermilk biscuits and added frozen corn to the mixture. I loved it! The mixture needs to be hot if you want the bottom of the biscuits to cook, but my boyfriend liked the gooey-ness of them not being cooked all the way through. My roommate finished off the leftovers in one sitting.

Soo good and easy to make. I used Bisquick and added some thyme and rosemary and mixed frozen veggies. It was cooked in a convection oven so I used a much lower temp-around 350 degrees. It was terrific and I will be making it  again :) You won't be diisappointed.

The work for this one (chopping chicken, and parboing it) didn't seem worth it.  It needed more seasoning to me.  My biscuits didn't get done on the bottom, and per other reviews I had to flip them.

AWESOME and the hubby raved at how good it was. Followed the recipe to a "t" minus the onion. Had to cook almost 15 minutes longer to get my biscuits to be golden brown. I guess ovens vary?? Mine did not boil over either.

An economical way to use leftover chicken.  Any kind of vegetable can be used.  450 degrees was way too hot.  I baked mine at 400 degrees and that was almost too hot.

Delicious. Thank you so much for the recipe!
Adam, you clicked on a recipe called "Chicken Biscuit Pie". Did you really think it was going to be healthy???

Yum!  I used 1 less tbsp butter in both the roux and the biscuits - could definitely cut back on the biscuit butter even more.

Very very good but lacking seasoning. I add nature seasoning and garlic powder to the mixture and vegys before baking.

Excellent and simple! I used a package of frozen broccoli in place of the peas and carrots, threw in some thyme and sprinkled on some parsley flakes before topping with the biscuits. I did as others suggested and cut out the biscuits and spaced them slightly apart  instead of just dropping them.

Just had this for dinner and love it!  I added red bell pepper when I sauteed the onion just to up the veggie factor.  I had to use rice milk instead of regular milk and it came out runny.  Still very yummy and will become a permanent part of our master menu!

I made substitutions, of course, with what I had on hand.  I only used about a cup of chicken, threw in 2 finely diced potatoes, 3 chopped carrots, some frozen peas, canned milk for fresh, seasoned with rosemary, thyme, salt, pepper, and granulated garlic.  I substituted butter for the shortening.    Following others advice I made sure to prepare the biscuit mixture in advance so I could drop it onto piping hot chicken mixture.  I cooked the chicken mixture in my oven friendly skillet and so when I dropped the biscuits in I just put the entire thing in the oven.     I baked it at 400 for about 35 minutes.  It was absolutely delicious!!  Good winter comfort food.

So, so good. I didn't have chicken broth so added more milk and more salt and was lazy and used store bought biscuit dough. As anticipated they didn't cook on the bottom. I flipped them and cooked another 10 minutes which didn't help with the aesthetic, but so, not a big deal. Will make again and again and again...

Excellent recipe.  I doubled the ingredients and used a 9x13 pyrex (3Q).  I used a butter/EVOO mix for cooking the onion.  I added thyme leaves to the gravy along with salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I backed off the oven temp to 425 and baked for 18-20 minutes.  The advice to have the biscit dough ready was spot on and I made sure to drop the dough onto a hot concoction - great results.  Thanks for the good recommendations and recipe!

This was delicious! The best part about it is that adjustments are easy. You can mix and match vegetables per what you like/don't like and you can increase the mixture very easily by adding extra milk as needed. I didn't measure anything out, but I knew we needed more than the recipe called for. I just added a whole bag of frozen peas as well as a whole bag of frozen mixed vegetables, and extra chicken so that it would fit in a 9 x 13 inch pan. Then there ended up being too many peas, but it didn't bother us because the other flavors were great! The sauteed onion in the butter was a nice touch. Next time I will double the biscuit part as well. GREAT recipe!

Not bad, though it needs a bit more spice to it. Otherwise, it doesn't quite have enough flavor. I made it as stated, other than I lowered the temperature to 400 and baked it covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for 10. The biscuits were cooked quite nicely all the way through that way, so we didn't have to deal with uncooked biscuits. However, next time I was to make this I would definitely want to add some more spice to give it more flavor.

Yum!  This was really good and easy.  I used Pillsbury grands instead of making the biscuits but they turned out brown on top and a little uncooked on the bottom.  You might have to experiment with cook times.

Wonderful, rich, and perfect for a cold winter night!  I subbed some frozen corn and fresh broccoli, as I didn't have any carrots on hand.  I'm guessing you could use about any veggie in this recipe.  Good stuff!

This recipe was outstanding!  I did change a couple of things however.  I used 2 TBS Smart Balance spread and 2 TBS olive oil instead of 1/3 cup of butter.  I only had a bag of frozen mixed vegetables on hand and I made some cheesy Bisquick biscuits.  I got a huge thumbs up from the family and the recipe went into my "favorites" book.  Thanks!

This is incredibly delicious and fattening. :) I ditched the frozen veggies and just sauteed some diced carrot and celery with the onion (in a LOT less than 1/3 cup butter!). Then I set them aside and melted a little more butter to make the sauce. For the chicken, I just bake a package of skinless thighs for an hour or so, let them cool, and then cut up the meat. Otherwise, I make this recipe as written. My husband loves it SO much, and all his coworkers are jealous when he brings in the leftovers!

This was great.  The only thing I changed was I used my own biscuit recipe. While getting the chicken mixture ready I started baking the biscuits for a few minutes while getting the chicken ready then added to dish and baked through.  Great post.  Thank you.

Great comfort food.  Only issue - the biscuits were a bit soggy on the bottom & were somewhat dense.  Next time I'll use a different biscuit to top the recipe.

Great, quick, delicious.  My son had thirds!!! I now use the biscuit topping for my homemade biscuits. They are so light and fluffy.

My family loved this!  I made my own biscuits, but canned would work.  I also rolled out my biscuits instead of using the drop method.
