Oh... My ...Gosh!! I wish there were more then  5 stars to give because I could easily rate this at 10 stars!  I made it exactly as directed and it was totally awesome! The flavor was fantastic, and tasted just like a fresh lasagna, minus the cottage cheese. I'm new to cooking with the Instant Pot, and I love how even the prep is done in the pot prior to setting the pressure cooking feature. Definitely making this again but I can't think of a single thing I would want to add/change.  Thank you so much for sharing this!

This soup is excellent as written. However, this is what I added to make it even more excellent! Add 1 diced red bell pepper, green pepper, and zucchini (mushroom if you prefer) right before  pressure cooking, along with  1/2 cup water and 1.5 cup rotini noodles and 1tbsp Italian herb blend.   When done, add 1 cup cottage cheese and 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella, stir and let melt with the lid on for a few minutes. Serve with garlic bread. DELISH!

So great. I didn’t have the sausage but used everything else and 10 lasagna noodles. I also added some oregano and Italian seasonings while sautéing the ground beef with garlic and onion. I also added a spoonful of ricotta to individual bowls when serving along with the Parmesan cheese. I will make this again. It was perfect!

Easy and fast!
I enjoy the flavor and it makes for great leftovers.
I went for some chunky marinara which is probably the best choice here.
After cooling down it sets really thick and no longer resembles soup so if you plan on storing it make sure you have some broth/stock handy for the future to hydrate it again and make some really good leftovers!

Loved it!  I made mine less soup, more lasagna.  I used 8 Italian Sausage links, casing and grease removed.  I sauteed  the garlic, added Prego with mushrooms, 67 oz, one box of broken lasagna noodles, about 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese, garlic salt and pepper to taste.  I used an open box of chicken bullion (about 1 1-1/2 cups)I cooked it for one minute, but will cooked it three minutes next time.   When it was done, I added shredded mozzarella/colby mix cheese.  It tasted almost like my Mom's!

Very tasty and super easy to make - I didn't add the sausage (too much meat for me) but instead sauteed up some mushrooms and then added them in once the soup was done. Yummy!

Great recipe! Cooked fast so it’s perfect for a weeknight dinner. I didn’t change much just added a second sausage link and like a lot of other reviewers, used beef broth in place of chicken. Might try adding some veg next time but it certainly isn’t necessary.  My family loves it!

I loved this recipe. Are used turkey burger and hamburger, because that’s what I had available but I love the way that this is so thick, more like a goulash. 
I did add 1/2 cup of Sour cream to the pot afterwards, just to make a little bit creamier

My family loves this recipe. I do alter it a little, though. I use one pound of italian sausage and one pound of ground beef. One thirty two ounce box of chicken broth plus two 14.5 ounce cans. Two 24 ounce jars of marinara (spaghetti sauce). And one and a half pounds of lasagna noodles. This leaves lots of leftovers and my family loves this for lunches the next day or two. I would love to put in some mushrooms, but no one else in my family will eat them (this makes me sad).

Incredibly easy and perfect in the winter.  We substituted hot sausage for the mild which we liked.  Served with toasted focaccia for dipping.

It won't quite as "soupy" as I'd expected. I made very few changes and I honestly believe that the noodles tend to continue to soak up the liquid and so that's why it doesn't stay in that consistency. Overall it was a fair flavor and not a bad budget-friendly meal.

This is a simple, quick and delicious recipe. I planned to make it as directed but I didn't have sausage so I used sausage and garlic spaghetti sauce instead of the marinara and it was great. I will be making this again.

I didn't make any changes and I'd totally make this again. It was a huge crowd pleas-er with my friends. I used my pampered chef  quick cooker. I did the saute setting and I also used the soup setting at 30 minutes. It was amazing. Cannot wait to make it again!!!!!

This was only the second time that I used my new InstantPot. I couldn't be more please with this recipe. The sauce I used was a Tomato Basil sauce but everything else was directly from the recipe. It is 5 star for sure. Not too spicy, rich flavors that I would expect from Lasagna and complete within one hour -- start to table.  Serve with a crusty loaf of bread, perhaps a salad and dinner is complete.  Thank you for such a quick, easy and delicious recipe.

The family loved it. I doubled the ingredients and used pizza sauce instead of marinara because that's what I had. I wish I would have broken the noodles into smaller pieces first, but the flavor was great.

Super easy and delicious. I add diced zucchini and red pepper to this and it comes out perfect. Also use the gluten free lasagna noodles and use the whole box (it’s smaller than regular lasagna noodles)

This is delicious as-is! It's a forgiving recipe that you can easily alter and not compromise flavor. I think I'll add veggies and less liquid next time for a thicker sauce/soup.

Very tasty! Didn't have lasagna noodles so used elbow and added some red wine.  Family loved it and plenty for leftover lunches.
