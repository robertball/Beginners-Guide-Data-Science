I like buffalo chicken, and I was a bit apprehensive at first to try this because it seemed complex. Wow, was I wrong. This dish is unique and fun. It's to die for!

Flavor was good but was a bit runny.  It was more like a soup.

So good, added a little less cheese, and used a smaller pan. Not runny at all. My husband loved this creation.

Way too salty, way too soupy. This would have been better classified as a dip. Love buffalo chicken recipes but this one, not so much. Did not score well with hubby in this one.
