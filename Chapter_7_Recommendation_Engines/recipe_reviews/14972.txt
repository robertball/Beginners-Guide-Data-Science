Dip was OK, but similar dip on back of Knorr Vegetable Soup Mix is far superior.  Proportion of sour cream to mayo in that recipe  is 2 to 1, so it does not have an overwhelming mayo taste. The  secret to keeping dip from being runny is to squeeze as much water out of the spinach as possible.  I use paper towels for this.

I made this for a baby shower and it was awesome!!  I just served it with vegetable crackers and ritz crackers.  Everyone was lingering around the table munching and raving about this dip!  I did change quite a few things, however, sortof "made it my own".  I added half a can of very finely chopped water chestnuts, only 1/2 cup each of sour cream and mayo, sprinkled in some parmesan cheese and added an 8 oz. container of cream cheese and an extra couple of drops of lemon juice.  In addition to the seasoned salt, I sprinkled in some McCormick's vegetable seasoning, since I couldn't find any Knorr's.  Oh, and I only added 1/4 cup of green onions.  Yummy!  :-)

WOW!  I served this last night to my guests and it was gone way before the end of the night!  Everyone commented on how good it was, I used MaMa D's Italian bread recipe (on this site) for the bowl because the crust is so hard, and used the French Bread recipe (also on this site)for dipping.  It's a great recipe Tracy, THANK YOU!!

Always a hit!  I make this for every potluck or party and there's never enough to go around! So many variations on ways to serve this dip.  I've served it with cubed sourdough, pumpernickel, Asiago cheese bread, cocktail rye, or even whole wheat crackers.  Even the dip in the veggie tray is usually passed over for this. This dip even works with reduced fat sour cream and mayonnaise.  I also add garlic powder, a little white pepper, and on the suggestion of other posters, water chestnuts.  Fabulous!

This recipe was awesome! I added a small container of light cream cheese and halved the mayo and sour cream. I also added some chopped water chestnuts. I only tried a little bit beofre I took it to a party but I wanted to grab a big spoon at attack. It was a huge hit at the party, people wanted to know where I bought it and they were amazed when i said I made it. There were no leftovers and it was a party of girls only. Thanks for a great recipe.

I made this for a party and it turned out great.  I couldn't find a bread bowl but it works great as a veggie dip too.  Make sure to refrigerate to allow the flavors to blend.  I refrigerated mine for about 8 hours and it was perfect.

I had big raves over this but I listened to other reviewers and added items.  I doubled the recipe because I was feeding a big crowd and added 8oz cream cheese, a can of chopped water chestnuts, two packages of Lipton vegetable soup/dip mix, cut back half on the mayo and sour cream and also on the green onion.  I thought it was delicious right after mixing it but I let it set over night and it had too strong a spinach taste for me so I added more mayo and it snapped back just the way I wanted it and people were very complimentary.  One comment was "delicious times ten".  Will definitely make this again right before serving.

I was a bit leary about making this, as the ingredients did not sound that exciting.  But with all the positive feedback I had to try.  I made the dip and licked the spoon before I put it in the dishwasher.  WOW.....was I surprised.  It was so good. I can't wait to try now that it has been in the fridge most of the day.

Brought this to a baby shower and it was fantastic!  Got lots of compliments.  I used 2 of the small containers of spinich so it wasn't too mayo-ish.  It also made more by adding the extra spinich.  It takes only about 10 min. to whip up and I served it with the hawaiian bread bowls you can buy in the deli section of supermarkets.  I cut out the middle and put crackers and the bread chunks on the outside and let people use those two to eat with the dip.  I also made homemade hawaiian bread found on this website as extra bread for the dip and it was a hit as well. Thanks a bunch! Priscilla P

This is an always requested party appetizer! It is a wonderful dip cold. I have made a few changes: I added a large tub of whipped cream cheese and a large bunch of chopped cilantro to give it a more fragrant flavor. It is out of this world!

I made this dip for a Memorial Day party. My guests loved it. They literally scraped the bread bowl clean. I used a round sourdough loaf and twice the amount of lemon juice. It was REALLY good and REALLY easy to make! Many people have mentioned a strong mayo taste - I think the lemon juice is the key to balancing the mayo flavor - do not omit the lemon and be sure to use a fresh lemon not the bottled stuff! I also made the dip the night before the party so the flavors could mingle! Oh man, is this stuff good!

Outstanding, and very easy to tweak to your tastes.  I also cut the sour cream & mayo in half and added an 16 oz package of light cream cheese to thicken the consistancy, and added an 8 oz. can of chopped-up water chestnuts for crunch.  You can kick up the zing by adding a little more lemon juice (though I added too much the second round and had to add more mayo and sour cream again to mellow it, also added some dried vegetable seasonings (I imagine Knorr's would work, too.)  Everyone loved it, I found a batch made enough for two good-sized sourdough rounds with the added water chestnuts.

Great dip! Easy to make in the food processor and the flavor is spot on. I used the juice of one lemon.

Simply amazing!  I made this dip for the first time last Christmas, and it was gone very shortly after I put it out.  I get requests to make it for every family function because it's such a huge hit.  Also great with water chestnuts.

I can't thank you enough for this recipe.  I' am a receptionist and I put this dip out at 9am and I went on break at 10am and the whole thing was gone. People were even telling me they didn't even get a chance to try it so I had to make it again the next day. All day long all I heard was how awesome this dip was.  Way to Go!!!

This was really GOOD!  I also added fresh grated Parmasean Cheese, which added a little more flavor!  

My Three Year Old is not a fan of Spinach but LOVED every bit of it!

Good recipe but it was definitely better the second day.  I would also add some water chestnuts for crunch next time.

I have to say that I wasn't a huge fan of this dip.  I think it was because the mayonnaise flavor was too overwhelming.  I modified it a little bit and omitted the green onions, just because I'm not a big green onion person in general.  I did add some chopped up shredded carrots.  If I ever make this again (which I don't think I will), it needs more flavor, maybe garlic powder, or something to cut the mayo taste.  Stacy's Parmesan Garlic & Herb pita chips were great to dip, they really added some of that flavor that was missing in the dip.

This was pretty good. There's a little too much mayo I think, but it was perfect for a veggie platter.

YUM!  As suggested, I used only 1/2 cup of mayo and 1 1/2 cups of sour cream.  I also added 1/4 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 tsp of onion powder.  I ran out of bread pieces within minutes of our BBQ so I just put out some tortilla chips.  People even tore at the lining of the bread bowl to get to the rest of the dip!  The dip tastes great with raw veggies too!   Next time I'll have more Italian bread on hand.

This recipe is really yummy!  I am only giving it 4 stars, however, because I had to make some modifications to the original recipe in order to make it so yummy.  I am not a huge fan of mayo so I reduced the amount of it by half and added 4 oz of whipped cream cheese. With the addition of the cream cheese I found that the texture of the dip was extra creamy. I also added garlic salt. Thanks for the suggestion of letting it sit over night.  It tasted much better after sitting for awhile.

Since making this dip for a party I've been asked over & over again to make it for all occasions! (I'm told its much better than your traditional Spinach dip.) My only notes are that I've noticed a different taste when using different mayos - I've learned to used "Reduced-fat Hellmans". I also add lots of fresh grated parmasean cheese and let it sit over night.

This is a FANTASTIC dip to try. Especially if you're tired of the same old dill or ranch dip. It's my new favorite dip! I have 3 children and they ALL liked it. Can you imagine KIDS and SPINACH going together??? They can! :-)

Yum! I made this for a potluck picnic, gave my husband a taste, and asked him what he thought...should I add anything? He said, "Leave it the way it is...it's perfect!" I hope we can get it to the picnic without us eating it up first!

This is the dip my family asks for every year when we put on our New Year's eve gathering.  There are fights over who gets any that might be left over, so I usually end up making a double batch to satify the need!

My family said it was the best ever. I had always used the Knorr's in the past. Although I did add chopped water chestnuts and some vegetable flavored Salad Fixins. 5 stars

I made this for my baby shower last year. It was so good, we ate all the leftovers! I also made it again for a pot luck at work and served it with Ritz crackers -- it was devoured! I added chopped water chestnuts. They add a good "crunch" to the dip. I also used low-fat and fat-free ingredients, as it doesn't change the flavor so much as it does the calories. Will always make this as a party dip from now on. Yum!

Great dip. I used creamed spinich and didn't need to drain any liquid since it was creamed. I also added a few shakes of garlic salt and onion powder. I didn't like the way it tasted with the bread, but it was excellent with ruffles chips. I will use this recipie in the future.

This is very good and simple to make. I used fresh spinach each time, and low fat EVOO mayo. It is a light dip and very tasty!

I had a potluck to go to for international exchange students at my university, so I wanted an easy, quick recipe with simple ingredients.  Let me also say that I am a disaster in the kitchen.  This one seemed very promising, so I tried it out.  Like many other reviewers, I'm not too big on the taste of mayo so I used 1 1/2 cups of sour cream and only 1/2 cup of mayo.  I also added some pepper, garlic powder, and lots more lemon juice (about two tablespoons).  It was a HUGE hit.  People weren't even going for the bread, they just ate the dip on its own.  They scraped the sides of the bread bowl clean.  I saw one guy go back three times, all the while muttering about how great it was.  Several other people came up to me to tell me how good it was.  I was so pleased - that for once, something I made didn't turn out horribly, and that it suited people's tastes from such a variety of cultures.  Not only was it super easy, it was quick too!  I've already promised my dormmates that I'll make it more often.  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is very good, but just needed a few tweaks. I followed another user's suggestion and used 1/2 cup of mayo and 1 1/2 cups of sour cream to avoid that strong mayo taste. I threw in some extra spices like salt & pepper, garlic powder, minced onions, and Mrs. Dash herb blend. I then mixed it all together and thought the consistency wasn't quite creamy enough so I added 4 oz. cream cheese and that did the trick! I also used a round loaf of King's Hawaiian sweet bread, which was an awesome complement to the tangy dip. The presentation was nice and this went over well at a cookout! I will be making this again.

This recipe is so easy and it is delicious! There was just slightly too much spinach (most people prefer it that way), so I increased all the other ingredients slightly and it was wonderful.

I made this for a party using a rye bread bowl and it was devoured! The next day it tasted even better, so I will probably make it at least one day ahead next time. It looks great too!! (Onions were a bit too strong, will cut back next time).

What a great way to make kids eat spinach! I added one cup of fresh spinach leaves and it gave the dip an extra "crunch". Also followed the other reviews and added cream cheese and less mayo and sour cream. A winner.

Not bad...  I didn't read the reviews before I started (oops!) I had to add extra sour cream to cut down the over-powering mayo-ness. I also added garlic powder and pepper. But it's a really good "starter recipe", like you can make it your own really easily.

I was so happy to find this recipe..finally a spinach dip that does NOT use veg or other soup mix!! Flavours were awesome! I did use 1/2 brick of cream cheese and only 1/2 cup of mayo (all other ingredients the same), and added some "pizza seasoning" and a dash of garlic powder. Turned out awesome. I don't care for the "soup mix" spinach dips.

yummy!!!!  I decreased the sour cream & mayo both to 1/2 cup, and added a 8 oz. of softened cream cheese.  I served with Kings Hawiaan Bread (YUM!!) @ work.  Everyone loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

My guest went wild for this dip! I added a bit more spinach, some dill weed, and an extra shot of lemon juice. It was perfect. To make a pretty party tray, here's what I did. Instead of using the bread bowl, I hollowed out a head of purple cabbage and served it in it. I arranged other dips around it in hollowed out green and red peppers. I also used the large outer leaves of the purple cabbage to serve slaw on, using the insides of the hollowed cabbage. I outlined the tray in crackers and party breads. Everyone was impressed and I was very proud of this dish!

Beware mayo haters!  This recipe has a strong mayo taste so no one in my family liked it.  I think it would fit our tastes if I completely substitute the mayo with cream cheese.  I think that would be very tasty!

Great dip! I tripled this for a party this afternoon and it was gone in 30 minutes!!!! Thanks for the great submission. The only changes I made -- added cream cheese and a bit more of all the seasonings (season salt, peppper, garlic powder, lemon juice) ... that was only because I love garlic. Wonderful recipe -- I just don't think you can go wrong with this.

Great recipe! I made a few changes based on what the other chefs suggested. I doubled the spinach, only put in 1 cup mayo and 1 cup sour cream. I added 8 oz soft cream cheese and about 1/16th of a tsp. of garlic powder. Everything else was the same. YUM! Thanks for sharing!

I could not stop eating this dip.  I took the advice of an earlier reviewer and omitted the green onion, and cut the mayo and sour cream in half as well.  I also added 4 oz. cream cheese, a pkg. of Knorr vegetable soup mix, and a can of water chestnuts (drained an chopped).

This is a really good recipe.  I use reduced fat sour cream and add more than the recipe calls for and only 2 tablespoons of reduced fat mayo.  Very good!!

Eh, not good.  I made the recipe exactly as stated and I ended up using 20 oz. of spinach just to make it thicker.  Very runny.  I had to add some of my own ingredients including a pack of dry onion soup mix just to make it servable.  Will go back to my old recipe.  Sorry!

Great recipe- so quick to make that I bought extra spinach so that I could whip a batch up next time someone drops by. It's great to have a recipe that everything is usually on hand for.

We really enjoyed this dip and have already made it several times.  Having made no changes except for when I'm not able to find a crusty round bread, I've put the dip in a bowl surrounded by cut up french bread cubes and vegis ... delicious!

Will try again.  I did add a little garlic with good results.  I think next time I will also reduce the mayo/sour cream, add water chesnuts and some parm.  Good with crackers, bagel or pita chips.  Nice to have an app you don't have to keep warm.

Made this wonderful dip for a Christmas gathering; my only problem was that I should have made two batches.  My guest could not stay away from it.  It was simple to make, visually apealing, and the best spinach dip I have ever tasted-- try it you will not regret it.

I  made this for a couple of gatherings now and everyone loves it. It definately tastes better than using the packaged dry mix and just adding spinach to that. I started to add about 1 tsp of ground red chili peppers,,which definitely adds a kick to it. I get rave reviews everytime I make it. I usually make my own bread bowl and then add some crackers to it.  Thanks so much for this recipe!!

This tasted a little bland to me so I added 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and chopped bamboo shoots for some crunch and served with black pepper and olive oil Triscuit. Loved it!

This was very good considering that it's all made with standard kitchen ingredients. I tried to follow the recipe, but it was definitely bland for our taste so I added a few extra spices (Garlic and onion powder, white pepper, cracked black pepper and most importantly Mrs. Dash!) I also followed other reviewers advice to use more lemon juice, increase sour cream to 1.5 cups and decrease mayo to 1/2 cup. I'll make this again in a pinch, but I'll probably spice it up a little more with a few shakes of hot sauce :o)

So i can't exactly give this this a fair rating because i changed it, so this rating is based on how i changed it. I cut both the mayo and sour cream in half and added cream cheese.  The dip tasted way too much of cream cheese, too strong for my tastes, although everyone else seemed to enjoy the dip. I also couldn't taste the spinach as strongly as i would have hoped, i even added a whole 16oz bag instead of 10!  The longest part of making this recipe was trying to get all of the water out of the spinach, it was INCREDIBLY time consuming!!! although, i wasnt sure how to get the water out, so i kept using paper towel after paper towel to dry the spinach...i should have left the spinach out for a whole day instead of half a day.  Not sure i'll be making this dip again

There's a great bakery near my apt. that makes dozens of different kinds of bread bowls, and I can't wait to pour this dip into all of them!  I like that this recipe doesn't have cream cheese.  I didn't include the onions the second time and it still tasted great.

It was very easy to make, even a kid could whip this up! However, I would add alot more spices and only add 1/2 cup mayo and increase the sour cream to 1 & 1/2 like everyone suggested. I also added chopped celery and onion mix for that extra crunch instead of just onion. Awesome Dip!

This was bland as other reviewers said but once I added spices it came out really well.  I added garlic salad, minced garlic, salt, pepper, and cayenne, and even some dashes of tabasco.  Everyone loved it!

My husband loves this dip.  Instead of serving it with bread, I serve it with plain corn chips.  The salty, crunchy texture of the chips has a great taste with the cool blend of flavors.  Additionally, I use all seasoning salt and a bit of garlic powder, and a touch of Tony's for a bit of pow!  Additionally, I use fat free sourcream, and just a touch of mayo to blend.  You could use a mix of, ff sourcream, plain yoghurt and a touch of mayo to blend.  All in all a great recipe.

After adding some garlic powder, the dip tasted better; it still had a very overpowering taste of mayonaise.  Great base recipe to play with...

I was a little bummed that I didn't like this as well as I thought I would.  The taste of mayo was very strong.  I will try it again w/ 1 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 mayo.  I read on here that it's better a day or two after making it, so I'm going to try it again tonight to see if the flavor has improved.

i brought this dip last minute to a small get together with 20 somethings....it was a hit..
a great way to get lots of spinach in and the fresh green onions and lemon juice were nice...
i was opting for rye bread instead of italian...
in addition i used light sour cream and light miracle whip and it tasted excellent...
keep this for your get togethers!

So very good.  I cut the round loaf to accomodate a small bowl (for dip) so the bread doesn't get yucky, easier to clean up.  WARNING: You will find yourself getting out of bed in the middle of the night if there are leftovers!!

love this dip! It's quick & easy and I always have the ingredients on hand to whip it up! I usually add some garlic powder and a few dashes of hot sauce to spice it up a little.

Excellent dip recipe that is easy to make and very popular.  I added some extra seasoning: grated parmesan cheese and some garlic and onion salt.  The dip is one of my family‚Äôs favorites!

Excellent dip.  I would have given it 4 1/2 stars.  I highly recommend letting it sit overnight to let the flavors blend.  Initally, the green onions were quite overpowering, but after it sat, it was very mellow and tasty.  I might have liked to have "spiced" it up a bit with seasonings, but my guests loved it.

I love this dip recipe.  I use a couple of tbsp. less of the mayo and use salt instead of seasoning salt but otherwise I generally follow the recipe.  On one occasion, I had a guest who was allergic to citris fruits so I omitted the lemon juice and it still tasted great.  I always serve it with the bread and carrots and celery.  This is a great party dish.

Excellent recipe... and my guests agreed!  I added about half a can of chopped water chestnuts which gave it a nice crunch... along with a touch more of seasoning salt and pepper... placed in a nice crusty sour dough bread and it was fabulous!  I'll definitely make this one again - thanks for the recipe!

This was a really quick and easy recipe. I made it for my Superbowl party (GO PATS!!!) and it went very quickly. I thought that the amount of onions was a little overpowering. I added more seasoned salt to it and it evened out the onion flavor. I will make this recipe again, but will cut back on the onions and a little less mayo. Overall a very good recipe!!

Really good and quick.  I made a bread bowl, but we ended up running out of bread.  My guests attacked the rest of the dip with tortilla chips and then ate the bread bowl.  Huge hit.  A little heavy on the mayo taste; I'll use a little less next time.

This dip was a hit at my latest party.  My roommate devoured the leftovers!  For myself, I thought there were too many green onions and I added garlic powder to add some kick.  It's a great recipe you can adapt to your liking.

This dip disappeared along with the pumpernickel bowl.  I had another loaf of bread to use with the leftover dip, but it was gone with the veggies by the time I got the bread ready!  Outstanding!

I made this dip for a family gathering, and it was a hit.  I added some cream cheese, less mayo, a dash of garlic powder, and it was wonderful!  

Even the kids, ages 2-5 loved it.  A keeper!

I made this and enjoyed it with my husband, who liked it a lot. One thing I would do for next time is add about 1/4 c. of cream cheese to give it a little bit of a thicker consistancy, and cut the mayo down by a few T. Also: I added about 2T chopped water chestnuts to this recipe. I used an Italian bread, but think it would be even better with pumpernickle. Defrosting the spinach in the micro is also helpful. I will make it again!

This dip is really good! It's even better with real parsley and garlic thrown in, as well as some cheese. Tastes great with low-fat ingredients, as well.

This is the first spinach dip I've ever made, and it was very easy and very good :)  
***
It's now 2 years since I first made this dip. I just had a friend ask me to bring it to a New Year's party - she remembered it from a Tupperware party she attended a couple of years ago! Now that's memorable! I also like to add a small can of chopped water chestnuts for some added crunch.

I made this recipe for a bridal shower for 20 women.  It was a hit.  I served it cold in the bread bowl on a tray with bread, crackers, small tomatoes, celery, peppers, and carrots.  A previous reviewer mentioned that it was difficult to get the water out of the spinach. I put the spinach in a strainer and put pressure on top of the spinach (which worked for me).  This dip tastes great and is super easy to make.  I will make again.

This was a great hit at the Super Bowl party.  Even my neighbor who swears he abhors spinach in anything ate it up.  I did add a dash more pepper and a pinch of chili powder to give it a bit more zing, after the fact, but even as directed exactly it was so good.

Nice starter recipe.  I would have given it 5 stars but I made a few changes: since it came out a little bland I minced in a couple of cloves of garlic and a dash of hot sauce for zip, and to counter the lack of texture I chopped up half a can of water chestnuts to add crunch here and there.  It went over great at my holiday party!

All this was eaten, but it isn't quite as good as the recipes that call for Vegetable Soup Mix and water chestnuts.  After making as stated, I ended up adding cayenne, garlic powder, onion powder and other spices to enhance the flavor.  The end result was good, but not the best.  Still, I think this is a solid recipe if you don't like more highly-flavored foods.

This is my favorite spinach dip.  I dropped the spinach extra fine since I don't like huge chunks.  Everyone agreed this was far better then store bought.

Quite good.  We served this with Hawaiian sweet bread and carrots.  I was happy to find a dip that didn't use a seasoning packet in it.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was great a hit at our Christmas appetizer get together. I did not use a loaf of bread...just put it in a pretty bowl and served with crackers.

I modified this recipe a little but it turned out well and was a hit at Christmas.  I used a small handful of green onions as the specified amount would have overpowered the dip.  I didn't use a bread bowl and I added a little parmesan in the dip and a little on top for a nice looking accent.

Made it exactly as specified, except for the spices, since I didn't have "seasoning salt" so I winged it.  It turned out excellent!  I served as an appetizer at a small dinner party I hosted and people were saying how good it was and asking how to make it.  So easy, looks very pretty in the bread bowl and delicious. Thanks!

I adore spinach dip but between the fat and the salt, I can't have it very often.  I made this using light/fat free mayo and sour cream, salt substitute and garlic powder.  Fantastic.  I also have made it both with water chestnuts added and diced jicama for added crunch appeal.

This is YUM and addictive, although I have to admit I added at least 3 cloves of garlic and made my own mayonnaise. But this is simple, fast and easy and always, ALWAYS disappears fast!

This is an excellent spinach dip -- make sure not to skimp by using low-fat mayo or sour cream, it really diminishes the taste. I make this for all my parties and it is always completely gone (including the bread bowl!) by the end of evening.

This is by far the best spinach dip ever!!!! Everytime I make it my son can't get enough of it and it's all gone by the end of the party. For an extra kick I add a little garlic powder & parmessean cheese. You'll love it!!

Good dip! Didn't have any green onions so I used onion powder.  Added a little bit extra lemon juice and seasoning salt.  Also added finely chopped water chestnuts.

Too band for us. I added chopped artichoke hearts and parmesan cheese but still lacked something. I took it to a party and many others seemed to like it.

This was pretty good, but something was off. I had to add a lot of spices to make it more flavorful. I added garlic power, onion powder, white pepper, dill and chives. I think next time I will also cut down on the mayo as it seemed that ingredient over powered the others. My fianc√© loved this however better then my usual spinach dip recipe.

Yum! I will never make spinach dip with a dry mix again! I followed some other reviewers suggestions and did the following: used 1 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c mayo (versus 1 c of each), added a small can of chopped water chestnuts (drained first), used a spicy seasoning salt and freshly ground black pepper, let it refrigerate overnight, then I served it with cut up veggies and tortilla chips. Delicious! Thanks, Tracy, for a great recipe!

This was a fantastic dip!  I had many complimetns on it.  So easy to make.  It does have a heavy mayo taste for those who don't care for mayo, but still very good.  I will keep this recipe as one of my 'favorites' and it will be one that I will make a lot.

I added a jar of chopped artichoke hearts--very tasty!  The recipe did taste rather strongly of mayo though as some have mentioned.  Next time I'll add maybe 1 1/4 c. sour cream and only 3/4 c. mayo.

I first made this dip for a baby shower...everyone LOVED it and I spent most of the shower printing off copies of it for everyone! Now it is a staple at every gathering....it's truly the best tasting spinach dip I have ever tried.....the recipe should tell you to make it the night before....it's good right away, but AWESOME after it sits overnight!

I always get rave reviews when I bring this to an event.  I was asked to bring it to every Clemson tailgate party.  I don't use the lemon juice and I tend to use more sour cream than the mayonaisse.  Defintely better after sitting overnight.  Great in a bread bowl  served with wheat crackers!!  MMMM!!!!!!

This is fabulous!!!  My teenage son told me it is the best dip ever, and my husband couldn't stop eating it.  I did add cream cheese and some parmesan cheese.  Will definitely make again and again.  Thank you so much for the recipe.

This dip is always a hit at a party.  I too took the advice of other reviewers, and added 4 oz of cream cheese and doubled the spinach.  Try this recipe!!! Thanks Tracy.

I made this recipe exactly per instructions for a bridal shower at work. I wasn't quite happy with the taste so I added about 1/2 cup more sour cream to cut the mayo taste. I also added garlic powder and more seasoned salt. I served the dip with some pumpernickel bread; and it tasted great with carrots or on a cracker as well.

Wonderful dip.  I used lowfat mayo and sour cream and it still tasted great.  I also put about 1/2 cup of whipped cream cheese with chives.  For the person who said it was watery..you must thaw and squeeze the spinach first.

OMG! This dip is FABULOUS! Served this as an appetizer for dinner guests the other night and it was gone before I knew it! Didn't have green onions so I substituted with same amount of regular yellow onions. Other than that I didn't change a thing. After I cut the bread up I placed it on a baking sheet and toasted both the loaf and broken dipping pieces in the oven. I heated the dip in the microwave then poured it into the bread bowl(thought it was excellent chilled, even better heated!). Was absolutely delicious!! Will double the recipe next time!

I got tons of compliments on this at a bridal shower.  The ladies loved it.  I increased the recipe to feed 25.  I increased the spinach to 32 ounces.  I couldn't find chopped spinach, so I bought the leaf verson and ran it through the food processor after it was thawed.  I also added a large bag of real bacon shreads.  That added a nice flavor.  I added some garlic powder, more seasoning salt, more lemon, and ground pepper.  I couldn't find a round loaf, so I got French bread and hollowed that out.  Next time I'll toast the loaf.  All in all, it was very good and a huge crowd pleaser.  We ate it again with chips the next day and that was even better than bread and crackers.  This is a very good recipe for parties.

I had some family over last and made this. The adults were chowing down when the kids came in and started eating. Before you knew it they were scraping the bottom of the bread asking me for more. Unfortunatly i only made one. My niece hates spinach and when i told her what she was eating she made a face and kept on eating. The only thing i did was to use fresh steamed spinach

As other reviewers have mentioned, this dip does have an overwhelming onion flavor.  Next time I will only add about 1/2 cup of chopped green onion.  I let this dip refrigerate overnight to let the flavors blend.  I placed this in a bowl in the middle of a much bigger serving bowl and put teared bread pieces around it.  It looks very impressive!

I was in charge of the appetizer for a christmas gathering and brought this room temperature with sesame wheat Breton crackers.  I've also had a dip similiar to this with bread to dip.  Both ways were great!  I think I put a tad too many green onions in it...be careful!  Add ingredients "to taste."

To this recipe I added a bit more seasoning salt, and a can of chopped water chestnuts.  I also used low-fat miracle whip instead of real mayo, which is probably why it was pretty strong and tangy.  I would recommend using reduced-fat mayonnaise instead!! However, it was still good, albeit a bit runny for my tastes.  Pumpernickel bread was awesome with this. I reduced the onions to about half a cup, which was just right. (I do have strong tastes though!)

I would definitely make this again. However, I would use a little less mayo than they recommend the next time a make it (and I normally like mayo).

I thought there was a little too much onion flavor from the green onions, but overall very good.  I've made this twice, once with water chestnuts.  They add a really nice crunch!

My parents were coming for a Sunday visit, so I wanted to make a quick appetizer before dinner.  This was so easy and really, really good.  My husband couldn't stop eating it before my parents arrived and he finished the leftovers (bread bowl and all) that same night!  It was a hit!

Everyone just loved this dip. I live in Turkey and we don't have sour cream so I used a sour type of yogurt instead and it was great!

This is a good dip for parties.  It's cool and refreshing.  The only issue is it's very unhealthy.  I'd like to try some healthier version of spinach dip to be able to eat it at home as well, instead of only have it for parties.  If you need to thaw the frozen spinach faster, you can fill a bowl with very hot water (the hottest water from your sink should suffice) and place the spinach bags in the bowl.  You'll probably need to replace the water at least once.

I've made this twice, with rye bread and with pumpernickel bread (couldn't find round Italian bread).  Very good!  I was worried it would be too mayonnaisey, but it's great as is.  Thank you for the recipe!

Thanks for a good spinach dip that doesn't use a soup mix. I made a few additions to give it a little more tang - 2 cloves of garlic and a teaspoon of dijon mustard.

My coworkers loved this dip, however I thought the taste was a bit off, I don't know why. I used a round sourdough loaf since that's all the store had, and everyone thought I brought this in from Panera Bread. Thanks for the post.

Delicious!  I love this recipe.  Make sure you completely thaw the spinach (and I don't suggest in the microwave - it didn't taste quite the same) and then drain the spinach.  I've tried to cheat this recipe a couple times - making it quickly - and it turns out too watery and the spinach seems extra soggy.  I will sometimes add some more green onions right before serving it so that it has an extra crunch in the dip.  I've never used the bread bowl, but instead use tortilla chips or bruschetta.

This is the only spinach dip that I make. I usually make my own bread bowl (so easy in bread machine) and also add some veggies..everyone always loves this dip. I usually add some chili powder just to give it a little kick. Great recipe!

When I first made this dip, I didn't really care for it, but after letting it chill in the fridge overnight, it was pretty tasty.  I had some leftover grated carrot from making a Thai chicken pizza so I mixed that in as well, and it definitely worked well... so don't be afraid to throw in other veggies!

my first attempt at a spinach dip for an appetizer party.  I altered it slightly by adding 1/2 cup of cream cheese to the sour cream and mayo.  It was awesome, esp. when we warmed it up the next day

this is such a quick and easy dip to prepare and inexpensive.  I love the fact that it can be tweaked to taste. I've had similar recipes but this was the first time I had it with the lemon and it really adds a nice flavor.  I used 2 packs of TrueLemon instead of the juice. Omitted the season salt and added some garlic powder, dried dill weed, and used fresh chopped parsley.  I did add a tad bit of salt.  I did not find it soupy at all; just squeezed out the spinach real well.  If making for a larger crowd, you may want to double it, as I am sure this would go fast.  Plan to serve with pumpernickel slices and skip using a breadbowl.

This recipe was great!  My husband loves spinach dip, and he thought this one was great!  I did make a few adjustments: I doubled the sour cream and put in a little less mayo.  I also added a package of Knorr's veggie soup mix.  I suggest making this at least a day ahead because it definitely tastes better the next day.

I loved this dip.  It is very similar to the spinach dip I buy in the grocery in the deli.  I will never buy it again though.  I would rather make this.  I will put more spinach in it next time because there seemed to be too much sour cream and may in comparison to the spinach, but it still tasted great!

I didn't have any sour cream on hand, so I substituted plain Greek style yogurt, which worked well.  I also didn't have any green onions, so I omitted those.  I added a half teaspoon of caraway seeds to spice it up a little.

Very tasty, great onion/spinach flavor.  I did take another poster's advice and reduced the amount of mayo to 1/2 cup and increased the sour cream to 1 1/2 cup.  It was PERFECTION and the kids didn't even mind that it was green!!  I will be making this again.

I made this dip for a party, and it was gone in a matter of 3 hours. Everyone was asking where I got the recipe and how I made it. It was awesome. I did cut back on the green onion, and it still had tons of flavor! A keeper for sure.

Very easy too make and overall quite good. I think there's a little too much mayo and not enough spice.  I'll try it again and follow other reviewers advice.

This recipe is my all-time favorite.  It is a staple at our family get-togethers.  For some variation, I toss in some Bacon Bacon from Tastefully Simple.  Yum-O!

I used this Chicago Dip at our card club and it is a good recipe.I used real Helmans mayo and all other ingredients`. It needs a little of a flover booster like maybe garlic? It was good and I`ll use it again.

When I first made this for a party I was attending, I found it bland.  I added chopped water chestnuts and fresh parsley but mostly followed the recipe as given.  It stayed in the fridge a couple of days and my husband and 2 little ones, who all hate spinach, ate almost the entire batch.

Outstanding! I'm not sure if there are any better words to describe this dip! This was a hit at the 4th of July party that I took this to and everyone gobbled it up! They didn't have the round italian bread, but I found a sun dried tomato italian loaf bread at the "Super" Walmart that they have here which added to the taste of this dip. This dip goes great with veggies (particularly carrots) too. If you are looking for an appetizer that will become a hit at a party, this recipe is it! Everyone will love it!

This dip was really good although it was a bit runny when I first finished making it so I just added some more spinach and it finally got to the right consistency.  It was ready in minutes and eaten in minutes.  Delicious, thanks.

Do not try this with Fat Free Miracle Whip.  That is all I had in my refrigerator, and thought it would be healthier, but the Miracle Whip taste was way too strong.  I'm sure the recipe would have been good if I would have followed it!

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I served this at a Christmas gathering and it was a hit!  I broke apart a long loaf of Italian  bread about an hour before the guests arrived so it would be a bit crusty.  It was fantastic!

I had to bring a dip w/fresh veggies to our family Christmas dinner and brought this one and it was a huge success - everything (including the bread was gone within a few hours).  I also received plenty of compliments.  I will definitely make this one again.

I was expecting this to be really great.  It was just so-so.  Had tons of it left over from a Christmas Party last night.  I followed cut the majo in half and added cream cheese and make it 24 hours before.
It just didn't have any 'zip' to make it better than just a average dip.

This was fabulous.  I made a few adjustments after reading other reviews like adding cream cheese and less green onions.  My Bunco group and my husband loved it.

Spinach dip is always a crowd pleaser. I chopped up some fresh spinach as well just because I had it and it needed to get used.  Great recipe, would definitely make again.  I might add shredded parmesan in it.

This dip is very tasty!!! I followed the advice of another reviewer and added some cream cheese and about a 1/4 c. less sour cream and mayo. I also added finely chopped water chesnuts for a little crunch. The dip was a hit even with my husband and father who HATE spinch!! Thanks!!

Made this dip for a BBQ today and it was a huge hit!! I added the extras that I've read about in the reviews and decreased the amounts of onion, mayo and sour cream. Delicious! Will definitely make again...and again.

I made this for the first time to bring to Easter dinner. I didn't change a thing in the recipe--I only wish I had doubled it!!  Everyone loved it and it disappeared quickly!!

This was a good dip.  I feel that it had too many onions and it was a little too wet.  The next time I make it, I will cut the onions to 1/2C and cut the sour cream and mayonaise to 3/4C each.

Cheaper than using a soup mix recipe. I was going to add water chestnuts, but the men in my family prefered it w/out.

this is WAY better than anything from the store! and JBANDKL's idea of using a small bowl inside for clean up was just as big of a hit as the dip itself. :) definitely let this one sit overnite, if you can leave it alone that long...

Tracy your dip was a hit as I was asked to bring some appetizers (also see Amazing Swedish Meatball recipe...read reviews to spice that one up!). But YOUR recipe was great right off the bat. Although I will try some of the reviewers suggestions next time w/reduction of onions, mayo & sour cream, adding cream cheese & water chestnuts. This recipe will be one I'm sure many will ask me for. Thanks for sharing!

This was a good dip, but it REALLY has to sit for at least a few hours to let the flavors blend.  Overnight would be even better.  It's best with Fritos!

The first time I made this recipe I served  it warm in the bread bowl and it wonderful. The second time I served it cold with chips and it was very good. Either way it was a hit. Every one enjoyed it. I will definitely keep this recipe on file.

I served this in a sourdough loaf instead and it was GREAT!! The kids thought it was cool to eat something from inside the bread, and I thought it was cool to see them eat spinach!  This is also wonderful served with a veggie plate.  Very fast and easy to prepare and everyone loves it!

I thought this was great, though I did make an alteration that would greatly affect it.  I made triple the recipe (large party) and thought it still needed some seasoning.  So I added one package of vegetable soup mix (for triple recipe).  I also 1 can of chopped water chestnuts.  It was excellent and I got rave reviews.

One of the easiest recipes I have made.  Made this recipe for a party and we went through two loaves of sour dough bread! Definitely will make again, but may adjust the amount of green onions!  I also added some cream cheese for thickness.

I made this 2 days in advance and stored the dip in the fridge.  I took it to a
wedding shower and everyone loved it.  The only problem with it was that the 
fellow hostesses tasted it and then couldn't stay out of it.   I thought we would 
run out before the party ever started.
