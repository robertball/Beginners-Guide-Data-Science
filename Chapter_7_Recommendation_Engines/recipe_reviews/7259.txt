I'm NOT a chocolate cake lover BUT needed cupcakes for an egg-allergic child.  Tweaked the recipe by adding 1/2 teaspoon of salt and using 1 TABLESPOON vanilla.  Couldn't have been easier to make ... great texture, good flavor.  Makes 30 nicely rounded cupcakes ... fill paper liners at least 3/4 full and bake for 20 minutes at 350.

Hello, after reading the reviews in which the cake was described as "tasteless", I read the recipe again and noticed there is no salt in the recipe. I have made many cakes and most have included some salt.  This may be one reason why it lacks flavour.  Salt brings out the flavour of chocolate.  Try adding about 1/4 tsp and see if it helps!

I have been using this recipe for years for my egg and nut allergic Daughter. It is super easy, very rich and tastes wonderful.  It is the best cake that I have been able to find in 8 years. My Daughter feels like any other kid at a birthday party. and no one will ever know this is for a nut and egg allergic child.  It is fluffy and moist and perfect.

THIS IS ONE HELLUVA RECIPIE! I'm thoroughly excited that this really worked. Like many, i had my doubts, i mean, vinger? well this is definitely better than the previous high fat high calorie batch of cakes i made. ITs super moist and chocolatey. Here is a tip: I replaced water with chocolate soy milk, was very generous with the baking soda and powder( i put heaped teaspoons) and put in about 6 teaspoons of vanilla essence, put in about 8 HEAPED TABLESPOONS of coco powder ( i used hershey's) and used olive oil. PLUS i also added abit more sugar, maybe a 1/4 cup more?  I also added the salt as recommanded by another reviewer. I made them into cupcakes and it rose beautifully. Also, don't forget to sift the flours together. It tasted great before icing and after icing(got it off the back of hershey's tin, used olive oil and chocolate soy milk again as replacements)them, i stuck them in the fridge and it was fanstastic! my friends are impressed and they can't believe its low fat! I will definitely make this more often. Am thinking of adding hazelnuts the next time. Thanks for this recipie! Means alot to a recently diagnosed lactose intolerant chocoholic!

I made this cake for my lactose intolerant husband. When he tasted it he wanted to know what i put in it. I didn't tell him, but i did tell him what i didn't put in it. I think next time i will add chocolate chips to make it a little more chocolatey. I thought this was very easy and very moist. It was very surprising.

I had to make cupcakes for my sons birthday to take to school. As there is a boy there allergic to dairy and eggs I made this recipe for all the kids so he didn't feel left out. I was a bit worried about making a cake with no egg or dairy but it turned out beautifully. I followed others advice to substitute half sugar with brown sugar and added a little salt.  I let them cool in the tins and they were so moist.  I had to let them cook for longer then the recipe said though.  I iced them with the icing off the anaphalaxis website like someone else suggested.  Perfect!

I have had this recipe in my recipe box for years and have used it many many times. Everyone who tries it asks for the recipe.  I do have a couple of suggestions though, the cake needs to bake for about 45 minutes and after it cools add the powdered sugar, but here's the winner, add apple pie filling to the plate when serving (as a side), if you put it on the cake like a topping, it won't keep and the cake gets mushy, but if you add it to the side when serving it adds the right bit of moisture and sweetness!  Thanks to this recipe, my food allergic daughter was able to enjoy cake on her birthday like any other kid.  Another note, don't put it on your dining room table to cool, dogs like it too. ;o)

This was the recipe that our baker used for our wedding cake.  It was absolutely delicious and everyone was simply amazed that it was egg and dairy free!

My son has a true dairy allergy so I made this cake for his first birthday while we had bought a bakery cake for the guests...well the guests preferred this cake over the bakery cake.  I paired it with soy milk/soy butter buttercream frosting....DELICIOUS!!!!
Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!!

I have tried so many desert recipes for my daughter that is egg allergic that end up anything but resembling a cake, brownie, etc. This recipe is just like real chocolate cake! It is wonderful. I made the recipe into 22 cupcakes and baked them for 24 minutes. I copied others suggestions and did half regular sugar with half brown sugar, 8tbs cocoa powder, 1tbs vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp salt, several handfuls of chocolate chips and 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I cooked it in my stonewear muffin pan and they came out beautifully. I stuck a chocolate chip in the top of each right as I took them out of the oven and sprinkled with powdered sugar right before serving. All the kids loved them. No one would ever know there were no eggs in them. What a great recipe! I am so thankful to have finally found an egg free recipe that not only has the right texture but tastes great. Thanks!

I made this cake the other night because I was in the mood to bake but didn't have any eggs in the fridge and was running low on milk. I didn't have cocoa powder either, so instead I made a spice cake using apple cider vinegar instead of distilled, and I added a teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon of nutmeg, a half teaspoon of cloves, and a half teaspoon of ginger.

The cake turned out delicious! I'm definitely keeping this recipe as I'm sure it can be varied again and again for different results. I think I might try substituting some of the water for black coffee sometime or maybe adding a little light molasses to a future spice cake and frosting it with cream cheese frosting.

Thank goodness I had a container of chocolate frosting.  I melted it in the microwave, poked holes in the cake and poured it on.  Otherwise, I would've threw the cake away.  I thought it would be similar to a "wacky cake" but it wasn't.  It took around 40 minutes to bake.

Wow! This was a super recipe that really surprised me. I did add salt, substituted chocolate almond milk for the water, used 8 TBSP of caco powder instead of 6 and used applesauce instead of oil...superb recipe! Very moist, firm cake. Baked nearly 40 minutes rather than 20-25.
Highly recommended!

My husband watches his cholesterol (no eggs, milk, butter, oil). This is perfect for him. I made half of recipe. Tasted the batter, felt the after taste of baking soda, so i sprinkled some brown sugar and it took care of that. Next time i'll use as suggested by others 2/3cup brown (or a mix of brown and white). I also added 1/4tsp salt (not sure for what but as suggested), also used 4tbsp of cocoa. Next time i'll try to lower amount of oil. Also, not sure if someone already tried to use honey or maple syrup instead of sugar, if so, please share your results. Overall, more than my husband can dream of. Finally he can have a chocolate cake and not feel guilty about it. Thanks

Cook this cake way longer than instructed! 25 minutes is not enough. Other than what a great cake! and who would have thought no eggs or dairy were used. Instead of water I used cold coffee instead! Tasted Great!

Grandma is a genious! This cake is amazing! Its moist and gets better with time.  For a dairy intolerant person this really is a welcomed addition to the list of tolerable treats.  I followed the recipe exactly - turned out great.  May add 1/2 tsp of salt next time like the others have - just to try it.

This is very similar to a recipe I have for chocolate muffins but that one calls for apple juice for 1.5 cups of the water. I like to substitute an even richer juice -- cherry or blueberry are especially fantastic! -- to alter the taste. Also you can throw in chocolate chips if need be. But just like this -- no juice, no chips -- it makes for a great, easy snacking cake or snack muffins!

We love this cake.  We came across it when looking for a recipe for our daughter's first birthday.  She is highly allergic to milk, egg, soy and a number of protiens, but we didn't want her to miss out on a birthday cake.  After making it for over two years now, I've discovered that the cooking time is very sensitive to the weather and the oven.  I set the time for 20 minutes and check it every two minutes after that.  Sometimes it is done in 20 other times it pushes 35.  We love this cake with the chocolate frosting recipe on the food allerg network's website.

This was fantastic! I made this over Thanksgiving for my 91 year old Grandmother who is lactose intolerant. Everyone loved it & could not believe there were no eggs, butter or milk in it! It was really moist and had a great flavor. Not too sweet, but just sweet enough to satisfy anyones chocolate tooth. I will make this one again for sure!

I messed with this recipe quite a bit, and it still turned out delicious.  First, 
because I live alone and couldn't finish an entire cake, I halved the recipe and 
baked it in an 8x8 pan.  I substituted half the oil with baby food (apple/plum flavor)
to cut down on fat, and used a bit of Splenda instead of all the sugar to cut down
on calories-- and it still turned out beautifully, with a lovely, moist crumb.  I agree that if you're
used to decadent or very sweet desserts, this recipe would need some kind of frosting.
Do give a try though!

This was the best cake I have tasted!!!  I did not know it would be SO SIMPLE!  The only difficulty I ran into was 25 minutes weren't long enough to cook the cake throughly.  Other than that, this was the best.

I made this cake today and am totally impressed.  For a cake with no eggs or dairy, this was excellent!  It's a very deep dark chocolate color, too, which I like.  I increased the cocoa to 1/2 cup and the oil to 3/4 cup.  I also used coffee instead of plain hot water as it enhances the chocolate flavor.   Oh, I left out the baking powder too as I didn't have any;  it rose nicely anyway!   Nice to know that I can still make a great layer cake when I don't have eggs in the house!  Will definately make it again.

It worked!  I have a family with MULTIPLE allergies and it's hard to find recipes for good baked goods.  I made these cupcakes for my daughter's birthday and was able to make a few substitutes.  First- 2 cups Bob's Red Mill- Gluten Free/Dairy Free All purpose Baking Flour, 1 cup Brown Rice Flour.  Then because of Dairy Allergies-substituted Dark Choc Cocoa, and then 1 cup Brown Sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  Now, it was not as moist as reported, but in comparison to all Gluten Free/Dairy Free cakes.  It was great!

Thanks Tina, for supplying me with a cake recipe for my egg allergic 2 year old.  I made this into cupcakes, frosted them with store bought vanilla frosting, topped them with mini M&M's and had not one left!  My older kids didn't even notice the difference (the frosting was plenty sweet).  I did add a little salt as "samanthaapril" suggested.  Thanks again for the egg free recipe, my little guy thanks you too...."mmmm good" he said ;)

This recipe is AAAMMMMAAAAZZZINNNNGGGG!!!!! I had no idea cake could taste so delicious without eggs, milk and butter! OMG. I made my own adjustments though. Nothing major. I added a teaspoon of salt because this enhances the sweet flavour. I also substituted one cup of water with one cup of HOT STRONG coffee simply because I like the taste my chocolate cakes have when coffee is in them. Lastly, I baked it for around 40 mins. People, in one day it was gone! The people in my house LOVED it. Thanks Grandma!

As a child I had this growing up because my Mom learned to make it and it was a cheap cake to make.  My mom would let my sister and I help and it always was moist and yummy!  I first had this cake at my 4th birthday party!  The comments on the salt is very important to the recipe because as another reviewer stated it sets off the chocolate and adds flavor to the cake.  It also helps the cake not rise too much with the activation of the baking soda and vinegar.
My mom always just mixed the dry ingredients together then made 3 wells and put the oil, vinegar and vanilla in them then pour the water over all of it and mix well.

I cut the sugar down because it's just too sweet but this is definitely a keeper in our family.  Great chocolate taste and moist too.  Easy to make and great for all those who have allergies to nuts and eggs... even great when money is tight and eggs are a luxury....

Loved this recipe as I'm staying away from dairy. The only changes I made was using molasses and dates to sweeten because I don't use sugar. The other thing I did:

Added 1 cup of pecans
1/2 cup of coconut flakes
1/4 cup of raisins (helped with sweetness)

I was able to make 12 cup cakes and a small cake with the recipe.

Thanks! it's so good!

Wonderful! Who would EVER think -less cake was so tasty & moist! I did modify the recipe a bit based on previous reviews to the following: split the sugar between white and brown (1 cup each), 3 teaspoons of vanilla, and added 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon of cinnamon.   Made cupcakes with the batter filling liners 2/3 full and bake for 15 min, let cool in muffin pan for 2 min then move to cooling rack.

I've used this recipe a bunch of times now; it's become a real favourite.  Like others, I've "tweaked" it by adding salt.  It is a runnier batter, but cooks well. Got to admit, I am not a cake fiend, so I might be judging by the 'wrong' criteria, but we have served this at birthdays and parties for the last two years and are always asked for the recipe.  this recipe is the reason I found "All Recipes" in the first place!  If you are trying it, be sure to test the cake with a skewer in the centre as it can be quite "fudgy" and needs to cook well - I read some comments that sound like the cake was undercooked. I really recommend this recipe to anyone who wants to avoid eggs, butter or milk for any reason.

THANK YOU THANK YOU.... I decided to go milk-free because of a severe lactose intolerance last November.  I do well for awhile then I slip back into chocolate bars, cookies, cakes.  I love this cake!!!!! It makes my tummy very happy and I don't get sick...  I took the advice to add 1/2 tsp salt and I added some chocolate chips to the batter.  Mine baked in 35 minutes.  I used a small amount of prepared frosting for this cake and it was wonderful.  I am going to freeze serving size pieces so I can enjoy cake with my family!  Now I am going to give this recipe to all my friends with dairy and egg allergies.

I love this cake!  It was super easy to make and we frosted it with a rich, sweet chocolate frosting (recipe on back of unsweetened cocoa tin--kept it non dairy with soy milk and margerine).  It is really moist and chocolate-y.  I would make this even if I didn't have a daughter who was allergic to dairy.

Fantastic recipe. Has never failed me! I often make these as cupcakes and my advice would be to leave them for a few hours or overnight as the flavour improves greatly. Amazing!

I really did not like this cake and I do not recommend it.   I baked it for my friend who has allergies and... was very dissapointed.  The cake is not very flavorful and has a strange aftertaste.   I have tried lactose and egg free cakes before so I know that there really yummy recipes out there.

I made this for my milk/egg/peanut allergic son's birthday.  I got 29 cupcakes that were done when I checked them at 16 minutes (and maybe even before).  The first test batch was 3-4 stars.  It was just OK, similar to a boxed mix...edible, but not great.  Then I made again and used 2/3 c. cocoa powder and added 1tsp salt, 1 generous tsp of instant coffee grounds, and 1 package of pudding powder.  The cupcakes were dense (but not too dense), flavorful, and moist with these changes.  Frosted with a non-dairy buttercream, yummy!!!!!!

I have made this cake several times in the past month, and I love it every time! I've tried lots of different variations. This recipe is so versatile! I use applesauce in place of the oil and splenda for the sugar, and then I add grated 100% cocao chocolate into the batter (about 1/3 bar) and it is HEAVEN!!!! Especially for someone who can't have dairy! Who knew!? This is a must have in my house now! It's low fat (with the applesauce), low calorie (with the splenda), dairy free and egg free.  Thank you!!

My family has always made this and called it Wacky Chocolate Cake because it lacks most normal ingredients! But It is a delicious cake and does not even need frosting, so it is fairly lower calorie than some other cakes!

No offense, but this didn't taste good at all.  It was sticky, seemed undercooked after an hour of baking, and had hardly any flavor. Didn't taste like chocolate. My friend and I had to stuff chocolate cookies in our mouths to make the taste bearable, and then I put some in the toaster and spread it with melted chocolate. But the cake was DEFINITELY not worth the trouble and time. Sorry, maybe i did something wrong, but i will avert my eyes from this recipe forever.

Excellent recipe!  I made a few modifications - changing the cocoa to 8 tablespoons, adding 1/2 teaspoon salt and sprinkle the top with chocolate chips.  It worked out wonderfully!  The kids really enjoyed the chocolate chips peaking out of the powdered sugar sprinkled on top!  This is an excellent cake for carry-along events - everyone enoys it!

Ok, well this recipe turned out terribly using Splenda (2 cups per the recipe).  I made it for my cousin who recently had a gastric bypass and is unable to digest sugar at this time.  I was so embarrassed!  The cake did not taste of chocolate at all; it only had a heavy baking soda taste.  It also had an aftertaste from the Splenda.  The cake looked good and was done in 25 minutes (in an electric oven); it came out very moist but just very bland.  I followed the recipe to a T and was very careful with my measurements since I was taking this to someone’s house.  I frosted it with whipped cream flavored with a little vanilla and I added a bit more Splenda it that as well.  I don’t know if it is worth another try with sugar or not.

I have learned my lesson - ALWAYS test the recipe before you present it to someone else!

This recipe makes the most delicious chocolate cake I've ever tasted! It is indeed moist and full of chocolate flavor. My one-year-old gobbled it up!I heeded the advice of others to cook it a little longer than the suggested 25 minutes, about 5 minutes more for my oven; the results were outstanding. I also sifted the dry ingredients to help make a smoother batter.  This is certainly a keeper. Thanks for the recipe

This cake is sooooooo good!  The reviewer who suggested adding salt was right!  It makes the cake taste better!  I made this cake for some friends as  a thank you gift when I discovered I had no eggs!  I was afraid it would be too plain, so I made the caramel sauce recipes submitted by Cassie on this website.  I cut the cake into squares and drizzled the sauce over it and man was that good! (I saved some of it to sample to make sure it tasted alright.)  I would heartily recommend this to everyone!  Great recipe Miss Tina Demasi-Lemons! :)

I was looking for something simple to make to satisfy my craving for something sweet and something chocolate.  This totally fit he bill.  I had all the ingredients in the pantry and it is so easy to make.The cake turns out surprisingly great.  It is even better the next day.  I made a simple homemade frosting both times I made it.  The first time I made a simple butter-cocoa frosting and a vanilla frosting the second time. My family raved about both.

A good moist cake.  But it was not very sweet.  It definitely needs a sweet frosting or fudge sauce or something to add sweetness to it.

This was a great cake... I had no eggs but craved a cake and it was moist and chocolaty!
I drizzled hot fudge over the cake just prior to serving and it was perfect!  No need for icing.

I made this after reading positive reviews. I added half brown sugar and heaping T's of cocoa. After tasting the batter, I began to have doubts. It was terribly acrid! Yuck! But, having never tried a vegan cake before, I decided to bake it anyhow. Let me tell you, it was flavorless and downright AWFUL. I "fixed" it by poking holes in the top, pouring cream of coconut over, letting that soak, then icing with fudge sauce and topping with toasted coconut. It was very good after the adjustment, but I would never EVER use this recipe again. Perhaps it is good for people who can't eat butter, eggs, or milk, but seriously, I hope vegan cooking can be better than this!

I used milk instead of water (I just had no eggs) and baked 12 muffins and a small rectangular cake. The cake is surprisingly moist. With the price of eggs these days, this will surely be my go-to recipe :-)

This is a fantastic recipe!  
I am fasting for 40 days Greek Orthodox Easter (as I do every year)  and the traditional cake recipes for this time of year are very heavy and outdated.  
So I gave this a try.  What a surprise! Chocolate!  It is perfectly rich tasting super moist and satisfying.   Did not change a thing except add 1 teaspoon of salt.  Baking time in my bunt form took 45 minutes.  This weekend I will be making it again for the Girl Scouts in cup cakes' version.  
This is already kept this in my cherished recipe file.

Excellent recipe. You can also replace the 2 cups of water with 2 cups of freshly squeezed orange juice. Instead of the chocolate powder add around 1 to 2 teaspoons of orange zest.

Ridiculously moist, very easy to put together in a pinch, and great for people with allergies. For people who are used to the depth of flavor present when eggs and milk and butter are used, you won't find them here, so expect an altogether different flavor of cake. I made 24 cupcakes and a teddy bear silicone cake (would fit a 9x9 pan) in very little time. Cupcakes took 15 minutes for me. Bear took 25. Toothpick it if you're not sure. Thank you for this!

Awesome recipe! Took it to a picnic where there were kids with food allergies, and was a hit! 

I did add salt, roughly a teaspoon, and added chocolate chips. I also found that the pan will need more than a casual spray to keep it from sticking.

I have made many vegan cakes and this one tops them all. I usually only make them for my son since he is the one with the allergies. The whole family actually liked this cake and it stayed moist and we just love this recipe, Thank You :)

LOVED IT!!! I modified this out of necessity, sorry, but so thankful for your submission!! I didn't have egg, milk, and butter, and NEEDED a b-day cake for my 9y/o.  Also, I used whole wheat flour, 1 cup sugar and 2 box strawberry jello mix, and no cocoa. Our cupboards were bare.... And as I bit my nails hoping it would be edible, everyone LOVED IT.  Needless to say this is our cake recipe from now on!  Thinking of adding bananas next time with cream cheese  frosting.  THANK YOU for helping me out of a pickle..

Eggless, butterless, milkless, and TASTELESS. Very moist. This wasn't done in the middle though even after baking for 35 minutes. It rose up nicely and looked decent, but had no flavor. We only ate a couple of bites. Even my hungry teen didn't like this. Sorry :(

What gives this cake flavor is the SALT, which this recipe omits, vinegar, and of course the chocolate. I actually have this recipe from a vegan cookbook and the differences are: 8 TBSP Cocoa instead of 6; 3tsp Vanilla instead of 2; and 1 full tsp of salt! I love the recipe I already have and think I will stick with it, but this one is good as well and would be particularly useful for those who are also watching their salt.

a good staple recipe - i had both eggs & butter in the house but when you bake a lot, they go fast! it was nice to not have to use some. i replaced the oil with applesauce & realized at the last minute that i was out of baking soda, so i tossed in another 2 tsp of baking powder. the cake turned out good - heavy & moist although i think next time i will add extra vanilla or another extract - the flavor was a little bland.

I scaled the recipe into half of amount and baked in Bundt pan. It turned out great with great texture - very moist and soft, but the taste is a little dull without any icing on it. I should've followed other review and substitute water to coffee. I will bake this cake again whenever I am out of butter/eggs.

I needed to make a dairy-free dessert for a family and saw this cake. I had all of the ingredients on hand and baked it in my bunt pan for about 40 mins at 350.  I turned out really nice and I simply dusted it with powdered sugar.

I had to bake the cake for 40 minutes.  I have no allergies, I was just curious about this cake.  It turned out great.  A great chocolate flavor without being too sweet.  I did add a 1/4 tsp of salt as others suggested and used olive oil because it is the only oil I keep.

I made this for my one year old's birthday.  He has egg and milk allergies.  It turned out great!  I made it twice, once as a 2 layer round cake and once as cupcakes.  I made some modifications:  I used 1 c granulated and 1 c brown sugar, added 1/2 t salt and 1/2 t cinnamon, and increased the cocoa to 1/2 c.  Makes 24 cupcakes, bake for 20 minutes.

I found store bought frosting that has no milk ingredients.  Mentioning the brand might be a no-no (?) but it was cream cheese flavor, of all things.  Read the labels carefully, and you might be pleasantly surprised like I was!

It was very useful. I'm not the kind that as a lot of supplies at home so, this was very helpful. I like it, and it is quite tastely, but you might want to add some salt.

A cake the whole family can eat. My daughter has several food allergies including eggs and my sister-in-law is allergic to milk. The cake take care of both of them. I added the salt and brown sugar suggested in other reviews and baked this cake in 2-9 inch round pans. I didn't have any trouble with the edges burning, but I use magic cake strips on my pans which are designed to bake cakes evenly. This cake came out flat as can be with the strips. I filled it with cherry pie filling. My daughter and my sister-in-law both thought it was great. Everyone else in the family seemed satisfied with it also.

Excellent recipe. I didn't have any cocoa and it still turned out great. It tastes just like a cake I make regularly that has milk, eggs and butter! I sprinkled coconut on the top before baking, which added a bit of interest. I found I had to bake the cake a little longer than recommended. It's a very moist cake that's quite sweet.

I had NOTHING on hand last nite and we were dying for something sweet. I thought I'd try this recipe and we all LOVED it! I did use 8 tbsp. cocoa, as others suggested, I also used 2/3 cup brown sugar in place of part of the regular granulated and also some strong brewed, cold coffee for about 1/2-1 cup of water until the consistency looked good. I made an icing out of heavy whipping cream and 10x sugar and we devoured this. My husband and brother-in-law both said they liked this cake better than any other chocolate cake ever - it was better than the creme cakes at the grocery bakery. Definitely a keeper!

I made this cake for my 2 yr old's b-day.  He is allergic to eggs and hadn't had cake before.  I followed the recipe exactly. The cake turned out perfectly, I set the timer for 25 mins and kept an eye on it, took it out at 30 mins, all ovens are different though.  It was so moist, I used store bought choc. icing.  My only complaint was that it wasn't all that chocolatey.  Maybe I would add more sugar or less cocoa next time.  It had that plain "cocoa" taste you know?  Anyhow it was nice for my son to have a B-day cake!!  Thanx.

Not bad for an eggless, butterless, milkless cake!!  This recipe saved me after my daughter volunteered to bring cupcakes for a school birthday party.  I had everything on hand and ended up glazing them with a mixture of icing sugar, cocoa powder and water.

This recipe is so  good. I added an extra 2 tbsp. of cocoa powder and it turned out so moist and yummy. This is a real treat even for people who aren't vegans or have food alergies. You seriously have to try it, you won't believe how good it is until you do.

I made this last night for my sons family birthday party and everyone just loved it. Reminds me of my moms chocolate mayonnaise cake. I used two round cake pans and just kept and eye on it for doneness. I used the 7 minute frosting I found on here too. Was just GREAT!

Delicious - moist and excellent texture.  Used half Splenda and half white sugar, otherwise followed recipe exactly.  Trying to cut down sugar, so simply dusted top with powdered sugar instead of frosting and was pleased with the results.  So easy to make, too!  Thanks for this one and will definitely be using again.

I read some reviews prior to making it and some people said it tasted bland, Never making it I didn’t want to risk it...so I added 1 teaspoon of salt as well as 2 tablespoons of coffee grounds(it makes chocolate taste rich)  and this cake taste absolutely phenomenal it’s moist and super delicious. I also made cream cheese frosting from scratch to pair with it.  I highly recommend this recipe and it’s my new to go recipe for chocolate cake.

I made this cake because I wanted dessert but was out of milk and butter (too cold to go to the store!). I read the reviews first and added a 1/4tsp salt as recommended by many.  In addition, just to add flavor, I added 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp coffee grounds. Also, I melted about 1/3c of peanut butter and drizzled it on top before I baked it (ran a knife through to swirl it!). the peanut butter really added a wonderful touch!

This is a great recipe. You can do a lot with it. I hate chocolate cake. So, in place of the cocoa, I ended up using vanilla sugar and adding cinnamon, and making cupcakes. It ended up tasting like this pumpkin pie spice bread a store I know makes (I added NO pumpkin). It is a little too dense to call it a cake, but it is a wonderful quick bread! I did add salt as well because others said it is better that way.
You really can do anything with this recipe!

This was delicious but I did substitute the water with cooled black coffee added a 3/4 tsp salt and just before baking placed a Hershey kiss in each cupcake. I topped with chocolate frosting that had a hint of espresso powder and WOW what a hit. Will make these again for sure....

I liked it to the point where the color and taste is fine.  The consistency of the batter was really liquidy. This made the first time I tried it to sink.  It also made it like a chocolate lava cake.

Simply delicious - modified the recipe a bit based on earlier recommendations by others eg. replaced water with a cup of milk and a cup of strong coffee, half of sugar with a cup of brown sugar, added some salt, balsamic vinegar (ran out of white!!!). Threw some choc chips in, but cake sunk slightly in middle when cooked. Took 40-45 minutes baking time. Used chocolates to decorate the shallow well :) looked great and taste wonderful!!!

Great recipe! There are no dairy allergies in our house, but my boyfriend has having a "cake emergency" the other night and decided he couldn't live without dessert. We were out of butter, and everything I usually use in place of it (margarine, crisco, applesauce) so I needed something like this. I took some advise of other reviewers and added 1 teaspoon salt, and did half brown sugar, half white. We loved the results. Moist, chocolatey, and you would never know it's dairy free. A keeper!

This was a good chocolate cake recipe!  Very simple and moist.  I followed it almost to a tee, but add another teaspoon of vanilla and half a cup of chocolate chips and half a cup of peppermint chips.  Think I shall not add the peppermint chips next time, but this would taste excellent at Christmas with some chocolate sauce and vanilla ice cream.  This one is a KEEPER!!

This is a great cake!  I found this recipe while searching for an allergen-free strawberry shortcake.  It was my bday and I wanted to make a cake that was free of the stuff my 2 1/2 year old is allergic to so he can have cake too, and not apple pie like usual.  This was perfect, very moist and yummy considering it's missing butter and eggs.  I omitted the cocoa powder for a white cake and it was still good.  Watching my baby devour cake and icing was the best bday gift!  Thank you!

This was a great cake. I double sifted the flour to ensure it would be light and fluffy. I also wanted a white chocolate chip cake so I simply replaced the Cocoa powder with more all purpose flour and then added my dairy free Chocolate chips and a whole  vanilla bean, scraped.

I made this b/c I was looking to try a cake from scratch as I've never made one before.  When I saw that it was safe for my sister (egg allergy), my niece (milk allergy), and my husband (nut allergy), I was sold.  The cake came out moist and chocolatey.  I did add the salt, as others suggested, and I think I added a bit more cocoa powder than called for, but I think it came out wonderfully.  Even my brother-in-law who hates cakes from scratch loved it!

Excellent recipe! I took advice from other comments and added about 1/2 tsp salt and used slightly heaping spoons of cocoa. baking powder/soda. I had vanilla sugar I used too. It makes an amazingly moist rich cake eaten right from the pan!

Wow, just wow. I'm so impressed with how this recipe turned out. I was so hesitant while preparing it, and the vinegar gave it such a weird smell before baking. I also substituted applesauce for the oiland added chocolate chips. The finished product was a big hit for my Easter dinner. No one believed it had no eggs, oil or butter. And it tasted even the next day out the fridge. A definite winner.

I have been looking for this recipe for years. ONE TIP: Sub 1 cup of the water for dark black coffee. It gives the cake a much richer taste!

This recipe makes an excellent cake! I've made it many, many times, and each time it turns out AMAZING! Personally, I add a pinch of salt to the dry ingredients and choc. chips to the batter at the end.  DELICIOUS! Thanks so much for the recipe!

Soooooo good with vanilla ice cream (for those who aren't lactose intolerant). I baked it for my egg/peanut allergic son. I didn't think that such cakes could taste good. It was so moist and chocolaty. I cut back the sugar to 1.5C with 0.5C of brown and rest white. Added 1/2tsp salt and several handful of chocolate chips. Thank you for the recipe.

This recipes is really good if you have run out of eggs and milk and still want some cake like I did... however, I fancied some lemon cake so I swapped the cocoa powder for some cornstarch and added some lemon flavouring. Somehow the batter turned out very runny and I ended up baking it for about an hour but the result is really good! It's very moist and hasn't lasted long :-)

Great cake!  One of the moistest and best rising cakes I've made (not that I have the hugest repertoire in cakes though), but very surprising being dairy free - yummy, moist and looks good - I'm happy =>

This is a really great recipe! We are trying to cut way back on dairy in our family and so I was searching for dinner recipes and stumbled across this. Since my son's bday is next week, I thought I would try it out. We all loved it! Much better than a store bought or box cake mix. We dont even have food allergies, and I would still choose this cake recipe.
I read all the previous reviews and like others suggested, I added 1 tsp salt and subbed 1/2 brown sugar. (I also like my chocolate cake pretty rich, so I threw in a handful of choc chips). One person suggested substituting juice for the water and so I tried that out too (subbed 1/2 apple grape juice for water) and I personally thought it made it slightly too flavorful/sweet. I will only use water next time. My cake wasn't done in the suggested cook time, though. It took 30 minutes.
This cake has a great texture and is really moist. Doesn't need any icing. Powdered sugar on top is perfect. And it was such a simple recipe and I already had all the ingredients. I will definitely make it for the party (and future parties!). Thanks!

This is sooo moist. It is not too sweet. I love this cake. I will make this again. It was from paper to coming out of oven in 1 hour. That is a fast cake and oh so good.

This is a great recipe if you have someone with allergies to milk or eggs!  I was pleasantly surprised at how well the cupcakes I made for my daughter to take to school for her birthday turned out!  I really can't say enough about this recipe.  I did add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp almond extract.   If you didn't tell anyone that it didn't have eggs, milk or butter in them, they would never know!  The chocolate frosting I used is from the food allergy network website:

One of my daycare children has an egg allergy so we used this recipe for birthday cupcakes today.  I was pleasantly surprised how light and tasty they were.  I might add a little more cocoa next time.  I half recipe yielded 12 good sized cupcakes.

I have several vegan friends and friends with special dietary needs- it was wonderful to have a cake to make for them that tasted GOOD, not like it was something made together from the ingredients they could eat.  Only change- I used 2/3 cup cocoa.  Chocolate is good!

LOVED this!!! I was out of soda, so I didn't use any. I added 1 tsp. salt and upped the cocoa to 3/4 cup. I also used 2 heaping tsps. of baking powder. I had no white vinegar and used cider instead. I also added 2 tsp. instant coffee to the water. The batter was not runny at all like another review said. I couldn't resist licking the spoon.  Thanks for a GREAT recipe!!!  (next time I'll try adding peanut butter chips. mmmmm.)

Tina thanks so much for this recipe!!!  I can't have eggs or dairy, so having any cake was a thrill.  But this cake was good and tasted like a normal cake with eggs.  I took the advice of others and added 1 teaspoon of salt.  Also I increased my cocoa up to 3/4 cup.  I baked mine in 2 eight inch round pans.  It came out rich and dark.  The edges did come out almost burnt, so you have to watch it closely.  Everyone liked it, including my husband who is afraid to eat anything that fits my allergy diet!  I will try the round pans again and put raspberry jam between the 2 layers.

My brother (13 years old) called this "the worst cake he's ever tasted" and said it was "bitter, tasted like glue". I was so upset with the waste. I don't eat cake, so I never tried it myself, but I do bake a lot of them, and this is one I will definitely not be baking again.

As a professional cake decorator, I was stumped when a customer asked for an eggless cake because of allergies.  So I tried this recipe and added salt as suggested by some of the other reviewers.  I tested the recipe first on my family.  The recipe made 3 - 6" round cakes.  I added mini chocolate chips to one of the cakes.  I was thrilled with the outcome.  All three of the cakes turned out great!  My husband especially liked the one with the chocolate chips.  My customer really enjoyed the sample of the cake I took her and placed her order right then!  We were both excited to have found an allergy-friendly cake!

This is one, while it tastes a bit different, is still really yummy... I've got friends who are wild about it and who won't touch it - so it's an an adore or hate situation. Great when you don't have much on hand and rises wonderfully!

I am so happy that I found this recipe.  I have it printed and book marked for all of my son's birthday parties.  I got rave reviews from all the two year olds and moms.  No one could beleive they were dairy and egg free.  They are great topped with white frosting and sprinkles

I made these into cupcakes (baking 22 minutes), added butterscotch chips, and substituted applesauce for the vegetable oil. The chips sunk to the bottom because the batter was so thin, and the overall appearance/color wasn't the best, but they tasted great. Especially good with peanut butter frosting.

This is so yummy.  I added chocolate chips which made it even chocolatier.  This does take longer than 22 minutes.  I baked it for 30 minutes, and it came out great (9x13 in pan).  It is moist and has really good texture.  It's a great low-fat alternative.  It tastes great with the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese Frosting on it.

This cake was a breeze to make! Not too sweet and very rich tasting - will try some variations on this one for the next birthday! Oh yeah - I had no cocoa so I subbed the equal amount of Quik powder for it and threw in a 1/4 cup on chocolate chips - turned out just fine!

Great recipe. Quick and easy.  I served these with vanilla  frosting and sprinkles.  I think without the frosting, they were not quite sweet enough.  However, they were just perfect with the frosting.  I will make this one again.

Lacking vinegar I substituted lemon extract. Came out amazing! Fluffy, spongy, moist delicious cake! I would recommend adding another 6-12 tbsp of cocoa if you want to bring out the chocolate flavor. Great for broke, hungry , stoners with random ingredients and no baking experience

This cake is the best cake I've ever made in my whole entire life. I would totally recommend this to you especially if you love chocolate cake. It is very moist which I love. I would recommend adding chocolate chips and chocolate frosting though as it doesn't have as much flavor as I desired. I made this wonderful cake after discovering I had run out of eggs to make my pumpkin muffins. Oh no! I then stumbled across this cake and thought that I should at least try it. You see, I was craving something sweet right at that very moment. I sprinted over to my little, rusty, old kitchen and pulled out my ingredients. Baking the cake was a wonderful experience which I shall cherish for all of eternity. If you want to feel these amazing emotions as well, BAKE THIS CAKE!!!! You will never regret it. NEVER. I have only made it once, just yesterday in fact, and it has already been consumed. Or should I say inhaled? Don't you fret though and think I ate it all myself. oh no no no. You see I have a VERY large family. 6 people to be exact. Whenever there is something yummy in the house it will for sure  be  gone in an instant. I don't under stand why there are so many bad reviews on this cake because it is soooooo good. Well anyways I will thank anyone who has read this far on my special review on this very special cake.

This didnt have much taste. I added chocolate chips in the recipe and powdered sugar on top. It took an hour to bake not 25 mins.  If you have limitations and cant eat eggs then maybe you will like this cake i would just say add frosting to give it some taste. I just ran out of eggs and milk so I thought I would give this recipe a try. For some reason the top part that crispied up tasted eggy... very odd... not a big fan of this cake would not try this recipe ever again.  Gave it 2 stars just because it is edible.

My grandsons have food allergies, so I tried this recipe. I can’t attest to how good the original recipe because I made changes. I took others’ advice and used 1 c white sugar and 1 c brown sugar, added 1/2 t salt. I replaced water with oat milk. Baked it in two 8” square pans. They took about 35 minutes to bake. I am beyond impressed with how good it is. Even my SO, who thinks anything allergen-free can’t be good, thinks it’s delicious.

I made it using two  round cake pans and one little one (for a first birthday smash cake). PLEASE NOTE:  If you use round cake pans be sure to grease your pans and use parchment paper.  I didn't do that, and it was a huge struggle to get the cakes out of the pans.  Thank goodness it's a dense cake - I was able to put it all together with the help of a lot of icing!  Followed other's advice and added salt.  Also, thought it was lacking a little in chocolate taste so I used canned cherry filling between the layers and it really helped the flavor.   Everybody liked it.  All in all, it was good and I would use this recipe again for my granddaughter's egg allergy.

This is an old recipe to me. So good, easy, and vegan! I use one cup cold coffee and one cup water instead of all water.
This cake is good with a frosting, or powdered sugar, or thawed frozen dark sweet cherries, and whipped cream.

I  have made this WWII recipe since I was a kid shortly thereafter.  We called it Wacky Cake. Others called it Puddle Cake or Crazy Cake..  Always yummy. Not very nutritious, but few people are allergic. Linda Owens  PS You can add an egg or two if wanted.  And I usually decease the sugar.  You can add an extra cup of water before baking to make Pudding Cake, but it must be eaten immediately.

I noticed there was no SALT in the receipe, but I followed exactly. Cake has very little flavor.  I will make again w a teaspoon of salt.  Sad because that is s lot of ingredients to waste.

Such a great, light, chocolate cake. I sometimes drop some chocolate chips inside the batter or make a chocolate chip+coconut oil frosting, to make it a little bit more interesting and a little sweeter.

I have been making this cake for about a year now. I have many allergies which include soy, eggs, and peanuts. Not only is this cake soy, free, egg free, AND peanut free, but it’s amazing to. It makes me feel good that I can still enjoy things while I’m stuck with allergies. Thanks A BUNCH !!!!!

I added a pinch of salt, an extra tablespoon of Cocoa Powder. I substituted Honey for the Sugar. I cut the water by 1/4 cup and used a cup of Honey. Next time I will use 1/4 cup less Honey and 2 T extra oil. But this cake was very moist and I served it with a Homemade Caramel Sauce and Homemade Peanut Butter Ice Cream. Big hit with family.

This cake greatly surprised me! I had practically nothing in the house, but I had enough to make this and I absolutely was NOT disappointed! It was moist, flavourful and fluffy! 

The only adjustments I made were to add a tsp of almond extract in addition to the vanilla and about half a cup of coconut flour, as I ran out of all purpose. 

I also used a smaller pan and made a single sized version so the cake wouldn't overflow.

Thank you very much for the yummy recipe and all the helpful reviews! For my first attempt, I halved the quantities, and to that I added 1/4 tsp salt & 1/2 Tbsp Vanilla. I also substituted the water with milk and half quantity of white sugar with brown sugar. 
In my next attempt I am thinking of substituting the oil with ghee.

I made this but with rye flour- I had to add at least an extra 10 min of cook time - it was the first time I used rye flour and I rarely have an idea of what I'm doing but it turned out pretty good, my BF really liked it. The rye flour adds a texture that not a lot of people would care for, we liked it and he suggested adding a woopie pie icing to it which I will try in the future.

I will definitely make this again! So easy and moist! My only recommendation is to bake it longer than the 20-25 min in the instructions. It was really jiggly in the middle after that period of time. I don't like doughy centers in cakes or brownies so I baked this one at least another 15 min. It fell some when I took it out but it was still good and not a bit dry.

I made it according to the directions but I had to bake it about twice as long.  It's not bad. Pretty crumbly. I think I'm just used to normal cake but this would be great for vegans or those with allergies.

I have made this 3 times since finding the recipe.  All three times it came out wonderful.  I did add the 1/2 tsp of salt as recommended in the suggestions.  I forgot the baking powder the last time and it still came out wonderful. Thanks for the recipe.  I have recently started going gluten free and paleo as often as I can.  This is a cake that I will for sure make again.

Its not the best cake I've ever made, but the kids like it, so there is that. It is moist, but its not sweet like you'd expect a cake to be. Also, its not very flavorful, you def. need a frosting or icing or something. I won't be making this again, but its not the worst thing I've ever eaten.

Ran out of eggs but wanted to make dessert, so I tried this recipe.  I cut it by 1/3 to bake in 9x9 pan, which took 30-35 min to bake.  I used milk instead of water, added 1/4t salt as others recommended, and used cider vinegar since it's what I had on hand.  I also added about 1/3 cup mini chocolate chips. The cake came out moist and fluffy with good flavor; the mini chocolate chips melted in, leaving little spots of chocolatey goodness!  This would also be good a la mode or with frosting, but we ate it plain.  I'll definitely make it again!

Superb and perfect eggless butterless cake. A treat for people with allergies to eggs. 

If there is a recipe without gluten, eggs and butter it would be an ideal cake for people with gluten and egg allergies. 

Thanks so much. I recommend this so much for anyone who would like to try it. Keep it up!

Overall, not bad for an eggless and dairy free cake. However, it did lack some flavour in comparison to the classic chocolate cake. The texture of the cake was quite crumbly despite being quite sticky and moist when consumed. Perhaps a common characteristic of eggless cakes is the lack of aeration? A thick layer of chocolate topping definitely helped to spruce up the cake!

Excellent cake.  Based on some other reviews, I put in a half tsp of salt and increased the cocoa powder.  Served to 50 people - it was the featured dessert at our seniors' activity centre lunch and all comments were very complimentary - how good it was and how moist.  It didn't need icing - we just sprinkled icing sugar over it.  I absolutely don't get some of the negative comments. Quick, easy and delicious - I'll be making this again.

I have made this cake many times.  Instead of mixing in a bowl, I placed dry ingredients directly in the baking pan, made "wells" with my spoon and put each wet ingredient in a well, then mixed with a fork.  Be sure to get into the corners and incorporate all of the dry ingredients. Bake as directed.  It is a delicious cake and I loved the ease of preparation too.  That is the way I first learned to make this cake when the recipe was given to me by a family friend for a 4-H demonstration that I needed to do.

I love how easy this is to throw together! And it is so moist, love the texture. I did add a pinch of salt, made no other changes. This is the second time I have made this and plan on making it again when another cake craving hits me hahaha.

This cake was highly disappointing.  I asked what everyone thought, and after a moment of silence the eight year old piped up saying, "It tastes like water."  When I tried it for myself, I found her description sadly accurate.  It was passionless, like a cake that had given up on life, its flavor reflecting a bleak view of life without hope, depth, or color.  It was as depressing as trying on swimsuits.

Surprisingly good and moist!  Best the next day for that rich chocolatey flavor to come out that lacked flavor the first day.  Followed suggestions to add salt.

I love this recipe. The cake is a bit dense, but still moist and very chocolatey. I used a bundt pan and I had to bake it for about 50 mins.

Amazingly good! I added a box of vanilla pudding mix, used heaping teaspoons of baking soda and baking powder. I also used heaping tablespoons of the unsweetened cocoa. I used 2 cups of rice milk instead of water and added 1 teaspoon of salt! Delicious, moist cake that I frosted with homemade buttercream frosting.

Excellent recipe. Tweeked it a little though. No chocolate,substituted diet cherry soda in place of water, splenda instead of sugar. Added dried cranberries and 2 tbsp of brown sugar as well as a 1/2 tsp salt. It turned out delicious. My kids and grandkids had no idea about the cake they just kept coming for more. This made a great breakfast bar. Yummy!!

Turned out quite nicely, though not as moist and crumbly-looking as in the photo - and went well with Duncan Hines vanilla frosting. Mmm.

Okay, the texture and moisture of this cake was great, but, there was NO TASTE at all!! The only way that this cake was even palatable was when it was smothered in butter cream :( I definitely don't recommend this if you are not allergic to eggs or dairy. The only reason I made this was because I was out of eggs and butter. Overall, it was not a good cake.

This is a great chocolate cake. I usually don't frost my cakes because of concerns for calories, but with this cake I can without feeling guilty. The cake its self is very moist. I cut this recipe in half to bake in a square 8x8 pan. I also used half brown sugar (other half white sugar), added some salt, put one table spoon more cocoa powder, and I sprinkled mini chocolate chips over the batter to give the cake a crust since it is so moist. For such a low fat cake it is very delicious!

I had to take a cake to a nut free-dairy free house and thought I'd make this one up and it was delicious.  It was very moist - the only variation I made was per some other reviews and I added about a 1/2 tspn of salt and used heaping teaspoons of cocoa - even still it could have used a bit more cocoa.
I used cake release and flipped the cake onto a cookie sheet and iced it with a Betty Crocker dairy free whipped icing.

Excellent Recipe.
I just added a big pinch of salt to bring out the chocolate.
Was a great hit -people could not believe it was egg less and milk less!

This recipe creates a moist, chocolatey cake with a great brownie-like flavor if you increase the cocoa powder to 8T, vanilla to 1T, and add 1/2t of salt as suggested by other reviewers.  I added fudge-flavored store bought frosting (no milk or eggs listed in ingredients) and made cupcakes that were a hit at my daughters 5th bday party and preferred over the store bought cupcakes!  My daughter actually liked them better sans frosting!  Excellent recipe and highly recommended by our family!

My first attempt at making vegan cake and it was fairly easy.  My friend makes this cake all the time with a few changes and of course I had to follow…   Added ¼ teaspoon of salt and used 1 cup of cocoa.  Served with balsamic strawberries from this site.

Excellent cake after some minor changes/additions. I made this one night when I was craving chocolate cake, but was out of eggs. I added about 1/4 t. of salt and 6 heaping T. cocoa powder. I also added 8 oz. semi-sweet chocolate (according to the directions on my can of my Saco unsweetened cocoa powder) because I had no chocolate chips. I substituted olive oil for vegetable oil and one cup of milk for one cup of the water. This cake took about twice as long to cook as the recipe suggests. Once I took it out of the oven I poked holes all over and generously coated the top with Hershey's chocolate syrup. Three days later this cake is still more moist than any other cake I have ever made. Without the chocolate syrup on top it probably would not have had enough of a chocolate flavor for me, but with it this cake is one of the best cakes I have ever eaten.

I needed a cake but didn't have any eggs on hand. This one saved the day and was surprisingly good. Moist, light... after making this one, it made me wonder why I ever put eggs in a chocolate cake in the first place! The only thing I did was increase the cocoa because 6T isn't half enough; for a cake this big you need about 2/3 cup. Turned out great-- a real keeper!

I thought that for an eggless, milkless cake this was great! I added extra cocoa like other reviewers said. I used it for a 1st birthday cake and cupcakes for a boy who was allergic to just about everything! It was pretty good! The reason I gave it four stars is because it had a different aftertaste that wasn't that great, but I had to use olive oil since he was allergic to soy which is in vegetable oil, so that may have been why. I recommend this cake for anyone with egg allergies and lactose intolerance!

I hope I did something wrong (not sure what it was).  This cake was dry, NOT chocolaty, and had a distinct baking soda after taste.  I won't be making this again.

I'm always looking for good dairy free recipes that don't use hydrogenated fats. This is a very moist, dense cake with great chocolate flavor. After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and increased the cocoa to a full 1/2 cup. I baked it for 30 minutes, and it still was almost too moist... next time I will try baking a little longer (or maybe reduce the liquid a bit?). I'm still giving it 5 stars though, because my husband and daughter raved over it, and I thought it was pretty darn delicious too.

My mum and I have been making this cake for years, it's my favourite, but we always double the cocoa.. i think I use a 1/4 cup. Also try adding cherries or crystalised ginger, marshmallows or choc chips, coffee instead of water, all these variations work well and I'm sure you could come up with more!

This recipe turned out great & tastes wonderful! I wasn't sure how it would turn out but didn't have many choices since my daughter is allergic to both eggs & milk. I was pleasantly surprised! We've made this several times both as a cake & as cupcakes. Highly recommended!

This cake was good.  It didn't really taste like anything was missing. The texture was almost the same as any box cake you can find.  I used this as a cake for little girl whose birthday cake I had to make.  She's allergic to eggs, and milk products so this was perfect.  I had some trouble getting it to release from the pan so that I could decorate it.  I baked it again though and used parchment paper as a liner and had no issues the second time.  Everyone loved the cake and raved about it!  I used a traditional buttercream icing to decorate it. This was the little girl's first time tasting cake (6th birthday) and she loved it!

My son is allergic to all dairy and eggs so desserts are a huge challenge for him. On his birthday I made this cake and everybody loved it. More then that it was the first time in 7 years he had a chocolate cake and didn't start having breathing problems. He said it was the best birthday present ever.

Was dying for something chocolate, but since I can't have any dairy, looked up and found this cake and made it, following the hints and ideas added for this recipe and added cinnamon to the sprayed pan instead of flour.. more flavor.. came out excellent Hubby likes it too, he had cool whip, I had confection sugar on mine. When I am in the mood will make a frosting for it..am thinking the cinnabons frosting..YUM! Most flavorful. Thank You for the recipes and all the hints..

I made this recipe for Easter and it was a big hit with the whole family. I took the suggestions from the other reviews and used 1/2 brown sugar 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 water 1/2 strong coffee. I used a bundt pan and it baked for almost an hour before the pick came out clean. I served it with raspberry sauce, fresh raspberries and lots of powdered sugar. It was very moist and delicious! I will make it again very soon.

This was a good cake and it turned out beautifully light, fluffy, and moist but the flavor was very plain. (we didn't put any frosting on it)  I did however like the economy involved in the recipe and felt it was a great result of ingenuity and would make it again for my large family.

I was out of eggs and decided to try this recipe out...and it tastes great! I am not sure what other reviewers found unappealing but I like this batter and it was easy to make. I added two extra tablespoons of cocoa because of other reviews, apple cider instead of white vinegar, half white and half brown sugar, added some chocolate chips, and used apple sauce instead of oil. This batter made 30 cupcakes...and took about 25 minutes in my oven. I frosted the cupcakes with store-bought frosting and I know my students and colleagues will never know what they are missing!

Not especially good but not horrible. I'm trying to find our old standby recipe that got lost but this isn't it. It took 40 minutes to bake, not 20-25.

This was just o.k.. It took longer to bake than directions indicated and now I understand why you NEED eggs, butter and milk to make a cake taste like a cake.  If you have food allergies or on a saturated fat free diet, this would be better than no cake at all - I served it with fresh strawberries, whipped cream and chocolate sauce so it was pretty good that way...Didn't really notice the Eggless, Butterless and Milkless Cake.  My family rated it with the 3 stars for o.k.  Only make it again if I'm out of eggs and craving cake.

This cake was interesting.  If you know someone who can't have eggs or milk, then this cake would be perfect and probably very well-received.  It did take longer to bake than stated -- baked in a 9x13 pan, I think it took 35-40 minutes.  My knife came out clean, but when I went to slice this cake, I thought at first I hadn't cooked it enough, as it had a slightly odd texture.  The changes I made were as mentioned by some other reviewers... I added two extra tablespoons of cocoa and 1/2 tsp. of salt.  My son is allergic to milk and milk products, but not eggs.  I made this cake for his birthday. I sprinkled powdered sugar on top and made a raspberry sauce that we served over it.  All the guests said it was good, but I think next time I will try a mayonnaise cake instead.  My husband thought it was just OK.  If you were desperate for chocolate cake and didn't have eggs, mayonnaise, milk or butter on hand, this would probably satisfy you quite well.

I wanted to try something different and this seemed to fit the bill.
Since I was baking for two I reduced the recipe with the handy tool and made out for 8 servings.
I followed the recipe exactly and added semi-sweet choc chips- as suggested by many reviewers.
It came out perfectly, looked delicious and smelled wonderful.

When my husband and I tasted it had a bitter taste that kept getting stronger and stronger the more we ate.

My kids LOVED this cake.  I threw in some chocolate chips instead of icing it since a couple don't like icing.  I'm making it today for my son's  7th birthday.  It is great now that eggs, butter and milk are sky high.

I added 3/4 cups of chocolate chips to the batter and a whole jar of icing on top.  The cake without the icing really didn't have much flavour.  My 5 year old daughter liked it and my husband put it in a bowl and flooded it with milk, he thought it was okay.  I'm not sure I will make it again.

I have a friend and her daughter turns 5 this weekend and she's NEVER had a birthday cake because she is allergic to EGGS!  I found the recipe on your site, I tested this receipe last night and brought it to work today, the office was my official tester..and my coworkers loved the cake! It got nothing but great reviews here.  I've read some of the reviews where people had problems cooking it.  I didn't, the cake baked beautifully!!!It wasn't runny or fudgyy it was perfect. Thank you for this recipe, I'm sure my friend's daughter will enjoy it.

this cake took forever to bake and had an awful taste.  I followed the directions to a 'T' and cannot imagine what was wrong.  I'm not a new baker or cook, so what could have happened?  Everyone raved about it.  Oh well.

This cake was very unusual when baking. The outside burned and the inside barely cooked, despite leaving it in the oven an extra 15 minutes. I didn't have cocoa or vanilla so I used lemon zest and lemon juice instead. Tasted alright, nothing special.

This cake was made for a family celebration during our Easter Holy Week, while we were fasting from animal and dairy products. The ingredients were perfect for our situation and occasion. However, the flavor was rather dull. It wasn't horrible it just wasn't great.

this cake turned out pretty good. i made it for a friend's party where one child is allergic to dairy and she loved it! for people who eat regular cake it's not that interesting but apparently for someone like her it's heavenly.i made half of this  recipe and it came out fine. and instead of a 2 layer cake i made mini bundt cakes with raspberry filling in the middle. that way there's more flavor to it.

I made this cake for Christmas months ago and was a huge hit.  I told my classmates that this was just a chocolate cake.  They had no idea there's no egg, milk or butter.  In the end after hearing everyone's comments i said "well, this is one chocolate cake you don't have to worry about gainning weight!"  My girlfriends asked me"why" and i said "cuz there's no eggs, no mild and no butter!!!" Everyone were shocked.  They couldn't believe that a chocolate cake that's so moist and delicious have no egg, butter, or milk!!! lol.  So far i've given out 20 copies of this recipe. Thank you Tina!!!

Followed the recipe exactly and the cake got done on the edges and was still liquid in the middle.  By the time it cooked all the way through, it had burned on the sides.  Wasn't sweet, wasn't worth the effort.

I made this cake for my Mother's Birthday.  She loved it.  She has been severely allergic to dairy for years.  SHe was so pleased to be able to eat cake for her birthday again.  It was so moist, we all thought it was great.

I made this for my nephew's birthday party.  It was a big hit, everyone liked it and they all knew it didn't have eggs and milk in it.  They couldn't tell the diffrence.  I did make a change I was out of vanilla so I used the same amount of vanilla soy milk.  And it still came out great.

This cake was great after a little "tinkering". I used about a tsp. of salt and added a little more cocoa and sugar and flour until the batter had the right taste and almost the right texture. The batter was a little on the runny side, so I cooked it for about 35 minutes. Overall cake was very good, I mean its not often you find a cake with history behind it!

OMG.....This recipe is wonderful!!! Just playing around, I wanted to make a vegan cake and I was blown away with the taste.  My neice and I prepared the recipe as directed and were more than happy with the results.  I will admit that she was confused with the ingredients....."Auntie, were are the eggs" she asked. Will certainly make this again.  Thank you for sharing.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for this recipe.  I had a copy of it from MY grandmother for years until a flood took it from me.  It has always been a family favorite, though the version I had was smaller.  I almost cried when I saw that this Depression-era cake recipe had survived in someone else's collection, and now its back in mine.

This cake is fabulous! I baked it for my mom's birthday party with lesser sugar and it turned out great. I topped it with marbled dark, milk and white chocolate with almond flakes on the side. It disappeared in a flash!

This was a great chocolate cake.  Since I rarely have eggs on hand, this is a perfect and easy dessert choice!

This cake is really moist and delicious. To get it out of the pan, grease and flour the pan and wait until the cake is mostly cooled before taking out of the pan.

This is the BEST chocolate cake I've ever tasted!! It's so rich and moist. I think it's actually better than the  cake I used to make with eggs and milk. This is one recipe that I will definately use over and over again!
