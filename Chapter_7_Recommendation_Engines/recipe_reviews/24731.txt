very rich but everyone loves it. I thinnned it out a little by using more sour cream and whipped it in a mixer.

I made it twice this Christams, the first time I used regular cream cheese and sour cream, the second time with light cream cheese and reduced fat sour cream. It was just as good. 
bought french bread loaf and sliced and broiled it myself instead of using crackers. Made a difference. 

Also for christmas touch, I layered the top with the cream cheese filling and then used the pesto to make a star on top. festive!

The pesto dip is quite tasty; it was popular with my friends.  I will have to try harder next time to make it pretty.

I served this as an appetizer for Christmas Eve and it was a big hit!  Instead of serving it in a trifle bowl, I served it in individual glass bowls (still layered) along with toasted french bread.

really enjoyed this, and very easy to make. i make a few bowls of it every christmas. if you buy sun dried tomato pesto in addition to regular basil pesto then the red/white/green effect is very cute for christmas. 

also, took the previous commenter's advice and left the top layer the white mixture and then drew a christmas tree on top with the basil pesto.

This dip was a big hit with a church group and my husband. I substituted ricotta cheese and half and half for the sour cream because I didn't have any.  To make the layers look pretty I used icing bags with a number 10 tip.  I also ended with the white  layer on top because my homemade pesto tends to brown quickly.  I served it with garlic melba toasts.

I think this took me all of 10 min to prepare, I had everything on hand for a quick late night snack with crackers.  The guys absolutely loved it-I'm surprised the bowl wasn't licked clean!
I used sun-dried tomato pesto instead of the typical green pesto.  Yummy & Healthy!  Thanks!
**2nd time I made this dip I tried a jar of Bruschetta (no pesto) and it came out very hearty and delicious.

this just didn't work for me , the pesto might have been too oily beacause it bled into the cheese making it curdley.

I made this for a New Year's party this past weekend. Unfortnately, I only had a red glass bowl so it was hard to see the stripes but the dip was rich and delicious. I used pecans instead of walnuts just because I prefer them. The next time I may try using pine nuts.

Super easy, super tasty!  Looks very pretty.  Next time I'll remember to pull out the cream cheese a while before so it is easier to spread and mix.

Taste is good, but very dependent on purchasing a qulality jar of pesto!  A bit difficult to layer...esp the cheese mixture on top of pesto!  May try to pipe in the cheese mixture next time.

I made this for Thanksgiving. A flop. I didn't realise how strong a flavor Pesto is. I did like the cream cheese mixture though. I may try something using that.

Delicious! I thought the amount looked small for my group of 10, but it's strong so with each bite you just need a bit. It was a huge hit (and no need to wait for the holidays to make it)!

I used extra parmesan, added some garlic, left out the walnuts, and used  sun dried tomato pesto in place of the pesto and my family LOVED it.  It was gone way more quickly than I anticipated.

I thought this was ok.  It tasted good, but not much better than any cheese and pesto dip you can buy already prepared at the store.  It's almost impossible to get the stripe-y effect, and while I did get some compliments on it, I don't think I would go to the trouble of trying to make this again.

Very good.  It was a huge hit at the potluck.  I doubled the recipe and used a full container of sour cream to make it less rich, and added garlic powder to the cheese mixture.  The layering was difficult however, and did not turn out as pretty as I had hoped.  But I still had several requests for the recipe.

I'm giving this recipe 3 stars because no one in my family liked it except for my dad.  He loved it!!!  I used my own homemade pesto, which I made from all my leftover basil this summer.  I really did like it, and will definately make it for my dad when he comes over again!

Very good everyone loved it. I used baquets and it was very tasty! The recipe called for a medium serving bowl, but I could only get two layers since the bowl was so big compaired to the ingredents. I would say this recipe should call for a small serving bowl in my opinion. I will defiinatly make it again.

Pesto packs a lot of punch in small amounts. I halved the 6 ounces and added extra parmesan.
It went over well with the foodies. The rest of the group was less impressed. 
It's not the recipe though, they had never even heard of pesto before

So Yummy!  I halved the recipe for my SO and I and we at the whole thing.  If you are having a party I would triple this, at least!  I can't wait to make it again!  Thanks!

Good, but a bit rich.  I took this to a party that 30 people attended, and several people said they loved this spread.  I had to take half of it home with me because it was so rich.
