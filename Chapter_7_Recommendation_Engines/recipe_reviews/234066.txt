If you are looking for something that's not too bold for a starter to a main course this is it. I was pleasantly surprised with the results of this soup. Easy to make and healthy. I used garlic salt to taste, otherwise followed the recipe. I wasn't quite sure how to serve this warm or cold but either way it is good. Instead of a food processor I made quick work of it with my stick blender. Thank you Cassie.

This is a great recipe.  It is exactly what is written:  zucchini soup.  I use this recipe often. I don't follow the directions exactly.  I put all the ingredients in my pressure cooker for 10 minutes then used an immersion blender.  Even my kids, who usually don't like vegetable soups, like it.  I top it off with croutons and parmesan.  If you like simple yet authentic tasting recipes, this is for you!  Thanks for sharing.

A good recipe which everybody can add things to to give it a zest. I do about the same thing which i serve in tiny glasses for the aperitif, some with grilled 'pignons' (=pine nuts but i don't know the name in english!), some with pieces of fried bacon, some with cubed black olives ... It's a good way to use the stuff from the garden and people eat healthy stuff instead of stuffing themselves with usual salty ap√©ritif food. I do the same with tomatoes.

I used UNSALTED Kitchen Basics vegetable stock instead of water to give more flavor. I also added cilantro which I love in all soup, you could add ANY herb you like in addition to the chives. One last addition; 5 clove. Hope these tweaks inspire you.

I like the concept but felt it needed "more."   I added some crumbled cheese after it was done and thought that helped improve it.

I did not care for this recipe, even after adding crushed red pepper, extra garlic, butter, and even some light cream. Not enough flavor.

I used zucchini broth instead of water,  put the onion in garlic in a stock pot and cooked it a bit. Then put that in the food processor along with the cooked zucchini and made puree'! It need a bit more flavor, so some chicken broth would be nice, and a dollop of sour cream on top would be good! Some kind of toasted bread would be great, too!

I had canned the zucchini and a half gallon jar didn't seal, so I made soup! haha!! I had 1 quart and 2 pints of soup! There is a restaurant downtown that sells this and charges a big price.

Just an ok recipe as written.  I agree with those who say it is bland.  Second time around I modified it by adding a couple of seeded diced jalapenos.  Makes a world of difference.

I found this to be really bland. I had to add an awful lot of salt, root ginger and soup bouillon.
