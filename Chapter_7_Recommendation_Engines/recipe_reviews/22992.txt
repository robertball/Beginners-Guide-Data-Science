This easy, no-bake recipe would be an excellent one for a child to make or to help make.  I suggest making this the day before so that the crackers will have time to soften & incorporate well with the other ingredients.

Just OK.  I made this over the holidays just for fun and no one was impressed.  I took one slice and let everyone taste it and the rest ended up in the garbage.  On the other hand this was very attractive and would be a great kid project/snack.

What a surprise! This is so easy and turns out really great! Any fruit flavor of jello would probably be great. Kids and adults will love it!

This is a wonderful dessert! I didn't think that it would turn out well, but it was just perfect. I let it sit in the fridge overnight to allow the applesauce to soak into the graham crackers. I received many compliments from my husband's family. I will definitely make this again!

This was very good.  My whole family liked it.  My six year old son, made it by himself (with a little direction.) We needed to use extra large heaping 1/2 cups of applesauce in order to use up the filling.

I read the user reviews before trying this recipe out and decided there were more good comments than bad, so I went ahead and made it.  Unfortunately, I have to agree with "Megbaum" on this one-- I wasn't impressed.  I think the filling was way too tart, and the whole thing had too mushy of a consistency.  It would be fun and easy to make as a project with a kid, but as far as taste goes, I think users are better off looking for another recipe.
