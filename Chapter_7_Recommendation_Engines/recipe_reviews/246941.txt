Simple, healthy and delicious! I used my griddle to cook the zucchini so I could keep it in a single layer. In addition to seasoning the zucchini with salt and pepper, I also used garlic powder. I cut the recipe down b/c I only had 2 small to medium sized zucchini, and it fit into a fairly small casserole dish (though I did get 4 layers, which I loved), so I would cook all the zucchini first then determine the size dish to use b/c I personally think that a 13x9 dish would be too big. This made a great side for our pasta tonight, but I could totally eat this as a main dish with a nice salad and some garlic bread on the side. We did not miss the usual breading/frying of regular zucchini parmesan and it wasn't nearly as heavy. This is a definite keeper~YUM!!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is an awesome recipe for people on a no carb diet! It is super easy quick and delicious! I put ricotta cheese mixed with a little oregano and mozzarella cheese and mild Italian turkey sausage between the layers as well to make it extra yummy! I highly recommend this recipe!!

I added beef to the meat sauce. I added 2 cups of ricotta and 1 egg to the cheese mix.  I used the zucchini to make 2” ravioli squares.  The zucchini does express a lot of water, so sometimes the dish will be juicy.

very good I boiled the zucchini first instead of frying and baked at 400 for 25 mins.

I needed about 9 zucchini's to create a 3 layer lasagna. Added some spinach and veggie crumbles and it came out great. Baked it for 25 minutes. We're trying to lower carbs so this dish will be a staple with a side salad.

This is an easy recipe and delicious.  Cooked the zucchini on a griddle pan and sprinkled with garlic salt & pepper.  Also added a little ricotta cheese over zucchini before sauce.  Love it!

I used the sauce from The Worlds Best Lasagna recipe on this sight. Otherwise followed recipe. Turned out a little watery but was still super delicious. Will definitely make again.

Absolutely delicious. I cut large and small Zuchini about 3/8 inch browned removed quickly to reduce over cooking. Left nice crunch in the lasagna. I added a little wine, extra tomato, since I had so many, pureed garlic , freshly ground rosemary, which made a big difference in the Italian flavor, since my Ital. seasoning seemed old. A++ recipe. Didn't feel guilty at all with seconds. Topped it off with a little garlic bread and of course a small glass of Chablis. Sorry didn't think to photo the final result. Next time.

I alternated between layers of zucchini and no-boil lasagna noodles to soak up the extra moisture. Still used a ton of zucchini but also got our pasta fix. The perfect way to use those overgrown backyard zucchini!
