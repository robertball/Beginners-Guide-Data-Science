I served this for a Christmas party for 23 people. Everyone loved it! The only thing I did differently was let it simmer on low on the stove all day, and instead of the shredded swiss, I just used 2 thin slices of it that I threw in before it was served. Thanks so much!

I really don't understand how anyone could think this was bland!! The only thing I changed was using 4 cups vegetable broth and 4 cups water. It was soooo goood! Finally a vegetarian onion soup from scratch that is perfected!

Didn't like this recipe at all.  Too much thyme and too much wine.  Maybe it was because I made it in a larger batch size, but this soup just did not taste good at all.

This should be a good soup recipe. I made 1/2 batch but accidentially put in 4 tablespoon of honey (as per full recipe).  So it turned out too sweet, we can only eat some of it with bagels.  I added the "too sweet" leftover soup the next day onto peeled and cubed potatoes, carrot and mushrooms, wrapped them in foil and baked it in oven for 1 hour. It turned out great.  I will definitely try it again.

I made the mistake of only making up half a batch of this...before I could get home the next day when I planned to serve it for dinner the kids and wife had eaten it all. I did get a taste of it though, was very good.

I made this recipe following the directions almost to the letter except I substituted the dry white wine for 1 cup rice vinegar and 1/2 cup vegetable stock, substituted 1 cup butter for 1/2 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil, increased the amount of Swiss cheese to 1 and 3/4 cups (and used Baby Swiss), doubled the thyme, and added some baby Portabella mushrooms when the liquid was coming to a boil. I didn't need to let it simmer for more than 45mins to get the desired consistency.   My husband really liked it, and it definitely reminded me of traditional French onion soup. My only complaint was that the picture was misleading and made it look like a creamer soup. Since I was in a bit of a mood for creamy soup, I added a dollop of 2% Greek yogurt to my serving (you could also use sour cream though it's not as healthy) and it gave the soup a nice smooth consistency.  Will probably make again.

I like the sound of this and can imagine how it would taste. Just one comment I would use vegetable boullion for this recipe. If you use beef broth the recipe isn't veggie.  Secondly for the administrators: By asking for an American zip code you eliminate all non Americans from using and reviewing. Not everyone who cooks lives in the States.

I didn't like this. I cut way back on the thyme and the honey, but it all just tasted weird. The flavors didn't blend well at all. Not recommended. Sorry.

Don't rush this one! It is fantastic when it's simmered the full time. However, I tried it after only 10 minutes and it was so horrible I almost threw it away.  Very glad I didn't because I loved it once the full time had passed.

This is really good!  I'm sure it tastes great as a soup with thick, crusty French bread and lots of cheese with it, but I made it and used it to cook beef tips in the crock-pot with.  I just used regular white cooking wine as that's all I had on hand.  I'm looking forward to getting more stuff when I buy groceries to have it as soup.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was absolutely delicious!  I only had 1 cup of wine left to add (hehehe...) but it didn't seem to be a problem.  Also, we just added the cheese to the serving bowls so we could save the rest.  Great recipe that is destined to become a staple in this house!

This soup was pretty good. The sweetness was suprising, and I missed the beef broth.  I will probably add that next time.

Personally I liked it very much. It has strong taste, that may not suit everyone, but me and my family enjoyed it. I used slightly more wine than it was mentioned in recipe and served it with grilled french baguette topped with parmesan , olive oil and walnuts. It's definitely going to appear on our tables more often with slight tweaks and changes. If i knew we have nice clay bowls that can go into oven i would have covered the top with cheese and let it bake for few minutes. Next time :)
