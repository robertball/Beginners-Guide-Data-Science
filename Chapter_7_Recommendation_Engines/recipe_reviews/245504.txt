Couldn't open the bottle of roasted red peppers so replaced them with one fresh red bell pepper, chopped. Came home from the pot luck with an empty dish.

This was so delicious, I wanted to eat it all myself! I left out the olives because I don't like them, but put in five diced pepperoncinis. Healthy and delicious--can't beat that.
