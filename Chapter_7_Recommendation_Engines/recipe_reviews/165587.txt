I made this recipe for an '80s themed party (and called them Kevin Bacon-wrapped pineapples!)  I was a little nervous that my guests wouldn't like the water chesnuts, but these were gone way before anything else.  I wish I had made more, as everyone was asking for them.  Fantastic, easy recipe that I will definitely make again!

This recipe is definitely a crowd pleaser. For a good size crowd, I would definitely make a few batches. I did change a couple things. I doubled the number of waterchestnuts and i cut the bacon in quarters. When you buy the 20 oz can of pineapple chunks, you will still have a few left over anyway. The only downfall is they are very time consuming to prepare.

Pineapple is the ONLY improvement I need for this old standby appetizer.   Using  pineapple slices instead of chunks makes it easier to wrap.  The pineapple adds enough sweetness and these are salty enough with out soy souce.

Great recipe. Always goes very quickly. It does take some time to prep, and some people may not like handling raw bacon. But it's well worth it--very good flavor, great finger food. We've taken it to both upscale and informal parties and everyone loves it.

I attempted my own version. Fresh pineapple, cut into chunks, wrapped with a slice of thick bacon, held together with a moistened skewer. I first BBQ'd some, and the fat on the bacon melted away leaving buts of bacon....a disaster. Then I tried the same thing but into my oven at 425' for 15 minutes...same thing the bacon did not cooperate. Is the acidity in the pineapple, affecting the bacon crisping up?

I made a double batch of these for New Year's Eve and they were gone well before midnight.  I made the recipe exactly as written, though next time I may change up the marinade with some hoisin sauce or barbeque sauce.  Will definitely make again!

We really enjoyed these.  A much simpler version of other Rumaki type recipes we've used.  I did pre-bake the bacon until almost done and then used it to wrap the water chestnuts and pineapple.  This way, it got crispy and everything else stayed fresh.
I did this recipe as a part of the Western Region's Faceless Frenzy July 2012.

Anytime I make these, they don't last very long. No need for changes on this one.
