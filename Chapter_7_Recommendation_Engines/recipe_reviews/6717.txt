I'm a prolific caterer and I've added this bread recipe to my repertoire because of its quick and easy preparation, and because my clients give it two enthusiastic thumbs up.  One thing I do which no one else had addressed, is divide the batter between two small loaf pans, and then let it sit about a half-hour.  It rises to about double its bulk, forms a crown, and produces a lighter, product ---- to die for!  The 1/3 cup sugar addition others have mentioned is perfect and I add a handful of mexican-blend cheddar and jack cheeses (mix cheese with flour before adding beer.)  Brush with butter and sprinkle with garlic salt half-way through baking, and repeat after removing from over.  Perfect.  Absolutely perfect.

My family has recently become addicted to Tastefully Simple's Beer Bread. At $5 a loaf, it's getting pricy so I tried this and WOW! My family loved it and my son said he like it BETTER! I did add 1/3 cup sugar as another suggested and it was great. I also made the self rising flour that someone posted (1 cup flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt). Thanks for saving me some $$$

I love beer bread.  It is super fast and couldn't be easier to make.  
I don't usually have self rising flour on hand so make my own.
1 c flour, 1 t baking powder and 1/2 t salt
I have used all types of beer, everything from plain bud to hard cider.  Cider is my favorite, it gives your bread a sweeter fruity taste.  The only type I won't use again is Corona (no flavor).  I recently added cheese and peppers to my bread and it was wonderful.  
I have also seen beer bread recipes that call for about a 1/4 cup of melted butter to be poored over the top before baking.  I have done it both ways.  If you use the butter I would decrease to about 2 Tablespoons, that is more than enough.

I didn't have self-rising flour, but I used regular flour and added 1 tsp. salt and 1 T baking powder to the recipe and it worked perfectly!  I wouldn't add more sugar, but I also really don't like this with a strong, dark beer after doing that once.  "Cheap" and basic brands taste better to me.  Now, I make this every time we have a party and there's leftover beer!  Thankfully, I did not need to use my hands to mix it.   I just sifted everything dry, used a whisk to mix it together, added the beer, and then stirred with a wooden spoon.  This was way too sticky to use my hand. I also used a buttery-crust tip I learned elsewhere -- it baked at 375 for 50-55 minutes. Then I pulled it out, ran a butter stick over the top of the loaf, then put it back in for 5 more minutes.  Perfect crust!

If you savor the buttery, crunchy crust bake your bread in a 9x13 pan and pour melted butter over the top before baking. If you like the soft delicious middle bake it in a medium saucepan for a round loaf (my fave). Try 12-ounce cans of soda pop; they will turn the bread colors! I like orange soda in the bread with coarse sugar sprinkled on top before baking. I made it with diet cola and it was excellent! I made it with beer but didn't care for the "beery" taste. I made this recipe along with an identical loaf that was made with the Tastefully Simple Bountiful Beer Bread mix. My hubby couldn't tell which one was the TS mix. He finally decided he liked this recipe better. BTW, I used SIFTED all-purpose flour, 4 tsp baking powder & 1 tsp salt rather than the self-rising flour. Absolutely excellent!  No yeast, no bother, easy, great for savory or sweet.  This recipe will be a staple at our house.

I have been making this bread for a couple of years now.  It is very versatile.  You can add some Italian herbs.  I usually use 1/4 cup of sugar.  Sometimes I use brown sugar or both white and brown.  Light beer makes a very fresh, white bread taste, but I like to use honey lagers for a little richness and depth.  You may also want to note that this bread is much better served fresh.  Toasting the lefovers and eating it with butter or honey is great.  I have also made garlic bread out of it.  I alway have self-rising flour on hand because I make this bread so often.  It can go with so many dips and spreads.

Excellent!  I let mine sit for 30-60 min before baking (while in the pan).  The tips to make your own self-rising flour are so helpful, works great.

This is an excellent recipe.  It tastes just like the "popular expensive" recipe that I have purchased in the past.  2 things you have to remember though, you need to use at least 1/3 C. of sugar and if you do not have self-rising flour and you are using all-purpose flour use 3 tsp. of baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp. of salt.  Also, as the boxed recipe calls for, only mix together until moist.  Do not overmix.  I served 2 loaves at a Superbowl party and no one would have known the difference had I not told them.  Thank you for such a Wonderful, inexpensive recipe.

Haven't ever fixed this that everyone didn't absolutely love it.  I was trying to find a recipe to make that would be cheaper than the Tastefully Simple mix so I increased the sugar in this to 1/3 cup and drizzled 3 T. of melted butter over the top before baking.  You CANNOT tell the difference between this and their mix.

I love this recipe! I too was looking for something similar to the "tastefully simple" version, and I found it. I add butter to mine before baking, melted over top, and I serve with a dill dip.......It is awesome! I can't believe how easy it was!

So easy, so fast. This is arguably the easiest recipe around that doesn't involve pouring cream of mushroom soup over chicken.

Very, VERY good! One problem I have with it is that it's difficult to slice and very crumbly, although I did follow the 1/3 c. sugar advice and perhaps that is the problem. I have found that refrigerating before slicing is helpful. In any case, I've made it several times now, even with simple Miller Lite, and it turns out just fine, except for the crumbliness. I also followed Chef in Blairsville's (CiB) advice and I have to disagree there. Dividing it and allowing it to rest for 30 minutes does NOT make it double nor does it make it more tender. Not sure how CiB came up with that, but it is simply not true. On the other hand, CiB's advice on basting with butter halfway during baking and again afterward is right on the money. I even used the garlic salt too. This wouldn't be complete without mentioning how much I cannot STAND it when people complain in their reviews after not following the recipe. One even went so far as to say that even if they had followed it, it wouldn't have helped. Whatever. It's very good and I don't see anything wrong with it all. My family eats it like they've never had a meal and that speaks for itself. :)

Although the bread did taste great. The recipe itself is not concise in the directions. Like is it baked at 350 degrees or 175 degrees? Also, what about after you put your hands in the batter? Do you need to knead it a certain number of times. I was not very happy with the outcome the top was indeed crunchy perhaps a little to crunchy as well as the sides and bottom. I baked it at 350 for 45 min in a teflon loaf pan (same as I bake other breads in) and it was more than done. Not sure I will make this again or not at least not without some refining of the directions. Sorry, but in my opinion this is not one of the better recipes offered on this site.

I JUST finished eating my first slice of this bread, and it is amazing! A friend of mine made the tastefully simple version for me this past weekend, I can barely taste a difference.  I also did 1/3c of sugar instead of 3 tbsp, and I used a light beer.  This will be something I will continue to make!

I didn't have self-rising flour so I used 3 cups all-purpose flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.  I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  Baked at 350F for 55 minutes.  Tastes just like TS at a fraction of the price.  Next time I'll add some Italian seasonings, fresh garlic, onion powder, and cheddar cheese.  Or a Greek variation using garlic, basil, feta, and black olives.  Or add cheddar and jalepeno chilies...the variations are endless.  YUM!!  Oh, this bread does NOT improve with age.  The next day it will be hard and dry.  So if you make too much to eat on the first day, I would recommend freezing it.

My first time making this beer bread I used Yuenglings Black & Tan - it seemed to impart a nice colour to the bread, and a bit of nutty maltiness.  I didn't have self rising flour so I used someone elses suggestion of 1 cup flour, 1 tsp baking powder & 1/2 tsp salt per 1 cup of self rising flour called for.  Unfortunately that amount is NOT CORRECT -and it showed up in the size of the loaf of my bread.
2nd time making this bread I used Sam Adams Cherry Wheat Ale...and wow, it made the bread slightly sweet!  This time I made sure to use the CORRECT amount of 1 cup flour, 1 1/2 tsp, and 1/2 tsp salt per 1 cup of self rising flour...my bread rose like a champ :D

I plan on trying different types of beer each time I make this bread :)

This was very easy and a nice change.  I also used 1/3 cup sugar and put some melted butter over the top about 10 minutes before removing it.  I never buy self-rising flour so added 3 teaspoons baking powder and 1.5 teaspoons salt to 3 cups AP flour.  One point: it is worth it to try to find baking powder without aluminum (Rumford, for one) for this type of recipe.  Many people, including me, find that baking powder with aluminum leaves an unpleasant aftertaste and that really comes through in simple baked good such as this.

I just made this bread and it was absolutely marvelous!  I can't believe how quick and easy it is.  It took about 5 minutes to mix and I only used a spoon, not my hands.  Took the advice of others and slightly changed the recipe.  I increased sugar to 1/3 cup and poured 3 Tbls of melted butter on top of batter before baking it.  I used regular Budweiser in bottle. Turned out awesome!  The entire family couldn't stop eating it.  The beer gives it a nice yeast taste.  I will being making this very often.  The crust is chewy and delicious.  Make sure your slices are somewhat thick.  Next time I will add cheddar cheese to the batter and garlic or garlic powder to the melted butter on top.  The possiblities are endless.  This one's a keeper!

We love this bread! I have been making it for a few years now and have tried different beers, and I think the cheap stuff works best! I always use all-purpose flour, just make sure for the 3 cups of flour you add 1 Tablespoon baking powder and 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt to make it like self-rising flour. I also add another tablespoon of sugar. Great easy recipe!

I use this as a back up for "Tastefully Simple Beer Batter Bread"... It is good, but not the same, as other people have written. I did a taste taste with family and neighbors and 4 out of 5 people chose Tastefully Simple over this one. However, this is the next best thing and I use this recipe often when I am out of the other. But, you must change the sugar into 1/3 cup, as others suggest. Thank You for sharing.

There is no more need for the expensive Tastefully Simple mix.  I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup and made this according to the TS instructions.  Just mix until moistened, about 30 strokes, and spread into 9x5 pan.  No need to get your hands in there!  Pour 3 Tbs melted butter over the top and bake at 375 for 45 minutes.  Perfect!  thank you for this

Excellent.  I used 1/3 cup sugar as recommended by others.  Mixed together as directed, THEN turned on the oven to preheat, which gave the flour about 10 minutes to rise a bit.  Right before popping it in the oven, I melted 1/4 cup salted butter and poured it on top of the batter. Baked 60 minutes. The butter gave it a crunchy, slightly salty outter crust, which was divine.  Thanks for the recipe! It's definitely a keeper.

This is a great quick and tasty bread and goes well with all types of meals. Sometimes I like to make it into more of a dessert-like bread by increasing the sugar to 1/2 cup and adding 1 tsp of vanilla and 1 tsp of ground allspice. Make it a little richer by blending together 6 oz of softened cream cheese and 1/4 cup sugar... drop spoonfuls into batter before placing it in the oven. What the heck, mix some toffee chips in the batter while you're at it.

We also love the Tastefully Simple beer bread but wanted to be able to make it from scratch.  I've tried a couple other recipes but we love this one.  I made the changes suggested by others--Instead of 3 cups self-rising flour, I substituted 3 cups flour, 3 tsp baking powder, and 1 1/2 tsp salt.  I also sifted the flour, used 1/3 cup sugar & and handful of Mexican blend shredded cheese.  I brushed melted butter on top halfway through cooking.  It comes out delicious every time.  We love this with just about any kind of homemade soup.  Tonight I'm making it with my Garden Minestrone.

We LOVE making this recipe.

Here are my tips:
I agree with using 1/3 cup sugar.
The beer you choose makes a difference!  I have tried the recipe with dark beers and light ones.
In my opinion the bread with dark beer tastes much better. When I make it with Guinness it comes out brownish, very moist and smelling strongly of beer (this flavor is not for everyone). But when I made it with Heineken and Corona it came out light-colored, not as moist and did not have much of a smell.

I sometimes divide the batter among smaller loaf tins or pans so I can get 4 small loaves out of it. I think it looks nicer as a small loaf and it helps with portion control (because once you cut into the loaf you will eat every last crumb of it!)

Lastly, I bake mine for about 40 min max. My oven is new so that may have something to do with it.

Good luck with the recipe!

for simplicity, this bread simply can't be beat.  Made this last minute, had a can of ginger ale on hand and it was great.  Added 1t bakng pwdr and 1/2 t salt per 1c of bread flour.  Let sit for 30 min in loaf pan before baking.  (NOTE:  this dough will be much wetter/stickier than conventional dough which has been kneaded, but it turns out a beautiful texture:  crunchy crust and soft inside.)  Next time will use 1.5 t bkng pwder instead of 1t, for a little more rise.  Will also try w/ various types of beer over time.  Bread baking doesn't get any simpler than this.  Baked at 350 F for 55 min, inside was baked just right.

This is a great base recipe.  Add some parm. and fresh chopped basil for an Italian meal, OR add some cheddar and chopped green olives as a snack or appetizer.  I do have 2 suggestions: after the bread is baked, brush the top of the loaf with warm water to keep it from getting too crunchy.  Lastly, if you put the loaf in the fridge overnight it is MUCH easier to slice.

I was looking for a cost-effective alternative to Tastefully Simple's wonderful Beer Bread mix.  What a great find!  I altered the recipe a little, too -- used about 1/3 C sugar and added melted butter to the top -- and it's GREAT!  My advice -- use a fuller-bodied beer.  My favorite (to drink AND to cook with) is New Glarus Brewery's delightful Spotted Cow.  Oh, and just like the Tastefully Simple recipe, ANY carbonated beverage works.  I tried it with a generic brand diet cola, and it is a WONDERFUL breakfast bread!!!  GREAT RECIPE!!!

This bread is awesome!  I followed the recipe except I added 1 cup Mexican Blend Shredded Cheese to the flour mixture before adding the beer and then let it raise for about 30 minutes while I was preheating the oven.  I took the advice of another reviewer and brushed the top of the bread (1/2 way through and once again after baking) with melted butter and sprinkled with garlic salt.  Also, I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used 3 cups all-purpose flour minus 2 Tablespoons then added 4 1/2 teaspoons Baking Powder & 1 1/2 teaspoons Salt.  BEST BEER BREAD EVER!  Just a note - the first time I made this, I took another reviewer's suggestion and added 1/3 cup sugar, but I found it was way too sweet for my taste... if you're a fan of sweeter breads like Hawaiian bread, then you'd probably like the 1/3 cup of sugar, but if you're not looking for something quite so sweet, definitely stick with the 3 Tablespoons listed in the recipe.

loved this, added more sugar as suggested by other reviewers.  I didn't want a loaf style bread so I cooked this in a buttered iron skilled (12 in) so it spread out a little...more crust to inside ratio, just like I like it.  I used a strong, malty beer left over from Thansgiving and I think it really added to the flavor of the bread.  I haven't tried different beers yet but I'm sure that it influences the final taste.  Don't be afraid to use a stonger flavored beer that you might not like to drink.

I took the advice of a reviewer and made this in a 9x13 dish.  I melted 1 stick of butter and poured it over the dough before baking, and then topped with a mixture of Parmesan cheese, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning.  Absolutely to die for!  Lots of crunchy buttery flavorful crust with a soft delicious middle.  The only way I will do beer bread from now on!

I used Bud Light because A) I'm cheap and B) it's all I had in the fridge.  I figured it wouldn't turn out because it wasn't a full bodied beer, but I love it.   Hard to believe 3 ingredients can make something this good.  It will be a staple in my house.

Awesome. Forget what all the food snobs have to say about it. Easy. Cheap. IMPOSSIBLE to screw up! I've made 4 loaves in 2 days, and did something wrong on every last one of them and they turned out good or great every time! Just a few tips though, DON'T use cheap beer, gives it a bitter after taste, try letting it sit for a bit before you pan it up and put it in the oven, makes it a bit fluffier. And try using soda, turns out just as great!

The best! I used 1/3 cup of sugar, as recommended by other users, and also added the 3 TBSP of melted butter over the top right before baking! I also brushed more melted butter over the top as soon as it came out of the oven! The result was the best tasting beer bread I have ever had! DELICIOUS! I have already handed out the recipe to friends/neighbors! Thank you!

This bread is the "bomb diggity"! I used to buy a beer bread mix from "Simply Tasteful" food parties. Well, it is like $8.00 for one loaf! So I thought, there has to be a recipe out there on Allrecipes that was similiar and here it is. The only thing I do different is pour 1/4 cp. melted butter on top before baking. It gives it a little more zing! But thank you for this recipe, it saves me money and keeps my hubby happy!

This recipe is absolutely wonderful and easy to make. I substitute soda for the beer (a clear soda like Sierra Mist Natural works great), and add 1/2 cup of sugar for a sweeter taste. You can also substitute one cup of oatmeal for the flour for more fiber and nutrition, and can add any nuts, berries or fruit for additional flavor. I also plan to use whole wheat white flour in the future for the added nutrition. Thanks for this wonderful, quick, and easy recipe!

Fantastic bread....soft and chewy inside and a little crunch on the outside.  Had to make my own self-rising flour and used 1/3 cup of sugar.  Poured melted butter (about 1/2 stick) on top before baking.  The two of us devoured it in 2 days.  It's also great grilled in butter, too.  Definite keeper for me!

Very good! My guests thought it was Tastefully Simple's beer bread. I won't pay $5/mix ever again when this is so easy. As suggested by other commenters suggested, I "made my own" self-rising flour. (Replaced 3 cups of self-rising flour with 3 cups regular flour PLUS 3 tsp baking powder PLUS 1-1/2 tsp salt.)

I've tried this 3 times. Never could get the dough to rise so I did some investigation and discovered that the yeast in the beer is "killed" during the bottling/brewing process. So here's the easy solution. Mix a packet of active dry yeast in with the self rising flour and sugar. Warm the beer (I opened the bottle and ran VERY hot water over the side of of the bottle and raised the temp to appox. 120F) and stirred it in the flour, sugar, yeast mixture. Let stand for 10 minutes covered with a tea towel...Then I punched it down, formed into a loaf on a floured surface and put it in a foiled line loaf pan sprayed with olive oil flavored cooking spray. Let rise until doubled in size and baked as directed in the recipe. Very good w/ Spaghetti and meat sauce.

Make it exactly as written and it will turn out great.
Buy "Self Rising" flour at the store, mix 3 cups Self Rising flour + 3 Tablespoons granulated white sugar together in a large bowl slowly pour 12 ounces of any old beer in while stirring, mix well with a large spoon until all dry ingredients are mixed in then pour the sticky batter into a regular greased bread loaf pan - spread evenly and bake for 55-60 minutes until light brown. let cool 5 min. and turn out of pan onto a cooling rack. Let cool, place on a cutting board and slice with a serrated bread knife. This is a NO FAIL recipe if you follow it correctly. Soft middle slightly sweet with a crunchy crust and delicious with soups.

I own my own cafe and needed a bread recipe that was fast & easy but good.  Two out of three wasn't bad, this bread is fast & easy but NOT GOOD its O MY GOSH GREAT.  I have made it plain, with italian herbs over top and with cheddar cheese on top each way is wonderful. Most of my customers have never had beer bread and they loved it, it is now a permanent part of my menu. Thank You so very much!!!!

I made this with my Linguine with tomatoes and shimp recipe and it was very good.  I added about 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar and  had to make my own self-rising flour.  Baked for about 55 minutes and was crunchy on the outside, tender like a biscuit on the inside.  Slight beer flavor came through, just enough.  Thanks for this super simple recipe to throw together quickly.

So quick, so EZ! I poured the prepared batter into a round cake pan and let settle for 20 minutes before baking.  Took 25 minutes to have a delicious bread.  I used Fat Tire amber ale this time around, but may experiment with IPA's.  Thanks for the fun recipe!

Watch out Tastefully Simple, this recipe will have your mix off the market.  I'm in the camp that says put melted butter on top before baking.  It turns a pretty golden color and tastes great.

Wow!  Delicious and so easy!!  I definitely agree with those who say that this beats Tastefully Simple's mix.  Didn't have any self rising flour so I substituted 3 cups flour, 3 tsp. baking powder and 1.5 tsp. salt (as suggested in another recipe found online).  I'd love to make a bunch of mixes and give them as gifts!

I absolutely love this recipe!  I had bought the Tastefully Simple Beer Bread at $4.00.
I fell in love with it and thought, this shouldn't be heard to make.  Then found the 
recipe here. Definitely alot cheaper to make myself.  In one week I have made about 8 batches!  
Everyone at home and my full time and part time jobs love it, and are begging me for the recipe!
As far as beer is concerned, I highly recommend using a regular beer and not a light beer.
I used Budweiser in the bottle and it tasted awesome!  I can't even keep this stuff
in my house it's so good!

This is super easy and really delicious. Instead of self-rising flour, I used all purpose flour and added 3 tsp baking soda and 1.5 teaspoon salt. Turned out great. I've tried it with a couple different beers. So far, I like PBR the best.

I liked this recipe. My husband loved it. I made it as written and decided we like it better with a few changes (increased sugar to 1/3 cup, added handful of sharp cheddar, used a bigger pan and let rise for 45-60 minutes before baking, basted with butter and garlic salt 1/2 way thru baking and at the end (from other reviewers)) definatly a 5 star recipe. I rated 5 star even though I had to make changes to the original recipe because of the ease and quickness of making the bread.

My family loves beer bread and this is a very easy recipe. I added the 1/3 cup sugar as another suggested and it tastes great.  I still would like to try the (1 cup flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt) instead of using the self-raising flour.    My family has recently become addicted to Tastefully Simple's Beer Bread. At $5 a loaf, it's getting pricy so I tried this and WOW! My family loved it and my son said he like it BETTER! I did add 1/3 cup sugar as another suggested and it was great. I also made the self rising flour that someone posted (1 cup flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt). Thanks for saving me some $$$

I did some different things to this recipe to flavor it up.  Savory - I added 1tsp of each Garlic powder, Onion powder, Red Pepper Flakes and a blend of Italian Spices. (I might add some cheese to the top of one when its finished)  Sweet - I added 4 more Tbsp of Sugar, 1/2 tbsp Cinnamon, 1tsp nutmeg and ginger

Move over Tastefully simple!!! I normally buy the beer bread from T.S. cuz people have said the homemdae wasn't as good. They were either wrong or had a bad recipe. This was great!! I did top mine w/ 3 Tbls of melted butter before baking. I will never buy the boxed again.

I found this recipe to be excellent as well as being exceptionally easy to prepare!  I, like a few other people who have rated this recipe, find that it tastes exactly like the "tastefully simple" beer bread mix and is just about as easy to prepare (can't let my neighbor know though as she is a tastefully simple rep.)  Also, I have made the whole wheat beer bread which is also on this site and I didn't like that one at all...it got too firm and stale-like before the day was through.

This bread was not good for me.....I loved it so much that I eat an entire loaf!!  I made 2 mini loafs, baked for 50 minutes and it was perfect.  My diet can't take much of this awesome bread!  Thanks for the Recipe.

I made up up several mixes of this bread and gave them as gifts with cooking instructions and a can of beer. I weighed the flour on my food scale to make it go faster. According the flour nutrition label, 372 grams of flour is equal to 3 cups of flour. HOWEVER when I measured 3 cups of flour with a measuring cup and then weighed those 3 cups I found it to weigh almost 100 grams more. I attribute that to the flour getting packed in the measuring cup as I scoop it out of the bag. This discovery poses the question... is this recipe intended to use sifted flour (or weighed flour) or flour that was simply scooped out of the bag? I chose to use about 390 grams of flour per loaf mix and 1/3 cup sugar. I placed the mix in a quart size baggie then inside a lunch size paper bag. I attached a sticker label I created with the baking instructions and an expiration date based on the expiration date of the self-rising flour. I also included in the baking instructions to top bread with 3 tablespoons melted butter before baking. I made a sample loaf for me to try before I handed out my gifts and it was fabulous! This is a super cheap and easy recipe and makes great gifts!!!

My husband made this last night and I give it 5 stars. It was pretty good.  Not as good as what I have had in the restaurant, but a good basic recipe.  I think if you get creative and add some of the ingredients that others have suggested, it would be a good 5 star with cheese, jalapenos, or serrano peppers.  I'm not too much for garlic and the such, but it would probably be really good with that with butter on top for garlic lovers.

As others have stated, they've been making this for years as have I. My only change was to brush the top with butter 10 minutes before the baking process is complete. I do like the other suggestions on letting it stand 30 minutes before baking to lighten it a bit and how to make your own self-rising flour if it does not reside in your pantry (As an aside:  I use 1 1/4 tsp baking powder and 1/4 tsp salt per cup of all purpose flour used). Thank you Jodi for posting this recipe!

WOW!! I would give this recipe 6 stars if I could, because it was so easy and only had a few ingredients. We used a strong wheat beer and the taste was amazing. I didn't have any self-rising flour either, so I took another reviewer's suggestion and added 1 Tbsp of baking powder and 1 tsp of salt. It rose just fine in the oven.

5 stars for the recipe, taste is 4 stars for me but that's just because I don't like beer. I had a bottle of Corona in the fridge that I needed to do something with is why I tried this recipe. The Corona was only 7 oz so I added 5 oz of Sierra Mist. I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup as suggested by other reviewers. I used 2 cups SR flour and 1 cup WW flour with 1 1/2 t baking powder and 1 t salt. I also added 1 t onion powder. I let it rise while the oven was heating and used a basic glass loaf pan with 1/2 stick butter poured over the dough. My very picky 3 year old grandson liked it so I will probably make it again.

This bread was ok. I was pretty excited after reading the reviews but I was disappointed. It was dry and crumbly, I had issues cutting slices of it because it kept falling apart. If I make this again, I am going do what some other reviewers suggested and add cheese, that may help with the moisture and keeping it together.

I love this recipe!! It is so simple and tastes great. I used all purpose flour with 1 TBL of baking powder and 1 TSP of salt. The only beer I had in the house was Miller Lite. I used 3 TBL of splenda/sugar mix. Turned out perfect. The flavor is stronger the next day after baking. I heat up a peice in the microwave for 15 seconds and top with butter. Delicious.

If you add the extra 1/3 cup of sugar that many reviewers recommend, this is exactly like the copycat tastefully simple beer bread recipe! That recipe also says to make sure not to overstir the batter so that it stays light and moist without becoming dense during baking and to add 2 T. of melted butter to the top of the bread during the last ten minutes of baking. It doesn't get any easier than this :o)

Followed other reviews to "make" the self-rising flour and drizzled with 3 tbsp butter before baking. So close to TS brand, I will never have to buy it again! Thanks for the recipe Jodi!!!

I don't like sugar in things like this.  Try some garlic powder IN the batter.  Wonderful!  I sometimes put shredded cheddar cheese and garlic.

I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup per other reviewers suggestions and used 1 bottle of lite beer.  I let it sit for 30 minutes befor putting it in the oven.  I brushed the top with about 1 - 2 tbsp. butter halfway through the baking time.Turned out delicous!  Crunchy and buttery on the outside, nice and soft on the inside.  Next tiime I will try mixing some cheese and maybe garlic into the batter.  Best eaten warm out of the oven. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is definitely a keeper!  I use Mountain Dew because never have beer in the house (we don't drink).  I also add three tablespoons of melted butter on top before putting it in the oven.  I also used the suggested 1/3 cup sugar!

I took others suggestions and made the sugar 1/2 cup.  Used lite beer.  It came out delicious!  A great substitute to the expensive catalog packages!  I cut into square bite size pieces and served with dip.  Wonderful!

What a fabulous and easy bread!!  I made this with 1/3 c sugar, and brushed the top with butter before cooking.  If you need to make your own self-rising= 1 c flour, 1 T baking powder, and 1/4 tsp salt.  (I used another reviewers suggestion of 1 tsp salt and it ruined my 2nd batch of bread.)  I also tried using soda as another suggested, and i thought this was quite gross: Stick to beer.  We used light beer and it was amazing!!

Super easy and pretty tasty.  And really great because I had some self-rising flour on hand that needed to get used up.  I used lager, which is fermented differently than ale and I think has a "breadier" flavor that just goes better in bread than ale.  I want to try this bread again with cheese.

Excellent recipe...Great with all kinds of beer, especially Stella Artois. I also added 1/3 c. brown sugar, replaced half the flour with oats and divided into two loaf pans. Its great warm spread with cream cheese.

I made this to take along with a dinner to new parents.  I needed something quick and easy and with ingredients we had on hand.  The new father thought he had died and went to Heaven when I told him what it was, and he insisted I have a slice.  Quite good!  Only 4 stars because it was a bit heavy.

This was awesome!  Because I didn't have self rising flour, I also followed previous suggestions and added 1 Tbsp. baking powder and 1 tsp. salt.  I also added 1/3 cup sugar and melted butter on top before baking.  Lastly, I let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes before putting in the oven.  It came out like bread from a fine restaurant and my family loved it.  My boys helped me prepare it.  Yummy!

I made this with Splenda for a Superbowl party.  It was a hit, got a request for the recipe and the guests were fighting over who got to take the leftovers home.  I only would have given it 4 stars without sugar, though.  Since I had given it all away, I made a second loaf (with sugar this time) and it was MUCH better.  5 stars for sure.  I have found that it helps to allow the bread to raise for 5 -10 mins and pouring some melted butter over top before baking, as suggested by some other reviewers.  Can't wait to try it with cheese!
Update: Gave the recipe to my boyfriend and he added an extra 1/2 can of beer because the batter looked too thick...the texture was great this way (with the cooking time increased a bit) but although the guys liked the stronger beer flavor, it was a little too strong for me. Tried adding some melted butter to the batter next time to thin it out a bit and it was great.  Will try with milk or water added next time instead of butter to cut the fat.

Have been making this bread for years. I prefer it made with a good wheat beer (weizen-bier). It is best warm (rub with butter when hot-out-of-the-oven). Cut in thick slices with a serrated knife. Once it cools, cut thinly and toast for marvelous flavor. The only problem with this bread is it tends to dry out quickly. It's easy to make from memory:3 ingredients, 3 tablespoons of sugar, oven at THREE-fifty...one of everything else (including 1 hr cooking time.) You can vary this receipe by adding some cheese, diced onion, etc.

This recipe is wonderful!  I love homemade bread, but am not found of using yeast.  This bread not only has a delicous flavor that the whole family loved, but was super simple to make.  I did not have any self-rising flour on hand, so I used 3c. all-purpose flour, 3t. baking powder, and 1 1/2 t. salt.  I also poured 3Tbsp. melted butter on top before baking.  Awesome! Thank you for this recipe!!!

Easy peasy!! I had some left over beer and my husband suggested beer bread. He found this recipe. I subbed 1 cup flour, 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, and 1/8 teaspoon salt (times 3). I wish I had read reviews to add more sugar, as I do think that would have elevated this good recipe to great!

My wife used to make the Tastefully Simple beer bread for years and everyone always liked it.  She wanted a less expensive, easy version so we tried this one.  She increased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  She replaced the self rising flour with 3 cups all purpose flour, 3 tsp baking powder, and 1 1/2 tsp salt.  This is a great and very simple recipe.

I’ve been using a similar beer bread recipe for a number of years.  My recipe calls for 4 T. of sugar and bakes at 375 degrees.  I’ve always used a lite beer, but this time I used Yeungling Lager beer and only used the 3 T. of sugar.  Well, I now know that the kind of  beer you use definitely makes a difference.  The beer flavor was much more pronounced using the stronger flavored lager beer.  I think I prefer it with lite beer.  I followed the recipe and baked this at 350 for about one hour and it didn’t brown as well as baking at the slightly higher temp.  I know I’ll be making this again but definitely with lite beer and a 375 degree oven.  I’m still undecided about the sugar, 3 T. or 4???

The best basic beer bread recipe there is... and simple too! It tastes exactly like the TS bread if you add about 3 T. melted butter to the top before cooking. I have also added some Italian seasonings to the butter. Wonderful. The possibilities for this basic recipe are endless.
This recipe has been added to our "family favorites," and will be handed down.

I did not have self rising flour so I used 3 tsp of baking powder and 1-1/2 tsp of salt. I used Michelob Ultra and followed other reviewers' advice to use 1/3 cup sugar. I really liked the ease of this recipe and the texture and taste, but I think I will decrease the sugar next time and use a really good beer.

If you want fresh hot bread at a meal.  It sure is quick  and easy to make.  I did use the 1/3 cup of sugar.   To me the crust was the best.  I love a crusty bread.

This recipe is delicious!  Looking at some of the other reviews, I didn't have self rising flour, so I used 3 tsp baking soda and 1 tsp sea salt.  I also added 1/2 cup of sugar and drizzled olive oil over the top before I baked it.  So much cheaper than TS!  (And probably less preservatives!)

I tried this with some blueberry beer that I bought on accident (that will teach me to pay attention to labels), but it actually makes it taste of blueberries.  And it was very good.  I am thinking of making another batch with blueberries in it.

Great bread. I was looking for a bread that didn't need yeast or a breadmaker and this was it! Very simple. I made my own self-rising flour like others suggested (1 tsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. salt per 1 cup flour) and also used 1/3 cup sugar as others also suggested. I used Yuengling beer, let the dough sit for 1/2 hour before baking, then covered dough with butter and garlic salt halfway through baking.    I served this with beef stew also from this site for which I used the same beer and it was perfect!

Terrific recipe - I used the variation of letting it rise for 30 minutes then pouring melted butter over the top before baking.  The results were a lighter, fluffier bread.

I cannot believe I did not try this recipe sooner!  I used Miller Highlife for the beer, added the 1/3 cup of sugar, homemade self-rising flour (as suggsted), and poured the melted 3 TBS on top before baking.  This smells and tastes just as good if not better than the Tastefully Simple mix.  This one is definately a keeper!

delicious! smells great while baking, yummy!  I didn't have self-rising on hand, so I did 3 cups of flour, 4 1/2 tsp. baking powder, and 1 1/2 tsp. salt. I added 1/2 c. sugar to it and Bud Select.

Pretty Good & super easy!! Had to add about 1/3 cup sugar & to make it authentic ( like Tastefully Simple) you need to add 3 Tlbs. of melted butter to top of batter before baking. Will defiantly make again with mentioned adjustments. Huge $$$ saver! Thanks!

This tastes JUST like the Tastefully Simple Beer Bread.  I made it with the substitutions self-rising flour suggested here.  SO delicious.

This bread worked out really nicely.  I read through some reviews to get some tips on improving it a bit and it was great.  I used 1/3 a cup of sugar like some people suggested.  I used a 16oz can of Steel Reserve that my boyfriend picked out (apparently it's a "bad" beer).  He took care of the 4 unnecessary ozs and I used the rest for the bread.  One thing I was unsure about was mixing.  The recipe doesn't specify if this is safe to mix a lot.  I just assumed it wasn't and mixed it maybe 12 times total.  In any case it turned out great and we ate it paired with pea soup and fried potatoes with smoked sausage.  I'm looking forward to try a sweet version with vanilla, cranberries, and orange zest in the future.  Thanks!

This recipe is very, very good. I took the advice of the other reviewers and added 1/3 cup of sugar and melted butter on the top...great ideas! Also, like one reviewer said, if you let it "rise" for about 1/2 hour before baking it, the bread really does turn out exceptional!

Simple, effective, and customizable.  That's what I love about this recipe.  I once tried Sam Adams Cranberry Lambic.  The beer itself isn't so great to drink, but I made a double-batch of the stuff once, brought it to work, and it was gone in seconds, with everyone asking for the recipe.  That particular variety of beer is usually only available in the Winter variety pack, but other fruity flavored beers work well.  I like to pull it out maybe a tad bit early, instaed of waiting for it to completely dry, as it's nice and chewy - it seems to stay springy and fresh-tasting for longer this way, as well.
  The recipe is so fast and convenient, and as I often experiment with variety or microbrew beers anyway, every batch can taste different!  A cheap way to customize a simple recipe.

I made this with regular flour and added the baking powder and salt, as others have suggested. I used 1/3 cup Splenda instead of sugar, and also added 1 tsp. Italian seasoning and 2 Tbs. grated parmesan cheese to the batter.  I was in a hurry and didn't have an hour for it to bake, so I spooned the batter into a muffin pan and made 11 good-sized muffins, baking them for about 17 minutes.  They were very good, even as leftovers over the next few days!

Wonderful!  Added a cup of shredded cheddar to the dry ingredients, and poured 2 tbsp. melted butter over the dough before baking.  Crunchy outside, soft inside...delicious.

I admit I was a bit skeptical about this recipe.  However, it's great!  I added a little baking powder, a tad bit of splenda (and the called for amount of sugar), and about a tablespoon of Italian seasoning.  I topped it with a sesame seed, Parmesan, garlic salt mixture.  Very good!  I will make again since it's so easy!

This bread was very simple to make. It looked and smelled great when it was done. However, when it was time to eat it, it has a very blan taste. It almost tastes like you're eating nothing.

I LOVE this bread!  My friend is a TS consultant and I was a regular purchaser of their beer bread mix.  Well, she hasn't asked why I haven't been buying it anymore and I don't plan to volunteer the info that I've found a CHEAPER (and in my opinion better) version.  I did follow other reviewers and increase sugar to 1/3 cup and add 1 Tblsp baking powder and 1 teasp salt to flour mix.  Awesome!!!

This is similar to the recipe I've been using for years, with one exception. After the dough is in the bread pan, melt one stick of butter (or margarine) and pour it all over the dough then bake. It makes an amazing buttery bottom crust.

This is a SUPER easy mix that tastes EXACTLY like Tastefully Simples beer bread at a fraction of the cost!  I used Miller Light and we really liked the flavor it gave the bread. ENJOY!

I didn't have self-rising, so used 1 T baking powder, 1 tsp salt. Don't forget the 1/3 cup sugar! Also added 3 T melted butter over the top before putting it in the oven. Next time I'm going to try to add some cheese. Great recipe, thanks!

Great recipe.  I can't believe how much it tasted liked the more expensive boxed version! I didn't have self rising flour, so I did as others suggested & added 1 tsp. salt & 1 Tbsp. baking powder & it worked great.  I also added 1/3 cup of sugar instead of what the recipe called for & drizzled 3 Tbsp. butter on top before baking. I used Becks dark beer.  Everyone loved it!

I can't believe how good the bread turned out and especially how easy it was to make! I followed many of the other suggestions: made my own self rising flour using regular flour and adding 1.5 teaspoons salt and 1 tablespoon baking powder. Also topped the dough with 3 tablespoons melted butter before putting it in the oven. Really had no idea what beer to use, so I tried Miller Genuine Draft in the bottle and it was excellent!

This is good bread.  I made changes though--I didn't have self-rising flour so I followed another review and added the baking powder to all purpose flour.  Also, I don't drink beer so I added a can of Dr. Pepper instead.  Also added some white chocolate chips and melted 2 T. butter over the top of the uncooked batter.  Tasted yummy!
*UPDATED*  the bread didn't taste so great after the first day.

This was great!  I used Miller Lite and it turned out very moist.  I cut it into small, bite sized chunks and served it with the creamy garlic dip recipe that I found on this site.  It was the only thing that was food that was totally gone by the end of my party!

I prefer this bread toasted.  It has a very dense, moist inside with a nice crunchy crust. Don't expect it to be like a yeast bread.

I made this bread with a nut brown micro beer and it was great!  I agree that what type of beer you use makes a huge difference.  With the non-filtering of a micro-brew it makes the bread much more dense.  But when I used Miller High Life it was much more fluffy.  Both ways are great, it depends on what it is going with.

I give this three stars. While it is amazing that such a simple recipe can yield a fairly acceptable bread, I do not think this is worthy of being compared to a fine yeast bread. The texture was great warm out of the oven: it was deliciously crisp on the outside and moist on the inside even without butter. Afterwards, we brushed butter on the warm loaf to soften it a little bit. The next day it was dry and had lost its original flavor. Would I bake it again? Yes, on the fly. But for company or for a holiday? No way.

I absolutely loved this bread...easy and delicious.  I used raspberry beer, and to add sweetness, I put some raspberry cooking jelly in the center of the loaf.

I have bought and made the Tastefully Simple beer bread for years but it is very expensive. I made my last TS beer bread last week and thought I would search here to see if there was a recipe for beer bread and found and saved this recipe. I made the bread this week while weather held me captive. I forgot the sugar until the dough was in the pan so I baked it without the sugar. It didn't taste exactly like the TS version but I gave it five stars because it was good without the sugar. I couldn't believe how easy and simple it is to make. I used a wooden spoon only to mix and spread the dough. I'm sure it will be even better next time. Thanks for the recipe, Jodi!

This was SUPER easy and very good.  My whole family loved it.  I made it with Leienkugles Orange Shandy.  I would like to try it with Honey Weiss.  Would be awesome paired with some Beer Cheese soup!  I followed the directions as they were are baked for 35 minutes.  Top was crusty and the sides were soft.  The only tricky part was slicing it as the top tending to break apart when cutting it.

I took all the recommendations to heart and added 3 tsp of gluten powder to the flour and sugar and 2 tsp of lecithin to the beer before putting them all together. The gluten to combat the crumbling effect and the lecithin so it will keep til tomorrow. I bake a few loaves of bread several times per month so I keep these supplies on hand.  They really worked great in this recipe. If you don't bake regularly but you want to try these, they will keep on your shelf. Wrap the gluten tightly in plastic; remove the label from the box & stick it into the bag. Lecithin is a natural ingredient that has the viscosity of molasses so I heat the jar in a bowl of hot water then pour what I need into a spoon. One jar will keep for many ages so don't worry about a shelf life on it. 
This is a recipe I will keep for when I want a quick bread and don't want to bake more than 1 loaf!

I have also used this recipe for years now as it is a South African favourite.  You can literally add anything to the mix; cheese, various herbs, sweetcorn, bacon bits, paprika, feta cheese, onions or even pie apples with spring onion.
Be adventurous and try different flavours everytime you bake it!

This is my favorite go-to recipe for a quick bread, so simple I've even got it memorized and am asked for the recipe often. We even take it on vacation - I just mix the dry ingredients (using the tips for making homemade self-rising flour) in a gallon ziplock baggie, mark the temp & time to cook on the bag, then mix a bottle of beer right in the baggie, squeeze into a pan and bake. I've even made it without a loaf pan - the dough is thick enough you can make a mounded "artisanal" loaf right on a greased cookie sheet. If I have butter I put it on top - but just put a couple of pats right on top. Why dirty an extra dish to melt it when you're putting it in a hot oven? Thanks so much for the simple, wonderful recipe.

great easy recipe. My family enjoys eating it right out of the oven with some butter. If there is any left over (which is rare) we toast it with butter for breakfast.

I've made this recipe many times. I've found it to be a great foundation for lots of variations. I don't usually keep self rising flour around so I mix my own. 
I add 1 cup of whole oats that have been soaked in 1/2 cup of buttermilk. I also add 1 more Tbsp of sugar. 
I made a loaf today with Mike's Raspberry Lemonade instead of beer. It made a very pretty, slightly pinkish loaf.

This was really good. I brought it to a party, using the recipe with 1/3 cup of sugar instrad of 3 tablespoons. No one could tell that it was not tastefully simple beer bread!!

This is the only bread I've ever made! It's so easy, and I don't have to work with yeast! I absolutely love it!  My only problem, is I eat it too quickly to take a nice picture! hahaha  It is very addictive, and so yummy! I put a littlle butter on top before it cooks, and it gets nice and crispy! A + for this recipe! I am guarenteed to make this the rest of my life! Thank you!

I was raised on Beer Bread....the simple way - Remember the number "3" -   it takes 3 cups of flour (self rising, or make your own self rising by reading others reviews) - 1/"3" cup sugar - and one beer (your choice).  I do like the idea of playing around with imports and ciders however I was always taught to take the beer out of the fridge early and let it go a little flat (a few hours) -  Then bake at "3"50 for an hour.  First "3"0 minutes let the course run.... the next "3" minutes baste with butter (real butter) on the top of the bread every 10 minutes.....full cooking time -1 hour  -  It is best served fresh out of the oven, however I have made croutons with my left overs and the family raves about those on salads.....Just another thought!!!!  Enjoy!

perfect basic recipe-the only change i feel is crucial is to top it with butter before baking. otherwise this recipe is not only great on it's own, it's perfect to customize. i like to add cheddar cheese, garlic salt, and green chilis.

I got a box of Tastefully Simple's beer bread mix for Christmas and instantly fell in love with it, but was horrified to find out I'd have to go through a bunch of hooplah just to get another (expensive) box. Well thankfully this recipe was easy to find! It tastes exactly the same and never imagined making good bread would be so easy. I have a spoiled husband who lives off of my bread-machine bread, and that's easy enough, but 3 ingredients? C'mon! My dog can make this blindfolded. I used a can of coke instead of beer, drizzled a couple tablespoons of butter over the top before baking, and baked at 375 for 50 minutes to get that superb, crunchy crust and soft middle. I also drizzle with a little more melted butter after cooking. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This was my first time baking beer bread and it turned out perfectly! I made self-rising flour based on another reviewer's suggestion (1 c flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt) and substituted brown sugar for white sugar. I mixed the dough first with a spoon and then with my hands, and let it sit in the baking pan for a half hour before baking it. I also ran a stick of butter after baking it for 50 minutes and let it bake for an additional 10 minutes. Perfection!

way too bland as written, no one even finished their 1st slice... and my family love bread!  Made a 2nd time with 1/3 cup sugar and added onion, garlic and italian seasoning and was much better. I will keep looking for a better recipe.

Loved the texture of this bread, and it was so easy to make.  I used Blue Moon Pumpkin Ale (seasonal brew) and I did notice a bit of an aftertaste from the beer.  My husband and I enjoyed it, but my kids, who usually devour any type of bread did not go back for seconds.  Next time I may try a lighter beer or a soft drink, I think I will definitely be experimenting with this recipe.  I served it with Terrific Turkey Chili from this site and it was fabulous.  Can't wait to make it for dipping bread for our next party.  UPDATE:  I made this again using regular Coors and 1/3 cup sugar.....fabulous, kids loved it too.  Will be making it will this combination from now on!!

Wow.  This bread is fantastic.  I had never even tasted beer bread before, but this was so easy and delicious.  I did follow advice of reviewers and put 1/3 cup sugar instead of the stated amount, let the dough sit in the loaf pan for at least half an hour, and I drizzled 3 Tablespoons of melted butter on top of the dough directly before cooking: the top crust was amazing, the middle was soft, perfect texture.  I served it with butter and honey alongside a beef dish.  One of my favorite recipes on this site so far.  Other reviewers recommended dividing the dough into 2 loaf pans - maybe I'll try that later, but the original recipe loaf pan worked great for me. 

PLEASE TRY EATING THIS WITH TRADER JOE'S COOKIE BUTTER ON TOP! It's like it was made for this bread :)

Pretty awesome! Extremely easy and quick. I used blue moon honey wheat ale. It's was great. I also increased the sugar as other people suggested to 1/3 cup, and I actually used Splenda. (no one could tell) I served it w/ honey butter I made. Everyone loves it! Definitely will make again!

This bread is wonderful.  I left out the sugar, added cheese to the bread and put taco meat in the middle.  Wow! Nothing but rave reviews.  I also had to use the 3 cups of all purpose flour with 1 Tbsp baking powder and 1 tsp salt since I didn't have self rising flour.

As other reviewers had suggested - I added a bit more sugar and put a couple of tablespoons of butter on top during the last few minutes of cooking.  I can't even imagine how bad it would have been without these touches.   My family are huge carb eaters - more than 1/2 of the loaf thrown away....

I love this recipe! It is so fast and easy to make. I brush it with butter when it comes out of the oven and sprinkle just a little bit of garlic power on the top. I also use the self raising flower sub (1 cup reg flower + 1t backing powder and 1/2 t salt)
The crunchy/chewy outside is the best!!!

awesome and dense bread. 3 tablespoons of sugar made it a touch too sweet for me, so i used 3 teaspoons the second time and it worked great.

I have bought Tastefully Simple's Bountiful Beer Bread for years and I did try this recipe but didn't think it tasted close to TS's beer bread.  I am trying to find another recipe that comes close and can't seem to find one.

I use this all the time and my guests LOVE it no matter what beer I use. For an extra kick, I throw in cheese and Italian seasoning. Most kinds of cheese will do--parmesan, cheddar, etc.

I think next time I will add the extra sugar.  Its quite good, but a bit plain.  I bet the sugar will help.  Looking forward to playing with the recipe for new fun breads.

Seriously. Good. Bread. I added the baking pwdr and salt since I only had all purpose flour. I can't wait to make this again. I think I'll add some cheese and jalapenos to the next loaf for fun. Yum.

SO easy and SO good! Made 'self rising flour' by adding baking powder and salt as other reviewers suggested. I also took more advice by adding a T of honey to the dry ingredients to add sweetness. My boyfriend was so impressed that I made homemade bread-- and that it was so good! Served with stew. YUM! This is an easy recipe to pull out when you need a quick and easy carb to round out the meal.

I just made this bread to go along with gumbo...so delicious.   I had everything handy (used other users suggestion re: making your own self-rising flour) and added a little more sugar.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Amazingly quick and easy recipe. I added about 3/4 cup of shredded bacon and 2 tablespoons of chopped chives to create a delicious variation of this recipe, and one less tablespoon of sugar :)

This is my go to recipe now. It tastes just like the tastefully simple beer bread. The only change I made was 1 tsp of salt.

A good standard recipe for beer bread. I definitely recommend using a wheat beer and one with citrus in it is great- such as Blue Moon or Shock Top. They don't have any of the bitter hopiness that other beers have and still produce a bread with a lot of flavor.

Secoond time making this, first time did not like the flavor so added 1/3 cup white sugar, as suggested and this made all the difference. Used bottle of Blue Moon.  Served with spicy chili, hit the spot.

This is delicious! My whole family loved it. I made my own self rising flour per some of the reviews. I will definitely make this again. Thanks

This recipe resulted in all of us just waiting to cut into it - only to be so so so dissapointed.  It's worth paying for the real deal and realize everyones tastebuds are different, but when all of us agree this is horrid - can we all be wrong?  I don't think I'd ever make this again!

I use brown sugar and add in Monterey/Colby shredded cheese and Italian seasonings. When it comes out of the oven, I pour melted butter with garlic on it. Everyone loves it! I love the ease of this recipe. I make it for just about any occasion, and my Sunday School class likes it for breakfast!

This recipe is awesome for a poor college student like myself! Three cheap ingredients combined to make some AMAZING beer bread. I used a can of Natrual Light someone had left in the fridge unattended. :) Let me just say...I never thought Natural Light could taste so good! Next time I plan to add some shredded cheese and chives. Yum!

increased sugar as suggested to 1/3 cup. Used regular flour, but 50%ww and 50% white. Added 1tbsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt, and 2tsp ground flax.  Poured 3tbsp melted butter over when in pan before baking.  So easy and tasty.

Great recipe! I do ALOT of baking and this is my go -to recipe for beer bread . The beer makes the bread! I have tried it with 14 types of beer to give it a good study and we really have found that this recipe can fail with the wrong beer we like PBR but my mom insist its much better with a regular bud light and dad thinks a nice dark beer is the best so try the recipe with a few beers to find the one that suits your taste! I also like to add jalapeno and jack cheese to make it savory!

I was looking for something similar to the packaged beer breads that I buy.  This comes very close.  It didn't quite have the same depth of flavor, but perhaps I need to experiment with other types of beer.  I will use this recipe instead of spending the extra cash on the packaged ones from now on....that's how close it is.  I did follow other reviewers' suggestions and increased the sugar to about 1/3 cup.  I found it the perfect sweetness.  Quick to whip up, too.  Thanks for the recipe.

Baked this recipie based on its good reviews, but WOW was it a disappointment! It was the consistiency of a muffin, and basically tasted like crumbly play-dough with a bitter aftertaste. I used Sam Adams- didnt work out at all. I also used home made self rise flour; which was probably my first mistake. Cant stand when people change all the ingredients and then blame the recipie (which does seem like I am doing).  I might try it again EXACTLY as written, but really dont think it could be much better; also may try using a Budweiser as suggested, not too sure if I will risk it again. I must add it looked absolutely gorgeous, and smelled fantastic~ made the bad taste extra painful....

This simple recipe is GREAT and CHEAP! I found a Beer Bread mix in a cute brown glass bottle at a well known retail store for $9.00, plus you still had to add your own beer. Which is too high price for me, especially with a baby on the way! That is what made me search for a beer bread recipe, and this one more than meets my expectations! The only changes I made were with the help of other reviews. I used all-purpose flour 3 cups, 3 tsp baking powder, and 1 1/2 tsp salt. I also used 1/3 cup of white sugar. This recipe is absolutely delicious!!!!

I made this for the first time tonight and... WOW.  I used Shiner Bock and cooked it in my dutch oven (since I mysteriously don't own a bread pan).  I cooked it covered for 45 minutes and then let it cook uncovered for the last 15.

Doubled the recipe using Pyramid's apricot ale and baked in six mini loaf pans; also upped the sugar to 1/4 cup - well 1/2 cup since i doubled.  So moist and delicious!

Super easy!  I've made the several times, and prefer 4 TBSP of sugar instead of 3.  If you add cheese, be sure to do it in the dry stage.  I've used several different brands of beer, and me & my boyfriend think that Coors Light makes the best tasting beer bread.

Quick and easy.  I always add more sugar in place of the flour and as the top is too hard for my liking, I spread a little sugar and butter on top before baking.

We love this bread!  The recipe is very easy and I used an 8-1/2x4-1/2x2-1/2 pan size, which the end result was a "domed" loaf of bread.  Which was just fine.  I also put cheddar cheese on the top and it was delicious!  Thanks!!

Love it!  I used Labbatt Blue Light and it tasted great!  Next time I am going to experiment with a Hard Cidar, I think.  I hope that works!  (Remember to use FRESH baking powder, if it's old it's stale and it won't work as well to leaven the bread.  I added an extra 1/2 teaspoon to counteract that and I think it worked!)  So easy! My husband loves is with Chili, to clean the pasta sauce off his bowl, or topped with fried cauliflower!   I like sneaking a slice all by itself.

Easy and yummy! I'd never had or even heard of Beer Bread before, so it was an experiment for me. I had left-over (icky) beer from a party to use up. Even with beer that I would never drink straight, this bread turned out fabulous. Next time I will let it rise so that it will be a little lighter.

wow! this bread is wonderful. its quick easy and very impressive! i used all purpose flour, and added 1 tablespoon of baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp salt. i also increased the sugar to 1/3 c, added a handful of mexican shredded cheese, and poured 2 tbs melted butter on top before baking. when it came out i poured another 2 tbs melted butter. all this based on other reviews of course. amazing bread!!! i might try it with soda too just to see what that tastes like. impossible to mess up i think. thanks for a great recipe!!!

This is a very good beer bread..crisp on outside, soft on inside.  I did make the following changes....
1. Increased sugar to almost 1/3 cup
2. Let sit after putting in baking dish
3. Before baking, pour over 3 tbsp   butter.
4. Works best if baked in glass bread pan.

I just wanted to tell everyone that this is the best Beer Bread ever! I used the flour variation, 3 Tbs. of sugar, and a few Tbs. of melted butter over the top. Better than Tastfully Simple!!

P.S. I used Light Heinekin, I would like to try an apple spiced beer for the holidays.

Fantastic beer bread! I just finished making it, it was unbelievably easy and is so delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as is for the first time and it is wonderful as written, however I am excited to keep making this with different variations. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good, but a only the price was better than the Tastefully Simple mix.  I made it using 1/2 Coors beer and 1/2 Sprite (not diet) to help the bread sweeter and less bitter.

I melted 2 Tbs. butter and poured over the top before baking it for 55 minutes and it came out just right.

it's my own fault, but let me tell you what I did wrong- I made them in a cupcake pan in the hopes of having muffins..... and I also made my own self rising flour as suggested prev. They were hard with no flavor and stuck to the wrappers. However a few "tops" were edible, and I had sprinkled cheddar on top. That was pretty tasty, but not worth the rest. Follow the recipe exactly and you may have better luck!

I have shared the bread from this recipe, as well as the recipe itself more than a few dozen times already.  No one believes it isn't from "you know who".  I added only a teaspoon more sugar to the original recipe and use Coors most often.  No acid or tangy taste, just a nice, dense loaf with a crisp crust.  This is good toasted, too, with jam or just a bit of butter.  Versatile and TOTALLY SIMPLE!    Never buy a mix for this ... not worth the steep price!  ENJOY!

Everyone at my church's potluck thought that this was Tastefully Simple's beer bread. I've made about three loaves of it for myself in the past two weeks, because it's great with everything!

My husband really liked this bread.  I used 1 cup of masa harina (corn flour), and two cups regular flour, plus 4 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, and 1/3 cup sugar.  I added about a cup of cheddar cheese, and let the dough rise in the pan for about 30 minutes before baking.  Before I put it into the oven, I brushed melted butter and garlic powder over the top.  I served it with bean soup. and it was good.  Nice crunchy crust and chewy center.  I used Bud Select beer.  I'd like to try something more flavorful next time.

Quick and easy to make.  It's a good recipe as is, but it's even better with 1-2 chopped jalapenos and ~1.5 cups of shredded cheddar.

AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME. This is a perfect quick bread recipe-crusty on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside! I used Pete's Wicked Ale, a ruby brown ale that is on the sweeter side (but NOT a "sweet", girly beer!). So easy and so good, ten thumbs up!

Ok this was good, not as good as Tastefully Simple but I think with a little playing around it has great potential to be that good. The beer I used Yuengling Lauger (my favorite beer)
was great next time I make it I will add a bit more sugar and the butter on top is a must. Thanks for the recipe.

Used regular flour, 3 t. baking powder, 1.5 t. salt, 1/3 cup sugar, added fine herbes. Let rise about 15 min, then topped with a few black olives and 2 T. melted butter, fresh ground pepper and sea salt. Awesome!

I LOVE this bread!!  There are few recipes that are simpler and easier that result in such a tasty treat :)  Made it for Thanksgiving and people were tearing into it with tons of butter before dinner and eating it as an appetizer!  I always come back to this bread over the years :)

Oh. My. Goodness! This was excellent bread. I used labatts blue light beer, 1/3 cup of packed brown sugar and 4 tablespoons of melted margerine on top before I baked it. The bread is light, slightly chewy, a little sweet and buttery. Everything a bread should be in less than an hour. Thanks for the recipe!

I purchased a very expensive BOX MIX for beer bread at one of those cooking parties.....My husband and I loved it!   I decided to check out "all recipes.com" and found this recipe  went to the store spent a COUPLE of dollars on self rising flour and what do you know....the exact same thing!!  may add a little more sugar next time.

Following the advice of others, I put a third of a cup of sugar: big mistake.  It came out too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll try to do it w/ the original amount of sugar.  No one here cared for it.

Excellent recipe, tastes pretty much just like Tastefully Simple beer bread, which is expensive, if you think about it. I was very impressed, will make again and again. By the way, I used Old  Milwaukee Non-Alcoholic "beer". Couldn't tell the difference.

Wow. After a few adjustments, this does taste like TS beer bread! I did add more sugar, it needs 1/3 cup.Also, make sure and add some melted butter. That is also necessary. I served this with some honey butter and used Miller Lite, since that's what I had.

I got compliments on this bread. It was very easy. I didn't have self-rising flour, but was able to use all-purpose flour and add 1 1/2 tsp baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp salt. 
I would like tips on how to make the top of the loaf look smoother and more appealing, though!

I stole a can of my boyfriend's super cheap beer and this was awesome. I put in 1/3 cup sugar, and that was a bit much. Next time I'll use half that. This was SO tasty with dinner.

I loved this bread, but I made a few changes also.  First of all I made 4 mini loaves, using a Pampered Chef mini loaf pan.  I also put the butter on in the last couple of minutes only.  My kids love this with Honey-Butter, which is so simple to make.  2 sticks of unsalted butter and 1/2 cup or so of honey.  The bread is definately best while it is still warm, but with my family it doesn't have a chance to get cold.  I tried it with lemon lime soda, cranberries and orange zest.  AWESOME!!  I think orange soda and cranberries would be great too.

If there's one ingredient I always have on hand, it's BEER.
I was not super-impressed by the quality of this bread, but I'm giving it 5 stars because it's easy and because you can customize it with different beer, etc.
I made this bread exactly as the recipe shows. I used a bottle of Sam Light since that's what I was drinking when I was cooking.  I did as other reviewers suggested and poured a couple pats of melted butter with some garlic powder on top before baking.  I actually went out and bought a big bag if self rising flour, but that was before I read another reviewers recipe for making your own: (1 c flour, 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt). With all that said, the bread cooked up very well and tasted fine - it tasted like plain bread. I think next time I'll use a non-light beer - I'm sure that's the key to giving your bread flavor. I may actually try using Guinness in this recipe just to see what happens. OH, And to the reviewer who used DR PEPPER instead of BEER - the recipe is called BEER bread, DUH.

ITS SO GOOD~ TRY THIS ONE OUT & SEE WHAT YOU THINK!
 you'll never buy Tastefully Simple mixes again! Sorry but this is just as good & its so much cheaper to produce!
Give it a try & add a little extra sugar to this recipe, depending upon which brand of beer used.
Next time I might add some herbs to it to see how that works out.

Maybe it was the beer I used, maybe my self-rising flour was old, but this was bad. Bland and a little bitter.  It went down the disposal.

This is a great quick bread recipe.
It's simple to make, mixes up quickly, and is so delisious!
It didn't last long in my house, and I made 4 batches (one for each bottle of beer I had on hand).
Highly recommended!

I loved this recipe as a base. I now use it all the time and either add in jalapenos and cheddar or sundried tomatoes and feta. Perfect bread for a quick side!

I made this today, it was amazing. I followed others advice and used 1/3 cup sugar. I made two loaves. One plain and the other I added carmalized onions, garlic powder and some shredded chedder.  I drizzled melted butter over top in last half of baking. Will defiantly use this recipe many times. :) thank you .

Pretty good starting point. For fluffier bread, with a softer crust, I reduce the flour/beer ratio to 2 1/2 cups flour per can of beer, and bake at 300 F. Like some other reviewers, I also use as much as 1/4 cup sugar, depending on whether I want a sweet bread or not.

For as is, this is an pretty good recipe.  I just used some Miller Lite because to be honest, I didn't want to waste one of my more expensive beers on something that I might not like.  I actually thought it tasted really good.  It is a very dense bread, which I wasn't really expecting.  I did like it a little better when I melted butter over the top with a little garlic salt.

I have made this recipe for nearly 40 years, long before it was available in a box.  It is very good, however not a match for the popular mix.  I mix it in a bowl with a wooden spoon just until it is blended, but still lumpy, then pour into a greased pan. The butter can go on when it goes in the oven or about 10 minutes before it is done.  I have stirred in bread mix add-ins or sprinkled garlic herb dip mix on over the butter 10 min. before done.  I keep self rising flour on hand mainly for this. Great with chili or stews!

Easy to do. Came out perfect for me. We paired with the Lentil Soup. Yum! Not sure why but the ingredients made a batter not dough. Spooned it into pan. Melted butter on top at 45 mins. And baked for 10 more. Will do again soon.

I just made this, after reading msny of the reviews: FANTASTIC!  FLAWLESS!! The only modifacations I made,  based on the reviewd i read, were to add 4 tbls sugar instead of three, and I plopped the dough into the middle of a 9x13 pan. I basted it with melted butter halfway through the 50 minutes, and again five minutes before taking it out of the oven, when i also sprinkled it with roughly grated fresh parmesan. It came out GORGEOUS, moist, perfect!! I used Hertog Jan for the beer and self-rising flour.

5 stars as written. I wouldn't recommend a very dark beer for this recipe though. I did not have self rising flour the first time I made it and used the suggestions for substituting. It was not good. Very hard and dense bread.

Yes, this recipe is a MUST TRY.  It is beyond simple, and even though I hate beer, I find this bread is fantastic.  I used a can of bud light... A friend of mine said the cheaper the beer the better, lol... Who knows... I might experiment with a dark beer next time.

Easiest... recipe... ever. To spice it up a bit I made one batch with honey butter on top and one batch with 1 tsp rosemary and 3/4 tsp garlic powder and about a handful of parmesean cheese with more cheese sprinkled on top. The tops become very, very crusty upon cooking. I let mine cool mostly and then put them in ziploc bags. This distributes moisture and makes them less crusty. 

Pro Tip: I made these in a muffin pan and they were great individual little loaves!

I would definitely make this again. Used Miller Lite that was one week away from expiring. Didnt have self rising flour so I made my own by adding 1.5tsp baking powder and .5tsp salt for each cup of flour I used. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly. There was plenty of flavor, texture was slightly crumbly but firm, and a great crusty crust!
No specific negatives, but an overall of four stars.

I like this because it leaves out the butter that clogs up other recipes....although butter tastes great, it doesn't fit my diet.  I added three green onions, chopped.  Sprinkled 1 T grated cheddar on top. Great with soup!

I had some time today, and some left over Guinness in the fridge, so I thought I'd make some beer bread. When it comes to ease, you can't bake any easier than this! I had the ingredients sifted and mixed together and then added in the Guinness and took all of 10 minutes to get some nice batter.

I made some of the suggested changes and used 1/3 cup of sugar, and I made my own self-starting flour by adding a tsp powder and a half tsp salt for every cup of flour (so adding 3 tsp baking powder, 1.5tsp salt). I also let them sit while my oven preheated but there wasn't much rising (!!!). After about 50 minutes in the oven I melted some butter (half a stick) and then brushed it on the top and put the bread back in for another 5 minutes or so (I used different types of pans and wasn't keeping track of time at that point).

I have a lot of trouble with mixing ingredients "until moist" (which is what you do with beer breads), so I figured I might have overmixed this when I let it sit to rise a bit and it didn't. In fact, it didn't even rise much in the oven D: That said, the crust is delightfully crunchy and the insides are SO SOFT and spongy, it's really wonderful. I'm pretty sure overmixing and splitting the batter to let it rise a bit caused my problems. Even so, good recipe! I'm planning on trying it again with 4loko (goodness help me). Definitely would recommend it to others looking for a hearty, savory bread.

Loved this. Crispy outside, moist inside. I used AP flour (added 1 tablespoon baking soda and 1-1/2 teaspoons sea salt) and 1/4 cup of sugar. I let the beer come to room temperature before using. I rubbed the top of the loaf with the end of a stick of butter as soon as I took it out of the oven. I'll use this recipe again.

Like Margaux below, I discovered by accident that the texture of the bread is better if I let the dough (or, more accurately, batter) sit before baking.  I don't bother kneading since this falls into the category of a "quick bread", really.  One can tweak with additions of shredded sharp cheddar and jalapenos and bake as muffins (adjust baking time accordingly) as a wonderful accompaniment to chili.  Just fold in those extra ingredients after mixing the batter.  Oh, must comment. This beer bread will make your kitchen smell heavenly while it's baking!

Really easy and very good!  I was trying to use up some non-alcoholic beer and it worked out just fine.  I increased the sugar as recommended by others.

This is my go-to bread...ALWAYS easy and ALWAYS good!!! If I have self-rising flour I use it, but if not I follow the other recommendations for 1 tsp salt and 1 Tbsp baking powder.

4 Stars for the original recipe, add about 1/2 sugar and it tastes identical to a very popular but expensive beer bread recipe with the same amount of work involved!!!

So delicious! I use what ever beer I have on hand and you really do get some of the beer's flavor in the bread! Sometimes I use more of a fruity beer or darker thicker beer and it always turns out great! Great crust too! I put some butter on it with some garlic seasoning and it was AWESOME! Very quick and easy bread to make for any occasion!

Very easy and tasty.  I made this with a extremely robust beer that I really couldn't stand to drink but it made great bread.  I also made self raising flour by adding baking powder and salt to the flour.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I made this into Cinnamon Bread using 1/3 C. of sugar and  all-purpose flour with 3 tsp. of baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp. of salt. I also added just shy of 1 tsp of cinnamon (recommended by a co-worker). I made a half batch of cream cheese icing (found on allrecipes as "cinnamon bun icing") Soooooo good!!

Easy and delicious!!! I used a wheat berry beer, and it was a little too sweet, so next time I will adjust the sugar accordiningly. (Made for an awesome French toast, though!) Can't wait to make this again!

Just made this tonight.  I was trying to recreate Tastefully Simples Beer Bread.  And after reading other reviews I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  However, it just wasn't quite as sweet at TS.  Close but no cigar.  I will try it again and increase sugar a little more. It's still good, but doesn't taste quite right with TS spinach dip.

This is a great recipe.  It came out perfect. Perfectly moist on the inside and a wonderful cruch on the outside.  I made it around the holidays and added some nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves and chopped walnuts and used a fall beer such as Oktoberfest or a Pumpkin Ale.  I also made this with a Christmas beer and added nutmeg, cinnamon and cranberries.  I've also used Christmas beer and chocolate chips and pecans... The possibilities are endless. Just a classic, simple recipe that anyone can make their own!

Very close to Tastefully Simple recipe. I was having a pregnancy craving and couldn't wait for my order to come in! I took the advice of other's since I did not have self rising flour and added the 1T baking power and 1tsp of salt. Also added a few more spices (21 seasoning solute from Trader Joe's) I felt like it needs more flavor to me. Maybe next time I will go with dark beer and add cheese! I look forward to giving it another go!

The bread tastes great, however, 12 oz of beer does not seem to be enough liquid.  The bread was way too dry.  I increased the beer to about 18 oz. and it worked better.  This recipe is a good one!

I was looking for a tastefully simple copy and this is very close.  I purchased a 3 pack box of tastefully simple and made both at the same time to compare. Trial one was not sweet enough.  I added the 1/3 cup sugar another review suggested.  It still was not as sweet but very close and my son liked it better because it was not so sweet.  This recipe baked up higher than TS brand.  I sifted my flour and that really helped, was too compact.  I can't believe how easy this recipe is and the price they charge for flour and sugar.

Really great hot out of the oven, but not phenomenal once it cools.  Was great w/ a little honey butter, mainly because it has the density of a biscuit.  I'll make this again & try it w/ shredded cheese as another reviewer mentioned.  Also, upped the sugar to 1/3 cup, made 4 small loaves, let rise 30 mins before baking for 35 mins at 350, and brushed w/ butter 1/2 way thru baking.

Easy recipe. I will prolly not use Corona again, but it was all I had on hand. I did what another user suggested. I halved the dough, let it sit for about 20 minutes then baked. I also buttered the glass bread dishes before putting the dough in. It slide right out after cooking.

Made this a dozen times, used Miller Lite! It is sweet and comes out perfectly every time. For best results, bake and cool. Refreigerate over night, better the next day and it cuts easier when it is cold.

I used a light lager since that was all I had on hand and didn't change the recipe at all. I thought it was great and will be a great recipe to play with - next time I will use a dark beer and add aged cheddar and jalapenos or bacon.

I used this recipe as my inspiration today.  I used Gordon Birsch Marzan Auburn Lager and made additions of 3/4 cup extra sharp white cheddar and 1 tsp of fresh course black pepper.  Based on other reviews I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup using a combination of white and brown sugar.  I basted the top crust with butter for the last 5 minutes of baking.  An instant read thermometer probe placed into the center of the bread read 191F when it was finished.
This was very, very good.  Nice and crusty on the outside, tender and moist on the inside.  I like that it's a basic recipe so I can change it up as the whim dictates!    Will definately make it again.

My mom used to make this, and I got the recipe from her.. it makes a crunchy, almost hard crust and soft insides. I followed someone else's suggestion and let the dough rise for half an hour.. perfect! It's got a softer crust.. definitely not as rough, and delicious! Thanks for the memories!

1st attempt, didn't see the "self-rising flour" part.  D'oh
So tried it again, but added 1tsp salt, 1tbsp baking power and 1/2tsp of baking soda. along wit a some tasty Upper Canada lager.
both times, let it sit in the pan for whatever it's worth

anyways, tasty Canuck beer = tasty results.

This is the best beer bread recipe I have ever found. If you're searching for a good recipe, look no further! My mom used to spend a fortune buying beer bread mixes until I shared this recipe with her. I love trying out local or seasonal beer in this recipe. My FAVORITE was a loaf I made with Samuel Adams Winter Lager. It tasted perfect and I strongly suggest you try it in your bread! Next Winter, I will buy a case of it specifically for this purpose.

I've been making this bread for years--it's such a big hit and couldn't be easier!  So next time you make it, go out to your garden and grab a BIG handful of rosemary, chop it up and add it to the ingredients....tastes and SMELLS out of this world!  This is such a fun recipe for kids to make and mix with (clean) hands!!!

I really loved this bread it was easy and quick. I did add sugar (1/3 cup instead of the recommended) and had to use a recipe from below in making my own self rising flour. I used a cheap beer and it was delious (and I don't care for beer). Yummy thanks!

I love this recipe and have shared with my friends and family.  I don't know if its my oven or the recipe, but mine only took about 40 mins. in the oven.  

This fall I plan to experiment and use one of my husband's pumpkin beers.

I was hoping that this would have the same crunchy top as the Tastefully simple but it did not. Guess I should put butter on the top just before it is done. Otherwise this is a wonderful loaf!

I make this anytime I need a quick easy bread recipe to go with dinner, or need a dipper for impromptu get togethers.  Everyone loves it, and no one can ever tell it's different from the expensive mix.  And everyone requests the recipe.  I use about 1/4 sugar and often add any herbs I feel will go with whatever else I'm making.  I've made with all sorts of light and dark beers, and Coors Lt seems to be the best.

I love beer bread but this didn't cut it for me.  It wasn't nearly sweet enough and way to heavy.  I tried it twice and the second time added more sugar like others suggested but I still prefer the mix from tastefully simple.

I've been making this recipe for over 30 years, my grandmother found it in an old fishing magazine and over the years we've added cinimon to it along with soaking some raisins in the beer and adding those also.  Once out of the oven brush with some melted butter, yumm.

Must admit, I made a mistake and used baking soda instead of baking powder the first time I made this (since all I had was ap flour) and I was going to rate this a 1 star, but after realizing my mistake and correcting it, I am so glad I did! This bread is so yummy! I used a Coors light and added the 1/3 cup of sugar, as suugested by others. I also added 3 tsp baking powder and 1.5 tsp of salt since I did not have self-rising flour. Easy,easy, easy, and it is SO delicious! Kids and hubby love this.

YUM! This bread is SO GOOD!!! Only thing I did different was add 1 handful of finely shredded Mexican cheese to the batter. I took the advice of others and I let the batter sit in the pan for about 30 min before baking. The bread baked up nice and high and the texture was light and airy. I used a bottle of my Father In Laws homemade Amber beer. Delish!

I don't typically bake much, but decided to try a quick bread to have with turkey chili. This was super easy and was mixed and in the oven in less than 10 minutes. Definitely a quick bread...I used Shiner Bock beer and it was pretty tasty right out of the oven and worked well with the chili. The leftovers aren't that great and I found it hard to slice nice, uniform slices.

Let me start off my saying this is the best quick and easy bread ever!! I loved this, the crust is super crunchy the inside is super soft. I followed the recipe to a T and used Budlight for the beer. Can not wait to try it with other beers! SO Easy!!!!!

used 1/3 sugar and still not as sweet as I would like it, will use a little more next time.  Also used the self rising flour and seemed way too dense.  Try to let it sit for an hour before baking, like others suggested.

The recipe was very simple, easy to make, all the more to add or subtract things you like and dont like.  My first try I used Corona (my beer pref) and it was just okay.  I do think that it needed more sugar and I did add a little cheese to the top for added flavor.  I plan to make this again just with different beer.

This is great when it is fresh out of the oven!!  It's not so great later on once it has gotten cold, so you might as well eat it all while it's hot!  I like dipping mine in olive oil with fresh pepper.

I made this bread with a New Belgium Mothership Wit. Just seemed like a wheat beer would be the way to go. It was a hit at my place.. 3 people almost finished off the whole loaf! I did make it with 1/3 cu sugar as suggested, and have no complaints. Will definitely try again with different beers to see how the flavors change. My husband is a fan of many beers, so I seem great opportunity in the future! (c: Also loved how quick and easy it was to make.

Just plain easy.  I constantly get rave reviews everytime I make this.  It's also amazing to use different styles of beer which really affect the flavor and color of the bread.  My favorites so far are Two Beers Brewing Co. Belgum Wit, and Dechutes Porter.

I think the bread was similar to the expensive boxed breads. I used my husband's Killians Red and I can taste it very much in the bread after baked. Im not sure its my favorite.. but I know my husband really likes it. It is slightly dense and little crumbly. Yummy crust like a corn bread. Moist and good with butter on it. Very easy to make! Probably will make it again for my hubby...maybe try a different beer and some cheese! Thanks for the recipe.

Wow!  I cook and bake all the time.  Didn't realize how easy beer bread was to make.  VERY GOOD!!  I made mine using 1 can of root beer and then threw in about a cup of mini cinnamon chips.  I also upped the sugar to 1/3 cup.  When done I toasted a few slices and put a tiny amount of butter on them.  Great alternative to a regular quick bread.

Always been a fan of adding brew to cooking to bring out new flavor, and this was not too bad.  Although I didn't really taste much from the first attempt (I used Abita Amber, local brew), but I'll try other ales to sample the difference.  Very easy to make, and I'd think any way you go about it, it comes out good, ...I suppose unless you throw something like Nat-Ice or Keystone or Milkwuakee's Beast in it...

So simple and easy.  I use 1/3 c of sugar because that's what I've always used, and brush butter over the top 10 minutes before it's done baking.  Always a hit.

This was awesome!  I poured about 1/4 cup of melted butter on top before cooking. It went great with Chili.  It is all gone, and I am tempted to make more.

This outcome of this recipe depends ENTIRELY on the type of beer used. The author should suggest at least a genre (e.g., pale ale, stout, etc.).

I've made this several times now and it's always great. Fresh out of the oven with butter is perfect. I took some other reviewers tips and made my own "self rising" flour.

I didn't have self-rising flour so I used another reviewer's suggestion for "homemade" self-rising flour. I saw another reviewer's comment that they used diet cola instead of beer, so I tried it that way first since we didn't have any beer at home. I only had Diet Dr. Pepper and let me tell you that doesn't work well for this recipe! It was so gross. For my second attempt I used a bottle of hefeweisen beer and it turned out amazingly well. Paired with some garlic dip it was out of this world. Amazing how simple this recipe was.

Very similar to Tastefully Simple beer bread. Only changes I made : 1/2 cup of sugar and made mine own self rising flour. So far my favorite beer to use is harvest moon (blue moon beer), sweet and full of autumn flavors. Best Dipping Sauce: 1/2 C Mayo, 1/2 C of sour cream, 1 T soy sauce, 2 tsp parsley and 1 clove of garlic.

I made my own self rising flour from this site. It was 3 cups flour and 1 1/2  teaspoons salt and 1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder. I used a bud lite someone left at my house and I threw in a handful of cheddar cheese. I thought mine was a bit sweet and i only added a pinch more sugar, next time i might use a little less. This was nice and dense and moist. Delish!

Delish and simple!  I had to make my own self-rising flour (from the recipe on this site) and used some leftover Dos Equis XX and it was fantastic!  My only complaint was that it was a bit dry, but that was nothing a bit of butter+honey couldn't resolve.  I ate it hot out of the oven, yum! =)

Sorry, but we didn't care for this. The outside was chewy and the inside was crumbly and the taste was strange. The recipe didn't say how long to mix the batter so maybe I should have done it longer or maybe I stirred it too long. I just don't know. I made this because I wanted a recipe using self rising flour but I won't be trying this again.

I loved this recipe, but for some reason my oven cooks things a lot faster on the outside than on the inside so by the 50 minute mark, the outside of my loaf was darker brown and the inside was all dried out. So what I decided to do was make the batter using the 3 cups of self rising flour, 1/3 cup sugar and a Miller Genuine Draft and bake it in a silicone 9X9 cake pan. It took 20 minutes and was a lot more moist. About 15 minutes in I also took some melted butter and poured it over the top of the bread and continued baking for the last 5 minutes. This is my favorite variation I've made so far.

The only change that I made was after baking the bread for 50 mins I took the bread out and poured 1/2 stick of butter (melted) over the top and baked for another 10 mins. It was very yummy! We ate it with strawberry jam or just heated up with butter on it.

This is a good recipe to use instead of the Tastefully Simple mix (but add 3 TBSP of melted butter on top of the dough just before you cook it - I did and it was great)...I checked the ingredients on the TS box and it is almost the exact same (flour, baking powder - which contains sodium bicarbonate, sugar) -- I will be experimenting with this one as the first batch turned out great!

Great, easy recipe. I've tried 2 different beers - bud light and american ale.  I think the lighter taste of bud light is more appealing to us, since my husband isn't a beer drinker.  Overall, though a very good recipe.

This is good and easy BUT make sure you like the beer you use. I used Guinness b/c i let my husband choose the beer. Guinness worked well but it was too bitter for my taste as i prefer sweeter breads and he prefers saltier or savory ones. I did add about 1 cup of cheddar and some salt to the bread. It is still good, i eat it with butter and jam and can not taste any bitterness. Do let the bread rise for 30 to 60 min before baking, and if you want a nice crust, butter the pan and put butter on top. You cant ruin bread with butter, so as much or as little as you like. I did use the 1/3 Cup of sugar suggested by others, next time however i will add brown sugar and try with guiness again to cut that bitterness even more, maybe even a cup of brown sugar and some dried fruits. IMO beer bread better lends itself to sweeter flavors in order to get rid of the bitterness that is going to be present. I know that not everyone can taste or dislikes the bitterness but for those of us that can taste it, make a sweeter beer bread instead

easy and tasty! I used a shiner black as the beer. I think a dark beer probably will give the best flavor. Went well with our soup tonight. I would definitely make this again :)

This is a good recipe if you are in a hurry and you don't feel like using yeast. It taste pretty simuliar to sour dough. I found the dough a little sticky, but it still turned out just fine!

I used an ice cold beer when I made this bread, and it didn't rise very well. I guess I should have left it get to room temp before adding it to the mixture. Next time I make this, I'll use a room temp beer as well as let the loaf sit in the loaf pan and rise for a while before baking.

Amazing! I made my own self-rising flour per other reviews. Threw in a handful of cheese. Brushed top with melted butter before baking. It was delicious but will be better next time when I use fresh baking powder instead of "past the use by date" and add more cheese. Sifting the flour and using fresh baking powder make a big difference in your final product! Want to try it with herbs or nuts or toasted sesame seeds, too. I used Shiner Bock but want to experiment with different beers. I ate this toasted with some honey butter. BF ate it plain. We both loved it!

This was pretty good right out of the oven but not so good the next day. I think it needs something. I may add some cheddar cheese or something to it if I try it again, or may even try a different beer.

Mmmm...........this is perfect! I made one loaf plain and one loaf with cinnamon. I poured 2 tbsp melted butter over the top of each before baking. The one with cinnamon in the batter I also sprinkled with cinnamon sugar before baking. They got rave reviews at work.

I've been looking for a less expensive alternate to the TS mix, and after a few tweaks to the recipe I've found it!

I use 1/2 cup sugar instead of 3 Tbs, and 1 1/2 cup buttermilk instead of beer.  Guess it's not "beer" bread anymore, but it sure is tasty!

The BOMB!  I don't keep self-rising flour in the house, so I followed another reviewers advice (1 c flour, 1 tsp baking powder, 1/2 tsp salt) and it turned out perfect.  I also added 1/3 c sugar and a handful of cheese to the mixture and baked it into 2 mini loaves, per another reviewers advice.  For a little kick, I added chopped jalapenos to one of the loaves for the men in the house.  Everyone raved about the bread.  I'm sure it would taste great even without the cheese and jalapenos.

Why buy bread when you can make this??? I don't use self-rising flour. 1 C. self rising flour = 1 C. regular flour, 1 Tbsp. baking powder and 1/2 tsp. of salt. Try a variety of wheat beers in this. The cherry wheat and the pumpkin beer make tasty variations.

Delicious.  Two of my favorite things in one: beer and bread!  I actually only made 1/4 of the recipe (I do that a lot with recipes since I'm just baking for me) and it worked out fine, and I had 3/4 of a can of beer left to enjoy while it was baking!

I wasnt crazy about this bread. I have had tastefully simple beer bread and have grown to crave it. When I attempted this recipe to the T, it just wasnt the same - the texture is not the same, nor the taste. However, I used a light beer - perhaps with a stronger beer it would have been different.

I LOVE this recipe. I use it all the time, and it is always gone within a few hours. I make my own self-rising flour and add an extra 1/3 cup of sugar. This bread is PERFECT with the sugar addition. I highly recommend it!!!

Love it, used 3 c flour, 3 tsp. baking powder, and 1 tsp. salt, added cheddar cheese (so left out a little salt) and garlic powder, used Blue Light, was great with spinach dip and still good day after. Move over Tastefully Simple!  Is REALLY good with Blue Moon as well!  Trying again letting the dough rise as someone else suggested, cheap delicious and FOOL PROOF!!!

This was a great recipe I followed other reviewers and did 1/3c sugar and put butter on the top before baking, Oh and I also put some cheddar cheese in the mix. The bread came out great and so easy to make. I have never made bread before. I will be making this again it is a keeper. Thank you for the recipe.

Fantastic and very easy! I was looking for something similar to Tastefully Simples mix, and this is very similar, I think just a tad more sugar, and it would be identical.

Gotta say, I did not like this recipe.  I think you need to be wary of what beer you choose.  The bread was too dry and dense with too much of a yeast flavor.  I used Saranac Indian Pale Ale. Maybe a fruit flavored Sam Adams or something else.  Maybe give it a try with real flour and yeast along with some more sugar.

Wow!!!!  Made this with Hoegardden sp?  My boyfriends fav beer.  He LOVED it.  He is not a bread fan, but he nearly ate the whole loaf with the chili and could not stop raving about it. Made it with 1/2 a cup with sugar too, and let it rise for an hour before baking.  SO easy and SO good.

I have been wanting to make bread, but it seemed a daunting task.  We were bored to death here because of a snow day with lame snow, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I used Budwiser, but I can't wait to use a Guiness (did not want to waste my Guiness unnecesarily!)  This wasa easy and yummy!  It gave me confidence to try other recipes!  Thank you!

This is my staple recipe- everyone always asks me, "Can you make beer bread??" It is amazingly easy and disappears quickly every time I make it. I cut it into cubes and serve it with the dill dip recipe from this website.

I used Whole Wheat Pastry flour and added 1tbs baking powder & 1.5tsp salt. I also followed others' advice and upped the sugar to 1/3c. I topped with oatbran/wheat germ and poured a few tbs of melted butter on top.
This turned out just like the expensive boxed wheat beer bread! We will definitely be keeping this recipe and are happy to find a replacement after long kicking the boxed kind! It's nice knowing what's in your food!

This turned out great. The first I have ever had beer bread. So simple and easy. Can't wait to try it with some potatoe soup. Thanks for sharing.

Super easy directions to follow.  Like many others, I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  I added a handful of cheese to mine and allowed it to rise for 3o minutes before baking. I also took others advice and poured melted butter to my loaf beforehand and mid-way through as well. YUMMY and moist!!!!!

This is excellent, I have passed this recipe on to so many people. I love the dense, moist texture of this bread. It's prefect with chili and stew, just rip off chunks for dunking. Mmm, good. I make as directed, I don't change a thing and I use whatever beer I have on hand. Oh, and I pour a little melted butter on top before I pop it in the oven.

I made this last night, with Shiner Bock beer as another person had suggested. Served w/butter & honey. It was good, and I will make it again w/a miller light to see if there is any taste difference.

I serve this up warm with beef stew and soups to a bunch of guys on the weekends. One loaf doesn't last long! I use Miller and increase the sugar to 1/4 cup. ALSO, as with biscuits, you only want to mix until the ingredients are JUST moistened. I let it rest for an hour and pour 1/4 cup of melted butter over the top right before popping it in the oven. Use a serrated knife to gently cut through the thick crust without crushing the loaf.

I used Stella Artois, two-thirds wholemeal flour, and added chilli seasoning, cheese, pepper and mustard to the mix.  I poured about 50g butter over before baking, and the loaf turned out well--but neither my husband nor I were particularly keen on it.  Like many quick breads it had a slight baking powdery taste, and the flavour was strong but not particularly pleasant.  I'm glad I experimented with this, but probably won't make beer bread again.  We don't usually have beer, so it doesn't seem worth the bother!

This is a great starter recipe. The bread is really chewy and the crust is crunchy. I used Coors light beer and it had no beer taste whatsoever which is good. I also added 2 tablespoons of melted butter into the mix. Additions of herbs or other flavors would be great and bump this up to a 5 star.

My bread machine went kaput and I needed a simple recipe for a bread bowl - this was perfect.  I baked it in a pie dish and I did add some string cheese chopped up so there are "cheesy spots".  Also added some chives and poured the butter over the top as recommended.  Very easy and tasty.

Can't imagine bread making can be that easy!!
Personally I like savory bread, so I add ground black pepper and dried basil, with extra 1tsp salt and drizzle with olive oil before baking!

I can't believe this recipe!  It was SO easy and SO tasty!  I didn't have the self-rising flour so I'd followed another reviewer's advice and added 1 tablespoon of baking powder and 1 teaspoon of salt to the flour.  Also increased sugar to 1/3 cup and poured 1 tablespoon of melted butter over the top of the batter right before I put it in the oven.  It rose beautifully and my loaf came out looking exactly like the photo on the recipe.  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

Good flavor and I only used a bud light.  I made my own self rising using the suggestion people had of 1 Tbsp baking powder and 1 tsp of salt.  However, I think I will add more baking powder & salt.  It came out pretty gummy and heavy on the inside.  Crust was nice consistency; would reduce butter or wait to brush on towards the end.  Good solid bread, but not light in texture. I cooked at 350, 50 mins.

Yummy and super easy to make! I even goofed and put 1/2c. of sugar in it, meaning to use only a 1/3c. But it worked out because I used Heinekin, which is a pretty strong-tasting beer. I added cheddar cheese and parsley to the mix and topped it with melted garlic butter 35min. into baking. I also didn't have self-rising flour and used the all-purpose flour substitition. Great recipe!

I thought this had a great taste and went well with the soup I made.  It did have the consistency of corn bread therefore was not very firm and would fall apart.  My husband thought it was a bit sweet (perhaps the beer I used: New Glarus Spotted Cow, and the amount of sugar) - next time I would like to try a dark beer and lessen the sugar a bit and see how that turns out.

I've used this recipe for years and it's great! I like to add chopped parsley and 1 cup of shredded cheddar to my batter for Herb Cheese Beer Bread. This tastes best when you use plain old Budwiser or MGD, avoid lite beers. Good stuff!

I don't like beer but I loved this bread!  I used Michelob and increased the sugar to 1/3 cup.  This is so simple for such a moist and delicious bread.  Made it twice in the first week.

Bakes up into a nice moist bread.  I used a strong darker beer and it left an unpleasant after taste.  I will go with a lighter beer next time which I'm assuming will correct the problem.

I just made this recipe & it is a keeper. I see myself making this many times over. I actually got this recipe from Southern Living & it calls for 1/2 c. sugar, bake at 350 for 45 min. pour 1/4 c. melted butter on top & bake another 10 min. I used Michelobe Ultra Light (the low carb beer). Simple & Wonderful!!

I made this bread using hard cider and it didn't come out quite the way I thought it would. I've made the bread using beer and was very successful with it's outcome. Does anybody have any suggestions on using the hard cider versus the beer? I would greatly appreciate any comments as this bread is very good, quick, and simple to put together.

I used Budweiser and I could just smell it in the bread. The bread was good. But I dont recommend using Bud. Very easy to make.

The hardest thing is getting up the nerve to go and buy the beer!  But it was worth it.  This bread tastes like you slaved all day and it only takes a few minutes.  I bought dark beer...  For those of you who don't want to make it because you don't like the smell of beer, it really doesn't taste like it.  Go for it.

This is a great, easy recipe!  I add a half cup chopped sun dried tomatoes, and I pour 4 tbps of melted butter and garlic powder over the top before baking.  Its a great bread because you can throw in anything you have a lot of... but make sure to add the melted butter for a crunchy taste!

This bread was great. Although it's more like a biscuit texture, the taste was good. It's best when eaten warm with butter. It has a very cripsy crust and tender middle. This would also be great with a big bowl of chili or vegetable beef soup. Next time I make it I plan on using leftovers to make french toast.

THIS IS SUPER DUPER EASY TO MAKE!!!
But i don't think anyone mention that this tatse and have the texure of a biscuit
the taste was different...I used foster's beer and I think it gave it a really good 
taste...but it fell apart i could not cut it... awful!!! i made this in my bread machine, maybe that is why
But i won't be making it again...i don't care for biscuits.

Funny I added this to my recipe box so long ago and forgot that I'd made and didn't like it.  This time it was much better.  It must have been the beer I used.  I will have to play with it a bit more.  I took a few of the suggestions I found too - increased sugar to 1/3 cup, brushed with butter and dusted with garlic salt then brushed with butter again when it came out of the oven.

This bread is wonderful!  It is so easy, and it uses ingredients that you normally have on hand (except for the beer, maybe).  The only reason it is not kid-friendly is because of the beer.  This got rave reviews at the party I took it to!

Quick and simple! I wish I could’ve gotten a browner loaf. I used 1/3 cup of sugar as suggested, and a Coors light. I had planned to use a Red Stripe... forgot. Good taste with butter while it was nice and warm.

We have been making beer bread for about 40 years.  Someone gave my husband the recipe.  Ours differs in that it calls for an egg.  3 cups self-rising flour, 1 egg, 5 tablespoons sugar and 12 ounces of beer.  I personally think it is too much sugar but my husband strictly follows the recipe.  We have always made it that way and everyone that tastes it thinks it is great. 

Our daughter just spent 2 days making loaves to give to teachers and friends for Christmas. 

We don't have a problem with it being crumbly as one or two reviewers said.  That may be because of the egg or because we use an electric knife to cut it.  It also doesn't get hard by the next day.  We love it toasted for breakfast.

Very quick and easy beer bread without any additions.   Totally all about the beer used.  Easy and quick, though,  with a little bit of kneading to get the bread all together.  Nice warm with butter, jam,  or honey. Thanks for the recipe!

So tasty and easy!  Hadn’t made this in years and had forgotten how good it is.  I did up the sugar to about a third of a cup and spread the top with softened butter after removing from the oven.  And, to keep it fresh, I think that I’ll keep it in a brown paper bag overnight as my old recipe suggested.  Thanks for a great “blast from the past”!  Loved it!!

Wonderful taste, very easy, but I did add an extra 1/2 cup of flour because it was more like cake batter than bread. I did as others had said and went with 1/3 cup sugar as I like my beer bread sweeter and also melted butter and garlic salt on half way thru baking time.

Very good recipe. I don't have self rising flour so I made it per the others reviews.  Best way to measure the flour correctly is by weight, 3 cups = 12 oz or to sift it.  Butter is a must for the top!

I made a couple of changes per the review comments including adding some shredded cheddar cheese to the batter, adding nearly a 1/3 cup of sugar to the batter, letting the dough rise in the loaf pan for 30 minutes before baking, brushing melted butter and sprinkling course salt on the bread after 30 minutes of baking and brushing more melted butter when the bread was done baking.   I used a lager beer for flavor.  This will be a keeper recipe.

I used all purpose flour so I added in 3 tsp baking powder and 1.5 tsp salt.  I also increased the sugar to 1/3 cup as others suggested. It turned out well! Very easy to prepare and nice texture and flavor. I’ll make it again.

Used only 1.5 tsp of sugar and substituted quick oats for one and a half cups of flour.  Also substituted a half cup of high fibre flour for half a cup of the remaining flour.

i think following the recommendation of the extra sugar makes it too sweet for my liking, but other than that it’s great! i made small scone like structures in muffin pans and baked at 30 min instead

This turned out better than I expected. I used only 1/2 the sugar and it was still a little too sweet for my taste so next time I’ll just leave it out. Will try again with some different beers and some added herbs and spices.  Thanks for Recipe!

Turned out good and easy to make.  I just prefer to have my bread a little sweeter.  So I will probably double the sugar... but that is me and my family’s personal preference.

I will never buy a "gourmet" box of beer bread mix for $7 again. I bought a 10 lb. bag of self-rising flour and will make many, many loaves of this for just $3.39!  Can't wait to try adding things like cheese and fruits.

Love this recipe. It’s fast and easy. I cut the bread into big cubes and serve with dill dip, (or other dips.) It’s my “go to” party take along.

It didn't turn out for us. It was still doughy even after 1 hr 20min of bake time. Crust was thick. Might try it again to see if it was the weather causing it to not work right.

Great tasting and easy to put together bread! I do add some melted butter to the top of the bread before baking. I have 2 loaves  of this in the oven right now... although, one of the loaves I added about a cup of shredded extra sharp cheddar and some dill weed to. Going to be yummy! Thanks for the recipe!!  SUGGESTION: The recipe, as written, shows the oven temp as 350 F or 175 degrees... I assume the 175 is Celcius...it would help others if the "C" was added to the recipe so it is more clear. :)

I made it! I halved the sugar like others said and it didn't smell as sweet as the TS mix. It still tastes great and I'm a little mad at myself I spent so much money on a 6 ingredient recipe (3 ingredients being all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt instead of the self-rising flour) and 2 ingredients I have to supply with the TS mix anyway.

This turned out perfect! I used the self riding flour recipe mentioned and added some sharp cheddar, garlic salt with parsley, and onion powder. Same stuff that's in the cheddar biscuits at seafood places. I will definitely make this again!

This recipe is great! I didn't have self rising flour so I added the baking powder and salt to accommodate it. I used miller high life beer because it was in our fridge since New Years and this bread is yummy. Oh I did melt 2 tablespoons of butter and poured on top before baking this. Give it a try.

My family has made this for years because my dad saw a recipe on the bag of flour ??Making your own self-rising is a fabulous idea and I will try it, but I highly recommend adding two tablespoons melted butter halfway through baking.

Extremely easy and very good.  I used Michelob Ultra and also used 1/3 cup sugar.  Not bad for my 1st time making beer bread.  I definitely need a different bread knife.  It was very messy and hard to slice.

I've made this beer bread many times. It has just enough sugar. It's easy to whip up and serve warm with your dinner meal. The only thing is, I never put my hands in it--way too sticky. I have no problems just using a large spoon. I like to put  2 tablespoons melted butter over the top the last 10 minutes of baking.

Made this tonight 4 the 1st time in my new CI loaf pan. Not a beer drinker & asked Niece 2 bring me some tap beer, worked great. Did use 1/3 cup sugar & spread 3 tbl butter before baking. Not a bread eater but this was so good. Will make again. So EZ. Just mixed ingred with wooden spoon. Let rise 4 45 min prior 2 baking then spread butter.

Soooo easy!  Made my own self rising flour for this.  Had a bottle of Miller high life so used that.   Seasoned with garlic and herb spice and Romano cheese.  It is freakin delish.  Baked at 375 for 40 minutes.  Perfectly done. I didn't even mix with my hands..just stirred and dumped into glass loaf pan.  I did let it sit about 10 minutes while the oven preheated and the bread rose nicely.   Will become a staple in my repertoire for sure!!!

This made pretty good bread and it was so easy.  I used all-purpose flour and added 1 T of baking powder and 1 tsp. of salt.  I did use 1/3 cup of sugar.  I buttered the top when it came out of the oven.  Next time I will add some garlic.

Very impressed with this bread as the recipe seems almost too simple. I did follow the suggestions of others to put 1/3 cup sugar in and also letting it sit and raise some before baking. I will say this though, once I got it mixed together, it was a dough, and not a batter to pour. May just be the dryness of winter Iowa air though.  Good stuff!!

For as simple as this recipe is, it was great.  I did sub honey for the sugar by warming up about a 1/4C each of honey and beer in the microwave for just a few seconds, stirring that up, then mixing into the rest of the beer and flour.  When the bread was done baking, I brushed a little melted butter on top.  Very, very good basic beer bread.

I add cinnamon, nutmeg, sliced almonds, marichino cherries and 2 ounces of the cherry liquid. It is awesome and everyone loves it. I serve it for breakfast and bruch. A little  goes a long ways with the cherries and it adds a nice color.

I made this as written, my family LOVED it. I then made another loaf with roasted garlic seasoning, again great. You can really flavor this one up. It's great and easy!!

One of the most easiest and tasty breads that i have made. It literally took only 8 to 10 minutes to prepare the dough but baking  almost took 80 mins. I made some alteration to the recipe as follows: Substituted beer with non-alcoholic lemon malt, 2 tbs of brown sugar and 2 tbs of white sugar. It turned out really nice but was slightly sweeter than i would like. 
I will definitely try this again with different flavoured malts.

I've made with many different kinds of beer. But hard cider was the best. Super easy and very delish.

As written - Maybe more like 3.75 stars...
After multiple attempts, I had the most success with self-rising flour, 3 T. brown sugar and 12 oz. beer (I have also made it with 1/4 c. honey, cane syrup, or molasses).

CRITICAL STEPS: Blend dry ingredients together well. Then SLOWLY pour beer over flour while stirring as little as possible to combine. Then, gently mix in honey/molasses.

Preheating the pan for just a few minutes makes coating it with melted butter simple. Then, scoop sticky batter/dough into bread pan or 12 muffin tins and bake just until lightly browned and crisp on top. Muffins cook 15-20 min. A loaf takes 45-55 min, depending on type of pan and oven.

I have had success with . . . Shock Top Spiced Banana Wheat and Honey Crisp Apple Wheat, Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, Sam Adams' MerryMaker (Gingerbread) and Guinness.

I have made this recipe as written a couple of times with fine results -- it was just a bit crumbly and difficult to slice. This time, I added one beaten egg and it really helped. As a quick bread, the dough is quite thick and sticky to mix, so (as the recipe suggests) hands were necessary for me. I baked at 350 for the full 60 minutes.

This recipe has been in my tin recipe box since the 70's. I have made it quite a few times through the years. It is the easiest and very delicious. I like to toast it with butter in the morning. Thanks for putting this recipe up for everyone to enjoy.

Moist and delicious. I used a local brew: Andygator by Abita. So rich. It added tons of depth to my egg salad sandwiches. And it's good alone.

I love serving this bread with soups.  Like one person suggested, I tried baking mine in a 9x9 pan and it turned out really good.  Sometimes I pour butter over the top before baking depending on what I'm serving for the main meal.  Overall, I love how quick and tasty this bread is.

I've made this several times.  I always add three tablespoons of gluten to help eliminate the crumbling.  It's good plain, but I sometimes brush the top of the loaf with a couple tablespoons of melted butter and add a sprinkling of toasted onion flakes ($1 in a shaker from Rural King) or celery seeds.  Sometimes I add 1/3 cup of old-fashioned oats and a couple tablespoons of ground flax seeds to the recipe.  I let the loaf cool for just a few minutes and cover it (still in the pan) with foil to let the moisture soften the crust, or you can put it in a plastic bag while warm for the same reason.  I usually use Killian's Irish Red beer.

So easy!! I made this paired with hamburger helper and green bean casserole. I didn't have self-rising flour so I made my own adding salt and baking powder to all-purose flour as others had suggested. I melted 3 tbs. Blue Bonnet margarine and poured it over the top of the bread before baking. Blue Bonnet seems to me to bake as good as real butter and taste as good too in almost anything. This bread looks as good as it tastes. I plan on making it again.

Easy to make!  Great taste. Had a nice crisp/crunch to the top.  I didn't have self-rising flour so I added salt and baking powder per guidelines I found online.  Used Coors light and had a nice beer taste.  Great recipe!

I made this recipe with Blue Moon Mountain Abbey Ale and it was delicious! I did make one change which was to place it on a sheet pan instead and cut it along the length. I am really happy with the results and plan to make it again with Billy's Chiles beer for a jalapeno cheese variation.

Been making my own yeast breads lately as I try to get away from all packaged items, but there are times that this is a bit intrusive upon a busy schedule.  When I saw this, I figured it was worth a try, but I have to agree with others:  when you review a recipe, do it based on the recipe as written. 

As written, this is GREAT.  Simple as can be, flavorful, etc. I used Budweiser, as it's neither heavy nor light. (I actually had to buy beer, as we never have it in the house.)  I baked it, took it out, brushed with butter (okay, I guess I diverged from the original just a little), and then took off for errands. I had it with my chicken cacciatore for dinner. Perfect. Honestly, you really don't need to change a darned thing.

This was one of the easiest recipes i have come across.The flavor was light and hearty at the same time.After making it once I can see where different seasonings may be added to take it to another level.I will try some turmeric/garlic powder & freshly cracked black pepper, in sparing amounts of course!

Didn't have the self-rising flour so I used the all purpose flour + baking powder (3 tsp total) and + sale (1.5 tsp total) and it worked perfectly!  Used a can of Coors Light.  Went great with my Beef Barley Soup!  Didn't get 5 stars just because I so love yeast bread.

Just made this bread today.  Like one suggested, I used all purpose flour + baking soda + salt instead of self rising flour.  I only had light beer on hand, so I used that.  The bread got two thumbs up from both my husband and daughter.Thank you for the recipe.

This is one of the easiest & best quick bread recipes. I've been making it for 30 plus years. Just mix the 3 ingredients together & bake in loaf pan. Goes well with soups & is even better if you have left overs & toast in toaster oven.

I'm not sure if this is a fair rating.  I'm not a beer drinker, I used a bottle of beer (Lagunitas) that my friend left at the house.  It still had a beer taste and  yet also bland at the same time.  However this was really quick to make.

Tried this with pumpkin beer... very good.  I am excited to try it with other flavors too... I didn't have the self rising flour but thanks to the other ratings, I was able to substitute.  PS... makes awesome but crumbly ham sandwich bread.

I seem to be a failure at making bread with yeast, so this is my go-to bread.  So easy and tasty! Its so easy to add other ingredients to change the taste of the bread (garlic and Italian seasoning, cheddar cheese and jalapenos, etc).

Perfectly easy and delicious when served hot/warm with dill dip!  This is the way I've always done Beer Bread and my whole family loves it!  I was very glad to find such an easy recipe!  I take it out of the oven, butter the top and immediately turn it out onto a platter, butter the remaining crust and break it up into bite size pieces.  Then, dunk into dill dip and wow! Yum!  Thanks for the great recipe!

Since this bread is so dense, I added a little baking powder, salt, and extra beer; made 2 mini loaves(8x4) and let them sit for 30 minutes before baking. I poured melted butter over the tops bofore putting them in the oven, half way through, and again after removing from the oven. Baked at 350 for exactly 45 minutes! Turned out Excellent!

It was good, now WOW, but good.  Fast, simple, good for a quick bread.  I used the 1/3 c sugar as other readers suggested, maybe a little sweeter than what I wanted.

This bread is very tasty.  I made mine using wholewheat bread flour.  My 1st attempt was a flop as I doubled the recipe to try and make a full size loaf.  The bread just wouldn't cook.  I baked it for approx 1 1/2hrs before giving up.  The taste was very good and the kids really liked the flavour, so I tried it again.  This time only making one loaf and allowing it to rise for 1/2hr, adding 2 1/2tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt, I cooked it for 60 min.  It was delicious.  I'll make it again using my modifications.

I used shredded cheese in the batter as suggested and added a nice taste.  I mixed some rolled oats with garlic powder.   Brushed the top with butter and then added the garlicky oats over it.

I too made it 1/3 cup of sugar and it is spectacular! I have made it several times and it is always perfect. I also make my own self rising flour. If you pour melted butter on top before baking in a 13x9 you get all these beautiful craters that are my favorite part. Keeper recipe!

Very basic and tastes like beer thats what I was looking for in the recipe... i have seen other recipes with herbs and spices that I will also try but this was the basic recipe I was looking for... I took the adivce and made my own self rising flour 1 cup flour to 1 tsp baking powder and 1/2 tsp salt... worked well... next time I will also try brushing the top of the loaf with butter... and maybe sprinkling with garlic salt for added flavor...

Wow!  Absolutely excellent!!  I have been searching a beer bread recipe to taste like the beer bread mix you can purchase from Partylite's food line.  This is the one!!  I did make a few tweaks.  I like it a bit sweeter so I used 1/3C of sugar AND the 3T the recipe calls for, I used Guiness beer,  and added 3/4C shredded cheddar cheese.  I put the batter in the greased loaf pan and let it set for 35 mins. the right before I put it in the over I poured 4T melted butter over the top...that is the PERFECT recipe for this bread if you want great flavor, perfect density, a little 'crunch' on teh outside and wonderfully soft on the inside...a real 'cozy, comfort' bread for chilis, soups, dips, etc.

I have been making this for a few years and have told most my friends about my beer bread secrets. I always make cookies, bread, everything with self-rising flour. It just skips steps and tastes the same. I also add garlic, and italian seasons... I've also used this for a homemade pizza crust. Works wonders everytime!!! 5 stars for me!

The bread rose well, and had a nice crust but was very lacking in flavor. I did add 1/3 cup of sugar as others had recommended. I may try to add butter to the bread next time.

Tasted good..maybe a little on the salty side. I ate it while still warm. In preparing the batter, I used 1 can of heinekin beer (12 fluid). Added baking powder and salt to make it self-rising flour because I did not have any on hand. I split the dough into two small loaves but I think I could have just baked in one loaf pan. it did not rise too much. but felt more dense. Top was crusty, inside soft. Nice crunch to every bite. I added a 1T of fresh chopped rosemary herbs. This was a nice change of bread (texture).

I can't believe that everyone likes it this much.  It was pretty bad - salty - apparently self-rising flour has salt.  It was very, very dry - very crumbly - too crumbly for even the toaster tomorrow.  I reviewed the recipe and I did it absolutely right - although I added 1/4 cups of flour, as opposted to 3 TBS, as other have recommended.  Maybe it should have been 16 oz. of beer.  Thank god I previewed it with the family rather than serving it untested for Easter.  I would have been SOOOOOO embarrassed.  Will be tossing the recipe.

It came out awesome, even though I mucked up the flour. I used Sapporo Beer and will be trying it again. I think the outcome of the bread really is dependent on what kind of beer you use.

So easy and versatile. I've used many different beers...my favorite so far is Pete's Wicked Strawberry blond, and add some brown sugar, and butter on top. Delicious!

Very easy, flexible recipe.  5 ingredients if you don't have self-rising flour on hand.  I was in a hurry, and didn't even measure the salt, baking powder, or sugar (just eye-balled them) as I couldn't find the measuring spoons - still turned out fine.  I added a couple sprigs of rosemary, chopped, and DH said he liked the subtle rosemary taste.  DH also said, however, that the bread was "nothing special", and he couldn't taste the beer.  Personally, I found the beer flavor very strong, and had trouble eating this bread plain - but it would be lovely with a soup or curry.  Our 4-year-old twins liked the bread just fine.  I don't have beer around often, so probably won't make this recipe that often.  I like "Honey Oatmeal Bread II" better, but will probably make this bread occasionally for a change of pace.  If you love beer and often have it on hand, this might be a 5-star recipe.

I thought it was pretty tasty but the kids didn't care for the taste of beer bread.  Ironically, they also prefer the taste of mac n cheese from a box! LOL

Oh my!!! I was craving a beer bread and this completely hit the spot.  I increased the sugar to 1/2 cup as some reviewers suggested and we had a Saint Arnolds Oktoberfest (Houston brewery) in the house so I used that.  WOW...the loaf is gone!  Great recipe!!

We thought one cup of sugar was a little too sweet and will probably decrease it a bit when we try this one again. Great with fresh garlic cooked in!

This is so easy and tasted delicious! Would be perfect with stew or chili. Mine was very crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I used Big Rock Traditional Brew and it had a great flavour. Will definitely make over and over! Thanks!

This was very easy and had a nice texture, however even at 1/3 cup of sugar it was nowhere near as sweet as the Tastefully Simple mix, and even though I used the exact same beer in both, I found this one came out more bitter. I think next time I will use more sugar.  Thank you for a very good starting point!

Amazingly easy and tastes great!  Have also made this with chuncks of roasted garlic and cheddar.  This is not a light bread as you would get from bread machine, but is great with soups, stews and with an addition of cajun spices is great with jambalaya!

This was good, although definitely not as good at Tastefully Simple's, in my opinion.  I used the exact same beer as I always use when I make TS's (Oberon) but it turned out kinda bitter in this recipe, which was odd.  I didn't have self-rising flour, so I used the following, as suggested by reviewers: 1/3c. sugar, 3 cups all-purpose flour, 3 teaspoons baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt.  And I of course added 2T melted butter on top before baking, which is a delicious addition.  I'd like to try a different recipe next time due to the bitterness.

Easy, fast, tasty.  No sugar needed but needs salt.  I tend to tweak it by substituting 1/2 a cup of flour with oatmeal or adding ground nuts.

Our family LOVED this one! We added the 1/3 cup of sugar like many of the other reviewers did and it turned out great! I like to add the melted butter on top like the Tastefully Simple one does as well. Very, very happy with it. Made it onto my status on Facebook even! :)

This recipe was awesome. I wanted to make it right away after I read it but I didn't have self-rising flour so I used the the suggested amounts of baking powder and salt with regular flour.  I also used 1/3 C sugar. I coated the bread pan with butter and drizzeled some melted butter on top of the batter before baking it. It was perfect. I had to make another batch right away because my roommates had almost finished the first one within 15 minutes!

I was very impressed with how this came out. I didn't have self-rising flour so I followed the previous suggestions of adding baking powder and salt to regular flour, except I forgot to add the salt. Although the lack of salt was noticeable in the flavor, the bread still tasted really good. And I even used a super cheap beer left over from a party that I would never in a million years drink. Straight out of the can, I think it tastes nasty, but it added a wonderfully subtle flavor to the bread. The crust was nicely crisp and the inside was soft, moist and dense.

I found this recipe in an old cook book and then lost it and yours was the first to come up on my search. It's the exact same recipe and tastes great. I made it tonight and added 1/2 of a sweet onion diced, 1 jalapeno pepper diced, and a cup of grated cheese and it was so so good.

This was really good! I will never buy Tastefully Simple beer bread again. This recipe was so close to that kind that I don't think you would be able to tell the difference. Next time I think I will try adding just a bit more sugar to make it a little sweeter. That is just my taste though. I used a Corona beer.

Made this last night using a bottle of dark beer that had been hanging out in the pantry for awhile.  I increased the sugar to 1/4 cup and melted a little butter and poured on the top before I baked it.  Turned out great and went well with a chicken stew for dinner.

Next time I will make using the self-rising flour.  I didn't have any and didn't want to make a special trip to the grocery store.

Followed the receipe except added the melted butter on top as one viewer had suggested.  this is not similar to tastfully simple beer bread.  this bread is a finer dough. I did not have to mix with my hands because batter was like cake batter. Will try others.

This wasn't very good as written. It wasn't nearly sweet enough. I feel like if there are three ingredients and one has to be substantially changed then it's not that great of a recipe on it's own. You will need much more sugar to make it enjoyable.

This bread is very easy - I added chopped jalapenos and cheddar cheese into the mix. Topped it off with butter mixed with mac and cheese powder and garlic salt. Everyone went wild over this bread! Thank you for the recipe, it's lots of fun to mix and match other ingredients into.

This bread was okay.  I think my problem may have been that I was comparing it to the Tastefully Simple beer bread which is to die for.  I think next time I'll add a little more sugar.

I LOVE this bread.  So easy to make and I always get positive reviews/recipe requests.  I am still working on getting it to rise a bit more- I have tried letting it sit out 30 minutes before baking, which helps, but still working on it.  (Also using the self-rising flour "cheat" as described by other reviewers.)

This is a very quick and easy bread.  I took others suggestions and used 1/3 cup of sugar.  I also used a Canadian beer which tends to be stronger tasting than American beer and the bread came out great.  It would be a great served with a hearty soup!

Very good! Similar to the Tastefully Simple mix and nicer to your wallet ;) I used 1/3 cup of sugar and drizzled 3 tbsp of melted butter on the dough before baking it. Comes of crusty on the outside and soft on the inside!

I have never had beer bread before, so when saw this recipe it sounded delicious and easy enough. I was right, it is super fast and couldn't be easier to make. I don't usually have self rising flour on hand so I made my own by combining 1 cup flour and 1 tbsp baking powder.  The only beer I had on hand at the time was a case of Samuel Adams after going thru them my son and I decided on the Sam Adams Chocolate Beer -- definitely the perfect choice.  Oh yes, I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup as noted by a few other reviewers.  The next time I made it I followed some other suggestions and added a cup of Mexican Blend and Cheddar Jack Cheeses.  Thats also good.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  My husband and son ask for it all the time.

Great recipe! So easy.  I only had bread flour, so added the tablespoon of baking powder and teaspoon of salt.  Had no problem.  An excellent and convenient substitute for Tastefully Simple's expensive mix.

I was in a hurry and sort of combined several recipes using this one as the base. I used half wheat flour and half white and 1 T baking powder, and 1 t salt for the self rising flour. 3T sugar and 1 can of beer.  It was AWESOME.  When I used the Sam Adams Ale my boyfriend pronounced it "kickin".. it made some great grilled corned beef and swiss sammies.  Also I made it again with a light beer and added some caraway seeds, took to a friends house and 3 of us polished off the whole loaf in one sitting.. different beer really does make a big difference in taste.  This is a great recipe to play with

Excellent recipe!  I did however leave the beer out to get to room temperature before mixing in.  I also baked this for 55 minutes and then buttered the top and put back in for another 5 minutes.  Came out moist, delicious and flavorful!

Not bad at all.  Flavor was a bit off, maybe a biscuity taste.  I'm sure adding some spice or flavors would cover it.  Much cheaper than TS, I'll make again.

I just wanted to add that I make my own dark Winter Ale.  I use 12oz. of my dark ale and this gives the bread a wonderful taste. Nothing better than a glass of dark ale and a nice slice of fresh bread.

I made this with a cranberry lambic and it was excellent. I did use 1/4 cup white sugar and made my own self-rising flour. Couldn't be any easier, will definitely make this again.

I truly hate to bake, but when I tried my sister-in-law's beer bread, I loved it so much I had to have the recipe!  Like so many others, I used the 1/3 cup of sugar, and brushed melted butter on top.  This was in the oven in less than 3 minutes.  I don't hate to bake anymore!

I thought this was just ok.  The only beer I had on hand was beer with berry undertones.  The berry flavor wasn't prominent - the bread really didn't have a whole lot of flavot of any sort.  Next time I will try the suggestions of other and try to add a few things to spice this up and I will probably use a different beer.

Sooo good. Sooo easy. My only problem is that I couldn't wait for it to cool before eating it. Crumbled everywhere. Still tasted great. Served it with a spicy hamburger soup. Will surely make again.

I doubled this recipe since i had a bag of self-rising flour that was due to expire.  Used a total of 1/2 cup of sugar.  Filled a loaf pan and 12 muffin pan.  Very good and freezes well.

This is just another raving review; a super easy and tasting recipe!  I followed the suggestions for 1/3 c sugar and melted butter on top.  Mine baked up perfectly in 45 minutes.  It was served with chili - and so glad there's leftovers for tonight!

Talk about bang for your buck! This is the most simple and yummy bread you could whip up. I use the butter and garlic salt on top trick and that gives the bread an irresistible little kick. I make this at least once a month and have tried all different beers. Wheats seem to work the best - Sam Cherry is really delightful.

Very tasty.  I also used 1/3 cup sugar total and used the mixture recommended by other reviewers as a substitute for self rising flour (1.5 tsp salt, 3 tsp baking powder, 3 cups flour).  I melted 2 tsp butter and poured over top before baking.  Next time will try with a woodchuck cider beer.

This is my first time to bake this beer bread, I dont have any self rising flour nor regular flour What i use is cake flour and add extra 6 tbsp. cake flour and i did what the other members did i add 3 tsp. baking powder and 1 1/2 tsp. salt. i let is rise for 60 mins. and put melted butter and grated cheese on top.. it was so yummy.. i only use the local brand of beer (san miguel pale pilsen) but it turned out to be good.  i will definitely do this agaid... this is a cheap but very delicious bread.

This is the BEST!  I've made it with both Woodchuck Pear Cider and Woodchuck Granny Smith Apple Cider.  Both are AMAZING, but I slightly prefer the pear version.  I used 1/4 cup sugar.  I have been asked for the recipe every time I've made it.  Several people have told me it is the best bread they have ever tasted!  :)

Love, Love, Love this recipe. Make sure you use the 1/3 cup of sugar as others have suggested. Used with Blue Moon Winter Ale and turned out fluffy and pretty. So simple and much cheaper than other premixes. Everyone wanted recipe. Used with dill dip...awesome!

Unbelievably easy, I could not serve it to the kids fast enough, they finished it before the dip was done.  Used to sell tastefully simple, I am so glad to have found this, much cheaper. And 3 ingredients! WOW!!!

I was looking for a beer bread recipe that is much like the beer bread you can order from Tastefully Simple.  This was not it.  I found this recipe to be very flourery tasting.  I will not be making this again!

This was very yummy.  I'm not sure why, but mine had a bitter aftertaste in the crust.  I used 1/2 King Arthur wheat flour because I ran out of white flour.  I used Bud Light because it's what I had.  Could it have been that?  Other than that, it was great!  I'll try again as directed.

I've never made beer bread before-I'm embarrassed by how easy it was!  This was delicious!  I added about 1/2 cup shredded cheddar and used Michelob.  Definitely will make again!

I baked muffins and drizzled honey and butter over each one before serving.  They are best eaten hot...just out of the oven.

Excellenr, delicious, moist bread.  Crust is crisp right out of oven, but will moisten when bread is stored.  I use about 1 1/2 tbs of sugar, because I don't like my bread to taste sweet.  Shiner Bock doesn't leave a beer taste, but turns the bread more golden.  Try it.

I served this to my husband and some friends the first time I made this.  I should have made more that one loaf!  So incredibly easy and delicious!  I love that it's crunchy on the outside and softer inside!  My husband wants me to make it with every meal now!  I can't wait to try it with different kinds of beers, ciders, etc!

Pretty good. I made beer bread from a pre-made mix once and it was fantastic. This is close, but it's not quite the same. Very easy, though.

This was okay, not as good as the boxed mix I usually use.  It was a little bit too dry.  The guests at my party didn't seem to mind, though.  I served it with spinach dip.

I had very high hopes of this, but just didn't like the taste.  I think I used a beer that was too strong (one my fiance was drinking, an IPA, I think).  I found the bread bitter, though it tasted better with the dill dip I was serving too.  Other people seemed to like it ok, but there was definitely a good amount left at the end of the party.  It looked nice though, I also added cheddar cheese.  I will try this again with a different beer and hope for better results.

Good, quick and easy.  I didn't have any self-rising flour, so did what other reviewers said and had 4tsp of baking powder to the flour and a tsp of salt.  It would be great with corned beef and cabbage.  I also used guiness and that gave it a good flavor.

Following other reviewers' advice, I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup, split the batter between two pans and let it sit for 30 minutes.  I poured melted butter on top as well. The bread was fantastic!  I had recently been to a Tastefully Simple party and was looking for a similar beer bread.  This is very, very close!  It was a hit with everyone of our family and friends who tasted it.

I added the 1/3 cup of sugar per other suggestions.  Personally I thought the bread too sweet but my boyfriend loved it. Might have been the beer I used as well (Bud).  Othwersie, it's definitely a keeper and I know I'll have fun experimenting with this one.

This came out great!  I put about 1 1/2 Tbsp of melted butter on top before cooking (and let the batte rise about 20 min before putting into the oven).  My husband loves this - he just had 3 pieces tonight!

This is simple and awesome.  The flavor is so different depending on the beer you use.  I just made some with Guinness extra stout to go with some potato soup.  The bread turned out brown instead of gold.  Adding cheese and herbs is great too.  I always put 1/4 cup melted butter on top and sprinkle with sugar before baking.  If the beer you use has a bitter finish, you will taste it in the bread.

This was good, but unfortunately the flavor of the beer made for a bitter taste.  Dipped in bean soup or with butter it was great, though. I used the extra sugar, put butter on top and made in 2 separate pans, still ate it up.  I do not like the flavor of beer but even my beer loving husband said it was bitter. I loved the texture, though. I will make it again but use a bubbly soda next time. Great recipe for watching your pennies.

Awesome!  Delicious, fast & easy!  Impressive presentation, too.  This is staying in my recipe box.  I can't wait to make it for guests.  I did increase the sugar to 1/3 C. like other reviewers suggested.  Excellent.

Good easy bread.  I thought it was just a bit too salty and just a teeny tiny bit on the dry side but maybe I baked it a little too long - 57 minutes.  I used the 3 cups flour with 4 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, and 1/3 c sugar and poured 3 TBSP melted butter over top before baking.  Next time I'll use the self-rising flour instead and follow the caterer's advice and let it rise about 30 minutes to produce a lighter bread, and I will decrease the salt to 1/2 tsp since I use salted butter on the top.  It is very similar to Tastefully Simple's.  I think TS's is sweeter and lighter, and not as salty, but it's really not a big difference at all.

Add a touch more sugar than what the recipe calls for; absolutely delicious (we like it with soups and stews) and so much cheaper than the pre-packaged mixed.

Great recipe.    So easy and wonderful flavor.   Didn't have too much of a beer flavor.   Next time I would go along with others and add melted butter to the top of the batter before baking as I had difficulty getting my bread to brown.

This is an awesome beer bread and really simple to make. I added 1/3 cup sugar and 1/2 cup ground flax seed, then poured melted butter over top before baking. It was sooo yummy and really easy to slice. I was even able to toast it the next day. When you put in in a plastic bag it softens the hard crust.

This recipe was definitely easy, although it tasted pretty doughy.  I tried it with a Newcastle Brown ale, and I think the English-style may have been the wrong beer style for this bread.  I'll be trying it again with other styles (a Bavarian wheat, or a smoked porter maybe?) and see how it works out.

Good bread!  I would add a little more sugar if you are looking for a substitute to the expensive beer bread mixes.  This bread is so easy to make and can be made savory by adding spices.  Will make this again!

This has become a staple in my home but I've actually found that doubling the sugar results in a much tastier bread. I love the idea of adding herbs and cheese- I think that would make it a five star.

ok....had to change it quite a lot, not sure if i should rate this...had meant to take it to a party...started with the basic recipe, added a couple spoonfuls of sourdough starter (had increased the amount of flour and had to make my own self rising flour-4 1/2 t. baking powder, salt and increased sugar a little...added shredded zucchini and diced fresh tomatoes)...put in Mrs. Knorr's veggie dip (it didn't rise as much as expected), but kids ate it all, and had none to take to the party!!  thanks for a great starter recipe!  will make it again today, and probably add some cheese...

So good and so, so easy. I've been using Budweiser Select and it gives a slightly nutty taste. I love that the top and sides of the loaf are so crunchy but the inside is super soft! I've also added a little bit of shredded Parmesan on the top for extra flavor.

This bread is really good for how easy it is.  I used Victory Brewing Company's Golden Monkey beer.  I let the dough sit for about 20 minutes  and poured a couple of tablespoons of melted butter over the top before baking.  I will defintely make this again, but next time I will probably add cheese and peppers.

I use a honey wheat beer from a local brewery. I used a darker beer, once, and the flavor was too strong for our taste. After putting the dough in the loaf pan, I pour 1/4 to 1/2 c. melted butter over the top, then let the dough rest for 10-15 min before baking.  I cut this into cubes and serve with a jalapeno sour cream dip at parties, and it always disappears.

This is a great jumping off point for all sorts of quickbreads. I followed an earlier recommendation and allowed some time for the beer to leven the bread before baking. Combined with the low heat, it really helps develop some lightness in the crumb.

Very, very good and easy too!!  I made a loaf to try before bringing it to a St. Patty's Day get-together.  The only change I made was added 2 TBL melted butter to the top before cooking.  I will be trying it again tomorrow with the chedder and jalapenos addition...can't wait!  Thanks for sharing!!

Scrumptious, delectable!! I used 1 can of Stella Artois, added a pinch of salt,   half a cup of finely chopped olives and chopped 10 pieces of sun dried tomatoes and a handful of shredded cheddar cheese.   Mixed the flour, sugar and salt, added the cheese and then mixed with the beer.  Mixed in the olives and tomatoes, put in the oven. Took 50 miutes to bake - drizzled butter 10 minutes before taking out as suggested by other reviewers. The crust was yummy.

Really easy to make.  Chewy texture.  I added some melted butter and garlic salt to the top before baking to jazz it up a bit.  I think other seasonings/topping would be fun to try too.

It doesn't get any easier than this.  I had no garlic bread on hand to serve for dinner when company was coming over.  I was in such a hurry I didn't think to make the garlic cheese version as suggested by other reviewers - none the less it was a huge hit.  I used home ground whole wheat and added salt and baking powder to make the flour called for. YUM!!

I would like to give this 5 stars because it is so easy to make, but this just was not that impressive.  Now to be fair, I'm not a fan of beer, but I've tried other beer bread recieps before and enjoyed it.  This turned out dense and the only thing I added was 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese, and I did let it sit a bit before putting it in the oven, as others suggested.  I used MGD but maybe I should have used Bud Lite instead??

I loved this recipe.  I used 1/3 cup of sugar and had no self rising flour so I used the baking powder and salt that the others mentioned.  I also used a light beer because I do not like the taste of beer.  It was great.

Wow!!  I am impressed...I was in a pinch for a bread for our table since we were expecting company and I wanted to stretch dinner.  I had one beer that had been in the fridge for months - so here I was.  I replaced the sugar with sucanant.  It was WONDERFUL - none left after dinner!!!

I have been making this bread for at least 20 years. This last time I made it I took someone's review and added cheese. I used mozzarella cheese with sundried tomatoes and basil. I believe it is Sargento's brand. I used Coors Light Beer. It was the best yet!

So easy and tasty. I used a little less than 1/4 cup of sugar and it turned out perfect. It is best toasted with some butter on it. Awesome with chili!

Yum!  This bread is fantastic!  I left the sugar amount alone and it was definitely sweet enough for me - I might even cut it a bit if I'm in the mood for a more hearty bread.  I didn't have self-rising flour so I added 1T baking powder and 1t salt, as suggested by other reviewers.  This bread bakes up beautifully and is so easy!  I used Bud Light that we had leftover, and it was  little bit bitter (old beer), but that was my own fault.  This would be even better with a good, fresh beer :)

Talk about gooey dough!  I used an oatmeal stout.  It is definately good, thick stew bread.  I took the advice of others and used 1/3 cup sugar, melted butter on top, and a sprinkling of course salt.

I added some grated cheddar cheese and diced jalapenos for a little extra kick. Pretty tasty and in all honesty I would probably give it 5 stars if I liked beer. ;^)I was looking for recipes to use up the Warsteiner beer my houseguest left behind when he went back to Germany. Thanks Jodi.

Delicious! I made this with a Sam Adams black beer and added about 3/4 cup of cheddar. I served it as bread bowls for beef stew. A tremendous hit!

This was my first time ever baking bread. I was very impressed by how easy the recipe was and the kitchen smelled great while it baked. I used foster's beer...which ended up giving too much of a strong beer flavor but we still thought the bread was pretty yummy. Also, added 1/3 cup sugar like others suggested. The crust was a little tough to cut through. I look forward to experimenting some more with this recipe. Would be a very good pepperoni bread with pepperoni & cheese. Yum!

I used Fosters large can (25 oz) and made two loaves of this bread at once. I baked them both at the same time and didn't have to extend the bake time. The beer flavor was strong, but this was very good. It was delicious warm out of the oven. I loved how easy it was. I will make again.

This is a great fool proof quick bread. I use Shiner beer and serv it with strawberrie freezer jam. I followed other reviewers suggestion and increased the sugar to a third cup and poured melted butter on top before baking.    My dinner guests don't believe how simple this recipe is and actually insist I make  it in front of them!

I've grown up with this recipe and I LOVE it.  Although, I must second the other reviewer that said that Corona IS NOT a good beer for this recipe.  I grew up with Bud in it and I think I'll go back to that.  As I said, I love this recipe...but you have to be open minded...it is NOT some fancy bread to be served with your fine French Cuisine.  It is however some good hearty bread that goes great with any simple, home cooked meal.

I've only bought the Tastefully Simple bread mix in the past so when I made beer bread with this recipe my kids were eager to have some.  My daughter however wouldn't eat it saying the other "recipe" was better.   The rest of my family though enjoyed it.  I think next time I'll add a bit more sugar and try putting butter on top before baking.

My family loved this bread. I thought it was a little tough.  It is a quick and easy recipe. Best when eaten warm. Due to the lack of fat in the recipe it was not good on the second day. I think the beer bread recipe that you pour the butter over, before cooking, is much better

I enjoyed this recipe greatly.  I made it as written, and thought the results were outstanding considering the amount of effort, or lack thereof, put into it.  The only downside was the consistency was a bit crumbly, I may try adding cheese next time to increase the moisture a bit.  Great recipe, thank you.

I added 1/3 c. sugar as others had suggested.  I served it w/honey butter.  It's awesome.  It's extremely fast and easy to prepare, and taste wonderful.  It's very moist.  My family loved it.

It was okay at best.  WAY too biscuit like for my taste.  When I made the Tastefully Simple bread, it lasted one day.  When I made this bread I threw half away after 5 days.  I'll keep looking for one that is as good.  Thank you for the recipe though!

What a waste of ingredients. Tried it 3 times with different drinks. Everytime it was bad. I'll stick with pampered chef thank you.

This bread is not super attractive but the taste makes up for it.  And it is so easy.  I make this when I am in the mood for homeade bread but don't have the time..A great substitute!

You couldn't find an easier recipe to make.  I didn't have to mix it by hand.  I used Michelob Lite and it was delicious.  I found this bread to be more of a quick bread consistency.  It did not resembele biscuits to me.  My teenage son asked for another loaf.  Two loaves in one night!  I made the second loaf a little sweeter using 4 T of sugar instead of the 3.  Great recipe, thanks.

I made this with shredded sharp cheddar and jalapeno peppers (from a jar).  Toasted slices
of it under the broiler with butter the next day.
Very good, but next time I will go easy on the
peppers or use sun-dried tomatoes.

Easy!  Fast!  Yummy!  What more can I say?  I used "Bud Ice" and it turned out fine.  I didn't have the problem that some spoke of concerning the next day.  If we've been lucky enough to have any left over for the next day, it's been just fine.  I think I'm going to try some suggestions and add some different ingredients next time to flavor the bread differently.  Sounds fun!  Thanks for the great recipe!

After I made this recipe once, I made at least 8 more loaves within the week! It was so good! For each loaf I used Labatt Blue (a nice, rich, Canadian beer), and I added sun dried tomatoes, cubed sharp cheddar cheese, and a little butter and dried rosemary on top. I also cut down on the sugar a little bit, and made my own self rising flour. My guy friends loved it, and even my non-drinking parents liked it since you could really taste the beer in it (but Blue tastes great, so this was a good thing). Thanks again!

This review confirms the opinion of others who've reviewed this recipe, it's very biscuit like and it needs to be served right away.
I'd added some rosemary and oregano which added an interesting flavor, my husband liked it much better than I did.  When I took it out of the oven I had to beat him out of the kitchen to stop him picking at it, but when I served it with dinner he didn't touch it again, saying it just wasn't as good.

Yuck!  I don't know if I did something wrong but the crust tasted and had the texture of shoe leather!  What I could scrape out of the inside tasted ok but I ended up tossing the whole thing.

This was a great, very dense bread. I had some beer bread at a restaurant the other week and it was so good it inspired me to make some. This was nothing like what I was looking for but tasted great. The whole loaf was gone in a day in my family of three.

My family just LOVES this bread...it's a little bit sweet. I used Michelob Light beer and I figure that the alcohol in the beer probably bakes out. The whole crew had fits over it and it took probably 5 minutes to throw together and get in the oven.

Very easy and quick to make, but I didn't care for the taste very much. It was somewhat tolerable when I put a thick layer of butter on w warm slice. I'm sure a lot of it depends on what kind of beer you use. I used Corona Extra.

Maybe it's because I used old,low-quality beer in this, but this tasted TERRIBLE.  On the plus side, it's quick and I was able to do it in the bread machine without any alterations.

This is super easy and good. My kids loved it till they found out there was beer in it. I've made several times and it always goes fast.
