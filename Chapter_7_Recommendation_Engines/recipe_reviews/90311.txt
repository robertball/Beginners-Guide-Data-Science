Amazingly easy and delicious! I've done this recipe several times now. It's even a simple and tasty recipe for just the fish. I've used pollock when I didn't have tilapia and even served it over plain pasta when I didn't have mizithra cheese. I've substitued canned mushrooms, canned diced tomatoes, and lemon juice from a bottle. I've added zucchini, basically substitute and use whatever is on hand. Very versatile dish! FYI - I just had to register in order to give the first review on this recipe. I've used this site since 2002 and my husband wanted mizithra pasta like the Old Spaghetti Factory. I tried this dish to use my leftover cheese and wanted to give credit to this recipe.

Fantastic Meal!  I made it even lighter by switching out the starchy pasta and using spaghetti squash instead.  I made it for four people and used a whole medium-sized spaghetti squash.  I cut the spaghetti squash in half and put it on a plate filled with water face down and microwaved each half for 8 minutes.  I allowed each half to cool and then scarped the spaghetti squash out into a bowl.  I then sauteed the squash in 3 tablespoons of butter and then added Mizithra cheese.  My husband and I absolutely inhaled it!

Like others, found this an enjoyable way to prepare tilapia. Also, I ended up using a blend of several other hard cheeses since finding mizithra in a small southern town just isn't going to happen...and it was just fine. Thanks!

Not bad.  I over peppered my tilapia--oops.  It was a bit spicy but still okay.  I'm not sure what the mizithra adds bc I've never had it and didn't have it on hand for this dish.  I used a very sharp chedder and crumbled it over the top, and that worked well enough.  I left out the mushrooms but otherwise left in the rest of the ingredients.  I'm a bit confused by the garlic--it's in the ingredients but not in the directions (unless I'm blind, always a distinct possibility) so I just added the garlic at the halfway point when I flipped the tilapia.  It's not my favorite tilapia dish--more bc I love bold flavors--but it was nice to try.  Thanks for the recipe!

The fish was a little bland for us but then it may have been great with the Mizithra cheese; I used Parmesan because it's all I had.  I used a box of pearl shaped pasta w/mushroom seasonings and skipped the lettuce in the dish.

My husband and I liked this recipe, my kids were not big on it.  I was a little reluctant to add the romaine lettuce to it, but it turned out fine.  You just have to be sure that any leftovers you have don't have the lettuce mixed up in it.  I'm not sure if I would make it again as a family meal.

I made this dish but changed it a little.  I cut down the amount of olive oil and I didn't have mizithra cheese.  I added a couple of ounces of soft goat cheese when I tossed the fish with the pasta.  I also served it with grated romano on the side.  Thanks for the basis of a great meal.
