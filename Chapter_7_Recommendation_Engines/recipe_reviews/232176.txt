I have not put in nutmeg.. I added pumpkin spice and cinnamon., in one batch and the other batch id add just cinnamon, I also used Swissmiss cocoa.. it is so nice and creamy.

A good rich instant coffee is key, you want that rich coffee taste and a creamy chocolate. I like to make this for my co-workers for the holidays
