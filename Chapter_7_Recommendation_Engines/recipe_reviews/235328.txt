We added jalape√±os instead of chili peppers. Next time, we will add more peppers.

This was disappointing. Most rice recipes with eggs have you first scramble them and then add it to the rice. Mixing the egg in while raw resulted in a mush that most of my family found very unpleasant.

This is a good guide to make fried rice at home. I made it with instant rice. You just have to adjust the amount of water to do that.

Well, I almost always give 5 stars, but this recipe was disappointing.  A tablespoon of sesame oil is way too much.  I used 1/2 teaspoon.  The eggs need to be scrambled first, then added back at the very end.  The rice should be cooked the day before and added cold.  Basmati rice is really good.  I used a pinch of red pepper flakes, increased the garlic, added grated carrot and sliced fresh sugar snap peas.
