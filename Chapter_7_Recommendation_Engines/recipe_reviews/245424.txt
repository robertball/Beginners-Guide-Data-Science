This is tasty. I made a few minor tweaks. I had a 16 oz bag of French lentils so adjusted volumes accordingly. I added the spices to the onions and cooked till fragrant and added the garlic after and only cooked till soft (I was afraid it would overcook if I added it with the onions). I used white basmati rice. I liked this very much. Next time I will saute the carrots with the onions as they were a little mushy for my taste. I used the water I cooked my lentils in to keep the mixture from drying out. In order to do this quickly I started my lentils and after 5 minutes I started the rice. After the first 10 minutes of cooking the lentils I started sauteeing the onions so when the lentils were done it was all ready to combine and then serve.

Lentils are so good for you and this is a great way to make them! I will make this again. I like to shave a little Parmesan on top too.

Delicious! Kids loved a vegetarian meal and it was their first time eating lentils. Omitted the cayenne, added a splash of lemon juice and ginger.

I cooked the onions garlic for a few minutes and then added the spices in with them before I added the lentils and carrot mixture. Also I didn't have any cayenne pepper so I just used ground black pepper and it still seemed like it was missing something. It needed something acidic so I added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to the mixture before serving and that's exactly what it needed! Much better!

This was delicious! I made it just as the recipe stated and then followed the advice of another reviewer and added a tablespoon of lemon juice at the end. I happened to be watching a cooking show with a famous chef and she said that she often added a splash of lemon juice or vinegar at the end when cooking lentils. Be sure to use a very big pot -- this is a BIG batch of lentils!

Delicious and even easier and better with brown rice! I made this with brown basmati rice which makes the cooking simpler because the brown rice cooks as long and at the same time as the lentils and gives it more of a nutty flavour. Followed the advice of others: 1) fried up one diced onion until translucent 2) added 1 cup brown lentils 2 cups stock then 1 cup brown rice & 2 cups liquid best with stock. Added 1 tsp cumin garam masala and 1/2 t cinnamon for some spicy sweetness 3) brought to a boil and simmered low for 40 minutes. No need for salt if there's some in the stock. Served it with fried onions a yogurt raita with cucumber and mint and sprinkled some fresh chopped cilantro and smoked paprika over it. Delicious! -- and better than any I've had at restaurants!

I made it without the rice. It was good but I didn't care for the texture of the lentils.

We made this tonight and it was delicious!  Our whole family enjoyed it, even the picky 13 year old.  The only thing we changed was swapping brown rice for jasmine rice.  Will definitely be adding this recipe to our repertoire.
