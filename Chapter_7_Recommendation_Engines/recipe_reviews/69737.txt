I checked out the reviews for this recipe before attempting to make them and made a few adjustments. I changed teh flour to 1 full cup,3 eggs and only 3/4 cup of water. it made a stiffer dough and I was able to roll it out instead of dropping the dough into the oil. I also chilled it for an hour before kneading it on a floured surface then cutting out the donuts. My family loved them and they were gone in a few hours.

I made the batter up for Sunday morning Breakfast.  I decided to try just one small one and fried it up.  It was good.  I know this is a recipe my boys will enjoy over and over.  I used a white cake mix.  But I know I will try spice cake and carrot cake mixes.  Thanks for a quick and easy recipe.  Took only 5 minutes to prepare the batter.  After reading the other reviews I would have to say that they were a little oily.  I did make a small teaspoon sized one.  Having them that small only took about 2 - 3 minutes once the oil was hot.  Cook them on medium high.  You will want to drain them well.  I would put them in a bag of cinnamon sugar and shake well after draining them.  I will make this again when wanting to give the boys a quick and easy treat.

I wish the reviews were posted before I made these!!  We must've all gotten this recipe at the same time.  These turn out JUST as the other users said.  OILY, HEAVY, YUCKY, a waste of time and ingredients!  Don't bother.

I think the reason people are not liking this is due to their own lack of knowledge on oil temps when frying. When temperature of oil is too low the batter will absorb the oil. I made these just a few minutes  ago and they were YUMMY. I did add additional flour, 3 eggs and 3/4 cup water as suggested in earlier review.  Thank you for easy recipe for cake donuts!

Do to the review I made the suggested changes (1c. flour, 3 eggs, 3/4c. water) and they came out great. I was scared as I did not want oil soaked donuts so I used a thermometer to make sure the oil was hot enough.

This was such a let down.  I was so excited to make the funnel cakes with this recipe.  It soaked up so much grease--a heart attack waiting to happen!  Of course topped with a pile of powdered sugar, the kids were willing to eat, but neither my husband nor I could eat them.

NO STARS BUT WOULD NOT LET ME RATE WITHOUT.  There must be a mistake in the recipe.  The batter was so thin there was no way to use a scoop to put it in fryer. Added a lot more flour but then they did not have much flavor.

This was my first attempt. And I read a lot of recipes and the reviews. I did make the adjustments (1 cup flour, 3/4 water, and I used two egg yolks and 1 whole egg... I also added nutmeg. I used a devils food cake mix. The batter was thick and sticky. I got the oil super hot. I dint have the thermometer. And I used a cookie press to drop the dough into the oil... It worked ok... Made things uniform, but not thick enough for them to be tasty and moist... The tablespoon versions were better, but I couldn't leave them too long because it seemed like they were burning (oh I used a lot more than 3 cups of oil... ) when I pulled them out they were still 
raw in the center, but they kept cooking as they cooled and were ok 
when my husband grabbed one and popped it into his mouth before I 
could yell no! It's raw! The flavor was a little better on t he bigger 
ones... But not a strong chocolate. This was an easy lead in idea... 
But the recipe as is... I am not sure how successful I would've been without all the research I did prior and the trial and error with the 
cooking. At the end of it... Will I make this again? Yes. Because there 
Are many options and ways to enhance it and start to finish it was a 
quick process (not counting all the time for actually cooking- which is 
tedious dropping batter and flipping. it does move quickly- but my 
donuts were hole sized.) With the oil at the right temp these were a 
light or 'fluffy' instant cake donuts... and not greasy.

DO NOT USE THIS RECIPE  the only way to make it work is to thicken the batter with flour i also added more vanilla extract and sugar because the flour takes away the flavor of the cake mix even then they still aren't to good the easiest way to make quick donuts at home is definitely using refridgerated biscuits can't go wrong with them because this is a waste of perfectly good cake mix

Yuck! I tried this recipe and they came out drenched in oil and tasting like the oil. Not very good. I only made about a dozen, and was able to salvage the rest of the mixture for cupcakes (375 degrees for 15-18 mins. - made 18 cupcakes w/ remaining mixture), which did turn out very good! No need for icing!

I used strawberry cake mix and used a doughnut shaped muffin pan.  It turned out OK but I may add more flower to the second batch to make it more dense like a cake doughnut. I also may try a glaze instead of powdered sugar.

I followed the suggestion from one of the reviewers and used one full cup of flour, three eggs and 3/4 cup of water and they came out delicious and i used a Banana supreme cake mix. They aren't as greasy as some people said.

I have a high tech fryer and even with the oil hot enough these "donuts" were sponges, sucking up oil.

I waited until a snow day to try this recipe and I read reviews first. 1/2 c. of flour, 2 eggs (I knew I could add an egg or 2 if I needed) and 3/4 c. of water was what I ended up with. I scooped with a small cookie scoop and I found that the holes flipped on their own. Keeping the oil at low medium heat allowed the holes to cook in about a minute each. I had to move fast.

This was such a disapointment...these did not turn out at all. They were soaked with grease and didn't look or taste like any donut I've ever had before.I used the rest of the batter to make muffins ..they are in the oven now ...I hope they turn out so it's not a complete waste.

Gr8 recipe, just don't fret when you see a cake-like batter instead of a dough-like batter.  The doughnuts came out in interesting shapes which excited the children even more.

I read the reviews before making these and made the same adjustments: 1 cup flour, 3/4 cup water and 3 eggs. They came out wonderful! I used a box of funfetti cake mix so no additional sugar was needed. I made sure the oil was up to temp before I started dropping them in. Simply delicious!

Used my fry daddy to get the oil hot enough to keep the donuts from absorbing so much oil. I made the recipe as is, but next time, I'll use the 3 egg, 1c flour and 3/4 water suggestion. My oldest liked these with a smathering of Nutella on top. :)

I couldn't find the right size cake mix (they must have shrunk 'em!), so I used a 15.25oz one and reduced the recipe to 3 eggs and used 1 cup of buttermilk in place of the water.  I kept the flour amount the same and the consistency was perfect.  I found them to be wonderfully, sweet, buttery and not too dense.  They reminded me of buttermilk drop doughnuts from McKenzie's bakery in New Orleans.  Making sure the oil is the right temperature is crucial to get the wonderfully golden, crispy exterior and a moist, tender middle.

Not good at all!  I made cupcakes with the rest of the batter as well.
