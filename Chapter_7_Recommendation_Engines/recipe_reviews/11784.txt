This recipe has potential but is only worth 3 stars as written. Here are my tips: 1) Use more garlic 2) Use half the butter 3) Add a little white wine 4)  Stir-fry the broccoli with the garlic and tomatoes - that way it won't get overcooked 5) Top with Parmesan for serving. Now, you will have a delicious dish. =)

This recipe is only about 3 stars as is, but 5 with some changes. I marinated the shrimp in kosher salt, black pepper, Italian seasonings, onion powder, minced garlic and olive oil overnight. I grilled the shrimp on an indoor grill and set to the side. Saut√©ed a pack  of frozen broccoli in butter, added minced garlic, black pepper, onion powder and a can of tomatoes for 5 minutes. I used lightly buttered Chinese lo mein noodles, too. YUM YUM!!

Thanks to all the reviews. I followed the advice of several. I tossed my shrimp in basil, oregano, red and black pepper, and salt
I had some fresh asparagus that needed to be used. Saute the broccoli,asparagus, 1 large mushroom, lots of garlic, and jar of fire roasted peppers, plus the can of tomatoes, not drained. To this I added a few more dashes of red pepper flakes because it seemed bland. After about 5 minutes, I added the shrimp and it was truly delicious.Don't forget to add some white wine when you put shrimp into the skillet. Will definitely make this dish again.

Delicious recipe!  I made it twice in one week because we liked it so much.  I did change it slightly by adding more garlic and I tossed the shrimp in basil, red pepper flakes and oregano before adding it to the frying pan.

I made this a couple years ago (using this site) and am about to make it again tonight! I forgot to rate it before, but it is yummy! I'll serve it with some sort of fruit to round out the meal.

I liked this dish a lot. Something different from our regular nightly routine. I think the recipe is mis-quoted on the tomato quantity. That would be a TOMATO stir fry and you wouldn't see or taste anything else. I used one 8.5 oz jar and it was great. I'd suggest adding a little more shrimp if you want a meat-ier dish, but it is still good. I am not giving this 5 STARS because there is a BIG problem when you put this all together. You end up with a large pile of pasta and all of the other ingredients don't "mix" with the rest. I'd suggest either leaving a tablespoon or so of the water you boiled the pasta in with the pasta after you drain it (a friend told me this would work but I haven't tried it) OR take the easy way and just don't mix it all in. Serve up the bowl of pasta and the top it with the shrimp/tomato mixture. This tasted really good but presentation was off.

This was good.  I added sliced mushrooms.  Also I used way more garlic than called for.  I don't consider 1/2 tsp to be anywhere near enough garlic for a dish to be called "scampi".  Added some white wine while cooking the garlic and mushrooms.  This needed a bit of pasta water at the end to moisten it up a bit.  I'll probably make it again, but next time with less oil and butter.

This dish looks great to the eye.  It does lack flavor and you need to be careful not to overcook the broccoli.  We tried to add extra garlic plus added parsley, lemon peel, pepper and green onion and still felt it lacked something.

Take the advice of previous reviews and you can add a star--add white wine, more garlic, and red pepper flakes. I also seasoned the shrimp, but I used pre-cooked shrimp and sprinkled an herb seasoning on them with some lemon juice before I added them to the mixture at the end just to get them hot. And I sauteed the brocolli in the pan with the oil, garlc and sun-dried tomatoes instead of boiling it with the pasta. I used rice noodles as did someone else because I am gluten-intolerant. (I used 8oz which was way too much.) I have to agree with the review that it does not mix well. You are better off preparing the pasta and making it the base (mix in some liquid from the sauteed brocolli, garlic and sun-dried tomatoes to flavor the pasta), and then top with the shrimp, brocolli and tomato mix. Serve it on a big platter and it makes a great presentation. Top it off with black pepper and parmesan cheese and it is a winner! (I am also lactose intolerant so this was a big plus for me.)

I made some modifications based on others' reviews, and I thought this dish was very tasty!  I used 4 cloves garlic, only half a stick of butter (it didn't look like this would be enough, but it was plenty and did not make the pasta greasy), added some dried oregano, salt, pepper, and onion powder, and 8 oz sliced mushrooms.  I also topped it with lots of freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese.  I liked it very much!  I will make it again.

This was so simple to throw together and we all loved it! I don't like boiled broccoli so I cooked the broccoli in the saute pan, adding it before the shrimp. I used elbow pasta just because that's what I had in the house.

Very good!  I used Jumaha's suggestions - stir frying the broccoli with the tomatoes, adding more garlic, using half the butter and adding some white wine.  It went together quickly when I had all ingredients ready to go and was well liked by all.

This is a good dish, and a complete meal with some fruit. I cut way back on the butter, adding some olive oil instead. I used an extra clove of garlic, salt and pepper.  I find it easier to just cook the broccoli with the garlic and shrimp. We eat this with shredded parmesan sprinkled on top. It's quite an easy meal to make, besides cutting up broccoli.  I have made this several times already, and will make it again.

Good recipe, but added some white wine and reduced butter as some of the reviews recommended.  Also added some feta cheese just before serving.  Quick and easy to prepare, will make this again.

Jan 12,2010  Laura My husband & I really liked this recipe.  I used more extra virgin olive oil than butter, added some lemon, and cooked the broccoli in with the shrimp. I used frozen broccoli as I didn't have any fresh, it worked fine.

I really wanted to like this, but it simply didn't work for me. Maybe I did something wrong, but the flavors didn't meld togather very well. The shrimp tasted awesome, but the pasta and the broccoli were bland.

Sun dried tomatoes made this recipe stand out, a nice zippy taste.  This recipe is very good as written. Unusual technique!  I was halving the recipe but wasn't precise.  Good recipe for additions and substitutions in veges and other fish to taste.

This was pretty good.  I made a couple of changes; mixed the broccoli with some olive oil and plenty of Old Bay and roasted it in the oven.  I also mixed the shrimp with Old Bay and left out the butter completely.  Tasty, quick, and a nice dinner.  I do think, however, I'd have not liked all that butter so I'm glad I left it out.  Otherwise, very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Since i'm not a huge tomato fan, and wanted to keep the fat content down, I substituted sliced red green and yellow peppers. I also added some lemon juice and extra garlic. Cooked it in a wok also so some of the butter burned off and added a little white wine.  A nice, light, quick recipe.

Thanks to all of the reviewers, this dish was a five star for me!!! I added more garlic, sauteed the broccoli and added some white wine at the end and it was FANtastic!! I even left out the butter to be healthier and it was still that good! I also served it over rice pilaf which is always my route with a scampi--it seems to soak the sauce better and everything gets really happy together! YUM!

Good recipe.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, fresh basil, salt, and pepper and sauteed them with the sundried tomatoes.  Instead of broccoli, I used asparagus and cooked it with the shrimp.   Added fresh lemon juice and parmesean cheese just before serving.  My 12 year old son and husband loved it.

This is great.  It is colorful and something a little different for when guests come over.  I do a few minor adjustments such as using spinach for the broccoli and adding more garlic

I rated this recipe 5 stars but I followed the recipe that DChrissy gave. I also drizzed the oil that was left in the pan from sauteeing the broccoli, tomatoes and the shrimp and that made the pasta have a little sauce. I also didn't mix the shrimp and pasta together I just put the pasta on the plate and then on top I put the shrimp mixture.

This was a hit! I changed up the recipe quite a bit...I used penne pasta, olive oil instead of butter and shrimp and fresh crab. I would definitely make this again. I am having leftovers for lunch today!

I loved this recipe.  It had few ingredients which makes it fast and easy to make.  I added crushed red pepper in end, which helped spice it up a little bit.

I really liked this recipe.  It didn't take a lot of prep time and I had most of the ingredients on hand without having to make a trip to the store.  I didn't have angel hair pasta so I used farfalle (bow ties). I sprinkled a three cheese blend (parmesan, romano and asiago)on top just before serving.  I think the leftovers will be equally tasty served cold as a refresing summer salad.

Ok, but boring!!  I read over the reviews and made the following changes: 5 cloves garlic, 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, approx 3/4 cup white wine, omitted the butter, sauted the broccoli & shrimp in the sauce.. added some parsley, salt and pepper.   Still bland - in hopes of giving some flavor i squeezed in 1/4 lemon and added garlic powder. Tossed with a heavier pasta (strozzapreti) and added fresh shaved asiago.   End result: it was ok. It was quick but it was bland. I will not be making this again. Kinda a waste of sun dried tomatoes and shrimp.

6 jars of sun dried tomatoes are expensive - each jar is about 6 dollars where I live , so I substituted 4 jars with sun dried tomatoes.  It just tasted very plain and oily.  However, my wife sort of liked it, I did not.  Not worth the effort and $$$

Simple and delicious!  Instead of broccoli florets I spiralized 2 stalks and cooked it with thin whole wheat spaghetti - also cut back a little on the butter and used probably 4x the garlic

I followed the other reviewers' suggestions and marinated the shrimp in  Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes,  and whatever else was around.  I boiled the pasta in half water, half veggie broth.  I sauteed everything else together and added the cooked pasta to the pan of everything to serve.  It was so delicious, we all had two servings.

The recipe provided good ideas so I rated it 4*, but it would have fallen short of 5* without my enhancements.  I doubled the shrimp to a full pound and quadrupled the garlic.  After cleaning the shrimp, I boiled the shrimp shells in 1 Cup water and 1/2 Cup of white wine until the shells turned pink; after removing the shells I reduced the fluid to about 2 Tablespoons.  I blanched the broccoli in the salted pasta water for 3 minutes then removed and drained the broccoli; added more salt before cooking the pasta as directed on the package.  I added 1t chili flakes to the diced sun-dried tomatoes before sauteing them.  I followed the directions for cooking the garlic, sun-dried tomatoes and shrimp, then added the reduced shrimp broth and blanched broccoli to the pan when the shrimp was about 2/3 cooked.  I added salt and pepper to the shrimp.  Once the pasta was finished, after draining it well, I added the pasta to the shrimp and tossed it until the butter broth was absorbed by the pasta.  After plating the pasta, I sprinkled Parmesan cheese across the top.  With my enhancements, the dish turned out great!

The flavors of this dish were amazing. I'm not really a big fan of sundried tomatoes, but it worked really well in this! A couple tips--it's okay to use slightly less butter, what they ask for in the recipe is a LOT. I would definitely up the garlic you use--I used about 8x the amount said and it was perfect (but I love garlic so use at your own risk). And if I were to do it all over again, I would add a small can of tomato sauce, just to get that spaghetti sauce feeling. It was a little dry when placed on the noodles. Without the extra sauce, I would say that the shrimp would be best on a salad rather than in a pasta. Still worth a try!

I liked the idea of mixing broccoli and sun dried tomatoes with the basic scampi.  I steamed the broccoli  for 2 minutes and cooked it with the rest of the ingredients.  I added a lot more garlic and seasoning, oregano, basil, paprika and crushed red pepper.  I also put a generous helping of fresh grated  Parmesan over everything.  And I added some fresh squeezed lemon juice.
Turned out very good.

With a few modifications this recipe is Excellent. I wanted a dish that was full of veggies and I wanted to use up as many things that I already had around the kitchen. I decreased the butter to 1 tbsp., I increased the amount of ingredients in the recipe and used 1 heaping cup of lightly drained sun-dried tomatoes, 3 cups broccoli florets, 4 cloves of minced garlic. I added 1 can of petite diced tomatoes in juices, 8oz sliced fresh mushrooms, added 1 1/2 tbsp. of dried basil, and seasoned with seasoning salt, garlic powder, crushed red pepper and black pepper. And since I did not have angel hair pasta on hand, used linguini. DH and I loved it!

This is a fabulous and easy recipe!  My future mother in law is a really great cook, and the first time I cooked her dinner, I made her this, and she loved it.  Cooking it in the sun dried tomato oil gives a really great flavor.

This recipe had way too many tomatoes for our taste, and I added more garlic and basil.  Beside that, it turned out great
