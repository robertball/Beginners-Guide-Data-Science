Yummy and easy. The kids liked it too. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic and dried basil to the potatoes. Seperatly I cooked chicken breast, then served it together. The chicken is wonderful with the sauce.

Delicious! I did slice up a yellow onion and added that to it, along with 4 cloves of minced garlic. I also roasted it an extra 10 minutes before adding the sauce and cheese. Very filling side dish! I served it with breaded pork tenderloin and salad. YUM.

Very good and I always love trying new potato recipes. I doubled the salt and still put more on once on my plate.  Maybe I am a saltaholic or did anyone else find 1/4 tsp. salt not enough?

I added cooked italian sausage to this and made it an all in one meal - everyone in my house loved it and it was easy to throw together after work.
