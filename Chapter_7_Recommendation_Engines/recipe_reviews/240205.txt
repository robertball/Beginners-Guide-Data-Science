This is the second time loving this pie!The only thing I changed was 1/2 cup brown sugar in place of white sugar. 1 Tbs of flour for a stiffer pie. Also homemade  pie crust.. more spices. Off the hook!

My fianc√© is a chef and he loves it, everyone give this recipe a shot you won't be at all displeased. FYI this mixture gave me 3 deep dish pies

Best Sweet Potato Pie I have ever had.  I followed the recipe except: I did use a heaping teaspoon of vanilla extract and only about 6 oz of 2% milk (by accident, but it worked).  Whipped mixture in a food processor.  Made just two pies.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this recipe and the only thing I did differently was add the cinnamon/nutmeg/sugar to my liking ,  I also used a mixture of white and brown sugar.
...but overall it was a wonderful pie...the texture of the pie was perfect.  I will definitely use this one again.

This was, without a doubt, the absolute best sweet potato pie I have ever had!  

With so many sweet potato pie recipes out there, if you've never made one, it's hard to know which recipe to choose.  Well, look no further - this is definitely the one to make!

It does make 3 pies, so get ready to have some pie!  I made the pies for Thanksgiving and brought one to a family get-together, one to a friend get-together, and one to stay at my house.  I got rave reviews from everyone and personally thought it was fantastic.   Absolutely delicious!

*FINALLY GOT IT RIGHT*
Unfortunately my sweet potato pies always turned out less than successful.. However I followed this recipe adding a swig more  vanilla, brown sugar, cinnamon and I used heavy cream instead of evaporated milk.
 My family's response had me blushing..
Definitely a Keeper

Thanks

This pie has a slight custard-like  texture. I added ginger and cinnamon. It could be a little sweeter. Overall a good recipe. Makes 2 pies.

No significant changes because I wanted to see how this pie recipe  worked the first time around...boy oh boy, my husband loves this and he thinks it's even better than my pumpkin pie (what does HE know ;-).  Honestly, have to say it's the best I've tasted and I'm not going to change a thng!

My family said it was good but not sweet enough. Thought it was too thick. It was not as good as  the one I make.
