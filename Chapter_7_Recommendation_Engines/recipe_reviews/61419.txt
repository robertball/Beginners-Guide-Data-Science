I just made a couple of changes. Instead of the egg and flour mixture (some comments said it was to thick) I mixed some dijon mustard with some honey and coated the pork chops in that before dipping them in the pecan mixture. I fried lightly in olive oil and then since I don't have an oven proof skillet, I moved them to a glass casserole that I sprayed with pam. So delicious! Whole family loved it.

As the other reviews mentioned the recipe needing something sweet, I decided to mix in some brown sugar with the pecan mixture. They turned out perfectly!

Very good!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added some brown sugar to the pecans.  Wow!  We loved it!  I also had some eggbeaters to use up, so used that instead of real eggs.  I don't know if that changed anything or not.  We will have these again!

I make this at home except I mix together a dijon mustsard/mayo/olive oil sauce I coat the chops in first and instead of using flour- I use a bread slice and my food processor- the dijon mixture make the chops so juicy and loads and loads of flavor- try it out!!!

This was delicious! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and added 2 tspns of brown sugar. If the original recipes called for a sweet ingredient like brown sugar or honey I would have given it 5 stars.

I totally agree that this recipe needs something sweet. But, instead of adding it directly to the meat, I made a cherry demi-glaze to pour on top of the pork chop. Delicious! Just reduce 2 cups of beef broth down to 1 cup. Add 1 cup of good red wine and a big handful of dried cherries, salt & pepper. Then reduce this more. You can make this ahead or have it reducing while you prepare the pork chop. What a delicious meal this is with the demi-glaze!

my family and i decided that the chops were 'different' even though the recipe sounded absolutely delicious - which is why i gave it a try. i think it was missing something sweet. the addition of honey or maple syrup would make this recipe work a lot better.

Super simple and very tasty. I also added brown sugar to the pecan mixture and I thought that made a positive impact on the overall flavor. My husband and I both thought that it could still use a little more flavor though so next time I will make a fruit compote to go with it.

Other than plain old scrambled eggs, this is the first thing I've ever cooked, period.  I DO NOT COOK.  I thought I was going to totally screw this up, and instead, they were terrific!  If I can make this turn out great, anybody can.  The only problem i had was that the pecans are already oily, and the recipe calls for a buttered frying pan... kind of greasy.    I served it with a dab of apricot preserves... yummy!  my dad and my boyfriend both loved it.

I have had pecan crusted fish before, but this is the first time trying it on pork chops. The breading just came out too thick. We didn't really like the flavor. Sorry!

So after reading previous reviews I took their advice.  I used Dijon mustard and real maple syrup instead of the flour/egg mix.  I did fry in butter because there are just some times that using real butter adds a flavor you can't get with olive oil. I also had to "hold" dinner until everyone was here so I fried them and then let them sit, covered, on the stove.  Popped into the oven when we were ready.  They turned out perfect!  So moist and delicious.  This one got RAVE reviews from the family.  This is going to become a staple in our house.

I'm sorry, but this just did not turn out well at all.  The pecans scorched very easily, and the burnt flavor was not pleasant.  It sounded so good too.

BEST PORK CHOPS I EVER MADE! I tenderized the foool out of them with my multi-blade tenderizing gadget and added a little cajun seasoning to the pecans instead of salt and pepper.  I then made a sauce by deglazing the pan with a little chicken broth and then mixed in 1 cup of fat free evap. milk and 2 TBS coarse dijon mustard. I simmered it (do not boil) until thick. Absolutely tender, flavorful and delicious!

I wanted to love this, but the only flavor I could taste was pecans-couldn't even taste pork.  Maybe grinding the nuts up superfine and using less of them might help?  It does call for an awful lot of pecans.  Maybe salt and pepper the pork itself instead of mixing the S&P with the nuts?  And maybe adding another layer of flavors?

It was alright....you really need to mince the pecans finely or else it will overpower all taste.  It is missing something sweet, i think a bit of honey would do this recipe wonders....I do have to say it was very quick and easy....

After i toasted the pecans, i put them in a food processor and chopped them up really fine. That worked excellently. I highly disagreed with the suggestion to take them out when they were a light pink in the middle, i like mine a little bit more done than that, i like them white in the middle. I took them out anyway and followed the recipe perfectly because i didn't want to burn the pecans like you suggested. In any case, i would have liked the pork chops to be done a little more. I was really hoping this would have came out better than it did, it definitely sounded good.
