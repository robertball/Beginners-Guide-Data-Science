I love this recipe due to the basic ingredients. IT's scrumptious and my entire family asks for it more often than anyother dessert.

375 is way too high a temp for this recipe.  I burned two pies after only 30 minutes (on Christmas morning no less).  Maybe 350 would do it.  Also, all the raisins end up clumped together if you simply pour the mixture into the crust.  You should carefully spread them around or they'll all end up in the middle bottom of the pie.  The flavor was okay but the consistency was a bit stodgy and it was too sweet.  I'd omit the the sugar or half the syrup.  I also added a teaspoon of ginger and vanilla which deepened the flavors some.  Finally I'd add more nuts - the recipe as written makes for a gooey pie filling and it needed more body.  I think next time I'll use whole or half walnuts/pecans /hazelnuts and add double the amount.

Fantastic for the holidays or all winter! I was able to add 2/3 cup of fresh cranberries and a little more walnuts without over-filling it at all.

absolutely delicious. took it to a potluck, best dessert there. i added more walnuts, fresh organic from WF, makes a difference. now my favorite dessert. very rich with the walnuts, butter and corn syrup, but omg. easy to make.
