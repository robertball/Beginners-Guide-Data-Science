WOW!!!!! WOW!!!!WOW!!!
This recipe is Awsome..
The only thing that I did different was to Add 1 oz. of the Anise Extract.
We like our cookies a little stronger flavor...
My husband was eating them as fast as I could get them off the cookie sheet..
I frosted them with  White Frosting from the can that I bought from the store and flavored it a little with the anise oil...
They were so good.. 
This is a keeper... I will be making these all the time.. They turn out so pretty.. They are going to look nice on a cookie try.. 
Thanks so much for sharing your recipe with us.. 
It's wonderful.
I can't wait to make a cup of tea and have cookie's..

I had been baking an anise cookie recipe for years when this year (2 batches) there was a terrible after taste.  I found Louise's recipe quick, easy and delicious!  This will be replacing my old recipe!

these are the closest thing to a Stella Doro both in taste and texture that you can find!  This is just such an excellent cookie to add to a holiday cookie bake.  I love the fact that they are just perfectly sweet.  These are not a cake like cookie, but just like a stella doro due to the baking powder.  They do not spread and therefore can get alot on one sheet.  I didn't have anise extract so ground 4 tsp. of anise seed in my coffee grinder and it was just perfect!  I think I would prefer the real anise seed anyway.  Nice to get a little crunch of a seed for a burst of anise flavor.  Thank you for this lovely cookie as a great addition to my holiday trays!
UPDATE 12/23/10  I just have to say that these are so wonderful. I make them every year and just took a batch out of the oven. again, i use extra fennel/anise seed that I grind in my grinder as well as a bit of anise extract.  I also use parchment paper. makes alot and u can't stop eating them!

I wanted a soft anise cookie and this recipe filled the bill! My family loves them and I will add this recipe to my "must bake" list ever Christmas! I frost them with an anise frosting.

We made these tonight & liked how quick & easy they were. We are going to try them with different flavorings such as almond, rum, etc. Also love the texture, as well.

These came out good, though the 8-10 minute baking time was not long enough. (Maybe I made the cookies too big?)  Also, the # of eggs seemed to make them heavier than other, similar cookies. I was looking for a whiter, lighter cookie. That said, my family liked them ...

These cookies were nice and light. I frosted them with a sweet glaze flavored with anise. Next time I will definitely add at least a tablespoon of anise extract, but a great cookie.

I  thought the anise flavoring wasn't strong enough, and the cookie wasn't sweet enough for me. I would definitely add more anise favoring or seeds.  I did one pan full by rolling in raw sugar and that turned out really good. Another review said she did an anise glaze and I will do that also.

An excellent cooky, not too sweet.   The only changes I made was to add more anise extract, 1 tbsp. and even then the flavor was mild, and to bake them longer, 13 - 14 minutes.

Love how easy this recipe is! It’s a great dough to work with! The only thing I would change is to make sure your eggs are at room temperature. I wasn’t thinking and used them straight from the fridge and it wouldn’t cream smoothly with the shortening, it made the shortening too cold. Great cookies, I will definitely be adding to my cookie list!!

I recommend using half the amount of baking powder because that seemed way too much baking powder for the amount of flour.  Also, if you like a prominent anise flavor I would double the amount of extract.  IMHO, with those changes, this would be a five star recipe.

I’ve been looking for an Anise cookie for a long time.  It was always on the Italian cookie trays I grew up around.  This recipe in great.  I was a little heavier on the anise extract.  I also piped the cookie through a frosting bag without a tip, just to a different shape to my Christmas cookies this year.  Just before baking I sprinkled sugar over the top and gently pat each cookie.  When they were done, each cookie had a great anise aroma and taste and that sugar added a light sweet crunch.  Delicious

Because I didn’t have anise extract I substituted 2 teaspoons  arak or anisette plus I added 6 teaspoons anise seeds. They definitely got a thumbs up.

Not what I was expecting........a little dry but maybe after they set awhile the anise flavour will come through. Easy enough to put together

I made frosting and added anise extract. Topped cookies with sprinkles.  Everyone loved them. I'll be adding them to my Christmas party list.
