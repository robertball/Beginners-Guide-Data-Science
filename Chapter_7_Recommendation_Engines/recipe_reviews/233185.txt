I had left-over carrots and mushrooms and needed to do something with them that was Asian in influence since I was serving sweet & sour chicken (of sorts). Turned out that I didn't have the snow peas or brown sugar, but it was light & tasty anyways. It was also very easy to make. Since I made in my toaster oven while my chicken baked, I had to do it in two batches. For the second batch, I just mixed the wet ingredients with the dry until I could pop them in to bake. I actually think that marinating the veggies in the liquid made it a little more flavorful. I will do this next time.

The veggies come out crisp and delicious. My kids devour this and it has become one of their favorites.  I used ginger paste to make this even more simple. I serve this as a side with the Asian pork tenderloin on this site.
