I really liked this.  We don't have fresh cactus in Australia so I used canned, tasted great.  Very refreshing, excellent with chicken.

excellent salsa. i like mine with a lot more kick so i added some Poblano and Bhut Jolokia for a lot more kick. Don't try that at home.

I really like this unique salsa.  It is slightly tangy, slightly sweet, a bit spicy and savory.  Used what I had so changed it some.  Tomatillos from the garden (1 cup), 1 1/4 cup diced tomatoes, 1/3 c onion, 3 garlic cloves, juice of 1/2 lime (3.5T), 1/2 bunch of chopped cilantro (~1/2 c), 1 jalapeno b/c the whole family will eat it if its not too spicy, + salt and pepper.  Didn't have the cactus and don't know what it tastes like so I didn't miss it.  Really tasty!

A pleasant change from the normal salsas. Now all I have to do is convince the kids and grand kids that we are going to have a taco bar at Christmas.
