These were pretty good. I happen to love A1 so they I knew I couldn't go wrong with this one. I didn't use the peppers and onions on mine, but I enjoyed the burger anyway and topped it with more A1 on a toasted onion bun since Kaiser rolls are hard to find here.

I've made the same thing with London Pub sauce, Heinz 57 sauce, and even catsup (but that's more like meatloaf).  A-1, which I've only been eating for 50 years, is probably still the all-round best.

Burgers are excellent like this, although I hadn't tried it with the peppers before.  Awesome.  =)  I like to add a touch of garlic powder to the meat mixture, too.
