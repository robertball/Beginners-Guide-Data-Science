This was a VERY delicious recipe! I didn't use any bell peppers or the chicken liver(we don't like) and I used cream of mushroom instead of chicken. I also used milk instead of water with the soup and it is definately a keeper. This was the very first time that I have made stuffed chicken and this recipe was quite easy! My husband actually asked for seconds...which isn't too often..LOL
Thanks for sharing this great recipe!!

Hi, I'm Carina, the author of this recipe, and just wanted to say that I made it this weekend with a little cooked bulk Italian sausage in place of the chicken livers, and it was a nice change and still very tasty!

This was a pretty good recipe. I didn't have green pepper and did not use chicken livers. The chicken was tender and the stuffing was moist. Thanks!

This was a hit with my family and mother who hates that I cook chicken so much.  I didnt have any extra cornbread on hand so I cheated and added Stove top.  I just added a half of cup more water to the directions so that it wouldnt dry out while baking.  It was a SMASH hit for the family.

This goes to the top of our families list for favorite recipes! No more boring chicken!  My husband loved this so much that after he finished his plate he walked over to the pan where a extra piece was and started eating it right out of the pan... classy, eh? He said it tasted like something from a 5 star restaurant and I thought so too.  The best thing about it is that is is super easy to make if you have cornbread on hand.  I would suggest making sweet cornbread the previous day for another dish and using the leftovers for this receipe the next day.  The only variance I made was that I tripled the garlic and cut up a whole green pepper instead of half.  I also put salt and pepper on the chicken and didn't add the sauce until 10 minutes before it was ready.  So yummy... my 9 year old loved it too!

Very good. I made substitutions for what I had on hand: Jiffy corn muffin mix, boullion that I made into broth, and omitted the peppers. I also poured Knorr gravy mix over the top instead of cream of chicken soup, as I don't like the flavor of the soup; next time I'll make a double batch of gravy, as it could have used more. Husband and I loved the flavor of the cornbread, though I substituted poultry seasoning for sage because I realized I was out of sage while cooking. Will definitely make again!

I have to say that I really do not like stuffing...however, I decided to try this for my hubby. I did cheat by using boxed cornbread stuffing and I didn't have cream of chicken soup, but did have Turkey gravy so I used it instead.  The meal smelled so good while it was cooking and then when I opened the oven door...wow!  I could not believe that I really honestly loved this recipe! Our 11 year old picky eater even snarfed down his chicken. It was so incredibly easy and delicious, I am sending it to our 20 year old son....he can even do this.  Thank you so very much for sharing this with us, will go into the families cookbook from here on out.  Oh, and my hubby LOVED it too!! Thanks again!!!

Sorry, but this is definitely not a keeper dish for me.  I might suggest after filling the chicken to brown it first.  I also added some white wine to the soup, but it still tasted like can soup over chicken to me.  Glad others like it.  (I also used some sausage like you mentioned) and still no help for me.

This recipe turned out really well! The chicken was very moist and it tasted like a southern comfort food. My husband loved it and asked me to add it to our "rotation"!

This was a taste dish. The chicken was moist and tender. The stuffing flavorful and crisp. It was really great to sit down to this recipe after a 12-hour shift. Sides we used were corn and mashed garlic potatoes. I bet some cranberry would be good here as well.

This was wonderful!  I used cornbread croutons (maybe that's what's meant by bread crumbs?) and used celery instead of green peppers and used milk instead of water to mix with the soup.  I will definitely be making this again!  Thank you!

The cornbread dressing tasted great! Next time I'll double the recipe just to have a bit more on the side of the chicken.

I made this last night and it took well over an hour to cook and when I took it out, it still wasn't done.  I would make this again but cook it at 400 for 1 hour covered and then uncover it for 10 minutes. Other than that, it was really good. I left out chicken livers and used stovetop stuffing.

This recipe was about what I expected so I wasn't disappointed or really to  impressed.  I love the flavors of poultry, sage and cornbread and this fulfilled all of that.  What I experienced was mushy stuffing, which is what I expected because it has happened with pork chops as well.  I prefer a crispier dressing/stuffing than what you can achieve with this without overcooking the meat.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand.....I added chopped orange peppers in addition to the green for color (would have added pimentos if I'd had them for the same reason) and used Culinary Broth White Wine and Herb Broth.  I omitted the chicken soup because I don't care for can soup as a gravy and I didn't think with the herb broth it would have paried very well.  Family enjoyed and said they'd like to have again so I'm sure I'll use this again maybe just as baked chicken breast with stuffing on the side.  Served with cranberry sauce and fresh green beans.

I cut the servings size in half for two people. This was just what I wanted, moist tender chicken with wonderful stuffing you don't spend hours on. Saute'd the onion w/celery & red bell pepper. Also used poultry seasoning w/sage. I will double the stuffing portion next time and decrease cream of mushroom soup w/milk. I steamed brocolli w/ salt and pepper and olive oil as a side dish. Excellent dinner...thank you Carina.

This is a great recipe. It was so good! I changed a few things after reading some of the reviews. I did not use the chicken liver, green pepper, or sage. I substituted a jar of turkey gravy for the soup. I also used a box of stove top stuffing instead of the corn bread. This worked out well. It was great leftover too.

I feel guilty, because I changed this recipe so much.  I used leftover holiday stuffing from my freezer, and mixed turkey gravy in with the cream of chicken soup. It was delicious :)

This is a really great recipe, I do have to say I cheated and used a box stuffing and it was really good.  My Husband loved it and it is great for something different.

Great and easy to follow recipe. I only had a Jiffy Box on hand and next time I am going to use leftover made from scratch cornbread instead. I also left out the bell peppers and livers. Oh and milk instead of water for the dressing. Thanks for sharing!

This is my go to recipe for when I am craving cornbread stuffing! I have made this recipe several times and everyone always loves it, even my 2 year old.(I use the cornbread muffins from the bakery in Publix and omit the chicken livers.) I also used the stuffing for pork tenderloins and just as a side dish.

It was outstanding! I took some of the tips from the others and added my own.  I added mushrooms (fresh) to the saute of onions/green peppers. Also, added Italian Sausage, chicken livers are out, not much maybe over a 1/4#. With the chicken breast I browned them in olive oil and add a sprinkle of Italian Seasonings, they were not large enough to stuff so I layered them. Stuffing, chicken breast and more stuffing. Cream of Chicken soup with milk not water. I agree with others, the sage is the key.

Along with it was mashed rutabaga, green salad and home canned cranberries. It was like a Thanksgiving meal, my gal who canned the cranberries said it was the best meal from this site she has ever had. 

It was quick and easy, and next time will try turkey breast.  Oh, one last thing, I used Jiffy cornbread mix, made it ahead as a Johnny Cake and then after cooling, crumbled it. One box was the perfect amount.

This is a must-make! I was making dinner for a bunch of my husbands coworkers, so I made a thanksgiving feast, with this as the main dish. Sooo good, a yummy southern twist on chicken. Super moist and sweet. Great with green bean casserole.

I tried this recipe the other night for dinner and it was an ABSOLUTE HIT, I was lucky I even got to have any!!!! My 7 year old daughter who doesn't even eat stuffing, had 2 servings and before dinner was even over she was asking when I was gonna make it again. There was only a couple things I didnt use which was the bell peppers and the sage because we don't eat them, perfect without it. This will DEFINETLY be a recipe we add to our dinner menu.

Love the recipe! Been doing this one for years now. I never do the chicken liver but its a great meal to make, especially for a holiday or special occassion. Takes a bit of prep time but the outcome is worth it, a winner every time! The presentation makes it a classy meal to share with loved ones and gives the illusion that its much harder to put together than it really is.

This dish turned out excellent.  I loved the cornbread dressing.  My picky little eaters also enjoyed it.  I did put cream of mushroom soup on top because I didn't have cream of chicken, but it turned out great!! Thanks for sharing:)
