I made a big vanilla ice cream four layer tube cake and poured the boozy bananas over the top and lit it on fire for a party. Not only was it a show stopper but such a great tasting uncomplicated dessert. *If you want to flame this in front of guests, heat a little booze over the stove before pouring it on. Cold booze won't ignite very well.

I have made this recipe twice the first time just like the directions and then the second time like a friend of mine told me to do it. The other way to do it is to heat the butter and sugar is a small pan, once melted add the bananas. Constantly stir the mixture until the bananas are heated thru. At the last minute put in the alcohol. When doing this I find that you taste the alcohol a little more!

A quick and easy recipe.  Awesome with french vanilla ice cream. 
 
Once I substitued the whiskey for amaretto liqueur (Disaronno), that was delicous too. However, if you use amaretto, don't forget to change the name to italian bananas. :)

Maybe we just don't like to drink enough, but the alcohol overpowered the bananas... not the St. Patty's Day dessert we were looking for.

Very easy and delish! It is honestly better than any banana dessert I have ever had in any 5 star restaurant. I served it over Irish Tea Cake (found on this site) and vanilla ice cream. It was tremendous!

What a great idea for cooking up bananas!  Per banana, I used 1 Tbsp butter, 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 c liquor (I actually used coconut flavored rum since we had it laying around the house).  Being diabetic, I left out the extra sugar and it didn't hurt the recipe one bit.

I really liked the texture of the bananas.  The sauce was not overpowering, and was a perfect match for french vanilla ice cream!

Whiskey, dark rum, whatever ...we all get the idea.  MMmmmm!  I served this over folded crepes.  To impress your guests, you can mix in the brown sugar, then add the whiskey and set aflame.

They are really good! The first time I made them, I had the temperature too high and the sugar burnt. Ugh! The second time I was more careful and they turned out great. I had mine with a crepe and pistachio ice cream.

These are simple and delicious!  The first time I made them I looked for a small bottle of Irish whiskey and couldn't find one.  Now I'm glad because we make these a lot!  So quick you can even make them after dinner.

I have to agree that this is the best banana desert I've ever had. Though I did sub whiskey for rum since we didn't have whiskey in the house. I love it and would actually make this again in the future.

We had this for dessert on St. Pat's day...it was so good, with a scoop of Dreyer's vanilla frozen yogurt blend.  Used Bushmill's Irish whiskey, I'm not a whiskey fan, but the flavor was excellent.

Perfect ratio of liquor to sugar. Fantastic easy dessert and a good way to get rid of those bananas that are about to go and impress your guests at the same time.

I think the only thing Irish about this recipe is the whisky.  It was ok.  If you want to make it really good...sprinkle a little cinnamon and some toasted coconut over the ice cream.  We tried it with a brandy as well and just lit the thing on fire.  That was the best!!

Last minute decided to do St Patrick's Day dinner - OH MY WORD! This was amazing. I didn't add the alcohol at all. We don't drink, and my kids were going to be eating too. I made it right before dinner and dished it up then put the dishes in the freezer until we were done eating. It was cool enough for the little ones and melty enough to be amazing!

This dessert was very easy to make and was a big hit with my guests!  I cut the bananas into smaller pieces and placed each piece on top of a bite-sized piece of pound cake. I drizzled the sauce over each one and topped it off with a dab of whipped cream. I will definitely make this again.

I recently made this for some friends who really don't care for fruit in their dessert.  THEY LOVED IT!!!  The only thing I did was add blueberries, strawberries, and raspberries along with the bananas.  The flavors were awesome.  Next time I might try it with a little pineapple.

This is a favorite with my friends.  I use Kaluah instead of the Irish Whiskey (same amount) but we have named it "Bunckhouse Bananas".  Cinnamon chips with a scoop of ice cream and then topped with this is totally addicting!

Fabulous 5 star dessert I plan to serve guests.  I made it a bit better by using Splenda brown sugar and Captain Morgan's Spiced Rum instead of Irish Whiskey. GREAT recipe and SO easy!

Just served it for a potluck at work and it went over very well!!! cutting the banana in little slices (just like you would if you put them in cereal) works really well for serving over the icecream!!

I wanted something to pick my boyfriend up after a grueling day at work and this did the job beautifully. Halved the recipe using two bananas sliced longwise and then cut in half to fit a medium-sized saucepan and it worked great - I would not have wanted a smaller pan though, next time I'll probably go right for a skillet and most definitely will if I make the full amount. I detected a slight whiskey note adding it in the beginning as written, for stronger flavor I'll try adding at the end as suggested but I think this is a phenomenal dessert just as is. I only needed to cook the bananas for about 3.5 mins total flipping once, mine were a little soft to begin with though. Thanks for sharing such a simple quick and DELICIOUS dessert!

Really liked this.  Did this recipe with the bananas and it was yummy.  Next night, I wanted a simple sauce for my icecream, so I tried it without the bananas and this makes a wonderful sauce too.

I have used this web site for many years, and I have never set up a log in account until now.  This recipe was so delicious that I had to sign up just to rate this recipe.  The bananas taste perfect over the ice cream.  Just spoon a little extra sauce into your bowl before serving. My children ask for this dessert every night.  Thank you so much for sharing your recipe with all of us

To die for!!!!!!!!!!
Substituted amber rhum for the Irish whiskey as I'll drink the rhum after I make the desert but would not drink the whiskey. A decadent, sweet, EXCELLENT desert. HIGHLY recommended!

We call this "bananas foster" and usually serve it inside of a crepe. Whatever you call it, it's delicious!

Great easy and quick sauce to compliment my french toast. Used Irish whiskey as the recipe calls for. I just added a little water to thin out the sauce a bit. The whiskey is the only liquid so I didn't want to add anymore of that and get my kids drunk. lol. I also suggest putting the bananas in at the very end. The softened up quicker than expected. I would highly recommend this and will definitely be making this again.
