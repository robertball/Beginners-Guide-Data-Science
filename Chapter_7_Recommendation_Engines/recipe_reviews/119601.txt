I soaked the potatoe slices in cold water in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.  This seemed to make more crisp.  But regardless, it is a great recipe that I will definately make again!

10 stars!  I saved this recipe to my Recipe Box the other day, went to the store last night to buy potatoes and today, while "treasure hunting", found a vintage ekco french fry cutter.  Perfect!  If you don't have one of these handy tools, consider buying one as it makes short work of cutting your potatoes into the perfect french fry shape!  I just turned them over at the halfway mark and they're browing/crisping up beautifully.  I used canola oil instead of butter.  I'll be using this recipe on a regular basis as I'm already thinking about sweet potato skinny fries!  Thanks so much for posting this recipe!

I like this recipe and have used it for a long time. I use vegetable oil also, but first, I set my cut potatoes in ice for an hour, then I dry them off and put cajun seasoning on them before I cook them. They come out with some seasoning cooked into them. Then I add salt and pepper.

This was easy and very good. The only changes I made was to use olive oil to toss them in and sprinkled with seasoned salt and pepper before baking. I turned the oven up to 450 degrees after the 45 minute cook time and cooked an extra 10-15 minutes to crisp up.

Great recipe! I followed other reviewers' advice and used olive oil in place of butter and cooked them on parchment paper. I shook them 2-3 times throughout the cooking time to prevent them from sticking to each other as well. Before putting them in the oven, I tossed on some pepper and seasoning salt and they cooked up crisp, a few minutes early! I highly recommend this recipe. Make it with any seasonings you like, you can't go wrong.

Perfect.  I love the simple seasonings in this recipe of just salt and pepper, tho' any number of herbs, seasonings, or specialty salts could be used.  Because these are cut rather thin they don't take as long to bake, especially if you crank the oven up to 425* as I did. Watch the timing closely!  Simple, basic recipe with a minimum of ingredients, straightforward cooking directions, and delicious results.

Yeah, you must use olive oil. I started making these sometime back to cut down on "bad" fats. Cheap, fast and easy side too! I was trying to clone the garlic fries at Raider games. Try fresh finely minced garlic and finely minced fresh rosemary, S & P, paprika... whatever turns your crank. Even a topping of parmesan cheese.

I made some improvements but this recipe is a winner as is too.  I had some duck fat leftover from another recipe so I used that instead of butter, and added some minced garlic.  So good.

These were great. I used the butter but I also added a little bit of canola oil to help the crisp up and get the authentic french fry taste. I also tossed them in onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper BEFORE baking. Yummy! Everyone loved them.

I love fries and these are great!  I have also done these with sweet potatoes seasoned with paprika and garlic powder.  A light mayo curry dip compliments the sweet potatoes well.  I will make these fries from now on.

I made these into bite size chunks instead of fries. I ended up cooking them for about an hour and a half. They tasted great and DD said they were the best I've ever made. I usually just spray the potatoes with cooking spray or coat with a little bit of oil. I only had margarine but that did the trick. I will be making this again using others reqs about soaking them first.

These were great. You do have to watch the time closely because there is perhaps a minute between awesome and overcooked. But you have to do that with regular fries too.  Thanks for sharing this healthy, great tasting recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and the fries turned out soggy and tasted funny with the butter (more like popcorn than your traditional fry taste).  I would try this again using an oil rather than butter.

SOOO good! I used others suggestions and coated mine in olive oil, then put a generous amount of salt and pepper on it. I then lightly sprinkled it with seasoning salt. They were really good, and I didn't feel as guilty eating so many!

These turned out great.  I left the skins on my potatoes and tripled the recipe.  I used real butter and after they were done, I placed under the broiler for a few minutes.  I added kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper.  These would be great with just about any seasonings.

I thought these tasted fine for a quick fry. I wish the nutrition info was listed, as they are called skinny fries. I only had butter with canola oil and used that. The fries seemed a little oily to the touch, when done. Although, I normally use oil so I am not sure why. The butter with canola oil blend cuts the saturated fat in half anyway. They also don't really crisp up oddly, just brown. I used all of the salt, but just added pepper to taste. They were fine for today, but I guess I just prefer the baked fries with flavorings added and cut a little thicker.

These tasted good but were not 'crispy' as I was expecting.  I was quite disappointed.  I guess there really is no way to make fries crispy in the oven.

These are good. My kids really like them. They really stuck to my cookie sheet even with frequent turning.  Next time I will try to use parchment paper under them.

My bad, I either cut these too small or left them in the oven too long! Very crunchy but overall good taste. I will try again with a little bigger fry and check them periodically. Oh, used olive oil instead of butter.

Surprisingly easy and the best part is they were  & yummy.  Like other reviewers, I soaked the slices in ice water for an hour  and dried them before placing them in a ziplock bag with oil.  I put salt & pepper on them before baking and salted again when I turned them.

I made it and although I liked it I made the mistake of cutting the potatoes too thin hence  they got burnt slightly. I'm going to make them again and make them thicker.

The idea is solid but needs some work. I cooked for 20 minutes and went to flip them and they were already very crispy on one side and almost cooked. I couldn't imagine letting them go another 25 minutes. In total I may have cooked them 30 minutes. They needed to be flipped more often.
