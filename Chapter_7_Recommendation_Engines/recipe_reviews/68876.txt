Refrigerate for three hours?  How does one do that when this slaw tastes so excellent?  I was tempted to eat the entire bowl on the spot!  Man, after I mixed this up, I had one bite.  And had I not put the lid on the container and slapped it in the refrigerator, I'd have eaten the whole thing.  It's hard to imagine that this will taste better than it already does, but we are having it with Honey Ribs tonight--another recipe from the allrecipes website.  I have tried many, many slaw recipes from this website, most of them very good to great.  This one is right up there with the best of them.  I highly recommend it.

Very different and tasty coleslaw dressing!  I didn't have Miracle Whip so used sour cream instead and it was wonderful.  Also since we're on a low-carb diet, I used Splenda instead of the sugar.  Will definitely use this one again.

I'm in the middle on this one. I liked the horseradish but it was way too heavy on the mayo and miracle whip.  With some adjustments I may make it again.

No White Vinager and Dill Seed? USE PICKLE JUICE! Dill pickles or Kosher will work. White vinager and dill seed is what pickle juice is made from.

This was a very delicious coleslaw recipe.  I just used one whole head of cabbage and chopped it up fine, and added one small grated carrot.  The salad/dressing ratio was just perfect. I also added a tablespoon of dijon mustard.  The only other thing I will change next time is to cut back the horseradish to 1 tablespoon.  I do like the extra kick it adds, but my kids & hubby thought it was too spicy.

Very tasty and I don't really care for horseradish.  It added a nice zippy flavor and the dill weed was also a good addition to your typical coleslaw.  I added some celery seed out of habit and only used 1 cup of Miracle Whip due to what I had on hand. I will definately make this again.

Too much mayo/miracle whip. Suggest doubling the amount of cabbage or halfing the mayo. Otherwise, it was delicious.

This was a little to mayonaisy for me and the family but the flavor was nice, will definately cut back on mayo and use only 1 kind. I did only use 2 tbs of sugar and felt that was plenty probably could have used just 1 and the taste still would have been good.

Fabulous flavors - love what the dill does for the coleslaw - I always add more dill than called for because its so good!  This goes great with the New England Crab Cakes recipe from this site. :)

YUM!!! I halved the dressing recipe for 1 head of cabbage + 2 shredded carrots (definitely keep the 2 T. of horseradish though!) and it coated my veggies perfectly (I don't like my salads overdressed).  I cut down the sugar to only 1 T. which was plenty of sweetness.  I also subbed Tofu Sour Cream for the creamy salad dressing to make this dairy-free.  I love coleslaw and this is the best recipe I've come across so far!

 I subbed tofu sour cream for the creamy salad dressing to make this dairy-free. And I cut the mayo and sour crem down to a (heping) 1/4 c. each and the sugr down to 1 T.

As written, this is a 4 star.  I've made this many, many times and always get asked for the recipe.  I find that only 1 tablespoon of sugar is plenty and instead of using Miracle Whip I just use 1 cup of real mayo.  Those are the only changes and that makes for a 5-star recipe!  This is such a great change (and improvement) on ho-hum basic coleslaw and though the dill and horseradish might seem a little strange, it really is delicious!! Thanks for a great recipe!

LOVE this recipe. I follow it closely, but add two 16 oz bags of coleslaw mix, and find the dressing and proportions just right for our tastes. Highly recommended.

This was delicious, but needed a bit more sugar to take off the bitter taste of the horseradish.  But tasted wonderful on brats in a hot dog bun!!

Wow, this recipe makes me feel almost happy I had to throw away the coleslaw I made earlier! I used Marie's Coleslaw Dressing as I can't stand Miracle Whip, and also added a little red onion. The coleslaw dressing was sweet enough that I didn't need the sugar. This is good stuff!

Really good. I used apple cider vinegar b/c that's all I had and it was fine. I also used a little less mayo than what the recipe called for then added 1 1/2 tsp of water. It worked out...but next time I'll be sure to have more mayo on hand!

Very good! I didn't have any salad dressing/MW on hand so I just used a 1/2 c more mayo and then added 1/2 c sour cream and another tbsp of both horseradish and vinegar to ensure a good kick. Worked great!

I've made this coleslaw twice now and most recently for a potluck at work. It was devoured. I add a little extra horseradish because I like the kick it gives as well as some celery seed. With using the precut cabbage, it's super easy to prepare. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is an excellent tasting slaw. I did, however, change it slightly. I used one cup of Miracle Whip instead of the 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 3/4 cup salad dressing mixture. Loved the horseradish flavor! The next time I make this I may try substituting celery seed for the dill weed and see how that tastes! Overall excellent!

Paired with pulled pork sandwiches. Good as a side or on the sandwich! Has a nice zip to it, and was even rated tasty among the anti-coleslaw guests.

I would have to agree with the other reviews, that this recipe was too mayonaisey,even when I cut back on the mayonaise by 1/4 cup.  It also did not have much flavor, so I added another tablespoon of horseradish, and added chopped red onion, which improved the flavor.  Next time, I will cup back on the Miracle Whip by 1/4 cup and see if that helps it to not be so mushy.

Very good coleslaw recipe.  The only changes I made were using light mayo in place of the regular mayo, and omitting the dill weed (I really do not like dill).  It turned out great!

What a great idea to use horseradish in coleslaw!  I actually combined two recipe ideas.  Which means I used more vinegar, less salad dressing, and added Bleu Cheese crumbles.  So good!!!

This is a great coleslaw recipe - very tastey! I made a few changes based on comments from other reviewers and it turned out great - I.e. Substituted miracle whip dressing for light sour cream, added 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, reduced the sugar to 1 tablespoon, added a teaspoon of balsamic white vinegar and doubled the fresh dill. It turned out great. I will definitely make this again! Thanks for the recipe??

Used head of cabbage, one grated carrot and half a red bellpepper.  I didnt have Miracle Whip so subbed regular mayonnaise.   Increased the horseradish to 3 tablespoons and added 3 tablespoons of course dijon mustard based on another review.  Everyone raved about it and even the kids ate it.

Very, very good with a few minor modifications. I used 1 cup mayo, less horseradish (1 T), less sugar (2 T), and more vinegar (2 T of apple cider vinegar). I also added a little garlic and onion powder, as well as a dash of salt and pepper. The horseradish gave it a nice kick. As written, I think the recipe is a little too sweet and not twangy enough, but the addition of the horseradish makes the dish.

I love this!  I basically used this recipe, but with some minor changes.  I used a whole cabbbage, (so had to adjust quantities of everything else) a whole carrot and a handful of green onion.  Instead of Miracle Whip I used creamy balsamic dressing, and more horseradish.  I also added celery seed, and coriander seed with the dill seasonings.  I brought it to a party where pulled pork sammies were served, guests love it!  thanks!

We served this with pulled pork sandwiches for 150 people and I recieved 149 compliments.  Even that last person said it was pretty good for being a non-vinegar based coleslaw.  The dill and horseradish really make this recipe a winner.  Try serving it "Memphis style" on a pulled pork sandwich.  That combination takes it to a whole new level of awesome.

Great tasting coleslaw.  The dill and horseradish really give a different flavour and a nice kick.  Makes a good accompaniment to salmon or pork chops.

This is a tasty base slaw. I made a modified version by replacing the mayo w/sour cream and the salad dressing w/mayo. Then replacing the dill weed w/ 1/2 c. Finely chopped jalapeños. Spicy and yum!

Good recipe. I modified it a bit as I didn't have all the ingredients. Didnt use salad dressing only mayonnaise, cut the sugar in half as I found it very sweet,more vinegar and doubled the horseradish. Turned out great.

A nice twist on coleslaw with the added zip of horseradish.  I don't know what I was thinking ... but I added a bit of red cabbage to the green, and ended up with purple coleslaw after a day in the frig!  However, it still tasted good. :)

This was a great change from bottled slaw dressing. It was a huge hit at our family picnic the only person who didnt like it was my husband because he isnt a fan of Miracle Whip. The only change I made was adding more purple cabbage & slaw mix and more horseradish. Thanks for sharing this is a keeper.

I wanted to try something different and this was it.  I reduced the amount of mayo and miracle whip by half and used only 1 T. of horseradish, 1 t. sugar, 1 t. dill since I was wanting a lighter sauce.  This was incredible and we didn't let it marinate.  I think I may add some shavings of asiago cheese next time.  A great base and you can adjust easily to your tastes!

YAY! Love creamy slaw but didn't want the calories. Used fat free mayo and Miracle Whip to stay guilt free and it still tastes great! Love the horseradish too. Doubled the sauce and used one 48 oz. bag of cabbage from Sam's Club. Bam. Tub o'slaw for the week. Thanks Army Wife!

I know how much everyone hates reviews where people change the ingredients. What I changed was that I didin't have MAYO, only Miracle whip. I added some sour cream to it as another reviewer suggested, no dill, but celery seed, the vinegar, horseradish  and some splenda instead of the sugar. I gave DH a taste and he loved it.Thumbs up!

Being on Weight Watchers, I used Low-Fat Hellman's and Light Miracle Whip, keeping all other ingredients as listed.  This is FANTASTIC!  I wasn't sure if I would like the dill weed but it definitely gives it a distinct flavor that is just perfect!  Although the kids weren't crazy about it, my boyfriend and I will be enjoying this on a normal rotation.  Thank you!

This is about the best slaw I've ever made!  The horse radish gives it a nice bite which my DH really enjoyed, as did I.  Good change from the *regular* slaws we've been used to and great on Bar-B-Q sandwiches.  Thanks for a keeper and it's gets better the longer it chills.

Wow, I just made this...gave it a little taste before slipping it into the fridge and it's already very tasty!  I can't wait to serve it up with dinner tonight!  I did take other reviewers advice and reduced the dressing as I prefer my coleslaw less on the soupy side.

This recipe was fast and delicious! I like a creamy coleslaw that is a little sweet. This also has the extra bouns of a little heat from the horseradish. My husband even said it was the best he EVER had, even better than his mom's! Finally, one thing!! :)

The perfect summer coleslaw, for those who prefer a little more tang to the usual sweetness of coleslaw. We add extra horseradish for kick, and a bit of minced onion. Star reviews all around!

This is my new favorite coleslaw! Love the addition of horseradish and dill weed... the only change I made was to only use mayonnaise (about 3/4C.) because I was out of Miracle Whip. Oh, I also added some extra vinegar, maybe 1T. total. Thanks for a delicious recipe!

A great change to regular coleslaw. Being a great lover of any coleslaw or salad i loved it, but my family took a little persuading! I know this sounds totally strange, but my family have always had grated cheese in their coleslaw... Us Aussies are a strange bunch:), and i think next time i'll try that!

This is fabulous; everybody loves it.  I use broccoli slaw and add several small cucumbers - WOW.  I think there's too much mayo, I use only 3/4 c.

Fantastic recipe!  I thought the horseradish would be too hot (I am not a fan of spicy foods, but my husband is).  However, it tasted delicious!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Better than average, but not the best I have ever had. I added a bit of feta cheese and pepper to help give it more zest.

I did use pre shredded cole slaw mix instead of chopping my own.

This was really good. The only thing I changed was I cut the sugar down to 1/2 TBSP because I prefer it less sweet and more tangy.  I will definitely make this again and add some cayenne pepper to it for some added flare.  Thanks for the great cole slaw recipe!

My husband loves this!  I don't use Miracle Whip...I add 1 1/4 cup mayo and then put the 3 1/2 TBS sugar.  I think it is sweet enough.  I also add some onion because onion makes everything taste better!

I made this exactly following the recipe and once the flavors melded, it was excellent.  Looking at the ingredients I was skeptical but pleasantly surprised.  Served with grilled chicken.

I chopped a fresh cabbage, shredded a few carrots, added finely chopped celery and onion. I agreed with the extra horseradish recommendations and it was very good.  Will definitely make this again.

I used less horseradish, but added a jalapeño and mustard.  I used half napa cabbage and half purple cabbage, plus a little carrot.  Zesty and yummy.  Makes a great side dish, and we are also going to use it in shrimp tacos.

I knew from the start after 50 years of cooking that I needed to adjust ingredients. Liked the horseradish idea, added less mayo, and braggs apple cider vinegar and agave nectar for sweetener, as for me recipe requested way too much sugar,  and it was really good.I mix all ingredients except cabbage into a bowl, mix & taste till it suits me, then add cabbage and u will never go wrong. Have made many wonderful slaws that way.

Delicious, but way too much mayo for 16 oz. of cabbage.  I used only 1/2 cup mayo, increased dill to 2 tsp., and decreased sugar to 2 Tbsp.  I may add more horseradish next time too.  Combination of ingredients is great.  Just tweak it a bit and make it your own.

I just made this recipe and so far I love it!  I cut the sugar back a little and added a dash more vinegar.  Also cut down on the mayo because I like mine not so wet.  But definitely a keeper - thanks for the great recipe!

This was a nice twist on the usual version.  I scaled back significantly on the mayo/Miracle Whip and sugar.  Used 2/3 c. of lite mayo only and 2 T sugar.  It was zesty, refreshing, and light!

This coleslaw was a hit with everyone. I only used 1T of sugar but next time will go without as it was sweet. I also subbed Greek yogurt for the mayo. Next time I will try to add a little lime juice to the mixture as well as sneak in some shredded apple and jicama.

My family didn't care much for this but they never seem to like ANY coleslaw.  But I loved it.  The horseradish is great and makes it different from traditional coleslaw.  I ended up eating most of it myself, which I didn't mind a bit!  P.S. I used less mayo/miracle whip, which others suggested, and I think that was a good thing to do.

Best coleslaw dressing I have come across.  Definitely will make again, this recipe is a keeper!  I did add more shredded green and red cabbage and carrots though.

This is the closest to my mother's recipe (she never had a written recipe) that I can find.  I leave out the Miracle Whip, add 1/2 of a sliced red onion, extra horseradish, celery seed, and some cocktail sauce.  This has become a real staple in our house; I make it about once a month.  And it brings back fond memories of Mom.

Definitely a great alternative to the typical cole slaw. I skipped the miracle whip, but used a flavored vinegar (white wine). Turned out the great. Mix the dressing separately from the vegetables than add a little at a time so you can control how creamy the finished product is. I tend towards using less.

This coleslaw dressing is a HUGE hit at our house! I made a few changes to it and it is just fabulous. I use ceasar salad dressing in place of the Miracle Whip. I use just slightly less ceasar dressing than the recipe calls for with the Miracle Whip. And, I use dill dressing mix in place of the dill weed. Yummy!

This was great.  Not quite as zesty as I would like, but I'll add more horseradish next time.  I let it sit overnight in the fridge and the paired it with the pork sandwich recipe from this site.  Wow!  It was hard to stop eating.

I found this recipe when I was looking for a coleslaw recipe to use a head of cabbage my neighbor gave me out of his garden. By the time I chopped up the cabbage and added about 3/4 head of red cabbage and almost a pound of grated carrots, I realized I'd have to double the rest of the recipe!  That worked out absolutely perfect. It wasn't too dry and it wasn't too wet. I love the extra flavor the horseradish and dill added. My guests raved about this when I served it for our bbq yesterday. I will for sure make this again!

I have now been making this coleslaw since it was first reviewed and it is THE recipe.  I think the horseradish is the secret ingredient.  I use fresh cabbage, carrots and a half an onion, thinly sliced.  Simply delicious.

I don't even like horseradish, but loved this recipe. I did not use miracle whip and only used about 1/2 of the sugar called for.  This would have been waaay to sweet otherwise.  We are not much into sweet stuff though.

De-lish! I didn't have miracle whip (don't like it) but I did what another user suggested and added sour cream instead. Also added fresh cut broccoi, red onion for color(and taste!)and a little salt and pepper. Served with cajun catfish and sweet potato fries.

You must really like the taste and the sensation that comes from eating horseradish if you are going to enjoy this coleslaw.  I was not quite prepared for this kind of coleslaw.  Some people might enjoy it but I really didn't.  It is definately different from regular coleslaw, sometimes different is better, but not in this case.

This was the first time I've attempted to make homemade coleslaw.  I used a head of cabbage and baby carrots instead of the coleslaw mix.  I didn't have Miracle Whip or sour cream, so I used extra mayo and some ranch dressing.  It was quite tasty... even my picky daughter loved it!!

Best coleslaw ever. I have tried many looking for a balance between sweet & savory and this is it. It's creamy with great zest from the dill and horseradish. Will make this one again and again. Thank you!

Great taste but way too much mayo and salad dressing.  This could easily dress 2 packages of slaw, which is what I will do next time.  Great flavor, but I just can't get passed the amount of dressing on it.  My tioddler and kindergartener loved it though!

I didn't have any Miracle Whip and used all mayo, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I'm not a big coleslaw fan and was surprised at how much I liked it.  I would omit or reduce the sugar the next time I make it as I found it too sweet.  Overall, my family loved it and so did my guests.

The flavor of this recipe is very good. However, I gave it four stars because it was not zesty to me. Next time I will add extra horseradish.

I have been searching for the perfect colesaw recipe for years and the search ends here!  I did change a few things, however: I added some salt and pepper, and think that they are necessary to really bring out the flavors of the dish.  I also changed the proportion to half a cup of each the mayo and the Miracle Whip.  I didn't have white vinegar, so substituted Balsamic Vinegar...but, don't recommend that because it made the coleslaw a weird tan sort of color (oops).  Anyway, it was the perfect combination of sweet and tangy.  I do think that anyone who wasn't pleased with the results of this might have just needed some salt added - that really made a huge difference.

Delicious - I have four favorite coleslaw recipes from this site and now I am adding this when I want one with a kick.  Only change was that I used all Hellmann's mayo. This is so creamy.  Thanks submitter.

I found this recipe to be too sweet, it would have been better if I had put less sugar in it!

My father only likes Marzettis on his coleslaw, I made the dressing for this and served it instead. I didn't have time to run to the store. He never knew the difference! I cut the horshradish in half, and added a bit more mayonaise.

If you like a little horseradish flavor then this is the slaw for you.  I do and even folks who weren't sure if they did, with this recipe, they do now.  Good job ArmyWife99!

This slaw was excellent and easy to make. Definately make it the night before to allow the slaw to marinate. Be prepared, the slaw will shrink by about a 1/4 in size. There is no need to buy store bought cole slaw any more!

I have to say this is the best coleslaw recipe I have ever tried.  My 11 year old son is a good eater, likes coleslaw, but doesn't rave about the slaw I have made in the past (my mom's way).  But, he loves this slaw.  All my family and friends really like it and have even said the horseradish is the key!  Kudos to the chef/cook!

Fantastic! Used it for a cook-out, and everyone raved! Did take the previous advice about doubling the coleslaw mix. A keeper!

This was surprisingly good.  I only had mayo so I used 1 1/2 cups of that...we like it saucy...and I added an extra tsp of horseradish and vinegar.  It was really nice and tasted even better the next day.

This is the only coleslaw recipe I use...the horseradish gives it the perfect zing, while the dill gives it a wonderfully, different twist.  And as for those who said too much dressing...I say "Is there such a thing as too much dressing?"  ha ha!

This is the first time I've made coleslaw, and I was very happy with it. I substituted sour cream, as was suggested, and doubled the coleslaw   mix amount, as has also been suggested. Everything else was the same, and it turned out really well. I made it for my son, who loves coleslaw. He gave it top marks (ate it in no time flat), and I liked it too. I don't eat a lot of cole slaw, but this was very good.

OK, so this was pretty good. I did make a couple of major changes however. I took Pauldis advice and used sour cream for the salad dressing and I used a chipotle mayo instead of regular. There is no doubt that I will make this again the next time I have bbq. I made this with "Southern Pulled Pork" from this site and made a sandwich. You better like horseradish if you are going to make this. Also I didn't find that it was to saucy as some people have eluded to. Maybe the changes helped, who knows. Cheers and good eating!

I think it taste great and people that tried it either loved it or hated it.  It looks like it has too much dressing on it but I do not think it taste too strong of dressing.  But I may try adding just a little more cabbage.  But it is a real keeper.

YUMMY!  It is a lot of sauce though.  I added another half a bag of cole slaw and it was perfect.  Will definitely make again!

Quite tasty and soooo very easy!  I like to add sunflower seeds to my coleslaw as added texture.

This is really tasty, but the dressing should be halved, or the cabbage part doubled. It was WAY too saucy. I'm going to add another bag of the coleslaw mix to it tommorrow and it'll be much better. I will definately make this again.

I have been searching for a great coleslaw recipe and have finally found it!  Thank you!  It has the perfect sweetness mellowed by the dill.  I did not have horseradish on hand, and it was still wonderful!
