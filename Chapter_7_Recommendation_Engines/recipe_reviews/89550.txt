Pretty caramel-beige in color, perfectly shaped, moist cupcakes.   Just mildly sweet, they’re an ideal foundation for sweet frosting.  The cornstarch acts as cake flour would, making these very light and fluffy with a tender crumb.  They are, quite simply, above criticism.  Except for one thing….they are WIMPY in terms of spice!  I mean, you barely notice any spice flavor at all.  For the “four pinches” each  of salt and nutmeg called for I used 1/4 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg.  If I were to make these again I’d probably double both the cinnamon and the nutmeg and might even consider adding 1/4 tsp.  each of cloves and ginger as well.  Paired with "Caramel Frosting IV," also from this site, these were a beautiful cupcake.  Don't be shy about making 'em - just add more spice! Update: Unfortunately I have to change my rating from four stars to three. While these were good and moist after I baked them, the next morning they were disappointingly dry.  Perhaps adding a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil would help.

OMG!!!!This is the best cupcake I have EVER eaten. I make cakes for a living and refer to this site for flavor profiles all the time. I stumbled onto this recipe and think it is absolutely fantastic! I added a few more shavings of fresh nutmeg and used Jamacian Allspice. This is spectacular I am puttin two more stars here **!

So tasty and only a hint of sweet. I prefer a little more spice so I add a bit more to taste of the nutmeg and cinnamon. Topped with a classic vanilla buttercream, these are amazingly easy and good!

WONDERFUL!!!  I had a hard time baking these because the batter was SO DELICIOUS!!!   I didn't have a problem with the pinch measurements because I actually pinch and dash measuring spoons :)

Nice flavor! Very heavy to be called a "cupcake" though. I would call these muffins. :)

These were ok, but they tasted more like a spiced muffin with a drier consistency and less sweetness than I'd expect in a cupcake.  I'd make them again as a muffin to eat with dinner - like cornbread or something similar.

The Cupcakes were okay but it was to sweet for me and i had issues with the pinch measurement and it did not have enough spice. This recipe would be better with less sugar and more spice.

I made these cupcakes with homemade buttercream frosting and apple butter compote filling. They are DIVINE. Some reviewers complained that they were dry or muffin-like, but I did not have that experience. A great recipe!

This is a very good cupcake recipe. The crumb is very tender. I gave it four stars because there's definitely not enough spices to be labeled a Spice Cupcake. I used two tsp cinnamon, 3/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/2 tsp ginger, and 1/4 tsp ground cloves and that seemed to about just right for me. It was a little too sweet for breakfast too and since the crumb is so tender, I think you could easily cut 1/3 cup of sugar and be okay. My kids enjoyed making them and having them for an afternoon snack!

These are great! I read the reviews and increased the spices, 1 tbsp cinnamon, ½ tsp nutmeg and ¼ tsp salt & ¼ tsp ground cloves. I topped them with butter icing and they were a big hit! Yum!
**update: just looked at the pictures, sorry, I'm a better baker than photographer... :)

I think something went wrong. First thing that comes to mind is that I used Bob's Red Mill All Purpose Gluten free flour instead of regular flour. I didn't think this would be a big deal, as I've replaced regular flour with the all purpose gluten free stuff before and things turned out fine. I was really excited about these cupcakes...until I tasted the batter! It was probably the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth. I seriously couldn't get the bad taste out of my mouth all night. I was looking at my bag of flour wondering if it was sour or something, but it's not that old. I was concerned with how they would taste after baking, but I did it anyway, and my family says they're okay. I will give this another go with regular flour next time and more spices, as others have suggested. Hopefully it was just a fluke from the gluten free flour? Others have said the batter was delicious, so I'm going to assume this was my bad. Oh, and we topped them with vanilla/almond buttercream frosting. They're disappearing from the kitchen, so they must be good.

PERFECT! I'm still learning to cook, and those were the first thing I bake. I followed the recipe exactly except for two minor changes; used half butter and half vegetable oil because I didn't have enough butter, and increased the amount of spices a bit. They turned out beautiful, moist and just DELISH! The great thing was that they stayed moist without even storing them. Made some vanilla butter cream recipe from the website too to go with them. Definitely recommended!
