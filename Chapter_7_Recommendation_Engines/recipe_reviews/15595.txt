very good and easy to make... i used half as much sugar as called for b/c i read somewhere you can do that if you are trying to cut down on sugar... and it still tastes good... i also put some cinnamon in it b/c i think cocoa and cinnamon go great together. i might make this again.

The only thing that I changed about this recipe is that I made cupcakes instead of a normal cake.  This cake was so easy to make, good for when your in a rush.  Although the batter did taste weird at first, after it was in the mixer for 5 minutes it tasted better but when the cupcakes came out they instantly turned flat.

Nothing unusual, different or weird about this recipe, which is just what I wanted.  This is a plain and simple, good old fashioned butter-based chocolate cake, an ideal basic and versatile recipe to do with whatever your heart desires.  In my case I made Rocky Road Cupcakes with it today.  I made a half recipe which yielded 10 cupcakes, filled only about half full as I topped them with chopped walnuts, miniature marshmallows and chocolate chips before baking. Put them out for the landscape crew working in my yard and within a couple of minutes all I had left of them was the photo I posted!

So easy and so delicious! I use whole wheat flour with this recipe.  I think the whole wheat gives it a more interesting texture.  Either way.. great recipe!

We've now made this twice. It's very easy, moist and delicious, great kids birthday cake. It took us a little longer to cook - more like 40 minutes.

I followed the recipe but only reduced the sugar content. It tasted exactly how i wanted - not too sweet.  I baked exactly for 35 mins and the surface is a bit crunchy but soft and moist inside. perfection!

Yummy!  I loved it and so did my family.  It was so easy to make that my 2 year old was able to help me with most of it.  Like some others, I did change the recipe slightly.  I increased the amount of cocoa used to 1 cup (you can never have too much chocolate) and I decreased the amount of sugar to 1 cup (I may even use slightly less next time as it was still really, really rich).  Also, I used hemp milk instead of cow's milk.  It came out moist and chocolatey...everything you want in a chocolate cake.  I topped it with a super easy peanut butter frosting and sprinkled it with some mini chocolate chips.  It was DELICIOUS!

Ok. So the cake turned out delicious, and it was very easy to make...but unless my oven is failing (it can't be, I baked chicked right after) this cake took almost an hour to fully bake. The middle remained soft, and I had to check it every 10 minutes or so. The cake is a tasty one, but not as quick as it should have been.

Very moist in the center, the edges were a little dry but I think I baked it too long (my fault).
It was very chocolately! The frosting is a different recipe.

This is a great, easy cake.  I made it all the time in college, because it requires minimal ingredients and utensils.  It's not gourmet, but it's really tasty, and it baked evenly even in my warped pan.  I made it with salted butter once, and thought that added a nice flavor.

This was a nice and moist chocolate cake with a mild flavor. I got nervous when I read the reviews, so I added a splash of vegetable oil (maybe 1/4 cup) to the batter because who wants to serve a dry cake?! I frosted it with mocha buttercream icing. The cake was a hit! I will definitely make this again!

This cake was very good.  There were some comments about it being dry.  If you use oil instead of butter or margarine, it works out perfectly. That's my rule for cakes and quick breads. Oil makes more moisture that won't be affected by the heat of baking.

This was a good cake I make this for a friend of mine. Just put all ingredients into the mixing bowl mixed low 30sec and high 3min. Super easy truly one bowl. Was done in 25min when I checked maybe my oven. Used super easy icing 3tbl butter/3tbl cocoa/1cup icing sugar/1tbl milk or as needed and 1/2 tsp vanilla essence. Mix all together and frost cake. You can add more icing sugar if prefer sweeter. This makes 1 cup. cake.

EXCELLENT!!  Followed the recipe exactly, but put it in a bundt pan.  Had to bake for about 50 minutes, and it turned out great.  Brought it to a luncheon and everyone loved it.

This cake is really easy to make and it tastes good.  It was moist, but like others said the edges were a bit dry.  The flavor was rich and chocolatey, but I would suggest reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp and increasing vanilla extract to 2 tsp.  Will make it again, but try using 2 small bundt cake pans instead.  Thanks

I've been trying to improve my baking skills and avoid boxed mixes and this was phenomenal. The flavor was fantastic and it was easy enough for a novice baker. I actually got creative and combined it with the chocolate chip cookie dough cupcake recipe, replacing the white cake mix with this recipe. The proportions turned out just right and I am now famous for the cupcakes that resulted.

A good basic chocolate cake, as it implies, but too sweet for our tastes and any cupcakes I've made with it are flat as pancakes. If you're planning to decoratively frost them that's not a problem, but there are no nice "domes" that usually occur from cupcakes made with a standard cake recipe.

This cake was delicious and it was very moist. It was great and I highly recommend it for large groups of people! I think it is far too rich to eat by yourself. Just take that piece of advice.

Excellent cake! I made it for a birthday at work Thursday, now I have to make another for Monday! Frosted it with chocolate buttercream enhanced with Nutella.  It flew out of the pan! Thanks for sharing a great cake!

Very simple and delicious cake...I did add about 3 ounces of melted dark chocolate to the butter/sugar mixture and about two teaspoons of fresh orange zest -WOW! I also added chocolate pudding with orange zest mixed in and layered it between two sections of the cake. So good!

As per the other reviewers, I used 2 tsp vanilla essence, only 1/2 tsp salt, 1 full cup of cocoa powder, and baked it in a large bundt tin, which had been well greased and dusted with flour then cocoa. The very watery mixture (you have been warned!) was then baked for 37minutes, and cooled in the tin for an hour before turning out. How can a cake be so moist, light-crumbed yet rich? Everybody went back for seconds. Great with a glass of cold milk.

This was fairly easy to make but I didn't love the recipe, its simply okay...even though I didn't even leave the cake in for close to the recommended time it got overly crispy on the top and sides. Maybe I had the oven to hot...but...meh. This one was not a huge hit for me. EDITTTTTTTTTT, I liked this wayyyyy better once it was chilled, I like my cakes chilled in the fridge because it often improves the tastes / flavors and in this case it really did.

I've made lots of chocolate cakes but I loved this one because it's very easy with basic ingredients that one normally has on hand and because unlike most recipes for chocolate cake it's moist without being too light. I think the reason it works is because the balance of ingredients is just right.

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a chocolate cake! 
I made this recipe exactly as written. What I have is a moist, fluffy, chocolatey cake with a perfect texture and consistency for me. 
I had a piece without frosting and it was perfection. 
I LOVE that this is so easy to make. I did use 2 bowls - one for the dry ingredients, and my Kitchenaid mixer bowl for the wet ingredients (that I then added the dry to.) 

I have saved this recipe to make it again and again!

This is a nice, standard chocolate cake recipe.  There’s no bells and whistles, but if you’re looking for an easy chocolate cake, this should work very well for you.

Super easy to make and absolutely delicious! Moist, not over-sweet, and excellent flavor. My son and I couldn't help slicing "just one more" narrow layer off the top before frosting it, now we have a short cake!

I will make this one again and again with a variety of toppings. Thank you so much for the recipe!

I really liked this cake recipe. I was impressed that it stayed moist for days after I made it. I used to make "One Bowl Chocolate Cake III" because it was so highly rated and had over 1000 reviews, but this recipe is so much better! Sorry "Cake III" I have found a new go to chocolate cake recipe.

This is a really good recipe..everyone in my house loved it! I didn't use cocoa powder because I didn't have any available, so I used about a bar and a half of melted milk chocolate instead and it still came out great! Just a tip..if you don't have the cocoa it's fine if you use chocolate. I wanted to use dark chocolate for the recipe but all I had was milk chocolate and even w/out lowering the amount of sugar stated in the recipe, it didn't turn out sweet..again, it's a really good recipe!

I went to make this the other day and discovered I had NO cocoa powder, so I made it without, substituting flour for the cocoa and adding a bit more vanilla - it was melt in your mouth amazing!  I have been making this cake for 3 years now. I live in a place where cake mixes are VERY expensive to this is a god-send.  Love it!

This cake was pretty good. I've had better chocolate cakes. I chose this recipe because of the easiness of the recipe. I took most of it to work and I got marriage proposals! They loved it there.

The recipes was pretty simple, and easy to make. Although the cake stuck to the pan even though it was greased and floured as told, and the cake is dry. Not moist.

OH MY! This cake is delicious! I did this exactly as the recipe calls for. Not one change and it came out beautiful. I was slow to cook it. Started with 28 minutes because my oven sometimes cooks fast. But, I had to let it go an additional 10 minutes anyway.  I will do this again.

This is a two bowl recipe, not one because you set stuff aside to combine after. I made cupcakes with it, they were baked fully in 30 minutes. I wish the recipe called for more cocoa, not very chocolatey. I made these by accident, I thought I had looked up the one bowl number three recipe not realzing there was more than one.  Lots of people will like this, it is easy and satisfies a sweet tooth but not a huge chocolate craving.

Amazing recipe! I made this one for my son's birthday party, him and all his friends gobbled it down. I actually got this recipe from here: https://www.cashfloat.co.uk/blog/money-borrowing/birthday-party-budget/
It's a great article about making birthday parties on a budget, and they recommended this recipe! :)

I made this tonight and it turned out great! Very rich chocolate flavor! I added a little more chocolate and I did layers, but those were the only changes I made to the recipe. It did take a little longer to bake, about 10 more minutes, but I baked them at 325 & the baked up big and fluffy ??

Was disappointed because I followed the recipe without alterations. I thought it was too dry and nothing special about it. I tested with a toothpick at 30 min. and it came out wet so I put it back in for another 5 and then it tested done. I covered with foil after it cooled and frosted the next morning with Fluffy Peanut Butter Frosting from this website. That was what saved it. I will not try this one again.

I have used this recipe several times now.I bake a lot and this has become a firm favorite. The cake is soft and moist but firm enough to support a fondant covering.

Exactly like a box cake - light and airy; good to use as a base for variations (ex. adding nuts, icing, fruit, etc.). Simple but you need 2 bowls!

Great cake... But I woul advise doubling the proportions to get a thicker cake.. I always love to cut it in the middle to be able to put creme...

Wonderful, moist recipe. I did make a change, and added 1 bottle of chopped maraschino cherries. I think you could modify this recipe in any number of ways and still have it come out great!

I thought this was just ok.  It was easy, and fast, but nothing special.  Maybe frosting would have tipped the scales.  I think if I was in a hurry again, I'd made Crazy Cake instead for chocolate cake.
