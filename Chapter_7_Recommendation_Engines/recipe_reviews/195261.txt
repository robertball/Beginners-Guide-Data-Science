Very tasty! Can be done without ricotta cheese, but it's going to be less moist. I've done it before, adding about 1/4-1/2 cup milk in the place of ricotta.

Will definitely make this again!

The first time I made this dish I followed the original recipe and I thought it was a bit too cheesy.  So when I made it again tonight, I used half the amount of all the chesses except mozz; and nearly twice the amount tomato sauce.  I also added half a teaspoon each of onion powder, garlic powder, and sweet basil.   It was excellent! It was indeed "hearty," I didn't feel the need for any side dishes and it still fed 3 college aged men.

Wonderful dish. My only change was using more ricotta cheese than it called for. I buy the ricotta in the tub and I just use the entire tub, I'm sure it isn't much more than the cup called for but it sure gave it a creamy texture. Yum.

Very easy, inexpensive, and kid friendly. I added some sweet Italian sausage, and a little bit more parmesan. Everybody liked it!

I'm giving this a 5 but it needs more sauce. It was alright the first night but reheating leftovers left it pretty dry. I'm sure the rigatonis soaked up the sauce overnight. I also had a 15 oz container of ricotta which I used instead of just the cup. This was good but as stated it needs more sauce.

Pretty good, very basic pasta casserole. Great for a busy night. Could use more seasoning, maybe hot pepper flakes, basil and oregano. Would be a great way to use up roasted vegetables. Thanks!

Really, really good & tastes more complicated than it is!  I did not have ricotta so used heavy creme as one reader suggested.  Also used "Italian blend" of cheeses rather than just mozzarella and parmesan.  My boys (9 and 11), friends, and husband loved it!  A full meal with a salad.

excellent - - didn't have heavy cream, so used 1/4 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup light sour cream.  Added extra Italian seasoning.  Could have added a bit more moisture.  Even the meat eaters loved it.

Extremely easy and delicious! I didn't have any Rigatoni so I substituted for something else. Non the less, it was still perfect!

This was fairly fast and easy to put together and worked out for a weeknight meal. We didn't care much for it though and it was okay, just not something we want to have again. This is one we chose not to keep the leftovers, sorry :(

***** This was terrific!  I made it with Perron's sweet sausage sauteed & cut into chunks.  My husband even ate it again for leftovers and raved about them too.

Made this in large amount for my daughter's water polo team.  It was a big hit and so easy to put together before and then cook right before serving.  Adding it to my bag of tricks.

This recipe was great! A friend of mine came in town for the weekend and we wanted to bake something easy and yummy. This proved to be both! Paired it with a small Caesar salad on the side.

I agree this is a starter meal.  Handmade meatballs were cooked and added to the mix then baked together as written in the recipe.  Without meat this appears to be very bland.

My family all really liked this. I added some pre-cooked meatballs to the mix before baking and used a meat flavored spaghetti sauce. I also used a shredded mozzarella/provolone blend. It was quick and easy. I will definitely make it again.

I added extra sauce, browned ground beef with onion, garlic, and fresh mushrooms.  I double it and freeze the leftovers! (Undercook the pasta JUST a tad if if you're going to freeze)

I agree, this was delicious.  The only change I made was substituting a whole wheat rigatoni for the regular.  It gave it a heartier taste, and, it's healthier.

Served this on New Year's Day as a side dish for a large crowd.  I thought this recipe very bland.  Maybe adding crumbled sausage might add something more to it.  Would not make again without some changes.
