These meatballs were absolutely fantastic.  I made a few changes, such as omitting the jalapenos for personal preference, and I used a bit less ground pepper and chili pepper than were called for because I had never cooked with ground turkey before and didn't know how the flavor was going to be.  The mixture seemed a LITTLE too wet but cooked up just perfectly. The Meatballs were juicy and extraordinarly flavorful. The italian seasoning I think is what really made these great.  As I said, I wasnt sure how strong the flavor of the Turkey would be so I had reservations about what sort of Sauce I could serve these with.  I ended up doing a garlic and olive oil angel hair pasta, but the Meatballs could have gone REALLY well with a Creamy mushroom sauce or even a marinara.  I added an extra tablespoon of blue cheese and I still didnt think the flavor of the Blue cheese was very strong.. My father couldn't taste it at all! Will definitely add more next time and will DEFINITELY make these again and again.

Don't let the somewhat unusual combination of ingredients throw you off. This is a fantastic, flavorful recipe that can be easily altered to suit your own tastes.

My wife and I are cooking more with turkey these days (sorry, beef!) and no flavor was lost by using it. I was a little skeptical about the blue cheese. (I love it and she hates it). One of the other reviewers said it was undetectable, and I would have to agree... my wife didn't complain one bit!

I skipped the jalapenos simply because I didn't have any, but basically followed the rest of the instructions closely and can't think of anything I would change.

We'll make these again, maybe for a dinner party we have later this month.

I made this recipe almost exactly as written (I used half the black pepper called for). Unfortunately the meat mixture was too wet to form into meat balls. An additional 1/2 cup of bread crumbs did the trick. I really enjoyed this recipe. The ingredients were subtle and complemented each other well. I served the meatballs with a balsamic reduction along with sides of wilted spinach and pasta with homemade pesto sauce. YUM! On a sorry note, my husband and children are traditionalists and prefer the same old turkey meatballs I usually make (not your fault). They gave you between 1 and 3 stars. However, I gave you 5! Since my vote counts more (after all, I searched for recipe, made recipe, prepared appropriate accompaniments and took the time to review said recipe), I gave you an average 4 star rating. You did a great job and should be proud of this recipe. I am impressed that this was submitted by a 15 year old. I look forward to great things from you!

Very tasty recipe. I only had feta on hand, so I upped the oregano, and added a lot of crushed hot "pizza style" pepper. Nice Greek style meatballs. TIP OF THE DAY. Use mini muffin trays & make the meatballs a little larger so they sit up on the tray. Nice way to cook them, and the drippings are in the bottom of the trays.

Loved these meatballs!  So tasty.  My only problem was that they did stick to my aluminum foil a little too much.  In the future I may let them cool and firm up some before trying to take them off of the cookie sheet.  
I served with a spicy marinara sauce and a spinach salad.

When my husband takes these to work people gather around the microwave to see what smells so good! Only tihng I changes was to use 1 Tbsp olive oil instead of 3. I am going to make these once a week.

This was a great new way to prepare ground turkey.  I followed the recipe except I added only one jalepeno plus seeds and they were so good!  Will make again.

Awesome!  So impressed a 15 year old is submitting their own recipes! I'm not a HUGE fan of blue cheese but it is very subtle and really adds something great to the average turkeyball. Look foward to seeing more from you smithey!

One major problem is that the recipe calls for way too much black pepper. I would cut it to 1 tsp at most. I have to wonder it the tblsp is a misprint.

It is OK, but I will do it much different next time.

Great recipe.  Very delicious.  Didn't have any jalapenos on hand so I used diced green chiles instead, which I thought worked very well.  Will definitely make these again.

I didn't find these as amazing as other did.  To be fair, I didn't follow the recipe precisely (used a whole onion, 2 full eggs, slightly more turkey/crumbs/blue cheese)...but for me the blue cheese taste wasn't enough or just didn't work.  I also expected a bit more taste with all of spices included.  Not a bad idea for combos of flavours...but my execution didn't result in an amazing result.

These meatballs were tender, flavorful and delicious.  I used ground turkey breast and baked them on foil sprayed with cooking spray.  Per the suggestions of other reviewers, I allowed them to cool on the foil and they came right off despite the fact I forgot to add oil to the recipe. I used Worcestershire in place of soy sauce.  I served them over noodles topped with a white sauce to which I added garlic and Parmesan cheese--mmmmmmm GOOD!  Thank you for a recipe I will use again!  P.S.  My husband had leftover meatballs in a sandwich for lunch the next day: like a meatloaf sandwich, only better.

Best meatball I have ever made hands down!  I'm not a huge fan of blue cheese but decided to give it a go in this....so glad I did!  It's not over powering and the seasoning is perfect!  Served it with balsamic cream sauce from this site.  Perfect...thanks!

This is terrific. You say it's a recipe you designed? Then I think you have a future in culinary school, such as the CIA (if you can afford it, or get loans). Think about it. It makes ground turkey, which is often dry, into a moist, succulent dish. This one's a keeper.

Amazing flavor. I followed this recipe with a few minor adjustments to allow for less heat, leaving out the jalapenos and dialing the black pepper down to 1 teaspoon. Not wanting to be left with egg yolks to deal with, I used only two whole eggs and omitted the olive oil. Otherwise made as written. The blue cheese bite was prominent but did not overpower. For the best blue cheese flavor, be sure to use a traditional full strength Danish blue and not a milder one. The ingredient list reads like a motley crew, but it all simply melds together beautifully. The meat balls were perfectly moist. The mixture will seem overly moist, but this is what contributes to the tenderness of the final product. Use a small cookie scoop to form each one and bake on a sheet of parchment paper for stick-free, easy cleanup. With such great flavor, they really stand well on their own and I served them that way, unaccompanied by a sauce of any kind.

I made up almost the exact same recipe except I "sneak" in more vegies (carrots, mushrooms, red & yellow peppers & zucchini).  Everyone loves them!  Especially good on spaghetti squash with a little light alfredo sauce.

What a great change from my usual meatball recipe! I didn't bother processing the garlic, onion and jalapeno - just diced it all super-finely by hand. Also used two whole eggs instead of just whites. Needed a little salt in addition to the soy sauce, and maybe some kind of sauce, but we really enjoyed them. Good stuff! Thanks!

My husband saw this recipe come through our inbox and decided to give them a try. We don't eat any red meat in our house so needed something different to try with ground turkey. We tripled the recipe (we have 7 to feed and 3 are teens). We made this with one less egg white, substituted oregano for the Italian seasoning as we were out and dill for the parsley as we were out as well. Everyone from the 9y/o to the 92y/o absolutely loved them! This made 24 2" meatballs. I made a cream gravy and we served them over buttered noodles with dill and increased the baking time by 10 minutes because we tripled the recipe! Will definitely make again and again!

We really liked these. I did make a few changes (no eggs, Worcestershire for the soy, a whole onion) but nothing that I think made any real difference. I served these over fettucine with a bechamel sauce which I seasoned with some of the jalapeno/onion mixture from this recipe. It was a great meal, thanks for sharing!

I had to make some substitutions because I really didn't feel like going to the store...so I just used what was in my kitchen.  I didn't use the jalepeno peppers, I used grated parmesan cheese instead of the blue, and used seasoned bread crumbs. After the meatballs were baked I put them in the crockpot with Ragu Marinara sauce and slow cooked them for about 5 hours for a party. Everyone loved them and no one even knew they were turkey! Next time I try these I will definitely be following the recipe exactly...I have a feeling the blue cheese will add a nice dimension of flavor.

I've been a member of AR for years.  It's my go-to source for recipes.  Not often have I felt compelled to rate a recipe, but this one is *ridiculously* GOOD.  
Read the helpful hints from others.  My only modifications were a little more bread crumbs, the mixture was pretty wet.  (I added about 1/4 cup.)  And less pepper.  I used 1 TEASPOON, not tablespoon.  
Be sure to spray your foil with cooking spray. That's it.  These. Are. Awesome.  And easy. I'll make these from now on!

These had an odd texture but not necessarily in a bad way.  It just wasn't what I usually get in a meatball.  I thought they had good flavor even though I left out the jalapeno since I have small children.  I also added almost double the blue cheese since so many other reviewers could not taste the cheese.  All in all, they were good and complimented my husband's tomato sauce pretty well.

These ingredients seem unlikely to go together, but they're actually really great!! This was a really yummy recipe!  I only added 1 jalapeno pepper, though.

Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

These were delish!  The only thing I changed was the amount of bread crumbs.  I didn't have a half cup, it was more like a little more than a 1/4 c.  They didn't fall apart but were still moist and juicy!  I served them in a really light alfredo sauce over fettucini with a side of steamed broccoli.  I will definitely make this again.

thank you for the recipe : )  These are good, but considering the # of ingredients I expected outstanding!  I only used 1TB. of oil and I think that is why they stuck to the foil a bit before cooling.  The oil is not needed, IMHO, if you grease the pan.  The jalapeno and breadcrumbs and extra seasoning take away from the more pure turkey/blue cheese taste I think I was looking for!!

The best way to describe these meatballs is "WOW".  When I first saw the recipe I thought it would be great to bring to a New Years Eve party.  But were they the best???  I tried them on a few friends over for cocktails.  I can not tell you the enthusiastic response I received on the taste.  They will be going with me on New Years Eve...and by the way, I used a Balsamic Cream Sauce  as suggested by a previous rater of the meatballs.  Absolutely fantastic.

These are so delicious!  Beware to wear gloves when working with jalapenos.  I also reduced the black pepper and used italian seasoned bread crumbs so eliminated the seasoning.  I think I tripled the blue cheese and only made about 1 inch balls.  The cheese melted out of the meatballs as they cooked, but I scooped it all up and put them in a crockpot to be served as cocktail meatballs.  No sauce needed.  Very yummy!

When I was the age of this genius I had no concept of cuisine!  Wolfgang, Emerill, Bobby...watch out!\    These are fabulous.  I subbed ground venison for the turkey and dropped the oil to 1 T.  No problem with removing from foil.  Hubby and I were extremely impressed with the results.  Kudos!

excellent combination of ingredients..My first attempt was a winner...However, on my next attempt, I'll use 1 teaspoon of pepper and increase bread crumbs to 3/4 cups to reduce wetness of the mixture...

These meatballs are so good that it made me write a review for the first time.  the reason why I didn’t give it a 5 star is because I customized the recipe.  Accidently, I forgot to add oil and egg whites but still these meat balls are so good and now I am happy that they are even less calories.  They are soft, and full of flavor.  Love them.  Will do them again.

I was so excited to make these once I saw the blue cheese and the jalapenoes..2 of my favorite things!  They weren't bad but I don't think I would make them again.  The spices realy didn't blend with the jalapenoes and blue cheese.  When I made them all of my blue cheese leaked out.  Maybe pan frying them would be a bit better.  Mine also stuck to the tin foil.  I will say they were very moist.  I had to force my husband to eat them.

I was hoping that these would be a little better.  I make turkey meatballs all the time ... and I thought I would try these as something different. I just used whole eggs .. not the egg whites.  Also, I wanted these for in a crock pot, so I made a swedish meatball sauce to go with the meatballs.  Crowd seemed to like them.  Probably won't make them again.

These were so different and so great!  I used jarred jalapeno slices (about 10) and 4 heaping tablespoons of blue cheese.  Otherwise everything as per the recipe.  It was outstanding!

Awesome! These were so good, and easy to make. For 1# of turkey, I used a spoonful of green chiles, about 2-3 ounces of blue cheese, 1 whole egg, and I eyeballed the amount of bread crumbs until it was a nice moist but ball-able texture.  Perfect!  Everyone loved them. THank you!

These are good. They adapt well to changes also. We made this recipe with ground pork since it was on sale. Everything else was done as written. I found the meatballs to be a tad bit dry and tasted like they had too much bread crumbs so next time we will use less but overall this is a good recipe. FYI: these can me made smaller and served as hors dourves quite easily. I am still looking for a sauce to match them though.

This was great!  I added extra jalapenos with the seeds, cut down the black pepper by half, and made into hamburger patties.  They had a great flavor, with just the right amount of kick.  I will definately make these again - thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe, almost. I wasn't sure about two jalapeños in this recipe but I felt adventurous and added them. I only put one egg in recipe and used the yolk as well. The meat mixture was very wet so I added a bit more bread crumbs. I did omit the chili powder as I was using it in an accompanying side dish. These were very tasty and I would definitely make this recipe again.

At first I was a little taken a back by the variety of ingredients in this recipe but don't/ let it scare you. These meatballs are great. The only things I changed were I only used a tbl. of olive oil and a teaspoon of pepper. Next time I will probably add more blue cheese just to fit our tastes. I will be making these again.

I loved these, however my hubby who is not a bleu cheese fan thought they tasted a little off.  Next time, I will make them with feta to appease him.  Used only 1 jalapeno, no olive oil, & 1 whole egg, and only a dash of chili powder, otherwise followed the recipe.  Baked on a foil lined non-stick sprayed cookie sheet.  Served with brown rice and sauteed mushrooms in a wine & turkey broth sauce.  So yummy!  They were not at all spicey, so next time may add both jalapenos & if the kids don't like them, then there are more for the adults!

ummm. ..Yumm. Not only did they make my house smell so yummy, they are the best meatballs ever! I did not use the jalapeno, the hubby does like them. I also used Gorgonsola cheeze instead of blue cheese (its a bit sharper and is sold next to blue cheese normally) For the sauce i just used an ala vodka sauce. 
Great recipe! i absolutely loved them!

had to add some bread crumbs and put the mixture in the fridge for a while to firm the meat up but these meatballs were a big hit at our house. We'll definitely make them again! lots of good flavor there :)

These are delicious!! The first time I made these, I made them smaller to serve as an appetizer and they were gone in an instant! My family requested them again within the same week!

Actually very good.  I only used one jalapeno and added an extra Tbsp. or two of blue cheese.  Instead of 3 egg whites I used 2 whole eggs and only 2 Tbsp. of olive oil.  I made them as an appetizer (bite size) and served them with the Balsamic Cream Sauce from this site as someone else recommeded.  It was the perfect compliment as a dipping sauce but could have been used on pasta with the meatballs in a meal.  Very tasty.

This is an interesting recipe. I was not, personally, all that thrilled with it, but it got some rave reviews at the party so I've kept it. (I made 3 times as much for the party.) I would add less olive oil and more bread crumbs. It seems to need lots of salt. And I added a smidge of worchestire. Baking the meatballs on aluminum foil on a pan in the oven didn't work. I fried them on the stovetop in a little oil. I might make it again for a gathering. Some people seemed to really like it.

These meatballs were SO good!  I made them for a Christmas party and they were a huge hit.  The only changes I made was used 2 whole eggs instead of 3 egg whites.  I also used waxed paper instead of aluminum foil and they did not stick at all.  Making them again tonight for Christmas Eve at my in-laws.  yum, yum!

Delicious!!! The reviews are correct - you don't actually taste the blue cheese, but it does add to the over-all flavor . . .  will most certainly make this again. VERY yum.

These were fabulous!  I chose to take some advice from previous reviews.  I added and additional 1/2 cup of bread crumbs (I used a mixture of plain and Italian style) I also sauteed the onion, jalapeno and garlic slightly before mixing it in with the other ingredients.  Wonderful flavor and I am happy to see children learning to cook! Everyone should learn, and you are off to a great start!

I made these a while ago and realised that I forgot to rate them. These were really very good. I had no jalapenos on hand, so I subbed with green tabasco sauce instead. I think I added a bit more blue cheese, just because I love it. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was wayyy to wet. I added more breadcrumbs and it is still to wet. If I made it again I would only do one egg and perhaps 1 1/2 tab. oil. Also, the black pepper is a bit much. Reduce by half.

Delicious and easy! I just grated a half onion into the turkey instead of using a food processor. Also, I substituted one whole egg instead of the 3 egg whites and it worked perfectly! Make sure not to overwork otherwise the meatballs get tough!

I didn't have this recipe with me so I tried to complete by memory.  Well my memory left out the egg whites.  I felt that the oil added the wetness I needed and I probably only used 2 tablespoons.  I left out the jalapenos intentionally, however I think they would've added a nice kick and will use next time.  These meatballs were great!  Served with pasta florentine one night and then had meatball sandwiches the next day!  These meatballs are good enough to eat alone, very tasty!  Thank you for this recipe!

This recipe was amazing! I myself like a heavy blue cheese flavor, so I added 5 tablespoons of it. My boyfriend said it was too much blue cheese, but I thought it was perfect. I also only added one jalepeno, an extra 1/4 cup bread crumbs to help the wetness of the mixture, and added everything else exactly to the recipe. It was heaven!!!

These were REALLY great meatballs.  Made exactly as is, with the exception of leaving the Jalapenos out of 2 meatballs for my small kids.  Everyone gobbled them up!  Will definitely make again!

These are delicious.  I doubled the bleu cheese and breadcrumbs, used one whole egg instead of whites and also subbed worchestershire for soy because it's what I had.  Also, I cooked these on a wire rack sprayed with oil which I then placed on a cookie sheet so that the fat could drip down.  I may as well toss my old meatball recipe- they pale in comparison.

I really liked these with a marinara sauce on spaghetti.  When I tried to eat them alone, all I could taste was blue cheese.  Next time, I will either use much less blue cheese or omit it altogether.  The recipe was really easy to make, though!

Just got finished eating this recipe and my husband and I both loved it! Unfortunately, I made it prior to reading the reviews.  Like others, I will reduce pepper and double bleu cheese next time.  I did not find the mixture to be too loose or liquidy, it fit into meatballs nicely and they were very moist when we had them.  Served over angel hair pasta tossed with olive oil and a sundried tomato alfredo sauce bought at the store.

I followed this recipe, but instead of making them into meatballs, I made them into sliders (tiny hamburgers). They were fantastic. I just shaped them into 2 inch patties and baked them in the oven. While they were baking, I took a baguette and sliced it into thin slices and then drizzled olive oil on each side and toasted them on a grill pan. When the sliders were done I placed them on the baguette slices and served them with ketchup & mustard. My college age son loved them.

I used Feta instead of blue cheese because of preference. I cut back on the onion as well. I love Panko breadcrumbs so I used those. Also made them with fresh parsley. I  really enjoyed these as did my boyfriend. Served with spaghetti sauce noodles and broccoli along side. Will make again someday.

I made this recipe EXACTLY as it is written and I wouldn't change a thing. In my opinion the jalapenos are very key. I loved these and would make them again and again.

These meatballs were really good. I used feta cheese instead of blue cheese since that's what I had on hand. They would be better with some type of sauce since the turkey dries out easily in the oven. I served them w/rice & veggie stuffed peppers on the side, but tomorrow night they'll be in spaghetti!

I didn't have any jalepenos on hand when I made this the first time, so I decided to substitute crumbled bacon. It was so good.   I've made it with the jalepenos too and it was great but if you want to mix it up a little bit, I suggest trying some bacon!  Blue Cheese and Bacon is an awesome flavor combo!!  Thanks for this recipe, we eat it almost every week.  Also good as a turkey burger, with kaiser rolls, red-leaf lettuce and mayo (I mix a little worchestire sauce in with my mayo!) Delish!!

Tasty recipe.  My changes: substituted 1 cup feta for the blue cheese, reduced olive oil to 1 tbsp, reduced pepper to approx 1 tsp, substituted worcesterchire for soy, and eliminated the chili powder.  My ground turkey package weight was 1.25# since that's all my store carried.  All other ingredients were left as is.  The mixture was moist, but not overly so.  Made sixteen (16) 2" meatballs, with one small guy left over.  Cooked up incredibly moist, cheesy, and yummy!

The whole family loved these.  Very, very tasty (and I'm not a big ground turkey fan).  The only change I made was to use two whole eggs instead of separating the eggs.  And the only complaint from my family was that I didn't make enough!

UPDATE 3/12/14: I used this recipe for turkey burgers and it was fabulous.  Very tasty, moist burgers.  I made guacamole to top the turkey burgers and it was excellent.  Thanks again for a recipe I keep coming back to, again and again!

I didn't care for this recipie.  The meatball mixyure was much too loose and the flavor was much too spicy.  I like the idea of adding crumbled cheese to the meatballs, but I think I would try goat cheese next time and tone down the 
Pepper and chilli pepper.

These meatballs were so tasty and delicious! I did not add in the jalapeno peppers because I thought it would be a bit too spicey, and they were still GREAT! 

The Blue Cheese and chili pepper really added a nice kick the regular meatballs I usually make with tomatoe sauce! I made these meatballs with some creamed spinach, and it was even better the day after.

We loved this recipe!  I followed the suggestions from the top rated reviewer, except I did not add the onion or garlic---I forgot!!!  But I added Garlic powder at the end on top of the already rolled meatballs.  Very good!

Very good recipe.  I wish I could rate it a 4.5, but that is not an option on this site.  I served these with spaghetti and they were devoured.  The blue cheese was very subtle and the jalepano/chili/black pepper gave it a nice kick.  Thanks for sharing!

yummm, these were good.  Just eyeballed the ingredients, skipped the jalapeno, used 3 stalks of green onion instead and probably more than 3 tbs gorgonzola.   The cayenne gave it a perfect kick. Will make again

i can usually make most any meatloaf/meatball recipe into burgers by leaving out the eggs and bread crumbs.. i wasn't as successful this time.. i used garlic powder and onion powder for the fresh (1/2 t each), ground chicken for the ground turkey, an extra T of blue cheese, 2 full T's of soy sauce b/c it was low sodium, left out the dried parsley b/c i had none, and used 3/4 t of black pepper b/c i read reviews that 1 T was just way too much.. i found the "burgers" to be very overpowered by the full T of italian seasoning.. one or two t's would have sufficed.. but like i said.. i adapted this to be burgers.. maybe with the egg whites and the bread the italian seasoning would have been spread out.. oh well.. ty anyway

All star review for this recipe. Very healthy & in my opinion, very tasty! It was suggested to me to add salt next time, so you may or may not want to add that along for some more flavor. Either that, or it was suggested to add some more blue cheese. Yummyyyy

Delicious. I used one egg instead of three egg whites, and I used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I made the balsamic cream sauce, copying another reviewer on here. The meatballs are incredible with the sauce, but in typical turkey fashion, they are a little bland on their own.

Followed the recipe exactly and came out delicious! The only thing I would do differently is add more blue cheese, but that's just because I can't get enough of it!

This was a hit with my family! I made it into a Turkey Meat loaf. I did however add about 1/2 cup more of bread crumbs to dry it up some. And instead of jalapeno peppers only because I did not have them, I used 1 Tbsp of crushed red peppers. I also added 3 more Tbsp of Blue Cheese on top of the loaf at the end of cooking just because I wanted to LOL! It was awesome! Thanks for sharing!

This was a delicious part of our meal.  I was afraid that the Jalapenos would make it too spicy, however, I used fresh Jalapenos from my garden and seeded and deveined them and it turned out perfect.  I have used similar ingredients in a meatloaf and it is always a crowd pleaser.  I'm more of a dash of this and a pinch of that guy, so I didn't really carefully measure out the ingredients, however, I mixed it bread crumbs until it had the right consistency.  I will keep this one.

Love this recipe, it's a favorite at home and parties!!! I used (2) serrano peppers instead of jalapenos because the store was out and they were a great substitution, and only use 1/2 tbs of black pepper. ****Tip..use parchment paper instead of foil and you won't have problems with them sticking:) Enjoy!

LOVE LOVE LOVE these... they are good alone with marinara sauce to dip... they are also good in a pasta dish with butter and parmesan... note... they are spicy, so the hotter the pepper you use, the spicier the meatball.

I made these in my ski house with a few other couples and everyone was very impressed with the combo of ingredients.

I have been trying to find the perfect slightly spicy meatball and I think this it. I did substitute Laughing Cow Blue Cheese spread for the blue cheese and I think that gave it the perfect consistency. It's also lower in calories! I also used fresh parsley since I had it on hand. I think you could probably use any of the flavored Laughing Cow and it would be great.

Did not like this one bit.  Meatballs were a bit dry which may be my own fault.  But the taste overall was bland.  I think they may be better with Parmesan instead of blue cheese.  the blue cheese just added another layer of flavor.  The combination of blue cheese, jalapeno and garlic just does not work.

I was going to add milk to the recipe but forgot.  I definitely think milk would help.  Not sure what else would help the recipe out though.

I love these meatballs! I've made them twice now and they are delicious. I did alter the recipe slightly. First, I used feta instead of blue cheese, and it worked really well. I used more cheese than was indicated in the recipe. I didn't really measure, I just kept adding it until I thought there was enough that the flavor would stand out a little more, but it was definitely more than 3 tbsp. I also used fresh parsley instead of dried and chopped it in the food processor right along with the onion mixture. I halved the black pepper and left out the olive oil. Leaving out the olive oil was an accident at first. I remembered at the end, but the mixture was already so wet that I couldn't imagine adding any more moisture, so I left it out. I don't think it really affected the end result at all. Lastly, I lined the baking sheets with parchment paper instead of foil and they didn't stick at all. Dropped them into a pot of marinara sauce and simmered for 10-15 minutes...yum!!

I hate to say it since everyone seems to really like this recipe (and I was really excited to make it), but these meatballs are BLAND. I followed the recipe exactly except I doubled the blue cheese per someone else's suggestion. While the meatballs were moist, they had ZERO flavor. It is a good recipe in concept, but next time I will double all of the spices (perhaps triple on the garlic) as well as the soy sauce, add a little bit of salt (soy sauce did not provide enough salt to flavor), and probably add about 8-10 tablespoons of blue cheese. You really could not taste the cheese at all, even though I doubled what it called for.

very flavorful. didn't have jalapeno, maybe next time.  As another review suggested, used Balsamic sauce. Meatballs stuck to foil, next time I will spary the foil with Pam or use non-stick foil.

Great recipe as is, but I modified it to suit my tastes/needs. Used gluten free bread crumbs, 1/2 ground turkey and 1/2 ground pork, increased blue cheese and left out the jalapeno. Very easy, tasty recipe!

I am a vegetarian; I exchanged the turkey with Quorn, a meatless product. I also used the whole (humanly raised) eggs.  Because it doesn’t hold shape the way animal protein does, I spread the mixture in 12 X9 inch baking pan and baked about 10 mins. Longer.  It was delicious and the best “veggie” meatloaf I’ve ever tasted!

I am loving this recipe! I've made it a few times now and every time it's amazing.  My boyfriend loves it too.  I usually put in one jalapeno instead of two but these are great with some mashed potatoes and a great salad!  I highly recommend this recipe!

These meatballs are delicious. I don't have a food processor and was feeling too lazy to chop by hand, so I threw everything in the blender. The result was very soupy, but it did not effect the meatballs at all. When everything came together it still seemed quite wet, but I think that is what makes these so tender. My husband is not a blue cheese fan, but based off the other reviews I decided to make these and not tell him about it until after he ate them. The blue cheese really adds a creaminess and a little something extra without all the funk you usually associate with blue cheese. There are now our go-to meatballs.

I changed this just a little to cut back on the calories and carbs. To solve the issue with the too wet meatballs, I only used one egg white. I used 1/4 c. parmesan cheese instead of bread crumbs and instead of the called for seasonings, I used 1/4 of a recipe of Scotdog's dry ranch dressing mix. I happened to be out of soy sauce, so I used worchstershire sauce. I know that's a lot of changes but the outcome was really good and a little lower in calories/carbs and high in flavor. I served this with Balsamic Mushrooms and my Fully Loaded Cauliflower Salad and it was a great dinner. Really didn't feel like I was missing anything at all. NOTE: OH! I didn't need the EVOO. I discovered at the last minute that I forgot it but you couldn't tell.

These were nice and filling. I didn't have any jalapeno peppers so I used cayanne pepper instead. I doubled the amount of blue cheese. I cut the pepper in half. Other than those minor changes I kept every thing else the same. These came out perfectly cooked, moist and delicious!

Very easy to make, and a pretty moist way to cook ground turkey. My mouth, however, was confused...jalapeno/blue cheese/chili powder/Italian seasoning/soy sauce... The flavors did not come together (followed recipe exactly) and none of us knew quite what to make of them, or what to serve them with--ended up with a warm orzo, asparagus and tomato salad.

DELICIOUS! I followed the recipe exactly and this is now my new favorite meatball! I baked them in a mini muffin pan as someone had suggested in a previous review and the meatballs came out very easily and it only took 20 minutes to cook. I served them with egg noodles and a mushroom sauce (1 can cream of mushroom sauce, 1/2 cup of milk, italian seasoning, 1/2 tablespoon of butter and 3 tbl of grated parmesan cheese) VERY GOOD! I will be making these very often! Thanks for sharing!

Quite good - I'm not a fan of ground turkey (let's not pretend it is what it isn't)..but this recipe made the meatballs both flavorful and moist. Will make again.

I loved these, but everyone experienced a bit of acid reflux afterwards because of the garlic.  For next time, I will reduce to 2 cloves of garlic.  Otherwise, SO flavorful! you can add any sauce to it. Everyone liked it in my home.

Pretty good.  I pressed the mixture into a muffin tin and made individual meatloaves because I didn't want to mess with meatballs, then cooked 10 minutes longer.  Made 12 big "meat muffins".  My only complaint is that even though I put in 4 tablespoons of blue cheese, we really couldn't taste it.  Next time, I'll put in alot more blue cheese.  A nice variation if you don't have blue cheese on hand would be to add some horseradish.  Overall, a good recipe that just needs a little "tweaking" for my preferences.

These meatballs are excellent!  I substituted a small can of mild green chilies for the jalapenos just because I don't like super spicy food.  I also cut the black pepper down to 1 tsp per other reviews, and these are truly the best meatballs I've ever eaten.  For those who complained that the mix was so wet...the wetter the meat mix, the moister the meatballs.  Roll them gently and place them on the cookie sheet, they will bake perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

OH...MY...GOSH!!!  These are so absolutely amazing!  I went with others' suggestion of cutting the pepper to 1tsp and I doubled (or more) the garlic.  Everyone in the family loved it, from my 6 year old to my husband.  Not always easy to have 3 kids like something new all at the same time.   MUST TRY!!!

Great meatballs!  I love Blue Cheese, so when I saw this recipe I definitely had to try it.  Instead of chopping up some jalapeno peppers I had some leftover from a can of chopped ones.  I used close to 3 tablespoons worth.  I also reduced the amount of black pepper a little to around 1/2 tablespoon.  Instead of rolling the meatballs out I used my larger sized cookie scoop to scoop on the mixture.  Baking time was right on.  Thanks!

Hmmm,I wouldn't exactly call them 'tantalizing', okay I made a few changes, used shredded pepper jack cheese in place of blue. and used 1 whole egg, other than that, the same. I don't think I'll make it again.

Very moist and pretty tasty. A little too much going on for my personal taste, though. I think I'd probably cut back on the herbs / italian seasoning a bit to let the other flavor (jalepeno / garlic / onion) stand out a bit more. They cooked up nicely per directions. Were moist enough to eat without sauce. Doubled the batch to throw half in the freezer. Reviews about being too moist to handle are understandable, but I used a cookie scoop onto a plate, then just picked up with wet hands to handle very little (just round out a bit more). Wouldn't have worked nearly as nicely with just a spoon and my hands. Highly recommend the cookie dough scoop if you have one. Else, try to one-handed drop spoonfuls onto a ceramic plate and then pick up the spoonful to shape so you're not handling utencils and meatballs at the same time. Too messy.

I doubled the garlic AND blue cheese.  Also, broiled the meatballs on high for the last couple of minutes to get them a little crispier and brown.   Served on hoagie buns, drizzled with buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese dressing.. they were awesome!

Pretty good!  I cut back a bit on the jalapenos bc I'm not so fond of them.  Instead of pulsing them with the garlic and onions then mixing it into the turkey by hand, I just tossed everything, turkey and all, into the food processor and mixed it that way.  Worked really well, especially since I halved the recipe.  I made both meatballs and a couple of turkey burgers (fried on stovetop) bc I was in the mood for a sandwich this evening.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made a double batch of these because my husband loves meat.  So glad I did since my 15-year-old daughter ate about 10 of them!  (My 13-year-old daughter is impressed that she ate blue cheese!)  Loved the spicy flavor and will add more jalepenos next time (I used one fresh and part of a can of chopped).  I paired these with the sweet-sour broccoli salad from this site...very good.  Thanks!

These where wonderful. My husband, Chef, loved it. Impressed on how moist they where. Told me to keep this recipe and make them again. I did doubled the blue cheese, and glad I did. Served them over angel hair pasta with sun dried tomato alfrado sauce. Sprinkled with crumbled blue cheese, to add just a hit more of the blue cheese flavor. My husband and I like spice, but these were not spicy at all. My 2 year old ate them. Those who don't like spice, DON'T cut the Jap out. To help reduce the spice in the Japs make sure you clean them well. Cut all of the white membrane out and all the seeds. That's where alot of the spice is. If you're nervous about how much spice they might give, put one in and not two. If you cut them out you're going to take away one of the flavor elements that make these meatballs so good.

Great recipe, i added 2x the blue cheese to give it more flavor,  and 2x the bred crumbs,and made spaghetti with my from scratch tomatoe sauce with asparagus. I also used white pepper instead of black as i do with any turkey recipe, and i added a fair amount of hot sauce. It was absolutly delicious. I really enjoyed the recipe and will definetly make it again. I have cooked with gound turkey a lot and have never gotten my dishes to come out as moist as these balls. I would definetly rotate the balls often while in the oven to keep them from sticking to to pan.

Yummy! I did change the recipe up just a bit. I used two whole eggs instead of 3 egg whites. Almost double the breadcrumbs. Omitted the jalapenos and doubled the blue cheese. Drizzled balsamic reduction over these. Yum!

Yum! These were really good and stayed moist. I was  little worried as I don't do spicy food but the jalapeno wasn't overpowering at all. I made it with the quick and easy alfredo sauce from this site and my husband already wants me to make it again. Only thing- I forgot to spray the foil. Don't do this- I lost the bottom half of all of the meatballs!

I don't eat red meat so this was a recipe I was real excited to come across. This tastes fantastic; however I made several small changes. First, I increased the cooking temp to 425 F and since I like my meatballs browned well, I kept them in the oven for closer to 30 - 35 minutes. Perfect! I also added 1/2 cup more bread crumbs because it really helped the meatballs form better. I think the next time I make it, I'll make these other changes too: add maybe 1-2 more tbsp of blue cheese because it was very, very mild, but my husband thought it was just right. I will also use only 2 egg whites instead of 3, because it tended to get pretty runny and difficult to form. I served it on a bed of pasta and speghetti sauce last night; my husband reheated it tonight to make a spectacular meatball sandwich. Great recipe!

These are great! I have made them about four times now. Its hard to tell you are eating turkey. We like to have them with a basic spaghetti sauce, pasta, mozzarella cheese, and fresh cilantro on top.

Goat cheese can be substituted for the blue cheese. I also agree with others to substitue one egg for the 3 egg whites and cut back the pepper to 2 teaspoons from a tablespoon.

I'm sorry. This is tasty, but nowhere near as good as the rave reviews make it seem. The "4" is the median between the "3" (IMHO) as written & the probable 4.5 - 5 (in our household) after several adjustments. I tried a small batch as originally written (except for the jalapenos & huge slug of black pepper) & concur w/ those who found the cheese flavor drowned out & mix too juicy. Bread crumbs, doubling garlic & tripling the blue cheese (to heaping a 1/2 C) helped, but even then we found the cheese to be only a subtle background hint. I'll make this again, increasing the blue cheese by another 25 - 50% and tweaking the seasonings a bit. It is a keeper, no doubt, but an expensive one with turkey and so much blue cheese. Still, my sincere kudos to the inspired originator - Meatballs ala Buffalo Wings are a great idea!

Awesome recipe. I used one whole egg instead of the three egg whites and just under a cup of bread crumbs and they turned out great!! Spicy foods aren't at the top of my list but my boyfriend loves hot and spice and these were the perfect compromise. Will definitely make again!

Very good meatballs, but way too much garlic in my opinion.  I used four regular-sized cloves and while they are pretty tasty, you smell like garlic for hours afterwards.  I'd use half as much.

Absolutely loved this recipe! I found when making these the first time that the mixture was very wet even before adding the fats. I ended up using one whole egg and a white (and no olive oil) and added an extra 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.  I put everything together in my food processor in a time pinch and it seemed to work really well for making a well-mixed meatballs. I also took the advice of another commenter and baked my meatball sin muffin cups - great idea!

Taste wise these were pretty good but they were too mushy and didn't have enough substance to stand up to a good sauce and noodles.  My husband expecially didn't like the mushy texture.

It was very good.  But I have to agreed with the other person that mentioned the black pepper.  This has to be an error.  The flavor is great and then wham, you hit by the pepper!  I would recommend much less so you can maybe taste the other flavors in the meatball.  Will try again next time!  Great start of a recipe though!

These were super tasty!  I didnt have jalapenos, so I left them out and added a sprinkle of Tony Chachere seasoning.  Also doubled the bead crumbs, and cut the pepper in half as previous reviews had suggested.  SO GOOD!

I don't think I'll ever make meatballs any other way again.  Deee-lish!  I couldn't quite fit all the meatballs on one sheet, so I sauteed the rest in hamburger form - and ate BOTH! Thanks so much!

I would give this a 5 but the entire family hated it (except for me).  Even my 8 yo who eats everything put in front of him said, "I am not up for these meatballs, mom."  My half Italian husband said his grandmother was rolling in her grave...I think they were great, my family is not adventerious, but I'm working on them!

Very good.....DH and I loved these.... even my 2 yr. old inhaled, while my 10 yr old asked for a grilled cheese! They were very moist and flavorful. I used 2 egg whites instead of 3, added more bread crumbs, and used fresh parsley instead of dried. Will make again!

This is a very good recipe for meatballs, and even more so for turkey meatballs.  I didn't have blue cheese on hand, so I used Parmesan cheese instead.  (Although, I would like to use blue cheese in the future.) I used 1 whole egg instead of the egg whites.    I did use the jalapeno pepper(fresh not pickled/canned), and it gave it an interesting and wonderful zip.  I am thinking if they are too spicy for some, one can use mild green chilies as a few people have already substituted, or even possibly one can use mild bell pepper too.
Thanks for a tasty alternative to the run of the mill & sometimes bland recipes I often see for meatballs.  I am pondering using ground beef the next time instead of turkey,.....  ;o)

These were a bit dry. I even had them stewing in marinara sauce for a bit and still dry. I didn't overcook them. Also, I would add salt or more soy sauce. I don't think I would make these again.

These were amazing! I upped the blue cheese to a quarter cup and served with Red Hot and Ranch dressing on slider buns. Yum! I will definitely make them again. My ground turkey was still a little frozen which made the raw meatballs easy to handle.

I have made this recipe a few times and it just gets better and better.  I don't add all the eggs, the peppers or the full amount of pepper.  It's even better when you freeze that for later and they make great lunch options.
Oh yes and if you use a small muffin tin pan makes a big difference when cooking them.

I made this for an easy lunch option for the week.  I added some zucchini I had in the freezer for some vegie.  It was easy and the combo of blue cheese and jalapeno give this a great flavor with just a little bite.

These were really good and I'm glad I doubled the recipe.  If you want to take some sting out of the peppers, clean well and soak in 7-UP (not diet) from 45 min up to 2 hrs.  The longer you soak the milder they get.  Most of the time 45 min will suffice.  Don't drink the 7-Up afterwards.  You will not enjoy your meal if you do.

Love this recipe, been making it for years~  I also only use 1 tsp of pepper.  I also use only 1 tablespoon of soy and add 1 tablespoon of Worcestershire.

Tried for second time this week, this time making smaller meatballs, which were ready about 10 min earlier. Added finely minced celery and carrot as I'm always trying to sneak in veggies for my finicky kids. Also tuned down the Italian seasoning by a tsp with no big loss of flavor as I felt it was a bit overpowering with the full tablespoon. Overall still turned out well. Recipe appears to be quite forgiving with all the tweaks! Thanks!

I need to tweak this one...will try other turkey meatballs on this website first.  Not sure if I needed more soy sauce, or cheese, maybe onions...I'm not that sharp of a cook yet :)

I used less pepper than called for - the listed amount seems like a lot. The blue cheese flavor isn't overpowering and I used more than the listed amount. Next time I'll use more. I put these on white rice covered with bechamel sauce. I'll make these again - thanks.

I have never had a turkey meatball, so I was a little nervous. I omitted the jalapeños and served the meatballs with a pasta and white wine sauce....it was DELICIOUS! Will make again.

I had some ground turkey to use up and these sounded like a good option. I skipped the jalapeños. Like many others, I used less ground pepper. My husband, who doesn't really care for ground turkey said they had lots of flavor and would eat them again. Myself, I found they had a bit of an after taste. I'm going to try incorporating honey mustard, a favorite flavor of mine.

Quick, easy, tasty. These are the best kinds of recipes. Thank you for this recipe. I will definitely use this again. Big hit with the family. The only thing I deviated from was the egg whites. I used one whole egg.

Used herb olive oil, and only used 1.5 Tbsp, used free range local eggs, and doubles the parsley. These were amazing! Moist, stuck together well, tasted DIVINE! I did not have blue cheese, so I mixed half Feta Cheese and half Gorgonzola cheese. These are a favorite of ours now! :)

Made these as written, and overall it was a pretty easy recipe.  I used a little Cuisinart food processor, which worked great for the mincing.  Flavor was good, but I feel like it needs some sort of sauce to go with it. Not sure what the best choice for that would be, but I tried a wasabi cream sauce and that was fine for someone who likes wasabi. They didn't really hold their shape well after cooking -- they became more like little slider patties than balls.  That could be a good use for them, too!  Maybe more breadcrumbs would make them hold their shape better?

I didn't make this recipe as meatballs. I used all the ingredients except the breadcrumbs, eggs and jalapeños. I cooked it all in a pan then tossed with ziti. The recipe was great except 1tb of black pepper is way too much, maybe 1tsp will do.

I served this over spaghetti squash with marinara sauce; these meatballs are delicious and flavorful.
I used chives instead of onions because that's what I had on hand, but other than that, I followed the recipe precisely. I will definitely make again.

My 10 and 13 year old sons made these for me. They doubled the bread crumbs and doubled the cheese. They were delicious! This will be a regular dish in our house. Very easy to make.

Really great.  New favorite meatball for my family.  I used half the black pepper, poblano peppers (equal to 2 jalapenos), and feta cheese instead of blue cheese. I'll probably add half again as much cheese next time.

The finished product could have been spicier and even used more blue cheese.  Next time, we will add more jalapenos, maybe even some crushed red pepper, I will use whole eggs to bind them better than just egg whites, add a little more soy or salt, and add more blue cheese.  All in all, a quick and easy meaball recipe that we will be serving up at the Super Bowl party this weekend!

Wasn't too thrilled with these. The texture was like meatloaf which my hubs doesn't care for but at least it wasn't dry. It also need some salt.

Awesome recipe! We have cooked over and over, and it is one of my husband's favorites.  Even my picky brother, who swears he does not like blue cheese, loved this recipe and devoured them.  Will definitely cook again and again.

Not great, weak on flavor and poor in consistency as well. I ended up making a white sauce to make them useful for a dinner but I was just not impressed. Would not make these again.

Absolutely amazing! So tasty and not overly blue cheese flavor at all, just enhances them. They are extremely moist because of the amount egg whites that are used which makes it difficult to form a meatball, BUT don't let that scare you, because they turn out perfect just the way the recipe states. I serve them with a pasta pomodora dish and its a perfect compliment.

Just made these today.  Only had 1 jalapeno, so I did not seed it.  Used Italian Bread Crumbs, as that was what I had in my cupboard.  Flavor was excellent.  The only thing I would change is the amount of black pepper. I am a pepper fan, but 1 tbsp for a lb of meat was a bit much.

We loved these meatballs.  The jalapeno gives them a nice bite.  I reduced the amount of black pepper to 1/2 teaspoon and added additional breadcrumbs to get the consistency I wanted.  If you spray the aluminum foil with PAM (or similar product), they won't stick.

My husband and I both loved this!  I was worried about the jalepenos, but even my 4 year old could handle them.  I thought it was a bit much pepper for my taste.  The blue cheese was awesome. The meatballs do stick to the tin foil and I would let them cool for about 5 mins before taking them off.  They might be pretty good with a white sauce, but we loved them AS IS.

I made this recipe for some friends who are both excellent cooks.  They were wowed!  I made homemade marinara sauce (from the Everyday Italian cookbook) added the cooked meatballs, and served over linguine-FABULOUS!  One of the best meals I've ever prepared, and I am a recipe nut!

I really liked this recipe! I just  changed a little bit of things to fit my family. We dont really like groud turkey so we subed ground hamburger, no peppers, put in WAY more blue cheese, and cut the black pepper. Thanks for the start!

These came out rather spicy for our tastes and that was after eliminating the jalapeno.  Maybe cutting the black pepper by half would help.  Other than the spice they tasted alright, but could not taste the blue cheese.

tasty, tasty! yes, made a few adjustments due to what i had on hand. used crushed red pepper flakes rather than the jalapeno... also added Worcestershire sauce. and used 3 eggs for 2.5lbs of ground turkey. (other amount adjustments based on amount of turkey). Also used a ice cream scoop to make big meatballs... they took about 30 min to cook through. My husband came home and was knocked over by the wonderful smells coming from the kitchen. Several meatballs were consumed before we ever sat down for dinner. A definite winner!!

I love these!  They have the best flavor!  I omitted the jalapenos because I'm not a super spicy fan, and cut way back on the pepper.  I halfted the recipe and added 1 whole egg because it's easier.  Other than that, I left things pretty much the same. Delicious!  I pair with spaghetti and marinara, and top with parmesan cheese.  Will make over and over!

Scrumptious. For anyone sharing my sincere adoration for all things cheese, I used closer to a cup of blue cheese crumbles. Absolutely scrumptious!

I made these tonight for the first time and they are very flavorful... just a bit of a kick!!  I am always looking for new inventive ways to make a burger, so we actually squashed the meatballs a bit and made miniture hamburger buns from a recipe on this site... topped it all off with a few slices of avacado and they were wonderful!  My kids even loved them.  I will defininitley be making them again.

I liked these, but they weren't a huge hit with the family. I was expecting more of a "bite" with the blue cheese and jalapeno. One thing I should have done differently was chopping the pepper and onion. My food processor is needing a part, so I did it by hand, and the pieces were too big. That may have been the biggest turn off for the kids.

I made these last evening and they were delicious -- I doubt they could turn out bad!  My husband ate much more than he should have!  I had a larger package of ground turkey, so I just increased the other ingredients, used a can of chopped chiles instead of fresh and no egg whites (was out of eggs).  I am having the leftovers for lunch today.  Keep up the good work creating delicious recipes.  Will look for more.

This recipe was a wonderful surprise! I like turkey but don't love it so I am always looking for recipes that jazz it up and boy is this the one.  Upon first reading the recipe I thought what an odd combination of ingredients, blue cheese, soy sauce and chili powder, I just had to try it.  The only changes I made was I didn't have any jalapeno but did have a hot cherry pepper so used that instead, reduced the black pepper to 1 tsp. as per other reviewers.  I also used two whole eggs instead of the 3 egg whites (didn't see the need).  I baked exactly as stated and they were very moist.  Served the leftovers to an unexpected lunch guest the next day and she had to have the recipe!  Smithey if you are creating great recipes like this at 15 I hope you pursue a culinary career and maybe see you on the FoodNetwork in the next  ten years.

As a newly diagnosed diabetic I've been trying to find recipes that make the life change less of a shock.  I found this and made it last night, cutting the recipe to feed just my wife and me, and we were both crazy about it.  We read the very helpful comments first, which prompted me to double the blue cheese and drastically reduce the black pepper.  It was perfect, so I'd say that was good advice.  This will probably be on our table a few times every month from here on out. Thank you to the person who posted it and to everyone else for comments that made a big difference.  I just found this site and it's batting a thousand.

these were excellent!  i didn't have any jalepenos on hand, so I left them out.  Also added more blue cheese - to finish out the package I had.  Very delicious.  A tasty new way to eat turkey.

Sorry guys...I was really looking forward to this dinner but was not impressed. Followed recipe exactly for one exception, I doubled blue cheese...which I barely tasted. Also, just like many other reviewers...the mixture was to wet and I had to add additional bread crumbs as well. It was a bit bland for me. I'm glad I attempted it but we won't be making this again. =(

These meatballs are absolutely amazing!  I made them exactly as the recipe said and they turned out perfectly.  I paired them with a homemade roasted red pepper spaghetti sauce!  PERFECTION! Thank you for posting this recipe!

Made exactly as directed, the meatballs were absolutely delicious. However, the mixture was very wet and so it was difficult to shape it into balls. I ended up having to add more bread crumbs than the recipe called for. I would recommend cutting back on the oil, as this seemed to be part of the reason the balls wouldn't shape correctly. I substituted blue cheese with feta. Great recipe, thanks for sharing it!

A. MAZ. ING!   beautiful recipe.  Only change I made was add a teaspoon of salt and put 5 tablespoons of blue cheese instead of 3.   I made a sauce using spaghetti sauce, red pepper flakes, and a dash of cayenne pepper.  Sooooooo good!

Wow. Amazing.  I did not change one thing. Everyone should try it before changing it.  I can't think of anything to make it better!  Thanks!   But yes, please do use non stick pan or really spray your foil because they will stick.

Yup. Loved these. Deducted a star because I thought it needed more blue cheese and less soy sauce. I used serranos instead of jalapenos and I'm glad I did. Used one whole egg instead of the whites. Like other reviewers I was concerned the pre-baked mix was too loose and wet but the finished meatballs turned out to be a very nice texture. I tried the mini-muffin pan baking suggestion and will never do that again. Made a mess, the fat and melted cheese spilled all over the sides of the wells. Only do that if you have extremely low-fat turkey, and I was using 93%. Next time I will bake them on a rack over a foil lined pan. Served with Herbed Noodles and Green Bean and Mushroom Medley, both on this site. Fabulous dinner!

My boyfriend just raved about these meatballs.  It was a big hit.  I did not change anything about the recipe as it needed no change.  It was flavorful and so simple to make.  It was a bit mushy at the make the meatball stage, but it was not big problem and once they baked it was fine.  I use Panko for the breadcrumb part.  If it calls for breadcrumbs of any kind, it is panko for me.  You can find it in the oriental food aisle.

OMG! My family loved them. After reading the reviews I did cut back on the soy and I used the 24 muffin tray to bake them. They came out great and moist. Since I did not have blue cheese I used the feta cheese. Will cook again and more of them for my kids and husband.

I have made these twice, and the only changes I made were to double the amount of blue cheese (because my fiance loves it so much) and I use 1.2 lbs of ground turkey breast (because that is what is packaged at the store).  I think by using the turkey breast it is still juicy without being too mushy since there is virtually no fat.  Other users have mentioned that their meatballs were too moist.  I also spray Pam on a 24 count mini muffin pan (per the suggestion by another member) and use approx. 2 in meatballs.  It has come out perfectly every time with 24 evenly sized meatballs.  I serve with collard greens and garlic and olive oil vermicelli by Rice a Roni and it is amazing.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!!

Ok, this was yummy!  I've made this twice in two weeks and it's a huge hit with family.  I changed the amount of pepper used to about 1/4tsp, cut the olive oil to 1 tbsp, cut the eggs down to 2 and I added more breadcrumbs. I didn't make meatballs because the mix was still too moist to hold the shape I needed.  So instead I put them into a muffin pan that holds 12 cooked at 375 for 25 mins.  I topped mine with spaghetti sauce the first time and brown gravy the second time. No leftovers with this one!

to die for.   make sure you buy good turkey meat.  some can have bone parts, you want to avoid those off brands.  Enjoy.

what a great versatile recipe!!!! I read all the previous reviews & decided to increase the bread crumbs a quarter & decrease the olive oil by half & the black pepper by half. Used pablano peppers instead of jalepeno. I had no problems w/mixing them or w/them sticking to the foil. I used cooking spray.  They were not dry & they were full of great flavor. Used them w/red sauce & on their own . . . great any way you serve them. Highly recommend this recipe!!!!!

These are awesome.  Especially for turkey. Not dry at all.  I subbed feta for cheese.  Next time I will try the blue cheese.  I forgot how good this was until I unfroze the leftovers. Yum! Update- I tried blue cheese.  Stick with the feta...blue cheese was too powerful.

With all the different ingredients in this recipe I thought it was going to be awful, but the Blue Cheese part of it made me give it a try.  Wow, this is really fantastic.  It has so much flavor. I will make this again.

These were extremely good and I got rave reviews from my husband and a friend who stopped by for dinner.  I will make them again!!  Instead of turkey, I used a butcher's meat loaf mix (1/2 beef & 1/2 pork).  I used jalapenos from the jar instead of fresh, but other than that everything was as stated.

These meatballs were wonderful. The meatballs I make are normally dry and bland. The blue cheese was a great touch and they turned out moist.

These meatballs were very tasty. I didn't have bread crumbs so I used wheat germ instead, I also used less pepper. I roasted some pasilla chiles and added the meatballs and a slice of lite jack cheese inside the chile, then put back in the oven for about 5-10 minutes to melt the cheese. These came out so good, just a little spicy. These meatballs will definitely be made again for spaghetti or meatball sandwiches. Good job! Also, I didn't want the meatballs to stick on the foil so I sprayed muffin tins with nonstick spray and just scooped a heaping tablespoon into each muffin spot. They did not stick and came out perfect

This is a great recipe. I made it today and we loved it. I used chicken instead of turkey because we prefer it. I used 2 whole eggs instead of messing with the separating. Subbed Worcestershire for the soy sauce. I thought it would be a lot of pepper, but it was fine. Left out the chili powder but I will give it a try next time. Because I am lazy, I made 4 inch patties instead of 2 inch balls and just cooked a little longer. This one will get made a lot!!!
