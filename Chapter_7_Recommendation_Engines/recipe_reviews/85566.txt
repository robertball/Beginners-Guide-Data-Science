These are yummy, I made them as a side to my chowder. We really enjoyed them. Because of the previous review I skipped broiling the bread by itself and broiled it only with egg mixture. It came out nicely brown and crunchy.

This is a very nice appetizer recipe, however, the bread burned badly the first time I made these. I would recommend not broiling/toasting the bread first. I have made this recipe about 6 times, it is one of my fav. appetizer recipes. I have also made these w/o the bread, and used mini-muffin pans that were VERY WELL greased (otherwise the cheese really sticks, I learned the hard way!).

I just made this but adapted the recipe a bit. I took a stale French loaf and cut it into four pieces then split the four piece over the length.  Next I hollowed the pieces out to end with mainly the crust and made sure to leave edges in the short ends.  I lightly dabbed some English mustard into the bases.  I doubled the eggs and the cheese but kept the rest of the dry ingredients the same. I added 1/4 teaspoon of dried chili flakes. I whisked the egg whites and folded 75% of the cheese into this.  Next I whisked the egg yellows and painted the bread well with it to supply some seal to the base.  I scooped the egg white mixture into the hollowed bread and filled every one level. Next I garnished some shredded cheese on top of this.  I did not pre-toast the bread based on another comment I read earlier and it is the better plan.  I pre-heated the oven normally to 175 degrees C and then switched it over to grill. Placed the bread in the middle on a baking tray and grilled until the bread edges went dark brown and the cheese puffed high.  Garnished with some basil leaves and enjoy.  I am sure some chopped bacon and shredded tomato on the base will make a good variant.

I toasted one side of the bread, spooned the cheese mixture onto the untoasted side, then broiled as directed. Turned out great. I liked it even better with some thinly sliced tomato. Thanks, BEC!

Not sure what these taste like, I charred them to a crisp following the directions. I even took the advice of another review and didn't toast the bread beforehand.  I must not have much luck with my broiler or the directions need to be edited
