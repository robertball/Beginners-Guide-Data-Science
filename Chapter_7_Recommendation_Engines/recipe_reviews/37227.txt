This receipe is great. I tried it with a bit of variation. I omitted the nuts and did not put the sauce in the blender and it still tasted great. We will definitely be doing this again.

EXCELLENT chicken recipe - tender, sweet, tangy sauce.  Substitute Golden Delicious for a slightly weaker apple flavor.  Extra garlic adds a little tang.

I LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I made it for 10 people and they ALL adored it.  However, make sure you are good at handling a lot of things at once.  This recipe takes time and patience, but in my eyes it was well worth it!

I have to admit to not being too sure about this recipe as I was making it.  Perhaps it had everything to do with the fact that I was making it for the first time for a dinner party.  However, it was a real hit with my guests.  I omitted the walnuts, used black forest ham instead of the country ham and only used about 1/4 tsp saffron instead of the required 1/2.  I'll definitely make it again.

Very tasty.  It is a bit time consuming but well worth the effot.  Omitted the saffron (didn't have any) and the walnuts (personal preference).  Also used thin sliced Boars Head ham from the deli - easy and not too salty.

This came with mixed reviews, some liked the sweet with the meat others were turned off by the combination

This recipe definately was not worth the trouble and time it took to make.  I really did not like the consistancy of the sauce either.

I originally made this 5 years years ago for my boyfriend.  I forgot the name of the recipe, and I just never got around to hunting for it until today.  My boyfriend will be so happy becasue he has been asking me to make this again for the last 5 years!  It really made an impression on him.

Very tasty!!  I used turkey bacon instead of ham, a little extra garlic, no saffron, and I didn't blend or use a food processor.  I also used long wooden skewers cut in half for the wooden pricks and cooked the chicken in a wok. Takes time to make, so I may only make on special occasions.
