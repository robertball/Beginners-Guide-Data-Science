Very good!  I made them with a few modifications: I didn't have Hershey's brand, so I used a different cocoa (a bit sweeter, and far more expenisve) and they turned out a bit sweeter than I like.  Also, I didn't add sliced almonds, but coarsely chopped almonds--this was ok, but next time I think I will chop them a bit finer--when cutting the biscotti, this made it difficult to cut and when the knife snagged an almond piece it wanted to tear the cookie.  My advice: make sure you use a VERY sharp, serated bread knife! And make sure you wait to slice the logs--15 minutes was good (but who are they kidding when they say "discard the ends?" Puh-LEEZE! at my house, we fight over these pieces!

I also didn't use the "frosting" suggested because, well, hey, this isn't how we eat biscotti in Italy, this is an American thing.  And I don't like to eat shortening, anyway.

And, never say you ate one Biscotti--biscotti is plural; one is a "biscotto"
:)
Sono Buoni Buoni! 
Ciao!

The baking times or temperatures are wrong...
the "logs" were not cooked enough, but the outside was too hard to cut without everything falling apart.  I make about 10 kinds of biscotti every holiday and this was the only failure I've had.  Could the "facts" be checked?

Please note that this recipe has a higher oven temperature.  I followed it and the biscotti burned.  They were supposed to be for a birthday so I was dissapointed.  I followed another separate recipe, 25 less, and the biscotti were fine.

I made this recipe twice and was disappointed both times. The cookies crumbled when I attempted to slice them for the 2nd baking process. I  salvaged approximately 1 dozen for entertaining; otherwise, the remaining crumbs were tossed out.

These were great. Easy to make. I didn't glaze them. Everyone was too much in a hurry to eat them.  Just dusted them with powdered sugar. They stored well in a covered container. They were still great after a week.

This is a good biscotti recipe.  I used vanilla instead of almond extract and chopped pecans instead of almonds (it's what I had on hand) I also didn't dip them in chocolate, I always just sprinkle one side with sifted powdered sugar.  We loved them!

Fairly easy to make, but they came out chewey rather than crunchy... Different, good, but not the hard crisp biscotti you get at the coffee stands.

This was a wonderful recipe! I have never made biscotti before and these turned out great. I only dipped the top half of the biscotti in the dark chocolate and then drizzled on the white chocolate over them, and they look really great. My friends ate them up and all want the recipe. I will surly make this recipe again!!

Love it, love it, LOVE IT!!!  Rarely do I do recipes off this site without some sort of modification but I followed this one to a 'T' as I have never made biscotti before and most of the reviews were good.  Well I am very impressed!  These were so good and pretty easy to make.  Even the baking times were perfect...don't change a thing!!!

Easy to make but ordinary in look and taste. Whole or coarsely chopped almonds would look better.

This looks and tastes like expensive gourmet biscotti but is so easy to make.  Great dipped in coffee or cappucino.  Very chocolatey and good.

Very pretty and decorative.  One of those treats you just have to taste after seeing. Very appealing to the eye.  Taste very good.  Truely a different type of pastry treet.  Very crunchy.

These Biscotti are DELICIOUS!  I added some mini chocolate chips to the batter for extra flavour and they tasted even better.  I made these last year for a cookie exchange - big success. P.S.  The ends of the logs should never be discarded...they go great dipped in a cup of coffee as you continue baking the biscotti.

I had never made biscotti before and this was my first try.  I think they came out super and they are very yummy.  I am reluctant to give any away!  I did not, however, glaze/frost them in any way.  I find that they are delicious on their own.  I will definitely be making these again.
