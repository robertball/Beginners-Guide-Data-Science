I really liked the concept behind this recipe, but the flavor just wasn't there.  These carrots were way too sweet, and the glaze would have covered at least 2 pounds of carrots.  I would have to tweak this recipe to make it something I would cook again because of the sweetness.

A friend made this as a side dish for our pot luck Christmas dinner ... YUM!  She used pecans instead of hazelnuts and thinly sliced onion.  Definitely a keeper.

Yum!  Cooked carrots never tasted so good.  I doubled the recipe but used less butter than called for.  I cooked the sauce for a good 20 minutes to try and thicken but it didn't seem to...?  Didn't matter though, 100% delicious flavor.  My mother didn't even want to try but I insisted... she asked for the recipe and said she doesn't like carrots but really liked these and knows she should eat them! I will keep this recipe for sure.  Thanks!

LOVE THIS! I made it for Thanksgiving dinner, and it was a big hit. I was skeptical while I was cooking the sauce, but once I tasted it, I knew I had a winner. I used sliced almonds instead of hazelnuts. Delicious, will DEFINITELY make again.

Used carrots chopped into medallions. Also used vegan margarine instead of butter. Oh, and used pecans instead of hazelnuts (as mentioned by another reviewer) as I couldn't find hazelnuts at the store (didn't look terribly hard though). As a few have mentioned, the marsala mix wasn't really a glaze as much as a sauce. Still very good!

Barbara, we thought your recipe was fabulous! Everyone went back for seconds and thirds and just raved. The only thing I did differently was to use brown sugar instead of white and altho I didn't read it until now, I'm loving another reviewers suggestion of adding a bit of heat. Next time for sure. Thank you again Barbara!

I loved this! Best carrot recipe I've ever had. I substituted splenda for the sugar. I didn't measure the water either..just covered the carrots with water since they were going to be drained anyway.

This is an excellent, easy recipe. In halving the recipe for two, one shallot was a bit much. I might even reduce to 1/2 a shallot when splitting the recipe. Overall though, just yummy. Might even be good with fresh, frenched green beans - not overly cooked.

This was delish! I didn't have hazelnuts  but will get them for next time because I love them, but pecans worked well. I also didn't have shallots so I used vidalia onion with a touch of garlic minced together and that worked out fine. Didn't have unsalted, so I used salted butter. There is a lot of sauce and I though about cutting back on those ingredients next time, but it coats the carrots well this way. All those little chunks soaking up that heavenly sauce.  In any case, no complaints, I will be making this alot!
Oh  yeah.. This says it serves 6. I think that's being conservative, realistically it's more like 4 servings. DH and I ate at LEAST half of this, 
(1 regular serving each)in one sitting.  Total Yumfort Food!

They are indeeed spectacular! I am not real big on cooked carrots but I loved these (as did my husband). The only changes I made to the recipe were to scale it down to 3 servings (hubby & I ate them all! LOL)& to not cut my carrots in half...I left them whole. The glaze is absolutely wonderful... thanks  Barbara M.!

This really lived up to it's name! I didn't change a thing and my husband (who is really picky about carrots) and I both absolutely loved it. Perfect! Thank you for a lifetime keeper.

Very tasty! I didn't have hazelnuts so I chopped up almonds and toasted those. I also added a little bit of cornstarch to the pan before adding the carrots to thicken the sauce.

We loved these. The Marsala sauce was very nice and I loved the addition of the hazelnuts. Nice presentation when garnished with parsley. Thanks for sharing Barbara.

I don't like cooked carrots but needed a vegetable for Thanksgiving so I made this recipe based on the ratings here and that proved to be a good move.  This recipe is great, I will make this again and give it to my niece to use in her new business of personal chef for home gatherings

This is one of the best carrot recipes I have ever tried. I took these to dinner at my in-laws' house. My father-in-law hates carrots, but he loved the hazelnuts. My mother-in-law hates nuts, but she loved the carrots. Every one else ate them together and loved them. The hazelnuts took longer to roast than the recipe indicated, but I started them early enough that it wasn't a problem. I will definitely make these again.

This was....ok. Good but not great. I was excited to try this recipe but the glaze would not get to a glazing consistancy. Too liquid. And the flavor was not exciting. Sorry... not my cup of tea.

I wasn't sure how this would turn out, but it was fantastic.  The smokiness and crunchiness of the hazelnuts offset the sweetness of the carrots perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!

My wife and I loved this recipe. Certainly a change from the typical butter and brown sugar routine. The Marsala Wine is what makes this recipe what it is. Do not skip it as the description states. It is  delicious!

Served this at Thanksgiving and both guests asked for the recipe.  Super easy to prepare and the taste was great.  Watch for the hazelnuts when toasting.  I liked the sweet and crunchy texture and the Marsala adds a perfect amount of flavor.

Hello carrots, I think I am in love!!  I cut back the sugar for the glaze and used regular carrots and found this to be an extraordinary vegetable dish.  I paired it with phyllo-wrapped halibut filets from this site and roasted asparagus.  Superb!

I thought these were delicious!  I used regular carrots and cut them into "halved baby carrot" size, and I used salted butter so omitted the salt.  My hazelnuts turned out to be old, so I used chopped toasted pecans.  AND I reached for the marsala and we were out!  So I used sherry.  In spite of all of that, it was a great veggie dish, marsala is on my grocery list, and I'll make it again!  Thanks so much, Barbara!

Wonderful, quick recipe!  Absolutely delicious!  The best glazed carrots I've ever had!  Unlike the other reviewer, my child loved it.  I'll be sure to use this one for a holiday get-together!

I was looking for a gluten free side dish recipe for a pot luck.  This sounded good, so I made it and hoped for the best!  It was amazing, and several people asked for the recipe.  I followed the recipe almost completely, switching out the hazelnuts for pecans.  It was simple and delicious!

I'm a traditional, carrots with butter type of gal, but it was nice to try something different!  

So I've made this twice.  The first time, the sauce didn't thicken and it wasn't very good--it was watery and wine-y.  My fault.  

The second time I made it, it DID thicken.  And nicely too!  I found to make it thicken I needed a pan with more surface area and higher heat for a longer time.  The sauce  gets a little darker and it's nice and sticky when it's done right.  The taste was really mild, not too sweet with just a little tang from the wine.  The guests that ate it liked the addition of the crunchy nuts (I used pecans and salted them as they roasted).  The nuts with the carrots really gives great flavor.

I tried making the carrots ahead of time and then re-heating, but that didn't work well as the nice sticky glaze became watery upon re-heating.  So...not recommended as a make-ahead thing.

So, overall, nice recipe once you get the hang of it!  Give it a try and be patient---let the sauce thicken!

The marsala glazed carrots were very good. My guests liked them a lot. They were very different from the usual carrots I make. Usually I have most of the carrots left over but there was no glazed carrots left at all. I definitely will make them again.

I went to get the Marsala, only to find I'd bought two bottles of sherry, and no Marsala.  But I had hazelnut liqueur, so I used that instead.  I just tipped some sugar in, probably only a couple of tablespoons, and it was amazing!  My husband, who doesn't like cooked carrots, went back for seconds!  Definitely a keeper!

Excellent side dish, this is a keeper.  I reduced the amount of sugar to 2 tablespoons and it was plenty sweet.  May reduce it to just one tablespoon next time.  I was unable to get hazelnuts so substituted pecans.  I think toasted almonds would be good too.

Tasty  for a side dish.

I like my meals prepared quickly so I cheat by using GRILL MATES SWEET MESQUITE AND CARAMEL ONION packaged sauce mix.: to baby sweet carrots and raw fresh green beans  Add a touch of minced pistachios or walnuts.  But that's just me.

Everyone has seconds everytime I make this dish!  I have used almonds and pecans when I don't have hazelnuts and it tastes good too.  It does make alot of yummy sauce but we get creative with the leftovers so we don't mind.

I first made this recipe as written and found it to be a little too sweet. The second time I made it I used 1/4 cup of sugar and squeezed 1/2 an orange in the glaze instead and it was delicious.  I am going to substitute slivered almonds and brown sugar in this recipe next time.

This dish was simply delicious and a huge hit this Thanksgiving. I logged on today so that I could pass the recipe on to friends that asked for it after trying it last night! I did make a couple of minor (& accidental) changes: I used a semi-sweet Marsala instead of dry and vidalia onions with a smidgen of garlic powder instead of shallots. A dry Marsala would have been better  but semi-sweet didn't take away from the dish. My only complaint is the dish is more labor intensive that I'd prefer for a big holiday. Nevertheless, I look forward to making this dish again!

I made these carrots last Christmas, and my family all raved about them.  My husband said they were the best carrots he has ever tasted.  They were different from most other carrot side dishes I've tried -- the hazelnuts worked great with the carrots.

I've never had Marsala wine before and wanted to try it.  Guess my family and I don't care for it.   I thought it was ok, a bit on the heavy side with the Marsala wine taste.  The toasted hazelnuts did add a nice flavor to it though, but I don't think I'll be making this dish again :(
