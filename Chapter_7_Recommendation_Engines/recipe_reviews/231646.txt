This is delicious cheesy goodness in a turkey casserole.  I made a few modifications because my spouse doesn’t care for peppers or mushrooms.  I simply substituted a carrot. Out of sheer laziness, I sautéed the celery, onion and carrot together in the butter.  It worked out fine.  Also, I used a mish-mash of different cheeses (cleaning out the frig.)  This was yummy.

This was a very tasty recipe. I brought it to a potluck and everyone was raving about it and asking for seconds. I stir fried the celery along with the other veggies to avoid another step and it was fine. The bread crumbs seemed a little dry on top maybe next time I'd add a little butter drizzled over the crumbs.

The only change I made was with the turkey.  I had thinly sliced turkey for sandwiches and used it instead of turkey breast cube.  It was delicious and  was even better when it was warmed up the next day.  Great for lunch or dinner.   Next time I make this recipe I will use cubed turkey pieces although the sandwich type turkey was really good.  It might be good to add chopped up broccoli to this recipe also.  It can be very versatile as far as adding different veggies to it.

lol I didn’t finish my initial review. I tweaked a few things. I added a cup of noodles as well as cooked and chopped bacon. To ad a little more flavour I added some chicken stock. Skipped the peppers and put in small diced carrots. Used fresh instead of canned mushrooms.

Whole family loved it. Didn't use pimento, green peppers and almonds. Sauteed celery. Next time will not add cheese/bread crumb topping. In my opinion it was just a bit too much.

It didn't thicken like a casserole.  Was like a pot pie filling but VERY delish!!  Due to my thickening problem, I served it over some leftover pasta and it was so wonderful.  The flavors were so great!  Only 4 stars due to not being a true casserole but loved just the same.

Absolutely delicious! I made a few modifications. I used fresh 1% milk not canned, sprinkled paprika on top then baked. I eliminated the breadcrumbs and topped with French’s onions on top a few minutes before it was finished. Huge hit and a great way to use your turkey leftovers. I am going to try using chicken next time which should be yummy.

I skipped boiling the  celery and cooked it with the onions. Boiling celery? Really? I skipped the canned mushrooms, because they aren't a favorite. The sauce thickened well. Be sure to cook the flour for a few minutes before adding the liquid. It was a little bland, but a great way to use up 3 cups of turkey after Thanksgiving.

We found this just ok. I thought peppers and turkey? I made it as written and the consistency was creamy/great, I served it over rice. Just not sure I liked the combination of flavors. If I fix it again, I'll try adding carrots as others mentioned.  It does seem to need something else.

I threw the celery in with the onions and pepper, instead of boiling it separately.  I also used leftover stuffing instead of the bread crumbs on top.  It was delicious, and I will keep this recipe as a favorite!

Definitely a keeper! I didn't have a jar of pimento peppers, so I left those out. I also didn't have almonds, so I didn't use those, either. I made soft bread crumbs out of a 3 cheese bread we had in the fridge and that cheese bread gave it an added something for the topping. Instead of 1/2 green pepper, I chopped up about a cup of those colorful mini-bell peppers. 
The only thing that freaked me out was the amount of butter that goes in this recipe. 5 T???? Really? I followed that, though, and the casserole was TO DIE FOR.

We will make this again!  I’m no cook and it was easy. I added carrots like the other reviewers suggested. I also made noodles.  Mine was super thick, so next time I’ll add more milk to make it thinner. And we poured it over noodles. Great flavor - I just need to work on the consistency. Thanks for the recipe!! Loved having this recipe for leftover thanksgiving turkey!

What a great recipe for having kids eat veggies and use up all leftovers! I made a few substitutions to use up what I had: ground turkey, squash instead of flour, carrots instead of celery, and it still came out great.  The bread crumb with cheese topping gave it he perfect crunch texture.  I'm glad I softened the carrots in the beginning wither full 10 minutes, but I should've added the chopped onion later to avoid overcooking the onion.  Next time I'm going to put in the ground turkey right after the mushroom soup and milk so that it cooks a tad more though.  I'm going to stock up on mushroom soup just for his recipe!

I added a few herbs and spices, and threw in a few more veggies that we like.  It was a good recipe, everyone in the house went back for seconds.

I love  this recipe. Every time we have leftover turkey, I make this. Everyone in my family that has tried it just loved it too. This irecipe is going into my recipe box. The only change I make is that I use only chopped up white meat turkey and used that in the casserole.

I used Boarshead Ichiban Teriyaki chicken , cut thick and later I cut that into cubes.  I also used Fenches crispy fried onions instead of the bread crumbs.  Super good recipe!

Very tasty! I did have to make a few changes cuz peppers are not for me but replaced with carrots, had no almonds, and I also only used about 8 oz of whole milk. Great dish though. Everyone loved it and no leftovers.

What a fabulous recipe! I followed the directions exactly, except that I added a little more turkey than called for. I did this only because I would have had to throw it out. My family loved it and we all had seconds!

Just OK. My family wasn't excited about it, it's not going in our rotation.
