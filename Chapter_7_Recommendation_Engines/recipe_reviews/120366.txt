OUTSTANDING!  This was very easy to make and delicious.  The recipe I believe has a typo in it: it says 1/2 cup of butter divided in the ingredients, but in the directions it says to melt the 1/2 cup of butter with brown sugar, flour and juice and pour over top of apricots; this is not correct.  Melt only half of the 1/2 cup (1/4 cup) of the butter in with the brown sugar, flour and juice.  Use the other 1/4 cup of butter for the cracker crumb topping.  I'll try it with peaches next time too.  HINT:  For easier cleanup use a glass dish instead of metal and use Pam spray on the bottom and especially the sides, cuts calories and hassle by not needing to grease the dish.

I made this as a hot fruit dressing for a pork roast at Easter.  It was easy enough; I used a blender to smooth the sauce because my flour stayed in lumps.  I think I would prefer just heating some apricot halves in juice, with a touch of brown sugar, and perhaps a touch of cornstarch to thicken it up.  Or just hot fruit, period.  This was all right.

It comes out looking nothing like the picture. I had friends over when I made it and they loved it, but my husband and I are not a fan of it. It would make a decent topping for an angel cake or ice cream, but in my opinion its a waste of apricots.
