This is another wonderful recipe from Robyn!  I love the unique flavor!  It has a Tuscan feel! I made a double batch and am glad I did!  I have some lunch goodies for the next week as a result!  Thanks again Robyn!

Easy to make, economical, and has a great taste! Just be warned- if you have dry rosemary instead of fresh, don't put two tablespoons of it in!

Pretty good! The only thing I changed was to add about a 1/2 tablespoon of vinegar. It lacked acidity for me. Taste it before you add the vinegar, since it may be due to the brand of tomatoes I used.  Also, if you use dried rosemary (which I did) let it simmer a little longer so the flavor can develop.

I tailored the original recipe: saute 2 cloves garlic (or more), one thinly sliced carrot, and three chopped chicken thighs in olive oil; add two cups crushed tomatoes and simmer 15 minutes; add two cups chicken broth, one can rinsed chickpeas, and a handful of chopped cilantro and simmer another 20 minutes.  An inexpensive one pot meal my husband enjoyed.  Try it with a side of cornbread.

Excellent!!  I made this because I happened to have all of the ingredients, except fresh rosemary, used 1 tsp. of dried rosemary instead.  Next time I will try fresh because I think the 1 tsp. of dried rosemary was too strong.  Best soup I have ever had, and low fat too!!

I added onion to this recipe. It was very fast and easy ( I didn't do all the simmering the recipe called for). I will make this again.

I loved this - but unfortunately mine turned out more like a pasta dish than a soup- maybe I'll add more tomatoes and juice next time. Other than that- this was perfect and healthy meal.

I love garlic, but I thought that it was too overpowering in this soup and I didn't like the chickpeas and pasta together.

so easy with ingredients already in the pantry.  Added chopped celery and needed to simmer longer until they softened.  Also instead of pasta, made a side of rice to throw in the soup, subbed dried basil for the rosemary, and used veggie stock.

I made this for my boyfriend once and he absolutely adored it. Now he makes it on his own. He's a chickpea fan. Plus the aroma from the rosemary is wonderful! Be sure to chop this herb into fine bits, tho'.

A good, simple soup.  Next time I'll reduce the garlic-personal taste.  I omitted the rosemary, added a little celery and carrot to the garlic.

Just made this for lunch.  Fantastic!  I added some chipotle powder because I like a little heat, but other than that I left it as is and it was great.

I make this recipe with a couple of twists and its one of our favorites. Smash the garlic and peel before cooking.   Cook garlic for only a minute.   Only use fresh rosemary - 3 or 4 large sprigs.   1-14oz can tomatoes 2-14oz cans BEEF broth + a bit of beef base for extra flavor. 2-19oz cans chickpeas,drained and rinsed. 6oz uncooked elbow mac or cavatappi (small round macaroni) 1/3 cup grated pecorino romano cheese Add 2 cups water with the beef broth. Mash one can of chickpeas with a fork or potato masher to add at the time you add the macaroni to cook.  Add the other can of whole chickpeas at the last minute.  Garnish with all the cheese to serve.

Simple.  I was looking for something quick and easy to make with the things I had on hand.  I had some heavy cream that I needed to use too, so I added some of that during the last step of prep.  I also didn't have any rosemary on hand, but did have basil leaves so I used two of those instead and removed them before eating.  Yummy!  I will make this again for a quick meal.

This was ok but I thought it really needed something and could not put my finger on it! I make soup all the time but this was just a little plain. I added a little hot sauce and that help a little but still not over the top!
