Let me start off by saying if you are a cake mix snob, and even more importantly a canned frosting snob, as I am, do not turn your nose up on this recipe!  It does not taste like it came from a box of cake mix nor a can of pre-made frosting.  I have served this cake to dozens of people, all of who beg me for the recipe and then mouths hit the ground when I tell them what's in it.  I just make a few minor changes from the original recipe, which is still great as-is.  I use buttermilk in place of water which makes the cake super moist and rich, as if it needs more of that!  And since I'm using buttermilk, which is heavier than water, I cut the oil back to 2/3 cup.  I also omit the pecans that go in the cake pan as I dress this cake up later with butter-rum glaze and a spiced cream cheese frosting, garnished with lots of extra pecans.  I also add a tsp. of rum flavoring into the cake batter.  Yummy!

Tasty and so very easy to make!  It took longer to bake in my oven -- a little over an hour for a toothpick inserted in center to come out clean.  I would definitely recommend allowing the cake to cool for quite a while (if not completely) in the pan.  It's very moist and may fall apart if you turn it out of the pan while it's still warm.  As suggested by other reviewers, I believe the oil and/or water could be cut just slightly to make for more manageable slicing without compromising the soft, moist texture of the cake.  Will try that next time.  Thank you -- we really enjoyed this one! :)  **Update** March '08 -- I've made this again and am bumping my rating from 4 to 5 stars.  I based 4 stars on my personal tastes.  I thought it was really good, but not quite 5-star; however, everyone else who has tried it thinks it's top shelf, especially with the caramel glaze I added.  So, I'm going with the consensus -- 5 stars!  I definitely would recommend dropping the oil and water back by a couple of tablespoons each.  Still turns out extremely moist and the texture seems a bit more amenable to slicing.  One point to emphasize (again) -- let the cake cool in the pan!  It's so nice to find recipes that are not only delicious but ridiculously easy to make.  Thanks again!

I made this as a b-day cake and people were coming back for 2nd and 3rd helpings. As recommended cut the oil down to 2/3 and the water to 3/4. I also made a citrus glaze for it (thought the carmel would make the cake too sweet). Citrus Glaze was 1/2 cup of powdered sugar, 1 teaspoon grated orange peel, & 1 1/2 to 2 teaspoons of orange juice. Perfect complement to a perfect cake!

GREAT-tasting and moist (it got the finicky hubby's stamp of approval)...AND WAY TOO EASY (if there is such a thing)! HOWEVER, please note: the 1st time I made this I took the advice of other reviewers, reducing the veg oil to 2/3C and the water to 3/4C and ended up with a CRUMBLY MESS! (I even used a bread knife and a "sawing motion" as others suggested, and it still fell apart). This time I followed the ORIGINAL recipe and the cake held together! (Imagine that!) (It IS very moist, tho, so the bread knife/sawing method helps). Made sure to mix batter thoroughly---crumbling all the cake mix clumps as I stirred---and once I filled the bundt pan with the batter, gave it a good couple of raps on the counter to get rid of the air bubbles. I used butter-flavored non-stick cooking spray, and suggest you wait 'til cake cools completely before removing it from pan. I also toasted the well-chopped pecans as another reviewer suggested (spread out on cookie sheet for 5 mins. at 350 degrees). Toasting them makes a difference! Thank you for sharing, Debbie...SO generous of you! And lastly...STOCK UP WHEN THESE INGREDIENTS GO ON SALE AT THE MARKET!!! ;-)

This is great but it is very rich. Need to let cool completely (at least 2-3 hours) before removing from pan-because the cake is so heavy the bottom will come apart. I used Carmel Frosting VI as others suggested but without adding pecans(cake has plenty). This was a hit!

A good cake but not a knockout. Somewhat too sweet. It doesn't cut well and the slices are very crumbly due to the frosting in the batter, which makes it heavy and moist inside. It was fast and easy to make.

I first made this cake with caramel cake mix. I couldn't find butter pecan. It turned out ok but with a maple flavor?. I kept searching and found butter pecan at a smaller gro store chain(piggly wiggly). Boy what a difference, it was 10 times better with the butter pecan. I added 1/2 teas butter flavoring extract. Made a glaze with Caramel Frosting VI from this site and sprinkled with toasted chopped pecans. It was wonderful!!!!!
This cake also freezes well!!! Thanks so much Debbie!!!

This is one of those recipes that simply should stand on it's own!  I totally understand that there are some reviewers that feel the need to "reduce this" or add that, but this is one recipe that is part of my rotation, and can stand as written.

Incredible just as it is.  I always get rave reviews.  Last week, I changed it a bit and received EVEN MORE positive comments.  I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup, and instead of water, I added 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/2 cup Southern Comfort Liquor.  After baking, I used an ice pick to poke holes, and made a glaze. 1/2 c butter,1/2 c Southern Comfort, and 1/2 c sugar..then very slowly over the course of about an hour, I drizzled this over the cake. I let it sit for a day, the, took another can of coconut/pecan frosting and mixed in Southern Comfort to make it the consistency that would allow me to pour over the cake (but not too thin as it should stay on the cake).  AMAZING is all I can say...

Absolutely Delicious!! I debated whether to make changes based on other reviewers, and decided to follow the recipe the first time. It was so amazingly most and perfect flavor! I was on a mission to find a close recipe to a bakery favorite of ours. The only changes I made were to divide the batter into 2- 9 inch pans and I made the "whipped cream cheese frosting" from this site. I put frosting in between the 2 layers and used the rest all over. Topped it with toasted pecans and it was PERFECT! The icing is a wonderful compliment!! PS: after 3 grocery stores, I found the butter pecan cake mix at Piggly Wiggly (if you live in the South)~ It's also sold on Amazon.

This is a VERY good cake and easy to make. I couldnt find the Butter Pecan mix so I used the Pineapple mix and it was delicious! I also used a cup of milk instead of water and kept everything else the same. I made these for gifts last night and got 3 8x4 loaf pans out of one recipe and baked them for 60  minutes. I made the test recipe this past Saturday and it is still VERY moist. I havent had any problems with the cake crumbling. I did not frost it either-it doesnt need it.

This is really, really good.  I followed the recipe exactly except I melted a can of caramel frosting at 50% power for 30 seconds and drizzled over the cooled cake.  I took this cake to a church dinner yesterday where there were many other great desserts and this one was the first one completely gone.  Since the cake is so moist, it did try to break when I inverted it on to a plate.  I had let it cool in the pan for 15 minutes but next time, I will let it cool completely in the pan before I invert it.  Great recipe!!!

AWESOME!  I don't care for coconut too much, so I was hesitant to make it.  Hubby doesn't care for pecans, so he wasn't sure of it either.  Once baked and cooled... LORD HELP ME!  This is the best bundt I have ever had.  Easy, quick, yummy, and an easy clean-up too!  Friends loved it, mom wants the recipe.  The first one I made wasn't even gone yet and I was at the store buying another cake mix and container of frosting!  I will always keep the two items in my pantry now!  Thanks!

This is a fantastic cake. On the advice of a friend, I added 1 dry box of french vanilla pudding mix and 1 cup sour cream.  The result was a more dense, compact cake.  Super!  And the more pecans you add, the better!

This cake came out awesome! I made it as one of my Thanksgiving desserts; everyone who ate it took the recipe home with them! I still can't believe how easy it was to throw together, yet how delicious it tasted. I took the advice of some other reviewers and cut the oil back from 3/4 cup to just 1/2 cup. This one's a definite keeper! Perfection in a bundt pan!!!

I've made this recipe for a few years now.  Great for family dinners & potlucks.  One of my "go to" cakes.  Easy & relatively inexpensive.  Love that there's no frosting to fuss with since it's baked in.  I don't usually add the chopped pecans.

I used all the ingredients in this recipe, but changed it up and baked it in a 9 x 13 pan.  I had 3 bananas that were ripe.  I mashed those up and put them in the cake mixture in place of the frosting.  I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup.  I frosted it with the coconut pecan frosting.  It was perfectly delicious.

I made this exactly as written and it was very good.  The pecans that are placed in the pan before the batter make it a little difficult to slice, though.  I may just mix in the whole cup of pecans into the mix next time.  Several people asked for the recipe.  I also drizzled it with canned caramel frosting that I softened in the microwave.  It was perfect with vanilla ice cream.

This recipe is a keeper. Smells wonderul when it's in the oven!! I baked it in a 9x13 pan. I used the Caramel VI icing recipe that I got off this website too. I poked holes in the cake and then poured the icing over it. WOW! This pairs well w/vanilla ice cream. The cake disappeared! lol I had no problems w/the cake crumbling like some other reviewers had-maybe b/c I left the cake in the pan??? I didn't use as many pecans as the recipe called for b/c I'm not a big fan of alot of nuts in cake. I will definitely use this recipe again. I had several requests for this recipe! I highly recommend anyone to try this cake.

Amazing recipe!! This is my husband's favorite dessert. Trying chopping up the entire cup of pecans to mix in and make cupcakes- makes perfect portions and turns out much nicer than the cake. For a decorative presentation put one dot of cream cheese icing topped with a pecan half :) crowed pleaser every time and so easy!

I try to make a recipe as written the first time, then make adjustments to suit my family, but the store did not have the butter pecan cake mix. I used a regular yellow cake mix and it was delicious!
I did prepare the pan with spray and flour and let it cool in the pan overnight. It flipped right out with only one small blemish that a dusting of powdered sugar would hide.
I brought the cake to work with me where it quickly became breakfast instead of afternoon snack. It was moist and dense. And served very well as a cold cake. No glaze needed! That is where it would get overly-sweet. Face it, it is a dessert!
I would like to try the recipe again with other flavor cake mixes, because it would work well with more flavors than one.

I converted this for high altitude the first time I made and cooked at 375.  It was the lightest cake I've ever had but too crumbly to eat with hands.  Second time, I followed the instructions, still had issues but not as much.  Next time I think I'll decrease the temp and then freeze.  It's a great tasting cake.

Awesome flavor for how simple it is!  Family loved it.  Very moist.  Used a round spring-form pan..came out great.   Turned the heat down to 325 degrees for the last 20 minutes to ensure it would't burn before the center was done as per some other reviews, it turned out perfectly.  Used a light vanilla glaze over the top as we have a strong sweet tooth in my family.  :)  It's good straight away but it's absolutely divine the next day!!!!!

Delicious, however, my cake ran over my bundt pan in the oven-- so use caution there.  I always dust my bundt pan with white sugar after spraying-- the cake releases easily and the sugar gives it a sparkly, slightly crunchy crust.

This is so good and moist.  I would give it 4 1/2 stars just because it's a little crumbly, but it definitely has a 5 star taste.  And, it's so easy!  I made it last night and brought it to work today.  Everyone is enjoying it with their coffee.  I did cut down on the oil as suggested by previous viewers, but it's still so moist that it's crumbly.  I baked it for longer than 1 hour and 5 minutes.  I sprayed the bundt pan really well and the cake came out easily once it was cooled.  I also used the Caramel Frosting IV (or was it VI?) as suggested by previous reviewers, and drizzled some of it over the cake when it cooled.  Then I sprinkled some pecans on top.  Turned out pretty.  For ease, taste, and presentation, I definitely recommend this cake.

Excellent cake!! Very surprised this doesn't have more reviews.  Very unique and different from the usual box cake recipes.  Only thing I did different was baked in a 9 x 13 pan and frosted with homemade cream cheese frosting.  Note: Hard to find cake mix, but I finally did find at my local Walmart.

This is a very good cake to use for office potlucks. This cake is also burns easily on the exterior. When I use a dark bundt pan, I turn the temp down to 325 for the last 30 minutes..

This cake is the "bomb"!!! I have made it many times and it always gets rave reviews.  I think I could eat the whole thing myself!! I do reduce the oil to 1/2 cup but leave everything else the same.  It turns out awesome!!!  Update: I have many time and still get rave review.  The latest thing that I've been doing is using a devils food cake mix with chocolate fudge icing.  AMAZING!!!!  I had several men in the office tell me how delicious it was and they usually don't make comments like that. Try it......you'll love it!

This is wonderful and the flavor can't be beat!!!  I intended to follow the suggestions of the other by cutting back to 1/2 c of oil and 3/4 c of water but I forgot and followed the recipe and boy am I glad.  It's really moist and not at all oily.  Definitely a keeper!  I have to add that I was wayy too impatient to wait for it to cool completely but I did grease and flour the bundt pan and it popped out with no problem, crumbling wasn't an issue and I baked for exactly 50 minutes.

Fabulous!  I made exactly as the recipe states, and it was wonderful.  Folks couldn't get over how moist it was.  Do let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes or so before removing or it will crumble apart.  Terrific - thanks so much!

Made this to spec except that I put ALL the pecans in the pan first rather than half in the cake. It came out perfectly moist, I didn't find it overly sweet at all, and it got hubby's stamp of approval though he isn't fond of coconut - he said its a keeper. It is rich, so I recommend small slices! So easy to make it will be a regular in my kitchen.

They no longer make the coconut pecan frosting in a container so how did you make the cake? I have been wanting to make the cake again but Betty Crocker has discontinued the frosting and I don't know what to use.

Nothing spectacular and not worth making again - very sweet. I pretty much followed the recipe except for the pecans. It crumbled apart when I went to take it out of the bundt pan.

I just made this cake this morning.  Awesome, moist, flavorful.  Needs no frosting, but next time I make this I will try adding Butter Pecan Frosting . Followed the recipe to a "T" let cool completely in bundt pan , and had no problems with it falling apart.  Thanks for sharing such an easy and flavorful cake. Will definately make and share this cake recipe again!

My entire family loved it and it was so easy to make.  I added a little more pecans to the recipe.  Even my daughter who is normally not a sweet eater praised it.  I have had a LOT of people ask for the recipe.  I make a caramel glaze to go over mine and it just seemed to make it that more tasty!!!

Nice coffeecake type cake.   I was expecting spectacular based on the reviews but it is above average.  I appreciate the recipe because of its simplicity and ability to make from boxed/prepared items.  I'll make this again and attempt to make it a little healthier with less oil and because I don't feel it NEEDS it with the added frosting.  Crumbled a bit but most coffee cakes do..not a big deal....use a bread knife in sawing motion to cut.  Pic above looks pretty but most do not including mine.  I think this needs a light colored glaze to make it have a more finished look.  I used caramel glaze but it was transparent .  Doesn't need glaze for taste though....taste is very nice.   I let cool for 1-1/2 hours and it realeased fine.  I refrigerated it and took it to luncheon next day.   Thanks for the recipe!

WOW WONDERFUL! Thank you so much for this recipe! After reading the other reviews I did take some advice I used 1/2C of applesauce instead of 3/4C oil and 3/4C water instead of 1C of water, I ground my pecans that went into the cake to help firm it a little bit without messing with this wonderful taste and added the chopped pecans to the top MMM-MMM-MMM. The cake alone is WONDERFUL but I added Hersheys dulce de leche to individual pieces and just a great compliment YUM! But by all means the cake can stand alone without any compliment. I love recipes that are worth adding to my family's cookbook to pass down and this is an heirloom!

This cake had a wonderful aroma while baking and had an even better flavor.  I took the advice of others and used slighly less than 1 cup of water.  The cake was a bit crumbley when slicing; however, this slight flaw was quickly forgotten after tasted.

This is my husbands favorite cake, he calls it the crumbless cake because there is never a crumb left.  I recently made it with a Duncan Hines Chocolate Butter Cake Mix instead of the Yellow Butter Mix and it was incredible. Changed to 3/4 cup water and 1/2 cup oil and it was perfect.  Add a caramel glaze is you wish. YUMMMMMY!!!

A wonderful, moist cake.  Everyone likes it.  I have made it with the butter pecan mix and also with a plain yellow mix when the butter pecan is not available.  The butter pecan mix is sweeter, I think, but both are quite good.

Outstanding cake. Made it the first time with the "Butter Recipe" cake mix and walnuts. It was okay. The second time I made it I used the "Butter Pecan" cake mix and pecans. I followed the recipe exactly. It was delicious! I wouldn't bother making it again with anything but ALL the required ingredients.

My favorite... My daughter made it for my birthday and it's been my go to cake since.  I use butter instead of oil and only half cup water and half cup sour cream.  Sometimes I frost it as a layer cake sometimes I bundt pan it and sprinkle powdered sugar or a drip glaze on it.  Rich and everyone thinks you worked hard in it.   I'll never tell.

This recipe is so GOOD! Easy, moist and delicious! I did not bake mine in a bundt pan but made cupcakes. Then I made a sauce using 1 can of condensed milk, 2 Tablespoons of butter and 1/2 cup of chopped pecans. Heat on low and drizzle over cake slice or individual cupcakes. This recipe is addicting! ;)

I made this cake yesterday and must say, it's one of the best cakes I've ever baked. You won't be disappointed if you try this recipe....it's perfect as written (and stupendous topped with Caramel Glaze).  My Honey doesn't like most cakes, but he has eaten 5 slices of this one!  Definitely one of the best recipes I've tried.

This is my "go to" cake. It always gets great reviews and requests for the recipe. I omit the pecans that go into the pan and use a glaze. I've also made this as a birthday cake with cream cheese frosting. Delish!!!!

Cake was very crumbly when cutting to serve and it tasted a little bland.  I'll salvage the rest by using the crumbles for ice cream.

This cake is moist and delicious !  Made it last night to bring to work for a Birthday celebration and it was very good.  I didn't change a thing with the recipe and I  used an instant Vanilla glaze on top.  Will definitely make it again!

This cake is easy to make.  It's moist and delicious.  My husband is not a cake eater, but loves this one.  Every time I take it to an office party, there are no leftovers.  The only thing I add is a little cream cheese frosting.

I've used this recipe for years only used a yellow cake mix.  It is dangerous, though, to eat a piece warm straight from the oven.  Addictive!!!

I made the cake just as the recipe calls for, no changes needed if this cake is cooled properly, it won't crumble and fall apart.  This cake is best made the day before, allowed to cool for awhile, then placed in the fridge overnight.  It will slice much better if refrigerated overnight.  I drizzled  caramel ice cream topping over it and sprinkled with chopped pecans right before serving.

This is amazingly easy to make and delicious.  I added a caramel glaze and it was perfect (made from brown sugar, butter and a little milk, heated to boiling to carmelize).  This is a recipe I will surely repeat - I bought extras of the butter pecan cake mix b/c it can be hard to find.

The taste is great BUT I must not have oiled my bundt pan enough as half of it stuck to the bottom.  I too used 1/2 c oil & 3/4 c water.  I only used 3/4 of the can of frosting and with the rest I added a little water, heated it some in the microwave and it made a glaze I could drizzle (over the hunks of cake that came out of my pan!).  Glad I wasn't making it for company - I will try again with a well oiled bundt pan.

Thank you Jody for recommending this a long time ago. I hadn't forgotten.  This is a super easy and great tasting cake.  It is what some others have said, a little crumbly and falls apart when you try to slice it but that doesn't take away from the taste.  Thank you for posting the recipe Debbie.

Wonderful, rich cake! The only thing I changed was I used Yellow butter cake mix, & only used 1/2 cup of oil which was plenty. Made 4 loaves instead, Freezes well.

This is a fantastic cake!  I decreased the oil to 1/2 cup after reading the other reviews, & baked it in 3 8x4 loaf pans for 40 min. I then microwaved some van. frosting for about 20 seconds on med. power & drizzled this on top. I gave these as teacher gifts - very easy!

This is simply one of the best cakes ever.  I have tried it several ways that are listed in these reviews, but the best way for me is to just make it as suggested and then wait for the cake to completely cool in the pan before removing it, it doesn't crumble so much that way.  The is the moistest cake ever and I get SO many compliments whenever I make it.  Also, I usually find the butter pecan cake mix at the  Walmart with the grocery section or at Smiths.

I followed the recipe exactly and had no texture problems.  I did do as a few other reviewers suggested and I let the cake cool completely in the pan, let the cake sit over night before cutting and cut it with a serrated knife.  It cut fine.  With that said, I would rate the texture as extremely moist.  the flavor, while very good, did not rate an excellent in my eyes.  People who ate the cake liked it and gave it compliments.  However, I made a Almond Pound Cake from scratch that day and served it along side this cake.  I got more compliments and raves on the Almond Cake than this cake.    I would definitely make this again - it is so easy to assemble and it really does taste good. However, if I want the "WOW!" factor, I'll bake something else.

I've made this cake twice with Golden Butter Recipe and twice with Butter Pecan (which I could only find in Louisiana) and all four times, the cake has been a hit. I strongly agree that you need to let the cake cool completely  (two hours) in the pan before removing it.

This is a winner--very easy to put together and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I could not find a butter pecan mix, so I subsituted a yellow butter mix.  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I did have a slight problem getting it out of the pan, but just patched it up a little and it was fine.

This is one of those recipes I wish I had tried sooner.  It's ridiculously easy--literally took me 5 minutes to get it in the oven.  It is moist and delicious; the only problem is I can't stop eating it!  I served it warm from the oven with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce and my family inhaled it, even my kids who don't usually like nuts.  I greased and floured my pan instead of using cooking spray and it came out of the pan beautifully.  It's still moist and delicious the next day.  Definitely a keeper for me; the perfect last minute pot luck dish.

Delicious!  I followed the original recipe using a 9 x 13 inch pan and served each slice topped with Smucker's caramel sundae sauce and Cool Whip.  What a hit!

This cake is super moist and stayed that way for days.  We added a simple glaze on top with powdered sugar and milk- this is the cake version of pecan pie.

AWESOME CAKE! This is such an easy recipe and so moist.  It comes out looking a little plain so I dusted it with powdered sugar...beautiful.  I thought it was plenty sweet but those of you who have a sweet tooth, you might want to drizzle a little something over the top. I omitted the 1/2cup of pecans in the batter thinking it would be too much but I could have left them in there.  I highly recommend this cake.

Definitely a keeper.  Took the advice of the others and used 2/3 cup oil and 3/4 cup water and the cake was delicious.  My sister found the butter pecan cake mix (made by Betty Crocker) and I drizzled a caramel glaze over the cake before cutting it.  The drizzle gace it a more "dressed up" look. I thought it was delicious and soooo easy to make. My 13 year old niece loved it too. If you have problems cutting it up, just take a sharp knife and cut it with a back and forth motion instead of straight down.

YUMMY! Everyone loved this cake. I too could'nt find Butter Pecan cake mix, but was determined to make the recipe as stated, so I called Betty Crocker's 800 number and they shipped me some right to my door! Definately reduce the oil and you will have one awesome cake! It doesnt need any frosting, awesome as is!

Wish I could give this one more than 5 stars!  Fantastic, although I couldn't find the butter pecan cake mix and used butter yellow cake in its place.  Still turned out great!  I also heeded the previous advice and used a little less oil and water.  Very easy and looks like you spent all day cooking!  Thanks for this one, Debbie.  It's a keeper!!

I made this cake, but used a spice cake mix and caramel apple frosting (which I believe is seasonal).  It was a great cake.  I think you could use any cake mix/frosting combination. Thanks for a simple, great recipe.

Great cake.  Very moist and dense.  It's sweet, but not any sweeter than an iced cake.  I didn't add the extra pecans and it was great as is. I'll have to try it again when I have pecans. I did decrease the oil as suggested and it was fine.   It's heavy so it needs to cool before you attempt to remove it.

I made it a second and third time with different cake mixes.  Love it with a german chocolate cake mix!  With dark chocolate it kind of lost the flavor of the pecans and coconut.  I also was out of oil once and instead of using oil I used 3/4 cup of unsweetened applesauce.  It was great!  The cake turned out lighter and far less dense.  The icing actually has a lot of oil in it already so the oil is really unnecessary.

I followed this recipe minus the pecans(dnt like them) and it was pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was the coconut(dnt like) but the rest of my family really enjoyed it. Next time I'll try it with a caramel glaze.

Excellent cake!  Made it exactly as the recipe stated.  Very moist!  I did experience the crumbling as did my tasters (co-workers) but they all loved it.  Wanted more.  Will try a second time with the suggested decreases in oil & water.  Very easy and bakes nicely.

I never review anything, although I try a lot of recipes, but I just have to say something about this cake. I baked this afternoon and didnt allow anybody to touch it until after dinner. All I can say is WOW. The cake is moist, flavorful, easy, economical, there is just so many reasons to make this. The only change I made was to use about  1/2 cup oil instead of whatever the recipe calls for. It didn't crumble on me, is perfect just the way it is, no need for icing, at least that was what my family said. Try it, you won't regret it!

Wow...I'll just echo what everyone else has said.  This is WONDERFUL.  The hardest part (I think) is finding Butter Pecan cake mix!!  I can only find one store that carries it!  Cake is moist, full of flavor and always receives rave reviews!  I'm getting ready to make a couple to give as gifts.

OH MY! I'd give this 50 stars, if I could! This is so good. We are traveling to visit our friend who loves Praline candies, in a week. My praline candies didn't turn out so good when I tried to make them before, so I figured I'd give this a try. I made a "test" cake today and it was delicious! I am so happy with the result! I followed the recipe exactly and I used Betty Crocker butter pecan cake mix and Betty Crocker Coconut Pecan Icing. I can't wait to make it for our friend next week. I hope he loves it as much as we do! Thank You, Thank You, Thank You!

I followed advice of a few others.  Left maybe 1/4 of the icing tub out of the mix and then microwaved it briefly to make a glaze out sorts at the end.  Also cut oil down to 1/2 cup.  We wanted to eat it before cooled, and I had no trouble cutting it, although it did crumble when trying to take bites.  Yummy, though!

This is a very easy and quick recipe that makes a yummy cake. I made mini-cakes using the Nordicware Mini Bundt pan. I used pecan meal instead of chopped pecans in the bottoms. They were done after baking about 17 minutes. After cooling, I topped each with a small dollop of cream cheese frosting and then drizzled each with thin caramel frosting. They made a spectacular presentation!

I've made this for my family and they think it's the best cake I have ever made for them.  I was telling my niece about it and she said she couldn't wait to get home for me to make her one. So I made this cake for my niece and sent it to her in Iraq and she said it was wonderful.  This is just the best cake it is so moist. So easy to make.

I love this recipe. I made it for my 76 yo Grandmother's birthday and was a huge hit. I followed the directions, with few tweaks. I used a little less icing in the batter and added a splash of vanilla flavoring, a splash of butter flavoring and a cup of crushed pecans. I also placed caramel bits in the bottom of my pan and sprinkled a handful on top of the batter before baking. I put a light caramel glaze on the top just before serving. Yum yum yum--smiles from all!

Divine!  Like others, I had to cook a little longer.  Took it to Easter dinner and there was none left. Very easy to make.  I let it cool completely before removing from pan and it came out great.  Wouldn't change a thing!

absolutely wonderful....I did have trouble finding the butter pecan flavored cake mix tho. I finally found the cake mix and stocked up so I have a few extra on hand. I followed the directions exactly. 
At my daughters wedding, we had several flavors of cake and this was one of them so we frosted it using the decorators frosting flavored with vanilla and rum. Many said "It was to die for"

I just made this cake yesterday and found it to be very good.  Not my very favorite but worthy of keeping the recipe.  I made it exactly by the directions except I had to use a butter recipe yellow cake mix.  I could not find the butter pecan mix where I live. I let it cool about 1 1/2 hours in the pan.  I think a caramel glaze would be good on it. I may try it next time and there will be a next time!

This is super easy and very tasty! My husband loves it, and he normally despises coconut!
Decreased oil as per suggestions and also omitted sprinkling pecans in bottom of pan. Thanks for a great recipe!

if you like butter pecan ice cream-here is where it's at FOR YOU!!!This rules and I DO recommend letting it sit a day first(if you can)cause it gets better and moister the more it sits(but still doesnt end up getting nasty after 2 days like some cakes)easy and worth the time...a WOW cake!!!Great recipe thanks!!

I have never changed anything with theis perfect recipe! I have made it tons of times for family and friends and they love it everytime! It is the best cake ever!!!! Yummy. One thing though don't put it in a smaller bundt pan I made that mistake once because I had a smaller fancy one and it bubbled all over the stove, however it was still good even after that! :)

Perfect recipe.  I made the recipe exactly using "Philsbury" yellow cake mix (couldn't find butter pecan) and it turned out perfect.  I listened to someone's posted advise and let the cake cool before taking out (with other bundt cakes I've taken it out of the pan right away) and it didn't break.  I posted a picture :D

I’m rating this a 4-star because this cake is moist, flavorful, very easy to make, perfect for the Fall season and potlucks.  As with other people, I could not find the Butter-Pecan cake mix so I used yellow cake mix but added butter-pecan extract to give it that special flavor. I followed the rest of the recipe from top to bottom and took the wise advice of letting the cake cool completely before taking it from the pan and cutting it.  It is a little crumbly due to the pecan pieces but not too bad.  Took it to work and it was a HUGE hit with my office mates—15 tech geek guys in the IT department.  They couldn’t get enough!

This cake is fantastic!  Every time I make it I always get asked for the recipe.  I have taken other reviewers suggestions and cut the amount of oil and water and it comes out perfectly every time.  I don't think that you need to add a glaze on top but to each his or her own.  They just don't seem to sell butter pecan cake mix in my area so I make do with yellow cake mix.  I can't imagine it coming out any better.  Thank you for a great recipe!

OK, so I changed a couple of things (that's what guys do!): Since I just can't leave well enough alone...I used a YELLOW cake mix and baked according to directions. Added 1/2 c coconut to batter as well as 1/4 tsp vanilla  and  also added 1/2 c MORE pecans sprinkled to the TOP of the cake after pouring into 13x9 pan. And again, this one flew! Thanks, Debbie

Wonderful! I took it to a dinner a church and everyone loved it.  I did as suggested and used 3/4 cup water and 2/3 oil.  I also used a carmel glaze and then topped with toasted pecans. This recipe is a keeper!

Easy recipe to make!!
Used:
Duncan Hines 15 oz (no 16 oz found) frosting 
Pillsbury German Chocolate cake mix
1/3 cup oil instead of 3/4 cup oil
Toasted the pecans first at 350 degrees 5 minutes
Sprinkled pecans on top of batter instead of bottom because of misreading
Baked in 2 9x13 loaf pans 40 minutes
Sprinkled with powdered sugar on top

Next time will make day ahead.

Excellent. I made the day ahead and used 2/3 cup oil and 3/4 cup water. I used a bread knife to cut it and had no problems at all. Every day it gets moister, so definately make a day ahead. I think chocolate cake mix would be good too!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday last week, and he loved it!!!  I asked if it was a "keeper" and he said - NO, it's an eater!!! I did mean recipe keeper.  Others in my family came by and finished it off before the weekend.  All said it was a great cake.
I used a butter recipe cake mix (couldn't find a butter pecan mix) and only 2/3 cup of oil (after  what other reviewers said about it being too crumblier.
I will make this cake often - in fact I made another one for a dessert auction at church yesterday.

I have to say that at first I questioned adding the frosting in with the batter prior to baking, but this cake is delicious. I've made it at least a half dozen times and someone always asks for the recipe! And talk about easy!

I made this and followed the directions to a tee both times. It is a very nice and moist cake. Had a little problem getting out of pan while warm but tasted great. I used a glaze the firat time. The second time I made this I made it in a 9x13 pan and then sliced it into 3 equal portions to layer it. I made a whipped cream frosting by mixing a can of the frosting mixed into the small tub of whipped cream. It was great. The second time was for my father in laws birthday and he loved it as did my husband and kids.

This is one of my go-to quick cakes for bake sales, pot lucks, etc..  You can use a yellow cake mix if you don't have a butter pecan in the pantry.  I like to do 1/2 oil 1/2 melted butter in all my mix recipes.

Love the praline glaze! This was delicious! Thinking about trying to turn it into pralines.

ALMOST embarrassingly easy. Everyone asks for the recipe because it's that good.  I toast the pecans while I mix it together (5 minutes at 350 on a sheet pan) it really brings out the flavor and involves no effort!!! So it with the fits in with the ridiculous ease of this recipe. I had to bake it for a full hour though, (maybe because my bundt pan is silicone) and didn't release it until it was completely cooled. It is very, very moist and does not hold it's shape too well, so maybe decreasing the amount of oil and water as others have suggested would help, but since the FLAVOR is so darned good, we don't mind! Serve with butter pecan ice cream!

This is delicious, but I did have a problem with it falling apart when it came out of the pan.  I followed the recipe exactly as printed. I took the advice of another reviewer and let it cool completely before trying to remove from the pan but it still fell apart.  This is so good, it's definitely worth trying again.  Next time I'll use the suggestion of another reviewer and lower the oil/water amts.

I made this for a Christmas party last year and have been asked to make it again this year. The only thing I changed was I used glazed pecans instead of plain ones. I made the night before and it had pleanty of time for cooling. There were NO leftovers! Even with 20 or more desserts for some 25 people to choose from.

Doesn't get any easier than this! This is a great recipe to have on hand for unexpected company.  My guests and family really liked this cake-very moist! Next time I'll be sure to have some ice cream on hand as I think they would go great together :)

I've made this twice following receipe exactly and loved it.  I think next time I'll cut the oil so it isn't as heavy.  

UPDATE: I noticed that my box of cake mix was smaller than the recipe (15.25 oz instead of the 18 oz) so I cut the oil and water proportionally, and monitored the cooking time. I also added only about 3/4 cup of pecans, and it was plenty nutty. Be careful when checking for doneness,  I jiggled the cake too much when I checked it and it fell a little. I also melted carmel baking chips and added some chocolate drizzle to the top.

As others have said, it's a very moist cake and doesn't do well when cutting (it crumbles very easily). Maybe it should be slightly over-cooked to compensate. I let the cake cool overnight and un-molded it about 24 hours later, so the shape held great.

Like some of the other reviewers, we thought this cake was just "ok" - nothing spectacular.  We wound up throwing the leftovers out, which very rarely happens at our house.

This was okay but I won't be making it again. I really didn't get the "praline" thing. It tasted like German Chocolate without the chocolate to me.

I've made this several times.  The first time I did it purely by the recipe, then on later cakes tried some of the tweaks in the comments.  I'm back to doing it by the original recipe.  It's a huge hit wherever I take it.

My kids loved this recipe!  I've made a cake VERY similar to this.  It was made with a butter recipe yellow cake mix, 1 coconut pecan frosting, 3 eggs, 1/2 oil and 1 c. water.  It was great that way!  I personally prefer the butter recipe yellow cake mix instead of the butter pecan though.  It just seemed to me like it had a little more taste to it that way. It's still great and very quick to make either way.

I just made this on Sat. for my sister's b-day..for the first time (mind you..I had another cake too but felt I needed to make another for our big family).  Needless to say, I knew this would be quick and my husband and I bought the ingredients (cake mix and icing) and put it together and told everyone they would be trying this cake for the first time.  They all LOVED it..including me and my husband.  Thank you!  Perfect recipe for a simple but delicious cake.

What a delicious cake recipe!  I've made it twice, with only one change.  My Bundt cake pan is star-shaped which caused the pecans to cluster in the "points" of the star.  Therefore, the second time I made it, I stirred ALL of the pecans into the batter instead of halfing it as instructed.  It turned out great either way!  I used the exact measurements of oil and water with no problem.  I've shared the recipe with at least 5-6 other people because everyone loved it and have been asked to bring at least TWO of the cakes to our family reunion this summer!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellent! I followed the directions exactly, with one exception ... only had 1/2 cup of chopped pecans, so I toasted them and added them into the cake batter. Used a 1/4 cup of pecan chips for the topping. It was delicious!

Ohhh this is so good. Followed suggestions of 2/3 cup oil and 3/4 cup water. Chopped the pecans small so it was easy to cut. Doesn't even need a glaze. Tried it right out of the oven and wasn't impressed, but next day it was wonderful. I was a little leary of the icing in the cake, but you don't really notice the sweetness just the coconut. EASY AND VERY GOOD.

Absolutely Delicious!  I used the recommended changes of 2/3c. oil and 3/4c. water, along with some butter flavoring as all I could find was yellow cake mix.  I topped it with pecans cooked in brown sugar and water with vanilla added -- used a favorite praline recipe.  I can hardly wait to make it again.  Very moist, and wonderful even two days later.

This was the best cake ever!  I made the following modifications:  used butter yellow cake mix because I couldn't find butter pecan, substitued walnuts instead of pecans, made in a 9x13 pan and baked for the same amount of time, and topped with the coconut pecan frosting.  It was so good.  Even my picky sister, who hates coconut, liked it.  Of course she scraped off the frosting because she doesn't like coconut so after she finished eating it and commented on how good it was, I told her that there was coconut in the cake.  She didn't even know.

An excellent recipe.  However, I always use 1/3 cup oil and 1 cup evaporated milk.  I've made this recipe with a white cake mix and a german chocolate mix--with excellent results.  With the white cake mix, I also add a small box of instant vanilla or white chocolate pudding.  No need for frosting--just sprinkle with powdered sugar--the cake is rich enough to stand on its own.

I made this cake for a church function Sunday.  I loved it!  It was so easy, and I thought it was very good.  It's a good recipe for the last minute, "oh I forgot", type of person because it's so easy to prepare.  I followed one of the other suggestions - less oil, and the cake came out perfectly.  I couldn't find the right cake mix, so I used the butter cake mix.  It was very moist, and everyone liked it.  Thanks for this recipe.  I will make this one again and again!

So easy and very delicious!  I used 2/3 cup oil and 3/4 cup water.  I had no problems with the cake crumbling.  I waited until completely cool and used a very sharp knife to slice.

I made this cake for my Bunco group and everyone loved it!  To keep it from crumbling, cut w/a very sharp knife back & forth instead of pushing straight down.  This cake is much better if you make it the day before you need it.

This cake was delicious and so easy.  Everyone in the house enjoyed it, with the exception of my 8 year old daughter who doesn't like nuts.  I used 1/2 cup oil and next time I will use 1/4 cup, as it was almost too moist. I would suggest making it the day before you want to eat it and letting it sit.  This recipe would also be delicious using a chocolate or german chocolate cake mix.

I tried this recipe for Mother's Day. Mom raised her eyebrows at me putting the frosting in the cake mix, but she loved the cake and wants me to make it for my grandparents' anniversary. I did cut the oil back to 1/2 cup. It crumbled just the tiniest bit the day I baked it, but it was perfect the next day.

I couldn't cut it without the cake crumbling. I used 1/2c oil but next time I would omit the oil altogether. There probably is enough in the frosting anyway. I did have two requests for the cake :)

This cake is wonderful!!I read the reviews before making the cake.  I cut down 1/4 cup on the water, but don't think I needed to.  I made the cake the night before I needed it.  I did not find the cake to crumble at all.  Maybe the ones that did were not using a very sharp knife.  This is definitely a recipe I will use again!!!

very good!  I thought it was a bit too moist, maybe too much oil.  It was difficult to slice(crumbled)because of the moistness.  Would try with half as much oil next time.  I also could not find a butter pecan cake mix so I used a plain yellow mix.

I have been making this for years! It works well no matter what combination and of mix and frosting you use. My family loves French vanilla mix with the German choc coconut pecan frosting! In the summer the fruit flavors are refreshing!

I used milk (actually half and half since I had some on hand) instead of water and left out the pecans in the recipe and in the pan,  I greased the heck out of the bundt pan and left it in there overnight and had no trouble removing it.  Only lost a quarter sized spot on the side but covered that up with the caramel drizzle I had squibbled on the cake.

Great cake, especially being from a boxed mix. I made it exactly as the recipe stated...if it says 18.25 oz cake mix that's what you need to use, I bought two mixes (15.25 oz each) and used one whole and added 3 to 4 ounces of the other. Perfect!

I made this for Thanksgiving desert and everyone LOVED IT! It was much sweeter than regular cake, so next time I make it, I may have to add a little bit of Southern Comfort (bourbon) into the mix, to sharpen the taste a little bit. I also substituted the water for half&half, and the oil for butter (like I do with ALL my baking ALWAYS).
I greased my bundt pan with "Wiltons cake release" (you can buy it in Wal-Mart),  and I didnt need to wait for the cake to cool in order to take it out of the pan. I put it in at 350* for 45min and it came right out. I had to save time because I made 2 of these cakes. 

Before I flip my cakes, I always aggitate edges of the pan, so the cake kind of "hops" free first. You have to hold the sides of the pan, and kind of pop it up and down until you can see the cake bounce free in the pan. Go all the way around the pan so you see all parts of the cake have popped free, then when you flip it, it'll come right out. 

I made a glaze to go with it. I bought a little tub of regular Betty Crocker Butter Cream icing. 
Sofened it in the microwave, and added caramels (about 10 caramels to 1 tub) and some half&half (about an eighth of a cup, to thin it out). Drizzled on the cake and sprinkled some crushed pecans on top.

So easy and tastes like homemade.  I made a butter pecan glaze with pecans and drizzled over the top.  Put in the refrigerator for a few hours before cutting and it came out perfect.    Will definitely be making again.

This simple to make yet simply tasty cake was a hit with family and friends.  Placing a dish of warmed coconut pecan frosting next to the cake so individuals use it as an optional glaze worked well.  As is, this cake is good as a breakfast/brunch coffee cake.  NOTE:  I do recommend leaving it in the bundt pan at least 2 hours so it sets up, making it less likely to crumble.

I made it as written and added about half a cup of homemade pralines  to the batter instead of plain pecans. Topped with a caramel glaze and more pralines. This is one of the best and easiest cakes I have ever made, also LOOKS beautiful. Everyone at work loved it and needless to say, it didn't last long.

I made the recipe with the reduced oil and slightly reduced water.  I also added 2 T cake flour and a little baking powder (because the consensus seemed to be a heavy, almost too moist cake on other reviews). I only made half a batch and baked it in individual size loaf pans because there is only 2 of us and a big cake just is not a good idea.  Turned out yummy! (no frosting/ glaze).  I would do this again, as it improves the plain cake mix and I have a few boxes from a close out.  I would 5 star it as I made it.

Moist , easy and great tasting cake. 4 stars as written. 5 stars with 2 personal modifications for me. I decrease the oil to 1/2 cup (otherwise it's too oily for my taste) and only add about 1/2 cup of pecans mixed in to the batter and none to the bottom of the pan (otherwise pecans Overtake the cake for me). It only took 40 minutes to bake in my oven. I've made this a few times and it always turns out very good.

I've made this several times - - and it's awesome - - - I usually make it as the recipe states but I've also substituted part of the water for bourbon - - yes, that is amazing - - use 1/4 cup bourbon and 3/4 cup water in the recipe - great for the holidays... drizzle some chocolate over it, like a pecan bourbon ball

I have made this 3 times.  One secret is to leave in pan and cool for 3 hours.  Very important.  
I did the liquid as folloows - 2/3 cup oil, 1/2 cup Bourbon and l/4 cup water.  
I toasted pecans in oven 5 min at 350 before starting the cake.  Used Caramel Frosting VI in Allrecipes.  To that I added 2 teasp whiskey while cooking.  Added salt to make salted carmel taste.

This was amazing....so easy.  The second time I made it, I substituted coconut oil.  Each time I have taken it anywhere, everyone asks for the recipe.  From now on will keep the ingredients on hand to whip this up for "emergencies."

We LOVE this Pound Cake!  I sprinkle sweetened coconut flakes in the bottom of the Bundt pan along with the chopped pecans.  I was so bummed when we switched to a convection oven several years ago.  None of my bundt cakes came out without falling apart.  Someone suggested buying a silicone pan.  I held my breath when I turned this cake out the first time and was sooooo super excited.  I have now replaced all of my cake pans and muffins pans with silicone!

This was a HUGE hit at a harvest dinner last week. It was still warm and steamy,  fresh out of the oven.  I made it exactly as directed except I followed the comments of others and toasted the pecana after chopping them well .  (I always make a recipe as written the first time, then modify if needed next time.)
The little that was left was put in a deep freezer and taken out to be served at a pot luck today.  The cake was even better once the flavors had a chance to marry!

I'm planning to make another one to take to a thanksgiving dinner tomorrow.  BUT this time I'll be smart and make two -- one to keep at home. The only modification I plan to make is that for variety, I'm going to make caramel glaze no. VI for it BUT instead of pouring it all over the cake, I'll thin it out perhaps with some cream cheese and additional milk and serve it on the side, to be drizzled as desired.

I should mention that in Philadelphia, it is VERY difficult to find both the caramel pecan frosting  and the butter pecan cake mix, regardless of the brand.  And don't believe the product locators on line... They lie! (I had purchased it originally at a store out of town.  It took 4 1/2 hours of internet research,  calling and going from store to store to track down the frosting.  And none of them had the butter pecan cake mix! I'm wondering how it would work out if I substituted spice cake mix. Has anyone tried this?

Hints: (1)  Be sure to use large NOT extra large eggs. (2)  watch your oven time an

My son made this cake...he's 10!! It is very sweet...I don't like coconut and I could somewhat taste the coconut from the Pecan-Coconut Frosting. He put too many pecans in the cake, so he didn't put them on the bottom. Use milk instead of water in the mix, and wrap in Saran Wrap after to baking to make it even more moist.

This was so easy.  I did replace the oil with applesauce (1 for 1).  It stayed moist for several days (I only had 3 people over . . . so some was left over.) and was just as good as the first day.  Will definitely make it again . . . maybe trying chocolate cake mix.

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy.  I have also tried it with a chocolate cake mix and frosting....good but the butter pecan ( or caramel) mix is better.

A lot of our guests like it right up there, and more than my butter rum bundt cake. Yes it’s that delicious!

I made this in two 9" layers, frosted with homemade buttercream frosting, then topped with toasted coconut and toasted pecan pieces.  I received Lots of compliments.  It look great and tasted great!

Really Good.  I guess maybe I didn't leave it in the pan long enough.  A big chunk stuck in the pan.  Didn't look good, but it was yummy.  I just wish it had some kind of sauce to pour over it or to brush on for a little more moistness.

This is a ok but, I didn't give it 5 stars. Everyone at work said it was good but not one person asked for the recipe and I brought about half of it home. It does tend to get sweeter as the days go by and by the 3rd day it really needed a glass of milk with it.
I probably won't make it again.

Unfortunately, I won't be eating any of this cake myself as I made it for a cake walk.  It looks beautiful and smelled SO delicious while it baked.  I did decrease the oil to 1/2 cup and baked it about 15 minutes longer.  I also added a powdered sugar and milk glaze, just to make it look prettier.  I will try this again when I get to eat some too!

If you like pecans, you will love this..I did as some suggested and only used 1/2 cup oil, and I replaced 1/4 cup of water with Bourbon for more intense flavor..It does have to cool a while to remove easily from pan, and completely to cut without crumbling...all in all this is a keeper!

I made this cake yesterday according to the original recipe, wished I had read the reviews beforehand and not used the 3/4 cup of oil- cake was good, but much too oily. I wonder if even 2/3 of a cup is too much.  Definitely reduce the oil and water!  I also baked this 15 minutes longer- at 50 min. it was still liquid in the center. That might not be needed, tho, if the liquids are reduced. I had no problem with removal from the pan, just waited 10-15 min. before I flipped it out onto the serving plate. I liked this, but not enough to not make some changes next time, including trying it with a golden butter mix, possibly.

This cake was very easy to put together and I loved the idea of the frosting in the cake.  I personally found that it had a slightly artificial taste to it but my mom LOVED it and so did the others who ate it.  It was very moist and came out of the pan perfectly after it had totally cooled.

Great taste and very easy! Almost too moist and the consistency was a little off (crumbly just a tad). Gonna keep this one and tinker with it. Thank you.

Wow! This recipe is fantasic! Tastes just like pecan pie, with a carrot cake consistency. It is certainly not very good for you, but it tastes fantastic. I couldn't get over how moist it turned out. It didn't break when I took it out of the pan, to my surprise. Will make this again and again!

This is great.  I have made this twice and people do request the recipe.  I'd like to add, you do need to make this 1-2 days in advance to really moisten and then it's divine!! Thanks for a great recipe.

I was disappointed in this cake. After reading the reviews, I expected it to knock my socks off...it didn't. It's a good cake, moist and flavorful but it didn't make me go WOW!! I'm sure I will use this recipe again when I need a quick spur of the moment dessert but I won't use it when I want something impressive that gives the impression that I've slaved all day in the kitchen.

Very moist.  Couldn't find Butter Pecan cake mix, so I used plain Butter mix instead.  Also cut back the pecans to about 1/3 cup.  Sprinkle the top with powdered sugar.  Yum!

An unbelievably easy cake to make that my husband says is the best cake I have ever made.  I will cut back on the oil next time, but other than that it is perfect as is.  I did use the Butter Pecan cake mix and the required frosting.  If you can't find them in your store, try Netgrocer.com or another online shopping site to get the right cake mix.  This is a keeper.

I thought this cake was just "ok"-nothing spectacular-I used 2/3c oil & 3/4c water & the cake was way to crumbly-fell apart when taken out the bundt pan & when slicing-use used the caramel iv frosting & it was very tasty.

This is a delicious cake! Like many other reviewers suggested, I reduced the oil to 2/3 cup and it came out perfect. I couldn't find the butter pecan cake mix either, so I used a yellow cake mix.

Good, moist, easy to prepare cake.  Had to use the Butter Cake mix because I could not find the
Butter Pecan.  This is a great recipe site because of the review section.

I brought this cake to a birthday party for my nephew at my in-laws. Everyone loved it and many asked for the recipe. I ended up using german chocolate cake mix. Butter pecan cake mix was nowhere to be found. I also adjusted the oil and water as previously suggested and it turned out wonderfully.

Oh my!!  I used this recipe to try out my new Pampered Chef stoneware fluted pan.  It's my first ever bundt cake, and it's absolutely delicious!  Five plus stars for this gem.

Excellent recipe.  So moist and delicious, and very easy to make.  I couldn't find the Butter Pecan cake mix, so I used a "Golden Butter" mix instead.  Very, very good!!!!!  One of the best bundts I ever made.
