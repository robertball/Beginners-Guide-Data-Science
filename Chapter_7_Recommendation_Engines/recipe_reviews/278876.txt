I had a packet of spicy tuna that had been lingering in the pantry, and since I’m social distancing at the moment, I’m trying to get creative with my pantry and fridge supplies. I didn’t have bell pepper or green onions, so I subbed in a small diced carrot and added a little onion powder to the marinade. I also used some leftover brown rice. I almost didn’t add the jalapeño because I was worried it would be too spicy for me, but it was pleasantly spicy even with some sambal oelek on top. It had a nice heat, but it was never overwhelming. I will definitely make this again and try the recipe more “out of the box.” It was comforting, tasty, and filling.

This tastes like a spoonful of sushi in every bite. It is going to become one of our quick afterwork dinners and made with microwaved rice packets. Next time I'll dice a generous amount cilantro over the top to finish the dish. Cuz you know, cilantro!!!

This is everything I want in life. I love this! I ran out of rice vinegar so I used half rice vinegar and some white wine vinegar and it's still really good.  If you are subbing the vinegar, use less and taste to make sure it's not too strong. But I love this rice bowl! This will become one of my go-to lunches!

I just made this (it's super easy), and I'm a fan!  I will definitely be coming back to this one when I'm looking for a simple and tasty meal.  I nearly always have a few cans of tuna in the pantry and everything else on hand except maybe the peppers.

So far I've only eaten it warm (I literally JUST made it...), but I can tell that it will be delicious cold, too!

Delicious! I used tuna in water rather than tuna in oil (since that's what I had in the house).  I also used white vinegar, and Frank's Red Hot rather than Sriracha. Super tasty, quick, and easy.

Probably not the best version as not a lot of things are available in my country, namely:
-Seasoned Rice Vinegar (Had to substitute with Ottogi Brown Rice vinegar, which was too vinegary tasting for 1/3 cup. I think this is unseasoned so I had to add sugar/corn syrup and salt on a later attempt). Probably reduce the amount for a bit
-Tuna in Olive oil (had to use chunks in water and boil off the water and replace it with Olive oil. Not as good as the ones that came in can with plain old vegetable oil as it came out way too "fishy" for my taste
-Jalapeno pepper (fresh not available; substituted with finger peppers or pickled jalapeno)
-Unwashed long grain rice (tried unwashed; got hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. not a good idea for the quality of rice we produce. we have to wash it. probably need to add cornstarch or rice starch powder but don't know how much)

I work a night shift, so everything is closed by the time I get to work, so I needed to do some meal planning. I just finished this, putting it into three small containers, with a little left over in the bowl to try out now. I am impressed with the final result, and am looking forward to my 4 O'clock meal for the next three nights.

I guessed right on the rice vinegar quantity! Thanks for the recipe though. I also added a splash of Shaoxing rice wine because my vinegar wasn't seasoned. I didn't think it needed any more sugar or salt though. With leftover rice this went together in about 10 minutes and wow, it's great!  Good enough to serve at parties even. Thanks CJ for an awesome new dish!

Didn't love this one. Tried it warm and cold but something about the mix of flavors was not to my liking. Can't say that my husband or sons ( all young adults) liked it either. It got eaten so it wasn't horrible but just not something any of us really enjoyed so I will not be making this again.

Strangely compelling.  This was simple and true to the videos statement, stuff I already had in the kitchen.  I also had fun racing the rice with the prep work. The sushi vinegar is a nice acid with the salt of the tuna and the heat of the peppers.  Fast.

I was intimidated about using the amount of rice wine vinegar, but you can't even tell! This recipe is fast and delicious, even the kids loved it! It is very adaptable, I didn't have any peppers or onions; so I grated carrots, used broccoli slaw and chives. I also whipped siracha mayo for the adults.

I made this rice bowl for my boyfriend and me. We both loved it! I used a couple of foil packs of smoked salmon and added ginger and garlic. (personal preference)
let it set for a day and stir in a handful of veg, I used cabbage shreds.
A must try and our newest lunchbox fave!

Other than substituting fresh dungeons crab for the tuna, I made it identical to the recipe.  It was a hit!  Will definitely make it again. May try edamame the next time.

Made it exactly as the recipe called for except I had to double it so there’s enough for hubby and I! I like to eat it topped with furikake or the seaweed wrappers! Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Yummy! I felt it had too much vinegar, but other than that we enjoyed it! I also cooked the veggies a little, but next time I will leave them raw as the recipe suggests for extra crunch and more varied texture.

This is a keeper for us. Used cheap water packed tuna and sushi rice because that's what we had. It's inexpensive, easy, tasty and not terrible on the calories. Sometimes that's exactly what you want/need.

I am slowly trying to build a tolerance to spicy foods and this was perfect! I generally don’t like spicy foods but this was delicious and full of flavor.

Way too vinegary, to the point that I had trouble finishing it. Normal sushi rice uses 1-2.5 Tbsp of vinegar per cup of uncooked rice, this recipe uses 5.3. If I try this recipe again, I'll cut the vinegar in half.

I didn't have green onions or lemon on hand but I got the idea of what it was meant to taste like. As with most of the dishes I've tried, it's essentially great, excepting that I had to adjust the ratios for one reason or another--in this case, it was a bit too vinegary for me, and not spicy enough.

Way, way, WAY too much vinegar.  It was all I could taste.  Felt like my mouth was being stripped with paint thinner.  I have no idea what the rest of the dish might have tasted like.

I've made this using kimchi, tuna in olive oil (don't use in water), leftover jasmine rice, topped with scallions. Awesome and filling.

I made this dish for my mother-in-law that doesn't eat red meat when the rest of us had beef Fajitas.   I made the dish exactly to recipe and it was a hit.  Very tasty and easy to make.

I loved it! I had fresh "false albacore" given to me by a friend and rice in my freezer so this came together even quicker. My hub isn't a fan of hot tuna so I cooked off a small piece and made this.  I had this for breakfast and lunch one day and lunch another day.. I do add a bit more heat to mine and It was delicious and I will definitely make it again.
