I've been making this recipe for 20 years.  It has always been a favorite.  I often eliminate the celery.  I've also used other onions rather than red in a pinch (red is mostly for color).

These days I use low-fat mayo rather than fat free.  South Beach diet has changed my ways...the fat free just adds carbs.

Mmmm!  This was a great twist on tuna salad. And so healthy to boot!  I also used a little bit less broccoli/cauliflower than it called for.  I used fat free mayo.  The only thing this lacked was a little bit of flavor - I sprinkled in some dill, garlic powder & sea salt and a little bit of red wine vinegar.  I just ate it straight from the bowl!

I made this recipe as written, and I think it's a little heavy on the vegetables.  It was hard to find the tuna in the finished product.  Next time I'm going to try using half the listed amount of veggies, and experiment with various spices.  Nice and healthy though - thanks!

I'm a tuna freak, so I'm always looking for new ways to make this traditional salad. This was really great and I also added some chopped english cucumber, plus my usual garlic and onion powders and black pepper. I just used my good ole' rich in everything Hellmans. Terrific recipe and thanks!

I omitted the celery due to taste. When I was eating, I found it too be a bit too cold for my tastes, and also thought it needed a little something. I added some shredded cheddar cheese and warmed it up in the microwave. A yummy, healthy lunch.

Great recipe, and it does make a good amount! Added a little garlic and some horseraddish to add a little bite. Will definitely make this one again.

I made this with canned chicken, and then followed the recipe exactly.  It was delicious!  It makes A LOT, so like the other poster, I would recommend halving the recipe.  It's a great thing to make on a Sunday afternoon for a few lunches during the week.   I'll definitely be making this often.

This is a four star with the addition of an extra can of tuna and generous application of red wine vinegar - otherwise it was a bit bland

I didn't have cauliflower so I used carrots. Chopping all the veggies finely as mentioned turns the salad into a colorful spread.  Following some reviewers suggestions I added garlic powder, dill (I used pickle juice), and pepper. This salad could easily carry many combinations of flavors.

This recipe, as is, was too bland for me. Using some other reviewers' ideas, this turned out to be very good! I added dill, garlic powder, and some vinegar.

Tried it and omitted the mayo, used sour cream instead. Added cucumber, garlic powder, salt, pepper, dill pickle vinegar and spiral macaroni, instead of the pita bread. My family and I enjoyed it very much. On a very hot day it is wonderful to have this tuna salad.

The recipe called for a little too much veggies, so I halved the broccoli and cauliflower. I also used Barbie's Tuna Salad as a base(halved the mayo). The addition of the veggies really helps with the crunchiness of the salad & doubles the amount of tuna salad.

very good.  extremely hearty.  it's a great way to add those needed veggies.  i placed ours on whole wheat pita bread and served with tomatoes.  a very good meal.  unfortunately, we had used our last red onion the night before, so i can't wait to try it again with all the ingredients.

This is great for incorporating more veggies in the traditional tuna sandwich. That said, even though I left out the celery you could barely taste the tuna. Either add an extra can or cut the veggie down to 1/4 each. Seasoning; I added both black pepper and garlic powder which simply disappeared as flavours. Make sure to generously season to taste with whatever herbs or spices you like, as well as some acidic like lemon juice or a mild vinegar (maybe even pickle juice!). i like the idea of adding horseradish for bite, but hubby-to-be wouldn't let me ;) I only use full fat mayo (sorry healthy peeps, it taste better and I'd rather just use less of it) but less, maybe 2-3 TBsps. at most. I processed it with an equal amount of sour cream (full fat, tastes better just use less) and two small avocados. Creamy deliciousness, but definitely add salt (I can hear y'all shuddering!) if you're using avocados because they need a just a bit to bring out their flavour. This is served great anyway you like- pita, tortilla, bakery buns, toast bread, etc. Add some lettuce and tomato and it's perfect-o! Oh, and this makes a ton. If you're trying to feed this to picky kiddies (or men) process the broccoli and cauliflower into tiny bits (not puree) to hide them. :)

Thank you!  I would never have thought to use broccoli in my tuna salad.  I nixed the cauliflower and celery and added some red pepper flakes. Since I always use celery with tuna and it is such a strong flavor, I just went broc all the way.  Husband AND three-year-old loved it!  Boy ate by the spoonful and didn't realize he was eating broc.  Husband and I had it on fresh deli burger buns.  yay!

Yum! Good recipe. It had a lot of body and flavor to it, but it met with my mom's approval too and she's on a diet. I will make this again ... and I'm glad to have leftovers for tomorrow's lunch!

This is very good, and healthy too!  I didn't have any cauliflower but next time will add it. I used half FF mayo and half plain yogurt.  It needed a little more taste so I sprinkled  garlic salt and pepper on it.  If you're watching your sodium intake, use some lemon juice. I diced up a left over tomato...and it gave it brightened it up!  Pimentoes would work too.  I didn't have any macaroni, so I used the small seashell pasta.  Looked almost too pretty to eat! This makes A LOT...so I halved the recipe...and it's still a lot.  Enjoyed....and thanks for your recipe!

I wanted to love this recipe.  I made this recipe as written, initially.  It was very bland. I read what others did to spice it up and added the extra tuna. It's edible, but I won't be making it again.

Excellent!! So far I've made this just as the recipe calls for a couple of times, and it's been great each time!! Like a lot of people, I've been trying to make a few dishes ahead of time for quick cheap meals for work and home, and this fits right into the rotation!! This is a bit of work up front, but is quite worth it, and makes just about a gallon bag full of tuna salad, so whenever I feel like a snack, or a tuna sandwich for work, I just get out the bag, tender my $.88 loaf of bread, plop a couple of big spoonfuls on the bread, and I've got a sandwich!! This recipes has a great crunch, a great blend of flavors, and doesn't feel like you're eating mayonnaise right out of the jar, like many tuna salad recipes do. In fact, when it's all done, the mayonnaise is just barely enough to hold the ingredients together, so it definitely feels like this tuna salad is more healthy stuff than mayonnaise, which is a plus. With that said, it does fall apart, and you will be dropping pieces of broccoli and such when you eat it, so maybe don't eat it while driving, but otherwise, it's not too messy. I would like to add that I've been using pre-diced fresh onions from the grocery store, which is pretty much all I used when a recipe calls for onions, and it makes this recipe much quicker and easier to make!! Also, the cost of canned tuna seems to vary widely, so if anyone is put off from making this due to the cost of the tuna (like I often am,) shop around a bit, and you'll find it on sale

my rating is for the recipe as it is. it was good but like other ppl said, lacked a little flavor. I did what another person suggested and added fresh dill, a dash of red wine vinegar, garlic powder and a dash of salt and pepper and it was wonderful!

This tuna salad recipe is my favorite so far! I LOVE the fact that I can sneak some veggies into my kids sandwich as they are eating lunch! I was unsure of all that cauliflower that I was putting in there, because I am not a fan of it, but I didn't bother me! Tasted GREAT!
