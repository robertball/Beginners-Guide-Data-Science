I used purple cabbage and added sliced leeks and jalapeños when I added the cabbage to the pan. Per others' suggestion I also added salt. This was so good!

I been cooking cabbage with butter for years! Being a widow, I don’t want/ need a whole head of cabbage. I slice a wedge, cover,  and put it in the microwave for 3 minutes. Add desired butter and salt. Microwave 1 minute more and enjoy!

So Good!  Was really surprised this was as good as it was.  Cooking time was a bit more for me than written but otherwise, really good.

Very nice! I had no idea how to cook cabbage without bacon and being soggy! Add whatever spices you prefer and be sure to cut quite thin strips. 5 star, thank you!!
