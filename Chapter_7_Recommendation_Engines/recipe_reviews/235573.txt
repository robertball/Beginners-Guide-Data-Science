FANTASTIC!  Best squash soup I've ever had, and love that there's no fattening cream involved. So smooth and hearty. Hmmmm. Made it without apple juice.  I thought it might mask the sweet squah and yam flavors. Didn't miss it.  Perfect on a blustery Fall night.

Very good! I used a tabletop blender for the vegetables rather than an immersion, so it came out much smoother than what you see in the picture. The cayenne is a tad overpowering--I recommend using 1/4 tsp instead of 1/2.

I will start by saying this was delicious, and I will absolutely make it again! 
This time I followed the recipe very closely. The biggest change is that, not having an immersion blender, I boiled all the roasted veggies with everything else for a few minutes and put in some good effort with a normal potato masher. To add a touch of creaminess I added about 5 tbsp of neufchatel cheese. The end result was creamy soup with small chunks of roasted veggies rather than a fully blended soup. Which was awesome. 
My only critique is that it was a little too sweet. Next time, I will halve or possibly skip the apple cider in favor of relying on the actual apples for a more subtle flavor.
I served it with herb stuffing roasted in the hollows of the squash, added at the 20 minute mark and honey butter crescent rolls.

Loved it but made a few adjustments.    I added 1/2 tsp of curry and substituted chicken broth for vegge broth, added some thyme, a bay leaf, butter, and honey.  It turned out complex with flavor and savory.

I thought the soup was to tart, tasted like green apples.  I only used 2 granny smith and the juice.  I added a little sugar, a little cream, and finally bought another squash to add to it.  To much work for me and to sour.

This is very good. I took a shortcut and cooked the vegetables in the broth and apple cider instead of roasting them. It still came out awesome.  I used cayenne pepper and curry, and oh my!

First time I made this I accidentally used apple cider vinegar...but I tried again and followed the recipe except I used 2 Braeburn apples instead of Granny Smith. The soup is delicious! Roasting the veggies makes all the difference in taste.

Good flavor and texture.  I would decrease the cayenne because it definitely had a bite to it.  Also, adding a garnish like a dollop of sour cream and/or crispy fried onions really adds to it.

I followed the recipe , except in respect to the cayenne.  As I don't like a lot of spice, I only used 1/8 tsp of cayenne but added 1/4 tsp curry.  The soup is delicious

I didn't have any rosemary so I added some yellow (mild) curry powder to taste. It was delicious.

Delicious! Very flavorful and not too heavy as some soups like this are. I like a soup like this without any heavy cream.

I just finished this recipe and it just tastes like garlic and onions. I am very disappointed. Please message me if you have any tips to fix this- Sour cream? More carrots or squash? Almost two hours for something nearly inedible. :(

Very tasty.  Takes a while to make, but worth it.  And it makes a lot!  I toned down on the cayenne and think I could have cut back a tad more.  Good flavors,  great texture and good vegetarian recipe!

Really flavourful recipe. I have made it twice - once with curry and once with cayenne. Both versions were very popular at our house. My favourite butternut squash recipe.

I roasted the butternut squash,  1 large carrot cut in large pieces, 1 large onion cut in half, & 4 half stalks of celery. I did not have whole garlic to roast. When the veg cooled off I cut everything into chunks & put in a soup pot with the cooked squash & two large apples also cut into chunks. I added 4 cups of chicken broth, as I did not have vegetable broth or apple cider. Brought soup to a boil, added nutmeg, cayenne, & minced garlic. Then shut it off to cool a bit. Put it all through the food processor to puree, then back in the pot added 1 cup half & half cream. This is a great recipe but a lot more work in prep of vegetables. I did enjoy it though and will make it again.

This is a good recipe.  I have several squash soup recipes that are much easier to prepare.  I may make this again for a special occasion but not for everyday when I want something quick to make.

This soup is delicious!! I didn't have a sweet potato or Apple cider so I added a little more carrot and an extra Apple. It is a wonderful sweet/spicey  soup. I will definitely make this one again!

This turned out really good, but my kids found it to be too spicy with the red cayenne pepper.  I would leave that spice out entirely.

Been under the weather for the past week.  Made this using crushed red pepper flakes since I was out of cayenne powder.  The added kick helped clear my head, roasted garlic I'm sure will help my cold, not to mention that  house smelled delightful while preparing.  I will make this again.  Might try the curry next time as suggested in recipe
