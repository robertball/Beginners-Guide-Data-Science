There is a mistake with this recipe. The recipe calls for 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard, not 1/2 cup. I am the one who submitted this recipe, and e-mailed the staff about the typo. This is a great recipe, and I hope everyone enjoys it. Molly

We use a garlic clove and a large tomato cut up instead of tomato sauce and lose the chili powder. I cook it on the stove instead of in a slow cooker for 5+ hours. This was one of my grandmother's favorite recipes back in the 1950's when soy sauce was an exotic ingredient and very difficult to find. I cook it in memory of her and luckily my husband thinks it is great too. He calls it German pulled beef.

I would like to try this recipe, but I want to know if the ingredient, Dry Mustard is really 1/2 cup. This seems like a lot of Dry Mustard

This was enjoyable.  I used a small amount of liquid smoke, and next time I would definitely add garlic.  The recipe doesn't specify, but I used apple cider vinegar.  A little molasses would really put this over the top for a crockpot recipe.

I also added a little garlic, molasses , and Worcestershire. I was surprised at how long this needed to cook - I thought it would disintegrate, but it really needed this amount of time to tenderize.  It was quite good with coleslaw.

It had a little too much vinegar flavor for us. I used tomatos paste with a little water I stead of tomatos sauce because it's what I had on hand. I added a little store bought BBQ sauce. That helped. Next time I'll use less vinegar.

I would use less chili powder. I added some honey to give it a little sweetness and I also added some sweet baby rays bbq sauce for extra flavor. Served it with potato rolls.  Every one loved it.
