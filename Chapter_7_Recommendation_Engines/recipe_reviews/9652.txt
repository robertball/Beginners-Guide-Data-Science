Blueberries are my husbands very favorite and these cookies were very good! I freeze blueberries when they are in season and used frozen berries in this recipe. No problem.

After reading the comments, I reduced almond ext to 1/4 tsp, and used 3/4 tsps 
vanilla.  These cookies tasted divine, esp. warm -- like a little bit of heaven, I
absolutely cannot rave enough about the taste.  They are very difficult to make, 
though, because you want to make sure each cookie has at least one berry,
but the cookies should be small because they spread a lot in the oven.  Also, as
another commented, they collapse -- when removed from the sheet, some of the 
bottoms literally dropped out, so I would suggest cooling on a flat surface, or
on a rack with a very tight weave.

The first time I followed the recepie exactly. Making these cookies made me realize that I'm not too big on the bitter almond taste.  Second time around, I substituded the almond extract for vanilla and I also didn't cool them, but they still turned out great. They were so delicious, that they made me feel guilty afterward, but it's nothing a little walk in the park won't fix.  I will definatly make these cookies again.  Thankyou!!! : )

These cookies were the bomb!  I didn't have any lemons so I substituted 1/2 t. lemon extract for the lemon zest and only used 1/2 t. vanilla.  I used my small Pampered Chef cookie scoop and each cookie turned out perfectly! They are a little crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My 15 year old son loved them!  Thanks for a great, easy recipe!

These cookies llok and taste like blueberry muffin tops!  They freeze well (open container to air to defrost or cookies will get gooey) and stay soft for a long time.  The almond flavoring can be reduced if you aren't big on strong flavor, or substitute vanilla flavoring.

Wonderful cookies that are sort of a cross between a cookie and a muffin. One suggestion...refrigerate overnight. The first time we made these we refrigerated overnight and they turned out wonderful. The second time we started them in the morning and baked in the early afternoon, letting the dough sit for about 4 hours like the recipe said. They didn't come out quite as good....still good but a little soggy. I plan to make these again and prepare the dough the night before.

These are really plain...not very flavorful.  I added a glaze of 1/4 cup each sour cream and sugar, 2 tbs orange juice and 2 tbs butter- boiled in in a saucepan for 2 minutes then glazed the cookies with it.  I think they improved significantly with a glaze added- I thought about doing a lemon glaze too.  Even a strusel kind of topping added to them before they are baked would probably make them tasty too- but this recipe as is is not very flavorful.

These cookies were dubbed "Blueberry Bombers" by friends and family (because they're the bomb). I did make a few changes to the recipe: 1/4 cup shortening (butter flavored if you have it) 1/4 cup butter 5 Tbsp of lemon yogurt (instead of milk) 6 oz (half package) of white chocolate chips 1 tsp vanilla extract (instead of almond)  I made 5 dozen of these for a party and they were GONE in half an hour! huge hit

Cooks Illustrated has a blueberry scone recipe that is a little tricky. This cookie recipe makes a cookie that is identical to the scones but a whole lot easier and, most importantly, more numerous!! They're delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, and before baking, I sprinkled a little turbinado sugar on the cookies for that crunchy top. I also sprinkled a little nutmeg on some of them which was very good, but the cookies were just as delicious without. I only made a few and put the rest of the dough back in the fridge so I can have fresh ones whenever necessary for the next few days!!

Good flavor and easy to make, but if you don't eat them all right away they get really soggy and gross.  I probably won't make these again.

I used orange zest instead of lemon and vanilla instead of almond. I chilled the dough for about 3 hours and these cookies turned out great! I got 39 cookies from the recipe and my husband LOVES them. They are not a very sweet cookie, but are very flavourful, as another reviewer commented, they taste like muffin tops. I definitely recommend chilling the dough, by my third tray of baking the dough had been out of the fridge for about half an hour and was getting a little difficult to form cookies. I didn't so much drop them, as form them with a teaspoon. Also, I removed them from the hot tray to a cool one, using a metal spatula, instead of using a rack to cool. Also try to use very small blueberries so that the fruit is easily shared between the cookies. I rolled the berries in flour prior to adding it to the dough and I had no problems with the dough turning blue.

These were okay cookes.... but they're like cuffins (muffin cookies). I chilled the over night which I found to be better, and they cooked up real nice. They taste the best straight out of the oven....

I loved them! Everyone said they were delicious! But, they got REALLY REALLY soft overnight. I did not chili the dough & not sure if that could have caused the problem.  If I make them again, I'll be sure to chill or eat them all the same day!

They were certainly something new, but they were less sweet than I expected, and didn't flatten out the way I wanted them to. I substituted the almond extract for vanilla (because I am a vanilla fiend), and ended up coating the cookies in a cinnamon-sugar mix to make them sweeter. I'm thinking some white chocolate chips in the mix might have made them very tasty.

I've had this recipe saved for awhile but was always nervous about trying a blueberry cookie.  These were great though and I will be making them again for sure.  I agree with some other reviews I read that they taste like the top of a blueberry muffin.  I did have some trouble with the dough being too sticky and the blueberries mushed into the dough and gave the cookies kind of a grey look.  Next time I will be more careful when stirring in my blueberries.

This is a nice change of texture on my Christmas cookie platter.  They are light and cakey.  To be perfectly honest, I don't make them with blueberries but rather with currants.  My mother took her favorite cookie recipe to the grave with her unfortunately, and I've been trying to replicate it ever since.  This one comes as close as I've gotten tho' Mom's were spongier.  I'm sure these are wonderful with blueberries too.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.

If you find it hard to contol yourself, don't make these cookies!  They are more like small cakes that look like cookies.  It's almost impossible to stop eating them!

These do taste a bit like muffin tops, and they don't spread much at all.  I also added a half cup of unsweetened coconut to the batter and they tasted great!

Wow! these were very good. Thanks for sharing this, I'll defiantly be making some for my family. The alterations I used: 1/4 tsp almond, 3/4 vanilla. It still had the almond taste, but wasn't bitter. Also a few drops of lemon juice (not the zest) I had wealthy cup of very large blueberries... it was probably more like 1 1/4 cup in total :) I also read the reviews and did as mentioned.. Put some parchment paper down.. my blueberries really juiced and I'm happy for my pan. My only issue was probably if there wasn't a blueberry in my bite it didn't taste as good. And then the fact that I love them so much more warm.

These were great!  I sell cookies and other baked goods to the girls at work, and these sold very well.  Because of their almost cake-like consistency, I put homemade vanilla ice cream or blueberry sorbet (depending on who was on a diet or not!) sandwiched in between 2 of them.  Awesome!!!

Very tasty - just like muffin tops as other reviews have mentioned! It's a great way to use blueberries, and I snuck in a little lemon juice in there for a little extra kick. Not my absolute favourite cookie, but it's definitely up there.

These were pretty good.  I substituted dried blueberries for the fresh and added 2 drops of Lorann blueberry flavoring.  Will make again.

Everyone loves these. I used butter in place of the shortening with no problems. The almond and lemon flavors work great with the blueberries.

These are delicous with the following changes as suggested by other people.  Decrease the Almond flavor to 1/4 tsp and add 3/4 tsp vanilla.  I didn't have a lemon so I used orange zest.  Delicious!!!

I love the texture of these cookies. All the cookie I've baked turned out harder/crispier than advertised ("soft, chewy cookie", etc) but this was perfectly soft. I omitted the lemon zest because I didn't have any, so maybe that's why I didn't really like my batch. Also, the almond flavour was really overwhelming which I didn't like, maybe it had to do with the absence of lemon zest? Overall, I think that this recipe has great potential and I would definitely try it again with the lemon zest and less almond extract. I even sprinkled some sugar on top for more sweetness! :)   Other reviews say that it gets softer as it sits around but I don't think that's a bad thing, as long as it has good taste. I didn't finish all mine because it was soft with bad flavour.

Measured 1/2 of ingredients left out salt added 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract- added small egg scooped out half of egg yellow 3/4 cups of blueberries and instead of shortening used I can't believe its not butter and instead of mixing all the sugar folded in some at end with the fresh blueberries so they would have a little sweetness themselves- did not chill just popped in oven until light golden brown peaks-  Thanks for the idea! I use the silcone baking sheets so the little blueberry juice was not a problem and they were not soggy, even with a splash of lemon juice on top of the zest. OMG they were moist and wonderful like a blueberry cupcake. Thanks for the idea! Two of us ate a few each and sure will finish off the rest tomorrow. Oh I also use a ge counter oven.

I didn't think that these cookies would turn out the way they did.  There one of the BEST cookies i've made.  Everyone that tries these asked what bakery they came from. They can't believe there home made!  Can't wait to make some more when it come blueberry season.

I made these for a Blueberry festival.  They were delicious! The lemon flavor matches the bluberry flavor perfectly. I omitted the almond extract and increased the amount of vanilla to about 3/4 tsp. I'm making them again right now.

Very light and fluffy.  I flattened down each cookie with a fork dipped in water and then sprinkled each with a little sugar.  Very muffin/cake like.

I thought this recipe was very good. The texture turned out normal like a cookie. I was afraid it would be gooey like other reviews said. I did use Crisco which give me the best cookies every single time. I will try butter crisco next time for this recipe to give it a more golden color and buttery flavor. I omitted the lemon zest and did 1/2 t almond and a 1/2 t vanilla and it was tasty. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Yum!!  The first round didn't make it off the cooling rack onto the platter!  They disappeared too quickly!  I had no problem with the cookies melting too much or falling apart.  I let them cool briefly on the cookie sheet before putting on the cooling rack.  Since I love blueberries, I added extra blueberries, and had no problem getting several berries in each cookie.  They taste like little blueberry muffins!  The almond flavoring was great (and I think part of what makes it taste like muffins), but I might try vanilla next time.  Thank you so much for such a wonderful recipe!

The cookies turned out good, not too sweet like other cookies.  Although I would add more lemon zest.  The almond extract does not seem necessary, I would try lemon extract next time.

8 8 14...  http://allrecipes.com/recipe/9652/blueberry-drop-cookies/ ... Yum yum yum yum yum yum yum ... yum yum yum!  I liked these.  Can you tell?  :D  'Only changes were slight, based on reviews: Used 1/2t each vanilla & almond, no lemon zest, refrig'd overnight - actually two nights.  :o  A light, soft (but not cakelike) sugar cookie.  I made mine larger, only got 2 1/2 dozen. Twelve minute ones were done, but light, more delicate; closer to fourteen minute ones were beginning to get light brown patches, very slight crispness.  Both are very good.  I tried the glaze (less the orange juice) BN61079 listed in review - added a slight cheesecakeish flavor.  I say "Yay!"  :D  Too close to call if they were better with or without glaze.  'Only somewhat negative was that I couldn't reuse the cookie sheet since the berry juice baked on.  'Wonder how subbing half cranberries would be ... Fourth of Julyish?!  May-be.  :) ...  K, 15, asked what kind they were ... "They're so good!"

I have made this recipe twice now. Both times, I didn't have lemon zest, but used 1/2 t of lemon extract, at the suggestion of another reviewer. Additionally, I didn't refrigerate the dough and they turned out great! Not sure what the refrigeration period does for them, but we liked them as-is!

My husband LOVED these cookies and so did everyone else at church.  Will definitely do again. (Can never put enough blueberries.) One tip - make sure there are not blueberries on the bottom of the drop or they just fall out of the cookie.

fantastic cookies! i wasn't excited about the idea of lemon zest so i took that out along with the almond extract, added 2tsp of orange extract (since blueberries and oranges are an awesome combo), and the result was delicious! my whole family loved them. the only downside was that the cookies are a bit cake-like in texture (chewy cookies are my fav). also, some of my cookies were kind of runny, but who doesn't like sticky deliciousness? they're still wonderful and definitely something i'm going to keep making!

I had a lot of blueberries on hand and so I decided to make these cookies. I used butter instead of shortening, but also replaced 3 tablespoons of it with plain yogurt (it came out fine). Since I used the plain yogurt, I slightly cut the amount of lemon zest. I used vanilla extract, increased the blueberries by a little less than 1/4 of a cup, and replaced 1/4 c of the white sugar for brown sugar. With or without the changes, this recipe is very delicious :)

Delicious! Had trouble keeping myself from eating all of the cookie dough before I even baked them. I personally love lemon so added the juice from half a lemon along with the zest from the entire lemon. Substituted vanilla for the almond extract (didn't have any almond) and used half and half instead of milk (didn't realize we were out and so used the half and half as a surprisingly excellent alternative). The cookies are irresistible when warm as the hot, molten blueberries should be illegal!

Although a yummy recipe and a great alternative for using some leftover blueberries, I don't agree with the muffin top comparision.   The night of making them I actually wasn't overly impressed but the then next day they were so much better for some reason - I couldn't stop eating them! I took the advice of others and did half almond extract & half vanilla.  My youngest didn't like them, I guess they felt they got cheated out of chocolate chips.  Although my oldest would pick out blueberries and loved the cookie part.

Pretty good cookies.. I thought I could cheat and use frozen blueberries, WRONG! Frozen blueberries will turn your cookies.. blue. I have blue swirl cookies lol..  Next time I make them I think I will use fresh berries, and I want to try to make the cookies a little more substantial.. they stayed really soft, even after I took them off the pan. I may need to just bake them a bit longer.. I don't know it was really hard to tell how done they were seeing as they were blue.

My family really enjoyed these little morsels. We had a bunch of blueberries from my sister's garden and were running out of ideas on how to use them. These cookies were good and a fun way around chocolate chip ones.

These are lovely little cookies.  They really are like little mini muffin tops--delicious!  I refrigerated overnight then baked.  They don't spread too much and browned nicely (without browning too much) in my oven at 15 minutes.  I froze them to stop myself from eating them!  I didn't change the recipe at all and didn't notice any bitter taste, spreading, etc.  Perhaps the key is refrigerating overnight--whatever, they were great and worked well.  Thanks for the recipe!

After reading other reviews I made several alterations to this so I could use up the leftover blueberries we had on hand.  I used less milk  (a splash or 2 at most), vanilla extract instead of almond flavoring, added walnuts and chocolate chips and used an 8" x 11.5" x 2" glass baking pan.  I also froze the batter for an hour before baking and sprinkled with powdered sugar and cinnamon when removed from the oven.  Turned out great as a substitute for muffins/cookies.  Would make again but the title should be changed from cookies to muffins as the texture is not like any chocolate chip cookie I've had.  Thanks for the base recipe.

These were surprisingly good and very flavorful.  I followed others' advice and did half almond and half vanilla extract.  Did not measure zest, but got in a fair bit, appeared to be more than recommended.  Will make again.  Made a lot of dough, so I portioned it into saran-wrapped rolls for future noshing.  Good eats!

Not my favorite cookie, but good none the less! I loved the lemonyness of them, and they were so fluffy, it was beautiful! They were like teeny tiny little muffin imposters. :) But they really were a unique cookie, so they deserve a thumbs up!

WONDERFUL!!! I am a blueberry fanatic and have been trying to find every way possible to cook with them. I stuck to the recipe and I am glad I did because these are perfect! More flavorful than most reviewers stated. Maybe just different tastes. I am baking small fruit cookies for my wedding and these are now on the list! Thank you so much for sharing, I hope I can still fit in my dress!

Fantastic cookie. I cut the milk in half, used 1/4 lemon extract instead of zest and vanilla instead of almond extract. I also used fresh large blueberries (not as sweet), they were quite firm so I was able to cut them in half. I didn't have to refrigerate and they turned out great!

These were delicious! I love almond flavored everything. Which was awesome when I saw Almond Extract as one of the ingredients. I actually halved the recipe because I only had half the amount of blueberries.. but I kept the amount of 1 teaspoon of almond extract & added a teaspoon of vanilla extract, they turned out wonderful!

I loved these. I used /12 tsp lemon extract instead of zest (I have no lemons). Use 1/2tsp of vanila and 1/2tsp of almond extract. When making I found the dough a little runny so I added a little more flour. Let the dough sit overnight as someone suggested. YUMMMY! Will definately make again.

All my taste-testers dropped to their knees.  This is a great recipe.  However, due to the nature of blueberries (a very WET fruit), you will have to make adjustments depending on the crop. I used small, compact berries, so I cut the milk by half.  I did not want extra moisture in the dough from broken berries so I mixed half gently in the top half of the dough, baked it, then mixed the rest as I scooped.  Lastly, I used real butter for flavor.  They did NOT taste like muffins. This is a delicate cookie that does not keep as nicely as others, but a very special treat indeed.

Light and moist! You can make them all year round with frozen berries. I like them sprinkled with powdered sugar and a glass of iced tea for an easy, refreshing summer treat.

These cookies are great!  I followed the recipe exactly except added some sugar sprinkled on top.  Also, I didn't have time to let the dough cool in the fridge.  They still turned out beautifully!  I will make these again.

I loved these cookies!  My husband really enjoyed them, too.  I opted to use the full amount of almond extract (no vanilla like some people recommended).  I'm glad I did!  The almond and the zest make the cookies so flavorful.

My cookies didn't spread out a lot on the pan like a lot of other people experienced.  They came out with the texture exactly of a cookie.  Yummo!  

The only changes I made to the recipe were that I used the butter-flavored Crisco shortening, and I added about a third of a cup extra blueberries.

They came out perfectly!

Also, I live in high altitude.  The 12 minutes were plenty to cook the cookies at high altitude!

These cookies tasted pretty good, and were a good way to use up blueberries. They were much lighter than regular cookies. They were not very sweet. I added cinnamon, which gave them a little extra flavor.

Well, I will give it five for now, cause I can usually tell when the batter is good tasting so will the cookies be. So, I completed the batter and stuck it in the fridge over night here and I will take it out tomorrow morning and cook them. But so far, the batter is excellent, I assed just a touch of Lemon extract, that is the only thing I altered, should be great! Thanks for this recipe.

My husband just told me these were excellent! He can't have chocolate so this is a great substitute for my personal favorite- chocolate chip cookies. I added a little lemon juice and halved the almond extract and added a drizzle of vanilla extract. I also ran out of white flour so I had to substitute about 1/4 cup of the flour with wheat flour. They still taste GREAT! Thanks for the recipe- will make again!

I substituted vanilla for the almond extract and I used butter flavored Crisco which did add a nice buttery flavor. They really are similar to muffin tops but I did have a problem with them falling apart.  Still good to eat though. Any suggestions on how to make them not fall apart?

these are AMAZING.. I substituted vanilla for the almond extract and forgot to buy a lemon for the zest.  I also used a cup and a half of frozen blueberries.. I have only made one batch so far and I already ate 2 of the 5 cookies.. so light and sweet and good!

I also changed up this recipe a bit as it seemed a bit boring once read.  I decreased the almond extract to 1/2 t. and increased the lemon zest.  I also used dried blueberries and they came out great in texture.  At first bite I wasn't impressed, but after the cookie was gone I had another!  :)  I will try the butter flavor crisco next time as I think I was missing the butter flavor.

Muffin tops are the best part of the muffin; so good, in fact, that an episode of Seinfeld was dedicated to them. So if you like muffin tops, you will LOVE these cookies. They look and taste just like a muffin top. When I made them for a party, my husband gave me a doubtful look; then he tried one, and he was sold.

These were very tasty, but acutally too moist!  I think that's why some people had trouble with the bottoms falling off.  I cooled mine on the sheet (I use parchment paper, so there was no problem with sticking to the cookie sheet).  The problem for me occurred when I placed them in a plastic container for storage.  They became even more moist!  My family gobbled them up none the less because they did taste really good.  My husband also commented that they were almost too moist. Wonder if anyone has any hints for correcting this?  Next time I make them, I might try leaving them sit out overnight uncovered, and just hope they dry out without becoming stale.

Ok, I followed directions to a "T", subing vanilla for almond. While it was very good, after taking the cookies out of the oven & off the sheet, they fell apart. Instead of wasting the batter, I used a 8" round baking pan and made one big cookie...this worked great!!

These are very good cookies.  I didn't have any almond extract so I used butter flavor extract.  Don't be scared to bake these at 375.  I was but they turned out great.

These taste amazing! The dough is a little difficult to work with if you're using big juicy blueberries, but beyond that they're really easy.

After reading reviews the only change I made was replacing half the almond extract with vanilla and a little less zest. These cooks held up well and were very pretty. Personally a little to bland for me and my family, I like a cookie with a little more sweetness but I may try this recipe again.

Very good - used butter flavored shortening and instead of almond extract and lemon zest, just used vanilla. Subbed 1/4 cup of whole fat vanilla yogurt for milk and sprinkled a little sugar on top before baking. I did not have time to chill, but they were not very runny because of the yogurt instead of milk. They don't look so pretty, the blueberries do burst and and the juice runs, but they are pretty tasty. Also floured the blueberries before mixing.

I made these cookies today and was quite pleased.  I hate to admit that I made some substitutions only because they were what I had on hand.  I used butter instead of margarine (personal preference), buttermilk only because I was out of regular (didn't seem to make any difference), vanilla instead of almond (again personal preference) which didn't seem to make any difference, and about 1-1/2 cups blueberries (which turned out to be a little too much).  I used my small cookie scoop and got just a little over 4 doz. cookies.  Crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.  Thirteen minutes in my oven was just right.  My hubby really liked these cookies, and I thought they were quite good as well.  Will definitely make them again some time

I used butter vice  shortening and almond milk since we didn't have regular milk and the cookies turned out great. My only critique is the directions that said 'Drop dough by teaspoon fulls" on to cookie sheets.  Even rounded teaspoons would have been much too small.  I used a small one tablespoon cookie scoop and it made 32 nice cookies.

Fantastic cookies! I didn't have time to chill them at all, just mixed the ingredients and baked them.
They turned out really yummy! I substituted yogurt for the milk.

Made this according to the directions. Not a big fan of almond extract so next time I'm going to use vanilla extract and also use butter instead of shortening.    ;^) Kids liked them.

I substituted the milk with fresh lemon juice and added vanilla instead of almond extract.  Froze my fresh blueberries which made it easier to incorporate into the dough.  Topped with a lemon glaze (1-1/2 cups powdered sugar and two tablespoons  fresh lemon juice).  Delicious.

I'm in the process of making these now (the dough is chilling). So far so good, but... am I the only one to pick up on the fact that it says to drop "teaspoonfuls" for baking? Do you have any idea how small that would be? I'm fairly certain some of my blueberries are larger than that, so I'll use my judgement and see what I get.

I think these just might be my new favorite cookie. Followed the exact recipe except I used 3/4 teaspoon of lemon juice instead of the zest. Also happened to chill the dough for a couple extra hours. These cookies are fluffy (almost a mix between a cake and a biscuit) and oh so addictive. My family couldn't get enough of them!

These taste DELICIOUS! I substituted vanilla extract in for the almond (partially cause I didn't have any, partially because I prefer the taste of vanilla). I made a lemon glaze to go on top. Highly recommend.

Good cake like cookie.  Reminded me of a recipe I had that I can't seem to find.  Added about 1/2 cup of sliced almonds because that was in the original recipe, and I had bought them.  You could even just sprinkle a few on the top.

These cookies are delicious! When I was younger my mom had a recipe similar to this one that had gotten lost, and were desperate to find a replication of it.   I used frozen blueberries, that had been picked by my family the year before. I let the blueberries thaw, and then laid them out on paper towels to rid them of any excess juice. I used vanilla as opposed to almond extract, and they turned out perfectly sweet. The only complaint about this recipe is that it is TINY TINY TINY. I doubled the recipe, and still only got about 3 dozen cookies (about the size of an Oreo). Next time I plan on making these for all my coworkers and friends I'll buy enough to make 4 batches.

I love these cookies. I was looking for something to use up an abundance of Saskatoon berries I had in the freezer so I used them in this recipe. Very nice for a change from chocolate chip cookies.

I call these cookies "Muffin Top Cookies", cuz that's how they look, smell and taste.  Really good!  I ommitted the lemon zest b/c I didn't have any, and topped em with the brown sugar glaze found on Allrecipes' Pumpkin Cookies V (altho note that it makes twice as much as you'll need unless you double the cookie recipe). Next time I'm going to try to incorporate yogurt! Delicious!

They were pretty good, but I would spray the pan next time. I also used lower fat butter instead, and little over 1 tsp of lemon extract,  and turned out good. I like the tartness, and lemon flavor.

These are good but more like a mini cake. My office liked them. I used pureed blueberries in the recipe too just to give it an extra blueberry kick.

I could not wait to try these after reading the reviews but something went wrong.  The dough was very thick and I had to "kneed" in the blueberries which was hard to do.  It seemed like it needed more milk or something.

Odd cookies. More like cake. I did flatten them before I put them in the oven. Also used Splenda and whole wheat flour. The almond flavour was good (I added a bit extra) with the blueberry flavour.

These were great! I had to use vanilla, because I didn't have any almond extract, and there still were wonderful! I did everything else as the recipe stated and they were so good, I ate most of them myself. The rest of the family thought they were yummy! What a great way to use extra blueberries!

These are really good.  Not too sweet and a great way to use up some blueberries.  Mine turned out just as I dropped them on the sheet and did not spread, which is fine.  They were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and had the distinct flavor of blueberry pancakes, lol, which is not a bad thing (in my opinion).  The only change I made was using Splenda rather than sugar, adding 1/2tsp baking powder, and only refrigerated for about 2-3hrs.  My taste testers liked them and I think they will make a nice dessert for our cookout tonight.  UPDATE: These were a hit at the cookout!  Eevryone liked them, even the kids.  They were a nice light, easy to eat and not too sweet dessert.

These are absolutely fabulous!!! So delicious, everyone has raved. I used fresh blueberries from our weekend blueberry-picking adventure. I accidentally forgot to use the lemon zest at all but I don't think it made any difference in the recipe. I also refrigerated my dough for 24 hours because I ran out of time right after I made it. The cookies were still wonderful, we will definitely be making them again. Thanks so much!
