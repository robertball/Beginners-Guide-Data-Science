I followed the recipe except for the Jalape√±o pepper (I don't like spicy hot) and it was very good.  Thank you.

I'm not a fan of onion (sorry) unless I saute them and put them in my pasta sauce.  I instead substituted diced  kosher dill pickle.  (I KNOW, crazy right)  Went over well with my family and they aren't afraid to critique.
