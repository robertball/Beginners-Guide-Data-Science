This was much better than I expected and helped keep the overall calorie count lower on our pizza. I added some garlic powder, a quarter cup of grated Parmesan cheese, and a tablespoon of dried Italian dressing (like the kind you make yourself from a packet). Overall, very tasty and satisfying. Held up well. Texture was good- a tad spongy but not bad. I’ll totally make it again.

The taste was good but even dusting a pizza pan with flour didn't stop it from sticking. I think parchment paper would help to prevent sticking. I topped mine with white pizza sauce (from Allrecipes) along with ricotta, Italian sausage, pancetta, mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.

I proof 3 T yeast in a little water and sugar and add that, along with about 1 T baking powder. Then I increase the flour a bit to compensate. I put the dough into a huge preheated oiled cast iron pan and bake it that way.
I would recommend figuring out the number of cups of riced cauliflower to use. Some cauliflower heads are much bigger than others.

I just had the best pizza I ever had in my life and I made it!  This is great because I can eat the crust and not feel guilty because instead of a fast carb, it’s cauliflower and it tastes like regular crust!  It is delicious!

Added 1/2 cup of chia seeds, soaked in 3/4 cup of water & set in frig for 20 min. Also, 1/2 tsp of tumeric. Parchment paper needed to stop sticking.  Yum. Top with anything you like.

We only made one crust - but will make this as two next time. I used mostly almond flour with just a bit of wheat. We added sauce, mushrooms and black olives with cheese and baked an additional 15 minutes. YUMMY

This crust was the closest thing to "normal" pizza crust I've had, the consistency was very satisfying like a traditional bread but without the heavy carb load. I good after eating this instead of all bogged and bloated.

Much more satisfying pizza alternative than the low-carb shredded chicken crusts.

Important to really spread your cauliflower out so it can dry in the oven.

Well, mine does not look great, but I made it and now realize that I really need a food processor to do this. I tried my blender and it just blended the bottom. So I made with just having chopped and chopped. This recipe left out instructions on when to add toppings. Before or after baking the crust. I split the difference and baked it halfway before adding sauce etc.  Well see...

My crust was soggy but tasty. I will try it again and cook  it longer @ a higher temp. I filled my pizza crust 8 hrs. Before I cooked it so the filling probably contributed to the moist crust, too.

This is a sweet dough. My kids loved it. I added rosemary, Italian seasoning, and garlic salt. I was really surprised that we found something healthy for movie night! I will be making this again

Use parchment paper and spray oil of your choice so it comes right off and then place toppings on there! It is delicious!  I made it for all of us on my moms birthday.. she loves pizza and I am avoiding carbs... it was perfect!!! I used pizza sauce, follow your heart cheese, spinach, radishes, onions and snow peas. Thanks for the amazing recipe whit!!

This sticks to the pan terribly. Almost impossible to get out. Had to cut it and let it break to get it out.  Taste was ok, a little on the bland side. Definitely recommend more seasoning before baking

I don't know what I did wrong but I added and added more cauliflower to get it to  'dough' consistency and finally gave up and make 12 small biscuits.
