This is a 5-star plus recipe, as long as you are one to read all the reviews.  And, I mean ALL!  I essentially added almost every, single possible addition mentioned in the reviewer's notes and was SOOOOO super impressed!  To simplify what I added: 1)carrots, potatoes, and frozen peas, 2) few scrapes fresh ginger, 3) 1/2  tablespoon cayenne pepper, 4) four cloves garlic crushed, 5) four tblspns yellow curry, 6) Fresh basil, 7) 1 tspn garam masala, 8) squeeze of lemon, and 9) 2 tsp brown sugar.  Truly, it was sensational; served with rice and snap peas!  Thanks, to the author and all reviewers!

This is the BEST curry I've ever made BUT I only gave it 4 stars because what made it great were the suggested additions from other readers.
The brown sugar and lime juice additions suggested by another reader are excellent BUT I only added 2 tbsp. brown sugar - I think 1/4 cup would be too sweet.
I cubed a potato and added it as I didn't have cauliflower. I also added about 1 tbsp. tandoori paste, which added a nice bit of heat.
Finally, I like a little colour in my curry, so I added one carrot sliced on the diagonal and 1/2 red pepper julienned. 
Both my kids LOVED it - even my fussy 16-yr-old. Took the leftovers to work for lunch today and it was even better the second day! Can't wait to make this again!!
Addendum to my review: For those who complain that this recipe is bland, I do believe that the quality of your curry powder can make all the difference. Curry powders vary greatly - invest in good quality and it will make a big difference!

WOW, this was easily as good as any yellow curry / musmon / Thai curry dish I have had at a restaurant (and I love curry so I order it everywhere, and have tried cooking it often, without much success before). 
I told my hubby I was trying a new curry chicken dish, he grumbled 'why bother, they all taste the same' -but then he tried this one, and after his 3rd helping, apologized all night. 
As others suggested I added 1/4c brown sugar, 1T lime, and 1tsp cayenne. I also cubed a potato. Perfect!
And if you think its good the first night, just wait until you have the left overs the next day, when all of the flavor has really soaked inside. Its even more intense and flavorful. My hubby wanted me to cook it again the very next day, not to eat right then, but to put in the fridge and have for the next few lunches. 
Thanks for this amazing recipe-I can finally make curry taste good in my kitchen!

This recipe was good, but a little bland.  I tweaked it, and it came out great.  I added 2 cubed potatoes (which helped with the thickness a little),an extra tablespoon of curry, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and a dash of cayenne.  As far as being runny, most curries that you get at the Thai restaurants are not thick at all, that is why the rice is sticky, as it absorbs the sauce.

OH MY!  This is absolutely divine!  I followed the directions but also added 1T of lime juice and 1/3 cup of brown sugar as others suggested.  I love curry but my kids don't so I only added about 1T and then sprinkled more on my serving.  I served it all over Jasmine rice and then "oohed" and "aahed" all the way through dinner and seconds!  Thank you Michelle for a great contribution.  I'll be stocking up on coconut milk as we'll be making this a lot in the future.

Followed the advice of previous reviewers to add 1/4 C brown sugar and 1T fresh lime juice. I love the refreshing taste of the lime. I also added carrots and potatoes instead of the cauliflower. I read a review for another recipe that curry seasoning should be cooked in oil along with the garlic and onion, so I did that as well. The end result was pretty good, but because I made many changes, I'm giving 4 stars.

This was excellent!  Even my kids, who can be picky, devoured this!  I substituted cubed potatoes and carrots for the cauliflower and it turned out great!  Will definitely make this again!
Thanks!

So so so good. This is one of my favorite dishes to make because it's incredibly easy and flavorful. I opt for red bell peppers instead of cauliflower (great color and complementary flavor), and I add 1-2 Tbsp of sugar, a good squeeze of lemon juice, and sometimes basil (for a Thai flair!).  Don't worry if the sauce is thin -- it should be so that it can soak into the rice.

Good recipe but required some doctoring. The flavor was good but needed something...I did add some cayenne and a dash of lime but still felt it was lacking a bit. I would have liked to see the sauce be thicker, mine was pretty thin even serving over rice it still ran all over the plate. Perhaps I will use a cornstarch thickener next time. I will try it again because it was pretty tasty!

This was a good "starter" recipie for me, as I have never made "Thai/Indian" food (I use quotes because I don't consider this true authentic Thai/Indian).  I enjoyed it, regardless though.
Anyways, I used leftover rotasserie chicken, and added soy sauce, green curry paste, peanut butter & cayenne pepper to the sauce, and used green beans & red peppers along with the cauliflower & onion.  Served over rice noodles, topped with peanuts & scallions.  Thanks for sharing!

I grew up eating lots of curries and absolutely love it. Here's a little tip to thicken the sauce, since I read few comments about it. Whenever I cook my curry, I always first marinate my sliced/cubed chicken breasts if you use chicken breast) in salt, pepper, curry powder and few teaspoons of cornstarch, enough to coat the chicken nicely. If the marinade is too dry, add few teaspoons of water. You can let it sit for half and hour or so or you can brown the chicken in a medium heat pan right away. I do not cook my chicken fully but just to brown it. Set the chicken aside. I usually add the chicken to the curry sauce to warm it thru before serving so the chicken remains tender. The sauce thickens when the chicken is heated thru. My mom always coat her sliced meat in cornstarch (for stir-fry, curries etc) to keep the meat tender and give it a wonderful silky texture.

To make it super easy, I threw my frozen chicken breasts in the crock pot with everything else, including potatoes, carrots, bell peppers, some ginger, extra curry and garlic, and left it on low for several hours, then shredded the chicken, mixed it all together, cooked a few more hours. I thickened it with corn starch since I like my curry a bit thicker, and served over jasmine rice (made with coconut oil... delicious!).

With some of the tweaks suggested (I went light on the cayenne pepper because the wife doesn't like it THAT spicy), this was a fabulous dish!  I would probably use fresh broccoli heads, water chestnuts, julienned carrots, red bell pepper strips, and bamboo shoots next time, and probably put them in at the last 10 minutes or so so they remain crunchy.  Taste was great!

This was good, and I will make it again, but I had too much sugar! I would cut that back next time and add way more curry paste.

Loved this - but made the following modifications/additions:  4 cloves garlic, 1 tsp fresh ginger, 2 tbls brown sugar, 3/4 cup roasted cashews, carrots, cubed potato, snap peas, 1/2 tsp cayenne, 5 tbls curry powder, 1 cup chunk pineapple, used coconut oil (instead of vegetable oil) plus one tbls of ghee, added enough low sodium chicken stock to almost cover, simmered for at least a hour.  Served with rice.  This was a great recipe to use and modify - thank you so much for posting!

Just made this tonight.  Let me start by saying DH and I are not big curry fans.  But still trying to broaden our horizons.  I have to admit it was good!  Easy to follow instructions and really pretty darned tasty.  I didn't have cauliflower so I subbed red potatoes.  Thank you for sharing your recipe with us.

This recipe was easy. I did change a couple things as to what I had on hand. I used green curry in the jar and bamboo shoots instead of cauliflower and some carrot for color. The rest I followed to the letter.  My husband ate 2 huge bowls as did my son who said, "You can make that again anytime".  Love the love from this one!  Thanks so much for sharing.

I made this last night in the slow cooker, incorporating many of the suggestions from other reviewers. I started by cooking the onion and garlic in the skillet, threw in about 2 Tbsp of the curry with the onions, then added the chicken and cooked for about 7-10 minutes. Then threw everything into the slow cooker - the onion/chicken mixture, 2 potatoes, chopped carrots and red pepper instead of cauliflower, coconut milk and chicken stock. I added 1/4 cup brown sugar, lime juice and papkrika (instead of cayenne pepper). Then slow-cooked for several hours. About an hour before serving, we taste-tested it and found it was a bit too spicy, so I remembered an old trick my Dad taught me, and threw in a chopped banana. Then continued slow-cooking on med for another hour. It was amazing. Spicy, but not painful. Hubby enjoyed it so much he asked if we could save the leftovers until tomorrow, since he's not home for supper tonight. This is a recipe we'll look forward to using again and again!

I didn't have yellow curry so I used 2 tsps of garam masala- yum, a nice cozy winter dish. Next time I'll experiment with red curry, then green...

This was my first time cooking curry from scratch. I loved it!  My husband who is a picky eater loved it too.  I took advice from the other readers and added the brown sugar and lime juice. This recipe was mild which was great for my young children.  For adults who want a little spice, I'd add some cayenne pepper or a little Hawaiian chili pepper (use very little because it's really spicy).

Great variety dish for moms looking to spice up the family meal. Instead of the cauliflower I used 1 cup each of chopped green pepper, potatoes, and carrots; making it similar to the Thai restaurant version I love and - as we all know - the more vegetable colors the merrier!  I also used garlic powder instead of the salt.  The chicken stock alone contributes enough sodium for flavor; even the low-sodium kind is not a big sacrifice. The spiced, slow-cooked meat is delicious enough to stand alone.  If you're not dishing this up to a bunch of finicky palates, then just kick it up a notch with a spicier curry blend (stick to the plain old powder, though, as the pastes and blends you see in the supermarket are often loaded with MSG) and a handful of fresh hot peppers.  100% pure (i.e., organic) coconut milk takes away even more potentially harmful preservatives.  Served over brown rice (cooked with the rest of that can of broth you opened for a mere 1/3 cup!), this dish is exquisitely healthy...and heavenly!

Great base---I made it a 5-star by adding lime juice and a little sugar, and some chillies (I live in Thailand, so I've acquired more of a taste for the lime and spice of a good Thai curry).  With the simple additions, this made better curry than I've had in most places in Bangkok!

This was ok. My husband I both thought that the cauliflower was not a good fit for it. We ate leftovers the next day but picked out the cauliflower and thought it was much better.

This was a good, quick, and easy base, but needed more spices. After looking at other recipes from this site (see "Indian Chicken Curry II"), I added ginger, clove, paprika, crushed red peppers, bay leaf, a bell pepper, and potatoes.  Didn't have any cauliflower. I would rate this a 4-1/2 with the added spices.

Read the reviews. I used their suggestions and it turned this recipe into a winner. I also added a cup of fresh cilantro...love that stuff. I made it in the morning without adding the chicken, let it sit all day, grilled the chicken,chopped and added it to the curry a little while before serving. Fabulous.

I gave this 3 stars to be fair but as I made it (vegetarian) I didn't care for it. Maybe it needed the chicken to bring another element into the dish so I can't say it was bad.

I make this all of the time and both my husband and I love it!  I like it with potatoes, carrots and zucchini.  I also always add fresh purple basil and some chili coban (a local chili in powdered form).

So delicious I used a variety of things but most importantly I sautéed the curry in hot oil with the garlic and onion. It makes the difference. I also added whole baby carrots, crushed ginger pieces in a garlic press, brown sugar, fresh lime juice, small cut up potatos... If your having a problem with thickness I suggest using the potatoes but if that's not good enough the heavy whipping cream will fix that without adding flavor

So, I DO NOT cook! I was really looking to make a simple Thai meal when i came across this receipe and thought it looked delicious so I decided to try and make it.  It is fabulous! I did follow the other reviews and add a little brown sugar (not too much, maybe a couple of Tbs) and cayenne pepper and just a bit of lime juice as well I added a little extra chicken stock too, just a little because I added so many more veggies like potatoes and carrots.  It was incredibly EASY to make and I love a 1 pot meal!! (Here is my tip: since I added cauliflower, potatoes and carrots, I suggest you add the potatoes and carrots fisrt for about 10 mins and then add the cauliflower, otherwise the cauliflower gets TOO soft) I served it over jasmine rice with some naan to dip in the yummy sauce. FYI...Trader Joes has the best naan if anyone wants to know! Thank you everyone for the reviews and for helping a "non cook" make an outstanding meal!

This was excellent. I'm lazy, so I didn't get a head of cauliflower. The grocery store was out of bagged cauliflower. I got a bag of cauliflower, carrots and broccoli. The only deviation I made was adding cayenne pepper to give it a little more kick. I served it with a bag of frozen Biryani curried rice. Excellent together. This is something that I, as a single person, can enjoy eating left over. Lunch tomorrow and Tuesday are going to make me happy. Thanks for posting.

Good recipe - didn't have cauliflower, so I used carrots, potatoes & yellow onions instead.  Added more curry powder, and Thai chili paste for more flavor.

This wasn't my favorite.  Kind of a dull flavor.  I used a fresh coconut ... not sure if that was better or worse to use.  I probably would have liked it a lot better if I had used different vegetables.  The cauliflower was much too bland for this particular recipe.  Plus I ended up with way more cauliflower than needed.  Some heartier, more flavorful vegetables probably would have made a world of difference.

I made all the changes that EMT said to make and it still didn't turn out very good. It was missing something for sure. I will not make this again. I am still on the hunt for a good curry recipe.

I searched for a recipe with coconut milk and chicken and was glad to see cauliflower was in this recipe since I had bought a head the other day. I followed the recipe exactly and would recommend more salt and pepper. Since there was chopped garlic in it and the stock is salty, I went easy on table salt but next time I will add more. Hubby loved it!

I thought this was a good recipe. After reading reviews I did make the following changes, and let me tell you..... this is going to be a repeat recipe!!  I substituted 1 potato for the cauliflower. I added about 1 cup of frozen peas. I added 2 T. brown sugar and 1 T. lime juice. I added a few tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken the curry up. This was AMAZING!!!!

I also put in a handful of carrots, half a red pepper thinly sliced.3 tbsp of Hot Madras Curry powder. A finger of peeled and crushed ginger root.  Coconut cream instead of milk.(no extra sugar required) The juice of a whole lime, a teaspoon of Cayenne, 2 bay leaves.  I used a whole can of chicken stock and thickened with Corn Starch. Wow!! 2 of us ate the lot delicious.

Easy recipe but pretty bland. Needs a lot extra to give it flavor. We sat at the table squeezing lime juice and dashing cayenne pepper on it to get it to taste kinda right...

Delicious! Most recipes I have to tweek a little here and there or read all the reviews to know how to 'fix' it. This one is perfect as is. The hot curry is mellowed just enough with the coconut milk to create a wonderful spicey creamy sauce for the chicken and vegetables. We had it over steamed basmati rice with a small baby spinach salad with goat cheese. A wonderful easy dinner.

With a few modifications, I'd rate this recipe one of the best on the site (I gave it a 4 because it needs a few ingredients).  As suggested by other reviewers, I added 1/4 c brown sugar, 1T lime juice, and 1 tsp cayenne, all of which I think are essential to the flavor of this dish.  I substituted Thai stock for the chicken (you can get it at Wegman's) and realized at the last minute that I was almost out of yellow curry, so I ended up using 1 T curry and about 2 T curry paste (next time I'd use all curry paste).  I used about 1/4 head of cauliflower and added carrot and red bell pepper.  The carrots take a while to become tender so if you're short on time you might want to steam them as you're cooking the onion/chicken mixture.  I served over jasmine rice and sprinkled peanuts on top. It was the best Thai food I've ever cooked, and I make it a lot.  Enjoy!

This was a wonderful dish..my husband loved it.  I did add extra garlic and curry, and a dash of cayenne, but otherwise followed directions and ended up with a wonderful dinner.  I served it over basmati rice which I think really added to the flavor.  The only trouble was that I found it a bit too runny...could have been my coconut milk though, I don't know.  We'll definitely have this one again.

This is a very food recipe though it needed a lot of extra flavoring as just using curry powder is not enough. I turned this into a Thai  India Curry dish using both Yellow curry powder and green Thai curry sauce from Trader Joe's. I added about 7 leaves of fresh basil, a lot more garlic!,  a teaspoon salt which still wasn't enough. I used carrots, potato, broccoli, bell pepper and spinach for the veggies and faux chicken from Quorn (the best fake chix). Came out very good and my hubby who rarely eats a whole plate ate the whole thing in 5 min! Will make again!

Great and super easy recipe!  Followed the advice of some of the reviews, and added carrots, cubed potatoes, and peppers (towards the end so they wouldn't get overcooked).  Also increased the curry to 4 tablespoons and added 2T brown sugar.  Will definitely make again!

The first time I made this it became a household favorite. I made the original recipe with no modifications, and the family loved it. It is so basic you could do almost anything. Added 1/2 cup cashews and 1/2 cup raisins once. Another time I added 1 Tbs ginger and left out the cauliflower. It all depends on what I have in the house.

This was a great "curry in a hurry" dish. I jazzed it up (we like it spicy!) and followed some other suggestions. I took the lid off and let it simmer down so the sauce could thicken at the end. Here's what I added:  sliced carrots, frozen peas, extra garlic (4 cloves total), about 1 t. red pepper flakes, 1 t. garam masala, and increased the curry powder to 4 T. We all loved it and plan to put this dish on rotation, for sure! (served with Naan bread and cucumber raita - greek yogurt, shredded cucumber, diced jalapeno, cumin, salt, cayanne).  Thanks for this easy dish!

Loved it as well with some changes - here were mine:
Added carrots, frozen peas, and a can of garbanzo beans. Upped the curry to 4 tbsp, the crushed garlic to 4-5 cloves, and the chicken broth to 1/2 cup. Spice wise I added 1/2 Tbsp garam masala and about 1 tsp ground ginger. I also added the juice of 1 lime and about 1 Tbsp agave. Oh so good!

5 stars for this delicious, easy dinner dish! I added an extra teaspoon of powdered curry (purchased fresh from Kuwait!) and added small, cubed potatoes and lentils to the recipe. It made for an amazing, filling meal and the taste just flowed so perfectly with all of the above ingredients. The coconut milk was what really made the flavor so smooth and perhaps next time, I will add just a bit more of it. As for the thickness of this recipe, I did have to cook it a bit longer to achieve the thickness that I desired. Upon cooling, it did seem to thicken up a bit more as well.

Topped it off with some jasmine rice and it is a recipe that I will certainly make again!

This was a great 'base' recipe that I added on.  Additionally, I added in 1 regular sized sweet potato cubed & baked in oven for 30 minutes prior, used only 3/4 C coconut milk, 1 container single serving plain yogurt, 10 oz Shrimp instead of chicken, 1 mango, cubed, cauliflower, 3T tomato paste, small piece ginger root grated, 
1 red pepper chopped, 1/8 tsp cayenne pepper.  I omitted the onion, chicken stock & garlic salt.  A delicious sweet curry!

This was fantastic! My first shot at a dish like this and was so pleased. My fav Thai restaurant closed that made a similar dish and this hit the spot.(maybe better since I can control the heat!...I don't like too hot) I also used the adds that were mentioned i.e. cayenne pepper, ginger powder, brown sugar, 1 c carrots, 4-5 potatoes cubed (omitted cali..had none), chopped fresh cilantro, and 1/2 lime juice and lime zest. I also browned the chix with the spices removed before slightly undercooked, cut into cubes and returned after all the liquid ingredients had come to a boil.  Took to a Naw Ruz celebration and people were going back for 3rds! Thank you VANCITYGIRL!

I made most of the suggested changes (brown sugar, potatoes) and switched broccoli for cauliflower. next time I will add the broccoli toward the end of the cooking so they don't deteriorate.

I make this recipe a lot!!!  I often don't have cauliflower on hand so I chop up 2 potatoes into tiny pieces and it adds the thickness to the sauce.  I also double the amount of curry.  Other than that I follow the recipe and it's great!  Thanks!

I have used other reviews to tweak this recipe, and it turns out great no matter how I change it up. One time I didn't have cauliflower so I used pineapple chunks--yum! My husband and I went to a local Indian restaurant, and I was pleasantly surprised that the dish I ordered tasted just like this one that I make at home.

My first time ever cooking with coconut milk. We all liked this one. I opted to serve it over noodles because we've been having a lot of rice dishes lately. The sauce was very thin. I tried to thicken it using a couple teaspoons of cornstarch (mixed in cold water). Didn't really work too well. The addition of my two sides, broccoli and sliced tomatoes, really made this dish a winner. The flavor was good, but I would have liked it to be more flavorful. I'll keep  this one and work with it. Thanks for the recipe.

Good Curry Recipe. Wasn't sure if you were asking for Thai Yellow Curry powder or regular Curry so I used regular.  Added some fresh peas from the garden and some cashews and raisins. Put it on top of Brown Basmati and wild rice. We love curry and this dish passed the test !  Thanks

This was pretty good~~but there was just something missing.  We have chicken curry at a local Thai restaurant, and  the sauce is heavenly~~this sauce lacked the heavenly factor, but was still very good.  I chopped up a red bell pepper and used mushrooms and some peas and carrots, as I had no cauliflower.  Since I was searching for that sweetness of our restaurant dish, I added some pineapple chunks after everyone had tasted it, and that actually improved the recipe considerably.  I served this with jasmine rice.  Everyone liked it very much, but agreed that there was just something missing....I will make this again, though.

This was good and I will make it again. However, it did seem to be lacking something, even after I added all of the suggestions from previous reviewers (cayenne, lime, potato, brown sugar, basil, etc..) Easy to make, but took longer than 15 minutes to prep.

Sorry for such a long comment, but I like this recipe because of the combination of ingredients and the preparation -- but, of course I made a few changes which for me made it more what I wanted.  I used ground turkey this time instead of chicken - but another time I might use chicken.  First off I browned the ground turkey to get some meat juices for the sauteeing and then removed the meat, leaving the meat juices. Then instead of oil, I used what I had, which was Smart Balance, and I added chopped fresh ginger and jalapenos to the onion and garlic sautee.  I also added the curry powder to this mixture and let it heat up and cook soft.  While this was cooking, I chopped up a bunch of fresh broccoli (instead of cauliflower) - stems and florets - and some fresh asparaghus.  I added this to the heated spice and onion mixture for a short while to just coat the fresh chopped vegetables and then I took this whole mixture and put it on the bottom of a small (1 1/2 to 2 quart) crock pot.  On top of that I added the browned ground turkey.  Instead of one 14 ounce can of coconut milk, I used about 1/2 the can and added in a 10.75 ounce can of Campbell's condensed Broccoli Cheese soup, which is one of the rare prepared soups I like.  I wanted a liquid-y result, so I added some heated up chicken broth.  Then I grated some fresh black pepper on it all.  I turned the crock pot on high for a while before I went to sleep -- before I went to sleep, the last thing I did was put the crock pot

Definitely one of our favorite recipes. Like others we subbed potatoes for cauliflower and added lime juice, brown sugar and cayenne. This dish is especially good if you can find some fresh thai hot peppers

Did as suggested and added extra seasonings.  Made a double recipe - but one of the spices probably the ground pepper should not be doubled!  Very good will make again!!!

Just wasn't what I was hoping for.  I'm guessing it's because while I'm preparing and cooking this, I'm getting such strong aromas from all the spices that by the time I'm ready to eat it, the flavour isn't as strong.  Maybe this is why the leftovers tend to taste so much better ??

This was pretty good.  Needed something though... not sure what.  It kind of lacked flavor.  I was hoping for a really flavorful dish.  With some tweaks it may be good.  I'll try some other recipes before I try to rewrite this one though.  It is definitely worth trying, as some people will probably love it as is!

This was my 1st ever attempt at a curry and it turned out really well.  I left out the onion and the cauliflower but added potatoe because I wanted it to be more like the ones I eat at Thai restaurants (just chicken and potatoes).  It was great.  I followed the advice of others and added sugar and the masala. I made the dish for 3 and we ate it all - so I would for sure increase the quantities if making for 4 (and of course I would make even more if we wanted any leftovers!).  Pretty easy recipe  - I will be making this one again!

This was a really good recipe.  I was trying to find something close to a curry I like a my favourite Thai restaurant, and this came pretty close.

I used potatoes instead of cauliflower and added a bit of lemon juice.  I added brown sugar, which helped, but I think I would add less next time (maybe just 1 tbsp).

I guess I should've followed everyone's advice and added the brown sugar and other tweaks. I made it just as written,  and it tasted like I had just doused everything in curry powder. The flavors of everything else in the dish got drowned out completely.

I loved this recipe! I have made a few adjustments, because I didn't exactly all the ingredients and I tried to follow advices of the others (I added 2potatoes, 1/3 cup of sugar and lemon juice - didn't have lime) and the result was fantastic. Thank you for a great recipe!

This was very good.  I did use a potato instead of cauliflower and it did not really soften up so I may do the cauliflower next time.  I also threw in grape tomatoes.  It was better the next day!

I love chicken curry but never tried making it myself. This was delicious. I followed advice previously left and added 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1T of lime. You can cut the calories and fat significantly by using light coconut milk.

Very good recipe, Michelle! This was quick and easy, and everyone in the family liked it. I did follow other reviewer's advice and added 1 tablespoon lime juice, 1 teaspoon cayenne and 1/4 cup brown sugar. Next time I will leave out the brown sugar (or only add a tablespoon or two) as I think we would prefer it without the sweet taste.

This was great! I tweaked it a bit to what I had in the kitchen. I used about 4 tablespoons of Extra Hot yellow curry powder and 4 cloves of garlic crushed and chopped. I used a yellow onion and left out the chicken stock. I did not have cauliflower but I used carrots and potatoes as a substitute. I added some fresh ginger (just a few scrapes), a few dashes of pumpkin spice as suggested, about 1 ½ tablespoons white sugar, about ½ tablespoon cayenne pepper and a squeeze of lemon juice. WOW! It was SPICY! We loved it!

We added chopped carrots and frozen peas. I think this did alot for the appearance. I ate the leftovers for several meals the next several day's I made it and never got tired of them! Next time I make this, I'm going to add potatoes too!

I thought this recipe had potential as a base, but definitely needs some work. I added some brown sugar and extra curry, as suggested, but still found it bland. Perhaps I'll get some cayenne pepper to add to the leftovers.

Really tasty.  Like others, I added my own touches like lime, 1/3 c brown sugar, cayene pepper, tri colored peppers, mushrooms, garam marsala, and a bit or coriander.  It was delish with the alterations.  My husband was practically licking the bowl.  I made couscous on the side and used the rest of the can of chicken broth for it.  Yum.

I really enjoyed this.  I added about 1/4 c of brown sugar and threw in a can of lentils too.  Sauce was a little liquidy in my opinion...i probably added a little too much stock.  My husband HATED this though--but that's because he despises curry! So only try this if you actually like curry (which i really really do!).  Yum!

I really loved this! So did my husband, daughter, sister and her husband and their kids!! It makes the house smell wonderful!! I did take some other peoples advice and added a bit of brown sugar! I also added a shake of pumpkin pie spice (weird, but really brought the flavors together beautifully!!) I will be making this again and again!! Wonderful with Jasmine rice!

Added carrots & red peppers with the cauliflower for colour, 1/3 cup brown sugar & 1 tbsp lime as suggested and doubled the curry power since we're curry fanatics.  It was amazingly creamy and as good as what we've ordered in restaurants before, but very mild even with double our brand of curry powder.  If you want kick, I'd definitely take the suggestions of adding cayenne or something.

We could only find sweetened coconut milk so there was no need to add sugar.  I made it without cauliflower since I didn't have any.  I thought it was just the right amount of kick to it but my husband wanted it to be more spicy.  Very easy and tasty.

Great Recipe!  Loved it!  Only reason I did not give five stars was because I wished it was a little spicier.  I'm going to going with suggestion below and add a little cayenne as well next time.

This was a great, simple recipe.  I omitted the cauliflower and added a bit more curry, but it turned out really well.  I served it over basmati rice cooked w/ saffron.  I was amazed how quickly the whole meal came together -- I'll definitely make this again!

I really liked this recipe.  I did add some zucchini (because I have to get rid of it in everything I cook these days) and I threw some garbanzo beans in, because I thought they'd be tasty in there.  I read the reviews and after tasting the curry thought I'd try a little brown sugar in it.  I put about a tablespoon in, and that was a mistake, it was too sweet.  I think 1/3 or 1/4 cup would make it sticky sweet.  I added it because Thai food, in general does have a lot of sugar in it. Next time I make this - no sugar.  I think it will be nice an savory.  Thanks for this recipe, it was easy and tasty!

So awesome! What a great recipe. And yes it inspired me, after reading other reviews, to not do the cauliflower. I went to the recipe 'Thai Chicken Curry in Coconut Milk for basic spices and some idea of how much carrots and potatoes. I added other spices in the reviews of this great recipe and what a dish! I mean WOW! Tossed in the crockpot for a couple of hours... I'm starting to drool. I need to stop. You get the idea. Just read. You'll do good! Gotta go!!!

As I made it, it was a 5+ star recipe!  This is a great BASE RECIPE. As is, it will be 4 star and a bit bland.  Add whatever ingredients that sound good to you, taste, and add a little more of whatever it's missing until you really like it.
I added a teaspoon of fresh finely grated ginger & lemongrass (on hand from the garden), half a lime (very important for flavor), extra salt, a cube of chicken bouillon, pepper, turmeric (gives great color), 2 chopped carrots, two chopped cooked potatoes, extra peas & garlic.

I made this last night and, even with the suggested modifications (additions), I'm still not sure it's all that good.
I used between 2.5-3 tbsp curry powder, 1 tsp basil leaves, 1 tsp garam masala, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/4+ tsp cayenne pepper, 3/4-1 tsp tumeric, 2 tbsp Brown sugar (that it definitely needs to balance the spices), 1/3 cup chicken broth, 1.5 cans light coconut milk (it's what I had), and juice of half a lime. I did as another reviewer suggested and browned the chicken (seasoned w/ salt & pepper), set it aside, and added it back in after sauteing the onion and garlic (once it was ready to simmer with all the ingredients). I toasted the spices after the onion mixture was soft, then added the broth and coconut milk. I added the lime juice after about 10 minutes and I really think the lime juice helps cut some of the bitterness of the spices. I don't understand why others don't also think this is bitter, though. I didn't use any potato b/c I think the rice is enough carbs, and I added fresh, snipped green beans that I halved (1.5 cups) and 1 medium red bell pepper cut into strips (and I didn't use cauliflower either).
I wanted to love it, but I didn't. I was also disappointed that it didn't have that beautiful yellow color that some curries have, but it just got Brown after it cooked. I hope this helps someone else, and I think I will keep looking for my favorite coconut curry chicken recipe... because this isn't it.

Delicious is an understatement! I did everything the recipe called for plus the additions previous reviewers suggested and it was fantastic! My picky teenager devoured it and so did my 15 month old son. Crowd pleaser! Oh and I didn't even measure everything perfectly and it was still magnificent...fool proof recipe!

very good! curry is my favorite so I love this recipe! I do not like cauliflower so instead I added steamed carrots and a can of pineapples. I also added cayenne red pepper to make it spicer and a chicken boullion cube, another half tablespoon of curry, and a little ground ginger. I also followed the other reviews and added lime juice and brown sugar. Was so delicious :)

Loved it but with adding ingredients as other reviewers suggested.  I added sliced carrots, cubed potatoes, 1 tsp ginger, 2 tsp cayenne pepper, 1 tsp lemon juice, and 2 Tbsp brown sugar.  Yumm, yumm.  My hubby is not into coconut milk, but he said this was very good and to make it more often. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

SO GOOD.  I've made this several times.  I've tried making some additions such as potatoes and carrots, and those were good, but honestly I prefer the recipe as written.  The cauliflower and onions and chicken are quite enough substance to carry these wonderful flavors, and I think adding other things muddies it just a bit.  The one change I have made that I would make again is using chicken thighs rather than breasts.  Just personal preference that I like how moist the thighs are.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

Good base recipe, but YES, like most everyone else, I added heat AND more veges.  Used a bag of frozen cauliflower, not fresh, and it was totally fine.  Also used 3 (med) carrots, and added a bag of frozen peas and about a cup of frozen edamame.  Used Thai red curry spice and added red pepper flakes and cayenne. Also took others' advice and added about 2 TS of corn starch to the chicken while it was cooking, so that the sauce was a bit thicker than it would have been. We really enjoyed eating this for several meals!  This recipe can be easily tweaked to suit your taste preferences.

Really good!! Perfect heat!!  Used half & half instead of heavy cream and will try coconut milk next time instead.  Used Greek yogurt which made it thicker.  Doubled the sauce too.

For my first time trying to make curry this is a great start. It did need some additional spices so I had to add about a teaspoon of chicken bouillon as this was my first time making curry I was scared to overwhelm the recipe. I did substitute the cauliflower with potato and carrots as well. Next time I will most definitely try some of the suggestions from the comments as they all sound so delicious.

I added the extras people suggested, but it still tasted bland.  I did have really cheap curry and perhaps if I added more quality curry, it would have tasted better.  Also, I added a lot of salt and that helped.  It tasted better the second day after the flavors marinated overnight.

This was really easy to prepare and I was slightly worried about the spice of curry but the yellow curry has the flavors without the heat. Loved it!

This is sooooo delicious!!! The curry and coconut flavor goes so well together. I initially thought it didn't have enough hearty ingredients so I added potatoes and carrots. It made it taste so good! I will for sure make this again soon!

This is now a regularly used recipe in our house. I frequently substitute potatoes for cauliflower and sometimes serve it over rice noodles and top with fresh basil. My husband loves it with sriracha!

I put in a search for 'curry chicken kids will eat' and this one came up.  It was the truth - the whole family enjoyed. I put in potato and broccoli, found it a little salty but added some brown sugar which seemed to compliment the coconut milk.

I gave this an overall 3 because my husband loved it.  I thought it was "ok" a little on the bland side I too made it exactly as needed.  It needs a little doctoring up as the other reviews suggested.  It's two biggest advantages are that it's super quick and easy and it also tastes even better the next day.

Pleasant meal for women!  This kind of taste is mostly liked by us, women. But it's only about women usually like Piña Colada, and men don't.  My husband also consumed it but did not ask me to make it again...(although he often does do that). So I think you shouldn't try to enchant a man with this meal but your mom the more! It is light and sweet. I liked it, but next time I will use more coconut milk, as I found the amount a little slim.

We loved this dish and made it exactly as the recipe stated.  My 7 year old son even said "Delicious, 5 stars, Can we have it again?"  Can't beat that!  UPDATE:  I keep making this because it is my daughter's favorite recipe.  Tried the light coconut milk and think it was better made with regular.  Would like to add small diced potatoes next time.

I didn't have yellow curry powder so I had to substitute red curry paste. I did switch out the cauliflower for the potatoes and carrots, though. I had stir-fry beef instead of chicken on hand so I used that as well. Overall, I felt it was a pretty bland dish. Maybe with all of the suggestions that have been posted it would be better. Good base, though.

I liked the recipe and will make it again.  I followed the advice of others and added some brown sugar, cayenne and some lemon juice and it was great.  I had a can of coconut cream instead of milk and it made the dish very rich and thick just like in the Thai restaurants.  It probably added too many calories but it was very tasty.  I will make this again with coconut milk next time to compare.

I have never made curry before, but have eaten lots in the US and UK. This recipe was easy to follow, and I thought it was exactly what the author said: tasty with a mild curry flavor. It was GOOD! My English boyfriend even likes it. Thanks for sharing and thanks to the people who added helpful tips, I did add a bit of lime and cayenne for some flavor.

This was a very good recipe. I was out of cauliflower so I substituted sweet potatoes. Also, I cut the curry amount in half (fearing that it seemed like too much) but I think it would have been fine to use the whole amount. Served it over brown rice. Yum!

Unfortunately this is not what I would consider a "real" curry.  Too bland not the right combination of spices to make a proper curry.  I will stick to my instincts and East Indian cook book.

The recipe needs alot of tweeks, I did not use cauliflower, but used carrots & potatoes instead. I followed the instructions on the curry powder, onions, garlic, chicken stock & used lite coconut milk instead. I did add for more flavor, 2 bay leaves, brown sugar, lime juice, garlic powerder.  I had to add to taste. next time, I would probably, fry the potates first so that it doesnt suck up all the sauce though.  Overall, after the modifications it was a very enjoyable meal

I tweaked the recipe a bit: potatoes instead of cauliflower, cayenne, ginger, a bit more yellow curry, a bit more garlic, and some CARDAMOM... sugar, lime juice...  My most sincere advice is to err on the side of caution with the spices.  You can always add more later, but you can't do much to fix it if something is too overpowering.
The recipe is a great base, but the additions of other reviewers really make it stand out.

We love Coconut Chicken Curry! But this was lacking in flavor..I did add red pepper flakes, 1 jalapeno, 1 T. brown sugar, and 2 small potatoes. But something was missing. I will try a different curry next time.

We made this tonight and it was a hit!  The  cauliflower was divine after being cooked in the sauce for 30 min.  We added brown sugar to the sauce recipe, but nothing else.  It was delightful and wasn't too thick or too thin.

When cooking the chicken, we added red peppers for color.  We had leftover brown rice blend in the frig, so we used that, mixing it with the chicken and pouring the sauce-cauliflower mixture over the top.  We garnished with a little flaked coconut.

A spinach & goat cheese salad was a delicious side, as suggested by another reviewer.

Great recipee!!!!!!!

WOW! I've been trying Thai recipes for a little while and this is the best. Now, I also added the lime and brown sugar. I dislike cauliflower in my curry, so I used carrots, instead. We made our own sticky rice and we loved it! (It did need to cook it a little longer, but I think that's because I added the carrots.)

I use cubed golden potatoes instead of the cauliflower, and I add way more curry, garlic salt, and pepper than the recipe calls for.  With my own personal tweaks, it tastes AMAZING!! I make it almost every week!

This was a great meal! I took the suggestions and added the brown sugar, lime juice, and cayenne pepper. I also cut down on the amt of culiflower, and cubed two Yukon Gold potatoes and it really added something. The potatoes get even better the next day if you have leftovers. I have a 3, 5, and 8 year old so I cut the curry from 2.5 to 2 t. Still tasted great. Also served with lime juice that two sprinkled on their dish. Really great!

Excellent dish. I took the reviewers' suggestions and added a little brown sugar, lime juice, shredded carrots, cayenne pepper and sliced red peppers! Served over Jasmine rice and both my husband and son went back for seconds and then divided up what was left over between them for their lunches today. I had to promise to make this again soon. Thanks for a great recipe!

I sliced up carrots instead of the cauliflower, and added broccoli.  I also added 2 jalapeno peppers, as we like a little heat.  It was a little watery, so I added a little corn starch.  Delicious served over jasmine rice.

Good base. I added cayenne, sugar, lemon juice, potatoes (no cauliflower, ick) and next time I would use 1/3 less curry (it was too overpowering, lost the coconut taste).

We weren't crazy about this dish.  I was prepared for an extremely flavorful sauce like the kind I get at my favorite Thai restaurant, but this one lacked the intense flavor I was looking for.  Oh well.

Great recipe as a base. Like many other people, I added some fresh lime juice, brown sugar, cayenne, chopped potatoes, and  much more curry powder. I think any more than 1/3 cup of brown sugar is too sweet. You can pretty much play around with the spices to taste, but in summary, I would definitely make this a staple weekly recipe in my house.

I used this recipe as a base to start my chicken curry.  I used all the same ingredients as Michelle, but I added a few more things.. like a red pepper, celery, carrot, ginger root, lime juice, garam masala, celery seed and I also doubled the recipe since I had about 2 pounds of chicken.  I tend to always use more curry than suggested b/c my hubby and I like things HOT :)  I served it with jasmine rice.. our aparment smelled like a nice Indian restaurant... hope the neighbor's didn't mind ;)

This was heavenly!  My boyfriend had 2nds which is always a good indicator.  It was exactly what I was wanting & the flavor was delish.  As the some of the other members suggested I added the lime juice, brown sugar, & a cut up potato.  This will go in my recipe book as a keeper.

Oh Michelle, I've been waiting for a recipe like this for chicken/shrimp coconut & curry. My husband liked it, I loved it. I did make the changes that past reviewers made but instead of the cayenne pepper, I subsituted 4 dried Thai chilis,(yes, 4). Do not, I repeat DO Not do this if you do not like spicy!!! Too many chilis to say the least. The flavor with the veggies and Curry and Coconut is absolutely yummy.  

Thanks from one M to another.

Very good.  I added some turmeric and it gave it a little bit different taste.  I also added some lime juice and sugar as others suggested.  It was good but has a slightly different after taste.  I am sure it has something to do with the added ingredients.

I just made this for dinner and it was delicious! I left out the stock, as I have a pan that tends to keep the moisture in. I served it over amaranth - I will definitely be making this recipe again - thanks, Michelle!

So satisfying. I added coconut flakes because I like a lot of coconut flavor. The beauty of the recipe is that people who say, "I hate coconut" probably won't be able to taste it prepared as written. It's also great for "I hate spicy food" people because it was pretty mild as far as heat. I also didn't have any chicken broth so I used a cube of veg boullion, and substituted split chicken breasts as that was what was on sale.

It had a very good, rich mouth feel.  Some people might want more of a bite, but it was tasty without it.

Good show!

We loved it.  I think it had a great balance of flavor.  We did add some brown sugar like some others.  We served with frozen sliced green beans instead of the cauliflower and on top of Jasmine rice.  We will make oftern.

I only used 1 tbsp curry and added 1 tbsp cayenne pepper.  Also added a red pepper and a tbsp of brown sugar.  
It was spicy, but there was something missing.  I think I should have added in more brown sugar.

I liked this recipe, but I thnk that there are some things I will modify next time I prepare it. I thin that the sauce was a little runny. Next time I might use chicken broth and more chicken to even the meal out.

I would like to have given it a 3 1/2. It was ok but seemed to be missing a little something. Maybe my "not so thick" coconut milk was part of the problem (not the usual brand I buy).  Oh well, it all got eaten and I guess that's what matters.

I used frozen cauliflower, since it was all I had, and also Hot Madras Curry Powder.  It was wonderful, with just a bit of zip.  Best of all...noone complained about eating cauliflower.  I served it over plain white rice, but it would be wonderful with something like basmati, if you have it in the cupboard.

Very nice.  Very simple to make.  I would recommend using more cauliflower as it soaks up the flavour so nicely!

This recipe is an excellent mild curry. It was very creamy and easy to make and it works great whether you serve it as an addition to one of your favorite rice dishes or a main course all on its own.
