Nice twist on chicken salad, however if I were going to go so far as to call it "gourmet" I wouldn't used canned chicken... I opted to use some leftover citrus grilled chicken I had on hand. I also used some red grapes for a little color. I didn't have cucumber salad dressing so I used Hellman's light mayo cut with a bit of sour cream and added a bit of salt, pepper and just a bit of curry powder. Overall, very good on toasted whole grain bread.

Although I did make changes to this recipie, I'm still giving it 5 stars.  I used left over boneless baked chicken breast instead of the canned chicken.  I searched and couldn't find cucumber dressing in any of our markets so I substituted light mayo.  Also I think the green grapes would be tasty but I used seedless red ones as I had them in the house.  The red grapes, orange mandarin oranges, green celery, and brown nuts gave it a nice presentation.

I really enjoyed this simple salad on pita bread.  I used a cucumber ranch light-done-right dressing and it was wonderful.

I didn't care for this chicken salad. I took one bite with the oranges and immediately removed them. They were just too over-powering for this salad. After that, it still was not that good. The flavor just wasn't there.

This is a good recipe.  Try grilled chicken for a little different taste, also. Thanks for sharing!

This is excellent.  I used red grapes in addition to the green.  I couldn't locate the creamy cucumber dressing at my local (and often inadequate) grocery, but used cucmber ranch, instead.  I forgot to add the mandarin oranges, and it was still great.  I served it at a luncheon on lettuce leaves, and ate the extra in grainy bread sandwiches.  Yum!  I will make this again!

This is a great recipe to prepare ahead of time.  It is also great to take for lunch or just eat as a snack.

I LOVE this recipe, and my best friend asks me to make it everytime they have a BBQ.  So easy to whip together, and is awesome on crackers, bread, ANYTHING!

This is great, I've made it several times and I e-mailed it to my mom and she loves it too !
I'm looking for a way to make low calorie creamy cucumber salad dressing so I can make it low calorie as well. It's definitely the best chicken salad I've ever tasted.

Agree with Julie - this is not a very tasty version of a salad (store-bought dressing and all ingredients).

This is good, but I would recommend using roasted and salted pecans and adding some pepper. I also couldn't find the creamy cucumber dressing, so I used cucumber ranch instead. I served on potato chive crusty bread. Yum!

I didn't measure the ingredients. I think with salad it isn't necessary unless you are making the dressing. I used chicken leftovers instead of canned chicken - this salad was for a light dinner. We don't have cucumber dressing, so I added cucumber slices instead and ranch dressing. My husband doesn't like ranch so I gave him raspberry vinagrette which he also didn't like..... so at the end he liked using balsamic vinegar/olive oil type of dressing.  Recipe was easy and I'd make it again.

I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and shredded it.  I also used Ranch dressing instead of Cucumber because I had it on hand... I think next time I'll used Cucumber and it'll probably receive 5 stars from me.  I love the pecans and grapes.  YUM!

Great taste, but I haven't used the oranges. Have used raisins when out of grapes. Use my own boiled chicken. A sprinkling of dried Tarragon and onion powder while boiling, really adds to the flavor of the dish, too.

There really wasn't anything gourmet about this recipe.  The cucumber salad dressing gave the whole salad a 'packaged' taste... I used red grapes instead of green ones as that is what I had.  Definitely needed more pizzaz...black pepper, onion, garlic, something--and I even used grilled chicken, not canned.  For picky eaters I don't know how it would go over.  My kids liked it...but it wasn't their favorite.

I didn’t like this at all. Gourmet NOT, come on can chicken. No taste at all added everything in pantry including mayo and onion just to make it eatable. Won’t like it in future. Big waste of money.
