I wanted to add a couple of things.  This recipe was related to me over 20 years ago by a friend I met when we were both VERY pregnant with our first children in a childbirth class (Hi Nancy!).  One day, while on a walk with our new babies, we started talking about holiday meals and decided to share our favorite recipes. I don't remember what I offered up, but I'm sure I got the better end of that deal.  Those babies are all grown up now, but my family still looks forward to this casserole every holiday (and sometimes just because I couldn't resist some nice-looking green beans at the market).  Doubtless, this recipe had been around for a long time before I knew about it, yet I wanted to share it as it had been shared with me. 

Next, blanching the beans will result in a crisper bean.

This is a wonderful recipe! I have been making for the holidays every year for about 30 years, my Aunt gave me this recipe, she got it from a friend in the late 40's, so it's been around a while!!! I always add a little more sugar to it and extra cheese. It always turns out great!

I'll definitely make this again and again.  I used crispy onions instead of corn flakes.  They wasn't any left for leftovers.

We thought it was really good!  I've been making this since I was in High School, (I'll soon be 70!)  but the sour cream was a new addition.  I love how the beans stay "meaty".

I made this, the 1st time, a few years ago, when searching for different type of green bean casserole. I was so over the fried onions, cream of mushroom stuff. Let me say, this recipe did not disappoint! It's incredibly cheesy and SO tasteful!! A huge hit!! I made it exactly how the recipe calls, which is unusual for this place. It's superb, even my 6 kids loved it.  I am making this for Christmas dinner again. A true staple in our southern  home.  Thank you for posting it!
