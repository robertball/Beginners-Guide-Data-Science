This was a great combination of flavors. I didn't love the marinade, though I loved it as salad dressing.  Next time I'll probably marinade the flank steak in equal parts soy sauce and olive oil.

Great salad, made as directed except for a change in the salad greens.  I didn't think I would care for the  celery in this salad but it all worked! I passed some blue cheese crumbles at the table. Voila!  Served this with Cheddar Bay biscuits from this site, nice meal!

Loved the dressing...I did use leftover grilled beef bulgogi from this site....and I also added some fresh sliced avacado, heart of palm and feta in my salad. The dressing really pulls this together.  I did decrease the olive oil to just 2tblspns which was plenty.  Great way to use leftover grilled flank steak and get your veggies in....lots of protein and low carb but still very flavorful. Thanks !

Made this for Recipe Group. We loved this! I have tried balsamic vinegar dressings before and am not a fan. However, this balanced very nicely between sweet and sour. I didn't really notice the vinegar taste in the steak-I used flatiron and not flank (at $2 difference per pound and I like the flatiron). Hubby was enthusiatic in his comments about it, saying it was a make again! I liked the radishes in it myself, the dressing seemed to take some of the bite out of them. We like 'kitchen sink' salads, so I will probably add more vegetables to it, but the dressing is a keeper! Thanks Mitzi!

My hubby and I liked this a lot.  Though I only used the dressing/marinade part of the recipe.  I substituted the cheaper Top Round for the Flank.  And my salad was made with arugala, tomatoes, crumbled gorgonzola, and sliced almonds.  But I did follow the marinade recipe exactly and it was delicious.

I made this recipe for recipe group, I used a flat iron steak because that was what was available. I made the marinade just as it was in the recipe, using a high quality balsamic vinegar. I think this made a big difference in the final taste. Skipped the green onions and added cucumbers. This was a big hit with my family, I was very surprised. My 2 year old kept saying it was "YUMMY!" Next time I would just  marinate the steak longer, it was a thick piece and I haven't uaed flat iron before, was very tender.  We'll definitely have this again.

I made this for Recipe Group.  I had never had Flank Steak before and found it cooked up quite tender.  I marinated it for 6 hours.  I really liked the marinade as a dressing, but I think the steak needed just a little salt.  The best part of this whole experience was that my husband got to use his new boy toy, a digital thermometer for the grill.  He just put the probe in the meat, set it for 160, and walked away.  It beeped when the meat was ready.  Very cool!

Very yummy!  I added red onion and cucumbers (instead of green onion) and used top round steak.  Turned out great!

Way to much of a vinegar taste with the recipe followed exactly. Will not make this again.

I felt it would be too much of a one note meal, so I made small side salads with the dressing and I marinated skirt steak instead of flank.  If I make this again, and I may, I would increase the garlic and decrease the sugar.  I made the salad as written and loved the radishes. ***Update*** I had some marinade leftover from the original meal and used it to marinate pork chops.  We loved the result!

Marinate your steak in what you normally would use.  Omit the radish (love them, but don't work with the steak).  Add grilled green beans or asparagus, blue cheese crumbles, red onion and mushrooms.  You will get a hearty salad, with lots of textures and flavors.

I made this recipe for the Recipe Exchange Group recipe for the week of April 12th. We liked this pretty well. I have never marinated steak in my life as I'm usually too cautious for that, but I'm a team player, so I did it this time, and it DID make a VERY tender piece of meat. I'm sure most of you already knew that but the difference was quite interesting to me. I did however marinate my meat for over 24 hours as life interfered with my plans. The only changes I made were to omit green onion (forgot to buy any) and switched out the brown sugar for Splenda (ran out apparently). Well unless you count that I used a flat iron steak instead of flank steak as a change. We could've done without the tomato and been very happy, however we ate it since we're team players :) I sliced mine into quarters and then scooped out the icky stuff so that all I was left with was firm tomato meat, so I diced it. (We just don't like tomato, this isn't a fault with the recipe.) Thanks for the recipe, I might use that marinade again sometime!

This is AWESOME.  I don't think it even needs the steak to be good!
