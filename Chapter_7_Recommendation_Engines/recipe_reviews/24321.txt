This recipe is ok. Its a good starter recipe. I might make it again but next time will leave the onion out. With the onion left it, all it tasted like was onions and I made the recipe as stated. Onion should never be in Mac and Cheese, to bad I learned the hard way...

We made this for Christmas Eve dinner and it was really a hit.  Definitely the best home-made mac & cheese I've ever tasted.  Can't wait for an excuse to make it again.  The sauce turned out incredibly well and it baked beautifully.  The only thing I would change next time is to cover it for the first half of the cooking, as it got a little dry -- nothing major.

The only adjustment we made was to the types of cheeses.  We made it with 8 oz white cheddar, 8 oz sharp yellow cheddar, and about 4 oz of mozzerella for smoothness.  This blend of cheeses really had a nice bite to it.

Will definitely be making this again.

I made this dish for family dinner tonight and it was amazing! My mom, dad, and sister went crazy for it. I made a few changes, including switching processed American cheese for Mozzarella and adding some crushed up crackers on top. I baked the dish covered for thirty minutes and then added the crackers and baked uncovered for 10 minutes. Also I used almost an entire 16 oz package of macaroni. With just 8 oz, it looked like cheese soup with some noodles in it. If you want your mac and cheese EXTREMELY creamy, I guess that's good. Even with almost 16 oz of pasta, the dish was still very creamy and not dry at all. I plan on making this for a graduation party we're having in a week and I'm very excited to see how it turns out. I plan on playing around with different measurements of both regular cheddar, sharp white cheddar, and mozzarella. This recipe is a great base for a delicious dish.

-- Update: I baked this dish for our BBQ and it was a HIT! I doubled the recipe and even then it was all gone by the end of the party. This time I used (proportionally) 1/2 sharp white cheddar, 1/4 regular cheddar, and 1/4 mozzarella. It was amazing! I also doubled the pasta again this time. I used almost 32 ounces of pasta, leaving about enough out for a regular sized bowl of pasta (probably a couple ounces). Baked it for about 45 minutes covered, then took the top off, added crushed crackers, and baked for another 10 minutes. Man, I will be making this dish my whole life! It is so delicious!

This is a great recipe for creamy baked mac and cheese. I had a 16 oz package of elbow macaroni, so to double the sauce, I used the same amount of flour but doubled the butter and added about 3/4 more cheese. I didn't bother slicing the American cheese into strips, just chunked it into the saucepan to melt. I also didn't use sharp cheddar since I'm pregnant and find sharp cheddar too greasy lately, but a shredded mild cheddar / monterey Jack mix did the trick. The finished product was a cheesy macaroni with a thick, creamy sauce. Although I didn't try it, I'm sure this recipe would be great with a bread crumb topping. Will make again. Thanks for the recipe! :)

Ok, I made this for a group of 32, including myself.  I had my doubts about it while making it, but I've got to tell you, the finished product wowed everyone, including myself.  Next I'm going to add ham to it, as well as a bread crumb top.  I gave it four stars and will certainly be making it in the future.

This is the best recipe for Mac&Cheese! It's easy, it doesn't take a long time to prepare and it's cheap! I love it because the taste is so authentic! It's better than my mom's Mac&Cheese! (Sorry!) And you can add/vary the recipe. For example, I didn't use the onions,and I added 1/2 cup of Colby cheese along with the Sharp Cheddar(NY) and American Cheeses, then put bread crumbs on top when I baked it. 
It was (is) delicious! Enjoy! :)

This recipe is absolutely delicious and is quite easy to make.  It was just as wonderful 2 days later when I reheated it in the microwave then stirred in a small amount of milk. The only bad review of this recipe mentioned tomatoes, so I am guessing that she gave a bad rating to the wrong recipe.  If you're looking for a tasty but easy mac and cheese recipe you must give this one a try!

This mac and cheese was a hit at my potluck! It was the only mac and cheese dish that ended the evening empty! I did use three cheeses; a shredded mexican mix, some cubed velveeta, and some american cheese (all combined to be the amount in the recipe still). It turned out very well and was sooo good!

When your husband cleans his plate and your mom asks for the recipe you know you've put something good on the table and that is quite satisfying.  This recipe epitomizes why certain foods are called "comfort foods."  Rich and creamy, mildly but pleasantly flavored, this hit the spot as part of our barbecued rib dinner. Hubs requested a medium rather than sharp cheddar, and before baking I topped it with some crushed crostini which gave it a nice finish.

I wanted to make this an "all in one" meal--I threw in a good amount of chopped turkey ham and a heaping cup of leftover roasted broccoli I had in my fridge that I chopped into small pieces. Flavor-wise, this reminded me of the macaroni and cheese Mom made for us kids with "gov'ment" cheese. It turned out a little dry but that could be fixed next time with a little more milk. I'd make this again but with a recipe and a half more cheese sauce.

This is delicious, creamy macaroni and cheese that my whole family enjoyed. The only change I made was to make a topping with about 2 tbsp melted butter mixed with 3/4 c pnko breadcrumbs and 1/2 c shredded sharp cheese. The crunchy topping, baked on the dish for the whole baking time, adds a great textural and taste element to an already delicious dish. Thanks!

I was attracted to this recipe because of the size, tomatoes, and sometimes "old" recipes are the best recipes. Anyway, I guess everyone has different taste buds.  Everyone in my family tried this and no one wanted to eat it including me. I had to fix something else for dinner.

We have finally found a mac and cheese that is NOT bland! I pretty muched followed the recipe as written but doubled it and used colby/jack for part of the cheese and sprinkled more sharp on top. Word of advice if you want a very creamy mac and cheese don't bake it is it is fine without it(we were eating it before putting in the oven)we baked it for the time called and I think next time I will just put it in the oven long enough to melt cheese on top..although very good baked just not as creamy. Very much a keeper!!!

I crushed some spicy croutons, sprinkled them on top and drizzled some melted butter on them before baking.  It gave the dish a nice zing!

I have made this recipe many times and I've finally gotten it down to a science. Both my boyfriend and I felt there was too much flour so I've reduced the flour to 1 tbl ,3 tbls of butter, I use about 1/4 a tsp of salt, 4 cups of milk, 1 tsp of mustard powder, 1/2 tsp of black pepper, 2 pounds of extra sharp cheddar, 8 slices of American cheese, and a 16 oz box of pasta of your choice.  I left out the onions and melted some butter to soak the bread crumb topping in. Magnificent! I even won the holiday potluck dinner where I work!

This was a great recipe. My first time making baked mac and cheese and everyone loved it. I used this recipe with three differences: (1) I used smoked cheddar for one of the cups of the shredded cheese. The smoked cheddar/onion combo was VERY popular!; (2) I added a topping as per a video on this site. I melted 1 tbsp of butter in the microwave then mixed in about 2/3 cup of seasoned Japanese style Panko and sprinkled it on top for the last 15-20 minutes of cooking, and (3) I used an 8oz. Velveeta for the processed cheese.

I liked this recipe, but it is what I am used to. Baked Mac and cheese is more like a casserole than Mac and Cheese. It is supposed to be....cutable. Like into Casserol peices. Some people mentioned it was dry. Baked Mac and Cheese is traditionally drier, so if you want something more....Shells and Cheese like, try a stove top recipe. I do see some "baked" recipes that are VERY shells and cheese like, but they are not Traditional Baked Mac and Cheese.

I just won my work's Pasta Cook Off (yesterday!) with this recipe!! Super easy to make (I was almost asleep on my feet by the time I made it) and doesn't require any weird/expensive/hard to find ingredients!

I made a few changes - I forgot to buy onion so I made it without. Let the butter melt in the pan and just added flour, etc. 

I went to Target and in the milk/cheese aisle, I got the cheap blocks of Target brand cheese - 8 oz block of each as follows (NOTE: I doubled my recipe to 12 servings):
Monterey Jack, Colby Jack, Sharp Cheddar, Provolone

When it came time to add the cheese I thought 'there's no way I need all this!' but MAN am I glad I added all that was recommended! 

I didn't use dry mustard - I've never bought it in my life and wasn't about to spend $2.50+ on something I needed a tsp of, so I just squirted the right amount of mustard from a bottle in my fridge. And due to making this the night before and not wanting it to dry out - once everything was ready to bake, I covered the pan with tinfoil and then sealed it with the lid that came with the pan and put it in the fridge overnight. I got up early the next morning, took the covers off and popped that baby in the oven. Covered it again, with tinfoil, for about half the bake time. Finished by changing the setting to broil (I had added a bag of sharp  cheddar cheese as topping) and let it darken. The pan sat in a warmer for a few hours at work before the party - but it was still cheesy and delicious! I won!

Hard to go wrong with this recipe, as long as you know you're taste level for onion! I can see 1/4c being overwhelming for some, including me.

My only tweaks? Less onion, maybe 1 Tbls., but grated, which is stronger than chopped. I followed other reviewers who added 4oz of cheese (+/-), and I was heavy-handed with the sharp cheddar blend. I think it would do better to be heavy on the American/Velveeta instead for a smoother consistency.

Generally a great recipe, though--adults and kids alike LOVED it at our Thanksgiving dinner!

I made this for two Thanksgiving dinners and Christmas dinners with my friends and it literally disappeared in minutes, even in a 9 x 12 pan.  I prefer to pour the drained macaroni into the pot with the cheese sauce, mix them together well, and then pour the whole concoction into the pan.  

At first, I mashed butter crackers and mixed them with melted butter to sprinkle over top, but now I just cover the top with shredded cheddar cheese.  Also because I live in Asia where many western ingredients are either hard to find or prohibitively expensive, instead of using dried mustard, I used a teaspoonful of dijon mustard with coarse mustard seeds the second time I made this which made it even more popular than the first batch.

A true comfort food this is! With both Velveeta and sharp cheddar cheese in this recipe, I knew this would be a hit with my family. This really made for a perfect combination! I omitted the onions (personal preference). The directions were easy to follow. The consistency of the cheese was nice and melted easily into the milk mixture. While baking I could see the cheese bubbling up all around the baking dish. The aroma of cheese was so inviting. Towards the end I sprinkled a little bread crumbs on top. Just as I figured, this was a hit with everyone. They actually loved this baked up. The macaroni really held up well with all the cheese baked right into the noodles. The cheese was creamy and yet, clung to the noodles. What can I say but just wonderful ooeey and goooey cheeesy! This is very satisfying and fulfilling. I also served this with, "Breaded Chicken Fingers," and "Restaurant Style Coleslaw II," all from this website. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

I made this especially for my vegetarian child, and the rest of us can't stay out of it.  I rarely eat mac n cheese - don't usually like it.  This is how mac n cheese *should* taste.  I made the recipe almost exactly as written, only exception is I used a combination of cheeses I had: sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, some american, and 2 triangles of laughing cow spreadable swiss.  The taste is phenomenal.  The onion adds a special something, but you don't even know it's there.  I used more macaroni than called for - next time I will stick to the recipe.  It looks very 'soupy' but it gets drier after baking, so I think the proportions are probably right on.  Thanks for sharing a fabulous recipe.

i made this for my boyfriend and myself, today. (: i left out the onions and did a double-batch, since i used a whole box of pasta. i did 3 cups of milk and 3 tbsp. of flour, instead, though. i also added ham, which is a sort of staple in our house, and did sharp cheddar and a mozzarella/provolone mix.  we both LOVED it!

I wasn't too crazy about the American cheese. Also I don't recommend subbing medium cheddar because I think sharp is required so the American won't overpower. Tomorrow I'll mix it with some summer squash sauteed w/ a can of Ro-Tel - that'll make it a 5-star dish!

My photo is currently on the main page. :) It was really good but I did omit the american cheese and onions as my bf wanted traditional mac n' cheese. I used sharp cheddar as the main cheese. I also mixed in garlic cream cheese into the milk mixture. I topped with breadcrumbs and Parmesan and baked covered for 20 minutes otherwise it would have been dreadfully dry. I then uncovered for 5 or so minutes with a couple more on broil and it came out looking and tasting great. So glad I could make mac n' cheese without heavy cream - thanks!

Good flavor, awful texture. If I make this again, I probably won't bake it...I'll just toss the warm cheese sauce with the noodles and serve it immediately.

this was so delish! i changed mine a little. topped it with panko crumbs mixed with butter and parmesan cheese. i only baked for 10 mins at 350 since some reviews complained it gets dry. then I broiled the top to get the crumbs nice and brown and crispy. this outshined the rest of dinner. i kept telling myself "just one more bite" until I was ready to burst! honestly, this is almost too good... i love mac and cheese (or anything cheesy!) and this will be my new addiction!

I was so happy to find this recipe.  This is a real old-fashioned, comfort-food type recipe.  I even used light Velveeta in place of the american cheese and it was awsome!  The sauteed onion and dry mustard are key in this recipe.

This is a real "diner-style" mac&cheese.  For the reviewers who wrote that theirs was grainy, give it another chance with evaporated milk, which is stabilized to prevent this problem.  I also used only Velveeta in the sauce and mixed the cheddar into the cooled macaroni before adding the sauce.

I haven't made it. But I'm sick and tired of the criticism  and "helpful" hints. Post your own recipe instead of tearing down others. You are not "helpful" with your condescending tips. You know who you are

This is the best Mac&Cheese ever! It deserves MORE that five stars! My mom just can't stop eating it! (btw, if I don't take it away from her soon, she'll eat the whole pan!) ;) I used all sharp cheddar - we're not too big on American Cheese. I also added a bread crumb and parsley topping. It got crispy when baked, and added a nice contrast to the a soft macaroni! This is now one of our favorite dinners. I got so many complements on it! You've got to try this!! :D

I was looking for a mac and cheese recipe that didn't call for processed cheese. I liked how simple this recipe was. I just omitted the processed cheese and used a colby/jack combo (it's what I had on hand), and did without the onion. I double the recipe. My kids really liked it. I thought it was a terrific, easy recipe!

Before baking, this gives you the illusion that it will become creamy cheesy goodness. If you're looking for a creamy mac and cheese then this isn't for you. I didn't have sharp cheddar so I used the medium that I had on hand and I also used deli sliced American cheese. I would stick with the sharp as the recipe calls - it needs that extra zip.   This recipe definitely didn't wow me, it was just ok. On my quest for the perfect mac and cheese recipe this just did not fit the bill. I don't think the recipe is at fault though - I think I've decided that I just don't care for mac and cheese.

UPDATE: made 1.5x the pasta without doubling the sauce. Used Kraft single slices for the processed cheese with marble cheese. Delicious! 

Good.
Kept the onion, but I love onions.
Doubled the pasta without doubling the sauce, might do 1.5x pasta next time.
Just used marble cheese, same amount.
Added crum topping.
Covered for first 20 mintues of baking then uncovered for remaining 10 mintues.

I never rate recipes, but I've been using this one for years, and I have never been disappointed.  I have changed it just a little to make it even more wonderful.
increase dry mustard to 1 tsp.
add 1 tsp hot sauce (like Frank's)
add chopped ham
sprinkle with crushed potato chips or toasted saltines (in butter) prior to baking.
THE BEST MAC & CHEESE EVER

I think that the recipe is supposed to call for a 16 oz package of macaroni.  That is what I used and it worked out perfectly.

I didn't use any onion, and used honey mustard instead of dry mustard.  You could almost just eat this out the pot... it really doesn't need baking for that long.  DELICIOUS.  Will make again and again.

Mac and cheese never seemed worth the calories before I found this recipe. I grate my onion because it seems to work better and use a mix of pepperjack/cheddar/processed cheese. Thanks!

I think this recipe turned out very well!  I added chopped fresh broccoli and minced ham to make it a more complete meal.  The only thing I would say is that it was VERY rich in taste, my husband loved it though.  Next time I would probably skip the processed American cheese and go with something like mozzarella.

I thought this was very easy and really good. I've never really been able to make macaroni and cheese come out right. It's usually to thick. But this came out perfect! My husband and kids loved it too. Will be making this often. My kids love macaroni and cheese and now they don't have to get it from a box! Thanks so much for this recipe.

Excellent recipe. I didn't add onions into casserole. Instead I crumbled part of a container of French fried onions and sprinkled that over the top. Also used Velveeta instead of American. Very tasty. I will make this again.

This was the best Mac and cheese I've made. I left out the onions (Onions? really?!) and instead of the processed American I used more cheddar and added some Blue cheese, basically what ever cheese I had in the fridge is what I used.  So Yummy!

Very good very hearty. Have made a few times. Only change i made was I added more pasta. Amount stated didn't seem to be enough. Great recipe though!

This is a very easy to make, quick, straight-forward dish. I substituted the onion for onion powder because I thought I would mind the "crunch" but will definately include real onion next time. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

Thanks GEPETTO_69!!  I omitted the onion as some in the family isn't crazy on them, and I didn't use dry mustard. I used cheddar and added some mexican cheese blend in place of american cheese, and I always lightly butter my glass baking dish before adding the pasta to it to help avoid it drying out some. I added extra shredded cheddar on top before placing in the oven as well. Thanks again, the family loved it!!

YUM YUM! I grated onion added less than 1/4 cup maybe a couple tblspns.  Added mustard not mustard powder bc I didnt have.  Didn't add American cheese bc I didnt have.  added Worschester (little splash) and added baylead in milk mixture.  Also added cheese and paprika on top.  Sprinkled with panko at end and i had it in a shallow pan so there was more surface area=more crunch

I just made this recipe and it was wonderful. Very creamy. After having this mac and cheese I don't think i will be able to make it like i did before, it wouldn't taste as great! I think the onions gave it a great flavor and even after baking it the whole 30 mins it still turned out to be creamy and delightful

I did not care for this recipe. It has a very unappealing texture. I was looking for a somewhat dry Mac n cheese.  I even bought Boars Head cheese to make this and grated it myself instead of getting the pre-grated.

This was pretty good, although the velveeta I used was a bit overpowering to the cheddar.  It was a little soupy too.

This is our favorite mac and cheese recipe.  The onions added a nice flavor to it.  We think it would have been bland without them.

This was a great recipe. I added in kielbasa sausage for some added flavor. The sharp cheddar was a good mix to add in. I will definitely be making this again :)

I just made this with some extra cheddar instead of the american cheese (I didn't have any) and about a cup and a half of left-over pulled pork. It was one of the best things I've ever put my lips on.

I made this for the first time for my daughter's birthday party and it was a huge hit!  My friend that was helping me added some seasoned bread crumbs (made from wheat potato bread) to the top about halfway through cooking.  Fantastic!

My family is in LOVE with this recipe.  We made a decision years ago to quit buying anything in a box, with tons of preservatives, and began to make everything homemade if possible.  I've been looking for a great mac & cheese recipe, and this is it!  Fabulous!  All of the leftovers are gone too!

Not as cheesy as I had hoped, maybe I didn’t put enough cheese in because I didn’t really measure.  But I still loved it!  My boyfriend said he likes the version with the tuna added in better but I still like the plain old mac & cheese!

Loved this! Instead of chopping the onions, I grated them. My kids can spy an onion a mile away so I always grate the onions so you get the flavor, but not the chunks. I used a combination of the sharp cheddar and velveeta cheeses. I'll make this again and again.

This mac & cheese is truly to die for!  I did not change a single thing about this recipe.  Follow it to the letter and you will not be disappointed.  The addition of the processed cheese made this creamier than any other mac & cheese recipe I've tried which always seem to turm out gritty!

Husband Loved it!! I've tried other Mac and cheese recipes, didn't really care for them, especially my Husband who happens to be a picky eater. 
I did some tweaking,  instead of using the type of cheese that called for 2 cups, I used instead 1 cup of Finely Shredded Italian Cheese. For the other kind of cheese, I used 1 cup of Shredded Sharp Cheese. I also used a few shakes of Grated parmesan cheese. Put in a couple of shakes of Worcestershire. 
Used a Red onion instead, green seems to us too strong. 
To top it off, after putting the finished product in a casserole dish,  I had poured enough extra milk on top and a few more shakes of parmesan cheese. We like our Mac and cheese, well at least my Husband does, a little bit more moist,. I put it the oven for One hour and 10 to 15 minutes longer.  I found out if in oven for 15 minutes longer,  for us it comes out perfect. It may look dry, but it's not. Also by using less cheese, it's not over powering.

Great taste. I did use the onions, added more flavor. Used a teaspoon of savory and garlic. I mixed up the cheese a little, used 1 cup of sharp cheddar, 1 cup of mozzarella and 1 cup of marble. I had those left in my fridge. Turned out amazing, definately recommend recipe.

Really delicious and easy to make.  I sauteed sliced mushrooms along with the onions and put some diced tomatos in right after I brought the sauce to a boil.  It turned out very well and was a big hit at home.

This recipe is delicious! I liked it a lot however  it does taste like normal oven baked mac & cheese. If you don't like onion just do a quarter of an onion. Make sure you use the right amount of cheese or else it ends up not as good, I think I'll make this again. If you read the bad review just add less onion. Enjoy!

I thought it was good though I think there's a bit too much cheese for me. Maybe it has to do with me using 12 slices of extrathick cheese. And the baking dish I used wasn't big enough as I couldn't fit all the macaroni in there. I'm scratching my head thinking "where in the world would find a quart baking dish?". Next time I'm going to use the regular cheese rather than the extrathick one.

This recipe is better when modified. No onion because who puts onion in Mac and cheese? And no American cheese because that's the nastiest cheese I can think of. Replace the American cheese with a can of Cambell's cheddar soup and this recipe is so much better. It's way creamier. Also, to the people who complained about how dry it came out: did you use a bag of preshredded cheese? Try shredding a brick of cheese instead and then you won't have to deal with the dryness that comes from the potato starch that is in bagged cheese. If you want some extra deliciousness, add a tbs. of hot sauce and approx. a quarter pound of boneless buffalo chicken and some panko on top.

I wanted a quick and easy mac and cheese recipe, and I have definitly found it. I decided to try it out for lunch today, just me, in case it doesn't come it so good. Well I didn't need to be so worried it came out amazing, a perfect balance of creaminess and sticking to the pasta. Will definitly be trying it out for supper one night.
I did the whole recipe without using any measuring utensils, so I can't wait to try it using measuring utensils. It also means I think I added to much pasta, and not enough of the cheese sauce. I did regular cheddar as opposed to sharp, and skipped the onion because I don't like onions. Maybe next time I'll add some onion powder.

I made this mac and cheese for a remembrance dinner I am throwing in memory of my girlfriends father who passed last year! I skipped the onion and in place of the pepper I used Mortons Nature's seasonings. It turned out WONDERFUL. This will replace my old mac and cheese recipe! !!

This was not a success for me.  I followed the recipe completely, but the end result was rather dry and had an unpleasant texture (rather grainy).  The taste was alright but pretty bland and the sauce was not creamy and unctuous like you want with mac and cheese.

Oh my heart! This was sooo good!! Even my boys-ages 5 and 8-ate it! And they HATE onions! This was so creamy and cheesy and EASY to make. A new favorite at my house!! Thanks! (next time, I have to figure out how to make the top not-crunchy)

Yum! Kids loved it. I only made a few changes because of what I had at home. I used all medium cheddar cheese and a couple of squirts of  yellow mustard instead of dry mustard. Yummy!

It's basic and cheap to make but not very flavorful. I left out the onion because I don't like onion, but the rest I kept the same. I was amazed that for the amount of cheese I used, the sauce didn't taste very cheesy. Not worth the calories until I can figure out how to make the sauce better.

I made this exactly as stated, I think!  I wasn't sure what processed American cheese meant, so I used Velveeta as I saw others used it too. Other than that, I followed the recipe. I thought it was great & everyone loved it!  It's easy to make too.  I will definitely make it again. Thanks!  P.S. had leftovers the next day and this was even better tasting!

This was really, really good.  I used Velveeta instead of cheese slices and I didn't have any dry mustard!  I put a tiny bit of nutmeg.  I also added ham chunks.  I'm not a huge fan of Mac and Cheese and this was terrific!

I have been making this recipe for at least 3 yrs now, and it has become a family favorite.  I have also made it for several church functions and I never bring any home.  I took the advice of several and never use the onion.  I also eliminate the salt because we feel the cheese is salty enough.  I use Velveeta for the American and I don't always buy sharp, sometimes, half sharp and half mild. I guess bread crumbs would look nice, but I don't need any extra calories and I'm not sure my picky grandsons would eat them, so I don't bother.  I have also made this the night before I need it, refridgerated it,  and adjusted the length of time it baked. An all around good comfort food!

This was very good! I doubled the recipe but kept the same amount of flour, as one reviewer did. And I am very glad I took another reviewer's suggestion to add more macaroni....I used two full boxes of medium shells, and I may have been able to use more. The sauce was very smooth and creamy, and everyone enjoyed it. My only addition was crushed, buttered Ritz crackers, which I believe not only added to the presentation but also kept the top from drying out. Thanks for a very good mac & cheese!

was very good.  I used 16 oz package of elbow maccaroni and doubled the recipe.  I used a little over 3 cups of milk and added various cheeses instead of the american cheese because I had mozzerella and colby/monterrey jack cheese already at the house.  My fiance had 3 plus helpings of it.  I will make this recipe again.  The onion was chopped finely and couldn't tell if there was any in it.

First try at mac and cheese and was very surprised how delicious this is.  No more boxed mac and cheese for us.  Used extra sharp cheddar and velveeta and its awesome.  Also added more onion (personal preference)and topped with some bread crumbs.  Definite keeper.

Absolutely fantastic. I make this for the family all the time and it is a hit every time. I do add different cheeses sometimes, just to mix it up. Also the thicker you make the rue the cheesier and stringier the cheese sauce will be.

I made this last night for Thanksgiving dinner and it was by far the show stealer of all the dishes. I doubled the recipe, making 12 servings, omitted the onions, used 2% milk, and used large elbow macaroni (use the large ones, I'm telling you, it makes a big difference- pun intended) ;) I sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on the top before baking for 25 minutes. Everyone couldn't stop raving about how good it was. Next time I make this dish (which I DEFINITELY will), I may use a little less velveeta and a little more sharp cheddar, as I prefer the real cheese flavor more. (The leftovers are almost even better than the original!) Highly recommend this recipe!

This was such an easy recipe. I adjusted according to my serving size and it turned out perfect. I like creamy Mac-N-Cheese and this was. I added some Mozzarella cheese to it but equaled the same amount of cheese the recipe called for. Will make this again!

The best mac and cheese ever.  I double the noodles to make it go father.  And by farther I mean  I turn the leftovers into baked mac 'n' cheese balls.  After sitting in the fridge for 2 days, I scoop mini balls, coat with soft butter, then roll in panko seasoned with salt and pepper.  Bake @ 400oF for 10 minutes.  Turn on low broiler for extra crispness.  Serve with ranch dressing.

This is the first time I've made baked Mac & Cheese and it was good. I added a couple things that I saw in other recipes, like a little Worchestershire Sauce. The other thing I did was my own idea, after 20 minutes of baking, I added French's Dry Onions on top and baked 10 more minutes. It was delicious!

OMG!!!  This is the BEST mac and cheese I've ever made.  I only veered slightly from the original recipe.  I used 12 slices of white processed american cheese (singles), I left out the onions due to my son's aversion to them, added about a 1/2 tsp. of sea salt and a couple shakes of garlic powder.  I also used melted butter/bread crumbs on top.  It's nice and creamy with good flavor.  The true test though will be if it reheats well.  I'll update when I reheat.

We didn't use american cheese, since we were keeping it lactose free. The adults loved it, but the kids wouldn't have anything to do with mac-n-cheese that didn't look like Kraft.

I've never made mac and cheese from scratch, but this was so easy and so good! The family loved it.  I switched up the cheese a little- I used sharp cheddar, a small handful of shredded pepperjack (to give it a little bite), a handful of mozerella and a little cream cheese because I had that on hand.  It was creamy and so delicious.  This will be a regular for us! Thanks for the great recipe.

Made according to instructions, except added 4 Tbspn of Romano cheese and 3 Tbspn of bread crumbs on top. Next time, I would cut down on the amount of onions and maybe increase either the amount of pepper or dry mustard...could have had a little bit more zip to it.

It was a very easy and fast recipe. This def beats any boxed mac and cheese. It was a bit bland to me so I don't think I will be making this again. I seem to like baked mac and cheese better when sour cream is incorporated. This was a great "starter" recipe for young cooks though!

I've been looking for a good Mac and Cheese recipe for my BF, I do not personally care for it.  Have tried a few and he said this one is finally it!  Other than slightly scaling it down, the only thing I added (per his request) was a little bacon.  I noticed others mentioning that onions should not be in this dish, but my BF strongly disagrees.  That was one of his requirements as I looked for a good M&C recipe.  Although this starts with a roux, it is not gritty like others have been.  Yay!  Very creamy.  Oh, I did use a cheddar/jack cheese mix plus the processed cheese.  He said it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this!  Now we finally have the right one :)

My search for the "great mac n cheese" recipe has come to an end. This recipe is delicious and super cheesy. I did top it with crumbled ritz for a crunch. So good...

This is an awesome recipe...I doubled the recipe and I did do some things differently,  I used Save-Alot Velveeta cheese brand, and sharp cheddar for the Cheeses. I added some minced garlic with the onions, Then put some cheddar cheese, then bread crumbs on top of the cass.  (just a light sprinkle on top.) While in the oven I heated two cans of stewed tomatoes and topped the Mac&Cheese with the tom.  Came out great. Took a pic also.

I made this for thanksgiving this year and I'm proud to say there were NO leftovers! nice and cheesy but I did leave out the onions. I also used 8oz mild cheddar, 8oz sharp cheddar, and 4 oz mozzerella like another reviewer suggested. It turned out perfect. Thanks for the recipe. I will continue to use it and have already passed it along to friends and family.

Fantastic!  I made this tonight for dinner and it was a huge hit with all of us.  I pretty much stuck to the recipe.  I don't have dry mustard so used regular yellow mustard.  And, I used a variety of cheeses (sharp cheddar, white American, Colby jack).  I did top it with bread crumbs at the end.  The only thing I would is add more milk because I'd like it to be creamier.  Otherwise, it was delicious!  Thanks for sharing! :)

This was okay. When I was looking for a Baked Mac and Cheese recipe, I was really looking for something that would turn out nice and crispy on the top and this wasn't it. It was a good flavor and all but very soft. It was nice a cheesy though, which I liked, but I would probably use all shredded cheese and no American Cheese next time with this.

This was great!  So cheesy!  I used Velveeta and Sharp Cheddar.  I also used crushed Ritz crackers on the top and drizzled a little bit of melted butter on them so they would brown nicely.  Definitely a "do-again"!

This was pretty good, but I would probably use only 4 ounces of Velveeta next time. I am a fan of cheese, but this was really quite cheesy. I'm going to try using some shredded swiss next time, as it's good in another baked mac and cheese recipe I have. It's definitely important to bake covered until the last 5-10 minutes.

Easy to fix the dry thing! Leave the lid on the casserole until about 5 minutes before it's done and then take is off to crisp the  top...that worked great.

The best Mac&cheese ever, my sister do not like eggs so this recipe was perfect. I made this recipe many times never changed a thing. Always comes out creamy. Perhaps the viewers that mac/cheese got dried out maybe because of the attitude or something like that, that you are in. Don't give up on this recipe it is heaven sent.

Pretty darn good mac and cheese! The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars rather than 5 is that I found it to be a bit too dry for my liking. Maybe 30 minutes was too long in the oven??? Or maybe it didn't need to bake in the oven at all? I tasted it right out of the pan on the stove top before baking it and it was wonderful! Creamy and delicious! I guess if you like it creamy, just don't bake it, or at least don't bake it so long.

I really like this recipe BEFORE I put it in the oven.  In fact, I was eating the leftover sauce out of the pan, but the 30 minutes in the oven made the sauce set up and even get a little gritty.  If I make this again I won't bake it.

When I announce we're having this for dinner, everyone comes happily to the table--on time! I have to quadruple the recipe for my family of ten, but it still comes out great. Make sure you have the Ritz Type crackers on hand--that seems to be the pièce de résistance for the kids!

This dish was so easy, but i underestimated how big my large skillet should be.  When I added the cheeses to the milk and onions my skillet was overflowing.  I also added breadcrumbs for the last 15 minutes to make a crispy top, but this mac and cheese recipe was really delicious!

I just fed this to 7 kids and they ate it all and asked for more!  I used 14 oz of pasta instead of 8 and it was not at all too dry or thick.  I used fun fall shaped pasta which are bigger than regular macaroni.

This is my family's favorite Mac and Cheese. I have made it several times and the only advice I have is to not skimp on the processed cheese. We often add a can of tuna, some chopped up chicken or some frozen veggies to make a more complete meal.

I've tried so many mac n cheese recipes from this site and haven't found a great one yet, but this one fits the bill! My 4 year old asked for more (and didn't complain once that it wasn't from the box) and almost everyone at the table took a second portion. It's just as good reheated also! Thank you so much for sharing! We'll definitely make this one again.

Great Mac and Cheese Recipe.  I think it's onions and butter that make it so delicious.  The only thing I added was a little garlic powder and plain bread crumbs the last 15 min of baking.

Great Great Great recipe!  I just made this for a Christmas potluck at my company with 20 people.  It was gone in 30 minutes and this was tripling the recipe!  Will definitely make again.

I make this at least once a week but I add BACON!!! And I’ve made it with and without the dry mustard. The dry mustard really adds a nice bit of flavour to the cheese sauce. Definitely recommend using it.

According to my son it's "the best mac 'n cheese (he's) ever tasted." Easy to make and much better than the boxed stuff.  I made 2 alterations.  I used onion salt rather than regular salt.  My mother and grandmother always substituted onion salt for regular salt.  And I crushed seasoned croutons and sprinkled them on top before baking.  YUM!

I gave this a 5-Star rating cause it was a good start to a basic recipe.  I added some finally chopped cooked bacon and leftover chicken breast in the freezer so I added that too! I like a very cheesy & moist Mac & Cheese so I made more cheese sauce by adding Gruyere Cheese (gave it a richer taste).  Making a cheese sauce is easy by starting out with 1 tblsp melted butter, add 1 tblsp flour + 1 cup milk.  Increase this base in increments in the same proportions and add any type of cheese you like.  It's a great dish to play with!

I added an additional 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar, and panko breadcrumbs on top. This is so damned good; the recipe I've been looking for all my life.

What a great find!  I love this recipe. I've taken it to parties, funerals, and picnics.  Everyone complements it. I leave out the onions because I'm not a fan. Instead of macaroni, I use the shell pasta and I add bacon crumbles.  Very rich and satisfying.  Definitely not a diet food!

I made this on the fly for comfort food for a relative who was staying with and was ill. I used the cheeses I had on-hand so the cheese break down was roughly 1/3 Velveeta, 1/3 aged gouda and 1/3 blue cheese. It was fantastic and we all enjoyed it, both the ill and the well. Yes, I would make this again.

I was entertaining two grandchildren for dinner tonight, ages 6 and 9, so I used mild cheddar instead of sharp. I liked this mac and cheese and the grandchildren did, but my husband prefers something a little more sophisticated with more cheeses. It is a basic mac and cheese with no frills, and sometimes that is what you need.

I will never go back to box mac and cheese. Made this for my family and they absolutely loved it. The only thing I would suggest to anyone who wants to make this is to buy a block of cheddar cheese and grate it. Do NOT buy pre-shredded cheese. Freshly-grated cheese makes recipes taste way better.

I made to tonight for dinner, as its -24 and we needed some comfort food. I remember my grandmother making a baked mac and cheese, and hoped to replicate the recipe. I improvised a bit with the recipe doubling the macaroni as others have suggested, and adding three diced mushroom with the onions, and a little olive oil to compensate for the butter the mushrooms soaked up. The mixture didn't thicken quite as well as I thought it would, so I panicked and added a tsp of cornstarch. It was unnecessary, as once the cheese was all added things got quite gooey and thick. I used 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar, 12 slices of white cheddar slices, and 1/2 cup mozzarella. Also, I didn't have dry mustard so I added 1 tbsp of Dijon and it was AMAZING!  Finally, I baked for 30 minutes covered with foil, then popped it off and threw on 1/2 sleeve of crushed soda crackers and cooked for about 5 minutes. Letting it sit for the full ten minutes allows everything to set and you have the most flavourful, robust, and hearty macaroni and cheese ever!! Loved it. Gave all the leftovers to my son so I wouldn't pick at them and eat it all tonight. :)

A couple of important additions:  Grate the onion, add Fontina cheese as well as the cheddar AND add Worcestershire sauce.  Top with crushed Ritz crackers.  No other will do.  This mac and cheese is perfection!

I've been making mac and cheese the same way for 40 years. the only difference is I use Velveeta and cheddar split halve and halve. Makes it tastes just as good.

The flour overpowered the taste of the cheese, and I actually added additional white cheddar to the cheese sauce mixture.  My family didn't like this at all.  It tasted pasty and didn't have the creamy cheddar flavor we were looking for at all.  Ground mustard was a mistake as well.

I just made this EXACTLY AS WRITTEN. It was the perfect home-made or restaurant style gooey mac & cheese. NOT DRY. Not too much onion. Not bland. If you're substituting other cheeses beware- the American cheese is there for the gooey factor. The sharp cheddar is there for the zip that makes it delicious. I can see making this again, exactly as written, or throwing in a bit of chopped up cooked ham, or some broccoli, but very little because the balance of pasta and sauce was perfect. Don't let substitutions ruin this recipe! :)

I've been trying various mac 'n' cheese recipes to try to satisfy my son-in-law for Thanksgiving. I like this one very much. I would like to point out that American Cheese is NOT NOT NOT Velveeta! Velveeta is processed cheese food; it's what you feed real cheese! Not a substitute for American Cheese. I will be using this for SIL's traditional meal, but will use the multiple cheeses he thinks it needs.

Loved it!  Unlike other Mac n cheese recipes, this actually had some flavor that complimented the cheesy goodness. I absolutely loved the onion here.

I made  a few changes. Since I was using a 16oz box of elbow macaroni, I doubled the recipe except for the flour. Instead of doubling that, I added just a teaspoon extra. Also instead of chopping the onion, I grated it which allowed the taste to be there without the bits of onion to be visible. I swapped some of the velvetta for Parmesan cheese. Lastly i threw some breadcrumbs on top before baking. 

Absolutely delicious. It's very rich so a small serving goes a long way.

This was great and really easy to make. I did use shells instead of macaroni, since it was what I had on hand, but it worked out really well - I honestly think that shells hold the cheeses better. The kids and husband loved it and so did I, and I am very finicky about mac and cheese - I will NOT eat the stuff in the blue box. The kids didn't even notice that there was onion in it, which they were unimpressed with the last time I tried a new mac & cheese recipe. I only wish I had tried this before throwing my husband's birthday party - it would have gone over great! And I agree with another reviewer, there is no mention of tomatoes anywhere in this recipe. The person that gave you only one star (martha blair - did you intend to comment on a different recipe? No disrespect intended) and commented on the tomatoes must have been posting a review for the wrong recipe. Making this again tonight with some steamed broccoli, because we all need vegetables! ??

My youngest daughter is very picky , this is the only recipe she wants me to make every time . She gets very excited when I make it. She packs it for her school lunch the next day. Her friends can't believe it's home made. I don't change anything from the recipe. It's amazing. Thanks for sharing.

This was fantastic!!! I'm a mac n' cheese fanatic...nothing could beat my mom's homemade mac n' cheese...until I made this. So easy and came out perfect. My only changes: I did not add onion, and I used penne pasta instead of elbows (my preference). I also added a little panko breadcrumb topping...simply delicious!

Very good but needed extra 8oz cheese, I tried mozzarella for creaminess;  also made it with 1c milk, 1 cup 1/2 and 1/2.  It also needed a bread crumb and crushed cornflake topping.  Yes, cover it for the first half of cooking time.  My recipe was 5 stars, but gave original one 4 due to needed ingredients

This is a wonderful mac & cheese recipe!  I love the addition of onion & dry mustard.  They gave it a bit of zip that most recipes don't have.  I took ShawnChef's advice & added buttered breadcrumbs to the top & it was wonderful. We'll be making this often.  Thank for a great recipe.

Substituting Fontina cheese for the processed cheese keeps the creaminess without the processing.

This is the basic recipe I use. A white sauce, cheddar and american cheese  1 tsp prepared mustard..  I don't add onion. and omit the added salt.  Cheese is salty enough and can be added at the table if desired.  The best mac and cheese is when you add all kinds of cheese to it.  Try adding a little hot pepper cheese for little kick. When we have a cheese tray left over I use the cheeses. Very flavorful. I also use buttered breadcrumbs for a crunchy  top .

I doubled the recipe because I used a 16 oz box of elbows and found that the 4 cups of sharp cheddar produced a very greasy and oily dish.  Next time, I will cut back on the amount of cheddar and use either gruyere, fontina and/or monterey jack.

It's a great base! I use mozzarella cheddar and velveta.  I also use onion powder instead of actual onions. (I did that the first time and all we tasted was onions.) Also plenty of garlic,  salt and pepper. My boys love it!

I omitted the onion, used spicey brown mustard and subbed mozerella for the American cheese.  4 cups sharp cheddar and 2 cups mozerella with a touch of cream cheese. Panko on top.  Was the hit of my tree decorating party!

Great recipe.  I don't use American cheese, just on general principles (I'm not fond of it), but use more cheddar, instead.  I tend to use red-rind hoop cheese, more often than not, and through in a bit of cottage cheese, like my Mom always did.  But this is very similar to her recipe. The onions make it much tastier.  We love it.

My whole family really enjoyed this basic mac and cheese recipe!!  I have another, more 'grown-up' mac and cheese recipe that totally appeals to the adults but the kids don't like it so much, so I was looking for a great basic recipe for everyone to serve at a party.  Everyone raved about it!  The only thing I did different was omitted the onion as I was running short on time and my kids don't like them so much, but with the dry mustard, I don't think we missed it.  I will definitely be making this over and over again!!

Delicious! Made minor modifications and this has been a hit whenever I bring it as a potluck dish.  I doubled the recipe, and used 1 tsp onion powder instead of onions.  For the cheese, I used two 12 oz. bags shredded sharp cheddar, and two 12 oz. bags of Trader Joe's shredded Mozzarella/Colby Jack/Cheddar mix.  I also sprinkled additional sharp cheddar cheese and Progresso Italian Flavored Breadcrumbs on top. Used a 3 quart baking dish, covered for the first 30 minutes, then uncovered for 15 mins to brown top.

This is the BEST Mac and cheese!  I disagree with the reviewer who said to leave out the onion. I think that's what makes it so good. This is my go-to recipe. It is always requested when we have family gatherings. I have varied the cheese (Swiss, provolone, etc) some times and it is so good. It is awesome as stated in the original recipe. Best ever!!!!'

This recipe is very similar to the one I grew up with and have been trying to replicate for many years.  My husband couldn't stop making yummy noises while he ate it.  Would give it 10 stars if I could.  Because we love onion, I did alter the recipe slightly by adding more onion - either way, it's a winner!

To all reviewers who left out the onion, you are missing out on the depth of flavour it adds to mac & cheese. It did not taste 'oniony' at all. I had a bunch of cheese that I wanted to use up, so I added a 1 pound mix of old cheddar, Monterey Jack and fruilano. I also covered the dish with foil for the first half of baking to keep it creamy. The top turned nice and golden in the last 15 minutes. We just loved this dish.

I left the onion out because I just have a personal opinion that onion doesn't belong in mac & cheese. I couldn't find "American" cheese other than American cheese slices(which are a cheese "product") so I used velveeta. In doing so, I probably didn't need the roux. I used half 2% milk & 1/2 half & half. I would NOT recommend doing that unless you like your mac & cheese so rich & thick you could use it for wallpaper glue :) Flavor is good. I think I'll make this again, using all milk & no flour.

This was excellent! The only thing I changed was eliminating the onions. My father said it was better than Stoufers. I used block cheese that I shredded myself since it melts much better. If you do that, 8 ounces of block cheese equals 2 cups shredded.

I've been looking for a recipe that comes closest to my mom's and I've found it.  I used an entire 16 oz box of macaroni b/c 8 oz wasn't enough and I omitted the onion and dry mustard and I used velveeta instead of american cheese b/c that's what i had on hand.  This mac & cheese is cheesy, creamy and just delicious.  This simple recipe is now my go to recipe.  The key to great mac & cheese is quality cheese.  I used cracker barrel instead of other brands.  Thanks GEPETTO_69!!!

Tried on my in-laws Christmas day party. Was one of the first things gone. Thankful I left the onion out to begin with. Definitely will become a staple at get togethers.

Fantastic. I cook often and for some reason I've never made Mac n cheese until today. This was perfect. I had to alter some cheeses since I was just using what was at the house. Extra sharp cheddar, American, and parmesan. The taste was out of this world. I left out a little milk, and the cheese sauce was so thick and delicious! Thumbs up!

I'm searching for the best mac and cheese recipe as a base for Lobster Mac and Cheese.  (I don't want to waste lobster!)  I tested 3 recipes this afternoon, and this is by far my favorite.  The egg-based recipes were too custardy, and roux-based ones are usually too gritty or pasty.  However, this was super-cheesy and there was not a hint of flour taste. Be sure to remove the roux from the heat as you slowly stir in the milk, then return to the heat and stir constantly until it just begins to boil.  Then add the cheese.  I like the consistency after it cools, it doesn't puddle.  If you like less dry, try baking it covered. I can't wait to play with it using different cheeses, and with/without the onion, depending on my guest list.  And the lobster!

I did make a few changes:
-used about 2 tbsp of finely grated red onion in place of the 1/4 chopped onion
-in place of the processed cheese I added some mixed grated mozzarella, jalepeno cheddar and swiss
-based on the reviews, I baked for 20 mins, then topped it with a panko crust (1 cup panko crumbs, 2 tbsp melted butter, 1/4 grated parmesan) and baked for another 10 mins

We really enjoyed the flavour and texture of this.  Most of the other recipes I've tried were too dry or lacking flavour, but this one is definitely a keeper

This was a fabulous mac and cheese. I left out the onion for the sake of simplicity, and it turned out fine. I also used shell pasta instead of macaroni, and sprinkled some breadcrumbs on top. The family loved it too!

I left out the onion and substituted 6 slices of smoke gouda for the American -- we left the edge/wax on, but will probably remove that next time. It had a great smoky flavor, and was some of the best mac & cheese I've *ever* had.

I had high hopes for finding my ideal Mac & Cheese but,sadly, this did not turn out to be it. My ideal is very creamy with a nice tang from added mustard and/or sharp cheddar cheese, and with no added meat or veggies. 
I doubled this recipe and did substitute Velveeta for the packaged American cheese. The cheddar I used was a good quality Sharp Cheddar. Before spooning into the pan to bake I tasted it and found it needing more mustard (for my taste).  I stirred in an additional 1/4 teaspoon of dry mustard and baked as directed. I did not over-bake this. 
I found the resulting casserole to be on the dry, pasty side and still needing more oomph . . . from more mustard and or more cheddar. I concede that our college freshman daughter and her six friends seemed to like it well enough, though. As for myself, I'm back on the hunt for a richer, creamier version.  I'm sure this is just a personal preference problem on my part, and not a faulty recipe.

So I've used this recipe about 10 times, it's amazing! I always use a cup of mozzarella cheese instead of the american cheese slices. I also top it with a light sprinkle of panko, it adds a lovely touch of crunchiness.

This turned out great--very creamy!  I did add a bit of fresh minced garlic to the onion, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  My kids actually said it was better than "the blue box"--which I've certainly never heard about any other mac and cheese I have tried before.  Of course, you could spice it up with additions and toppings, but our kids seemed to appreciate its simplicity.

Im going to give this a 4 star. I made it as is except I made a double batch used velveta"amercian cheese" and didnt have the sharp cheese so I used med cheddar,mustard AND dejon. I didnt have the dry stuff. It has great flavor but to me and the husband we thought it was a little dry. But nothing to complain about. I think it may be because I didnt use the sharp? (maybe?) I have it in my saved box and will make it again. Thank You!! (Now back to reheating the left overs) YUM!

Yes. Used white habanero cheese instead of American cheese and added bits of smoked salmon. Added sunny Paris from penzeys spices in the seasoning. Had it with Alaskan king crab legs and ceasars salad for our first Christmas in Alaska dinner.

This is the greatest mac'and cheese recipe I've ever had in my life. My family proclaimed it was even better than my grandmother's. I did think that salting the macaroni made the overall dish a little to salty so I didn't add salt to the sauce.

This recipe is pretty good I sauteed the onion a little longer but not too much longer maybe 4 minutes. Never had onions in Mac & Cheese before think it's pretty good. Also I added some grated mozzarella cheese just b/c I had it around.

This recipe is awesome! I did change it up a bit. Nothing too drastic but I'm just not a big fan of American cheese. I substituted for Habanero cheese and man it was so good! Thanks for the recipe!

Thought this was very good, I did make a couple of changes... I only used 1/2 the onion and I added lots of different cheese ends.. It came out great and everyone loved it!

This was really good!  I used 1 1/2 cups sharp cheddar, 4 oz. Mozzarella and 8 oz. Velveeta cheese.  Way too many calories and fat to have very often but a nice treat. Thanks for posting!

I give my version of this recipe 5 stars. I substituted 1 cup of the shredded cheddar for 1/2 cup of gruyere and a 1/2 cup of packaged, pre-shredded Italian cheese. I also added 2 cloves of crushed garlic. There seemed to be too much sauce for the noodles, so I used about 12 oz, but I would just adjust the amount of noodles ot your personal preference. This recipe is a keeper!

YUM! I added some cayanne pepper to spice it up and used onion powder instead of onion because I had it on hand.

The only thing I would do differently is use Wondra instead of all-purpose flower, which made a noticeable difference in the texture.

I omitted the onion and dry mustard and used a mixture of Vermont Cheddar, Mild Cheddar, and Sharp Cheddar and the American Cheese called for in the recipe. It was absolutely delicious. My husband, who is very picky about Macaroni and Cheese loved it too. I will definitely use this recipe instead of the store boxed one from now on.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe.  However, I used a 1lb box and followed the rest of the recipe exactly and I had just the right amount of sauce.  I added some smoked sausage and it was delicious!

This is my favorite baked mac and cheese recipe, because it is an easy foundation to work with and comes with no fuss. I mix up the cheese concotions each time and bake it with bread crumbs on top. I agree with others, bake covered for half the time. It's also a nice portion for two people. I only eat leftovers the day after, which never goes to waste. Couldn't love this recipe more!

This mac and cheese turned out really good. I omitted the chopped onion and I didn't have the dry mustard so I used ground red pepper for flavor, and it was great.

This recipe is definitely better than the one I was using before, so for that, thank you. I tend to add a little more onion than the recipe calls for, as well as chopped up mushrooms. I also sprinkle some wheat bread crumbs on top before baking it so that there's some added texture. I cover the pan with foil except for the last 5-10 mins since I prefer the top of the mac and cheese to be soft. I would recommend this recipe to others. It seems pretty fool proof, and it seems there are endless modifications and additions that can be made to match people's tastes.

This is a great recipe. I used smoked guda, sharp cheddar and jack. Topped with crumbled bacon and YUM! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I like a crumb topping. I used bread crumbs mixed with some butter and crumbled on top then baked. I also baked it covered then uncovered to brown at the end..This added a nice crust. Will absolutely make again!

this was the first time I've ever made mac & cheese from scratch and it was AWESOME!! it was the first side dish gone on christmas day. My husband added bacon bits and it was delicious. I used triple cheddar and sharp cheddar both from kraft and preshredded. I am getting ready to make it now for dinner :) highly recommend!!

Really good! We made for thanksgiving and I didn't have any issues with the onions at all. I did actually added some cubed pieces of ham in and when there was about 15 mins or so left i crumbled some ritz crackers on top to give it a crunch. Everyone raved about it.

I loved this recipe.  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I didn't use the processed cheese,  used sharp cheddar, white cheddar and mozzarella.  I also shredded it, i didn't buy it already done.  The recipe needed to be doubled for a large group.  Every bit of this mac and cheese was eaten up and everyone said it was the best they'd had.

As I expected, this recipe was just oozing with cheesy goodness! Next time I think I may top it off with bread crumbs to add a bit of variety in the texture.

This was absolutely Awesome!! Followed the recipe exactly, but put in a little less salt and added some garlic salt for flavor.  I will definitely make this over and over.  I Can't imagine ever eating Box Macaroni again. Recipe was pretty easy and quick to make, but used alot of dishes.  Everyone raved about this dish!!!

Baked mac and cheese should always have bread crumbs! Good ingredients, though I did my own thing with the measurements. I also used mild cheddar and harvati. I think the onions are a great addition.

I thought this was delicious. My mom made it last night. I make another version but i had always added onion to that one. Thiss  one seems to be the best of bolth worlds. The onion REALLY compliments the cheeses. Anyone who says the onion flavor was to stron or overtaking probbaly used an onion that was strong. My thing with onion is you should always ajust the ammount to fit te pungency. If your not a good enough cook to do that then you dont belong rateing this recipie.

I thought this was excellent.  The texture was perfect.  I did omit the onion because I wasn't sure if everyone would like that addition.  I followed the recipe except for that.  It was a hit at the cookout we attended!

I thought it came out dry and I did not like the American cheese in it. It was ok but I won't make it again.

After reading a number of reviews I went with the no onion version, which I was told was a good choice by the crowd I made this for last night.  I too, like some others added a bread crumb top to it, I used Progresso's parmesan cheese bread crumb mix.   I also had to use "extra" sharp cheese.   Bottom like everyone loved it.   I baked for a bit longer since it cooled while transporting to a friends house.   I should ad that transporting in the baking dish is a bit risky since it is a bit soupy before baking, If you are going to transport keep it in a large bowl and put it in the baking dish when you get there, bake it longer since it has cooled.  @ 350 almost impossible to burn it.

Wonderful recipe.  My mom is an amazing cook and she loves my mac and cheese recipe.  Careful not to bake it until you are ready to eat it.  Once it sits around after coming out of the oven, it can get a little pasty. Honestly, I think it tastes great without even going into the oven.  I served it for a party after it came off the stove while it was still hot and it went over really well.  I would think you could even put it in a warmed crockpot to keep it warm while serving it for a party so it won't get cold.

This recipe was awesome and a hit at my son's rehearsal dinner.  Instead of using the American Cheese cut into strips I just used Velveeta Cheese. Everyone loved it and it didn't take long for it to disappear.  Easy too.

I liked this recipe. It was perfect for my other half! I enjoyed making it and used Velveeta and Cheddar and took a recommendation of the bread crumbs and it turned out very nice.

I had a craving for Mac and Cheese, and came across this recipe. Everyone loves it and now this has become a new family favorite. I made what should have been 12 servings for my son and 3 of his fraternity brothers and they ate it all!

This tasted delicious, by far the best macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted. I didn't bake it because I like my mac and cheese saucy. Could that be why it tasted grainy? That was the only problem I had with it, and I think it's either because it was meant to be baked or because of the flour. Next time I may try corn starch to thicken it.

Wonderful!  I made minor changes - grated the onion (less noticeable to the kids), did not have American cheese, so I substituted 1/4 cup grated parmesan, and topped the whole thing with bread crumbs.  It's a winner in this house!

Oh My Gosh! This was the best mac and cheese I have ever had. I used velveta, and mild chedder and crumbled potato chips over the top because I was out of bread crumbs. AMAZING! The subtle hint of mustard gave it 5 stars!

This is really good, but I didn't bake mine.  It seemed enough people had issues with it after baking it, and it tasted great before baking, so I figured I'd just leave it the way it was before baking, and I'm glad I did.  Right after I mixed the macaroni and cheese sauce mixture, I was thinking it didn't have enough of the macaroni and too much sauce, but after 15 minutes of sitting in the pot, the noodles absorbed the moisture and it was then perfect. I could see how it would get very dry if you baked it.  I will make again!

I'm glad to read (after I made this, of course) that I was not the only one who ended up with gritty cheese.  I cut the American cheese in half and cut out 1/2 cup of the shredded cheese because that is just a ton of cheese and I wanted to save on some calories.  But when I mixed it all, it was so fabulous.  I couldn't wait to serve it to DH!  However, after I baked it, we both ate a small helping and the rest will probably go in the trash.  It was so gritty!  How does that happen?  DH was chuckling a little bit at my expense because I was bragging about how good dinner was going to be...  Loved it before baking, but after, it was nasty.  Will definitely make again for a stove-top recipe though!

This was good mac n' cheese.  Very creamy! I'm actually eating some right now (the day after) and it is still creamy.  A little bland though.  Next time I will use extra sharp cheddar to give it a little tang. Also, I will add a little more onion.  But even without those changes, it's pretty good!

This is a creamy kid-pleaser that adults will like too. It's just a tad bland. Be heavy handed with the spices, add a good shake of garlic powder, and top with seasoned bread crumbs (I used Jason's). Then you'll have a winner.

This is the ultimate in comfort food with a gourmet twist! I didn't have fresh onion, so I used a little bit of onion powder and garlic powder. I also used a shredded cheese blend made by Kraft called Classic Melts, 4 cheese. This was perfect, easy to make and cheap. This would be really good with crushed Ritz crackers on top...this is my new mac and cheese recipe.

This was definitely a good recipe - very rich though!  Wouldn't want to eat it as the main course.  I'm thinking it's because of the processed american cheese.  Next time I may try American Cheese cut fresh from the deli counter.

My lady loved this but I think it was a bit, I don't know how to say it, pasty, for Mac and Cheese.  My roots are southern so maybe I am use to more traditional Mac and Cheese.  I think she liked it because her background as far as Mac and Cheese is more along the Kraft type Mac and Cheese.  Was it cheesy?  Absolutely.  And for those who enjoy that style of Mac and Cheese, you'll enjoy this.

The recipe is delicious exactly as written.  I'm confused by the reviewers who think Velveeta is in the recipe.  There is no Velveeta cheese in this recipe!

I made this as written and it did come out a little dry despite being covered for the beginning of the cooking period as suggested by the reviewers. I still liked it a lot though, the cheese flavor is great and it heated up well the next day for leftover with a little milk to soften it. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Great Foundation for a homemade Mac and cheese. I don’t do the onions and dry mustard. Keep it simple. The additions for me are Pre cooked Bacon that I chop up and put in the cheese mix and I crumble Ritz crackers and sprinkle on top prior to baking.

This was a bit at our family Thanksgiving! I used medium cheddar instead of sharp and I topped it with Panko bread crumbs. This one is a keeper!!

I used cutoff ends of cheese that my local supermarket deli packages up. It adds a bit of surprise as to the end flavor because the mix of ends is often times quite varied.

I made this for our robotics team. So I made 22 servings, it's a lot! I used 'cheese ends' from the deli that I had purchased and froze some time ago. Which means there was a variety of cheeses. This makes it tastes so good!

Great recipe! Easy to follow and perfect ratio of cheese to mac. The only thing is...I saw a review that mentioned to leave out the onion so I did and i’m glad I did. DON’T ADD ONION.

It was so nice! As a mini-chef, I really enjoyed experiencing this recipe. Although we made to many cheese sauce, and we ended up having to make more elbow macaroni to save the drowning ones. Either way, you should make this recipe yourself! It was very appealing, and fattening.Yum!

Hmm, might be mom's favorite but not sure how many kids would want the onion.  The onions and flour taste over power it.  If I decided to try this one again I'd leave out the onion and cut down the flour.

Very yummy. It was very good and the sauce was very creamy. The Mac and Cheese can be cut like cake out of your pan. It is very, very, very, filling. My whole family loved it when I made it for them. They were like, "How could a nine year old make good food?". Defenitly one of my favorite recipes, other than Annies.

I get requests for "my" famous mac and cheese at every gathering.  I've made it several times and have tried the original recipe and several of the more popular changes.  I think most are really good.  The white cheddar option was my least favorite.  This is a must have recipe in your cooking arsenal.

I highly recommended this recipe!  I did swap the cheeses and omitted the onion. I double the recipe and used 1 block of white extra sharp cheddar, 1 block of yellow extra sharp cheddar and 1 block of Colby. Everyone had seconds and filled their containers with left overs at the end of the night. Next time I am going to swap the Colby out for smoked Gouda or Gruyere.

My husband and I absolutely loved this! In regards to the person who thought it was too oniony, I am guessing that they didn’t cook the onions long enough as ours didn’t have an over the top onion flavor at all. All of the flavors blended perfectly together.

I made a few adjustments, using extra old cheddar and some parmesan. Topped with panko crumbs. I think I may have found the best mac & cheese recipe - my husband loved it!

This is so close to my granny’s recipe. I doubled the recipe, left out the onion, and used the tripe cheddar blend. When doing that- for the rue I added all the dry ingredients to 1 cup of milk and 4 tbsp of butter (since it was doubled), heated that until thickened and then added the remaining 2 cups of milk, 1 cup at a time waiting until it thickened to add more.

This is my go-to mac and cheese recipe. I usually double the recipe (and am very generous with the cheese, I like to use good quality extra sharp cheddar) and make it for the holidays.

Will make this again.  It was easy and very good, but I think next time I will add more onion and spices.  Those extra flavors were mostly lost in the cheese flavor, and I would 
Iike to bring that out more.

Very good base recipe. We used some dried onion granules instead of fresh and doubled the recipe, but in doing so based on other reviewer comments only increased the milk by half and substituted more cheddar and some parmesan cheese in lieu of more American cheese. Also topped it with some bread crumbs. It was excellent. Next time I'd like to try adding some finely cubed ham pieces.

Prepared recipe as written. What I loved - the consistency of the cheese sauce was great. The ratio of sauce to pasta, perfect! Sometimes my mac dries out after baking, this one did not. What I didn't love - the Dijon mustard. I thought it'd be okay since I do like the flavor of Dijon, but for me it just tasted weird and most everyone who tried it agreed, but we still ate it and it was okay .If you're a real mustard lover its probably fine. Next time I make this, I will swap out the Dijon for 1 tsp. garlic powder, and swap the bread crumbs for Ritz crackers as the topping was okay but I think Ritz will be tastier. I have tried garlic powder in other recipes and really like the light garlicky flavor in my mac&cheese. This is definitely a good base recipe that can be tweaked to your liking :)

My whole family loved this version of Mac and cheese. My son said it was the perfect ratio of sauce to pasta. The only change I made was I like the top to be crunchy so I sprinkled Panko crumbs, paprika, Parmesan cheese and a bit of melted butter on the top.

I made a vegan version of this recipe, using almond milk and vegan cheese. I also opted to leave out the onion (as I'm not a big fan of them) and switched the dry mustard for chili powder. It turned out very well and was a big hit with my friends! I also added some breadcrumbs on top before baking just to get a little crunch

Very good! I added 1/2 cup of panko bread crumbs to the top before baking. I also double the recipe and froze half. That's TBD how freezing will turn out.

Made this recipe last night and it turned out perfect! Followed recipe exactly as is. Hubby was worried about the American cheese mixed with the sharp cheddar, but he took it back when he had his first bite- LOL! The onions added great flavor. Next time, I'll add 1 chopped jalapeno and saute it for 1 minute right before adding the cheese for a little kick. This is a keeper for sure!  Thank you for sharing!

My sons enjoyed the m&c. I used 16 oz of pasta and 16 oz old cheddar cheese, no processed cheese. Added more milk as sauce was a little thick, used onion powder for fresh onions. Sprinkled the top with buttered panko crumbs. Baked for 15 minutes, then broiled for 2 minutes to brown the top more.

I have made this recipe numerous times and every time it just keeps getting better! This recipe calls for onions, but I have never put onions in it and it taste fabulous still! Tonight, I ran out of milk and had to use Half & Half, it tasted so good, but I must warn, creamer is a lot more fattier.  I wouldn't off used it, but I had no choice.  This recipe is  fabulous and I recommend 
it to anyone who is just thinking about making it!  Have an Awesome rest of your day!    '1 Thessalonians 5:15 '

I made it for a large group (used 2 lbs macaroni); it was great and I had several compliments. Other than increasing the quantities I made exactly as written. Very cheesy and creamy.

Delicious! I made a few adjustments: 

1. left out the onions
2. Instead of American cheese, used 1/2 sharp cheddar cheese, 1/4 mozzarella and 1/4 medium cheddar in equal-ish proportions
3.  added crunchy fried onions to mix 
4.  last 10 minutes of baking, topped with more cheese and crunch fried onions

Excellent recipe that's easy to alter to your specific tastes. I really enjoyed the subtle onion flavor in this dish. I did use 8 ounces of cream cheese instead of the American cheese as that's a preference of mine. I also topped with crushed Ritz crackers prior to baking.

This also reheats really well unlike a lot of macaroni and cheese dishes I've made.

It was a hit! I made it exactly as instructed with one exception. I was just shy of the required shredded cheese and added a bit of velveeta. It did make it lovely and creamy!

good solid mac & cheese. wanted a straightforward recipe that my daughter could follow while helping me cook on Thanksgiving. Came out perfect. I'd probably vary the cheeses but it was very good as is.

We've made it as is many times and loved it. Was a bit soupy with 8oz of noodles. We use 12 now. Over time we have had to make it wheat free and reduce the amount of lactose. Cook the gluten free noodles one min less than the minimum cook time. We use gluten free flour as well and unsweetened almond milk.  No one knew when I made the switch except for the noodle shape. Use the cheese as directed but using the SHARP cheddar in our house is a must.

Yummy as is. Used onion powder because I didn't have an onion.  Made it a second time with mozarella cheese instead of American cheese to make it stringy.

This was a good foundational recipe. I didn't have dry mustard so I used 1teaspoon of mustard. I also added a couple shakes of dry onion.  For the cheese, I used 1 cup of a Mexican cheese blend, 1 cup of mozzarella and about 6 slices of aged white cheddar.  I used the variety of cheese because that's what I had in the frig. I was pleased with the cheesiness and texture of the finished dish. Will definitely make again and maybe even stick to the recipe!

Very good, but a four because I changed it up a bit by using half colby with the sharp cheese.  I also used onion powder instead of chopped onion.

I have made this recipe twice now. Both times everyone loved it. I always double the recipe. I use 16oz Velveeta, 2 cups of shredded cheddar, and 2 cups of a cheddar trio. I also add about a cup of cheddar to the top, before baking. My son hates homemade mac and cheese and has requested I start making this instead of the box.

I followed the recipe but did use more elbow macaroni that it called for.  Turned out pretty good but I think I should have used a bit more milk since I added more pasta.  But it was good and it made meals for me for several days.

This was my first time making macaroni and cheese and it turned out really well.  I made it as written, except I added the cheese just before the milk mixture boiled.  I was told that would help prevent it from separating and from becoming grainy.  I would suggest adding the American cheese first and then the cheddar, as cheddar seems more temperamental.  When I baked it, I covered it with tinfoil, which I read in other reviews would help keep it from drying out.  It was rich, creamy and delicious.  Very easy to make and the entire dish disappeared in minutes.  I will definitely be making this again soon!

This was an easy match for me. Very tasty. The only thing I would change is cutting back on the flour and adding some bread crumbs to top the Mac and cheese off.

This was really good and gobbled up by my boys. Easy to put together too. I don't like processed cheese so I subbed it out for mozzarella. Super cheesy. And crushed ritz crackers on top cuz easy. I might add some cream cheese next time for some tang. It's a good recipe that I'll make again but it still needs some tweaking for it to be 5 stars for us.

7 2 17 'Thought the sauce wasn't thickening so I added another T of flour.  After all that cheese, I realize it may have not needed it.  The cheese sauce was quite thick.  Okay-tasting.  K liked.  No raves though.  Something I noticed is that the cheddar is listed in cups & the American in ounces.  It's reallyyy cheesey.  I'm wondering if the cups meant cups & the 8oz meant one cup.  Four cups is alotta cheese for an 8x8 & 8oz pasta.  Now that it's refrigd, it's almost like shells with melted cheese, not a sauce really.

Very good!  I never cook my pasta first as it becomes too soft for our taste so I added a little extra milk and after 30 minutes, topped it with buttered panko crumbs and baked 15 minutes more.

Our whole family enjoyed this.  Thanks Gepetto_69!  We used 2.5 cups of a shredded cheese blend, only 1/2 tsp of salt, cooked 4 C. pasta, and added 3 cloves of minced garlic to our 1 small minced onion.  The onion was caramelized before the cheese sauce was made and gave a rich flavor.

I just tried this but used different cheeses.  2 cups pepper jack and 4 oz. sharp cheddar.  It was  a little too sharp, so added a handfull of mozzarella.  Perfect!

Loved this and very easy to make.  However, I made two small changes. I omitted the onion and added a bread crumb topping.  I will definitely make this again. Perfect serving size for two people with next day leftovers.   Next time I will  try adding some smoked sausage or hot dogs, but it really is good without making any changes to the original recipe.

Im not a fan of mac and cheese but this one really caught my attention. The onion really bring the dish up to another level. I made this for my little sister and she loved it and keep asking me to make it again. The only change i made to this recipe is that i didn't bake it in oven. I just baked the whole stuff together on stove without the bread crumbs. Its easier a bit and tasted fantastic.

I added ham cubes & a few drops of hickory smoke to make it a one meal deal. Very yummy. Will definitely make this again!.

This turned out perfectly and my family loved it.  The only change I made was to add some shredded colby cheese to the sharp cheddar cheese.  I followed the recipe exactly except for that.  It was creamy and very cheesy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Really liked the simplicity of this one! It was delicious when I first made it and I've found adding some thick cut bacon or cooked ham and some chives takes it to the next level. Yummmmmm!

I thought this was a great recipe written as is, but also a good one to expand on depending on your taste.  As someone suggested, I used a whole box of penne (only pasta I had at hand) therefore doubled the butter to 4 tbsp.  The rest was kept the same (I omitted the onions and used two squirts of yellow mustard since I did not have dry mustard).  I also added about a 1/2 cup of Colby and Monterrey Jack cheese to the sauce mixture and some to sprinkle on top.  BUT! May I suggest adding SMOKED CHEDDAR CHEESE!!  Adding this gave it such a delicious smokey flavor!  I added about 1/4 cup to the sauce mixture and also sprinkled some extra on top.  Omgoodness! Delicious!!  Like others, I also added some onion powder and garlic powder to taste, and panko bread crumbs with butter as the topping to the add some crunch while baking.  Delicious!  Again, try the SMOKED cheddar cheese! Yum!  You'll add it to any mac recipe you make from now on, I promise.

*I did cover with aluminum foil and took it off for the last 10-15 minutes of baking.

I didn't make any change on the first try but the options are endless such as different cheeses,dry bread crumbs,peppers and so on. The recipe was more on how to make it and less on how to prepare it, such as while the macaroni is cooking that gives you plenty of time to cook the cheese sauce then both are hot when mixing.

my mom used to make this all the time- we do make a couple of changes though. I added 2tbs of granulated garlic, i tsp smoked paprika, and 2 diced jalapeno peppers. Topped w/ half cup of buttered breadcrumbs. (I normally use 4 jalapenos but I made it mild for friends) this is great.

This was a huge hit at the table last night. Of course I did have to add a few things to add a little "Wingman" flare to it. I cut up a half a pound of bacon and cooked that till it was almost crisp. Then I cooked the onion in some of the bacon grease and added a couple of chopped up jalapeno peppers. Other than that, the cheese sauce was awesome and this was not dry at all.  This is a keeper!  #cookingwithwingman

Over the years I've tried many Mac & Cheese recipes.  But let's face it, when you have kids or you want a good old fashioned taste of when you were a kid this is the recipe!  It tastes a lot like Kraft's version.  Creamy, great flavor, and pretty much enjoyed by all.  I've even mixed in fresh lobster with this and it's to die for!

I really dislike when people rate recipes based on their own changes, so I'm giving this a 4* rating because.....I made some changes LOL The reality is, the majority of us alter recipes to our own taste. It is what it is ??

This is quite good based on the original recipe (in terms of cheese/milk proportions), but I wasn't satisfied with the flavour - too bland for my taste - so I put a bunch of cumin seeds & yellow/black mustard seeds in while sautéing the onions in half olive oil & half real butter (I actually used shallots bc that's what I prefer), as well as the mustard powder called for. I also undercooked my macaroni because I don't like my mac n cheese to be mushy or coagulated into one nasty lump after baking. This prevents that from happening. The last change I made was leaving the processed cheese out simply because it's not really CHEESE & completely grosses me out ?? I replaced it with more real cheddar. Next time I'll be adding some freshly grated romano, asiago & parmesan cheeses in place of some of the cheddar. 

Turned out great, lots of flavor & a good sauce-to-mac ratio. The shallots weren't overpowering in the same way I find onions to be in some recipes. They added just the right amount of flavor without making it too onion-y. 

Will make this again but will add some hotsauce similar to tobasco next time for a bit of kick, as well as some lightly sautéed cauliflower that's been riced-n-spiced (similar to the manner in which cauliflower can be prepared befo

Will definitely make this again. I thought the macaroni to cheese ratio was right on. Once I had the cheese sauce and noodles ready and hot, I didn't really see a reason to bake it, I just mixed them together and it was exactly what I was looking for, similar to consistency of Velveeta shells and cheese but sooo much better.

It was really good. I used different cheeses. I used Gouda and white cheddar. A little of the Kraft. I also have picky eaters and used onion powder vs. onions.  Worked out great. Just a lot of cheese and a lot of stirring. Yummy!

Keeping this recipe!  I doubled it because I was boiling an entire package of Campanelle noodles. We like how they hold the cheese sauce better than elbow macaroni. I also added a TBS of chopped fresh garlic when sautéing the onions. Once the noodles and sauce were combined in the baking dish, I topped it with about 2 more cups of shredded cheddar. There were no leftovers and I overheard multiple people say it was the best mac & cheese they had ever had.

I have made this many times over the years and everyone loves it.  I always make Mac and Cheese in a 13x9 pan so there is lots of crunchy to go around.  Even better, put it into a greased muffin tin for really crunchy.  The onion is best when chopped up very fine.  I use a combination of sharp chedder, swiss, garlic/herb cheese and gruyere cheeses.

Absolute delicious recipe. I  didn't have any dry mustard on hand, so I used spicy mustard. Also, the amount of onion used in this recipe does make the dish taste pretty oniony, so next time I may omit the onion or use less of it. Overall, my family and I really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing!

I prepared this dish with the same ingredients but doubled it. 
The mac and cheese was very creamy and the macaroni not overdone.
There are so many options for this dish and I may try some of my ideas the next time I make it!

Awesome!!!! I omitted the mustard because my husband doesn't like it. Then I used four cups of shredded Mexican cheese blend for the cheese. I put it in a handful at a time so it would melt easily. It was delicious!!!! Next time I'm not going to bake it because it looked so good straight from the stove top!

I made it mainly for my 18 months old baby and we love it! I skip the salt, pepper, mustard and American cheese. Used Mozzarella cheese only instead of Cheedar, and for better nutrition add diced tomatoes and chopped spinach right after the milk. Perfect! Thank you.

Easy & delicious.  I tried it with 2 boxes Kraft Mac-n-cheese and left out the American cheese, the cheese in the box mac-n-cheese made up for it.  It turned out even better.  You can add ham, green peas, etc... for a complete meal.

This was a great way to use up cheese! I made it with all cheddar and added a full package of pasta. It was really wonderful. I'm looking forward to trying it out with multiple cheeses. Thanks for the great recipe!

I love this recipe!!! It's a family favorite for sure!!! I substitute milk for whipping cream and add a little paprika, I also leave out the American cheese and finish the dish off with sprickle of cheese on top before baking. I also use a 1kg pkg of elbow pasta. Definitely a go to for a delicious quick meal!

I left out the onion because my kids hate onions. It was excellent by way of flavor. Id sugest serving it IMMEDIATELY after you melt the chesse in the milk mixture. I didnt, i had to cover it for 15 minutes till my husband got home from work and by that time the it chaged from ceamy deliciousness to sota chunky like a cottage cheese texture. I tried heating it back up but it didnt change. I will make ot again except ill serve it IMMEDIATELY as soon as the cheese melts in the milk mixture!

Used Vidalia onion, added a little bacon and topped it with a dusting of bread crumbs. Family went bananas. Also used regular American Cheese from the deli.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! My husband and I make it every year for Valentine's day and it never disappoints. Sometimes we use less pasta than what is originally called for to make it more creamy. The picture doesn't do this recipe justice, best mac and cheese I have ever had!

Made this for something different than my usual mac and cheese.  My family all loved it and it is very cheesy and delicious.  I did make a topping out of Italian seasoned panko and butter.  Will definitely make again.  I doubled the recipe and 6 adults ate almost the whole thing!  Yummy!

Made this for my boyfriend and I. We're already both big fans of stovetop mac and cheese made with Velveeta, but this has much more flavor, and is a lot creamier and cheesier. It also makes a TON more. We omitted the onions, as neither of us are big fans, but definitely have plans to make this again in the future!

I did take the onions out, I like mac and cheese period.  I also don't like American cheese so I used cream cheese for a second cheese.  The one thing I did wrong was leave it cook to long.  The flavor without onions was delicious, I will try it again with a little more milk or less mac and the correct cooking time.  I will post a second time when I try again.

This was so good! I made it with the cheeses we had on hand, cheddar and Asiago,  and it was a huge success. I read some of the other reviews and it seems like the cheeses are pretty interchangeable which makes this an awesome base recipe.

I made this according to recipe directions. Very bland and too starchy. My husband thought it was just okay. I tossed most of it and obviously won't make it again. Id prefer Stouffers over this one.

Husband and I both thought it was way too salty, too cheesy and too sticky.The only thing I can attribute it to is the Velveta.  This is the first time I have made Mac and cheese with Velveta.

Very good. I will add some garlic with the onions next time. I topped with Panko bread crumbs the last 10 minutes too and it added a nice crunch.

This turned out absolutely delicious! I used extra sharp cheddar and added plain bread crumbs,that I toasted in butter  Next time I will skip the bread crumbs and opt to cook a little longer for the burnt edges ,

This is a great base - creamy, cheesy and easy!  First time making so I omitted the onion, then topped with about 1/2 cup more grated sharp cheddar and 1 cup Panko crumbs tossed with 2 Tbsp. melted butter.  Couldn't stop eating it!  
Thanks so much for the recipe.

I have made this recipe with one exception many many times to rave reviews.  I use Velveeta. I know, I know - does not sound nearly as good as using "real cheese" and probably not as nutritious. And not appreciably cheaper. But, inexplicably, it is delicious!  Family and friends request it all the time.

We all really liked this recipe!  I've never found a baked mac & cheese recipe that is so creamy and yummy!

I tripled the recipe, so the measurements weren't all exact.  As much as we like onions, I put less than called for in, since I saw some reviews that said it was too much onion.  I didn't have any regular milk, so I used unsweetened coconut milk , which worked great!  I also didn't have sharp cheddar, so used medium.  It was fine, but would be better with the sharp cheese, as the recipe calls for.

Thank you for sharing this recipe, I will definitely be using it again!

I think this is a good recipe, but I would leave out the onions.  It should have a smooth consistency and the onion doesn't do it for me.  Maybe onion powder to get the hint of flavor with out the crunch.

I left out a good amount of the the american cheese only because those I made it for prefer the cheddar over all plus I added a block of colby jack. I also didn't add too much onion because although it smelled great as the sauce was cooking I never heard of onion in mac and cheese before and was a little scared.  My sauce never fully thickened either but those who ate it said it was awesome (not me...got a dairy allergy).  Very good recipe.

Good flavor with the onions and dry mustard.  Added crushed up Club crackers for last 10 minutes of baking.
Will try another cheese combo next time.

I've made this several times for gatherings and people always rave about it and ask me to make it for the next gathering! The only two things I changed were to omit onion as I feel the onion flavor isn't needed and double the recipe. It's always gone in minutes!

This was a hit with my sons who love mac and cheese.  I cut the onion down by 1/2 using only 1/8 cup of onion chopped very fine.  I was afraid if the kids detected any onion, the would turn their noses on it.  Will make again!

Five stars with the following adjustments:
1) finely grate the onion, so that you are mostly getting juice.
2) a little garlic in same fashion
3) add a tiny bit of nutmeg, paprika, and cayenne..or whatever your preference (highly recommended) 
4) cook in an iron skillet and you will end up with a wonderful cheesy crust.

I double all ingredients to make it saucy since it started off dry. Added a dash of westchester sauce, mustard and tempered in one egg to make it creamy thick and sticky to macaroni.

Good flavor, needs more pasta. That's a LOT of sauce for only 8 oz of pasta. Next time I'll try 16oz and a larger pan.

This was great. If you like it more creamier, add more milk and cheese to make more cream sauce and also had some velveeta chunks. I prefer to use onion powder over chopped onion also

I have tried over a dozen mac &cheese recipes. This is by far the best! I followed the recipe exactly and it was fantastic. Next time I might throw a little bit of spice in it for fun, but it was so good just the way it it.

I only gave four stars because I also left out  the onion and doubled the recipe. But this is definitely an easy, tasty dish. I make it for the vegetarians or kids at our parties. You can also prepare the night before, put it in the crockpot and set it to low for a few hours, then to warm, making sure to stir often at the low setting. Everyone loves it!

Made the recipe as stated, but left out the onions as I didn't think they belonged in the dish. Served for friends with smoked ribs. Rave reviews all around. Will definitely make this again.

This is quite a nice version of mac and chz. My family really enjoyed this. While I thought it was very good I would not go so far as to say it was great, or the best I have ever had, but definitely a recipe I will continue to make. I made one small change to the recipe and that was I left out the dry mustard. I have made several recipes that called for dry mustard and we didn't like the taste.

Used this as a base recipe. I have an onion hater in the house, so I had to make this without onions. I used a store bought three cheese blend with cheddar, colby jack, and cream cheese. (I have an objection to "cheese food" products.) I also sprinkled some shredded cheese on top before baking to get a nice browned crust. Sauce turned out great. Will definitely make again. Next time I'll add some paprika.

This was simple to make and came together quickly. I don't buy processed cheeses so I just used shredded sharp cheddar and Colby cheeses. I was hesitant to add the onions but I did and it enhanced the flavor and I was pleasantly surprised. Our daughter didn't like the onion texture so next time I will try an onion powder instead of the onion, but the onion flavor is a good addition. I didn't bake it because I like my mac & cheese creamy, but next time I will (my husband likes it baked) and add some panko bread crumbs for crunch. I really liked the addition of the dry mustard. For anyone making mac & cheese for the first time, this recipe is a great one to try.

This was a fantastic version of macaroni and cheese; it was a big hit. I left the onions out and tweaked the amounts on the ingredients a bit. It's a winner and its easy!

This was excellent! The first time I tried to make homemade mac'n'cheese, I burnt the sauce, and it tasted terrible! So I was a little shy trying this again. My 11 year old loves Kraft Mac'n'cheese, in the box, but I hate buying it for him. He was home sick today and decided to make this dish for him. And he loved it! He said it was way better than the boxed mac'n'cheese, which from him is a huge compliment! Thank you to the author of this recipe, you have vindicated me! LOL! It was super easy, and so yummy!! :) I left out the onions because my son hates onions, and instead of the processed cheese, I used sharp cheddar and marble cheese. And it worked great. :)

I will certainly be making this again, I live with a lot of people who each like very different things and this was a hit with everyone! I like to crack some black pepper on top with the cheese so it makes more of a crust and it gives the dish some texture.

I made this and we all really liked it. I didn't put onions in it because of the kids, and I'm glad I didn't. I don't think I would have liked it with onions.  It says to only use 8 ounces of pasta, but I used almost an entire 16 ounce box.   Would have been way too much sauce for only half a box of noodles. After we ate I mixed milk into what was left and stirred it up before putting it in the fridge. It reheated nicely and tasted just as good the second day. I like this recipe because it uses things I have already, nothing crazy but still tastes great!

This was a guideline as I searched endlessly for my moms mac and cheese recipe. I omitted the onion and american cheese. Cook macaroni Al Dente. Next I put a layer of macaroni approx. an inch on bottom of baking dish. I used cast iron. then I covered with Sharp chedder cheese. I then mixed flour with 1/4 cup of milk and the mustard and pepper. I then added rest of macaroni and cheese withholding  1/4 - 1/3  cup of the cheese. Mix all well and finally top with remaining cheese and add milk should be about 1/2 inch down from top. Peek gently. Cook 1/2 hour at 350 and remove lid cook 10 minutes with lid off. Let set 10 minutes

Very good, versatile recipe.  You can vary the type of cheeses to suit your taste.  It made more of the sauce than needed (and I like it really cheesy).  I doubled the recipe for a party, and  ended up with about 2 extra cups of the cheese sauce.  The next day I heated up the extra sauce and thinned it with equal parts of chicken broth and beer, added a dash of hot sauce, and it made an outstanding beer-cheese soup!

I used a pound of macaroni and the sauce was enough to accommodate the additional pasta.  I also sprayed the bottom of the pan to help prevent sticking. Also I steamed broccoli and chopped it up into the pan.

This was really good. I added finely diced jalapeno, chopped black forest ham and diced bell peppers. The amount of sauce was perfect and tasted great. I also crumbled plain chips on top and it was deadly. Not the healthiest meal in the world but it is the perfect comfort food.

Doubled the recipe for 16 oz whole pkg of cavatappi. Used 4 cups each of shredded cheddar and LF mozz. Omitted onion (for kids). Followed recipe to point of placing combined pasta and cheese sauce into baking pan.  Did not bake as kids do not like any crispiness!  Very creamy but did get less creamy as pasta and cheese cooled. If topping desired next time may try buttered ritz crumbs as they remain soft.

Just made this for a family picnic. Everyone said it was delicious! I quadrupled this recipe so it needed a bit longer in the oven. about 50 min. then under the broiler for a little browning.

I think there may have been a mistake in the weight of the macaroni.  I used a full pound of elbows, and it was plenty cheesy and delicious.  I'm afraid only using 8 ounces of macaroni would have made the dish taste too strong.  I will continue to make this with 16 ounces of elbow macaroni.

I originally made this recipe because I had some leftover milk and wanted to use it to make it so I could put something hot and unprocessed in the kids lunch for school.   The kids loved it and asked for it again.  I have rolled this recipe into our main Mac and cheese recipe to make for dinner as well.  I love the onion.  I also do not use american cheese, I just use cheddar. I have made this recipe several times.  It always turns out well.

My family loves this.  The only thing I do differently, I use Velveeta cheese. This is wonderful right out of the oven, and left overs taste great too :)

I really enjoyed this recipe, but I did make some changes. I used Velveeta cheese instead of American cheese. I also didn't use an onion since I read other reviews that the onion over powered the dish. Instead I used some onion powder and dry chopped onion. My family loves the mac and cheese I make now.

I read several recipes before deciding on this one as this had the primary ingredients I wanted to use as well as great reviews. I read many of the reviews as well; from the beginning, middle and end of the list. I enjoyed making it and before baking, found the sauce was very tasty and had a good consistency. I did add a sprinkle of Parmesan and panko bread crumbs over the top; our personal preference.  However, I didn't care for it as much as I hoped I would.  I found it to be rather bland.  It was a bit on the grainy side and as it cooled on my plate through the meal, the less appetizing it became.  I couldn't finish it, sadly. Despite the amount of cheese in the recipe, it didn't seem "cheesy". I wonder if more of the American cheese and less cheddar would solve that.  The search continues.

tried this recipe today, it was easy and turned out great!  Like other reviewers commented, I used 12 oz of elbow pasta instead of 8 oz and it was just the right amount to absorb the cheese sauce.  The saute onion made the mac and cheese vary fragrant. I used a mix of sharp cheddar and mozzarella per another review and it tasted great.  Will definitely make this again :)

My family just loves this.  I add about half a cup of grated Fontina cheese for a smooth, sharp flavor.  I also add a good teaspoon of ground red pepper for a bite.  This has become a family favorite!

I have made this recipe many times and I finally figured out why sometimes it is creamier than other times. DON"T cook the macaroni al dente!!  When you do that, the macaroni will soak up the cheese mixture during the baking process and be dry.  Cook the macaroni the full amount to tender, then it comes out much creamier.  GREAT recipe!!

Absolutely wonderful!! Pretty simple to make!
I doubled the recipe; however, I kept it at 2 cups of milk and it came out perfect. Accidentally put too much pepper hehe...
Thanks for the recipe and the video! Will definitely make again soon! :)

This was delicious!  Even my kids liked it, which made me happy.  Usually they only eat the boxed macaroni & cheese, and hate the homemade versions.  Sigh.

I doubled the recipe and made one change - I substituted shredded Mozzarella for the American cheese.

I wasn't sure of the taste at first because it seemed so cheesy...but it tasted great.  This will be my go-to recipe from now on.

This was so easy to make and very tasty.  No more box Mac and Cheese in this house.  I followed instructions with exception of baking it since the cheese was hot and melted, the mac was drained and I was hungry.  It was very good.

Basically tasteless.  Next time I will use only a sharp cheddar, only 1 cup of milk.  I will use onions and dry mustard but no flour.

No, I have not tried this yet,but it looks very good.
I did have a question did anyone make this with a gluten free macaroni?
If so did you do everything else the same?
I can't really give it a rating except for the reviews and the pictures.So I will give it a 4 stars.

This is a very good recipe. It is easy to prepare, minimal clean-up and delicious. I did add garlic & a little hot sauce, however; the changes are personal changes not necessary ones. My family loved it. It was a very cold dreary winter evening and this hit the spot.

This is really good. I omitted the onion because some of the reviewers said it wasn't very good. I didn't have any dry mustard so I didn't add any. I topped with bread crumbs. Next time I will add some lightly steamed broccoli or other veggies. Thanks for a great recipe.

Very tasty. Hubby and I liked this a lot but my kids didn't care for the texture (I think it was the flour added to the cheese). I doubled the batch and used a little more shredded MILD cheddar (that's all the store had in bulk) and a little less than 1 pkg of Am cheese slices.  Also sprinkled a little of the shredded cheese on top before baking (see my pic).

This was very simple to make. My kids asked for 2nds and 3rds. I didn't add the processed cheese and the next time I would probably add another 2 cup of cheddar cheese. All in all this will now be my go to macaroni and cheese recipe.

Wayyyy too much cheese for me!  The flavor was great but I used much less shredded cheese. I doubled the recipe but left the shredded cheddar at 2 cups. Also subbed onion powder for actual onion so my kids would eat it.  Would definitely make again!

Overall, pretty good. The onion and dry mustard add a nice dimension to it.

The only modification I made was that I used "Mac & cheese blend" shredded cheese in place of the shredded cheddar.  It's a blend of cheddar, American and Swiss cheeses and I found it at Food Lion.  My 60 year old father said it was the best Mac & cheese he'd ever had in his life.

This was a hit at out tday party!  We had around 18 people so I tripled the recipe (and added a bit more pasta bc it was very cheesy) and it was way too much.  Just gonna double it next time but was so easy.  I also mixed Panko crumbs with some melted butter and sprinkled that on top when I baked it.

My family loved this recipe but it dried out a bit in the oven. It was perfect if you just mix the cheese mixture and the noodles together and eat it just like that. We tend to like our Mac and cheese creamer. I also substituted the cheddar cheese for Mac and cheese blend shredded cheese. My daughter said it was better than Cracker Barrel!

This recape has become a staple for holidays - my family goes crazy over it. A few changes I make: add mushrooms! (We love them), add cayenne and paprika for heat. This is definitely the best mac & cheese ever!!!

Made the sauce for 24 servings (without the onions), using 3 X 16 oz. boxes small penne pasta. So I made half the sauce for the amount of pasta. Forgot to grease both my 13X9X3 pans, but they still cleaned easily. My larger batch of cheese sauce required a LARGE saucepan, which filled 3/4 full (8 cups of milk and 32 oz. of processed cheese) before I even added the shredded cheddar cheese. No problem; with the pasta already in my baking pans I added shredded cheese directly to pasta and hand mixed. I then poured the milk/cheese sauce over the pasta. I folded the pasta to ensure good coating of the pasta. I covered the pans with foil and baked as directed.  Both batches of mac and cheese came out moist and smooth. Served it to a church youth group of 25, with no leftovers! Gonna make this one again for my family, but I'll jazz it up even more with sharp cheddar and maybe some hot sauce.

Made it as posted- no changes. Very good. Thought my daughter (age 6) would especially enjoy it but she didn't like the taste. I think it has more of a restaurant taste to it, and although she does like some take out versions, she's just as happy with Kraft. I may try again and change the cheeses but I am glad I made it first to know where to go from here.

As a college student, I can really appreciate a good Mac & cheese. I've tried two other recipes before finding this one and I think I'll stick to this one for a while. I was kind of skeptical about adding the onion- but I really like the flavor it gives (I'm not really sure why I was skeptical because I actually love cooking with onion). For those who don't like the onion taste but do want some flavor, I would just suggest ultra finely chopping a smaller amount of onion so it's not as powerful a taste.  Overall I really like this recipe, so thank you.

Great find ! I always have trouble with the right cheese consistency when it comes to baked mac and cheese. This was defiantly easy to make. I made this for my family for dinner. It was pretty good. I added a little bit more milk and cheese to make it more creamy. I also added bread crumbs and diced tomato's. It was very filling. I will make this again :)

Good hot out of oven, but cheese slices made it too pasty once it cooled down. I want to try to sub cheddar soup for the cheese slices next time.

Followed recipe almost as written, loved it.  Very creamy.  I used 1 cup of milk and 1 cup half & half, it turned out great!!  Will definatly make this again.  My husband is not a fan of mac and cheese and he liked it and even took some leftovers to work today.

Teenager Approved! My two picky teenagers loved it and went back for seconds. Very easy to make. One review said it tasted like onions but if they are chopped fine and sautéed it will not taste like onions. We even cooked up some bacon and crumbled that over the top. Next time I may add some ground beef.

I'm giving it 5 stars. I deliberately left out the velveta(I hate it).I used all sharp cheddar and doubled the recipe. Awesome. You want the pasta to be kinda swimming in the cheese sauce before baking. This one does! If not, you get dried out mac and cheese... YUCK!

I've used this recipe so many times that I've lost count. I've never gotten complaints that it's dry. Seems to me that could be remedied by adding more milk so that it suits your tastes better. It could also be the quality of the cheese that made it dry for some. Or try baking it for less time. My daughter has been known to eat some of it before it even bakes. Also , if you're used to "fake" make & cheese, this may not be creamy enough for you. 
Sometimes I vary the recipe by using other cheeses such as mozzarella, pepper jack, or whatever I have on hand instead of the American cheese.
Overall, this is my family's favorite Mac & cheese recipe.

I made this for a Fourth of July picnic.  I left out the onion for my picky teenaged eater, and would not suggest using a breadcrumb topping because it dries the recipe out slightly.  Good cafeteria-style mac and cheese that's slightly less creamy.  I would also suggest doubling the macaroni to stretch out this recipe without sacrificing any quality- this is a TON of cheese!  Great comfort food.

I really liked this, and it was really easy.  I wanted it really creamy, so I used mozzarella in place of American cheese, and substitutes 1/2 cup heavy cream for 1/2 cup of the milk.
Very delicious, but felt it still needed "something".  Like a little heat or spice.  I'm not sure what I'd use...a tabasco-type product, a diced jalapeño, or chili flakes / powder.
I'd LOVE a recommendation from a member!!

This was AMAZING. I took photos of my phone but idk how to add them here. I made modifications of course.... No onions, I used cabots extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of just sharp, and for the American cheese I used kraft singles. I baked for about 22 min, that's when it started to bubble. The bread crumbs are great and add a lot of extra flavor/kick to it, so I recommend using bread crumbs. Since I only baked 22 min, the bread crumbs were still fine and not burnt when I took it out and the cheese was creamy not dry. I made homemade once before, stovetop, and hated it, but this was the first one that really tastes homemade

Very good recipe! I did use more noodles - probably about 11oz, and it was still plenty cheesy and rich.  The velveeta gave it a nice creaminess but didn't overpower the sharp cheddar (I used craft extra sharp - probably about 3/4 of the block. I will not hesitate to make this again!

I did this as a double batch for a church dinner.  I doubled everything but only 1 1/2 the cheese and it was so creamy.  I didn't use the onions or the topping because it was intended for children, but I would like to try the onion next.  I didn't find a review that talked about making the night before so I did put it all together and add to a casserole and refrigerated.  I set out 2 hrs prior to baking (to get close to room temperature) and it warmed up nice and bubbly in 1 hr 15 at 350.  I did leave it covered in foil to warm it.  I used Velveeta and Kraft block of sharp cheddar .  Definitely book marked for the next time.  I agree with other reviewers no baking is even necessary - I could have served it right off the stove top

This recipe was delicious and simple to make. I did not add the onions or the dry mustard and it came out perfect.

We made no changes to the recipe. Although I would suggest using white pepper as the black pepper left small black spots in the cheese. The onions gave it a good flavor, don't leave them out!

My family loved it. I thought it was bland and tasted floury, but I did put some Sriracha sauce in it, and next time will add more. I also put crushed Ritz crackers with melted margarine on top. Next time will dust with parsley and paprika on top. I would expect this to be fabulous for the calorie trade-off.

I followed the recipe as is and it was an absolute hit with my whole family :) My kids couldn't tell the onion was in the recipe..it added a nice flavor to it.  I was pleasantly surprised and very easy to follow.  I made another batch for tomorrow's Easter brunch and can't wait to share it with my friends.  It'll definitely be hard to go back to boxed mac and cheese after this recipe..thanks!

This is a great recipe and i usually make it about once a month at the least. Its really not to fattening, and sometimes i cut up the 97 % fat free Hebrew National hot dogs in it ( at 45 calories a piece) and its like having a very fattening, indulgent comfort meal without blowing your whole day on calories.

Delicious. Followed the recipe with the exception of the onion. I don't think onion belongs in mac and cheese. Will make often.

This is the best macaroni ever, although I did as suggested and left the onion out, using onion salt in place of regular salt.  I also did not bake it the first time I made it, but the second time I did, as I made it early for a family dinner and reheated in the oven.  I didn't have any problems with it drying out during baking, but I don't think I baked it as long as the recipe said.

I made this Mac & Cheese and it is the bestest (the words of a 10 year old). My son said it was great and I should make it this way all the time. This was moist and cheesy and just fabulous! I even shared the receipe with another lady in the office.

If you are looking for a lactose free or vegan friendly version I recommend the following changes:
1 lbs package of elbow macaroni
1 block (7.1 oz) of Daiya Cheddar, cut into strips
1 cup of Daiya Mozzarella, shredded

I subtracted the onion and added breadcrumbs to the top before baking.  Otherwise I followed the instructions as listed above and it was amazing.  

Being lactose intolerant has made it really hard to have the comfort foods I grew up with, but those little tweaks this recipe was perfect!  One problem with cheese substitutes is that the artificial cheese flavor it much too strong.  By using slightly less and cutting the cheddar with the mozzarella it was like eating REAL mac and cheese!  This is going to be a staple food in my household from now on.

I was told about this recipe by a coworker and I thought "how special can this be? It's only mac n cheese". Well it's amazing. We love it.  It's so versatile,  we can add just about anything to it and it's always good.  Thank you for such a great recipe!

This is a great recipe!!! I use small shells or a fun small sized pasta. Also, to jazz it up a bit, I add a bag of mixed frozen veggies (blend or peas and carrots) and a 1/2 lb of deli ham - cut up, when mixing in the cheese sauce. It turns out beautifully and makes it a "meal" vs a hearty side.

I made this just the other day. I didn't use the whole amount of American cheese, because American cheese is pretty expensive; I used some Mozzerella cheese instead. Before I stuck it in the oven, I stuck some bread crumbs on top, and put the timer on for 30 minutes, like the recipe said. I took it out after 25 min. because if I had left it longer, it would have burned. It was actually pretty tasty, and the sauce was nice and creamy. My complaint is that it took me about an hour to prepare it, and then 25 min. in the oven. That's too long for me. It really wasn't all that much better than certain boxed kinds which only take me about 15 min. to prepare. I probably will be sticking to boxed kinds mostly, or switching to an easier, and faster, recipe.

This is very easy to make and tastes delicious.  I followed the recipe except instead of American Cheese, I used processed Velveeta.  I did not find it to be dry at all.  Everyone in the family loves it and I will absolutely make this again.

This was really good.  It's the first time that I made mac and cheese that it didn't separate.  I added a 1/4 tsp of cayenne for a kick and doubled the sauce.  I served it with ham. I think next time I will cube the ham and add it right in to the dish.  I added it to my recipe box!

Love this recipe. Few adjustments: add a teaspoon of real mustard and a dash or two of Worcester sauce. Top with bread crumbs and melted butter and broil tull browned instead of baking.

This is the best Mac and Cheese!!! I made it for my family this Christmas and it was the first and only dish to be completely gone by the end of the day - no leftovers!! I followed the advice of another reviewer bc I needed to double the recipe. I doubled the butter, milk, pasta, and used an entire pkg of triple cheddar shredded cheese and left the rest as stated in the original. I also topped the Mac and cheese with about 2 more cups (1 pkg) of shredded sharp cheese about 15 minutes into the baking process. DELICIOUS!!!!!

This converted to gluten free very easily - with gluten free pasta. However, I added an additional 8 ounces of shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese (for a total of 1.5 pounds of cheese) and the dish was empty at the end of our meal. Wonderful. I will make this again.

I agree best mac n' cheese recipe EVER!  Would love to try other cheeses as suggested in other reviews.  Made ahead for Thanksgiving and will cook on T-day using suggestion to cover first half of baking.  Planning on making more and freezing for arrival of baby dinners.

The cheese sauce was delicious.  We omitted the onions and added breadcrumbs on top.  It probably doesn't need to bake for 30 minutes because it was just a little dry on top.  25 minutes would be perfect, though.

WOW!! Full disclaimer, I don't really even like mac n cheese, but my hubby wanted something for football night with the boys, so I made this. HOLY WOW. Only thing I changed was to switch out the American for an Italian blend. And I added one clove of garlic. YUM!!! Would be sooooooo good with a little chives and bacon on top. Pretty easy to make, also. THANks!

The first time I made this, it was pretty good. I tried to follow the recipe as much as possible, but didn't have sharp cheddar, so I used medium cheddar and Rotini pasta. I sprinkled more cheese on top before baking it, and Panko breadcrumbs mixed with butter and some garlic salt. The second time I made it (tonight), I used the 1 cup of sharp cheddar. I also chopped some garlic along with the onion for the sautéing part. After pouring the cheese sauce and that pasta in the pan, I mixed some more cheese in, and topped it with more cheese and Panko. It turned out great!!!

This macaroni and cheese was just all right. The flavor was actually good but it was weirdly grainy.  My sister and I didn't mind it, but our mom and bro commented that it was repulsive. We followed the recipe exactly. We made 1-1/2 times the amt., but the bake time was the same - 30 mins. I think there are many mac and cheese dishes that would be more satisfying and not grainy. I doubt I make this again; my sister said the same thing.

Made it exactly as directions then added seasoned bread crumbs and croutons to top for baking. So good everyone loved it! I think I will use cornstarch instead of flour next time :)

I was disappointed! I followed the directions but the sauce had a grainy texture after I baked it. Lucky for me, my husband is not picky and ate it anyway. What did I do wrong??

The flavor is fantastic,  but I didn't think the texture was all that great. The cheese sauce wasn't as smooth as I like.  I think I need to try it a few more times to get it down, but the flavor is definitely there!

I made this two days in a row and it was wonderful! A must keep.  I just added a few fresh Mozzarella balls as well as added additional to the amount of cheeses that was needed and just a little bit of extra milk.

This is a really well put together recipe (and there were too many to choose from!)) and the ingredients sounded yummy. I tried it out and it turned out delicious! But I did make a few changes: added in 3-4 cloves of crushed garlic to the onion when I sautéed it; used half portions of sharp cheddar & gouda cheese. Grated box of kraft cheese rather than cut the strips AND mixed parmesan cheese with the panko topping. It was all good - 4 types of cheese!

I'm not a Mac n' Cheese fan at all, but one of my good friends absolutely loves it. I'd never made homemade mac n' cheese before, but thought I'd give this a try at a dinner party I was throwing where I invited said friend. 

It was extremely easy to make and my friend absolutely loved it! I will definitely be making this again for any mac n' cheese loving friends and family!

Yum!!! Before baking, my husband thought the onion taste was a little too prevalent but after topping with more cheese and baking, it was perfect!  It tastes very familiar, perhaps something I've had at a restaurant.  Made exactly as directed and will definitely be making again!

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!!  I have been searching for a Mac in cheese recipe that was flavorful and easy to make and this recipe was perfect.  My son is a picky eater and he devours it (onions and all).  I did make one small adjustment...I sprinkled sharp cheddar cheese on the top before baking in the oven.

We've made this in the past. We are gluten free, so we make the changes we need and it's just great! Only thing I add differently is mozzarella cheese (about a cup) as well as cheddar.

While I do wish that this recipe didn't use fake cheese, it didn't have the grainy texture that a lot of recipes without the fake stuff have and it stayed pretty creamy.  I used the triple cheddar with Philadelphia cream cheese added to it as well as Velveeta for the singles.  I did try to use other combinations of brands but the results weren't nearly as good as with the aforementioned cheeses.  Quadrupled the recipe the other night for a party and people scraped the last little bits out of the pan and many asked for the recipe.

Seriously delicious! I always adjust things, I used garlic as well as onion, heavier on the dry mustard and added a touch of heavy cream.

Great recipe but since I have made it a few times I have to just give it 4 stars because I had to tweaked it. I leave out the onions altogether now. I have tried many different cheeses and have discovered that this really needs American cheese in it to be creamy especially when eating it the next day. The combo of cheeses that I like the beast so far is 1 cup each of Monterey Jack, Mozzarella, American and Cheddar.

First, I really shouldn't be reviewing this because I didn't follow all the instructions, but if anybody out there is like me, they might want to know what happens if they change it like I did. 1) I don't have processed cheese, so I used all regular cheddar. It didn't melt perfectly smooth all the way, but it was tolerables. 2) My cousin didn't want onions in it, so I put in a tablespoon of onion powder in. One problem: I PUT IT IN WITH THE ROUX MIXTURE. I should have thought it through and realized that the onion powder would REALLY affect the consistency of the roux, but I didn't. The recipe says put onion in with the butter, I put onion powder in with the butter. BAD IDEA. It tasted fine, but if you do onion powder DON'T DON'T PUT IT IN WITH THE ROUX! 3) I thought it looked like the recipe would have too much cheese sauce (I prefer a bit more noodle with my sauce), so I upped it to 12oz. It probably would have been better with 8oz, but 12 was fine. So now for the overall recipe: It was pretty bland. Quite a few people really liked it (someone said she doesn't even like Mac 'n' Cheese, but she really liked this recipe), but I didn't really like it. It needed something, so even though this is like the 5th recipe for Mac 'n' Cheese I've tried, I will keep searching. Thank anyway GEPETTO!

Love, love, love this recipe.  I have been looking for a good baked macaroni and cheese recipe.  The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a T.  It turned out wonderful.  The family loved it.  I made it again and decided to customize it for our family July 4th celebration.  I used colby/jack instead of cheddar.  Then I made a crunch crust for the top with panko, bacon crumble and Parmesan.  Thanks for this basic mac and cheese recipe.

First I have to say that I believe the amount of macaroni is incorrect. It should be a pound of pasta instead of one half. Trying to stay true to the recipe, I added 8oz, as written, and the pasta was swimming in the cheese sauce..I added the rest of the box and it was better. It had a nice flavor but, as other reviewers have stated, it was a bit on the dry side. All in all a good, basic no frills dish. Not sure yet whether I would serve this to guests or not.

2013: Fantastic!!! perfect just as it is! 5-star review before I added chopped steamed broccoli and a layer of shredded cheese on top, to add some cheesy greens for the kids. They were able to dig through to the yummy goodness beneath, but I feel ok that they still were able to eat something that had green on it!! Thank you for the solid  recipe!!

2018: Just made this again to accompany the ham and other goodness for Easter. We had a potluck at my house, and the other menu items were roasted brussell sprouts, and roasted potatoes with onions. This recipe was my contribution. I adjusted the ingredients to serve 16 (used a large 15x10 casserole), and this time the ONLY thing I added was crushed ritz crackers to the top. It's nice because I can make this ahead and then do the final "heat until bubbly" when the guests arrive (or whenever). People were still helping themselves to it even at room temperature. Scene stealer, once again.  :)
**note: both times I subbed dried minced onion for the fresh onions because my son likes the flavor, but not texture, of fresh onions.

Made this a couple of weeks ago for my husband who is a mac and cheese fanatic, he said it is the best he has ever had. I did make a couple of substitutions though, used goat milk cheddar and goat cheese(soft). So guess what he wants me to make tonight.....

Made half this recipe to try it out for a party I'm having w/ a mac n' cheese bar.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I was surprised how delicious this turned out to be!  It has such a nice flavor and texture - it's not too stiff.  I think the onions really makes the flavor so wonderful.  The only thing that was weird was that mine had a filmy crust on top of that was not so attractive.  Wonder if I did something wrong or if there's something I can do to change that.

This is the same recipe my mom used to use.  Feel free to experiment with different cheeses.  We always had macaroni and cheese on New Year's Day, using up whatever cheese was leftover from the holiday appetizers and cheese tray gifts.  It was different every year, but always wonderful.  Thanks for providing the recipe!!

I made this this afternoon for Christmas dinner and I'm certainly pleased with how it came out. I was a little liberal with the ingredients and ended up using almond milk, but it still turned out really well. Like some people suggested, I used bread crumbs on the top of one of them and I think I preferred how that one came out.

Great recipe!

I've used this recipe every time I cook mac & cheese.  The only thing I don't add is the onion and the dry mustard.  EVERYONE loves it!  The sharper the cheese the better but I like the idea of adding the cheddar slices.  I may try cheese variations soon.

I love this recipe. I've been making it for years, and the only change I make is to double it, and use just Velveeta cheese. It's so gooey and warm and great for winter!!!

Very good.  This was very easy to make and tasted great.  I did not include the onions (due to personal preference) nor the dried mustard (didn't have any on hand) and it still tasted great.  I also added a topping using a mixture of crushed Ritz crackers and butter.   This was very creamy and not dry like some of the other baked mac and cheese recipes I have tried.

I made it exactly as listed, and I need to stress that 8 oz. or 1 dry measure cup of macaroni is not enough. Follow as written, but add 2 cups of macaroni, not just one. Thanks! Update-Use a pound box of elbow macaroni, or other type of tubular pasta. I omitted the onions and used 1/2 tsp mustard powder. Use 1 c sharp cheddar, 1 cup gruyere, and 4 oz processed cheese. That is the ideal blend!

I made this tonight as a last minute Thanksgiving side dish. Everyone LOVED it!!!  I omitted the onions, just because I didn't have any on hand and being pressed for time, I took the advice of another reviewer and only kept it in the oven for about 15 minutes rather then 30 and it was delicious!!! 
I doubled the recipe, as it was going to be a large crowd, and everyone came back for seconds and thirds ~ even the kids!!
I will make this again and again.  Thanks so much for sharing.

It was great!  Made the following changes, mostly based on other's advice: 1. Omitted the onion. 2. topped with Parmasean Cheese & Italian Breadcrumbs, covered with alumnium foil for the first 20 minutes. I also used 10 slices of Kraft Singles (for the processed american cheese). Yummy.

This turned out to be very creamy....very good.  I didn't have American processed cheese, so I used Canadian processed cheese.  I also added a bit of parmesan cheese in the sauce and everyone loved it.

Yum!  My family's favorite, too.  I always use velveeta for the american cheese.  I use whatever I have on hand for the others, and its always good.  Our favorite is probably a mixture of sharp and 4- cheese mexican blend cheese.  Try adding a package of crumbled real bacon and it sets it over the edge!

I changed the recipe a bit so not sure if I should rate it, but it was delicious! I used mostly heavy cream and a little milk, about a cup of velveeta (it was what I had left), a cup of blue cheese, left out the salt, and added about a 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder. Topped it with some extra grated sharp cheddar then baked. YUM! Thanks for this recipe!

This is how I've always made my macaroni and cheese except for the onion. Tried it with it for a change and nobody really cared for it. I'll keep making it without the onion. It's also very good with a thin layer of cheese on top to get brown. My kids and now my grandkids fight over the brown part along with my hubby.

It really did remind me of my mom's.  Good taste, the American cheese was a nice addition.  I think my mom used to add a dash or two of paprika, which I did.  I stirred it a couple of times while cooking and it was terrific.  Would definately make again.

It's a favorite.  I make it a little differently.  For a topping I use Frenches French Fried Onions, and I use Dijon mustard instead of dried mustard.  It is even better using cauliflower instead of macaroni. And it is vegetarian!

Substituted old cheddar for American processed cheese. The Mac and Cheese was delicious, but was missing the creaminess.

I made this last night for my nephew's birthday and it was delicious!  I used a combination of shredded mozzarella and shredded cheddar cheese.  I also put some more shredded cheese on top with some italian breadcrumbs before baking it in the oven.  Also, I added some cayenne pepper to the cheese mixture for a little kick but it didn't overpower it at all.  Just added a nice touch.  I will definitely be making this again.  So easy and delicious!!

Really good!  I have a 29 year old Son who will only eat the Mac and Cheese out of the blue box and he liked this!!  I did not add the onions, but put in 1/2 tsp of onion powder, tsp of garlic powder, a couple dashes of Tabasco, and doubled the ground mustard.

Tasty and EASY!!! I did veto the onion as others recommended and, at the end, I added bread crumbs to the top and broiled it for about 3 minutes to give it a nice crust. For the processed cheese, I used Velveeta. I would say this is a good recipe if you don't have a lot of time and/or can't afford a lot of ingredients. It's not the best baked mac and cheese i've tried making but it is the easiest and that's why i'll be making it again :o)

I didnt add onions- used 2 garlic gloves instead and also cut out the mustard.   I made two 9x13 trays. used 1 bag Elbow Mac #35- per tray. It came out delicious.

Guess I'm a late comer to this recipie judging from the other comment dates, oh well better late than never! Altered it a bit...omitted onion (too strong...onion in mac n cheese....what!?) Used 8 oz. extra sharp NY Cheddar and 8 oz. Gruyere (no processed junk food "american cheese" in my kitchen,lol) and topped with plain bread crumbs. Served with ham steak and green beans with butter, salt n pepper. Sooooo delish, wow! Gruyere gives it that gooey, almost stringy texture while the extra sharp Cheddar gives it the "bite". Sadly, there were no leftovers...I'll double it next time!  This one gets a permanent entry in my recipie file. 2 yums up!

I am not a big mac and cheese fan, but my entire family is so I am constantly on the lookout for the "perfect recipe." This was actually the first homemade mac and cheese recipe I tried out, and after atleast 10 other recipes, this is still the favorite of the fam!! It's a pretty easy recipe, with ingredients I usually have on hand. I sometimes cut down the cheese a bit (depending on who's eating), because it is super cheesy (my hubby loves this recipe as is, my kids tend to eat more when I cut down the cheese). Anyway, I've also cut out the roux mixture when I've gotten lazy, and just added cornstarch to the milk instead. Both ways are great and no one notices! The mustard I think, is fantastic in the recipe, it reallly makes the dish! My fam is also not big on crumb topping, so this is a keeper for us! Excellent mac and cheese recipe, thanks!

I made this for a dinner party of 10 people and it was outstanding. I doubled the recipe & had plenty for leftovers (just because it made so much). My husband & I have been devouring the rest and I was asked to bring it again to the next dinner party.

This recipe was very good. I doubled the amount of macaroni and put some crushed crackers on top. Next time I will try something more adventurous to go with the cheddar than the american cheese.

Delicious!  Very thick and creamy sauce.  I thought the onion added a nice, subtle, almost smoky flavor.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful and cheesy.  I used perhaps 1/2 c of onion, and a block of cheddar in place of the American cheese.  I also only had soy milk, which I was worried about, but the pasta remained cheesy and delicious.  It was fairly simple to make.

This recipe was absolutely delicious.  I used a whole 16 ounce box of macaroni, because my kids don't like a lot of sauce.  It turned out great, and my kids are already requesting this recipe again.  Thank you.

Thanks for sharing a great recipe! I was worried about it drying out so I doubled the sauce and it came out creamy! Didn't have to cover it while baking! I made this for a crowd and there was very little left. This is a keeper! I did sub onion powder for the onion and tossed in some garlic salt.

I'm not giving five stars because I changed it up a little. Instead of American cheese, I used feta. This is a great recipe though, doesn't get dry or anything.

This Mac and cheese is an amazing recipe! My Fiance and I absolutely loved it. We aren't big left-over people, but with this recipe, we couldn't wait to eat the rest. The only thing I did different was add crumbled Ritz crackers over the top.

We think this macaroni and cheese is awesome! We did add more milk to the cheese sauce to make it creamier. Personally we think the onions are a great addition. Even our dogs were still begging for it after it was gone! This is a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

I've been searching for a good mac and cheese recipe too.  This is it!  Creamy and delicious. I omitted the onion, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Used extra sharp cheese and sliced American cheese. Nice balance. It outshined the Christmas ham! You must try it.

I absolutely loved this recipe! The only reason i dont make it as often as i would like is because it is a little time consuming after getting home from work. instead of sliced packaged american i went to the deli and bought some other yellow cheese (not a fan of processed cheese) since i couldnt find white cheddar, as other reviews suggested. it came out great and the i think that it may have even tasted better leftover!

A good starter recipe. The American Cheese helps mellow out the sharp Cheddar.  I have made this a couple times and its a great easy recipe when you have a bunch of extra cheese that you need to use.

My family really liked this recipe...had to double it though.  It was very creamy and had a great flavor. I used velveeta for the american cheese and left out the onions for my daughter. I will make it again!!

This is very good stuff. I used half creme and half milk and added a bit of cayenne for spice. DH loved this and so did I!!

I followed the recipe exactly, other than using some mexican blend of shredded cheese instead of just cheddar.  I didn't even notice the onion.  This recipe is VERY good the first time around, but after two nights of leftovers, I might of over-dosed, cause now the thought of it makes me sick.  It is very rich and very heavy.  I would make again for a pot luck, otherwise, will only be a once in a great while dish in which I will only make a small portion so that I don't have the leftovers and don't OD again.  I still give it 4 stars, cause like I said.. first time around, it was very good!

Good, but not great. I omitted the onions and added breadcrumbs on top. It still needed 'something,' maybe some cayenne and paprika. I'll keep looking for the perfect macaroni and cheese!

Wasn't as creamy as we are used to but it did have a nice flavor. I did cover the top with extra shredded cheese we always like the cooked cheese on top.

This was wonderful!  Even my DH who is picky about his mac and cheese loved it.  Doubled the recipe, omitted the onions used Velveeta instead of slided american.  Covered for  half then added crushed Ritz crackers and left uncovered for the remainder.  Will definately make again!

This was deeelicious!! I did happen to get MUCH more cheese than noodles, but I just addded more noodles so it wasn't TOO cheesy. May not be healthy, but it's a wonderful way to splurge!

Great and easy!  Only lacks one star because I have had better mac n cheese but it is way harder to make so this one gets used way more often! I don't add the onions (fussy girls) and I put Ritz crackers crumbled on top for more texture.

I don't even like mac n cheese that much.  My husband asked me to make this and I really enjoyed it too.  I have made it twice now and I still enjoy reheating the leftovers for my lunches.  Sometimes I add a little bit of fresh tomatoes over the top but it's good anyway you dish it!

DELISH!  I made this for my husband's work picnic today and it was a hit!  Everyone loved it, went back for seconds and we left with an empty bowl.  Based on some comments, I didn't add onions and I didn't bake.  It was perfectly creamy and extremely yummy.  I highly recommend this!!

This was so simple to make! I only made a couple changes - I substituted the salt with garlic salt for an extra subtle kick and then added a breadcrumb topping with a little melted butter and chopped parsley. Delicious!

i find it better to add about a cup more mik into the cheese sauce and the noodle mixture a little at a time to make sure it doesn't dry out. Also, add bread crumbs to the top of the casserole before putting it in the oven.

This is the recipe I always use for mac and cheese. To make it healthier you could add a little less cheese to the sauce and it still tastes good. I usually leave out the onion, too.

yummmm....I followed the recipe except for the processed cheese I used 1/2 can ragu cheese sauce instead.  I threw in diced ham and peas and carrots and made it a meal.  My 2 year old didnt even bother picking out the veggies and asked for it 3 days in a row!

I use recipie almost identical except that I beat an egg and mix it with the pasta after that drains.  Try adding some stewed tomatos on top before putting it in the oven.

Good not great.  To me, it seemed to lack a lot of cheese flavor.
