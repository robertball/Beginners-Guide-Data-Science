This is delicious.  I added about 1/4 - 1/2 cup chopped cilantro which made the difference from being great to incredible.  This is very easy and quite attractive.  You can use a yellow tomato to add more color.

Made this to take for my lunch at work. I only had half a can of black olives and I used a can of diced tomatoes with chile peppers because I didn't have those ingredients seperate. I didn't have tarragon vinegar so I used red wine vinegar. Great snack to keep me going at work.

I was making a mexican inspired meal and at the last minute realized I didn't have any salsa! This was an incredibly easy dip to make and quite good...instead of fresh tomatoes (I didn't have any on hand) I used a can of diced tomatoes. I also followed other reviewers ideas of adding some cilantro. It turned out great!

I recently made this salsa for a Super Bowl party that got cancelled because of ice and snow. With a whole batch to deal with, and cognizant of my recent resolution to not waste food, I've been thinking of ways to eat it all up. The usual way, with chips is/was great. However, serving it on top of baked chicken or fish has become my new favorite thing. It really brings out new flavors in everything it touches. Night before last, I grilled a large portabello cap, placed a juicy piece of baked chicken on top and added maybe a quarter cup of salsa on top of that. It was fantastic! Not only was it tasty, filling and beautiful, it was well under 400 calories. While I loved it as written, I can imagine that adding corn and black beans would also be very good and extend the number of servings. Thanks, DEBOKC!

This is an excellent salsa - I used champagne vinegar instead of tarragon and about 1/2 teas sugar as it was too sharp for my taste. I also added fresh cilantro just before serving, as others suggested.

This is really, really good but am disappointed because thought by the title that it would include roe; nothing is a caviar unless it contains roe. I'll still use this recipe though and just call it Mexican Relish.

I was excited to try this recipe after seeing the positive reviews, but was very disappointed.  There is entirely too much salt (I even cut back while I was making it).  Maybe they meant "garlic powder" and not "garlic salt"?
