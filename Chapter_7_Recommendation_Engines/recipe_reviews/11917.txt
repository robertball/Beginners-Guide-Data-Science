Christy,I tried this recipe. But by accident I bought a Dressing called Henderickson's.
It's a Sweet Vinegar & Olive Oil Dressing. It was heaven! Everyone loved it. I think the sweetness along with the Tang of Vinegar is the key. It's a Fat Free dressing. But don't let that scare any one away. You'll be very delighted. Thanks for the Great recipe.

Good stuff!  Especially on a hot summer day.  I did change the recipe a bit for my taste.  I add 16 oz of crab meat instead of 8 oz.  I also  used less cauliflower & broccoli, and opted for 3 tomatos instead of 2.  Delicious.  I too added honey to the dressing to give it a sweet and tangy punch... yummers!

I made this for a bridal shower recently, and it was a sure hit.  I didn't have any Italian dressing on hand, so I mixed in olive oil, spiced Balsmic vinegar (garlic with sun-dried tomatoes) with a hint of spicy mustard dressing.  It was really good!  The imitation crab and crunchy veggies was the best part.

The dressing over powers the flavor of the crab and 2 cups is too much. But I will make again with less dressing.

This is a great summer salad. I especially like the crab. I use Paul Newmans Balsamic Vinagar Dressing. i tried another but it just didn't give it the flavor it needed.

This was good.  But it did lack something.  I tried salt and cheese, that didn't help.  It's a good church picnic food.

Agreed it just needs a little more umph.  Added some sea salt and that helped bring out the flavor.  Hmmmm....

Three demerits for not using real crab meat. Almost took off another one for using bottled salad dressing. Make your own from scratch - it's worth it!

This did not have enough crab for my clan. I don't think I will make it again. It just didn't suit us. But thanks for the recipe. I'll keep looking for that crab salad, recipe.

Very tasty and quite different!  Try using either low-fat or Fat-free salad dressing.  Results are pretty good as well.

Good recipe, but will use less dressing next time.  The salad tasted better the next day.

Used fresh crabmeat from the crabs I caught at the Golden Gate Bridge yesterday and was looking for a nice salad to put them in. This recipe, hmm, it's edible and doesn't have a BAD taste, but like the other reviewer said, it's kinda bland.  I added some seasonings, but it's just missing some "kick" or something, I can't figure out what it is that's missing. Something. But I'd definitely use the recipe again and maybe try doctoring it up to find that "oomph" that I'm looking for.

I have now made this twice as an entree. It is great!  Very quick and easy, the favor is amazing. We live in a very hot climate and this is the perfect summer dinner salad.

I like the idea of this salad, but I'm so happy I looked at another review that said the balsamic dressing overpowered a bit.  I stopped at one cup of balsamic, and the delicate taste of the crab was totally gone.  The salad is in the fridge, now, and I will sample it again, later.  I suspect I will add some mayo before serving it for dinner.  Other than less dressing, the only thing I did differently was to blanch the broccoli and the cauliflower briefly.  (This brings up the color of the broccoli and takes the edge off of the raw--personal preference.)
