This was wonderful!! Though, I did change it quite a bit. From reading everyone's thoughts I decided not to cut the chicken and instead I spiced it with onion powder, garlic all-spice and rosemary. I then seared the chicken to a nice crisp brown. (This added a wonderful presentation--no more goopy mess!!) I also added some chicken broth with the rice and soup BEFORE I added the chicken. I let that set on high for about 15 min. while I cooked the chicken. Then 3 hours later (on high) I took the chicken out and served the sauce over fresh-baked biscuts. I will make this again. Wonderful with a glass of cold white wine. Wonderful!!!

I made this recipe and it turned out great!  Big hit with my daughter who doesn't like mushrooms (and I didn't tell).  I substituted a can of water for the cream of celery soup and it was great.  One hint, don't just throw it all in the cooker, mix the soup with the rice, otherwise rice can be a little under done.  Will definately make over and over again.

The first time I made this I used regular long grain rice, and while the rice was still a bit hard, everything else about it was delicious. So I tried again with Minute rice and it came out perfect. Easy, delicious, I've made it many times and will again and again!

Here's how my family has always done it: can of cream of chicken, can of cream of mushroom, packet of dry onion soup mix, 2 cups of water, 1 cup of rice, 4 boneless breasts cut into strips, salt and pepper to taste. Mix the soups, water, and rice in the crock pot. Salt and pepper the chicken, then brown it in a little oil. Put the chicken in the crock pot; cook on low 4-5 hours. Serve with a fresh garden salad for a great keep the house cool summer meal.

I used regular rice (not instant or minute) and uncooked chicken.  The dish needed a kick, so I added 3/4 cup of white wine to the crockpot, along with some mushrooms, celery and onion.  The final dish was GREAT!

It was good, but explain about the rice. The rice came out hard. Should it be cooked first, then added to the other ingredients?

Changed this a little the second time I made it and with these changes, WOW! I had a HIT!   Here it is:  I used 4-5 frozen chicken breasts.  In your crock pot, mix 2 (10 3/4 ounce) cans of Campbell's Cream of Chicken and 2 (10 3/4 ounce) Campbell's Cream of Mushroom soup with 1 cup of uncooked white rice (DO NOT USE MINUTE RICE OR FAST COOKING RICE). I omitted the celery soup and added 1 can of  water.  I added 1/2 tsp of celery seed, 1 tsp of dried parsley, 1/2 tsp of black pepper and 3/4 pkg of Lipton Onion Soup Mix (DO NOT ADD SALT).  Stir everything really well.  I then placed the frozen breasts in (DO NOT CHOP THESE, JUST PLACE THEM IN WHOLE).  Cover the breasts with the soup.  Put the lid on the pot and you're good to go.  I cooked it for 4-5 hours on HIGH.  I stirred the meal after about 4 hours and turned to LOW until everyone got home (about another hour).  Would have given it a 5, but the first time I made it, it wasn't as good as I had hoped (followed the original recipe exactly).  But the author was on to something good.  The slow cooker is the way to go when you're at work and the clean up, WHEW!  Easy.

Love this recipe! I added a cup of water and a package of frozen brocolli. Also added some garlic, some cajun seasoning, an onion and salt and pepper. My rice cooked well although the cooking time was increased to five hours on high because of the frozen brocolli that I added. Really yummy! Thanks for a great recipe!

I thought it was good.  I added 1/2 cup of water, garlic salt and 2 chicken bouillon cubes (and pepper) since I had read reviews that this was bland.  My rice tasted fine, I didn't notice it to be mushy, I cooked mine for 3 hours on high.  Will cook it again sometime!

This dish was very good. I added about 1/2 c. milk because I was afraid it would be dry, it wasn't. I also cut up my chicken breasts. The family loved it!

I have made this before but adding a pkg. of onion soup mix (the kind you make dip with) really gives the rice more flavor.  I  make my own onion soup mix, which cuts down on the sodium.  My onion soup mix:  4 tsp. instant beef bouillon (use low or no salt variety if you like); 8 tsp. dried minced or chopped onion;1 tsp. onion powder; 1/4 tsp. bon appetit seasoning (or seasoned salt). Mix and use in recipe or seal in foil packet.  Use within 6 months.

Never again.  Easy to make but not worth it unless you like eating hard rice.

I'm giving this recipe five stars because I've played around with it to suit my own tastes.  I do believe it would have been a bit bland without additional seasonings.  I added fresh sliced mushrooms and celery as well as some garlic powder, onion powder, poultry seasoning, dash of pepper, and salt.  I stirred all of this in it with the rice/soup mixture and then placed chicken drumsticks on top, seasoned with salt, pepper, and paprika.  I cooked on high for about 3-4 hours and everything turned out wonderful!  The rice was VERY creamy and the chicken fell right off the bone!  You could almost turn this into a stew with more veggies added to it!

I made this today with chicken thighs. I mixed the three soups in a bowl and added one packet of dry onion soup mix like another member suggested.  (I even used the 98% fat free canned soups).  I also used a crock pot liner and spooned a little of the mixture on the bottom of the crockpot first before adding the thighs. Then I added the uncooked rice to the rest of the soup mix and mixed it all together and poured it all over the thighs in the crockpot.  I cooked it on low for 12 hours and it was amazing!   I will make this again and again. The chicken was so tender and juicy and the rice came out almost the consistency of a risotto.

While I love this recipe it should really be done in the oven. In the crockpot some rice was hard and some was mushy, I had to keep adding water.  and the rice just seemed to absorb all the soup.  Here's how I have done this recipe for years.  In a 9x13 pan layer the following in this order, 2 cups rice, 4 cups water, enough chicken to cover, mix the three soups together and spread over chicken.  bake at 350 for 1 hour or until rice in the center is fully cooked.  I like lemon juice drizzled over my portion.

I normally don't change the recipe the first time I make something but I was in such a hurry I had to use what I had. Instead of breasts, I used breasts and thighs. I also don't keep white rice in the house, so I used instant brown rice. Since I used house brand soups that I've had experience with so I know they're bland I seasoned up the chicken with some seasoning salt and threw in some minced garlic. I didn't like one reviewer suggested and mixed the rice and soups together and also this cooked for 5 almost six hours on level 2 of my Westbend slow cooker and came out PERFECTLY. This was so so so good and I'll probably make it so many more times.

I made this, but added a cup of water, a pkg of frozen veggies and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Even my 2 year old loved it! I used regular white rice, and mixed it all together before letting it slow cook to ensure all the rice was covered so it would cook.

This was a great base recipe that I made a few changes to. I used 1 can cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic, 1 can cream of chicken w/herbs, 2 cups water, 1 pkg. onion soup mix and then added corn and broccoli. I also just used frozen chicken breasts and put them in on top of everything. I did put in the rice but won't next time as it didn't really add to the dish. After it was done, I shredded the chicken and then served it over egg noodles and biscuits on the side. Yummy meal for a cold night!

I tweaked this recipe a little after reading reviews from others. I used 1 can cream of chicken, 1 can cream of mushroom with garlic, 3 frozen chicken breasts(uncut), 3/4 c. white wine,1 c.white rice(Minute), 1 bag frozen veggies(carrots,broccoli & cauliflower)& season salt & pepper. I put it all in the crock pot for 4 hours on high & it was perfect. Chicken was tender & rice was cooked, not too mushy or hard. I'd definitely make this again!!!

I loved this recipe, but did a few things different. Used all low fat soups, and brown rice. Also added Lipton onion soup mix and about 1/2 cup water. I mixed the rice and soup in mixing bowl first as someone else advised, and had no problem with the rice being under cooked. I left the chicken whole. I cooked for about 5 hours, knowing that the brown rice does need a little more time.

This recipe was quick, easy, and delicious.  Rice was done to perfection, and texture was wonderful.  I added some brocolli and it turned out quite nicely.  For those who couldn't get their rice done properly, you need to learn how to cook! I had no problems, and stirred regularly.  A great dish...highly recommended.

My family likes this. I changed a few things a bit when I made it. I first put 1/2 cup water in the bottom of the crockpot. Then added 4 large chicken breasts, whole. I added the soups on top of the chicken. I turned the crockpot on to high for 6 hours. Then I cooked 1 cup brown rice on the stove 9according to the pckg directions) and when that was done I added the whole thing to the crockpot on top of the soups. About an hour before it was done I stirred it up a bit and it was all creamy and smooth. My family loved it and the rice was perfect and not hard.

While this was extremely easy to make, it tasted kind of bland and it looked disgusting.  It looked liked a pile of mush.  The rice never cooked all the way and burned on the sides of the slow cooker.  The chicken was too tender, it fell apart when trying to spoon it on to plates.

I wasn't too successful with this one.  My rice never cooked completely, even after adding more liquid and time.  I would prepare the rice and add it near the end if I made this again.

Decent but very bland. Chicken needs to be heavily seasoned or marinated. Rice was good though. I used minute rice and mixed into the soups. Turned out very creamy. Easy enough to throw together. I would definately make this again with lots of seasoning.

This recipe is great! My family just loves it. I was a little worried because it was quite thick, so I added 1 can of water and it wasn't bad at all! I reccomend subsituting the Cream of Mushroom for Broccoli Cheese soup, gives it just a little extra flavor and add some salt and pepper!!

This would have been a great recipe. It smelled so good! However, the recipe did not specify long grain or minute rice, so i used long grain. The rice never cooked, and the whole meal was ruined because of crunchy rice.

This was alright. Personally I would either increase the amount of rice and liquid in this dish or cut back on the chicken - it's just way too much chicken in comparison to rice. I don't know why everyone was saying that their rice wasn't done - Ours was almost overcooked. I followed someone's advice and decided not to cube the chicken - which was a mistake. All you end up with is a ton of shredded chicken breast which does not make an appealing meal. I would cube the chicken then brown it then add it to twice the rice called for in the recipe already cooking in the slow cooker. It also was also very bland - if it weren't for the bit of garlic and onion I added I doubt it would have had much flavor at all. I'm still on the fence over making this again or giving up on fixing this recipe.

I made this today with a few changes. I used the broccoli and cheese per someones suggestion instead of mushroom, and i added a can of milk and one of water to the mix, along with some frozen mixed veggetables.  Oh, and I also cubed the chicken to make it more of a casserole type deal as to not leave lot of leftover rice and veggies with no chiken.  Good recipe, will make again.  And don't foget the salt and pepper!!  And the rice did stick to the sides a bit, but was easily removed, and actually was away from the house for about 6 hours, and rice was a little over done, but still very tasty.

I thought this was good.  I changed the recipe around a little bit, and the chicken was tender, and the rice was perfect.  Instead of the cream of celery, I added a can of chicken broth.  I also chopped up some broccoli and added that to it. I then added half a can of water, and spiced it up with some fresh garlice, salt and pepper.  The family enjoyed it, and we will be making this again.

This is a many generation family favorite of ours.  I was thrilled to find I could make it in the slow cooker (instead of the oven).  I did discover that the rice was "crunchy" (aka - not done) but corrected it by adding 3/4 cup of water & cook for a total of 6 1/2 hrs on high.

Although it has a lot of processed products, this is pretty easy and tasty. I made a few changes per the other reviews:
Cooked the rice separately and poured the dish over the cooked rice once it was ready to serve.
Added my own veggies: carrots, onions, and celery (bc those were the ones I had on hand)
And I added a cup of milk that sorta turned it into a soup, but I think I liked it better that way.
Husband loved it...thought I was just quite the chef.

Make this WITHOUT ANY RICE!! Then serve over cooked rice or even noodles or potatoes. This wont add too much more trouble to the recipe and is much better than hard rice! Someone once told me they use  5 different cream soups and this was their families favorite crockpot recipe

Added the rice to the soup and mixed thoroughly before adding the chicken and lots of sliced fresh mushrooms.  The rice went directly from crunchy to soggy without passing through fluffy.  A problem?  Nothing that a bit of creative marketing didn't solve.   I simply called it "chicken risotto".  My wife loved it.

Excellent and easy - I used brown rice instead of white and stirred the rice in really well - the rice came out fine.  I used low sodium soup to reduce the amount of salt.  Also added some minced garlic and frozen peas for color.  My kids now eat peas - imagine that!  Second time around - used cream of potato soup instead of cream of mushroom, quinoa instead of rice, and added some rosemary with the minced garlic - even better than the first time.....

This recipe is amazing!  My roomate and I call it Chicken Goop but we like that it is all mushy.  I follow the recipe but I add one cup of chicken broth, plenty of pepper and about a tsp of garlic powder. I also don't cut up the chicken but put whole breasts that have been thawed and I use the 10 minute rice.  Adding frozen brocolli, peas and carrots makes it a full meal.  It's fully done, moist, and perfect in 3 hours!

This was very, very good. One thing I don't understand...how come people alter the recipe and then give it less than a 5-star rating? If you change it before you ever try it, your rating is not an honest one. I don't like celery, so I substituted the cream of celery with a second can of cream of chicken, used "poultry seasoning" before browning it and because it was so thick, I added chicken broth. Husband gave it a 5-star as well. Next time, I think I'm going to use the suggestion of throwing in some broccoli.

I made it more like a soup. I cut up the chicken and browned in olive oil. Added corn, carrots, celery, squish, just about anything I had in fridge. I cooked rice separate wish I had made more rice. Children loved it...

I made this recipe with a few modifications.  I used a large can of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom and a small can of cream of celery.  I also added a medium sized onion and 2 large cans of water.  My husband and kids loved this recipe & ate it for lunch the following day and dinner again after skipping a day.  Love it!

Loved it! Also used minute rice and it turned out perfect! So easy to make, and with two young boys, I just put it in the slow cooker and it's done just in time for dinner!  No more trying to juggle cooking and bathing/feeding/homework!  Recommended for all busy mums out there!

I've just bought a slow cooker and this was the first recipe I cooked in it.  We loved it - even my small daughter ate everything.  I added some chopped carrotts, potatoes and an onion to the slow cooker first and used only one can of soup with 60ml of water with some chicken oxo. For seasoning I just used salt and pepper. It was delicious. Also works with steak and an oxtail soup with beef oxo.

This is definitely a good base recipe but it is VERY bland without adding in any other ingredients. Based on the other suggestions, I pre-cooked some Minute Rice and added it about 40 minutes before serving. I added in some sliced mushrooms with the rice as well. I used only 2 cans of soup; cream of mushroom and cream of chicken and then I added in 1 can of Chicken Broth and 1 cup of milk with the chicken along with a bag of frozen peas and carrots. Salt, pepper, minced garlic, dried onions, and voila...it was good. But this receipe is definitely just a springboard for some great variations.

It smelled great while it was cooking, but when I opened the lid, it was a big, gloppy, gooey mess!  I tried some, and even after spicing it up like the other reviewers said to do, it was still bland.  The ONLY thing I think could have possibly saved this dish would be to cook the rice separately....but then everything could easily be done in a skillet or in an oven with much better results...negates the need for a crock pot.

My family loves this recipe.  Making it for second time.  Hummm no celery soup, so just added second can of mushroom with some celery soup oh had some sour cream left in fridge, added 3/4 cup of it.  Last time I made this had to add extra milk to keep it from getting too thick, those men just are never home on time.  Must have been ok, they asked for it again.

This recipe was great!!  I don't like cream of celery soup so I used 2 cans of cream of chicken and mushroom and 1 can of cream of chicken soup instead.  I also added more rice.  It doesn't look very pretty, but it sure tastes good!

Maybe I would leave out the the celery soup?? I also used instant rice because of all the reviews that regular rice didn't cook. But the instant rice was just mushy. The chicken was cooked but not flavorful for tender. Won't make it again.

pretty good- wasnt sure what to make with it- made rolls but it just looked like slop- good slop, but slop nonetheless. so I added some basic dumplings that soaked up alll the access "gravy" and it was quite thick- pretty good. used minute rice and it was just fine

This was a great dinner.........My son hates rice and even liked it!!!! I used cream of mushroom,cream of celery and cream of mushroom and onion soup....I also used half a cup of bazmati rice and 1/2 cup of wild rice. I mixed the soup and the rice in a bowl before putting in the slow cooker and added 1/2 can extra water and cooked it on high for 5 hours and the rice and chicken were cooked perfectly! I put in a can of sliced mushrooms and about 1 cup of frozen peas. I didnt have any chicken breast on hand so i used chicken thighs. I put them in frozen. I will be making this again!!!

I tried this recipe with what I had on hand: broccoli cheese soup, mushroom soup, and chicken broth. I also added 1/2 tbsp. minced garlic and a package of frozen broccoli florets in with the chicken breasts and rice, and I cooked on low for 4 1/2 hours. Not bad! I might season the chicken a little more next time than with more than just salt and pepper, but for a quick and easy meal, this worked out pretty well.

This was my first time using a slow cooker and it turned out great!  Based on other suggestions, I replaced the cream of mushroom soup with water, added 2 cloves of garlic for flavor, and threw in some frozen broccoli.  I also kept the chicken breasts whole and seasoned them with salt and pepper.  I used condensed rice and although it came out soft, I still thought it tasted very good, and the chicken was perfect.  The best part is that my fussy husband loved it!  We can't wait to eat it again.

This one is a keeper. I read the reviews and used Uncle Ben's garlic and butter rice, precooked it before adding it to the mix. I marinated the chicken in some seasoning salt and EVOO for a few hours before I cooked it. I also added a bouillon cube and a soup can's worth of water. I added salt and pepper to taste and some chopped carrots and celery. It cooked up nice and thick but not too thick and didn't taste bland. Family loved it. I plan on making this again soon, using whatever veggies I have on hand to add to the cooker. Definitely consider precooking the rice and adding more than a cup if it is precooked.

This was very good.  I used 1 can chix broth, 1 can cr. of celery, 1 can cr. of chix and 1 cup basmati rice with dried veggies. Added a bit of melted butter for flavor and pepper to taste.  Comfort food!

I agree with previous reviewers - this is definitely a base for something better.  I boiled the rice in chicken broth for about 8 minutes (or until most of the broth was soaked into the rice). I added 2 cups of water to the cooker along with all the soups.  I also pan seared the chicken breasts - first coating them with seasoned salt and thyme - in vegetable oil and 2 garlic cloves sliced into thick chunks.  Lastly, I added salt, pepper, paprika, seasoned salt, and poultry seasoning to the mixture in the cooker.  Halfway through cook time, I added some sliced carrots.  Definitely spray the cooker with Pam because the mixture will stick to the sides!  It turned out really good!

Very easy. I changed one item. Instead of rice I cut up 6 medium sized potatos and cooked for 8 hours. Served it with a french baguette. It was wonderful. Will make again and again. Wife loved it.

I'm not the greatest cook in the world so every Sunday I cook dinner, the rest of the week my husband does. Anyway, I tried this recipe this past Sunday and I thought it was ok, my rice was not cooked. The recipe does not say whether to cook the rice first or use 5 min rice or 20 minute rice. I followed the recipe to the T and I even added 3 cans of water which my soup cans said not the recipe..if it would have indicated these things my dinner would have turned out great.

It was ok.  I had to add about 1 cup of water and it was still too thick.  The flavors were ok.  I think next time I will take out one of the creamed soups and add chicken broth instead.

must cook the rice before putting it in the cooker, and the amount of soup was a bit much; maybe one or two cans instead of three? chicken takes longer to cook than stated.

I was excited to make this dish but was unfortunately very disappointed.  Because of all of the soup in it, it was very salty.  I don't know if they have those kinds of soup available with low sodium.  If they do, try that.

Very easy and tasty. I added some frozen peas to the mixture, and about 1/2 cup chicken broth as suggested by others. Tasted alot like chicken pot pie filling and I love chicken pot pie. My rice seemed to cook unevenly though, despite regular stirring. Most of the rice cooked, but the rice at the bottom of the pot was under done. Maybe it's my crock pot? I will try this again and add more veggies this time. Perhaps some carrots, celery and diced onion along with the peas.

I had to tweak this a bit based on the other reviews, and I'm glad I did - it just wasn't enough tweaking! I used one can each of cream of chicken and cream of broccoli, one can of mushrooms, a can of milk and 1/2 can of water.  I used instant rice and added it for the last hour. The consistency was a little mushy, so I think I will add the rice a little later next time. I also added salt & pepper, Accent, and garlic powder and a little thyme.  It was still kind of bland. I will try this recipe again, but will keep tweaking to improve the taste..think I will add broccoli, too.

I did half a recipe in my 1 qt slow cooker.  Cut semi-frozen boneless, skinless chicken breasts & Added 1 can each low salt cream of mushroom and low salt cream of celery. Added 1/4 cup chicken broth, about 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/4 cup chopped onion & a light sprinkle of pepper. Cooked on hi for 3.5 hrs and the rice was cooked and we had a delicious dinner for two. My only complaint is that the texture is a little pasty, but slow cooking rice makes that almost unavoidable. Oh. And do NOT forget to spray/Pam the cooker first as some of the food makes yummy crusts on the walls of the slow cooker insert.

This dish came out excellent! The only change I made was that I "pre-boiled" my rice to cook it down a little bit, then added it to the chicken/gravy mixture in the crock pot....thanks for sharing!

It was a SIMPLE, easy comfort food to make. I found it a little too salty though. After reading the reviews, I followed suit in adding my own seasoning for taste to make sure the chicken wasn't too bland. (It wasn't.) I added onion powder, pepper, and dried basil to the recipe. Also for the soup, I used 2 cans of low-sodium cream of mushroom soup. If I had been able to find the low-sodium kind for the other 2 soups, I would have gotten it too. In addition to the soup, I added about 1/4-1/2 can of water to it because it was looking pretty thick. Even after adding water it was thick enough. Overall, this recipe was good. I think I'd make it again on days I'm feeling lazy or want comfort food. I served biscuits alongside with this meal. It was a big hit with everyone who tried it. For me, it was "alright."

I made this yesterday, and it turned out well, albeit messy-looking. (But as a single mom of a preschooler, presentation is not all that important to me...) I like that it made good leftovers, and the house made the house smell wonderful.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I added a can of chicken broth, black pepper, and some garlic powder. I did find that it needed quite a bit longer to cook, though. It took almost 8 hours on low. Maybe that was because I used whole-grain brown rice instead of white, but I did find that the brown rice imparted a nice nuttiness to the flavor.

Instead of rice, I used cut up potatoes like a previous reviewer had suggested, and cooked it a little longer. I also seaoned it with some Adobo seasoning. Easy and delicious. My family loved it.

This was ok. Though, I did change it quite a bit. From reading everyone's thoughts I decided not to cut the chicken and instead I spiced it with onion powder, garlic all-spice and rosemary. I then seared the chicken to a nice crisp brown. (This added a wonderful presentation--no more goopy mess!!) I also added some chicken broth with the rice and soup BEFORE I added the chicken. I let that set on high for about 15 min. while I cooked the chicken. Just before adding the chicken I stirred the rice and soup mix really well, and set the chicken almost on top of the rice. Then 3 hours later (on high) I took the chicken out and served the sauce over fresh-baked biscuts. I will make this again, maybe playing with it a little more.

Great comfort food.  We really liked the dish.  We are going to try to add some spices next time - it could be kicked up a notch!

I turned it on low and cooked it while at work (about 8-9 hours) and it was still plenty moist.  A little thick, but not bad.  I sprayed the sides of the crock pot to keep it from burning/sticking to the side.

this needs more flavor.  it's nice and easy, but next time I will add dry onion soup mix.

The only thing I changed with the recipe was I used Broccoli Cheese soup instead of cream of chicken.  It was super easy and it fed 3 hungry men (one of which is usually very picky).  My husband couldn't believe how good it was and that was all there was to it.  Thanks!!

I tasted this about 2 hours into cooking and it was sooooo bland.  I added some rosemary, thyme, white wine, salt, pepper and curry to this.  The flavor came out great but the rice was so mushy my husband was disgusted with it.  I think I'll play around with this recipe and these ingredients and just not add the rice.  I also served it with biscuits and I think if the rice hadn't been in it we would have really enjoyed it.  This recipe is not a keeper for my family as it is originally written.

I added broccoli, onion, carrots and mushrooms to this recipe.  Along with garlic powder, basil and poultry seasoning.  Cooked on low for 6 hours.  My husband and I really liked it. Plenty of leftovers though.  Next time I will cut the recipe in half.

This recipe was only ok.  The chicken part of it tasted pretty good but the rice mixture looked and tasted like slop.  It was definately a recipe that I would not make again!

This didn't turn out well at all.  It was very dry and lacked something.  I am usually not a picky eater, but I just couldn't finish this.

This recipe is a good base recipe, if used as is, it's very bland.  It's good if you add garlic, onion, s & p, thyme, and milk towards the end.  Next time I will try chicken broth and carrots as well.

This is so simple a child could make it.  I would suggest a different type of rice but besides that it is perfect for a mom on the run.

Really easy!  I took some of the advice from the other reviews and added 1/2 milk, garlic powder and pepper.  The only problem I had was with the rice - it was crunchy - maybe I should have used minute rice?  I will make this again though!

I was glad to see I could make this in the crockpot since I've been making this oven for a while now.  I did add about 1/2 can of milk and a couple tablespoons of butter.  And I used two cans of cream of chicken and ommitted the cream of mushroom.  Everyone love it and there were no leftovers!

Awesome easy recipe. Like a lot of people I tweaked it a little. There's definitely room for tweaking if you want to but it's a great simple recipe. I used 1 can of cream of mushroom, 1 can of cream of chicken, and 1 can of water. I added some chopped sweet peppers and used chicken drumsticks. The meat fell off the bones. Hubby loved it!

Read reviews and tried several of the suggestions when I made this. First I mixed the rice and the soups before putting in the pot. Added half a bag of frozen broccoli, some chopped celery, and a cup of chicken broth. Topped this with four frozen chicken breasts. Sprinkled pepper and garlic salt over top. Let it cook on low while I was at work (8.5-9hrs total cook time). Rice was cooked, but overall the dish was mushy. Flavor was not as good as I expected (I love broccoli, but it was not good in this dish)  Not impressed-probably won't try this recipe again:(

I gave this recipe 1 star, because the flavor was very good.  Unfortunately, the other reviewers were right!  The rice was crunchy and mushy.  I substitued the cream of chicken soup for a can of chicken broth hoping that this would help with the crunchy rice.  Not successful.

This recipe was easy to make and easy to follow.   We added mixed veggies and compensated the 1/2 part of soup to water.  Changed the white rice to minute rice.  We didn't cube the chicken, just sliced in half.  It worked perfectly.  We will make this again.....with more changes - it's a work in progress.  It was delicius.

First recipe in my new slow cooker and I was very happy with it. I followed the recipe but browned the chicken first and got a better texture than I think I would have gotten otherwise, but the rice came out beautifully.

I used this recipe as the foundation for what I was was making. The only change I made to the ingredients list was that I substituted the white rice for some instant long grain wild rice.  I also added peas, carrots, and some broccoli to the mix and increased the cooking time.   I think it's delicious, and I'll give it a 4* rating.  Make sure you use instant rice to avoid crunchy under cooked rice that seems to be a common problem.  This is a great base recipe that leaves room to tinker with it to suit your taste.  Will be making it again.

Recipe was a good starting point.~however...next time however I will cook the rice separately and add it at the end.  I used 1 can cream of mushroom & 2 cans cream of chicken.  I also added water like most other posters.  I also added some salt, pepper, italian seasoning, garlic powder and onion powder, a can of peas, can of corn & can of diced carrots (all drained).  Trying to cook the rice with the rest of the ingredients made it a slop (although delish slop!).  Definitely will be serving it over biscuits :)

easy to make, tasty, and filling. I also liked that the carb count was fairly low. made this with asparagus and all in all it was a fast family meal that everyone enjoyed. wouldn't make for a fancy dinner party but fine for family meal.

If you are ok with dinner looking a little like gruel, this is good.  After reading the reviews, I did make the following changes: 1) used only 1 large can of cream of mushroom soup 2) used half that can of a mixture of wine and water to thin out, 3) used chicken thighs instead of breasts (they fell apart, which was ok) and 4) added a frozen package of broccoli with cheese sause on the top.  I also added a lot of garlic powder to taste.  It was a little "greuly": my rice did not stay hard but got a little mushy.  I also had to stir it a lot to make sure the rice didn't stick to the bottom and sides of the slow cooker.  Served with cheese on top, it's delicious, filling and yummy on a cold day, but not much to look at.

I used cheddar cheese soup rather than cream of mushroom.  Also added some chopped fresh broccoli the last hour and a half.  Cooked rice separately.  Added at end of cooking.  Very good

This was an easy and tasty dish to make..did I mention it was easy?  I made the rice separate, because I felt it would get lost in all of the sauce. Perhaps only two cans of soup were needed instead of three. You could really pick any of the flavors of soup to use since I couldn't pick out a distinct flavor when they were all mixed. I used frozen chicken breast,which added a little water to the mixture and made it slightly thinner.  I will make it again, you can't beat a fast meal for dinner.

Loved this receipe. I made the following changes: I used the Campbell's Soup, 98% fat free versions of the soups. I used brown rice instead of white rice (because it's way better for you) and added a soup can full of water as well as 1/4 cup of milk. I followed the advice from one of the other posts, and stirred the rice around with the soup mixture before adding the chicken. I used frozen chicken breasts, so I didn't cut the chicken into pieces and cooked it all on low heat for 8 hours. I stirred in a bag of steamed broccoli before serving (the kind you throw in the microwave - I microwaved it first before adding). I'm going to make this recipe again. It's really good stick-to-your ribs stuff!

This was awful.  The chicken turned out tender but that was the only good thing about it.  Very bland.  I used cream of mushroom, cream of broccoli, and a can of chicken broth.  From the other reviews I added a few other spices such as garlic powder, pepper, and a splash of white cooking wine.  It still had very little flavor and it served up like slop.  I used instant rice and 1 cup wasn't enough.  I'm planning on rinsing the sauce off the leftover chicken and making something else so as not to waste all this chicken.

Rice gets really sticky, which I actually enjoyed.  But the recipe itself needs more flavor.   I would highly advise using some of the modifications on other posts.

I thought this was just ok, a little bland for my taste.  I did add some broccoli as per the other suggestions.  I think it has potential though, I would maybe try adding some onion and maybe use potatoes instead of rice.  Good starting recipe just needs some work.

The "gravey" was good although it was a little too "canned soup" tasting. But the chicken itself though very tender was bland. I cooked the rice on the side but Im certain that if the rice were cooked in the soups it would be very difficult to get it fully cooked without making it mushy.

Well I do like the overall taste of the dish, but my rice did not finish cooking either.  I just prepared some more rice to serve with it, but I will have to work with this some more to see about getting the rice done.  I may try to use elbow noodles next time as another person suggested...

After reading all the reviews, I used the soups called for plus a 10 oz can of Chicken Broth.  I used converted rice instead of minute rice (here in CA, I used Uncle Ben's rice and Campbell's chicken broth).  DH & son  liked it, for me though, it didn't have much flavor.  I browned my chicken first to sear it so that it wouldn't shred while cooking and it worked fine!  Overall it was a bit mushy, lacking in flavor and rich from the cream soups.  Sorry, but I don't think I'll try it again.(3 stars for ease in preparation.)

This is dish is exactly as the name states, only it fails to tell you how good this is. We barely had time to sit to eat much less stop long enough to fix a big meal.. this recipe was just perfect. I had everyone here from in-laws to children so I doubled it and got compliments from all. I simply tossed a salad together and heated up a vegetable, POOF~* Dinner was ready!Thanks for sharing.

Well this is not my favorite recipe from this site.  Like other reviewers, it was a bit bland.  I even added some rosemary, minced onions and some garlic.  It was also alittle too soupy for me.  I throw a bag of frozen veggies in and I did not cook the rice in the slow cooker.  Will probably make this again with some changes.

I called this "slop" and "gruel" while dishing it up for my husband.  The consistency was horribly mushy, the rice had broken down and the entire crock pot looked like it was filled with  malt-o-meal.  It's a good thing I added several spices because that may have been the ONLY thing that saved this was that the tast was acceptable.  I added one tsp of garlic, Cavender's, black pepper, rosemary, and minced onions.  Will not ever make again.

This was okay. I added 1 cup water and some pepper. My rice wasn't crunchy like lots of other folks, but I just wasn't really jazzed by it. My hubby liked it though. I think it was a little too rich for me.

I agree with other reviews.  Very Bland!!!  Needed much more flavor.  My rice mixture was good but the chicken was bland.  Will probably never try this again.

This was awful......the chicken was over-cooked and the rice never cooked.  The rice was hard after 4 hours in the slow cooker.  Bland flavor--not a recipe I would make again.

This was really a great tasting recipe, and so easy.  Only problem, I halved the recipe (for 2), and there wasn't enough rice.  I made some additional rice pilaf, and it was a great combo.  My husband says, "it's a keeper."

I should have listened to the reviews. My rice was crunchy and the flavor was bland. I ended up adding water and milk, but too late for the crunchy rice. I suggest a can of water and a can of milk, some seasoning (like pepper, garlic or onion,) some veggies and instant rice. The blend of soups was nice, but should have used Campbell's brand. I may try this again with some changes.

Fast easy and very good. I cooked it for fours on low and waited untill the last hour to add the rice. Also used cream of brocolli,celery and chicken Dijon rather than what was listed. Seasoned it up a bit more with a little cajun seasoning,oregano,& dry mustard.

I love crock pot cooking.  Throw ingredients together the night before, put it on to cook before you go to work and come back in the afternoon to a homecooked meal.  Added a bit of garlic salt and celery salt--very tasty.

This was soooo good.  My family and I didn't find it bland at all.  I have two toddlers to keep up with during the day so this recipe made it easy to throw dinner together in the afternoon and forget about till dinner time.  Best of all, it's a one pot meal if you throw in some frozen veggies the last 30 minutes and serve with some warm rolls.  Yummy.

My spice lovin family, gave this recipe raves.
I omitted the rice.  Instead I used frozen puff pastry.  When the chicken was done I cut it up, placed it over the golden browned pastry with the sauce, and added sauted mushrooms and microwaved frozen peas.  This is a foolproof dinner, elegant enough for company. Thank you Linda!

easy dinner for on the go moms, like myself, i do add veggies like corn, carrots, and celery to make sure i get veggies in there so all i have to do is dish it up. i also add more water to thin it out a bit because it can get very thick the longer it is in there as well as pepper and some paprika, just to taste.

very easy and super yummy :) I changed it up a bit though.  instead of the cream of mushroom I used a can of water.  I also added broccoli and asparagus at the beginning.   I cooked it on the low temp and everything turned out amazing! hopefully my boyfriend won't notice the asparagus hehe :)

This is a very simple recipe, good for kids or anyone picky, but you must cook the rice first! It will be very crunchy. Also simple to throw in in the morning ,you can even cook the rice the night before to save time.

What could be easier - just open a coupla cans of soup and toss in a chicken ... lolol

I made this, and it was WONDERFUL! It reminded me of a similar recipe my mother used to make years ago, which was a favorite of mine - so I bravely added 1/8 teaspoon of CURRY to the mix. It came out PERFECT.

I adjusted serving size to TWO servings, for just myself, so that called for 1/2 can of each of the 3 soups. Later in the week, I cooked the remaining half cans of soup with just the rice, as I had no more chicken. Then I stirred in a can of tuna. STILL DELICIOUS :) This is now a staple of my easy, cheap cooking for one person. Thank you so much! :)

Compared this recipe to other versions found online & used converted rice like they (and many reviewers) suggested. I will make again but add more seasonings and an extra half cup of rice.

this was good in that it was done in 4 hours and did not require much work.  i used organic soups (I cant tolerate msg) and 2/3 c dry white wine, added carrots, celery and onion.  it is a bit soupy so i would add extra rice next time (i made another cup of rice to put under the dinner).  my rice came out fine and i used organic lundberg white rice.  chicken was cooked well after 4 hours on high.  let it sit after being cooked to absorb some liquid.  i may omit white wine next time and add more herbs and salt (remember: i did not use campbells which packs some punch in flavor dept)

I added 3/4 cup of water because I think the rice needs water to cook. I also added some other spices. It tastes good but it's kinda mushy. The rice is also a little under cooked. I don't think I am going to do this again.

This recipe is a good starting point, but definitely needs some changes.  It has to have water to cook the rice.  Here is how I modified it and it turned out pretty good:  3 full chicken breasts 2 cans cr of chicken 2 cans cr of mushroom 2 cans water 2 cups brown & wild rice  I was short on time, so I turned it on high and it cooked in 3 hours in the slow cooker.  I also added broccoli, cauliflower and carrots.  It would have been good with even more rice, in my opinion.

The first time I made this in slow cooker as directed. I just made it again on the stovetop. I used brown rice instead of white. I had to add 1 1/2 cups water to prevent rice from sticking. Cooked low and slow for 2 hrs. Came out creamy and delish.

YUCK!  Had to throw it all in the trash.  What a waste.  I cooked it on low for 7 hours, used more rice than it called for and added 1/2 minute rice and 1/2 regular white rice.  Also added some water and some broth so the rice would soak up the liquid and hopefully not be hard.  Well, the minute rice soaked up all the liquid and the mixture came out thick and gross looking, but the regular rice was STILL HARD and not edible. I had to order pizza .

My family absolutely LOVED this recipe!!  I did add salt and pepper, and some chicken seasoning to the chicken before I put in in the crockpot.  I did cut up the chicken, because with small children, its easier to serve their plates when the meat is smaller.  The rice was very good, not hard and not mushy.  My picky picky husband even like the rice!!  I did cook it for about 5.5 hours though...Will most definitely make again!!

This was cheap to make which is the main reason I gave it 2 stars. When it comes to how the dish cooked and tasted it wasn't good. The rice was not cooked thoroughly. I added 3 seasonings to the mix and it was still bland. I added butter and another can of cream of chicken and it still had a pastey consistency. This dish would probably perform better as a casserole baked in the oven. I would probably cut the chicken into smaller chunks, add either chicken broth or milk, mix, cover with cheese and bake.

Ok, this recipe is easy, and it has potential, but it must be adjusted.  First, I don't think it matters what cream of _____ soups you put in, it comes out creamy and flavorful.  But I do think adding more spices is necessary.  So garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, salt and fresh ground pepper all made a big difference.  Second, just cook the rice separately in a rice cooker.  After reading the reviews about the rice issues people were having, I still decided to put my rice in and just cook it longer.  Nope, five hours later some of the rice was cooked, and some of it was super hard.  Third, adding some fresh veggies like onions and celery ( others suggest peas or broccoli) really give it some texture.  The chicken came out fantastic, but I had to scrap off the inconsistent rice and do without.  I was bummed, but  I learned my lesson.

Easy and good.  Brown the meat first and put the rice in the slow cooker with a cup of water or chicken broth.  Cook for 10 min then add the soup and chicken.  The rice will cook and the chicken falls apart, yummy.  My kids and husband loved it!

Good, added some garlic, pepper and sea salt.  I also added some fresh mushrooms and tomato. I cubed the chicken instead of using large chunks. I don't really like cream of celery so maybe next time I will use another can of mushroom soup.

This was so easy, and I used instant rice instead, turned out perfect.  Added some seasoning salt (not much about a 1/4 tsp) to the chicken before mixing all the soups together and pouring over top.  I might add some quartered onions to the bottom of the crock pot next time. It was flavorful and my family loved it. Great Comfort Winter Recipe.

The chicken was WONDERFUL...I do agree with a lot of the other reviews, in that the rice just doesn't seem to cook up right. I added small red potatoes, carrots, whole fresh mushrooms and a cup of chicken broth. It was great.  Next time though, I will add these things and not add the rice.

Just a few changes here. Used about a half cup chicken broth and a cup of dry white. I whisked the three soups over the stove with the rice to a smooth consistency before adding it to the cooker. I also added whole cremini mushrooms and one large onion (quartered). I then seasoned the chicken with salt, pepper, cayenne, paprika and fresh thyme. The wine and fresh thyme penetrated through the chicken like nothing else. It tasted amazing. I had about 1 1/4 cups of rice in this dish and strongly believe it can handle more.

The taste was very good, however, as other reviewers have written, the rice was not done all the way.  I even added a little extra water (per another reviewers suggestion).  I cooked it in the slow cooker on low for about 5 3/4 hours.  Still, the rice was not done.  Great flavor, but the crunchy rice didn't make up for it to me.  I may try this again with some variations with the liquid.

As others have said this is a very good base recipe. I used only two cans of cream of something soup and then dumpped a couple of cans of water in. I also added a lot of random seasoning to add to the flavor. The other thing I did differently was left it cooking for about 8 hours. I got home from work in the morning, turned on the crock pot, and it was mushy and ready to eat when I got up in the evening.

Not gourmet fare, but a great easy meal that my kids enjoy. I cut my chicken breasts in wide strips and browned in olive oil. I seasoned it with Greek seasoning, garlic powder, and salt.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  I decided to doctor it up a little bit after reading the other reviews.  I added 1 large can of cream of chicken soup and a small can of the cheese soup.  I also cooked up the chicken before putting it in the crockpot, just for color.  It came out a little dry, so I added some chicken broth for the last hour of cooking.

I found the basic recipe to be great, but I made my base from left over broth from a turkey. I added rosemary and some fresh Italian basil plus Cookes flavor enhancer  for flavor. The most important thing I did was cook everything but the rice in the slow cooker and then added the rice about 30 minutes prior to serving and I have found that this ensures that the rice is not over cooked and still fluffy.

Kind of bland - added onion soup mix w/ canned soups per other reviewers comments and used minute rice + 2 cups water. Consistancy was just fine- was done perfectly in 4 hours-  but just tasted blah. Kids wouldn't touch it.

This was a very easy dish to make, I modified it a bit by adding some red wine and using chicken breasts and cooked til they almost fell apart. I then took out the chicken and added a little flour/water mixture to make a gravy which I served over bowtie pasta. Then made a side dish of Easy Fried Spinach which I added some pinenuts to. Delicious!

I would like to call this recipe a work in progress.  It has a good base idea but it needs some tweaking.  I used only two cans of soup and added one can of chicken broth but it still came out like paste.  I will try something like this again but with more liquid and more seasoning.  Good luck.

This recipe was very easy to fix.  Just don't put it on and cook it while you are at work, chances are it will be burned by the time you get home.  Could have used some water, but very filling.

This recipe was soooo good.  It tasted like chicken noodle soup only in a casserole.  My husband was skeptical but he was easily won over- he even took all of the leftovers with him to work! (and told his parents that they should make it!)

This recipe was great.  At first I wasn't sure to rate either a 3 or 4 star because the rice is real mushy but I couldn't stop eating it!!  My husband and my to boys, age 4 and 2 loved it too. I used 1/2 can of water, a little sage, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  Just a shake or 2 of each.   I also used dark meat.  I cut up a couple thighs and left 3 chicken legs whole cause my boys like legs.  I also added 1/2 bag frozen broccoli.  Next time I will try using brown rice so it won't be mushy.

This chicken was good but a little bland. I added spices such as garlic salt, onion powder, rosemary, minced onion, and poultry seasoning but it was still lacking "something". Mushy appearance, but still not too bad for a quick meal.

Very easy, very tasty.  Everyone, from my husband to the kids to the toddler LOVED it.  My only disappointment was that the rice was not cooked through; I cooked on high, so that may have been why.

This was excellent - and easy.  I added broccoli and more rice.  Also, I didn't have Cream of Celery soup on hand, so I substituted an extra can of Cream of Chicken soup, and added celery seed.

The dish is to salty because of the use of canned soup. Next time I would only use two(2)canned soups and add water.

Most of the other reviewers made significant changes to this recipe to make IT taste good.  What's the point of an easy slow cooker meal, if you have to make the rice separately and need to significantly change the recipe?

I added a cup of water as others suggested and ended up with a mushy, bland and tough chicken meal!

YUK!

Fast, easy, and yummy. Not super flavorful though which I think is good, allows people to season their plates hoe they like. Added one soup  can of water to it so the rice would cook all the way. Also added carrots and green beans, probably would have added other veggies if I had them. Ended up adding about a tsp of onion powder and a couple pinches of garlic salt (I think it needed more but my boyfriend did not agree). We like a lot of rice and ended up cooking another cup and a half on the side and adding it at the end. We did use brown rice instead. 
Will probably make again and add a little more to it, its good for throwing in a Tupperware and bringing to work.

We liked this.  I preferred to cook the rice separately in my rice cooker, then pour the chicken and gravy over the rice.  It was very good.  I also seasoned it with a tsp of salt and 1/4 tsp pepper.

Once of the more disappointing dishes I've tried from this site. The chicken was delicious, but the rice was quite mushy. I'd make it again, except I wouldn't add rice to the slow cooker. I would make it separate and serve the chicken over the rice.

I normally have the soups on hand but in the larger size so that's what I used. I added more chicken breast and cut them into chunks instead. Since there was no additional water added I held back on the rice. Made steamed vegetables and narrow egg noodles instead rice. Layered the noodles, vegetables and chicken mixture in a bowl to serve. Should have had some biscuits to go with it.

This was a great recipe.  I added 1/2 tsp of salt, 1/2 tsp of pepper, 1 tsp onion powder, 1/4 tsp garlic powder,  & sprinkled the chicken with creole seasoning.  I also added a bag of frozen califonia mixed vegetables.   I will definitely make this again!

It came out really good, but next time I think I'm going to cook the rice ahead of time.  It remained very hard and didn't fluff up any as I had expected it to.  Was very tasty on toast, almost like the boil a bags I had as a kid.

I did a double dose, but added 2 cans of water halfway thru the 4 hours and the rice still came out hard.  I am gonna try minute rice next time and see what happens.  What did the person who made this recipe to make the rice cook???  They never said.  Other suggestions for marinating the chicken before cooking sound great.  Now I have to let my mother know of the change for the rice.  If anyone else, has ideas regarding getting the regular rice to cook, please let me know.

Pretty good for being so easy! I added 1/2 cup of Sherry (which I think I'll add more next time), ground black pepper & minced garlic. I did not put rice in the pot, I separately cooked brown rice for a side. I'll probably make it again,but add some colorful veggies!

This was very delicious and easy! It IS thick and a little pasty when it's done, but I love that. You may want to add a little water if you don't like thick. I used brown minute rice instead of regular rice because the bad reviews say the rice was hard. Minute rice will cook to tender. Instead of using 4 boneless halves I used 2 boneless full breasts and cut them into cubes. I didn't even have to add salt to this. Wonderful flavor!

Imam not a great cook so the lack of instructions with the rice made it vague.  So I added rice a roni chicken rice at the begining.  The rice came out mushy but overall good taste. Be t time I will put the same rice and pa k in an hour before it's done and see how that goes.

Although it was extremely easy, I felt this dish was very bland, I added pepper and salt which helped a little and it was very thick almost porridge like.

When I read the recipe, I thought that there may not be enough rice, so I added a 1/2 cup more; and a 1/2 cup of water to compensate for moisture.  NOT a good idea.  There was too much rice.  And my rice was a bit crunchy after cooking 5 hours on low. I'm not sure if the crunchy rice was from too much or otherwise since others complained of undercooked rice.

I thought this recipe was great after a few changes (made after reading previous reviews). I added thyme, some Cajun seasoning and pepper to the chicken and used chopped chicken thighs instead of breast (they were out of breasts at the store). I used all 3 kinds of soup but added 2 cans of water as well. I used one cup of long grained regular white rice. I stirred the rice in really well and stirred a few times during the cooking as well. I initially increased the cooking time to 4 hours on high after reading that the rice was undercooked in some attempts, but when I checked the dish after 3 hours it was perfectly done - tender rice and chicken and very flavourful. I also added a good few handfuls of button mushrooms.

I've made this a few different times.  No matter what I do the rice never gets evenly cooked.  Some is very crunchy and others totally mush.  This time I precooked the rice with the soups for 1 hour on high before reducing to low and adding frozen chicken tenderloins.  The chicken turned out great, just not the rice.  I make a similar dish to this in the oven.  Turns out better that way.

This was good comfort food.  You do sort of have to "doctor" it up to give it more flavor i.m.o.  I did buy some cream of chicken soup to try it again since I didn't have any last time (used stock and cornstarch).  I only had brown rice so I had to use more water and cooking time. I also added goat cheese and some pesto and it ended up like a chicken based risotto.  Not bad.

I made this today. I added one soup can of water, some frozen peas and some Cajun Seasoning to the mixture.  I cooked my rice separate, and it turned out a little too soupy for my taste. I wanted it to be thicker. The flavor is great though. Next time I will not add any water and probably make it with double the rice to get it to the consistency that I like.

Wonderful, cooked while I was reorganizing the house and it was great to have something to eat after you've been working hard.  All I had to do before I started my afternoon was toss it all in and STIR the rice into the soup so it will absorb I haven't had a hard piece of rice yet.  Add your own herbs and seasonings. I tossed in some garlic and onion powder and made up some more rice just because I love rice.  Great lunch! Thanks for sharing!

This is so good.  I don't care for cream of celery soup so I substituted with cream of broccoli.

I added 1/2Tb Mrs. Dash and 1/4tsp of chili powder and a dash of parsley. With those additions, this was a tasty dish.

This was really good.  Will make it again.  I did tweak it a bit.  I used whole skinless chicken thighs.  I added a can of chicken broth, 1/2 bag of Corn and 1/2 bag of Peas, 1 cut of chopped carrots.  Used seasonings, pepper, salt, minced onion, and garlic salt.  I threw it all together and cooked it on high for 2 hours and low for 2 hours.  Will try chopped potatoes next time.

Also had rice issues. Added broccoli and it ended up overcooked and mushy and SOME of the rice was still hard. Has potential to be a great base recipe. I'm just crock-pot challenged.

This is so easy to make...No modifications needed but occasionally I add chopped or minced onions and garlic Powder or cloves.  Not the healiest but my 3 year old is a fan and it is a hot meal to put on the table.

This was definitely easy, but my husband declared that it was "sort of bland" and I agree. I think that if you spice this recipe up some and add some veggies it might be improved. I likely won't try this again.

I thought this was really good. The only changes I made were seasoning the chicken breasts with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Also, I didn't cut the chicken up because I knew it would be falling apart  after it was cooked. It had a really good flavor and both my roommate and I loved it.

this was pretty good...had good flavor, and was extremely easy to make...although all of that soup contains lots of sodium. I probably will make it again, simply because it's easy.

This recipe was good.
The chicken was really bland and had no flavor at all.
It didnt need to be cooked as long as it said to be cooked either.
It could have been better.
I will use this recipe again though!

This is a great recipe! My husband really likes it. Sometimes we substitute the cream of celery soup for cream of broccoli, depending on what we have in the cupboard. It always turns out great! Thanks for sharing!

I added a can of milk to the soup and it still came out pretty thick. I also added some fresh garlic and onion. If I decide to make it again I will try adding salsa, maybe some corn and cheese.

I thought the flavor was a bit too rich, and the 3 soups combined made it too thick. There was also a lot of leftover rice once the chicken was gone.

I used regular white rice and it was a bit crunchy even after cooking longer than the recipe stated.  I added extra seasoning as others suggested.  It was ok, my family however wasn't that fond of it.

This was pretty good. I added baby carrots to cook with it, and stirred in parmesean/romano cheeses before serving. I will still try out similar recipes, but would be happy to serve this again.
Thanks, Linda!

I made this for dinner the other night and it was awful.  Everything cooked okay...just tasted bad.  Since I am not a picky eater, I new my husband and daughter would not like it.  I threw it out and we ate take out.  I cook a lot of great meals using recipes from this site.  Sorry-this one does not make my list of keepers.

Ended up with a puddle of I don't know what at the bottom of my crock pot full of grease.

This is a thumbs down from me.

A little bland, but I added minced garlic, onion salt and a can of chicken broth, since most other people did it.

This meal is easy but not too tasty.  My husband and kids enjoyed it, I found it a bit bland.  For a stress-free, very easy meal though, it was great.

Very quick and very easy!   I wouldn't want to have it every night though.  Once in a while is plenty.

Easy to fix, but need to add some flavor and chopped vegetables, like carrots and onions.
