Wow!  I give this 5 stars. (1) Flavor, (2) time, (3) ease, (4) simple ingredients, (5) presentaion.  I'm new to cooking, so I've been looking for quick and easy recipes using stuff I have in the pantry.  This was it!  The only thing I did not have was the cilantro, so I left it out.  I will definitely make this again.  Next 
time I think I will substitute the garlic powder for minced garlic.   My husband thought there were too many apples.  There were a lot.  It wouldn't hurt to cut this part by half.  They made it a little sweet, but not too much.  I just ate the apples he didn't want because I thought they were great.  Also, I did not peel the apple and it was fine.  Thanks for a great recipe.  One I would serve to dinner guests.

super easy and great tasting.  I used frozen chicken tenders for even more ease and speed.  I served this over rice and my husband and I loved it!

I was putting it together thinking...this is not going to taste good. While cooking and stirring, I was thinking, this is just wrong - these ingredients are not going to taste right together - and adding my spicy leftover salsa verde is not going to help one bit. But, I followed through, served on brown rice with mexican shredded cheese and a little sour cream on top and it was good!! Ha ha, surprise, surprise! Glad I made it :)

Very good! One thing I did differently was to mix the oil, vinegar and spices together then pour over the chicken and let it marinate for a few hours to let the flavor soak in. The cilantro, apple, onion combo gave it a great flavor. I didn't know what tomatillo salsa was so used fresh salsa from the produce section of the grocery store.

I liked this recipe quite a bit. I made a few alterations, like adding in more of the spices, didn't use apples.. but I thought it was a great recipe idea and we'll be having it again.

This recipe is wonderful.  I like to use jonathan apples the best.  I also use much more red wine vinegar than the recipe calls for.  The blend of flavors it superb!

Both my husband and I liked this very much.  I tweaked it by adding low-sodium chicken broth when I realized that the onions and vinegar would not supply enough moisture.  I also free-handed the spices, adding at least twice to three times the amount of spices mentioned in the recipe.  Sprinkled some cumin on as well, as one of the other reviewers recommended, and a sprinkling of sea salt.  Used Mexican salsa verde sauce for the final touch; my husband used plain yogurt to tone down the spiciness but liked the combination of the sauce with the yogurt.  Definitely a dish I would make again!!! Thank you for the recipe!

This recipe is so easy and tastes wonderful.  The sweet and spicy combination is perfect.  The apples are divine.  I've made it vegetarian with Quorn and everyone wanted the recipe!

I really wanted to like this recipe. I followed other reviewer's comments about adding more seasonings and serving it as a fajita. Either way, I just didn't like it. :( Oh, well!

This surprised me with how good it was! The flavors went really well together and nothing was overpowering.  I changed it a bit: used rice wine vinegar, omitted the cilantro (not a fan) and added chicken broth with the apples and onions because I thought it needed more liquid than just the vinegar to cook in.  I added about a ½ tablespoon of regular medium salsa at the end because I didn’t have tomatillo salsa and I didn’t think it needed to be heated up. Other than that, will def. make again!

Served this for dinner last night and everyone enjoyed it. The fresh cilantro overpowered any taste of nutmeg so the next time I may tweek this recipe just a bit. We used it as a filling for tortillas with added lettuce and Monteray jack. Will make again!

I loved this, but my husband hated it so much, he refused to eat it!  Turns out he hates cooked apples (good to know), but when I told him just to push them to the side and eat the chicken, he didn't like that, either.  That's the only reason I didn't rate this recipe 4 or even 5 stars, for ease of preparation, originality, and flavor.  I think if you like the individual elements of this dish, you'll probably enjoy it. I marinated my half-thawed chicken strips in the vinegar and spices for about 30 minutes before cooking.  I also doubled the spice amounts, and added a little salt. I personally loved the combination of flavors and textures, and would make it again if he had liked it. As it is, I've got enough leftovers for two lunches, while he had to take a PB&J!

The apples had the most flavor! Paired it with rice and it was pretty good. Might just do whole chicken pieces next time and put the apples in at the beginning...I ended up overcooking the chicken a little.

Tasted great! I didn't add cilantro, simply because I didn't have any & hubby doesn't care for it. Otherwise, I followed the recipe. Very different. Very tasty. Will add to my repertoire.

Not as good as I expected considering the good reviews - needs more spice and probably better if it was marinated in the spices...it was ok

Great recipe!  I made it almost exactly as written, based on what I had and could find.  I used regular salsa instead of tomatillo, since I couldn't find the the specified salsa in the store. I also used just one apple, as it seemed like two apples would be too much.  I forgot to buy cilantro so I used dried parsley instead, and used dried Italian seasoning instead of the other herbs (didn't feel like purchasing dried oregano on it's own).  I will make this again.

It tasted great, but I recommend only making as much as you can eat right away.  I found that it didn't reheat for leftovers very well.

Very tasty dish.  It's a unique dish, very different grouping of flavors than what I would normally put together.  Prep time, for me, was a little longer than 15 min.

Great recipe!  I was hesitant about the apples, so I used half of what it called for, and was pleasantly surprised!  Loved the combination of the apples and cilantro.

This was pretty tasty! I like the flavor of the chicken with the apples eaten together. I didn't peel my apple and it was fine. I didn't have any tomatillo salsa, so I made it without and it was still good. Overall, it's very good for a health dish!

This was delicious! My son and husband loved it. The chiklen was moist and full of flavor. Using the red wine vinegar and fresh cilantro is crucial to this dish. I used lots of red salsa making sure the chicken was covered.  It helped with the presentation.

Awesome texture and flavor. I used dried cilantro and regular salsa. Would have been much better with fresh cilantro and salsa verde. I served mine over rice with a side of broccoli. It was a nice light dish.

delicious!  My husband loved it and looks forward to the next time I make it.  Easy enough to prepare during the week.

Easy! I even used meat off of drumsticks instead of ck breast because I didn't have any w/ me.  Definitely worth doing again!

This was definitely not good. It was very easy to make so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The flavors did not 'fuse' together.  In fact, it tasted rather bitter. I was so excited to try this because it looked so good. I was very dissapointed - especially because this was featured in the "What's Cooking" daily email.

I thought this recipe was just okay.  I think my family would have liked it better with a much more mild tomatillo salsa.  The only tomatillo salsa I could find was quite spicy.

I made this chicken last night and my husband said that it was the best thing I had made in a while. I wrapped the chicken in a whole wheat tortilla and just put the tomatillo sauce in with the chicken without heating it up to save time.

I tried this last night and it was really yummy! I didn't have the red wine vinegar so I left that out. But it tasted great all the same. The apples were a delicious (and nutritious) surprise.

This was great!!! My husband loved it and I am going to make it for an upcoming potluck served with corn tortillas.  One thing I did though, was put MUCH more of the spices than what the recipes called for--I pretty much just sprinkled all the spices all over both sides of the chicken, AND I added a hefty shake of salt.  I think more spice was key, otherwise I can see where it would be bland.  Also one reviewer said they didn't think you needed the apples.  The apples MAKE the dish!  Yum!

Perfect!!! Only thing I did different was I put it in the oven for 30 min, at 170 degrees, just to let the seasons and chicken soak in the flavor with the salsa on top. It's an interesting mix but tastes wonderful. A must try!

This was just OK - after I prepared it I ended up having to add more of all the spices the recipe called for, as well as 1/2 tsp of sugar and lots of salt.  I probably won't make this again.

This was definitely DIFFERENT.  It turned out pretty watery after adding the onions and apples.  It seemed like the spices got mostly washed off the chicken into the water.  So, it didn't have a lot of flavor without the salsa.  I don't think we'll try it again.

I really liked this recipe. I had to make a few last minute changes because I didn't have something. The first thing that I changed was the red wine vinegar I was out so I used white balsamic vinegar. Then I was out of garlic powder so I used garlic flakes. The last change I made was I couldn't find the tomatillo salsa at the store so I just used regular salsa. Even with these changes I really liked the dish. My husband also liked it he said it was something to have again. Next time I will try to have all the ingredients on hand.

My husband is on a very sodium restricted diet and it has been a real challenge to find recipes that are low sodium and also tasty...this one was outstanding. I didn't have cilantro, but used a spicer salsa that really did the trick.  This will be repeated often at our house!

This was really pretty boring. After all the positive reviews I was hoping for something unusual. It's edible, but I won't be making it again.

Very good! I took the advice to only use one apple tho and think that it prob could have used two, but to each his own. I also used a sprinkle of cumin and served it over rice. Yummy!

This was edible but I don't think I'd make it again. Boyfriend just said it was different. I left out the red wine vinegar bc I didn't have any but I don't think that was why I didn't like it. It just didn't suit our tastes. Sorry!
