I like hot but goodness these are HOT and not for the faint of heart! These were even too hot for me which is saying something. Seeing how Frank's is a cayenne pepper sauce, I recommend cutting the cayenne pepper powder (no added flavor but only heat) in half or leaving it out altogether if you are sensitive to heat. These have great flavor but as written, be prepared for your lips to be lit on fire.

Very difficult to find something close to the wings I've had at Duffs pub.  These did it!  Perfect kick to match something equivalent to their "hot".  Trim the cayenne if you dont want too spicy.  Amazing flavor and my new go-to buffalo wing sauce!

definitely pretty hot and I like it. I didn't have  Cayenne pepper so I didn't use that. but still hot enough for me and I like hot. makes the top of the head tingle. nice texture. I added another teaspoon of flower and I think it was too much. 

made enough for about 8 large boneless tenders.

will save and probably make again.

Love it just as written, as a matter of fact I added more heat by using one of my favorite hot sauces. Bring on the heat.
