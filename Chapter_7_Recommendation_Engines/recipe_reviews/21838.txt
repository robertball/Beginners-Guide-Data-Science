This recipe is wonderful! I live in Holland and they do not sell vegetable oil like they do at home in America, so I had to use corn oil and it turned out perfectly. I used Braeburn apples since our choice of apples are not the same as they are in the states. I think using Braeburn apples was far better than the typical American apples I've grown up eating. This cake is even better the next day when kept in an air-tight container; it actually makes the cake more moist. I used the walnuts like it called for, but I made this again a week later and did not use them. I'm not a fan of nuts in recipes, but I think this recipe is perfect with the nuts but even better without them!! Simple ingredients, easy to make and absolutely delicious. I couldn't ask for any better!    

***After consulting my neighbor who happens to have moved to Holland from Romania, she told me that this in it's traditional Romanian form does NOT involve walnuts at all. Just thought I'd pass that bit of information along.***

This is just like what my grandmother (Romanian, of course, she immigrated to Canada with my grandfather) used to make, she called it Appelkuchen (not sure of spelling). She diced the apples finely probably because her teeth were not so good anymore. This tastes best about a day or so after cooking and, for a cake, keeps quite well. Any substitutions detract from the authenticity and longevity of the cake; applesauce spoils much faster than oil, I always say that the bacteria, mold etc. have healthy tastes, they don't eat junk foods as they have no nutrients! So it is not healthy, but a delicious hearty spice cake that anyone not overly concerned about their diet will enjoy a slice of. It tastes a bit like apple pie or apple sauce but as a cake. And it does have a lot of apples, so you get a good dose of fruit. Alright enough rambling but I am happy to have found this recipe and be able to make my grandmother's cake!

My son and I made this as part of a school report on Romania.  It was a huge hit at school and he came home with an empty pan and tons of requests for the recipe.  Now months later his class has requested that he bring it for their Valentine's Day Party. (I don't normally think of apple cake for Valentine's Day but it's what they want.) It is very easy to make and tastes good.  Obvisously, it is a hit with kids.

This was very easy to prepare.  The cake looked very lumpy and I thought that there were too many apples, but it made the cake very moist and tasty.  Was great warm but even better the next day.

AWESOME! This was so delicious in a real comfort-food, homey kind of way. I made this for my husband to take to the Thanksgiving lunch he had at work. I used five kinds of apples (Macintosh, Granny Smith, Gala, Pink Lady, and Jonagold). I baked it in a bundt pan and then when it cooled (to make it pretty for sharing) I drizzeled it with glaze that I made with powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, cinnamon, and a dash of salt. I will say that I, like others, thought I'd done something wrong when I was through mixing the batter. It's all apples! But as it bakes, the cake puffs up and around the apples and it's just yummy. I love the big apple chunks. It's like apple pie meets spice cake. So good! I'll be making this a lot in the future.

This is a great cake.  Right away I decided I wanted to add 1 T. of cinnamon instead of what it called for.  We are a cinnamon family, especially when it comes to cinnamoned apples. I added 1/4 t. salt to bring to enchance flavors since I believe that all recipes need a little salt.  Yes, it seems that 5 apples is a lot, but it's not.  The apple takes the cake in this recipe.

This was a nice apple cake, made to the recipe. My apples carry a lot of moisture, so needs a little more flour for me, otherwise it's too moist. I would have liked to see some more cinnamon in it. Good warmed up. Did powdered sugar glaze for the top, but it doesn't really need anything. Thanks for the recipe. 10/26/09~I have made this 3 times since this review, just a hint, I used about 4 cups of sliced apples as most apple cake/crisp recipes use this amount. Since varying apples are different sizes (mine are huge, I only use two for 4 cups) it helps to know how much instead of how many. 9/12/2010~made apple muffins from this. Used 4 Cups of apples, subbed 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 cup of the oil(which I always do), made in dark muffin pans, lowered temp to 325 cooked 22 to 24 minutes, got 18 muffins. Still great!

This cake is SUPER.  Did not change any of the ingredients.  Did make a mistake by not reading ahead in the recipe and put all the dry ingredients together and then adding them to the dry. Folded the apples and walnuts in at the end.  All come out wonderful.  I used to make this cake 40 years ago when we went camping.  Lost the recipe.  So glad to have it back.  Just a pleasure to serve.

This was just the kind of recipe I was looking for;simple and wonderful.I dont think Delicious apples are the best choice though,Macintosh and/or Granny Smith would be better.I used 3 kinds of apples and did not add walnuts as I had none on hand.Also this would probably work well with whole wheat flour.This recipe is a keeper!

I halved this recipe and used only one egg (since half the recipe would be 1&1/2 eggs). I also used a "generous" 1 tsp of cinnamon. I diced two small gala apples and omitted the walnuts since I was making it for my two babies under the age of 3. I baked it in an 8x8 glass pan for 25mins. The texture of this cake was perfect. My kids loved it! It was just right with my morning coffee.

Good flavor and we enjoyed the first day. But it was very moist, and by the second day it was downright too wet to eat, even though I only covered loosely with plastic wrap. I don't think i will make again, unless we use it up the same day.

Superb quality and simplicity. Followed the recipe to the letter. Gets better every day. Moist and an old world spice sweet. The perfect texture - I've never had a cake set so consistently as this one. Thank-you!!!!

Hi guys! Ravram here...

Love the reviews! Glad everyone seems to like it.

I should have mentioned a few things when originally posting this but here goes:

Of couese please adjust to suit your and your families needs. Add cinnamon or nutmeg or not. Use pears (I do too sometimes and a pinch of black pepper but I digress ...) sometimes a glaze sometimes just powdered sugar. 

I always used walnuts cause I love them plus my grandparents had a bunch of walnut trees in their orchard ... In Romania. So there you to. Every family is different  - every village woman had her own special twist or secret. I used to love visiting my grandparents :-)

In any event; adjust the recipe to suit your needs. Another tip is brown sugar 1 cup works great as well as what I originally wrote.

My family liked this recipe. We agreed it was a little bland. 
But since we had some ice-cream caramel topping, we drizzled that over each piece. Oh.My.Gosh. It was awesome! You've gotta try it with the caramel topping! 
So, I'll be making it again. Next time, I'll add 1/8 - 1/4 tsp salt, and maybe decrease the baking soda a little since every bite had a distinct baking soda flavor. And maybe I'll try a struesel topping.

I wanted to try this recipe, but since there are only two of us, I halved it.  I baked it in a large Pyrex pie plate.  I don’t like to rate something that I changed, but the changes are small ones that shouldn’t affect it.  I ran out of vegetable oil, so I subbed ‘pure’ olive oil, not the extra virgin. I use 2 smaller eggs instead of 1 1/2 (I mean we’re only talking about 2T egg, after all) and when it came to the walnuts, I forgot to halve the amount (oops!), luckily we like nuts. I baked it for 45 minutes and the tester came out clean. The cake turned out great, nice and moist. I’ll definitely make this again! I think I’ll write down the half recipe, since it’s such a nice size for us.

Pretty yummy! I didn't use the walnuts, as others said it wasn't authentic and I also don't like them. I used Fuji apples because that's what I had, and it was fruit-sweet, not too sweet. The family enjoyed it, I just wish it had something to make it pop!

I made 1 1/2 times the recipe (brought it in as the cake for my son's birthday celebration at daycare). I omitted the walnuts and added an additional apple in its place. For the cinnamon I simply ground up two thin sticks and used that. Increasing the recipe leads to semi-measurements (example, "- cup & - tsps." so I simply used even amounts rounding up or down. It was a hit, everyone wanted seconds! On another note, this is very similar to a cake I enjoyed as a child (baked by my Hungarian grandmother). Lightly topped with vanilla glaze.

This is, by far, the BEST apple cake recip I have tried.   It's simplicity is an added bonus.  I will be using it when my granddaughter visitis, as I think she will be able to easily follow the directions.  I added a light drizzle of glaze last time I made it, this time I threw in a handful of dried cranberries.  Love it!

The cake was good, but not outstanding. It was very different, very easy.  Will I make it again? Perhaps, but with many alterations.

Awesome!  Used 3 tsp. baking powder in place of baking soda, and only about 1 1/4 cups sugar.  Besides that followed the recipe to a T.  Served warm with whipped cream, came out great!

This cake is awesome! Sassyoldlady's picture of this cake made me want to try it. I had only 4 Granny Smith apples  and not quite enough sugar. So I used about a half a cup of home made syrup (the Absolute Best Pancake syrup from this site) in addition  to a cup of sugar. Baked this in a bundt pan. I baked it for 45 minutes and topped it with the syrup mentioned above. Definitely a keeper!! Thanks

This is one great recipe. The first cake I baked I used a mix of apples. I found 6 cups of large chunks is about right and I do mean large. Mine were about half the size of a base ball diamond. The second cake was made with twenty ounce pepin. I only need two of the pepin to make six cups. They are huge. I will try Braeburn next which we do grow in Michigan as well as other parts of the U.S. I used 2 tsp of cinnamon and one and a little less than 1/3 of sugar. I think the sugar depends on how sour the apples are. I would only use the 1 1/2 cups of sugar if the apples were sour. I take dinner out to my sister and brother-in-laws helpers at their orchard. This week it is going to be beef stew, biscuits and apple cake of course. This is truly a must try cake and the recipe goes together quick and easy.

It was really good, too sweet for me but next time I'll just reduce the sugar. The cinnamon taste was perfectly in balance with the apples.

One of the best apple cakes I've made/eaten this year!

wonderful !    wonderful !    This is such a delicious cake, moist & tasty.  I made this yesterday for company & WOW !!  fantastic, and I made it exactly as written, using 4 very large granny smith apples.  It seemed a peculiar texture after mixing in the appple chunks & walnuts, (seemed to be chopped apples with a sauce).  However, it turned out yummy!  Thank you for this delightful recipe & I see no reason for anyone to change a single thing.

This is very good! I made this exactly as stated and it was very tasty. I used 5 Gala apples and it was more than enough apples for the amount of batter. It baked up nicely and has a slightly crispy exterior that I thought was yummy. Very simple, yet flavorful cake. My husband loved it. Great recipe!

Excellent snack cake, especially when drizzled with vanilla icing (powder sugar with a little butter, milk and vanilla).  And, like the last reviewer said, even better the next day if stored in airtight container which makes it moister.  I will make this one again and again!

Made this for the first time tonight. Simple and so delicious. Served it up warm to my husband, son and my son's friend. A BIG HIT! Definitely and old fashion, traditional recipe. LOVE IT! In reading the other reviews I can't wait to taste it again after a day or two if my son and his friend don't eat it all. Thanks for sharing. Will definitely be making again.

This is a very easy cake to make and not overly sweet.  For added sweetness, top it with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream.

Moist and delicious although I did not have to bake it as long as the recipe stated. Also, I made a homemade icing to drizzle over the top, which added a nice touch.

Fantastic as is!  Over the past few weeks I've made this super simple cake a number of times and everyone loves it.  My husband brought some to work and they loved it so much I made one just for him to bring in.  My toddlers playgroup loved it and so do my neighbors.  Thank you for sharing such a wonderful recipe!

This cake was phenomenal.  The dough/batter is very thick, and I didn't have enough to cover the apples, so I had to whip up another half batch.  I also had to press it into the pan and over the apples.  I may have used a lot more apples than the recipe called for, but it worked out great.  Based on the thickness of the dough/batter, I thought the cake would be tough, but it was quite moist from the apples and delicious.  It is really good warm with vanilla ice cream.  I found this recipe while looking for something similar to a Polish "szarlotka".  It is not quite the same, but definitely worth making again.

I made this today for my little boy's birthday party. The guests seemed to like it and several of them went back for seconds, but it just didn't do it for me. Too many apples made for a sort of mushy texture. I think it would have benefited from more cinnamon, but I won't be making this again. Frankly, I doubt that I'll eat the leftovers. I infinitely prefer my mom's apple cake (with cream cheese icing, yum) and am going to make sure I track down her recipe!

This was a hit at the B&B this fall!  I chopped the apples rather than using them in thick slices (I also only had 3 large apples, so that's what I used).  I also substituted unsweetened apple sauce for the oil, but all else was per the recipe.  I really enjoyed this as a coffee cake and my guests did too!

The only apple cake recipe I'll need for the rest of my life.  We just had apple season and I already made this cake five or six times.  I make it as a bundt so take 5-10 minutes of the cook time.

I was surprised how well this turned out!  Definitely tastes better the next day -- just cover after it cools from the oven.  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar and upped the spices (cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg) and cut the apples into 1/2 inch wedges as 1 inch seems huge.  I also tried adding a middle streusal layer (of blended pecans, brown sugar and butter like a coffee cake topping) instead of the walnuts, and this was a big hit.

OMG this has to be the best apple recipe ever.  I made this thanks to sassyoldlady's picture, so a big thank you to here!  I think it was absolutely perfect exactly as written. It definitely doesn't need an icing. It is moist and just the perfect amount of sweet.  I would highly recommend that everyone tries this at least once.

delicious! Did not add walnuts so our one year old could enjoy it too. Perfect sweetness for us but the amount of sugar to use really depends on your apples.  TASTE your apples first, if they are already sweet, reduce your sugar; if they are tart add a bit more. We loved this. Thanks for the recipe!

I didn't think this cake was all that great.  I even laughed when I read one of the reviews said it was too sweet. This is a dessert that I would recommend to someone who doesn't like sweet desserts.  I just felt like something was missing.  It was very bland.  I put butter on my piece while it was warm just to give it some flavor. One of my kids wanted to know why I made bread with apples in it. I guess you could add cream cheese frosting.  The recipe is simple but so is the taste.

Wow. I must say, this is probably my favorite apple recipe now. It's fast, easy, not too much chopping involved... I hate when I have to sit and cut 10 apples into little paper thin slivers, haha. :) I made it without the walnuts, but my family ADORED IT. It was gone in 15 minutes. No lie. :)

My husband is Romanian, and he absolutly loved this cake. The only thing I did different was to add 2tsp. of cinnamon instead of 1 and it came out perfect. What a keeper!!!

This is the ugliest cake - going into the oven - but, when it is done - WOW!

I've made this many times and find peeled/cored Granny Smith apples work best.

My Romanian friends say, "savuros" (sp?)

Try lightly sprinkling it with cinnamon-sugar before baking.

Check out the picture I took the first time I made this cake - its only gotten better.

Petrecere frumoasa!

I found the cake to be a bit too filling and quite bland so I made quite a few changes to the recipe while in keeping with the original flavor and idea of a fresh apple cake. After these needed changes, my family gobbled it all up in two sittings whereas the original recipe sat on my counter for a week. Here are the changes I made:I substituted softened butter in place of the vegetable oil and used only 1 egg instead if 3 and cut back in the flour to only 1 1/2 cups. I took out the vanilla altogether and only used 1 cup of sugar. I also finely chopped the apples which really made the cake much more moist. I added a tsp of nutmeg and a 1/2 tsp of needed salt.

I made this cake for my dad's birthday celebration last night.  It was great!!  I cut sugar to 1 cup and that was plenty.  As other reviewers suggested, I added extra cinnamon and a 1/2 tsp salt.  I checked on it after baking 40 min and it was done (baked in 9x13 metal pan).  I will check next time at 30 min.  I made "Bobby Flay's Salted Caramel Sauce" (from another site) to top it and everyone loved it.

I cut the sugar to 1 cup of brown sugar instead of 1 1/2 cups white sugar, cut oil to 1/2 cup and added 1 mashed banana and 1/4 cup applesauce. I also added walnuts, raisins and frozen whole cranberries in addition to the apples called for in recipe. It was delicious, moist and not overly sweet or oily. Husband gave it 2 thumbs up and had seconds. Nice warm with some ice cream on the side. I sprinkled a small amount of cinnamon sugar over top before baking.

I made this for my office birthday treat.  Everyone liked it.  This very simple cake can serve as a breakfast coffee cake treat or a dessert.  It has a nice apple and spice flavor that everyone can enjoy.  I used Granny Smith apples.  I noticed that the dough was very stiff when I folded it into the baking pan.  I worried that I had left out some liquid ingredient because it seemed so stickey.  Don't worry, it poofs up nicely in the oven into a more cake-y texture.

This is the second time I've made this now. I reduced the sugar  to 2/3rds and substituted 1/2 the oil for apple sauce, which was sweetened, that's why I reduced the sugar content.  Very easy recipe to follow, delicious and very moist. Dusted with icing sugar whilst still warm, we were going to have it with custard but couldn't wait ha..ha.. Mine seems darker than everyone else's. I did use 2 tablespoons of cinnamon though, and think it took a little longer to bake than my 1st one, mustn't have been as thick a dough. Gave a slice to my neighbour, we will eat the rest tomorrow with the custard this time:-)

This cake was wonderful! Very moist and the nice thing is if it doesn't get eaten immediately it doesn't dry out! Also it is great without the nuts, I am allergic to nuts and sometimes by leaving them out the cake is missing something, not this cake!

This recipe was very easy and very yummy.  I have made four apple cakes in the last 2 weeks--all have been devoured by my family quickly.  The only thing I did differently was to add more cinnamon and I made a powdered sugar glaze to go over it. Thank you!

This is a great recipe! Of course being that I am Romanian myself, I had to give it a try. I've used it for countless gatherings, occasions, etc.  each time I make it, people rave about it and ask for the recipe. My mother-in-law  (who was born in Romania) also asked me for this recipe so that's how I definitely knew this was a hit. It is a moist and delicious cake! I especially like that it is not overly sweet. I usually coat the cake with powdered sugar well after it cooled off, or....... for those days when I just need the "extra something", I serve it warm out of the oven with a scoop of ice cream (preferably vanilla or butter pecan) right on top. Yum!!

I thought this was pretty good and actually better than expected. When I attempt a recipe the first time I typically cut it in half so as not to waste ingredients just in-case its not to my liking. I did the same with this recipe and baked it in a bread pan. When it was done I lightly dusted it with powdered sugar for a garnish. The batter was a tad too sweet, but was slightly balanced with the fresh apples and walnuts. I only had to take it out of the oven 5 minutes earlier due to baking a smaller portion.

This is a family pleaser! I don't use the nuts. Easy, Fast, Fresh, Good, and Not to Sweet! I use a 9x9 pan, and when it's done I turn it out onto a large plate when still warm, and with a large salad fork poke a bunch of "drain" holes in it, then I make a butter & powered sugar icing and drizzle it all over. It seeps into the holes, and YUMMY!!  We like to just use our fingers and use it as a finger bread/snack/desert.

The cake was hard and heavy.  I followed the recipe exactly.  My batter was the consistency of cookie batter.  What did I do wrong?  I may try again and bake about 30 minutes.  I might also try with apple sauce, instead of apple pieces.

Made exactly as directed.  Easy and absolutely delicious.  I used 5 large granny smith apples and chopped them fairly small.  The apple pieces took up so much of the batter I was afraid the cake would not turn out but it did and was delicious.  Will make again.

Loved this! I will add 1/4th alt next time; also, increase cinnamon to two tsps. I also added a penuche glaze made with real butter, brown sugar, milk and some confectioners sugar( see recipe elsewhere.) This is a real keeper-recipe!

Not having made apple cake before, I stuck to the recipe exactly on this one and it came out perfect.  I like the cinnamon and it's full of apples, which was what I was looking for.  It was moist and really good with coffee in the morning.  I used Macs because they are the most popular apple in my area and my favorite apple.  Definitely will be making in the future

My fiance and I really liked this cake.  It's nice and moist, and really easy to prepare!  I used Golden Delicious apples and left out the walnuts for personal preference.  I think next time I might add a little nutmeg for a tad more spice.

Great dessert.  Didn't quite come out as in the picture, but still delicious.  Definitely great for when apples are in season.

This was really good the 2nd day.  1st day it tasted way too sweet with cream cheese frosting (while recipe doesn't state frosting, the picture kind of infers it).  In any case, it was really good!

This baked up beautifully was soo simple to prepare I followed the recipe exactly except for one thing after I cut the apples I did add some lemon juice to them to keep them from discoloring while I mixed up the batter oh and I made a simple glaze for the cake with just conf sugar, vanilla, and some milk my romanian husband loved it really all of us did.. Made it last night and this morning only three pieces left will definitly make this one again thanks so much for an easy yummy treat :)

the cake was wonderful!, I changed it a little. I used baking powder instead of baking soda, also granny smith apples and I put the apples on top of the batter in the pan and sprinkled it with a little cinnamon and sugar. Also I added some nutmeg. And since I am allergic to walnuts I used pecans instead.

My wife loved this cake, even the next morning when it was cold. Personally I thought it was a little bready and bland, but it was good when it was hot and with some ice cream. I will add more cinimon next time, and maybe some cloves or something to give it a little more flavor.

This is delicious, and probably the best apple cake I've ever eaten!  It's loaded with apple flavor, the cinnamon doesn't overwhelm it, and the walnuts provide just the right amount of crunch.  A real winner here!!!

The cake is yummy! I am originally from Romania and I spent 1/2 of my life there. This is not the cake my grandmother used to make. This cake resembles the "american" cakes I very much enjoy from this website. The Romanian traditional apple cake has 3 layers, the middle one being the apples' layer, surrounded by a special kind of dough. It's very different in taste and looks...but this cake is also delicious!

This is SO good.  I've made it three times now and every time someone asks for the recipe. I've done red delicious, granny smiths and fuji apples, all were good. I made this in a spring form pan and covered with a quick powdered sugar icing to make it pretty.

This is such a good recipe, I HAD to write a review about it. REALLY EASY. I made it three times this past week, because it was that good! I recommend the recipe exactly as it is, it's very moist, and not extremely sweet. I used green apples the third time I made it, and it tasted far better than with red, yellow or even dried apples. I also tried this recipe with granulated splenda instead of sugar for my diabetic dad, and it tasted very good too.

It tasted good the first day - but way too many apples.  The cake fell apart and was terrible the next day - had to throw it all out as it became a soggy mess.

I’ve made this amazing moist cake several times in a Bundt pan or muffin tin. I always use Granny Smith apples. First time I made it my friend couldn’t get enough and must have eaten half of it! In his memory I call it Peter’s cake. Thank you so much for sharing.

Why  2 stars for a fantastic cake - the recipe itself.  Recipes that don’t specify ingredient quantities based on weight or liquid measure do the cook a huge disservice.  To specify 5 apples  when they can hugely vary in size is a recipe for  disaster.  I used what I had - large - and ended up with a massive pile of apples and the batter barely coated the apples.  Thankfully I decided to  make another ½ batch of batter.  I still used a 9x13 pan and it baked beautifully.

We loved this cake. It is a quick to make (I used one 20-oz. can of sliced apples, drained, in place of fresh), tasty spice cake. That being said, as written, I think it would be terribly bland. As I was mixing the cake, my granddaughter was waiting for the spoon so she could lick the batter. She took one taste and asked if I had forgotten something. I looked at the list -- no. It had everything in it. So I tasted the batter myself and realized it was very bland and needed some salt. I added 1/2 tsp. after finding an online recommendation to add 1/4 tsp. per cup of flour. It was perfect for us. If you are used to low-sodium or are trying to cut back, this recipe might be just right for you -- or you might want to add 1/4 tsp. of salt. Also -- my toothpick came out dry at the 42 minute mark. Keep an eye on the time! With the addition of the salt, I think this is a 5-star cake. Thank you for sharing the recipe!

Great recipe. 
I cut my apples into ~1 inch cubes instead of wedges inadvertently. I will have to try wedges next time, but the recipe as a whole is delicious and light. It didn't come out overly sweet, some of my family ate it as a breakfast cake.

Came out rubbery and tasteless on the outside and completely raw in the middle. I added some salt, cinnamon, and pumpkin spice to the batter because I thought it needed more flavor and it still was pretty tasteless. I can’t even imagine what it would’ve been like without the extra spices! I cubed the apples instead of slicing, but there was too much wrong with this recipe for that to have made much of a difference. Batter barely coated the apples anyway and anything that wasn’t raw was dry and like rubber. I don’t know how everyone else did it and liked it but it did not work at all for me!

I made it as listed then sadly realized the recipe had no salt so the cake was very bland. It tasted much better with a little salted butter on the slice and this seemed to be more of a coffee cake anyway. I recommend using salted butter in the recipe instead of the oil

This was very good. I only used four apples and that seemed like plenty. I cut the apples in slices (like a pie) rather than chucks and that gave it a neat layered look. I also reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cups and it was plenty sweet. I used a bundt pan and it released fully intact. I waited a day to serve it and it formed a nice crusty exterior, which was really nice when served warmed with ice cream. Will make again. A winner!

I made this for dessert at Columbia State Historic Park called Diggins 1852. I had rave reviews from the people that ate it. I used Granny Smith apples. The only change is I added 1/2  tsp.  of salt!

This is the recipe my mother handed down to me and is the only apple cake we will eat.  I use the tart granny smith apples in mine.  Always moist and delicious!!!

I made only a few changes, it came out so very moist and dense and wonderful!  My pan was smaller in diameter, 9x9, so it caused the cake to be thicker. I needed to bake it at the suggested 350F  for an additional 30 minutes for it to be done.  I added sliced UNPEELED apple to the top of the cake for decoration.  I doubled the walnuts, got lots of complements at the "Día de Muertos" dinner party I brought it to.  I also added a tiny bit of cinnamon extract to the vanilla.

I  creamed the oil and egg and sugar and  extracts together first until they were well blended. I tossed the sliced apples with the nuts before adding them at the end. I will make this again. All those crisp tart apples  (I used granny smith) made such an excellent celebration of Fall.

I followed the recipe completely - I'll definitely be making again, but will try chopping the apples finer or grating a couple of them - this way it's more apple and less cake, not that anyone's complaining...

Turned out great, used fresh apples from my tree instead. Also poked holes in it with a fork and poured a Carmel sauce over the cake. Was wonderful and easy will be making it again!

Great except way too much sugar! With 3/4 cup it was good. Also a bit heavy on the cinnamon and vanilla.

Make it exactly as stated. I cut the sugar once but shouldn't have since usually use my orchard apples which are all pretty tart. Delicious cake.

I made this a while back and decided to make it again today! Absolutely delicious! I had one piece and when I went back for more a couple days later, my 80 year old mother had eaten the entire cake!! She said she just couldn't help herself, it was really good!! The only thing I added was a teaspoon of vanilla to the mixture!

Wow! I really loved this recipe.  I followed it exactly, using Golden delicious apples and like others mentioned, I was afraid that 5 would be too many but it turned out great!  I highly recommend giving this one a try!

This is wonderful!!!  I have found a new cake for the holidays.  Didn't have any walnuts.  So moist and good.  Got it out of the oven and it is nearly gone.  Made a fresh pot of coffee to go with it as I was out of milk.  Told my husband that it would be good with ice cream

This was my best baking effort ever!! The cake is delicious, moist has great flavor and came out of the pan and cut like a dream. I made the whole thing in my food processor and dumped...easy!

My hubby has had a piece every time he walks in the kitchen!
I followed the recipe exactly but only used two small apples I had on hand and some ripe mango. I tossed flour, pecans and butter together and topped it before baking. Incredibly delicious. I think the reviews that thought the cake wasn't tasty used old cinnamon or not enough vanilla.

Wonderful cake recipe. I used a apple slicer and then I diced them into half inch pieces. Total apples were five cups. Added double the cinnamon than suggested which maybe wasn't necessary. Also ran out of vanilla so I got two teaspoons instead of three into the mix which was fine. No nuts. Made a drizzle with a half cup of powdered sugar and a tablespoon of milk. Everyone gobbled it right up. Thanks!

I thought this would be better if the apples were cut into smaller peices, so that in every bite you will get a piece of apple and some cake. I would make this again.

This is a recipe that I keep coming back to over and over because it's always a pleaser. Plus, it's so easy compared to other cake recipes without losing that made-from-scratch feel! It tastes great whenever, but I like it best a good 6 hours after taking it out of the oven. You can put whatever you want on the top, but everyone seems to especially love it when I drizzle a maple-caramel sauce over the top. (I don't bother with walnuts, but it cooks great without them, anyway.)

Easy and yummy!  I sliced the apples a little thinner and added a bit more cinnamon. I bet a crumb toppng would be nice touch.

Have just made this and it is fantastic. I put in sunflower oil as it was all I had and could not find walnuts so used raisins. My walnut tree is full but nuts are  not ready yet but will make this again with the right ingredients.  Not a good cook at the best of times but have just retired from nursing and now I have the time to try new stuff. Made apple jam also and am waiting for it to cool and hope it is ok as my last batch was like concrete. Regards from Hungary.

This was excellent!  I did make changes, but I think it just shows how adaptable this recipe is.  I used brown sugar instead of white and decreased it to 1 cup.  I did not have any vanilla, or nuts.  I added 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and also substituted applesauce for oil (equal amounts).  I am sure this is excellent as written, but I had to adapt because I didnt have certain items.  It was sooo good.  Cant wait to have it for breakfast with coffee :)  Thanks for sharing!

Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.  This has become my new favorite for apple cakes.  Quick and easy and so flavorful.  I shared it with my friend and her family loved it. With Fall coming I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is delicious!  The cake was moist and kept very well.  The only thing I changed was using pecans instead of walnuts as I am not a fan of walnuts.  I will definitely be making this again!

Awesome!!  I made this on a whim and it was fantastic!  If I had one of those apple corer/peeler/slicer things it would have taken less than 10 minutes to prepare. I didn't have the walnuts and it was still great.

This was pretty good, but nothing memorable. I cut the sugar to 1 c. ( no more is needed) and replaced half the oil with applesauce. I don't think I'll make this again - there are too many great recipes out there to make something mediocre.

I dotted the top with butter and extra cinnamon and brown sugar. I like it a lot and thought it was a very simple and rustic desert.

I made this cake as my birthday cake, adding mashed bananas with the wet ingredients, and then glazing with a glaze made of boiled orange juice and sugar. I baked mine in a tube pan for around 65 minutes. I would certainly make this cake again as a gift, or for company, as it presents beautifully, but if I were just making an apple cake to snack on at home, I'd go back to a recipe that involves butter. With that said, I picked this recipe because I needed a cake fast and didn't have time to wait for butter to reach room temperature :) It's great for when you can't wait for an apple cake! Thanks for the recipe.

Sorry to be the spoiler here, but I just can't give this cake a five star. The flavor was great, but the cake was dry. I am trying to figure out why and the only thing I can think of is the poster of this recipe perhaps used larger apples. I had small apples and did use 6. Maybe I needed still more for extra moisture. I know my oven is calibrated correctly. I suggest you check this cake well before the 55 minutes. I think it was probably done well before then.

Doubled the cinnamon and left out the walnuts (migraines!) and this was very good.  Definitely better the second day, when the moisture from the apples draws into the cake. There are many similar recipes to this all AllRecipes, but with the big chunks of apples in this one, it might be the easiest.

After reading the reviews, I made the following alterations: I left the peel on the apples, substituted one half cup of oil with one half cup of applesauce, so I only used one quarter cup of oil in the whole recipe; substituted one quarter cup of white sugar with brown sugar, and used one tablespoon of cinnamon.  This cake is great with breakfast or as a dessert.

I just loved this cake. I frosted it with a caramel/peanut butter icing. Got rave reviews from all that ate it. (I must admit I used 6 Macintosh apples though, not 5.) ;)

Great, easy recipe that reminded me of my grandmother's apple cake. I used McCormick's Saigon Cinnamon & Madagascar Vanilla for extra umph and substituted the nuts & apples for a large can of sliced, drained peaches. Also used butter instead of oil. In a 9x12 pan it only took 30 minutes to cook. Yummy!

This was very good.  I scaled it down to 8 servings and it worked well in an 11x7 pan (or 8x8 would work) for about 40 minutes, give or take.  (I have just made it this once and had to add to my original time)  Suggestions:  Sprinkle top with sugar before baking - I used 1-2 Tb.  - was very yummy.  Also, I cut up too many apples.  Really, the recipe should probably read "cups" instead of apples.  I only used about 1 1/2 large apples (Gala) for my 8-serving recipe.  I think I put too much flour in.  If I hadn't been lazy by scooping the measuring cup in and had spooned the flour in the cup like I was supposed to, I'm sure this would have been perfect.    Was a hit for my family!  Would taste wonderful with a side of ham.

Wow - just like I'd get when I visited the DDR as a child.  Loved it!  The baked cake is light and just lightly flavored with cinnamon.  The apples are soft and moist and the walnuts give just a bit more texture.  My husband, his co-workers, and I just ate it all up quickly!  I'm heading to the store for some more apples today to have one for home!  I used all Granny Smith and added about 1/2 c of raisins. Rustic and flavorful! Yummy!

I work for an elderly man on the weekends private duty and found this recipe that one of the regular weekday people use to make for him as a special treat.  I decided to make it but the batter turned out sooooo full of apples that I thought that I had done something wrong--necessitating yet another trip to Allrecipes to see if I could find a similar recipe and whether I had, indeed, made it correctly.  While looking for and eventually finding this recipe--the cake came out of the oven--just as wonderful as I remember it from my weekend gig and my husband tore into it--he's currently on his second piece and I love it, too.  The gal to whom the recipe belongs also told me it's a somewhat forgiving recipe--she's made it with Splenda, with whole wheat flour, even with one less egg once and generally got a good cake.  My house smells so heavenly right now!!  Love it.

It can't get much easier than this!  Simple, tasty, quick.  Not a glamourous dessert but it's just right for a casual supper or a snack cake.  I can see this being a big hit with bake sales, etc.  I followed the recipe as written but made a 1/2 batch and baked it in an 8x8 pan.

I HAVE A COOKING GROUP WITH DISABLED PEOPLE AND WE PICK A RECIPE FROM A DIFFERENT COUNTRY EACH WEEK.  THIS WEEK IT WAS ROMANIA AND WE MADE THE ROMANIAN APPLE CAKE. IT WAS GREAT. I DID THE PREPERATION AND THEY PUT THE INGREDINETS TOGETHER.  I HAD TO MAKE ONE ADJUSTMENT AND NOT USE NUTS. BECAUSE OF ALLERGIES BUT I DID USE RAISINS AND WE DIDN'T MISS THE CRUNCH AT ALL.  ALSO I ONLY USED 1 CUP OF SUGAR AND THAT WAS FINE. WE DID PUT A WHIPPED TOPPING ON THE TOP AND SERVED WARM.  ONCE AGAIN IT WAS A HUGE SUCCESS BEING THESE CLIENTS DON'T GET TO TRY NEW THINGS.

What a great recipe! After reading other reviews, and then trying this recipe out myself, I also thought there were way too many apples.. But I was wrong. :) The batter expands, so once it bakes, it doesn't seem like too many at all, and they definitely make the overall cake more moist.  Some changes I made :  1) For the apples, I used 3 Golden Delicious and 2 Granny Smith, and I didn't peel any of them. 2) I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 1/2 c white sugar. 3) Alongside the cinnamon and vanilla, I also added nutmeg, lemon extract, and cocoa (which added a GREAT light chocolately taste). With all those ingredients, I never measure exactly.. I just kind of use my best judgement. But I would guess that I used about 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tbsp lemon, and 2-3 tbsp cocoa. 4) Finally, I didn't add walnuts (although I definitely would in the future - I was just making this for my bf's house and he doesn't really like nuts in cakes), but instead I added raisins. Once again, didn't measure how much.. but I would guess 3/4 c.  My only complaint is that the batter was kind of difficult to mix.. and then once I added the apples it was REALLY difficult to mix. Was a bit discouraging - thought I did something wrong.. But the  cake came out great. :) Thanks for the recipe! Will definitely make this one again.

Was looking for something not terribly sweet to fix after all the Christmas goodies. This was perfect. I did make a carmel glaze for the people that wanted a little extra sweetness added to theirs.

This is fantastic. Wow. I could have eaten the whole thing  myself. I drizzeled a butter and sugar mixture over the warm cake  as a glaze. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is a delicious cake. 
We have many friends in Europe and have stayed in their homes and eaten their homemade food. Unlike American cakes, this has all of the earmarks of a cake from Europe- simple, real ingredients and not overly sweet. 
Like a previous reviewer, my daughter and I made this for a 5th grade International Day luncheon. All of the kids liked it!
We made this cake with Pippin apples, which is my favorite pie apple. When I make this recipe next time, I will add a 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt, though it is just fine without it.

Thanks for submitting this recipe.  My family loved it!  The only change I would make the next time is I would cut the apples smaller.

This was a great cake.  I am not a nut fan and did not include them either.  My son was doing a report on Romainia and I am glad that this is a really from there.  They all liked it and I was lucky to get a piece.  One of the children liked it so well he wrote it down for his mother.  It was so easy to make and used ingrediants that most people would have at hand.  Will make again for my family.

I was recently given a bunch of apples and have been searching for recipes to use these apples up.  I had never had romanian apple cake before so I'm not sure if this is what it's supposed to tast like, but I didn't care much for this recipe.

This recipe reminds me of one my Romanian Grandma used to make.  This cake is dee-Lish and very easy to perpare!  Try it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream...yummy!
