Using turkey bacon will work well, this will cut down on the saltyness and the fat. Marinate the shrimp in advance with Italian dressing for more flavor, about 15 minutes.

I wanted to like these so much. I made them over a month ago and have tried to figure out what I disliked - but the truth was that I disliked the flavor. I made 2 minor changes - I used roasted green peppers instead of red peppers - though I did use a sweet variety. I also used a hard turkey ham instead of prosciutto. I use the turkey ham all the time, so I don't think that was the reason either. Sorry Nicholas - I wanted to love them!

I really wanted to like this !  It sounded like a very exciting recipe.   I made a few just to try them and found them a bit bland and salty.   I even tried sprinkling the shrimp with garlic powder and that made them a little better but for the effort they take to make I won't be making them again..  Sorry Nicolas...

Hubby really liked it, but thought it was salty. I thought the ham gave it a weird twang. He liked that I tried something different! Thanks & join us on the recipe exchange! *NR*

My family loved this. We didn't use the red pepper and used Italian-flavored bread crumbs for more flavor. We also used our deep fryer to cook them quickly and that made the coating very crunchy. We will definitely make them again.
