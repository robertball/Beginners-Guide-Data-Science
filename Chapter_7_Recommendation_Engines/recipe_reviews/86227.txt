This was quite good. I used an addition 6 oz can of salmon. When you finish picking out the bones and undesireable stomach fat, there isn't enough salmon left. Since I use sweet onions I increased to 1 cup. Green bell pepper is a little strong for this mild recipe and I would reduce to 1/3 cup next time. One dash of hot sauce is not enough. I use Frank's because it does not linger in your mouth. I used four dashes of hot sauce but should have used 5 to 6.

I converted this recipe for 100 people to use for a community soup kitchen, and it was a smash hit!  I was  a bit concerned about using the hot pepper sauce, but I needn't have worried...the salmon loaf was not spicy at all. It was delicious!  The only thing we did differently was sprinkled crushed crackers and melted butter over the top. It was so well liked that everyone was asking for the recipe! Thanks LeChefRene, we will definitely be making this again!

Four star salmon loaf, without a doubt. Add a tablespoon of chopped fresh dill and you've got a five-star on your hands. Thanks for sharing this one!

This was excellent! I actually left out the crackers altogether because I'm on a low-carb diet and it turned out just great. After the 45 minutes, I broiled it for 8 minutes or until it browned. I also made a drizzly sauce out of the juice from the can. I put in a little no fat sour cream, pepper, and lime and drizzled it over a slice while it was still boiling. It was the perfect addition. It did feel gourmet!!!

Best salmon loaf I ever had. It's a great dish to take to potlucks & such. Everyone (that likes salmon) raves! The first time I made it, I accidently used twice the milk it called for & I think I like it better with more milk. Then I served it with a red chili mayo. DELISH! Thank you!

this was delicious. I think it needs some kind of a light, creamy lemony sauce - I will have to play around with a sauce for next time.  I used 2 frozen (cooked) filets (from the big bag from Sam's Club) broken up with a fork & it was the perfect amount of salmon. cooked it in an 8x8 pan. don't omit the hot sauce, it gives it just a hint of spice that is a nice complement to the fish.

Made this last night for my "not-too-fond-of-fish" DH.  He said it was OK, translation, excellent.  I did make some substitutions based on what I had on hand.  I precooked 2 frozen salmon filets in the microwave instead of using canned; used red bell pepper instead of green and used blended stove top stuffing crumbs instead of saltines.  I used the loaf pan as recommended by others.  Served with rice and asparagus, all it was missing was a dill sauce that I will add next time.  I thought it was superb!

Being from Alaska, I used my own canned Copper River Red Salmon in this recipe, it was great. The only thing I added was in the last 15 minutes I topped it with french fried onions and shredded cheddar cheese. This complimented the flavor very nicely with the crunch.

I felt this recipe had way to many crackers in it.  Tasted a bit dry and bland.  I would make it again and add an extra egg and 1/2 the crackers

This Salmon loaf lives up to it's name! I used two eggs, a little more milk and less crackers. I also added some dried parsley, about 1 large teaspoon, and used red, yellow and orange pepper instead of green. I added 1/2 of cheese crumbles to the mix, yum! My husband does not usually run wild after salmon loaf, loved this, and ate two helpings.

I made this for dinner tonight and we just loved it. I usually make salmon pie but I really think this is much better and easier. Did not change a thing. Thank you for the great recipe. Will be making this often.

I loved it! I have tons of salmon in the freezer from a fishing trip and I'm trying to fix it in as many different ways as possible. This recipe has been my favorite so far. I used red bell pepper instead of green because the selection of green peppers looked terrible that day. Other than that I didn't change a thing, and I thought it tasted great!

This is a wonderful alternative to my usual salmon cakes--tastes delicious, and no messy frying with oil!  I omitted the sauces suggested and used a bit of lemon juice.  I also added a tad more milk, as the mixture was a bit dry. I'll be making it again--simple and tasty!

I would've only given it two stars but my family enjoyed it more than I did. I thought it would be moister and tastier. But, like I said, the hubby and kids said it was good. In addition, I grated a carrot finely and added that as well as a peeled and seeded chopped tomato and a little chopped garlic.  It was interesting to try but I don't think I'll be making it again.

Easy to make. I sauteed a small green pepper, one jalapeno, 2 cloves of garlic, and the onion.  Then I added everything else plus some chili powder.  Next time I may add cumin. I did not use the hot sauce since I added a jalapeno.  Oh, and I only used one cup of breadcrumbs instead of 1.5 cups of saltines. As another reviewer noted, it was pretty thin in an 8X8 pan, so next time I will form a loaf like a meatloaf.  Worth trying!

My picky eater asked for seconds! 
I did do a few substitutions for this recipe. I used 1 1/2 cups of oatmeal instead of crushed saltines. Also, I omitted the bell pepper and onion, but added 2 1/2 tablespoons of salsa. It had a wonderful flavor and turned out beautifully. 
I served this recipe with my homemade cheater dill sauce. 3 heaping tbsp hellman's mayo. 1 tbsp kosher dill pickle juice and dill weed.

Very good salmon loaf recipe. My two year old loved it! It was a little dry, perhaps next time I will use less bread crumbs? Definitely a keeper.

This was tasty but a little dry. I decided to use an 8x8 dish rather than 9x9 and am glad I did. Maybe I "pressed" too much but it was still rather thin. I will try again but use either less crackers or more liquid.

this was forgetable. way to dry using that much cracker crumbs I would cut back on the crackers and use a little more milk.

Made this recipe exactly as directed and I found it a bit dry and bland. Hubby and the kids didn't care much for it either but my grandmother was glad to take the rest home, not something I'd make again

We liked it! Much better than mother used to make. I read some of the reviews and decided to add just 1 cup crushed saltines, instead of 1.5 as called for in the recipe. Also used several dashes of hot sauce and lots of fresh ground black pepper.

It was a big hit!!!! My family truly enjoyed it. I did make some minor changes. Since I didn't have bell peppers, I left it out of the recipe. However, I added some dill and parsley. Additionally, I made salmon muffins shaped loaves, and they were perfect.

I followed the recipe, except I had 2 6 oz. cans of wild Alaska salmon - so I scaled back a little bit of everything, except for the egg & milk.  I got the salmon at our local discount warehouse store - skinless & boneless as advertised on the cans!  I also put it in a small loaf pan as others advised, as it would have been way too thin.  Husband ate seconds - and he doesn't normally like fish, so that is a hearty endorsement of this recipe.  :)

My 6 yo loved this and wanted 3rds but my husband and I merely thought it was okay. I did have to make a few changes based on what was on hand (1c. fresh bread crumbs and capful of liquid smoke in lieu of Worcestershire). I'd be willing to try this again using Ritz crackers. Also, the Trader Joe's 14 oz salmon has a gazillion little bones in it - I would definitely find canned salmon w/o bones to make this recipe faster.

Delicious!!!  Will definately add this recipe to my regular recipe routine.  I added 1 T. dill (per comment below), 1 - 2 T. lemon juice, and since I didn't have crackers or bread crumbs I used Old Fashioned Oats and increased the milk a bit to keep it from drying out (from comment below).

I give it 5 stars...with conditions..Absolutely delicious. I did find that in even in a 8 x 8 pan it's very thin so a bit dry even tho I doubled the milk as one viewer suggested. I think it will be moister when I cook it in a loaf pan the next time. I also added 2 teaspoons of dill! Can't wait to share it with friends.

Recipe had way too many crackers! It was very, very dry. I would add more liquid, mixing some of Salmon liquid with milk to make 3/4 cup and also make it in load pan not a 9x9.

Used four 5 oz cans pink salmon. Used panko bread crumbs instead of crackers and added 2 eggs. I don't like salmon but this was delicious!

I loved the salmon loaf. Best one I have had. I did however ,add a bit of grated cheddar and French fried onions during the last 15 minutes. And it was wonderful.

Well, its hardly the same recipe, but I needed a starting place.  

I put... 
2 cans, Wild caught Trader Joe’s salmon drained,
2 Eggs
4 pieces dried sourdough bread In chunks
1 Harvest veggie bag frozen from Trader Joe’s.
1 Cup milk
Salt, pepper, coriander, cumin, turmeric, rosemary, shallots, coriander, ginger, garlic, onion, mustard

After 35 minutes of baking, I pulled it out and covered top with a lemon caper sauce and baked another 25 minutes.  

It’s really good.  

I just needed a base for how much moisture, how long to bake.  It is very easy to tweak.  So many possibities...

I had some leftover grilled salmon (about a pound), so I used that instead of canned. I used two cut up slices of bread instead of the crackers and increased to two eggs. I made a simple lemon-dill yogurt sauce to go with it.  Easy and tasty. I will make it again.

Quite good, the only changes I made were to substitute bread crumbs for crackers, lemon pepper and added a little dill.  I also increased the amount of salmon used and the milk.  I would definitely make this again.

This is the closest recipe I could find to the one I remember my mom making when I was a kid.  I of course made my own modifications by using the salmon juice from the can, lemon juice, lemon pepper, onion salt, extra eggs, milk crushed saltine crackers and Worcestershire sauce. I omitted the green pepper and put some parsley instead.  Whipped it up in the food processor and baked in greased loaf pan.  Loved this as a sandwich with mayonnaise as a kid !

Such a great recipe to get more salmon in our diet. My kids (3 and 5) love this. I add one more egg and a bit more milk (a few extra tablespoons) because the first time it was a bit dry. So tasty!

I added 4 tbs of melted butter and sprinkled dill on top. It was a hit with my group.
