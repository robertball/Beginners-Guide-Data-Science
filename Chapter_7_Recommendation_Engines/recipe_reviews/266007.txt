Don't be afraid people! Try these. You will be amazed at how good they are. I use my round hand chopper and finely chop the eggs and Spam at the same time. Then stir in everything else and you're ready to broil. The mixture keeps in the refrigerator for days so you can pop them in the broiler at the spur of the moment. Line the sheet pan with foil and you don't even have a pan to wash!
