This just didn't work out for me at all.  It was too thin because in order to incorporate the cream cheese with the whipped topping, the whipped topping lost all its air.  I like the concept of this recipe, and I might try to work with it again in the future; however, as it is written it didn't work out.

I was planning on using this recipe on cupcakes, but it was a little too runny.  But, still tasted wonderful!

I used it on the pineapple upside down cake (I left out the pineapple pie filling), and it was delicious!

turned out perfectly for me.  The pineapple pie filling makes the recipe.  Thanks!
