i thought i would try this recipe as it has no refined sugar, but i was very dissapointed in the results. the kids could not play with it because it was to oily to roll out, so i added powdered sugar to it which only made it very sticky and tacky from the honey i am guessing. i did not follow the other review about using flour because i thought it would make it taste to bad for the kids to enjoy eating it after playing with it. i will try some other recipes that i have found.--update-- i covered dough in powdered sugar and wrapped in wax paper, let it sit for a few days. was okay to work with but still very oily.

I made this with few modifications; I reduced the honey to 1 cup as some reviews said the dough was to sticky; also I didn't have any powdered milk so I used confectioner's sugar (2 cups).  I found the dough was still a little too sticky so I added about a 1/2 cup wheat bran.  It turned out great and the kids thought it was so cool that they could eat the play dough after they were done.

I gave this a 4 because it is too sticky/oily when made exactly like this, although it may depend on the kind of peanut butter you use. I like to add oatmeal, raisins or craisins, seeds or nuts, even some ground flax meal to make it even more nutritious. Can shape into balls and refrigerate or press into a pan and cut into squares. My husband and I love them as a quick breakfast, and our 1-yr-old son can't get enough of them!

You can increase or decrease this for the number of kids you have...just keep everything in equal parts. If you want the dough to be a little firmer, add some flour.

I doubled the powdered milk, and it is tasty, workable, and fun!  My five year old loves it.  :)

This was okay. My daughter & her cousin thought it was fun to play with (& eat!), but they didn't ask for more. I thought it could've tasted better, and it was a bit oily like other reviewer said.

definitely too sticky.  this should have more of the milk powder or another dry ingredient added.  i've also used crushed graham crackers, rolled into an oval for a body of a bee, chocolate chips for eyes, and sliced almonds for wings.  you can also melt chocolate chips, put them into a baggie, snip off the tip, and make stripes on the body.  it's a big hit with my kids!

My 2 1/2 year old loves this - I didn't have any powered milk so I used fat-free dry coffee creamer and it worked fine. She is having a ball making all kinds of treats with it.

This is so great. It kept my toddler occupied every time I made it. The second time that I made it , I had to add more milk powder probably because this time I used fat-free milk powder? Awesome taste too.

My Mom used to be an art teacher and would make this for the elementary kids.  The kids loved it so I decided to try and make it for my family (only I couldn't find her recipe so I looked it up here).  Two cups of honey is to much.  Instead I cut it down to 1 cup honey.  The amounts of the other ingredients are perfect.  The taste and texture is good.  The kids love it.  My daughter usually eats it up right away instead of playing with it.  I also like to add a few handfuls of oatmeal to it.  When added to the dough it makes a perfect breakfast that I know the kids will eat.  Thanks for the recipe.

Loved this recipe, but it was way too sticky. I read other reviews and made changes. These are the changes that I made. I doubled the powdered milk. (I used powdered creamer, because I did not have powdered milk.) I added about four tbsp. flour to firm it up, but it was still too sticky for me. So, I poured some flour onto the counter and placed the dough on top of it. Then, I added more flour and kneaded it like real dough. This did the trick! Just keep adding flour until you are satisfied with the texture! Wonderful! My little girl enjoyed eating it more than playing with it!!

Add 2 cups oatmeal for a different version that is healthier and less sticky.  Equal parts powdered milk, honey, pb, and oatmeal!

All this recipe needed was an extra cup of the dried milk.  After that, it was perfect!  The kids LOVED it:)  I have a day care in my home, and we combined snack time with craft time. Will use again and again.  Thanks!

I don't know about playdough, but this was my favorite thing to make while in elementary school.  I had it for a snack at least once a week and could easily make it myself.  I'm a little shocked to see it on here!

This recipe is a good base, but it needs some tweaking. I made red play dough for my 18 month old and started with this recipe. When I finished, it was a globby mess. (You can see it in a photo above.) For one, even with adding 4 drops of food coloring - which did not stain anything- it still looked pink. And for a second, I had to add corn starch to make it not-so-globby. I pulled out a hand full of the glob and added about 1/4 cup of corn starch to it. ( Just guessing because I wasn’t measuring.) After a bit of mashing (which I did inside of plastic bags) it came out to something like play dough. Don’t use flour to thicken it because that will make it too stiff to play with. Like others have said, it is “edible” as in it won’t harm your kid unless they eat tons of it, but it’s basically salt dough, so don’t eat it for a snack or anything. Hope this helps and have fun! ( p.s. - In the picture, the small ball on top is after adding the corn starch and the big bag of globby mess is in the bottom bag.)

I only made one serving of this for my 3 year old, which is 1/2 c each peanut butter and powdered milk, but I only put in 2 T honey. It was oily (I used natural peanut butter) and a little difficult to spread out. I put some flour down for her to roll it out on and floured her hands a bit. I didn't think it tasted that great, but she had a great time playing with it and eating it.
