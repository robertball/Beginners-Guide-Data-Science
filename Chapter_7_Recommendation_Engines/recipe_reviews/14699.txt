Very good mix of flavors, very tasty, I will certainly make this again. I added a peach half for each pork chop.

I found the microwave quite suspect as cooking method so I browned the chops while I made the sauce in a saucepan, combined everything and put in the oven for 20 minutes, and added the peaches for the last couple of minutes.

I made this recipe in a pan on the stove, instead of in the microwave, and it was great.  Though I did find that I had to make like 3 or 4 times as much sauce for the amount of meat, but that might just be because I like lots of sauce.

I give this a 4 star only because i modfied the cooking method only. Microwave cooking is not our thing so i browned the pork tenderloin on the stove then removed the pork and sauteed the sliced onions.While that was sauteing,I made the sauce in the sauce pan.Then returned the meat in the casserole dish where the onions had finished caramelizing. I poured the sauce  (I had a cup of peach syrup to use up and we love our gravies so why not make more) on top of the meat and covered it and baked it for 40 minutes at 350F. Served it with stove top fried diced potatoes and the canned peaches uncooked.

Nice combination of ingredients but I added more chili for more piquancy.  Like Luds, I too find microwave cooking iffy.  I love the micro for reheating but I like browned meat so I adapted the recipe for stove-top cooking.  Fresh peaches, not canned, 'make' this chop dish.

I don’t care for microwaved meat so I decided to cook this in a pan on the stove as other reviewers had. I adjusted the pork, onions and peaches to two servings but kept the sauce as written as I wanted lots of sauce. I sprinkled crushed red chili flakes on the pork and let sit while I sautéed the onions. Pushed the onions to the side and browned the pork in the same pan. Then added the sauce, to which I added cornstarch, and the peaches. I was afraid it would be too sweet but it was just right. It was tasty surprise and I will be making again.

Cooked on stove.  Cook pork chops, when almost done add onions and peaches, cook until onions are tender.  Add sauce (Mix approx. 1 tblsp. cornstarch into the sauce before adding to pan.)

This was a great blend of flavors. I omitted the chili peppers, because my husband will not eat spicy food and just added it to my plate and my sons plate. Everyone loved it. :-)

We weren't wild about this recipe either.  Not sure what it was missing, but it was missing a zing.  Maybe the canned peaches are a bit bland for a balanced flavor.

I didn't really like this recipe. It just wasn't the right combination of flavors.  I also wanted the sauce to make some kind of syrupy gravy, but it never did, no matter how much flour.
