I thought this  was one of the easiest recipes I have ever made.  Instead of using water, I used chicken broth.  It turned out wonderful!  Very easy and very delicous.  Thanks for the wonderful addition to my recipe box!  A+

I have to give this 4 stars the way it is written. I cooked one the by the recipe and one with the changes I made. The changes I did was 1- use chicken broth 2- saute fresh garlic, celery and onion add it to the mix. 3-add poultry seasoning. Done this way it is great.

First of all...I don't like to rate recipes if I"ve made changes and that's why I'm only giving it 4 stars. Secondly, I'm very picky about stuffing.  I added about an 1/8 tsp. or so of poutry seasoning and used chicken broth instead of water, just because another reviewer said it was bland. Otherwise, I followed the recipe and it was delicious. I used Stove Top Sage flavored for the stuffing mix. Very easy and has a nice homemade taste. I wouldn't serve it for Thanksgiving dinner but for a quick stuffing it's awesome.

Yes this recipe was easy but it was not very good at all. I am glad that I did a trial run before the big day. It tasted like you made stovetop and just added bread so it would go farther. Over all not very good at all.

That's was so simple and delicious for a friendsgiving dinner. I used the Stovetop with sage mix, mixed in celery, onions, chicken broth (instead of water) and only 6 pieces of whole wheat sugar free bread.

Sorry - I did not like this at all. Came out very dry and not very flavorful. No more shortcuts for me!

I added some chicken stock and butter.  Took it to a work potluck and it got devoured!   Can't wait to make it again for Thanksgiving.

This is how I? am making stuffing from now on! So easy - tho I? made just a couple adjustments: I? added about 3/4 cup diced sautéed onions, 1/2 t sage (as I? used the “turkey” stovetop), and 1/2 t celery salt. Also replaced the water with chicken broth. Definitely not bland, definitely going to show up at holiday dinners from now on!

I saw this awhile back but didn't use it. I found myself with leftover cheddar bay biscuits from this site when I made too many and the guests were doing low-carb. They hardened and I still couldn't bring myself to throw them out!  Long story short, this recipe came to mind. I cut the hard biscuits up and used them instead of bread, added eggs and Old Bay Seasoning with enough water to mix. Baked as called for and it was just fabulous. I know it doesn't follow the recipe, but I never would've thought of it on my own so giving all the credit anyway!

Definitely will make this again I added some extra butter and onions. Delicious stuffing, moist without being oily or mushy.

I made this using squaw bread and sunflower honey wheat bread, toasted. I added some craisins and walnuts, and used Old Bay for the seasoning. This turned out delicious!
