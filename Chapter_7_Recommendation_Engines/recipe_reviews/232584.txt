Really great recipe!  I followed it more closely than I normally do with recipes, but I did make a couple of minor adjustments...I more than doubled the amount of (spicy) curry powder because we like strong flavors, substituted extra virgin olive oil for the butter (next time I might try coconut oil instead to add a hint of sweetness), and I cooked the rice and pea mixture on the stovetop and broiled the tilapia fillets with the almonds on the top rack of my oven. Other than that I followed it exactly and was extremely happy with how it turned out...even my picky(ish) seven year old ate a whole plate of it!

I tried this recipe and loved how easy it was to prepare and it was very tasty. I cooked as directed but made some addirions/changes. I increased the following: onion 1/2 cup, 1 cup rice, 2 TBS curry powder. I added the following: 1 TSP onion powder, 1/2 TSP garlic powder and 1/2 packet of Sazon. Fantastic and quick!

Had to create an account to rate this recipe. I barely ever use recipes and usually just make my own , but this is what I live for. The easiest meals that are nutritious and simple to cook. Great easy recipe, only thing I tweaked was curry powder because I love lots of spice. This can probably be done in rice cooker too.

This was a wonderful and easy recipe, with a nice flavor and texture that I plan on making again.  

My tweaks were sweating  1/2 cup diced onion, 1/2 cup diced green pepper, 1 carrot peeled and diced and 1 tablespoon minced garlic  in the butter first for about 10 minutes. Then I added 2 cups of unsalted chicken stock and a whole tablespoon of curry powder. No salt! Brought to a boil, added 1 cup white rice, placed my cut up cod fillets on top and then simmered on low with lid for 20 minutes. After 20, I removed from heat and let it continue to steam without lifting lid for another 10. Folded in 1 cup canned drained peas while fluffing the rice, and added 2 tablespoons coconut aminos (a low sodium soy substitute). served with unsalted dry roasted peanuts. DELICIOUS!

Used brown rice. Not sure if that's why it took so much longer to cook. Added more water during cooking. Also added raisins.  I think it was a little bland so I might experiment more, and will definitely check out more of the other reviews to get tips. Overall it was a success, and a great way to use fish a little differently.

If you enjoy Indian food then you will need to add more spice.  Very quick dish to prepare.

This recipe gives “boring plain fish” an incredible boost of taste and texture. I substituted some Tom Yum broth for the water, mixed veg and toasted hazelnuts because it was what I had on hand and boosted the curry powder to suite my taste. Served with a dab of Major Grey’s chutney, too.  So fast and ridiculously easy, too!

I made this as written, except I added extra peas and used brown rice. (It did take longer than 20 minutes for ours to cook.)  We enjoyed it. This recipe lends to creative variations. I would now like to try some of the suggestions by other reviewers such as ginger, Old Bay seasoning, raisins, mushrooms, celery, broccoli, and bell peppers, but  not all together. As we are trying to add more fish to our diet, this will be a nice addition to our go to recipes.

Thoroughly enjoyed the recipe. I followed the modifications listed by Tam in the reviews [2 tbs curry powder, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 packet low sodium Sazon with culantro and achiote]. I also added 1/8 tsp ginger, 1/8 tsp white pepper, 1 red bell pepper, 1 green bell pepper, 1 yellow bell pepper, and more onions. I also ut in a dash of smoked paprika for added flavor. I used tilapia as my fish and marinated it in a soy vinaigrette before cooking. It came out really tasty and very tender.

Hate to rate when I didn't follow recipe exactly but this was excellent . Changes were...I dislike peas so I added some chopped fresh broccoli when about 10 minutes left to cook. I also sautéed mushrooms and celery along with the onion before adding the water and curry powder. Lots of flavour...thanks for the great recipe.

So I followed most of the recipe, I tend to tweak ingredients based on what I have! I used Swai fillets to start, and since I had brown rice I used chicken broth to cook instead of water. Also I used red curry paste instead of powder and I doubled the amount after reading comments about it being bland. Unfortunately I didn't realize I ran out of almonds but I will definitely use them next time! I lightly seasoned the fillets with old bay and swapped the peas with half a bag of Cole slaw mix I was trying to get rid of! I am currently scarfing down the deliciousness

I made this with canned peas and carrots since that's the only veg I had on hand other than fresh. I followed the recipe but found I needed to add more salt. Maybe seasoning the fish first would help but overall I liked it and would make it again (and my hubby liked it too and he hates trying new things!!!)

Very bland, even though I added 1.5 tbsp curry, some garlic powder, black pepper, salt, 2 diced garlic cloves, and other veggies like bell pepper and zucchini.
