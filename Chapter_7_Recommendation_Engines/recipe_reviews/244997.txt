I'll make a more detailed comment as soon as I sober up. The receipe turned out awesome. I doubled the amount and have it setting on a shelf waiting for it to cure [abut 4-6 weeks] However, I did have to sample it a bit. Maybe a bit too much LOL>

I make this every year to give as gifts at Christmas. the only thing different that I do is use a little bit more vanilla, always pure vanilla not artificial vanilla extract, and 100 proof (50%) vodka... If you can't find 100 proof then regular 80 proof (40%) will do. Don't skimp on the cheap stuff use a decent brand. It makes a difference in the taste of your end result. Easy, cheaper than store-bought and everyone that loves Kahlua will love this and be asking for more. Cheers!

I made mine with vodka and regular coffee, very smooth and really tastes like the expensive Kahlua at the  store
