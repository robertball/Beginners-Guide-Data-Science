I only had plain panko bread crumbs so I added Italian seasoning. Flavor was good but potatoes came out a bit dry/pasty. Perhaps a little more added broth and/or butter would help.

Very flavorful. Fairly easy to fix. I think I'll use an electric mixer to mash the potatoes next time and cut the breadcrumbs in half. It may have been because my potatoes were smaller. I'll definitely fix it again.
