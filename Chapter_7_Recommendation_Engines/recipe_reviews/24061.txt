I made this for a party and it wasn't as hard as I thought it would be. The buttercream, ganache and coffee syrup were easy. The cake was a little difficult because the recipe says to cut each cake in half and they came out so thin already. I think next time I would bake the cake in a regular depth pan and then cut each layer to the desired thickness. Anyway, everyone loved it!

This cake turned out ok but the recipe could use a few tweeks to make it better. First I'd do the ganache first so it has enough time to cool. Then the recipe leaves out that you have to whip the ganache to make it into a filling consistancy. The buttercream is so thick it's like eating a stick of butter, use more sugar, less butter. And the cake could be better with fewer eggs too.

I was making this for a buffet, so instead of baking it in rectangular pans, I made it in loaf pans, and I make it with three layers instead of two.  The loaf pan shape made it easier to slice in thin slices for a smaller size protion (this is a rich dessert and you do not need a large slice anyway) It was pretty easy to make and really worth it, every raved about it!

I found that the joconde layers were a little too thick, and will try spreading the batter on three sheet pans next time.  A previous reviewer commented that the layers were too thin to cut, but I believe the author expects us to cut them in half to create 10 x 7.5 inch rectangles, not torte them.  Otherwise, it was clear and easy to follow.  Thanks!

I first tried the Opera while on a cruise on my honeymoon. I was very excited to find a recipe for it, but this turned out nothing like the dessert I had.  The eggs in the cake were extremely overwhelming. They didn't add anything to the recipe, and it seemed like I was baking an omelet. The ganache was very good, but I would add less butter to the buttercream to make it more spreadable (as suggested by another reviewer). I wanted to like this. Overall I wasted a lot of time and ingredients, and now I'm trying to come up with a last minute dessert to have for Christmas.
