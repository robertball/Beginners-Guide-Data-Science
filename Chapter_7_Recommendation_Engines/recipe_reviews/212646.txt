I enjoyed this dish.  My family are not chicken eaters and I love chicken.  This was a very moist chicken dish.  The gravy was a bit thick - next time I may add some milk.  The gravy will be good on toast. Next time I will add sliced onion and mushroom.

Great, I just made this for dinner and everyone loved it. I did not have any ham and it still came out wonderful. I seared chicken in pan then added gravy mixture and put in oven covered. Chicken was so moist and flavorful gravy.
