Reading the reviews about having to add more flour and how wet the mixture was I pulled out my scale to work with the recipe knowing we all measure flour differently. Following the recipe, I reduced the water to 3 cups and (weighing the flours) put in 339 grams whole wheat flour (113 per cup) and 4 cups, 480 grams all flour (120 per cup).

Great texture and taste. It could be user error but I did have to add 1 1/4 cups more flour to make it come together and leave the sides of the pan, user error maybe? I made two changes, I added 1 tbs of Vital Wheat Gluten and I halved the recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

I ended up having to add more flour. It tasted a little bland, so I will be adding either honey or molasses next time.

I had to add flour as well to get it to come together. But it turned out great, wonderful soft texture and great flavor

The recipe calls for far too much water. Added extra flour but the bread still didn't turn out well. I've had much better luck with other recipes.

We loved the result, but had to add an additional cup of whole wheat flour to keep it from being too moist to knead well. We're on our fourth batch now. It is especially delicious when the slices are toasted.

I made it and I too had to add 1 1/2 cups flour. The bread made 2 large loaves is tasty.  I will make it again with the necessary adjustments!

The water measurement is way too much.  By the time I added more flour, it is difficult to say what the original flavor should have been.  If I make it again, I will cut the water by at least a cup.

It came out OK, the flavor is very delicate.  Next time I will try adding more things to give it a more robust taste.  OMG I was dumping in so much extra flour it was truly distressing.  I think the added flour took away from the salt and brown sugar tastes.  It would be nice if the creator of this recipe adjusted the ingredients’ measurements.

Great taste as is, but agree with other reviewers had to add some more flour than listed.

Loved it. It took an hour to rise, and I added honey, flaxseed, oats, and a bit more flour than suggested by the recipe because it does, indeed, get gooey otherwise, like other reviewers suggested. Also, I used my hands instead of a mixer, and it was fine.

great, easy way to make bread w/out a bread machine. I found this recipe fast and straight forward. I did add some oats and flax seed for texture. I needed to add additional flour to work with dough. my kids loved it, and that is high praise :)
