These were very tasty made exactly as written.  Next time I'll put another cup of white cheddar mixed in the potatoes, but that is just a personal preferance.

I made these for Thanksgiving and they were AWESOME!  We put 2.5 cups of cheddar on the top, but that was the only change.  I can't wait to make them again.

This is a yummy, comforting potato casserole.  And, it was extremely quick and easy to make (I used a mandolin to the slice the potatoes).   I rough chopped 12 large cloves of garlic (I'm addicted to the stuff), and used yellow cheddar.  I added a little salt and pepper too.  I covered the dish with tinfoil and baked it for 45 minutes, then uncovered it/baked it for another 15.  This recipe is a keeper.

I am not sure if I did something wrong, but the cheese burned well before the potatoes got done.  It was dry and crusty.

These were good but they needed some salt and pepper; it was kind of bland. I baked them uncovered for an hour and the potatoes were still hard, so covered them and baked them another 30 minutes or so. If you have one, using a mandolin to slice the potatoes is a great idea. Overall good.

Good texture and flavor. I used what I had on hand--medium yellow cheddar cheese instead of sharp white, and green onions instead of chives. I also added a couple of shakes of black pepper. It would have benefited from the salt and bite of a sharper cheese as written, but was still deserving of 4 stars as I made it.

DELICIOUS!!!  I also added more cheese on top as well as in the potato mixture (are all cheese freaks).  Just a little salt a pepper and it was perfect!  Thanks for sharing Knudsen.
