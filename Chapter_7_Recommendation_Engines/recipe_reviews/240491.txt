I have to admit that I just microwaved frozen chopped collards then added the other ingredients. But the combination of ingredients is so tasty and I wouldn't have thought of it without this recipe, so thanks! I'm sure it's even better when cooked according to the instructions.

Made this for our New Years dinner tonight. My family loved them! I'll be making these all of the time now.

I love these greens. I donâ€™t use any oil. I did use brown sugar and add a can of chopped tomatoes and a quarter of a chopped onion.  I got the chopped tomatoes from another greens recipe and it seemed odd until I read the reviews.

Delicious! I really like the flavor of the apple cider vinegar. The only change is I tossed in a can of drained cannellini beans at the end. I also cooked these in the pressure cooker (it took 1 hour for anyone interested in cooking them this way).

I made this today. It was good but not great. I will make again and maybe add some caramelized onions and brown sugar. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I'm a sucker for collard greens so I was excited to try a vegetarian version. The dish definitely has a kick to it!  I cooked this all day in my slow cooker. I thought the amount of vinegar was too much -- I usually start with 2 T and go up as needed. Thank you!
