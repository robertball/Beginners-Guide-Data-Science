Too sweet and thick for our taste!  I tried this recipe again but modified it by using 2 cans Bush's pinto beans and 1 cup of jarred salsa instead of the barbeque beans and tomato paste.  Tasted awesome with the modifications!  Served it with sour cream on the side.

I thought this was a really good weeknight meal.  It's quick and super easy.  I tend to not try things on AllRecipes that don't have at least ten ratings and four stars, but, like the other reviewer, I was looking for something that I had ingredients for at 4:30 in the afternoon and came across this, so I gave it a try.  My family liked it and I'll be making it again.

I made this the last minute because I happened to have all the ingredients in my house.  My husband loved it.  He commented that he usually doesn't like things with "crusts" on top of them, but he loved this.  I gave it 5 stars for the easiness of it.  Also, our oven was broken so I happened to follow all the directions but threw it in the microwave for about 15 minutes... or until the corn bread was done on top.  It probably would've been better in the oven... but it was great.  Might use chili beans next time.  Thank you!  Oh.. I didn't have green pepper... I used an orange one.

I had high hopes for this recipe.  Not only was it fast, but it contained ingredients that the family all enjoys on their own. The only change I made was adding salt, pepper and garlic to the meat and subbing a red pepper for green (just a personal preference)  The dish was not unedible, but my husband summed it up best "I would have rather had a burger with beans and cornbread on the side"  I have to agree.  It was also very sweet, but that may of been my bean choice Bushes Original.  I'm going to serve the leftovers tonight, but I'm going to pull off the cornbread topping and reheat it just with cheese on top to see if I can slavage it.  One other thing, it took longer than 30 minutes to cook the corn bread on top.

This was pretty good, and definitely easy to make, but I thought it was a little bit bland.  I left out the green pepper as I didn't have any, so maybe that would make a difference.  I will make it again for sure, but I am tempted to add a little something...maybe some linguica to the beef while it is browning.

I'm a guy and this is truly one of the BEST 'GUY' meals I've ever had.  How can you beat cornbread, beans, and meat all rolled into one?!?!  I used the honey baked beans and I'm in heaven!!

This recipe was awesome.  I used one can of Bush's steakhouse beans and one of BBQ baked beans - everything else was the same.  Came out perfect.
