This is a great salad, and another way to sneak some broccoli into your family.  A variation on other ramen salads made with cabbage, it is sweet, crunchy and delicious.  I rated 4 stars, because I cut the dressing in half and only used one package of noodles.  This amount of dressing still give ample liquid to the salad.  Even cutting it in half, it seems a tiny bit oily to me, so I will cut the oil back to equal the vinegar next time.  Thanks for the idea!

Broccoli slaw is a frequent side dish on my menu . I keep on hand a bottle of Renee's Asian Sesame vinegar dressing (not the yellow kind from kraft)- perfect substitute that will take the short prep time to super short 2-mins.

Soooooooo good.  Can't get enough. We substituted a few things to make it healthier: the sugar with Splenda, the soy sauce with light soy sauce, only used one ramen seasoning packet and didn't use any noodles. Definitely going to have this at least once a month.

This is a variation of one of my favorite go-to salads..but mine only uses 1/4-1/4 c sugar (your taste) and the flavor pack from an oriental Ramen noodles pack.  The noodles ARE put in uncooked (crunch them in the packet as well as you can before the wrapper breaks then crunch/ break up well when adding, as the large "groups" don't hydrate well) and I like to put them in the dressing an hour or two before mixing the dressing through it all, and serving, depending on how much crunch you like.  I also use sunflower nuts instead of the almonds (personal taste and I keep a jar on the fridge for most salads).  I like the addition of raisins but dried apricots or craisens would be fun too.  Really a great salad for a quick put together.

Used this recipe as a guide and made the following adjustments: Trader Joe's Broccoli Slaw mix, 12 oz bag; no sugar in the dressing, no ramen or ramen seasoning, instead I used Trader Joe's everyday seasoning mix, instead of almonds I used sunflower seeds and also left out onions & green peppers. Turned out great although the dressing to slaw ratio was a little off (probably b/c I left out so many things), it was a little more 'wet' than I usually prefer. I would definitely make this again!

I couldn't find broccoli slaw mix, had to use carrot broccoli cabbage slaw. Then I added 1 broccoli stock that I cut up & some small florets. I also couldn't find golden raisins.  Made it for thanksgiving & have been asked to bring it for Christmas dinner.

This is a great basic recipe with lots of room for making it your own way. I changed just a couple of items. I used grape seed oil and only used 1/2 the amount. Same with sugar, cut it in half and increased vinegar a little. I also used lightly sweetened cranberries (I didn't have any raisins). Also, the broccoli slaw bag I had was 12 oz. so, I just used it all. Turned out great, everyone loved it. Oh, and I only used 1 pack Raman Noodles. I don't know why it was specified to use chicken Raman noodles since you're not using the broth packet so it doesn't matter what one you use. Hopefully, it was less calories and same wonderful flavor. Would make again, for sure.

great! Only used 1/3 cup oil and the cranberries as one other suggested. I only sprinkled the bell papers on mineâ€¦ as the rest of my family do not care for them.  Will definitely use this one again.  I served it with Korean Bar B Q that I cooked in the crock pot! Awesome, Easy and inexpensive dinner!

This recipe was really easy and very good. I gave it 4 stars because it was missing something - bacon. I made it exactly as instructed but I chopped and fried 6 slices of bacon and added that to the mix. I also add about a cup of very small broccoli florets.

This  is always a hit at family cookouts.  Mine was a little bit different this time but it was different because all I had was rice vinegar on hand so I used that,  added some olive oil and a little bit of sugar, some black pepper and then the seasoning packet to Ramen noodles (Oriental flavor),  mixed this up and then poured it into the broccoli slaw.   I crushed up the ramen noodles before I opened  the packet and sprinkled those in.    Also this time I could not find slivered almonds at the grocery store so I used unsalted sunflower seeds instead.   Nobody in my family really likes raisins so I omitted that part.   Usually I let the slaw sit overnight in the fridge to soak in the flavors.   There are so many variations to this recipe  and I don't even really measure the stuff anymore, I just adjust the "dressing" according to taste.   I am having to make a separate batch  for one of my kids who cannot attend this family function that I'm taking it to -she loves it that much!  :)  My whole family loves this except for my husband who is from the South and had never heard of the stuff until he became a  Yankee... He thinks it is too weird lol.

The salad was very good with all of the textures and flavors. I added a little sugar at a time to the dressing and tasted as I went. I used less than directed and it was just right for us. Also added some mandarin oranges that we had left over and I would add them again.  This salad is addicting!!  You just want to keep eating more.

I reduced the olive oil. Added crushed peanuts. Substituted Stevia for sugar. I think this is a recipe you can modify. I love it.

My family gave mixed reviews.  We had one who loved it, one who liked it and one who didn't really care for it.  I think using a plain vinaigrette without the sugar next time and adding more cabbage would make it a big hit with all of us.

Yes!! I've already made this 3 times and it gets compliments at potlucks.  It only took me 10 minutes to throw together...granted the granular sugar wasn't even dissolved completely...but it still got compliments.

I love love love this recipe. I like to make a large batch at the beginning of the week and eat it all through the week! It still tastes great days later. 

I usually adjust the recipe to a serving size of 4 when I make it. I make everything with those measurements, except I use about triple the amount of broccoli slaw because I like it with less dressing. I also omit raisins, green pepper, and bell pepper because I am very picky. But otherwise I love this!

We liked the salad, and I will probably make it again.  I think it needs a little tweaking to really make it shine.  As others mentioned, I found the dressing a little sweet and will cut back on the sugar and oil next time.

Delish!  Didn't have any raisens or cranberries, and I cut down a bit on the olive oil. I'm serving it as a side dish, but it would be wonderful with chicken in the salad. Will definitely make again.
