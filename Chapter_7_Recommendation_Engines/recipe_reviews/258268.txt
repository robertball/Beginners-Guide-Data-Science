Very good! Trying to eat more grains and bought farro. My kids (6, 5,1) did not care for this but I thought it was delicious. My only criticism was the raw onion, it was to strong and over powered the dish slightly. I would suggest using a shallot or red onion for a more pleasing taste. The addition of feta or parmigiana adds an additional layer of flavor. Definitely will make this again with those adjustments. Thank you for the farro recipe:)

My family loves this dish! My kids (11 and 6) both eat it really well! As a treat, we add feta cheese on top.

Too strong raw onion taste, but very good otherwise. Will make again for a summer BBQ.
