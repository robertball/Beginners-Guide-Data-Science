We tried this recipe today and it is simple to make and delicious to eat.  I did slice the carrots and parsnips in half long-ways and then cut them in half so my pieces were smaller.  I found they needed to cook longer, not sure why but it didn't matter. You could cut the baking time by steaming them a bit before baking if you wanted to be more precise about cooking time. I did stir them around a couple of times while they were baking.  The end result was really delicious.  We ate them along with old fashioned potato cakes (also from this site) -- my husband ate the meat we had too, but I made my meal out of these and the potato cakes.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing your recipe. Beats pickles and ice cream hands down!  :)

As written, I give this recipe a solid 4 (although it does need double the cooking time at these temps).  Cut the carrots and parsnips into finger-sized pieces, and double the time, and you'll have lovely carmelized veggies.  In subsequent recipe attempts, however, I've found that adding about 1/2 tsp of crushed dried rosemary puts it over the top and makes it a 5+ star recipe.  The rosemary and honey combination are exquisite!

Temp and/or cook time is all wrong on this recipe. I ended up roasting mine for almost twice the time, and still the snips weren't really soft.

Love this recipe! I added a little bit of cinnamon (about 1 tsp) and Italian seasoning to the mix. It sounds really random but the seasonings really offset the sweetness of the the honey and cinnamon.

Beautiful!  I steamed the carrots and parsnips for 3 minutes before  roasting.  Cooked on 400 degrees for 40 minutes (turning half way through).  I also added 2 small quartered cooking onions, some fresh ground pepper and some Mrs. Dash.  They were so tasty.  This one is a keeper!

Yep, I'll make this again. I should have stripped the "core" out  of the big end of the parsnips. I made it for my wife for Christmas dinner, and she loved it. Would not have made it for myself, but I actually liked it very well. (Another recipe I found at the same time said to cut carrots and parsnips into 3" x 1/2" pieces. I did this; I'm sure it helped with the cooking time.)

OK I'm not gonna lie not done this recipe but thought I could help a bit with some suggestions. Take the parsnips and try to remove the middle of them as the core is VERY hard and takes a long time to cook. Then try par cooking them in a frying pan with some oil for about five minutes I also usually cut my parsnips into thin strips. Then when putting them into the oven try adding some garlic as well

This recipe works if you add about a cup of water in the dish and cover it with foil.

Takes longer to roast to tenderness.
Too sweet for my taste. 
Next time I might combine a very  much smaller amount of  honey with a bit of orange juice. 
I do like this particular combination of vegetables.

Yummy! I cooked at a higher temp so the ends get crispy. Also easy to add baby cut carrots. They are the perfect size.

I cut the veggies into bite size pieces and still had to bake them for 70 minutes. They were excellent though. My husband stabbed a parsnip with his fork and asked, What is this? I said, parsnip. He said, Itâ€™s surprisingly good.

A tad sweet for my tastes.  Would use a lot less honey next time
