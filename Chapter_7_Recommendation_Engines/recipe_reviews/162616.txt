This casserole was delicious!  Instead of the usual (robotic) "thank you Mom, this is good" I got "Wow!  This is really good!"  Hearing that usually makes my day and makes all the hard work worth it. I didn't change a thing. Thanks.  :)  **update** I've made this 3x now and we prefer the DelMonte brand sauce.  It's got a little more "zing" I guess than the Manwich brand.  Manwich seems a little bitter or something.

Very easy and tastes great. A snap when your in a hurry. I didn't have any garlic salt, but just add a teaspoon or so of garlic powder and it works just fine. Also, kids love it!

I adjusted this recipe to substitute healthier choices. I used half the amount of ground turkey and substituted chopped zucchini, onions, garlic, chopped red pepper and spinach for the other half of ground meat. (This is a great way to stretch your meat budget plus get added vegetables into your family.) I also made my own sloppy joe sauce because I do not buy canned. Instead of garlic salt, I used garlic powder (we're watching our salt intake). I also used 2% sharp cheddar cheese. I did not care for this but my three men ate almost all of it. I got such a screaming deal on canned biscuits by couponing my husband was gleeful to have them in this casserole. This was a great way for my boys to get a comfort food favorite of theirs and a great way to make a homemade substitute with healthier ingredients and added vegetables plus, it was quick! I'll make this again.

I made this last Friday night. It was very simple to make & tastes great!! I was smart & greased the bottom of the 9x13" baking dish before putting in the biscuits, however. I doubled the amount of hamburger used since I knew 1 lb wasn't going to be enough--glad I did!! I kept the rest of the recipe the same though. My husband doesn't usually care for casseroles but he really liked this one! Wish I could've found the Del Monte sloppy joe mix with mesquite in our store as I think that would've tasted better than the Manwich brand. But I will definitely be making this recipe again!

Very cheap, tasty, easy, and quick. Used half of a red bell pepper, and garlic powder. However, the biscuits stuck, and the pan had to be soaked overnight, so I recommend using cooking spray. I also did not care for this reheated.

This was very good, but I felt like the biscuits were too much.  I think next time I'd do crescent roll dough across the bottom.

This was great! I was desperate for something that I could make out of what I had on hand, and this fit the bill. I used ground turkey instead of beef and rather than a can of sauce, I used the recipe for Sloppy Joes II, which is my go-to for sloppy joes. It took me seven biscuits to cover the bottom of the pan. I will make this again, and maybe add additional veggies next time. Thanks for sharing!

I made mine with one can of biscuits also in a 8in round pan. Didn't have shredded cheese so I just put some sliced on top. Turned out just fine! Great for making if you're out of buns or just want a new take on manwhich. I'm sure kids would love it.

LOVED!  Didn't use the onions or peppers as my picky kids will barely tolerate the veggies in the canned sauce, but everyone gobbled it up! Thank you for the great idea!

My family loves this recipe.  My hubby and son both turned up their noses until they tried it and ate the whole thing.  As a time saver I use chunky sloppy joe mix and I omit the chopped green peppers and onion.  I use the flakey biscuits and spread half on the bottom of a pie plate, fill with the mixture, sprinkle with some of the cheese and top with the remaining biscuits.  Last time I made this I rolled the second half of the biscuits and was able to roll it out and stretch it over the pie plate and seal it around the edges.  Lastly, I sprinkled it with the remaining cheese on top of the biscuits.  I am going to attempt to make this with pizza sauce, ground meat, pepperoni or sausage and mozzarella cheese as a "pizza pie" or alter the ingredients to make a "cheesburger pie".

This was OK for a weeknight meal, very filling.  We skipped the green pepper due to personal preference.  Used Grands biscuits and we were able to peel each one in half, instead of quartering them, so it was really easy to press them into the pan.  The only change I would make is to grease the pan first, the bottom of the biscuits seemed to stick.

Very easy and very good! The only variations were personal preference, I use only a half-can Manwich per pound of beef and I also added sliced jalapeno peppers. I will certainly make this again - thanks!

It was pretty good.  My family liked it and it will be something that we add to the rotation.  Both my sons loved it of course.   And I thought the taste was good.  A little twist on the classic Sloppy Joe.

I only used 1 can of biscuits and cooked them for a few minutes before adding the sauce...just to make sure the biscuits were cooked through. My boyfriend loved it. We will definitely be making these again.

I was so excited to make this recipe because I hadn't went to the grocery store in a while and I still happened to have all the ingredients for this dish.  However, the casserole was not what I expected.  Also, like another reviewer, I got a bad case of heartburn one hour after eating a small portion.  My son took one bite and didn't like it.   My husband ate the top layer of one portion, but didn't like the bottom bisucit layer.  I personally would rather have made sloppy joe's if I would have had the buns.  Sorry, we just didn't like it.

This was very good! I used one 17.5 oz. can of reduced fat golden wheat biscuits because it's what I had and it provided enough crust. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great!

We have been making this for years with one small change..use CRESCENT ROLLS instead of biscuits. The flavor is wonderful and it doesn't stick. Unroll one pkg of crescents into the bottom of your 9x13 pan and bake for 10 min. Remove from oven and add the meat mixture and cheese. Top with the other crescent roll and bake. It's my family's favorite!

Had to up the temp to 375 and the biscuits were still doughy.  Going to try this again next week and this time use tortilla chips.

This was very good!  I used just one 16.5 oz can of biscuits and it turned out perfect. I also added a little Goya adobo seasoning since that always makes meat taste better.

This was a good idea. I liked the addition of peppers and onions. The Del Monte sauce I used was too sweet. I'll try a different brand next time.

Everyone in the family loved this.  I will probibly use a different sloppy Joe sauce.  I used "Manwich".  I like a sweetier sauce.  I think I will also use a mild cheddar cheese next time.

Very kid friendly and easy to make.  My 3 and 4 year old loved it.
