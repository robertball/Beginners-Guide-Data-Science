I'm giving this a four instead of five for the simple fact that the recipe as is does not call for spices of any kind. I added a package of taco seasoning and used flour tortillas instead of corn. I like both, but for the sake of trying something new, I used flour, and it was amazing! I lined the bottom of the pan w/a nice layer of torn pieces of flour tortillas, then added the meat mixture. Once done, the tortillas on the very bottom had a nice golden crispiness to them while the rest were hot and almost chewy (in a good way, hard to describe here). It's reminiscent of the good fried burritos I loved as a kid.

For a casserole, this is really quick and easy to make! I used 8 corn tortillas, half the amount of meat subbing ground turkey, and added a can of black beans. You couldn't even tell it had tomato soup in it, it blended with the medium hot salsa I used very well. I recommend using a really flavorful salsa since that's where most of the flavor comes from. That being said, we'll surely have this again.

Delicious! I made a double batch and used half enchilada sauce and half mild rotel for the tomatoes. Added some extra dehydrated onions and garlic for flavor, put it only about half the milk it called for, used ground turkey in place of the beef, and used flour tortillas instead of the corn. It was very yummy! My kids all loved it, and my husband and I did too. And it wasn't too spicy for the kids (though for all adults I'd definitely add some more spice to kick it up!). 

I froze the second batch of this. It's a great freezer meal!

I got this recipe from a friend, it's sooo good. The only thing I do different is saute garlc and onion with the beef. then I throw in some taco seasoning(taco seasoning I, from this site) and bake at a lower temp. covered, that makes the tortillas softer. Throw the cheese and put back in uncovered to melt the second addition of cheeese. Perfect everytime.

Hmmm, maybe I was just hungry, but this was really good for some pantry items tossed together. I tinkered some and added a good sprinkle of garlic salt and some dried minced onion as the meat browned. I used On the Border brand salsa and simmered the meat sauce mix adding the cheese last as it went into the no stick sprayed baking dish, while the oven pre heated. I used a Mexican blend of cheeses and served this with a sliced avocado and a dollop of sour cream for a wonderful filling meal and all from a few cans and packaged items! Thanks, I'd fix this again.

Been making this for years.  Very good as is.  I do add more cheese to the top though, otherwise a family favorite.

This is really good!  I can't give a 5, because I do think it needed spices, which I added.  I added 1/2 package of taco seasoning and about a tablespoon of chili powder.  It was awesome. Next time I think I'll add some black beans and corn, to make more of a one-pot meal.  Had it with salad.

Excellent - this has been an old standby for me for many many years.  I use flour tortillas and a few more than the recipe calls for, and a bit more cheese, depending on what I have on hand of each.  This is a very quick, very filling recipe!

I usually make this when I forget to take something out for dinner but it is one of our favorites. It is quick and easy and very good (despite the picture shown here ;) ) My 2 yr old and 1 yr old gobble it up too. I use medium salsa and it does have a little kick to it but not too bad. I season the hamburger with salt, pepper and garlic powder, I add a cup of cheese to the mix and top it with slices of american cheese and cheddar, sour cream and sliced black olives. It is AWESOME

fast easy and it tastes very good and if you use ground turkey instead of ground beef and use low fat cheddar you have a good low fat meal as well.

This was better than the skillet version. Which is basically the same recipe but done in a skillet. I added taco seasoning to the meat. It would have been too bland without it. The tortillas kind of turn to mush, even though I try to prevent that, by letting them dry out for a few hours. And I used eight of them. I'm glad I didn't add the milk. I think it would be better if it was cooked uncovered. I added green chilis, corn and black beans and then doubled the cheese. Good flavor even though it is not the most attractive dish. I was worried that it was gonna be too soupy. But after sitting for a few minutes it firmed up.  I had to move it to a 9 x 13 to hold it all and definitely fed more than 4.

Really wonderful, easy dinner, i found that it needed a little more in the form of seasonings and adjusted it and added a little hot sauce. Definetly one i will make often.

Very good, did a layer of ingrediants when baking.  Kids really enjoyed.  Used regular salsa so it wouldn't be too spicy for kids.

This is something that I made when I was starting out cooking. I'd add a drained can of diced tomatoes and some homemade taco seasoning. Today I made it and my kids wouldn't touch it. So, if you think your kids will eat it....GO FOR IT. It's great for a quick, throw it together meal. Just not for us.

I tried this for the first time tonight. I love love love it. I added taco seasoning to the meat. Next time I will put some hatch green chilies in it and add more cheese. I have very picky eaters in my house and they all went back for seconds.

I added black beans and corn to this recipe cause I gotta lotta kids to feed.  But I followed everything else.  I read some had issue with the tortillas so I pulled them out and cut them up early so they could dry out a bit.  The family liked it. :) Will definitely make again

I used rotel fire roasted tomatos instead of soup cause that is what I had and I added onion, chili powder, and garlic to the ground beef.  I lined the bottom of the caserole with 2 flour tortillas and tore up 4 corn tortillas for the meat mixture.  I also added extra cheese on top.  Yummy

Simple, easy, inexpensive, and tasty. I added garlic, onion, red bell pepper,  taco seasoning, and some hot sauce to the meat. Then added sliced black olives on top of the cheese. Was requested to make it again. Served with a green salad. Next time will use half the meat and add some beans.

Great dish to use up left over taco meat! I would advise to anyone else making this to add some type of taco seasoning to the meat..makes a huge difference! I use the "taco seasoning I" recipe to make my own seasoning...it's AWESOME! Also, I used a half pound of hamburger and a half pound of Italian sausage..it's good either way but I like the different taste the Italian sausage brings to the dish. Overall..an easy dish for a busy Mom.

I followed the advice of others and added taco seasoning.  I think it was a big mistake because the meal tasted very salty to me.  I am giving it three stars since I changed the recipe with the seasoning.  I do not think I would make this again.

Two reviews:  Sept, 2013:  So easy and so delicious!!!  May, 2014: By coincidence, I made this a third time.  This time I used leftover, diced, cooked, bone-less, skinless chicken legs instead of the ground turkey.  On top after cooking, I added sliced green onions, sliced cherry tomatoes and chopped avocados ..... all ingredients I had on hand.  Either way, it's a keeper!!

This was pretty good but very rich! sour cream definitely helped to tone it down.  I added 1/2 a can of kidney beans and corn for some variety and color, could have put a little more in.  I think if i make this again I would also use a can of diced tomatoes and try to skip the milk and either use broth or water.  It was nice how quick this was to make and only one pan and one dish to clean up after!

This is quick, easy, and tasty!  I found the recipe years ago, and actually have it in my own personal recipe book.  Don't substitute cheap salsa.  You must have the good stuff.  Ideally, I would make my own salsa, but that's just too much work.  More cheese on top is always better for us.  You just can't get too much cheese with this type of meal.

Followed recipe to the letter; just so-so for us.  Rather bland, and we thought the tomato soup added a sweetness we didn't care for.  In all fairness, we live in the state of New Mexico, and we are accustomed to really spicy enchilada/taco dishes.  This could really use some real green chile.  There's just nothing like the taste of roasted green chile in a dish like this.

Really great recipe - nice for those cold winter nights when you're tired of soup. My whole family, including my in-laws, loved it!  I did make some additions/changes - I added one can of seasoned black beans, and 1-2 jars of Pace Medium salsa - and I used sharp cheddar cheese - I'm also thinking about adding some quick rice in order to add to the texture -

I followed this recipe exactly and didnt really enjoy it.  I thought it was too meaty because I used a pound of 93% lean ground beef.  My son and husband loved it, my daughter nibbled at it and I took a bite.  I think maybe if I used less beef it might of been better.

this was really good to eat for something kinda quick though I would suggest adding jalapeño pepper sauce that would give it a kick. also add red kidney beans to give it flavor since it looked kinda plan. Gives it a 4 rating it. We really liked it.

So stupid easy! I used a leftover pack of the salsa sauce from a taco dinner box and half salsa.. Added onion and fresh garlic. Used chunks of Velveeta cheese and baked for about twenty minutes... Then sprinkled Mexican blend cheese on top for the remainder. My house smelled amazing! Dinner was tasty. My 3 year old even enjoyed it. Served with sour cream and salad in the side.

We discussed this before rating. It came out more dip-like, like good for nachos. But the flavor was good (added Taco seasoning).  Maybe use it in a taco salad.  It was quick and easy though!

This was a 4 star until I kicked it up a couple of notches by adding a can of refried beans, taco seasoning and some hot sauce. Like all recipes, this is a good base recipe that can be enhanced by your own personal preferences.

I have a made a variation of this twice and it was well-liked by the family.  I heeded other's suggestions of adding some spice-cumin and chili powder and I also added some beans-black the first time, kidney the second time and threw in some frozen corn.  I don't have tomato soup on hand so I blended a can of stewed tomatoes and this time some leftover tomato based chased with some leftover chicken broth.  This time I threw in the remainder of some olives. I can't seem to used up more than about 4 corn tortillas before it seems like too much.  I just sprinkled about 1/2 a cup of 2% Mexican blend cheese.  I also haven't had any salsa on hand so don't let that stop you from experimenting.  I cut up some onion also this time. So thrilled to be using up stuff from the fridge.

This recipe is super easy, quick, and delicious!  I used tortilla chips instead of regular soft tortillas and it turned out great! I added more cheese on the top,as well.

On its own, this recipe was no better than Hamburger Helper and it has very little nutritional value.  However, add some fresh veggies on top and it's pretty good.  We added shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, avocados and sour cream.

Prepared as per the recipe, but doubled to feed my crowd.  Two large pans.....not a spoonful left!!  Might add more cheese next time since we're all big cheese lovers, but otherwise it's perfect the way it is.  I will be making this again!!

I make this all the time! It's a great easy meal. I used to make it exactly as written, but now I add 1 tsp of chili powder, sub out rotell for the salsa, and use tortilla chips instead (we like a 'crunch' with this)..one of my favorite comfort foods!
