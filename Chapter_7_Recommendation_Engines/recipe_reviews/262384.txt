I made the recipe nearly as written and it was extremely easy to make for this newbie Instant Pot user! Overall, great balance of flavors for the cacciatore and the meat was tender and moist! There's no ingredient that overpowers another. I scaled the recipe to half, but still used the 1/4 cup of wine just because I wanted to, which worked out well since I had more ‘browned bits’ on the bottom on one side of my IP. The little extra helped me to deglaze the pot. If you can’t have wine, you can use chicken broth/stock or water to deglaze the pot and this recipe will still come out great! I also used boneless, skinless chicken thighs and used the same cook time as stated in the recipe (I have the LUX 60 and used the meat/stew option). Converted to Gluten Free using equal amount GF All Purpose Flour. Otherwise, I pretty much made the recipe as stated. The chicken came out so moist and tender, and the sauce was perfect for us! Next time, I might include some diced bell pepper and mushrooms while sautéing the onion. Served with Easy Instant Pot® Spaghetti Squash from this site. Thank you for sharing the recipe, Bren!
