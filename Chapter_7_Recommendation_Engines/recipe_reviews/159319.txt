So good - I did change up a bit to my taste.  Used 2 fresh tomatoes, black beans and about 4 green onions.  I just squirted the juice of 2 limes in and also added 2 cloves of minced garlic.  I didnt add any cheese.  This was just delicious and I bet its delicious as is - I just cant help myself and end up changing things around a bit ;-)  ETA:  I cooked the quinoa in veggie broth and added serrano and jalapeno pepper and some frozen sweet corn (just toss in the bowl frozen) - soooo good!  Love this!

This was my first venture with Quinoa, and it was delicious!  I added a chicken boullion to flavor the Quinoa itself, and since other readers complained it was mushy, I cooked it only the 20 minutes til it was al dente.  The texture was perfect and seemed to be just as good the next day.  I was out of garbanzo beans, so I had to pass on that. I only had stems of cilantro left from dinner last night, so I chopped those fine, didn't have the cheese, added avocado, garlic, onion and fresh tomatoes.  It is really good!  I would recommend people who are shy about trying Quinoa to use this recipe!  And... it's good for you!

This is a fantastic recipe. I add a few cloves of garlic and 1 chopped jalapeno. I substituted black beans for the garbanzo beans and cheddar cheese for cotija, as I was unable to locate this cheese. I also use 2 fresh tomatoes in place of canned dices tomatoes. Adding some spice, such as chili powder and cumin and maybe some cayenne pepper make this a wonderful dish. Also, I recommend eating this hot as a full meal for 4. It is great in this fashion.

I made this for a work picnic and it had turned to absolute mush by the time we all enjoyed it.  This is NOT something that keeps well in the fridge.    I'm a good cook, so it was incredibly embarrassing. One person said it tasted like mushy oatmeal.

I made this according to directions..with one substitution..I could not find the cotija cheese so I used panella which is a crumbly farmers cheese.  I also served this cold with butter lettuce in the form of a lettuce wrap..my vegetarian dinner guest devoured it and asked for the recipe.  Another winner thanks!

Thanks :)

Delicious! More than 5 stars in my book. I also added 1 seeded and diced jalepeno for a little extra heat. Loved the freshness of the lime juice and cilantro which I think is key in this dish. The creaminess of the avacado also adds another level. Will be making this often. Thanks!

This is so delicious, once added feta instead of cotija cheese, once substituted parmesan.  Have made with or without chickpeas.  Made as a sidedish and main entree.  It is just that delicious and filling!!  My whole family loves it!!

I've made this twice and can eat the whole bowl all by myself.  It's really fresh tasting even though it uses 2 canned items.

This salad is so tasty and refreshing! I don't usually like cold salads but this was terrific. I replaced cotija with queso fresco and held the cilantro. It will stay good in the fridge for 1 day only so don't make too much.

I cook with quinoa often, but this recipe was very mushy.  Definitely follow the other reviewers who suggest kicking up the heat; I made it as is and found it bland.

We really enjoyed this salad! We cut it in 1/2, and used greek feta. Also, b/c we are in Canada, had to improvise with tomatoes...so, for 1/2 recipe - we did 2 romas and a 1/2 of a 114ml tin of diced green chilis. Did the trick, will def. make again!

I left out tomatoes entirely, but if I did use would definitely use fresh.  Also cook the quinoa in some type of broth, just adds that extra bit of flavour.  I left out the cilantro and added fresh spinach and some cucumbers. Fresh garlic a must.  Love this salad with these few changes.

Good!! I used a little salsa and a little bit of fresh diced tomato in place of the diced tomatoes w/ green chile peppers. I cut the salt down a little and added cumin and garlic. Thanks :)

This was just ok, served it warm, with tortillas. I still haven't found a recipe made with quiona that just knocks my socks off...I'll keep looking.  Edited and added a star. I stored the leftovers in the fridge and it was much better reheated a day later. It was overly runny when I first made it, but reaheated, it had a much better consistency. Still unsure if I'll make it again as my kids didn't really dig it.

This was a great recipe! I think the only things that I would recommend would be to make sure that the quinoa is boiled down long enough, and if this salad is something you are going to take to a party or somewhere warm, add the avacadoes later on so that they don't turn to mush. Thank you for sharing!!

I made this yesterday and ate it tonight for dinner.  It was so good.  I added some ingredients, I added a couple chopped scallions, a TBS minced garlic, and a can of black beans as well as the garbanzo beans.  I loved it I will probably add a little more lime juice but that's because I like it a little more limey.  I did not add the avacado because I do not like it and I went to 2 different stores and no one had cojita cheese so I got feta cheese instead.  I will definiely make this again.

This was okay, but a little too spicy for my taste. I didn't have any avocados, since my family doesn't care for them, so i didn't put any in. The salad was very easy to make, but it isn't something I would make again.

Outstanding!  I forgot to buy cotija cheese, so I compensated by simply salting the salad to my taste.  I also added some minced garlic - nothing beats the mixture of cilantro, lime and garlic!

So good!  And easy to make :)  We thought it tasted like a super-healthy version of a Chipotle burrito.  I cooked the quinoa with a scoop of chicken stock instead of salt, used black beans instead of garbanzo, and substituted mozzarella cheese for the cotija.

I thought this was great! I added sweet onion (raw), garlic and corn.  I pounded and marinated chicken breast in lime juice and grilled. I did not chill the Quinoa salad, placed the chicken breast on top and it was delicious.  Cubed chicken mixed in for a quick lunch the next day.

Very good and a flexible recipe. I didn't have the cotja cheese so I used some jalapeno jack cheese, diced.  I used plain tomatoes  - drained, as other reviewers said the dish got soggy.  It would be easy to make it Italian, adding olives and canellini beans - or Greek - with olives and feta.

I just added what I had on hand (black beans) plus garlic, onion (no cotija handy) and followed the rest and it was DELISH! I also dashed a little cayenne in for heat, YUM.

Loved the flavor! Even my husband who sometimes doesn't care for quinoa liked it. I used bottled lime juic and substituted shredded mexican for the cotija. Honestly it didn't even need cheese. I also didn't wait for the quinoa to cook and just added the other ingredients to it once it was done! Yummy!

Absolutely delicious! I, too, added a few little things. After reading some reviews, I added onion flakes and garlic powder. I also added goya brand cilatro and tomato flavoring powder. I couldn't wait to taste it! It's delicious and I haven't even let it cool to taste it with the cilantro! So great! Thanks for the recipe!

This was super yummy.  I added the garlic like one reader had suggeted and the quinoa really took on the flavor, next time I might use a little less.  I did use the fresh tomato and avacado and served in lettuce wraps. Again super yummy, thank you for sharing!!!

I made this according to recipe with a few slight changes....cooked quinoa in beef broth, used black beans, and left out the cheese.  I enjoyed this both warm and cold but have to say I preferred it warm.  Will make again with some more changes according to my tastes.

I made this last night to go with some hamburgers on the grill and I couldn't believe how tasty this was!  I put it in the freezer for 30 min. to speed up the cooling down.  I was able to buy a big bag on Quinoa at Sam's Club out here in the Southwest so it was cheaper to make.  I did use Cotija cheese, which is pretty expensive if you can find it, but ended up adding some Parmesan as well for more flavor as well as a touch of fresh garlic.  I think this is such a versatile salad that if you wanted to add black olives or sun-dried tomatoes, it would taste good.   I also didn't have canned tomatoes so I used fresh.  I'm going to finish what's left for lunch today!  Delicious!  I will be bringing this to the next church Agape feast (Pot luck).  Thanks!

Super delicious, and vegan friendly w/changes. No cheese, no canned tomatoes/garbanzos. Added: fresh tomatoes, 1tsp diced jalapeno, 1/2 can black beans (drained/rinsed), 1/2c chopped fresh spinach. Doubled lime juice, and added 1 clove minced garlic.

Fantastic!  I followed another reader's suggestion, and did this as lettuce wraps.  We ditched the avocado because we don't care for it, used fresh tomatoes in place of canned, and added a few cucumbers and some fresh mint.  Also cooked the quinoa in chicken broth, and added a teaspoon of fiesta lime seasoning.

Excellent recipe! Thank you! I've been looking for good quinoa recipes to use the giant container of it that we got from Costco. Used fresh tomatoes and feta cheese. Added a kick with cayenne and cumin. Served over greens. Looking forward to leftovers!

These were excellent and very unique!  We ate them in tortillas and it was very good.  As we couldn't get cotija cheese we used feta instead.

I am a huge quinoa fan, and I'm always looking for new healthy recipes. This is a great one, and I will definitely make it again! I made a few changes: using fresh tomato and jalapeno, feta cheese, parsley instead of cilantro, and adding a bit of red onion. The taste of lime juice makes this salad very refreshing.

5 stars for how healthy this is and the great flavor combination, I'm giving it 4 stars because the canned tomatoes and chilies and the amount of lime juice tends to make this a bit liquidy. I think fresh tomatoes and jalapenos would work best, and next time I'll just sprinkle the lime juice to taste. overall a really nice dish that I'll make with a few changes that suit my tastes. Thanks for sharing!

Outstanding! My substitutions: panela cheese, 1 avocado, fresh tomatoes, canned roasted chiles, black beans, and some fresh yellow bell pepper. Was great with chips & salsa, and in a salad with baby greens and a creamy lime-cilantro dressing I concocted.

LOVE this!  I used black beans instead of garbanzo and didn't hold back with the cheese . . . used the whole package!  I was short on quinoa so used 1/2 quinoa and 1/2 couscous and it was still great.  Will make it regularly!

Like another reviewer, I used fresh tomatoes and medium hot chiles and green onions.  It was nice and refreshing- I do think it got a bit mushy for leftovers.

I made changes b/c of what I had in my house and this became a household favorite with my picky eaters. I used Quinoa, canned garbanzo beans,  dried cilantro, can diced tomato,  salt, pepper, Avocado, and garlic powder.  I made the quinoa per box instructions, then added the whole can of tomato, drained the garbanzo beans, then added, salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Let it simmer till all the liquid was gone and let me tell you, i made a huge batch and my family of 4 ate this till it was all gone that night. My 10 yr old (picky eater) asked for me to make it for school lunch the next day.

this was a great starting point for our side dish.. i admit to deviating quite a bit based on what we had.. i cooked the quinoa with chicken bouillon as others suggested.. used garlic salt instead of kosher but didn't measure.. also didn't measure the lime juice.. forgot the olive oil.. left out the avocado and cheese as i didn't want to make an extra trip to the store.. used 2 chopped roma tomatoes for the canned.. added 3/4 cup each of onion, green bell pepper, and cucumber.. and feel like i could have added even more.. and lastly, i added some chili powder and cumin.. this was such a success.. ty for the recipe

I have made this twice and love it! It is great as a salad or in a warm tortilla. I used feta cheese as a substitute for cotija and it was great! Would definitely recommend!

I made this recipe for a potluck at work. All 10 people loved it, and several were asking for the recipe. Like many others I couldn't find the cheese in the recipe so I just used grated cheddar. I skipped the avocado as I couldn't find any ripe in my area. Added a bit of curry powder and garlic as per other reviews. Great warm or cold and was awesome for several days in the fridge. Never had a problem with it being mushy. I suspect it's all in how you cook in the quinoa.

I did make a few changes - but only because I didnt have the diced tomatoes with the chilies, the cheese and garbanzo beasns.  I improvised by using a jar of salsa instead of the can of diced tomatoes, cannelloni beans instead of the garbanzo, and skipped the cheese all together.  I added more quinoa as well, because the salsa made it very runny.  This is absolutely fantastic!  I will definetely make it again.

It was okay. Not a lot of flavoring and pretty mushy. I used black beans instead of chickpeas because that's what I had on hand and also added celery, green onions, and some extra seasoning. Maybe next time I'll try just using chopped tomatoes instead of the canned.

I am bringing this to my work holiday potluck. I got rave reviews from my Thanksgiving crowd!! I had it as a side dish and made so much that guests were asking to take some home. Nice that I had extra Ziplock containers because leftovers would not have fit in my refrigerator. To make it vegan, put the cheese on the side so people can add it if they like.  I did change cotija cheese to feta because I could not find it in two stores.

Make sure to drain the canned tomatoes!  I love this recipe.  It's good even if you don't have all the ingredients.  I don't usually have the avocados and cheese for this and it is still amazing.  I make it for the week and then love it so much I eat it all before even Wednesday.  lol  It's even good warm if you feel like microwaving it.  I haven't tried freezing it though; I might try that this week.  I'd leave the avocado out if you try and freeze it though.  I don't think avocado freezes very well.  lol

Good simple summer side dish. Cut recipe in half, and used fresh cut grape tomatoes. Could use a little kick, may try jalapeños next time as some recommended. Don't think it would keep well unless you kept avocados separate.

This was a hit at a family gathering.  Easy to make with a great taste.  Just a note, I don't feel it keeps well because of the avocado browns which is not very appetizing!  Maybe keep that out and mix in before serving.

This is an easy, tasty recipe. I made a few minor changes: I skipped the cheese due to allergy and I made it into a hot dish versus a cold one. I turned out great. I will definitely make it again. I might ad a bit of red pepper to give it a bit more heat.

I took another's advice and added 1/2 tsp chill powder, mixed it with the lime and olive oil.  I also layered this into a glass container and it was quite pretty.  I also used fresh tomatoes, and subbed feta cheese.  It was very tasty and light yet still has good protein.

Quite the hit at our Super Bowl a Party!  Rave reviews!  Added Cheyenne pepper, nutmeg, and cumin.  Used fresh diced Italian tomatoes, jalapeños in place of canned.  Black beans added for a preferred presentation.

Fantastic. The only thing I did differently was to add the avocado, cheese and cilantro separately, so that when I warmed up the leftovers it didn't ruin them. We used it as a burrito filling. Yum!!! Even my picky toddler gobbled it up. And I love that it is so healthy.

I really liked this recipe. Instead of cubing the avacado, I mashed it into the Quinoa.

Excellent flavor!  I followed the recipe exactly.  We wrapped it in corn tortillas because that's what we had on hand.  I had it the next day by itself!  Great both times.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely loved this. Skipped the garbanzo beans and cilantro because I didn't have them on hand. I replaced the cojito cheese with shredded mozz (what I had in the fridge). Still awesome. Can't wait to try it as written.

Quinoa is great.  The canned tomatoes ruined it. The whole canned flavor permeated the dish. I do like tomatoes, but in this dish, they should have been fresh.

Loved it and so flavorful - the quinoa is really not the star here - but it binds the veggies together nicely. Very tangy dish and instantly loved at the potluck instead of a pasta dish, potato salad or blah green salad.

I've read some reviews from people who haven't liked quinoa, that's it's too mushy, etc.  I used to agree!  Now, every time I make quinoa, I first soak it for a while, then I boil the water, and put the quinoa in the boiling water.  It makes all the difference - try it!
