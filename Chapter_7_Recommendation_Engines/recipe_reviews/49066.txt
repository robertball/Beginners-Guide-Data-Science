My family has made a very similar recipe for years. Only change is instead of powdered sugar or heavy cream we use 1 can of sweetened condensed milk to fill the place of both. We also add 1/4 c lemon juice to make it perfect. It's a birthday favorite every year!

So easy and sooo good.  If you are a cheesecake lover you must try this.  It's lighter and fluffier than baked cheesecake.  I used a prepared "light" graham cracker crust from the store and 1/3 less fat cream cheese to save some calories.  Unfortunately it is so good that I have eaten a slice every day since I made it!  My fiance loves it too and he's not a big cheesecake lover.

Not bad, but didn't really have a good cheesecake consistency.  Also, it was very sweet.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar.

Absolutely delicious!! I substituted the cherry pie topping with Dark Cherry Preserves/Jam. 
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it was waaay too sweet. I think 1/2 a cup of sugar would have been enough.

Fantastic. I used a premade crust. The filling was light and fluffy. Easy to save fat/calories by using light cream cheese. Was gone in mere minutes on Christmas.

This is  really good base. I liked it because it is so easy to make and it doesn't need baked.  I changed a couple of things. The butter really needs to be melted and mixed together with the suger before adding to the graham crackers,or it will not hold together for the crust. The Cream Cheese MUST be soften. Just leave it sit out for about 20 minutes,then while still in the inside package,lightly knead with your fingers.  I added 1 -2 T of Lemon Juice to the filling so it tasted more like a real Cheesecake.  Thank you for sharing.

My mom has made this ever since I can remember!  I had never had Real Cheesecake until I was in High school and I thought it tasted funny! lol.  I don't understand why people think it is too sweet- it is cheesecake for crying out-loud! one of the richest desserts out there!  We usually do the cherry pie filling or blueberry pie filling.  Mom usually uses cool whip.  And for the person that said the whipping cream made it too runny- did you whip  the cream first? It is a must.  I don't understand why people rate this recipe 1 star and then say everything they changed.  If you just followed the recipe it would have been great!

This is a recipe I have used for years. For a fun twist. Use same recipe for filling but use muffin papers in muffin cups and use one Nilla Waffer in the bottom of each for crust. Cheesecake Cupcakes!!!! Awesome!

This is so good!  I doubled it and used a 9 x 13 and it worked out great.  I didn't use quite all of the graham cracker crumbs in the crust, so I just sprinkled some on top of the cherry pie filling.  I also stuck the crust in the oven for a short time as it appeared a little crumbly.  The crust turned out great! I didn't have any whipping cream so I used Cool Whip--I'm sure it's great with either.  This is SO tastey!

**I noticed someone else commented that it was runny.  The instructions say whisk in "whipped cream".  You have to whip the cream before you add it to the cream cheese mixture.  Anyhow, I am always a little uncertain about no bake desserts.  But this one is every bit as good as any baked cheesecake that calls for 30 different ingredients.  It's as good, as it is simple.

An important trick:  This cheesecake tastes SO MUCH BETTER if you leave it in the refrigerator for a day or so before eating it!  I found this out quite by accident, but wanted to share my discovery.  I'm not sure why this is, but it tastes so much more like cheesecake on the second or third day.  If it just sets for a few hours it still tastes too "whippy".  

Other than that, I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and added a teaspoon of real lemon.  Delicious!

Cut down on the sugar and mix a little fruit jam in with the cream cheese.  Be sure to fold the softened cream cheese in with the whipped cream rather than beating it together because the cream will un-whip and the cheesecake will be extremely runny.

Sorry, but my family didn't like this.  It is not a cheesecake at all. The texture is like eating mousse.  It would be better in parfait cups eaten with a spoon.  I thought I was making a cheesecake so I was pretty disappointed when I cut into it.

Based on reviews...I added 2T lemon juice and used 1/2 c conf sugar instead of a cup.... used cool whip to cut time. Also for the crust,I omitted sugar and used crumbs and butter only. Had lots of left over crumbs so will cut back next time. my husband ate half of the cake in one sitting....it was delicious and i will be making this often. thank you (:

For years, I have been making something very similar.  I use a regular baked pie shell and only 1/2 C powdered sugar.  I got the recipe from a friend's family recipe collection.  It makes a refreshing dessert in the summertime plus it's my husband's birthday dessert.

This is the same one I have used for years.  I use one pkg of dream whip rather than whipping cream. I mix graham crust right in the springform pan-less clean up. I also bake my crust at 375 for 8 min.  Will never go back to baked cheesecake.  This is so light and fluffy.  Always requested for holiday dessert.

Very easy ( I used Keebler already made graham crust)but I think next time I'll make my own. It was to sugary.The filling was simple..I whipped the heavy cream for a long time to get it thick. It set up very nicely too. I then topped wih Cherry Pie filling. I will make this again with Blueberry. ThanK You for this nice recipe LuCynda.

I used a sugar cookie dough, (store bought) for the crust.  Just spread 1/2 of a small roll of the dough into a sprayed 8" pie plate and cooked for 12 minutes.  I doubled the recipe, didn't have heavy cream so used cool whip and less powdered sugar.  Turned out really nice!!

I'm not really a cheesecake-fan but this cheesecake is sooo good and easy, you have to give it a try. I looked at a few other unbaked recipes and only used 1/2 of confectioners's sugar. Many other members reviewed this cheesecake as a bit too sweet, so halving the confectioners' sugar helps a lot because mine wasn't too sweet at all.

The first time I made this, my dog ate the whole thing (oops, shouldn't have left it outside to chill!)- he didn't get sick, so it must have been good.  I tried again, and it is absolutely delicious.  Has a lighter and fluffier texture than your "standard" cheesecake. I like my cheesecake plain & it definitely doesn't need anything on top. I did bake the crust and reduce the sugar. I have one chilling in the fridge right now and can't wait to eat it!!

This was good, for what it is... a cream cheese pie.  Its not a real cheesecake, that being said its great for a no-bake make ahead of time dessert.

I made this recipe for the first time the other day. I used 2-8oz pkgs of chocolate cream cheese and doubled the real whipped (whipped first) cream and it tasted absolutely heavenly. It was light and creamy, it set perfectly. Awesome recipe, it will become a regular in our home. It was a huge hit with my family! Thanks for sharing it.

1 star for easy, 2 stars for super tasty, no other stars for having to cut down on the sugar (do this if you dont like your desert super sweet) and the real problem with it was that the cake was extremely  runny in the end. I m going to make it again but this time will beat the cream first and maybe add some whipped cream stabilizer and only then add the cream cheese into the mix. Hope this will fix the problem so we can really enjoy this recipe.

Very good recipe. Made them yesterday & everyone loved it. I used splenda in place of sugar, reduced to 3/4 cup. I used cool whip instead of whipped cream. Will make it again. thanks for sharing.

I really was not impressed with this.  The crust was crumbly it should have been baked before the mixture went in.  The taste of whip cream was too powerful, very dissapointing.

Zero for texture! I expected cheesecake, not chiffon texture. I didn't put a topping, gave my guests the option of 4 different toppings to put on it, if desired. I refrigerated it for 4+ hours, and it was too soft. I didn't get any praises at all from my guests, my husband didn't like it at all. I have to admit, overnight chilling made it firmer. Also, as far as taste, I loved it. Very easy to put together, but overall it only rates 2 stars from me.

I made this to take to a family gathering for Christmas.  The only changes I made was to use a premade graham cracker pie crust and used cool whip in place of the whipped heavy cream, both purely out of convenience. It turned out so tasty everyone asked for the recipe and there wasn't a single bite left when it was time to come home!  Thanks for sharing!

I was very excited to try this recipe after seeing so many great reviews.  I have to say that I was highly disappointed.  I cut the sugar by half as some had suggested and still found it too sweet.  The crust fell apart when serving, perhaps 1/4 cup of margarine is not enough.  I was not very fond of the whipped texture since I am used to eating baked cheesecakes.  I am just going to stick with the baked cheesecake recipes from now on.

I made this for a very large group (about 80 people), and it was a big hit!  Although I'm usually not a fan of the "unbaked" cheesecakes, I have to admit this one was creamy, cold, and delicious.  Instead of making regular-sized cheesecakes, I used lined muffin tins, dropped a Nilla Wafer in the bottom as "crust" (easiest thing EVER), and then filled them and froze them for easier transport later.  The freezing was a great step, because when we ate them, they were still kind of frozen, and it was even better than the softer set that you get from the fridge.  This recipe is super easy and quick to make, and kids can help as well.  I'll be making this one again :)

It was so delicious! We used fresh berries (strawberries) instead of the pie filling, and loved it! It was fantastic without berries or filling on top, too!

Loved it and my guests asked for seconds. Next time I will double the recipe and make in a cake pan. I didn't use cherry filling. Instead I topped with fresh chopped up mango sweetened with tough of sugar.

I tried the orginal recipe and then I did one with my own spin to it. I did the 8 oz. of Phil. cream cheese, 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1/4 cup of powdered sugar, 1/2 cup reg. white sugar, 1 tsp of vanilla extract, and 1 1/2-2 cups of jello cool whip.  My children, my husband, and I liked this recipe better thant the orginal . I used the orginal recipe as a foundation and then added on as  I needed.  Try it!! You will like it!!!!!

This was fantastic! I made two for a small dinner party last night and there aren't any leftovers. One guest had four slices and then told me that he could sit down and eat a whole one by himself. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added more vanilla and some lemon juice.

I've made this MANY times and we love it....no it doesnt firm like a regular cheesecake, but it's not supposed to. It's light and fluffy and definitely whipped. We love it. I only gave it 3 stars because I add in 1 tbs lemon and 1 tsp vanilla into the filling, I dont think it would be as good without it.  The graham cracker crust is pretty crumbly, so this isint something I'd serve at a party....just with close family. :)

I found this was WAY WAY WAY too sweet, and it tasted more like a mousse than a cheesecake.  I didn't add the sugar to the crust because Graham Crackers are already sweet as it is.  I found that it didn't get firm even after 2 days in the fridge!  I will stick to my moms no-bake cheese cake from now on.

I thought this turned out great even though I used some suggested exchanges. I used 1 can of sweet and condensed milk for the sugar. I also added 1/3 c lemon juice and 2 cups of whipped cream.

this was super easy to make and was definitely enjoyed at a birthday bash.  i used the suggestion to replace the cream and powdered sugar with a can of eagle brand.  also added the suggested lemon juice.  found this variation to be a little too sweet - great for mini cheesecakes maybe but for a full size cake it's nice to have a little more cream cheese taste... not just "sweet" taste.  next time i think i'll try the original recipe so that i can cut out some of the sugar.  otherwise it was a great recipe.

Delicious and very easy! Didn't have powdered sugar so used 1/2c regular sugar (mixed in whipping cream so it would dissolve). Also, painted crust with black cherry preserves before filling with cream cheese mixture.  Did not use fruit on top. Froze for about 2 hours before serving. Took it to a party and it was a big hit. . .although everyone agreed it really shouldn't be called cheesecake (a texture thing).

The title of this recipe speaks for itself! I have made this cheesecake twice this week. The first time I had the same results as some others did with the cheesecake not holding up well after a long refrigeration time. But the reason is because you have to really whip the heavy cream to an almost meringe consistency. It should almost look foamy, then add it in the cream cheese mixture. I made it for work and before I could get more this guy had the pie pan in front of him eating out of it himself and finished it off! So needless to say it was a big hit. This recipe is a must keep for me!

Really really yummy, I usually make this with dream whip, don't know why I didn't think it would work with real Whipped cream. Silly silly me. It is Delicious. Just remember that you have to cream the cream cheese before mixing it with the whipped cream, something I always forget to do and then I end up with little lumps :( still tasty lumps and all :)Thank you for the recipe

This is great as no-bake cheesecake goes. I'm more of a NY girl, but this works in a hurry. Just be sure to add a little lemon juice. It's super sweet and you need the lemon to take some of the edge off.

Everyone loves this dessert...I'm forced to bring it to every family function. I add some real lemon zest and the juice of one lemon for an extra zing. Exceptional....

this recipe is awesome!  I baked the crust for about 8 minutes on 350 to give it a little crunch.  I've made it twice and it is delicious and gone so fast!

I gave this recipe only 3 stars because the crust didn't hold together.  I also added 4 oz of cream cheese to the filling for a total of 12 oz.  I wanted a lot of cream cheese flavour and I'm glad I added the extra - it would have been softer and less flavourful without.  I would definitely make this again with some changes.

I've been making a version of this recipe for years. It's always been a huge favorite and my  go to recipe when I need a great tasting dessert to bring somewhere. I bake a lot and it's one of my most requested recipes. I make my version in a 9" spring form pan so the proportions of cream cheese, whipped cream, vanilla  and powdered sugar are different. I also use butter, not margarine, in my graham cracker crust,  finely chopped toasted almonds for added crunch and flavor and a little less sugar in the crust.  You can make so many different versions by changing the fruit topping or adding to the cheesecake filling. One of my favorite is the Black Forrest.  Just cover the baked crust with chocolate ganache before adding the cream cheese filling and cherry topping, drizzle more ganache on top, letting it run down the sides of the cake. Beautiful and delicious!

Very good! I don't think it is too sweet if you actually whip your cream yourself... If you use store bought cook whip, that is already sweetened, so that may be why. It turned out very good, and was very easy! I did shortcut and use a storebought crust. Everything else, to the T. Thanks!

Really good. I only used 1/2 c of powdered sugar, as recommended by other. I think it could have used a little more. Next time I'll try 3/4 cup.

This is my first time baking unbaked cheesecake. It was GREAT! I made it for my boyfriend for valentine's day since he loves cheesecake. It was really simple and easy. I used a prepared graham cracker crust and skipped out on the topping. I had this made in no time, and it was gone in about three days!

As a mother to 7 very picky little ones. I loved this recipe. Not only was it easy to make but my kids could help because we didn't have to use the stove...
I did how ever double the recipe and still only used 1 cup of powdered sugar and 1 1/2 cups whipping cream.. I don't need that much sugar running there the veins...lol
 My family LOVED this... Thanks

I made this with my daughter, it was very easy.  You do have to be aware there are differences in no bake and regular cheesecake.  It was a very nice texture for no bake and I added 1/2 c. of regular yogurt for creaminess and to cut the sugar, actually doubled the recipe to make a 9x13 pan worked perfectly!

This cheesecake was DELICIOUS! I've also made it with fresh strawberries. Layered sliced strawberries in the middle of the cream mixture, and then on top to get as many strawberries as possible. It was sooooooo good!

Heavy whipping cream isn't cheap.  After 6 hours it was still runny.  I pourded out the ingredients and added a little flour and lemon juice to kind of "cook" it in the fridge.  We'll see in a couple of hours if this move saved the day or cake, whatever!!

This was my first time making cheesecake & it turned out really good. I used 12oz of cream cheese & 1/3 cup sugar because other reviews said it wasn't thick enough and was too sweet and my cheesecake turned out perfect. I left it in the fridge 6 hours and didn't have a problem with it being too soft. I will definitely use this recipe again & will probably make it a few times during the holidays.

A big favorite with everyone even people that don't like cheesecake.  I've made about a dozen with all different fruit toppings since discovering this receipe just 6 months ago!  Super simple and you can make it in about 5 minutes ( i buy premade crust).  The person who said it didn't come set probably didn't whip the whipped cream enough. Save money by buying fresh fruit or even canned fruit (not the pie filling stuff). Too good.

Excellent cheesecake recipe. This was my first time making a cheesecake from scratch and I found it very easy to prepare. I used a store-bought graham cracker crust and light cream cheese to conserve calories. I'm going to have the cheesecake set overnight so I'll see how that works with the consistency of it in the morning. Next time I might try modifying this recipe to be a strawberry cheesecake instead! That's the beauty of it: it's so versatile.

I made this for my husband's birthday, and everyone loved it! However, it tasted more cream than cheesecake, and the crust needed more butter or something - it completely broke apart when I added the filling.   Anyway! We will be keeping this recipe, as it was still wonderful.

For ease and taste I am giving this a five. It was delicious. Made it twice in one week, the first time with whipping cream, the second with cool whip. The whipping cream version was the best, wonderfully rich, but the cool whip substitution was very good. I used bought crusts both times. The filling was a bit soft even after 4 hours in the fridge. But considering how easy and how good this recipe tastes I really didn't care and neither did the friends and family who, after the first taste hoovered the cheesecake up in about 5 minutes.

Soooo easy and amazingly delicious. I did these in a muffin tin using Vanilla Wafers as a crust only because they were available. My goal was to have mini cheesecakes I could pack for my husbands' lunch. Worked beautifully.  Thank you for sharing. PS; this would be a lovely afterthought as a light dessert following a heavy holiday meal.

I found it took longer to set up than the recipe stated. I did sub the condensed milk for the powdered sugar etc.  Taste was excellant and the family loved it, even runny as they did not want to wait.  better once set.

I thought it tasted great, and so did everyone else at Christmas. I personally thought it was a tad too fluffy, so next time I might increase the cream cheese portion a bit and decrease the whipped heavy cream a tad. But was great as is!

This tasted pretty good, but it just isn't cheesecake.  It reminds me of a dessert my mom makes, called "peaches and cream", where she puts a layer of peaches (or variation) between the crust and filling.  I like mom's better - I think this recipe is just a bit too sweet and might be better with fresh fruit.  Really easy and worth a try, though.  If you love sweet desserts, this is a good one.

I have only saved this recipe to my recipe box for Jsracer's review, since that is also my mother's recipe for her no-bake cheesecake. That is the way I will always do my no-bake cheesecake. Thanks Jsracer!

I doubled the filling and made the rest exactly like it is. Perfect. I would really suggest to double you filling, if not it will be really thin and who wants a thin piece of cheesecake.

Excellent old recipe and so easy. My grandmother made this all the time for special occasions. Not a single drop left. She gave me the recipe and I make it for holidays. Always gets rave reviews on it. The only difference is that I buy the graham crackers in the box & my grandmother rolled them out and used more butter so they would press together easier. Great recipe and very rich.

I have a toddler and limited time to cook and prepare food.  This had easy ingredients, easy instructions, and it was cheap to make.  I didn't let it sit the amount of time required, making it made me really hungry.

Definitely a good starting point.  But I added only 3/4 cup of sugar to the cream cheese and it was still quite sweet.  I'll cut back a bit more the next time.

I've had this recipe since 1986 more or less. It's delicious. This past Christmas, my nephew obtained a cherry cheese cake recipe on the internet and asked me to give him a hand, so I made the cake. The ingredients were Philadelphia cheese, eagle brand, lemon juice and vanilla extract. It was good BUT NOTHING BEATS YOUR RECIPE posted above. I've had your recipe for 29 years now! Nobody has ever made a cherry cheese cake as DELICIOUS as yours!! Mmmmm

My family loved this recipe! I made 2 and experimented. I added an extra package (8oz) of cream cheese to give it a cheesier taste. Left it in the fridge overnight and it got nice and firm. Only downfall....they want more more more!!! Lol

The taste was delicious, but it never fully set up for me (despite keeping it in the fridge for three days before serving it). It was a mess to serve. Most no-bake cheesecakes call for lemon juice but this one didn't. I wonder if that made a difference?

My entire family loved this!  I made a snickerdoodle crust (we had a lot left that got crunchy!) and I topped it with caramel, but I was tempted to eat the filling directly out of the bowl.

Although delicious, after making this as written we decided that there wasn't enough cheese filling.  So for that recipe we gave it 4 stars. 

The we set about making our families changes.  First of all we have food allergies so we made the crust with gluten free graham crackers.  We added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the crust as well.  After pressing it into the pie plate, I baked it for 11 min. at 350.  

For the filling I used 1 and 1/2 packages of low fat  cream cheese, 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice, 1/2 cup Splenda sugar blend and 2 cups True Whip organic whip topping.  I chilled this while the crust baked.  After the crust was completely cooled, I added the cheese filling and then topped it with homemade cherry pie filling.  I chilled it for 4 hrs.  Before serving I topped each slice with a dollop of True whip.  

I made 2 pies for a dinner party the other night and they were all gone by the time our 8 guests left.   Everyone had seconds.

This is the most delicious cheese cake ever! So light and fluffy, its the perfect desert!! The cheese flavor in this recipe was just right in comparison to the other recipe I had tried before (Best No-Bake Cheesecake). But I did add the 1/2 tsp cinnamon powder to the crust and the 2 tsp lemon juice to the cream in this one. And it turned out just perfect. My husband and his work friends loved it so much that we have to throw another party for them, just so they would get the cake again! Thanks a lot for this recipe.

I made the filling only to serve as a dip with baby graham crackers at a pool party. It was yummy! The kids especially loved it. The filling didn't hold it's shape outside (mid-80s in temp) but it would keep it's shape if held in a fridge.

This is amazing! My first time making cheesecake too! I poured mine into 11 cupcake tins and took them to work. They were a HIT! We all had cheesecake and coffee for breakfast. FUN! 
I made mine sugar free though and by golly it was delicious!  

For the Graham Cracker Crust: 
I used Nabisco Honey Graham Crackers. In place of the 1/4 cup margarine I used 1/8 cup regular butter and 1/8 cup coconut oil. In place of the 1/4 cup of sugar I used 5-6 packets of Truvia.

Filling:
For the 1 cup of powdered sugar I used 1-1/2 Tsp of Sweet Leaf.

It has a cottage cheese consistency. i used regular sugar, a little less than called for it was perfect sweetness that way, and also i recommend letting the crust brown in the oven a little bit so it has a more attractive color. I topped with caramel and chopped pecans, very happy with recipe

I loved it! It's very easy to make. I personally don't like too sweet dessert, so I had to make a few chages for this one as well. Instead of reducing the sugar, I added more heavy cream (300 mL). I also added 1 tbsp of lemon juice for a bit tang. And, I made the topping using fresh blueberries, sugar, lemon juice, and corn starch. YUM! For those who want to make sure the crust won't fall apart, you can bake it at 175 degrees C for 7-8 minutes. I know it's out of the concept 'unbaked' but I'd like the perfect crust to go with the perfect cheesecake.

My husband gives it a 4 star rating.  I'd give it only 3.  It isn't that it's too sweet - it's too sweet in the absence of a defined flavor. Contrary to some other reviewers, it did set up very well after 2.5 hrs in the fridge.  I used my own baked pastry shell, which I really liked but I'm not likely to make it again unless I add some flavour - perhaps chocolate.  It is really easy and quick to make though.

This cheesecake is delicious even without the cherry topping. It's very light and creamy without the sour, tangy taste that some cheesecakes have and it is so, so easy to make. Well done!

I've made this dessert many times before but I normally use Coolwhip or Dreamwhip. But I am living in Denmark right now and cannot find either, so I was really happy to find this recipe that used real whipped cream! I did cut down on the sugar a little, used butter instead of margarine and changed the topping to crushed pineapple and shredded coconut, but that was just personal preference. I tripled the recipe and made two big cheesecakes, not only got rave reviews but the guys we had over for Easter dinner were begging to take home leftovers haha

While it tasted good, it never firmed up, and the grahamn crackers didn't solidify well. It ended up having to use a spoon for the entire thing.

This is a lot like the boxed no bake cheesecake BUT MUCH BETTER!  My husband is picky when it comes to cheesecake and he raved about this one.  Everything is perfect and it is so easy. We eat it without the cherry topping, but it would be great with it too. A tip for light and fluffy cheesecake is to whip the mixture on high after adding the whipping cream.  It takes a few minutes.  I usually go until just after stiff peaks form.  Then spread into the crust and stick in the fridge to set.  The IS the best unbaked cheesecake ever.

Taste was definitely a 5 - a fantastic recipe. However, cutting the cheesecake was pretty messy business and the presentation was a little unimpressive. I had to scoop it out.

I have made this recipe several times over the past few months, and every time it has been gone in minutes!  Everyone seems to love this, even my hubby who doesn't eat desserts.  I also made a 'Key Lime' variation by adding a bunch of lime juice and lime zest to the cream cheese mixture.  Due to the extra liquid from the lime juice, I used half the recommended amount of vanilla and mixed in extra powdered sugar until it seemed thick enough.  Super tasty, especially with some candied lime slices on top.

YUM! I double this and place it in an oblong glass dish.  I have made this many many times and always use a small tub of cool whip (for double the recipe) in place of the whipping cream.  This is hard to beat for being quick, easy and super good!

I have been looking for a good, creamy cheesecake reciepe for years and finally found this one.  It was wonderful! I did add a little bit of lemon zest to give it a little bit of kick and it came out great.  Either way, the reciepe was an awesome one and thanks for posting it!  I now have a new cheesecake reciepe for the books.

I am a big cheesecake fan baked and unbaked.  I liked the taste of this mix better before the whipped cream was added.  That said I think the whipped cream dilutes the flavor enough that even non cheesecake lovers (as I've read in other reviews) will like it alot.  Next time I might half the whipped cream to get a little more of the cheesy flavor I love. I doubled the recipe and that worked fine, made enough so that there was some left the next day.   Also next time wil top it with fresh fruit and cut the sugar by 1/3 as the amount of sugar makes this pretty sweet, too sweet for us.

This is the best cheesecake I've ever made, I put it in cupcake holders so I wouldn't have to cut it for my class, it worked really well. My teacher loved it, my video didn't even work and I still got 100%! It is really easy to make and very creamy.

I left this cheesecake in the refrigerator for 15 hours and it still didn't set up...I think this recipe should call for more cream cheese. Other than the texture, it tasted like a cheesecake, just not as thick as I like it.

Reduced the sugar to half, dded lemon juice and melted the butter as recommended.  I also doubled the recipe as suggested by another reviewer, and ended up with two pies.  That was great for us.  I took one to my sister's for Christmas and kept one home for us! :-)

i love this recipe!! its so easy n fun to make.. the only thing is the thickness of the cream cheese.. its really tough so u have to work your way through it but after a while it softens i wud recommend either getting whipped cream cheese or mush it with ur fingers to soften it.. overall its a really good recipe n everyone enjoyed it in my house!!

Although I am not a fan of cheesecake in general, I made this for my husband's birthday. It was my first cheesecake, and I have to say it tasted much better than the baked kind that you get in restaurants. I can even say I kind of liked it, not to mention it being very easy. So I will use this recipe if making cheesecake ever again in the future. (And yes, my husband also loved it)

pretty good, super easy (my husband could make it without burning the house down). i had an abundance of nilla wafers, so i used them for the crust and left out the sugar, good way to cut back.

This was really a very delicious cheesecake. Probably the best one I've eaten since I started baking. The taste was just right: not too sweet, nor too sour. I recommend it!! Although, my only advice would be using a large bowl when mixing, so that everything doesn't go flying out of the bowl! And since I don't like cherries, I used strawberries. Came out pretty good. Yumm!

It's pretty good. I would like a thinner but firmer crust. Next time I'll add more butter. I used fresh strawberries instead of cherry pie filling. For a no bake cheesecake - it was really good.

Great recipe, my husbands favourite dessert!  Although I did use 1/4 cup more butter in the crust because it was not sticking together well.

Very Tasty and quite easy! The crust however seemed to be kind of crumbly and maybe not quite enough. I think I'll make another half again of the crumb crust next time.

This cheesecake is excellent. I melted the butter in the microwave than put the crust together. It stayed together perfectly. Did not crack or break. I made this the night before as it holds together better once it's firm. I made it for a dinner party and everyone wanted the recipe...Fabulous. I don't know what people are talking about by the appearance. You have to firmly pack the crust together so it holds well.

This is incredibly easy to put together and make! It turns out being light and creamy, yet somehow in a way, quite fluffy. It is a very very soft and happy cheesecake! I will make this again and again. And what a great crust! I had to write this recipe down for everyone that ate it! They all loved it that much!

My daughter and her friend were making a goodbye dinner for their friends, one is going into the RAF and the other is off to university. She rang me from the supermarket wanting a recipe for cherry cheesecake which needed to be ready in about 4 hours. I found this one for her. They reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and increased the cream cheese to 12 ounces. They mistakenly bought fresh cherries instead of pie filling. So they heated the cherries up with some lemon zest, sugar and water. I'm told the boys were very impressed and want a repeat performance when they come home at Christmas. My daughter and her friend thank you LuCynda.

I made this for Christmas and it was very quick and easy.  Tasted great.  I used Splenda instead of sugar since I'm diabetic.  My friends who aren't diabetic loved it as well.

Made this for dessert for Christmas and it was a huge hit.  Made small adjustments.  Added a bit of leftover chocolate graham crackers for a mixture of honey grahams and chocolate, would use a bit more margarine next time, was very loose.  Also put into a springform pan instead of the pie pan.  Used a large can of pie filling, filled the whole top with cherries and the presentation was very festive.  Great no bake recipe and the results were awesome, with several requests for the recipe.

I doubled the ingredients and put it into a 9x13 pan, otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  It turned out great, cut up very nicely! I had an older recipe that I made with cool whip topping but the whipped cream in this recipe is WAY better!  Made again for a party, finishing it without topping and had cherry pie filling, crushed pineapple and blueberry pie filling on the side so guests could choose their own! Perfect... it's a winner recipe!

The cheesecake was really good. I did cut the sugar in half for the filling. The crust was good but really crumbly.

This was my first time trying to make cheesecake, so I thought an unbaked version would be a good place to start.  I was giving it as a gift to my brother. The cheesecake itself tasted fine, but the crust would not hold together.  It completely crumbled into a pile of dust, even after leaving it in the fridge overnight!!  I had even snuck in a tiny bit of extra margarine, but it obviously didn't help.  I was sooo embarrassed!!

love this recipe! Important to whip the cream then fold it into the cream cheese mixture.  Also added some cinnamon or pumpkin pie spice into graham crumb mixture to add a bit of flavor.  I also add some real lemon into cream cheese mixture.  my family loves it. I have to double as I have a big family

For the crust instead of using sugar I use brown sugar the crust stays together, packs easier and moist. Instead of heavy whipping cream I use 1 tub frozen whipped cream lite dethawed. I have made this same recipe about 8x's with perfect luck and never a drop left... Everyone loves this! Topped with blueberry pie filling and add fresh blueberries from the fruit section small container, sometimes will use cherry pie filling have also used the sweet pie filling add fresh strawberries any one is a treat anytime of the year. I also have done double batch in cake pan half cherry on top half blueberry that way everyone gets their FAC.

This is my go-to dessert!  It's so easy to make, doubles easily and always turns out great!!!  My husband is diabetic so I substitute Stevia for the white sugar and reduce the amount of icing sugar by about 1/3 of a cup.  My family loves it with raspberry pie fill for a topping but I have also made it with fresh strawberries and it was awesome!

I used gingerbread cookie crumbs in place of graham, just because I needed to use them up.  Ironed out great!

My family has been making this cheese cake for over 30 years. It is still one of the favorites for a pot luck. Try blueberry or apple pie filling for a different taste. Make it faster with cool whip. Super easy, super tasty

I made this as written, as well as with the variations by jsracer in the reviews. The version by jsracer was amazing. The original recipe tasted just dreadful.

I really wanted to blame the weird after taste on the heavy cream and the fact that I don't often have cream, or maybe it was off? But I only opened the carton for this recipe, and I triple checked the best-before date - I had over a month left to use the cream.

I actually threw out the cheesecake - quite a feat for me. I don't want to risk doing that again so I'll just play it safe and stick with the condensed milk version of this recipe.

Everyone loves this dessert!! So quick to make too. I doubled the recipe. I love vanilla so I added 1/2 tsp to the graham crust and 3 tsp to the cream cheese/whipped cream mixture (doubled recipe). Otherwise everything was as is in recipe. The cream cheese/whip cream mixture had a distinct lemon taste without adding lemon juice...due to the extra tsp of vanilla?This recipe tastes better and lighter than the one I used to make with Cool Whip.

It was so easy to do and it was absolutely delicious! Fluffy, light, and tasty! The only thing that I would do differently is that I would add a bit more butter/margarine to the crust in order to make it less crumbly. It was a challenge to remove it from the pan. Otherwise, it was perfect.

Yes. This has been a favorite birthday pie for fifty years.
We called cherry o cream cheese pie.we didn’t use sugar, but used sweetened condensed milk. Added 1/4th lemon juice which is nevesseey to thicken the filling

This recipe surprised me at how easy it was to make. I didn’t use canned topping because my family likes it plain. I would, however, be careful with overbearing the cream cheese because mine came out like whipped cheesecake instead of the classic, thick cream texture.

Was wonderful esp since I didn't have to start oven in warm weather.  Put fresh blueberries and vanilla sugar on top since I didn't have any canned cherry filling. 

Was a little too liquidy. Next time I will add a little less cream. Thank for the recipe.

It’s absolutely delicious and easy! Since I don’t care for pie filling I’ve topped it with a raspberry sauce and have also simply used frozen raspberries or frozen mixed fruit (raspberries, strawberries, blackberries & blueberries) to save time. I usually double the recipe and make it in a 13 x 9 pan for a lot of guests and/or leftovers! Always a hit ??

Objectively this is lovely, but it's definitely sweeter than I was expecting. Next time I will cut the powdered sugar by about half. Otherwise, straightforward and tasty!

I've used this filling recipe time and time again for the past 5 years. It never disappoints. I've turned it in to cheesecakes, cheesecake shooters, cheesecake ice cream.. It's a winning recipe. People who aren't crazy about dry baked cheesecakes love this. I now make it several times a year for friends' Birthdays because it has become a favourite in my friend group. It's fantastic with any topping and any crust. Actually, one of my favourites was this layered with lemon curd inside a shortbread crust. Delicious.

The crust is not a very good recipe. It is too loose and a lot of it. Needs more butter.  I  would also bake and cool it before filling.

I have a similar recipe for a no-bake cheesecake.  The only difference (and this is helpful for those bakers who don't normally stock heavy whipping cream) is to use a package of Dream Whip prepared.

What I particularly like about this recipe is that it is the perfect, basic platform for an icebox cheesecake and easy to get creative with.  I had a little more than 8ozs of cream cheese left of a 3# block, so I added a little more powdered sugar.  In addition to the vanilla extract, I added a little lemon extract to brighten it up.  I didn't have heavy cream, but I had whipped topping.  In it went.  I have ripe peaches, so I'm going to grill them, slice them and top with them and a dollop of Cool Whip.  This is the PERFECT fast go-to refrigerator cheese pie.  Get creative!

This cheesecake was so light, fluffy, and delicious! I put 4 stars because it took a while for my cake to become firm, and I had to put it in the freezer for about an hour. WARNING: Don't leave it on the counter! My poor cheesecake began to melt. Keep it refrigerated! Side note: I used vanilla graham crackers for the crust, it tasted amazing.

One of the easiest desserts I've ever made - and it tastes so good! I did buy a pre-made crust though, but that's because it was Sunday and I was extra lazy.

Have made this recipe for years under the title of Cherry Delight. It's a staple for Christmas dessert in our house.  It does help if you refrigerate this  for a short period between adding layers. (ie) refrigerate briefly after  making the crust then again after adding cream cheese mixture but before putting cherries on top. then finally adding cherries and refrigerating till it's done. It gives it a nicer, cleaner appearance.

This is so close to my recipe, instead of heavy cream I choose lite cool whip to cut the fat. Other than that this is dollar for dollar the same recipe I have been making for many years. My Aunt Francis made it first and I fell so in love with it I have been making it ever since.

great recipe! I used others suggestions and whipped the cream separately and added 2/3 cup sugar. I also made homemade cherry pie filling since it is cherry season. will definitely make again!

Modified this into a chocolate cheesecake by reducing the whipped cream to 1/2 cup and adding 1/2 cup of chocolate ganache (chocolate chips and 2% milk melted together). Very, very nice. This is my default cheesecake recipe from now on!

This was absolute garbage and that is exactly where it is...in the garbage. As others stated, it never 'set' (even after sitting untouched in the fridge for 24 hours), super sweet, and came out like a runny mousse. Very disappointing in both the person who submitted this recipe, and the people who approved it. 

If you want a simple, and GOOD, cheesecake google Philadelphia's 3 step cheesecake. Yes you have to bake it but it's 1000 times better than this monstrosity they dare call a "cheesecake".

I don't care for cheesecake however, I needed a dessert to go with a dinner I was preparing for a close friend who had recently lost her mother and this pie turned out perfect! I used lite cream verses heavy and it set up great!

The first time I made this was about 2 weeks ago, a total runny mess! I didn't have heavy cream, so i looked up a substitute (butter&milk) for heavy cream and used it in place- what they failed to say was that for the substitute use for "cooking and baking" purposes only, not for "no bake" foods. Found that out on another site! As I said it turned into a runny mess that sat in our fridge for nearly a week!!! So today I made sure I had the heavy cream and I also kneaded the cream cheese and let sit out at room temp, before mixing (about 20-30 min). I added in 2tsp of lemon juice to aid in holding shape and 1 1/2 cream cheese, instead of the one.  It held perfect form when putting into pre-made shell I will never make that mistake again! As for the taste - D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!!   Creamy and nicely formed to cut into.- very happy with this recipe, Thank you!

I made 2 no bake cheesecakes for a get together last night, and this one was, no doubt, a million times easier than the other I chose to make.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very sweet, as others have said, but it's cheesecake.. why would you expect anything else?! The only thing I changed was added 2 tsp of lemon juice to the filling, as another reviewer had recommended. The cheesecake was delicious! Everyone loved it, and there was no leftovers of this one by the end of the night. I'm not a big fan of cheesecake, or sweets really, but I had a hard time sticking to my "just one bite."

I used chocolate graham cracker crusted. Melted white chocolate on top of the crust before adding the cheesecake batter along with skme raspberries.  Then after the batter i melted a light layer again of white chocolate with raspberry.

Like another reviewer I use condensed milk instead of the sugar/heavy cream combo. The splash of lemon juice is also a must I find. Sometimes I throw blueberry filling on top. 

The only other thing I would suggest, and it might not be for everyone, I like to pop my version in the freezer to make it nice and solid before cutting. Find it's easier to plate and easier to eat.

Definitely need to bake the graham cracker crust for 7 minutes.  The crust fell apart while dishing it.  It was very nice light pie.  My son is making it today after having a piece on the 4 th of July.

Make it better by whipping the cream separately then folding it into the cream cheese  mixture.  Make sure your beaters are  clean before whipping the cream.

I have been making this for years.....got the original recipe in my son's recipe book when he was in 2nd grade.   He is now 49.  The recipes were from all the moms in his class.   This goes over wonderful.  Made 2 of them last week for a golf tournament and they went quick!!!  Super easy too!

Really good. I added lemon juice as a few suggested. I baked the crust for 8 minutes as someone else said.  Lemon juice was good. Baking crust was bad. I had to chisel the crust out of the dish although it still tasted great.

This was probably the best cheesecake I have ever eaten! Although I would classify it as a cheesecake pie seeing as it's in a pie tin ;) This was my first time attempting anything like this and it was definitely a success! I found the cherry filling overpowering, but maybe if I used less of it instead of covering the whole top of the pie it would be better. I also think it would be pure bliss if I used chopped strawberries and sugar instead of cherries. Just an idea ;)

Amazing cherry cheesecake. I made this 4 or 5 times and everyone was blown away by how light & fluffy it was...then I finally realized the original recipe only calls for 1 CUP of whipped cream. I use 1 QUART (473 mL) of whipping cream! I'll keep making it my "messed up" way because it's sooooo good!

Good. Only change I made was 2 cream cheese. If it's too soft, your not whipping your cream before adding it. Mine was a nice consistency before I even put in the fridge. I'm also guessing if it was too sweet, it was because you used cool whip instead. I plan to use it next time in mini jars and have a variety of toppings people can add themselves.

My mom used to make this style cheesecake every year. Now that I am older I make it for Christmas and its DELICIOUS! It does not have the same consistency as regular cheesecake but that's what I love about it, not a fan of "regular cheesecake" try this one! :)

This was a very easy recipe to make and was delicious. My only change was I used strawberry rhubard, instead of cherry. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I followed jsracer's adaptation and used sweetened condensed milk instead of the powdered sugar and heavy cream.  I also added 1/4 cup lemon juice.  To make the consistency more like baked cheesecake, I dissolved 1/2 package gelatin in 5 tablespoons water for 10 minutes.  Then heated this with the 1/4 cup lemon juice to completely dissolve the gelatin.  Added this to the cream cheese and sweetened condensed milk.  Poured in pie shell and refrigerated several hours.  Great consistency.

Love this recipe!  I made this today in about 10 minutes flat...including the time it took me to find the whisker!  I made this in individual sizes so I put a gingersnap cookie in the bottom of a glass (I like the taste better than a vanilla wafer) and then added the filling.  I topped with fresh berries and job done.  I definitely used less sugar, probably about half a cup.  I tend not to measure things...  This was sweet enough for us.  I think next time I will add some lemon juice to give it just a bit of zing.  Other than that, I love this recipe!  Will definitely be making again.

I recommend baking the crust at 350-375*F for 8-10 min as well as adding a tsp of vanilla plus lemon juice for a subtle enhanced flavour. I also used Cool Whip (and Dream Whip on another occasion) and it turned out just as well.

Not really as good as cheesecake; but it is delicious without the comparison. My family called this Woof'em Poof'em Pie (a name my father-in-law coined - he loved incredibly sweet desserts!).

I used regular white sugar and a store bought crust, thought it would make more so was planning on using home made for the second crust.. my mistake. :)   I also use butter, marg is icky. lol  I love this recipe, so easy I could make one every day of the week till I am sick of it..like that would ever happen.  Thank you for the great recipe. Only gave it 4 stars because I changed two ingrediants slightly,  4 stars for ease of making and how fast it disappeared after I set it on the table.

This really lives up to it's name! I made to take to a friend so the only change I made was to use a store bought graham cracker crust so it would be easier to transport. It was so easy and really delicious! It set up great and I didn't think it was too sweet at all-my husband doesn't usually eat a lot of sweets and he loved this! (I made an extra one for us!)

I read the reviews about it sometimes not setting and how some thought it was too sweet, and I didn't want to pre-whip the cream, so I added about 1/4 cup of lemon juice which a)helped the cream set and b)balanced the sweetness. Delicious.

I took another reviewer's suggestion of melting the butter and it worked perfectly.

I'll make this recipe again.

My favourite recipe for cheesecake.  It is not as heavy as regular cheesecake.  You can vary your toppings-cherry, strawberry, raspberry or blueberry. It is best to mix the cream cheese with the powdered sugar then mix the cream by itself and add to the cream cheese mixture. Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe.  I prefer only 1/2 cup powered sugar.
My topping of sweetened blueberries or strawberries;  makes the pie
sweet enough. I make topping of about 1/2 cup frozen berries or
fresh and some sugar to personal preference  plus  about 1 to
2 tbs. cornstarch in a pot on med heat cooked till real thick. Take 
off stove and when still  hot add rest of frozen berries of about 3/4 to l cup and it will cool and  thicken consistency of brought pie filling.
My special crust has 1/4 to 1/2 cup of finely chopped pecans
added to 1/2 cup each of whole wheat and white unbleached flour
mixing with l stick melted butter. Then, pressing this into
a very large pie pan  or 9" by 13" cake pan  baking at 350 till browned slightly. When cust is  completely cool
add the filling and cool all in refrigerator or freeze for
later.

We loved this recipe! I did not have all the right ingredients so the cheesecake did not set up all the way but it was still great! I cant wait to try it with the right ingredients! My husband said this is his new favorite so I will be using this as our new base recipe.

Quick and easy,not a lot of ingredients,it's not a heavy cheesecake ,nice and light and tasty,I cooked fresh strawberries in a pot with a little sugar and a little water,and thickened it with cornstarch let it get cold and spread on the cheesecake and topped it off with a little whipped cream .Sooooooooooo Good!!

I followed the recipe with the exception of using less sugar.  Even after being in the fridge overnight, the cake never fully set up and is still very sweet.  The good news is it's very easy to  make and tastes great!

This is a fantastic recipe! Made it for New Year 2011 and made it again after 2 days. We just can't get enough of it!  However, I did not follow the measurements exactly as I live in Europe where cups are not common at all. We use dl here. Here is the measurements I made to fit a 9" round springform pan (just the filling):  450g cream cheese 1 dl powdered sugar 1 dl vanilla sugar 2.2 dl heavy cream fresh strawberries to top it  It was a definite hit! We all loved it and the kids kept coming back for more! Will do again!

I love making this! With a pre-made crust it takes 10m of prep. It has a fabulous consistency and tastes just as good with or without cherry/strawberry topping.. Everyone raves about how good it is and always say "this must take you forever!" It's the best cheesecake, even better than some restaurants.

I read alot of the other reviews and so I took some of their advice and cut the sugar down and I loved it and so did my Hubby.  I am going to make the cherry toping myself the next time.  I am making it for my family this Tuesday.

I made the crust using chocolate graham crackers instead, and after adding the whipped cream to the cream cheese mixtured, I beat it on low for just a bit longer. I also added just a little bit (1 TSP) of lemon juice. It IS on the sweet side, but we like it like that! Thanks!

AWESOME!!! LOVED IT!!!! We will make again. I dislike canned cherry pie filling, so I made a homemade bumbleberry pie topping with blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries, and wow - complemented it. My husband is already asking me to make it again, and he normally doesn't even eat dessert.

Thanks for sharing a great recipe! I made this for a crowd and it got rave reviews! The only problem was my own fault. I used too big a pan and had more crumbs than filling. I might not of whipped it long enough after adding the whipping cream or I needed to increase the cheesecake part of it more than I did as I increased the recipe for a crowd. Despite that Everyone said it tasted great and, after tasting it myself, I agree on the taste.

This a very easy and tasty recipe. I had some of the cream cheese mixture left and I had some whole graham crackers left. So I spread the mixture between the graham crackers and made sandwiches! It was totally awesome :)

On the whole it was delicious - the crust was far too crumbly so I would add more butter next time.

Pretty good recipe though I used it more as a reference for making a gluten-free low-sugar version that my diabetic pal & I could both eat. I was able to reduce the sugar by making my own cherry pie filling and making a nut crust but the biggest way I reduced sugar was by adding it a little at a time and tasting it.  I also used real butter, melted for the crust and neufchatel cheese for less fat. I also found that it didn't hold its form very well  until I found a tip in an old Martha Stewart mag that says you have to freeze it for an hour before cutting with dental floss and keep it frozen until one hour before you serve it. But it's a great recipe that opened up my cheesecake loving world!  Come summer I will make this all the time.

Great recipe! I'm not really a cheesecake fan, but this was amazing. I added a little lemon juice to the cream cheese mixture and mixed everything until it was realy creamy. It made it very easy to fold in the whipped cream. I made individual cheesecakes with a shortbread crust instead of graham. Delicious!

We have made a similar cheesecake for years - we add 1or 2 drops of almond extract to the cherry pie filling to cut the sweetness a bit, and we use regular sugar rather than powdered. We find the consistency similar to baked cheesecake after chilling.

Delicious!  Very sweet.  I doubled the recipe and used two bags of frozen blueberries as the topping.  I heated them in a pan on the stove with a little sugar You probably don't need to add sugar because it is already very sweet.

This recipe is PERFECT the way it is.  Tonight I tried it with the sweetened condensed milk, and it is really, really, REALLY sweet.  It's still quite tasty, but not nearly as creamy and smooth as this cake is with the whipping cream.  This is our go to cheesecake recipe and we LOVE it!!!

YUM! YUM! YUM!! I used strawberry filing instead of cherry - delicious!  I received one complaint that the filing took over the taste of the cheesecake so maybe less filling or more cheesecake mix next time.  I was nervous about the crust but the way it turned out and ctumbled was great.

I followed this recipe to the T but substituted strawberry filling for cherry, and everyone loved it! It was gone in one day.

I made this cheesecake a week ago and only 2 pieces are gone so I guess it wasn't a hit! I def would NOT add the lemon juice that was recommended unless you want a lemon cheesecake!

it is absolutely divine! i made it with Light cream cheese and since i didn't have cream i used a tub of light cool whip to make it a little less of a calorie punch to the gut. overall a wonderful creation! :D

I loved the taste of it, but my crust didn't set up at all - I think next time I will use melted butter/marg.  My husband loved it too and was very upset to come home and find I had eaten the last piece!!!

This was really tasty cheesecake. I will make it again, the only thing I had a problem with is it didn't settle well. I think you have to leave it longer than 2-3 hours.

Having just made this, I can honestly say it's the best 'none back' cheesecake I've tried in a long time.  However, I changed the base from Graham Crackers to Gingersnaps as I dont like the Graham crackers, I find they dont give the base a nice crunch.

For this recipe, I cut back the powdered sugar to 3/4 of a cup, and I didn't use quite 1/4 of a cup sugar for the crust. When I tried to get the cheesecake out of the pie container, it fell apart and ended up looking like a blob on the plate. But the taste was wonderful! It was very soft and creamy. It is not something I would serve a guest based on the appearance factor, but the taste was wonderful! Thanks for sharing.

This was so good and easy.  Had my reservations, but as soon as I took a bite, they were put to rest.  Will definitely make this again.  Thanks.
