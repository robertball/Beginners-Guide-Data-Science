I made this with some homemade cinnamon raisin bread (well, made with a bread machine). I agree to cut back on the milk (I used unsweetened almond milk), and I recommend using homemade bread for this because itâ€™s hardier and I had no issues with sogginess because of it. So this recipe works well using homemade bread (and for a hardier break I recommend wheat bread flour). My french toast turned out perfectly tender but crispy and the raisin bread element really made it better. So thank you, as someone with an intolerance to eggs and dairy I am very excited to be able to make french toast when I want it.

This turned out okay. I used about 1/4 cup less milk. Be sure to turn your heat down to medium or medium low, otherwise your toast will burn before it's fully cooked. I used vegan orange cranberry breakfast rounds for my bread. I left out the sugar and added 1 tsp vanilla.

I used cashew milk instead of soy milk (the submitter suggested  that we could use an alternate non-dairy milk). The French toast seemed a little soggy to me...not firm, but it still tasted ok.
