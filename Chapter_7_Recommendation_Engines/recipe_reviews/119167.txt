This is a good one.
I made a couple changes though. I added some water to the pan after I removed the onions and scraped up any little bits left in the pan, then I added splash of sherry and I used basil and a shake of garlic salt instead of the oregano I did not have.
Yum. My picky eaters really raved! I will make this again. Very easy.

We loved this recipe. Barely had any left for lunch the next day! I added some minced garlic while cooking the onion, 1/2 C milk to the mushroom soup, actually used 2 cans of soup for extra gravy. I also added some chopped bacon because I had some from breakfast I didn't want to waste. My husband and I had it over mashed potatoes but I served some spiral pasta for my picky toddlers. Definately a keeper!

This was fantastic!  I used Sirloin that was too tough for steaks and sliced into 1.5 inch strips.  I did add just a little water because I had more meat than called for, but it came out great!  I added a tiny bit more salt as well.  It was nice and tender and falling part so I served over egg noodles. This one's a keeper!

Fantastic.  the only thing I changed was I used 2 cans of the cream of mushroom.  I prepared this in 20 min before work and all I did when I got home was prepare some white rice that I covered with the mushroom soup gravy the meat cooked in.  The whole family loved it and we will be making this dish again and again.

The flavor of this steak was very good. Next time I will cut the pieces a little larger as I lost a great deal of meat because it was so tender. I'm always looking for new ways to cook round steak, this one's a keeper.

While this was very easy to prepare, I thought it had an off flavor to it and I'm thinking it might be the thyme which I don't usually cook with.  I'll try this one again w/o the thyme.

I used cube steak for this recipe. I also decided to saute the onions and make an onion gravy rather than using cream of mushroom soup. I added a little worstershire sauce and the steaks turned out tender and flavorful. Thanks for sharing, Dona!

I grew up with my grandma making this for us.  She usually served it with mashed potatoes, but since I had lots of egg noodles, we had our over noodles.  Great either way.  This is just easy, slow-cooked comfort food.

I baked this in a covered casserole dish at 250 degrees for 2.5-3 hrs and it turned out great!  The oregano and thyme added a nice extra flavor to an old classic.

This was okay, but something about it didn't suit my family.  I can't put my finger on the problem.  I probably won't make this again.

This recipe was a huge hit. I added a little cream to the soup because I wanted to use it up out of my frige but next time I will just add a little milk. I served it over rice and it was great.

very good.  I added minced garlic and bay leaves to the sauce as well and about 30 minutes before it was done, I added fresh mushrooms.   I might add another can of cream of msuhroom soup next time just to make it extra saucy or I may use cream of celery or broccoli just to switch it up.  We loved it!

This is a great recipe! 
I substituted Cream of Celery soup for the Mushroom because my husband is allergic to mushrooms.
I used two cans of soup, thanks to another review, and added 1/2 can of water with the soup.
My husband LOVED this!  The meat was tender and there was plenty of gravy for our mashed potatoes!
Wonderful!

okay.. for the record.. i hate the slow cooker... so i used my pressure cooker. This is the perfect dish to cook "tough" meat. It was quick and tasty.... I followed all the instructions except, i put it in my pressure cooker. i also added a clove of garlic and sliced fresh mushrooms with the onions and about 1 1/4 cup of broth to the pot for a little extra liquid. once it presssurized, i let it cook for 15 minutes on med/high. I served it over egg noodles.

This was ok, I did not like the oregano-thyme taste but thats just me. I doubt I would fix this again, but others may like it.

This is an awesome tasting recipe for round steak. I do double the mushroom soup, oregano and thyme just because it is so good. I serve with mashed potatoes so makes a great gravy that you don't even know is mushroom soup. My son wanted it made at least once a week when he was home but I'm still making it as a great meal to serve for guests since it goes in the crock pot. And so easy!! We love it!!

steak was easy to prepare but came out a little dry.
