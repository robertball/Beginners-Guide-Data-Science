They seem to be missing something other than just vanilla extract.

I made these and for some reason they were extremely thick and felt like there was way too much baking powder? I am not sure because I made a large batch and they were very dense and I had to add extra milk and an egg

I only used 1 TBS of oil.  The dough was extremely thick, so I added 1/2 cup more milk.  We do not use whole milk, so I substituted half and half.  And they are good without any sugar!

So I kept the measurements the same, but substituted whole wheat flower, coconut oil, and almond milk. Easily the best pancakes I've ever made.  The batter didn't cling to anything like it usually does which always irritates me. Thanks for the recipe!

There was way too much baking soda it ended up tasting like baking soda. I rescued it with more of the other ingredients but even then its still really baking-soda-y. I think its supposed to be a teaspoon instead of tablespoon.

Perfect recipe. Love that if I want to change it up with flavor or thinning this recipe is easily adaptable. This is in my Keeper list.

Very easy recipe to make, came out more as a hot cake than pancake but we're very good... next time I make this I'm going to add flavorings such as maple, raspberry or lemon...

They were very good but pretty thick and cakey. I added some vanilla to the batter, but wished I had added about a tablespoon of sugar as well. I would make them again with those additions.

I know so many of you don't like it when we review a recipe that we made changes to but that's how a lot of us cook. I look at the recipe as a base to work from. I didn't want to use a recipe where I had to sift flour. I wanted fast and easy and this worked! The only things I did differently was I used gluten free flour. Instead of oil I used unsweetened applesauce and I added about a 1/2 tbsp of vanilla and 1/8 cup of stevia. And of course I put chocolate chips in the last half of the batter. Victor likes his that way but I'm trying to stay away from sugar!
