This was fun to make but alot of patience. After seperating the marshmallows in different bowls it was hard to work with. After I put the coloring in and mixed it I microwaved for 10 sec. more then put the cereal in. It seemed to help the color. I used water on my fingers instead of butter. The colors aren't so good as the picture. Looks good, hope people like them.
