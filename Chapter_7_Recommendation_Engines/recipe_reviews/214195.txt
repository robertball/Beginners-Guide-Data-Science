This was tasty!  I did not add the banana chips, but everything else is the same.  It made a great dinner on a hot day!

This salad was okay.  I probably had higher expectations of it than I should have.  I love goat cheese and coconut and the combination intrgued me.  A salad bite without goat cheese had very little flavor to it.

This salad was delicious.  It was light, but yet filling.  Our guests barely touched the other dishes.  I cannot wait to make it again.

My wife and I really liked this salad.  This was the first time I’ve used a mango in a recipe - thank goodness for YouTubes on how to peel and dice a mango.  The only thing I changed was that I used feta cheese instead of goat cheese, because my wife prefers it (and we had it on hand).  I’m sure this changed the taste, but it still tasted good.  Great spring and summer recipe and pretty easy to put together even for a kitchen klutz like me.

My husband and I love this salad.  I made some modifications.  I fry the shrimp in butter not oil.  I don't use the mango or banana chips but instead use fresh strawberries and fresh pineapple and some dried cranberries.

We liked it but the dressing was missing something. I will make this again and try some other dressing. Loved the tropical flavors with the spinach. I had a bag of Cranberries and nuts so I added that in too. Very good.

Delicious!  My husband wanted a new, yummy salad for his birthday dinner, and this was it!  A new favorite, I didn't change a thing.
