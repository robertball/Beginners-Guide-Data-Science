Pretty tasty. Very different than any Iâ€™ve had before. I chopped a kohlrabi leaf and threw in for the color contrast too.

This is so tasty!  It really hits so many flavors - sweet, sour, fatty & crunchy (not a flavor, but still). I made it once and couldn't wait to make it again.  For a little something extra, I sprinkled it with toasted sunflower seeds.
