This is a recipe that I have found pretty hard to mess up!  I alternate this recipe with another wheat dinner roll recipe (that needs to be kneaded :), and this one is perfect for those days that you want fresh yeast rolls, but don't have time to let them rise before baking.  When you let them rise in the fridge overnight, just use a lint free, dampened towel that will prevent air from coming in.  These turn out perfectly browned when you watch the oven closely.  They get brown fast so around 8 minutes, be watching for the perfect shade of golden-brown. 
Thanks for a great recipe and a staple at our house!!

Yummy rolls just as the recipe stands.

I made a few substitutions - milk for the water, butter for the shortening and brush them with butter before baking.  They melt in your mouth!

I made these rolls in my Kitchenaid mixer. Mixed with regular beater and then used the dough hook and mixed on low for about 2 minutes. Very tasty.

being put on the spot to come up with a bread product for a family get together, I found this recipe and had it in the fridge ready to go before going to bed.  Tasted great, and everyone loved it!!  Have already been asked for the recipe by the family.

This is the EXACT recipe my mother has used for rolls over many years.  The whole family and new-comers to the extended family rave about them!  She always bakes them in round pie pans and bakes a bundle so she can give away some in large zip lock bags. Fantastic for sopping up gravy!

Definately not the best bread I have ever made,and I have been making bread for years.  I only tried this one since the dough can be refridgerated overnight.  I follwed the recipe to the T even using a brand new container of Fleishmans yeast, and it came out a tad on the dry side, and didn't rise all that well, but it did have a pretty good taste.  I think that rising on the countertop is the only real way to make bread by hand without worry that it is going to dry out, which is what happened to me. I think I will give this recipe 1 more shot, and keep the dough outta the fridge.

These turned out really great! I made the dough Saturday night and it was quick and easy. Then I made half the batch on Sunday afternoon, put the rest of the dough back in the fridge.  Monday night we had fresh hot rolls with the remaining half of dough.  They tasted great!  I made mine into knots by rolling into 8 in. strips and tying into a loose knot.  They turned out soft and yummy!

This is the first bread recipe I tried with success!  I used it on Thanksgiving and again a week later.  My daughter loved helping assemble the ingredients and punching the dough down and I swear my husband burned his fingers because he couldn't wait until they cooled to eat them.  Will use again and again and again

These turned out pretty well.  The 6.5 cups flour turned out to be too much for my dough.  I should have stopped at 5.5 cups.  It might have been due to the water not being warm enough for the yeast proofing.  I didn't realize these would not brown much on top and so the bottoms got a bit darker than I wanted.  They were still nice rolls.  Will try again.  Thanks for sharing, Debbie!

These are the best of several refrigerator rolls recipes I have tried. I did convert the recipe to metric, as I think it helps to be more precise in measurements. I also placed a cake pan with a cup of water in it on the lower shelf of oven while baking to add moisture. I used an egg wash with various toppings, including rosemary, poppy seed, and sea salt. They were all good!

I made these rolls this year for Thanksgiving, and boy am I GLAD I did! The first batch I made, I cut in half made on a Tuesday and baked on Saturday. Everyday about 2-5 times during the day I would punch down, turn over in the bowl, and cover with a damp towel. THEY TURNED OUT AWESOME! I must also note I mixed in my Kitchen Aide mixer for about two minutes after adding all the dough. I took the dough out about an hour before baking. After 30-45 minutes of coming to room temperature, I divided and put into a muffin pan. Baked and I have never tasted a better dinner roll. These are so easy! Thank you so much for submitting this recipe!

Well, my dough is mixed and resting in the frige right now, so I don't know what they'll taste like, but I used my Kitchenaid mixer with the paddle first and dough hook second and even though I used all 6 1/2 cups of flour, my dough was soooo sticky!  No one else has mentioned sticky dough, so maybe it's just me?  Plus, I am a little confused as to where to let the rolls rise after being in the fridge overnight: in the fridge, or on the countertop?  I'm going to bet on the countertop, so I'll let everyone know. I'm also used to placing dough in a greased bowl, and there was no mention of that in this recipe, but I did it anyway. Three stars so far for the confusion.*****update: I changed my review to 2 stars because the rising rolls stuck to the non-linty towels that I used to cover them, and when all was said and done, I had bread shaped like rounds of dough.  My dough was still sticky when pinching off pieces to place on the cookie sheets for the final rise, and these didn't melt in your mouth or were fluffy----it was bread in texture and taste.  I guess that's ok if you wanted to make homemade bread without kneading it.....but I won't be making this recipe again. Not impressed at all.

I have made these MANY times and always wonderful results. Sometimes I add some whole wheat. I mix and store them following the directions from Artisan Bread in Five. One time I baked them in a muffin tin and served them split open with strawberries and cream. They were wonderful, just sweet enough and light enough. Perfect for breakfast. This is truly five star recipe in my home. (ABin5 has you mix everything together in a big container and wait 2hrs. Then refrigerate. Break off a chunk as needed and bring to room temperature. You can bake immediately for a more dense loaf, or wait for the bread to rise again for a lighter loaf. Muffin tins make nice shaped rolls of consistent size. All you have to do is scoop a spoonful into the muffin tin.)
* 2 1/2 years later and still a staple in our house. Yummy.

I have been using this as base recipe for some time now, it comes out perfect every time! I have had some difficulty getting it rise at high altitude since I moved to Denver, but that just means extra time and the perfect rising temp. Also, the most popular version in my house is to double (or more) the amount of sugar for a sweeter dinner roll (like the ones at Texas Road House). Amazing!!!!

This recipe was easy to make, even for someone who typically makes bread in the bread machine.  I made the dough and put in the fridge overnight, only punching down once after about 4 hours.  In the morning, I took it out 2 hours before baking, punched it down and shaped it into balls, brushed melted butter on tops, covered with a sheet of plastic wrap and a towel, and let rise for 2 hours.  They puffed up beautifully.  They baked very nicely and were pretty light.  My guests devoured them.  The reason they didn't receive 5 stars is that the taste was maybe just a tad bland.  Next time I'll add a little more salt, or use butter-flavored Crisco.

Wow! I can't believe I actually made a yeast roll from scratch! I am really impressed with this recipe. Very, very simple. A heavier type yeast roll, I think would taste great with a soup or stew. Wonderful recipe. Would love to make these again.

Very good, at least as good as if not better than the store-bought frozen yeast roll dough we usually buy, and easy enough that we won't be buying frozen any more.

This recipe was awesome. Made them for Thanksgiving, everyone loved them. I liked the idea that you can make the dough the night before. I have passed this on to other family memebers.

I cut the water back to a cup and a half and only needed six cups of flour. I also used melted butter instead of shortening. I was able to proof the yeast with the warm water in my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl, then throw in the other ingredients. I used my dough hook attachment to mix which made going from mix to knead very simple. Out of one recipe, I got eighteen dinner rolls. Baked at 400*, mine were done at 15 minutes but mine were on the bigger side. Very nice roll recipe.

I made minor modications to this recipe based on previous experience with some bread recipes.  I added 1/8 cup of sugar to the warm yeast water during proofing so the yeast would have something to feed on.  It rose in the fridge just like bread does when it's left on the counter albeit a little slower.  Once I rolled the dough into balls, I left it on the counter to rise for ~3 hours.  That's the beauty of yeast breads - you can just leave it and come back to it later.  I like my bread to be a little doughy so I baked at 375F for 10 minutes.  Be sure to brush the tops with butter to get a nice brown crust - I did mine with butter/cinnamon/sugar.  These aren't spectacular as they taste like typical dinner rolls, but they're easier to make than traditional bread recipes.

Used half whole wheat flour. Made burger buns out of it. Pretty good for the amount of work involved.

These were great!  My whole family really enjoyed these!  I followed the recipe exactly then I brushed with butter before baking.

I hadn't made yeast bread for many years before I made these rolls for Christmas.  They were easy to make and very yummy - a hit!

These are quite easy and good. I made a half of recipe , and used butter. I let the dough sit on the counter for a bit before I put it in the fridge in the morning and punched the dough down twice before baking that evening.

Made as written, except substituted butter for shortening, as I don't keep shortening on hand. The top of the dough did dry out in the fridge overnight, but it seemed to reincorporate well enough; I only lightly dampened the towel, and will more thoroughly wet it next time. 

I made the dough into 24 rolls, which I baked in two glass pie plates. I ended up needing to bake them for 20 minutes, rather than the 8-10 in the recipe, and even then they were a bit doughy in the center. The taste wasn't quite spot-on for me, either, but definitely worth trying again in the future.

Substituted melted butter for shortening and melted added butter to brush on rolls before rising( we are butter lovers). This is So close to my dear mother’s refrig rolls but a-tad easier. Family loved them. I used stand mixer to be easier on my arthritis with dough hook to finish. 
I’ll try scalding milk to replace water next time around for fun to experiment like my mother’s recipe but these turned out great as is with just water.   
My grandkids were stealing them from the basket before other food was served. 
Definitely give rolls the full 2 hours or more to rise before baking if you had in refrig overnight like I did. Don’t be afraid if they dont rise like others before baking. THey will finish rising in oven. 
Family says this is new favorite. IT made 30 3 lobe cloverleaf rolls. 12 people and all gone.

I followed the recipe except I used butter instead of shortening and formed the rolls before I put them in the refrigerator for the night. My kids scarfed them down! I've also made them for dinner without refrigerating them at all and they were great!

These rolls tasted great,  but they didn't look good in appearance.  I followed the recipe, but they didn't rise at all in the fridge. When I made them into rolls to rise,  they rose some. I will probably try this recipe again and make some adjustments.

I've been making these rolls for fifty years, with the only failures attributable to MY mistakes (inactive yeast, too-warm water).  Four generations of my family love them as dinner rolls or as cinnamon rolls.  I now mix them in my Kitchen Aid heavy-duty mixer; that makes them even easier.  The rolls brown beautifully in dark metal pans, but glass pans don't allow the bottoms to brown well.  In the unlikely event that there are leftovers, they go home with daughter or grandsons for breakfast the next morning.  I've never found a better, easier recipe.

These rolls had a great flavor, but I found them to be denser than I would have liked. I think I will let them mix longer next time. I made these for Christmas lunch at my aunts house. It was nice to make them that morning and then put them in the fridge until it was time to let them rise. They didn't brown on their own, so I put melted butter on top and put them under the broiler for a couple of minutes til they got brown.

Right behind the oven breaking on a holiday is going to the refrigerator to get out your yeast roll dough and finding it didn't rise! I have made rolls dozens of times so I was really surprised. Bad yeast? It's Christmas morning and I don't have enough yeast to remake the rolls, so it's a new tradition of corn bread! Merry Christmas!

These were pretty good. I like a sweeter, Hawaiian type roll tough so will definitely increase the sugar next time!

The winner in my 'new recipes for Thanksgiving' - I try to add a couple of new things to go with our traditional foods every year, and these were simply wonderful, and so very easy to make.  As one other reviewer said, I will add a tad more salt next time, or used butter flavored Crisco.  Excellent texture, melt in  your mouth good!  Also going to try making a loaf of this bread this week, thank you for the recipe!
