Okay. I made these cookies a couple days ago and used butter as some reviewers suggested. Although my family and sister-in-law said they were awesome and raved on and on about them, they turned out quite flat. So, I made them again last night and used the shortening as the original recipe says and I must say that even though I prefer to use butter for health reasons (especially my wonderful local organic butter)they turned out much better as far as the look of the cookie goes. Taste was about even with butter, but not near as flat. They were nice and round and perfect just like a cookie should be. So, I don't know if others have a problem with flatness using butter, but I did. In fact they were so flat that I couldn't even hardly get them off the sheet and they fell apart and were quite a mess. The taste made up for it. BUT with the shortening they are perfect the whole way around. These cookies are just delicious and quite easy to make. Do be sure not to overbake. I baked mine for 7 minutes, then let them sit on the sheet for a few minutes. They WILL seem like they are not done, but don't worry they will harden up a bit. They will harden enough to stay together, but remain chewy enough to think you're almost eating a brownie. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

I've been making these for years & they are always a hit (my dad's office had a two-batch-per-week habit when I lived nearby).  

I think shortening is an abomination so I substitute the same amount of butter & omit the water.  Perfect every time.

And for best results mix with a wooden spoon, NOT an electric mixer.  You'll get dense, chewy cookies that'll have the whole neighbourhood talking.

WOW!!! These are so good.  I made them in mini muffin pans, I had a pan of 24 and a pan of 12 and the dough divided perfectly between them making 36 cute little 'bite brownies'. Just be sure you grease the mini cups. I used less chocolate chips, approx 1 cup because thats all I had on hand. Baked 9 minutes, and left to cool until I could pop them out of the pans.... perfect!

This recipe is sooo easy, and the cookies come out softly chewy and chocolatey, just like you would expect.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, and wouldn't change a thing.  If you make each cookie as a teaspoon, the batch makes almost 6 dozen cookies.  They didn't spread out as much as one reviewer suggested.  Instead, mine seemed to rise and get plump and airy.  You do have to watch the cookies carefully to ensure that they are done enough, but not overdone.  Also, do let them cool for several minutes in the pan before transferring.  Otherwise, the bottoms of the cookies are too soft and the chips will drop out or stick to the pan.  I like to line my baking sheets with aluminum foil so that I can let the cookies cool on the foil liner while I re-line the pan with new foil and start the next batch.  Once the next batch is in the oven, I start transferring the cooled cookies from the foil liner onto a wire rack.  This is a gerat recipe, and I will definitely be making it again!

These are OUTSTANDING!  I'm glad I read the reviews first...if using a teflon coated cookie sheet, reduce time by at least 1-1/2 minutes (I did 5-1/2 min.s) as they tended to burn easily.  I triped the recipe & used only 4 cups of choc. chips, which was also plenty.  My family couldn't get enough of them and my co-workers have all asked for the recipe! A hit with me; thank you.

Excellent Cookie Recipe! I needed a quick and easy dessert this evening and this was the perfect choice. I decided to make these in mini muffin cups and top them with a little marshmallow creme and a drizzle of caramel and chocolate sauces. It worked out great! Mini muffins baked approx. 11 min at 375 in my oven and came out rich and just like a little brownie.  Everyone loved them and we will make them again. Thanks for sharing!

I doubled the recipe and spread the batter onto a large baking sheet and just made brownies.  They were excellent!  I'm making them again today.

These cookies were so awesome. I split the batter into 5 different variations: walnuts added, coconut added, chunky peanut butter added, caramel bits added, and original recipe. My husband said the original was a bit too chocolate-y for his taste, but he totally dug the peanut buter variation. I think my favorite is the coconut one. It doesn't taste too coconut-y, just adds a bit more stability to the cookie and a bit more chewiness. The coconut and peanut butter variations will become cookie staples in my dessert repetoire.

These were a big hit with my friends. Since I didn't want to use a ton of cookie sheets for the tsp sized cookies I made three sheets normal and then placed the rest of the dough in heart shaped muffin pan. I actually liked the heart shaped cookies better than the normal.

I adore these cookies! As much as I like to use butter in cookies, there are just some recipes that require shortening. By the sound of the reviews, this is one of those recipes (plus, I like my cookies thicker). With the shortening and brown sugar, the texture is SO much like brownies. Very chewy, with a crinkly top. I used mint and dark chocolate chips (limited edition left over from the holidays) for a nice mint variation. Whenever I want to make double chocolate chip cookies, this is the recipe I will reach for from now on!

Thanks, Jonie Adams - This is a wonderful recipe. It is simple and quick and produces a nice little cookie with the flavor of brownies. I followed the recipe exactly and my cookies came out with a touch of crunch on the outside and a nice chewy interior. And I take it that your indication of "18 servings" meant about 4 cookies per serving, because using rounded teaspoons  as directed, I ended up with 71 cookies! (Much better to have too many cookies than too few!)

These are the ultimate brownie cookie. They are really soft. The first time I made them I used chocolate chips and I always use butter in place of shortening. They came out nice, soft, and chewy. I also melted white chocolate and dipped half of them cookie into that. The second time I left out the chocolate chips and I like them even better this way. They ate smooth and soft.

Taking the advice of another reviewer, I split this recipe in 1/2.  I made one half precisely as directly and it was too chocolatey (this coming from a major chocoholic).  In the other 1/2 I added a big heaping tablespoon of peanut butter and swirled it into the batter.  It was AMAZING!  I will also add that making it as directed renders about 2 1/2 doz cookies when scooped with a small cookie scoop (from Williams Sonoma).  They were lightly crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside.  
** Note:  To the reviewer who's cookie went flat - don't overbeat your dough when incorporating the dry ingredients to the wet.  I added the dry in 3 cup fulls.  When you overbeat the dough it overacts the flour resulting in flat cookies.

I am getting rave reviews from my boys on these.  I subbed almost all but about 2 Tbsp. of the shortening for butter with a fine result.  I used 1 cup bittersweet chocolate chips and 1/2 cup semi-sweet.  Omitted the nuts.  I baked some as directed as cookies but did half in mini muffin tins and they turn out as perfect little brownie bites.  The kids preferred the brownie bites by far over the cookies.

Great Cookie. I use this recipe in the bakery department I work in and they turn out wonderful everytime. I deleted the water the recipe called for and followed the recipe the rest of the way. The cookie is soft and chewy and continued to stay that way as it was displayed for sale in the cafeteria. I can't keep them on the shelves. I sell out within 2 days if that! I make jumbo cookies 4oz size, because my customers like large cookies. For variety, when the cookie is cooled I dip half the cookie in melted white chocolate. The cookie takes on a very fancy beautiful look that makes it hard for my customer to resist. Sometimes, I use white chocolate chips instead of the chocolate ones.

Wow, these cookies are really chocolatey! Nicely chewy and brownielike. I think I would prefer them without the chips (I used milk chocolate and no nuts) because I'd like to enjoy the chewyness and chocolate of the cookie without the texture distraction of the chips. These cookies did not keep well. After two days (stored in a zip top bag) they were dry and crumbling apart.

These cookies (brownie?) are too good to be true! My brother had a sudden craving for something sweet, and it was like I had a lightbulb over my head: why, Kan, this is a good time to make that one recipe you found on allrecipes.com, you know, it said.
	Anyhow, I'm extremely pleased by the results. I baked for exactly seven minutes and cooled for four minutes before my appetite couldn't resist any longer. The insides really were gooey and chewy. I omitted the chocolate chips because I was low on ingredients, but I have no regrets (maybe next time I'll try it though, just for comparison).

Yum! turned out exactly as title says and were not too cake-like. I subbed in softened butter and omitted the water. I also stirred these by hand as some reader suggested. I cooked them @ 370 for 7 minutes in my convention oven. Good ratings all around and thanks for the recipe!!

I made these into mini bite size brownies after reading one of the reviews. It worked perfectly. The first batch I made with the chocolate chips and chopped walnuts and the second batch (which makes 36 mini brownie bites!) I made with just the nuts. Both turned our great!

I made these with butter and omitted the water. They were kind of flat but I like my cookies that way. They were chewy and chocolatey - really good! I added 3/4 tsp. chipotle powder for a kick, and although the smokiness was not what I was looking for (next time I'll use cayenne) the kick was perfect. Overall, these cookies are fantastic!

This is  really good recipe.  I am a chocaholic and prefer rich to sweet so I did 1 cup of semi sweet and 1 cup of dark chocolate chips.  I followed the rest exactly.

These are rightly named! They are chewy and brownie-ish. I used butter and no water, as one reviewer said, and they came out fine. They did spread a bit more than I would have liked, but the taste was very good.

I thought these were amazing! I only had a  little shortening so had to do a blend of butter/shortening and it worked perfectly. My daughter and her friend wiped out a plateful when they came through the door...that's a hit!!

Wow! These were scrumptious! Like others, I used butter instead of shortening. These cookies were chocolatey & chewy. Thank you Jonie!

My husband and I LOVED these scrumptious bites though I must say, the bigger I made them the chewier (and yummier!) they are. Though I don't think they'd be quite as good without the chocolate chips and nuts!

Loved these!  I followed the recipe exactly for the first batch, but used butter instead of shortening.  They came out flatter than I wanted, but were perfect for ice cream sandwiches.  The second time I made these, I still used butter...then omitted the water and used baking powder instead of baking soda... they came out perfect!

Wow!  Mine are still hot!  I bake all of the time, but rarely love what I bake.  I followed the recipe just like it is, but was short of sugar and chips which turned out to be a good thing because they were a bit too sweet for me, but otherwise, FANTASTIC!

My cousin and I made these this weekend. We added in some white chocolate chips along with the semi-sweet chocolate chips that was called for on the recipe. She had read one of the reviews stating that the cookies came out flat, so to avoid this we refridgerated the cookies dough while the oven was preheating. We baked them for 7 minutes since we like our cookies soft and a little doughy. They were heaven! We had some of our family and my boyfriend waiting for them when they came out of the oven. They couldn't wait to gobble them up!

Really good!  Nice soft texture.  I wanted the flavor of a brownie to take to the family get together, but wanted something kid friendly that would stretch further than a 9x13 pan of brownies, so that everyone could have some.  Yep, plenty to go around.  Thanks.

These are great! My friends raved about them. I used rainbow colour vanilla chips instead of the chocolates and no nuts. I really think the nuts would take away from the great texture and flavour. Be very careful not to overbake these ones!

I tried this recipe like other reviewers did and used a mini muffin tin ... they were cute and fluffy when I took them out of the oven, but then sank in the middle. It only happened with some of them; I think it's because I didn't "seat" the dough nicely in the muffin cup; I just plopped it in thinking it would work itself out. I'll try again because hubby really liked these.

These turned out really good.  I normally use butter when I make cookies but I did not do so with this recipe. I followed it exactly and I was so surprised how good it turned out.  It had just the right amount of chocolate flavor and chewy texture just like a brownie.  A keeper!!!

I used butter instead of shortening, and baking powder instead of soda...i also substituted chocolate chips instead of nuts, as well as half a cup of coconut, and a couple tablespoons of chunky peanut butter.  I had to cook them for the full 9 minutes as well.  They turned out great :)

Basically a brownie in cookie form.  These are easy to make and came out wonderfully.  I made these with my large cookie scoop, and my kids will be thrilled to find one of these giant brownie cookies in their lunches tomorrow.

Not bad at all!  It's not quiet what I was looking for but the fudgidy-chocolatey taste is there. It's all about watching it carefully so it won't turn out to be cake-like. Also, it wouldve been helpful if I had a cookie scoop because the batter was hard to drop. Did some minor changes like using butter instead shortening like others mentioned and used half chocolate chips and half chocolate chip toffee bits. Followed the rest.....Also, I was browsing for another brownie cookies and saw the exact same recipe as herseys (just a note for me so I don't duplicate)

3 stars because it is just average.  I wanted a real, true brownie cookie.  This was not really chewy like a brownie and the dough itself was not chocolaty.  The choc. chips did make it chocolaty enough, but I was looking for a cookie that's good enough to stand on its own, without the chips, like a good brownie.

Chewy, rich and delicious. I used 1/2 cup less sugar, butter instead of shortening, and Hershey's special dark pieces instead of chocolate chips. They turned pretty well, since I prefer rich to sweet. Had to adjust temp though, because some of them burned on the outside. Will bake again.

This recipe is divine!  I had a chocolate craving that needed fixed fast, and these cookies were so simple to make and are so delicious!  I have learned that shortening is the best way to go with cookies; butter makes them too flat and they burn quicker.  I will be making these cookies again, as the holidays are approaching and I love baking!

Made exactly as written but omitted the nuts, many family members cannot have nuts. I doubled the recipe and used my Pampered Chef 1 tsp. scoop and it made 95 cookies. If you are a chocoholic you will love these. Parchment paper on the cookie sheets makes it so easy. Be careful NOT TO OVERBAKE, they don't look done when you take them out but that 2 minutes of cooling before removing to cooling racks lets them set up. Will definitely make these again. Great recipe

These cookies are pure EVIL!  We just can't keep our hands off of them.  Hubby let the 1yr old try and next thing I knew he was trying climbing to get them off the counter.
I made three batches for a cookie swap and found it really easy and helpful to put the batter in a ziplock bag and cut a hole and "pipe" them onto the cookies sheets.  
Thanks for the great recipe!

These are simple, yet amazing! I added a little less chipits and more nuts. You can always experiment with different types of chipits and nuts, but either way they are delicious. You must know your oven though! The first time I overbaked them and they were hard, but the second time I took them out right at 7 mins and they were perfect. After about 20 mins i placed them in containers and they are nice and chewy the next day.

Fabulous! I've been looking for a brownie cookie recipe and I've finally found a great one!
I used butter, as per others suggestion and doubled the recipe, since I knew they'd go fast.  I used 3 cups of semi-sweet chips and 1 cup of milk chocolate chips.  I think next time I'll use milk, semi-sweet and white chocolate, perhaps even go wild with nuts, marshmallows and caramel chips! What a fabulous base dough.  The cookies didn't spread that much for me, I was able to fit 12 to a pan like I do with normal cookies.  The cookies were still soft and scrumptious the next day after sitting out all night :)  Thanks for the fabulous recipe!

These cookies were pretty good!  I only used 1 cup of chocolate chips and left out the nuts (personal preference).  Fiancé thought they needed caramel chips, but I was pretty pleased.  Thank you!

These cookies were HEAVENLY!!! I was craving chewy browinies and my boyfriend was craving chocolate chip cookies. These really hit the spot for both of us. We only had 1/2 cup of butter so we substituted unsweetened applesauce for the rest. We also only had 1.5 cup of choc chips but the cookies were perfect. Next time we might add abit more nuts to add more crunch but it's just personal preference. We were afraid the cookies weren't done when we took them out at 7mins but after cooling them for 2-3mins, they were exactly as the other reviewers had described them - slightly crispy on the outside and oh so moist & chewy on the inside. Thank you so much for a wonderful recipe!

My daughter really liked these.  I followed the recipe but next time will try it with the carmel chips.  Thanks for a sweet treat.

Wow! These are so amazing! I was craving something chewy and chocolatey, and this satisfied that craving in a snap. I love the contrast of the crisp outside with the chewy inside.

Variations I made: I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 tsp peppermint extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract in place of the two tablespoons vanilla. Then, I used a bag of mini chocolate chips instead of regular chocolate chips.

I am a huge brownie lover and I thought these would not turn out as I like them.  I was wrong. These cookies were awesome.  Just a tip if you like your brownies gooey cook them for the 7 minutes, but if you like them more as a cake brownie leave them in a little longer.  Big hit with my family!

This are wonderful! Be warned - the batter is not firm like the typical drop cookie dough. I was tempted to add more flour and I am glad I didn't they turn out just fine. They are crisp on the outside, and chewy on the inside. I omitted nuts and used white chocolate swirl chips instead. Be sure to save an extra half cup of chips to arrange on top of the cookie before you cook  - otherwide no one will see the swirls.

These are very, very good. I love chewy, mostly flat cookies but I am forever finding recipes that claim to be "chewy" but actually yield soft or rounded cookies. These are dense, satisfyingly chewy and flat with a nicely crackled/wrinkled top. The chocolate flavor is just right. I like them best completely cooled for the chewiest texture.

Very good, even with substitutions! I used all applesauce for the shortening, a little less brown sugar, ground flax seed instead of eggs, 1/2 cup of cocoa and no nuts. I made them in mini muffins tins- they baked in 10 minutes at 350 degrees. Nice and chocolatey, soft inside and a little crispy outside. Perfect!

I used mint chocolate chips and the flavors were amazing. However, I was disappointed that almost every cookie stuck to the pan. Most of the cookies got damaged as I tried to scrape them off with a spatula.

These were awesome!  The only change that I made was less chocolate chips (1 bag) and I used milk chocolate chips.  Yum!

edit - I should add that I tripled the recipe. :)

These are really good, but don't be fooled by the batter - it tastes kind of chalky and not very good, but once they are cooked they are yummy.  I did both cookie form and mini cupcakes and I like the cupcakes better.  Also, I used dairy free dark chocolate chips to make these a yummy dairy free dessert.

The flavor of these cookies is great. I made the mistake of reading some reviews that raved of making them in mini muffin form, so i opted to do that, in order to save time. Big mistake! The top of the muffins that spilled over and formed the muffin top came off of some of the mini muffins and taste GREAT: just like a brownie cookie, crispy on the outside and very rich and moist on the inside. Sadly, the muffin part that was still in the pan was not even cooked all the way through and I cooked them at least 12 minutes. Very disappointing. Wish I had just made the cookies.

These were good.  I made as directed and filled mini muffin tins with a tablespoon of batter.  I baked at 375 for 9 minutes.  I think 8 minutes would be ok, as the tops were a bit too brown for my liking.  Be sure to grease the tin really well.

Great recipe. I omitted the nuts and used 62% chocolate chips. Because of the extreme dark chocolate chips, the cookies turned out not very sweet. They were wonderfully chewy and gooey and very moist. I really reccomend this recipe!

These cookies are pretty good.  Just what I was looking for - a brownie and a cookie in one.  Not too chocolatey but just right.  Split the batter and made some with walnuts and some without to please hubby who liked them as well!

Love these. I have made multiple variations with a bunch of different things in them, and every time they have turned out amazing! I reduced the flour a bit, took out the water, and upped the sugar to give a bit of a flatter cookie without being TOO flat, and candied the walnuts for extra crunch. YUM. YUM. YUM. Overall a GREAT recipe!

I have also done a few versions without the nuts, and added cinnamon. I call them chocolate spice cookies, GREAT for the holidays!

Definitely a keeper. Lovely moist chewy cookies that were easy to make and taste sweet, chocalatey and delicious. I made more than the 18 cookies stated on the recipe and was worried they will become dry as other reviewers have found, but my left over cookies kept well though they are only two days old. Thank you so much for the great recipe!    P.S. Used butter instead of shortening, dried cranberries instead of nuts (which tasted great) and a mixture of dark and white chocolate.

These are awesome cookies. I used milk chocolate chips in these and omitted the nuts because my family do not like them. Next time I will try this recipe with mint chips. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is a great recipe. I have made it a couple of times and I like to use less chocolate chip and add a little sweetened condensed milk before adding the dry mix.  Also, I found if you sift the dry into the wet, they come out perfect.

I doubled this recipe, used half butter/half shortening, double strength coffee instead of plain water, organic eggs and I used dark chocolate chips. To say that my boys liked them would be an understatement. My husband said that these were the best cookies he'd had in a while. These would be a great "sandwich" part for ice cream sandwiches.

I made these cookies about a year ago for a bake sale... they came out very flat, and the flavour wasn't great - kinda flat also. I used the butter as suggested by other users, maybe that's where it went wrong.

I think these are a chocoholics dream cookie. I used Hershey's Special Dark Cocoa, Ghirardelli Chocolate Chips and omitted the nuts.  I cooked four batches 7 & 9 minutes.  I preferred them at 9 min...family liked both :)

Yum!  I followed the recipe as is except I omitted the nuts and replaced 1/2 c chocolate chips with white chocoloate chips.  A nice alternative to regular chocolate chip cookies.

Quick and easy to make, I used shortening as suggested, consistancy was great.  Only problem, is I would definately suggest using less chocolate chips, maybe 1.25 cups.

AMAZING!!!  My kids were disappointed that I didn't double the recipe like I do sometimes when baking cookies.  I did replace the shortening with butter and chilled the dough REALLY WELL and they did not spread at all.  Definately will be making these often!

Yum!!I used butter instead of shortening and skipped the water. I used 3/4 c mint choc.chips and 1 c milk choc.chips. The mint was not overwhelming the cookies, really good. Easy to make, my 2 1/2 yr.old helped. Has become a new favorite.

Holy moley -- Hang on to your seat!  These are very chocolatey!  Made them for my father-in-law, but my husband taste-tested them tonight.  He loves chocolate--the more chocolate the better--and he asked me to get them out of the house before he eats them all!  Made exactly as the recipe said.  The only thing I did differently is I let them set up on the cookie sheets for probably more like 5-6 minutes before removing.  They were too soft and fell apart when you try to remove them after 2 minutes, as the recipe says.

Great chocolaty cookie!!  For a melon ball sized scoop I did have to bake for 9/10 minutes.  I also sub. unsalted butter for the shortning and deleted the water.  I will keep this recipe for a simple chocolate cookie.  Thank you

Anyone who remotely likes chocolate MUST try these!  They are to die for!  The only thing I changed was using margarine instead of shortening (that's all I had) and they turned out wonderfully!

These are the best cookies we have ever had!  I omitted the nuts since my kids and husband really don't like them, but the cookies were still out of this world.  They are so easy to make and the baking time is short, so that's a plus.  I will make these over and over again!

Great tasting brownie/cookie. It was very chocolate-y but was lacking on the sweet side? Next time I think I'll use 1 cup brown sugar and 1/2 cup white sugar to sweeten it up a bit. Otherwise, be sure only to bake for 7.5-8 minutes!

YUMMY! Very easy and extremely good. I cooked them for 7-1/2 minutes, turned out great. If you don't like chocolate, I'd stay away from these. If, as we do, you love chocolate, ENJOY!! Update: These are still yummy chewy the next day!!! Fantastic cookies!

These cookies are great, but didn't go as fast as our other  cookie recipes. I did mine for 7 min. on a baking stone, letting sit for 2 min. before cooling on a wire rack, and they turned out just like brownies.  I used dark chocolate chips, so maybe to lighten up the richness I will use milk chocolate next time.

OMG these are amazing! I'm making them for my family's Christmas party this weekend, and I baked six tonight and my boyfriend and I loved them! I just dark chocolate baking powder and mint chocolate chips and they are phenomenal. I didn't use nuts either, because of food allergies in the family. I'm excited to pass these around!! :o)

Very good cookies! 

I have found that with many cookies after they are taken out of the oven they tend to--well, smoosh down, collapse. 

NOT with these babies!! They came out of the oven beautifully and they cooled beautifully! They were a hit at my house!

I left out the nuts- we don't like them in cookies.  I made half into cookies and the other half in a mini muffin pan.  The mini muffins turned out great. I topped them with rich chocolate frosting from this site.  They were very rich but very delicious.  The cookies on their own also had great flavor but didn't stand a chance next to the frosting topped 'brownie muffins'.  The muffins were kind of hard to get out of the pan (sprayed generously with Pam).  I think if you let them cool for at least 25 minutes or so they would be easier to get out.  Will make again and try some of the muffin ones with marsh cream and a drizzle of fudge and caramel as another reviewer suggested.

Delicious and very easy to make.  My 12y/o made them with only a little coaching from me. She did need help stirring once most of the chips were added.  We followed the recipe except we substituted white chocolate chips for the nuts and cut back on the chocolate chips to 1 1/2 cups.

excellent cookie.  used butter flavored shortening which didn't alter the recipe just enhanced the flavor a bit but followed recipe exactly.  chewy and rich and tastes exactly like a homemade brownie.

The hit of the party!!! Great recipe!
I substituted the shortening for butter, omitted the water as suggested before.  They were a little flat because I let the butter get too soft, but they were still amazing.

Woooow! The most amazing cookies EVER! I loooove brownies and the fact that these are brownie cookies= heaven!!! I baked the cookies exactly how the recipe states and they came out perfect. The were crunchy on the outside and so soft on the inside. It tasted just like what a brownie cookie should taste like! I usually share my baked goods with friends and family but these certainly stayed home, they were THAT delicious!!

These are Awesome!  I followed the directions exactly with the exception of adding nuts, as was my preference. I instead added about a 1/2 cup of mint chocolate chips into the mix.  I've made 2 batches of these, they don't last long!  Thank you for a great recipe!

Good recipe, just too many chocolate chips. I would like to be able to taste some cookie and not just the chocolate chips. I will make again, very good, but will use only 1 1/2 cups of choco chips or less

Realized I had not chocolate chips- I used a bag of Skor pieces by adding 1 cup to the mixture and the balance on the brownie bites when they came out of the oven, followed by a drizzle of white chocolate once cooled. Hmmmmmmmm

I made these tonight and they turned out fantastically! I typed in 24 to the converstion setting but I used 2 eggs, and im out of shortening so i used butter and like others they turned out a little flat but still yummy, chewy, and brownie like. I also did 1TB creme 1Tbs water 1Tbs vegtable oil because the batter turned out kinda thick. I mixed in 1/2c drk choco chips 1/2c butterscotch and 1c coconut. :) GREAT recipe, use shortening for sure! (I might give a 5 if they hadnt been so flat, could be my fault though)

These are good cookies but not chocolately enough for me!  I think next time I'll actually add a little more cocoa and chunks of semi-sweet chocolate rather then the chips.  They cooked better in my mini muffin pan then they did on my stone bar pan.

These are really nice cookies. They are really nice and chocolately. I added a bit more cocoa powder and butter for extra chocolate. The kids made ice cream sanwiches with vanilla ice cream, out of the cookies and loved them.

Followed the recipe exactly and they turned out horribly. The finished cookies were soo runny, they couldn't easily be picked up off the cookie sheet, and fell through the cracks on the cooling rack getting stuck to the counter. Ended up with a sticky chocolatey mess that is only useful to put on ice cream.

Very Good cookies. The dough is tricky as it is very runny/sticky. I also worried that they were under baked and had to cook them a few minutes longer. Next time I will also cut down on the sugar as I am not a fan of very sweet cookies. These will taste better if you use good quality chocolate chips. Definitely a keeper. Very moist, chewy cookies. Yum!

I baked these cookies according to the recipe. I only omitted the nuts. It didn't taste as good as i expected. I believe the Crisco shortening altered the flavor. But then i checked out chewy brownie cookies on many websites and they all recommend using shortening! I miss the taste of butter in these cookies. So 3.5 stars from me.

Following other recommendations, I used butter and omitted the water. I thought they were great out of the oven but they didn't hold up to their "chewy brownie" consistency and broke easily after 1 day of storage in a zip lock.

These are pretty good. Better when cool. I thought it could use a bit more chocolate taste, though. I used shortening, followed recipe. We didn't finish them - picky kids.

I was suddenly bitten by a sweet tooth about a half hour before my little ones went to bed so I searched for something quick and chocolately and found this.  They came together very quickly but they came out so darn flat I thought I made a mistake when writing down the recipe.  As I was mixing and measuring, I thought 1/4 tsp of leavener was not nearly enough.  So, when I sat down to look at the recipe again I realized I had done it right but now I can't figure out how others who made this got cookies that didn't spread out and get completely flat.  They tasted delicious but I don't generally care for flat cookies.  Bummer.

Not one of my favorite cookies.  I brought it to a party and had mixed reviews.  Some people loved the cookie to death while others were not thrilled by it at all.  Made the cookies with the optional chocolate chips.

This recipe is a huge hit with everyone I know. The only thing I do different is when the cookies come out of the oven, I add half a piece of Ande's Mints to the top, allow them to melt, swirl with a tooth pick, put in the fridge to cool. They're amazing!

I just loved the chocolate overload that I got from these cookies.  Very good for people with a sweet-tooth like me!  Just be careful not to overcook- they don't look like they are completely cooked through, but after they cool, they will set well.

I made these and took them to work. They were a big hit with all my coworkers. I work nights and something like this is just the pick-me-up I need! My coworker said "If I wasn't married with a kid on the way, I would ask you to marry me."

Well, I should start by saying that I am a completely hopeless cook when it comes to sweets and cakes.  However, I tackle them because my kids love to make them - but never like to eat them.  So we cook for fun, rather than consumption ;-)  Anyway, my 5 year old and I just made these.  First! The batter is a hit straight off the spoon. But when I cooked them, I found that they went flat as a pancake REAL fast - but on review I realised, (reading other reviews) that you shouldn't add the water if you use butter.  So, that accounted for that in my opinion: I added a little more flour and soda to sort out that problem and it seemed to improve the problem.  However, they still look wrong - like little cake cookies, not crunchy on the outside cookies.  However, they taste SUPERB!! 5 yr old has consumed 3 very quickly!! I am in the process of making coffee to have with mine.  I will make them again, because I am sure the problem was something I did, and I am going to get these right, because when I do I know they will be the best cookies I have ever had!

I made this as a brownie bar instead of cookies. 

Tastes delicious, but if you do it this way, I would turn the oven down to 350 so you can bake it all the way through without over-cooking the surface area.

OMG!!  These are fabulous!!  I will surely make them again.  I wouldn't have to change anything but, I might try substituting some peanutbutter chips or chocolate mint chips for variety.  I also might try sprinkling some granulated sugar on the cookies while they are still on the cookie sheet, just for a littl decoration.  Thanks so much forthe recipe!

These didn't taste like the gooey chewy brownie that I hoped for.  It was just a chocolately chocolate chocolate cookie.  It was okay.

Yummy cookies!  Didn't change a thing except baked them for 11 - 12 minutes AND cooled them on the sheet for about 5 minutes BEFORE transferring them to a cookie rack.  When baked at the recommended 7 - 9 minutes, the cookies were half-baked and fell apart.

These were absolutely fabulous! I made them for my husband's work & everyone went crazy for them. I did change some things though. I did not add nuts (you never know who's allergic) & instead of semi-sweet chips I added white chocolate chips to the mix with a few on top for decoration. I also refrigerated the dough for about 2 hours & they shaped beautifully. Seriously, like something I would have bought in a bakery. Definitely recommended!

I think these cookies are AMAZING!!! Every person I make them for LOVE them. I usually add more pecans than chocolate chips, because it already has cocoa in it, but if you love chocolate, but that's just my personal preference. I definitely recommend these cookies to everyone!! They ROCK.

This definitely tasted just like a brownie out of the oven.  I personally do not like brownies, but did enjoy the cookies.  The extra chocolate chips in the batter were almost an overkill for the non-brownie lovers like me, they would've been just fine without them.

These were delicious, used butter as suggested.   One thing - I made the cookies standard size and I made 33 of them, almost double than 18 the recipe was calling for.  However, that didn't matter as they were gone very quickly anyway :)

Excellent!  I used peanut butter chips rather than chocolate and these were great!  Perfectly chewy on the inside, slightly crunchy on the edges.  This will be added to my permanent collection!

I have made these several times now.  Everybody LOVES them.  I make them into brownie ice cream sandwiches.  I make them exactly as the recipe states.
We are having brownie ice cream sandwiches at the office tomorrow for a Friday treat and I'm making them again for a girls night out pool party on Saturday.

Thank you for the great recipe!

These cookies were not only delicious but super quick and easy to make.  I only had milk-chocolate chips so I reduced the sugar to 1 cup and they were definitely sweet enough.  I made about half the batch in a mini-muffin tin like another reviewer suggested and baked for 9 min and they were perfect.  I then added about 1/4 cup of peanut butter and 1/4 cup of coconut to the remaining batter and made those into cookies.  My only issue was that my cookies hardly flattened at all!  They were very yummy though, they just looked a bit strange. Maybe it was because I added the other ingredients and omitted some of the sugar?  Any suggestions

AWESOME! I did make a semi-large change; I made them in mini-muffin pans with liners. I got 52 little bite-sized brownies (baked 9 mins). I also omitted the nuts and used butter, as personal preferences. DELICIOUS! Wouldn't change a thing! I topped mine with some cream cheese frosting.

I used this recipe to make tuxedo brownie cups with a white chocolate cream cheese filling.  Filled greased mini-muffin cups 2/3 full with batter and baked for 10 minutes.  Press the center down immediately after taking out of the oven.  Cool for a few minutes and they pop out perfectly (which never seems to happen with the boxed brownie mixes). Delish!

I omitted the nuts but otherwise I followed this recipe exactly.  The taste of the cookies was all right but I couldn't cook them right.  They stuck to the pan and the outsides cooked way more than the insides.  I adjusted time and temperature and even greased the pan but nothing worked.  I ended up just saving the dough to snack on later (my guilty pleasure) and promised myself not to use this recipe again.

Ok, so I made these cookies today, and they were just ok.  I gave it a 4, even though I wanted to give it a 3, because some of it may be my fault.  The cookies were chewy, so that's a good thing.  I used butter instead of shortening, and I didn't add in chocolate chips because I didn't have any.  But there just wasn't any depth of flavor there.  They were way too sweet, and just weren't chocolatey enough (the actual cookie).  It could have been because I didn't use a premium cocoa (I used Hershey's).  I don't know....maybe I'll try it again with a better cocoa and some chocolate chips.

These are good, but they will only be as good as your chocolate. As someone suggested I used butter, and omitted the water. The only cocoa I had on hand was a cheap brand. While the cookies were OK, they would have been so much better with premium baking cocoa!

The cookies were okay.  Both my husband and I thought they were way too chocolaty.  I might try them again with white chocolate chips instead of the semisweet.

these are awesome! I doubled the recipe and used milk, white and mint chips, I had bits of each left to use up. I used 1/2 tsp each of baking soda and baking powder, we like puffy not flat cookies. I had to bake for 14 minutes but I used silpat and insulated pans. I used 1/8 cup measure and got 60 good sized cookies.
03/24 used this cookie for whoopie pies, omitted chocolate chips and nuts just used base, they were awesome, used a 1tbsp scoop and got 48 cookies, yummy!

My 7 year old daughter requested that I make her a recipe for Brownie Cookies for her class.  She told me that some kids have allergies to nuts, so I did omit the nuts for the occasion.  These cookies came out chewing and delicious.  I ate about 4 straight off the cooling rack.  She hasn't taken them to school yet, but I am going to Include the recipe because this recipe needs to be passed around.  Great Cookies.  Next time I will add nuts.

Delicious! I used 1/3 cup of shortening, 1/3 cup of butter and 1 tsp. of water to get a puffy, buttery-tasting cookie.  I baked them for 7 min on convection and they came out perfect!

The cookies were good.  But they came out cakey rather than chewy like a brownie so I was a bit disappointed.  The only thing I did differently from the original recipe is follow some advice from the reviews.  I used butter instead of shortening and omitted the water.  Can someone more seasoned than I explain what I did wrong?  How can I achieve the chewy cookie result that I wanted?

I loved it! Recommend extra care at the time of baking , if you keep them too long in the oven they turn out hard... but if you take them out at the right time they are the most yummmmy cookies you can imagine. My husband is  not a cookies fan but he loved these ones! Great recipe!

Definitely my favorite cookie recipe thus far!  Extremely adorable 1" diameter, bite-sized cookies which still retain their crispy exterior and chewy middle.  They look almost like chocolates if you present and box them well.  Recipe was simple and quick--I followed it exactly and my cookies were perfect!

I am a cookie fanatic and LOVED this recipe!  I have filed this in one of the best recipes I have.  I did find it too sweet, so next time I will cut back the brown sugar to 1 cup and see how that works.  I used lots of walnuts and milk chocolate, ½ oil and ½ real butter and YUM!  I added ¼ teaspoon of instant coffee and they are so rich they didn’t need the coffee but it was good!  LOVED this recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

It comes out too sweet for me although I've reduced to 1 cup of brown sugar as some viewer suggested.  Anyway, my daughters loved it and its the closiest recipe to Mrs Fields cookies.  I'll try this with less sugar next time.

I used less sugar--1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups, and they were still chewy and sweet.  Texture was great, but I did have to bake them longer than 7-9 minutes, more like 10 minutes.

OMG! these cookies were delicious! I also added some caramel bits. They were chewy and oh so good! My boyfriend is the one who usually bakes!!! I felt like I was an awful baker when it came to cookies and cakes pastries etc... but I was determined to change that. I got myself online and found this recipe and it came out delicious and I am proud of myself. I can too bake yay! My boyfriend ate them up! I was a happy woman hehe. Thanks!   -erica

Awesome.  We added caramel bits to ours and when you also do the choc.chips and nuts you end up with "turtle" type brownies.  YUM  (I used 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter and omitted the water, and they were perfect in texture)

I thought these cookies were absolutely fabulous!! I made them without the water, and with olive oil margerine after reading some of the previous reviews and they turned out perfect. I also used two cups of chopped walnuts instead of the chocolate chips and they were just positively awesome!

I used butter instead of shortening and omitted the water.  I have received SO many compliments on these cookies.  At least a dozen people have told me they are the best cookies they have ever had and asked to be in my cookie rotation.  Every few months I bake for 2 whole days and take what I bake to friends and family.  These were a hit!

These were a HUGE success at a recent church cookie exchange. I highly recommend them. I followed the recipe exactly. One problem I encountered (I learned the hard way), a serving of these cookies is 2 cookies. I calculated for 36 servings since I needed 3 dozen. I ended up with 6 dozen cookies. I wasn't hard to get rid of all the extras, though. They went like hotcakes. Awesome cookie recipe!

Pretty good, very easy to make, the only thing I might change about it is do half brown sugar and half white sugar. Very much a brownie texture however which is amazing, definitely a keeper.

I guess I am in the minority here but i didn't think these were all that great.  They were ok, but not all that great.  I followed the recipe exactly and thought they had a funny after taste.  I much prefer the chocolate truffle cookie recipe from this site if I am looking for a chocolate fix.

Loved them!  We are at high altitude and I was nervous about what adjustments might be needed, but they were great as is!  I did use softened (almost melted) butter instead of shortning and then just a few drops of water.  They were chewy in the middle, just right on the outside.  My husband is a picky brownie eater and he LOVED these, told me to make these from here on!  A winner!

I would give these three stars, but I left out the chocolate chips, so that wouldn't be fair.  These weren't sweet enough without the chocolate chips, so if you aren't going to add the chips, add aprx. 1/4- 1/2 cup white sugar (along with the 1 1/2 cup brown sugar) to add more sweetness.

Very good. I used butter because I don't have shortening. I thought the semi-sweet chips made it a little tart, so next time I will try milk choco. Thanks!

I was serving as a juror for 3 weeks and took these cookies into the jury room. They were gone before 10 AM. That night, we were sequestered and everyone was asking me why I didn't make more!  One guy even owned a restaurant and said that he would love to use the cookies as a base for a new dessert he was going to make.

These are very good.

Made these again the other night. I took them to work for my co-workers and THEY DEVOURED them. They are really easy to make and so yummy. I plan on buying chocolate chips and shortening in bulk to make these cookies to send to the troops deployed overseas. I just have to wait for the weather to cool down a little bit so I can send chocolate.

Thanks for a delicious cookie!

These were good, but not amazing.  I have been making cookies since I was 5, so at this point, I am looking for amazing recipies.  Nothing was wrong with this recipe, I just want something that knocks your socks off! :)

This brownie cookie is outstanding!  I altered the recipe by using 1/3 cup of butter and 1/3 cup of butter flavored shortening with the remainder of the recipe remaining the same.  The cookies came out GREAT!!!  These will definitely become a favorite in my home!  THANK YOU Allrecipes!

MMM I think that these are my FAV cookies ever! I used butter and only half the chocolate chips and they were still absolutely incredible. I used walnuts & hazelnuts... I really recommend using hazelnuts - they taste really good in there. I can't stop eating them! You NEED to make these!!!

I cut the chocolate chips in 1/2.  All of the chips made them way too sweet for us.  Other than that great recipe

I didn't have any shortening and followed another reviewer's recommendation to use butter.  These were great and butter is better for you than shortening.  Don't overcook.

These went over really well!  I doubled the recipes to make twice the amount of cookies, but when I used a teaspoon to make the cookies (as advised in the recipe) I had wayyy to much dough.  So I would recommend making the cookies larger.

Also, make sure you let them cool for a while (definitely longer than 2 minutes), especially if you choose to bake them for the recommended 7-9 minutes.  I baked them for 8 minutes and they were very gooey and delicious.
