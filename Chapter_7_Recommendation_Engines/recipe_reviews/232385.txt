I have made this recipe twice since getting it.  The first time, I forgot the baking powder, and they were like hockey pucks, but the taste was wonderful!  The next time, I added cocoa powder for a chocolate peanut butter muffin---super!!!  I used spelt flour as the only flour when making just the peanut butter muffins, and a combination of spelt and rice flours for the other ones.  Both times, I used only  1/4 cup honey in place of the brown sugar.  These were gobbled up right away both times!  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW. These are soooooo good. If you follow the recipe exactly, you'll end up with a dessert. I used only 2/3 cup of sugar, and added a bit more peanut butter. Also, don't worry about the lumps of peanut butter, sugar and flour in your batter. These muffins are just delicious!!!

I used less sugar - half cup and only 2 tsp of baking powder. 1tbsp seemed a tad too much and I didnt want to have a strong baking powder taste. Good, light muffins, but a kind of bland. I would want a stronger peanut butter taste. Next time I will probably double the amount of peanut butter.

These were very easy to put together and were quite good.  I reduced the brown sugar slightly because I added 1/4 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips and a 1/4 cup peanut butter chips.  This was a nice addition to the assorted muffin basket.  Thank you for sharing.

These were a hit at home and the office. I made a few changes though, based on my experience.
I halved the baking powder (1 tablespoon is way too much), doubled the peanut butter, added 1/3 cup chocolate chips, and used 1/4 brown sugar and 1/2 cup honey. 
They came out moist and delicious!

I liked this recipe, just for the simplicity alone. It was made with cabinet staples. The muffins are moist and have a nice lite peanut butter flavor to them. I sprayed my muffin tins with a mist of pan spray, which worked fine, and they took 23 minutes to bake. Like another reviewer said, great calorie count for a homemade muffin.

Great versatile recipe, this batter can be made into pancakes too! I found it to be the perfect amount of peanut butter, I used all natural peanut butter which I feel ups the peanut taste. Chocolate chips would make this five stars for sure! ~Update~ I also made this egg free for a friend and subbed a 1/4 cup of sour cream for the egg, Perfect! I think the by mixing the sour cream with the peanut butter it helped incorporate it more and boosts the flavour. The egg seems to be just for binding, but I did add a 1/2 tsp. of baking soda because of the acidity of the sour cream, all in all a great substitution if you want it to be egg free!:)

These were just delicious.  Very moist and light. Putting a single square of Cadbury's milk chocolate in the centres of them makes them even tastier and satisfies my chocolate cravings.  Microwave them for 10 seconds for a delicious melted chocolate center.  Thank you for this recipe, it is a new favourite!

I made the recipe as directed but did the oversized muffins. I added a a chocolate crumble oatmeal top which made the recipe not bland. 1/4 flour 1/4 coco powder 1/4 butter 1/3 brown sugar 1/3white sugar and 1/3 rolled oats.

4 stars for how easy this recipe is. It has a subtle peanut butter flavour which is nice. In my opinion, it needs chocolate chips. I cut down on the sugar like other reviewers suggested, didn't miss it. Thanks Jessica Jolley.

These have become a favorite in our house. I put the oats in the food processor to make the texture smoother. I also add a little extra peanut butter and a little nutella.

This is a great basic recipe. I made some changes to it, not because it needed them but because I wanted something specific. I reduced the sugar by 1/4 of a cup and I reduced the milk by 1/4 of a cup. I doubled the peanut butter, added 2 extra eggs, 1/4 cup ground flaxseeds, 2/3 cup raisins and cinnamon and vanilla. I wish I would have had walnuts to add but I am out. They turned out very good and I will definitely make them again.

The recipe as is made 7 regular   size muffins. Great texture, light and airy. Not strong on peanutbutter flavor. Using 1/4 less sugar, they had just the right amount of sweetness for my taste.   Buttered and floured  tins for easy removal without using paper cups. Baked at 400Â° for 20 minutes

I made these intending to simply follow the recipe, but realized mid-mix that I didnâ€™t have any milk.  So, I used butter milk instead.  I also added mini chocolate chips, chopped peanuts and used a mini muffin tin.  It made 5 dozen yummy little muffins!  I will certainly make these again!

Works great with home milled wheat flour.  Just drop to 1 Cup instead of 1 1/4 C.

I doubled the amount of peanut butter and that was the only change I made. I can't imagine using just the amount called for in the recipe, as it was still very lightly flavored with the doubled amount. However it was an excellent textured muffin.

These muffins  were very good, I made some changes, I used whole-wheat flour  instead, added chocolate chips and used 1/2 cup maple syrup instead, because of  it's a low glycemic index,   I used more peanut butter. My family loved them

These are moist and delicious.  I did add some chopped peanut butter chips but I think they'd have been good without.  I read several reviews that said this only made 8 muffins, so I "one and halfed" it.  I ended up with 18 huge muffins.

These muffins were moist, but I also thought they were bland, they need some sort of a flavour boost? Perhaps a handful of coconut and choco chips? Thank you.

Love love love this recipe! I've made them twice so far, added a little cinnamon both in the batter and on top while baking.  Also tried adding some raisins just to see how it would taste...the outcome was delicious! Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

My kids LOVED it!!! OK, I did make a few little changes... I made mini muffins, substituted Wow (soy) butter to make them suitable for sending to school, used 1/4 cup whole wheat for part of the white flour and added  1/4 cup chocolate chips. Like most muffins, they freeze well. A keeper - a very adaptable, kid-approved and easy recipe! Thanks!

I used 1/2 cup of sugar and increased the peanut putter to 3/4 cup. They weren't peanut buttery enough for my liking, but they weren't bad. Next time I will add some chocolate chips and I think they would be perfect!

This is a great morning muffin!  Not overly sweet and very light and moist.  I made a double batch to freeze.  The only change I made was by using almond milk because it is what I had on hand and by accident used old fashioned oats instead of rolled.  That would explain why the batter was a little loose.  However, they turned out great!  My son wants a peanut butter and jelly muffin and this is a great base for that.  Next time I will add peanut butter chips and strawberries.  Thanks!

I made these using other reviewers' comments and mine were egg free. They were nice but for me a PB muffin was not what I thought it would be. The recipe is decent in itself.

I am giving this recipe three stars based on my first experience baking these muffins following the recipe exactly.  The muffins were just ok.  They lacked a little bit of flavor but were more than edible.  Baked in our oven at 400 for 20 minutes.  

After a few modifications, however, we found these muffins to be much more to our family's taste.  We doubled the peanut butter and the oats for a thicker and more hearty muffin.  I have also swapped out the peanut butter with almond butter and added a bit of cocoa powder with very good results.

Very tasty! I wish they were a bit more whole grain though so I didn't feel as guilty eating them in the morning. I did add a tablespoon of vegetable oil since it seemed odd they didn't have any...not sure if it was needed. But they were very moist and delicious. They don't look done in the oven even when they were so I'd recommend testing with a toothpick even when they still look gooey.

I found them a little dry, but still ok if I butter them while warm. This recipe actually produced 16 muffins for me rather than 12.

I made them as written. They are very good, but I like more peanut butter flavor. Will add more chuncky next time. I loved that all ingredients are on hand staples. Also trying to oats to many items.
I only toaster oven and baked @ 350 for 15 minutes.Thanks for sharing!
After cooled the flavor really came out. Great for quick breakfast on the go with your favorite hot drink!
Thanks again!

I think there is way too much baking powder, but I thought, it's probably fine if everyone else thinks so. They have this awful baking powder taste to them. Also, not very peanut buttery, and even with tons of sugar, not great. My kids don't even like them, and hubby's not a fan either.

I used half and half instead of milk, mostly because I had no milk at the time. Added a bit extra peanut butter as well, and they are amazing. Took about 20 minutes to cook, but I got 20 good sized muffins out of the batter, and they aren't too sweet for breakfast. Super easy to make.

Very good muffins.  I followed the recipe exactly.  No need for substitutions, though if I have chocolate chips next time, they will go in!!

Super easy to make. Soft and with the right sweetness, just a little boring I feel. Not enough peanut butter taste. I used reduced fat creamy peanut butter for this one and added some chopped nuts to top some of the muffins I made. The ones with nuts had a little more 'crunch' ( no pun intended :P ) to it. I shall use this recipe again but next time, I'll use chunky peanut butter and double the amount cos i LOVE peanut butter!! Thank you for sharing :D

Perfect muffin texture that I've been looking for. I doubled the pb and still thought it needed more pb taste. Perhaps a swirl of pb or maybe biscoff. Either way this recipe is a keeper, easy and muffins baked up with pretty crowns.
