We really liked this recipe.  I paid attention to the other reviews and added my own twist to it.  After filling the muffin cups with dough, I baked the dough by itself for 2 minutes before adding the beef filling.  This made sure the entire bottom was firm and cooked thru.  I added chopped onion, green pepper, garlic, crushed red pepper, worstechire sauce, prepared mustard, honey, and hot sauce.  I mixed the cheese in to the beef mix.  This made it turn out kind of like a sloppy joe.  It tasted great!  Also, I used butter crescent rolls, and the cup was perfect!  This is a winner!

My husband and I did not care for this.  Maybe it was the type of biscuits we used (grands flakey buttermilk).  BUT This works great with scrambled eggs, sausage pieces and bits of bacon inside them smothered with white gravy and topped with cheese.  It's a great new way to biscuits and gravy!  We call our creation "breakfast in a biscuit".  :) I give that one 5 *'s!

We had these for dinner tonight and they were really good!  They were similar to another recipe I had tried before but these were much better!  I used Grands® reduced fat biscuits and they were the perfect size for my muffin pan.  I think almost any type of filling can be used for some variety.  I'm planning on making this again but with a tuna salad filling instead of the ground beef and bbq sauce.

I brown 1lb ground beef with 2 diced onions , and add a 16 oz jar of honey bbq sauce, and a can of niblet corn.  I mix about 2-3 cups of shredded cheddar and or jack cheese in the meat mix before filling cups.  I make 16 "cups" from 8 jumbo flaky biscuits. My kids call them barbeque cupcakes.

I use bread instead of dough and it has a better flavor. Cut the crusts off and butter the side of the bread that is going into the cups. I also use Tomato soup and 1/2 cup of ketchup instead of BBQ sause. The kids love them and they freeze well.

You can be very creative with these.  I added a lot of bbq sauce, corn, chopped onion and green pepper, and some spices.  Next time, I will give it even more flavor.  I wouldn't use the larger biscuits.  They don't leave much room for the meat.  I agree with some of the other reviews.  You could modify this recipe to any style - pizza cups (meat, cheese, pizza sauce), breakfast (egg, cheese, bacon); buffalo chicken (shredded chicken, hot sauce mixed with cream cheese and ranch); even dessert (replace biscuits with cinnamon roll dough and add apple pie filling)

This was absolutely delicious! The filling is so good, but I did a few things differently with the recipe. First, I did not use store bought biscuits. I made homemade ones using the Never Fail Biscuits recipe, also found on this site. I diced up fresh onions and sauted them with the beef instead of the dried onion. Also, when the meat was simmering with the bbq sauce, I grated some cheese into the mixture. I couldn't wait to taste these as they smelled so yummy all through the cooking process. I still put grated cheese over them even though I added a little into the beef filling. As I stated before, they were great! Thanks for the recipe.

Easy and fun for kids to help make.  My Mom gave me this recipe after she made it for my kids years ago, to their rave reviews.  They loved it then, and now at 17 and 19 they still ask for it.  We put 1 Tablespoon brown sugar in the meat mixture.  To make them a little more meaty use a full lb. ground beef.  If the mixture seems dry I often add more BBQ, we always use regular refrigerated flaky biscuits, fresh onions and maybe a little more cheese.

Very good!  Much better than I expected!  When I was reading the recipe I was thinking that plain ground beef cooked with BBQ sauce needed something more, so here is what I did:
I melted 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter in a skillet, and browned 2 cloves of minced garlic, and one sweet yellow onion which I had finely chopped.  Seasoned well with kosher salt and fresh ground black pepper, and cooked till the onion was very soft.  I then added about a tablespoon of brown sugar, and let the onion and garlic carmelize a little more.  Added 1 lb. of 90% lean ground sirloin to the onion/garlic, and cooked JUST till no longer pink.  Drained off any excess grease with a spoon (wasn't a lot).  Then added probably more than a cup of my favorite bottled BBQ sauce, and let simmer maybe 10-15 minutes.  Right before spooning the beef into the biscuits I added about 1/2 a cup of grated cheese and mixed it in to the beef mixture.
Used 'Grands Flaky Layers' for the biscuits, and a pre-shredded colby/jack blend for the cheese.  Ended up baking them for about 20 minutes total, but they got nice and brown.
These would be fantastic for poker night or a superbowl party, as you really can carry them around and eat without any utensils!

I'm thinking that all kinds of combinations would be good....greek seasoned ground turkey topped with feta cheese maybe!

My kids & all their friends love this. This is SOooo versatile, I made mine with Bold Manwich. You can do all kinds of creations with this from doing Eggs & sausage to anything. Be creative. You'll love it.

Thank you for the great recipe!  My 10 year old son, his friends and my husband LOVED these!  I used about half a bottle of honey and brown sugar barbecue sauce and finely chopped onion cooked with the ground beef instead of dried onions. So easy to make and quick! This is definitely one I'll put on the regular rotation!

This recipe has been in my family for years and is a favorite!  The key is to use basic homestyle biscuits to ensure they cook through.  Do not use the large Grands biscuits.

My boyfriend loved this recipe, it was really easy to make and eat.  The only thing I can suggest for people making this in the future...don't over-fill the cups with meat.  I would only fill 3/4 full with the meat mixture.  Keep in mind the biscuits rise and you won't have the mess I did!

This is really easy and pretty good.  I made Bisquick biscuits instead of refrigerated ones and I prefer the biscuit to be pretty thin.  This allows for more meat.  I also mixed the cheese in with the meat and eliminated a step.  Will definetly make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I was really dubious about this recipe, but was looking for something different to do with ground beef. I'm pleased to say it was actually really good. I used the Grand's biscuits like many others and they molded to the muffin tin really easy and made 8 cups. It's simple to change the taste slightly using different kinds of bottled barbecue sauce too. My husband and kids liked them and they're even good warmed up the next day.

This is a great recipe.  For the biscuits I suggest getting you rolling pin slightly wet and then roll the dough just enough to cover the hole of you muffin pan.  Then drop the meat in and this will pull it down.  My kids and husband loved this recipe!

Made these tonight, and they were a hit! I used Grands biscuits...and added a little extra spice, garlic and some cumin...some leftover mushrooms...tasted great hot out of the oven...and reheated a few hours later...i had 2 leftover biscuits, so I put a scoop of meat, sealed them up and viola! Meat pies! These will be excellent for the coming holidays!
P.S. Made these with eggs, bacon & cheese, and they were a big hit! Reheat great, LOVE this Recipe, so many things you can do with it!

This recipe gave me inspiration to get creative with leftover meat... and even lunch meats including pepperoni! We made a bbq chicken with cheddar cheese, an italian one with pepperoni mozzarella and italian seasonings, a taco one with leftover burger meat and mexican cheese... We've had a lot of fun as a family making these. We've always used the crescent rolls and whatever we happened to have leftover. Awesome ideas and fun for the kids to help!!

This was the perfect kid friendly busy night meal. Even quicker if you make the meat mixture ahead of time. My husband just eats the beef bbq mixture on it's own and I cook a full pound of beef since that's how I buy it. I just save  the rest of the beef for sandwiches to eat throughout the week. I just add more bbq sauce to my own liking. You could also make chicken cups by mixing cooked chicken with cream of chicken soup, parsley and cheese. Both are quick and comforting.

What a great makeover!  We had leftover meatballs that I was getting sick of, so I crumbled them in a pot of barbecue sauce and voila! they were revived in these little biscuit cups.
I'll bet it would work well with leftover hamburgers or meatloaf (maybe) too.
Thanks for an easy meal idea!

My children and husband loved this recipe. I used a 16 oz package of premade shredded bbq beef (found in the packaged meat isle in your grocery store) instead of the recommended mixture --since I am not a big manwich fan. I preheated the beef for 2 minutes before placing it into the cold cresent rolls dough in muffin cups and topped it with shredded cheddar the last 3 minutes. It was a big hit with everyone. The beef was nice and spicey and complimented the rolls with the cheese.  (16 oz of shredded bbq beef makes 8 muffin cups.) Double the recipe cause they will gobble this one up.

Great anytime!  The second time I made them I added a can of Rotel Tomatoes which gave it more flavor.  The whole family love it when we had this for our main course one night.  Will make again just to try different variations of them.

These were pretty good.  I used standard biscuits as called for in the recipe, man those buggers were difficult to work with.  I even tried pre-baking for a few minutes; didn't work for me, they shrunk back down into the bottoms of the muffin cups.  I'm sure the greased cups contributed to that.  I had extra filling since I used a full pound of ground beef and increased the other ingredients accordingly, so I also tried the crustless bread slices suggestion.  I thought they were a LOT easier, and almost as good.  Overall though, I liked these.  So many options.  I'll make them again, maybe with crescent dough.  I agree that the BBQ sauce you choose either makes or breaks this recipe.  I used Sweet Baby Rays Vidalia Onion this time, which I like on beef, but plan to try some others.

I cooked these for my hubbs tonight for dinner and they turned out great!  I like them b/c they were easy to make and they got me out of a cooking rut.  I have a tendency of cooking the same things over and over.  The only thing I did differently was use wheat Grands instead of the regular kind.  I did run out of biscuits and still had some filling left so I just took the advice of an earlier reviewer and cut the crust off some wheat bread, buttered the sides and used them to form into the muffin pan which worked like a charm as well. KUDOS TO THE CHEF!

These are quick, easy, and good. I've also made a taco variation by adding taco seasonings to the meat, and topping with diced tomatoes, cheddar, lettuce, and a dab of sour cream.

This was wonderfully simple and good. Next time I will either pre cook the biscuits a bit or just cook them longer. 15 minutes total was not enough, they were a bit doughy. Also, they need more umph so I will add real chopped onion and garlic next time. Thank you.

Good recipe for a quick meal and a little comfort food. Can substitute Sloppy Joe mix, Taco mix.  Or, use left over cooked chicken/turkey or ham, make a creamed chix, turkey or ham mixture (like a pot pie mixture), or even mix tuna w/a little mushroom soup & insert in these "bisquit" cups. Per a previous reviewer, buttered bread works nicely instead of the bisquit mix.

I have made these for years... my kids love 'em! You can also add corn to the meat - it's a good mixture. I usually use a honey bbq sauce (kids seem to like it better that way). I have also used baked beans (the brown sugar ones) - the kids loved those too. They tend to like sliced American cheese rather than the sharp cheese (I like the sharp cheese better). I have also mixed in Velveta cheese in with the meat to make it creamy. 

This is one dish that we always make on Halloween - they are easy to eat with the fingers while running out the door.

These were great, but I made some changes.  I fried a couple slices of bacon and drained very well. Crumbled the bacon and put in a small  mixing bowl.  Added garlic salt and garlic powder (to taste), a couple tablespoons of Rotel tomatoes and some shredded cheddar cheese.  Mixed all this together.  Flattened the biscuits out and pressed some of the mixture into the biscuits then placed in the muffin tin and baked.  REALLY good - Hubby loved 'em.

Good.  Will have to try it with eggs, cheese and sausage for breakfast.  I agree with the previous poster, next time I'll stir the cheese in and save a step.  But very good and easy to pack for lunches.

I read this and instantly fell in love with all the different options for this recipe. I didn't see one for a sheppards pie type buscuit so I tried it for lunch. It was yummy!!! I added mashed potatoes, ground beef, corn and cheese on top. I think I'll be making it for dinner tonight so the whole family can give it a try :O}

I made these as written for my kids (9 & 2) and they LOVED them. For me and the Mr. I topped them with sauteed mushrooms, garlic and onion and then topped with pepper jack and mozzarella  cheese. I did bake these less time than the recipe said (about 4 minutes less) and they were perfect. Garnished with a dollop of sour cream and some crispy onions. Delish!

The kids loved this!  I used 1 lb. of ground turkey.  It made 16 cups.  I baked the biscuits for 4 min. and then the filled cups for 12 more min.  Next time, I am going to try taco meat and add cheese and salsa plus all the fixings.

This recipe is so simple! It's kind of like sloppy joe in a biscuit. The only changes I made to the recipe were these: (1) mix cheese into the beef not on top, (2) omit the onions b/c of picky eaters, (3) bake the biscuit dough by itself for 2 minutes then add the meat mixture then bake for 12 minutes. I would advise that you pick a BBQ sauce that you really like b/c that's what it will taste like. Thanks for posting this incredibly easy (and very few dishes used) recipe:)

These were so easy and tastey. I have modified this recipe and made Taco Cups. Just use taco seasoning, put leattuce, little diced tomatoes and cheese on top. They are a big hit. These are nice to make for parties since they are easy to transport!

These were good.  What a great idea!
Had to modify a bit- used ketchup and steak sauce for the BBQ sauce, and it was still good.  My son loved them and asked to have them for dinner the next night.

my husband liked these...little does he know how easy they were to make.  I did a few little things different.  I used regular onion which I cooked with the beef, and I used my own baking powder biscuit recipe (simply because I didn't have any of the store-bought kind).  Turned out great!

This recipe is so quick and easy, it's something we throw together as an afterthought when we've both had a long day. We mix it up by using different kinds of bbq sauce, and sometimes we add corn for a little color/veggie action!

Tried these for lunch today and I was pleasantly surprised. Im not much of a "covered in BBQ sauce" type person but I think with the cheese and the bread, it offsets it. A couple reviews stated that they became dry but mine didn't at all. The only thing i had a problem with was getting the biscuits to stay stretched out enough to come up to the top of the pan. You can also use tuna cans to make bigger ones.

Great recipe. I used 1/2 fresh, chopped onion instead of minced onions. Also I used Texas style buttermilk biscuit (10 biscuits) instead. I used rolling pin to flatten biscuits.

Pretty good!! Always looking for something kid friendly and ways to use ground beef since we deer hunt and butcher a 1/4 of a steer each year.  Realized as I started that I was out of commercial BBQ sauce so I quick whipped up my own which I will do from now on for this recipe.  1/4 cup ketchup, very light 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 tsp ground onion, 1/2 tsp ground mustard, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp horseradish, 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar, squirt or two of yellow mustrad to taste.  In doing this, I ommited to onion to be mixed with the ground beef.

I made these tonight. Love the idea but followed other reviewers and baked dough 2 minutes first. We aren't big barbecue fans so I used pizza sauce and they turned out great. Also used a full pound of ground meat. Next time I will use a smaller biscuit. I used the Grands although hubby loved them!

Delicious!  Seeing this recipe takes me back...my mom made these for us when we were kids, and it was always such a treat.  She used Grands flaky biscuits and a honey bbq sauce.

Thanks for this quick and simple recipe. My husband really enjoyed them. I think next time I will try using taco seasoning and salsa instead of the bbq sauce, as others have suggested.

VERY GOOD!!  I had two cans of cheap, regular sized buttermilk biscuits onhand, and used KC Masterpiece BBQ sauce with some onion powder (kiddo doesn't like onions) in the meat.  I rolled the biscuits flat, then spooned in the meat mixture, baked, then sprinkled with cheese right before pulling from the oven.  EVERYBODY at our house loved them, and they were super quick and easy.  Hubby enjoyed the leftovers in his lunch today.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

kids and husband loved it.  Per other reviews I added more BBQ sauce, fresh onions, more cheese, brown sugar, and used Grands biscuits.  I did however add to many onions, which overpowered the flavor.

Simple and very good.  I did cook the biscuits for 2 minutes by themselves then added the beef mixture and followed the rest of the recipe as it is written.  The biscuits were cooked perfectly.

We've used this recipe for a long time.  I use my meatloaf mix on this. Because it cooks faster I sauted my onions and green peppers till tender.  You can use green onions or whatever.  I used 1 lb. of lean ground meat, if using a (lower grade of ground beef you will have a lot of grease).  Mixed green peppers, onions, 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder and 10 to fifteen crackers crushed (you can put them in a zip lock bag and use a meat mallot or rolling pin etc. till crumbled) add barbeque sauce and mix all together. Depending on muffin pan, mini or regular, I used regular, I added the beef raw to dough filling tin to about a little more than half full.  Baked at 375 for 30 minutes depending on your oven time.  My daughters takes between 5 to 10 minutes longer.  Took out added cheese to top and baked till cheese was melted.  We love this. Great Post!!!

I thought this sounded weird, but gave them a try. Used 5 flaky-type biscuits, ground beef cooked with garlic, onion, worcestershire, salt, and mixed with some shredded extra sharp cheddar. Baked for 15 minutes and they came out perfect. I had extra ground beef (not enough biscuits, next time will make 8). Served with sliced avocado.

I changed this quite a bit and it was a big hit with my fiance. I used a real onion diced and added fresh chopped tomato, corn, thyme and garlic. When the cups came out of the oven I topped each one with a little sour cream. Great recipe with these changes.

I try not to rate anything lower than three stars because a lot of recipes are great and some are so-so. These weren't even so-so.  My four-year-old  hated them. I followed the recipe exactly.  They were just bad, bad, bad.

This turned out great but I found the biscuits took quite a bit of manipulation to get them to stay at the top of the pan. For me, they just kept sliding down over and over and over...

This was a fun dinner for us. The ground beef is very tasty with the barbecue sauce.  I used onion soup mix instead of the minced onions and it tasted great! Great family dish!

I Learned to make these back in the 1970's from my neighbor and they take me back just seeing the picture.  Delicious! One tip - to flatten the biscuits, easiest when cold and use a small plate with your fingers pressing them out to edges.  Larger biscuits are easier (like Grands), because they don't keep shrinking - the crust around the top makes them!

This is like the Taco Cups recipe we make.  I used Grands Homestyle biscuits, a full pound of beef and fresh onion.  I increased the sauce to just shy of 3/4 cup too.  Need more food when #2 child is a 15yo boy.

I agree with some of the other reviews. You could modify this recipe to any style. A lot of potential, and I'm sure I'll will be make it again. Before attempting this again, I'll have to figure out what seasonings to use, by reading all of the review, and see that will work for others, and than for me, to make it more flavorful or lot better for me to do! Anyway, excellent to do a SCRATCH on recipes. The more I play with my food, the more I love cooking, to make a recipe that will work for me, that is!! Than I can do the happy food dance!! I've will added this to my recipe book with my additions. THANK YOU! OLD YES,5 Stars and adding more if I can!!

Super Easy and way yummy. These are easy to make and are very filling. The only change I would make would be to add grated cheese to the mixture of ground beef and BBQ sauce.

Wow, I hate to be the negative one. I didn't care for this recipe. My husband liked it at first but didn't like the after effects. Its not healthy at all obviously. Maybe I used the wrong package of dough but the cups got way too large in the oven and meat was falling out everywhere. Not one of my favorite recipes.

wonderful flavor.. all my kids and wife loved em.. I of course seasoned my beef while browning with fresh minced onion, tastefully simple garlic garlic, salt and pepper.  Added cheese to beef mixture since i love cheese. Also, as per other reviewer, increased cook time dramatically.  I ended up cooking them for 25 minutes then adding cheese and cooking another 3-5.  Were still slightly soft  so will experiment next time.. already been requested by my kids.. Quality definitely is based on the BBQ you use.  I used a sauce from a place in Rochester, MN called roscoes.  we have it shipped in to ohio couple times a year cause our whole family loves it. Sweet baby rays is good also. great leftover quickie snack.

This is a good, easy recipe. The kids love that they are shaped like cupcakes or muffins. I agree that it could work for any number of fillings, and be delicious.

This is such a great recipe for pot lucks.  We have lunch with a large group from church every Sunday, and these are a hit.  I've been making them for several years now, and have tried a few different types of biscuits - all of them have turned out well!

We loved these!  They were so easy!  and so quick! They were filling and tasty, and everything a meal should be for a mother with young kids to prepare!  I made homemade biscuits and added grated cheese to the dough.

Wow, easy and delicious! I rated only 4 stars because I ended up adding extra onion and garlic for flavor, and also needed some salt.
For the biscuits I used pancake batter and milk (3 cups batter for 3/4 cup milk), they were just the right biscuit for the meal, soft and there was enough of them for 12 muffins! The cheese was definately a neccessity, marble was just as good!
Thanks for this quick and easy recipe!

I loved these! But I changed almost everything ... sort of. I made my own biscuits and barbeque sauce. I also used hot Italian sausage. I would make them again.

Beef filling is delicious.  Biscuit dough steals some of the flavor though.  I think a healthier and yummier version of this would be to use lettuce wraps instead of the breading.  That would also cut down on baking time.

Very good! These take no time to make and the recipe is very flexible. I didnt have dried minced onion so I just sprinkled my beef with a little onion powder. I also make some chicken ones in crescent dough with mozzarella cheese. Mmm Mmm good!

My dad had always made something similar to this, so I was already familiar with the recipe. I didn't use the cheese and I added brown sugar and a little bit of ketchup to taste to the meat. I reccommend using honey BBQ sauce for the meat, and I used room-temperature reduced-fat cresent rolls for the shells with no sacrifice on taste. I also seasoned the beef with garlic powder, onion powder, and freshly-ground black pepper. Amazing! Even my picky eater gave these a "9.7"....they were gone quick! I'd reccommend doubling the recipe if you have more than two people in your home. Give this a try, especially if you like barbeque....they are YUMMY!

I have made these for years and my friends and family often request them. Years ago when I found this recipe in a local cookbook the barbecue sauce it called for was Open Pit orginial. I have tried other BBQ sauces but love Open Pit the best. Also I add brown sugar to the mixture. YUM

Very tasty. I used taco meat instead of bbq sauce. It was great! Served it with a salad. Easy dish. 

I think that this would also be a great appetizer if you cut the biscuits in half and used a mini muffin pan.

Great Recipe Idea. Made small ones as appetizers and bigger ones as part of a buffet dinner. Didn't have barbecue sauce so I used ketchup, mustard and a little brown sugar. Had Crescent rolls on hand so I pinched the seams together and cut out circles to put into muffin pans. Baked them 2 minutes first before filling as recommended by others. I also added a small amount of minced bell pepper to one batch. Yum. Stored the few leftovers in a ziplock and they were eaten cold the next day because they were so tasty.

Yum!  This was a perfect quick meal for a busy family.  The left overs are going to make a great quick snack or will easily pop in a lunchbox to take to work or school.
My daughter made the finishing touches by topping each filled buscuit with a dill pickle chip :-)
We will definately make these again!

The only reason I gave this 4 stars is the biscuits. I never buy canned biscuits, but decided that's part of what makes this quick and easy so what the heck. They were really sticky and hard to spread out, so I tried to let them warm up a little on the counter so they would spread easier. I also used pre-packaged shredded BBQ beef. They still turned fine and my family enjoyed them. Next time I'll either make the biscuits the old fashioned way or buy Grands biscuits.

Good Tasting but had difficulty spreading bisquits into muffin pan. They kept rolling back up into ball even after spreading into flat circles. Other than that my kids thought they were ok.

I give this 5 STARS!! I made it last night and was a hit with my husband whom doesn't like to try a lot of new things. He's old fashioned meat and potato guy. Wants me to make these again ANYTIME !! This would also be a great appetizer for a party too. Maybe would try with sausage and cheese also.

Great idea! This was good. My family likes using manwich sauce instead of BBQ. Put cheese in the bottom of the cups as well as on top! Yummy!
A great quick meal everyone loves!

I also used this as a base, since I don't like barbecue sauce.  Instead, I added taco seasoning mix and a can of diced tomatoes to the beef (will saute onions with it too, next time).  This was very tasty and a quick and easy mid-week meal.

Very yummy. Would also be good with left-over chili or taco seasoned meat.

Delicious! They are easy to make, even the kids can do it. I recommend using Grand biscuits or two of the smaller biscuits together. Shredded beef would also be great for this dish!

It's so easy and quick even I, who do not have much skills, can make it.  Depending on the amount and kind of source you can make this taste a little different every time.

Great quick fun meal! I had a great idea, we love corned beef hash in the can why not just use instead of beef?

This was quick and easy to prepare and very tasty! I will certainly remember this the next time I am rushed and need something quick. I also added some cheese to the meat mixture and then a little on top. Great idea!

I wanted to make this recipe for a while, but never did for fear that it would take a long time.  Well!!!  It didn't.  I had dinner on the table within a half hour.  They tasted absolutely great.  I used onion soup and a hickory smoked BBQ sauce as well, the flavor wwas fantastic.  My husband says this is a keeper!!  Thanks Karen!!!

It took a lot of working with the biscuits, but in the end it turned out very well.  If the bisuits don't reach all the way up the sides, don't worry, just add a couple of minutes to the cooking before you add the cheese.

I used a hickory/brown sugar barbeque sauce for this recipe and it was wonderful! They're good to have in the fridge for quick snacking (if they last that long).  I'll be making these again.

This is basically the same recipe as the 1968 Pillsbury bakeoff winner called Barbecups. Just use fresh onion and a tablespoon of brown sugar....

This recipe is basic, but so good!  I'm 41 and this was one of the first recipes I learned how to make, when I was 7 or 8.  My husband loves these and requests them often.  I've added salsa to make them Mexican, leftover spaghetti/pizza sauce and Italian spices for Italian, etc.  This is a very easy recipe to adapt to what your family likes.  Serve with french fries or a salad for a great quick meal!

This is a wonderful easy recipe that's really great for parties. I swapped out the biscuit dough for scone dough and used a sweet and spicy barbecue sauce that gave it a really nice sweet twist.

Made these for dinner tonight, and it came out very well. I was looking for something new to do with ground beef and decided to give this a try. It was super easy to make, and didn't take very long at all, which is great with a house full of hungry people! As others said, this is very versatile, and I think next time, I might try and mix it up a bit. Maybe add some diced green pepper, or try with eggs and bacon.

I thought the recipe was pretty good.  However, I did make a few changes in order to enhance it to my liking.  I seasoned a pound of ground beef liberally with seasoning salt, pepper, garlic powder & dried onions.  For the bbq sauce, I used Sweet Baby Rays.  I also added a small can of drained corn.  And finally I used crescent rolls in lieu of biscuits.  The next time I make this I will cook the rolls until they are about 90% done and then add the ground beef mixture & cheese.

If you need something quick and good these are it! I did tweak it a little by using a tsp of minced onion, a half tsp of garlic, and a dash of Worcestershire sauce along with the BBQ. Also, I have a very small toaster oven and it's hard finding pans that can fit it so instead of a cupcake pan, I rolled the biscuit dough in a ball and shaped it like you do clay in art class. Which may be better cause they are easy to get off the pan and you can shape them any way you want, like a heart.

Great Recipe! Really easy and family friendly.  My husband was was less than impressed when i told him what we were having for dinner but then polished off 4 of them :) I am a purest and firmly believe that you make the recipe the way it was intended before you mess with it so much it doesnt even resemble the original recipe.  The only thing i would do next time is bake the cups a little before adding the meat mixture.

These would have been better  if I hadn't used the grande biscuits, or cut each one of those in half.  It was waaayyyy too much biscuit for the amount of meat in each cup, and the biscuits actually pushed the meat out of the cups as they rose.  Don't know if I'll ever try them again using smaller biscuits.

The meet mixture was nice and sweet.  It was a little time intensive to fill each muffin slot with the dough but well worth it.  I will definately make this again.

Quick, Easy & my family Loved them. Increased the beef to 1lb., for I thought 3/4 lb would not be enough.  Used Walmart Brand Butter Jumbo Flaky Bisquits 16oz.  qty 8.  Divided the bisquits in half by chance due to they peeled apart and was able to make 16 cupcake size beef cups.  YUMMY

These were awesome! my husband loved them!!! I decided to make a few different variations! one I did with beef, diced tomatoes, and onions with cheddar cheese! the next one was with beef, bbq sauce, onions and provolone cheese! and last I made a cheeseburger one! with beef, onions, a lil Worcestershire, mustard and ketchup topped with cheddar! I mix all the sauces into the meat for the last few min of the browning process before filling and backing the biscuits with it. The cheeseburger ones were a huge hit! and my personal fav was the bbq! next time I am going to try a taco version with taco seasoning, onions, tomatoes, and cheddar cheese... Ill top them off with shredded lettuce and sour cream!

This recipe was great, I did change it up a bit though. Instead of bbq beef I used bbq chicken that baked in the oven at 350 for an hour covered with tin foil. I then shredded the chicken and added some of the juices from the bbq sauce to the chicken (not to much so the biscuits cook all the way) and proceeded with the rest of the original recipe.

My daughter makes these when we need dinner in a rush for our family of 4 adults and 1 child.  When served with French fries and hot baked beans you have a quick, easy, and wonderful meal.  We never have leftovers.

I have a finicky husband, worse than ANY kid (don't even get me started), and even HE liked it.  Hum, might trade that husband in...........Anyway, have made it twice which means IT's a keeper.  Perfect for those "fast dinners" that working moms need.

These were ok.  I used a full pount of ground beef and cooked it with diced onion and garlic.  Maybe I just didn't care too much for the bbq sauce I used... not sure I'll make these again.  It's a good idea thought and easily customizable.

These were really easy to make and my kids liked them alot and asked that I make them again.  Good for a supper on the go, as they can be picked up and eaten. Leftovers were convenient for the lunch boxes...A keeper!

A real crowd pleaser.  I sauteed a small sweet onion and mixed with ground beef for browning.  Omitted the dried onion.  Use the BBQ sauce of your choice.  Paired it with the Amish Macaroni Salad on this site for a casual, fun dinner.

family loved them. The only issues was getting the dough to stay in a cup shape. Eventually it took my wife to stretch it out while I poured the meat in to keep it from shrinking. Next time I will not use BBQ sauce. Just taco seasoning.

This recipe was very good and easy to make.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's bbq sauce.  I also seasoned the meat with a little salt and garlic powder.  I didn't have dried minced onion, so I finely diced a fresh onion.

These were okay, but nothing to write home about.  I can see where they would be a big hit with young children and they are fairly quick and easy.  I tried to bring them up a level by using sauteed onion, celery and green pepper.  Another reviewer suggested a pizza version and will maybe try again with this in mind.

The kids really liked these.  I used shredded chicken mixed with bbq sauce that I had in my freezer.  Some, topped with red onion before the cheese.  I had extra biscuit cups and not enough meat mixture, so I made a few with some left over breakfast sausage and string cheese.  Something for everyone...although the ones with sausage and cheese needed something more..some kind of liquuid or sauce, because they were sort of dry.

what makes these special is probably the barbecue sauce you use.  if you love your bbq sauce, you'll love these probably.  i used sweet baby rays and loved this recipe.  i used the grands biscuits.  seemed like there was too much biscuit to meat so next time i'd split each grand biscuit and that should be about perfect.  very easy to make and something different for the kids (and us!) than barbecues. thanks for the recipe!

I made these for a Christmas party, but I used barbecue shredded beef instead of the ground beef. They went over so well that I didn't even get to try them until I made them again the next week. I found that the Grands Homestyle (I think that's what they are called - NOT the flaky kind) worked the best for me. I will surely make them again.

The kids like that it's a handheld dinner. I throw in a couple handfuls of matchstick carrots for added fiber/vegetables.

This was very quick, easy, and yummy.  My husband thought it was awesome.  He even told me I could put it on the list of returning recipes. :)  I wouldn't change a thing, however, keep in mind that these do not work so well as leftovers (in my opinion) due to the buscuit dough becoming quite hard.  They are super easy to prepare though, and quick to cook so you could even have them all ready to pop in the oven as appetizers for a party. The plus is that you can use your own preference of BBQ sauce which makes it your own yummy flavor.

Easy and good.  After making them I think you would be able to add veggies to the beef.  Peppers, tomato, corn, peas, etc.  I used a whole pound of ground beef and was surprised it only filled 8 of my 10 biscuits.  So will surely add some veggies to the beef next time.  I also put a dollop of sour cream on top.  Delicious!

These were absolutely fantastic!  The recipe makes more than I thought it would, and the cups are very filling.  I was also very impressed with how well the cups physically held together.  Once they had cooled, you could just pick them up and bite right into them.

I used Grands Flaky Layer biscuits, which I split in half.  You definitely need to flatten them out though after separating.  For the last two, I thought I'd just use a whole biscuit.  They turned out fine, but there was way too much bread that way.  I'm a bread person, but it is better to only use half a biscuit.

I also put the cheese on (accidentally) before the initial bake, but it turned out just fine--and made it  even easier on me!

In the meat mixture, I used fresh onions, which I cooked with the browning meat, and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  The only BBQ sauce I had on hand wasn't a very good one, so I had to play with it a little adding brown sugar and worchestershire, but that was all jsut to my own personal tastes.

Overall, this is a WINNER!  Thanks for the great recipe--it is going into regular rotation in our home :)

These are yummy! We used homemade biscuit dough and used taco meat with cheddar cheese on top. Easy recipe to make variations to!

This was a 5 in our book - but probably would have only been a 4 as written.  I used ground turkey cooked with fresh diced onion and a little diced green pepper, seasoned with S&P and some onion powder and paprika.  Then added Famous Dave's Sweet & Sassy BBQ sauce and simmered.  Also used reduced-fat crescent rolls.  Really good comfort food and will definitely make again - my boyfriend said the leftovers tasted even better 3 days later!

Five stars from the family....hubby especially loved these and ate 4! I made 8 with the homestyle buttermilk biscuits. Probably used more than a pound of ground beef, cooked fresh chopped onion with it instead of the dried onion. I also added some McCormick BBQ seasoning to the meat, then added the bbq sauce. I just used what I had leftover, a little Kraft spicy and KC Masterpiece original. Topped with cheddar/montery blend. They smelled and looked so good. Will definately make again.

This recipe has been around for decades. It was a pillsbury bake-off winner from the 1960's. It's still a winner today. My mother-in-law gave me this recipe. She used to make it for my husband when he was a kid. I use a full pound of beef and add 2 T of brown sugar. I love the sweetness the brown sugar gives the meat. I also use more cheese, because my husband and I are both cheese addicts. I highly recommend you make this dish. It's very kid friendly too.

These are perfect for a last minute dinner idea!  I made a double batch of the filling so I could freeze half for a later meal and it worked out perfectly.  I used 1lb ground beef and 1lb ground lean turkey, 1 whole bottle of kc masterpiece bbq sauce and the grands reduced fat flaky bicuits (which I thought worked better than the buttermilk kind).  Once I took half the meat mixture to freeze, I added a little shredded cheese to the meat. I halved each biscuit, thus making twice as many- otherwise the biscuits would have been way too big.  And finally I sprinkled the tops with cheese towards the end of baking.  Turned out SO yummy and I will make these regularly!  Thanks! *update 3/17/09* Used 2.5 lbs ground turkey, 1 bottle KC masterpiece BBQ, 2 cans biscuits and 1 small package shredded cheese.  Made 32 cups and we were able to  freeze a ton of them!  These are very filling and go great with a big salad! :)

I have a finicky family and this was a super hit with them.  I made it with the taco version of seasonings and provided some ground beef sauce on the side that was essential because the biscuits are a little dry

Super easy and great to eat.  I used ground turkey and browned it with chopped onion.  Stubb's BBQ sauce gave them a great flavor.  My dad loved them and ate 4 - he usually hates ground turkey.  I made 8 with Grand's and used up the remaining meat with four pieces of bread.  They all turned out great.

Wow! What did I do wrong?  I made these with Sweet Baby Rays BBQ and I was the only one out of 5 to like them.  The kids wouldn't touch and the husband didn't like.  Way too sweet, it could have been the BBQ selection.  I do think these would be neat for TACO meat and toppings....but maybe too much work for the trouble.  The biscuits were kind of hard to keep in the muffin tin.

The kids love this one.  It is easy to have prepared and in the fridge waiting to bake.  
This was great on a busy night.  I was able to preheat oven, toss the meat into biscuits and bake.  Easy clean up also.

Instead of dried minced onion, I added some diced yellow onion to the beef while browning.  The one thing my husband didn't like was the canned biscuits.  Other than that, quick, easy and tasty.

My entire family from a six year old to her 60 year old grandmother loved these.  I used reduced fat Grands as others have suggested and sauteed fresh diced onion while browing the meat.  I added about 3/4 BBQ instead of the 1/2 called for.  We'll definitely do these again.

I needed something quick and easy to put together tonight and I came across this recipe.  My kids like Sloppy Joes so I figured it was worth a try.  I added fresh chopped onions, salt, pepper , chopped cilantro, green onion chopped and some Worcestershire sauce and a little creole seasoning.  The result was very good.  Thank you Karen!

I liked this one pretty well. I made an adjustment though. I put the bbq beef in the bottom of a pan and put the biscuits on top, baked it til the biscuits were brown. I took it out added cheese and placed it back in the oven til melted. I will be making this again.

These were pretty good and easy to make.  I used the Grands biscuits but next time I think I will try crescent dough.  This could be pretty versatile as it sounds good with taco meat and cheese as well.

I've made this recipe and another one very similiar several times.  The other recipes calls for 1 tbsp. brown sugar.  My one comment is how fast the meat sometimes dries out.  This has to be eaten hot and isn't good left over at all.  I didn't have any BBQ sauce the last time I made it, so I did my homemade sloppy joe mixture.  My son of course loved it this way since he hates anything spicy.  My husband actually says this is one of his favorite meals.  Not mine, but very easy and quick when you're busy.

the biscuits didnt cook all the way, they remained doughy and raw on the bottom.  I think for the future I would half each of the biscuits and use 1/2 per cup.  the mixture was very good though.

Im glad I found this recipe.  This is a great appetizer dish to add with all my others.  These just melt in your mouth and are very rich.  After a few of them they will fill you up.  We also added a little dollop of sour cream on the top of each of them when they were done.  DELICIOUS!

This is one of my daughters favorite meals but I do make a few changes.  First, I don't press the buscuits into a muffin tin, instead I put the meat mixture on the bottom of the pan, then add the cheese and top with biscuits layed side by side (no need to press together.)  I brush each biscuit with a bit of melted butter and a sprinkle of parm cheese. The biscuits get nice and toasty brown and the cheese bubbles up around them.

The idea was fun, but the barbeque beef was just a little overpowering.  I'd like to try it with some lighter chicken mixure.

Fun, simple, and easy to make!!  A little dry...feels like it needs an au jus, sour cream or something to dip it in b/c of the bread I guess.  Thx!

I've made these 3 times now. My sister, my 2 kids and my nephews LOVE them. The kids are picky about onions so I use onion powder in the meat and they come out fine. I was thinking I might try a variation with spaghetti sauce and motzarella on top. One of the times I made them I had accidently grabbed butter flavored biscuits... not a good idea.

These are easy to make, savory snacks that disappeared quickly at the party where I served them.  However, they tasted a bit dry- add more sauce, if possible.  Additional spices could also help.

My family LOVED these! I made an extra pan so there would be leftovers...they were gone before bedtime. They were very simple to make and would be a good one for kids learning to cook. I will definitely be making this again.

I made this the other night. My husband said it was very tasty. I suggest adding 2 TBsp. of worcestshire sauce, and making sure you don't use flaky biscuits. I will surely make this again!

I actually found these a bit of work. I took other peoples advice and prebaked the biscuits, which made them a litte tough. It wasn't a huge hit in my house, but the bunch ate them, so I give it three stars.

I must have used the "wrong" sauce.  We didn't really care for these.  They came out kind of sweet and it was an odd mixture with the biscuits.  I will probably try again with a smokier tasting sauce.  I was bummed though when I threw a ton of them out.

I found this recipe a long time ago and never came back to rate it. This is one that my husband requests at least once a month, somtimes two or three. It is very easy and fun to make. I've used regular buttermilk biscuits, flaky, and once on accident I used the biscuits that had butter added to them. They all turned out delicious. I usually forget the onion too but it still tastes great. The only thing I don't like is there is always a moist spot in the middle of the biscuit at the bottom of the ground beef. But unless you burn your biscuits you can't get rid of it. Also they are very filling. We always have three or four leftover out of a package of eight.

We didn't have any biscut dough, so I used bisquick mix and milk to make my own. That made the biscuts very hard to shape into a muffin tin. Also, the biscuts were gooey where they touched the meat. Overall, though, they were very good. I would make them again.

This recipe was very tasty and very very easy.  
I started with a fresh onion, sauteed it with a little butter and some garlic. 
I'm not a big fan of BBQ sauce, so used marinara instead, it was great, this is a keeper.

I was so happy to find this recipe after craving these for years! When I was a child, some family friends made these a couple of times when my family visited -- they made enough of an impression on me that I craved them decades later. ...I don't have a muffin pan at the moment, so I used crescent rolls instead of biscuit dough and made the dish as a "wreath" on a baking stone. ...The flavor of the barbecue sauce is very important in this dish, so I always use a barbecue sauce that I love.

My husband and I did not care for this but my teenage son even ate the leftovers the nexy day for a snack.  It was a little too swwet for our taste. If I made it again I would leave out the BBQ sauce and give it a Mexican flare with green chiles.

Wow, I couldn't believe that I found this recipe - my mom used to make these when I was growing up.  Only difference was she added 2 Tbl. brown sugar with the sauce, which is a must!  I found that greasing the muffin cups makes the biscuits slide down the sides, and not come to the top of the pan - I won't do that next time.  I left off the cheese (didn't think it went).  Note that most packages of beef are sold as 1 lb., so if you use the full amount, be sure and add more sauce (3/4 cup is perfect), or they will be dry.  Big hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

I used sloppy joe sauce as another reviewer suggested, and while I thought they were just "ok", my husband and his grandmother loved them.  I'd like to try this using pizza sauce and maybe adding in some chopped peppers & onions.  I think there are many possibilities with this recipe!

I tried this recipe out on my 7-year old son and my boyfriend.  My son loved eating it with his hands.  They both seemed to like it more than I did.  I think it had to do with the barbecue sauce I used.  I didn't care for it that much.  I may try this again, but I'll be a bit more selective about my sauce.

This quick and simple recipe was a hit in my house of picky eaters. Even my 15 mo old ate it and he's been anti meat here lately.

This was pretty good. The kids ate it! I used cresent rolls like some posters suggested and I'm glad I did. I also used a combination of 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 Italian sausage, some garlic amd bottled spaghetti sauce and shredded mozz. cheese. I think next time I need to spice it up with pepperoni in the sauce. Not bad! I was going to try it as posted, but I am the only one who likes bbq beef in my family )-:

This was delicious...with a few adjustments.  I used Manwich as advised by others and used real onion and added red, green and yellow peppers.  My kids and husband gobbled it up and wanted more.  I'll definitely make this again as it's very hard to find a family pleaser and this one made it on that list.

I thot these were really good.  Hubby said they were okay.  I rolled out my bisquits between saran wrap fairly thin.  They went into the muffin cups nicely and didn't shrink back.  Nor did the bisquits push the filling out like some had reported.  Made them just like the recipe, but used 1 lb of ground chuck and 3/4 of a lb would have been plenty, but made a good sloppy joe burger.  Warmed them in my toaster oven.  Will definately be making these again.

Not very pretty out of the oven. But the idea has promise. Next time I will use cresent rolls for added flavor and ease with muffin cups.  I used left over sloppy joe mix and it tased fine.  Will make again with a few changes. Good basic idea to build on.  Pizza style would be good!

Evertime I make this I get requests for the recipe.  I use fresh onions and a sweet barbecue sauce.  The one change I made was to use Crescent Roll dough and mini-muffin cups.  We found the biscuit dough to be too heavy.  On average I take these to three or four potlucks per year and they always disappear.  My kids enjoy making them as well.

These are excellent! I found a similar recipe on the pillsbury bake off site. The other recipe which I go by calls for 1 lb ground beef and 2 tablespoons of sugar. VERY GOOD! I used pillsbury's refrigerator biscuits.

My picky daughter thought this was cute AND ate it, so I'm happy.  But what I really like about this recipie is how versitile it can be - just look at all the members who've been inspired!  I personally might try my mom's spinach pie filling with it.

Very good and very easy!  Kids would love them, so I'll have to make them next time my niece and nephew are over for dinner.  They taste a lot like the barbeque rolls we can buy at our local pizza shop.  Yummy!  -Allison

This was a very simple recipe.  I find it always helps me to read other reviews and this time was no exception.  I bought the Pillsbury Grands and it worked out very well.  Also, I thought I had cheddar in my frig, but I only had shredded mozzerella.  It worked out well with the substitute cheese.  My boyfriend and co-worker enjoyed them.

I used the larger disposible pans instead of the muffin size which means it needed more dough, so I would suggest the Pillsbury Grands for it. Was very good too!  =)

I used two biscuits together and had a lot of trouble getting them to go up the sides of the muffin pan. They worked out pretty well and I made a double batch of the beef and put half of it in the freezer. My kids loved them! I also wrapped each cup individually in colored saran wrap which made them easy to grab.

Love this recipe!  I substitute Manwhich sauce for the barbecue, onions, etc.  Makes this even faster to make!  I use the Grands flaky biscuits.  You can either get it in 6, 8, or 10 so it is a very flexible recipe!

This recipe is GREAT!  My fiance absolutely loves it, and it's become one of our weekly (or biweekly) meals.  I use the giant muffin pan and Grands Buttermilk biscuits.  That way I end up with 6 really big beef cups... so it's more of a dinner dish.  I use Spicy Honey BBQ and sometimes substitute fresh diced onions for minced.  I also add cheese into the beef mixture and then sprinkle just a little on top.  Great recipe! Thanks!

This recipe is very good.  I used spicy BBQ sauce and onion soup mix in place of minced onion.  This dish, however, is not that of a sit down family dinner.  It is more of an appetizer or "party food".  Very quick and easy to make!

My family thought this was a good tasting meal. A little dry, I would recommend adding more liquid to the recipe. I will probly fix it again in the future but not anytime soon.

these were really good...i was using smaller biscuits and found that pressing two together made it easier to line the muffin cups. and instead of minced onion, i used onion soup mix..tasted great!

We learned to make these in my 8th grade cooking class. The teacher called them "barbi-cups." They are quite good. Instead of canned bisquits, I whipped up a batch of my homemade bisquite dough. Also, I like to add some fresh finely chopped onion to the meat instead of the dried minced onion; otherwise I make them as written. Thanks for posting the recipe.

I made this and it was so good!!! I used sloppy joe mix instead of what the recipe called for because it’s what I had on hand. But it turned out so good!! I let the cheer brown maybe a bit too much, BUT it was still yummy!!!

I decided to make this for an easy weeknight dinner.  I baked the biscuits for about 4-5 minutes before adding the bbq beef and popping back into the oven.  It was a major hit with my husband and kiddos so it will be incorporated into my weekly meal plans more regularly.  I hesitated on adding the cheese,  as I'm not big on cheese with bbq but it was SO good.  Add the cheese! You can season the beef to your liking and onions,  peppers etc.  Delicious recipe!

If your ground beef is already cooked from a previous meal then this is super quick and easy. 

I thought it was a good meal!

Followed the recipe exactly...I liked them, but they weren't a big hit with the kids. I have been told that the next time I make them, to put less bbq sauce.

Husband loved it, so I would definitely make again.  I made baking mix biscuits as I did not have any refrigerator biscuits.  I would probably try a different type of "bread" next time as I thought it came out a bit floury tasting.  Maybe some crescents.

These were very good.  I eliminated the cheese and similar to another reviewer, I cut 8 Grand biscuits in half (used original, non flaky layer), rolled to desired shape and cooked for 2 minutes before placing the beef mixture inside.  Yummy.

I used ground beef, manwich, and added red onion. It was fabulous. Definitely going to make again. I bought buttermilk biscuits and used two per muffin spot just to make sure there was enough dough. Don’t know if that was necessary.

Great quick recipe. I used a spicier BBQ sauce because we like a little heat.  Served with a side of corn. Turned out great.

My OH calls these "Non-Sloppy Joes" because baking them in the biscuit cups makes eating them much neater :)  

I saw in other comments that the Pillsbury Grands biscuits were too big, so was going to bake them in my XL muffin cups. I bought Annie's instead, as this brand does not use artificial flavoring. They tasted just like the biscuits I make from scratch, and don't have that weird artificial flavor that Pillsbury does.  

A note on the cheese - I used 56 g / 2 oz for the 6 XL muffin cups, so 1/3 C of cheese for 12 standard muffin cups is probably inadequate. Plan to adjust calorie count accordingly.  

Because I was using larger muffin cups, I added 3 min to the baking time.  

I used a pound of ground beef and since I was out of BBQ sauce, used 1 C of the "Ruby Drive Sloppy Joes" sauce recipe found here. (Started off with 2/3 C but it needed more.)  

Another reviewer said she use slices of bread to line the muffin cups - I might do that next time as it took longer than I'd like to form the biscuits into the cups.

This was great.  I was able to make it with all organic ingredients that I had on hand, avoiding some of the ingredients/additives I don't like to use.  I used Immaculate Baking Co refrigerator biscuits, organic ground turkey and Barbecue sauce and threw in a little fresh spinach (which wasn't noticeable at all to my child). I did roll out each biscuit so it would be thin enough to bake through and after 20 min of baking I topped with shredded Horizon Org Monterey Jack  Cheese.    I found that they needed to cool 20-30 min for the dough to retain it's shape.  The filling was still quite warm but the biscuit wasn't doughy that way.  I can imagine a lot of variations but this would be hard to beat.

Fast recipe. Tasted good too. I feel like there's a lot of dough for the amount of beef, but it's easy to adjust. I will definitely make this again.
I used the ''Bullseye Chicken and Ribs BBQ sauce'' and it was really good.
I also put onions directly in my meat for more flavour.

Made it just like it said. We really liked it. A bit dry but I think that's why my husband liked it too. Didn't have a wow factor that's why not 5 stars. But an easy quick meal to make!

The family loved this dinner idea!  It was easy and quick to make.  My husband bought the larger size biscuits and would use them again.  We added extra cheese because everyone loves cheese!  We will be making these again.

I will definitely make this again. I gave it four stars because I did  prefer some different ingredients to make it taste perfectly. From reading other reviews I took the advice of OLDBATTLAX mainly, and a couple other suggestions.  Before adding the other ingredients to the biscuit molds I did throw it in the oven for a couple minutes to let the biscuits bake, and believe it helped. The honey bbq sauce was great advice.  To the meat I added the cheese, a little dried minced onion, a couple chopped scallions and chopped up some red pepper. It really worked out well with Mexican cheese.  This will definitely be an easy one for the rotation of weeknight meals.  I can see how people would want to use their own dough, depending on the size of the cups used. I used two different sizes, the jumbo and regular. The regular was much easier to dough mold.

Very tasty and easy weeknight dinner. I'm glad I read the other reviews before making this because the tip on pre-baking the biscuit cups for 2 minutes made them not get soggy on the bottom, something I was concerned about.

10.26.16 ~ a good quick dinner to pull together for a weeknight meal. I have made these many times using ground burger, deer burger, roast beef, chicken, etc. Make sure you use a bbq sauce that you really like in this recipe. This time I used Rib Rack® Campfire Cider BBQ Sauce and it was delicious. Served this with 'Dijonnaise Potatoes' from AR. This recipe is just like another one on AR only this one uses dried onions and the other one uses chopped onions. We like both versions and have them often during the cooler months.

My family likes a bit of spice so I added 1/4 tsp Hungarian Paprika and 1 Tsp of Garlic Plus to the hamburger mix.

AWESOME!! Will definitely make again

This was something my Mammaw made when we were kids and  make them occasionally.  The cheap canned biscuits are the best ones to use for this.

Wow on the barbeque beef cups: great compliment for a salad or should I remark a side dish.

Most groceries stores carry some ready made packages' of seasoning.  Just follow the directions.

Good additional side dish to follow:  Is a mexican seasoning mix, and black  and green olive multi cheese, etc.  Using your flatten biscuit.  Multi scenario.  Thanks.

I make it with fresh, diced onion. I also brush BBQ sauce on top prior to baking. 
We call them "Meat Muffins" just to be silly :)

I have been making these for years. They are a family favorite. Quick, easy, delicious and they reheat very well in an oven (They reheat ok in a microwave but the biscuit gets kind of chewy if you let it go too long.) This is one of those recipes where you can adjust it to your own personal preference. Mix in some cooked veggies, change the meat from beef to turkey or chicken, whatever you have on hand can work great.  Even swap out the BBQ completely and fill them with what ever your imagination can come up with. Chicken and gravy was a winner for us. The biggest thing to remember is you have to cook them until the biscuits are VERY golden brown on the exposed edges. Don't let them burn but if you pull them out too soon the biscuit on the inside won't be completely cooked.

I baked the dough by itself for a few minutes before putting the beef mixture in each cup. It kept the bottoms from getting soggy. I use freshly diced onions. Your kids will LOVE this one!

I've been making this since I originally found the recipe on the Pillsbury website (they had a TV commercial years ago showing how to make this)...it's too bad they aren't being accredited here, but either way that doesn't make the recipe any less delicious.

We liked these a lot more than I expected, to be honest.  I was looking for a quick meal that my husband and kids would enjoy and this fit the bill.  Super simple, just a few ingredients, and definitely delicious.  I used two cans of flaky-style biscuits and had exactly the right filling amount for 16 of them.  The only change I made- other than the extra can of biscuits- was that I pre-baked the empty muffin cups for 2 minutes in a 400° oven before filling them.

I have made these for years, we love them. I like the variations that some have come up with for breakfast, dessert and chicken cups. The original recipe I had added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the meat with the  BBQ sauce but since my diabetic dad is living with us, I leave out the brown sugar and we don't miss it. I started using crescent rolls because that was all I had one day.  It's a little tricky because you have to cut off the pointed half and work the two pieces together but we like them better with the crescent rolls than biscuits. The biscuits have gotten too large, another example of portions increasing over the years.

This was delicious!  I did make a few changes; a small onion, diced,  instead of dried onion and I made Chef John's buttermilk biscuits in lieu of store bought biscuits.
  Will definitely be making this again!

The family LOVES this! 
The only thing I did differently was to sautée the dried chopped onion in a tablespoon of olive oil then added the ground beef for browning. I used Grands Jr Honey biscuits, which were plenty enough starch/bread and the honey added a slightly sweet flavor which was really nice. Great recipe, will make it again for sure.

I was too tired after work to make biscuits, so I put the meat mixture open faced on top of toasted burger buns, put the cheese on and stuck them in the oven for about 8 minutes. This was really tasty with a green salad on the side. A quick alternative to sloppy joes.

So easy and customizable!  I made it almost as directed, except I used ground turkey.  Substituted a pack of french onion soup mix for the onion and added some splashes of worcestershire, and a little less bbq.  You could use this idea for a mexican meat biscuit too, or substitute shredded chicken.  I like another posters idea of using mini muffin tins and making finger food too!

I made this for my son's birthday party (a bunch of 14, 15, and 16 year olds). I made some modifications based on previous reviews and my preferences. I tried the store brand biscuits the first time but the second time I used crescent rolls (love these much better!!). I cooked them at 360 because when I tried 375, it cooked them too fast, the dough was too brown, and it was cooked all the way through. At 350 it was too low and took too long. So 360 was just right!  I pre-baked the dough for 5 minutes then put the meat in and thus made sure the dough was cooked all the way through. I did add smoked paprika and other seasonings to my taste. The next day, my son's friends texted him and asked if I could make more and send some to school with him. LOL!!!

I especially like that the "filling" can be changed to any number of choices -- not just barbecue/ground beef

I grew up eating these, but never got the recipe from my step mom! I was so happy to come across this and it tasted like childhood! Easy, kid friendly, husband approved, and a nice comfort food!

Excellent filling. I made the beef mixture exactly as the recipe called for. I followed the suggestions of others, and made my own biscuits from scratch. Delicious! Will make again and probably play around with the filling and add more ingredients, such as fresh onion, jalapenos,diced tomatoes and maybe a touch of fresh cilantro.

After a long day at work, it is nice to be able to come home and make an easy, simple meal your family enjoys.  I used crescent rolls instead and fresh minced onions; added sour cream on top.  Thanks for sharing

These were really good. I used the easy drop biscuit recipe from this site with some adjustments, mainly added cheese to the dough and some spices. To the meat I added some fresh garlic and some Worcestershire sauce which added more flavor. Will be making these again.

Made this recipe tonight mainly because I was looking for something different. I was very pleased with the outcome!! Although I did add the spices that we like, everything else was done according to the recipe directions. I saw one post say they cooked the biscuits before adding the beef mixture.....I found that there was no need for this. Served with a tossed salad, this meal was great!!

Quick, easy, and inexpensive. Of course i season the meat to my own taste, but the bbq sauce and cheese finalize the flavor.  The biscuit as a holder is brilliant. It is good for parties. I think 2 buttermilk biscuit dough cans will make 20 cups which is enough for any get together.

Loved it! It's tasty and still so simple to make. My husband and my two 3-yr olds loved them. I even have to make double every time because we go for seconds and lunch the next day haha. I did mix in the cheese with the beef. I also followed the advice to bake the biscuits alone for 2 minutes prior to adding the filling. I've already recommended it to friends.

My grandma found this recipe in a magazine or newspaper & gave it to my mom & I too have made it. We usually just make our own bbq sauce since it requires nearly a whole bottle to keep everything moist. I personally, think the a normal biscuit would make a better cup than the grands (I'm not a big bread or biscuit fan). My family has made these with taco filling and a pizza version with toppings and pizza sauce in them. The bbq is my favorite though!

Amazingly simple and perfect for in a pinch, or as hors d'oeuvres at a party. Was planning to make hamburgers, went to the freezer to get out my buns only to discover I had none! Did a super fast search ( it was dinner time and the hubs was hungry ) and found this. Had all the ingredients and said sure, why not! Southern meal it is! Followed recipe to the "T", and it turned out perfectly. Biscuits were cooked thoroughly to the bottom. I used the Grands over sized biscuits which made less quantity ( 8 instead of the 12 ), but 2 filled me up. Served with Cracker Barrel fried apples, organic sweet corn, & sweet tea. It was perfection! I will def make again when I need a super fast albeit fattening meal.

Just made this last night and I liked it! I used the Grands Jr. Biscuits since they're a little smaller. I did use a sweet BBQ sauce and I think I'll use a different one next time. It was just a little too sweet for me but all in all hubby and I liked it!

Family favorite turns out great and easy to adjust for my one child that dosn't like BBQ.   I pull some meat out for her and top with a little ketchup and cheese and it becomes a mini hamburger.

Fun for kids, I used 1 pound of meat and 1 cup of cheese this made 12 beef cups total. The biscuit dough is enough to make 8 cups and then I used bread to make 4 more.The biscuit cups turned out much bigger of course and the flavor overall is much better. Recipe says it serves 6, now for an adult I think you would probably eat 2 cups and a child would eat one ( and want more!) keep this in mind my family of five I would next time pick up another biscuit mix.

Used this recipe for a baby shower/finger food type deal and it was perfect. You could easily modify it with taco style meat, I even made them pizza bites, but the bite sized appetizer was perfect for when my husband brings home people for a game.

I made these for a potluck and they were a HUGE hit. From the burliest guys to the daintiest of old ladies, I was getting compliments on them left and right! They were fun to make and the compliments were even more rewarding as I made my own biscuit dough rather than buying it pre-made, which is very easy. Will definatley make these again!

In my house we refer to these as Blisscuits. Everyone loves them and devours them. My only changes are that I don't use the minced onion, I use a bit more bbq sauce and I throw in a tablespoon of brown sugar. YUM!

What a fun delightful dinner. I did not add all the extra spices, just used the 1/2 cup of bbq sauce and dried onion, black pepper. Next time I would use fresh onion diced. 
Thanks for a great reciped, this is a keeper

Wonderful recipe. Kids absolutely love it, I used croissant rolls instead and it had a wonderful flaky/buttery texture instead of the dryness from the biscuit.  Would make again and again.

These were good.  I will use a different barbeque sauce next time though, as the one I selected was too sweet.  I may try out different fillings, too, as suggested by others (e.g., sausauge/eggs).  I think these would make great finger food for a party.

Made these Halloween night so we could munch between knocks on the door.  They were actually "fun" to eat with a salad.  Going to try the mini ones and take them to the neighbors for the football game.  Thanks!

This recipe was easy and delicious. The only thing I did different was to add one caramelized onion instead of the dried onion. Will definitely be making them again.

I use this recipe, but instead of making as a meal, use mini muffin tins instead to make appetizers and snacks that are always a hit at picnics. I also add in a dash of brown sugar.

These were very good!  I used reduced fat grands with turkey burger and reduced fat shredded cheese for a low-fat version.  A very filling and good, fun, easy meal!  I'm sure they would be delicious with a pizza version like the other reviews said.

These are great! My bf and I headed to Chicago because admission was free at the Museum of Science and Industry. After being stuck in traffic for nearly TWO hours (terrible storms in the area) and being CUT OFF by a gal trying to "force" her way into the lane for traffic headed toward the parking garage (who btw, got the last "go ahead" to park in the museum parking garage), we gave up and came back home (sigh...). I wasn't planning to make dinner since I thought we'd be in Chicago until late evening. I needed a quick fix and these fit the bill perfectly :) I used a 10 oz. tube of Pillsbury Grand's homestyle buttermilk biscuits and was able to make 5 jumbo sized "cups." I followed Karen's directions exactly, but next time I'd like to change things up a bit by making sloppy joe or pizza beef cups (I think I'd like these versions better...). Served with tater tots and corn, this was a very filling meal. I wish I had made more to freeze for later! Thanks for sharing this easy, economical, kiddo-pleasing (if you have them...) recipe Karen! My bf REALLY enjoyed these (which is a HUGE plus!!!) :)

These were ok. It was too sweet for me and my boyfriend thought it was too doughy (I used the Grands Flaky style biscuites). I can see how they'd be fun for kids though. Too bad I don't have kids. ;-)

This was great.  I added a little brown sugar to the mix.  Next time I will probably add just a little more bbq sauce so it doesn't dry out as much in the oven, but we really loved this.  I can't wait to try with mini muffin tins for a nice appetizer.

These were great!!  My family loved them and they were definitely kid friendly.  I used very lean ground beef and drained it at much as I could. I also added small amount of yellow mustard to cut the sweetness of the bbq sauce I used.  I used reduced fat cheese on top to save a few calories.  All in all these were tasty little sloppy joe type bites. Thanks for the recipe.

This was easy to make, but it was nothing special.  I'm going to try it again but use pizza type toppings instead.  I like the idea of the doughy cup and think it could be easily adapted with better fillings.

I used shredded chicken instead of beef and honey BBq Sweet Baby Rays. I got rave reviews and give it back because it was so easy.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  My two-year old took a bite and said, "mmm... good..."  :)  We had to bake it a little longer than 15 minutes, but it came out perfectly golden brown.  In the future, I'd like to try it with more veggies mixed in and a more tomato-y sauce.  We used the Grand flakey biscuits and they came out fine.  I do wonder though, if I could use just half of a biscuit as a shell -- will it still hold up?  I'll try next time and post my results.

I did a "pizza" version of this recipe.  I added pizza sauce, chopped pepperonis and chopped mushrooms and mozzarella cheese on top.  Very addicting!

I was pleasantly surprised at how good these are. They're quick and easy, which makes them great for a weeknight meal. I didn't have any dried onion, so I just seasoned the beef with onion and garlic powder. I wasn't sure if the baby would like them, but he devoured the one we gave him.

I made these for a picnic, which is perfect to serve at room temperature or better just out of the oven. I made a few changes though. I used 1 lb. of ground beef, I used 3/4 cup of bbq sauce, and I let this mixture simmer for 15 minutes to really meld those flavors together. This is a very simple recipe and for anyone who likes a lot of sauce, I also serve a bowl of extra bbq sauce on the side.

This was so simple, but pretty darn good.  My husband said it reminded him somewhat of a meat pie from Australia.  I added minced garlic, chopped onion, S&P to the ground beef.  Otherwise, everything else was the same in the preparation.  I used the buttermilk jumbo biscuits for the "cups".  This would be good with ground turkey, ground chicken, even regular chicken.

These were really good!  I upped the hamburger to 1 lb and upped the BBQ sauce.  They were easy to make and not too time consuming.  Although I will smash out the dough a little bit before I put them in the muffin pans because I think it will be a easier to work with.  Very good and I will be making these again.

This was good and fun. I used the bigger biscuits and used a 6 count muffin pan. Next time, I think I might do Italian (Spagetti sauce, hamburger, and Mozarella cheese). On my all time favorite list.

I have gotten into the habit of cooking a meal for my girlfriends parents everytime I am at their house.  This recipe was a big hit with them and with me.  I did change it a bit.  I used fresh chopped onion instead of dried and I added it while the meat was still cooking.  It seemed to add alot of flavor to the meat. Other than that this was an amazing recipe and I look forward to trying it again soon.

These were pretty tasty.  I minced a little bit of onion which I cooked with the meat instead of the dried onion.  Next time I might add some corn as others suggested.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a very simple but delicious recipe that reminds me of something I made in a junior high home economics class.  I used a spicy, smoky barbecue sauce and it tasted great.  I can totally see this tasting even better with taco meat.  Also, that precooked bbq beef from Lloyd's might work as well. 

The only problem I had was with the biscuit dough.  Perhaps my muffin pan is jumbo-sized, but I couldn't get one biscuit to reach the top of the pan.  I'll try Grands next time, as using two regular biscuits is too much. 

I thought these were great as leftovers, but my girlfriend didn't like the way the dough tasted after sitting in the fridge.  I'm sure I'll make these again.

Really good and super easy to throw together quickly. The kids can help squish the biscuit dough to fit the muffin pans so they are a part of the preparation of supper.

I've been making these since I was a kid.  I'm 37 now and I still enjoy them once in a while.  They are quick and easy....and very easy to change according to what you have in your pantry.  I've used regular biscuits and the grand biscuits.  Different cheeses, different bbq sauces all depending on what I had around.  I've also used sloppy joe mix.  I always add onions to the meat mixture and then dice a little for the tops of the cups.

Tried it at a family gtg and everyone loved them. My only problem was not paying enough attention to use a jumbo muffin pan with the size of biscuits I used. My daughter called them 'meat cupcakes'!

This was awesome.  I have a 2 1/2 year old and a 6 year old.  They really enjoyed smashing the biscuits!  They were also very tastey!  Will make again!

These were gone in a matter of seconds!  I've never served an appetizer before that received this many rave reviews.  My grandmother said she rather eat all of these up than a main course.

Pretty good for something so simple! Hubby hates sandwiches for lunch so I'm always trying to find things that will survive in his lunchbox on a construction site and that he'll like. This works! Thanks for the recipe!

Not quite sure what all the hype is about.  This really didn't do it for me.  It tasted exactly like what it was...ground beef covered in bbq sauce in a biscuit.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I probably won't make it again.  I can see how kids may like it...similar to Sloppy Joes.  Nothing special.

We call these "Meat Muffins" and I can't make them fast enough! My boyfriend loves them for lunch - he heats them up in the microwave- Now his co-workers ask for them too! - I usually spice the meat up with hot peppers :)

This was suprisingly tasty and simple.  Will make again!  Another good idea is  to use the taco seasonings as others have suggested, except use tortilla shells instead.

What a great idea! 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce wasn't quite enough so I ended up using about a cup. I only had refrigerated cresent roll dough so I broke it into piece and formed it to fit the muffin cups. Still came out very nicely. I will make these again, perhaps using ground turkey to save on fat and calories. Other reviewers mentioned making them mexican style, I think that would be great too. Taco seasoning instead of BBQ sauce, a few sliced olives and a little green onion on top of the meat, jack cheese instead of cheddar. I've even seen refrigerated corn biscuits in the store that could be used. I can't wait to make them again.

Very good and tasty. They remind me of sloppy joes but neater to eat and great for a picnic. My husband thought they were a little dry with the biscuit. Will make again.

Made the other night for dinner and the whole family loved them.  Used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and they tasted fine -- even microwaved well the next day.  I will use a little more sauce next time -- seemed a little dry after baking.

These are easy to make and delicious. I used the regular biscuit size first and thought it was enough biscuit. When I tried the Grands another time, I thought it was too much bread and not enough meat! 

Have made it for friends and they enjoyed it. For a lower-fat recipe, I used ground turkey and reduced-fat biscuits, much lower in fat and tasted the same, which was great!

Made these for myself and two kids for lunch today. We all think that this recipe was ok but next time we will try it different, mixing the meat with taco seasoning instead of bbq and still baking them with cheese in the oven, then topping with a little sourcream or salsa. Was great fun to make with the kids though...

I give it 5 stars for ease and 3 stars on taste.  My daughter ate them up, but my husband wasn't as impressed. I might make this again for my 3 year old, if I'm in a big hurry to get something on the table.

I wasn't too impressed.  The BBQ taste was very overwhelming.  It's one of those meals to make when you're in a quick rush and need to use up some leftover ground beef but not something I'll make reguarly.

YUMMY! I didn't have enough BBQ sauce, so I added some ketchup and a little brown sugar (and no one knew the difference! :). These were delicious! Leftovers were just as good the next day too. Definitely a family-friendly recipe...kids can easily help by putting the biscuits in the muffin pan or putting in the filling.

My 4 kids love this recipe. To save time, instead of using the muffin tins, I press the biscuits into a cake pan and make what my 11 year old calls "BBQ beef cake". It's a huge timesaver and still tastes just as great!!

Quick & easy and a great concept. However I found the beef a bit dry and it seemed to be missing something. I experimented with the last 2 biscuits: I flattened them out and spooned the beef along with cheese in the middle and then closed it shut and it was more most.

My honey gave this three stars but I had to give it four just for the ease of making it. The flavor was good. I also had trouble with the bisquit mix not staying at the top of the muffin tin. I was afraid when I took them out that he wouldn't eat them due to way they looked. (unlike anything I ever made before) So I was happy when he reached for the second one. 
By the way I used a extra large muffin tin and made them dinner sized.

I really liked this recipe, it was quick and delicious! I will add bacon bits next time I make this, and use beef low in fat, to reduce some of the greasiness. Yummy!

Quick and easy, had all the ingredients here! My husband loved the BBQ, my kids aren't BBQ fans so I mixed up a little cheese and hamburger and baked "cheeseburger cups" which was a fun alternative. Definately loved the idea, and will explore with other ingredients also, thanks!

This was a great recipe after a little altering.  I used a pound of 99% fat free ground turkey and increased the BBQ sauce from 1/2 cup to 1 1/4 cup, added a splash of Worcestershire sauce and a dash of garlic salt.  I felt that this created a more flavorful meat mixture and it turned out VERY tasty and not too overdone at all.  Had I used lean ground beef it may not have needed as much extra flavoring, but it works either way.

Easy to make, simple shoppping list, and yummy!  Freezes well, microwaves well, and more filling than you'd think (without being heavy).  Great recipe.

Mmmmm we loved these!!  I only altered the recipe slightly by using fresh, diced onion instead of dried onion.  I also added some garlic (along with the onion) and some seasoned salt and pepper to the beef mixture.  Unfortunately, we didn't find that the addition of the cheese added a lot of flavour, so next time I think we will use processed cheese slices (1/4 slice per cup).

This is really easy and delicious. I've made them with various ingredients. I often put the meat and cheese in layers for a more cheesy taste throughout. I tried eggs and sausage, which was good, but will have to try it with the gravy on it as someone suggested. Just thinking about it makes me want to go make some. The great thing is that you can put most anything you like in the cups.

These were pretty good. Definitely easy to make, but I wasn't sold on the barbecue sauce/biscuit flavor combination. I'm not sure I would make these again.

What a great idea!  My family loves barbecued beef on buns, but this was a wonderful variation.  I added a few dashes of hot sauce, as I would to my barbecued beef anyway.  I will definitely make this again and again!

I made the breakfast version of these cups using eggs, bacon, and cheese. They were so darn good! And they reheat so well in the toaster oven! I also used crescent rolls instead of biscuit dough, as I think someone else suggested, which made it very easy to fit into the muffin pan. I will definitely make these again and try the beef too.

I made these with spaghetti sauce and mozzarella cheese instead of BBQ.  I thought they were good - a lot like a pizza cup.  Surprisingly, my boyfriend's 13 year old son didn't like them, but he is the World's Pickiest Eater. I will make these again!

These are a neat idea and were good but I think I would like them better with something besides BBQ sauce.  I'll make them again though and try different things!

I made this for our family and only my picky four year old thought it was interesting, but after eating one decided he no longer wanted any.  I ended up having to make something else.  Even my two year old who eats anything and everything didn't like it.  I used buttermilk biscuits.

This recipe was a Pillsbury Bakeoff winner back in the 70's, I think.  I've been making it for years.  My kids loved it and the grandkids love it.  It really is easy and a winner!

What a fun recipe.  This is a great football dish for the husband.  I will give this another try, tweaking it to my families likes since we thought the amount of BBQ sauce was too much and it took 30 minutes of baking & not the recommended 12. I also made some Asian Coconut Rice from this site (YUCK!) BUT I mixed it in with the left over meat mixture & it made a sloppy joe alternative that was pretty good!

This may not be gourmet, but it's excellent! My picky husband, 4 year old and everyone else who's tasted these love them. And it is so easy to fix, it's almost criminal. Great for snacks, game day or dinner.

This recipe was a great idea, that is a fun finger food, and easy for children to eat.  I added a lot of spices (chilli powder, taco seasoning, garlic, onion, & Emerills hot sauce) to the ground beef, and it was delicious.  I also used cupcake papers (sprayed w/cooking spray or will stick) and it made it easier to handle.

I added a few things to this to keep it from being bland. I threw in some frozen veggies, the finely chopped kind, some minced garlic and extra BBQ sauce. I also found that using a biscuit mix works just as well as the refrigerated dough. Add some oven roasted potatos and you have yourself a full meal in no time!

Have put this in the "make again" stack of recipes.

I thought these were okay. My husband took one bite and wouldn't eat them. My daughter on the other hand seemed to enjoy them. She also enjoyed helping make them. I probably won't make them again though.

I decided to go the mexican route with this one and they turned out great. I prepared ground turkey as I would for tacos, adding fresh onion and a can of green chiles. I used flakey biscuits and peeled away the layers to place in the muffin tin. Once out of the oven, I topped with a bit of sour cream. Wonderful recipe idea and thanks!

Very simple to prepare. Made this for lunch and my husband went nuts for them. This is just a little simple comfort food. My biscuit dough did not go to the top of the muffin pan but it didn't matter. They baked up nicely.

My family thought this was only okay.  I added fresh onions and garlic. However it was still bland.  I think the recipe has great potential, I plan to play around with it again and use taco meat.

We thought them only so-so.  I used the larger Grands biscuits as was recommended by another reviewer, but then found it difficult to add enough meat.  If we make them again I would try the smaller biscuits in order to have enough meat filling.

My fiance' doesn't like BBQ sauce so I added a little worcestershire/water(water for moisture) instead for a different flavor.  Also chopped 1/2 fresh onion and added tiny pieces of pork to brown with beef.  Might put bellpepper in it next time.  YUM!

This wasn't a bad recipe, it's just not my thing. It took more time than I wanted to fashion the cups and then I thought it was a tiny bit on the bland side. If my family had liked them a bit better, I would have tried doctoring the recipe.

It's a good recipe for what it's supposed to be...basic, easy, etc.  I eliminated the onions because I don't like them, but we like it otherwise.  My fiance can even make them, and he's a horrible cook!

Easy & tasty- a great combination! I used manwich instead of bbq sauce and it turned out great. I didn't have any problem with the biscuits- they flattened out and fit in the muffin tins perfectly. (I used one Pillsbury grands and one store brand grands.) Everyone loved them.

I didn't like this recipe, although the beef itself was very tasty. My kids & hubby loved it though, it was right up their chili-cheese-hot-dog-eating alley lol

My family voted this a definite two thumbs up!  On busy weeknights, I often make sloppy joes--we all thought this was a great (and just as easy) alternative.  As other reviewers said, I just used canned Manwich.  We'll have this again!

This was quick and easy and the kids ate it without a problem, even the picky 13yr old.  I also used sloppy joe mix and extra cheese on top.  I was able to use regular size biscuits and just flatten with my hands and they fit perfectly into the muffin tin.  I will definately make this again, maybe trying a spoonfull of mashed potatoes underneath the meat.

Made these for the first time and got rave reviews from both of my men (a 5 year old and a 32 year old).  My husband even ate them cold from the fridge the next day.  I did add more barbeque sauce than the recipe called for.  The mixture just looked a little dry to me.  I served them with corn and a salad. Definately a quick and easy (and tastey!) recipe for a weeknight dinner.

Added a diced onion, and 1 clove of minced garlic to the hamburger when frying.  Rolled out one biscuit at a time, put in muffin tin and filled right away and had no problems.  Very good starter recipe.  Kids want chili in them next time.   Thanks

Can you say AWESOME!!  These were so quick and easy and not to mention my picky eater even loved them!  I used J.P.'s Big Daddy Bisquits from this site rather than store bought, they turned out great. They even taste great the next day! mmm mmm
