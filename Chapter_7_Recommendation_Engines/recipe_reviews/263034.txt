Awful!! They looked great baking but the taste was absolutely horrible! I've only been doing Keto for 2 months and remember well what REAL bread tastes like and this is not even in the same ball field.

Something is totally wrong with this recipe.  The dough was liquid. Tried to add almond flor but no better.  A similar recipe whisked  the egg whites but not this one...

I made these, recipe looks just like the photo you have here. However, the inside of the roll, while it "appeared" to be completely cooked thru, still had a moist mouth-feel. I returned them to the oven and cooked an additional 20 minutes, then after I turned off the oven I left them in the oven to continue to dry out for another 10 minutes. No help at all. The inside is a wet, dough-y texture and, while the flavor of the crust is good, I can't get past the inside texture. I might try again, making the rolls about half the original size. But as is, this recipe is a complete fail.
