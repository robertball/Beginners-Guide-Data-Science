excellent recipe.  I made it with dark chocolate as the first dip and the white chocolate as second drizzle.  Big success.

I made this with colored white chocolate for Easter.  I made it two ways. The second used Baileys Irish Cream coffee creamer for the kids.  Drawback. Not a strong Baileys alcohol flavor. The ball was very soft and sticky. When dropping in chocolate the cookies tend to get soft fast and fall apart.  I put hot chocolate in separate bowl which helped a lot    Itâ€™s a great tasting Cheesecake ball.  I would use a few more cookies or less Liquid to firm up the ball a bit   I used food processor

Awesome!  I used fudge striped cookies, dipped in chocolate, then drizzled with the white.  I made these as part of my holiday goodie give-away, but I don't think they will make it into the bags!  Just might keep them all to myself!

easy and a crowd pleaser.  one concern, mine almost did not make it to the party....they were in danger of being eaten first!
