I just made this and it's excellent!!  I used how ever many tomatillos I had from my garden (they're smaller than you'd usually get from the grocery store) and it tastes awesome!  Especially love this because I didn't have to skin the tomatillos and peppers (a big pain in the butt for some of the smaller ones that I had).  I also added the juice from one lime; I like the subtle citrus that it adds to guac and salsas.

I changed it a little,, added two slices of red onion diced small and two TBLSP. Lime Juice.  I don't like avocados but this is very good.

This recipe is most improved by roasting the tomatillos and jalapenos in the oven for about 20 mins. at 400 degree, until they're a little toasted. You can easily peel off any burned parts by quickly placing them in a plastic bag to steam the skins a little. This method brings out more flavor than boiling.

I made exactly as per the recipe (except I used fresh minced garlic) and wow, this is very YUMMY! Used as both a condiment on my carne asada tacos and to dip my tortilla chips in. This one will be in my recipe box forever! Delicious!

I doubled all ingredients and flavored to our liking we absolutely loved it and got compliments on it. So easy although I agree that making it in batches makes for less of a mess.

Fantastic dip!  So easy to make.  Followed advice and used 1/3 bunch of cilantro.  The recipe makes a lot, but it's so good you need a lot.  I'm making more tonight!

Roasted instead of boiled.  Added no water at all.  Came out very well after avocados were added.

So delicious!! I will definitely make it again! I stuck exactly to the recipe and wouldn’t add lime juice, because it already has a tangy taste to it! Perfect as is

everyone loved this.  I will add more peppers next time though since it was pretty mild after cooking the peppers.

I made it exactly as listed and it was very good. Next time I will remove the seeds from one of the jalapeños as it was a bit too spicy for some of my guests. They loved the flavor it added to my asada tacos but the heat was tad too much for them.
