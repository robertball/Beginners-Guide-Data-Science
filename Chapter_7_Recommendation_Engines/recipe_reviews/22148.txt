I threw in some chopped cabbage and a little garlic  too and of course, the kids needed ABC noodles. V-8 juice is a necessity for this, in my opinion. Thanks for sharing.

This is such a great soup. Basic and easy to add any spices or flavorings your heart desires. I seasoned my ground beef with Montreal Steak Seasoning. Thank you for this very comforting soup.

This was a great basic recipe.  I made some small changes and the soup turned out very well.  I switched to Spicy V8 juice and added a cup of cheap red wine. I also added a teaspoon of chopped garlic while browning the meat, two small bay leaves, and a sprinkling of powdered sage & cayenne pepper.

THE BEST VEGETABLE SOUP I EVER HAD...AND ALSO THE FIRST HOMEMADE SOUP I HAVE EVER MADE. VERY EASY AND DELICOUS. I USED V-8 JUICE TO KEEP CALORIES AND FAT DOWN AND IT WAS AWESOME BUT ADDED A CUP OF WATER AS IT WAS JUST A BIT TO STRONG FOR ME. GOING TO MAKE IT AGAIN MINUS THE GROUND BEEF FOR A LITTLE MORE HEALTH CONSCIENCE SOUP...MY SON ATE POTATOES AND CARROTS IN THE SOUP FOR THE FIRST TIME...ENJOY

The only thing I changed on the recipe is that I used V-8 spicy cocktail juice for a tiny bit extra zip.  This soup is wonderful!  My husband loved it!

I'm sorry to say, I was disappointed by this one.  It was too bland so I ended up doctoring it up at the last minute.

quick and easy recipe.   I used left over beef rib roast instead of ground beef and added 1/2 can beef broth and used clamato brand vegetable juice added a little salt and lots of black pepper.  It was very good.
