I submitted this, and sometimes changes occur during editing. Following are the directions and footnote as submitted. Either way they're delicious, if I do say so myself! DIRECTIONS: Place eggs in pot of cold water. Bring to a boil; boil ten minutes. Remove pot from heat, place in sink, and run cold water in the pot until eggs are cool enough to handle. Crack, peel, rinse off any shell pieces, and dry thoroughly! Slice in half lengthwise, collect the yolks in a medium mixing bowl, and set aside the whites. With a fork, mash yolks until finely crumbled; stir in sugar, salt, onion powder, garlic powder, and pepper. Blend in vinegar, mustard, mayonnaise, and salad dressing one at a time, stirring until smooth. Set aside. Set the whites up on a serving plate or tray, drying each one thoroughly again with a paper towel as you do. Spoon enough yolk mixture into each white to mound slightly above the cavity. If desired, sprinkle with paprika. FOOTNOTES: The older the eggs are the easier they are to peel, so the closer they are to the expiration date, the better.  And yes, BOIL the eggs; they're called hardboiled eggs for a reason! That green stuff never hurt anyone, and actually a drier egg yolk is a good thing when making deviled eggs.

I don't make deviled eggs very often and generally don't follow a recipe when I do.  However, I thought I'd give this one a shot.  The idea of sweet deviled eggs intrigued me.  The submitter's directions are spot on for boiling hard boiled eggs--it's how I generally boil mine as well.  For anyone who needs any tips on eggs, her advice is wonderful.  I must say I'm a bigger fan of savory deviled eggs, but these were a nice change.  I like the cider vinegar and will just cut out the sugar next time--but that's a matter of taste, I think.  Bf didn't tell me whether or not he liked them, but he finished them all off, so he must've enjoyed them too.  Thank you for the recipe!

Thought I will try this for a change.  Mistake! Sorry, just too sweet.  For the first time since I have been making deviled eggs, there were some left.  Won't be saving this recipe.

I actually turned this recipe into an egg salad after I systematically ruined each hardcooked egg while removing the shell. The egg salad rocked!

I made these and they were excellent. 

I must say, I far prefer the eggs. They took about as long to make and taste wayyyy better. :)

I made this recipe with only minor changes, as I knew I prefer savory to sweet when it comes to eggs, I omitted the sugar and added 2 Tbsp of Dill Relish. Was irritated to discover I was out of yellow mustard, so had to use ground mustard (spice), added a heavy dash of worcester sauce. Was a big hit, first eggs to disappear off the table :)

Very good basic recipe. I loved the use of the powdered seasonings, which eliminated the need for chopping onion and garlic. I added the amount of dressing to the point that it was the consistency that I like.

I made this deviled eggs today for a change and the really are way too sweet!  I love any deviled egg...should I say loved any deviled egg until I made these, could not eat them.  My husband didn't like them either.  We tried to take some of the sweet out but with no luck. If you like a sweet egg you will love these.  I would suggest cutting down on the amount of sugar though...it is sugar overload!!! Will be deleting this recipe but understand it does say "sweet" in the description I just had no Idea how Sweet!!!!!
