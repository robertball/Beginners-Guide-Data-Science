I would definitely make these potatoes again! Absolutely delicious. I did leave out the orange and basil because I didn't have them on hand. I microwaved the potatoes instead of steaming. I also added paprika and chile flakes.

I left out the optional orange sauce and also left the skins on the potatoes but other than that I made as written. These were a little heavy on the basil for me but other than that I have no complaints. I did have trouble with the potatoes sticking in the final cooking process but that might have been due to me leaving the skins on. I think you could easily speed up the process by nuking the potatoes in the microwave for 6 minutes or so instead of steaming. All in all good flavor and one I will make again with a little less basil.
