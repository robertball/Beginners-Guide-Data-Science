The cooking time was way too much. I should have followed my gut instead of the instructions, as after the 10 minutes that it calls for (5 before beer, 5 after), my shrimp were overcooked and rubbery. Also, the instructions don't say when to add the red pepper flakes. It should have been with the black pepper, but I didn't notice until the end and then it was too late for the flavor to really meld. In general, not flavorful enough and I ended up adding old bay. Disappointing for me, but at least guests had high praise.

The cooking time was too long. I refuse to overcook shrimp so I stopped when the shrimp was done but "sauce" was super watery and nothing stuck to the shrimp. I removed the shrimp and I am going to boil the sauce down on its own and pour it over the shrimp.

I would definitely make this again.  My husband and I both loved it.  I added more ginger and more garlic, and I followed folks suggestions to add the shrmp later.  They came out perfectly cooked.  I served it over egg noodles.

Relatively good but lacked some flavor. I ended up squeezing lemon over a few to try and that seemed to help. I thought the cook time on the shrimp would be too long also, (so I cooked them less) then finished in the sauce.

Very spicy, but good.  I served as a stir fry with rice and broccoli.  I toned it down a lot, using less than ½ tsp. red pepper flakes and even that was a little more than I could handle on the spice front.  I can’t even image using a full tablespoon!  I think it would make is so hot that it would completely ruin the dish.  I agree with others that this is too long of a cook time for the shrimp.  I removed it from the skillet when it was almost cooked, finished the sauce, and then returned to the pan to finish cooking.

Very spicy!! I only added 1 tsp of red pepper flakes and next time I’ll do half. I listened to the other reviews and made the sauce first and added shrimp last. We served it over brown rice and enjoyed it!

I followed the recipe exactly, with exception of the sesame oil.  I did throw some toasted sesame seeds in for good measure. I added the red pepper in the final mixture. The flavor was awesome!  It was spicy, but we are all good with that in my family.  I highly recommend this, and will make it again.

Excellent. Got hungry and wanted a quick midnight snack.  Used  minced garlic and sliced ginger from jars....  Used froze shrimp so cook time was perfect. Realized half-way through that one of my kids had home-grocery-shopped my ketchup so I used Asian chill sauce instead. :( Was spicy and sweet so I left out the pepper flakes. Used only 3/4 tbsp sugar Should've left out more. I ate it as a snack by itself. Reminds me of Szechuan garlic shrimp. Delicious! Will serve over basmati rice next time!

I loved the flavor and it was really good cold.  I did make the sauce first and then added the shrimp to keep them from over cooking.  I will definitely make this again

I did make some changes .  The cooking time stated was too long, also I mixed sriracha 1/2 and 1/2 with the ketchup. I also squeezed lime on the dish when I finished and served it with slices of lime. This was a great hit at our cocktail party.

This was delicious!  Like others I only sauteed the shrimp for a minute before adding the ketchup and beer, then cooked for the five minutes.  Otherwise followed the recipe as written.  Shrimp were perfect.  Loved the sesame oil.  Served over Jasmine rice.  Spicy, perfect heat.  My husband loved it.  Will definitely make again.

Fantastic! I omitted the red pepper flakes and halved the pepper just cause we don't do super spicy but this was a hit with my entire family!!! I also doubled the garlic and ginger but we love both! Super easy and very very quick to make. 
Appreciate the recipe ..

So yummy! Halved the recipe. Didn't have ginger root so used same measurement of ground ginger. Cooked shrimp with onion/garlic only 1m before adding beer mixture. Didn't use sesame oil either. Everyone enjoyed.

The recipe didn’t say when to add the red pepper so I added it with the beer and the ketchup. A tablespoon was too hot for us but I didn’t know that when I incorporated it. We tried cutting the heat with honey but I think next time I might add pineapple chunks.  We served it over linguine but next time I want to use true drunken noodles. Don’t use the cooking time. Use the color. My shrimp came out nice and tender that way. We will do this again.

I used high quality frozen shrimp and the cooking time was perfect.  The sauce was a bit thinner and required more cornstarch.  As a family that likes heat, we did not find this spicy but it did have good flavor and a slight kick.  Served with rice and a salad.  Next time I'll use chili pepper sauce instead of ketchup.  Nice dinner!

I modified the recipe to include lots of vegetables and because we don’t love garlic I reduced the amount of garlic. Great recipe.

Very tasty! It's worth the time! I made some minors adjustments. I used an infused oil instead of canola oil; lessened the amount of garlic for health reasons; I did not add the sesame oil. I also used pre-cooked shrimp that I had on hand. It still came out great! My family loves it! It's a new family fave!

Bland, but still spicy... so really just heat. I'm glad I tried it, but I doubt we'll make it again.

Pretty tasty and easy to make. I would rate it a 3 but the hubby loved it. I think it has a strong ketchup flavor but then again he loves ketchup! The cook time is definitely too long and I used extra large shrimp. I added the shrimp when I put the beer and such in and they were cooked to perfection.

Super easy to make. We used red onions and we topped with chopped pepperoncinis and toasted sesame seeds . We'll make this again.

Thought this came out awesome. It was the perfect mix of shrimp and flavor. I used Coors Light as the beer and would be willing to try something heavier or with more flavor next time. The sauce wasn't as thick as I thought it should be so I added some more cornstarch. Definitely a must try if you like shrimp

Amazing recipe. Only suggestion is to cut way back on the red pepper unless you like extremely spicy food. I will only use a pinch next time. And the recipe doesn't tell you when to add the red pepper. I suggest adding it early on so it cooks a little bit.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I made on the fly changes. Since I don't eat onions, I added a bit more garlic. I also never use ketchup and substitute it with various barbecue sauces, depending on my guests (kids versus adults) I choose Sweet Baby Rays or Stubbs for sweet, spicy or smokey flavors.

Delicious recipe! Since ketchup has a lot of sugar already, I didn't add any additional. I also threw the shrimp in last (after stirring in corn starch slurry) and they were tender. I'd make this spicy dish again.

I followed the recipe as written,except that I did not have toasted sesame oil.  So I put some toasted sesame seeds in some canola oil and attempted to make the toasted sesame oil.  I poured the oil and only some of those sesame seeds into the dish.  I loved this dish and wished I had made more than 3 servings.  The sauce was delicious and had a great spicy flavor.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

This recipe is simple and tasty. Remember to add red peppers same time as salt/pepper. It can be runny depending on how long you simmer before adding shrimp, but the sauce is great on rice.

Interestingly delicious. In a multi flavor kind of way. Followed recipe and directions perfectly. Served with coconut jasmine rice. Appreciated how quick it was to make. Wouldn't serve to folks who don't like highly flavourful, relatively spicy or "non traditional" dishes. Had an exotic flavor and nice texture. Maybe not a main or primary dish, but a lovely quick side dish.

Loved this recipe! Used cooked shrimp so I didn't put the shrimp into the sauce until everything was nearly completed... Also doubled the chili flakes because we like our meal spicy. Worked out really well, will definitely use this recipe again.

Really good. I didn't cook the shrimp quite as long. I didn't have the red pepper flakes, so I substituted Asian chili sauce for the heat. Maybe a little less next time. My guests really enjoyed them, too!

This was quick and easy to make, and it smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but that's where it ended.  All we could taste was spice, we didn't get any of the other flavors, and were really diappointed we couldn't get the beer flavor.  Definitely will not make again.

Awesome and easy recipe!!!  Made some alterations based on what I had in the house.  I didn't have ginger root so I used crystallized ginger honey tea.  It comes in a small packet and looks like sea salt.  I used Blue Moon since I like the taste of it and I think that definitely helped flavor it in an enjoyable way.  I didn't have any corn starch so I used flour instead.  I didn't find that it thickened up very much but I didn't mind at all.  The sauce was DELICIOUS and soupy.  I served it over brown rice with burnt broccoli.

Really enjoyed this recipe! I was looking for something to spice up the shrimp which is usually very bland tasting. My Mother-in Law loved beer...she would have loved this dish. Good served over rice or angel hair pasta.

Great recipe.  Easy to make and very tasty. I did add cayenne and jalapenos to the onions for more flavor.  And like another review, I doubled the catsup - liked the flavor.  I'm not a beer drinker so used Blue Moon beer which gave it a nice mellow flavor.  I made it tonight and will definitely be making it again.

Really, really good! In my opinion though, this is only enough for 5 people.
