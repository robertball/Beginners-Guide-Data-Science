I've had problems with runny dough, but have solved that problem and love the result! Salt your zucchini and let it sit in a colander for 15 minutes or so--you'll have much better luck.

We also had an issue with runny dough, so we just added more flour (1/3 cup was far from enough). We used teh zucchini, 3 real eggs, salt, oregano, and basil, but we used pizza sauce, pepperoni, and a small can of mushrooms instead. Put the crust in the oven for 10 minutes and cooked the pizza for about 20 minutes. It turned out great honestly, but definitely need to heat it by itself in the oven longer and less with the toppings.

This was fabulous! I took the suggestions of others to heart and salted/drained the zucchini before combining with three eggs. I seasoned the egg/zucchini mixture with basil, salt, and pepper before baking and ended up needing about 2/3c flour. The crust set well in about 10 minutes and I put a thin layer of seasoned tomato sauce on under the toppings to help keep the firm texture. To prevent "tomato puddles" from the fresh toppings, microwave the thin tomato slices on a plate between two layers of paper towels for 30 seconds before putting on the pizza. The end product was excellent and came out of the pan easily.

Tasty, but don't expect your typical chewy pizza crust, of course!  A bit quiche-like.  May try with one less egg?  Best first night.  Made with several colored bell peppers, sliced tomato, onion, provolone, mozzerella, parmesan (fresh) & herbs.

I loved this dish! I baked it in a 9x13 rather than the pizza pan. I had only one problem: the tomatoes juiced out during cooking and created a small juice pond I had to sop up. It was definitely the tomatoes, as the dough was set after the precook time. Next time I will try sun-dried instead of fresh.

After you salt/drain the zucchini squeeze the extra water out of it. I also used a little more flour and pizza sauce instead of tomatoes. I also sauteed the mushroom and onions first and added hot italian sausage for some spice.

This turned out like a quiche.  I had to cook the crust for much longer than it was stated to cook it for, and it still did not solidify.  Good idea, but needs a lot of tweaking to make it work!

I've been making this recipe for years!!  Even the non-veggie family love this recipe.  It's a wonderful recipe and you can vary the toppings.

my hubby loved it!  I give it 4 stars because I wasn't as thrilled.  When browsing reviews I couldn't figure out how someone could describe a pizza as "quiche-like" but after baking mine, I found out why.  It is soft and quichey, tastes like a thin quiche!  didn't have Feta, used mozzarella, added sliced green & red peppers

Instead of using homemade dough, I recommend buying dough that is already semi-cooked, because for whatever reason the vegetables prevent heat from completely penetrating the raw dough, and it takes much longer to cook.  
It's a great meal that can be done in advance and stored in the fridge until cook time.

This recipe is fantastic for pizza lovers! I make sure to drain the zucchini before so the crust isn't mushy. I have found this works for any pizza toppings you want. I just used a little bit of tomato sauce to keep the crust from getting mushy.

It was like an omelet with pizza toppings on it. I was expecting more of a pizza crust, but it was still good.

It turned out well AFTER I changed the amount of flour, very runny before that.

I followed the directions for the crust but not toppings. I salted my zucchini & let drain like other reviews stated. This was my first time making a zucchini pizza crust & it was great, it crisped up really well for me. However I didn't time the baking really. I pre-baked before adding the toppings so that the crust was cooked 1/2 way. I used whole wheat flour instead of AP (personal pref) and did add a little more. I topped it with shredded chicken, fresh spinach, chopped tomatoes, artichokes, chopped olives, red onion and goat cheese. I really loved this guilt free pizza!!

yummm, yummm. Let the zucchini drain in a colander with salt for about 15 min, then pat dry with paper towel.  Otherwise the dough will be gooey.  I didn't do this the first time and it was still delicious.
