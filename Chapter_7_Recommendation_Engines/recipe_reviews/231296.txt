This recipe contains a great marinade for chicken!  We love grilled pineapple, too, so it was win/win.  This is a great salad.  My only change was to grill the chicken and pineapple separately, to assure the correct amount of doneness.  I will place this recipe in 3 places in my RB, because I don't want to forget about it.  It will go in the poultry folder, the salad folder, AND the sauce and marinade folder!  Thanks for the idea.

I was skeptical about trying this since there were only 3 reviews, but it was delicious!  I used dried rosemary instead of fresh, and accidentally measured too much, and it was still fine.  Didn't have pine nuts, so substituted sunflowers seeds because it definitely needed something crunchy.  Amazing combination of flavors and textures.   Use fresh pineapple.

OMG...this is the first time I have been moved to review. Absolutely one of the best salads Ive had. The marinade was fabulous!  Only thing I changed was to cut back on the oranges...the pineapple gave it more than enough sweetness and the pine nuts gave it that crunch without being overwhelming

This was a delicious salad. Made as written except I toasted the pine nuts. The grilled pineapple was superb with the marinaded chicken. Served it on a bed of spring mix and used poppy seed dressing. Other light dressings or vinegars could be substituted. Thanks for a great recipe.
