It was a wonderful combination of flavors, but a little sweet for me. I am thinking of cutting way down on the brown sugar, changing the clove to cinnamon and adding a Granny Smith apple cut up to the pot.

Wonderful way to make pork.  The Insta Pot helps make the meat very tender and the cranberry/orange flavoring is a great combination.  I might consider thickening the sauce (topping) some and perhaps adding some sugar or another sweetener.

This pork came out so delicious...  my whole family said it was the best ever..  I did not use cranberries, but I used mandarin oranges instead and added them after the meat was done.

Excellent and very simple recipe! Only substitute I made was to use 2 tablespoons of maple syrup instead of the brown sugar. Delicious!
