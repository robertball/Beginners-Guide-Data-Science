Very nice! Here is idea you might also try. Put the barley on a sheet pan and toast lightly in oven at 350 degrees for about 5 mins or longer depending on your oven. It really brings the barley flavor out!

The flavor of this soup was really good.  However, in the future I will follow the instructions on the barley bag and pre-soak it.  After simmering the soup for 1 hour, I found the barley wasn't cooked enough.  I continued to simmer for another 30 minutes and the barley was fine, but some of the stock had boiled down at that point.

Just great!  SO very easy - it actually lives up to its name!  We like ours a bit thicker than this has come out at the end of cooking, but I plan on cooking a little longer w/the lid off (we live in CO - it's all about evaporation!) to get it to thicken a bit.  Otherwise, might toss a bit in a blender and add it back in to thicken it up that way.  **MAKE SURE YOU ARE USING PEARLED BARLEY OR SOAK YOURS ACCORDING TO PACKAGE DIRECTIONS if it's not - barley that is not pearled will take forever to cook otherwise (it looks like this got left out of the ingredient info).

This was so easy to make and it turned out pretty well.I made a few additions that I think really helped boost the flavor: I added extra garlic, and onions, and some red wine as I was cooking the mushrooms. Oh, I also used beef broth instead of chicken. The wine really gave the soup great depth.

Delicious! Took another reviewer's advice and used a full cup of barley. You can always add some water when you reheat the soup if it's too thick. This would be good with some chicken added to it as well... Will make again for sure.

I make this same soup, but with double the amount of garlic and 3 cups chicken and 3 cups beef broth (reduced fat/sodium). I also add 1 tsp each of dried thyme, marjoram, and parsley and 2 Tb. white cooking wine. It's still easy and much tastier.

I followed the directions exactly and loved the soup! This is a great basic recipe to experiment with - next time I will double or triple the carrots and celery to get more of a vegetable soup. A bay leaf would also be good.

While I prefer things to have a bit more flavor (I did add some garlic salt, red/black pepper blend) my husband absolutely LOVED this - said it was his favorite thing I've ever made!! He likes simple flavors, healthy foods - not big on caseroles, foods that have to be slaved over. He went back for 2 more "small" bowls (he pointed out :) - and kept asking - "...and barley is good for you, right?" I buy fresh organic spinach in bulk, so threw that in the bottom of our bowls without even cooking it -the broth wilted the spinach on its own - great for adding more nutrients. Thanks for the submission!

A very good soup. I didn't have barley so I used orzo and it was a nice touch.

Easy to make but I desired more flavor. I used a full cup of diced carrots and added poultry seasoning to taste because I wasn't sure what seasoning(s) would go best with mushrooms and chicken broth. This is mushroom soup and it indeed did taste like mushrooms but I found it flat in flavor without the seasoning, DH enjoyed it which was great because I made it for him. I would like to make this again with vegetable stock which I think I'd prefer over chicken broth. All in all a good recipe but for me I need the flavor punched up a little more.

I doubled the recipe; otherwise, made it verbatim.  Great basic soup, I liked it a lot; make it as written with confidence.  I have some changes in mind and will update this later.

I made this recipe as written... wonderful! Then I made it with smoked turkey stock and added fresh thyme! I could sell this on a street corner for $$$. It had to be the best Mushroom Barley soup I have ever tasted!.

The amount of oil to saut√© the veggies seemed high to me, so I reduced it by 75%, using only 1 tbsp which worked fine.  This one small change really had to cut back on the fat grams in this soup making it much healthier.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe to the letter and found the soup very flavorful.  After seasoning with salt and pepper, I did add a little thyme.  Nice soup and will be making again.

The recipe was easy to make and delicious.  The only change I will make is to add more celery and carrots in the next batch.  It also freezes and reheats really well.

I really liked this soup. I used baby portabello mushrooms & next time I will cut them a little smaller. It's not a hugely flavorful soup but it was good with some fresh bakery bread.

Wow, had this last night, it was awesome. Made it the night before for the following nights dinner when I would be running late. Really didnt measure anything just chopped up the veggies, used two boxes of broth (think that may have been 8 cups) and a cup of barley (like it thick). As per another review chopped up some store bought roasted chicken and added it at the end. My barley was pearled (also read in the reviews) and I cooked for probably an hour and a half. The flavor was great, the soup had body and texture and was warm and filling on a cold winter night. Served with a small crusty french bread this was an easy and delicious meal. This will be a keeper in our house. Thanks!

This was really good but the leftovers were even better! Make a day ahead, you won't be disappointed! I added a bay leaf for flavour and next time will experiment a bit more. Rosemary? Garlic?

Made this for my vegetarian grandson so used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Wonderful soup.. Think next time will follow others suggestions and use a full cup of barley.

I have made this before with barley and it was OK, but caused some tummy problems, so tonight I made it with brown rice: no tummy problems and it was quite good.  I doubled the garlic, used vegetable stock to keep it vegetarian, and added a bit of lime juice at the table.  Very nice and filling.

Delicious! I used Trader Joe's vegetable broth (which is the only veggie broth I've found that tastes good, instead of being too carroty or tomatoey), as we are vegan for the Lenten Fast, and it was divine. I'm sure it is even better with chicken broth. I would make this any time.

Very good base recipe.  I will be making this again.  I doubled the mushrooms and used a blend of baby bellas, white mushrooms, crimini and shitake.  I also used a full cup of barley and increased the broth.  I used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 chicken stock (thats what I had on hand).  Also added thyme.

EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT SOUP! Made just as written, except for adding in some extra garlic. I can't believe the wonderful flavors that came from this~YUM! It did take 1 hour for my barley to be fully cooked, but that was no big deal. this soup is definately going into my regular rotation! Thanks for sharing. :)

I fixed this recipe according to the recipe and then tweaked it a little when it was almost done. First, if you like veggies, add more carrots, celery and onion. Next time i will triple or double it. I added more garlic too. When i tasted it the first time, it was a little flat so i added about 1/2 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp basil, 1 tsp oregano, and 3 drops of Tabasco. If you really love mushrooms, you could totally add more. I used baby portabellos which were really nice. Overall, this is a good recipe. I enjoyed it!

This was excellent! I thought the barley was still too firm at 50 minutes - allow a little more time if you like it tender. Great flavor though, thanks for this recipe!

I followed recipe very closely except I used the wonderful  Roasted-vegetable stock on this site and a quick cooking barley.  This is a great soup . I will freeze servings and let you know if it is not great each time I prepare one.

Thank you for the recipe! I modified to make 8 servings instead of six and for salt added teaspoon  - which oversalted.  As another reviewer noted (I read it too late) there's salt in chicken broth cubes I used for stock.  Also agree, with another reviewer - next time will put in more carrots and touch of chicken meat if possible.  And yes, I soaked barley while chopping.  It took close to 2-2.5 hrs total at leisurely pace.

Very easy and very good. I replaced 1/4 cup broth (I used veg) with sherry, and I added fresh thyme. A nice, hearty soup with lots of flavor!

Thanks for an easy, economical & very healthy recipe. We loved it. The only change I made was to sub the celery for an orange bell pepper (only because I had it & was out of celery). I was able to throw it together very quickly & everyone liked it. Thanks!

A very nice soup. I used quick-cooking barley, so I only simmered it for about 30 minutes. It did need a little more flavor, so I added some dried parsley and thyme.

Great soup. I used 1 cup of barley and 4 cloves chopped garlic. The mushroom/chicken broth is delicious. You can cut some  of the fat and calories by reducing the olive oil to about a teaspoon. A quarter cup seemed to be too much. One of my favorites from AR's.

This made a very nice soup and we enjoyed it, but I think for just 2 people, next time I will halve the recipe since it make more than six servings in my opinion and we did get tired of it after 2 meals (it really thickens up after being refrigerated!)

Great soup and so easy! I used 10 minute barley, low sodium chicken broth. I make a similar version with beef, so I know it would be good with beef broth - See "beef barley vegetable soup" on this site.

This soup is DELICIOUS! It's also very low calorie, and the barley makes it ideal for those with cholesterol concerns. I used a little more garlic (always use more garlic!) and I included some shittake and cremini mushrooms along with the buttons.

This is "souper"-delicious!  I used 2 TBSP. of garlic and 16 oz. sliced baby bella mushrooms.  I doubled the rest of the recipe.  I did not add salt as the broth/stock is salty enough.  I used pearl barley and did not have to soak it ahead of time - we like our barley to be "al dente" so 50 min. was plenty.  Also - as another reviewer suggested - I toasted the barley at 350F first although I had it in the oven for about 8 min. - at 5 min. it hadn't gotten to the point where it had that toasted aroma and look yet.

This recipe is wonderful- simple and delicious. Instead of chicken broth I used mushroom soup mix dissolved in water. I never got such high praise from my husband, a huge mushroom barley soup fan.

Good basic soup, open to alot of adjustments, more mushrooms, more barely.
I like another reviewer upped the barely to a full cup.  Also, from a whole foods eating perspective barely should be soaked 6-12 hours before cooking.  The provides two great benefits. One, releases more of the nutrients and two reduces the cooking time significatly.  I am also experimenting with the level of salt.  I think it needs more salt, but I am proceeding with caution as I do not want to overwhelm the favors already dancing around in this wonderfully simple and delicious soup

Yummy recipe, but I changed a few things. I used pearled barley, 4 cups chicken broth, 2 cups beef broth, added a can of mixed veggies (i didnt have as many mushrooms to put in), and I added 2 bay leaves to the soup. Turned out great. Hoping it will freeze well.

Fantastic soup! Only thing I added was 2 bay leaves while simmering and about 3 tablespoons of red wine. A good chicken stock will make all the difference in flavor for this soup! This recipe is a keeper!

i gave this a four star rating because i changed a few minor things. i used beef stock because it was what i had on hand. i also added some parsley, thyme and italian seasoning for added flavor. this came out absolutely delicious and not a drop was left! everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe. i am going to stick with the beef stock instead of chicken since we all liked it so much! next time i am going to cut up and brown sirloin steak( i stock up when albertsons runs them on sale)with the veggies for the meat lovers but i don't think it is a must add in.thanks sand1149 for a great recipe that can be tweaked to your taste!

I really good soup although I was expecting a bit more flavor.  I used veggie stock instead of chicken and upped the barley to 1 cup.  I also added two bay leaves and about a teaspoon of fresh thyme to add some depth.  Hearty vegetarian meal served with bread for dipping.

Excellent. I used one cup of quick barley toasted briefly under the broiler and also added a bit of thyme to the soup. Utilizing the quick grain shortens simmering time considerably! :-)

Excellent and easy soup!  We added extra barley which then required more chicken broth.  The pearl barley does the trick...no soaking and it was ready in the hour of simmering.  We threw in some shredded rotisserie chicken to get it used up.  I didnt' have any celery in the house so I substituted with celery salt and cut back on the regular salt.  Will be a definite addition to my soup making rotation!

Super easy and quick!  I love mushroom and barley soups, and was looking for something I could whip up for lunch.  I only made two changes to the recipe.  1) I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian.  2) I added 2 bay leaves when I brought it to a boil.  Delicious!

So yummy! Great as is as well as zested up a bit. I like to cook it with a bay leaf or two, minced hot pepper, and at the end I garnish with cilantro and a splash on V8 juice. My boyfriend likes it plain so I just do it to my bowl. YUM Yum yyyyyyuuummmm!

This is the easiest recipe to make and it's a perfect combination of veggies and barley. Just like mum used to make!  I added ~ 4 cups additional broth because I like my soups with more liquid and it was perfect! Highly recommended!!!!

I loved this! I did double up the spices and use thyme. We had a lot of turkey left over from the holidays. So I added about 12oz and it was perfect.

Made on top the stove with fresh spinach. Didn‚Äôt have spicy Italian sausage so I added a pinch or two of red pepper flakes while frying. We loved it!

I didn't  soak the barley, and by mistake left the soup on the stove at low heat when I went out to a lecture. It cooked for about 3 hours and was absolutely delicious!

Boyfriend and I loved this hearty soup. Followed reviewer advice and pre-toasted the barley. Also added 1/4 tsp each of thyme and parsley and threw in some shredded roasted chicken. Definitely will make again. Enjoy!

Great recipe and very easy to prepare.  I didn't change a thing. I made this for my Dad who is on a renal diet (low sodium) and it was delicious!  I am making another pot for my family this week.

I added more onion, carrots and celery, but that is all.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I will definitely make it again.  Oh, and I just realized as I was reading other reviews, how anyone could call it bland, but I used portabella mushrooms instead of white b/c that is what I had.

I followed the recipe exactly. I truly LOVED it! Since I made too much, I put some in individual containers and froze them, thawed one at a time overnight in the fridge, took it to work the next day, microwaved it for my lunch. Lunch was very tasty, but since the barley soaked up more broth, it was much thicker. Thick or not... WOW what flavor, Who needs meat when there are mushrooms in the world?!

Great recipe! I made this tonight as it is cold and snowing. It is perfect for this weather. I used 8 oz of white mushrooms and 8 oz of baby portabellas (cause that's what I had).  I did up the carrots to 1 cup and same with the celery (I'm not good at figuring out how much I'll need and chopped away) and upped the garlic to 1 tablespoon (I love garlic!).  No problem.  Unfortunately I also upped the barley (I used Medium Barley and simmered for 50 min) to 1 cup which made it more like a thick stew.  But the taste was great after adding salt and pepper to my taste.  Next time I'll keep the barley to 3/4 cup.   After a few bites I added 2 pinches of dried thyme to see how it changed it and it really did, I'm not saying good or bad but it was different.  Thank you for a great recipe!

This soup is truly easy and very very delicious.  Followed the original recipe but added a diced sweet potato and as reviewers already said, added red wine. The wine really added to the depths of the soup and we all really enjoyed it.  I cook many soups from all recipes but this is a true favorite!!!!

Hints: cut any fresh veggies approx. the same size. Added per suggestion of others: QUICK cooking Barley [20 min and done]; 1/2c wine, extra spices like margaram, parsley, chicken bullion, extra jarred minced garlic.I added fresh veggies: diced carrots, green and yellow onions, green pepper, as well as diced sweet potatoes. In addition I still added the frozen veggies [corn,pea,green & lima bean mixture] asked for. Added extra chicken broth to lessen the thickness.  Added also diced smoked ham. Dear husband loved it. looking forward to the leftovers!

A star off for not including prep for the barley. That said this time I bought a package of "ten minute" barley. Love this soup. I always make sure to add in a bit of spice to it

This was much quicker than other recipes I saw and didn't require dried mushrooms. I added about a tablespoon of dried dill weed and a couple of diced potatoes, and it came out great.

I am tempted to make this a 5 star but I save that for way above average with changes it may be that. I halved oil I used 6 cups water and 2 Tbs. chicken better than boullion as I otherwise would always be out of stock. a lemon juice squeezed into soup and when ate I sprinkled n some salsa seasoning  I did not buy enough mushrooms - my fault. Othersie I used amounts called for- Yummo

I am making my second batch of this excellent soup as I type this.  Easy to make and freezes very well.  While good as it stands, it certainly lends itself to additions-next time I'll add some lamb to the mix.

A wonderful, easy soup!  It was even easier because I used quick barley.  It's perfect for lunch or dinner on a cold winter day.  We paired it with a grilled sanwich, yum!

Absolutely delish !  The only thing I did differently was to brown a pound of lean ground beef along with the olive oil, onion, carrots, celery and garlic.  I then continued the recipe from there.  The addition of the ground beef made it a truly hardy meal.  Served with come crusty french bread and yum !!  My husband loved this soup and I will be making this again over the winter months.

This was very good.  I was looking for a way to use some of the leftover turkey from Thanksgiving Day and this sounded really good.   We used all of the celery on Thanksgiving day so I substituted 1 scant teaspoon of celery seed.  Followed the recipe except that I chopped baby bellas into quarters or eighths, depending on the size, used 4 cups of chicken stock (all I had left) and 2 cups of water with chicken granules (very salty so don't add any salt if using these) and added leftover turkey.  The fragrance was awesome and the dish was absolutely delicious.  I may have some for breakfast!  Thanks for the recipe sand1149!

I altered a bit: I used soup bones, peppercorns and bay leaves to make my beef broth. Mushroom and barley go better w/beef flavor...Then i used same ingredients except I pre cooked the barley. When i serve, I use a dollop of sour creme or creme fresh for each bowl...Everyone loves it...Thanks for the recipe.

Very good soup!  I did have to modify to suit my pantry.   I used a combo of beef broth, red wine and water for the liquid and felt it needed an extra can of broth later.  Also used canned mushrooms and a handful of spinach.  I imagine its even better with fresh mushrooms!

I made this recipe with vegetable boullion rather than chicken broth and served it with a fresh, crusty demi baguette to sop up the delicious flavors and even my boyfriend (who is very picky about food, particularly "health food") LOVED it.   It was a bit time consuming having to wait for the barley to reach optimal tenderness, but well worth the wait.  Filling, delicious -- best soup I have ever made.

I was surprised at how good this came out! Actually better than any other mushroom/barley soup I've made!

This soup was suprisingly delicious.  I used a combination of baby portabella and white button mushrooms. I couldn't beleive how easy the recipie was.

Thank you, this is remarkable, and all in one pot!  Made this today on a true winter's day - snow flying everywhere . . . the family wolfed it down (added bonus:  the house smells amazing!)  Unfortunately, there are no leftovers, so next time I'll double the recipe.  I added some fresh dill the last 20 minutes, and also threw in some leftover meatloaf (chopped into bite-sized pieces).  This is definitely a keeper!  Thanks again.

I am always looking for simple and tasty soups to have in winter.  This fits the bill. I used various shrooms and extra carrot, onion & celery to finish them up.  Very good!

Great flavor and very to make.  No need to add salt.  I would not use a whole cup of barley as some readers have suggested.  There almost isn't enough broth as is-this is a soup, not a stew. Perhaps the type of barley used is the issue.  I use Quaker Medium Pearled Barley.

I think the recipe had potential.  I made it as instructed.  Some flavors in the soup clashed.  Definitely did not like the carrots.  Will have to make some adjustments.

I made some changes:
I used beef broth instead of chicken, upped the barley to 1 cup, upped the amount of veggies, peeled, diced up and added a parsnip and a rutabaga for extra flavor (I love root veggies in winter), added herbes de Provence and tarragon to the salt and pepper

Made it exactly as the recipe called for/  Added about a half teaspoon of salt and it was perfect.  I used a mix of sliced cremini and ordinary white mushrooms.  I think it was actually better the next day after being in the fridge overnight.  The stock seemed to thicken, probably a result of the barley soaking in the soup.  Definitely will become a staple inner household.

I made this tonight and it was delicious. I used half chicken broth and half beef broth. I also used a rib steak I had in the freezer, cubed and browned it and added to the pot. Thats the only changes I made. After the barley had swelled I added another can of chicken of chicken broth because I like it to be a little soupy. I‚Äôll definitely make this again.

Easy and very tasty.  I added some dried shitake mushrooms, dash of thyme and a bay leaf.  Also substituted the chicken broth with a veggie broth to keep it vegetarian and used 1 cup pearl barley soaked for quicker cooking.  Used my Instant Pot pressure cooker.  Sauteed, then soup setting for 25 minutes, cooldown 10 minutes then vented and removed cover.  Perfect!

We followed the recipe and added some chicken and bullion to give it more chicken flavor and some protein. We underseasoned it initially and suggest you not skimp on salt and pepper.  You need to really like mushrooms if you follow the recipe.  Next time we will season it more and halve the mushrooms, there will still be plenty.

I agree with previous review, added extra garlic, and onions, and some red wine as I was cooking the mushrooms. Oh, I also used beef broth instead of chicken. The wine really gave the soup great depth, and definitely use pearled barley!

This soup was so tasty and if I hadn't been an idiot, it would have turned out perfect.  I put in way too much barley because honestly I couldn't even see it when I put in a cup.  After it cooled, it became a solid block.  Yeah, I'm not the most patient cook.
I did get to eat some of it before and it was wonderful.  I used a mix of button and crimini mushrooms and about double the garlic.  Very yummy.  But don't add too much barley no matter how much you want to.

Wonderful soup!  Took another reviewer's advice and roasted the barley prior to tossing into pot with the rest of the veggies and broth.  Decreased oil to 2 TBLS &  added a few teaspoons of dried herbs such as basil, savory & thyme.  Perfect with a dash of salt and pepper added after cooking up.  This recipe is very easy to spruce up with extra veggies and/or barley so don't be afraid to vary it.  The barley will add thickness to the soup, especially after cooking for an hour and setting up overnight.  Even my finicky family members enjoyed this.

Outstanding.  I need to find low carb / low cholesterol recipes that don't have foods I'm allergic to and have foods I like.  This for the bill beautifully!  I doubled the recipe (because I hate cooking and try to always have leftovers after feeding the masses) and cooked some ground chicken to add to it (1 pound per recipe).  I also added a couple dashes of ginger and a couple bay leaves because I know I like those things in chicken broth based soups.  Everyone loved it and I'm happy to have a recipe that my Dr approves of that I actually enjoy eating!.

This turned out great! I omitted the carrots because I didn‚Äôt have any, added a 14.5 oz can of low sodium white beans and used a no salt vegetable broth. I will make it again.

I used "Instant Barley" so I added the barley with only 15 minutes left to simmer. It turned out great. I'm definitely keeping this on my "short" list.

All I did was  up the barley to 1 cup and added some cornstarch to thicken it at the end.  Wonderful taste! Used up all the veggies I had.  What could be better?

Absolutely delicious!! I made a double batch of this and couldn't stop eating it for days. I even froze a container of the leftovers. I hope it reheats well. 

So simple, but so very very yummy.

I used this recipe as a base and went crazy... I added I didn't have enough onions so I added Leek and scallions, I also added Shitake and oyster mushrooms and my own homemade stock  and diced potatoes.  It really came out hearty.

So I did make changes because I was using it as a base for a soup that I was trying to recreate from many years ago, the mushroom barley soup served in NY delis. To do this I read the reviews & added the 2 bay leaves , 1 tsp each thyme & marjoram, dash worstershire. I upped the celery & carrot & added a parsnip since I had on hand.  Then I added a few squats of the  concentrated tomato paste in the tube plus I took a 1 oz. container of Dried mushrooms which I simmered in water to cover @ the beginning of the soup making process. After about 3/4 hr I turned it off & let it sit for a while longer. Added to the soup ingredients upon starting to cook the soup. These mushrooms take a while to cook..Actually turned out better than I remembered.

This is now one of my favorite soups! I love mushrooms, but tire of the same old cream of mushroom soups. I used vegetable broth, one full cup of barley, and added 1/4 cup dry white wine and 1/4 tsp parsley. Next time, I will add more garlic, more parsley, and extra pepper while cooking.

I made it exactly as written.  I used hull-less barley which seemed to cook within the designated cooking time.  The name of the soup is mushroom barley yet there were many more mushrooms than there was barley.  I  think the barley should probably be doubled.  I also was surprised that there was more onion than there was celery or carrot.  I would give it a 5 for being easy to make and having a low calorie count.

I added cubed chicken breast into the soup to cook.  I also only had 8 oz. mushrooms and it was still very good.  I put in more carrots and just a little more barely to compensate.  Next time I would like to try it with beef broth---especially if making it without meat.

Great base recipe for newer cooks looking to branch out from making soups into making stews. Turned out very thick so I'd consider reducing the amount of mushroom used to 400g next time, and you definitely don't need that much olive oil. I added some coriander, black pepper, rosemary and thyme and am glad of it now as it may have been a bit bland otherwise.

Really, really enjoyed this soup and my uncle raved about it! Used all beef broth since I think mushrooms go better with it and I also omitted the celery.Also took some suggestions from some other reviewers and used less oil, added some red wine and used a full cup of barley. Reheated well also and was super easy to make. Will definitely become a staple in my house.

I made this with pearl barley and my own chicken stock and added some dried and fresh herbs.  I honestly did not measure the carrots etc but did approximate per the recipe.  I gave some away to friends that were in need of comforting (both had a parent pass away within a day of each other) and I had plenty for myself.  It was very good and I got thanked by both friends who said it was wonderful.  Im going to make it again with hulled barley and again, use my own gelled chicken stock (from pastured local chicken bones).  So it takes me actually days to make soup, but most of that time Im doing other things (soaking barley and making the stock in a crockpot) Im bringing a batch with me next week on a visit with friends in their vacation home in the Poconos.  I gave them options and was told mushroom barley is their fav.  Im seeing reviews saying its bland but it is very comforting ~ probably moreso with homemade stock ~ and it's easy to add a little flavor with small amount of herbs.  I think I used dried thyme and at the end, added fresh parsley.

Gave it 3 stars.  We ate a little & then added some red wine like others had suggested & it became a 4 star.  Will make again with red wine now. It is nice not having meat all the time, nice change. I also used quick barley which was mentioned also.  You don't need to cook as long & I did use the same amount of barley which I wasn't sure about doing at first. You can always add more carrots, celery & mushrooms per your preference.

It was okay. Isaac liked it better than me.  I doubled the garlic and added 1 tsp each of dried thyme, marjoram, and parsley and 2 Tb. white cooking wine per another reviewer's suggestion. It was still pretty bland. I ended up adding  a bunch more salt, pepper, and a harris teeter hand-grind signature spice blend to liven it up.  Turned out okay but wouldn't make it again.

Made this soup as I was coming off a bad 10-day viral infection with not much in the house and therefore made with only the 3 basic ingredients, i.e. mushrooms, barley and chicken broth.  It was beyond easy and fabulous.  Will be making this often during these winter months and will try it with the rest of the ingredients next time, though I'm unsure how it can be improved on.

I will make this again and my vegetarian son loved it!  I did add a little red pepper flakes, sirarcha sauce, cumin and smokey BBQ sauce for extra heat and flavor - but it was delicious and yummy before I added anything else.  At the suggestion of one of the other home cooks, I added some baby spinach right at the end for color (and a nutritional boost)!

Our family really enjoyed this. I did use a full cup of barley, as suggested by another reviewer.  I added a splash or two of red wine, which I think enhanced the mushroom flavor.  Thanks for a simple, very tasty soup recipe!

Used half crimini half white mushrooms - next time would use all criminal and cook until browned. Used chicken, beef, and veggie broths. Added 1 tsp poultry seasoning (use less next time). Used Trader Joe's quick-cook barley which took 30+ minutes and then added 1 cup more broth.   Froze. Maybe add crumbled, browned sausage?

This was really good soup base. You can modify this or add to the recipe.  I did add 1 c. barley  (after I soaked it for an hour.)and made homemade turkey (mini) meatballs to make it more hearty.  I also added more seasonings and bouillon  . I will also make this again with vegetable  broth for my vegan son.    I love any kind of barley soup and this was a healthier way to go.

This is really good and really simple. Used vegetable bouillon instead of chicken broth, and skipped the celery. Rich flavors, good textures, and again, easy.

What can I say, this soup is AMAZING! I followed some reviews hints. I made my own chicken stock - so easy! And along with throwing some chicken in there, I added a small can of  button mushrooms, a handful of small egg noodles and some parsley for taste. It's great the first day.. but holy cow! The second day is better. This is a keeper. Thank you for posting it.

Loved the soup but agreed that it needed a little  tweaking.  1) I reduced the oil to 1/8 cup. 2) I used vegetable broth instead of chicken, 3) toasted the barley in the oven at 350 for 5-6 minutes. 4) added approx 1/2-1tsp dried oregano for added flavor.   Delicious!  Saved to my recipe box!

This is the first good soup I've ever made in my 57 years, so thank you for posting it!  The only changes I made were I saut√©ed baby spinach with the onions and I slow simmered for 4 hours.  My husband and I loved it!

WOW, this turned out so good that I had to review it even though I changed so many things. First I only had 8 oz of mushrooms (baby portabellas) so I doubled the celery and onion & added a small chopped sweet potato just to have enough veggies in there. Then, per other reviewers' suggestions I added a lot more garlic (3 tsp total) and 2 Tbsp of red wine into the broth. Also per another reviewer, I toasted the (pearl) barley for 5 min at 350 to give it more flavor. I also used Knorr vegetable bullion cubes to make my broth. Boy, is this soup ever good!!! A great vegetarian accompanyment for potato pancakes.

4 out of 5 people in my family loved this recipe, including a picky husband who didn't think he liked barley! I also didn't add the mushrooms (my personal preference). My son didn't care for the (drained) can of black beans I added, but everyone else really liked it. Will definitely print this recipe and make it again! :)

I made this soup according to the recipe minus the celery because I am allergic and found it to be very bland and not as thick as I like. Not sure if it was the lack of celery but very disappointing. :(

Ours turned out great! I added a full cup of barley and definitely soaked it over night, worked like a charm! I also added cooked chicken and used the crockpot instead to slow simmer all day. In the last 30 minutes, I mixed up some dumplings, plopped them on and tilted crockpot lid! Was excellent!

Great, easy and tasty. I use shitake mushrooms and leeks instead of onions. I thin it a bit at the end with red wine. It becomes a gourmet company dish and I get raves. Thanks, Sandi149!

Made recipe as stated, except that I reduced the amount of oil, as other reviewers suggested.  Soup was fairly easy to make, but I felt that it badly needed some seasoning.

Perhaps beef broth would be better to use for this recipe than chicken broth?

This soup is simply amazing! So easy to make, and so delicious. I agree with the other reviewers: you must soak your barley before hand. about 8 hours. Or else it will take forever to cook through. The only other changes was that I used beef broth, and a cup of barley. SO AMAZING!! YUM!

I made this with 1 c. of barley because I like it thicker.  I used beef broth because that is what I had on hand.  Like one of the other reviewers suggested I added some red wine with the mushrooms.  It was very easy to make. I really enjoyed the soup, my husband not so much.

Very good recipe and simple to make.  I would reduce the olive oil by at least half next time I make it.  I didn't even add salt, there was enough in the chicken broth. You don't need exact measurements either...more or lesss carrot, celery, etc. Next time I might add some spinach since I"ve seen many recipes with that ingredient included. It was excellent and I've served it to many people so far. They all love it.

Yum! I followed the recipe as exactly as possible, using Pacific broth and pearl barley. I thought I might miss the beef, but I didn't at all. This is a hearty, healthy soup that would be great with a salad.

Awesome recipe! Didn't have any onions so I used dried one's and it still came out fantastic.  Cheap, easy and healthy.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious! I added some extra vegetables and used a combination of white mushrooms and chopped portobello. Even my kids couldn't get enough.

Very good but I added fresh dill parsley and thyme it took the recipe to a higher level. I also blended 3/4 of my vegetables after they simmered and before I added the barley for a thick consistency

I liked this. Reason I gave only 3 stars is cos compared to other soups I make, i can only eat a little bit of it. Just can't eat that many mushrooms! Soup itself is lovely.

I followed the recipe first and found it to be somewhat bland. Pretty much just chicken broth or chicken soup flavor. I tried doctoring it up but quickly learned it tasted best before tinkering. Just a tip, if you think the soup is decent upon first try, you may want to leave it as is. This soup was okay, but I won't be making it recipe again.

This recipe is very simple. I used sliced portobella mushrooms and added a sprinkle of red pepper flakes for a little kick. Excellent!

I only used half the liquid and it wa still a very thin soup.  The taste was okay.
