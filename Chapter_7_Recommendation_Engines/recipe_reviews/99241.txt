Yum Oh! A great alternative to a tuna sandwich. I did change it a bit. I used Veri Veri Teriyaki which is thick with a great flavor not too strong. I also added about 2T of  Wasabi paste. I thought this went better with tuna than Tabasco or Mexican hot sauce. The bread crumbs I used were Italian. VERY GOOD- WILL MAKE AGAIN!

I tried these on the grill and they came out great! Plump and juicy, with no fishy taste.  I even topped them with cheese, and they still tasted  very much like regular burgers, so they'd be perfect if you're trying to cut out red meat or lower cholesterol. I used the thick, sweet teriyaki sauce instead of the watery "and marinade" type, and I think that made all the difference as far as saltiness, but it's still a good idea to start out with less and add more to taste.

I wouldn't say this tastes anything like real beef but it did turn out really good. I did add the entire egg which held the patty together really well. I also didn't add teriyaki sauce at all, instead I added some sweet pickle relish, garlic powder, black pepper and lots of dill. Before I pan-fried them I coated them with bread crumbs so they were nice and crispy. I agree with another user that these would be great served on salad.

This was pretty good.  I love tuna and can eat it everyday so I like to find different ways to make it. I will make this again but I will cut back on the teriyaki sauce a little bit.  Although I like teriyaki sauce, I thought it was a little overpowering for my taste.

After reading the reviews, I chose to use a teriyaki sauce that was thicker and only used 1/4c of it with a doubled recipe. These make a great cheaper and tasty alternative to turkey burgers.

This was pretty good. I was looking for something more interesting to do with some tuna I had gotten on sale and saw this recipe. I didn't have any teriyaki sauce so I substituted equal parts of barbecue sauce, soy sauce and worcestershire sauce to equal 1/4 of a cup. I also accidentally added the yolk of the egg, but I'm not worried about cholesterol or calories so I figured it couldn't hurt.
It turned out pretty well, although I had trouble keeping it all in one piece in the pan, and had to keep squishing it back together. It was soft and moist, not dry, but had a similar texture to my mom's salmon patties, only better. It tasted nothing like beef but I don't mind at all.

This was a waste of good tuna. I followed the recipe exactly and it was too dry, too salty, but otherwise tasted like cardboard.  Sorry!

My kids (ages 5 and 18 months) liked this, and it's a cheap, easy meal so I'm sure I'll make it again! I was so skeptical that I actually made backup mac & cheese which I didn't wind up needing. I think next time I'll try more tuna and less breadcrumbs. I used Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs because that's what I had, but I think plain would have worked better with the teriyaki flavor. This is a also good recipe to sneak good-for-you stuff into, like flaxseed & wheat germ.

This is a wonderful way to eat canned tuna! I made it for dinner last night and my family enjoyed it very much! However I didn't add  as much Teriyaki sauce as the recipe called for, if I had im sure it would have been too much. Just use your better judement with the sauce. This recipe is definetly worth a try! :)

I doubled the recipe, but halved the teriyaki GLAZE (thicker) as others suggested.  I also reduced the breadcrumb amount.  It just seemed like too much filler.  'Thought I'd be eating teriyaki breadcrumbs instead of tuna.  Well, with half the teriyaki amount, it was pretty bland & not very tuna-like either.  I also didn't add the egg.  I did put them on a toasted bun & with cheese & a little asian garlic chile sauce.  That made it good, much better;  but not great.  I might make again, but I wouldn't count on it.  They would taste more beefy with more teriyaki/seasonings - like turkey burgers do.

Excellent Burger!  I never would have thought of putting teriyaki sauce with tuna, but it works.  Great alternative to plain ol' tuna sandwiches.

This saved me when all I had was a can of tuna and an empty coin purse!!  I'd say use half the teriyaki, but delicious.

I had my husband rate this cause it turns out the teriyaki sauce is pretty strong (could have been the brand we used). I don't like terayaki but he does, and said they were a four, only because he has had better. Superfast to make, and all stuff that you always have on hand. I would give them a five for prep.

Made a lot of changes, so many maybe I should make a new recipe.  Instead of burgers, I made meatballs for my toddlers.  I was out of teriyaki sauce, so I used hoisin sauce.  I left out the hot pepper (again, toddlers).  I also used canned salmon instead of tuna.  Finally, I was out of ordinary bread crumbs, so I used panko.  The result was fabulous!  Too up the vietnamese factor, I will probably add some cilantro and a bit of thai basil to the mix.  When our kids are old enough and more used to hot spice, I'll add sriracha for the hot sauce.

I made these for my family and they were very good. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that they were very salty.  I used a whole egg instead of just the egg white.  I will make again but with a low sodium teriyaki sauce.

Excellent!  I was looking for something beyond the typical tuna casserole or cheesy tuna mac (which both are good) for the tuna stash I've been accumulating.  I topped these with some melted cheese.  Instant favorite.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

Use a hint of lime and lemon when mixing... It adds a little zing to the flavor.

This was ok. I used steak sauce instead of teriaki. My kids liked it. I too am a lacto-ovo vegetarian, but we don't count seafood as meat, so this is a great way to use tuna. I also used about a 1-2 tsp. of cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce. The only thing is that you have to start out with a really thick patty to end up with a well cooked burger. I did a lot of flippin' and smashin' to make sure it was not mushy on the inside, all in all, a good recipes!

Chris, this is so yummy! thanks for the awesome recipe! I forgot to add the hot pepper sauce, but that's OK because my super-picky 4 yr old loved it. 
Even my husband, who hates anything to do with fish, said "these are actually really good!" So I make a batch of 5, then cook them and chill them for lunch sandwiches. I'll share this recipe with everyone I know.

The flavor was amazing.  I made the mistake my deviating from the recipe.  I thought it would taste good to add finely diced onions, it didn't work it made them fall apart.  I also used solid white albacore tuna instead of chunk tuna (both packed in water).  I think the chunk tuna would have worked better as it has a finer texture and would have stuck together.  

Since this was a bare refrigerator recipe I used tortillas so it didn't matter so much that fell apart.

I also added chopped onions and lettuce inside the wrapped.  I will definitely try again.  I will not be detered.  

If I trey the onions again I will try the method used in the vegetarian black bean burgers.

This was a VERY tasty recipe! We can't have hot pepper sauce so I substituted about 1/4 cup fine chopped onion and a little powdered ginger. I also used the whole egg for a bit higher protien. I did use about half the recommended teriyaki sauce and fresh crumbled whole wheat bread, (about a piece and a half), to one can white albacore tuna.

Since we are trying to cut back on red meat and poultry, I tried these as a burger substitute.  Although I did not feel they were like a hamburger, I did really enjoy them and they turned out great.  I didn't use as much teriyaki as others suggested and I will make them again.  My kids liked them on a bun, I enjoyed it by itself, however, my husband was not a fan.

will add Worcestershire sauce net time, the teryaki flavour was too clear four our liking, but there was definitely no tuna taste. I was told to make them again by meat- loving husband.

These were great - not fishy at all and extremely filling.  I did cut the teriyaki sauce by half and subbed Mrs. Dash Garlic and Herb marinade for the other half, only because I am trying to limit my sodium intake.  Topped it with a teeny amount of cheese, ketchup and mustard and thought these were every bit as good as a hamburger!  Thanks for the recipe!

Really good! My husband loves tuna burgers, so he was a happy camper. I thought they were yummy too. I used a few teaspoons of soy sauce in place of the teriyaki and added a little toasted sesame oil. Thanks! :)

These were very good, although a little salty.  I didn't have teriyaki sauce so I made my own with soy, brown sugar, ginger and garlic.  I think because of this the soy that I chose made it salty. Although it was a low sodium soy sauce, soy itself is salty.  It tasted NOTHING like a beef burger as the creator claimed so if that's what your looking for I wouldn't go with this recipe.  I didn't mind though since I'm not a big beef burger eater anyway.  My husband and I both loved these, but my kids (7 and 5) didn't eat much of it (although they never said they didn't like it).

Not much like a real burger but delicious just the same.  Served on hamburger buns with lettuce tomato and red onion just like a burger.  I did up the hot sauce a bit and only used half the teriyaki sauce, mixing it with a little soy sauce since my husband is anti-sweet as well as substituting panko bread crumbs to make it a little healthier.

Very good, also used BBQ sauce and worchestershire sauce instead of teriyaki. I knew off the bat this would be too salty and overwhelming with teriyaki for our taste. Will put chopped onions in it next time. Very good and low in fat!

These were good!  Only change I made, per another user's instructions, were that I did not have teriyaki sauce on hand, so I used the same measurement of mostly BBQ sauce, and added some Worcestershire and soy sauce to equal the measurement.  My family liked them...my husband said they were good, and he would eat them again, but he still preferred a hamburger. :)

This recipe was not to my liking. I'm shocked so many people liked it - there was WAY too much teriyaki flavoring and my husband couldn't even stomach it.  Maybe other people have more of a salty palate, but not for us.

Way too salty because of the teriaky sauce.  Also they were to soft and bready for me.  I didnt like the texture or the overpowerful flavor of the salty sauce.

I doubled the recipe with the exception of the teriyaki sauce, and having to add a 3rd egg to bind the patty better. I only added 1/4 c of teriyaki sauce and it was OVERPOWERING! I would only add maybe 3 tablespoons if I decided to try it again.

I used wasabi insted of hot sauce like some reviewers dhad suggested and, though I generally love wasabi, found the flavor a litle bit overwhelming.  Outside of that they had great texture and were supr easy to make.

I used the whole egg and panko bread crumbs. I also baked in the oven at 400F for 15 minutes, flipping half way through. Very quick and a nice change of pace for tuna. Great with an Asian sweet chili sauce for dipping!

This is a great recipe!  I didn't expect it to taste anything like a burger but it really did!  I used italian flavored bread crumbs and added a little bit of Worsterschire sauce.  I had to use two egg whites because it was too dry and I used Pam instead of the oil.  A great low fat meal.

This was a great lunch. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it was a bit on the salty side...next time I'll look for low sodium teriyaki sauce. The nice part of this recipe was that it was quick, easy, and I had all the ingredients in my cupboard. Very good.

Pretty good! Did not taste like tuna at all, that was great for me because I don't really like tuna mixed with mayo. It was a bit salty, I didn't have teriyaki so I used soy. Next time I will make it with less soy sauce.

I was looking for a cheap easy and differnt use of tuna and this caught my eye.  The only difference was the use of Safflower oil instead of veg. oil.  These are quite tasty, but be very careful of how much teriyaki sauce you use. It can become overwhelming. I would definitely try this again with a bit less sauce and maybe some onion chunks to give it a bit more texture. My husband and daughter LOVED them.

This was really good and so low in fat and calories.  I made if for my red meat loving finace and he liked it also.  I did change a few things however.  I don't care for teriyaki so instead I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and some non-fat Italian salad dressing.  I put about a tablespoon of stone-ground mustard in it to give it that tang of the hot sauce that I didn't think I would like.  Very, very tasty!  I think I prefer these to beef!

These didn't turn out well at all.  Neither one of my kids would do more than take a bite and taste it, in spite of trying to smother the taste in cheese and mayo and anything else that would make it edible.  The mixture was too wet, which was weird because I added even more bread crumbs than the recipe called for when I saw how it would not stick together to make patties.  And our favorite teriyaki sauce, even though I used less like other reviewers suggested, just didn't combine well with the flavor of the tuna.  A waste of ingredients, especially when my daughter turned around and asked if she could just have a regular tuna salad sandwich instead.

I made these this evening.  I doubled most of the ingredients b/c I was afraid two wouldn't be enough.  My husband and I both enjoyed them a lot.  The time suggested on each side of the tuna is perfect.  The hot sauce gives it a kick, but not too spicy.  I will make these again!

Sorry Mack but I was not a fan of these burgers. They were too salty and seemed mushy even after being cooked throughly. I think this recipe has potential so I may experiment with the recipe to see if possibly baking them or something like that could help the recipe at all. By the way the baby (15 months) liked them a lot. She gobbled them up. It was a less messy way of getting her to eat tuna (tuna salad is such a mess with her). Thanks for the recipe, sorry for the bad review.
