Made as written and husband loved it. I think it could use a little more seasoning but he said it was perfect as is. I recommend letting it sit overnight to give the different flavors enough time to get acquainted.

This recipe can simply not be any better! Been trying to find a recipe as good as the local place in town, this surpasses it. Big hit!

This is a delicious recipe! Smoked trout has a more delicate flavor than smoked salmon so you don't want to overpower it with a lot of seasonings. This one is perfect! It does need to sit overnight.

After reading it was a bit think I went heavier on the sour cream, lemon juice and worcheshire sauce.  I used hot sauce instead of cayenne.  I beat all soft ingredients with a hand mixer before incorporating the trout and the onion.  I was pleased with the consistency.  I also used two green onions instead of one and garnished with chives.  I think these changes improved on the recipe based on prior reviews.  I will make it again, next time with smoked paprika instead of regular.

This fish dip delicious and so easy to make. Although I mixed all of the ingredients before I added the fish. This allowed for bigger pieces of fish.

Very good smoked trout dip. It's a bit of a process though if you plan to smoke your own trout. I imagine this would work well with smoked salmon as well. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Delicious! I made this yesterday so that it could sit overnight as the other reviewers suggested. It tasted fantastic even before I stuck it in the fridge. Thank you for posting this recipe!
