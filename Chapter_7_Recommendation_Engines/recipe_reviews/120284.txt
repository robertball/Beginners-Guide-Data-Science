My husband rated this 5-stars & raved about it during dinner. I had salami that needed to be used, so I added about 1-1/2 cups to the mix, along with some Italian seasoning and garlic powder. Sprinkled parmesan cheese over the top. I didn't use the butter--I just broiled one side before spreading the mixture on the other side. Quick and delicious!

I would have given this 5 stars, but I was a little put off by the consistancy of the salad dressing/cheese topping.  It didn't melt and become browned and "cheesy" like I thought it would.  The taste is wonderful, I think it's almost too rich.  I thinks maybe I will try skipping the butter, spreading the Ranch on first, browning it a few minutes and then topping with the grated cheese and browning that.

I cut this in half. I used my No-Guilt Zesty Ranch Dip and half package of day old hot dog buns I cleaned out of my freezer. Family went nuts for it. There were no leftovers. I served it with Chick'n Parmesan Casserole, which is also from this site. This made six halves of hot dog buns.

Oh man, this stuff is sinfully good! I used a blend of shredded cheeses, as that's what I had on hand, and it was SO good. I could have eaten just this bread for dinner and been happy! Thank you, this will be made again and again in our house! :)

This was fantastic.  Took it to a dinner party and it was raved about.  I did omit the butter, but other than that followed the recipe as written.  Will definitely make again!

Good, but very rich. Great idea, but I may try it with a different type of dressing next time.

I was all set to make this for dinner last night...had my bread sliced and buttered, had the cheese shredded...  Then I noticed that the bottle of ranch in the fridge was empty!  I quickly substituted some caesar dressing since that was the only thing I had in the fridge.  It turned out really good and made a nice accompaniment to our meal.  I bet this is great with the ranch dressing and I can't wait to try it again when I have some!

My boyfriend is not a huge ranch fan, so I only used 1/2 a cup of dressing.  I also skipped the butter, as I figured we didn't need the extra calories.  The four stars are based on taste - we did enjoy the cheesy ranch flavor.  However, it needs to be baked for longer than 15 minutes to make sure the cheese melts.  It might also be good to broil it for a few minutes at the end to get a nice crust on the topping.  Finally, this feeds a lot more than 6 people!

I will give the rating my boyfriend gave because he is so finicky that when he really likes something it's almost a surprise! He loved the taste, I loved how easy it was. I thought it tasted pretty good, but was very rich. What I didn't like was the fact that he had all the leftovers gone by the time I got home from work the next day!

This was pretty good. I added garlic. Next time I will cut the amount of ranch in half, we found it a little too overpowering.

The only thing is that I used the cheese and bread that I had on hand. That was Mexican Style Shredded Cheese, and hamburger buns. I also used light ranch. This was good. Rich.

This was good! I only had cheddar-jack on hand, so I just used that. We really liked the addition of the ranch dressing...it was nice without being too over-powering. I would make this again! Thanks for sharing. :)
