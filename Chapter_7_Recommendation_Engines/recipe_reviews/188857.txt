I made this mac and cheese as written only changing the turkey bacon for real bacon. My only reason for using real bacon is because I prefer it over turkey bacon. Excellent! I found it to be creamy with just the right amount of spice. Thanks for posting because it is a great mac and cheese!

I made this mac and cheese on New Year's Eve as a side dish to a BBQ chicken recipe I have. My guests as well as myself thought that it was very flavorful with a wonderful creaminess. I didn't find it to be overly spicy as written so I added a bit more ground red pepper and a dash of liquid smoke in addition to the smoked paprika. I did not add the turkey bacon into the mac and cheese itself. Instead I let the bacon cool completely then put it in my food processor on "grind" until it had the consistancy of bread crumbs then sprinkled it on top. When making mac and cheese, I usually use a mix of cheddar and American cheese but I thought that the Velveeta melted wonderfully and made this mac and cheese extremely smooth and creamy. I will definitely be making this again, perhaps for the Superbowl!

Great.  I stay away for velveeta and processed cheeses.  GO to the deli and buy american cheese ENDS.  The ends are excellent for cooking and delis usually sell them for $1.99-$2.99 lb... a great bargain and no preservatives like velveeta!

First..as the person who submitted this recipe..I would like to thank everyone who tried it. Second - Yes I do agree that real cheese is always better than Velvetta..but Velvetta does melt smoothly and less greasy than cheddar, for example.

The flavor was pretty good, but I thought the cheese had an odd texture. I never use Velveeta so I was unsure what to expect. I was not pleased by the way it was just kind of sticky, more like peanut butter than cheese. If I made again, I would switch cheese types.

Very good recipe. I couldn't find smoked paprika so i used Spanish paprika (was told they are one in the same) I followed the recipe exactly but I think I will cut it in half next time as this makes a lot.

This was very good!  I couldnt find smoked paprika anywhere so I ended up using a little bit of liquid smoke and some chipotle in adobo for a little smokey flovor and some heat.

I tried this over the weekend and served it to the guys at my firehouse. It was very good. I added more cayenne and smoked paprika. Very creamy and great flavor.

We loved this! Very unique recipe and easy to make. I thought it was spicy as written but my wife, who can eat hot sauce by the spoonful didn't so she added more cayenne. Either way, we both loved it. If you are looking for a tasty and easy mac & cheese, this is it!

Wow. This is so cheesy rich, I feel guilty for giving it five stars. I feel like I shouldn't LIKE it so much! Didn't do the bacon and replaced smoked paprika with normal paprika because I didn't have any smoked on hand.  It was delish. Perfectly spicy. Mmmm.

Great Mac & Cheese. Friend said it was the best he's ever had. Thanks for sharing! Not big on smoke flavoring so just used all regular paprika, also diced up some tomatoes, green pepper, and onion, saut√©ed in the bacon grease (what there was of it) and added them in for some veggies. Leftovers made a tasty lunch the next day, microwaved just fine.

This is my favorite Mac N Cheese recipe other than my mother's.  I have followed the directions to the letter and it was great.  I have also used real bacon and it was even better.  Makes a huge pot that allows me to take leftovers to work for a couple of days as well.

Very easy to make. I don't like spicy foods, but following the recipe this wasn't spicy at all. Definitely add more if you're looking for a kick. My family enjoyed it though, will make again

This was okay, I liked the addition of the turkey bacon. Not as smoky as I was hoping for though. I preferred the Smoky Four Cheese Macaroni Bake in terms of overall smoky flavor.

A little too "thick" for our taste.  Especially the next day as leftovers.

I really liked it with a couple tweaks. It was a bit too thick on the sauce/ I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk to thin it down a little. I did not have any smoked paprika (just used the regular paprika I had) but what I did have in the fridge was smoked Gouda. I don't keep Velveeta in the house...hate the stuff...faux cheese to me....so I made mine with half American cheese (soft and creamy so it will melt nicely) and half smoked gouda (to get the smoky flavor I was missing from the non existent smoked paprika).

This is AWESOME as long as you eat it while it's hot.  It doesn't re-heat well, so leftovers are not very good.

I made this last week w/o the bacon since 2 of my boys don't like it.  It turned out great and everyone enjoyed it.  Came out a little dry so maybe next time I'll add a little more cheese sauce but other than that it was awesome and I will definitely be making this again probably for my Super Bowl party.

Yum!!! I was a little hesitant especially with the turkey bacon, but it was wonderful. It also re-heats beautifully. I might try a different type of pasta next time. The shells stuck together and I had to pull them apart, which was a pain, but that didn't take away from the recipe. I also might add a touch more cayenne pepper just because I love spicy. Yum Yum Yum

I made this last night and used apple wood smoked bacon as another user suggested. It was great. I didn't think the cheese had a weird texture at all. It melted smoothly and was very creamy. Great for a quick, comforting weeknight meal.

Sorry, didn't care for this at all! Not sure if its the recipe itself, or if my family just doesn't like Velveeta cheese. Either way didn't like this at all. No spice could be tasted at all. Tasted like a big bowl of processed cheese.

This mac and cheese was delicious!  Although, I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 simply because it's not the healthiest of meals.  All that gooey cheese and cream made for a hearty rich dinner, but the calorie, fat, & cholesterol counts made it a bit of a buzz kill for me.  I felt like I needed to serve it with a side of Lipitor.  I will make this "once in a while" as an unhealthy guilty pleasure dinner.

Very good! I substitute proscutto for the back and used real cheddar cheese, we don't care for processed cheese food. My family said it was fantastic.

I have to say, this was very tasty. I loved the smoky / spicy. Very different and a great new spin on an old favorite! Will definitely make this again.

Oh it bothers me to no end when people give a recipe they haven't even tried a negative rating just because they don't like how it looks or ingredients listed. I would consider myself a mac and cheese aficionado. I have been eating the stuff since I am a kid and tried many different versions. I liked this version because of the smoky and spiciness of it. I used apple wood smoked bacon instead of turkey bacon. Yes, Velvetta isn't the best thing in the world for you but it makes a darn good mac and cheese! Great recipe. Definitely worth a try!

This is a new spin on the old mac and cheese routine. Like most kids, mine are addicted to mac and cheese and love it when I make it with velveeta which is what I did here. My only word of caution: be very careful with the cayenne pepper! I accidentaly spilled some, thinking that it wouldn't be a big deal, but boy was I wrong! Needless to say that was a bad dinner that night! But overall, this is a great way to spice up the boring mac and cheese.
