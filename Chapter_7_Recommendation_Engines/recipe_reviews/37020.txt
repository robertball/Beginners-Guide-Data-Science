Lately I have begun to use 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of a 1/2 cup, Key Lime Juice instead of regular lime juice and twice the hot sauce.

Overall, everyone gave this a three.  I brought it to a cookout and we all agreed it needed a little something added to give it a little zip.  Maybe some vinegar of some sort.  But I'll try it again with some changes!  Thanks!

Maybe it's because I've recently had several other cole slaw recipes that were superb, so in comparison--this one wasn't very good--but I wasn't particularly impressed.  I could barely detect the hotsauce and the overall flavor was just weak.  In fairness, I must say that I tried the coleslaw immediatly.  Tomorrow, with time to mesh, the flavors will likely be stronger.  I will modify my comments if time significantly improves the recipe.

This is now my favorite slaw recipe! I read the submitters update and I only used 1/4 cup of oil. I doubled the cilantro and hot sauce (personal preference) and left everything else the same. I have been using a similar one from this site for a couple of years but now that I have discovered this one with the addition of cumin, hot pepper sauce, and a LOT more cilantro, I won't be going back to it. Thank you Doug for sharing your great recipe!

Its great for anyone who likes veggies. I love slaw but my husband hates mayo coleslaw. I finally found a coleslaw that he will eat! I love the dressing best.

This was o.k. but I think I'd stick with regular old coleslaw.  I did add some white vinegar as someone suggested but it still seemed to be missing something.

This is one of my 3 favorite coleslaws on this site.   The other 2 are Nate King Cole Slaw and Southern Coleslaw.    This is a colorful and tasty coleslaw.    You can control the "kick" with the hot sauce and change it down or down depending on your taste (and your guests).    When serving guests I split the coleslaw into 2 bowls and give one bowl a kick and leave the other bland.

This didn't work for us....the flavor of the cumin and cilantro just didn't work with the crispy vegetables.

This was a really nice and light alternative to regular coleslaw! I will definitely make it again. I left out the hot sauce and only used about 3-4 tbs. of olive oil.

What a great coleslaw, I liked that it didn't have any mayo in it. I didn't have a yellow bell pepper so had to use a green and red pepper, but yellow would certainly give more color, but the green tasted fine. I did up the cumin to one teaspoon and added more hot sauce, since I like it spicy. I let it marinade for about five hours and it was soooo good. We served this with some venison deer poppers on AR and it went very well with it. Thanks Doug for such a health conscious coleslaw...I will be making this again, but make sure I have a yellow bell in stock.

very colorful and tasty!  You can modify the salad dressing to your taste.  The pictures do not do it justice, b/c it looks even better in real life.  Dr. Don Colbert approved.

Beautiful! And so nice to have an alternative to a may-based slaw. However, it definitely lacks a punch, even with extra hot sauce -- it needs more lime or the addition of vinegar.

I followed the comment to use 1/2 the oil (so 1/4 cup) and I liked the way it turned out!

I think of this as a Mexican slaw and a good way to add veggies to a Mexican dinner.  It also is great on fish tacos.

My 1st coleslaw dish! Made for my 1st pot luck with my neice's lovely new in-laws. I thought they were all pretty traditional, so this dish seemed like going way out on a limb! I used two packages of pre-shredded coleslaw mix, 2x the cumin and garlic. The resulting dish looked gorgeous, smelled divine. To my untutored eye it looked like enough to feed 30, which was good as the 11 adult attendees all went back for third helpings of this wonderful dish. I came home with about 1 cup of slaw. Thanks so much for the great recipe!

Went light on the EVOO I had on hand, light on the cumin, no garlic. It was great! Just enough flavor for the slaw, easy to eat a lot and totally good for you.
