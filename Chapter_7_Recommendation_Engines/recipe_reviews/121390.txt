I made quite a few adjustments and what I ended up with was GREAT.  I actually omitted the orange juice for a more traditional stir-fry.. I added in beef broth and a little worcestershire with the soy sauce and left out the sugar.  I added in some tofu and scrambled egg (I love eggs in stir-frys).  I also cooked the rice in low sodium beef broth.  I topped the whole thing with toasted slivered almonds. With all these changes, I gave this recipe 5 stars.

This recipe was great. I didn't have any cauliflowerets or mushrooms, so I just subbed frozen green beans. In fact, all of my veggies were frozen except the carrots and this still came out great. I served it over some rice cooked in chicken stock and tossed with soy sauce. EXCELLENT! I also salted and peppered the veggies as they sauteed. The only thing I may do differently next time is reduce the sugar from 2T to 1T.  THanks for sharing this one!

DH & I enjoyed this.  Very nice flavor with the orange juice in it.  I scaled the recipe in half for the two of us.  Used reduced-sodium tamari, rather than soy sauce, cut the sugar to 2tsp, added chicken (marinated in garlic & OJ), a bit of red bell pepper for extra color, and served over a meatless version of House Fried Rice from this website.

LOVE this recipe. After making it once and eating it over rice I changed that the following time to eat with Chowmein Noodles. That was definitely the change that it needed. Be careful not to add too much Orange juice though. Since the taste and strength of Orange Juice can vary depending on the brand, sample it before adding it. If it has a stronger punch try adding a little less so that it blends instead of overpowers. This has a great flavor for those who don't like plain 'ol veggies.

this is delish! I marinated cut up chicken thighs in orange juice, garlic and ginger for a few hours, then stir fried. Added to veggies just before the sauce. I also added some pureed ginger, I love the ginger/orange juice combination. Will be making this for company !!

I thought it was a bit too sweet because I used fresh squeezed O.J. I omitted the sugar and increased the (low-sodium) soy sauce.  Omitted the mushrooms, added onions instead. I did not use any oil, just sauteed onions with crushed ginger and garlic in water.  Decreased the cornstarch to 1 TB.  Turned out really well.  My boyfriend licked the plate.

This stir fry was awful. Halfway through my bowl of rice and stir fry I started feeling nauseous. I even followed the hints found in the reviews of this recipe. My boyfriend and I ended up eating leftovers instead. Will never make again and am wary of any stir fry recipe.

This was pretty good, but I felt the sugar would have been too sweet for our tastes. The OJ added just enough. I also cut back on the ginger, added leftover chicken from last night and more seasonings. Served this with noodles and everyone was happy. Thank you!

This was absolutely excellent. I followed the recipe exactly, but omitted the peas. Glad I did because I really don't think they beonged in this dish. The taste of citrus was wonderful, but not overpowering at all. It tasted just like a mandarin dish would in a four star restaurant. I think this should have been given a much nicer name to make it seem as appealing as it is. However, scratch that prep time and cook time. Not even close. I prepped for 30 minutes and cooked for an hour. Sooo worth it though.

Took others advice and omitted the sugar and I can't imagine it being any more sweeter.  The OJ adds just enough sugar.  Great meal for weekend days, quick and easy especially with frozen veggies.

This wasn't bad at all. It was however too sweet, overpowering any taste of the actual vegetables. Kids ate it, but the adults had to add alot more rice to manage the sweetness. Personally I would have liked to get a bit more of the soy flavour to come through. Definitely cut back on the sugar. If you're looking for an "authentic" stir fry you should probably look elsewhere. For what it is - a quick way to serve up some vegetables as a main - not bad.

This was okay.  I added tofu and then I added some Sirahcha sp. (you know that spicy red sauce in the rooster bottle) It was okay, but it needed a bit more of something.  I may try again, but will add more soy sauce for saltiness.

ok...we didn't care for this when we first ate it; however, WE LOVED IT as leftovers!  So, I'll be making this again but will prepare the night before and then just reheat for the next day.  Thanks for the recipe!!  This will be a regular at our table.

I didn't care for this recipe, neither did my husband. I agree with some of the other reviewers. This has too much of an orange juice taste. It may be good with several modifications, but I will definitely not make again.

Very easy to put together, however I wasn't too impressed by the flavor. In my opinion, it doesn't taste like a Chinese dish or traditional stir fry. Oh well.

Excellent stir fry. I always reduce the sugar to 2t and add chicken or thinly sliced beef strips for my meat lovers.

I changed a few things to suit what I had on hand. I was highly upset when I started making this dish and realized all the orange juice was gone. Sigh. I still decided to make this without. Still very very good and will make again. I didn't have cauliflower so I left that out and I served this with Lo Mein Noodles also from this site. Delicious meat free meal.

Excellent! I squeezed fresh orange juice for this, and it was divine. As per another reviewer, I used only 1 TBS of cornstarch, and I marinated the tofu in the orange-soy mixture for about an hour. Then stir fried it with the sauce. Instead of olive oil, I used coconut oil (which, at high temperatures, is supposed to be better for your health because it's not carcinogenic). I only used tofu, bell peppers, and broccoli, (I like things simple) and I'd give this recipe 5 stars!

This is one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes that I make. Very quick and easy. I added chicken and used Worcestershire sauce and omitted the OJ and it was tasty! This already has been and will continue to be a repeat in our home.

I did not care for this dish at all but my husband loved it so I will make it again with some improvements. less sugar and oj would have been better.  Also I would reduce the stir fry time because by the time you add the sauce and boil it to thicken it up, the veggies are already pretty cooked and it would result in soggy stir fry.

Pretty good recipe, glad I cut the sugar in 1/2,as suggested by other reviews. I didn't care for the orange part of this. Guess I'm not into sweet stir fry as much as I thought. I might try this without the orange juice and ginger and sub broth and crushed pepper, and increase soy sauce a bit.

It was great! Left out the cauliflower, and used white table wine instead of orange juice. Thinking about making it with cabbage or bean sprouts! I think the garlic is really what brings it all together!

I made this for my picky family. They loved it. substituted for sugar snap peas, I used frozen vegatables, let them thaw out, this was a simple quick meal. I really am glad I took the time to read the reviews. next time I am going to add other vegatables. I also didn't use sugar and sunny d instead of orange juice. I liked the sweet taste instead of the strong orange flavor. This was a great recipe that I can use different variations of different vegatables, next time I will use pasta instead of rice...

This is a great stir fry.  After reading the reviews I decided to cut the orange juice down to 1/2 a cup and eliminate the sugar all together.  I put in red onion and no cauliflower because I don't like it.  Everyone thought this was really good.

I made this tonight with a few changes - I added red peppers and onions and omitted cauliflower (ick!). I also added chicken and only put in one tbs of sugar, which was plenty. It was delicious, and my family enjoyed it, too. :)

Turned out very well, although it didn't thicken as well as I would have liked.  High-altitude problems, I guess.

Several people noted that it was too sweet for their taste.  Simple solution: add more ginger (will still be sweet, but not as assaulting on the taste buds) or soy sauce WITH sodium.  Salt naturally neutralizes sugar, so by elimating the sodium in the soy sauce, you are preventing health problems and causing your stir-fry to become too sweet.

This will be my fall back recipe whenever I make veggie stir fry. I used my own preferred mix of vegetables (broccoli, snow peas, squash, and a red jalapeno) and used ginger paste since that's what I had. The sauce did come out a little thick so next time I'll cut back on the corn starch. I had it with brown rice and it was delicious.

This turned out really well for me. I LOVE the flavor of the sauce. I did add some tofu that I marindaded in the sauce (minus the cornstarch) for a half hour before cooking. I think that the sauce would be fantastic on beef stirfry as well.  --edited to add: I tried it with beef tonight. Didn't have time to marinade so I just stirfried the beef plain and set it aside while I did the rest of the recipe and added it back in just before adding the sauce. Wonderful! --

This was really easy and very tasty!  I reduced the sugar as suggested (but only to 1.5T because I like sweet stuff) and it wasn't too sweet.  The sauce was a good consistency, too.  I will try this recipe each time I stir-fry (until I feel like experimenting again), which is usually 3x/month or so!

Fast and easy!  It isn't the kind of meal I would place in front of visit, but it's awesome for when you want to feed your family in a hurry.  We all loved the sweet, orangy taste, though I thought the sauce wasn't thick enough.  Next time I'll also add either tofu or chicken to make it more nutritive and interesting.

I used baby bok choy, broccoli, carrots and beef.... really good, nice color!  Served with brown rice cooked with chicken stock and quickly fried with egg.  I cut the sugar in half and used fresh ginger and extra garlic.  I added pineapple and mandrine oranges on top when I served it.  yummy!

This is really good.  I used different vegetables (I just don't care for mushrooms in stir-fry) and added tofu, which I stir-fried first in a little green onion and garlic. I also used half the sugar as other reviewers suggested.
