This is a very good recipe..a can of RoTel tomatoes gives it some zip..a lady at my church makes this all the time. You can change up the type of beans you use depending on your preference..but black beans or pinto are great!

I made this for dinner one evening and we thought it was delicious.  The only thing I change was I didn't add any black olives as I did not have any.  Will certainly make it again.  Thanks for the great recipe.

The combination of ingredients is delish. However the consistency was a bit off. I added an extra cup of water and a cup of tomato juice.

I thought this was delicious and will continue to make!  I followed the recipe exactly with 2 minor exceptions: added a 7oz can of diced green chiles (because i love them) and I used a cup of tomato sauce instead of tomato juice and just filled the tomato sauce can with water.    Can't wait to make it during the winter when it isn't 100 degrees outside here in Texas!

Oh my gosh! This was amazing!I used 1 1/2lbs of very lean natural ground beef, didn't have to drain it! I used 2 freshly diced tomatoes and omitted the chiles because my kids don't like anything hot. I also added a cup of beef broth and went ahead and drained the cans of corn (I normally use frozen corn, but didn't have any) and olives so it wouldn't be too watery. I used about a cup of dry black beans (I try to avoid canned processed foods) and I slightly cooked the onion, 4 cloves of minced garlic, and bell pepper in the skillet when the meat was just about done browning. I served different toppings to put on top: shredded Mexican style cheese, sliced avocado, sour cream, fried corn tortilla strips, and cut up some limes. Nice little make-it-your-own taco soup bar.

I have been making this soup for years & it is so versatile. I add a can of chili beans to give it a little more zip. I make the soup & we use the leftovers for several days. We use a slotted spoon & make soft tacos one night, the next night we have a potato bar...just put it on top of a baked potato & add your fave toppings, sour cream shredded cheese,etc. We also make nachos with it...my fave! Just put on top of tortilla chips, add shredded cheese, sour cream & olives. The possibilites are endless. Enjoy!

I've made this recipe twice already, and it's great!  I didn't have tomato juice so I substituted a small jar of medium salsa and a cup of water.  I also used a small can of sliced black olives instead of what the recipe called for.

I couldn't find 15.5oz can of sliced ripe olives.  I used a 3.8 oz can and it was sufficient.  I also put shredded pepper jack cheese over the servings with crushed taco chips.  Delish!

I make this a lot for easy work lunches. I freeze it in single serving containers so I can just grab and go. It freezes very well. Sometimes I substitute the beef for ground turkey, and both are great. I also use 1 cup of chicken stock instead of tomato juice because I never have tomato juice on hand. I drain my corn and black beans and add chicken stock accordingly. Whenever I heat it up in the microwave at work, my co-workers always comment on how good it smells.

Really tasty! The only reason i gave it four stars was because I added jalepanos and 1 extra can of green chilis plus used only half the olives the recipe called for.  Overall, excellent for nachos, tacos or soup!  My husband ate this all week long!

I used chicken instead of beef - just threw in 4 frozen breasts with everything else (plus about 2 cups water) and cooked on high for 4 hours (then shredded the chicken breasts & threw them back in).  Otherwise I followed the recipe - using hot taco seasoning to make sure there was enough heat (we like things spicy).  Very easy & tasty meal.

Made it as dirceted except for the diced tomatoes with green chilies as we couldn't find any at the store, it was very good but didn't have enough heat and was more like a "stoup" (inbetween a soup and a stew).  Everyone liked it though just needed a bit more heat and maybe a little bit more liquid.

I love this recipe. As a college student, I'm often short on both money and time. This is a highly cost-efficient recipe that lets me throw everything in a pot, go to class, and come back to a delicious meal. It also saves very well, which is an added bonus.

This was delicious. I was in a bit of a rush so to save some time in the crock I sauteed the onion and bell pepper until they started to caramelize. I also went with the 3.8oz can of olives. I think the 15.5 would have been way too much. Turned out great. Topped with a spoonful of sour cream, jack cheese, and crushed tortilla chips.

This recipe is good...but of course I edited a bit.  I suggest browning the onion and bell pepper along with some minced garlic.  I also added another packet of taco seasoning and one can of kidney beans.  Ranch seasoning is not needed, nor are the olives.  Instead of 1 cup tomato juice I used 2 cans tomato soup.  Being from Louisiana I like to serve this over rice...but Fritos work just as well!  Also add a spoonful of sour cream to your bowl.

I made this today! I added red kidney beans and used low sodium ingredients where I could and spiced the meat using garlic powder, onion powder, a pinch of salt, black pepper and Chicago seasonings.  It cooked for 7 hours and the taste was great. We put cheese in the bottom of our soup bowls to melt the cheese better and topped it off with sour cream. This will be made again!

Great Soup!!My boldest daughter drools over this soup.  She asks me to make it all the time.  Only 2 things I do differently.  1 I don't like chunks of peppers or onions, so I run them thru my chopper, chop them very fine.  2 instead of tomato juice I use a 14.5 oz can tomato sauce and a can of water.  Use rotel diced tomatoes with green chilis......makes a spicier soup than any other brand!

Very good and quick recipe.  I hadn't prepared it in the morning for my crockpot so just cooked in a pot on the stove until peppers were tender. It was still very quick.  Although I love the taste of ranch seasoning, I never buy it in a store because it's loaded with msg.  I found a recipe for a homemade mix that I keep on hand.  For recipes that call for a packet, I use 1 tbsp of this mix.  It's 1/2 c dry buttermilk, 1 tbsp dried parsley, 1 tsp dried dill weed, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp dried onion flakes, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp black pepper. Blend in blender. Store in airtight container.

This meal was very easy to make and smelled great while cooking in the crock pot.  It tastes really good.  We added shredded cheese and tortilla strips on top.  This will be on my family's menu a lot!

I made this for dinner and double it And glad I did. The four of us ate it and was very good. And I had leftovers and it didn't last very long. I left out all the salt and bought all low sodium ingredient.
and still very good

Wow, this is delicious! I had to omit the onion, bell pepper and black olives due to family preferences, so I made up for it by adding an extra pound of beef, and I used tomato sauce instead of juice... the remaining combination was outstanding. We added shredded cheese and sour cream to taste, and it made a wonderful soup/chili. And it was so easy! This is definitely a winner in our family!

My family LOVED this! We cannot wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also added about 3 additional cups of tomato juice. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! Delicious!

Super easy.  I browned the meat, threw in the other items, turned it on low and let the house for 8 hours. Came home, fed the kids and everyone was happy. I left out the spicy stuff and added it later to my bowl.  Will make this again as a different twist on chili.

A lifesaver on a rainy day!  My whole family loved this recipe -  none left.  Next time I'll double it.  We put tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl, ladled the soup over them and topped it off with a pile of grated cheddar and a dollop of sour cream.  Excellent one dish meal!

This chili like soup is delish!  The only thing I changed was I substituted spicy hot v8 juice for the tomato juice and it's so quick and easy to make.  I will definitely be doubling and taking to pot lucks!

I won't use packaged taco mix so I added chili powder, cayenne and dried chili peppers and a couple shakes of Frank's red hot. I added a jar of salsa in addition to the canned tomatoes. Very easy and tasty.

I made this last night.  Wonderful!  I did tweak it just a little bit.  Like other contributers I added one cup of Beef Stock.  I also substituted a cup of tomato sauce in place of the tomato juice.  Because of the extra fluid, I did drain 50% of each can that I poured into the crock pot, with the exception of the diced tomatoes.  We like things a little more mild in our house, so I left out the green chilis.  It took about 4 1/2 hours in my crock pot.  I served it with a dollop of sour cream, some shredded sharp cheddar cheese and tostitos scoops on the side.  It was fabulous.  Easy to freeze.  A must in anyone's recipe box!

We doubled the recipe to feed 15 people after a long day of moving and not a bite was left. We topped with cheddar, sour cream, additional black olives, green onions and dorito and frito chips and everyone is still talking about it.

This is awesome!  This is a great recipe as posted. My wife and kids thought it was a little spicy, so the second time I made it I used mild taco powder. It was still little to spicy for them, but tasty with mild taco powder. Next time I am going to use the mild taco powder and replace the diced tomatoes & green chilis with just diced tomatoes to see if the spicyness is to their liking. I love this recipe!!! YUM YUM!

Love the recipe .  !st time I made just like the recipe.  Great!  2nd time meatless.  Browned  3 med. chopped coarsely onions,  2 lg sweet peppers and  5 smashed cloves of garlic. ( The veggie's acted as my meat). Changed corn to Mexican  blend, added a can of low salt chilli beans, didn't have any tomato juice added  V-8 instead.  Dump all into the crock pot.  Voila!  Served topped with Cojita cheese, sour cream, sliced jalapeno's, black olives, and taco chips. Meatless Monday was awesome!!

Increased this to serve 12 as I had company coming, and so glad I did. I made it the day before so, I just had to warm it up the next day. It was delicious, very chili like, but, not quite as heavy. We crumbled tortilla chips over the top and a dollop of sour cream. I will be making this again soon.

This is a good recipe. It's easy to assemble, throw in a crock pot and walk away. A great idea for families with members on the run. It does need more liquid than asked for. I threw in a cup of water, which I got from other reviews, then I threw in about a cup and a half of chicken broth I just happened to have in the freezer. I'm not big on all the sodium added to canned items so I had a sodium free can of tomatoes, used a bag of frozen corn mixed with green chilis, green peppers and onions. I used dried beans instead of canned. The chicken broth I used was sodium free. The tomato juice I used was sodium free. The only sodium came from the black olives. Definitely make this when you know it's going to be a busy day and all the kids will be floating in and out of the house, eating at different times.

I've made this for over 35 years, I use frozen corn, rotel, ranch style beans and tomato sauce rather than Tom juice. You can also use V8 spicy Tom juice in a pinch. 3 generations love it.

This is a tasty, hearty soup that has always been one of my family's favorites. I usually add a can of beer for a richer taste. Like with any soup, the variations are limitless! Very yummy! :)

Very tasty. Very chili-like. We added celery because I had some on hand, and only half the peppers, since peppers aren't our favorite. Make sure you've got your pepto on hand for later that night!

I've made this several times for my fiance, and he LOVES it.  I serve it with a dallop of sour cream on top and tortilla chips around the bowl.

So tasty and super easy! I used ground turkey instead of beef & it came out great. Also added a red bell pepper (was gonna go bad if I didn't use it). I think it could easily be turned into a very good chili recipe too.

delicious! only gave it 4 stars because I had to make the following changes: I had to use tomato sauce, because I already had it. I also added a little chili powder for  a lil kick. I loved it! I accompanied it with some fritos. yummy!

This was a good base for a quick dinner on my "I don't care what they eat" night. I made my own taco seasoning, I added a variety of chopped bell peppers and threw in other chopped veggies I had on hand. I honestly think it gets better the more you add. NOTE: I used almost all organic ingredients.

I only made a few changes to this recipe... I used ground turkey instead of ground beef, I used red and yellow peppers instead of green (because that's what I had) and I didn't use the olives (because I didn't have any). But this recipe was fantastic!! It made a ton of soup and it was delicious! I will definitely make this again.

I cooked this exactly as directed, but I also added cooked rice to the pot and put different add-on's on the table for people to add to their own bowls.  I put jalopanos, sour cream, Frito chips and shredded cheese.  I have a family of 12, and even my picky eaters loved it. You really can't mess this one up.  I will definately make this again and will become a permanent staple in my personal cookbook.

I'm sure this is wonderful the way it is but I had to use what I had in the kitchen. I used chopped jalapeno peppers instead of chilies, no black olives, a 28 oz can of chopped tomatoes, 1/2 can tomato paste, 1 28 oz can of water blended with the paste and then added to the mixture. I might try more black beans next time. This is very good with cornbread as a sidedish. Yummy, Yummy

Didn't have tomato juice so I substituted enchilada sauce (two cans) added green chilis (one can) skipped the black olives.  This was delicious served with tortilla chips on the top.  Yum!

Super easy and super tasty! I did add a few things to my soup; I added 1 can of kidney beans (because i love them) and they made the soup a little more hearty.  Before i made the soup i had read other reviews saying the soup needed some kick, and so I  added a can of jalapeños and a couple tablespoons of Tapatio hot sauce and some medium heat chunky salsa.  I also added a can of tomato sauce just because I was afraid it was going to turn out too think (like chili).  We topped the soup with shredded cheese, crushed tortilla chips, sour cream and cilantro.  The soup turned out a little more spicy than i expected, because of the Tapatio, but i LOVED it, but i LOVE spicy food.  My husband and brother-in-law told me they liked it but, i think it may have been too much heat for them to handle.  I will definitely be making this soup again.

Very good soup.  Wonderful full flavor.  My husband is not a big soup person and he LOVED it.  It filled my big crockpot and we only had 1 small bowl left when we were finished......there are only two of us..........very good.

Quick & tasty.  I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, so I substituted chili powder (3T) for taco seasoning and a can of tomato soup in place of the tomato juice.  I made the soup on top of the stove instead of using a crock pot, and I added a 1/4 cup  of sour cream at the end.  I topped each bowl with a dallop of sour cream, chopped scallions, & shredded cheddar cheese.  Very good!  Next time I make this, I will make as a dip by omitting the tomato soup, adding 8 oz cream cheese & serving with tortilla chips.

My husband and I liked it. We were a little worried about the black olives so we added the smaller can vs what was listed.  Otherwise we followed the recipe as described.

I made this because I was looking for a pantry staples type of meal . It fit the bill perfectly . However , I did tweak it a little . I omitted the olives and bell pepper just because I didn’t have any . I added a fresh chopped jalapeño and used crushed tomatoes 28oz can in place of Rotel . I also added 2 extra cups of tomato juice for a thinner soup and a tap of salt and 2tsp of cayenne . Just cuz we like it spicy !

This was awesome.  We like a little heat so just a couple of changes.  First - get the Hot and Spicy Old El Paso Taco mix.  I used one 20 oz. can of Black Beans vice the 14.5, two cans of the original Rotel with Green Chilies, and an additional 1/2 cup Tomato Juice.   Very nice flavor.  We will make again this winter!

I made a few changes.  No olives, large can of tomato sauce not juice, and a little water.  I also used ground turkey and fajita seasoning instead of taco.  I like the favor better, thats what I use for tacos!  It was great on a cool fall night, even my picky 6 year old gave it two thumbs up!

I have wanted to make this for some time now and I finally did it. I loved it! I did omit many things from the recipe though. (Due to preferences). I omitted the black olives, green peppers and the ranch seasoning mix. It was still VERY tasty! I also used Pinto beans instead of black beans. I will definitely make this again and will add the ranch  mix next time. I cooked just as directed....in slow cooker on low for 5 hours and it was perfect. A friend of mine called it "Chili Soup" Lol. It is very yummy.

I really liked this one, I followed the recipe as written.  Next time I'll just add half a tsp of tabasco sauce because we like ours to be spicier.

Not sure if I did something wrong but the batch I made didn't really have a whole lot of flavor. Taco seasoning was very light and I couldn't tell that I put the ranch seasoning in it. I used a packet of McCormick taco seasoning, maybe it wasn't enough?

I loved this!!!! Made it this morning and let it simmer all day. I didn’t add the black olives. I love olives but didn’t think I’d like that taste in my soup. I did sprinkle some chilli powder in it and at the end added shredding cheese sour cream and some Fritos to my bowl. Will be making this again!!! Loved it

I added a dollop of sour cream to each bowl  and it gave a nice little bite to the flavor without adding spice.

I made this using two cans of Rotel. I left out the olives and bell peppers for personal preference. I served it with cheese and sour cream over Fritos. Amazing! Definitely a favorite.

Excellent and easily adaptable to what you have on hand. I made only minor changes, but still followed the recipe. This came out the consistency of a chili, and no, I did not drain any of the cans.  Everything in!  I doubled the recipe, used a 28 ounce can of herb diced tomatoes, tomato passata and ground turkey. I finely chopped 1 hot fingerling pepper and this was the perfect kick for this huge amount. For garnish, I used shredded cheddar with habanero, chopped cilantro, sour cream and chipotle cheddar tortilla strips. Well worth making, and better the next day. Yum!!

this recipe was unbelievably good. I used RoTel tomatoes and subbed in Turkey meet to make it a little healthier. i also used tomato sauce cause I wanted more of a stew consistency but this is PERFECT to prepare on the weekend and take to work for lunch all week. thank you so much for sharing!

I started this before heading to work, so it cooked on low for closer to 9 hours, but it still turned out wonderful. I came home to an amazing smelling apartment.

This is a staple in our house!  Only problem is that it goes waaay too fast.  The only change I make is I use a can of tomato sauce instead of the juice.  That was all I had when I wanted to try it and we love it so much, I'm afraid to change it!

Excellent!  This is my first ever attempt to make Tortilla soup, but I have tried many Tortilla soups.  I used El Pato Mexican tomato sauce and a can of water versus juice.  Also, I drained and rinsed corn since the liquid is so strong and added back in additional water.  It did take the whole 5 hours on low to cook the vegetables.  I served hot with shredded Mexican cheese and sour cream.  Crackers or crumble tortilla chips are good too. O'le

This is a tasty soup, I did not have time for the slow cooker so I used a pot on the stove top.  I added 3 cups of hot and spicey V8 instead of regular tomato juice.  Seemed to thick with only one cup.  Will make again!

Real good. I may have made it a little to spicy by yusing a spicy taco mix. Rotel tomatoes and instead of tomato juice I used a habenaro salsa I also made tortilla strips by taking 1/4 cup of olive oil 1/2 tsp cumin 1/2 tsp chili pepper powder and some salt. I mixed together brushed on tortillas and baked at 375 degrees for 10 minutes. Added Mexican cheddar cheese to the top of the soup and it was great on a cold winter evening. Will make again!

This is very good.  Added some plain tortilla chips to my serving for a little crunch.  This is a keeper! I also added an extra cup of tomato juice and a cup of water to make it more soupy.

This is very good! I didn’t have any tomato juice so I added an 8 ounce can of tomato sauce and 1 can of water.  Still, it was delish, and inviting to come home to after a busy weekday!

My son wanted me to make a taco soup using our slow cooker, so I tried this recipe.   I substituted a cup of salsa (not chunky) for the tomato juice and after I dished out the soup in a large bowl, I added shredded cheddar cheese on top and microwaved it 15 seconds until the cheese melted and topped it off with a dollop of sour cream.   We had corn tortilla chips on the side.   He gave me a big hug after he had a bowl and said we should frame this recipe on the kitchen wall so we don't lose it!!   ^_^

This is a great throw it together in the morning recipe.  I used frozen corn and added a bit of water (it says canned corn with juices).  Also, I didn't have tomato juice, but I pureed my canned tomatoes (home canned).  Other than that, I made the recipe as is.  Perfect for a cold day/night.

This was a pretty good soup. I left out the olives, added some chopped jalapeno peppers, and used bloody Mary mix instead of the tomato juice. I wouldn't say it reminded me of tacos,but it was tasty.

It turned out great. Something different. I added taco seasoning and onion and bell pepper to hamburger meat. Also added 2 tbsp of salsa to it to give it an extra kick. I'll definitely make it again.

A different take from the typical taco soup with chili beans, but I like it. I omitted the olives because I don't care for them. I also didn't have tomato juice, so I used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce with garlic, basil, and oregano plus a can of water. Instead of a package of taco seasoning, which I never have, I used 3 T. of Taco Seasoning I, which I always have made up in my spice cabinet.

I have made this recipe so many times and it is always good. At first I doubled the beef and the ranch dressing and it was awesome. Next I tried 2lbs. of chicken and eliminated the ranch dressing and it is awesome in it's own way. I also use a whole can of fire roasted peppers, whatever that small can is. I have also tried various beans from Great Northern, Dark red kidney, and chili beans. I love everything Mexican. Great recipe.

This was absolutely delicious.  We don't like black olives so I left those out but followed the recipe other than that.  This will definitely be going into our rotation of recipes!  Thanks!

This is a new family favorite. My two young daughters (ages 6&8) are extremely fussy eaters. This is colorful, healthy, tasty and fun if you add a side of grated cheese and some tortilla chips. Playing with food always helps!
I've made this recipe several times, doubling the quantity and freezing. Yes, it freezes wonderfully.

This recipe is delicious! I think the 15.5 oz can of sliced black olive is a typo, though. I couldn't find one that big so I used two 3.8 oz cans, and that was more than enough. I think 15.5 ounces would be way too much. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. Topped it off with cheese and sour cream and it was a hit!

Wow....flavorful soup!  Made a few changes .....deceased dry ranch package to maybe 3/4 package to avoid the extra sodium.  Substituted pinto beans for the corn. (only because I can't digest corn....bummer!)  Cooked this all day in a crock pot! on low.  Yum!

I'm a vegetarian so I used the original recipe but substituted soy for the hamburger.  I used V8 rather than tomato juice, something I also do with my vegetarian chili.  This turned out great!  Great flavor, great spice and it was delicious with tortilla chips.  I will definitely be making this again in the future.  I also posted a picture.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this soup! I've made it with ground turkey and ground beef and both options are awesome! I use a can of Rotel plus a can of diced tomatoes, 2 extra cups of tomato juice, fresh garlic, and i cook in a large pot for 2-3 hours on low setting and it turns out wonderful! If your wondering if you should make this i would say ABSOLUTELY!!!

My wife likes this better than the chili I make, and that's saying something! I increased the tomato juice to 4 cups because I wanted it to be a little thinner than what I saw with only one cup. Also omitted the black olives (wife's request). Wonderful with corn chips and sour cream as a garnish.

Love this recipe - I changed just a little bit.
*Diced olives
*Used 2 -  5.5 oz cans of Tomato juice
*Used 2  - cans of Diced Tomatoes (no chili's)
*Added a bit of water
*Ate with tortillas and sprinkled Taco cheese on top! :)
Delicious!  And very easy to make.

I have made this so many times and just love it.  I make it in a slow cooker just as the recipe says.  I put out cheese, sour cream, tortilla strips, and those strips you buy that are actually salad toppers.
I usually make a double batch because it is great 2 nights in a row or for company.  This is my favorite slow cooker recipe of all time!

We love this recipe, but everyone has their preferences so I still gave it 5 stars.  I too use V8 instead of tomato juice and serve with cheesy Mexican cornbread or Fritos Dips (whichever we decide on that night).

I don't usually like to rate the recipe if I didn't follow it exactly, but even without the onion (didn't have) and the full amount of ranch dressing packet (only 1/2 oz.) this soup had so much flavor!  Will definitely make it again (with the onion and ranch).

Loved it. Of course I made a few changes.... Didn't use beer, replaced the liquid with 1 1/2 cans chicken broth. I made my own taco seasoning ( chili powder,cumin,salt,pepper, and garlic. I also used frozen green chilies and 1 jalapeño for a kick of spice.  I wIll make it again for sure !!!!!!

this is really good but to me it's more like chili than tacos. I love it with corn bread. I took a readers suggestion and used an 8oz can of tomato sauce and a can of water instead of the tomato juice.

I made this just as the recipe dictated and everyone loved it! Plus, it's really easy! It's consistency is similar to chili. Next time, I'll add avocado as a topper before serving.

Excellent soup. The only changes I made were, because I didn't have any tomato juice I substituted 8oz can of tomato sauce and added a cup or so of water to it and I also didn't have time for a 5 hour crockpot meal so I cooked it on the stove top for about an hour and then put it in a heated crockpot on high for 2 hours. It came out great,
Very easy recipe. I made cheese quesadillas and served it with sour cream as well. Also used the roTel tomatoes and pinto beans. Also did not add the olives.

I love this recipe so easy. I added a few more seasonings and threw some fresh parsley and cilantro. I also used some beef broth. I did not have any regular ranch packets but I had a packet of south western ranch. Came out delicious!!

This tasted like chili to me, but I love chili so I loved this too. I didn't have any green peppers from my garden so I left those out. I did add a little extra tomato juice to make it thinner, so maybe that is why I thought it tasted like chili. It was great though and my husband really liked it too.

My husband said this was the best soup I have ever made.  I added a drained can of white hominey, dried basil, oregeno and cumin.  I doubled the recipe on all ingredients with the exception of the dry ranch dressing.  I added garlic powder to the meat.  I will definitely make it again.

This was REALLY good.  I did use 11 oz. of tomato juice and added a cup of water.  Besides those changes, I followed the recipe.  I would make this again and again.  I served with shredded cheese and chips.  Excellent.  Because of the sodium content, I used lower sodium taco seasoning and ranch packet.

I loved this there are so many add in's you can do. Instead of tomato juice that I did not have I used bloody mary mix spicy because I had it on hand. The other thing that I did was add some salsa I needed to use that I had in the frig. I had Rotel brand tomato's with chilies and added that. Not hot hot but adds a bit of interest. I even threw a bit of red wine in there. Really what I did was clean out the frig and made a wonderful flavorful meal. I did chop the onions and sautéed the onions to give them a sweet flavor. Gosh this was wonderful. If you want it a bit more soupy then add perhaps broth more wine or tomato liquid. This is a dish that you don't have to make in a crock pot if you don't want too. But if you are a working person you can cook on low till you come home from work. Enjoy!

Made this tonight, tweaked it just a bit, and there are barely any leftovers it was so delish!
I sauteed the onion w/ the lean meat, and 'browned' chopped mini sweet bell peppers before adding to the pot. Also used V8 ( 12 ounce can) instead of straight up tomato juice. I left out the black olive, 'cause we dont really like them. Add some spicy blue corn tortilla chips, and eat it up! I will be adding this recipe to my  rotation.

amazing good.  I didn't have black beans, so used kidney, but did drain the juice, and this meal is deeelish!!!  definitely will make again and again.
I added a can of diced green chile's too.. not too spicy but a tad of a kick..  it only made a 1/2 crockpot full, so it was gone the first day, next time I will make double batch so we can have leftovers.

This was excellent!  I didn't have any taco seasoning, but did have a packet of fajita seasoning, was very tasty.  I used a whole can of fire-roasted chiles (7 oz) because I didn't have a can of stewed tomatoes with chiles.  Very tasty soup, and everyone loved it!

So good!  I made this for dinner one night and both my husband and 2 year old son loved it.  They both cleared their bowls, my husband even went back for second bowl.  It's great with shredded cheese and tortilla chips.

Super easy, and AMAZING!  I loved this!  I used a can of "mild" Rotel, and after I spooned it into my bowl, topped with shredded Mexican blend cheese and sour cream.  This will definitely become one of my regular dishes to make!

So simple and full of flavour, my family absolutely adored it! I served it up with some warm corn chips to dip in, and it was an instant crowd pleaser.

I made this recipe exactly as it was written. We thought it was delicious. It basically tastes like a yummy chili.

I didn't add extra sour cream or tomato sauce and used just 4 oz of olives, but it turned out great! I added black beans w/jalapeno and lime which it gave it a nice kick. Topped with fritos and a little cheese. 

So easy and flavorful. Will be making again.

Wow!  This is great, and so simple to prepare.  After reading the recommendations of others, I added 1/2 cup water as to make this not quite so thick.  Additionally, I used a 15 ounce can of plain diced tomatoes, and diced 2 small jalapenos in lieu of using a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles and bell pepper.  (This gives it quite a kick, but I like spiciness.)  As suggested by others, I served with grated cheese and a dollop of sour cream.  Thanks for a recipe that I know we’ll be using a lot!

I followed the recipe as a base but did make a few changes as follows: Instead of 1 green pepper I used 1/2 and 1/2 of a sweet red pepper. I used frozen sweet corn, about 2/3 of a 1 lb bag, a total of 7 oz sliced blacked olives (was plenty), plain diced canned tomatoes, 4 oz can diced green chilis, diced 6 small slices of sliced jarred jalapenos and 8oz can tomato sauce plus 8 oz water. This made a very nicely spiced, not too spicey hot, very chunky soup. Not a ton of broth but just enough to make it more of a hearty soup. Served it topped with shredded Mexican cheese blend, dollops of sour cream, sliced green onions and chopped fresh cilantro with tortilla chips on side or broken on top. Absolutely delicious and unique! Will make it often and will try with chicken in place of beef for a change up.

This was not like a soup at all, I ended up adding a brick of cream cheese and used it as a dip.  It was great as a dip.

This was really good. It was more of a stew than a soup, but that didn't matter. I didn't have any tomato juice so I drained the diced tomatoes and used one can of tomato sauce with half can of water. I added sliced jalapenos too.

This is a very good recipe. The only thing different I did was to add some diced jalapenos and a little crushed red pepper to make it a little spicier. I think it would make a great base for enchiladas with some pepper jack and cheddar cheese thrown in and baked. I'm sure we'll be trying it that way too.
