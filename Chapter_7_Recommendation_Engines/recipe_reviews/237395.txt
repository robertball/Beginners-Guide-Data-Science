I made this as directed and found it like a salmon patty, but I agree alittle onion would help a lot. Also I agree it would be Delish in a zucchini boat this summer.

I wanted to make salmon patties tonight but didn't want to stand over a frying pan. I am so glad I pulled up this app and saw this post. I love the simplicity of this recipe!  I did add salt and pepper. I doubled the recipe and baked it in cast iron skillet. Due to the larger batch I baked it for 45 minutes. I got a nice little crust on the bottom.  At the table we used a touch of hot sauce.  I served with lima beans and left over biscuits.
Thank you very much!

This was quick and easy. Everyone enjoyed it. I added half of an onion diced and some seasoning to the mixture. Will make again.

My mom and I have been making a variation of this for years.  We just called it salmon casserole.  We used a good size, deep casserole dish or you could use a lasagna casserole dish.  Two 14.75 oz cans salmon and remove the bones.  We would break up (not like bread crumbs, just broken up) 2 tall packages, not boxes, but the packages of saltine crackers, so 1/2 box of saltine crackers.  So we only used three ingredients:  salmon, crackers and milk.  We would layer the salmon and crackers alternatively and the very top layer would be crackers.  Then pour the milk until you see it come up just a tiny bit on top.  Really just until you see the milk.  Then we'd bake for 1 hour and it was at 350 degrees.  If you wanted it more well done, you could add more time.  I now use the salmon pouches that have the bones already removed and just use enough pouches that equal 2 14.75 oz cans.  I also use the unsalted tops saltine crackers.  I've been eating this for over 20 years and I love it leftover the next day as well.  It's very healthy!
