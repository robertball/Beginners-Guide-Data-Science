These were great, but not what I was expecting.  Being from New Orleans, I was expecting our Butter Beans that have a thick consistency (like Red Beans and Rice).  These still tasted great and I served them over rice (made three servings considering my husband eats large portions).  I will make again, but I am still on the hunt for a butter beans/rice recipe.

A great recipe.The first time, I made it as written and it was very good. The second time, I turned it into a soup by adding a can of chicken broth and some water. I also added diced chicken breast and a diced carrot.I did not drain the beans and did not add flour. I kept the seasonings as written and it turned out very good.

YUM!  Cooked dried beans until they thickened, instead of using canned beans and flour.  Added jalapeno peppers because DH likes spicy.  Delicious!! Will use this recipe again!
UPDATE 4-3-2011:  I make this dish every couple of weeks, as part of regular rotation of bean dishes.  Today I added kidney beans to the butterbeans, to give another layer of texture, and added chipotle chili powder for extra kick.  This dish rocks!

Yum!  What a great way to eat veggies. I served this alongside gumbo and a big bowl of rice.  Even my "I'll never eat vegetables" guest enjoyed this one.

If you like butter beans, you are going to love this recipe. I added some cilantro and skipped the green pepper, and it worked out perfectly .  Iâ€™ll be making it again! Thanks!

After living in New Orleans 3 years, I was disappointed.  I might give it another try in the slow cooker for several hours to blend the flavors and make it more creamy, less watery, and the vegetables more tender.

These had good flavor but the beans ended up a little mushy so I won't cook as long next time. I also think you could get away with adding another can of beans if you wanted without changing any of the other ingredients due to the amount of "sauce" there was.

I didn't know if I would like butter beans, but I found out that I do like them.  This recipe is great, but I would like it hotter.  So the next time I make this recipe I think I will use some hot chili peppers.  I did not add the brown sugar, because I am a diabetic.  I decided to try it with 1 tablespoon of Splenda instead.  This was a good recipe and I will for sure use it again.

Delicious!  I was looking for a new way to cook beans, and this was it.    I made a few adjustments, cutting the flour and brown sugar for health reasons, decreasing the water to about 2/3 cup, using dry mustard instead of prepared mustard, and 2 tsp of sriracha chili sauce.  I also added about 1/2 tsp of cajun seasoning and a sauteed chicken breast.    I'll up the chili sauce a bit next time, as it didn't have quite as much heat as it could have, but I was worried about making it too spicy my first time making it.  The chicken was a nice addition, giving the dish some more texture, but it definitely doesn't need it.  I'll definitely be making this again, with or without chicken.

I just made this with the following additions / changes:  I browned 1/2 pound ground beef, then added the Trinity and garlic.  I used 1/4 tsp. dry mustard, ommitted the chili sauce, added 1/4 tsp. worcestershire sauce and hot sauce to taste (we like it hot).  YUMMY.

I rather enjoyed these.  Very flavorful and spicy, albeit a bit salty.  The tomato flavor was a bit too prevalent at first, but mellowed out when I went in for leftovers.  Thanks for the recipe! ^_^

We thought these were okay, but they didn't wow us.  I'm sure it is a fine recipe, it's just a personal taste.  This dish is a little too "beany" for me.

These are tasty.  I think that the serving size is way off.  As is, the recipe can feed closer to 16 people as a side dish.

Was a hit!  Something different but did do some changes to the recipe did not add chili sauce but instead added chili powder and did not put in the hot pepper sauce.  Did add a little more brown sugar and left it bake in oven for an hour. Was GREAT!!)

This was a good, hearty vegetarian dish. I served w/ fried green tomatoes and some crusty bread. It was a little sweet for my liking...but I guess I've never had creole beans. Next time I would decrease the brown sugar by half. In my opinion, this recipe serves 4 as a main dish.

These are good. I used a red bell pepper instead of green. The finished beans were a bit saucy - I would have added another can of beans if I had one, or cut down on the rest of the ingredients a bit. Good flavor - even better the next day. Thanks!

My family absolutely loved this recipe.  I used coctail sauce because I didn't have chili sauce and it was fantastic.  My 7 year old daughter stalked my son's plate for his leftovers.  Now there's a compliment.

This was so good!!!  I used frozen lima beans that I thawed in the microwave just because my grocery store didn't have canned butter beans.  I'm originally from Louisiana and have been searching for a lima bean recipe that tastes the way my mom's did.  These are better than hers!!
