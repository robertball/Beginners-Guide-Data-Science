This is a family favorite. I like to throw in some italian seasoning, sliced red pepper, add a little evaporated milk or cream cheese and a good amount of shredded parmesan cheese to make it creamy, if I have it on hand. Great quick dinner.

I enjoyed this, but I did make some changes.  I sauteed mushrooms with the garlic and onion.  I used fresh tomato rather than canned.  I added strips of red and yellow pepper.  I added Italian seasoning, garlic powder, a little crushed red peppper, and rosemary.  lol I guess I just used the recipe as a jumping off point, but it worked well!

I'm grateful that I read the other reviews first. This was an amazing, budget friendly, yet gourmet dish, with a couple adjustments. I didn't want the sauce thin and soupy, as the other reviewers mentioned, so I left out the chicken broth altogether. I also added cream cheese, as several others mentioned, to make a pink sauce, a creamy, tomato sauce. I swear, it's incredibly close to many gourmet dishes I've had in fancy Italian establishes. Being Italian myself, I'm very picky. I was truly amazed that this simply delicious meal came together to impress my family and friends so well.  I had my doubts all the way up until serving, when the sauce finally thickened on the noodles. It's a perfect dish with my two small adjustments based on the other reviews! I would've given 5 stars if it had listed these imperative changes. I, also, used ziti instead of linguine. It just seemed to fit and hold the sauce better.

I liked the flavors in this recipe, but there are problems with the ingredient proportions.  First of all, if I make this again, I will use less pasta and more broccoli.  The broccoli was a welcome addition to the heaviness of the sausage, and I wanted more broccoli and far less pasta.  Secondly, I use non-stick skillets to saute, and 3 Tablespoons of olive oil seemed excessive to me.  I cut back the olive oil to 2 teaspoons,and it was quite enough.  Also, I feel the cooking method could be streamlined.  Three pots are necessary if you prepare the way the recipe suggests.  In addition, the sauce is quite watery, so if your family is accustomed to a thicker sauce, you will need to make some adjustments here.  Since I used Johnsonville hot Italian sausage, the dish was quite flavorful.  I just feel this recipe is not quite ready for prime time.

I tweaked this recipe - a lot. But I loved the recipe in that it gave me some great ideas when I was having a hard time finding ways to use up what was in my fridge! Here's what I made: I started with a whole wheat spaghetti. I usually hate wheat pasta, but I didn't even notice that it was wheat, and neither did my husband! I added in turkey sausage, broccoli, peppers, onions, tomatoes, and lots of garlic and herbs. I didn't have any chicken broth, so I made a cream and red pepper puree that I added in to the pan. It was SOOO GOOD. I also made a basil-infused oil that I drizzled over the top. My husband has already asked me to make this again and it's been less than a week. Thanks Johnsonville for the idea!

I just made this and it was really good with a few changes. It was a little thin-sauced so I added one half brick of creme cheese, then when almost done made a cornstarch and water thickner, added a little milk and Italian seasonings to make one yummy dinner!

Easy to make and tasty but not anything interesting. I wish the sauce would have turned out thicker, it was a little too soupy. A nice alternative to spaghetti though.

I used tequila-lime chicken sausage and mushrooms and added about 3/4 brick of cream cheese to the liquid mixture before adding the pasta and broccoli.Very good. Very easy.

My family really liked the recipe only I added diced yellow peppers to onions and garlic along with half a block of cream cheese and Italian seasoning to sauce before adding items together.  Very good!

I added fresh spinach, a little rice vinegar, turbinado sugar and half a package of cream cheese. Finally I topped it with parmesan cheese. My family loved it, and I did too.

Very delicious and easy to make.  I tried adding fresh chopped Italian parsley.  DON'T!  lol.  It conflicts with the other flavors.  Leave as is.

My son went back for seconds! My family really enjoyed this dish. After tasting the sauce, I felt it needed a bit of tweaking.  I added a cup of heavy cream, 1 T. of Italian Seasoning, 1 tsp. of garlic powder. At the end I  thickened the sauce, by adding 2 T. of corn starch with a 1/4 cup of cold water.  Just add some garlic bread and a salad and you have a delicious dinner. I would certainly serve this dish again.

Made this with Johnsonville HOT Italian sausage instead of mild. Delicious! I think it wouldn't have been loved in this house as much without the extra kick! I also added a little bit more minced garlic and Italian seasoning. Tasted great with Barilla whole wheat linguine. Mushrooms and bell peppers would have been a welcome addition to this dish.

So I changed a few things because I used what I had in my house. I didn't have italian sausage I had brats so that's what I used. I didn't have sweet onions, I had regular onions. It tasted good but I'm sure it would have been better with the italian sausage and sweet onions.

I made this with a few alterations and it was still delicious. First, I used 1lb ground breakfast sausage and 1 boneless/skinless chicken breast, cubed, and cooked with Italian seasoning. I doubled the recipe, but used 1 fresh tomato and 1 can, fresh basil and macaroni noodles I stead of linguini because it's what I had on hand.

Very versatile and the kids loved it!

I notice everyone who loved the recipe changed it to their liking.  I made it according to the recipe and thought it was way too bland.  It needs something to make it memorable.  Chicken stock and tomatoes does not the best sauce make!

Pretty good as a base recipe. I added green peppers and omitted broccoli. Added smallest can of tomato sauce. And used mild Italian sausage and took out of casing and just broke up with a wooden spoon. I know I didn’t exactly follow original recipe, but it was really good

Great recipe... I just tweaked it a little. Instead of tomatoes I added 2 cans rotel, 1 can mushrooms, mozzarella, and shredded Velveeta. Then added a little more chicken broth to accommodate. Turned out AMAZING!

This was so easy and delicious! Let's just say there weren't any leftovers after dinner. I took the advice offered by quite a few reviewers, and added half a brick of cream cheese to the sauce before mixing in the noodles, sausage, or broccoli. It made the sauce thick and creamy, it was amazing. The only recommendation I have is it  may be best to steam the broccoli before adding it to the pasta, because I risked burning it to cook them and I eventually gave up.

Yes, I made some changes! Such as: threw in a package of sugar snap peas stir fry; red; yellow and green peppers; zucchini and pasta sauce. Did not use the chicken broth. Other than that, followed the recipe and it turned out really good! Will make again!

Saw this recipe and thought it would be a nice alternative to spaghetti and meatballs.  After making a few changes, I nixed the broccoli and added red bell pepper, plus added a little butter to sautéed onions and garlic, this recipe was really good...DELICIOUS and colorful too! Thanks for the idea!
