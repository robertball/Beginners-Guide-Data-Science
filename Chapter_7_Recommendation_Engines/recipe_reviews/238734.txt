I liked this recipe, although the chocolate coating calls for too much coconut oil. I would suggest reducing to 1 Tablespoon vs. 3 Tablespoons, otherwise most of the coating with puddle around the ball like mine did. I made a minor adjustment by using coconut butter in place of butter. The subtle coconut taste comes through perfectly. I would make these again!

very yummy, great for a sweet snack! however I had a problem with the chocolate. it turned out thin; either I mixed to much or put in to much oil. next time I'll do less. But they have excellent taste!

I liked this recipe as well but made a few minor adjustments that made it work with what I had on hand. Instead of coconut oil, I used a half teaspoon of coconut extract added to the chocolate chips and one tablespoon on vegetable shortening that I add microwaved for two minutes. I then stirred them together with the coconut extract added after microwaving. I also found the dipping amount short and made a half batch again. Again, thank you for this as my mother in law used to make something similar years ago and I lost the recipe.

They were good.  I used chocolate melting wafers... no coconut oil. By the way,  12 tbsp =3/4 cup so take out a tbsp from that.

Very yummy! I used chunky peanut butter (already had on hand) and milk chocolate. These were so quick to make and kids can make these on their own. I can see these will be made just as often as the no bake cookies!
