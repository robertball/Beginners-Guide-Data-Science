Great cake! I made my slits too big which made the cake break apart in the middle. After I added the toppings to the top it didn't look as bad. I will make sure that when I made the cake again to make the slits smaller. Tasted great, very moist. I saved a little of the chocolate frosting mixture for the top as well. The combination of the caramel and chocolate drizzle made a great look over the nuts and marshmallows. I will make this again!

Tastes good, but way too messy!!! If I made it again, I would just frost the cake normally and add caramel, nuts, and marshmallows on top of each slice.

Fun and fast to make. My 8 year old helped and we had a blast. Looks like a very expensive cake.

Wonderful cake!!!  I had some people over for a birthday dinner and they raved about it.  I didn't put much of the marshmallows on top, as it was perfect without it and looked beautiful.  Will definitely save this recipe for future use.

I had a hard time keeping it all together....my cake was lacking in presentation, but everyone loved it!  It was very moist and delicious.  The next time I make it I'll make sure to cut very small slits :)  Great Idea!
