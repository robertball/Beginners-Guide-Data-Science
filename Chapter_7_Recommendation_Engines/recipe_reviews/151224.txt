Very good recipe I have made corned venison for years with almost the same recipe.If you add salt peter the color will be neer the same as store bought corned beef.Use this same recipe then smoke the corned venison and you now have venison pastrami.

This was easy, and when I got done it tasted almost like corned beef!  It was amazing.  I used it to make corned venison sandwiches.  I would use it any way you would use corned beef.

I use the brine recipe and then make venison pastrami. After the 5 days, rinse the meat under cold water, pat dry. Use your hands to smear the roast with whole grain mustard. Shake on an even coating of ground black pepper and then a little granulated onion. Place the roast in a pan and then in a smoker at 275 degrees. I use hickory wood to smoke mine. The juices that gather in the pan will help keep it moist, add a little water if it starts to dry out in the pan while smoking. 4 to 5 hours until the internal temp is 165 degrees pull it out and let it rest 20 minutes. Thinly slice and enjoy

Used this last year for first time. Will use it every year !!! I made three roasts, no time to cook them so wrapped and froze. Gave to my son a few weeks later. Only got a spoon full!!!!! from the first one he made,him and his friends ate the rest. I think you will love this ,if you like corn beef.

I followed this recipe to a T up to the cooking method. I chose to cook mine in a slow cooker instead of the boiling method but only to play it safe. I have never boiled corned beef and didn't want to risk not liking it that way after I had spent 5 days "babysitting" it. This is an excellent way to use up venison that is taking space in the freezer. I still prefer beef over venison but that goes for all recipes and not just this one. If you are a hunter and you like corned beef, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed.

My husband's a hunter. It's hard for me to find recipes to use with what he brings home. I'm not crazy about game. I always keep the recipes that "fool" me into forgetting that I'm eating: deer, fish, bear, elk, etc. This recipe is awesome! I was skeptical about what this brine would really do. TRY IT! So tender and yummy! We put it on sandwiches w/swiss or provolone cheese and then grill the bread. Sooooo yummmmy!

Tried this last week...tastes just like corned beef!! I did the refrigeration out in the garage and with freezing temps, the center of the roast froze and didn't turn the red color. I'll be doing this again soon until I run out of venison!

A friend does this to the rump every year, and I just tried some. DELICIOUS! Like corned beef, but with no slimy gelatin. If we get a second deer this season, I will definitely do this!
Saltpeter (a nitrate) will keep it pink, like store-bought corned beef, but it's not really good for you. I won't use it, the pink color is not important to me.

I had no idea a venison roast would take to being corned so well.  WOW!!  Another great way to enjoy natures bounty.  Our little blacktail don't have very big shoulder roasts so I did a rump roast and it came out great.  Gave corned venison for X-mas presents last year and will be doing the same.

I didn't change any of the recipe other than I used a sturdy plastic bag to line a plastic pail. It made it easy to shake/flip the bag to mix the meat in the solution. With cooking I found a similar recipe for brisket, using a pressure cooker. I just thought boiling the meat took way too long (~4 hours!). I put the 2 pieces of deer shoulder  on the circular riser plate in the bottom of the pressure cooker, put water in to cover the meat. I figured 45 minutes  should work. It did! Turned out very flavorful, tender and nice reddish color to the meat.

Worked just like the recipe said it would, I did reserve the juice from cooking it to store the leftovers in so it would not dry out, but it lasted several days.  Will make it again.

I can not give this a fair star rating. But love the idea anyway. as of yet, because I haven't tried it. But I a glad to have found it and will be trying soon as I just uncrocked 5 gallons of fresh kraut..I normally make venison dried beef out of roasts but this give me another great option. As we love reubens . I have a question for those you use slow cooker. How hot and long do you do yours. I found the Beef stock instead of water very intriguing as well as going another step farther and creating pastrami

I have made this several times and think it is great. Nice and easy to do also. great chopped up with potatoes and onions to make a hash for breakfast.   Did two roasts in my last batch and froze one so I can try and make some pastrami when I have the time.

Followed this recipe exactly although I saw a comment about using slow cooker instead and I may try that next time around. It was a great way to utilize your game meat in a different way. I made Reuben sandwiches and family and friends loved it. Thank's for the recipe

This tastes just like corned beef. I made ruebens sandwiches for the family and they thought it was corned beef.
