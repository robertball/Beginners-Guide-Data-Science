I used Elk, Wild Boar and Chukar  that  my kids killed last hunting season,  homemade smoked and fresh  sausage and homemade sauerkraut,  it turned out FANTASTIC!!!!  I also used a  splash of some leftover white wine I had. I reheated it for dinner  two nights later when my daughter had a friend over after their school club meeting. Her friend never ate any game animals or sauerkraut before and loved it. ( three large helpings worth)  I recommend waiting a day or two to serve it.

1  1/2 stars, only because it was edible, just horrible.  I made this exactly as directions stated (minus prune) and am sad I wasted my time and more upset that I wasted so much meat that could have been made into much more appetizing dishes that would have been far less time consuming.   This is mediocre at best !

So so good! Followed the recipe to the letter with one exception, I added a small turnip. I was expecting it to taste krauty, but it doesn't. The flavor is wonderful!! I simmered it on low for about 3 hours and let it sit overnight. Will definitely make again!! I'm going to try it in the slow cooker.

Iâ€™m giving it four stars based on my first time ever making it and having no idea what to expect. I think it might be a 5 Star the next time.
