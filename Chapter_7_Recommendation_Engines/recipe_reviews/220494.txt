I only made one change and that was using chopped pecans in the bread only because we don't care for walnuts. I did up the pecans to a full cup because I wanted to sprinkle some chopped nuts on top. I made muffins out of this recipe instead of one big loaf. I was able to get 18 muffins out of one recipe. I baked my muffins at 350* for almost 22 minutes. These muffins were moist, chewy, flavorful and all around just WONDERFUL. One of the best pumpkin quick breads I've ever made. I'll make this one again.

This was just OK. Not great. 
I have used other recipes in the past that I liked better.
The batter was very, very thick, so it took longer than the suggested time to cook. I didn't use the Chinese Five-Spice powder. I used Nutmeg instead. The pumpkin flavor wasn't strong enough for my taste. A good starting off point for pumpkin bread, but needs lots of tweaks.

Just took this out of the oven & had to taste it. It is scrumptious! Granted, I didn't use the the Chinese spice either, just went with what I had on hand, which was pumpkin pie spice, I used 3 tsp of it. The rest of the recipe I kept the same . The reason I wanted to use this recipe is, it only makes one loaf. It is SO moist and just wonderful. Mine didn't turn out as high as in the pic above, but nonetheless, a wonderful pumpkin bread recipe, delicious. Thank you!

Great recipe! I've made this a couple of times and comes out perfect each time. I do put a little ginger in instead of the Chinese spice because I don't have that in my stock. I also do chocolate chips because my hubby likes it better than nuts.

This recipe caught my eye because it has less sugar than other recipes and the addition of Chinese 5-Spice as an ingredient.  This is a spice I really like and use regularly in stir-fry cooking, and what a great addition to a sweet bread recipe!  Anyway, I made this exactly according to the directions.  Turned out moist, delicious, and with great flavor.  The batter is THICK, so at first I thought I left out some critical liquid ingredient.  Not so.    The bread is not overly sweet, which I love.  The boyfriend liked it very much.  As usual, Chef John has it going on!

Made it a second time using toasted pecans and  "heaping" amounts of the cinnamon, Chinese 5 spice, and all spice.  Brought it to Thanksgiving for a breakfast bread.  Everyone loved it!

I made this vegan by using one mashed banana and a 1/2 cup applesauce in place of the eggs, and of course Earth Balance for butter... turned out great!

This recipe is great!  I made a couple of changes:
1 c All Purpose White Flour, 
1 c Whole Wheat Flour, 
1/4 c 2% milk, 
2 TBSP Land O'Lakes Olive Oil Margarine in addition to the butter, 
1 TBSP Olive Oil.  
I added the liquids because using whole wheat has a tendency to make recipes dry.  The bread turned out very moist. I did use the Chinese Five Spice.  I also omitted the nuts.  Next time I will add those.  It took 1hr to bake.  I used a 9X9 brownie pan instead of a regular loaf pan.

I love pumpkin and I always look for recipes on pumpkin! This is definitely a good choice for your family. I made some changes on the recipe by replacing all-purpose flour to wholewheat flour, adding about 1/4 cup of milk into the pumpkin purée (to add some moist to the bread). I also replaced walnut with pumpkin seed (I ran out of walnut) and bake it in a bear muffin tray. My three-year old boy loves it very much.

Thanks Chef John!! 
Loved this as I am not a fan of pumpkin bread with oil.  I did not have 5  Chinese spice so I did this with some ginger, nutmeg and pumpkin pie spice with the cinnamon.    Also used pecans since I didn't have walnuts.  Was so yummy and moist.

My Family and I loved this recipe, it was a huge hit.  The changes I made were: Didn't have Chinese 5 spice powder so I used 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger - next time I will use 1/2 tsp of each. I also roasted pecans instead of walnuts, and last I used fresh pumpkin b/c I had some left over but will try canned next batch.  This recipe is a keeper for sure, the only thing you need to know & from reading other reviews I can concur is that it takes an additional 30 minutes to bake - such a no big deal, everyone's oven is different.

This is great just as it is.  That said, I typically I like more flavor and/or texture than how most recipes are written and I am not "Joe the Baker" or "Kenny the Cook", so I like simpler easier recipes.  I'm on kind of a Medieval kick (especially meat pies) and like to use ingredients (if I have them) that might be from history.  i've made this several times with variations: using partial or all rye flour, double the nuts, using almonds and dates and substituting brown sugar, honey and blackstrap molasses for the white sugar as well as using pumpkin pie spice instead of straight cinammon.  I use Kashmir Garam Masala instead of chinese five spice.  Point is that this recipe is really good as is or can be the springboard to creating something of your own.

Liked this recipe because of the moistness and richness of using 1 can of pumpkin for 1 loaf. Substituted my own spices: 1/2 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ground ginger, 1/4 tsp. allspice, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg. Also added 1/2 cup pumpkin seeds I had on hand with a few sprinkled over the top. Perfectly moist without being greasy. Great flavor.

I always make this. I don't use the Chinese 5 spice or all spice. I use 1 tsp of Epicure's Gingerbread spices and cinnamon. It gives it an extra kick of flavor and is always a hit. I also add a cup of raisins to the mix and leave out the nuts for the kids to take to school.

This was a very easy recipe. I did substitute the Chinese spice with Pumpkin Pie spice. And since the kids don't like nuts I added raisins. It was wonderful.

I made it (multiple times).  This is the one pumpkin bread i can get my husband to eat.  I split the sugar -half normal-half Splenda.  It was fantastic. 
Thanks Chef John!  If you have a lower carb suggestion please speak up.  We are a house hold of diabetics who can’t give up breads ...

Made this for the  first time last week, using all ingredients as listed. It was delicious! A new favorite!

 We like a like a little more spice, so will adjust accordingly next time we make this (which will be soon!). As noted by a few others, needed to increase the baking time by about 30 minutes.

Better then any other pumpkin bread recipe I’ve tried, will definitely make again. Wonderfully moist, fluffy and not too sweetness. I made to the recipe except sub walnuts for semi-sweet chocolate chips.

Such a beautiful recipe. I made 10 jumbo muffins, baking them for 25 minutes. I always double (at least) the spices in any spice cake, but that's just my personal preference. I also used half coconut sugar, and half raw sugar, and topped it off with cream cheese frosting. I will be making this again!

Excellent recipe.  Added extra spice and used fresh pumpkin. The only problem I had was after slicing it would fall apart when picked up. Needed to eat with a fork. Maybe it was the fresh pumpkin. i WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN, GREAT FLAVOR.

Baked for 1 hour 15 minutes to get it to internal temp of 200. Lined my loaf pan with parchment and it came out great.  I gave it 4 stars because I probably will increase the sugar a little next time and skip the Chinese five spice (didn't like the taste).

A little too sweet for our taste. I will use less sugar next time.

I followed Sarah Jo’s recommendations and used lots of pecans and made as muffins.  They were a hit at work!  Finally a use for the Chinese Five Spice in my pantry.Thank goodness everyone said the batter would be thick!  They were not kidding!  Almost as thick as cookie dough.

I substituted chopped pecans for the walnuts because of a taste preference, otherwise I made the recipe exactly as written.  It was delicious!  Even my husband, who doesn’t normally like anything with pumpkin, tried it and loved it!

This is a very nice loaf.  I used raisins instead of nuts and 2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice instead of the Chinese spice.  It's very moist and has a nice flavour.  It does take about 20 minutes longer to bake than the recipe indicates as other reviewers have said.

Even though I used brown sugar rather than white this was quite bland. I did not have all the spices but I used my usual pumpkin pie spices. It just tasted too much like flour. It also needed an additional 15 minutes in the oven using a glass pan.

This bread is moist and has wonderful texture.  I seldom change a recipe the first time I use it, but I wasn't in the mood for Chinese 5 spice.  Instead I used 1 tsp cinnamon; 1 tsp nutmeg; 1/2 tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp ginger.  I also had to bake it  a hour and a half, but that's what toothpicks are for, right?  I'll probably make it as written next time.
*******
I've made this bread several times ingredients as written by Chef John.  The flavor is wonderful!   The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 star recipe it the baking  temp and time.

I made this with gluten-free one-to-one all purpose baking flour, and it turned out really well. I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup, and put in raisins instead of walnuts as we can't do nuts. My daughter was co-cooking, so some measurements were less than perfect... but this recipe withstood the damage :) Delicious flavor. Will use in lunch boxes during the holiday season. Thanks for a great recipe!

I found I needed another 10 minutes (and perhaps a bit more) cooking time in the oven.  Still, it was tasty.  Thanks, Chef John!

I used 2 cups of puréed pumpkin that I had frozen from roasting pumpkins at Halloween time, omitted the walnuts, and added 1/3 cup flour to account for the extra liquid.  I live in Boulder at higher altitude, so I baked the loaf for 1hr20min and it was perfect!  I will certainly be using this recipe again.

I made several changes to this recipe, I added 1/4 cup coconut oil, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp cloves and a touch extra cinnamon.  I didn't have any nuts so just put the last of some white chocolate chips I had.  This came out extremely moist and the flavor was amazing.  I really think the Chinese 5 spice really adds that extra something special.  I use it for all my pumpkin related recipes since I first made chef John's pumpkin pie couple years ago.  It just works.  If I were to change anything, I would use maybe a touch less baking powder because although it's nice and light, it was a little too fragile.  I didn't think it would be because the batter is thick and heavy but it is very light and airy.  Adding coconut oil adds moisture.  Overall very nice flavor.

For those not using Chinese 5-spice, you are missing out!  I bought it for Chef John's Pumpkin Pie recipe and it was THE BEST pie I have ever had!  The bread is  delicious without being overly-spicy, which allows the flavor of the pumpkin to really shine.  Yum!  I love Chef John's recipes as he tends to use less sugar than most.

This is a very moist quick bread.  The pumpkin flavor doesn't come through so much, I believe due to all the walnuts.  Next time, I will put half the walnut in the mix, or eliminate them for more pumpkin flavor.

This was just wonderful! The only change I made was using my own frozen pumpkin purée from last summer. (Thawed and well drained) I've never used it for anything except pie, but I sure will now that I have such an easy and yummy bread recipe. So glad I found this recipe??

Excellent.  The only changes I made is that I used slivered almonds as I did not have any walnuts and I left out the Chinese Five Spice and added a little more cinnamon instead.  Very moist and yummy.

Overall pretty good. First time I made it, very underseasoned.  Second time I used double to triple the spices (2x with heaping spoonfuls).  Much much better.  I skipped nuts the first time and added them the second time but they didn't make much difference to me.  Makes pretty good mini-muffins as well--took them to a tailgate and I looked like a total rockstar with them.  Super easy to make and taste delicious (especially with double spices!).

Didn't have the Chinese spice so I doubled the allspice. It's a good texture but I wish it were a tad sweeter. Next time I might add more sugar.

I found this to be very bland.  It was edible, but the appearance was pretty ugly, so there's no way I would serve it to guests or bring it to a potluck.  I do like the combination of spices because it's different from your typical nutmeg and cinnamon pumpkin bread.

This was delicious! I made a few changes; substituted flour with Gluten Free Flour, substituted Chinese 5 spice powder with ground cloves & added 1/3 cup of milk & 1 tsp of vanilla when doubling the recipe. It yielded 8 mini loaves on 350 not 325 for 45-50 min. I also live in high altitude, (5,000 feet above sea level). I used my own pumpkin puree and I also did not use any nuts. Let cool 5 min then dump loaf onto plastic wrap & wrap up, this keeps it very moist.
To make puree scrape the pumpkin out, line a pan with heavy duty foil, smear butter on foil, and then cut into 4 large pieces and bake on 350 until you can pierce the flesh easily with a knife(around 1hr covered), let it cool down to handle, scoop out or slice flesh off. Puree in a food processor. Remember to double the puree if doubling recipe.

Average quick bread. Bakes fine in just over an hour. spices were good and was moist. something about the flavor left me wanting to search for a different pumpkin bread recipe. Perhaps was a bit too paste-y or dough-y for me.
