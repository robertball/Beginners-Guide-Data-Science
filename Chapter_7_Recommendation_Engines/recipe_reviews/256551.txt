OMG this is good. The method works exactly as written. I used agave syrup instead of brown sugar and used a bit more Sriracha than written. I left out the garlic.  I also added some cauliflower to the pan seeing that Sriracha and cauliflower are BFF. Thank you for this perfect recipe!

This is a keeper especially for Sriracha Fans.  You gotta love spicy.  We will be making this in our family quite a long time. .

If you love spice, this is it! Made it in my black frying pan, went right into the oven and was unbelievable! Ice cream after cools the pipes, so enjoy the ride on this one! Next time we are going to put it on the grill and see how it turns out. Also thought any leftovers would be good on a toasted bun with a pineapple slice!

I have made this twice.  The first time as written and I found it a bit oily and a tad spicy.  The second time I added a couple of extra potatoes (to give my partner's mother for a weekly meal) and added only 1/4 cup sriracha sauce then topped with maple syrup to make 1/3 cup of liquid.  Came out very well with no oily texture and a hint of spicy/sweet.  I will definitely make it again with my modifications.

I only had sweet potatoes and no onions, so I cooked more peppers.  It was really delicious!  I would probably dial back the brown sugar next time, but not by much.  Outstanding dish!!

We made this with chicken breasts so it was a bit dry. The sauce was good but a bit spicy, we probably needed more chicken for the amount of sauce. Veggies were good, they carmelizes a bit in the sauce.

I doubled the amount of sauce because I used 6 chicken thighs. I increased the vegetables a little bit because of the extra chicken too. I definitely recommend everything prepped ahead of time. Served with basmati rice.
I had to substitute the brown sugar with white sugar and molasses, because I didn't have any, but it was delicious.

Loved it!  Would probably add even more veggies next time.... carrots or turnips?
Definitely will be adding this to our regular dinner rotation.

One of the best meals I've made from Allrecipes! Wow! Made exactly as written, except I added green peppers to existing ingredients.  I may add some cauliflower next time, as well. Sriracha may be a little hot for some, but this family likes it hot!

I loved this--but the caveat is that I really enjoy spicy food. The rest of my family found it too spicy for their liking. If you like Sriracha, this is definitely for you. I made it just as described but used a dutch oven with no lid instead of a cast iron pan.

It's delicious, but for me, it's a tad spicy. Any suggestions on how to reduce the heat on this dish without losing volume on the sauce so I can still cover the chicken? Would half ketchup, half sriracha work?

Loved it!!  My husband too!  I skipped the vegetables this time. I made mac n cheese with it in case it was too spicy for my husband. It wasn't though!  We're so trying it on ribs too!

Very good! I made a few personal changes to this delightful recipe. I used only 1/4 cup of siracha instead of the 1/3 cup. Also, I used russet potatoes, broccoli,  and  yellow onions because that is what I had on hand.  It came out too greasy, but that was my fault because I didn't drain the pan after browning the chicken.  I did have to cut the potatoes in to small pieces because they would be under-cooked if I didn't. Next time, I will use skinless thighs. All in all, it was a very tasty dish!

Amazing and easy recipe! My only suggestion is watch how hot your pan is before placing the first butter for the chicken. Also, I used boneless skinless thighs

I've made this about 10 times, and it is one of my family's favorite dishes.  The only thing I started doing differently is to roughly double the veggies. If I know we have a guest who can't do spicy, I back off the Sriracha just a tad, but this really isn't too spicy.

This had amazing flavor that permeated the veggies perfectly!  The sauce carmelized a bit and was excellent.  Didn't change a thing.

This was great! Nice balance of sweet and spicy. I used half siracha and half siracha mayo for the spicy element. Husband has already requested I make this recipe again! .

Made this last night. My husband and brother-in-law loved it! So did I! I get to eat the leftovers tonight! Easy recipe, if you can get someone to cut up the veggies, it’s incredibly easy.
I would not consider it too spicy, the brown sugar mellows it out. I’m a huge onion fan so added more. Otherwise the same! Try it, I think you’ll like it!

I made just chicken since I didn’t have potatoes handy.  My kids are picky eaters, but they love spicy Sriracha foods so I gave it a try. It was a hit with the family!

I modified the recipe a bit for who I cook for; the chicken thighs are tender and perfect for the recipe.  Just the right amount of kick!

I really really loved this dish! Made exactly as directed first time, no changes. SOOO good, everyone liked it. 5 stars. Didn't find too hot or too sweet...just perfect. Second time I wanted more healthy veggies, so I used sweet potatoes and added a cup of corn. Even better the second time! Six stars haha.

We really enjoyed the sweet spicy sauce with the chicken and veggies, but after a while we found ourselves looking for some variety.  It needs a bright acidic side or salad to provide balance and a break from the heavy richness

I made this for two with chicken breast instead of thighs and it went down spectacularly. I used a lot less brown sugar (just a personal preference) and used whatever vegetables I had on hand. I will definitely make this again, and it tastes a lot less spicy after the first mouthful!

Made this with skinless breasts instead of thighs with skin. It was outstanding.  We love spicy foods. So, I added a sliced fresh jalapeno right before it went in the oven. That gave it a very nice kick.

This one's going to be a regular.

This dish turned out really well!! I LOVE sriracha sauce, and the brown sugar made the flavor pop full of spicy sweetness ???? I placed the chicken on a bed of Jasmine rice and a side of cabbage. Cornbread too!! It was soooo bomb!!

This was awesome!  I taste tested the sriracha/brown sugar before adding it and decided it might be a little too spicy for the kids so added a little soy sauce and honey to cool it down.  I think the recipe would have been fine without the addition of you like heat, though.  I used sweet potatoes instead of potatoes and it was fantastic.  I also added greens beans  - gave it some more texture and a little green.

Incredible.  My honey can't stop eating it.  I add a bag of mixed frozen stir fry mix or california blend for a more complete meal.  Can be transfered to a slow cooker and finished off on low for 3-4 hours.

I loved it!  Will absolutely do again. Very easy to make, co-workers loved the smell of it. Next time I would put more veggies in. Very, very good!

FINE  Felt for a fast sriracha flavored meal tonight. Flavour was there. Potatoes need to be pre- cooked a bit. Not quite done because I did not want to dry out chicken. Also a little blackish 
after oven cooking because of pan scrapings. Flavour there though.

This was fantastic! If you like Sriracha, you'll love this. I thought it would be too spicy when putting it together but it ended up milder than I expected (its still got a kick so if you don't like spicy food, not for you). I made this a second time and used different vegetables since I didn't have potatoes and it was just as good.

Very good dish but just a little spicy.  Next time I'll use less sriracha sauce and possibly olive oil instead of butter.
