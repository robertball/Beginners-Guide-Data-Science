I love this recipe.  I did end up making some changes based on other reviews and I have made this at least four times already.  I am not a huge zucchini eater, and this makes the veggie yummy.  Here are the changes I have made.
1.I use panko flakes in breading the chicken and sprinkle the chicken w/ Italian Seasoning II on this site. When I brown the chicken, I also throw in two cloves of minced garlic.  2. I do not saute the zucchini, instead I rub some olive oil over it (make sure to cut in big chunks) and then sprinkle some Italian seasoning over it and then some salt, followed by the bread crumbs.  3.  After I saute the chicken I throw 1/4 cup of diced onion and 1 diced red bell pepper into the pan and saute until they are soft.  Then I place this on top of the zucchini after the bread crumbs, then I place 1/2 a tomato, sliced and then the mozzarella and finally the chicken.  Always turns out fantastic.  Big hit w/ hubby.

The chicken was very moist, tender and tasty. The zucchini was overcooked, however. I think next time I will try it without sauting the zucchini first and see if it comes out better. Start to finish was closer to 1-1/2 hours, but then I am a bit slow:-) Overall, a good recipe and a keeper.****UPDATE**** I fixed this again. I put the zucchini in the pan raw and the zucchini turned out much better that way (it wasn't overcooked). Plus, it didn't take as long to prepare :-) I will continue to do this dish. Thanks again for the recipe!

Excellent recipe!  I took the suggestions of others and only sauteed the zucchini very briefly: just a minute or enough to coat the zucchini in the olive oil.  I used plain bread crumbs made from toasted bread, dried basil (about 1-2 tsp) mixed with freshly grated mozzarella, and fresh heirloom tomatoes. It turned out really well.  A very healthy meal that I will definitely make again.  Thank you!

This is a great recipe, the one thing I did differently was I used canned tomatoes with an Italian seasoning, it gave the whole dish a little more flavor. Also, I always marinate chicken in Italian dressing to give it some extra moisture and flavor, because I did this I did not need the egg mixture, I just dipped the marinated chicken in the bread crumbs.

Really hearty and delightful! I added sauteed portabello mushroom, garlic, & sliced onion in between the tomato and chicken layers. Had to cook in the oven for roughly 45 minutes...but I think that was because my breasts were big. (In food terms, not in my own body terms...sadly.)

Quite tasty. I added some garlic, used canned italian diced tomatoes and went lighter on the cheese. Really pretty dish with all the colors. I also didn't pre cook the zucchini and it came out perfectly. Just enough bite left to it.

I loved this dish! I made this for my boyfriend who normally isn't too fond of vegetables, but he ate it all up. I thought the recipe called for too many zucchinis, so I just put 3 in the dish. I was wrong. Definitely use all 5 because the zucchini is one of the best parts. It soaks all the juices!! Yummy!
Also, I only baked the chicken about 20 minutes because I had the thinly cut chicken breasts.

Thanks for the recipe!  I thought the chicken was delicious but I felt like the zucchini needed a little more flavor & yes, like those who reviewed it before had said, the zucchini was overdone.  Next time I will not saute the zucchini and I will add some garlic, onions, plus a little salt & pepper to the zucchini layer.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very easy, and quick.  I halved the recipe so we'd have a perfect amount for my bf and I for dinner.  It really was the perfect amount, with 2 servings of veggies for us.  I didn't fry the zucchini and have to agree with most of the other reviewers who said it would be mushy if it is fried.  As it was, it was perfectly cooked.  I don't think I'll use the egg with the chicken next time--just season and dip in bread crumbs, as the chicken we use has more water in it and does not usually need the egg.  Otherwise, we loved it.  Thanks!

I used both yellow and green squash, but also added half a sliced sweet onion and about 4oz. of sliced baby portabellas mushrooms, that I needed to use up. Used fresh basil and oregano from my garden. I didn't pre-cook or oil the vegetables, and they turned out perfect. I also marinated my chicken breast all day in Italian dressing. I had some thick breast so cooked covered with foil and baked for thirty min. at the specified 400. Served with some white buttered rice. The chicken was so moist and tender The juices of the fresh tomatoes and chicken drip down into the zucchini mixture to make some of the most amazing tasty squash you've ever had. The fresh herbs, onions and mushrooms were a great addition for flavor.  My whole family loved it.

I thought this was" just okay", but my husband LOVED it! I did use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs, to which I added a Tbsp. of garlic powder and a handful of grated Parmesan, and after reading all the reviews, I decided NOT to saute the zucchini and sliced them a good half inch thick. They came out perfect... thanks, guys for all the input. In any event, he says I can make this anytime I want, so that's good enough for me. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to add garlic to the zucchini, and maybe add a bit of freshly snipped oregano with the basil. Served with Zippy Rice Pilaf and a cucumber-corn salad. Thanks for a great recipe, Sheryl!

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS RECIPE! I actually adjusted the recipe based on reviews on it. I did some prep early, skipped the egg mixture & marinated the chicken (3 breasts= 1.4 lbs)in light creamy italian dressing for a few hours. I used 3 zucchini & 3 yellow squash. I tossed them into a container & drizzled e.v.o.o. over it & shook up the container to coat.    Like above, I browned the chicken on bothsides, then removed it from skillet. I then sauteed up 3/4 of a white onion w some minced garlic then set aside... Then I threw the zucchini/squash into the pan long enough to add a lil more olive oil & some lemon pepper. Dues to having small mouths to feed, I quartered the zucchini/squash lengthwise then sliced about 1/4-1/2" thick. same with the 3 on-the-vine tomatoes. I'd coated the baking dish w e.v.o.o. spray. Layer 1) zucchini/squash, 2)panko, 3)onions/garlic, 4)mozzarella, 5) tomatoes, 6)paprika & dill, 7)parmesan cheese, 8)chicken. We forgot to cover it 20 into baking. Covered it w tin foil for 10 min & it was done perfectly. I will definitely be playing with this recipe for a long time. Hope this helps someon else as much as everyones reviews helped me! Thanks all!

Very Yummy!  I did add garlic powder to the egg mixture as another reviewer suggested and quite a bit more basil as also suggested.  The other alteration I made was that I used an entire 16oz. package of fresh mozzarella cheese which I sliced.  Wow!  So good!!!  Served with a side of rice and you've got a meal!  My only reason for giving it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the zucchini was a little too mushy.  Next time, I won't saute very long at all.  Overall, this is a keeper!

Excellent! Terrific use for zucchini and tomatoes from the garden. I used Panko bread crumbs and added garlic powder to the egg mixture and to the zucchini while it was cooking. I also used about 3  times the amount of fresh basil than called for. Sooo tasty; I will definitely makea gain. Thanks! :)

I cut the chicken into smaller pieces to suit my children better.  I also chunked the zuccini, coated in olive oil and didn't saute.  I added Italian seasoning  to the bread crumbs.  I upped the amount of fresh basil by quite a lot, since I love basil and I have a massive plant.  I also did not use the cheese as I don't eat dairy, but it was great without.  My entire family loved every bit!

This recipe was great...much better than expected!  I did make a few tweaks.  I added onions to the zucchini and sauteed, adding garlic powder. I loved the flavor of the basil (i added fresh oregano too). Instead of regular breadcrumbs, I used Panko breadcrumbs instead. It gave it an extra little crunch. I was so impressed by all of the flavors!! I will definitely make it again! :)

This was so yummy! I added garlic salt on top of cheese and added mushrooms too. I didn't have fresh basil so I used basil flakes. I don't usually like cooked tomatoes but I ate it all, loved the way zuchinni turned out too.

I followed what many other reviewers said and did not saute the zucchini first. I just put it directly into a casserole dish greased with olive oil. I also sprinkled the zucchini with a little Italian seasoning and just a little minced garlic, then followed the recipe from there on exactly. I used fresh zucchini, fresh basil, plus fresh red and yellow tomatoes from the family garden. This was SO good, I wish I had more for lunch tomorrow but it was all cleaned out by the family and left the plates licked and empty! Yum!!!

I saw this twist and fell in love.  I did make a few changes. Since most of the time my chicken breasts are frozen, I brine them in salt and garlic granuales, this time 24 hours. I used our favorite Italian bread as the bread crumbs .  3 end pieces processed fine.  I used a purchased Italian blend of cheese and in the last 10 minutes I added greek feta and calamaira olives(sp) and some more italian cheese mix.
I served this on top of Orzo that was boiled in water infused with chicken base.
I will put this in my rotation.  I can not stress enough the process of brining a marvelous flavor enhancer.

Made exactly to recipe.  (always do the first try)  Chicken was awesome.  Vegs a little bland.  Next time will try some onion and maybe garlic with the zuchinni.  Chicken a little underdone.  Will try pounding the chicken to flatten next time. No nutrition info so figured it out on the weight watchers e tools site.  12 points on the points plus plan for 1 cxhicken breasts and 1/4 of the veggies.  (this using low fat mozarella)

I did a rendition of this. Except instead of tomatoes, I used eggplant, and instead of mozzarella, I used Parmesan.  I added a pinch of salt, pepper, Tony Chachere's, garlic and onion powder to the egg. I added those same seasonings to the breadcrumbs, but included a tbsp of Parmesan as well.   I also added a tbsp of butter to the heating olive oil.  When I put the chopped veggies in the baking pan, I bathed them in the above mentioned seasonings and 2 tbsp of olive oil, and also sage and basil.  I also sprinkled all of the veggies with some Parmesan and breadcrumbs.  I cooked it for five minutes long just to make sure all the veggies were cooked and once they were, I sprinkled the entire dish with a little more Parm (we're cheese lovers in this family).  

It was so good!  Could probably use some tweaking here there.  I was just messing around since I didn't want to add tomatoes and needed to get rid of an eggplant before it went bad. Plus I just love all the Italian cheeses in any good zucchini or eggplant dish.  My husband who is a nay say of vegetables loved it, so that means something. lol  All in all, great dish!

Quite good!
We added yellow summer squash and some onions to the zucchini, only sauteeing the onions. Next time Ill sprinkle some salt and pepper on the veggies before the breadcrumbs. I served it with wild rice.

I have a garden and was looking for something to make with fresh zucchini and tomatoes.  This was perfect.  It does need some additional spices though, and will try to figure it out next time.  With all the juices this dish makes, I think a little angle hair pasta would be good too.

Chicken was a little bland.  Also the bread on the bottom of the chicken stuck to the cheese and kind of just turned to mush from the "zucchini water" as well.  Flavor was nice on the veggies BUT that's because I added some Italian seasoning.  Sorry but I had to doctor this up a bit and still could have used more.

Even though I only had Parmesan cheese not Mozzarella, it was a big hit with my husband. I added onion and garlic for flavor. As per other reviews, I just tossed the zucchini for a minute in the skillet with the olive oil, and it was not over cooked. The chicken was really tasty and moist (used Panko). Great recipe!! UPDATE: Oh...it's so much better with Mozzarella cheese!!! Did every thing the same as before...absolutely delicious. Thanks for a great recipe!!

I took Spiceymom's advice (I used crushed saltines instead of panko breadcrumbs though) and this came out absolutely amazing! I'm a new wife and moved across the country from my family and friends with my husband, so I have been relying heavily on allrecipes.com for meals. It was even great the next day heated up. thanks for the great recipe and great advice!

Baked Chicken & Zucchini Haiku: "Bright colors, yummy! Great use for garden veggies. I would make again." This was a simple and lovely dish. Lots of liquid at the bottom, so I wish that I'd made some garlic bread to soak up all the juice. I followed the recipe as written, except halving it, and using Italian-seasoned breadcrumbs, and 3 of us, 1 of whom was a small child, ate the whole thing. It would've been nice if the author had clarified as to what heat the skillet should've been for browning the chicken, b/c I wasn't really sure how much it should be cooked prior to it going in the oven. This entree was a fantastic reason to start yanking tomatoes, zucchini and basil from my summer garden, and I'll be glad to make it again, although I think next time, I'll increase the basil, and add some minced garlic.

I followed using many of the suggestions from other contributors.  I would agree that you should not cook the zucchini first.  It cooks perfectly when cut in large chunks and placed under the other ingredients.

Very good and healthy dish.  For the bread crumbs, I crushed garlic focaccia croutons.  This really upped the flavor.  I used parmesan instead of mozzerella.  I didn't sautee the zucchini long at all, but I added 10 minutes to the bake time so it would all get done.  My husband really liked this.  Served with a Caesar salad.

YUM!!!!  I read a few of the other reviews before making this and I did follow a piece of advice that was shared.  I only briefly sauteed the zucchini before putting it into the casserole pan.  This dish is SO GOOD and the chicken comes out so tender and juicy.  I love the flavors of the zucchini, tomato & basil together.  I did use panko bread crumbs to add a little more crunch to the chicken.  I invited my parents over for dinner & made this dish!! Everyone raved!  I will certainly be making this again...and again...etc!!!

My husband and I really enjoyed these with a few minor changes (with the changes it's a 5).  It would have been slightly bland as is.  I used whole wheat Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I like spicy but I refrained from using red pepper flakes but next time, I will definitely add them.   I took others' suggestions and added half an onion sliced, Italian seasoning on the veggies, mixed light olive oil with the veggies in the baking dish, and three cloves of minced garlic (half while cooking the chicken and the other half in baking dish). I didn't measure out the remaining 1/4 tsp of salt but I know that I used more (which wouldn't have been enough for the veggies by the way). There's no need to saute the zucchini as others have suggested, it's just an extra unnecessary step.  Overall, a very good easy dish and I'll be making this often.

Needs more flavor (and I spiced it up beyond what was called for)  The chicken was tender and the veggies were nice if you just aded them without sauteing them first but overall a little bland.

This was really good!  I did have some changes though - I used panko breadcrumbs, I did not cook or rub oil on the zucchini (just put it on the bottom of the pan), I also did not put any cheese on top of the chicken.  This was easy and pretty healthy.

YUMMY!!! I made this for company this weekend. I used chicken thighs ~~~~ everyone went nuts over this and wanted the recipe. My thighs where quite large and I had to bake it a little longer. (15 min) I did follow as the recipe as per suggested, except that I marinated my chicken in Italian Dressing for 6 hours before I started. My hubby, my parents and my in-laws wanted to know if I would make it soon again and my mother-in-law said this would be fitting for a 5***** Restaurant ~~ Thank you

This was a great dish...I did make some changes as follows:
Did not bread the chicken.  Instead, browned the pieces in a skillet with EVOO, salt & pepper & a pasta seasoning mix from Penzey's.  I made my own bread crumbs by grinding up two sour dough English muffins in my mini food processor & then toasted them in the  oven.  I oiled the baking dish, put a layer of raw zucchini (about 1/2" thick) on bottom, a layer of sliced tomatoes (about 1/2"), about 1 1/2 cups of sliced onion that I  sauteed with the chicken along with 2 tsps. of minced garlic (store bought in a jar).  I spread onion mixture on top of tomatoes, sprinkled vegies with pasta seasoning then half the muffin crumbs (made 2 dishes), about a cup of mozzarella/pizza blend cheese and then placed the browned chicken pieces on top of the vegies. Sprinkled some EVOO over all vegies before adding chicken.  I  baked it for about 40 minutes at 375 degrees, then removed from oven and covered lightly with foil while I  waited for baked potatoes to finish (another 15 minutes).  When they were done, I  turned the oven off and put the chicken back in the oven for about 5-10 minutes while I set the table.  There were five of us for dinner and I got rave reviews from everyone...even the non- vegie eating person.  Served with a romaine salad with ranch dressing, baked potatoes and ice cream with fresh strawberries & raspberries mixed with a tablespoon of sugar and about an 1/8 cup of orange liquer.  Awesome!

Such a GREAT recipe.  I called it "summer chicken parmesan", as the squash, heirloom tomatoes and basil all came out of the garden.  My entire family devoured it - including my 10 year old son who asked for seconds.  I made the squash (larger than regular zucchini) the same way as I prepared the chicken for an added flavor and it was great.  They stayed crispy and the tomatoes and basil added a fresh 'summer' taste.  This will be a return and devour many, many times to come! :)

Good, but seemed to be missing something, but I don't know what the something is.  Will do again, but I will play around with some spices

My husband and I thought this recipe was delicious!  Next time I will try not cooking the zucchini as long, if at all.  We will also add mushrooms, onions, and garlic.  We loved it so much we sent it out to our family and friends!

I made this last night and just put it in my recipe box, as I will definitely be making it again.  I added onions to the pan and only sautéed zucchini for a short time.  Served with wild rice.  VERY GOOD!!

So good! I didn't saute the zucchini either as some of the others suggested. I made 2 of these casseroles, one using canned chicken dumped on top of the zucchini. It's a quicker version and still very tasty. I will be making this again for sure.

Wasn't sure what to make for dinner last night & I came across this recipe & figured I'd give it a try. The directions seemed simple enough, & they truly are. I give it 5 stars because of how simple it is to make, the taste was fabulous (my wife REALLY loves it & couldn't wait to have it for leftovers again today) and it didn't take long to cook it. Give it a try & see what you think, you can always change it up to your liking. I actually used squash along with the zucchini.

Really really good.  I love that this is a lighter option, and honestly the zucchini in this recipe has more flavor than any I've ever tried.  Thank you for adding this!

This is a keeper! The only things I did differently: I sauteed the zucchini for about 2 minutes in olive oil and minced garlic. I also didn't have any fresh tomatoes, so I used canned - crushed in basil and I added dried basil and oregano. I didn't have mozzarella either so I used fat free feta. This was very tasty!! I will definitely make it again.

This is so good! I too, thought cooked zucchini was boring, but WOW! I also used the Italian Seasoning II from this site, and used a combination of crushed doritos & bread crumbs. What a delicious new favorite, & so healthy, thanks!

Great recipe! I took the advice of other reviewers and I added italian spices to the breadcrumbs, and I did not pre-saute the zucchini, but I did saute and add onion, garlic and carrot. I did not have mozzarella cheese, so I used feta, and it was great.

Love this dish!  I add yellow squash as well as the tomatoes and zucchini.  All the juice from the veggies helps keep the chicken really moist.  This dish is in heavy rotation in my kitchen.

Pretty good, but I felt it was a little bland. If I make it again, I will add more spices to the bread crumb mixture and to the veggies. I made a few changes based on the reviews. I didn't sautee the zucchini and I added onion and garlic.

I made this last night for my family because we had a lot fresh zucchini from our garden that we needed to use up. My family LOVED it!! It's now my husband's favorite meal that I make. I used most of the ingredients that were provided but however I did sub the salt for Garlic Salt and I used Jack Cheese instead of Mozzarella Cheese. We even had enough for left overs for lunch today and it was just as good reheated!! AWESOME DISH!!

Great recipe.  I added minced garlic, parsley, oregano, and additional pepper to the recipe.  I served it with Orzo pasta and it was really tasty!  Will keep for future meals.  Thanks!

This was great.  I love veggies and this was almost right.  I think next time I'll use a whole onion and saute it with the zucchini and add a clove of garlic. But other wise.  Realy good!

This was surprisingly hearty considering all of the vegetables.  The flavor wasn't much (I sprinkled on some dill and more salt than usual), but my husband and I were very pleasantly satisfied after dinner.  Must have been soul food or something - this was everything a meal ought to be.

This was a huge hit with my husband and me!!!  Like others, I didn't have fresh tomatoes as yet, so I used canned whole tomatoes and sliced them.  The only thing I changed was that I used SEASONED bread crumbs which really made it tasty.

This was so delicious!  I used small chicken tenders, a can of diced tomatoes (drained), and dried basil leaves because that's what I had.  My 5 year old said "mom, I like your chicken!"

FANTASTIC, after changes.  I took the advice of others and left the zucchini raw.  First, I coated the zucchini very lightly with olive oil, garlic salt & italian seasoning, placed them in the baking dish, followed by the tomatoes sprinkled with sea salt, grilled red onion, then the shredded mozzarella.  I follow the chicken recipe and placed that on top of the cheese.  I baked it at 400 for 25 minutes.  Perfect!  The zucchini was still slightly crispy, the chicken was moist.  I served it with garlic toast for a lighter meal.  So good.  I can't wait to make this one again.

Chicken was good. I added onion and garlic to increase flavor but veges still lacking something.  More cheese? More herbs?  Cream of something soup?  Definitely worth repeating and tinkering with the recipe.

Super easy to throw together and we really liked it.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and put the zucchini straight into the 9X13 pan. They were cooked, but not mushy.  Perfect!!  This one will be a regular in our rotation.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  Got rave reviews.  Would double it.  I used chicken thighs and basil paste and I baked the zuchini and tomatoes underneath the chicken in a foil wrapped glass dish.  I had to double the time and drop the temp to 350.

Excellent. I did it with thick chicken tenders still took the same time to cook. Probably better with tenders since they probably have the same cooking time as zucchini.

Lovely and delicious way to use up some of the many zucchini and tomatoes from my garden.  I did the same as most others: didn’t sauté the zucchini before cooking, turned out great.  Couldn’t get my hands on fresh basil, used fresh oregano, was lovely.  I will definitely be making this again!

Very good.  Added italian seasoning in breadcrumbs and on top of zucchini.  Added chopped onions on zucchini.  Browned chicken w/ minced garlic.

Whole family liked it! Took other reviewers suggestion and did not saute zucchini before and I'm glad I didn't. It got plenty tender just from the other juices.

Loved this!  So did my family!  Based on earlier reviews, I added some minced garlic to the zucchini and only sauteed it for about a minute.  I also replaced all of the regular salt the recipe calls for with garlic salt.  I didn't have any basil, so I used Italian Seasoning.  Yummy!

We had lots of tomatoes and zucchini from our garden. This was a great way to use it. We added onions to the recipe and used oregano as we had no basil. Will definitely make it again.

Absolutely loved this recipe! Im a novice, so the ease of this recipe was what atrracted me to it. However, preparing this meal was trouble free. The chicken was some of the juiciest i've ever had, and my mother was impressed enough to ask for my tips! The stewed like zucchini and tomato will keep you having seconds, and thirds lol. Overall a fantastic, yet simple dish to impress anyone with. Thanks!

Delicious, I cut recipe to 2 servings, and added the zucchini to the prepared baking dish, omitting the sauteing.  I followed the recipe as written, otherwise.
It was so delicious.

Absolutely delicious!  A 'keeper' for sure.  I followed other comments by not sauteing the zucchini - put it directly in the dish with some olive oil on the bottom - seems to be the trick.  Also, I baked it for 20 minutes after uncovering instead of 10 min. per the receipe.  Will definitely make again.

Made this mostly according to the recipe.  Used 1/2 zucchini and 1/2 yellow squash as that is what I had, and after reading reviews, I used garlic herb bread crumbs instead of plain, did not saute the squashes,  and used diced tomatoes with Italian seasoning instead of sliced tomatoes. Served it with rotini pasta. Put the veggies on the pasta, prima vera style and topped with fresh grated parmesian cheese.  While nothing to rave about, this is a good solid recipe that worked on a weeknight, and that used up some of the bounty of squash from the garden. Next time will add garlic, oregano, more basil and perhaps some onions to the squash for more flavor.

I used crushed rice crispies instead of bread crumbs, diced canned tomatoes instead of fresh and shredded cheddar/Parmesan instead of mozzarella cheese (all because that's what I had on hand). It was soooooooo good!

Pretty good! I followed the recipe exactly as written except I didn't saute the zucchini before baking it and I used Panko bread crumbs instead of regular ones. The chicken breasts I used were really large, it probably would have been better if I had pounded them or bought smaller breasts. I used fat free mozzarella cheese on top.

I loved this recipe, I dont normally like chicken breast when it is baked because it turns out dry. but the chicken in this recipe was tender. I also added paprika to the bread crumbs. I added a can of stewed tomatoes with italian seasoning to the vegetables before baking.

Love this. Took other users suggestions and used 2 cans of diced tomatoes w/ onions and garlic instead of the tomatoes. I also didn't cook the zucchini in pan after the chicken and zucchini turned out great. Everyone in my family thought it was great!

I used Italian bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and purple leave basil as that it what I had on hand.  I also did not overcook the zucchini in the skillet.  Even my PICKY 17 year old ate every bite on her plate and said it was good.  Zucchini was fresh from garden.

This is a really good recipe but I have to agree with the other reviewers that it works a lot better if you just put everything into the pan raw. I don't brown the chicken or saute the veggies. Some times I ad some bell pepper for additional flavor, but it is very god as written.

I definitely impressed my friends with this dish. Took a good bit longer than the directions indicate. Changed it up by using corn flakes instead of bread crumbs, pizza spices and garlic salt instead of the basil, and simply baked the zucchini instead of pan searing it in oil. A little extra cheese is a nice touch, too.

The only thing I did different was to NOT saute the zucchini, but they still turned out too soft.  I will need to slice them thicker next time.  The chicken was moist, we enjoyed it.

This was so good (which makes my family happy) and also healthy (which makes me happy). i only had 3 zucchinis and 2 tomatoes so i added a can of diced fired roasted tomatoes. As suggested by other reviewers, i also added a small onion and 3 cloves of garlic. Easy to put together but tasted like it took a lot more work.

The chicken was quite tasty but this dish lacked flavor.  It was very bland and I followed the recipe exactly.  Might try again with seasoned canned tomatoes so that it might have a little sauce but it's not very pleasing as is.

This was so good!  Like others had suggested, I did not saute the zucchini first.  I also used canned, diced tomatoes b/c that was all I had, and grated parmesan.  I can't wait to try it with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella.  The chicken was so flavorful and juicy and the zucchini was superb!  Thank you for this recipe!

The zucchini were way too soggy and there wasn't much flavour overall. Maybe I did something wrong.

Delicious!  Everyone loved it!  I did add garlic to the zucchini when I sautéed it.  Next time I would not sauté the zucchini but just let it bake while the dish is in the oven.

I loved this recipe and have made it many times now.  I like it just as is the only change I make is that I like to cook the chicken under the zucchini and tomatoes to absorb all the yummy flavors as they seep down to the bottom of the pan.  It is definitely better when made with fresh picked tomatoes.

I made this a week ago and the family liked it. It introduced us to a new veggie and I liked that it was a light meal yet I felt content. When I make it again I will try one suggestion I seen on here and that is baked the zucchini rather than saute it first. I may have overcooked since it was soggy.

Very good and very lite!  We loved it. I followed some other suggestions and cut the zucchini length wise and then in 1/2 inch chunks and skipped sauteing it before hand.  I did however sauteed onion and garlic and added it to the mix.  I used crushed croutons for my breading which added some great flavor. I served with garlic bread and everyone loved it!

The only thing I enjoyed about this dish was assembling it. The dish turned out to be beautiful but lacks taste (even though I  added garlic and Italian seasonings). I couldn't even taste the fresh basil...shame.

My husband and I both think it was fabulous!!! I sauteed the the zucchini with a little lemon pepper herb in a cast iron pan that the breaded chicken was cooked in . Then followed recipe as is.  I swear that makes the flavors much better!

I made this last night and really enjoyed it!  I had to use dried basil, which was fine, but I'd love to try it again with fresh.  Unfortunately, it did take me longer to make than I expected, but I will definitely try it again when I have more time to prep.

My family of five(2 teenage sons and a 6 y o daughter) ate this up! It was absolutely delicous and easy to prepare.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs which may have made up for the lack of flavor some complained about.  What a great way of getting vegetables into my kids with no complaints!

This dish was delicious!!  PERFECT entertaining dish for friends.  Very colorful and the chicken was tender.  Lovely flavor and would impress any visitor- impressed my husband and he usually doesn't care if it's fresh fish or fish sticks.  The only thing I did different was used grated parmesan cheese instead of mozz.  but only because I had that on hand.  The fresh basil really made a difference as well.  Very good!!

This was pretty good. If you saute some garlic and onion in the olive oil it adds a lot of flavor. As is, it's a 3, but with onion and garlic it's a 4.

Very good recipe. I only added some chopped garlic when I sauteed the zucchini.  The vegetables turned out fantastic in the dish. Will make again.

This was delicious. Mt daughter was visiting the night I first made this and she decided this was her newest favorite recipe. I used tomatoes from my garden and mozarella with sun-dried tomatoes and basil.

My husband & I thought this was fantastic.  The only thing that I would do differently next time, would be to bread & pan fry the zucchini slices first.

A lovely dish for summer vegetables, quick and easy to make on a weeknight.  I used seasoned Italian breadcrumbs and a mix of shredded cheeses with boneless, skinless chicken tenders instead of breasts.  After the chicken pan-fried, I drained the remaining oil and sauteed the zucchini for only a minute or two.  (I thought draining the zucchini after it cooked, as per the directions, sounded messy.  Draining beforehand left the pan only lightly coated in oil and it worked well.)  I might try adding some sauteed onions to this dish next time for some additional flavor.  My husband enjoyed this as a lighter, fresher alternative to his favorite dish, chicken parmigiana.  I will definitely make it again.
