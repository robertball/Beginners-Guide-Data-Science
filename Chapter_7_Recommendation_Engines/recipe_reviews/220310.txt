If you throw the ingredients in a blender with a little ice, you have a cheap homemade coffee Frap that costs a fraction of what you'd pay at Starbucks. It's quite bendable to make more personal for what you like--caramel sauce, chocolate syrup or flavored coffee syrups.....there's so many different combinations you could make. Great summer drink.

Simple - yes and wow is this stuff ever good! I don't even drink coffee but I love it cold! This is a great pick me up in the afternoon - much cheaper than Starbucks or Dunkin' Donuts for that matter! I made this exactly as the recipe stated the first time. I liked it so much the next time I added a little ice and put it in a blender to thicken it then topped it with whipped cream and chocolate syrup (I know really bad). I think if I make it again I'll lighten it up a bit and sub in fat free half and half (forget the whipped cream and chocolate syrup lol). Great recipe!

This oddly does taste just like the frappucinos in the glass jars at the supermarket. What a waste to buy them. A little chocolate syrup, will probably make the mocha style ones. A flavored creamer would be good to. I made a 1/2 recipe, for myself, and used decaf instant and 2% milk. ty

I usually pour the coffee in an empty water bottle and add some flavored creamer and put it in the freezer for about an hour and it gets good and slushy!

When I first read this recipe I was thinking that no way could the ratios be correct, but I was proven wrong fast enough. This is a five star recipe on its own because it taste better than the store-bought versions, but the real bonus is you can customize it to your liking so easily. Definitely a keeper. Thanks marko1995 - simple but fantastic!

I tried this this morning. I absolutely adore this recipe! I love coffee, but I am the only one in the house that drinks it. I always have plenty left over. I can't really do the sugary coffee drinks that can be purchased at the grocery store or from a coffee shop. So due to dietary restrictions, I altered the recipe just a bit. I used just one packet of sweetener and vanilla almond milk. I am hooked! Thanks so much for sharing!! I will have this drink again and again and again ..... :)

Made this today with skim milk, 1 packet of equal and coffee from our Keurig coffee maker.  Served over ice.  The possibilities are endless with this one.  What a quick coffee on the go recipe.

I was really skeptical, but this was very good! I can't wait to try it more during the summer time.

Hmmmm. I had high hopes for this recipe. It had an odd taste. Maybe it was the Splenda? I use it in my hot coffee, so not sure. Would like to try again with maybe just a touch of real sugar, no Splenda. Not bad, just weird after taste.

I was very pleasantly surprised with this beverage. Thank you for coming up with it and then sharing it with us! I added 1 Tbsp chocolate syrup the second time and it was amazing!

This is a great idea to make your own, because buying them costs so much more. You can find the right ratio of coffee, milk and sweetner to fit your tastes. One cup of milk is too much for me. I used 1/2 c milk to 1/2 c coffee. I only need 1 packet of sweetner, and I would rather use real sugar next time or flavored creamer. My only other issue is that even with cold coffee and cold milk, I wanted this colder. I added some coffee ice cubes to it. I'm sure just putting it back in the refrigerator for a while would help also.

Oh. My. Goodness! This DOES taste just like the expensive bottled drink in the stores! I wasn't expecting it to taste as good and refreshing as it does! I'm at the beach and made this with leftover coffee. Delicious!
