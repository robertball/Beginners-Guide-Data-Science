These are very tasty, but the cooking time is off...I don't know if there is a typo or what, but these beans were no where near done after 5 hrs. on low...I ended up putting it on high to finish. Next time, I will just cook them on high. The house smelled amazing while these were cooking, and they were very flavorful (you do need to add a good bit of salt). Would make these again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I really liked this recipe. I did think it could use more jalapeno though. We like things hot. Next time I think I will add an extra jalapeno.

I'm picky about beans and these are delicious. I've made them as per the recipe and with the addition of chicken broth.  Either way is fantastic.  My wife loves them and I make 'em often.  Thanks for sharing...

This recipe works well. I used habanero peppers instead of jalape√±os. Thank you for the recipe.

I did calculate Weight Watchers Points Plus Value, which is 4 PPV per serving by following this recipe. Of course, if you change/add anything, the PPV will change.
