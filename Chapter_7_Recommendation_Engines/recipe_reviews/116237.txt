Years ago I found this recipe in Taste of Home magazine and now I make it every year for St.Patricks Day. My family loves it!  I'm not a big fan of corned beef but I like this recipe.

This recipe was a great hit with the kids! The sweet tangy glaze was perfect and kept the inside nice and moist. I decreased the temp to 325 degrees and basted every 15 minutes for 45 minutes. I have never seen my kids eat corned beef like that before. Save the boiling water to cook your potatoes and cabbage. It give the vegetables great flavor.

Absolutely loved it! My husband says it's one of the best meals he's ever had!  I added some red potatoes and baby carrots to the water for the last hour. Sauce was great over entire meal. Definitely a keeper!

This was really good. After reading the reviews, I cut back on the sugar, and cut the ketchup to a scant 1/2 c. but left everything else the same. . . great sauce! :)

# Mustard Glazed Corned Beef adapted this by adding 1 can beer to water no celery so used celery seasoning, didn't pour out the juice just took beef out then added red potatoes turnips and carrots and 2 tbsp. beef base cooked this until veges done. with corn beef glaze used 1/2 white vinegar and 1/2 cider, used spicy mustard in place of plain and cut way back on horseradish as my husband doesn't like. It was the best corn beef recipe ever! this is a keeper!

Not very tender and very dry. Tried this before I found Slow Cooked Corned Beef for Sandwiches which you can turn into a whole meal by adding the veggis near the end of cooking time. It's the best corned beee you'll ever eat.

the glaze was good, but a little ketchuppy at first. i seasoned it to taste and the ketchup taste dissapeared.
Also i threw it a geogre forman rotissaire instead of bakeing it, and it turned out awesome...we couldnt stop eating it.

I made this today for St. Patricks Day and it turned out pretty good. I followed the recipe exactly, the beef was very tender.  It was a nice twist to the traditional corn beef and cabbage. 
I made it with red potatoes that I mashed leaving the skins on.  Served Irish Soda Bread too.

This turned out really nice. After taking the brisket out, I added potatoes, carrots and cabbage.  Perfect meal.  Will make again.

This was SO good.  My corned beef was moist and tender, and the GLAZE!!!  Well, that glaze will be back again and again, I think, but in different ways, because we really don't find affordable corned beef very often.  The glaze would be excellent on pork chops, ham--perhaps even carrots or other veggies.  Quite frankly, I wanted to eat it like soup!  LOL  SUPERB recipe!  Thanks for posting it.

Outstanding recipe! This is one of the very best corned beef I have ever had or made. As the corned beef baked in the oven with the sauce, I boiled potatoes and cabbage in the broth from the corned beef.  If  you make this recipe, you will not be sorry.

I've made this twice and it turned out great both times. I usually don't have horseradish on hand but i do have horseradish mustard so I used 1tbs yellow mustard and 1tbs +a little extra for good measure of the horseradish mustard. It makes a lot of sauce for the corned beef so I reserved some to serve on the side. The first time Made this I cooled it and used it for the best corned beef sandwiches I have made at home. The second time I served it as a traditional corned beef, either way it was very good. Thanks for sharing this unique twist on a  usually boring meal!

I don't even like mustard or horseradish, but this is really awesome.  I've even used the glaze in other recipes. A good tip is to use Hunt's ketchup, it breaks down the best.

Tried this recipe yesterday and it was FANTASTIC!! We usually make a dip of horseradish mustard, butter  and a little water with the meal. This year, there was a lot of the mustard dip was left at the end of the meal.

I made this dish and my 13 year old son said "this is the best meal he had in his life!" Because of the amount of time needed to make, I recommend dedicating a Sunday. Excellent flavors and very tender. Thank you.

I have been using this recipe for about 4 years now! I love it.  I use the glaze for chicken and pork ribs all the time and everyone always raves about it! I can't wait to have it on corned beef tonight for St Patty's Day!

Delicious - there were NO leftovers, my husband went back for 3rds! This will be in my meal rotation for sure.  The glaze added a sweetness to the saltiness of the corned beef, what better combination could you have with sweet & salty? :)

Loved this recipe for corned beef.  It was very easy and the whole family like it.  I used dehydrated onions instead of fresh, and omitted the mustard and the horseradish in the sauce, simply because I didn't have them on hand.  I ended up with a sweet tangy glaze that worked just fine.

This was great.  I cooked it in the dutch oven one night after work (having something else for dinner that night) and put it in the fridge in the pan.  The next evening I heated it up on the stove top and once warmed cooked it in the oven as directed with the sauce.  What a wonderful change from the boiled with carrots, potatoes and cabbage (yeach!).  The leftovers were great cold the next day for snacking!

This was sooo good. My entire family loved it. I doubled horseradish, as suggested by another reviewer. The glaze was amazing. I am going to save recipe for glaze for chicken on the grill. Think it would be great

Awesome Flavor.  I followed ingredients but pressure cooked for 1 hour and used pickling water for cabbage, then baked as recipe suggested.
My family loved it.  I would quarter the sauce next time because I threw almost all of it away after brushing the brisket.

This was delicious.  Once you try this you will never make it another way.  The glaze was the perfect amount of sweet to the salty corn beef.  I would slightly reduce the amount of catsup next time.  This was a huge hit with grown ups and kids alike.

This was great. I boiled it the day before and the next day glazed it and it was great. I was able to take the slab of fat off of it before it was baked...making it alittle healthier. Servied it with steamed cabbage, carrots and potatoes.

Mixed this recipe with the Corned Beef and Cabbage recipe by Laria Tabul to make a dinner that I will never forget. I left out the white vinegar by mistake and it was still perfect. I just happened to have some horseradish mustard in the fridge...mmmm... the corned beef I kept in the oven or about 45 minutes to make sure it glazed over perfectly, and also to let it cook down to perfection. Nice recipe, thanks!

Never cooked corned beef before, and wanted something other than the traditional "boiled with cabbage" meal for St. Patty's day.  This was perfect!!!

I had cocktail sauce on hand, so I used that in place of ketchup and horseradish.  I had some orange balsalmic vinegar, so used a bit of that combined with the regular vinegar.

I have to admit that when I tasted the glaze in the pan, I was a bit nervous, but once it was on top of the meat and baked, it was AMAZING!!!

I foresee this being a St Pat's tradition in my house!

WOW!  This was great and how anyone could give a negative review is beyond me!  So simple and delicious.  It did make more sauce than needed, but now I wished I had cooked six pounds, and then would have had leftovers on the corned beef and used all the sauce! I was going to add more horseradish but did not have enough, but will next time.  That is the only change I would make.

Excellent recipe.  My family absolutely loves this recipe.  The glaze is very yummy and is the reason the corned beef tastes so good.

This was very, very good.  I made it for guests, and it disappeared so fast I wished I had tripled the recipe instead of doubling it.  I wouldn't change anything.

Love the glaze!  We use the glaze like a sauce/gravy and serve it warm at the table. I double or triple the mustard, to taste, because we like a bit more kick. I use both Dijon and yellow mustard.  

We brine our beef for at least a week and then cook it in the crock in plain water (sometime add a bottle of Guinness).

I absolutely loved loved this!  I've never cooked corned beef brisket, so I don't have a lot to compare it too.  But, being my first experience was a positive one..it's a keeper.  The only *change* was I couldn't find regular horseradish, so I wound up using Jack Daniels Horseradish Mustard in place of the horseradish & mustard.  I found that the sauce made a lot!  so, what was left, I saved for extra on the side.
