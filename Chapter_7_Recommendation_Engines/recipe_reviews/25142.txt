This was wonderful with a few changes that I made.  I only used ground chicken and ground beef.  I added garlic and spinich and onion to the meat mixture and it turned out great.  My mother in law wants me to make this for a luncheon for 30 or more people.  Love the crepe idea rather than pasta, makes it a bit lighter.  Will for sure make it again and again.

Excellent! I substituted leftover chicken thighs that I diced finely for the ground chicken and substituted ground pork for ground veal. It turned out delicious. As one other reviewer suggested, I, too, doubled the ingredients for the crepes (came out fine). A tip for those who have never made crepes (like myself before this recipe): pour only a small amount of batter into the pan so that it is just enough to cover the bottom, cook only a couple minutes on medium low heat each side until just browned.

Great recipe!  Gourmet presentation is enhanced by garnishing with sauces rather than baking all together.  Simply bake cannelloni alone, prepare sauces as directed in recipe, and serve cannelloni over sauces.

Great recipe for meat mixture.  Sometimes I just use one meat.  I always just use store bought cannelloni tubes and have the kids stuff them.

My 5 yr. old hummed the whole time and asked that I make it again the next day. we loved it but next time I think I would add a bit of Ricotta or maybe Romano cheese.

exceptional! when i told my wife what we were having, she was skeptical. however, when dinner was served, everyone loved it. a new one added to the menu rotation for sure. We didn't have veal, but made up with more ground chicken and ground beef. added garlic powder to the white sauce, and cayenne to the meat mixture when browning.

Fantastic!  The family loved it.  The crepes mad it taste much lighter as oppossed to when using a canelloni shell.  The results were a great meal that wasn't weighed down by pasta.

Terrific!  Doubled meat filling and crepes to feed husband and 3 kids with hearty appetites - used regular amounts of sauce, cheese etc. Made 12 fat cannellonis.  Sprinkled extra meat over them before pouring on sauces.  Family loved it! Will definitely cook again and again!

I thought this was a great recipe.  I wanted to try it because it reminded me of a dish I had in Spain.  My kids (4&5) would not eat it because they are really picky but we loved it and so did the in-laws.  I think next time I will try it with more white sauce and less red sauce.

Will definitely make this again!  Per other reviews, only used 1/2 the cheese and sauce and made more crepes.  Very, very good!!!!!!

Great taste, but next time I'll alter it a little. Seems like you need to double the crepes recipe, and then I might cut the cheese and the sauce in half. I had way more meat than would fit into the number of crepes I got from the recipe. It was very saucy and I only put on about 1/4 of the cheese and might cut it back still more.

This was outstanding! I used romano instead of parmesan, and I didn't add the salt to anything other than the crepes because I generally don't see the reason for it. Speaking of the crepes - I ended up making two batches and ending up with 10 total (8 inch ones). 9 would've been perfect for the baking dish. The pasta sauce was a little too much. I'd say 28 oz. or so would be perfect. I had one float up and try to push out of the cheese. But all together, this was fantastic, and it's the first time in a long time I've seen my father eat seconds.

This was very good, easy, and fairly quick to make.  Cut down meat a little or increase recipe amount for crepes to even out.  Only had ground beef but I imagine the combo of meats would make this even better.  I do think meat mixture needed a little garlic to give it some oomph.  Thank you - definitely making again!
