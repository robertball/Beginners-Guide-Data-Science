For the first time making this recipe I was pleasantly surprised at how easy they were to make and remove from the oven without much fuss. Unfortunately some stuck to the bottom of the pan and made a mess for me to clean up but others were very easy and made the experience that much more fun. I rated this recipe a 5 star rating since they were just the right amount of sweetness without anything extra added to them.

First time ever making butter tarts. They were very yummy & easy to make but I had to cook them a fair bit longer than stated in the directions as the filling was pretty runny once I bit into them.  I think I probably added on another 10 minutes only because I prefer my filling not to be as runny. Added pecans...I could have added more pecans in my opinion but they were pretty small tarts. My college age son loved them & he's pretty picky...score 1 for me!

First off - love the simplicity of this recipe. It is perfect. 

I did however make an alteration - I added 2tbs of cream to the butter mix and I used 50/50 butter margarine mix.

I have done the recipe both the original and with the alterations, but my family and I much preferred it with the cream added - made a world of difference! I will also add that I cut the recipe in HALF and I still had enough to fill 24 tarts (with homemade crust in a muffin pan) - so the butter recipe does yield a lot of extra - a perfect option to do the butter pie instead!

Ive reviewed these before - just wanted to add that if you use premade shells, most are NOT deep at all. 1TBSP of fill per cup will pretty much fill it to the top. I used Great Value shells (Walmart) and one butter batch will actually make you closer to 50 tarts - give or take (more give lol) This is a very large batch if you are not making your own shells that are cupcake pan deep. keep that in mind - if you truly only want to make a dozen and are using store bought shallow desert shells - cut the recipe in half :)

For how easy these were, I give them 5 stars! They are sweet and delicious! I used store bought tart shells that were 3 inches but aren't very deep,  and had lots of filling left. Next time I will definitely add some raisins. This is my first time making butter tarts and with a recipe this easy I can see myself making these again and again!

Amazing, made them for a few functions everyone loves them! I substituted half of the golden syrup with maple syrup and added pecans and raisins. We Canadians love our maple syrup eh?

I used the brandy snap baskets recipe on this site for the shells... It was awesome!! And looks way more fancy than the amount of time prep actually took.

very good!  i only made a third of the recipe and it was enough to fill 15 store-bought tart shells.  i love the consistency (no runniness) and none of the tarts overflowed in the oven.
