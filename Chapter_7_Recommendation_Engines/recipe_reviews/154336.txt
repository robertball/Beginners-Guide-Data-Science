I was a little heavy handed with the flour when the dough did not quickly form as ball as directed, and so ended up with slightly cakier cookies than I expected.  Otherwise, very tasty and easy to use dough once it set up in the fridge.

I don't recommend making these if you want to use cookie cutters.  The dough is too wet despite adding a lot more flour than recommended.    The flavor is OK but nothing special. I wouldn't bother with this again.

Grace made me these for Christmas and gave me the recipe that I later lost. She said you have to do it by hand, a little of this and that until it's just right. I'm pleased to see her recipe is saved on the internets so I could find it again. I have her roll recipe and her dumplings around here somewhere too. She told stories of how her mother was quite a baker. I know her Charley ate well.

I followed the recipe exactly and with the ingredient list the dough was too sticky. I kept adding flour to the mix and in the end, there was too much dough and the cookies were bad enough that I threw the entire batch in the garbage.

This recipe did not work out for me. I added more flour than recommended to try to prevent the dough from being too wet and sticky but it was still wet and sticky. I donâ€™t recommend if using cookie cutters

ok so here's what i did; i was closer to 5 and a half cups of flour because i mixed by hand it wasn't completely solid when i put it in the fridge but looked like dough. i left it over night and it was perfect! me and my girls had a ball making these thanks :) also didn't have buttermilk so made sour milk with milk powder instead ended up making 72 cookies. cookie cutters worked great roll thin for crunchy cookies like my husband likes and a little thicker for soft centered bickys this may be my new base for all my cookies can add and change to make all different types of cookies :D

When I added the buttermilk to the flour which the directions implies I got something like a silly putty mixture which doesn't even mix smoothly. Plus based on the other reviews I will try another recipe rather than trying to make this again.
