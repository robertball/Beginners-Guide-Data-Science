This isn't a "gourmet" jello dish... It's simple and tasty.  Kids have fun making shapes out of the jello with cookie cutters.  You can cut down on the sugar without any problem.  It's fun to make special shapes for holiday celebrations - something special just for the kids (and adults too)!

I've always added the hot water to the mixing bowl, so this is the first time I've read about boiling it, and it worked like a charm.  No need to add the sugar.  I used 4 Knox gelatin packs, and it was fine, but next time I will add 5.  I probably should have cut down on the water a little bit, but that just occurred to me now.  Melting the Knox in cold water was new to me also; I used to add hot water to it, and it required mixing, and it seems to love cold water!  I also added mandarin orange to my orange jello, and it set well.  Turned out yummy!

We made this all the time when I was a kid, however the extra sugar is unnecessary though.  Works great with sugar free jello also and a nice sweet treat if watching weight.

Super simple and super fun. I made a double batch and used the new all-natural Jell-O mix in Mixed Berry flavor. The kiddos enjoyed this jiggly-wiggly snack.

These came out great! I'm only giving it four stars though because I think 4 envelopes of gelatin instead of five would have been more than enough and the extra sugar is definitely not needed. My 3 year old had so much fun. making these and eating them. Thank you for the recipe!

Didn't change a thing, and just as good as I remember as a kid. Next time I make an adult version, with a little bit of vodka in it. Finger Jello Shots

I made it for the children of a friend who had just had a baby. It was fun to make and they were excited about trying the jello shapes when I dropped off the meal. If I do it again, I'll use some fruit juice to give the gelatin more flavor.

My mom used to make this for us when we were kids. I have made it for my kids but couldn't remember how much jello and how much gelatin. Glad the recipe was here ??. I agree with  some others, though, that the added sugar wasn't necessary. I went ahead and tried it but I think I was a bit too sweet   I made it today for some kids I'm babysitting and they loved it-had never had finger jello before.
