This recipe is better than most apple crisps I've tried, but I did find it a bit flawed, though I would make it again with some changes. It was overly sweet so I would decrease the sugar in the crumble part by one fourth cup.I do have to say that the texture was SUPERB. Another problem is that the cookie part tasted eggy. Weird because there is no egg in the recipe and I used only the freshest ingredients. Maybe I'll try with a different type of oat next time? All in all, worth a try.

Great recipe, I improvised a little though.
Instead of 1 tsp of cinnamon, I used 3/4 tsp cinnamon 1/4 tsp nutmeg
On the crumble, I got the butter to be super soft/melted and added 1/2 tsp vanilla.

It lasted less than 2 nights.

The topping on this was okay. Not the best I've made. I prefer cutting in the butter instead of adding it melted. I believe it makes it more crumbly but not less crispy. The topping was noticibly sweeter than usual. My  husband didn't complain, though.

Absolutely delicious and a simple recipe, too! I made no changes and it turned out beautifully. Used 3 very large honeycrisp apples. I will definitely make this again.

have made this several times, not always with apple filling. I love this topping and use it on apples, rhubarb or today I am having unexpected company for supper so I opened a can of cherry pie filling and used the topping on it.  It is my go to recipe for fruit crumbles.

If I could give this a thousand stars, I would! I don't even typically like desserts but this...I've made it twice in the two weeks since I found it. It gets just devoured at our house! I do use apple pie spice in the filling (instead of cinnamon) and add Vietnamese cinnamon to the crumble topping - it just makes it even a little better. Last time I accidentally used quick oats and it was just as delicious!

Made exactly as directed. Very good topping and apples not mushy. However was a little sweet for my taste. Will cut back on the sugar next time. Great with French Vanilla ice cream.

We LOVED this! I used Honey Crisp apples so I reduced the sugar a lot. As per other reviews I also reduced the flour. I used Penzey's Pie Spice in place of the cinnamon called for - yum!

I made this in a tin pie plate for cooking over our charcoal smoker in "oven" mode. It worked great and baked in about 45 minutes at 350.

Best apple crisp ever!!  I used Namaste gluten free flour and it was perfect. Second time I made it I substituted agave syrup for the white sugar, and maple syrup for the brown sugar. I had to add more oats to the topping so it wouldn't so runny. It was gobbled up!!

Made this tonight and just finished a bowl.  DELICIOUS!  I didn't change the recipe and I used whatever bag of apples I had on hand.  Wound up using 2 medium and 5 or 6 small ones.  Super yummy and perfect with vanilla ice cream.  Even my picky 12 year old enjoyed it!

Made 1.5x the recipe for a 9x13 pan. I had some finely diced pecans and walnuts on hand so I added them to the topping and it was awesome.  Served with vanilla ice cream.

My family loved it.  I used fresh apples from our backyard trees.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.  The only changed I made was to add chopped pecans to the topping.  I would recommend baking it for 30 minutes.

I just made this and oh, my Lord, it's fantastic! I used a couple leftover Fuji and Granny Smith apples and threw in some Bartlett pear slices. I added a generous dash of nutmeg to the slices and made the topping as written. What's even better is now my apartment smells wonderful! Thank you for this recipe.

This  was so yummy I ate three pieces; since I am diabetic, that's not really a good thing! I will definitely make it again. I served it with vanilla ice cream and salted caramel syrup; it tasted like you'd died and gone to heaven. A keeper for sure!

I halved the recipe because I only had four apples.  I added about a 1/4 cup of chopped pecans and baked in a 9-inch pie pan. Turned out G-R-E-A-T!

I really like this recipe over any I've tried for apple crisp, I didn't have enough apples so I used 2 and added a cup of apple sauce and 1/2 cup of pecans to the filling. Yummy, family loved it!
