Awesome recipe - I added an extra 1/4C of cheese and baked at 350 for 30 minutes to bake out some of the moisture - my kids hate spinach and they liked it - this will be making some potluck appearances in the future

This was INCREDIBLE!  I made it for a BBQ, and it was gone within minutes...literally!  Half the party didn't get to have any b/c it was all gone.  So easy and good.  I served it with onion crackers b/c I omitted the chopped onion (substituted onion powder).  I also added a few dashes of hot sauce and used light butter.  People are still talking about it and can't wait to have it again.  TERRIFIC!

This was absolutely fabulous, dfinitely a keeper and will make again. My only suggestion is to double the recipe if making for a gathering, because it was gobbled up within minutes.

I doubled this last night for a potluck. It was gone within minutes!! I didn't have any cooking sherry, so left it out. I'm not sure what I missed by not having it, but what I had sure was delicious!! Thanks for the easy to make recipe!

Made for the first time for a company pitch! A co-worker is leaving and moving to Texas, so I wanted something "theme." So far the reviews have been good. It was a really quick and easy dip recipe!

I did not think this recipe had much taste.  I served it at an Oscar party and it was only one of 2 appetizers and it was barely touched...such a waste of some good crab meat.

Gave it 4 stars for flavor. It just was not creamy enough for our taste. Next time I will play with the recipe and add sour cream or cream cheese to see if that helps. Great flavor just needs to be creamier.

Yummy! I would use a tick less sherry next time, or try a different cooking wine. Either the flavor or the amount of sherry gave it a twang. I love it for the most part though! Just one to experiment with to adjust to your own taste.

Excellent and rich!  Following other commenters' suggestions, I added 3/4 block of softened cream cheese to the onions-and-butter mixture to add body.  Omitted sherry because I didn't have any, and the dish didn't seem to suffer.  Heated at 350 for 20 minutes.  Happy to add this to my party repertoire!

Added a 1lb. Can of crab, can of diced tomatoes and used Cupcake Pino Grigio didnâ€™t have cooking sherry. Needed something like pepper or a dash of chili powder.
