This was an excellent fruit dip (and a huge hit).  I did follow others advice and used 8 oz of cream cheese rather than 3.  I think that made a huge difference.  I also used extra creamy cool whip which made it thicker (and made it stick to the fruit more!).  I used strawberry cream cheese, but think it would also be excellent with pineapple or mixed berry cream cheese.  Whipping the cream cheese prior to adding the marshmallow cream and whipped topping is a good way to avoid lumps.  I will be making this again!

When I worked at Safeway we made our own fruit dip for our fruit trays.  We used a 16 oz. Cool Whip - 8 oz. cream cheese - small jar of marshmallow cream & a can of Eagle Brand.  Try this I think you will like the addidion of the Eagle Brand.

LOVE THIS! I'm always tempted to eat a spoonful all by itself!  After making this at least a dozen times for family & work get-togethers, I still get compliments.  
I use 8oz flavored cream cheese, and mix in a few tablespoons of powdered sugar after everything else is blended together.  I've used plain, pineapple, strawberry, honey nut, and blueberry cream cheese and they all turn out great.  Some work better with certain kinds of fruit, but apples are always a favorite.  Try strawberries, pineapple, honeydew, cantaloupe, graham crackers, ginger snaps, etc.
I typically make the night before and it always tastes great.  Keeps in the refrigerator VERY well... longer than the fruit!

I have made this twice.  The first time I used the "Extra Creamy" Cool Whip.  The second time I just used the regular Cool Whip.  It was definitely better, creamier, and easier to dip the first time.  I also used the strawberry cream cheese.  Very good!!!

This is excellent.I'm tempted to try it as a frosting sometime! Definitely use the full 8 oz. of cream cheese and not quite the whole container of whipped cream. This makes a thicker dip that sticks to fruit better. Great with vanilla or a little OJ concentrate. Might be good with a splash of Frangelico or Amaretto liqueur as well. We like it with apple slices or strawberries. Makes a great dish for a a baby shower or other get-together. I slice apples and dip them in acidulated water (water + lemon juice), and arrange them on a platter with this dip. It doesn't last!

This is great!  I made it for a party, served it with strawberries,cantelope,honeydew,and pineapple chunks, and everyone loved it!  I,too, added 8 oz. of cream cheese and a little vanilla and it came out perfectly.  I whipped the cream cheese first, then whipped in the marshmallow cream, then the whipped topping. Absolutely no little lumps of cream cheese.  Yes.it made quite a lot, but no one in my family complained about HAVING to eat what was left over!

My guess is that if you follow this recipe exactly the consistency will be perfect. Failing to follow my own advice I used 4 oz. of cream cheese and 8 oz. of marshmallo creme. It was delicious, but a little thick and I can never leave a recipe alone, so I added a splash of Grand Marnier to taste and then thinned it with milk. Everybody loved it! I'm thinking of trying pineapple juice and rum next time.

I always stick the marshmallow cream in the microwave on about 10 seconds to make it easier to mix.  Be careful though, much more than 10 seconds and it will be liquid!

Absolutely awesome! I used fat free cool whip, fat free cream cheese & marshmallow creme (i think all of it is fat free). It was unbelievable.

I prepared this for a wedding reception,  I made a few changes as follows, whip 2 - 8 ounce packs of low fat cream cheese add vanilla and a little of almond extract  add about 1/3 cup of powdered sugar then add a 7 ounce jar of marshmallow creme last, fold in an 8 ounce extra creamy cool whip. Can make the day of event, but is better the next day. Sticks well to the fruit, used it with strawberries, pineapple, apple, and grapes. I sprinkled some splenda to the fruit the night before to add more sweetness. YUM!

this recipe is pretty thin and sweet as written. the first time I made it, I didn't realize it called for a 3 oz pkg of cream cheese, so I made it with an 8 oz package, and I added 1/2 tsp each vanilla and lime juice. it tastes like cheesecake! and it's thick and delicious with strawberries, watermelon, canteloupe, kiwi, and grapes (all of which I served on my fruit tray). once I realized it called for 3 oz, I made it that way and liked it, but not as much as the version I accidentally made! I also use my version as a cream cheese icing on cinnamon rolls, for homemade soft pretzels, and on cupcakes. yum! thanks for the recipe!

Made a double batch of this for my son's birthday party.  I think the adults enjoyed it more than the kids.  :)  I did use the 8 ounce container of strawberry cream cheese instead of the 3 ounce regular.  So yummy!

Excellent dip and very very easy.  Everyone ate this up at a baby shower I threw for a friend.  I think it may also be nice with flavored cream cheese but have not tried.

I heard about this dip through a friend and decided (with eyes rolled) to try it myself.  Needless to say, it was the hit of the party!!! I served it with Strawberries and Cinammon flavored pita chips.  The chips and dip were the winning combo.  I decided to go with the other reviews and use 8oz of cream cheese.  I think it was a little too cream cheesy and next time I will use what the recipe states.

I love that this can be whipped up so quickly. I served with chunks of fresh pineapple. You could add a little OJ concentrate too, to change it up, but it's delicious as is. I did use the whole 8oz cream cheese cuz thats what I had at home and didn't want to leave 5oz unused.

So simple, and yet absolutely amazing!  I followed some of the other reviews and used Extra Creamy Cool Whip (not quite the whole container), 8 oz regular cream cheese, and about 8-9 oz of marshmallow cream.  I also added a few Tblsp powdered sugar and mixed in some finely chopped strawberries.  It's even better the next day in my opinion.  If I were using apples, I would change it up a bit.  This is a definite keeper!

This was good, but then I added the zest of one lemon, and in my opinion is now a 10 star rating.  I was actually eating it by the spoonful even without any fruit.  It's like a sinfully delicious lemon cream cheesecake.  I just wish I had some blackberries to try this on.  I will definately make this again.  Next time I'll experiment by increasing the amount of cream cheese.   You've got to try this!

I made this for my sister in laws baby shower on July 3rd. It was such a hit, once everyone said 'surprise!' They came rushing back to this dip! I then was asked to make it the following day at the 4 th of July BBQ. I gave the recipe out to a few ppl, even the host to both the partys, I went back today to the hosts house and she made it herself! Lol. It's great with apples, strawberries, cherries, grapes and melons. I listen to the reviews and added the 8 oz of cream cheese but next time I want to add a splash of cherry juice.

So good, and very easy to make.  Definitely a hit, and versatile!  I made a batch and divided it in half.  One half I took to a small party.  I sprinkled cinnamon on top, and served with small fruit and cheese skewers as well as apple slices.  The other half of the batch I used to stuff strawberries.  Thanks for sharing a simple, tasty recipe.

As others suggested, I used 8 oz. of cream cheese, following the other ingredients as listed.  It wasn't a huge hit with the family but I definitely liked it.

I had to re-rate my review because the 2nd day, I guess after refrigeration, this tasted awesome. My kids loved it!  I gave it 4 stars because it's probably super fattening..but oh so yummy.

Very good.  Made for wedding shower with fun fruity skewers.  It was just sweet enough.  I did use 16oz each of marshmallow creme, cool whip, and cream cheese for a large crowd and had MORE than enough.

A hug hit with all the teenagers at a recent get together. I did what others had suggested, and added extra cream cheese. Actually used strawberry cream cheese. It was excellent

This was a complete hit- the bowl was literally wiped clean! I decided to add a little cinnamon, nutmeg, and used a seasonal vanilla flavored whipped topping. An absolute favorite by ALL!

Love this recipe. I make a yellow cake drizzle vanilla syrup over the bottom layer then use the dip for frosting. Add the second layer drizzle more syrup an another layer of dip, then top with fresh blueberries and strawberries. Think you will love it. I always get compliments and never have any left over.

This was too sweet for us.  I followed others suggestions of adding 8oz of cream cheese.  I ended up having to throw most of it out, since no one actually ate any.

I made this for my 4 year old, who really wanted peanutbutter and jelly, and no part of this fruit dip. I finally convinced him to try a bite with some apple wedges. He loved it! Let's just say that I had to throw away the pbj.

Tastes fantastic. For best results, let the cream cheese soften first, otherwise it will be difficult make the dip as smooth as in the picture (there will be very small but noticeable chunks of cream cheese). As-is, the marshmallow is the dominant flavor; next time, I'll use a little more whipped cream, but that is just a personal preference.

Mmm... delicious!  This recipe makes a big batch- I paired it with 3 quarts of fresh strawberries (next time I'll triple the fruit- it went so fast!  I topped it off with chopped almonds- made a pretty dish:)

This is super easy and is delicious! The kids all gobbled up the fruit when they had this dip to go along with it, and the adults loved it, too. When I make it, I'm sure to let the cream cheese soften first so it will mix smoothly.

I served this at my son's 2nd birthday party.  It was wonderful!!  It was great on honey dew but 
magical on strawberries and bananas.  I will keep this recipe as a standard for my parties. By the way, try dipping salty pretzels in it too.  Yum!

This dip is soooo easy and very tasty.  I even tried it with cantelope and it was wonderful.  This makes enough for 13+ people as an appetizer or be prepared to snack on it for a few days...either way, noone will be complaining.

This was great - very creamy!  Remember to whip the cream cheese by itself first to avoid a lumpy texture.

This is a great recipe, very easy and quick and the fact that you can make the night before is really handy. I omitted some of the cool whip like some members suggested but added it back because I felt it was too thick and cheesy without. Also the marashino cherry juice that one member suggested was a great idea as it tasted better and added just a whisper of pink to the color. My guests loved this and I would make again.

Delicious! I've had it with many different kinds of fruit and found that strawberries and blueberries are perfect. I made my first batch with 1/3 fat cream cheese and light cool whip and thought it was just fine. This last batch I used fat free cream cheese and really can't taste a difference (the only noticeable difference is that it is slightly thicker). I will use fat free cream cheese from now on!!

Made this twice this week..the first time it was outrageous..the second time not so much..and lumpy..The only thing I did different the second time is put the marshmellow cream in the microwave to soften a bit, melted the cream cheese a bit also..so the texture was comletely different, even after refrigerating overnight. SO if it doesnt turn out the first time, give it another try. I still cant believe I ate THAT MUCH cream cheese this week!! ugh! UPDATE: made again with the addition of 1/4 can eagle brand..DONT DO IT...overpowers it...had to add the rest of the cream cheese and more cool whip, at this point not sure if I can even tatse it right anymore!

I cater small events for friends and family and I used this dip at a wedding that I did last night. It was such a huge hit everyone was raving over it! It was amazing the difference that the Cool Whip made. I am anti-cool whip, anytime it is called for I whip my own cream but in this case I decided to go with the tub for convenience sake and I was so impressed. So easy to make. I had some left over that I brought home and I am baking an angel food cake to use with it in a trifle with pineapples and strawberries. I can't wait to taste how it turns out.

DELICIOUS!! I have made variations of this light & super easy dip several times, and have had requests for the recipe every time! I have followed other suggestions, and always used 8oz cream cheese (softened & whipped) & 1 tsp vanilla. It's great when you play with the flavors: one time I used strawberry cream cheese & added 1 tsp strawberry extract. Another time I made a pina colada dip by adding coconut & pineapple extract. Any yummy cream cheese flavors would work well! I love to serve this with graham cracker sticks & fruit (strawberries, fresh pineapple, grapes, & melon). Thanks, Carla!

Very good fruit dip.  The only adjustment is to add more cream cheese because this is SWEET.  Don't get me wrong, I love sweet.  This was almost too much. The kids loved it, but the adults felt they were eating just sugar.  I will make again, but make my own adjustments.  Thanks for the post.

To be perfectly honest, you do not need fruit. A spoon and a bowl of this dip will do just fine. It's that good! Thank you. (by the way- it is good with fruit if you have some fruit around.)

Execellent recipe.  I made it for a baby shower and a group of ladies sat down at the buffet table so they could eat it with spoons. Once everyone else noticed how quiet they were the secret was out and everyone chomped until the berris were gone. The recipe does make a lot.

This was awesome! We couldn't get enough of it. I served it before a dinner party with strawberries, honeydew, cantaloupe & grapes it was gone in no time. I also used 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of the 3 in original recipe.This is a keeper!

This was a great dip. I took a lot of the other reviewers' suggestions. I used 8oz of cream cheese and it was the perfect consistency. Following another reviewer's advice, I beat/added the ingredients in the following order: cream cheese(softened), marshmallow creme (a little melted), and cool whip (not quite the whole container). I had no lumps and it was a perfect consistency for sticking to fruit. I also added about 2 T of orange juice, 1 T of cinnamon, and 1 T of vanilla extract. I took it to a baby shower and everyone had many servings of it. This recipe makes plenty. Enough for many servings for 20-25 people I'd say. I also used low fat or fat free everything and it tasted great.

It really is good.  actual rating is 4.5   This is my first time using marshmallow fluff so i was a bit leary.  Also, not a big fan of cool whip - I prefer whipped fresh cream but the stabilizers in the cool whip helped with the texture and maintained the shape.  It was a tad too sweet for my taste but my kids didn't seem to have ANY problem with it.  I won't use the whole jar of marshmallow fluff next time.   note - I increased light cream cheese to 6 oz.   Will definitely make it for parties.   It's SO easy to prepare.

I made this with cooking class for kids and they LOVED it. We did add the cherry juice for color and a little flavor. They kids all couldn't get enough. Some were eating it with spoons. Mine have had to make it a couple times since it 3 weeks ago.Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe was a big hit when I made it for my family.  We get tired of eating fruit plain and this was just what the doctor ordered. People kept getting plates of fruit so that they could stuff their mouthes with this sinful dip, LoL!.  I am extremely picky, but I have to admit that it is good.  I almost hate to give it 5 stars because it was too easy to make.  If you really want it smooth, make it with whipped cream cheese and OH MY!!

The flavor was exactly what I was looking for, but those reviewers who commented on how thick the dip was weren't kidding!  I added a splash of orange juice, lemon juice and vanilla (maybe a little over 1 T. of liquid total) and it was still more like a spread than a dip, once refrigerated.  I loved it, but next time I'll add more juice (or try milk) so that it will be easier to get off the spoon as people serve their plates.

This is excellent! It doesn't taste like cake icing at all (as someone said earlier). The cream cheese keeps it from being too sweet; it's just right! We loved it with fresh pineapple, strawberries, kiwi and yellow apples.

I added the powdered suger and a touch of vanilla and it was perfect. I ate all of the leftover fruit myself.

Excellent companion to my fruit plate at brunch!  I used 8 oz cream cheese instead of the recommended 3 oz and it turned out very rich.  The adults all loved it, but the kids proclaimed it "too sweet" and wouldn't touch it.  Next time I will use only 3 oz for a lighter flavor.  

Tastes fantastic on grapes, strawberries, cantelope, and honeydew.

This was really good - I made it for a gathering last night that had several children in attendance as well.  The only thing that I changed was that I used 8 oz. of cream cheese as opposed to 3 oz.  Everyone loved it and it was devoured quickly.

Everyone loved it. I made a full batch and froze half (with plastic wrap pushed down tight on top and then sealing). It defrosted perfectly and this crowd loved it as much on chips as on fruit. Thanks for the great recipe.

I used 8 oz cream cheese, whole tub of extra creamy cool whip, jar of marshmallow fluff, and enough maraschino cherry juice to give it a little color.  My kids loved it and so did my adult guests.  It makes a lot!

This is great! I used 'extra creamy' whipped topping instead of the original. This goes great with strawberries and grapes! The younger kids like spreading it on graham crakers and then placing the fruit on top of it! I will definately be making this again!

Love this recipe with just a few changes-- I also used 8 oz cream cheese, Extra Creamy whipped topping, and 1 sm can sweetened condensed milk. I'll keep making this dip with these changes. Excellent!

Yum. I doubled the recipe for a big outing and we ended up with quite a bit of leftovers. It stays nicely in the fridge for a while. Try it on some waffles or french toast with fresh fruit.

Awesome!  I used strawberry-flavored Cool-Whip and it made it visually appealing.  Great with all fruit, and we were practically eating it with a spoon when all the fruit was gone!

I made this to bring into a party at work and my co-workers and I both loved it.  This is the second time I made it and I found that the perfect amount of cream cheese is two 3oz. packages and not the full 8oz block.  When using a full 8 oz, the dip was more like a cream cheese mousse; however with 6 oz of cream cheese and regular and not creamy cool whip, the dip was creamy and not thick.  Either way you make it; it's fantastic.  I agree with one of the other reviewers that you could eat this with a spoon!  It's wonderful with strawberries. Make sure you blend the cream cheese smooth first before adding the marshmellow cream and cool whip.

This is fantastic!!!!!!  I followed other reviewers suggestions and used an 8 oz. block of cream cheese and whipped it with my electric mixer until smooth to prevent lumps. The result is just superb!  Not too sweet; just creamy and delicious.  I recently went to a party and the hostess served berries and fresh whipped cream that started to get warm and watery after a while; this recipe is much, much better.  It sticks to the fruit; not runny at all.  I couldn't stop eating it. I made a platter of fresh strawberries and blackberries.  Next time I may try a low fat cream cheese to save a few calories.  Thank you so much for this great recipe!!

This was a big hit at my son's birthday party.  I thought there would be leftovers but my family licked the bowl clean.  I also used 8 oz of Strawberry Cream Cheese and it was perfect.  Had multiple people asking for the recipe at the end of the party.  Will be using again in the future.

This dip is good, but is GREAT if you omit the whpped topping and 5 more oz. of cream cheese. Also, add a tablespoon or so of lime juice or you could zest a lime. You will have no complaints on this dip.

The flavor was great! My only mistake was not softening the cream cheese enough, so the consistency was a bit bumpy. Next time I will make sure the cream cheese is VERY soft. But this was great- I used it for a baby shower with grapes, cantaloupe, apples and strawberries!

Pretty good.  I made this last week for a dessert for dinner guests and I think people ate more of the dessert than the dinner.  I used 8 oz. strawberry cream cheese, and added 1 tsp. vanilla extract and about 1/3 cup Bacardi rum.  I also grated a strawberry over the dip to add some color, which I think worked great.  Will definitely make it again.

I am teetering between a 4 and 5 but will stick with a 5.  I made this for my mom's wedding reception and it WAS good...very good.  I just wish I had put in some cherry juice like advised because mine came out thick.  I would make this again in a heartbeat though....it was yummy!

This is sooo good. Instead of reg cream cheese i used raspeberry and lite whip cream to make it a a little lighter on the calories.

I made this yesterday and served it with assorted fruit. I was good enough to eat on it's own! I followed the other reviewers by using strawberry cream cheese and adding crushed pineapple.

Delicious! I love fruit dip and am always trying new recipes.Maybe I used fat free whipped topping because once i added it to the rest it didn't taste as sweet. So, I added one teaspoon of vanilla.

Wonderful!  My friend said she wanted to eat it by the spoonful just like another reviewer said :)  I made this with 8oz strawberry cream cheese and extra creamy whipped cream.  No problems with texture or consistency.  Next time my friends want me to add some crushed pineapple.

Most of the marshmallow fruit dips I've tried are a little too "marshmallowy". This one is perfect! I used 8oz of neufchatel instead of cream cheese and the dip tasted great! Thanks for sharing!

This was very tasty. I wanted to use up the rest of my cream cheese so I ended up using about double the suggested amount. Will serve with apples, oranges, melon, and cantelope for daughter's 5th birthday party.

Love the recipe! Made it yesterday for a baby shower, tinted it pink and it was so pretty. Served with strawberries,grapes and Granny Smith apple wedges. Think the apple wedges were the best with the dip. So good! Definitely a recipe that will stay in recipe box and will be shared. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This recipe is great as is, or using a full 8oz package of cream cheese, but I think the real key is let this sit in the fridge overnight. You can also have fun with it and add mix-ins to suit the event. I just added a splash of maraschino cherry juice to mine to make it pink for a V-day party today.

Everyone really enjoyed this dip. I did go with the recommendations and used 8 oz cream cheese. I think next time I will go with 4 or 6 oz.  I typically don't have an issue with cream cheese, but I felt that the marshmallow cream flavor was covered by cream cheese.

Do not take the advice of others to add more cream cheese. I've made this twice and 3 oz cream cheese is plenty. 8 oz is way too much it becomes a cream cheese dip.

This recipe was great.  I added strawberries and blueberries to the fruit dip to give it some extra color and flavor.  Thanks for sharing.

Pleasant tasting - not the absolute best but still very addictive!  I was bad though and drizzled caramel ice cream topping on top as a garnish.  It was a nice touch but still good on its own.  Thanks for the recipe!  Update:  I tried this with strawberry cream cheese and it is also good.

I used 8 oz of cream cheese, 3/4 cool whip added a tsp of vanilla and this was outstanding.  I made the adjustments based off of other reviews... It went great with strawberries!  Actually it was so good I had to run out to the store today for strawberries just so I could finish up the dip... Didn't want to waste anything that good!  You won't be dissapointed!

I made this exactly as the recipe stated and was disappointed.  The cool whip overpowered the other flavors.  If I made it again I would reduce the amount of cool whip and add vanilla as some other reviewers suggested.

I took this to a baby shower today and everyone loved it.  I used an 8oz pkg of strawberry cream cheese, and 1tsp of vanilla extract like others had suggested.  I also tasted this right after I made it and thought it was nothing special, but after sitting in the refrigerator overnight the flavors really came out and it tasted great. Next time I might try it with a different flavor cr. cheese, just for fun. Thanks for the great recipe.

This was wonderful. I followed other's suggestions and used a whole 8oz of Strawberry cream cheese and combined the ingredients with an electric mixer.  I also added a bit of vanilla extract. Very easy and very good.

YUM!!! Who knew something so simple could be so good?? I will use this fruit dip from here on out. Absolutely loved it! I used the French Vanilla flavored Cool-Whip and 8oz. of the cream cheese rather than the 3oz. listed. The Fluff ties the other two ingredients together perfectly. I warmed the cream cheese in the microwave for a few seconds and beat with electric mixer until is was smooth and then added the thawed out Cool-Whip and Fluff. By using the electric mixer, I found the texture to be wonderful. Great for dipping any kind of fruit or just a spoon by itself! Thanks for sharing this recipe!!!

Tasty, but a tad too sweet even for me, a sugar-lover.  I'll probably decrease the marsmallow fluff and add more cream cheese next time!

This was delicious!!  I made a double batch for a picnic, and everyone loved it!!  It's especially good with strawberries and grapes.  I added a little vanilla to it, but otherwise followed the recipe.

Rich and creamy, this dip is much better than just whipped cream!  I added two tsp of vanilla extract for a more 'nilla flavor.  Served with strawberries, bananas, grapes, cantalope and pineapple.  YUM!

Very good!  Adults and children enjoy this.  I serve it with strawberries.  I recommend beating the cream cheese well before adding the other ingredients (to prevent lumps).  Couldn't be easier.

Excellent.... I halved the recipe except for the cream cheese. As per other reviewers, I used 4oz. of strawberry cream cheese. I then used the dip as a base for fruit salad using grapes, blueberries, & some rinsed, canned friut I had on hand...Mandarin oranges, pineapple tidbits, & peaches. Worked great as a light dessert. Am planning to use the leftovers in lunches this week.

I took the suggestions from other reviews and used 8 ozs .strawberry cream cheese. When I first tasted I thought it was good, but a little too sweet for my taste, so I added just a splash of Orange Juice, (if I had to guess I'd say between 1/8 and 1/4 cup) and it made such a wonderful difference.  It also helped to thin the mixture out a little bit, making it easier to dip.

Quick and easy.  I used regular cream cheese and it would'nt blend in all the way.  Could definately detect the small particles of cr chz upon tasting.  Next time will use whipped cr chz for better overall consistency.  Also added a bit of maple and vanilla extracts.  Good reviews at the party I took it to.

This was a HUGE hit at the baby shower I hosted.  I made it per the recipe.  The ladies loved the light fluffiness of the dip.  My husband had some of the leftover dip and said with some modifications it could be a great pie base.

I made this for a party, and it was so delicious I wanted to hide in a closet and eat the entire bowl myself! I used 8 oz strawberry cream cheese, a 7 oz jar of marshmallow fluff, and only about 3 oz of extra creamy cool whip since it seemed like too much cool whip would dilute the flavor.  I will definitely make this again! It tasted best with apples, pineapple, and strawberries. Did not go well with melon.

My family goes crazy over this!  I always use a full 8 ounces of the cream cheese.  My tip is to let the cream cheese soften quite a bit before making - this makes the texture perfectly smooth.  Yummy!!

This was great!!!  Served it at my daughter's birthday party.  I used strawberry cream cheese and it was delicious. Served it with strawberries, kiwi slices, apple slices, pineapple chuncks, and grapes.  Everyone loved it. I almost ran out of dip before the party was over.

Yum!  I used the 8oz pkg of cream cheese and only used about half of the container of extra creamy cool whip.  It is great... very thick and fluffy. Awesome straight off of the spoon! ;o)

This recipe is the best as far as I'm concerned. I tried omitting the Extra Creamy Coolwhip, but it seemed to be missing something. So I added about 1/2 the container (6 oz?) to the mix, and voila'! Perfect! My daughter went through 4 bananas eating this dip! She couldn't get enough! I used Bananas, Pineapple, Strawberries and Fuji,Grannysmith apples. Addictive!!

Mmm Mmm! Very good dip! Made with strawbery flavored cream chesse and extra creamy Cool Whip as others suggested. Served with fresh strawberries, fresh pineapple, green grapes and green apple slices. Both kids and adults couldn't get enough (with or without the fruit! :) Flavor resembled a McDonald's strawberry shake!! Will definately make this one again! Thanks!

My friend brought some of this dip to work for a potluck, and I loved it so much, I went looking for the recipe. I followed the basic recipe, but added 4 oz of sour cream to cut some of the sweet. Tip: this is also a great dip for pretzels- the combination tastes like candy dipped pretzels.

This was a good, easy recipe, but I don't know if I'd make it again.  I used 8oz of cream cheese, because I knew 3 wouldn't be enough for me.  Still, was just good, not great.

I was kind of disappointed.  It was okay but was lacking something.  I made it for my daughters birthday party.  Everyone ate the fruit around it but not the dip. Oh well thanks anyway.

I made this for my daughters birthday party and everyone loved it.  I also did half the cool whip as others recommended and liked it that way.  A friend told me that she had never made it with cool whip but that she thought it made it taste a lot better.

Very good!  Always disappears quick at our house.  Could have something to do with the fact that my boyfriend prefers it by the spoonful instead of on fruit!

definitely a keeper. Very easy to make and its delicious. Make sure to buy lots of fruit. I ran out of strawberries, so we used grapes and pineapple. Very yummy!

Since my original post, I've made this over 30 times. People request this at potlucks and are dying to know what is in it. But Ive only told one or two people...it keeps them begging for more.

I was surprised, even my husband's family liked it-and they don't like anything that isn't made from Velveeta. I add 1/4 tsp. lemon juice, 1/4 tsp. vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp. almond extract.

My party guests LOVED THIS!  Great with strawberries. I agree with the other user: Use the full 8 oz. of cream cheese and not quite the whole container of whipped cream. This makes a thicker dip that sticks to fruit better.

I love easy recipes, so this was right up my alley. I used the entire 8oz. of cream cheese in Strawberry flavor and added 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract. It was a huge hit at my dinner party and I ended up handing out the recipe to others. Thanks so much! I will keep this recipe for good.

Tasty!  It has a different kind of texture to it.  I made the mistake of not softening the cream cheese before blending it and as a result, it came out strangely chunky.  The best part about this recipe is that it's inexpensive (good for parties, pot lucks, etc.), and it's FAST.

This was extremely simple and absolutely yummy!  It is not one of those sickening sweet dips either.  My daughters kept dipping spoonfuls to taste, claiming they were just making sure it was perfect!  
I might try adding strawberry cream cheese and or strawberry marshmellow fluff next time for a change.

I originally made these with kids in mind, and figured the adults would be eating their fruit plain.  I was wrong.  Grown-ups and kids were digging into this, including myself.  Especially good with strawberries!

This was very yummy and very refreshing.  We really enjoyed it.  I took the advice of some of the previous reviews and added milk, vanilla, and used 8 ozs of cream cheese.  It was so good with apples and oranges!

Two years in a row I have made this dip and served it with strawberries.  It was a hit again at the Christmas party.

I made this recipe for our annual Easter egg hunt.  My family couldn't stop eating the night before!  I took someone's advice and used light strawberry cream cheese but used the entire 8 ounces.    Great, easy recipe!

I made this dip to go along with a fruit tray and people were just eating it without the fruit. They loved the flavor.  This was a big hit.

This a great way to get kids to dive into the fruit tray at party.  I have also had it with a tablespoon of frozen orange juice mixed added to the mix - very good.

Excellent.  I used an 8 oz. package of cream cheese as others suggested.  It was especially good with strawberries and apple slices.

I tried these 2 ways, the way this was written and then again I hollowed out the strawberries and used the new whipped cream with vanilla frosting added a splash of OJ and amaretto piped in the strawberries then dipped in some crushed graham crackers, got raves on both.

Two thumbs up!  Made this for a party and everyone loved it.  I did the recommendation that someone else had said of putting 8oz strawberry creme cheese instead of the 3oz plain cream cheese.  It does make a lot of the fruit dip.  I'll be making this again.

I made this tonight to go with a fruit platter for a pot luck dinner.  It was awesome and so easy to whip up!  Just the right amount of sweet and a great creamy texture. I will absolutely make this again.  I would also like to use this for mini strawberry shortcakes the next time I have them.

very good.  Used 1/3 less fat strawaberry cream cheese and a little less than 1 full container of cool whip.  Consistency was great!

I love this recipe!  I make it whenever I have a party at home!  I do use the strawberry cream cheese (8 oz) and the thicker cool whip and sometimes add a little lemon or pineapple juice to it as well.  Very Yummy!

This stuff is amazing!!! I found myself eating it straight from the bowl w/ a spoon and ditching the fruit! Only used 3/4 container of Cool Whip as I didn't want to overpower the other ingredients. Thanks for a wonderful tasting fruit dip.

Lick-The-Beaters Delicious!!!  I made this fruit dip to accompany a fruit tray at a party and let me tell you, this dip is addicting.  My husband was licking the beaters and oohing and aahing.  I also used a full 8 oz. brick of cream cheese.

OMG this was sooooooooo good!!!  I also used the 8 oz cream cheese, and a bit less than the whole tub of cool whip.  I also added 2 teaspoons of vanilla.  It was gobbled up so fast!!!

I have used this recipe twice at 2 different parties and it has been a hit both times.  So good in fact that some of the girls weren't even using fruit to eat it!!!  Yep you read right, right out of the bowl.  Super easy and tastes great.  Thanks for sharing Carla!!!!

This dip is the best.  It gives your guests the option of adding a little bit more 'sweet' to your fruit salad or fruit tray.  Super easy to make!

Big hit at a party I went to.  I used 8oz of philly cream cheese blended at room temperature with the fluff then folded in whipped topping and couple drops of red food coloring.  Everyone wanted to know how to make.

Absolutely delicious!  I made it for a baby shower and dyed it pink with food coloring--it was a huge hit.  We just sat around with spoons and ate from the bowl.  I also made it for a poker party without dying it.  I preferred the food coloring--it hid where people just dipped the fruit in!  I used a full 8 oz of cream cheese and it was just wonderful.  Thank you so much for this recipe!

So easy and so good. It sticks to the fruit rather than dripping off like many dips. I've been asked for the recipe several times. Thanks!

Easy, yummy, and perfect for all kinds of fruit! I served this at a baby shower, and the mom-to-be wouldn't let anyone else near the bowl! Great for warm-weather get-togethers, especially when you have little time to prepare anything.

I followed suggestions by some of the other reviewers and added Eagle Brand milk (low fat), 1 tsp vanilla, and about 3 tbsp. powdered sugar.  It was great and at a church function of women, even though it made a large mixing bowl, only 3 oz were left afterward !   One lady said, it's better than ice cream!

I made this for a get together last weekend and WOW it was amazing! I followed some minor changes and used 8oz of whipped cream cheese, a little bit of vanilla and of marashino cherry juice. I have to print out the recipe and give it to everybody now. I think this may even be good with a touch of sour cream added.

I made this exactly as stated and it was sooo good! I think if you add more cream chese than stated the cream cheese would over power it. I used stawberries, green & red apples. Complimented the fruit very well.

Very addicting! I prefer mine with a little less Cool Whip. Too much Cool whip and the flavor overpowers the dip.

Made this (the night before) for my daughter's birthday party.  Kids AND parents gobbled this up with sliced apples, strawberries, and little banana/grape kabobs.  Amazing that something so simple, with so few ingredients could be so yummy and get my little girl to eat so much fresh fruit!

This was FANTASTIC!!  I made this for a wedding in November and used 8oz cream cheese, the marshmallow creme, and FRENCH VANILLA whipped topping.  It was ablsolute heaven with the strawberries.  I had many ask for the recipe before the night was over.  I am thinking about smearing it on pund cake and topping w/strawberries if I have leftovers next time.

I made this for my sister's Bridal Shower in July and it was gone in miniutes. This is such a simple dip to make but the impact it has with the fruit is amazing! This dip will be utilized every summer.

Love this! Have been making this for years and have the thighs to prove it, unfortunately! I usually use strawberry cream cheese and red food coloring to make it a pretty pink. Always a hit for parties, showers, work carry-in's, etc.

Very good! I used Lite cool whip, fat free strawberry cream cheese, and regular marshmallow cream.  I made it the day before so it got nice and thick. We only used apples to dip with, but would have been good with any fruit or vanilla wafers.

Very good- the texture was great with 8oz of cream cheese instead of 3oz.It cut the sweetness back a bit. Perfect addition to fresh strawberries.

Didn't use the dessert topping; instead added a bit of orange juice to thin out the mixture. Fabulous! Everyone was commenting on the dip, adults and children alike.

Very good recipe, but makes alot of dip. I will make again, but cut the recipe in half.  I did not add more then 1/4 cup of the sugar, it was fine without it.

This was great with strawberries, however i wish i would have whipped the cream cheese in a seperate bowl. It was hard to combine all of it and it took some time.

It was really really sweet and sugary, so added more cream cheese. It was alright, but I've had better fruit dip recipies.

Yum, Yum!!! I always have to make a double recipe. I've made this for holidays, parties, showers, you name it. It is always a big hit. My family askes that I bring it for every get-together. I use a little more than double the cream cheese...a total of 8 oz. I did it by mistake first, now I wouldn't change it. A definite keeper!

This fruit dip was absolutely wonderful!  I used a little bit of extra whipped cream, and four ounces of strawberry cream cheese, and it was wonderful.  No one could figure out what made it a little different from other dips, but once they found out that it had marshmallow in it they knew what it was!  I will be making this a lot more in the future!
