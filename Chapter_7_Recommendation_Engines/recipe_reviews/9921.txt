Great tasting and very easy to make.  Warning:  when toasting your coconut, check it frequently. I found out the hard way that coconut burns very quickly!

These had excellent flavor, but they got a bit too crispy.  I cooked them just until a bit golden brown - next time I will take them out earlier.

Excellent, easy recipe! Take care toasting coconut, it toasts quickly! Cooked beautifully, crunchy on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside -very coconutty and not too sweet!

I wasn't too crazy about these, maybe I did something wrong. I thought they browned too quickly, and if I reduced the baking time, they weren't quite done.  Just not what I was looking for.

good flavor but found out that foil needs to be coated with cooking spray to come off easily.
