A delicious lemon version of Key Lime Pie and just as delicious.  Just a couple of tips â€“ beat your egg yolks until thick and lemon-colored.  Add 1-1/2 tsp. of grated zest (I also used fresh lemon juice).  Baking this for 30-35 minutes is not necessary and may even be too long -   15 minutes is just fine.  I also used my own graham cracker crust: 1-1/4 c. graham cracker crumbs, 2 T. sugar and 5 T. butter, melted.  Pat into pie dish and bake at 350 degrees, 7-9 minutes.

I made this with fresh lemon juice and the zest of 1 lemon and made my crust with vanilla wafers and ginger snaps. Baked for 20mins and top with fresh whipped cream once completely cooled and refrigerated. My family loves this pie!!

Very good lemon pie. Easy and quick to put together. My family really liked it so that tells me I will be making this time and again. So simple and tasty. I am surprised more of you don't try this recipe.

This was really good! I used fresh lemon juice and the rind of two lemons. Came out very nice. Just enough tang. And very easy. Everyone loved it.

I made this to use up a can of sweetened condensed milk and we all loved it even more than it's key lime pie cousin!  I used a store-bought graham cracker crust and fresh lemons with about two teaspoons of zest.  I read a few reviews and only baked about 20 min.   Super easy, super good.  In a world of easy key lime pies, this tangy silky lemon pie stands out!

Very easy recipe!  Check your pie, and don't rely on the time quoted in this recipe.  I put it in the oven and set my timer while was busy doing other chores.  It overcooked.  It was not creamy, but was more like the consistency of pumpkin pie.  It did however taste GREAT!  I will definitely make it again and watch it closely.

My husband LOVED this.  Perfect consistency.  I, too, made my own graham cracker crust and baked for 20 minutes.  Perfectly textured.

I squeezed and added 1 cup of fresh lemon juice strained and lemon zest from all the squeezed lemons. I whipped the egg whites, 1/2 tsp of cream of tar tar and added sugar (about 1/2 cup but you might want more depending on individual). Whipped til stiff and peaked. Spread on top of pie and baked according to recipe.

This pie was perfection! I am a novice when it comes to baking pies, you'd never know it with this pie. It was so very simplistic but had a big impact. It was the very first dessert devoured by my family when I served it for Christmas. A repeat is near. Possibly for new years.

I AM NOT A COOK!!  This pie turned out fabulous.  It didn't  last 24 hours and I made another one 3 days later.  Thanks to the cooks who posted hints, I didn't cook it but 20 min. and it was perfect.  I made it the first time with whip cream topping and the second time with meringue.  Both were wonderful.  Easy, easy, easy!

Its just didnt have a"tangy" or "citrus " flavor to it because it wasnt enough lemon in it. Next time im going to add 3/4 cup lemon juice. And it was also missing that rich thick depth texture that I was looking for ,so I'll add maybe 1/2 cup of sourcream or cream cheese to it, and maybe addd some more lemon juice again since ill be adding sour/cream cheese so the lemon juice will even out and still be strong enough in lemon flavor. It was really creamy, like the title did say and thats a good thing! Not too sweet just right.  Also I baked mine for 25mins on 325 degree F.All in all, what can you say its a basic begginers recipe!

This is a refresher for me. The women in my family starting with my grandmother have made this for years. I'll make my next one where you actually use crushed graham crackers and butter to make the crust and beat the egg whites to make the meringue. It's been more than 20yrs since I've attempted to make any desserts. I'll keep you posted!

10 12 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/232936/eagle-brand-lemon-cream-pie/ ... 'Been making this for many years.  Original recipe beats whites w 1/3c sugar & 1/4+ 1/8t; bake at 350 for 12 to 15 minutes.  Rather than bake the crust, which is good,too, I make it (with margarine so it doesn't stick to the pie pan) & refrig for an hour.  More sweet than tart.  Gooood!

This is my favorite ice box pie recipe, It's easy to make and always tastes delicious. I use standard bottled lemon or lime juice and make a meringue topping instead of whipped cream.
