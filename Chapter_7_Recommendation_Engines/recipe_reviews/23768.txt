This is very similar to the buttermilk chess we make at my restaurant.  The only difference is that we add 4 ounces of dessicated coconut inside the shell before pouring in the filling.

I have several recipes for buttermilk pies.  However, this one is going to the top of the list.  Others turn out runny but this one cooked to a good consistency.  I let it cook awhile longer than the recipe called for so that may be the reason why, but still it has a great taste and the texture is wonderful.

This pie is fantastic! I made it on Easter and my mom asked me to make another one for her birthday.

I suggest using a deep dish pie crust because there's too much filling for a standard 9-inch shell. I saved the extra and baked an 8-inch pie a few days later. YUM!!!

absolutely awesome and easy as can be. I did find that I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer then the desired amount on the recipe card.

This is definitely a classic pie, but I just didn't fall in love with this one. (Mind you, my family loves this and would definitely kick me in the hiney for giving a mediocre review!) It had a good flavor and good texture, but I guess I miss the chocolate and peanut butter and marshmallows and all of that ooey, gooey stuff.  Don't know if I'll make it again, but hope this doesn't discourage anyone from at least trying it.  Thanks anyway Krystina.

We all loved it and it stored so nicely in the fridge. Make sure the pie crust is deep-dish. Easy, quick and yummy!!!

ENTIRELY too sweet, but has a great texture!  I'll make it again and 1/2 the sugar.  Really easy.  I let it bake around 1 1/2 hours also.  I'll be making it again in 4 days :)

I just ate a warm piece of this pie less than 5 minutes ago. Yummy! I read the previous reviews and followed the most common suggestion- less sugar. I used 1 1/2 cups instead of two, and I added a tablespoon of white vinegar because it's called for in my other recipes. My baking time was 55 minutes. I think I could've gotten away with 50, but the other suggestions mentioned much longer cooking times. It just takes a little while to set. I covered the crust edge and removed it at 45 minutes. Next time, I'll gently lay a loose piece of foil over the whole pie to prevent over-browning. Whisk it well, and strain if you're afraid of getting those tiny little egg pieces. Great flavor and texture!

It was so easy to make, I agree with the other the prep time was 5 min not 30. Very sweet next time I would use less sugar.

This recipe was a split vote in our hallway. Some folks loved it and others...well could leave it. It is sooo very rich, but tastes wonderful.  Another review suggested straining the mixture to improve the consistency. We added extra Vanilla, and baked it longer.

I'd eat the entire pie at once, if it didn't make me feel guilty.  I cut both the butter and sweetener in half:  I use 1/4 butter, 1/2 C. sugar, and 1/2 C. Splenda.  I also use heaping tablespoons of the flour.  This recipe is perfect for a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate, and the cooking time is as stated (45 min.) in my oven.  It's one of our favorites.
UPDATE 12-29-11:  I made the most outstanding topping for this recipe.  I needed a filler for my pie, which rattled around in a 10-inch pie pan:
Whip together 1 8-oz. tub marscarpone cheese; 1 cup whipping cream; a few T. sugar; and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  Spread this topping on the cooled Chess Pie and refrigerate.  I happened to have those extra ingredients in the fridge to use up after Xmas, and this equates to one rich (and deliciously decadent) pie -- only to be consumed on special occasions.  The way I make it, it's not too sweet at all.  Cut back on all that butter and sugar!

Hi!  I first want to say that this is the first pie I have ever baked! I am not a cook but after Thanksgiving I figured I would give it a try.  I have eaten Chess Pie before and loved it.  For my first time I was brave to alter the recipe but I did... I added a tablespoon of cornmeal and a teaspoon of white vinegar.  Dont ask me why but it sounded good and luckly ended up being GREAT! My mom always added lemon juice to hers but I didnt really enjoy it that way. I cooked mine in a glass deep dish 9" pie dish.  I did cook it for about 30 mins longer than suggested and let cool in oven.  It was not soupy but set nicely and tasted wonderful. It browned and cracked perfectly on top.  Be sure to put foil over the crust before you put it in or it will get too burnt. I remembered about 15 mins after I put it in and it was a hassle getting the foil on there since it was really liquidy and hot.  All in all it was a great pie and super easy to make if I could do it.  Plus an added bonus my home smells wonderful now!

I used 3 Tablespoons of flour because I thought that's what I read. It is delicious and I made a second one and used 3T instead of 2T just because it was so good. 50 minutes at 350, turned the oven off and left it in the oven for another 10 minutes, took it out to cool. Cut it while it was still too hot to eat and it did not run. No clear liquid, zero liquid! This reminds me of pies my mother would bring home sometimes when I was a child. We called them custard pies. Doesn't matter what you call them they are fantastic. Thanks Kristina for a simple and most delicious recipe.

Made too many changes to give this 5*. Only had three eggs, so increased the buttermilk to 1 cup. Added just 1-1/4 cups sugar and it was sweet enough for us, and also cut the amount of butter in half. Also cooked it a bit longer. Great texture, great flavor,... delicious!!

My family really enjoyed this pie. It is similar to the one I usually make, perhaps a little sweeter. The only thing I did different was use two regular pie shells and poke a few holes in the bottom of the pie shells with a fork and rubbed with a tsp of sugar and cornmeal,then baked for about 5 minutes in preheated oven before filling with liquid mixture. Helps the crust stay a little flakier.

I have been looking for a recipe like this for many years, ever since I had a buttermilk chess pie at a Mark's Feed Store restaurant.  Unlike some of the other reviewers, I did not have too much filling - it was a perfect amount for a 9 inch pie.  I did bake this pie about 10 minutes longer than recommended, though.        This pie is very sweet, so unless you have a major sweet tooth (like me!), you won't like it.

Great Pie and easy to! After reading others I did add the coconut (2 oz) to pie shell and it was great. I also preheated to 450° and turned down to 350° when I put the pie in, I also left the pie in after 45 min. and turned the oven off to let the pie cool. It came out beautiful.

Sweet, creamy filling under a thin, crispy top over a perfect flaky crust, YUMMY! Even better cold.  I have made it three times since thanksgiving for my family and have only had two pieces.  Must be good...I used a 9" deep dish and baked until it was puffy and golden on top, a little longer than 45 min.  The top flattened out after it cooled and it was YUMMY FOR THE TUMMY.

I have been eating chess pie all my life. My granny made this from a recipe in her head. Unfortunately she cant remember it anymore :( The first time I made this, I felt like it had way to much egg. I adjusted this time. I only did 4 eggs and I also strained the mixture. OMG it worked wonders on this pie. It is  PERFECT.

This recipe is like money! i have tried it twice! The first time it was a tad to sweet. After reading the reviews, I made some changes. I subbed 1 1/2 cups Brown Sugar, 4 eggs, 1 Tble Cornmeal, 2 teas vanilla, 1 teas cinnamon, 1/4 teas nutmeg. I baked crust for 7 minutes, then added mixture and baked for 1 hour and 30 minutes. WOW! This is a keeper and so so simple! Thanks for posting!

WOW!! I have been looking for a good recipe for Chess Pie for a long time, and I struck gold finding this one!! My husband loves chess pie, but I had never even tasted one before. I tried a different recipe a couple of years back and it was a disaster. I gave up until I saw this recipe and decided to give it another try. I am sooooo glad that I did. The recipe made two 9-inch pies, and I did bake it a bit longer. It was delicious. My husband and his family LOVED it.  I gave the extra pie to my very pregnant best friend and lets just say it didn't last very long. Everyone is begging for the recipe!!! Thank You so much!!

This pie was very good. It was a hit with my family. It taste old fashion like pie use to taste when grandma made it. I followed the direction as stated. You get more filling than the recipe say. I ended up with a deep dish and regular pie.

This was simple and a huge hit. I made 10 pies and the reviews I got were all great. Many said it was the best pie they ever had. I did not change a thing, and this recipe made 2/ 9" pies.  I made this for a fundraiser bake sale. I made a "test" pie, which was gobbled up. Thanks for the recipe~ it's a keeper.

As with my other Chess pie recipe, I have to cook it for at least 30 more minutes to get the center to set.  So, to keep my crust from burning, I make a tin foil tent to cover the whole pie.  This seems to help with the setting of the center and my crisco crust always comes out right.

This was good, but too eggy.  Next time I won't used quite as many eggs.  I also had to cook it about 15 minutes longer.

The pie was very delicious.  My teenage daughter waited only 5 minutes after baking it to get a slice.  I made a few changes to the recipeby using only 1 cup of sugar, 1/4 cup of melted butter, 3 eggs and added some nutmeg.  The consistency was fine and it was not too sweet.  This is a winner in my family.

I have never made anything similar to this, so I had to simply trust the recipe based on the positive reviews.   A new friend expressed a desire for 'chess bars', so I settled on this recipe.  I made it in a square dish (11"x7"?) and there was more than enough filling.  I had to bake it longer because of the larger dish, but it turned out well.   Southern husband says it's good....that's my rating system.   ;-)

I fixed it exactly like the recipe, and it was delicious. You have to understand that chess pie is supposed to be very sweet, otherwise it would be called something else. Don't add anything or take away anything or cover it or change the recipe or cooking instructions. Enjoy it.

I do a lot of quantity cooking, for about 50-75 people. This recipe worked GREAT to multiply to feed hungry young men! I needed about 60-70 servings. I multiplied the recipe by six and bought twelve frozen pre-made pie crusts (not deep dish). Note that means each recipe fills two pie crusts. I pre-baked the pie crusts on huge cookie sheets (best if you line them with foil to simplify cleanup) for about 10 minutes, till the crust was solidified but not browned. In making the batter, I reduced the amount of sugar by one-third, following other reviewers. I poured the batter into the baked pie shells, then sprinkled about 2 ounces of coconut on top of each pie.  I covered the whole cookie sheet with foil and baked till they were puffy and golden. Absolutely delicious and very easy, plus a pretty cheap way to feed a very yummy dessert to a crowd! By my estimate, those 72 servings (a sixth of a pie) cost a total of about $23 to make (including the pie shells and coconut), so that's about 32 cents a serving to make. Quite a bargain for something so rich and delicious! If you wanted to add to it, you COULD add whipped cream but this pie stands very well on its own!

Love the taste and texture. Next time will use deep dish crust and I also had to cook for 5 mins longer. Taste just like it did when I was a kid growing up.

The best and easiest buttermilk pie I have ever made. I get lots of great feedback as well! The bake time does need to be increased by about 5 -10 minutes

This is just like the buttermilk pie my mom used to make. It took me back to what I call the good-old days, a glass of cold sweet milk and a piece of buttermilk pie. I keep it in the fridge because I like it cold. Thanks for the recipe.

This was SOOOO good!  We loved it....had a great flavor and texture and definately satisfied the sweet tooth!  I was looking for a quick and easy last minute dessert and this was perfect!  I did have to bake an additional 15 minutes for my filling to set....probably because I used a 9 inch deep dish.  Thanks for the recipe Krystina :)

Easy to make, but I agree you need a deep dish pie shell, I could only fit about 2/3 of the filling in the shell. The top was a little over cooked but that may just be the difference in my oven. Overall good taste. Never thought a chess pie would be so simple to make.

This was as good or better than the chess pies my mom makes, and my grandmother before her.  Will definitely make again.  Made as directed, I get enough filling for two deep dish pie crusts.

I took the advice of other people's reviews and tried 1 less egg and 1/2 cup less sugar. Also cooked for an additional 10 minutes. This pie had absolutely NO flavor. Tasted nothing like chess pie.

I am giving this pie 4 stars because it contains too much sugar.  I am as southern as it gets when it comes to taste and cooking but this was way too sweet.  I will make this again but cutting the sugar in half.

This pie was delicious. Very sweet though, and I had to bake it for 1 1/2 hours. The oil from the butter rose to the top and I had to skim it off. Overall, it turned out great.

Chess pie is my favorite of all and I always ask my aunt to make it for me but since I didn't go home this year I thought I'd try to make it myself.  This is a delicious recipe!  For those who thought this was to sweet, that's the way chess pie is supposed to be.  It's a very sweet, rich pie.

This recipe has become one of my families favorites!  It is quick to make
with ingredients we normally have around the house.  I also reduced the sugar to 
1 1/2 cups and I doubled the amount of vanilla called for.  I am going to try to modify the recipe next time I make it to make a chocolate chess pie.  Thanks for the recipe!

Brought to potluck and coworkers said it was the best buttermilk chess pie they've had yet! Used mexican vanilla in recipe and cooked for 1hr 10 minutes for 1 full-regular pie crust. NOTE: You can get 2 pies out of this recipe using regular sized crust or 1 deep-dish pie.

This was very good and so easy to make (prep time is less than 10 mins., not 30).  Very sweet, I may cut back a little on the sugar next time.  I baked as directed but it would not set up.  I baked it for an additional 15 mins., then left in the oven for 5 or 10 mins. more with the oven off.  It was still quite soft in the middle.  It seemed to set up fairly well as it cooled but even after chilling all night, it was fairly runny when cutting.  I would increase the heat to 375º and bake it closer to an hour next time.  I made my own crust for a deep dish pie pan and it filled it up pretty well.  A keeper.

Very easy recipe. With very common ingridents. I am not much of a baker but you couldn't tell it with the ease of this pie. My husband took it to work and he had several e-mails stating it was very good.

Wonderful recipe!  Tastes so good my family fights over it.  My husband wants me to make this pie every week!  I turned down the temperature just a little bit and it takes about 1.5 hours to cook, but I will never complain.

im originally from atlanta ga., since then have moved to virginia.  a relative from dalton, ga. made the pie for me and since i have been in virginia no one knows what a buttermilk pie is nor have they heard of it.  i was relieved to find the recipe on the site.  any way i made the pie and it was just as i remembered it when i was a little girl.  thanks a bunch for posting the recipe and helping me rekindle my childhood.
sincerely yours,

I've made it twice this week! It was so easy and fast. Everyone from 3 to 80 loved it. I made it following the recipe exactly but I did cook it one hour. I served it with cut up strawberries and whipped cream. I will make it again and again. So easy!

I made this for Easter and it was a hit! Very tasty, I will certainly make it again. Only changes I made were 1 1/2 cups of sugar and I baked for 50 minutes. It looks bubbly and juicy when you take it out of the oven like it isn't done, yet it is, just has to set. Had some mixture leftover in the bowl, that's ok, I ate it with a spoon :).

I loved this recipe! I made it once and everybody told me that it should be my " specialty" for family/friend get togethers. I recommend eating warm with sugared raspberries and whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. You HAVE to try this pie!

this tastes exactly like my mamaw's buttermilk pie, and she made the best!  the recipe is very easy, although, I found I had to bake it about 15 minutes longer than it calls for.  this pie is like crack.

Yes, it's sweet. Chess pie is supposed to be sweet. ;) I made it exactly as the recipe was written & it turned out great! I didn't have any problems with butter oozing in the middle at all. I'm wondering if those who did, may have used margarine instead of real butter? Or maybe made a deep dish pie, which would have made the custard thicker?
I did half the recipe, which was just enough to make one reg. 9 in. pie (not deep dish). And, of course... used my pie shell ring to keep the edges from burning. If you like chess pie, this is a keeper.

I bake this pie for 1 hour to 1.25 hours.  There may be a little "moisture" (i.e. butter!) in the center of the pie when done.  I just use a clean paper towel to absorb the extra moisture.  I also wrap my pie edges with foil to prevent over browning.  And I generally place the empty pie shell on the oven rack, and pour the pie mixture directly into the pie shell, and carefully slide the rack into place.

Followed the ingredients exactly... It is a little too sweet but I love it!!! As for the directions... I added foil around the pie crust and baked for 55 minutes. The pie came out golden brown and perfect.

Not bad.  It was my first time and like some of the other reviews I did make a slight change.  I used 4 eggs instead of 5.  It was a little loose in the middle by the end of the 45 min time, but I left it in the oven with the heat turned off and it helped.  Once it set it was fine.

Chess pie is wonderful stuff. Anyone know if there's a difference if using cultured buttermilk (cultured skim milk) vs. old-fashioned buttermilk (cultured milk left after butter-making)?

I make this every year for Thanksgiving for my family, in memory of my grandmother, and it is always a HUGE hit!  In fact, I got requests for the pie for Christmas presents!  My only modification:  Add 1 tsp of cinnamon to the mix before pouring it into the pie shells!  Mmmmm!

This was a very good recipe, and so quick and easy to make. The prep time was much less than 30 mins even when making my own crust and I cooked it a little longer until set (recipes ARE just guidelines after all). This is one of my go-to pies from now on.

So so so GOOD! I, along with my entire family, LOVED this pie. The only thing I did differently from the recipe was that I left it in the oven 15 minutes longer than the recipe said. At 45 minutes it was very runny, so I upped the temp to 375 and cooked it for 15 minutes longer. This was the BEST pie I've ever had!

This was pretty good, a little too rich, so I think I would cut the sugar. It didn't firm up like custard like I thought it would.

This pie is awesome. I made it for my brother and he went crazy over it. He ate the rest of it the next day.

I definitely agree with others that said too much sugar. if I try again with this one it'll get about half the sugar. I made the mistake of making the recipe and putting it in the oven and then sitting down and looking at reviews. wish I had looked at a few reviews before I made it.

This was the easiest pie I’ve ever made! Very yummy, however, I would suggest using a deep dish pie crust to put all the filling in. The picture was from Christmas dinner. I had a small amount of liquid that didn’t fit into the crust without running over. Making another for New Years and the deep dish crust was perfect!

Amazing! I took it to Thanksgiving dinner  & everyone said "Buttermilk Pie?" then 5 min later they were coming back for more. Big hit.

This pie was just okay. I agree with the other reviewer who said it tasted too eggy. Most chess pie has the same amount of sugar but one less egg. If I ever make this again I’ll try just 4 eggs. I used a 9” deep dish pie pan, and it wasn’t overflowing at all.

After reading the reviews I decided to follow the recipe without changes. Mistake. It is too sweet. Something too sweet for my family is unusual. Maybe if you serve slivers of it?  Another thing, it’s still a little to much even for a deep dish. It was hard for me to get into the oven without spilling it. I believe it would make 2 regular pies. I may try again because the ingredients are things you may have on hand but be cutting the sugar, probably by half.  I think  I might have had a different pie in mind, this didn’t seem to be the Chess pie of my childhood. IDK,may try the Buttermilk pie because I kept thinking this would be better with lemon in it and that’s a buttermilk pie.

It was a very good pie.  This was my first time making it.  The only thing I would suggest changing is cutting the sugar down a bit.  I love sweets but this was a bit too sweet for me.  Other than that it was awesome.

Very good but should have added more flour.  maybe a whole additional tablespoon or at least 2 heaping tablespoons.  Better to let the pie cool in the refrigerator overnight to set.  I made the mistake of trying to slice/eat before it was cooled completely.

Definately a great classic pie, but that said, you need to use a deep dish pie crust and add 30 minutes to the cooking time, and reduce the sugar by at least 1/2 cup. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon because that's what I add to my egg custard pies.

I made it exactly as written and it turned out great.  That’s just what I want when I bake:  no alterations required.  It has a really unique flavor that I wouldn’t have attributed to the buttermilk!   I’m definitely going to make this again!

Made with a graham cracker crust, use a scant cup or rounded 3/4c sugar (vice 2 whole cups), and topped with strawberries or strawberry compote.

This was excellent but just a little too sweet.  I will cut the sugar 1/2 cup next time.  I will probably substitute splenda for the sugar too and will update!

Super easy to make in 5 minutes. Like others, I cut the sugar in half and it was the perfect amount of sweetness. I served it with strawberries tossed in Canadian Maple Syrup and I think that was a must. I will definitely keep this one to make again.

Way way too sweet! I had wondered about cutting the sugar down when I saw two cups and I should have gone with my instinct. Even my 12 year old son said it was too sweet. Pie did set up nicely though and it had a good texture but I threw the whole pie out because we couldn’t  stomach how sweet it was.

This is one of the best pies I’ve ever made; people lose their MINDS over it!!! I put a splash of coconut flavoring in with the vanilla then line the pie crust with about 1/2C coconut. Look, it’s so good it’ll make you wanna slap yo mamma!!!

I've tried 4 Buttermilk pie recipes and this is my favorite. The only changes were the addition of 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground nutmeg  to the custard and a scratch made all butter pie crust. I start the pie on the lowest rack level for about 20 min. to help the crust brown on the bottom and then turn it and move it to the middle for the rest of the cooking time. I put the pie in the oven about 2/3 of the way full and finish adding the custard.

I've made this twice. The first time I cooked it the length of time stated in the recipe and it didn't set up too well. The second time though I cooked it about 15 minutes longer and it was perfect. The texture was wonderful and it is deliciously rich.

Awesome... my chess pie is sexy.  I had substituted homemade buttermilk (1 tablespoon of lemon juice & 3/4 cup of milk, let sit at least 5 min to thicken) to the recipe but otherwise it is oh so sexy and looks delicious to devour ??

Reduced the butter to 5 TBS and increased cooking time to around an hour, but otherwise followed as written. It was delicious and everyone wanted the recipe.

Delicious and easy peasy with staple ingredients. My 15 year old son's eyes glazed over  when he took a bite. I did have to bake it about 15 minutes longer than the recipe said. It wasn't near set at 45 minutes. And can we say this pie is healthy with all the eggs and buttermilk with 6 grams of protein per serving? ;)

I made some of the alterations to this that people suggested. I decreased the sugar by half a cup. I used one tbsp of flour (instead of two) and added two tbsp of cornmeal (which was not listed at all originally but is typical for chess pie). I baked at 350° for one hour (instead of 45 min). The texture was perfect after cooling for about 90 minutes at room temp. In the end, it was decent, but not grand. The flavor was quite eggy -- like sweet quiche almost. I feel like five eggs is just too much in terms of the ratio of other ingredients. If you like the flavor of this pie but had trouble with the texture, these tips are recommended. I just wasn't a huge fan of the flavor. I have a regular buttermilk pie recipe I'll stick to that has less eggs, is very creamy, and has more of a vanilla flavor to it. This was worth a try but won't be making it again. I do hope to find an awesome chess pie recipe, though, because I've tried it in a restaurant that made an amazing version (which had cornmeal in it)! Happy baking!

I followed the directions EXACTLY , but my pie didn't set. Then I tried using 3 Tbsp of flour like some of the other reviews mentioned, but at 45min it still wasn't set. At 1hr it wasn't set, and again at 1hr 20min still no. I don't know why it wont set in the middle, but I'm not using this recipe again!!

This pie was simple and delicious.  My family prefers it served cold, but it's also good warm from the oven.  I prefer this recipe to the ones with corn meal.

The recipe calls for 2 cups of sugar. I used 1 1/2 but still too sweet. The pie was good. I will try 1 cup next time.

I made mine with gluten free flour and gluten free pie crusts because my boyfriend and I can’t eat anything with gluten and you couldn’t tell the difference, because I have made it before without the gluten free and both are delicious.  I suggest if your not using a deep dish to use two pie shells because this recipe makes too much for just one pie. Two pies are better than one anyway :)

I made it just like the recipe called for accept dropping the sugar by 1/2 cup.  It was delicious and it was all I could do not to go back for a second piece, and my first one was not small!  This will be my next "take-to-dinner" dessert.

I used 1 cup of sugar as suggested, but I think that was a mistake. After 45 minutes of baking the center wasn't set (I thought). After 13 more minutes, I saw why - nearly all the butter baked out. It was tasty, but NOT chess pie.  Was it the sugar?

Great, easy pie!  Unfortunately, I added an extra tablespoon of flour per another review, but the texture would have been better without it. Next time,  I will stick with the original amount.  However, I did reduce the sugar by a half cup,  and I was happy with the lesser amount.

Great taste, but seems slightly granular. I think that was my fault, as the butter was on a low slow melt, rather than a higher heat melt, and it seemed like it didn't incorporate well. I will try this again, just to be sure. Very easy to make, and yes, a deep dish pie plate would be recommended.

The pie was delicious! I followed it to the letter but had a little extra left that wouldn't fit in my 9" crust though. Next time I'll be prepared with a second crust!

Delicious every time! I always mix my filling up without the butter (I usually go a little scant on the sugar) and let it sit while I roll out my pie crust and get it in the pan. Add the butter, pour it in the pan and after 45 minutes it come out perfect every time.

I made this as written and while it was good, next time I will make some changes. First off, it is way too sweet. I would cut down on the sugar by at LEAST half a cup. It needs some acidity to balance the sweetness, so maybe some lemon juice would be good.

I will definitely make this again . Will be a standard for the holidays . 

 I crashed 1/3 package of graham crackers and added the powder to the mix before baking .  A little cinnamon added to the mix is wonderful to . 

 Everyone loves this pie.

I made this exactly as instructed except used deep dish Pyrex and baked 80 min. Then I let it cool in the oven for 15 min. I also made a blueberry sauce to drizzle over the pie

This is my favorite of the many excellent Chess Pie recipes on this site. I haven't found a bad one yet, and I've tried about 4, but I find myself using this recipe whenever I make it. My grandmother used to make a version of this once in a blue moon. Because it was only for holidays, I always tended to think of CP as both a special treat, and a secret only grandmothers knew. More common in the South, where I grew up, than in the Northeast, where I have lived most of my adult life, CP is  something I had not seen or tasted for years. I wasn't really even sure what it was called, so when I found this and learned that (a) the recipe is not and never was a secret only my grandmother knew, and (b) it is incredibly easy to make.

I served this at our Father's Day BBQ.  No one, even myself, had ever heard of a buttermilk pie, much less had tasted one.  OMG!  My son called it "sinfully good," and he was right.  My husband has requested it for dessert tonight!

Made it for the crew in the oil patch and they loved it.  Not one bad comment. That is very unusual around here. "As good as my Momma's " was even heard a time or two. That is the highest praise a cook can get in the oil patch.

Fantastic recipe....But I don't consider it a traditional chess pie. It's more like an egg custard pie, which is very similar but not the same.... VERY Good.... I've made it with the 2 cups of sugar and found it too sweet.... tried it again with the 1 1/2 cup of sugar and it was PERFECT! I'll make it again, but it's really a buttermilk egg custard pie in my pie loving opinion.

Not sure why everyone thinks this is super sweet, I made the pie exactly how it was written and it turned out delicious! however, I do think you should bake at least 10 minutes longer, it's a bit runny. Also, a 9 inch pan worked fine for me.

This pie reminds me of the one my grandma used to make. I was very happy when I found this recipe. First time I made it exactly as instructed. We thought it was a bit too sweet. Cut the sugar down to 1.5 c and it came out perfect. Had to cook a lot longer than 45 min. I double the recipe and use 2 deep dish crusts. Lots of family to feed.

I liked the fact that it was so quick to get into the oven.....however....It was forever before it was cooked in the middle.  I also had a lot of butter bubbling up in the middle of the pie. I know it was overcooked in the end, but the flavor was terrific, so I'll try it again next week to figure out what went wrong.

This pie was wonderful and a hit with the family.  It is easy to make and the prep time was closer to 5 minutes than 30.  I made two for Christmas Dinner and had requests for more on New Year's Day.  Clockwork

Since it was my first time making this pie, I made two. I altered the recipe for my dad. I replaced 1/3 of the sugar with splenda. Got lots of compliments on the pie. I will make again if requested.

I followed the recipe on this exactly and it was just what we were looking for, sweet, smooth and buttery.  I made a second pie and added a good handful of toasted coconut to the filling before pouring it into the crust and it turned out great, too.

This recipe is perfect! I have made this a few times and hardly ever alter it!  One time I did and added a pinch of cinnamon. Or was it nutmeg...No it was cinnamon LOL and it was awesome! Matter of fact, I'm going to bake another right now :)

This was an okay recipe.  Like some of the other reviewers said, I probably could have gotten away using less sugar, and it was really eggy tasting.  I'm not sure if I'd make it again.

This was the absolutely delicious!  I made it for Father's Day and it was a huge hit.  It is very rich so I was able to get 12 servings out of a deep dish pie.  I will definitely make again!!

i was disappointed with this recipe, especially after all the great reviews. it was, as others said, pretty "eggy". i even tried 4 eggs instead of 5. the sugar was a bit much. probably will try a different recipe next time.

The perfect Chess Pie. I got so many compliments, even from someone who has never cared for Chess Pie before. I am so thrilled that I have now replaced a recipe that was lost to our family when my great grandmother passed away. Thanks for posting this one!

Pie ended up tasting like pound-cake-in-a-crust.  Not altogether bad .... just not what I was looking for.  I think I just prefer my chess pie more "custardy."

UPDATE: 3/14/2012 -- I made this pie for "Pi Day."  I'm not sure what I did differently, but this time it was very nicely "custardy," and very eggy (a good thing, for me).  It was, though, tooth-achingly sweet, even after reducing the sugar by a half cup.

The pie itself tasted delicious. I had to keep it in the oven quite a bit longer than the recipe said. I think it was more like 1h15 by the time the filling was set.

This was an acceptable buttermilk pie recipe however it was not nearly as rich and yummy as others I have had.

It's very sweet and I thought it needs something to go with it, to add some more flavor. But my husband loved it. He ate it once mixed in with a serving of MaltoMeal. I just can't personally give it a 5 star cuz I didn't prefer it. & you need to bake it longer until it looks dark brown like the picture.
