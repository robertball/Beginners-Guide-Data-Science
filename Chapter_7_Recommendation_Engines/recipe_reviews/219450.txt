This totally satisfied our craving for mac and cheese! I sprinkled in a few drops of liquid smoke and shook in some powdered mustard, omitted the butter and used less crumbs. 
Next time I'll toss the cheese mix into the food processor for a more uniform look (no need to see chunks of cottage cheese in the final product) 

~Thanks Chuck, this one's a keeper!!!

My husband and I enjoyed this mac & cheese version.  I used greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  I would suggest to use 1/2 cup of bread crumbs it seemed to be too much topping. We plan on making this again.

My husband and 5 yr old loved this. I used 12 oz of Ronzoni Smart Taste elbow pasta and regular Daisy sour cream. I also only used 1/4 cup of bread crumbs and sprayed the top with Pam Butter spray to omit the butter. I used the recipe builder on myfitnesspal.com and it was 485 calories/serving for 6 servings. Served with a side salad and it was awesome! Thanks for the recipe!

I was a bit skeptical when I saw the ingredients, but I wanted a healthier version of a family favorite. Not only is this recipe a healthier version of traditional mac and cheese, it's delicious! The second time I tried it I omitted the topping, reducing the calories and fat/cholesterol content even further. It wasn't missed. I also added a little bit of skim milk to make the sauce even creamier.

All 4 of us liked this!!!  This includes 2 teenage girls and my husband.  All of us liking something doesn't happen often, so thanks for submitting it.  Generally, anything called "Healthier" doesn't go over well.  BUT I have been trying to get away from red meat and striving for meatless and tried this.  Used regular pasta and breadcrumbs, no wheat variations.  Regular cheddar cheese, no lowfat available. Definitely worth a try, if you're on the fence.  Will be making this regularly.

I have now made this 3 times with many comments - all positive. I even gave some to a friend but didn't tell him what was in it because he doesn't like cottage cheese or sour cream. He loved the mac&cheese, then I told him the contents. He would like more!! I made exactly as directed.

This recipe was delicious! I made a few changes. I doubled the macaroni. I took the advice from the other reviewers and blended the cottage cheese in a blender. I added 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon dry mustard, 1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper, 1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire. I reduced the bread crumbs to 1/2 cup and used Panko bread crumbs, and added only 1 Tablespoon of butter to them. Baked for 35 minutes in an 8 by 11 pan. And since I doubled the macaroni there's about half the fat per serving! Thanks for sharing!

I love mac and cheese but I don't make it very often because it's so high in fat and cholesterol. Both my husband and I really enjoy  this recipe and I've made it several times now, always great. The yogurt and cottage cheese gives it the right texture, just pulse the cottage cheese a little longer so the lumps aren't distracting. Thank you so much for a healthy mac n' cheese!

Used Barilla plus (I can't digest wheat pasta) but followed the recipe exactly else as written. Had a bite before baking and thought 'egh' and was a little worried but was able to adjust for seasonings then. After baking and taking the first bite, the husband and I groaned - it's so cheesy and good. After gobbling down his portion, the husband said 'This mac and cheese is RIDICULOUS'.  Perfect accompaniment (and so easy to make) for ribs or burgers with a salad. No one cheese stands out, and the hubby was even a little skeptical 'Hmm, cottage cheese, huh?' but it all worked out. I thought it was a little dry, not sure what I'd do to make it a little saucier - maybe milk like others have said? I agree with the others - the topping is good but not needed.

Sometimes you just need Mac and Cheese, and this reduces the guilt. I don't bother with the bread crumbs. Love this recipe!

Great mac and cheese with real cheese and less fat. I didn't put bread crumbs on mine or use any butter to cut the calories and fat.  I also used plain greek yogurt and not sour cream. It came out good but a little dry. Will add some milk to it next time to see if I can make it a little more creamy.

Definitely too much bread crumbs.  The whole dish was just to dry tasting.

Tastes pretty good, doesn't look so good. Will put the cottage cheese and Greek yogurt (I substituted for sour cream) in the blender first.

Made this recipe today... I tripled the ingredients (to freeze for future meals) and it filled a 9 x 13 dish with enough left over for one small loaf pan... I can't see it (as is) filling a 9 x 13... unless I did something wrong...?  The flavour is good... but I do not like seeing the cottage cheese "chunks"... I should have processed them first... due to those two concerns, I give this a 3 star....

This was delish and got great reviews from my guests. I prefer to shred my own cheddar ( do it....flavor is much better) and i added 1/2 cup a milk like the original recipe. i used crushed whole wheat ritz crackers. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because the cottage cheese gives it a weird consistency.

Put all sauce ingredients in food processor.  Added some onion and garlic powder and 1/2 tsp. worcestershire.  Topped w/panko sprayed w/PAM.  For last few minutes put under broiler.
