I've made this twice exactly as written, and it is excellent. I like to add a bit of brown sugar near the end of it's simmer time to counter the acid and add a mellow note. Then I began to play with it.  Balsamic vinegar (white or red) is a nice substitution. I was out of celery once and no one noticed, so I don't bother with it anymore.  They're also just as happy with my quick-cooked take on this which uses (don't judge!) dried minced onions and only simmers for 30 minutes. It's more of a dump-and-cook affair.  It tastes almost exactly like the longer-cooking original with much less time and effort. Most of the time I do it quick, but sometimes I bring the love with fresh onions and let it simmer it all day.  Fast or slow, this is amazing tomato sauce, on par with the best of the restaurant sauces.

This is a great basic red sauce that can be used in anything needing a red sauce. The first time you make it make the recipe exactly as written and include ALL ingredients including the anchovy paste which adds no anchovie flavor but a nice subtle richness to this sauce.  Follow the instructions exactly.  I'm a very experimental cook but sometimes I like to make recipes as written the first time to see what the chef intended.  This was a very pleasant surprise and a staple in my kitchen.  One thing, I did not buy the five dollar a can San Marzano tomatoes.  I buy good quality name brand crushed tomatoes and they're more than fine for this sauce.

This was VERY good.  My husband just loved it and I served it with gnocci.  A couple of things I did differently was; I used white wine instead of vinegar and I didn't use tomato paste as it gives me serious heart-burn. So I just simmered slowly with the lid off and let the sauce thicken on its own.  SO good I'm going to make it again tonight and serve with linguini and chorizo.  Oh...by the way, we have Roma tomatoes galore in our freezer - so easy to run them under hot water and pop them right out of their skins (while they are frozen) and so I used them instead of the canned ones.

Duuuuuuuuude!!!!  That's all I can say...well not really but it sums it all up.  This is so simple but so good.   I went to the "big city" today and actually found some San Marzano tomatoes and I snagged them up and knew exactly what I was going to make with them.  It was just a matter of what pasta dish was going to grace the presence of this sauce.  I chose Chef John's Penne with Vodka Sauce found on this site.  Amazing!  Both of them.  I didn't change a thing.  I mushed the tomatoes up in my hands like I knew what I was doing and even though my taste test of the sauce at 30 minutes was to die for, I gladly cooked it another hour because well thats what we honorary Italian's do.  I felt authentic, it tasted authentic and I'm happy happy.

I used 2 anchovy fillets while sauteing (sweating) the onion and celery.  This is such a good sauce - although I would probably cut back on the amount of oil next time.  As for those who are against anchovies - don't be!  You'd never know they were there and they dissolve into nothing but flavor - no fish chunks or anything.  I loved this and will make it again.

Like the perfect handbag, I have been searching my whole adult life for the perfect tomato sauce - and this is it. I made it exactly as specified. I did taste it once all ingredients were combined and was not impressed but after it simmers for the hour and a half it is fantastic. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars.

This sauce has many uses.  My wife doesn't like the anchovy paste, so I used beef soup base ("Better the Bullion") instead, before adding in my beef meatballs.  She loved it.  You could also use their chicken soup base if using chicken in your recipe.

I've been making this recipe for years almost exactly as written and it is perfect.    My only change is to add more garlic because we both love lots of garlic.  However if I was making it for other people I would make it as written.    The first time I made it (as written) my husband said it was better than our favorite Italian restaurant.  

To the person who used different tomatoes and then gave it 4 stars,  don't change the recipe and then downgrade it.    He tells you in the video that the San Marzano tomatoes are the key.

I cut the recipe in half for my family of four and this sauce was great tossed with some sausage and pasta. I omitted the anchovy paste and used a can of petite diced tomatoes...I was able to skip the step where you were supposed to hand-squash the tomatoes too. I also only simmered it for about 30 mins. It still came out great! This is a great recipe if you don't have a jar of sauce on hand or want something that tastes more like it came from a nice restaurant.

So good!!  I made this and made Chef Johns Meatballs to go with it!!  Both fantastic.  The only thing I changed on this recipe is I blended with my hand blender because my kids don't like a chunky tomato sauce.  The flavors were so good and went so good with the meatballs!!  I'll definitely make this again!

This is one of my favorite recipes! Although, I live in a small town, and San Marzano tomatoes are not readily available. I just substituted regular canned tomatoes, and the sauce turned out completely fine. However, with that said, I managed to find a store that does sell San Marzano tomatoes, and it does make a big difference. My wife loves it every time I make this sauce. Thank you Chef John! Keep the awesome recipes coming!

Very disappointing. I did everything according the recipe, exactly. Expected the house to begin smelling heavenly. I was even excited to savor the anchovy paste within the recipe, as one reviewer assured us to just add it, you won't even know it's there.
The house immediately began to fill with an acrid smell, far beyond the expected aroma of spaghetti sauce aroma. An hour in I realized that I was not going to be able to eat this very different spaghetti sauce sauce. Got out the jar of Newman's Sockarooni so I could eat what I'd been craving.
Sorry Chef John. I took in the whole of this recipe, based on the solid reviews, but the sauce is nothing like I expected. The aroma alone set me off. (was it the anchovy paste?)

Made this today, exactly as written, and it was excellent!  I'm rather surprised that some people said it was too sweet or salty. I mean really ... a teaspoon of salt or two teaspoons of sugar can make 56 ounces of tomatoes too salty or too sweet. The star of this recipe is the San Marzano tomatoes.  By percentage, the other ingredients offer very little, but they do add to the flavor.  Don't scrimp on the San Marzano tomatoes because they cost about $5 a can and yo get something cheaper a couple of bucks cheaper.  They are worth it.  I'll definitely make again but may use an immersion blender to make it less chunky.  Thanks for sharing!  I really loved it.

I have made a lot of spaghetti sauces.  Always dissatisfied until I made Chef Johns sauce.  Frankly this is the best I have ever had.  The San Marzano tomatoes take this recipe to the top.  I use the San Marzano's in my fresh salsa recipe and they totally make it so different tasting from traditional canned tomatoes.  I don't like the price ($4.?? a can) but I don't flinch when I buy them anymore because you cannot find that flavor in any other canned tomato.  I pair this sauce with The Best Meatballs recipe (Allrecipes) which by the way get a 5 star rating from me as well.  I usually make a dbbl batch of both and vacuum pack together and freeze.   Freezes very well.

A nice chunky tomato sauce. I think the 1/4 cup of oil is too much oil though. I couldn't get it to boil down to dry. Next time I will try 1/8 cup olive oil.

I've made this a few times now: the first time with San Marzanos and the other two times I used Lemon Boy tomatoes from the garden.  Both have been delicious, with tons of flavor, which is what we often find lacking in store-bought sauce!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I don't typically have celery, so I sprinkled celery seed as the onions were cooking.  The aroma was wonderful, so I'm glad I didn't just skip the celery, as I often do.  Now that I have a baseline, I think I'll start messing around with variations.  I freeze this stuff and use it anywhere I would use tomato/pasta/pizza sauce...and sometimes I just eat it with a spoon.

Really nice consistency, but too sweet for our tastes. I think the tomato paste and sweet baby tomatoes were enough without sugar. When making this next time, I'll omit the sugar and just add to taste. I used one can of tomatoes and cut up a bowl of little ones from our harvest.

As an Italian, it’s hard for me to rip up my Aunt’s recipe and make this instead but it’s far better than my Aunt’s (I hope she’s not turning in her grave). It’s now my go-to recipe for sauce. Thanks Chef John—you never fail to deliver!??

OMG this was delicious!  Infinitely better than store bought sauce.  That being said, it's definitely time consuming.  I made it exactly as directions said but I doubled the recipe.  It made 12 Cups total, 6 C for the lasagna and 6 cups in the freezer for next time.  I don't think I'll be buying store bought tomato sauce again...  Yum!

I made this as written except used garden tomatoes.  I've made it twice now and it is the best tomato sauce I've ever made.  I think the anchovy paste adds great flavor - not fishy, just something extra.  Yum!  I love Chef John's recipes.

This was excellent. The best sauce I've ever made. I found the San Marzano tomatoes in an Italian market, they were more than double the price of the other Italian tomatoes, $4.59 Canadian, but I thought give it a try, there must be a reason.  Wow, I will never buy any other kind again.   I forgot to buy the tomatoe paste and the sauce was still  a rich flavor.  I used the sauce as a base for my creamy tomatoe sauce over gnocchi.  I added about 1 cup of sour cream, and had already added mushrooms and red pepper to the onion, celery mixture.  I served the sauce over the gnocchi with a piece of roasted chicken breast and a garden salad.  I will definitely keep making this sauce.   I found the video really helpful as I usually brown my onions and garlic, so I did it slowly like in the video.   I have Happy husband tonight. Thank you Chef John.

Don't fear the fish!  The anchovy paste does not deliver an overpowering taste, it brings a subtle and totally enjoyable dimension that you really could not name if you did not know it was there.  It is an incredible sauce!!

I made this sauce last night, for the Sunday dinner! One of the very best I've ever had! I like basil and a slightly sweeter sauce, so I added a teaspoon of dried basil and an additional tablespoon of sugar. It would have been great without the additions, just to be clear. I just tweaked it a smidge to my taste. Do not skip the anchovy paste!! It adds so much depth, it's incredible. And make sure to use the San Marzano tomatoes!! This sweeter tomato variety is a key part! And don't omit that anchovy paste... think I said that already... This sauce was on par with a NYC restaurant we went too a few years ago, Masseria Dei vini. I also used an immersion blender to smooth it out. You cannot go wrong with this recipe!! Thank you, Chef John, for your excellent contributions!! Every recipe of yours that I've made, the whole family has loved!

Making it for the 2nd time tonight.. sooooo good. Also making his meatball recipe. Gotta have the two together. Unbelievably good. PERFECT. This recipe  is why I prefer to eat at home, even though this one takes a little more time. Better than any Italian restaurant. And, yes, I've been to Italy.

This was delicious! I left out the celery but added fresh spinach during the simmering. I used half the amount of salt listed & still found it too salty. Also, did not have parsley. Made an Italian spice blend from this site. I will definitely make again but decrease the salt. I'm sure it will be 5 stars with less salt.

I will give this a 4 star. I at first didn't care for it much as I was wanting something more tangy. But I let it sit in the fridge and then made some meatballs and it was excellent with that combination. This may eventually grow to a five star when I make it again. Made it exactly per the recipe except I couldn't find those kind of canned tomatoes and had to improvise with other canned tomatoes. --- FOLLOW UP, This has grown on me and I made it a 5 STAR. Its my go to sauce.

This might be my favorite recipe on this site! DO NOT substitute the San Marzano tomatoes. They are critical in my opinion!! I didn't have white wine vinegar so used red wine vinegar and it was delicious!!

This is my “go to” tomato sauce for everything. It’s delicious as written....but if you added more garlic or tomato paste that works too. The brand of tomatoes makes a difference so use brands from Italy.

I wanted a new meatball and tomato sauce recipe.  DIVINE!!!!  I trust Chef John's recipes so much, my first stab at them was at a dinner party we held and everyone loved the meal.  I followed the directions exactly.  This recipe is a keeper.

Exceptional sauce, especially considering the amount of effort I put into it comparative to other marinara sauces I've made. This was a huge hit! Yes, of course I did deviate from the recipe ever so slightly so I'm rating it based on that. I used dried parsley versus fresh (a heaping TBSP) because pickin's were slim at the grocery store.  I forgot the blasted tomato paste (again), so in lieu of that, I used organic ketchup. Knowing my sensitive taste buds, I absolutely WOULD taste the wretched anchovies, so I skipped that ingredient and added an extra heavy dash or two of salt instead. All else was followed to the letter. That all said, this was the best received marinara sauce I've made yet and is now another CJ go-to. Thanks again!

Followed recipe except I used a apple/potato masher instead of my hands.  Flavor was good, cooked up easily and smells amazing.  Added a couple of anchovies since I couldn't find the paste in our stores.  Frozen for future dinners!

I didn't use the canned tomatoes for my version. I detest the tin can taste that's always left behind. But I made this exactly to the recipe using fresh tomatoes I'm blanched & removed the skins. This is a spectacular tomato sauce! The best I've ever had. This will be my go to from now on.

Absolutely delicious, and quite forgiving. I didn't have any celery on hand, so I left it out. I just had Walmart's basic pasta sauce, rather than the canned Italian stuff. Plus, I was starving, so I cooked it for 30 min, and it was still *delicious*

This is a great vegetarian sauce and the best meat sauce I've tried. An old Italian cook once said "you have to use your hands or it's no good". Maybe that's the secret but I think it's the anchovies and bit of sugar. I forgot the sugar once and it was a little flat and not as good. -- Coegee

Delicious! It probably should be a 4.5 because I made a few changes to my liking (omitted anchovy paste, which I don't like, and used beef broth paste and some chili powder instead). But in any case, with these minor changes, the result was a blast!!! My husband raved about it and begged I shall make this again. So, in his opinion, it is probably a 10!

Best I ever made! - and foolproof.  I accidently added the tomatoes before the remaining ingredients but it came out delicious anyway - and it's so shiny and beautiful, makes any pasta dish look like a magazine cover.  Made in conjuction with  Chef John's meatball recipe.

OUTSTANDING! This is my sauce from this day forward. Not acidic, rich in flavor. Don’t bother making it if you’re going to add or substitute ingredients. The San Marzano tomatoes are key, as is the anchovy paste. There is absolutely no fishy taste at all, it just enriches the flavors. After having said to stick to the exact recipe for starters, I did add up to a full cup of Italian or flat parsley because it’s so aromatic and I love it so much!

I made it exactly like the recipe. I think it needs more salt, and maybe a longer simmer. I simmered it 2 hours, and it was still a bit thin. Tasted great, but just lacked the texture I'm after. (I forgot to say, but i didn't add any water)
For too long now, I've suffered with sauce that slipped off the pasta while you are eating. You know, you get a forkful of spaghetti, twirl it and lift it, and it comes out white, and all the sauce is still in the plate. That's the mystery I'm trying to solve, and I was hoping this sauce would do it. I think it will if I can cook it the right amount of time.

Used onion powder instead of onion, celery salt instead of celery, garlic powder instead of garlic, tomato sauce and tomato puree instead of San Marzano tomatoes and omitted the anchovy paste. It still turned out well and we'll be making this again.

I have been making sauce wrong my entire life.  This sauce is just amazing and I followed it exactly except I used balsamic vinegar because that's what I had, and I think It was a good substitution, and I pureed it after it was done cooking due to some fussy eaters in the house who don't like chunky sauce. The anchovies are crucial and disappear but do add a very subtle but sophisticated depth to the flavor. I used this sauce with chef John's ricotta meatballs, and it was a divine pairing.

I have made several Chef John recipes and they are always delicious and this one included.  I did make a few simple changes.  I used fresh tomatoes, basil and oregano from my garden.  I think it would be excellent to can this Tomato Sauce but I probably would have to leave out the Anchovy paste.

Great base tomato sauce, just make sure you use San Marzano tomatoes. These people whining that its too acidity most have bad tomatoes or ingredients because its soo simple. Trust me, I've been a chef and this is a perfect base tomato sauce. Today I made it and added 6 Italian sausages and cooked them for 2 hrs... Incredible  !! If you read bad reviews of this sauce, Its because they dont know how to read. Thnx John

Thank you so much Chef John. This tomato sauce is the ultimate gourmet to say the least. All of your recipes.....and I mean "all" have given my wife and I a well-deserved respect for the chefs of the world. You are the best and this recipe for tomato sauce has replaced anything I have ever made or bought ever. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! We are so lucky to have you on All Recipes .com

Made it just the way the recipe was written and it was amazing!!  Saved it and will definitely will be making it again.  The only change I made was that I did not use canned tomatoes as I had the Marzano Tomatoes that we bottled in the fall.

I've made this roughly once a week for the last few months.  A few times I varied from the recipe, but in the end I think going strictly from the original recipe is your best bet.  Everyone loves it!

I made this sauce for my family and they loved it! My husband couldn't stop talking about it and I didn't use the anchovy because I didn't have any. But I will buy them for next time because their will be many next times. I also made turkey meat balls and through them in the pot, it was delicious. And,  I only used a wooden spoon.

I made this without any changes to the recipe and we thought it was just ok.  It may taste better if you use it as a base and add meat.  We like anchovies so it did not bother me when it was one of the ingredients.  I can say that I did detect a hint of anchovy flavor after simmering for 2 hours.

This recipe is fantastic. I have made it several times since the summertime. However, I have been using fresh tomatoes and adding a bit of cornstarch at the end in case it is a bit runny. Also, I never bought the anchovy paste and it tastes just fine without it.

This is not a good recipe and I followed the recipe to a “T”.  Another reviewer said it was bitter and acidic and I completely agree.  Another reviewer said it was too sweet (??!!). I can’t imagine what their tastebuds are like but this recipe was very bitter and I had to add a lot MORE sugar just to make it taste worthy and it really didn’t help.  It tastes very earthy (like Ragu) and dirty. Chef John has other great recipes, this isn’t one of them.

Other than adapting for someone who is allergic to onions and garlic, I followed it to a 'T'. Oh wait, I also used homegrown tomatoes. Loving it!!!
I don't think there is a single Chef John recipe that hasn't been scrumptious!

SIMPLE, PERFECT. TASTY way to use FRESH picked tomatoes. I go to our farmers market to get my tomatoes as we have one Italian farmer that grows his own San Marsano tomatoes here in Ontario. This recipe is made for those tomatoes. Thank you Chef John....

I can't leave anything alone, but this is a great beginning recipe. My wife won't let me buy canned tomatoes so I grabbed 10 roma tomatoes, pealed and roasted them under the broiler. I also roasted one red pepper and added it to the mix. For deglazing the onions and garlic I used a bit of red wine. It came out incredible.

Great sauce! Very tomatoey but not too tangy. I confess, I made a change. Publix was out of Italian parsley, so I used curly. 
I used it on spaghetti twice, and today made pizza toast with an English muffin. Put a tsp on each half of a toasted muffin, then pieces of a sharp cheddar slice,  back in toaster oven to melt the cheese. GREAT! I did wonder what I will do with a tube of anchovy paste,but I will double the recipe next time and use it for stuffed peppers, on meatloaf, and almost like a salsa with anything. 
Chef John, Thank you.

Perfect.  Followed exactly minus anchovy paste because I didn't have it.  I can see how it would have elevated the taste, but it's great without as well.  Thanks!

Adjust to your own seasonings. I use more garlic and herbs because that's our taste. I can't afford San Marzano tomatoes, but we grow stellar tomatoes in Sacramento, CA and I have a farmer that will sell me cases dirt cheap. I've learned to can them and they rock!

I tried to follow the recipe for this, but had to substitute plum tomatoes and anchovy fillets for San Marzano tomatoes and anchovy paste.  Welcome to small town NM.  The sauce tasted great.  I added Chef John's meatballs which were also very tasty.

I  was searching for a tomato sauce recipe that would meet my husband's low-sodium requirements; and decided I could make this work.  I found some decent cans of whole tomato with no added salt, and used a salt substitute where salt was called for.  The anchovy, I am so sad to say, had to go...and I seem to be one of the few who LOVE the salty critters. Alas, marriage vows impelled me to make the sacrifice. The upshot  is ...even with the salt and tomato limitations, this sauce is excellent both in taste and texture.  I am thrilled that I no longer have to buy jars of tasteless no-salt tomato sauce,

This is the recipe that made me a firm believer in anchovy paste!  YES, that's right, DO NOT even think of omitting this.  I was just like you, skeptical and grossed out by the though of adding a fish paste to my San Marzanos... I can tell you that every single time I've prepared this recipe, there is a special, certain something... a quality I can't put my finger on, but I know it's the anchovy paste.  It's not fishy at all.  It's just... something special.  

I also suspended my doubt of adding sugar and vinegar, and prepared this just the way Chef John says.  What can I say?  It just works.  Just the way it is.  Thank you, CJ, for another kitchen staple!!!

Chef John... I am recently retired, and have the kitchen time available to cook like I have always wanted. I made this sauce tonight along with your Italian meatballs.  This was simply out of this world. I did not change a thing, used a wooden spoon, and had the right tomatoes.  It was a wonderful delight to taste.  You only have 5 senses. And as a 60+ person, you just can't eat like you used to. Every bit I pi

This is my first time to make a homemade sauce & where has this been all my life? So easy to put together, just time to let it cook down. I usually don't care for tomato sauce, but rather use tomato paste for everything. Made this sauce to go with spinach stuffed shells I was going to have for dinner, but that will have to wait for another time, because I'm eating this right now as is over angel hair pasta. I will never use canned sauce again, but love me some fried tomato paste, so happy a bit of that was included in this recipe! I didn't have the exact ingredients on hand, so just winged it with what I had. The anchovy and sugar kinda freaked me out, but I just went with it even though I don't care for sweet. The only reason I even had anchovy paste was for a caesar recipe I made recently & had no idea what I was going to do with the stuff since I' ve never used before. That is some nasty smelling, but OMG it smelled divine once mixed with seasonings &  now I have something to do with that tube of nasty as this sauce is to die for! I halved the recipe as I only had one can of San Marzano tomatoes I found at WalMart to try. Mine was not labeled BPO, but did state product of Italy. No idea if that matters, but regardless, these are still the best canned tomatoes I've ever had & now see what all the stink is about. HIghly recommend & I will buy from now on. Well worth the price. For those who can't find locally, Amazon carries a pretty good brand selection as well. Centro is w

I, of course, have to tweak every recipe that I try. I use the basic recipe replacing ingredients I don't like but it worked beautifully.   All the ingredients were from my garden. I canned 6 pints.  I also used fresh oregano from the garden which adds much more flavor than just Italian seasoning. My Italian seasonings we're replaced with a fresh herb satchel. Instead of tomato paste I let it cook all day… About six hours on low heat.… Yum.

This is the sauce I have been making for years with the exception of one ingredient...anchovy paste! I did not have any so I used a few capers mashed up and it worked. That little extra something I have been missing. Also, used red wine vinegar (I did not have white) so guess it was two ingredients I did not use before.  I did it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low after sautéing the onions and celery and the tomato paste etc. I then  added more water about half way through. I made lasagna with it. I made 1.5 times the recipe of sauce and had some left over on the side for those who like their lasagna with extra sauce. I added my meat to the sauce in the crock pot (See Chef John's lasagna recipe for what to do) after browning the ingredients first and then cooked on low another 4 hours with the meat in it. Only San Marzano tomatoes will do for any good tomato sauce imho. Perfection!! Thanks Chef John!

This was a delicious sauce, with a bit of a subtle spicy flair (from the crushed red pepper).  Definitely set aside some time to make this, as it is not quick, and you need to give the sauce about 2 hours to simmer.  I paired the sauce with "Chef John's Italian Meatballs" and the bf loved it!  Chef John has not disappointed yet!!

Heavenly !  I think I could just eat it by the spoonful without pasta!  I have added some meat to it to satisfy the meat-lovers - not that it needed it.   Is the anchovy paste needed ?  No, it's perfect either way.

I have watched and made many of the recipes on video by Chef John. First off he is funny in relating the nuances of the recipe and cooking techniques....or for example "do not rinse the pasta"! In any event this red sauce recipe is the best I have ever tried and enjoyed. My wife always knows there has been something delicious cooking as she can smell the yummy sauce soon as the garage door opens. I have tried to change the ingredients with mixed results. Many recipes you can do this to suit your tastes but we found the best method is to follow the chef exactly as he lays it out. The San Marzano tomatoes and anchovy paste are key ingredients to deliver a great sauce for any pasta you choose to use. I have made this sauce many times and only time it disappointed us is when I added too much tomato paste. Did I say make it exactly as the chef said??? Enjoy!

I have made this sauce several times now. This is fantastic!!! Since we are only 2 people, I freeze the sauce in portions and always have it at the ready.  And don't skip the Marzano tomatoes. When they are on sale, I buy as many as I can.

This recipe  is the absolute celestial basic tomato sauce. The anchovy  paste is a surprise but really adds another level to this delicious tomato sauce.  I have to double this recipe.  My family  just likes to use this as a dipping sauce with crusty chunks of bread.  Who needs lasagna noodles ?  Once again thank you Chef John for helping to gather all the busy family members around the dining room table...

I made it with fresh tomatoes from the garden as I had a lot of ripe ones and it worked as well.  Will use San Marsano's the next time.

I love it, it's perfect as written. I like the fresh taste, not heavy and not too tomatoe-y.  It is a little bit acidic but I like that.

This is an easy, albeit time consuming, tomato sauce recipe! I used tomatoes from my garden that I de-seeded and removed the skins from and omitted anchovy and tomato paste because I didn't have them on hand. I let it simmer for the whole 90 minutes and had to add about 8oz of water. I also substituted the balsamic vinegar for the white vinegar as another user suggested. Delicious! Chef John never lets me down!

I needed a tomato sauce recipe since a friend gave me fresh tomatoes from their garden. This is the first time I make a tomato sauce from scratch and it will be the only one I ever use. 
I didn't use the anchovy since I was just using things I had available at home. I will continue to make it until I get it absolutely perfect because it's such an amazing recipe.

Love this sauce. Great as a base and to keep in freezer. Always double the recipe.
While I always adjust a little depending on what I have in the house. I always use a beef bullion cube instead of the Anchovy paste, as I never have that.
Thanks chef John.

The very best!  Excellent!!  1/4 cup EVOO was a little too much.  Didn't have any anchovy paste.  Included some meat in the sauce. Did add a splash of balsalmic vinegar, a pinch of baking soda and a little more salt and garlic powder after an hour or so of simmering.

This is a great basic sauce as it is or jazzed up. I made it exactly as the recipe said, except I didn't have white wine vinegar, so I subbed white balsamic vinegar. This sauce is easy & makes your home smell great!

I made this tonight for the first time.  Delicious!  I made it exactly as written - right down to the anchovy paste.  I even crushed the San Marzano tomatoes with my hands.  Glad I did too because several of the tomatoes still had a little bit of skin left on them and I was able to remove all of it.  For myself, I fixed a little pasta and a few meatballs to go with the sauce.  My husband made a huge meatball sub with provolone cheese and lots of sauce.  We were both happy!  I often make the Baked Ziti IV from this site and it calls for jar marinara sauce.  I am going to use this sauce the next time I make it.  Up my game a little.

Totally agree. Wooden spoons are especially useful when stirring on a non-stick surface. Metal spoons can scratch nonstick coatings, while smooth wooden spoons will not harm non-stick surfaces. Even when stirring in a regular pot, metal spoons can leave scratches, and they make a scraping noise that can become bothersome over time. Again, wooden spoons to the rescue. They won’t scratch your copper, aluminum or stainless steel pots and are nice and quiet to use.

I have been using this tomato sauce for the past two years. This is my "go to" tomato sauce. I'm a home canner and I usually double the recipe and can it in several pint jars.  I use it in every recipe that calls for tomato sauce from spaghetti sauce to meatloaf. I no longer use store bought tomato sauce! Thanks Chef John!

I wasn't sure about anchovy paste (never tried it before) but decided I would follow the recipe to the T and I regretted it. Did not like the taste it gave the sauce. Overall the sauce was ok. I will try again without the anchovy paste.

I double all of the ingredients and almost always freeze the leftover sauce for another dish.  
With the onion and celery I add a zucchini and mushrooms sliced.  I will add a very mild banana pepper diced if I want a little spice.  I omit the anchovie and red pepper flakes.  
The quality of canned tomatoes here is nice but hard to find.  Ultimately fresh roma's make the best fresh sauce as far as I'm concerned.  However in the winter I succumb to using whatever tomatoes I can buy in the largest can. 
I do prefer to add the rosemary and thyme that is fresh and too my taste as the sauce is simmering.
The fresh basil is added once the sauce is near completion.  For fresh basil I would use around 4-5 leaves. 
I like to serve the sauce the completed sauce the next day.  It is a little watery the first day.  If  have fresh ingredients then my sauce may require thickening with a can of tomato paste.

My family loved this simple sauce. The San Marzano tomatoes do make a difference. The only changes I made were that I used Apple Cidar vinegar instead of white wine vinegar and I used 3/4 of a teaspoon of capers instead of the anchovy paste. I made a paste with the capers and added it to the sauce. I was skeptical of the anchovies and I researched an alternative to them and I had capers around the house so I used them. Tasted great . Made chicken Parmesan with the sauce.

Absolutely loved this sauce.  I started with whole anchovy filets that I mashed in to the sauce and added just a few more fresh herbs but this recipe is a definite keeper.  I served it as a side sauce for Mediterranean marinated grilled chicken thighs.  Perfect and exactly what I was looking for to compliment the flavors.

Wonderful! Followed recipe except for all the salt (anchovy paste has a ton of salt and I usually cook without or with little salt). It came out great! After the 90 minutes I left it simmering on low while I browned some Sweet Italian Chicken sausage chunks and some homemade beef meatballs. Added the meat to the sauce at the 2hr mark and simmered another hour (my grandmother's pasta sauce recipe calls for the sauce to simmer for 3 hours). It was awesome! Spaghetti & Meatballs, Meatball Subs, et c! The recipe makes a good amount; enough to freeze left overs if you're not feeding a bunch of people right away! First time buying San Marzano tomatoes, but I was able to find them at a local discount grocery store; I do think they made a difference! Gotta Love Chef John!!!

Excellent sauce recipe just as written.  I made no substitutions.  Did notice several people commented about the cost of San Marzano tomatoes.  I live in southern Ontario in Canada & get them at our local No Frills, Unico Brand for $1.49 (not a sale price).  Hope that helps the people who quoted $5.00 a can.  Chef John I visit this site almost daily & love all your recipes.

Tomato sauce is simple - as described here. Personally I like fresh basil and some nice freshly ground fennel. But this sauce works.

This is a great basic red sauce.  I made as written, sans celery and subbing dried parsley for fresh.  I found it a touch acidic, so I followed the suggestion of a previous reviewer and added about 1/2 tsp of brown sugar at the end of simmering.  I added Meatball Nirvana to simmer towards the end and served over pasta with fresh shaved parm and crusty bread.  Next tim, I'll double the recipe and use the slow cooker after the onion and garlic are sweated.  THANKS for the recipe, Chef John!

This is just perfect as written.  I would love to try it next time using fresh garden tomatoes of the same quantity as the 2 cans.  It was amazing.

Made this tomato sauce...was some work but was worth the end result.  Only regret was not making a bigger batch and freezing portions for easy use next time.

Terrific base recipe, Chef.  It is so easy to personalize that I keep a goodly amount in the freezer.  You always share wonderful recipes and keep me busy in the kitchen.
