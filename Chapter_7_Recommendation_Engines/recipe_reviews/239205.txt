Delicious! I took the suggestion of others and used a whole Tablespoon of curry powder. These gave them a strong curry flavor which I like. I also made these paleo-friendly by omitting the breadcrumbs and adding 1/4 tsp baking soda and 1 Tbs coconut flour. They came out moist and awesome!

Easy! served with Hungarian cucumber salad from this site and with hummus and Naan bread.  My 4 year old even ate it and he doesn't like meat.  Might add a little more curry next time but it was great.

Not sure why these haven't gotten more reviews... they are fantastic and so simple.  This was a hit in our house! Thanks for the great recipe.

My husband gives these meatballs 5 stars because he's not a fan of ground turkey, but he loved these!!  I added red curry paste and cayenne pepper, but it still wasn't spicy enough for us!  My son didn't appreciate the curry taste at all.  I will definitely make these again for hubby and myself and give the kiddo mac and cheese.

Very good - nice different flavors.  I took some suggestions and used 1 T (heaping) curry.  I made a little bit of accent flavor sauce from 3 T mango chutney that I used with 3 T of chicken broth to deglaze the pan in which I browned the meatballs.

My husband loved them!  He is sensitive to gluten so I substituted oatmeal for the bread crumbs.  They are quick and simple!

I made it as a main dish for a Sunday dinner with my friends!
this recipe (for me) yielded 20 meatballs. 
I used a small onion, substituted breadcrumb with oatmeal, and used 2 tsp curry powder instead of 1.5 tsp. I also omitted ginger and cinnamon. 
People lies, so even my friends all appeared to be pleased regarding what I made, I can't say I trust them 100%. 
For me, the texture of the meatballs were kinda like the meatball with tofu I made couple years ago.. It was pretty smooth I would say. The flavor was great! I personally don't like onion that much and I did a bad job on chopping them so that was a minus for me. 
I think I'd make them again! With less onion!

I decreased the onion to about 1/2 c. ,chopped.
Not wanting to clean an extra pan, I skipped the browning step, increased the oven to 375 and baked for 20 minutes.
The flavors are well-balanced - we enjoyed them with some yogurt and couscous.

Pretty good but needed sweetness.  I served it with apple jelly but if I made it again I’d try cranberry jelly or a chutney.  It’s a good use for that ground turkey you bought on sale and has been languishing in your freezer though.

I also used at least a full tablespoon of curry. Put the onion in my Cuisinart to really mince it because I have no colon and onions are hard to digest...but there was no way I was leaving them out. Served them atop a bed of jasmine rice. We cut up the meatballs and allowed them to contact as much of the rice as possible to flavor it and that was perfect. These were super quick and easy to make and both my 18mo old and 6yo wouldn't stop eating them. Actually,my wife and I couldn't stop either. Tonight I'm making them again and serving naan with them along with the rice. These are an easy,delicious weeknight meal. Love this recipe.

I was invited to a meatball cook-off dinner party.  I figured there would be family recipe Italian meatballs and teriyaki versions.  I wanted something different.  Curry turkey is pretty different.  These meatballs are delicious!!  I made them a day early in case they weren't good and I needed to go a different way. Instead, I'm trying not to eat too many so I have enough to take.  I took the advice of people who said to put in a tablespoon of curry.  The curry flavor is great and not as all overpowering.  This would make a great meal addition or an appetizer.  I never make meatballs but I'll make these again.

We left the word “Curried” out when we fed the kids and now make them every couple of weeks with pita bread, cucumber and hummus. They love them!

The dish is good.  The next attempt I will try to do something with the texture.  Ground turkey is kinda pasty, in general, when trying to make any kind of meatball or meatloaf.  However, it was a good first run.  Served it with rice and a yellow curry sauce...

We made this per directions, though only used half of a rather large onion (about a cup and a half finely chopped). It was a pretty quick recipe and everyone loved it, even the kids.

Delicious. I was concerned that these wouldn't have enough flavor, but I was wrong. The curry isn't super strong, but the flavor is great on these. They are very flavorful and moist. I followed the recipe exactly and served with hummus, taziki, and naan bread. I will make these again.

These were good but not a hit with the kids :(  Good for adults though! Also, they really need to be hot, not good when room temp.

The combination of spices in this recipe is just wonderful!  I was in a hurry and didn't want to make all those meatballs, so I formed it into burgers.  I didn't have any pita bread and thought it would be too dry over rice without some sauce, so I put a can of lite coconut milk and a can of diced tomatoes in the food processor and put it into the same pan.  I added some of the same seasoning as was in the recipe and reduced it and pored it over the burgers on rice.  Wow, it was just delicious, and my husband thought so too!

This was amazing! I followed the suggestion of adding more curry... I probably put 2 table spoons into the mix. Easy to make and yummy to eat! :-)

Amazing!! The only change I made was to chop up the onions in a food processor so they were finely chopped. I then sautéed the onions in a little olive oil and sprinkled with curry as they were cooking.  I did find the the mixture was a little moist, probably because of the cooked onions, so I did need to add about another 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. This would make a great appetizer or as a main meal.

With a little tweaking to our taste these are absolutely fantastic, and this is coming from someone who does not like ground turkey at all. Well until now. I increased the amount of curry to suit our  taste and we yet to be able to have a meal out of  them because everyone snacks on them.

Followed the recipe almost exactly and they were perfect! So delicious. Used coconut oil instead of olive.. Yum! Probably going to make these often.

Easy, tasty and a big hit with family who are used to Italian style meatballs.  A nice change.

Exactly like the instructions and wow! My husband really liked these too! I did use Thai red curry paste and mixed with olive oil for an extra kick,  dipping oil.

Great recipe! Delicious, fast, and simple. Added half the amt of salt, swapped the yellow onion for a shallot, and used a curry powder I already had in the cabinet. Also dusted a light coating of cornstarch and cooked it on the stove top for about 20 mins. Served atop a bed of wilted spinach-see pic.

These are delicious, flavourful and soooo easy!! I made this exactly as listed and I didn't need (or want) to change a thing the next few times I made them. My husband can't handle foods that are too spicy and he could still handle these.

We didn't like them at all... Way too salty... Maybe if there was a sauce to mask the salt it would be better..Such a bummer

Made for some friends and they loved it, even their kids loved it! They kept getting more! My kids love them too. Easy to make and it comes out very moist. Tasted great as leftovers. I just put some in the freezer so will see how well they do baked after frozen.  I think it could use some zing, but haven't decided how I'm going to do that just yet...

These are so good, I'm eating these as I make them, can't wait til dinner is ready! I made them small enough to cook through in the pan so I got 32 meatballs instead of 20. I also fried them in coconut oil instead of olive oil, cuz curry and coconut go hand in hand!

Yummy!! A different take on meatballs. I served with a dill sauce I had leftover from the talapia recipe on this site. Went together perfectly.
