This recipe is delicious. It is a little time consuming but well worth it. I went out and purchased all the ingredients the day that I made it so that everything would be very fresh. After putting the vegetables in the pan to cook and soften I had to add some tomato juice as there was not enough liquid in the can of tomatoes. I was so anxious to eat this beautiful meal that I totally forgot to top it with the peanuts currants and fresh parsley. Nevertheless it was awesome! There was quite a bit left overs so I will enjoy it again.

We really enjoyed this tasty recipe for dinner! It was chock-full of flavor and the textures were nice too. I did not use the canola oil choosing to start with the bacon. I used the rendered bacon fat to brown the chicken and to saute the vegetables. There was no mention of the cooked bacon in the instructions so I added it with the tomatoes. The only sub I did was cashews instead of peanuts personal choice. I also made Paleo Cauliflower Rice also from this site. Interesting and different way to prepare a whole chicken but the prep time takes nearly an hour to cut up everything so be aware of that. Thanks for getting me out of my comfort zone with this tasty recipe!

I made it exactly the same but used drum sticks - it s what I had on hand... but I found it bland. Not sure what was missing or if it s just my palate. I have made other Curry s before with no problem.

This is really delicious! Unexpectedly so!! Followed recipe exactly except I used chicken thighs instead of whole chicken and omitted the peanuts at the end. Family loved it!! thanks so much for posting! We are always looking for more ways to use curry powder and this is one of the more interesting ones!
