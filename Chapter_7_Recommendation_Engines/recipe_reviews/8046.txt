I only used the icing recipe, I have a recipe for my grandma's jam cake.  But the icing was really good.

This smelled great while it was baking and it is good but you should use parchment in the pans. It really stuck badly. The base of each layer is rather tough and chewy. Maybe it will soften up after it sits with the frosting though. It is rather sweet but I bet my kids will like it. I have never had a jam cake before this one so I wasn't sure what to expect. We'll probably eat it up but I am not sure I would make it again.

this recipes makes a fantastic cake, but I have also made it with orange and rhubarb jam and added ginger instead of the other spices and it was wonderful too.  I had no idea there was such a thing as jam cake until I was looking for something use jams still not used from last years allotment harvest.
