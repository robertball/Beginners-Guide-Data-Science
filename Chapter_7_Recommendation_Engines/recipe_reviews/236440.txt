Sooo yum. I've made 3 batches of this for 3 different dinners over the past week and I'm still craving it.  
First couple of times made as is, but 3rd time had run out of farro so used whole grain rice.  
Added a bit more lemon, as well as a handful of chopped mint to the final batch ( feta + mint = the bomb).
Amazingly good  - thanks for the recipe!

I made this just for myself, so i decided to half the recipe. I replaced the couscous with Barley, just because that's what i had on hand. My grocery store didn't have yellow squash so i used zucchini instead. I used a little more olive oil than half, and with the lemon added 2 teaspoons of Greek seasoning,and olives, everything else i kept the same, and it was Wonderful! It was hard not to eat it right away..but i put it in the fridge until supper. I served this as a side, but could very easily be a meal. I am looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. You can pretty much add anything you have in your fridge and this would taste great. This will make an excellent different side during summer BBQ's , maybe next time i will  incorporate some fresh herb such as basil from my garden. :)

I skipped the cucumber and used two yellow squash instead. I sauteed the onion, pepper and yellow squash together. I also added about 8 ounces of fresh spinach to the onion, pepper and squash and sauteed it for several additional minutes.

I mixed all the ingredients together, added the feta cheese and served this warm (we were hungry). It came out great and I will definitely make this again.

It needs a little more salt and double the dressing. I roasted a squash, zucchini, and onion at 425 for 20 minutes instead of the raw veggies.  Omitted the cucumber.  It is delicious.

Excellent mixture of textures.  I did add more olive oil and lemon juice for flavor.

This is awesome! It does make a lot - perfect for main dish but if you're planning to serve as a side, it will stretch further.

Great textures.  Filling.  Not a ton of flavor so it can be paired with many entrees as a side dish.  Makes more like 12 servings - consider cutting in half.
