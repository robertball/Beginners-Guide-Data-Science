This was really not the best recipe I've ever made. The flavour of the soup was really nice, and definately an easy and quick meal to make, but I found teh quinoa totally fell apart and turned to mush, rathar than held it's shape, which also lead it to taking up the majority of the volume of the soup. If I was to make this again, I would cook the quinoa separately and add it to bowl fulls of the soup, rathar than a one-pot deal. That way you would keep the nice "pop" than perfectly cooked quinoa has.

This was very good and very easy!
I added: mushrooms, lots of chopped fresh basil, a couple bay leaves, a dash of thyme and a can of white beans

I left out: celery (didn't have it) and parsley (since I focused on basil instead)

It turned out beautifully though I still thought it could use a bit more spice.  Not sure what though.  A jalapeno pepper might do it some good.  I have a cold and this really hit the spot as a veggie soup remedy.  If you don't want the quinoa to go mushy make sure you cook it just long enough for all the veggies to be tender.  You'll see the quinoa is ready when it "pops" open and floats to the surface instead of being grounded on the bottom of the pot.

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make this recipe vegetarian.  I cooked the soup for about an hour longer than the recipe calls for.  The quinoa cooked down a lot and it made a nice, thick and creamy broth.  I recommend serving this with thick slices of multi-grain bread.

Yummy! I love Quinoa and thought it was a great idea to make it into soup. I decided to use some extra herbs to give it some pep.  A dash of cumin  A pinch of basil  A spot of red pepper flakes  A thing of canned tomatoes (juice an all) and some shell noodles.   I cooked the Quinoa in the veggie broth tomato/water after cooking the veggies a little. A little after that I added the pasta. I found that the Quinoa kept together this way and the pasta was not over done.

I thought this soup was great...the cabbage made the soup slightly sweet. I used organic quinoa and I believe it improved the flavor too. I believe, though, this might please long-time vegetarians more. I will take leftover for lunch tomorrow. THis is a meal in itself.

This was alright. I used about 5 or 6 carrots instead of just the one, and added a few cups of tomato juice with the chopped tomatoes. I used both red and white quinoa, which made this prettier, but the taste was just so so. I think that adding meat would make this better. Not bad by any means, but not amazing.

I doctored this heavily.  I used canned tomatoes because they are not in season here right now and added seasoning such as a packet of Sazon and a bay leaf.  Still, good base for veggie soup.  Served it with bug hunks of whole grain baguette.  Easily made vegan.  Great way to introduce a new, unfamiliar food (quinoa) to a skeptic (my fiance).  I will make this again.

Not horrible, but not very flavorful. Even when I added fresh herbs (basil, tyme, and oregano) the flavor was on the bland side.

I added canned fire-roasted tomatoes instead of fresh and it added a lot of flavor.  I didn't have any cabage, but I thought it was still great without it.

I am eating this as I review...yummy!  I had some leftover cooked quinoa to use up and this recipe was perfect for that.  I followed some other reviewers.  I added some chicken, mushrooms, Italian Seasoning, red pepper flakes and cumin as suggested by other users and subbed yellow pepper for green and a can of italian diced tomatoes (juice and all) because that was what I had on hand.  Also added some frozen mixed veggies.  This is so, so good and I am thinking that even my picky teenager and quinoa skeptic husband will eat this up!  Would give 5 stars but am not rating the original recipe.

This was pretty good. I added some zucchini I had to use up, some crushed red pepper flakes for extra spice, and some fresh basil, and I doubled the garlic. A simple vegetable soup, great for lunch.

3.5 STARS. It was a good base soup. I stayed a lot closer to the recipe than I usually do for soups. I made the quinoa in a separate pot with the 1 part quinoa, 2 parts liquid ratio, but other than that I didn't use any water. Something funky was going on with my fresh garlic, so I used jarred minced garlic. I added chopped zucchini, yellow squash, white mushrooms, and some chicken thigh meat. It was still a bit bland so I added a dash of apple cider vinegar, some cayenne and cracked red pepper, and a couple of bay leaves. Oh, and I used canned tomatoes (with juices) because our tomatoes aren't so great right now. We'll see what my boyfriend thinks of it, and how it freezes.

This was good, but rather light tasting for my taste. I prefer spicier foods so I made this again and personally found it much improved with the addition of chili powder, cumin, oregano, and fresh cilantro in place of the parsley. These are common ingredients used in quinoa soup in South America. Thanks for the starter recipe.

Although mine doesn't look anything like the picture it was still good.  It was a little bland at first so I tried adding some basil (based one someone else's review) then some salt and black pepper.  Now it's really good.

I made the mistake of putting the soup in the slow cooker thinking it would make a flavorful broth after a few hours and then I would add the quinoa...DON'T DO THIS!  The soup ended up tasting terrible and I had to throw it out.  I will try again making it according to the directions.

It was just okay for me. It lacked flavor, so next time I would add some spices. I think chicken would add a lot of flavor to this soup.

I have a daughter home sick today and she wanted chicken noodle soup.  She's gluten intolerant, so I used this recipe as a starting point for a gluten free chicken soup.  It turned out great.  I'm giving it four stars only because I made so many changes that its hard to rate the original soup.  But, the base was a perfect starting point.

I started by boiling two chicken breasts in the chicken broth and shredding them into pieces.

Then I followed the recipe with the following changes:

I didn't have celery, peppers, tomatoes, cabbage or parsley on hand - so I skipped them.

But, I added the shredded chicken and one can of large butter beans (rinsed) for more texture.  I used Mrs. Dash Chicken Grill Seasonings to kick it up as it simmered. (two-three shakes).  

It turned out to be a great gluten free soup for a picky teenager with a cold!  Thanks for the base to start with... I'll be using it again!

The end result was a

I just didn't love this however I did add cumin as someone suggested and I think that flavor didn't go well.  This might have been better made as is.

Loved this! I substitiuted the water with chicken broth and added a zucchinni.  I used extra cabbage as well. A nice change on the "plain old" vegetable soup!

I thought this was really good but I added cilantro and red pepper flakes to give it a lil more zest.  I also cooked it in the crock pot on high for 2 hours instead of on the stove so the veggies would really give off their flavors.  A great recipe for healthy living!

We loved this soup! I added mushrooms and basil instead of parsley. It was great!

We substituted cauliflower for the cabbage and it was very good.  Served with Jiffy cornbread.

I discovered quinoa while on my Peruvian honeymoon. This soup reminded me of our trip. :)

I followed the recipe and incorporated some suggestions in other reviews.  The soup was completely mediocre.  The flavor fell flat.  I had high hopes, but I will not make this again.

Very simple, but lacking flavor. I added an extra can of chicken broth, oregano, and a couple bay leaves (and would have done more if I'd had mushrooms, basil or more.. I like my veges a little hard, so the 10 minute cooking time was perfect. I can imagine some preferring much longer on the heat if you want a softer/stewier soup.

My daughter-in-law dairy and gluten intolerant, so I am always looking for recipes that she can  eat as well as everyone.  This recipe was a hit and quick and easy for a soup.

This was good. It didn't actually take that long to make, and I didn't have peppers, but added potatoes instead. I used purple cabbage, and ended up with a really pretty, festive looking soup!

I wanted to try quinoa but my local grocery store didn't have any so I used rice instead.  I added red pepper flakes and extra garlic and used a 15 oz can of diced tomates.  I also added whatever veggies I had around.  It turned out very good and we even have leftovers for the next day.

Tasteless...I'm sorry but it's like eating soaked veggies, no condiments but salt and pepper.
