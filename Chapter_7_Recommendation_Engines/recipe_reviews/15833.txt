Very different from what I'm used to making. Its very filling and I personnally don't think it needs the added noodles. I only used half a head of cabbage and used a full cup of barley. Threw in in 2 bay leaves while the soup was simmering and used oregeno instead of parsley. I used low sodium chicken broth and still found the soup to be a little too salty. Next time I will use less broth and add a little more water.

This soup was excellent.  I was looking for a recipe to use leftover ham and found this.  The only modification I made was to add some potatoes.  My family loved it!

I used ham soup base and left out the ham and carrots.  I also just cut up the cabbage rather than shred it.  My soup was a real success with my family.  Very good.  Deliciousioso!!!!

I was pleasantly surprised at how flavorful and hearty this soup was.  It had a pleasant sweetness to it, and no bitterness from the cabbage or celery at all.  I thought I might have to add spices, but no, the flavors of the ingredients really carry themselves.  It tasted even better after a day of rest in the fridge.  I'll be using this again for sure!

This is a very good recipe.  I guess you could say we cut it in half and adapted to our taste.

I used 1 lb of chopped smoked sausage that I sauteed with the onions, celery and carrots.  Added 3 cans of chicken broth along with 1 can of cream of chicken soup along with approx 2 cups of water.  We also added bay leaves and fresh basil along with fresh ground pepper and a bit of salt.  This mixture simmered on low heat for about 30 - 45 minutes, stirring every couple of minutes. Added 1/2 large head of shredded cabbage and cooked until tender.

This is one of the best soups I've ever had, and may even top the Old Fashioned Potato Soup I got off of this place!!  For some reason, the local grocery store didn't have barley, so instead of going on a hunt for it, I decided to do without.  This is AMAZING!!!  I would recommend it to anyone! As a fan of pepper, I added a bit of fresh cracked black pepper, and it seemed to work wonderfully!! Excellent!

This was a tasty and healthy soup. Very easy too, just throw everything together and let it simmer away. I added two potatoes, peeled, cut in half, and thinly sliced. They broke up during the long cooking time and helped thicken the soup nicely. This made a HUGE pot of soup!

This cabbage soup was absolutely DELICIOUS!!!  My husband and grandson both loved it.  My grandson doesn't like cabbage, but he still ate it and even ate most of the cabbage in it.  I left out the barley to make it lower carb, and I added an extra clove of garlic and a little Mrs. Dash for more flavor.  I will make it again for sure!

I first made this soup about 3 years ago & really liked it. Had forgotten about it until I had a bumper crop of cabbage this year. Decided to make it again & try canning some. The canning process really enhanced the flavor & it is even better!

I used this recipe to create one of my family's favorite soups EVER!  I made the changes based on my family's needs and it turned out great.  We have a diabetic in the family, so I left out the barley (to decrease carbs) and added 1/2 of a chopped rutabega (for some potatoe-like texture).  I would HIGHLY recommend this!  I used 6-7 cups of chicken broth, not cans, just to cut back on opening so many cans!  And, most importantly, I added A LOT of cracked black pepper, as one reviewer noted.  The pepper completely makes this soup.  Its wonderful!

This soup really surprised me. I cut the recipe in half since it's just me and my husband. I used lower sodium broth as others suggested. I used a salt cured Virginia Ham and that added all the salt that was necessary - I didn't add extra salt while cooking and the soup didn't need any after it was done. That was amazing to me because I thought this soup would lack flavor and seasoning, but it didn't. As long as you get a high quality, high flavor ham, you will get great taste. 
I also added two medium sized red potatoes for some extra "umph." I only simmered the soup for an hour as I like my veggies to still be a little firm. 
This is a great soup to put in the books. SO many yummy and good-for-you veggies, too.

This was my first attempt at Cabbage anything.  I, too, omitted the barley and instead of broth I used ham hocks with water to cover and added chicken boullion to taste after removing hocks, 2 diced potatoes (towards the end of cooking), salt & fresh ground pepper. The family loved it but asked that I make larger pieces of cabbage next time.

This soup is excellent. The reason for only 4 stars is the addition of salt and pepper. It was bland without seasonings except for the parsley. The blend of veggies with the amount of broth was nearly perfect.  It could be thicker, but that may be because one person's head of cabbage may be different from someone else's.  For future reference I measured everything after chopping and came up with 12 cups of coarsely chopped cabbage. I don't believe it needs the barley. It seems to be able to stand alone without it.  Very hearty.

YUM!  I'm in heaven.  What a perfect rainy day comfort soup.  We made this exactlly as written, except we didn't add barley.  I think what makes or breaks this could be the type of ham you use.  We use country smoked ham with the fat which really brings the flavor out.  Processed lean ham will not give this soup the flavor it deserves.

I had a left over ham bone.  I simmered broth with ham bone for over an hour before adding anything else.  I sauted the veggies with garlic in a little olive oil. Added one cup of barley.  Also added cabbage towards the end.  Yummy!

I added a few more carrots and celery just because I like them!!!  This soup was so good, I am so accustomed to adding tomatoes I kept looking at it and wondering - should I or shouldn't I.  Didn't, but I did add 1 serrano chili for the added heat/flavor.  Thanks for such a great and easy recipe!

yum. i also used a full cup of barley. i threw everything in my slow cooker for 1 hour on high then low for 4 hours. i ended up adding some water halfway through since i used more barley. i loved the creamy consistency the added barley gave the soup. this made a ton so i froze some to give away to family

Simple easy to make and can freeze the left-overs. I used broth cubes & potatoes instead also used turkey ham because it cuts the salt down...I added more cabbage both chunked and shredded also added garlic...family loved this! We had cornbread with this I will make again soon!

This soup is soooo good & filling. I added potato along with cabbage & carrots. I forgot to do the noodles but really didn't need them. I also left out the ham (I'm on a low cholesterol).  Just a hint. If you don't want to use a can of chicken broth (high in salt & fat), go to a bulk food store. You can get the powder chicken & beef. Mix it with water. There is no salt nor MSG. I will make this soup often. Full meal!

I used vegetable broth instead of chicken.  Substituted 1/2 cup lentils instead of barley (will use barley next time).  Cut up the cabbage instead of shredding.  Cut down on ham for calorie purposes.   Very tasty.

Ok: we loved this! I did sauté cabbage with onions in 2-3 TBLS butter. When slightly soft but not fully limp, added broth and remaining ingredients and simmered med-low.  Really liked this recipe and a nice "different" recipe for winter soups. Hearty, easy and my family gave me the thumbs up sign. A keeper for sure!

good base recipe but needs some seasoning, I added pepper, bay leaf and home made salt free Cajun seasoning, I used Better Than Boullion Vegetable stock base for the chicken stock, it was what I had, I also added some corn which I had in the fridge, I needed 12 cups of water to cover my soup.

Light, simple, tasty, and EASY.  This would be good with a really hardy rye or multigrain bread.  If you plan to have as leftovers, pull some out before the cabbage is fully cooked so the cabbage doesn't get mushy when reheated later.

Great soup.  1 1/2 hours is way too long for cooking it though.  It was pretty mushy, although tasty.  I used half chicken broth & half water.  I will cook for 1 hr next time, adding the cabbage in the last 20-30 minutes for some crunchiness.

This was SO good! Everyone loved it! I love that it was a one pot dish and so easy to make and very healthy as well! I doubled the barley to one cup, used 6 cups of chicken broth and 4 cups of water and added a little salt.  It was delicious!

It was okay I guess. It seemed very rich making us unable to eat much of it. I would add the cabbage at the last 20 minutes because it wilted down to almost nothing. I used rice instead of barley and it turned out okay. Hey, but it is an inexpensive meal.

I made this exactly as directed with great results.  This is a very filling soup and makes more than 6 servings, even with a very generous bowl of soup.  I'm sure the leftovers will be even better.

Light and tasty.  My husband really enjoyed it too!  Added ~1.5c barley.  Added about 3 cups of ham.  Forgot to add the garlic...:(  I never forget garlic!!!

Very flexible recipe!  I used ground beef instead of ham, left out the barley and added some macaroni noodles at the end. Also I used pre-made veggie broth.  I did not have to cook it quite as long.  Maybe 45 minutes.  It would be great in the crockpot too after browning the meat.  As other reviewers mentioned the flavors of the garlic and onions really carry the recipe.  I was able to add some other left over veggies from the fridge (green beans) and it was great!  My hubby took it today for lunch which is always a good sign.

Excellent tasting soup.  Everyone who tried it wanted seconds.  However, next time will not use quick barley.  I will use the medium barley.

I thought this soup was wonderful.  It is so easy.  I did it exactly as below but because I was short on time, I let it bowl a bit longer and then turned to simmer.  I came out wonderfully.  Even my ultra picky mother-in-law said she like it which is high praise indeed.

Great recipe. Made it with Kalbasa Sausage and rice instead of ham an  barley. Also added a little pepper.  Hubby is a very picky eater and he loved it. Glad it was a family hit. Def making it again.

Wish there was an option for 0 stars.  This is not an inexpensive soup (barley, ham) to make and there is NO flavor to it.  If you decide to make it, consider adding some Frank's Red Hot for flavor.

This was just OK.  I will not make it again.  I agree with a couple of other reviewers that it was bland- nothing special.  I tasted it at the point that it should have been ready to eat and I didn't care for it.  I added a can of diced tomatoes, 1/2 cup of white wine, a bit of cayenne, bay leaves and some garlic powder. Even with the "goosing up" it wasn't great. My family agreed.

Surprisingly Wonderful!  I followed another reviewer's suggestion and sauteed the garlic, onion, and celery first.  The broth has a really good flavor.  I can't wait to make it again.

This soup came out amazing, BUT I did edit the beginning steps a bit. First I used 2 tbsp of butter and sauteed the onion, carrots and celery until browned. Then I followed the rest of the recipe.And WALA!! Out came a great soup. I also used fresh parsley.

Sauteed the veggies and ham in some butter before adding the broth. Increased the barley to one cup and cooked only until the barley was done. Delicious and makes lots of servings. Very economical.

I made this soup tonight and it was a hit, even with picky non-cabbage eaters.  I used homemade chicken stock in place of the broth, and put hot sauce on the table for those who wanted it.   If I made it again, I might put in a whole cup of barley, but that's the only change I would make.

This recipe was easy and delicious!  I was looking for something different for leftover ham and came across this recipe.  I made it for some girlfriends and we all loved it.  I was thinking about adding more barley than was called for and boy am I glad I didn't.  It was just right.  Thank you for a great soup.

This was fantastic and so easy! I was looking to use up some veggies left in the fridge.  I had 4 red potatoes and 1 zucchini that I tossed in.  I also through in a can of mushrooms w/ juice because we love mushrooms. Didn't use the parsley but used oregano instead and two bay leaves.  The potatoes cooked down and thickened the broth. YUMMY!

This is very, very good. It does make a lot; enough for several people or more. The aroma is wonderful. I substituted a couple of shredded chicken tenderloins in place of the ham. This is a keeper.

Excellent.  Neighbors tried it and knocked it off. I really liked the barley in it and added some potatoes as someone had suggested.  Worked fine in a slow cooker.

My husband LOVES ham and cabbage (even though I generally despise them), so when he came home with a 6 lb ham and giant ball of cabbage, I figured this soup would be our best bet. We BOTH loved it. Thanks for the great recipe!

Only change - used 5 cups of ham and just 5 cans of broth because it was all I could fit in that pot with everything else. I think I'll stick with those changes from now on too.

Simply outstanding. This left my old cabbage soup recipe, which my husband wouldn't eat, in the dust. (He loves this one. He even called it his new favourite soup!) Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe.

This soup was delicious. I added a small amount of hot sauce to the broth to give it a bit more kick. Be prepared though, it really does clean out your system! Great for a cold winter day.

Delicious! I used one box of campbell's reduced salt and one regular chicken broth.  I also added 3 cloves of minced garlic, a pinch of thyme and 3 bay leaves (remove prior to serving) for a hint of extra flavor.  For those of you who felt it was salty.... try adding the ham in the last 15 mins of cooking, not only will less of the salt from the ham leach into the soup, the ham won't toughen up or become a weird pale color. Thanks for the post.

Soup was great and very filling.  Made almost a gallon of soup!  I used a large head of cabbage chopped, not shredded.  I didn't have any celery or barley but used the extra cabbage and a few potatoes chopped instead.  I would definitely make it again.

Great Recipe!  Added 1t Salt, 1/2t Pepper, used fresh parsley and small shavings of ham vs cubed.  My wife was scrunching her nose as it cooked, but loved every bite!  She loved that is was "healthy" too.

WONDERFUL! I thought this soup was superb. When I told my husband that we were having cabbage soup for dinner, he rolled his eyes. However, after inhaling the first bowl, he says, "Hey, this is REALLY good!" I added some salt and potatoes to mine. It was so good! Thanks for the recipe, I will definately make this again and again!

I thought this was great!! At first I worried it would be to soupy but there is so much stuff in it,it's very hearty and delicious.
Not a kid friendly soup though unless your'e lucky and have children who like vegetables.
Thanks so much for sharing this is a keeper in my house.

I loosely followed this recipe for an 8-quart stock pot and thought it was great.  I just added more veggies an substituted ham plus ham stock. Serve with cornbread.

This is the best soup I've ever made.  I did make one change - I used chicken sausage crumbled up instead of ham, because I'm not a big fan of ham.  Otherwise - no changes and it is incredible.

The flavor and healthfulness were great, but to me it doesn't work to put all the ingredients into the pot at once.  The barley needs 1 1/2 hours, but this is way too long to cook the cabbage and carrots.  The cabbage turned to mush.  As other reviewers have said, this is a great way to use leftover ham.

Very boring and bland.  I subbed some of the broth for water, to cut down on sodium (I have an 11 month old).  Baby was the only one who seemed to like it.  Won't be making this again.

this soup is very simple and affordable to make. i left out the barley and used potatoes instead added allspice and cumin as i do for most soups..it did not need salt as the ham adds salty taste  will try with a different meat next time or without meat but overall yum!

This soup was excellent. I used a honey ham steak which gave the soup a slightly sweet flavor which I thought made the soup. Also substituted orzo for the barley as my family are not barley eaters.

I sauteed the onion in butter until it started to carmelize, added the garlic for a few stirs, then added to soup.  Also added a half can of diced tomatoes (without the juice). And, a shot of sherry.  Was very good.  I am sure the original recipe is just as good- but wanted to add my own spin.

Thank you so much for this recipe! I had never touched a cabbage before, but a couple heads ended up in my CSA box, so I tried this recipe. My boyfriend and I liked it so much, we made another batch 2 days later. It's so easy! We substituted celeriac for celery, but otherwise, we followed the recipe exactly.

Made it exactly as is.  So very good.  Even  hubby loved it and he's not a fan of cabbage.  The barley totally makes this recipe great, so don't skip it.  After we'd all eaten, there wasn't much broth left, so we added more for leftovers the next day.  I agree with a previous reviewer that serving it over pasta is unnecessary.

Yummy soup! Nice use for leftovers.  I added a bit more garlic and a couple dashes of tabasco.  I made a half recipe but kept the ham measured at 2C's.  Yum!!!

This is soooooooooooo yummy and it makes alot too, considering how much cabbage there is.  I subbed some potatoes for the celery and had to add 2 more cans of chicken broth and 3 additional cans of water.  I also substituted bacon for ham.  It was a little salty so I will cut down on the amount of broth I used or the bacon.  Delicious!

I may or may not make this again.  Both my teenage brother and sister loved it!!  But I thought it was too salty and just a soup - nothing spectacular.  Plus my hubby doesn't like pork...

I loved it!  Thought it would be bland, but it wasn't.  I used beef broth and moose burger instead of chicken broth and ham (that's all I had).  Very hearty and tasty.
