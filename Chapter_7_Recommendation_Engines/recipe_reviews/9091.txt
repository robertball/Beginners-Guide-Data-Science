This soup is different and fantastic!  Everyone practically licked their bowls clean!  However peeling the chestnuts is a pain!  Tips:  1)Strain the soup before pureeing, gets rid of the chestnut skins missed; 2)Taste before adding sugar, we found that the soup's naturally sweet enough and didn't need sugar.  My uncle is convinced this soup cured his cold!

After years of not knowing what to do with all the chestnuts from my mother-in-laws' yard, this soup has provided an answer!  It was easy to make (my husband roasted & shelled the chestnuts) and was absolutely delicious.  I served it to my family & in-laws who were amazed at how good it was.  I'm now thinking about collecting, roasting & freezing more chestnuts so we can have more soup all winter long.  You've got to try it!

I use this recipe every Thanksgiving, and it's become a family favorite.  The soup is so smooth and creamy, and it's so worth searching for the chestnuts!

Haven't made it, but had chestnut soup at 5 star restaurant and loved it.  It was creamy with just a touch of sweetness.  They put a 3oz custard in the middle of the soup bowl and poured the soup on top then put sauted mushrooms on top of the custard.  I don't care for mushrooms but thought I would share.  You could make custard using those little pyrex serving finger bowls and then turn upside down in the pan.  Flavor the custard anyway you like.  The restaurant's custard didn't have much taste but the texture coupled with the soup was great.

When it comes to chestnut soup recipes, this is probably 'the best' - so I gave it five stars.  If you love chestnuts and want to make a soup with them, this is the way to go.  However, both my husband and I thought the soup was really sweet and rich, and something we'd prefer to eat only once a year (holiday time).  Just FYI, the soup is best in small portions - 1/2 cup appetizer before a large turkey/potatoes/stuffing meal.  Not as a soup-for-dinner.  (Duh.  We tried the latter and got really sick of it, really quickly.)

Very good and super easy.  One thing I did though is to saute the onion and chestnuts in butter before adding the broth.

Very delicate...gentle use of chestnuts and good introduction for people who don't usually eat them.  Easy recipe to put together, excellent on a cold day!

A surprisingly rich soup, it served well as an appetizer to our Christmas Day feast. The chestnut flavor was strong, and the onion and spices accented it well.

I did a vegetarian version--veggie broth instead of chicken + a healthy chunk of butter. I've made this twice, once with fresh chestnuts, once with canned. There isn't a substantial quality difference, and given the hassle of peeling, I'll be using canned in the future.   Both times I made this I served it with a simple salad with lemon-based dressing. Perfecto! Across the board satisfaction from young and old alike.

I agree, peeling the chestnuts is a HUGE pain, but I only make this once a year (on Christmas), and the roasting/peeling/puree-ing can be done well in advance (then, you only need to add the cream on the day that it's served). For presentation, I recommend reserving a few roasted unpeeled chestnuts (one for each bowl). Just ladle the soup, place the roasted/unpeeled chestnuts in the center of the soup bowl, and sprinkle the parsley around the chestnut. My guests loved the novelty of peeling/eating roasted chestnuts on Christmas day (and it was 6 less chestnuts that I had to peel myself!).

On flavor, this recipe is a clear 5-stars.  However, there was room for improvement with the consistency.  A chestnut soup should be a little thicker.  I added a simple roux (2 T of melted butter and 2 T of flour), and it helped a lot.  Also, in lieu of the dollop of unsweetened whipped cream, try one small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  Sounds silly, but it was legendary.

This was totally not worth the work involved.  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and took one taste of it and poured it down the garbage disposal.  I am sorry, just being honest.

I made this for our Thanksgiving celebration and it got rave reviews from everyone.  For leftovers, I sliced up leftover rolls, buttered them generously, sprinkled them with just a teeny bit of ground nutmeg and baked them on a cookie sheet at 425 degrees just until they were toasted.  They were WONDERFUL for dunking in the soup or broken up and floating on top.  Thanks for the great recipe -- this is now a tradition for our Thanksgiving meals. :)

This makes a really good soup.  I served it at my Super Bowl party and got excellent reviews.  It's easy to make once you peel the chestnuts (my thumb is still sore).

This recipe was very good and a hit at Christmas Eve.  I recommend more chestnuts than the receipe calls for ( an addition 1/2 to one pound of extra chestnuts). This will help it be a thicker soup. I also added about 3 -4 tablespoons of flour at the end to help the soup be more of a bisque consistency. 
 I also added a dollop of sour cream in each bowl, a perfect way to cut some of the sweetness of the chestnut.

Wow! I never tried chestnuts before. Just roasted and plain they were delicious but I had to stop myself from eating them so I had enough for the soup. Chestnuts are expensive but this soup is worth the cost, especially if you want to impress your guests. thanks for posting!

It smelled pretty funky while it was cooking, but in the end I was amazed at the depth and uniqueness of flavor. I made this because I had a jar of roasted chestnuts, which made it easy. Also, I substituted homemade almond milk with vanilla bean for the heavy cream and sauteed the onions before adding the broth.

Turned out really good and I will make it again but next time I will get a sucker to cut and shell the chestnuts.  What a pain in the a__,  I kept saying "This had better be worth it" and it was.  Then I was hoping nobody would like it so I wouldn't have to do it again but no such luck.  It was a hit, everybody loved it and there were no leftovers.
