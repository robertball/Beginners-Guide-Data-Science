These were interesting, and they were okay with my morning coffee.  I made them for my gluten-free family members, but they were just okay for them.  They could taste something a little different which was probably due to the gelatin in them.    I liked that they were plump and sweet with the raisins (I used golden raisins).  I think they are worth a "go" for those with gluten allergies.  Thanks for the recipe!
