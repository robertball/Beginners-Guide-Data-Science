This was really good.  I took the others suggestion and used less sugar.  I only used about a cup and I used 7 peaches.  The only other thing I did was add a little cinnamon.  It was delicious and so easy!  I will definately make this again!

This was excellent! My husband wanted to eat the entire thing at one sitting.  I changed a few things to make it more healthy.  I used Hawaian bread instead of white bread, only used 1 cup of sugar, used 2 eggs and instead of butter I used Parkay Buttery Spray for no extra fat or calories.  GREAT RECIPE

This recipe turned out great. My whole family loved it. It is very easy to make. I used 7 peaches to make a fuller filling. I did also add a tsp. of almond extract and 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. My husband likes those two ingredients added to desserts.

I love this recipe.  I have made it a few times and it has always turned out great.  I however have made some changes to it.  I use 1/4 cup of flour instead of the 2 tblsps.  Also I use only 3/4 cup of sugar and the sweetness is just right.  In addition, I throw some chopped walnuts on the topmost layer and this really adds punch.  Lastly, I serve it hot with a scoop of vanilla icecream.  All my guests have enjoyed it.

Made this recipe on a "snow day" afternoon with the kids- was super easy- they did virtually everything on their own with very yummy results!

We used the original 5 serving size recipe- but didn't have fresh peaches so we substituted a 29oz can of lite sliced peaches (definitely would add another 15 oz. can or even another 29oz next time!!!) We also cut the sugar down to 1 1/4 cups thanks to someone else's suggestion and it was still a bit too sweet even for the kids. *Also added about tsp. of cinnamon sprinkled over the peaches.

So good, easy, and inexpensive to make! I just moved into a house with a peach tree, and wanted a recipe that would use only ingredients that I already had in my kitchen. This is it! I am not supposed to eat much sugar, so I substituted 3/4 c of Splenda Blend for the white sugar, whole wheat flour for all-purpose, and wheat bread for white. The recipe may sound a bit odd (bread on peaches?) but, the bread soaks up the butter mixture, brown nicely (even using the Splenda Blend) and develops a mouth-watering buttery sweetness. I made mine with a dash of nutmeg added to the butter mixture. Still absolutely yummy. I think that I will try using a few more peaches next time (perhaps mine were too small) and less of the Splenda Blend (maybe 1/2 c). You must try it!

awesome recipe - ingredients all on hand, simple to make, pop it in the oven, and done! (i did think it was too sweet, despite switching over to  brown sugar, and reducing it to 1c.  i'll just use less next time :))  my family and friends loved the recipe!  What's really nice about the recipe is that you can use it for almost ANY fruit...i've tried pears, apples, peaches...even used it to save some exotic pear-guave-like fruit i bought that didn't taste that great on its own.

Not exactly a cobbler, but more of a peach bread pudding. Don't get me wrong tho, I make this 2-4 times a month when peaches are in season!

I'm not sure what went wrong with this recipe as I followed it exactly, but I threw the whole thing in the garbage before anyone could see it.  I would not make this again!    C. Ferris

All i can say is WOW!!! This is an amazing recipe.  I had everything on hand and it was delicious.  I took the advice of others and only used 1 cup of sugar, however, next time I'll cut it back even more.  I was afraid I did something wrong, because the butter, sugar, flour, egg mixture was very thick, but I guess its supposed to be that thick (like cake batter).  Thanks for this recipe - i intend on sharing it with everyone i know.  It was a huge hit and was devoured in no time.  :)

This recipe was delicious and unbelievably quick and easy.  I took the suggestion of some of the other reviewers and decreased the sugar to 1 cup, and I also added 1/2 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp cinnamon. And, oh, I kept the bread crust because I like like.  This is definitely a keeper for me.  Whole family loved it!!!

Interesting recipe..I wasnt to sure how to rate this because I wouldnt call it a cobbler yet it was good, LOL..My husband definately loved it. I liked it and will make again. The great thing about this recipe are the ingredients usually what we have on hand, so if you just want to put something sweet together this is it. You gotta try to rate I'd say. BTW, i used 1 cup of white sugar and it was the right amount of sweetness for us! Enjoy

This is a desert that my grandmother used to make me.  SOOOOO good.  A few changes though.  I use canned peaches and double the amount.  Ditto on the flour.  Reduce the sugar to 1 cup, and leave the crusts on the bread.  They get nice and crunchy if you leave them on.  Also serve with some heavy cream or half and half over the top.

This peach dessert is great.  I doubled the bread, eggs,flour,and butter and kept the sugar as written.  I also added a little cinnamon and the results were wonderful.

Good basic recipie. I made few changes. I used fresh ripe unpeeled peaches. I used whole wheat flour, added brown sugar, vanilla & almond extract and chopped up almonds...yummmmm. I cooked mine in a glass pyrex dish. What we didn't finish I put straight into the freezer in dishes and then pull it out and microwave when we need a sweet treat!

WAY TOO SWEET!!! I was hoping this was going to be a wonderful hybrid between bread pudding and fruit cobbler and it ended up being a gross hybrid of both. I tossed it in the garbage. If you do try it- cut the sugar WAY back- to maybe 1/2 cup.

This was great!  I and my family loved it.  I actually used 3 peaches, 3 apples, and half a banana to add some variety to the dish.  I also reduced the sugar to 1 cup (which was plenty) and used whole-wheat bread instead of white.  It didn't taste particularly like a cobbler, but it was great nevertheless.

this is great and so easy!! i used an 8X8 dish-buttered and put bread slices on the bottom than put peaches, than another row of bread slices than topped it off with peaches on top. for mixture, i added about 3/4 cup of white sugar and 1/4 flour (as another reviewer suggested) and added i tsp. of vanilla extract and sprinkled some cinnamon..i didnt have any vanilla icecream but i topped it off with whipped cream...AWESOME! definitely feels like it needs a crunch so i will try pecans or walnuts next time...

Like the other posts I found this recipe to sweet. I cut down the sugar to 3/4 cups. I also added about 1tsp of cinnamon,1/4 tsp of nutmeg and a pinch of cloves. It is yummy. A new family favorite.

The things I have had for breakfast! I halved this for the two of us. Used 1/2 whole wheat. Baked in 9x6 glass baking dish, and could have cut the baking time down to 20-25 minutes. 

Used challah bread (this site) and maybe 1/4 cup turbinado sugar. This is great and will pass it on!

This recipe was delicious, although next time I make it I will use more peaches.  I wasn't sure what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised at how it turned out.  I will make this again!

This is TOO SWEET. Whoever makes this i reccomend to cut back the sugar to make a cup or less. It was good but i couldnt taste it over the sugar.

This was very yummy! I used 6 peaches and 1 cup of sugar and I added a little cinnamon. It was difficult to slice my bread into 5 fingers (very skinny) so I did mostly 4 fingers per slice. I served this warm with vanilla ice cream and my husband whoffed it down! I had some cold the next day and thought it was even better the day after!!

This would have gotten 5 stars, because I thought it tasted great, BUT, I will use a smaller dish next time to get the peaches deeper and have enough of the wet mixture to pour over the bread. It was just a little sweet, but I'm from The South and we seem to like things sweeter. :)

Noticed this recipe didn't call for any spices.  Made this with about 7 sliced fresh peaches, left skin on.  Let peaches juice up with a 1/2 cup sugar, pumpkin spice, cinammon & nutmeg to taste.  Made the rest of recipe the same, but added same spices to the egg & sugar mixture before pouring over the bread slices.  IT WAS FABULOUS!!!  BEST PEACH COBBLER I EVER HAD!

I doubled the recipe but used 1 cup less sugar. It still turned out sweet though, maybe because I used canned peaches in syrup. I added ground cinnamon too, and it turned out great!

A side note: I set it to 40 minutes, but it could have stayed in the oven for a little while longer (Probably 5 - 10 minutes extra).

Great recipe!  So easy and good.  I also added a smidge of vanilla and some cinnamon, but otherwise I made it as written.  Our family gobbled it up.

Super-easy and sweet.  I love it.  I have a sweet tooth, and so does my husband. I was doubtful when I placed it in the oven, but it really did wonders.  The only thing I'd change is to add more bread and peaches/other fruits.  YUMMY with vanilla ice cream.

This was pretty good, but definitely more of a bread pudding than a cobbler-- which is what I wanted.  I used bread that was a little stale and it did fine with this dish although next time I'll consider cutting the bread into smaller pieces and mixing it in with the peaches.  Also, I reduced the recipe to 2 servings and baked each of them in small bowls for 30 minutes, it came out great!

We loved this recipe.  I used a little less sugar and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  The bread gives a crusty topping which we like.

The taste was pretty good, but we couldn't get over the bread crust.  We used 2/3 cup sugar and was still pretty sweet.  Definitely a simple recipe, but just didn't get that cobbler crust we wanted.

My husband gets hungry for Peach Cobbler every year at this time when peaches are abundant.  Yesterday I tried this recipe.  I was worried he wouldn't care for it since it wasn't traditionally the way I make it but he LOVED it!

Perfect cobbler.  This is my new favorite cobbler recipe.  Can't wait to try it using apricots. Can't even tell the crunch comes from bread.

Great recipe! It's simple and can be customized to use what is available. I have used flavored brioche, day old croissants, and even Hawaiian dinner rolls for the crust. I do add a bit of cinnamon and vanilla to the batter. I especially like using a peach. blueberry, and raspberry combination for the filling. I made this for firefighters and medics at work and it was met with raves and praises! That's a group that knows good food!

This is definitely a keeper! As suggested by some reviews,  I used Hawaiian bread, a little less sugar, and added cinnamon.  The perfect way to use our beautiful farmers market peaches and dessert with visiting family!  (Oh yeah, don't forget the vanilla bean ice cream to top it off!)

Great recipe! Simple and delicious I'm pregnant and due any day and had a strange craving for peach cobbler! It hit the spot! Added cinnamon and vanilla extract, cut the sugar to 3/4 and used canned peaches because that's all I had! Next time I will use regular peaches but it was still delicious! Great easy recipe! I will be making it for thanks giving!

Did not peel fresh peaches just cored & sliced only. Added 3/4 cup of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, 1/4 cup of cinnamon & chopped walnuts just like one of the other reviews. So Yummy & easy to make.

Husband loved this and it was so easy to do!  The best part is I had everything already in the house.  We have a white peach tree so after jam and canning it is perfect for what is left.  I did take the sugar to 1 cup and added a little vanilla extract and cinnamon.

This is an awesome blend of bread pudding and cobbler.  I add an extra egg, 1/2 cup of milk 1 1/2 tsp of vanilla and cut back the sugar to 1 cup.  Plus I sprinkle a touch of cinnamon on the peaches. I also soak the bread in the egg mixture first so it get good and absorbed.  It is a yummy and super fast recipe!!!

This is a winner! Great reviewer ideas - thank you, all. Used whole grain oatmeal bread (very hearty) and did not remove crusts. Layered in an 8x8 pan (bread layer first). Sugar: 1/2 scant cup Splenda brown sugar & 1/4 scant cup Splenda - if you're a sweetnik, you'll want more - i prefer more peach flavor. Added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla and 4 tbsp flour to egg and butter mixture. Sprinkled top with chopped pecans and cinnamon. Baked in 35-40 mins - just a coincidence that we had peach frozen yogurt on hand - WOW. Will make with frozen peaches when the season is over.

YUMMY - - easy to make!!!  I did have to add just a little bit of milk to the butter/egg mixture - - it was way to thick to pour  Thicker than pudding to be honest - - but a little milk - thinned it up just right and I used a laddle to spoon over the bread which was ontop of the Peaches !!   GREAT RECIPE -- A KEEPER FOR SURE !!!

The bread topping came out nice and crunchy, but my peaches needed a spoonful or two of the sugar and a little flour.  Plan on eating this within a day or two as it doesn't keep.

Cobbler hardly gets any easier than this! And it was quite delicious, but I did change a few things. I used honey wheat bread, cut back the sugar to 3/4 cup (I had ripe, sweet and delicious peaches), I cut the butter down to 1/4 cup and I added some cinnamon and a teaspoon of Mexican Vanilla. It was melt in your mouth fantastic!! We spooned some homemade vanilla bean ice cream on top and it was like a little bowl of heaven!

This was great! I did add a little cinnamon and vanilla, personal preference and topped with 3/4 c ch pecans.
Just a note on sugar amounts and cooking time, since these seemed to be an issue for folks.   
Taste your peaches!   I used 6 uber ripe, sweet peaches and a slightly heaped 3/4c of sugar.  Nicely sweet.  Look, you can always add sweetened whipped cream or ice cream, after cooking, but you can't take sweetness out, after cooking!   Err on the side of too little sugar when baking the first time.
The cook time will depend not just on how your oven cooks, but the size pan.  If you use a shallow pan, 9 X13  as stated, check at 35 minutes.  IF the center wobbles when you give it a mild shake, put it back in for 5 mins, and then check, again. Just cook it in extra 5 min increments until the center is fairly firm when shaken.  A deeper pan may require extra time.
All in all very good!

Yummy! And so easy!  I also cut back the sugar to 1 cup, but left everything else the same.  Will definitely make again.
