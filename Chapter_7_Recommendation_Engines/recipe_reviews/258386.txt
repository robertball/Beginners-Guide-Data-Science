Wow.....  My husband and I made this tonight and we both agree it's one of our favorite recipes now.  The only change we made was using chicken broth instead of chicken stock.  I don't know if that's a big difference but my husband bought the wrong thing at the grocery store.  Thanks for sharing thing!

This recipe was really easy and tasty. I’ve tweaked it a bit given the ingredients I already had at home. I used 3 chicken breasts instead of 2, a whole carton of chicken stock (about 4 cups) and red curry paste instead of the chili garlic sauce.

I thought it was great!  I didn't have spinach so substituted broccoli.  Great as a leftover as well.

This was a decent recipe but I felt like the coconut flavor over powers the chicken too much. I'd suggest substituting the coconut cream for coconut milk or just leave it out altogether. I'd also suggest increasing the amount of chicken stock as it seemed very light on the broth and heavy on the solid ingredients for a soup.

this is sooooo gooood and so easy! but I did put the macaroni after pressure release and cooked on saute since I didn't want mushy noodles.  i would also recommend taking out the noodles and separating them from the soup since these would soak up the liquid.

I was disappointed with this- felt it was a bit too bland, even when I added several tablespoons of Siracha. I would also recommend a little less pasta as it soaks up all the broth. Unless I can figure out how to add more flavor, I probably won’t make this again.

I liked it but if I make it again I’d add another chicken breast and cut the pasta in half. There was WAY too much pasta and not enough liquid, so not very souplike.

Made this soup as I was feeling like I was getting a cold and wanted to try something new. It has  a kick and usually I’m not a spicy food fan, but this is a subtle kick at the end of a bite. Cleared my sinuses!! The coconut cream is a mild undertone that really enhances the flavor. Since I love garlic, spinach, carrots and onions, I figured I’d like it. Maybe a bit less sirracha next time but I won’t exclude it. Very tasty.

This turned out really good! We made it exactly as directed and the flavor was better than I expected and our noodles weren’t mushy. That said, we were very confused by the directions to check the color and temp of the chicken with a meat thermometer... while it’s pressure cooking?? How on earth? Also, there were no instructions to dice or shred the chicken so we ended up with a soup with two big chicken breasts just sitting there. Regardless, it’s a good recipe.

Delicious and easy. My entire family loves it so much that it has become a weekly dinner for us. I usually add an extra 1/2 chicken breast.

The person who called it mushy. Cook your pasta separately and add it when you serve.

Favor was good, mushy noodles not so much! They needed to be added after the chicken cooked. I did add red pepper flakes and it was good.  Might be good with rice or

We made this pretty much as described in the recipe. Liked it a lot. Next time we might add a few red pepper flakes to enhance the flavors.
