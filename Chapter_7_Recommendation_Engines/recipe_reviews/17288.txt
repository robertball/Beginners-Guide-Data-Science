To make the rotis soft try cooking them turning the following way. The first flip right after you place them on the pan aprox 5-6 secs. Now cook this side for about 1 minute or until soft brown spots on the bottom. Now last flip for the roti to rise up a bit and its ready.
I love them every time i have them.

We really enjoyed these.  Found it a bit difficult to roll thinly, and I was surprised by how crispy they were.  The roti at our favourite restaurant is soft and pliable.  Does anyone have a suggestion on how I might make these so they come out soft?

Fantastic!  Great bread recipe- I cooked it on a crepe skillet on high heat, and noticed that if you flip it one extra time, the bread puffs up and fills with hot air- it's great!  It turned out like pita bread.  Definitely a keeper!

I cooked it in a regular pan and flipped it when it started to puff up and it turned out wonderful and soft.  Would love to find the right spices to add to it to flavor it up a little.  Will also try the half white half wheat suggestion.

My whole family loves this bread!  Good made with all white or half white/half wheat flour.  I cook it on a very hot non-stick griddle.  Make sure you roll out the dough as thin as possible!  Great with spicy Indian dishes.

This is my # 1 favorite recipe from this site! I have made this many, many times for my 3 year old. He says, "Make some rollie, please, Momma." Thanks for posting this great, easy, and wonderful tasting recipe! (Reminds me of a tortilla, we eat it with butter).

I added boiling hot water. This made the roti softer & more moist. They are now a family favourite!

not like the rotli i get from my gujarati best friend. this recipe came out way too dry and hard, and i made it various times with different mixes of flours and various amounts of liquid.  won't repeat for indian foods, but it's not bad for a tortilla recipe...

Good...folded these to use as a sort of soft taco with chili for filling.  You can't roll these up, they'd break (too stiff).  Nice and chewy and it added to the meal, more filling than a tortilla or taco shell would have been.  I cooked them right in the pan like you'd cook anything else, rather than flipping the pan over.

hmm. i haven't tried it yet but looking at it and analyzing the recipe, it's not like the roti that i  eat in restaurants. theirs are usually more flakey, i saw this video on the travel channel that they folded and rolled the dough in a whole lot of ghee. i assumed it was the reason why it was so flakey, tender and moist in restaurants. kind of like the concept of making croissants-- you fold it over and over with butter.. anyway, i'll try this recipe in addition to that folding in ghee or oil step. thanks. :D

Wonderful! Fry in ghee and serve with curry. Make your own ghee by simmering organic unsalted butter until it quiets (no water boiling out) and milk solids fry golden brown. Strain through a cheesecloth and store in a plastic container in the fridge for up to a year.

These were a hit! The suggestions to cook for 5-6 seconds, flip, cook again for approx. 1 min, flip, then cook until the desired browness & to press down on the edges with a spatula after the 1st flip were wonderful.  When I pressed the edges, the roti definitely had more air pockets.  I used a cast iron skillet & very high heat.  At first I tried med-high heat & the result was not at all what I wanted, but when I used a very, very hot skillet they came out perfect!

To Yummum, 

If you want to make the roti soft and pliable.... instead of adding oil to the flour, add two tablespoons of butter. While cooking the roti, brush a little oil on both sides.  After removing the roti, immediately place it in a covered dish lined with paper towels.  Your roti should come out soft.

Fantastic. My husband was very impressed. I did the extra flip and they fluffed up nicely. I also cheated because i didn't have time to let them rise... (I hadn't read the instruction properly and hadn't left myself enough time.) i figured it was too late to give up, so i just went ahead and cooked them anyways, and they were just fine! =) 
thanks for the recipe!

I come from Singapore and these look exactly like the Roti Prata we get frozen in bulk at the supermarket! These are however a lot less flavorful than the kind I eat back home because of (what I think is) indian ghee. I read that the wheat absorbs water to different extents depending on the weather. My dough was very dry so I added more water. If the dough has difficulty pulling together its too dry. I think the dough should feel slightly wet, but its not tacky and I certainly did not need to add additional flour either when kneading or rolling out. They peel easily off the counter. They are pretty resistent to being rolled out so do be patient. The 3 flip tip was great and they puffed up! Used melted butter instead of veg oil and worked out great. For soft rotis, fry till the outside is flaky but not crisp while the roti is still bendable. Used them as sandwich wraps for a party and everyone loved them. Thanks for the recipe! :D

I made these to provide a vegan alternative to the naan at a get together. Used half white, half whole wheat flour. Cooked it in a regular pan with three flips, the third flip is important if you want the bread to puff up nicely. Use a spatula and gently press around the edges of the roti to help it puff and fuse all the little air bubbles into one big pocket.

I love this stuff! It tastes better when you use melted butter in lieu of the oil. Also use copious amounts of butter to fry it. You only live once right?? Yum. I blogged about this recipe!

I agree with some of the other comments -- a 3rd flip is a big help, part whole wheat is good, and it does make a delicious, chewy roti to serve with Indian (or other) foods.  I appreciated this recipe because it was much faster than the other roti recipes I was looking at, which all used yeast and were much more involved.

I really like this recipe! I've made it twice and am going to make it again tonight. It is great with hummus or used as a small tortilla would be. I like that this bread is economical and can be made fresh very easily. Thanks for sharing this recipe. I will make it very often!

Very good recipe! I used all whole wheat flour, which turned out great. I added 1 tsp garlic powder to the dough, and after rolling it out, I brushed both sides with extra oil and then spread curry powder and some extra garlic powder and salt on one side. Flipped it after 5-6 sec and then cooked it for 1 min on the other side, then flipped it over again. YUM!

This is a wonderful basic roti recipe. If you want them softer, make sure you put them under a towel as soon as it comes off of the pan. Or you can use those tortillia container plastic thingys and your roti will be softer. Thanks for the recipe!

This was great I just tried it and it came out as good as the ones my Guyanese friends make.  I brushed a little margarine on my pan before I put on the roti and then as I finished each one I wrapped it in foil so they kept warm and very soft. This is a definite keeper.

This is so simple and so delicious.  I cooked them inside my pan because I have my doubts about the bottom and I ruined the first one, but after that it was fine.  I used 1/2 WW and 1/2 AP flour and the flavor was lovely.  We will be having them again. Thanks for sharing, Moomal.

This is a good base recipe. Although I will add the oil last next time - it made dough very clumpy. My grandmother was from Guyana so we loved our curry and roti. Before letting the dough rest, we usually roll out the dough and  brush with oil. Then roll it up (oil side in) like a jelly roll, portion dough into individul size & refrigerate for 45 minutes.  Once we've rolled out the dough before putting it in pan we again brush both sides with oil. When it is cooked we take the roti between our hand and literally clap it (to let the air out) - do this quickly as roti will be hot. Thanks for an old favourite. :)

omg this was so easy and fool proof.. i'm in love.. only thing i did differently was to use a regular frying pan and all purpose flour .. my only complaint is that i didn't make more.. ty so much for a wonderful recipe.. like another reviewer.. i'd love to see ideas for other ingredients to add (with amounts) to this.. also, i used Bijay's technique to cook the rotis to make sure they come out soft.. cant wait to make more

Nearly perfect recipe! I do agree with other reviews, that WARM water should be used- easier to work with & a much better end result. Had no bread flour on hand, so I dissolved some yeast in the warm water & added that for a quick version with ingredients I had. I'm not sure why (and disagree) of some reviews saying this has no 'flavor' & were adding in additional spices... true roti does not contain an abundance of flavor or additional spices. It is meant to be eaten with other dishes containing the heavier spices & flavor. Every true middle-eastern cuisine roti I have ever tried does not contain spices, only the small amount of salt. I also divided the dough into 12 smaller balls to flatten and cook, just as a personal preference since it was being used for various dips as an appetizer. Guaged the cook time on when brownish spots began to form & the roti would start to 'bubble' up in a few areas. Great, fresh out of the pan & also great leftover- this can accompany such a variety of various appetizers, dips, or main dishes. It is best left as-is, no spices added & leaving all the flavor to whatever dish goes along with it. Much appreciation for sharing the recipe!

Super easy, and turned out lovely.  I used olive oil and a drop of sesame oil in the dough.  Yummy!

this was okay, I can't tell if it was my technique or the recipe that failed me though! I am of indian decent and I was hoping for soft roti like my grandmother used to make but I found these dry and crispy.

The simplicity of this bread and the lack of need for rise time makes this one a my favorite quick breads when I am cooking Indian foods (or making wraps for dinner).  My husband frequently requests I make roti bread after trying this recipe. I always add garlic powder and use kosher salt for added flavor.  Make sure to roll it thin enough that it still puffs up but remains pliable after being cooked.  If it seems too hard after cooking try putting it in a paper bag and some of the trapped steam may help soften it.

I'm not sure if these turned out the way they were supposed to or not, but we liked them.    I followed other reviewers and added some garlic, but otherwise they didn't have a lot of flavour.    As they cooked, I put each one in a paper towel lined dish with a lid.  I also brushed them lightly with butter.  They turned out nice and soft.

I didn't need to double-flip these like others did...just let it rise and brown on the first side (about 2 min) then flip and brown the other side (about 1 min).I added 1 tsp garlic powder for flavor, which it needed. Rolling these was easy enough without too much effort, but it was hard to get them as thin as they should have been. I served it with curried goat, and made the roti skins while the goat was simmering.  I do prefer the version with split peas ground in, but I imagine that would be much more time-consuming... Overall, this is a great, fast recipe. Thank you for sharing!

I was initially a little suspect that these weren't going to work so well, but they came out beautifully. Puffing up very nicely. We followed Bijay's suggestions about cooking one side for 5 sec and then flipping. Would not hesitate in making these again.

I scaled the recipe down to 4 rotis and it was fine.

Brushed on some melted butter & garlic at the end.

Tasted good, but it was unclear exactly how thick they should be, and it seemed necessary to cook both sides as the top was still uncooked looking when the first side was charring. I wouldn’t make them again as we like naan a lot more than we liked these.

Used butter instead of oil and the salt was a tad bit too much but not overbearing. 
I actually used a normal frying pan to fruit, just put some oil in the pan when you fry it. 
I brushed the rotti with a melted butter as soon as they came out the pan and placed them in a sealed container so as to ensure they dont come out hard. 
Lastly I’d say fry them on high heat but dont dry them too long.

I made a tester and decided it needed salt. In keeping with the ethnicity I also roasted & ground a few cardamom pods, ground them & added it to the dough.

This is a good basic recipe for Roti. I made some adjustments so that it would be less like a cracker and softer to eat. After kneading the dough, I divided it into 6 balls and rolled each out. I then brushed melted butter on the rolled dough and rolled them into balls once more. I flattened and rolled flat, then cooked. It is a few more steps, but well worth it. Once they are cooked, they can be put in a kitchen towel and punched...yes, with your fists. This will soften them up even more.

Delicious! This was waaay easier than I thought it would be. I didn't cook it on the bottom of the skillet because it was rusty, so I just cooked them inside it like normal and it worked fine. I didn't have to "spread" the roti on the pan either, just tossed it on like a tortilla. I flipped mine 3 times to get them all nice and puffy. I loved the flavor and the texture. I served them with Basmati Rice and Aloo Phujia.

I've been making this for a while now, and I love it.  It comes together easily, and goes well with lots of different dishes.  I have never used the upside-down pan method to cook tho...  Just a cast-iron skillet on the burner.  I will say that I forgot about these once and they rested for way more than an hour and they were silky when I rolled them out.  Good recipe!

Really good and easy! It's even better with melted butter brushed on right after you cook it.
