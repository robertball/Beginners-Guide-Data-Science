These were great, probably would make again for the kids but not my husband and I. My youngest inhaled this but my husband and I thought they were a bit rich. I liked the combination of the banana and pecans, just thought the chocolate took it over the top. I did follow another reviewers advice and add another small chopped banana and used buttermilk. Again, another reviewer had it on the money that this recipe is a true kid pleaser.

These were amazing! I made these for breakfast this morning. My kids inhaled them! Even my neighbors son came in and devoured 2. I didn't change a thing. They are perfect as is. I have been looking for a good banana pancake recipe and my hubby has been looking for a choc chip pancake recipe and this is perfect! Thank you so much for this recipe.

These were really good! They were a big hit with the kids. I wasn't sure about leaving the bananas chunked up, but it was SO delicious!! Thanks, crazycat, for a great recipe.

Hubs is all about Chunky Monkey Ice Cream and when I saw this recipe I knew it was going to be a winner for him.  I’ve had it printed out since March of 2009 and it is now dog-eared from dragging it out as weekend after weekend would go by with unfulfilled good intentions of making these.  Today was finally the day.  We were not disappointed “CCL” -  these are, indeed, a winner and I’m sure you don’t mind that I made some small changes that didn’t change your lovely recipe.  I didn’t measure the chocolate chips, just tossed them in until it looked right for me.  I used buttermilk, mainly because I had some that needed to be used – the baking soda required for that was already in your recipe so it worked well. As for the bananas, I have fond memories of how I loved my mother’s banana pancakes and I can still picture her slicing them into the batter, so I had to do the same.  Diced or sliced, either is better than mashing them in my opinion. I love the creamy pieces of banana in the pancakes and not just the flavor of them. Finally, I left out the nuts, just because we preferred our pancakes without.  Rich, delicious and decadent, these satisfied my curiosity as well as my craving. As for Hubs, the guy who loves Chunky Monkey ice cream, he gave these the “thumbs up, make again.”

These are quite possibly the yummiest pancakes I have ever had.  I followed the recipe exactly as it is, and they turned out fluffy and perfect.  5 Stars!

What a treat!  I made a few changes:  used 1/2 whole wheat flour, mashed the bananas and used veg. oil instead of butter (too lazy to melt it).  I also omitted the nuts (personal preference).  They rose up beautifully fluffy.  I didn't have mini choc. chips, so I used regular, and I think that made them a little too rich!  If I make these again, I will probably use less choc. chips.  Otherwise, very good recipe!

The batter was a bit too think for me so I ended up adding an extra 1/3 cup of flour, then it seemed perfect.  My first two pancakes I put on the griddle without the extra flour were very flat, after the flour, puffy and nice!  I loved them, Grumpy said he could do without the chocolate....but he's picky anyway!  Great recipe.  :)

YUMMY!!! I made these this morning for our kids and a sleep over guest.  My husband is the king of pancakes in our house, and my kids all said "these are better than dad's" and the guest said that they were better than his mom's.  So I will be keeping this recipe close.  I will also be trying it will blueberries and maybe white chocolate chips.  Excellent base for just about anything you could come up with.

Super yummy pancakes. We didn't change a thing. It yields 9 pancakes.

Very tasty. My daughter had fun adding extra chocolate chips while the pancakes were cooking. Also, I took the milk, banana, and pecans and ran them through the blender so my 1 year old could still eat the nuts.

So good and so easy to make.  I think next time I will cut the choc. chips back to 1/3 of a cup.  The chocolate was just  a little overwhelming, and that's saying a lot coming from a chocoholic like me.  I would just rather taste more of the bananas.  We had a couple left over and I just dropped them in the toaster the next day for a couple mins.  I think they tasted even better on day 2.

Sorry, we did care for this.  Definitly chunky with the nuts and chunks of banana.  The kids did not like it which surprised me, they didn't like the 'chunks'  I thought the batter was runny as well and it didn't make a fluffy pancake.  Gooey with the chocolate chips too.  Thanks for the recipe anyways.

My son requested these for his birthday.  These are perfect with only 1/4 cup mini choc chips.  My kids thought there were too many with 1/2 cup but just perfect with 1/4 cup.  The thing I love about this recipe is with the choc chips in it I don't need to add syrup & by using mini chips you don't have to use as many because they disperse so well.  Also, I love them with fresh sliced banana on top.  Few pancakes actually fill a person up but these do with sliced bananas on top are perfect for the whole family.

these were ok, nothing overly special and bit too buttery/oily for my taste.  I'll stick to my plain pancake recipe.

These were awesome! We made these for my daughter's birthday party, and the girls really enjoyed them. I think my wife and I love them even more than they did - but we just put whipped cream on ours, no syrup!

The base pancake recipe was delicious.  They were fluffy and tasty.  

We only had 1/4 c of chocolate chips so that's what was used.  The recipe was good although I think another full banana could be added because neither one of us noticed the banana flavor at all.  

We did put banana slices on the top of the pancakes.

Very Good - and Kid approved! I used mostly oat flour (and I could see adding some ground flax seed for extra fiber), 2% milk, regualr semi-sweet chips, and left out the nuts because I didn't have any. Turned out great! Thanks CCL :)

Words can not describe how delicious these pancakes were. CCL, thank you so much for sharing. This recipe is five star. The only change I made was used whole milk (DH bought wrong milk this week) and omitted the nuts.

Our family loved these! I was looking for something different than the traditional blueberry and these were a hit! I was thinking that they might be good with a little peanut butter melted and drizzled over top but haven't tried that yet. :)

Incredible! To save leftover pancakes, let cool, seperate with wax paper, wrap in plastic wrap, put in plastic bag, then freeze. Microwave for 60-90 seconds to reheat!

I huge hit with the kids.  I'm glad this recipe was in my inbox this morning because I was drawing a blank this morning when the kids were asking for breakfast.  Served it with bacon on the side and even my banana hating daughter ate them faster the I could get them off the griddle.  My son also made bacon "tacos" with them and they were so good he and I decided to add bacon right in them next time.  Thanks for saving my morning!

I hate bananas but I made these for my family.  They thought they were divine.  Kids devoured them!  I served them with a little whipped cream, more slices of banana and a few more choc chips.  ...no syrup.  I'll make again.  Oh!  ...toasted the pecans in a pan before hand (better flavor that way).

Made them a second time. Added 1/2 tsp of almond oil. Yummy!  Made a couple for myself before adding the banana. Served with syrup and powdered sugar today.

I love Chunky Monkey Ice Cream; so when I saw this as todays recipe of the day,  I had to make for breakfast.  It was sooooo good.  I only had chocolate chuncks; so I first poured the mix on the griddle, then add the chips.  After cooking I spread a thin layer of peanut buter on the pancakes and added syrup.  Yeah, we like the sugar high - LOL.  Loved them.  Will make again for sure.

Came across these and immediately had to make them for my 5 year old (his nickname is Chunky Monkey). They came out perfect! I used regular sized chocolate chips because I didn't have mini chips. I think those made it better for the kids. I topped them with a scoop of homemade whipped cream and some crushed pecans. Perfect!

I expected these to turn out very sweet and closer to a dessert-like pancake. I was wrong! These are moist, flavorful, and have just the slightest hint of sweetness. I made them with semi-sweet chips instead. The second time, I made them with only whole wheat flour (red). They were incredibly filling, but still moist and fluffy and yummy.

My daughter (7) raved about these and made a special effort to call Dad to tell him about them! I will definitely make these again and again.

These are good, but a little too sweet for me, esp. with the addition of syrup. Don't know if I will make them again, and if I do, it will be with modifications.

This was ok. Our family couldn't taste the banana even though we added extra and reduced the amount of chocolate. I doubt we will make these, again

These are SO good! I fell upon this recipe because my nickname for my son is "chunky monkey" so of course I had to make them!  I have made them 3 times so far and will be making them again this morning. My son had liked them so much he requested these when it was his birthday.  I keep the bananas in small chunks, and use semi sweet chocolate chips (not the mini) and just eye ball the amount that I want in my batter. I think that gives just the right amount of chocolate taste using the regular size chips.  I also use half wheat flour and half white flour just to try to make it a little healthier. The great thing with this recipe, none of us use syrup! It is also wonderful to grab one and eat cold when you have a sweet tooth.

This is definately a wonderful recipe.  We mashed our banana as did some of the other reviewers. Otherwise we did not alter the recipe.  Our first batch we had regular sized chocolate chips which made them more chocolaty.  The second time we did the recipe we used the mini chocolate chips.  My 7 year old who, in recent years, has become more picky even loved these.  They even became snacks after school one day.  We double the recipe so we have a bunch to have on hand for quick breaskfasts and snacks...if there are any left after breakfast.  Serious KUDOS!!

This stuff is amazing, the first time I made them, my guy said "this is what I wanna have for breakfast for the next 30 years" :P he usually never is that enhusiastic about food, thats how good these pancakes are. 

Make sure you MASH a ripe banana, it makes a HUGE difference in flavor versus the diced. Also I omitted the butter, and used only the cooking spray. They turned out fabulous.

This was by far the best pancakes I have ever had. I do change the recipe according to my family though.... My brother does NOT like bananas so I take the bananas and pecans out of the batter. When I start to cook them on the griddle I pour on the batter and then add the chocolate chips/peanut butter chips, bananas, and pecans accordingly. Once that is done my family inhales them!

I made it when my niece was here. My teenaged sons enjoyed it and so did the rest of the family. I didn't have pecans so I skipped it and served it with butter and honey. Finger- licking good. Will be making it again.

Definitely very tastey! I'm not a huge fan of pecans, so I didn't add them when I made it. However I did add roughly a tablespoon of cinnamon to the dry mix and it was an amazing addition!

These were alright. Of all the pancakes I've eaten (and I've had a fair share in my lifetime lol!), these aren't top on my "favorites" list. The texture was not to my liking at all, but then again, (as the title implies) these ARE CHUNKY monkey pancakes. If you like bananas, nuts and chocolate (and a chunky texture), you'll LOVE these. Admittedly, I enjoy all of these ingredients, but not in pancake form. I guess I'm a traditionalist at heart.... :) I might give these another try, but will definitely omit the nuts (I'd use as garnish instead), MASH my bananas (as opposed to dicing them) and substitute peanut butter swirl morsels for the chocolate chips called for (there's just something INTOXICATING about the combo of chocolate, PB and banana together). A drizzle of maple syrup and Hershey's chocolate sauce made for a decadently sweet treat. If for nothing else, I was at least able to enjoy breakfast for dinner, something I don't do often. Thanks for sharing your recipe, CCL! :-)

I've been making something like this for a while but used complete pancake mix. I decided to try this to see if it would be better. I didn't have skim milk and used 1% and didn't have pecans. I usually mash my bananas, personal preference. Also I don't add the chocolate chips in the batter since they tend to sink to the bottom or cluster on the pan. I pour the batter then sprinkle the chips on the top. The consistancy was a bit thin for me. Whenever I make this with a different recipe, I make a peanut butter syrup. 2 big scoopfuls of chucky peanut butter and 1/2 cup of pancake syrup. Microwave for 30 seconds, take out, stir, and microwave for 20 seconds. It's a very sweet combo, but my family loves it.

I just made these. They are very good , but next time I will probably not chop the pecans as finely and might add more banana (I sliced them into the batter). If a little bit more sugar were added the syrup might not be necessary. I did make 1.5 x the recipe as I didn't think the original quantity would make quite enough. We ended up with three 6-inch pancakes left over between the two of us, out of a total of eight pancakes. If we had anyone over we'd need to double or triple the recipe. Will make this again.

These were great! Served straight off the griddle with some butter--the kids didn't even ask for syrup! They don't like nutty pancakes, but these were still chunky enough. A frozen banana, chopped while still frozen, worked just fine.

They were good. Thanks for sharing. I omitted the nuts by mistake, but followed everything else.

Chunky Monkey Pancake Haiku: "Monkeys leap through trees. Soar to breakfast for pancakes! Devour their plates!" These were exceptionally-good, but no surprise there, based on the reviews, drool-worthy photos, and that my monkey family adores the combination of bananas and chocolate. For preference, we left out the pecans, and mashed the banana instead of dicing ~ straight off the griddle and into my mouth. Yum!

These pancakes were soooo good!  The only changes that I made were to mash the banana really well (chunks kinda gross me out), and I used slightly less chocolate chips than called for...just under 1/2 cup.  I had no problems with runny batter or flat pancakes.  I used 1/4 c measuring cup to measure out the batter for each one and it yielded 10 decent sized pancakes..not too big, not too small.  My hubby and sister said that they were really good (between mouthfuls of pancake lol).  :~)

Delicious! Mashed the banana to distribute it a little better and used a combination of milk chocolate morsels and semi-sweet because we didn't have enough of either. I actually preferred the milk chocolate, but my husband thought they made the pancakes a little too sweet.

The flavour was really good. Just the perfect level of sweetness (I usually have to half the amount of sugar called for in a recipe, but the 1 tbsp called for in this recipe is just right for my taste).  I also used 1-1/2 bananas (instead of 1 banana) for an extra kick, and mashed them (instead of dicing). If you are new at making pancakes, I would definitely recommend being generous with the cooking spray! It makes flipping the pancake a lot easier. Also, do not spread the batter into a very thin layer on your skillet. Not only will you smear your chocolate chips everywhere (giving your pancakes a burnt appearance), it will make the pancake-flipping process very difficult (makes them break more easily)! Just spread out your pancakes a little and it will cook thoroughly (without burning) if you cook it for long enough, which for me, was about 3 minutes for the first side, and about 1 minute for the other side (after flipping). Another piece of advice for flipping pancakes: I would not recommend using a plate to cover the pancake in your skillet and flipping the skillet upside, because the side that comes in contact with the plate is still RAW, so it sticks to your plate (very messy)! All in all, a good recipe - a little bit too hearty for me, as I prefer plainer pancakes, but my chocolate- & banana-loving family enjoyed it so I will be making these again.

Okay, so my husband took a bite and said "It tastes like banana bread!" Indeed, it does. This recipe is a nice combination of sweet and salty, crunchy and chewy. I used half whole wheat flour and walnuts instead of the pecans. The batter was really thick, so they really filled us up, but we really enjoyed this recipe. Thanks CCL!

These were wonderful.  I made these by and large as written -- I substituted 1T ground flax seed + 3T water for an egg, and omitted the nuts.  Everyone went "bananas" for these!  My picky 3 year old probably ate more fruit at this sitting than he has all year.

They were delicous!!  My kids loved them.  We don't like pecans so I followed another reviewer and put in peanut butter.  They were a huge hit and will certainly be made again and again.  Thanks for the great idea.

These were great pancakes! I doubled the recipe but only used 2 eggs total as that's what I had and they were awesome so if you like less egg these are still for you. I added 1 tsp cinnamon as I love it. I only had multi-grain pastry flour so I added a little more baking powder to ensure fluffiness. I used 3 TBS sugar rather than 2 for the double batch as I thought it should be a tiny bit sweeter. I mashed up one banana and left the other chopped since I like to have pieces in them. I only used 2/3 cup chocolate chips and there were almost too many for me. I don't eat nuts so they weren't included but I can say that they would be too chunky if you also left the banana diced. If you want both chips and nuts I would mash or puree the banana so it's part of the batter. I melted the butter for the batter in a non-stick frying pan and let that be the greasing of the pan which worked great. I made about 17 and served with butter and powdered sugar. They were also good with maple syrup or sour cream. I refrigerated the leftovers and like to eat them cold as a snack. They tasted great and the texture was perfect - very fluffy, not mushy inside, but plenty moist!

I love, love, love these pancakes! Very sweet but very delectable. I am a huge fan of Ben&Jerry's Chunky Monkey Ice Cream.  I knew I had to try these and they did not disappoint!  I did not change a thing and served with homemade syrup.

These are awesome.  The first time I made them, we only had one egg.  I found on-line that I could use 1/4 cup of yogurt instead, so in went 1/4 of strawberry, banana & coconut yogurt.  Next time I wanted, we didn't have any eggs, so I used 1/2 strawberry yogurt.  They turned out terrific.  They did take a little longer to cook, so got slightly darker than I am used to, but tasted great.  I cut up extra banana slices for on top.

Added less sugar and mashed the bananas. I also used buttermilk. I didn't use nuts, but they would be lovely sprinkled on top.

These were more like dessert but very tasty! Will make again without chocolate chips for a less rich breakfast.

Just came back to find this recipe...2nd time in a week.  Figured I better rate it because it's a keeper!  Super easy, perfect texture, buttery color and consistency.  My kids were flipping out over these.  I made exactly as written except omitted bananas and nuts.  The batch made a total of 9 pancakes that were 4-5 inches around.

Wow!  Made these yesterday morning (a double recipe for my large family).  The batter does seem to be thin, but don't let that worry you.  The cakes bake up light and fluffy.  My daughter said they tasted like warm banana bread!  Despite the large amount of bananas in a double batch, you don't taste overwhelming banana.  My son who only eats chocolate chip pancakes loved these.  This is a keeper recipe in my family for sure.  Thank you for sharing this delectable recipe!

Very tasty and filling!  I used white whole wheat flour and splenda, but those were the only changes.  Everyone in my family loved them.

Great recipe! Yielded 9 pancakes, and took just over 40 minutes to complete. I added just a little bit more milk to the batter, but otherwise great! Love it :)

Excellent! I made for my "chunky monkey" on her birthday today...big hit for her, her sister and for me! :) I made per directed, altho tempted to add more bananas per other reviews because I am a banana fan. They were perfect as-is. I just needed to dice my bananas a little smaller so they would spread out more evenly, they were very chunky. I also used 1/4 cup reg chocolate chips because it was all I had. Just enough banana and chocolate, smooth and moist. Out of whip cream, I just topped with a tad bit of butter.  Easy to make, and I will definitely be making more again, and frequently. Thank you!!!

Thanks for the recipe "CCL" this is a keeper!

11/9/2014 Update!  My stepdaughter was home from college this weekend and specifically requested these as her Sunday morning breakfast.  I'm surprised at some of the reviews mentioning the kids do not like the 'chunks'.  Must be younger kids than teenagers coz all the kids in our blended family adore these!


Fabulous!  Always worry pancake recipes will be too sweet but not this one!  Great blend of flavors.  I had leftover real whipped cream from Thanksgiving...yowza!

We are moving and I was trying to get rid of the open pantry items that the movers wouldn't take.  I found this recipe and set out to make pancakes that I could freeze for those early school mornings (This recipe freezes really well, cook, cool, layer parchment paper between pancakes and microwave for 30 seconds to a mintute when ready to serve).  I had to taste them before I served them of course...think I am on my third, but am losing count rapidly!  These are delicious, great recipe!

Made as written for a rather critical group of 2 - ten year olds and  a five year old.  However, they did request that the nuts were to be left out. Awesome and amazing were some of their comments, plus please give this recipe to Mom. Personally I'd cut back on the chocolate chips, but the batter did rise nicely, and they weren't overly sweet before adding the syrup.  A perfecr kid pleasing recipe.  Thanks Cyndi!

These pancakes were so yummy. I made them for my daughter's one day and they were so delish I had to have one myself. I mixed all of the wet ingredients in a blender with the banana...because I knew my girls would not like chunks of banana. Then I poured the mixture into the bowl with the dry ingredients and folded in the choc chips. They were very good. Would definitely recommend.

These were absolutely delicious!!  I made them for my girls and a couple of their friends and they all loved them!  I made them as is, but did leave out the pecans.   The girls ate them with butter and chocolate syrup, but they don't need a thing.  My husband and I ate ours plain.  What a treat!

Great recipe. I made some minor adjustments. I used whole wheat flour in place of half of the flour. I used 1/2 plain yogurt, 1/2 applesauce in place of the butter. They came out delicious.

These are soooo good, they don't even need syrup. My whole family loved them! I used white chocolate chips instead and they really were perfect! Make sure to serve with butter on top & a dusting of powdered sugar and homemade whip cream on the side. YUM YUM

These are VERY rich and sweet.  They are sinfully delicious, but a little too much for our tastes so early in the morning!  I think I may try them again, cutting out the banana and decreasing the chocolate chips a tad.  Overall, though, a fun breakfast!

These are very good-- we didn't think they were great- but I will probably make them 2-3 times a year. I would like to try them without the choc. chips as well.

Great concept of combining banana and chocolate! We added peanut butter onto ours to complement the flavour (and I love PB).  It was quite sweet for first thing in the morning but everyone around our breakfast table enjoyed them! Thanks for sharing :)

My family loved these.  I made them just like the recipe, except I used soy milk and half whole wheat flour, and left out the nuts.  They were delicious.

These tasted much lighter than the name sounds - the chunky texture really came from the nuts since the bananas softened and the chocolate chips melted during cooking.  I substituted vegetable/canola oil for the butter and hazelnuts for the pecans.  We ate these with maple syrup.  I enjoyed the flavor combination, but my husband was not a fan of "something - either the banana or the maple."  This yielded 5 large pancakes for me.  If you plan to have 9, make sure to keep them about the size of your palm.

Very good.  The only change I made was that I used semi-sweet chocolate chunks rather than the chips.  They were so good - I served them as a treat for supper with bacon and fruit and my kids loved them.  This would be great for a "sleepover breakfast."

Made per recipe but will not do so again. My family didn't appreciate banana chunks in their pancakes and the chocolate chips are easily burned when added with the batter. If made again, I will mash bananas first and add the chips individually to the pancakes while on the griddle. I will say that all but one was eaten.

Great recipe! I didn't use skim milk, just 2%, and I left out the pecans, but other than that, the recipe is yummy! I think the batter may have been a bit thick, but a little more milk fixed that!

These pancakes were very light and fluffy, with great flavor. I made a few minor adjustments, but not because the recipe required them ~ using 1% milk, 1/4 cup of oat flour for 1/4 cup of the all purpose, and olive oil as I discovered I had no butter. We coudn't resist topping them with a little chocolate syrup, but they really don't need anything else as the flavor is all in the pancake.

I made these pancakes as the recipe calls for and I was not a huge fan of them.  My kids liked them fairly well, but I couldn't get past the mushy lumps of bananas that I would bite into.  Next time I will mash the bananas really well before mixing together.

Flavor is good but there are too many chips in it.  I have a sweet tooth and these were way too rich for me.  I didn't mind the mushy consistency but my son did.  He usually eats two pancakes and this time he only ate a third of one.   If I would try making them again, I would put 1/3 c of chips or less and more milk to the batter since it was very thick in consistency making it very hard to spread in the skillet.  The pancakes came out very thick and we like thin pancakes.

Awesome pancakes! You don't need to change a thing! They come out flavorful, fluffy and they are pretty filling. We had two each, with a few scoops of whipped cream and golden syrup and it was too much! This recipe is perfect and it is definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

These pancakes are delicious!  I tweak mine a little.  Instead of cut up banana slices I mash one banana and add it to the liquid ingredients.  I also used slivered almonds and mini chocolate chips.  These are all time favorites!

SO DELICIOUS. I enjoyed every bite. Made as per recipe except to switch out the 1 TB of sugar for 1 tsp splenda. I chose to mash my banana, dicing it seemed like too much effort. We loved this, thanks CCL!

Wow!  This was perfect!  The diced banana did much better than slices would in a pancake, the vanilla perfectly complemented the chocolate chips, the pecans ended up slightly softened, and the consistency went perfectly with the diced banana.  Big, fluffy, tasty pancakes!  I added a little cinnamon because I thought it would be a nice addition, and that may be why they came out a little dark, but they tasted perfect!  The way I make pancakes, it made 7, not 9, and it filled up two adults and a small child.  I didn't find them to be greasy at all, but then, I take my pancakes with butter and syrup.  All in all, a tasty, hearty pancake that I look forward to making again and again for my son, since it has fruit and nuts in it.  This is no mere side-dish!  Thank you for the awesome recipe!

As is we thought this recipe was very good and a great way to use up bananas. It made very fluffy pancakes which gave me the idea to try as plain pancakes. I ommitted the vanilla, banana, chocolate chips and nuts the next time and they became the absolute perfect, fluffy pancake. This is now my go-to recipe for pancakes.

These were very yummy.  My daughter said they were the best she has ever tasted.  They're very sweet, so a little went a long way.  I think next time I'll omit the chocolate chips (much to my daughter's dismay).

I am not a fan of chocolate chips in my pancakes, but the kids that helped me make these loved, loved, loved, them! I loved that they got a little fiber in their pancakes from the banana *and* the great banana flavor. (I made some for me without chips and added nuts) Will definitely make again, both ways. Fun name, and a great recipe! Thank you, crazycatlady!

The pancakes turned out with a nice golden color like in the picture. I used non-stick cooking spray in the skillet, but the pancakes weren't as crispy as ones made from commercial pancake mix. After pouring the batter in the skillet, they spread about 1/4" more while cooking. I let the batter sit about three minutes before cooking so that the double-acting baking powder could start working. The pancakes fluff up nicely, but seem to lose a bit of their loft when removed from the skillet. I omitted the chocolate chips as others had recommended - glad I did since the pancakes had plenty of rich, buttery flavor without them. I think the chocolate chips would have been too much. Over all, it's a good recipe.

These are excellent!  The only substitution I made was to use regular sized chocolate chips (I did have any little ones on hand) and they still turned out perfectly fine.  Thanks for an excellent recipe.  We'll be making this one again and again!

Very tasty and filling pancakes.  I don't think I cared for the nuts much and will probably leave them out next time.  Thanks for sharing crazycatlady!

I'm giving these four stars because they were easy to make (as I'd never made pancakes from scratch), cooked beautifully, and fluffed up nicely.  However, I guess my kids (6 and 2) just aren't cut out for super-sweet pancakes.  My six-year-old called them "disgusting" and my two-year-old ate around the chocolate.  I served this with nothing but butter on top, but it was still too rich.  I'll definitely keep the batter mixture and try again as banana nut or blueberry, though.

What a fun recipe!  The kids loved them. They where hearty too...only took about 3 pancakes each to fill up my teens. Can't wait to make them at the next extended family gathering for our breakfast buffet.

I added two bananas because it seemed like the batter was thin. Maybe I just had small bananas, though! They were phenomenal!

Excellent recipe, I tried it for the firs time yesterday at my B&B. But I did it with a twist as my guest were glueten free, I replaced the flour with rice flour and they came out very good, even myself was surprised of the outcome. The guest loved it, so I am happy they turn out that good.

Dessert for breakfast anyone? :) Sometimes you just have to indulge...and these were really good! The batter was a little thin, but otherwise tasty.

Wow! Perfect! Fluffy, tasty, easy to make. Made two changes: used buttermilk, and left out nuts (personal preference). Didn't even add any syrup tof eat them with. Definitely on the "keeper" list.

This was an excellent recipe. I made half with chocolate chips and half without and both versions were delicious. Since I'm gluten-free, I substituted with Pamela's gf all purpose flour and it tasted 10x better than any boxed gf pancake mixes I've ever used. Thanks for the great recipe!!

I made this recipe, but modified it a little to make it vegan. First of all I mashed my banana all the way. I used soy milk, whole wheat flour, left out the butter and eggs added a little cinnamon and honey. They actually turned out really yummy!!

Used 2 bananas, no chocolate.  The batter seemed really thick but cooked up great.  Great way to use ripe bananas, I probably will make these again.

These were great! The batter is thick so you have to be sure they cook through. Enough for three pancakes each the size of my skillet. Fed my family perfectly.

These were amazing. Only substitutions we made were doing 1/4 cup chocolate chips and 1/4 peanut butter chips. You can't go wrong with chocolate, banana, and peanut butter.

These pancakes are amazing and are really good heat ups. On Sundays I make a double batch then eat them every morning for breakfast and they taste the same as the day I made them. I love them.

Loved these pancakes!!!!!!! I didn't put any nuts due to allergies and I doubled the recipe so there would be leftovers but I don't think they'll last long at all. They are very rich and my husband only ate one. I wonder what these would taste like with shredded coconut on top or in the batter. Maybe even with some sun butter(our peanut butter substitute). We put some brown sugar sauce also from this site on top and it was awesomeness. Definitely making these again

So delicious! Followed the recipe, but accidentally omitted the nuts. Still incredibly fluffy and decadent. Leftovers froze beautifully. I used Godiva semisweet and milk chocolate chips and topped it off with an Alaga / maple syrup blend. Will be using this recipe again and again.

I made this recipe for a final project for my high school Culinary class and I chose it because I love pancakes and chocolate, plus it seemed cool. They turned out terrific and everyone else liked them. I did make a few altercations, though, like I didn't add pecans since I'm honestly not too fond of nuts. The pancakes tasted great.

I followed everything to the letter except I used my frozen bananas instead of fresh. I also forgot to buy chocolate chips at the store so I user some Nutella. Neither addition was terrible but because the frozen bananas were thawing by the end of the pancakes, they got a bit watery and the bananas just fell apart. So, I would definitely recommend fresh unless you don't mind. 
To add, I made my own chocolate syrup, about 4 teaspoons of Nutella and about 2 tablespoons of 2% milk. I didn't measure I just poured the milk in a cup warmed it up and started scooping and stirring in Nutella until I got the right syrup consistency. 
These made 7 large adult pancakes and 5 small child sized ones.  
Well, thats all the info I can come up with so, Thanks for reading! Happy Eating!

These are really good! It's worth all the work. I've used this recipe for plain, chocolate chip, and the banana chocolate chip. All are excellent! It makes a really good tasty and fluffy pancake. Usually I make a few plain first for my hubby and then add the other stuff for me and my daughter. Sooo yummy :)

Absolutely loved these.  Made as is with two exceptions.  I cut the number of chocolate chips in half and mashed my banana.   Served these with whipped cream on top and  a small drizzle of chocolate.  The kids love these and they reheat well.

Made these pancakes this morning. Followed recipe exactly. Batter is a bit thick but I just patted batter down a bit after spooning onto pan. Pancakes browned up quickly but let it cook a minute longer than usual due to thickness. 
Now for tasting !!...  It is delicious!  Not too sweet. Nice and fluffy and tasty. I am definitely going to make these again.

My grandkids loved these and so did the adults. Even me and I hate bananas. Make sure you chop the banana into small pieces so they will melt into the batter when cooking. So much better than bitting into a chunk of banana

Made these for breakfast as a change from the usual pancakes. I made it exactly as written, I did not measure out the ingredients perfectly, instead looked at the consistency of the batter and added a bit here and took away a bit there according to personal preference.  I also did not add pecans but added walnuts instead. I made half of this recipe with the nuts and the other half without it. Both were very delicious. I diced the banana, to get small bits so it would be more even and not so chunky. I also did not use mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, instead used the regular semi-sweet chocolate chips by ghiardelli's. The pancakes came out great!! If you want a way to eat chocolate in the morning this is awesome!

Turned out great!  Very fluffy & tasty...  The only thing I recommend is to not mix cold milk directly with the melted butter because the butter will quickly cool and separate before you can mix it.  Combine the butter & milk,  then melt butter.
I used walnuts & dark chocolate chips :)

Hoping you don't have this too often. Too sweet, but bananas are great in this recipe. Just keep the chocolate lower . 
Pancakes for breakfast ..yummy!

I made these pancakes without the chocolate or the bananas, although I'm excited to try them with! They were freakin delicious! The pancakes came out fluffy and with GREAT taste! Not too salty, not too sweet, not dry at all.  The perfect pancake!  This recipe made 3 BIG pancakes (I was full after just one).  I had one for breakfast with butter and syrup, and one for dessert the next day with nutella and ice cream!  both of them were DE-LICIOUS!!  Will definitely be making these again!

I have made these several times and we LOVE them!! Only thing I don't add is the chocolate chips. My family are not fans of chocolate chips added to pancakes! Other than that this is a fabulous recipe and I always have to double because they disappear too quickly!!

I love to cook breakfast on the weekends.  My boyfriend loves banana and pecan pancakes and orders them in a restaurant....I love chocolate chip pancakes.  This was a no brainer to try with my new griddle.  Perfect....I have always mashed bananas and added to pancake batter, but I diced them as the recipe directed...and that small bite of pure banana with the chocolate.... the only word to say is PERFECT!

We liked these.  I left out the butter and added more milk, used unsweetened almond milk, honey in place of the sugar, whole wheat flour in place of the white, and flax meal w/ water in place of the eggs.  Turned out great!

These pancakes are pure heaven in your mouth! I used to make chocolate chip pancakes with bananas on top, but for some reason I never thought to put the bananas inside. This pancake batter incorporated just the right proportions of each ingredient to form a swirl of goodness in each bite. I would just recommend using a large spoon to scoop the batter onto the pan instead of pouring it so that your banana chunks and chocolate chips don't get left behind.

My family loved these pancakes! I did use buttermilk in place of skim milk as others had suggested, because I happened to have it on hand. I did leave out the pecans because the little ones don't like them but other than that, I left everything the same. Great pancake!

This recipe is great, a family favorite, and now staple. I omit the sugar completely since I use a very ripe banana and mash it into the mix.

my boyfriend made this for me one morning and it was awesome.  He is very inept in the kitchen, but was able to follow these directions to the T and they came out fabulous.
This is will be a special weekend breakfast from here on out

This recipe is absolutely *delicious*!! I made it on Mother's Day and my family devoured it. I was told that these were some of the best pancakes they ever had - and so rich they are almost dessert-esque. I used reduced fat milk instead of skim milk and it turned out just fine. Doubled the recipe, which was perfect for hungry boys...added chocolate syrup, banana slices, and chocolate morsels on top of the pancakes for presentation. Amazing! Thanks so much for sharing this gem! My Mother loved it! I will be making it again.

These were good but way too sweet. My son was so happy with them but my husband and I thought they were way too sweet. This is for sweet lovers and kids since they all the kids love them and request them all the time.

i don't like so much the taste of eggs(too much omelette-like), perhaps next time i will use only one. I serve this pancake with vanilla yoghurt: taste and you'll love too!

Good but it's almost overwhelming with chocolate chips and maple syrup.  Fun alternative, but not something that I'd serve often.

Made this for my children this weekend, they all loved the pancakes. The batter did make a small batch though so I would probably double it. I left out the nuts as we don't care for them. I loved these pancakes too!

This recipe was amazing and I don't even really like chocolate chips in pancakes very much.  I didn't have any pecans but I bet they'd be even better with them.

I changed these up a bit based on the ingredients I had in the house.  Instead of chocolate chips, I used creamed cinnamon honey for the added sweetness, and I omitted the pecans and vanilla.  Turned out delicious, and no syrup was needed.  I will definitely make again, and eventually try out the recipe with chocolate chips!

These were very good, the kids approve!  I think it tastes like chocolate chip banana bread.  I used 2% milk and used 1 cup instead otherwise the mix was too thick.

These got mixed reviews at our house. One of the kids loved them, the hubby thought they were okay, and the other kids just sort of liked them. The consistency turned out weird for me and the flavor was not outstanding, but the chocolate made them yummy for those who liked them!

Both of my chunky monkeys ages 2 and 4 loved these pancakes! I'm not a fan of bananas myself, but I enjoyed these pancakes as well. I followed the recipe exactly, and these pancakes came out light and fluffy!

OUTSTANDING! I made this exactly (only omitting nuts because I was serving to very young children) and it was a total hit. It was not too rich at all unless you smother it with syrup. We topped with a tad of butter and just the faintest drizzle of syrup and it was perfect.  My familys new favorite by far!!! :)

Yum Yum Yum! these were excellent. A few adjustments to make them a bit more wholesome: I increased the milk to 1 cup and used organic whole milk, I used white Whole Wheat Flour, Coconut oil instead of the butter and I left out the sugar, i also used chopped walnuts since i didn't have pecans. We topped them with 100% pure maple syrup, they are going to become our weekend special! thank you so much for sharing!

Impressive pancakes... I am from Spain and prepared them for an American friend that was staying at my place, and after eating them she told me that these were the best banana pancakes she had ever eaten... 
I prepared them without the chocolate, and they were just yummy! ;)

I made these one Saturday for my boyfriend for brunch and topped with warm maple syrup.  I followed the recipe exactly and they were fantastic.  I will definitely be making these again.

Great recipe! This was the first time I've made pancakes, and it was surprisingly easy. Just a heads up though: don't add too many chocolate chips! I'm a huge sweettooth so I thought I'd add a little bit more (almost 3/4 cup) and it was wayyyyy too much. Next time I'll make sure to cut down on the chocolate chips. but overall great recipe!

these pancakes were delicious! I used walnuts instead of pancakes, omitted the chocolate chips, and put in more bananas. My family loves the bananas taste of it, so it was good. Also, I replaced 1 tbs of the butter with plain yogurt to be healthy :-) The yogurt did not overpower the overall taste, and the pancakes still ended up fluffy! Perhaps next time I'll try using banana flavored yogurt? Looking forward to the next time I make this :)

These tasted very good but the serving size says "9", that's not true, at least for my family.  I have 6 in ours and I had to double the recipe and we still didn't have enough.

WOW!  these are amazing.  will use less chocolate chips next time, but wow. my anti-pancake husband went back for a second one (only made 4 instead of 8-9 with the full batter amount).  used blueberry syrup, but not very much as these pancakes are sweet enough as it is.  wonderful recipe!

Made these for company and they loved them!  The first batch I forgot to add the eggs and wondered why the batter wasn't runny so added more skim milk.  The next batch I added the eggs and only used the amount of milk called for in the recipe.  Myself and one guest liked the first batch better as it was much more dense and you could taste the bananas and chocolate more.  The other guest liked the proper recipe better because it was much more cake-like so I guess it just depends on what type of pancake you like.  Either way, it was great!

AWESOME PANCAKES!!!  :  ) I thought about omitting the nuts but didn't...and glad I didn't because the chocolate, nuts and bananas go very well together.  This recipe is perfect.  In our opinion, nothing needs to be tweeked...just make them exactly as listed.  Thank you for the recipe...it will be a family staple.

Yum! My step-son and I made these yesterday - I divided the mixture in half before adding the chocolate chips though because he wanted white chocolate and my son prefers regular chocolate - and I used olive oil instead of butter, and used half whole wheat flour as another review suggested. They were so good and we'll have these regularly :)

These were really good. The only thing I changed was that I mushed the bananas instead of putting them in whole. And like the other reviews, they were a little runny.

These are incredible!  I was looking for a way to use up some bananas.  My son tells me I should make pancakes this way every time!  These are worth the time it takes to make them.  Thanks, CCL!

Delicious!!!!  My 1-year old son and 6-year old daughter gobbled these up.  These will be in regular rotation in our house!  Because the baby can't have nuts yet, I left the nuts out of the batter, but sprinkled them on top of mine before eating.  This worked well. These were very quick and easy too.

I just made these in an unconventional brunch for dinner setting because I just wanted to try making these and I couldn't wait till breakfest the next day... they were interesting could of probably been prettier if I didn't mess up the turning or flipping but one thing's for sure the chocolate smears and makes the whole thing looked burned, kind of a nightmare.  I added an extra tablespoon of honey and can't wait to see how they are arrived, great recipe!

These are pretty good!  I like to have a little more banana flavor, so next time I'll add one more, or maybe slice the banana instead of dice it for larger pieces.  All around good recipe!

My four boys and my husband dove into these pancakes like there was no tomorrow!  They were amazing with both maple syrup and red raspberry syrup.  Very light and fluffy.  I used my little handheld blender to whip up the eggs until they were frothy.  And as I had no vanilla extract in the house, I used almond extract and loved that flavor.  We also omitted the pecans, due to the boys' preference.  It was kismet that I logged on tonight hoping to find a pancake recipe, and found this on the home page as a featured recipe!  Thanks a bunch!

Yummy!  Definitely use mini chocolate chips, I only had regular ones and it was a bit rich.   My kids scarfed them up (of course - they had chocolate in them!) - love the chunky bananas!

YUM! This was a huge hit. I used half whole wheat flour, mashed the banana (I don't think chunks would have worked very well) and used oil instead of butter. Served with cottage cheese - no syrup needed. The kids could not stop eating them.

SOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good! What an ingenius idea to mix all the best things into one pancake! But note, they don't come out looking all soft and smooth like normal pancakes, they're all chuck full of stuff, therefore thicker and not so round and smooth. mmmmmm. A new family favorite!

MMmmm These were Delicious! We're not really fans of big fluffy pancakes in this house , more of a crepe family , but these sounded too good not to make. These were gone so fast I couldn't take a picture , even my son who hates bananas ate half of his. I didn't have vanilla but they still came out great.

Threw out my old tried and true pancake recipe after tasting these.  A huge hit with the whole family.    I added fresh strawberries on top and we all found that syrup wasn't necessary.

My son requested banana chocolate chip pancakes for his birthday, and this had good reviews so I thought we'd give it a try.  I followed the recipe exactly but omitted the  nuts for the kids and just sprinkled them on top of mine and my husband's.  We didn't think these were anything special and my kids were not fans of the chunks.  I'm glad we tried it, but won't be making it again.

Very good, only change I made was to change 1 cup all-purpose flour to 1/4 cup whole wheat and 3/4 all-purpose.  Everyone loved them and they were very filling. I will be making these again.

Really great pancakes. It really does make 9 when using 1/4 c. measurements. I put 2 bananas in instead of 1 (my only variation) and it wasn't too chunky. Great for breakfast for dinner meals.

Very good, didn't add sugar or salt (used salted butter) and it was perfect.  Had I added more sugar, it would have been way too sweet.  Thanks for the recipe.

GREAT! These were wonderful, not too banana-y, I put a spin on them... I left out the chocolate chips and was glad because I think they would've distracted from the rest of the great taste! I added 1/4 cup of oats instead, And while the pancakes were made I used beaters to whip a little cream cheese, butter, white sugar, and Reddiwhip, into a fluffy spread to go between the pancakes. Pour a little real maple syrup over this concoction and you've got heaven in a pancake!! I made this for Easter breakfast, everyone was so engrossed in their food- it was the most silent breakfast table ever! :)

This were fantastic!  I loved the cut up bananas instead of mashing them.  I did leave out the pecans because I didn't have any, and added 1/4 c of flax seed and 1/4 c of wheat germ.  I also substituted 1/2 c. of the flour for wheat flour and added a full cup of milk and added 2 T of sugar instead of one.  I loved them and so did my kids.

These are my four-year-old son's favorite lazy day breakfast.  Use the mini chips as directed.  The larger chips made for too much chocolate and put the whole dish out of balance.  We LOVE these!  Thank you for sharing!

A great use of old bananas, however this recipe was wayyyyy too sweet for us.  Also the crunchy nuts didn't seem to fit.  If I make these again I will use less or no sugar, no nuts, and maybe even no chocolate chips.  I much preferred the banana pancake recipe on this site that uses ground up rolled oats.

OMG some of the best pancakes I've ever had!  So thick and fluffy!  Just how I like them!  I did sub walnuts for the pecan's but that's the only change.  This is definitely going on our morning rotation!  Thanks Crazycatlady!

I made these for breakfast today & really enjoyed them!  I only had 2 small bananas around, so used both of them.  Also, I didn't fold the chocolate chips into the batter, but just sprkinled them on top of half of the pancakes as they were cooking so that I had some with and some without the chips.  This was my first time making pancakes from scratch & the batter was more runny than the box kind, but they turned out REALLY good and tasted great. I actually enjoyed the ones with the chocolate chips in them better, but I have a sweet tooth. I just used my 1/4 measuring cup to dole out the batter onto the skillet and was able to make 4 pancakes at a time. Thanks for sharing this superb recipe crazycatlady!!!

TOP OF THE LINE!  These pancakes are a special treat.  The flavors are separate.  You never know what your next bite will be.  Banana chunks, chocolate chips, and chopped nuts are all my favorites, therefore, this ranks TOPS!  Thank you crazycatlady for such a great recipe!

I made these for a family get-together breakfast, and everyone loved it! Even my picky cousins asked for seconds. I'll definitely make these again :)

I really liked these.  I was lazy today and used Mrs. Butterworth's pancake mix, and added the bananas and regular chocolate chips.  Love the banana flavor, and it really works with the chocolate.  Also, it is very filling, held us over until lunch, which is unusual.  Surprisingly, the kids did not like it as much as I and the hubby prefers his stuff plain.  Boring for them:)

Loved this recipe - my youngest ate them like cookies! I did leave out the pecans for the kids (picky little monkeys), but added them in for me. Thanks for a keeper!

Fluffy & chocolaty.  I liked using the mini chocolate chips.  I will increase the amount of bananas next time to give a little more banana flavor.  We all loved these.

Very good!  My 4 yr old who says she doesn't like bananas even ate them!  We thought the batter looked a little runny but they cooked up just fine!
