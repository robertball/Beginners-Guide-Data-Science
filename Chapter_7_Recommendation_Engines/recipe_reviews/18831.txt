Absolutely fantastic!  At the other reviewer's suggestions, I used a higher quality lamb meat and made sure to trim half the fat to allow a little extra to flavor the dish since most of it seems to burn off.  I also added couscous instead of the bulgar, and it seemed to be just as good.  I added a little extra cinnamon, too.  The raisins added just the touch of sweetness to compliment the dish, but my boyfriend hates raisins, so I drizzled a bit of honey over the top of his dish, and he said it complimented the flavors very well.  I'm definitely keeping this to make again, and I'm eager to find some sides that will pair up well with this main course.  Perhaps something a bit spicy?

This looked quick, simple, and like something a 'little different' so I made it this evening.  Very tasty!  I didn't have bulghar at home so I used couscous - I think it worked out just fine.

This was delicious!  I used a lamb shoulder steak and sliced it thinly.  The meat was a touch bland, but it's not so obvious when it's mixed in with everything else.  The combination of flavors is great and very different from what I usually eat!

Sooo good!I was a little leary to try it because I only had ground lamb on hand, but OH MY!I added a little extra bulgur to even out the lamb amount and also added a can of sliced carrots so it was a complete meal!I could eat lamb every day lol and not tire of it...So I am always excited to find new recipes (excuses) to make it.THis is a keeper...THANK YOU for sharing this!

This dish is an excellent adventure in Middle Eastern cooking! It's fairly simple to make. The raisins are essential! We substituted beef for lamb once, it turned out successful, but the lamb is definitely superior. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used lamb stew meat like the recipe said, but it turned out rather bland and chewy. I'd recommend trying it with higher quality meat.

This recipe is delicious. As usual, I didn't have all the ingredients handy and there's never enough time in the day. Instead of lamb, I used chicken and instead of Mediterranean seasoning are used turmeric; I put it all in a crockpot, with a little more water and broth and cooked for four hours. Turned out great!
