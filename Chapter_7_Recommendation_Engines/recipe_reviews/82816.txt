This is my first review and the only reason I'm doing so now is because this recipe was not rated and I want more people to try it.  I had not heard of this before, and when I told my husband I was making this dish with the funny sounding name, his eyes lit up and said he'd always wanted to try it, has several recipes of his own, but hasn't made it.  Needless to say it was a hit.  The flavors blended perfectly and was a snap to put together.  The only change I made was to saute the mushrooms in some butter before adding to chicken.  Served with Sesame Asparagus from this site, and my husband said it was restaurant quality.  Evidently, Harry Carey's restaurant in Chicago is known for this recipe.  Pls try it.

Ok let me start by saying I am [not] trying to be rude, but I was looking for a chicken vesuvio recipe and I found this one. I live in Chicago and I never had chicken vesuvio with mushrooms and black olives and green onion usually it is either bone in or chicken breast. I have never had it at Harry Carayâ€™s though. Chicken is usually in white wine and herb sauce with potatoes. I am just not sure of the exact herbs. Chicken Cacciatore has mushrooms and black olives in it. Sorry I hope you take no offense.

Wow, this was amazing.  I only had dried rosemary, regular white potatoes, and  merlot; put in a lasagna pan so everything could spread out better.  I didn't change anything else, and look forward to trying it exactly as written.  I kept predicting that the potatoes weren't going to be done along with the chicken, but it was perfect, almost a Greek/Italian/middle east medley.  Thank you so much!

Made this today because we love all the flavors involved.   Cut recipe in half for 2 of us but had to make a lot of modification.   I knew that 1 hr. would far too long for boneless chicken breasts. Cut potatoes in 1/8ths, browned the chicken lightly on each side, and baked for approx. 20 mins. before adding sauteed mushrooms.   Bake another 20 mins. and even then the chicken was a little dry.  The flavors are wonderful and I added  more garlic (we also love rosemary).   I normally do not rate a recipe that I have had to alter so much, but perhaps it will help others who have run into some of the same problems.  Will make it again, but with more modifications.  Certainly will not change seasonings.

This recipe was amazing! I added a lot of extra garlic, and I had to bake for about an extra 10 to 20 minutes for the chicken and potatos to be just right. It was DELICIOUS! After 30 minutes, I drizzled a bit more olive oil on the potatos. One of the best, if not THE best recipe out of the 6+ i've made on here.

My family liked this recipe. I used regular yellow onions and didn't use rosemary. I added more garlic and doubled the amount of gravy next time. I needed to add 1/4 cup of chicken broth toward the end of baking because the gravy was baking away. Next time I will try making it with 1 tsp of dried rosemary. I baked it at 375 degrees for 45 - 60 minutes, basting every 10 minutes.

We all liked this and thought it had alot of flavor.  I like rosemary but I thought 2 tsps would be too much so I only added one.  Wouldn't change anything else though.

This was a good recipe, though it didn't have the prettiest presentation. It was very light and flavorful, though heavy on the lemon. After reading other reviews, I was liberal with the salt and pepper and it came out fine.

I personally did not care for this.  while the sauce was indeed quite tasty the chicken and potatoes were bland -- I marinated it for ~2 hours.  Edible, but laking.

Maybe we did something wrong, but overall we found this one to be pretty bland.  I've never made this dish or any version of it before, so I don't have anything to compare it to.  It was just all right.

We liked this better the our standard rosemary-garlic chicken (from this site).  The lemon juice made the chicken so tender and moist.  I didn't have any green onion or black olives but am definitely going to put those in next time.  Thanks so much for the recipe ISYBEL.

Definitely edible, but definitely something I wouldn't add to the rotation. Was looking for a 'cupboard' recipe, and it worked. fiance ate it. but he likes his potatoes mushy, and they certainly weren't. removed the chicken and cooked 40 minutes longer. (and i cut them into 1/2 inch pieces) Tasted ok, added extra garlic, but still seemed like it was lacking something. Even used an italian seasoning instead of straight rosemary. might use this as a base for something better, but nothing to write home about.

Good, added white wine, need to play with and could be perfect!  maybe try cream of chicken with herbs to make a light lemony cream sauce. maybe crock pot too.

It was edible, but no one from age 3 to 14 enjoyed it, nor did my husband.  The potatoes ended up tasting like lemony, boiled potatoes.  It was a moist breast, but definitely boring. I served with Normandy Vegetables & those ended up getting eaten up, instead of the Vesuvio.  Great name, bland recipe.  Sorry ISYBEL

Almost exactly like the place in Chicago where the dish was invented (Sorry to all the people who think this came from Italy. It's from Chicago). The only and I mean ONLY suggestion I can make to make this exaclty like the restaurant in Chicago (name escapes me. It was on Milwaukee Ave. Near downtown) is that I use bone in, skin on breasts. Other than that? It's perfect.

As to the reviewer who does not like rosemary, you're right. This has a VERY strong rosemary presence. I love it, but not everyone does.

The flavors of this recipe were very good, but the chicken came out a bit dry.  I was surprised chicken breasts really need to cook a full hour at 400 degrees.  Next time I'd be sure to use a much larger baking pan so the chicken and potatoes could be more spread out and actually roast.  My husband suggested using thighs instead.  I also added more potatoes and mushrooms to make it more of "meal"

Has potential to be 4 or even 5 stars, well add a bit more garlic, white wine another pinch of salt and see what hat does.

This time made it as suggested and for me a bit bland

This recipe is very simple. Even though it says you bake it, I cooked everything in a cast iron skillet. Very good, and I will make it again.

Since I LOVE olives, garlic, lemon and mushrooms, this dish was calling my name.   Added extra garlic and served it with Chef John's Truly Delicious Brussels Sprouts as a side dish.  Decided to use small red potatoes for a color contrast plus I quite like them. Make sure to add salt and pepper!

This was lacking all around. Edible, but not great. The potatoes took over an hour to cook, even though I sliced them pretty thin. Also, the chicken was a bit dry and bland. With all the other good chicken recipes out there, I don't even think this one is worth trying to jazz up or "fix." It was certainly edible, but not great for sure. I won't make this one again.

Nice change of pace for chicken!  I had baby new potatoes, so I didn't cut them and added them after 20 minutes, but after another 20 min the larger ones weren't quite done.  I'm not a huge rosemary fan, but it didn't seem to over power the dish at all (I used 2 large tsp of fresh).  I didn't have green onions, so I used fresh chives instead.  Chicken was juicy and tender, my 2 yr old ate it up, as did all the adults! Omitted the olives as we are not an olive family.

I used a cut up chicken and quadrupled the marinade. I put chicken and marinade in a bag and put in fridge for 4 hours without potatoes. Did potatoes right before popping into a 300' oven for 4 hours covered with parchment and foil. It came out moist, very flavorable. Everyone just loved it! I also used dried rosemary.

My husband had this dish waiting for me after work, which makes it a very easy and wonderful dish to begin with! We didn't have olives, so he added a chopped, fresh tomato instead. We also added capers before serving. Very tasty and healthy!

We are big fans of rosemary and olives so I just had to try this recipe.  I am very glad I did - we thought this was excellent.  I used black, sun dried olives that were very salty,really added a kick to the flavor.  I can't wait to try it again with kalamata olives!

Warning: You must appreciate rosemary for this dish to be enjoyable. However, I made this light and refreshingly moist dish for a very picky family with a toddler and preschooler. Both went back for seconds and my husband ate the rest! We skipped black olives due to my hubby's aversion, but this is a nice, light chicken dish different from the heavy gravy dishes I usually make.

Very good, nice flavours - I made this when we had company for dinner - it was also fun to say "Chicken Vesuvio!," over and over. A tip - I always microwave potatoes for 1-2 mins before baking - to ensure they are always nice and soft.

This was awful, I definately wouldn't make it again.  My husband specifically asked me to not make it again.
