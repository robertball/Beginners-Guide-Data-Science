This was a hit! Very good! I made just a few minor changes. First I used flaky layers biscuits and separated them in half. This gives less bread and more room for filling and less to buy as you'll only need one can of biscuits this way. I also omitted the cheese as that is just a preference for me, and I added salt and pepper.

My teenagers and husband loved it for our holiday meal. I added creole seasoning and diced crisp pepper bacon. They were perfect portions. Just a tip for your meal no rolls needed if your making this, one less thing to make for a holiday meal ;)

So great! The only things I changed was to use half & half instead of milk, cream of celery instead of cream of mushroom,  and most importantly, I cut the biscuits in half and then rolled them into 4" circles (only used 1 tube).  There was plenty of dough. Too much for a whole biscuit plus the green beans mixture in one cupcake hole. It was perfect with half. Great recipe; will definitely make again!

This was an absolute fantastic ideal to spruce up the green bean casserole.  I used french style beans and no milk. Once you heat up the beans and mushroom soup it has a thicker consistency and not so soupy. The milk tends to make it too soupy and soggy. Just  a personal preference but it works out great.

My husband and I aren't big green bean casserole fans and we both loved this!  Just make sure to load the cups as much as possible with the beans- otherwise you don't get as good of a ratio.

Made these to bring to Christmas dinner and they were yummy! Easy to make and taste every bit as good as the casserole. I took the suggestion of using half a biscuit each and that was spot on! Highly recommend and will make again!

I did the recipe as is. It wasn’t bad but next time I will change it up a little. Add salt and pepper, less cheese and definitely split the biscuits in half. Over all decent but bland.

So good! Had to make it with cream of chicken as I’m allergic to mushrooms! I’d get low sodium soup next time! Super easy to make!

Not a fan. Made for a football party last night.  I was intrigued by the individualized servings.  Easy enough to prepare.  I used the half grand flaky biscuits like many reviewers recommended - more than enough biscuit.  I thought the flavors were in conflict with one another and didn’t harmonize - traditional green bean casserole, or slo-cooker versions for me going forward. My guests were excited by the presentation, but not wowed by the taste results.

Easy! Great! Easy to add your own touch too... We loved adding crushed red pepper to it! Then, breadcrumbs on top! Will definitely make this again!
