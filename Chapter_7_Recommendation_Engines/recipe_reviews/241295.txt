Great recipe that I will use again. It's a solid base recipe. I didn't have sour cream so I used milk. Needs to have salt and pepper on squash and onions. I also seasoned milk/cheese /egg mixture with salt and pepper. We had a Poblano pepper and mini orange pepper from our garden that I chopped fine and added. Thank you for a great recipe that can be jazzed up for different flavor palettes!
