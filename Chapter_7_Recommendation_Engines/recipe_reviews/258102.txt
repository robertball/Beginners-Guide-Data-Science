Very yummy dinner for a cold, wintery night like tonight.  I added 1/2 red enchilada sauce and 1/2 tomato sauce instead of  100% tomato sauce after reading that some thought it too bland. Next time I will dice up some  some jalapeno peppers and add to the enchilada wrap also.  But overall a good, quick meal for a Friday night.  Thanks for posting this.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. It is quick, easy and tasty.  It's a nice way to fix hot dogs that are not just a dog in a bun. Thanks for posting the recipe.

This is my family's recipe, and when I posted it to this website, I did not specify how large the can of tomato sauce should be. It SHOULD BE an 8 oz. can NOT the 15 oz. can. Also, my wife prefers the onions and the olives on the inside of each 'lada. Enjoy!

I really liked this. I did think the tomato sauce made it a little bit bland. Next time I might try using enchilada sauce instead. Over all good recipe though and one I will make again. Thanks for sharing!
