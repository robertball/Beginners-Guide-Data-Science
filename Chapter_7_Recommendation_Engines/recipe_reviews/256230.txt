This bread is easy and delicious! I did not have a food processor so just did it by hand and it was still very quick. Great recipe to change up the seeds and millet you have on hand. I did not have hemp seeds so added extra sunflower and oats. I also added wheat bran and oat bran (added 2 tbsp. extra water). Bread was soft and delicious and kept very well without crumbling or drying out but fresh bread gets eaten quickly in our house. Thank you for this recipe!

Great multigrain bread.  I didn't have millet, so substituted sesame seeds.  Wonderful mix of "grains"  Nice light loaf.  Rose beautifully.   Thanks for the recipe.

A nice light bread as promised. I used 1\4 cup of multigrain hot cereal mix in p!ace of the specific grains listed and about 2Tblsp extra water. Came out very flavorful.
