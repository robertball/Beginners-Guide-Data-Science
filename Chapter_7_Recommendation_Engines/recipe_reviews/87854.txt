Have made it a few times because it was a big hit with the hubby. One thing I changed was amount of crab-I doubled it and used imi crab.

Despite mixed reviews I tried it, and I'm glad we did!  My husband had 3 helpings.  I used bowtie pasta, and imitation crab (double the amount).  Otherwise, I followed everything, and it was great.  It did make a lot, and most of my extended family doesn't eat seafood, but that was the only downside!

I cut this back to three servings as no one else likes sea food salad. I didn't have salad shrimp so I used large, raw shrimp that I cute into smaller pieces and and cooked in a skillet with Earth Balance and fresh lemon juice. For the crab I used Johan, it's what I had. I used farfalle pasta as it makes a prettier presentation.  The only thing wrong with this recipe is that it lacks flavour, it needs something bright to lift the ingredients to the next level.
