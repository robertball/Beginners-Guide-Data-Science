Simple and delicious - great for a quick snack! I love peanut butter and apples but warm them up so the peanut butter is nice and melty and place them both between two slices of toasty, warm, crunchy bread and well...you have a really nice treat. I used a Granny Smith apple and I can't wait to try this with crunchy peanut butter.

I made this for my son's lunch.  He is strictly a PB&J kid.  He was a little upset that I made something different.  I called them "Apple Pie Sandwhiches"  Not only were they a hit but now the other moms want the recipe.  I did mine differently.  I sauteed the apples in a skillet with butter, cinnamon and sugar.  Then set the apples aside.  I browned the bread on the skillet with the butter I used for the apples.  Then I put peanut butter on the side of the untoasted bread slices, spooned the apples over one peanut butter slice and placed the other on top.  I cut them in fourths for easier handling.  I made these for my other kids too.  It was the first time lunch time was silent.

This was really yummy-tasted more like dessert than lunch. The cinnamon/sugar could probably be adjusted to suit taste. I used PB on both sides of the bread and added cin/sug. to the tops of the bread while frying which gave it a fried dough taste. My 5 yr old said this was the best lunch she's had in her whole life ;-. Next time, I'd like to try actually grilling these in on a panini grill to maybe cut down on the calories. Thanks!

I really loved these, but I did modify a bit so... I am sure it would taste good the way it is written, but I am of a creative mind and like to experiment. Here's what I did, just in case you want to try some of my modifications.  First of all I always melt my butter for grilled sandwiches so I can use less. I only made two sandwiches, so 4 slices of bread, but I only used about 1.5 TBSP of butter (salted), by brushing it on the outsides of the bread with a silicon brush. I did this before spreading peanut butter on the other sides of the bread.  Second, though I only made 2 sandwiches I used almost all of the apple.   Thirdly, I precooked the apple for 30 seconds in the microwave with the cinnamon and sugar sprinkled on them. (I was afraid that the bread I was using wouldn't allow the heat to penetrate enough to cook the apple at all... I think this made a big difference. Yum!)  Finally, I had this great apple cranberry whole grain bread laying around that sounded like it would be terrific with this recipe, and it was!  My 95 year old grandma and my 9 year old daughter both liked the sandwiches very much. It was quite filling too.

We had these as after school snacks.  ALL my kids ate them, which is a feat in itself.  Even the visiting child who initially said no to the sandwich, gave in and had one.  Great with milk!

Grilled PB Apple Sandwich Haiku: "Tasted like dessert. (Maybe isn't a bad thing.) Bit too sweet for me." Made these for lunch today, and my vote next time is either for a grilled cheese, or a peanut butter banana sandwich. (Or just simple smears of peanut butter on apple slices.) These sandwiches were good, but didn't do it for me, as far as being a lunch was concerned. Only change that I made was eyeballing the peanut butter, which I spread on both sides of the bread. Much to my surprise,  my 3-year old dissected her sandwich, and left apple carnage on her plate.

This was awesome (at least according to my kids and husband).  In the middle of my dinner preparation (I was making a brand new meal) I realized my kids and husband would not like at all what I was making. I needed something fast and I recalled viewing this recipe.  It was so easy and loved by the whole family.  Thanks!

Was sitting at home today with a major case of the munchies and came across this recipe. I don't think it could have been better.

Wow!!! So so so yummy. Even the grownups wanted some at our art day.  Definitely a keeper - we used crunchy peanut butter and I think that held it all together really well....The flavors really complimented each other!

I was going to give this 4 stars until I realized that I forgot to put the cinnamon and sugar on them. I think with the cinnamon and sugar these would for sure be 5 stars. I will be making these again.

This was pretty good. I had to use Granny Smith Apples because that's all I had but it turned out fine.I think its just a matter of taste when it comes to apples.

These were odd.  I don't know if we liked them or not.  They were kinda good, but just odd.  Probably not make them again.

These are sooooo good! They're my new favorite sandwich. They remind me of the "Cinnamon Raisin Swirl Sandwich" at Peanut Butter & Co. in New York, except more affordable.

For this recipe I only had Granny Smith apples on hand to use.  I also had a jar of cinnamon sugar already mixed.  I put peanut butter on both sides of the bread, then sprinkled lightly with the cinnamon sugar.  After adding apple slices I gave another light dusting of cinnamon sugar and toasted. Quick, easy and good!

absolutely delicious!  i used a granny smith apple because that's all i had and put peanut butter on both sides of the bread.

at first i didn't know what to expect with this recipe, but the apples soften up slightly and make this a delicious comfort food sandwich.  i ate the rest of the apple dipped in splenda and brown sugar which was also really good!

These were great.  I will add a bit more cinnamon/sugar mix next time, it was a bit hidden by the peanut butter.

Yummy, delicious, tasty, had thought of this out nowhere and went to see if there was really a thing and ran across yours so I tried it out!!  Soo good!!  I put a little apple butter instead of the cinnamon & sugar and it was perfect i also buttered the bread kinda habit from the way i do grilled cheese it was good i like the saltiness of cooked real butter i almost put to much though.  Definitely awesome with warm PB  and apples lovely on a cold colorado day!  I'm so weird in winter I like eating almost all hot/warm food and in summer all cold food! I think this could work both ways.  Also lots of variations can be done!

It was very good, but I made another one where I sauteed the apple slices with butter and sprinkled the cinnamon/sugar mixture over them while cooking before putting them on the PB coated bread. 
Gave it a little more dessert like dimension. Good either way, and quick.

It was just okay for me.....I think I would prefer just a peanut butter and jelly sandwich over this one.  It was very bland for the amount of calories I was taking in.

I love apple peanut butter sandwiches so I thought I would give this a try. I didn't really measure the cinnamon and sugar - I don't think I used enough sugar though! I also didn't use the butter, I just used cooking spray - next time I'll definitely use the butter!! I'm sure it tastes great that way.

As much as I love apples and peanut butter, I was expecting this to be better.  I don't think it was bad but also not good enough to probably ever bother with again.  Grilled peanut butter and jelly is better in my book!

I made one for me and one for each of my children ages 5, 3, 2, and 1. They all ate it right up and without a fight, and I thought it was delicious! This is easily one of the best recipes I have found for my kiddos. Thank you!

These sandwiches were REALLY good. Not only  are they good; they have the potential to be relatively healthy. Both of my kids loved them and I certainly didn't complain. Great recipe to mix up lunchtime a little bit. Thanks for sharing!
