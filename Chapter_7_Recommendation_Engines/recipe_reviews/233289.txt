Made for Recipe Group. I think these were a great idea and made for a very filling pancake. I thinned the batter by adding some extra milk. I made 1/4 of the recipe and got 6 medium size pancakes. My one issue was with the onion--I chopped it finely, but I think it would have been better to grate it. I liked the flavor of the onion, but I didn't really care for the little bits of it in the pancake. Also, I think maple sausage would be wonderful in these! Oh, I just realized I didn't sift my dry ingredients; I skipped that when reading the recipe. It didn't seem to make a difference; they rose nicely.

Recipe Group Selection:  21, March 2015 ~ Delicious and filling! We had these pancakes for dinner, along with fried potatoes, over-easy eggs and orange juice.  The batter is very thick, but it rises beautifully when cooking.  I made a half-batch and it made 15 nice size pancakes.  We have 9 left over breakfasts this week. I liked adding the sausage and onions to the batter.  It really made for a very hearty pancake.

This was great. We had two kinds of sausages and added some grated cheese.  I recommend nice mustard, like dijon, as a topping.

Quite good halved recipe added 1 blended apple it was a great way to use up a half a pound of pre-cooked sausage and some leftover bacon and it's very substantial and makes a meal in and of itself. Complimented with fruit 4.5 star my  wife said a 4 star and she would cut down on the onion a bit to savory for her.

Made for Recipe Group. These were just ok for me and hubby. The batter is really thick. I thinned it out some with milk. Thanks for the recipe.
