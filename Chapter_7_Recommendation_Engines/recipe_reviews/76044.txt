I had some almond paste that was about to reach expiration date. so, I decided to make little almond pastries. Instead of making my usual Frangipane that uses ground almond I picked to try this recipe to use up the  almond paste. This Frangipane has very little almond flavor. The amount of  four sounded like a lot but I went ahead and followed the recipe exactly ! After the  deceiving taste, I went back to check the Frangipane recipe that I usually use for "Galette des rois" and it only calls for couple of spoons of flour !
I had to cover my pastries with sliced almond to enhance little bit the almond flavor
