HELPFUL TIPS THAT WORK: 1st, this recipe is the only one that my husband doesn't just LOVE, but brags to all his friends about coming over to try. lol It's so simple!  I always find that I have to bake it for 28 min, flipping it the last 5 minutes to help the dough cook inside (basically I cook until both sides are golden).  I've made this 50+ times & anything less.. the dough in the middle sometimes comes out uncooked which is embarrassing.  Also, it's best to not try to stretch out the pizza dough.  Just open it, stretch to only flatten it & use.  Making it too thin only breaks the dough & the pepperoni juices will leak out.  I'm always about adding MORE to things, but remember "less is perfection" in this case.  The more you stuff into this dough, the less appetizing it tastes.  Trust me, I've tried several times & it's the reason only "I" make it right in my family!  Just sprinkle the ingredients, roll it, and bake.  Adding some sort of italian seasoning really adds a nice touch.  We use ranch or marinara sauce to dip, and people are begging for the recipe!  UPDATE:  The frozen philsbury french loaf works wonderful w/this recipe too! Another poster recommended microwaving the pepperoni for 30-40 sec before cooking, and what a great idea! I then bake until brown on each side (as I mentioned above).

Great recipe. To cut down on the grease, spread your pepperoni in a single layer on several paper towels. Place in microwave for 45 seconds on high. This really gets rid of a lot of the fat.

This was sooo easy and such a big hit at our poker party last night (along with "bacon roll-ups II", also found on this site).  These two appetizers were the first to dissapear! In fact, many postponed their games just to get up and grab more! I had pizza sauce for dipping but hardly anyone used it!  These are similar to pizza pinwheels, but less greasy and more taste due to the different cheeses & meats! Will make these puppies again! It looks like your creativity has paid off Julie...thank you for sharing it with the rest of us!

Your invention is certainly appreciated by my family! These fall into two very important categories in my house: Quick and Tasty! For my NYE Appetizer Buffet I will be offering a dipping sauce to go with them. It, too, is very simple: a small can of tomato sauce, 1t garlic powder, 1t Italian seasoning, microwave on high for 6 minutes, stirring occasionally. Yummy!

This recipe is foolproof! Just took out the dough and layed on the meats and cheese. I did not degrease though I did get my meat/cheese at deli sliced thin. BE SURE TO ROLL UP ON THE LONG SIDE. I cooked it 28 minutes, it was lightly brown and perfectly cooked inside and out. No problems at all and easily sliced.

I made these for my Superbowl party and they were great...although I might have to change the name from "Jets" to "Broncos" Ha Ha. I used frozen bread dough instead of pizza dough. I also added pepperoni and bit of pizza sauce to the mix. I'm glad I took another reviewers advice and let it sit a while before I cut it because it worked out nicely!

These were great!  Served them at my nephew's birthday and they were gone in minutes. These are also nice for a quick lunch for the kids, with leftovers for a midnight snack! Pizza sauce on the side would be a nice addition.

easy and real tasty.  Fills you up!
I suggest letting the roll sit a few minutes after it comes out of the oven for easier slicing.

Thank you, Julie Anne, for sharing this one.  I had an hors'deouvres dinner party to go to last night and I made two of these. I assembled them in the morning and baked them just before we were to head out to the party, covered the "logs" lightly with foil, and sliced them when I got there. They were still hot and very, very TASTY!  This is a keeper.

Yum, I have been making a similar recipe for years.  We call is Stromboli.  I have always used frozen bread dough that I thaw and roll out.  This is much simpler.

Made these as appetizers for our weekly Saturday football marathon and they were a huge hit! Looked great, tasted even better! I did spray butter on the top and sprinkled with italian seasoning, basil and parmesan before baking. Looked great and tasted even better! Next time I may serve with marinara sauce for dipping :)

These were a hit at a super bowl party this year!  I made two and they were both finished!  I would reccommend removing the appetizer to a plate with paper towels after cooking because the pan is extremely greasy and can make the appetizer gross and soggy.  Another possibility would be microwaving the meat for a little while before rolling it up.  This is definitely a keeper though, thanks for sharing!

What a hit with the family and 20 some odd teenagers. I added Italian spices and added Ital. Saug which I cooked first and patted well with paper towels. The 2nd time I made these I rolled it like a burrtio (fold sides in then roll) it worked much better.

Thanks for a keeper,

Really good.  Made for Austin's birthday party and it was a hit.  Used frozen bread dough and probably needed to cook closer to 30-35 minutes.  Served with marinara sauce.

A go to recipe for me when I need a quick and easy appetizer! Per previous reviewers I microwave the meat for a few seconds to cook off some grease but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.

Always a big hit!  I leave out the salami (personal preferance) and double up on the pepperoni & cheese.  I also add italian seasoning to the inside and rub EVOO on the top of the roll then top with parmesan, garlic powder & italian seasoning! YUM!  Ignoring time and cooked to a golden brown, I've never had an issue with uncooked dough in the middle.

Everyone loved this! I made it for a holiday party and it was super easy and very tasty. I did microwave the pepperoni first to drain some fat as suggested. I used Pillsbury pizza dough and let it warm to room temp before using. I didn't use an dip and everyone loved it.

Simply gorgeous. I had some home-made pizza dough left and used it up on this. They were delicious. Chef Joy's tips were v helpful and they turned out wonderfully. I've uploaded a photo of the roll half cut as I would have liked to see what it looked like on the outside when it was ready (to be sure of when to take it out). Hope it helps someone. My fussy OH was raving about them too - and he doesn't rave too often!

Thought they were pretty good and both kids and adults liked them.  I did flip it over for the last 10 minutes of cooking, and it turned out perfectly.  My cook time was closer to 35 minutes.  I liked that you could make this recipe earlier in the day and just pop in the oven before serving.  Will make this again.

These were great!! I brought these to a party and everyone loved them!!!!  I cooked it right before we left, then put the loaf in a cooler, and covered with aluminum foil.  I cut it when I got there.  It was cooked all the way through and I think waiting to cut them helped with that.  I also microwaved the pepperoni for 25 seconds on paper towels to remove some of the grease.

I didn't measure the amount of cheese or meat I used, I just piled it on and rolled.  The cheese ended up oozing out all over but it was very tasty

Yum! These were so good! Microwaved pepperoni for a few seconds, used pepper-jack & mozz (that's what I had on hand). Added Italian seasoning, sprayed outside lightly with olive oil & sprinkled w/ Italian seasoning & parmeson. Really good! No dipping sauce needed. Thanks!

DELICIOUS!  I made a double batch for 6 people and they were all gone by the end of the night.  I followed the recipe except for 2 tips that I got from other reviewers.  First, I de-greased the meat before layering on the bread dough.  I put a single layer of slices on a paper towel on a paper plate and topped with another paper towel, then microwaved on high 30 seconds.  It took me some time, but I went through about 30 paper towels worth of grease so I think it was worth it.  Second, I baked a little longer than instructed.  I went a full 30 minutes at 350, then I turned the oven off and left the bread in the oven until my guests arrived (about 10 minutes).  The rolls were fully brown and crusty all over and the insides were perfectly cooked.  I sliced them up right away (no cooling time) and they were perfect for eating.  These were great, easy (except or de-greasing the meat), and so pretty on a plate.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

I made a vegetarian version of these using provolone, shredded cheddar, onions, kalamata olives, and mushrooms.  I used Pillsbury french loaf as another suggested and brushed the top with olive oil and topped with Parmesan.  Came out tasting great, but the top popped wide open 10 minutes into cooking.  I didn't flatten the dough too much and didn't overstuff, so I'm not sure what happened.  Will definitely make again though.

Salty (but expected) and EASY to make.  We enjoyed them, but not insane about them.  Sauce to dip would've been nice.  Potential to put anything in these.  I too cooked for 25 minutes and flipped for 5.  Mine was cooked fine, no unfinished dough and it cooked crisp, not gooey on the bottom.  I'll make again for sure.  Thanks.

This was soo easy! My father in law loved it. I added a little pizza sauce ( don't add to much or it  will be soggy). Next time I will add roasted red peppers and peppercinis!

..These are great after school snacks...really quick and easy! I have started adding a little of my pizza sauce before layering the meat and cheese, then bake until crispy brown on the outside. I usually don't slice them right away.  Just let it cool, wrap and refrigerate until needed (I do my baking in the morning so this method works well for me).  When the kids get home from school I just slice, put them back on the cookie sheet and broil until crispy good..Thanks Julie :)

YUM! My whole family couldn't believe that I made them. My dad said they tasted like restaurant quality. The only thing I did differently was I sprinkled italian seasoning before sealing up. Thanks for the recipe, they were a hit!

I've made this for several parties and it is always a hit!  I use Turkey Pepperoni which cuts down on the grease.  I also use the shredded 6 cheese Italian Blend instead of just the mozzarella.

This was a fabulous recipe..very easy to throw together & even my pickiest eater loved it.  This will definitely be in the regular rotation at my house, the only thing I'll change is to replace one of the meats with a milder one such as ham since this was a bit spicy for my youngest.  Other than that...it's perfect!

used pills french bread dough rolled approx the size of a small cookie sheet, thinly sliced salami, fresh mozz, ragu traditional sauce, turkey pepp, oreg, salt, pepper, garlic salt, flipped halfway thru cooking like another reviewer suggested and it was PERFECT as appetizer for dinner party.  Needs to rest 10 minutes because it is very hot.  i don't usually rate and I was impressed.

Simple, fast, and popular. These went fast, and were an excellent addition to my hot appetizers for our housewarming party. I was busy, so my daughter followed the recipe, along with the tips I gleaned from these reviews; and they turned out perfect. Tip #1, Heat the pepperoni on paper towels in the microwave for 30 seconds or so to remove the grease. Tip #2, Follow amounts exactly. Do not overload.

Excellent!  I made a double batch for a party, using the pizza dough in a tube for one batch and pre-made dough from the bakery for the other.  Both were delish but the tube dough was far easier to work with.  I did nuke the pepperoni as suggested to remove some grease and I guess that worked because my rolls weren't overly greasy.

Excellent. Great flavor and VERY simple!! I also followed one reviewers advice and microwaved the pepperoni on paper towels before adding to the dough so it wouldn't be oily and greasy. I also brushed olive oil & sprinkled some garlic powder on top of the roll before baking. I also let it sit for about 5 mins or so before slicing it. It cut very easily. Will definitely make again.

Very simple recipe for party food!   Also very easy to tweak and customize.  For a recent open house I made the pizza roll in the recipe, and also tried a ham and cheese roll for variety, and both turned out great! :)

These were great!  I followed the recipe exactly the first time using the french bread dough that was suggested by another reviewer-delicious!  After the first roll, I decided to double the mozzarella cheese and tried the pizza crust dough-also delicious!  We preferred the taste of the pizza dough a bit more but the presentation was better with the french bread dough as they held their shape better.  I also microwaved the pepperoni for 30 seconds and blotted on paper towels before rolling as suggested and it worked great to prevent too much grease.

Glad I tried this...better than just making plain ol pizza on a refrigerated pizza crust! Had no provelone so just used mozza and it was fine.  No problems with it being greasy.  As per other reviewers, put it seam side down, added some pizza sauce on top of meat (not too much), and baked for 28 minutes (used Pampered Chef stoneware, and it turned out perfectly golden brown).  Let it sit before cutting for sure.  Served with warmed pizza sauce for dipping.  Very nice change of pace and good for kids, mine always pick off the cheese and they didn't seem to notice it in these.  As for the person who said the ends were just bread...they are, but just butter them and eat like hot buns or dip in the pizza sauce...still good!

WE LOVE THIS!  My kids ask for it every week!!  I double the recipe and serve it for dinner.  I do not de-grease the pepperoni as some have said but I buy my pepperoni from the deli which turned out to be cheaper and taste better so maybe it is not as greasy.   I don't have a problem with the dough in the middle not being cooked nor do I have a problem with the dough being too thin when rolled out like some have had problems with.  My only complaint is that the end slices are pretty much just dough.  I tried to remedy that but even that didn't work, so I guess it is just a loss .  I found that it rolls better if you get your meats sliced very thin from the deli.  I also add mushrooms and onions in one for the adults.  But the point is that we LOVE it!

I get requests for this appetizer nearly every weekend during football season.  It's fantastic.  The only modifications I have made are to sprinkle some basil, oregano and thyme on the dough before adding the fillings and to gently baste it with olive oil after rolling but before baking.

These are easy for a potluck or laid back gathering (kids loved them).  I did microwave the pepperoni on some papertowel and others are right - less is more with this one.  Served with a good pizza sauce from a local restaurant.

Very good!  We don't have salami and subbed sandwich turkey meat instead.  I made a taco pizza and used that dough for this instead of using storebought pizza dough.  It's very tasty as written but I could see adding a little bit of seasoning like minced garlic or italian seasoning would make it just as good.  I didn't microwave the pepperoni as some reviewers suggested and I kind of wish I had.  However, when I took it out of the oven I put the loaf on a cooling rack then put the rack on top of my cookie sheet to allow the pepperoni oils to drain away.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is by far my most successful appetizer. It is incredibly easy and adaptable.  I like to use a variety of meats: peppered salami, cappicola, etc.  I have also made a vegeterian version using roasted broccoli, red pepper, onion, and mushrooms, which was just as good.  If you haven't tried this one yet you need to! You won't regret it.

We all loved these.  I used the ingredients I had on hand, so ours included browned crumbles of Italian Sausage and a bit of spaghetti sauce, along with the cheese.  Covered the entire loaf with generous olive oil and topped with parmesan.  So, so yummy!

Although I prefer to call these "STEELER SWIRL PIZZA APPETIZERS" I give these 5+ stars!  I followed the advice of an earlier reviewer and microwaved the pep. for 15 seconds first.  I cooked them on a jelly roll stone to save my oven from drips.  I recommend preheating the stone while preheating the oven.  I cooked 2 on a stone for 25 minutes, flipped them and cooked them for an addition 8 minutes-as suggested by another reviewer.  Otherwise, the dough was not done.

I JUST MADE THIS LAST NIGHT FOR A PARTY OF ABOUT 30 PEOPLE.  IT WAS A BIG HIT.  SEVERAL PEOPLE ASKED ME FOR THE RECIPE.  I USED OLDANI GENOA SALAMI WHICH IS THE UPPER END PRICE WISE BUT TASTE THE BEST BY FAR.  I HAD A LITTLE TROUBLE GETTING THE DOUGH TO STAY IN THE SHAPE I WAS ROLLING IT IN.  IT KEPT SHRINKING BACK TO ITS ORIGINAL SIZE.  MAY HAVE BEEN A BAD BATCH OF DOUGH.  I AM NOT QUITE SURE.  I WOULD MAKE THIS AGAIN.

I've made this several times but I've added some pizza sauce to the crust before the toppings since my guests have commented that it was great but a little dry.  Also, don't be afraid to experiment! I've also made to other flavors: chicken, bacon, ranch and  buffalo chicken using diced small chicken, bleu cheeses and franks red hot sauce. I can't wait to try a taco one:) Finally, I always bake mine at 365 for  40 minutes, turning over 1/2 way through. It turns out done throughout and great on the outside every time!

A perfect appetizer for a few parties we've had.  I like that I can double it and it still fits in the toaster oven.  Very popular.  I like that it doesn't have sauce and is therefore less messy.

Made this today expecting something great.  This did not turn out at all.  The dough was not done in the middle despite cooking it longer and covering it with foil once the top was brown.  Also, there was way too much cheese, and I am a cheese lover. Perhaps my provolone cheese was sliced too thick or something. But I would definitely cut back on the amount of cheese.  Putting the meat in the microwave really cut down on the grease, so that was a great idea.  I have made much better pizza rolls.  If I make this again, I would cut the provolone cheese, and maybe cook at a lower temp for longer.

Fabulous!  I made these for Superbowl and they were gone in 10 minutes flat.  I only got to eat on slice, but it was heaven.  Marinara to dip it in too.

I've made this several times and it always gets rave reviews.  I line a plate with paper towels and place the pepperoni and salami in single layers then microwave for several minutes to wick away excess grease.

This was a hit at our New Year's Party.  I followed another reviewers suggestion and cooked the pepperoni in the microwave first to cut down on the grease.  These were gone in minutes.  I cooked for about 30 minutes, but covered the roll with Aluminum the last 8 minutes to prevent burning.  I wanted to make sure the inside dough was well cooked.  Be sure to roll on the long side.

Follow everyone's suggestions. Don't stretch the dough, don't overfill, microwave the pepperoni first and drain the grease, cook for a few more minutes (I do 28 like one user suggested) and flip during last 5. Serve with marinara sauce. Perfecto! Great Sunday Football snack for the guys!

I also microwaved the pepperoni on paper towels, which I thought was a great idea to get rid of some of the oil.  And I flipped the roll in the oven when it had about 5 mins left to bake, as another reviewer had suggested.  Everybody loved it.  Thanks so much for the recipe.

I made this for a party recently.  It was so easy to make, I got lots of compliments on it, and there wasn't any left at the end of the night.  I followed a few of the suggestions by others....added a thin layer of marinara sauce.  I used salami and ham because that is what I had on hand and added a little parmesan cheese.  Toward the end of the baking time, I brushed it with a little olive oil and sprinkled it with corse garlic salt.  I was so glad I did because it was a pretty golden brown color and had a little extra flavor.

I've whipped this up for several 'appetizer' parties.  It's easy and quick to make and always disappears.  I do serve with a side of pizza sauce for dipping, although it tastes great plain.

These were great! My husband made these. He, too, put a thin layer of pizza sauce before the meat, and brushed some EVOO on top of the dough before baking. Suprising flavor for such a simple recipe.

These are very easy to make, but it cooks very unevenly, with the dough on the outside crunchy and the dough in the bordering on uncooked. As I sliced the roll, I found the center-most slices very difficult to cut because the dough was softer in the center.

This was a really easy recipe that turned out to be very tasty! My fiance loved it.

Instead of the salami, I used sausage because that's what I had in the pantry and it added a whole new flavor to it.

Loved this. Super easy and was quite impressed with it! Very tasty.  I used only provolone ( simply b/c I had no mozzerella on hand). Fantastic. I will make this again. I also used The Pampered Chef stoneware and it was wonderful.

This is very similar to a recipe I had lost and was very happy to find this.I had the deli slice the salami very thin and had no trouble rolling this or having too much grease.

These were a huge hit with my family! I had to cook it a bit longer but we really used alot of stuffing. The center was a bit gooey but no one seemed to mind. I think next time I will lower the temp a bit and increase cooking time.

These would be great packed in a lunchbox.  I will try the other suggestions and try different lunchmeat/cheese combinations. 

Thanks!

while the taste was really good, it did seem the pepperoni made it really greasy and the pizza crust didn't get fully cooked inside...i'm wondering what i did wrong? next time i think i might switch to thin sliced pepperoni from the deli and slightly precooking it and also wrapping the roll in foil after 20 min. to let just the inside cook.

Great appetizer that can be made ahead and tossed in the oven when you are ready. You can add anything pizza toppings you want in these and they always come out perfect!

These are awesome! We like to have them for a simple weekend lunch. I usually just use provolone and pepperoni, and we dip them in warmed marinara sauce.

Nice and easy, I might try to mix up some of the cheeses to see how it can spice it up, or put some herbs on the crust so it bakes and has a bit more of a kick to it.  But a very nice base recipe!

These were delicious little appetizers and my guests ate every last one! As others suggested, I microwaved the pepperoni prior to use to cut down some of the grease – great idea! I also sprinkled a bit of Italian seasoning over the mozzarella- yum! Thanks for a great recipe! I will absolutely make again!

My husband was pleasantly surprised at how yummy this was.  I added some finely diced green peppers and onions, and baked at 375 degrees vs. 350 degrees.  I will definitely make this again!

Yum.  The only change I made was subbing diced ham for the salami and I used turkey pepperoni.  I over filled it so it wasn't easy to roll, and it definitely wasn't pretty!  But no one complained as they were scarfing it up.  Not a crumb remained.  I assembled it the night before and it baked up fine 24 hours later.

These were alright.  My sister in law rolled them (and I think the wrong way) so they were quite thick and bready.  The concept is great and I will try to make them again.

This is a great recipe to experiment with. I chose to following many of the suggestions listed. I used fresh pizza dough from my local supermarket. I placed the pepperoni in the microwave for 15 seconds to reduce the grease. I also added pizza sauce (tomato sauce with 1 tsp garlic powder and 1 tsp italian seasoning) before I put the meat on. I also sprinkled a little olive oil on top before I rolled it up. More olive oil went on the bottom and top of the roll. I have one of those oven that cooks everything faster than the recipe states so it only took about 20 minutes. I served this for dinner with a salad. My family loved it and there is enough leftovers for lunch tommorrow. I will make this again, next time trying vegetables.

I used fat free salami, low fat turkey pepperoni, and reduced fat provolone (but regular mozzarella)... Had marinara sauce to dip... it was great! What I should have done was add more filling and roll it tighter, but it still tasted wonderful!  My boyfriend kept saying it tasted exactly like one of his fave appetizers at another restaurant, but less fat!

These are just so yummy! They look beautiful too. I did 2 rolls and used just pepperoni in one of them and pepperoni and salami in the other. Served them with ranch dressing and pizza sauce for dipping. These disappeared very quickly at our party. YUM!

This was really great.  I took the advice of microwaving the pepperoni to eliminate some of the grease and that worked very well.  I also added some crumbled sausage to the recipe and added fennel and basil before rolling up.  I cooked two of these on a single cookie sheet sprayed with cooking spray for 50 minutes at 350 on the middle rack-seam side down.  One thing I highly recommend is brushing the tops with an egg white wash to acheive a shiny surface, otherwise the top looks dull and dusty. I also let these rest for 20 minutes before I cut them.  I used a bread knife for ease of cutting.  These were really good and I will serve these with pizza sauce although I don't think they really need it.

Really good recipe.  Quick and easy, for when my husband has "the boys" over at the last minute.  The only thing I recomend is baking it until all the dough on the outside of the roll looks done, then raising it off of the baking sheet.  I use my cooling racks to do so.  Since the pepperoni and salami are naturally greasy, it leaks out of the roll.  I do not like mine just sitting in the grease.  Also, they have always taken longer to bake for me.  The inside is never completely done at the instructed time.  But I keep making it again and again.

This is a fabulous appetizer! SO quick and easy to make (I followed a previous suggestion to microwave the pepperoni for 30 seconds to get some of the grease/fat out of it ahead of time), and everyone loved it. I'll definitely make this again! We served it with pizza sauce, which definitely was a great addition!

Eh, it was good. For some reason I was expecting an explosion in taste. I'm giving it five stars because it shouldn't be faulted for my expectations. It produced everything promised from ease to impressing  those who saw it. I do suggest you take away some grease by microwaving the pepperoni on some napkins.

Delicious and easy.  Added about 1/4 cup more mozz and cooked for about 30-35 minutes to be sure inside dough was cooked.  Other than that, no changes needed.

Very yummy. I made them for a family movie night and we dipped them in marinara. I did, however, completely forget to add mozzarella. =) oops Everyone loved them. Will make them again.

These were good.  Made them just as the recipe directed and didn't have any problems with grease or underbaking.  Served with pizza sauce to dip them in.

I thought these were awesome and extremely easy to make in a hurry.  I didn't find them too greasy as the others did but I only had a 3 oz. package of pepperoni.  We also warmed up simple canned pizza sauce to dip them in.  I would think it would be easy to substitute different ingredients, i.e., ham, sausage, mushrooms, etc. but I agree that you MUST keep the ingredients to a minimum or it will be difficult to roll and seal.

Found this to be too greasy. Also don't think about adding more ingredients than called for -- it will be too difficult to roll up.

I made this recipe for one of my boyfriend's movie nights...8 people showed up, and these didn't last long!  I made two batches...one with just pepperoni and cheese, and one with just crumbled sausage and cheese.  I also sprinkled a bit of garlic powder and oregano on the dough before layering on the toppings.  I served them warm with heated pizza sauce.  They turned out magnificent!  I will definitely make these again...great party food!

I made these for a sunday afternoon while we were watching videos. They were simple to make and wonderful. The next time I will serve some warm pizza sauce on the side for dipping. Kids loved these.

This was great! The store was out of refrigerated dough, so I had to use a mix. It worked well! I served pizza sauce on the side for dipping, but I thought the taste was better without the sauce. This is so easy!

Very easy to make, easier than I thought it was. The recipe itself is fine, but I recommend being a little choosy in the dough you use. I used Pillsbury Pizza Dough that comes in the tube. Next time I'll either make my own dough or if in a hurry I'll grab the Pillsbury French Bread tube. I cooked mine for about 33 minutes before it seemed golden enough.

These were a hit for New Years! I was careful not to stretch the dough too far so it wouldn't tear.  I used a bit extra mozz cheese.  Baked 2 on the same cookie sheet so cooking time was increased.  They were perfectly cooked through to my amazement- I thought for sure the middle would be doughy.  I did microwave the pepperoni on paper towels for 30 seconds to cut down on the grease and it worked perfectly.   Delicious and simple!  Some ate theirs plain and others dipped in Boboli pizza sauce.

These went so fast I couldn't get a picture!! I baked for 30 minutes on a stone slab. I didn't flip. I let it set for 15 minutes before cutting. The inside wasn't "done" but it wasn't raw. I think it was perfect. I didn't have a nub to throw way. Every last bit was gone. 
I used both cheeses and only used turkey pepperoni for the meat. WE LOVED THIS ONE.

This is really good.  Use more cheese than other stuff and it'll be perfect.  Nice job on this one!  Definitely microwave the pepperoni for about 20 seconds and pat the juices off.

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and found by doing so they were just ok, but too dry. (I microwaved the pepperoni, and layered very sparingly) I think if I would have followed the directions I would have liked them better.

This does take a little time to make however your guest will be asking for this recipe.  I have made it several times and it is always a hit, be sure to watch your oven mine cooked a little slower than the recipe states.  Also heats up pretty good if you are going to be taking them to work or some place like that.  Can get a little greasy but other than that you will love them!  Great hit for parties!

I made these for a party and they were a huge hit, no leftovers.  I put a little pizza sauce on the dough before I rolled it up and also added some diced hot cherry peppers to give it a little zing.  these were awesome!

This was AWESOME!  I took it to a Superbowl party and everyone loved it!  This will be added to my appetizer favorites.  I followed other's ideas, spread a very small amount of pizza sauce on dough before putting meats.  I also microwaved the pepperoni and did not have a grease problem.  I did not use mozz. cheese as I felt the provolone was enough.  Brushed top with olive oil and sprinkled with shred parm. cheese.  Baked for 25 minutes, then rolled over and baked 5 more..perfect!

This was really good. I did microwave the pepperoni for a few seconds as someone suggested and it really works! However my oven must bake kind of hot because 28 minutes( as suggested in another review) was a little to long. Next time I will only bake for 20 -22 maybe I will let you know. This is however really good. Thanks the family loved it!

I made these for the kids at our party.  Funny thing is, the adults ate 90% of them!  The kids didn't even get a chance.  I sprayed the top with some olive oil and grated fresh parmesan over it.

This is ok.  It slipped apart a little bit when I tried to cut/eat it, even though I degreased the pepperoni in the microwave, and let it cool 20 minutes before cutting.  Probably won't make again.

This was a big hit at a party I had. The kids loved it! I didn't have any problems with it being greasy. I didn't seal it really well long the side thinking that some of the grease would drain out. It seemed to help, but the pan was a mess! It was worth the scrubbing. I used what cheese I had on hand (cheddar, swiss, and monterey jack) and the generic salami from the deli case. I think I will try with ham and swiss next.

Pretty Good but GREASY ! You know how sometimes you get a pepperoni pizza and you have to put a napkin on top of it to soak up some of the "orange" grease?
I didn't put in Genoa Salami and opted to put in all deli sliced pepperoni.
Made it last night for the Superbowl (Hooray for the Pats!) It actually tasted better to me COLD today for lunch !!

I make this all the time now. I have even varied the ingredients such as hame and cheese. Even made it as a breakfast dish one time with scrambled eggs and bacon. Great recipe thanks.

This reminds me of Stromboli. I boiled the meat a little to get rid of the oil.  I also added ham. Good recipe!

Yum!  Served this with homemade pizza sauce - blend a 28 oz can of whole tomatoes to a puree, then blend in 2 cloves minced garlic, 1 1/2 t. salt, and 1/4 cup olive oil.

This was pretty good although as someone else mentioned a bit salty but that's to be expected with the pepperoni and salami. I did brush the top before baking with olive oil and sprinkles pepper, garlic powder and parmesan cheese. I think next time I may add peppers and onions or even pepperoncini's for some added flavors and texture.

Thanks for this fabulous recipe!  Our family gets together on Christmas Eve afternoon so those with little kids and other families can be where they need to be that night.  We have hors d'oeuvres rather than a big meal.  I found this recipe while looking for something new to try, and it was a huge hit.  Everyone loved it from the little kids to the oldest grand father.  I made 1 with the pizza dough and 1 with Pillsbury french loaf that someone suggested.  I do NOT recommend the french loaf - it was still good, but did not work well at all for folding and looks.  The other one looked like it belonged in a magazine picture when it came out of the oven.   I cooked it for the 28 minutes that others recommended and cut it into bite size pieces to serve.  We think it needs some pizza sauce or marinara for dipping, but it was very easy and will be served at many future parties.  Thanks, Julie Anne!

these are REALLY good and very easy! simple ingredients. was a hit at our party last night. added some marinara for dipping. I did have to bake a bit longer as I was concerned the inside wasn't quite done. added about 10 mins and they turned out perfect. the side of the roll split a bit during baking but it really didn't matter b/c you're going to slice it up anyway. wonderful!

This is a neat way to serve pizza. I recommend adding a small amount of pizza sauce, otherwise it's too dry. I used a roll of pizza dough that was refrigerated, which was easy, but it is important that you wait at least 20 minutes after baking to cut. I made the mistake of cutting my roll too quickly and the cheese oozed everywhere and it was a mess! After learning to wait, everyone really enjoyed this unique pizza appetizer.

These were very good. I substituted canadian bacon for the pepperoni, because that is all that I had. I think that next time, I wouldn't bother with the mozzerella- and I would just use the provolone. I think there was too much cheese (and I LOVE cheese). I served them with a side of marinara sauce. People at the baby shower that I served them at kept calling them ham sandwiches though. Oh well- they were good.

These were good. I made one with the original recipe and one with ham and cheese. I took the advice of others and microwaved the pepperoni before baking to get rid of some of the grease. That seemed to help as they weren't greasy at all. These were also very easy to make.

Love this recipe!!  Tried it for the first time today, came out great.  I agree that it is on the greasy side, but I intend on trying different meats to cut down on the grease.  Thank you so much for sharing this one.

They tasted good but were very greasy.  The cooking time was also longer than that given in the recipe.  I don't think I'll make them again.

I made these for my NYE party last night and they were gone in a matter of minutes.  Very simple to make and the ingredients were things I normally have on hand.  My only complaint was that it was extremely greasy. Perhaps I used too much pepperoni, and that caused to the problem? They were delicious, regardless!!

Easy and delicious! I tried one with pepperoni (no salami for those that didn't like salami) and the normal cheese it calls for and I made another like the recipe with the salami but substituted a mozzarella and mild cheddar cheese blend that was on sale. They were both delicious! I also melted butter and brushed on top and cooked them about 3 minutes longer. When I make it next time (you know I will!), I will probably use the mild cheddar and mozzarella blend since it was so tasty! The only problem I had is that the dough always seems to tear on me even though I didn't try to stretch it. The tear made for a messy pan and caused a structural integrity issue (part of it fell off into the oven when I tried to take it out). What was left was still worth the minimal effort! So good!

This was good.  I added seasoning like the other reviewers suggested.   I used Pillsbury French Bread dough, which wasn't very easy to work with, even after leaving it out on my counter for 20 minutes or so.  I think I will try pizza dough the next time.   Microwaving the pepperoni ahead of time (like another reviewer suggested) is definitely a plus.

I did cook both meats on papertowel in the microwave first to cut down on grease. Also, I brushed the top with olive oil and sprinkled pepper and Parmesan on the top. The middle didn't get all the way done so I put that part back in oven wrapped in foil. It is way easier to cut if you let it sit for awhile.  I did not use dipping sauce. Most all of it was gone but not all so it was just okay.

I had to use some croissant sough so I made this recipe with it. Came out very good. I later tried pizza dough and now we can't decide which one we like more. Just like a stomboli. It's great. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

All I can say is, "Make 2 at a time!" These little goodies went fast. Had thought of serving some Marinara sauce on the side, but forgot to put it out. I don't think it was missed at all.

This was a huge hit with my monthly bunco group. The man loved it too. It pretty much disappeared rather quickly.! I was in a hurry and the store I went to didn't have the pizza dough, so I substituted with frozen bread dough.

SO SO SO GOOD!   We just made these tonight for supper to try them out before we bring them to a friend's house to watch the game tomorrow.  They were so easy and so tasty!  We did microwave the salami and the pepperoni and blotted with paper towels to get rid of some of the grease first, and we did leave it in the oven for about 32 minutes.  Other than that, we followed the recipe as written and had a salad with them.  Definitely a keeper!  But...we renamed it Patriot's Pizza Roll because we are Pats fans and the game tomorrow is against the Jets, and we didn't want any negative vibes! : )

Made with only cheeses since I didn't have any and had hungry kids to feed. Still tasted awesome, kind of like the cheese filled pizza crusts. Will definitely make again.

Great idea!  We've made several variations of this for parties.  I coat the finished loaves with melted minced garlic butter and also use use CHEF PAUL PRUDHOMME'S (R) Herbal Pizza and Pasta seasoning on top.

Easy and delicious recipe!  I used the exact ingredients, but followed other reviewers' tips, microwaving the pepperoni before baking and then baking the roll for 28 minutes , turning over for the last 5 minutes.  Everyone loved it and they were all surprised. By the simplicity go the ingredients.

I made these for 3 different Christmas parties and everybody raved about them..and the best part is that they are so simple to whip up and easy to make more than 1 of them. I do de-grease the pepperoni in the microwave and I use the amount of cheese that the recipe calls for, maybe even a little more and I don't think there is too much cheese at all. Thanks for a great and simple recipe.

These were amazing!  Both kids and adults loved them.  I would highly recommend microwaving the pepperoni to de-grease it.  Great party food!

Very good, quick, easy recipe.  I brought 2 to Thanksgiving as an appetizer in addition to stuffed mushrooms.  The guys in the house ate this up very quickly and asked for more.  I served with a side of pizza sauce, but it was so tasty as is, most of the sauce was left untouched.  This will be a great quick meal for my meat-loving husband in the future.  I might experiment with other ingredients as well.

So easy and fun.  My 3 yr old son, helped me put all the ingredients on the dough.  For picky eaters, it's a good way to show them the fun in making food which encourages them to try new things.  Such a simple idea, that once you do it you see how many different ways you can change this up and use various fillings in the future.

Oh yeah, these were great.  Made these as appetizers before a basketball game and everyone was eaten.  They were even better with a marinara sauce for dipping.  This is a keeper!
