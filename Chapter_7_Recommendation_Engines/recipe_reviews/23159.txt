This is a nice recipe, but you'll need a 1/2 cup of parmasean cheese instead of the 1/4 c listed (1/4 c for the ziti mixture and another 1/4 c on top).  When assembling the dish, distribute 1/2 the cream sauce over the pasta on the bottom before adding the layer of meat sauce (then add the rest of the pasta and cover with the rest of the cream sauce).  I find that at least a 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon in the meat sauce gives the dish a more traditional flavor, although in reviews of other versions on this site suggest it is challenging to those having it for the first time.

This is an authentic and wonderful recipe, and I have been making it for years.  It is out of Tess Mallos’s The Complete Middle Eastern Cookbook.  A really wonderful Middle Eastern Cookbook.  At the end of this recipe in the last part of the instructions she has, “Sprinkle remaining cheese on top” but she left the amount out.  It is 1/2 cup.

This is delicious!!!  My Mother-in-law who is Greek has been making this for years and everyone loves this popular Greek casserole!  I made this for dinner last night and she said that it was excellent!  I thought that was a great compliment coming from a Greek!  Everyone loves this, even my picky husband and teenage son and they are always looking for any leftovers.  My son requests this and now I can make it myself just like Yiayia's!  I used Muellers ready cut ziti pasta.  When assembling I mixed all of the pasta with the meat sauce and poured into the pan, then topped with the cream sauce.  I sprinkled the top with fresh ground nutmeg.  This definately is worth the effort and everyone does love this dish!  This is a family favorite and I will be making this often!  Everyone should try this dish!  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

I was impressed how much this tasted like pastitsio I've ordered at Greek restaurants - very authentic. It does take a long time, but it's worth it. And it smells fabulous!

I did make a number of changes - Reduced the amount of Parmesan cheese and egg added to the pasta at the beginning (didn't miss it); Added cinnamon and nutmeg to the meat (highly suggest doing this); Increased the amount of garlic added to the meat (my MO for almost every recipe); Used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth and used dry parsley instead of fresh (didn't notice either change); Added feta cheese to the cream sauce (I have no idea if this made a difference, just following a reviewer's suggestion). I also followed a reviewer's suggestion and tossed half the pasta with a little bit of the cream sauce and tossed the other half of the pasta with the meat sauce. Then first put the cream sauce-tossed pasta in the dish, then the meat sauce-tossed pasta, and finally the rest of the cream sauce. Came out great (seemed like a logical suggestion to me, thus why I followed it).

I really enjoyed this dish. I didn't add the broth, added water instead. The other thing that I did different was that I put the noodles in the pan, added the butter, and cheese with the egg and mixed it up. I then added the beef mixture and topped that with the bechamel sauce. Just like my mother used to make. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Pastitsio is one of my favorite baked pasta dishes. My husband made this recipe for us a couple of months ago. It's not my favorite version; I found the cream sauce way too starchy and pasty. I also thought tossing the pasta with butter & parmesan made it a little too heavy and rich-tasting. I prefer making a cream sauce using feta cheese, and tossing half the pasta with that; toss the remaining pasta with the meat sauce (like another poster, I also recommend using ground lamb or half lamb, half beef). Layer the cheese-sauced pasta in the bottom of the baking dish, top with the meat sauce layer, and spread the remaining cream sauce on top. Sprinkle with more crumbled feta and bake. [The version I like courtesy of the Gourmet cookbook].

I never heard of pastitsio and I am not Greek at all- but I was having a party and someone recommended this off of the community board as a good dish for a large crowd.  Well I am glad I made it-sooo delicious.  I used the meatloaf mix(beef, pork and veal) instead of all ground beef and used only 1/2 of a large onion and 3 cloves of garlic for the meat sauce.  For the cream sauce I did use 2 cups milk and 1 cup heavy cream-hey it is a fattening dish already-why not completely clog the arteries! And made the rest as stated-although I did forget the final sprinkle of parmesan cheese at the end-oops no big deal.  Made the night before and just  cooked the next day and it was so worth the efforts.  Lots of compliments and lots of people wanting the recipe.  THANKS!

I wanted a meatless meal, so I subbed a pound of mushrooms for the ground beef- and it was FABULOUS! We will definitely make this often.

I made this recipe using ground lamb instead of beef and added 1/2 tsp of allspice and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.  The rest of the ingredients were exactly as printed.  My family throughly enjoyed this meal, even my son-in-law who is not fond of casseroles let alone lamb!

This was good.  The positives were that I had all the ingredients on hand; although it was time consuming to make, but not difficult at all; and it fed a crowd.  I received compliments, but not the raves I was hoping for.  I liked it, but wasn't blown away.  My husband said it was good, but not to bother making it again.  Considering how decadent & fattening this recipe is, it would have had to be amazingly delicious for me to justify wanting to make it again.  I was seeking a recipe that for something "different" to do w/ ground beef.  I did find what I was looking for in that respect.  Thanks!

This is an OUTSTANDING recipe! I rated it 4 stars because for my family of picky eaters who like pasta or casserole-style dishes extremely flavorful and cheesy, I slightly increased all of the seasonings by 1/2 and the parsley by 1 TB, added 1 tsp. of cinnamon & a 1/2 tsp. of allspice to the meat mixture and increased the cheese by placing 1 cup of parmesean in the ziti mixture & about 1/2 cup in the middle on top of the meat layer.  I also substituted beef stock for the veggie stock because that is what I had on hand.  However, I followed the rest as written and turned out PERFECTLY.  The dish was golden in about 40-45 minutes at 350 and my husband can't stop raving about it! He is requesting it for the Super Bowl! Thank you so much for the recipe!!!

This came out pretty good. It took quite some time to prepare. Although it was okay I doubt I will make it again.
*update* This tasted so much better the next day, much more flavor. I think I will be making it again when I have the time

Fantastic recipe!  I think the cinnamon is key to the authenticity of this dish, which is the only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars.  I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the meat mixture, and a sprinkle in the cream sauce.  But the dish itself is easy, even though it's time-consuming, and everyone enjoyed it.  I will definitely make this again - it will be great for feeding large crowds.  I did make the following changes, strictly out of necessity:  I used skim milk, and light margarine instead of butter; I didn't have wine or paste so I for the paste + wine + broth, I used tomato sauce with vegetable boullion mixed in.  I expect wine would be better but the dish was great even with my forced modifications.  This recipe is a keeper!!

Good basic recipe...We would give this a 5 with these changes: Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to meat mixture. I used a bit more tomato paste, and 1 tsp. salt. I am going to add a bit of tang next time also (lemon?). Also parmesan cheese (1/2 cup or more) mixed into sauce is crucial. Feta would be good in this too, somewhere! Whole wheat noodles were not so good in this; stick with regular =). Served with Greek salad topped with "Absolutely Fabulous Greek/House Dressing" (scaled to nine servings) on this site.

I made this per the directions and other suggestions of adding the 1/2 cup of parmesan on the top and the only problem was the "salt to taste" part.  I tried to be somewhat sparing and as a result we had to add salt to it when eating.  Also, the restaurant where we have had it puts a tomato sauce over it and as soon as we took a bite we realized that without that it was just okay - nothing great on its own (somewhat bland).  But, with the addition of some decent tomato (spaghetti) sauce w/basil and some salt this is very tasty.  Next time I'll add more salt and garlic and remember the sauce!

This was a really good recipe. My red wine was a little too strong and overpowered the meal, I will try mixing in 1/2 water the next time.  The meat sauce tasted so good by itself that I will use that as a base for pasta sauce, or even in sheperd's pie.

It's pretty good!  I did add a touch of cinnamon to the meat sauce, and I think another time might mix the pasta with the sauce instead of layering (the pasta on the bottom got a bit crunchy).  It's crazy filling - our crew of seven ate half the casserole.

This was really good! I had to make some changes but it still turned out well! I didn't use as much onion (husband not a fan), no red wine, & water instead of vegie broth (didn't have it on hand). The noodles, however, were a little too hard & chewey on the top. Not sure what could be done since I think it is just due to them being in the oven.

Delicious!  OK mine probably wasn't authentic.  The recipe is very forgiving in case you don't have some ingredients or make changes.  I didn't have wine around so skipped that, and added cheddar to the bechamel to make it mornay sauce.  Yummmm.  It tasted even better the next day as reheated leftovers, if you can believe that!  Also, this would be a good recipe to add 'hidden veg' ala Anabel Karmel (add to the meat sauce).  Enjoy, this is a keeper!  (PS you probalby don't need the butter called for in the meat sauce.)

After all of the rave reviews I was expecting something awesome.  I was a little disappointed that after all of the hard work it was a little bit boring. I had never had it before though, so maybe my expectations were out of whack.  It was good.  It just didn't knock my socks off.

My husband loved it. So did my son, who is finicky. I've never made this,so I compared recipes and actually had to combine this with the Pastitsio IV recipe. The only thing I actually measured was the formula for the bechemal. Everything else I just did to taste. I actually added the nutmeg, some cinnamon, and a dash of all spice. Instead of red wine, since I had none, i found some red wine vinegar in the pantry threw in a dash of that. For tomato paste I had some Ragu, and in place of vegetable stock I used chicken stock. I added fresh plum tomatoes instead of the canned in the other recipe. Had no parsley, but upped the oregano from the other recipe. I used alot more parm then this recipe called for. And there was a flaw in how many egga to use, since you tell us to use eggs twice but in the recipe you only told us to have three eggs. So when you called for the eggs the first time, I put all three in. But, this recipe was the base for what I did, between the two recipes, it came out great. You have to put the bechamel on the bottom portion too like one of the other reviewers stated.

Very tasty, and something we will make again. Halved recipe since there are only 2 of us. I added a pinch of mace, (no nutmeg on hand), in place of nutmeg, and used a bit of this and cinnamon to the meat filling. Only used 8 ounces of the pasta-I used mini penne for the ziti, but used full 1 1/2 pounds of lean mean. Upped the sauce to 2 Cups for 4 servings and glad we did. Sprinkled 1 cup of finely shredded Montery Jack cheese on top layer of pasta before adding cream topping.  My husband, a former cook, loved it as well, but suggested I combine the pasta and meat layers as a time saver, adding 1/2 Cup of the cream sauce there, then the remaining 1 1/2 Cups as the topping.
Also used 1/4 teaspoon of Penvey's Pasta Sprinkle to the cooked pasta, (wanted some oregano flavor) in lieu of salt.

My three little girls will eat anything with noodles so I thought I'd try this for a change.  Though it was not quick to prepare, it wasn't really difficult either.  It went over great!  They all loved it and even said "Yay!" to leftovers the next day (the real test of a recipe).   I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly, not dry at all.  Next time I might add the whole can of tomato paste for a different flavour and a little more seasoning in the white sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

The flavor was almost identical to what you would find in a Greek restaurant. I left out the red wine because I forgot to pick some up, and it still tasted perfect. Also, I will be doubling the topping the next time I make this.

I thought this dish was only OK.  I halved the recipe and added a touch of cinnamon; otherwise I followed the recipe precisely.  The dish was a little dry, and some of the pasta poked through the sauce and turned out chewy.  In fairness I should say I may be biased since I have a great memory of this dish from my childhood.  This dish didn't taste close, but I'm not sure what it's missing. If I were to do it over, I would reduce the nutmeg slightly and add 1/2 cup more sauce.

Fed this to a bunch of friends and they loved it, too.  One whose mom is Greek asked that I add a bit more nutmeg and cinnamon.  He pronounced it "perfect and authentic"!!

This dish is worth the time and effort.  I found it to be flavorful and filling.  My family enjoyed it, although my 6 yr old was a little "iffy" towards it.  It's quite time consuming, but I wanted to make something different for dinner.  I will probably make this again, but it will be a while before I do.

I have made this recipe 3 times now and every time it has been a hit with my family and friends.  It is full of flavor and is great for leftovers the next day or more.  One change I did make was to the meat sauce.  I added a little lemon juice and mint to it after the first attempt and it really brightens up the dish.  Great recipe and fun to make.

I have used this recipe dozens of times.  Every time I make it - an enormous success.  You do not have to be Greek to love it.  It does take some time to make, so I always try to do it on a weekend when I have lots of time and don't feel rushed.  The recipe ingredients call for 2T of olive oil, but it's not included in the directions.  I am guessing it is intended for adding to the boiling pasta water.    Simply delicious!!

Not bad. I have been making a slightly different, slimmed down version of this for years. The only differencse between what I make and this are that a) I use no egg in my white sauce (so it's not really a "true" bechamel), b) I sub Romano for Parm (it has a much sharper flavor, so I can use less of it), c) mostaccioli noodles instead of ziti (and I use no egg or cheese to bind my pasta & d) I make an entirely different meat sauce. While I enjoyed this, my version is a tad better, MUCH healthier and takes less time to prepare. Because I wanted to try "authentic" pastitio, I only made a few changes. For one, I halved this (I was only feeding my hubs and I). Other than not adding an egg to my bechamel sauce, my only significant deviation was how I prepared my meat sauce. I didn't follow this recipe at all and instead used the one I've always relied on. I brown a medium onion and a lb. of EXTRA lean ground beef, drain and then add a small can of NO SALT ADDED tomato sauce, a touch ea. of cinnamon, nutmeg, oregano & s&p and fresh chopped garlic to that. I cut out a lot of fat & calories by doing this and STILL enjoy a rich, indulgent dish. Served w/ green beans, garlic bread & rice pudding for dessert. When the craving strikes, I'll stick with what works best and splurge elsewhere. Thanks anyways, ALKHATIB.

Good, but not like the one I'd enjoyed in a Greek home for 4 years. Made as directed, adding some cinnamon (authentic!) and leaving off the Parm at the end because I didn't have enough. I also used macaroni as that is what i had on hand, but of course ziti is the real way to go. The one I've had has slightly less tomato-y-ness to it and the cinnamon is more prominent (I don't think that version has nutmeg though), as well as the cream-y layer is twice as thick.

I made this for Christmas Eve dinner at the request of my daughter.  My kids are half Greek and both love Greek food made by their late YiaYia.  I have taken up the traditon but I am not Greek so I am happy when my food passes the "YiaYia" test. Everyone loved this.  A very yummy, filling and economical dish.  Served it with Greek salad and crispy bread.

OMG! This was awesome!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY except adding a dash of nutmeg to the beef while it cooked as well, and I didn't add veggie broth becasue I didn't have any, but it didn't need it.  And I used 1/2 n 1/2 becasue I was out of milk.  This was exactly what I was looking for. AWESOME!

This is a great pastitsio recipe.  My only beef with it was that there is a lot of liquid in it that bubbled over into my stove, burning onto my oven.  I'll use a bigger pan next time.

This was better than the Greek Pastitsio that we had at our local Greek Church 2 weeks ago.  My kids liked theirs so much, they asked me to find a recipe online and make it at home.  I had all the ingredients called for (except I didn't have quite enough red wine, so I used what I did have, and dumped some burgandy cooking wine in as well)  

I will DEFINATELY make this one over and over.  Rumor has it that his is actually better the second day - you make it and cook it, let it cool, leave it in the fridge, then the next day - heat it in the oven.  I'd try that - if there were any left  !  Next time I'll make a double batch, and try freezing one batch.  Definately a hit recipe here !

I know that every greek thinks their family makes the best pastitsio or moussaka or sponakopita (or insert recipe title here) but I was not thrilled by this one at all. This recipe is tasty but not authentic at all.  Itis less of a pastitsio and more of a lazy lasagna.  Any pastitsio that does not call for cinnamon is usually a bit off.  As I said, it is a yummy dish more or less but I believe misses the flavors of an authentic pastitsio.

I had Pastitso at a restaurant and just had to come home and make some.  I did notice, the restaurant version only had the pasta on the bottom.  I followed this recipe exactly.  Next time I will make more bachemel and put all of the pasta on the bottom.  I found that the pasta on top, soaked up much of the bachemel.  Not really what I was looking for, though still tasty.

Fantastic - my wife said it was better than the pastitsio in Tarpon Springs, FL and the local place just across the river, both of which are authentically Greek!

Overall, quite tasty, but there are some alterations I would make to this recipe in the future. I found the dish to be lacking the nutmeg flavor, and using freshly grated nutmeg makes quite the difference. Additionally, the meat sauce was lacking in flavor and was more liquid-y than I was expecting. In the future, I would add additional tomato paste. Freshly grated pepper at the end is a good addition  as well as freshly grated nutmeg, as cooking decreases the intensity of the spice flavor.

Excellent recipe of Pastitsio, I as many other viewers added cinnamon just not the same without it.  I also used a Merlot as I didn't have a dry red wine and it still turned out awesome!

This is 5 star for the following reasons: I didn't change anything except for adding a little cinnanmon, it is unique ground beef recipe, and it is a delicious make ahead meal.  So yummy!  Next time for fun I would use ground lamb and simmer the beef mixture for as long as possible (to let flavor absorb).

This was so good!!!!! My husband said he could eat it once a week. It was delicious!!!
I used mini penne pasta and it worked fine.
I also used ground lamb meat since it was all I had and it was a nice compliment to all the flavors. I am sure greeks would approve. =)

This was as good as the restaurant version I have had and would give it 5 stars if I was more into greek food.  Be prepared to put in a lot of time and coordination for good results.

3 eggs was too many to mix in with the pasta. I would guess that 2 would be enough.

Overall, it was a good recipe.

I made this recipe tonight and had three friends over for dinner.  Everyone except my two year liked it so I'd consider that a success. In the directions there was no mention of the olive oil that was listed in the ingredients so I just added it to the ziti.  Also, I sprnkled 1/2 cup of parmesan on top like another reviewer suggested.

This was really good.  I'm giving it 4 stars for a couple of reasons.  One, this is a pretty time consuming receipe.  Also, I used a lot of pots!  My family liked it, but said it was a little plain.  They put Frank's Hot sauce on it and they gobbled it down.  I will make again, but not one you want to make if you are running short on time.

I recently went to a greek food festival and ate Pastitsio and fell in love. I did several recipe seasrches and choose this one because it had great reviews. This dish was much easier to make than anticipated. I only lacked one ingredient, Red wine, so i supstituted with white cooking wine. it turned out great, however I will be purchasing red wine to make this next time. One of the best casserole-type dishes i have ever made. This one will definatly be saved and passed onto friends and family!

The flavor of this recipe is perfect and absolutely worth the effort!  My kids even gobbled it up and labeled it "yum."  Next time I will thicken the beschamel only a bit (or add a little more milk), as I think the final pasticcio cooked up a bit dry this time.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I found this recipe to be a good starting place and customized it to my taste: doubled the tomato sauce, halved the custard, increased the nutmeg and omitted the oil/butter on the pasta.

I used penne pasta.  This recipe took a lot of effort, maybe because it was my first time making it.  It tasted pretty good, but I probably own't make it again.

If your inexperienced in the kitchen, keep looking for a recipe to impress, this is a real toughie.  At least I thought so.  It was absolutely excellent though.  Oh and don't make this on a weeknight, it took me quite a while.  But don't worry this is totally worth the effort.

Flat top! the best part of pastitsio is cheesy fluff top- this was just a roue. Need to double the top recipe and add Parmesan cheese. Also add a pinch of cinnamon to the meat to be more authentic.

I cooked this recipe today. Overall, it tastes good but I will make changes. I will not add Bechamel  to the meat sauce. Skipping that step will give the beef a more intense tomato taste. Rather than ziti, I will use regular noodles and arrange them evenly in the pan. This  way, the Bechamel will rise properly giving the Pastitsio its traditional layered look.

I had this recipes for more than 20 years from the original Tess Mallos cookbook. I always get rave reviews whenever I cook it.  My son begs for it. The only change is that I make more cream sauce and add it to the bottom layer. It's heavenly.

Made this exactly as written and was very disappointed. It was bland, eggy tasting and dry.  I think the main problem was too many eggs that are mixed with the pasta.  Even if you used less eggs I'm not sure that would help with the overall flavor. Just seemed to be missing something.  The cream sauce on top was OK though. Sorry, will look for another Pastitsio recipe elsewhere. :(

To make this healthier, I substituted ground turkey for the ground beef; and subbed olive oil for the butter (and used less than called for) except for in the cream sauce.  In the cream sauce I used butter, but I halved the ingredients and only put it on top - I did NOT put any in the meat sauce... again to keep it healthier.

My husband is Greek and he said this recipe tasted very much like his grandmothers recipe. I agree that it needed more Parmesan cheese but over all it was good and made enough for a lot of people. Will make it again soon.

This was very good and not hard to make. It was a big hit with my family. I made a few additions (thus the 4 stars and not 5). I added cinnamon and cloves to the meat sauce. The cloves made a big difference. I added goat cheese to the cream sauce because I thought it needed a little extra kick. Otherwise, great!

I always make the recipe exactly as written the first time before starting to make changes.  I would have given it 5 stars if it hadn't had the mistake in the directions about the cheese.  However, I also see no reason to cook the onions first instead of just cooking the ground beef and onions together. The meat needs a lot more seasoning as it required a lot of salt to add to the flavor when eating. I'll make it again and do some changes and see how it goes.  The family loved it.

Very good! The bechamel sauce is very creamy on top. I do make just a few changes:
1- I use ground lamb
2- add ½ teaspoon ground cinnamon to the meat sauce
3- add a tub of crumbled feta cheese to the bechamel
My husband loves this! I do 2 8x8 pans and freeze one prior to baking so we can have Pastitsio later!

Liked the flavor,  but used gluten free, corn based pasta and it ended up tasting more like corn bread. Better if use normal, or perhaps rice based pasta

After reading the reviews, I also added a touch of cinnamon to the meat sauce, increased the tomato paste per my taste, and mixed the sauce with the pasta. Then layered half pasta, half sauce, remaining pasta and topped with sauce and Parmesan cheese. Thanks for a delicious recipe.

I really liked this recipe. My family is Greek and having just come back from Greece where they ate it up, I decided I had to give it a try. Big hit! The few small changes I made to the recipe are the following : I did add a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the meat sauce.  I followed another reviewers advice to add about 1/2 a cup of the white sauce to the meat sauce, which I think worked well. This left me a tiny bit short of white sauce on the top so I made half the recipe again so I wasn't skimping on the top. Other key change I might make is to buy the Greek pasta brand Misko's Macaroni no.2 which is a long cylindrical pasta which the Greeks use to make this dish.

I enjoyed this recipe unfortunately my family did not. it is a different flavor profile that they are not used to. i put cinnamon in it to make it more authentic.

I really enjoyed the recipe and would have given 5 stars if I didn't have to make it once first to find out all the adjustments to make it a five star recipe.  I found one pound of pasta for 2 layers of in a 13x9 lasagna pan was not enough. I found the traditional pasta in a Greek grocery store, which looks like long zitI about 10 inches long. One pound of that only made 2 layers of pasta for my base, so I had to cook another pound. Since I knew I was using a 13x9 pan, I started out with a pound and a half of meat because I wanted to have a real 'layer' of meat. I started out with the recommended quantities of nutmeg, cinnamon, but kept tasting it and ended up doubling and even tripling so it would taste Greek and not like Italian sauce. Used lots of garlic too, and used Veal for my meat.  I made the recommended quantity of bechamel, but the next time will make 1 1/2 the amount because it barely covered the top. Used double the parmesan. (parmigiano Reggiano) These quantity changes will fill your 13x9 lasagna pan to the top. I made my sauce the day before and the rest the second day. This actually is more time consuming than regular lasagna because of the additional bechamel sauce, but it is a welcome change and tastes sooooo good, hence worth the all the bowls, pots and pans, especially when you have enough to share and freeze! Mine took an hour in the oven to cook to a light golden brown on top, and made it a day before serving to allow flavors to marry.

Absolutely delicious! I added a little more nutmeg and some cinnamon, an additional egg, and subbed the wine and vegetable broth with just beef broth. It was excellent and worth the time it took to assemble. I'll definitely make this again!

This was a hit with my family. A nice alternative to lasagna. Very rich buttery flavor. I added some chicken better than bouillon paste to the bechamel sauce which gave it more flavor because it was a bit bland when I tasted. I will make  this next time I go to a potluck, as it is also very good at room temp.

Having been used to my greek grandmothers version, this recipe was a great foundation however I found the meet/cream/noodle proportions to be off and the meat sauce to need some tweaking. After having made it now 1/2 a dozen times, the authentic grandma taste came after having added a pinch of cinnamon and only 1/2 of the recommended liquid to the meat sauce, multiplying the cream sauce by 2 1/2, and sprinkling a sparse layer of parmesan on top before baking.

I was going to make baked ziti and saw this and was like what the heck I will give it a try. I am not Greek and have never had pastitsio before. I made it just as it was written. Not a hard recipe but just a lot of details. I made it for me and the boyfriend. He said it was OK and I didn't like it and I truly tried to. Its not bad just weird taste. I can taste that nutmeg. Its not disgusting its just an odd taste. Others should try but its not for me.

I, too, added more cheese (it's my Wisconsin blood.  I can't help it!), but this recipe is downright delicious and probably would be with less cheese.

I was looking for a new ground beef recipe. Considering it took an hour to prep this recipe & another almost hour to bake, I had high hopes for it. I followed the recipe as written, but was unfortunately not impressed. I enjoy flavorful foods, & this was extremely bland. My 2yo grandson loved it though, so maybe I'll freeze the rest in small portions for him. Won't be making it again.

This is exactly the same as Egyptian macaron bechamel.  Only difference we use 7 spice instead of nut Meg and ghee instead of butter.  Delicious!

Just made the pastitsio.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  I feel the meat could have been kicked up a bit as it could have been spicier.   Next time maybe a bit more nutmeg or a little cinnamon.
All in all, the family enjoyed their dinner.

I was excited to try this recipe as my husband is Middle-Eastern and his sisters' have prepared similar dishes.  However, I found this recipe to be bland.  It was a lot of work, a lot of calories and just didn't have the taste I was looking for.  My least favorite part was the cream sauce which I found to be too floury.  I followed the recipe as written.  I will not make it again but will search for a similar recipe with more flavor.

This was not an easy weeknight meal, and that 2 1/2 hour estimate is if only if you are a stellar multitasker with three burners going at once.  That said, it is so, so worth it.  Seriously the only pastitsio recipe I have made that tastes authentic.  It's a perfect cold weather casserole, impressive enough to serve company with a salad (Greek, of course!).  It actually tastes even better reheated, after the flavors have a chance to meld.

We used 1 pound of meat, penne noodles and whole wheat flour, extra garlic (as in all of my dishes) and omitted the veggie broth/wine in lieu of 1 cup of beef broth.  These changes were made based on what was on hand. We also added cinnamon to the meat. Following another reviewer, we layered noodles, meat, cheese times 2.  To say this was good doesn't begin to describe the dish. Truly fantastic, my husband ate so much he got a migraine (won't use the parm. Cheese next time). 9 year old had seconds. 12 month old ate it. I enjoyed leftovers for lunches. Will make again and again. Also, not as much work as some post as long as your organized going into it (have your items in dishes sectioned out)! Yum!

This recipe worked great! I've been obsessing over this dish since I first had it a few weeks ago. I definitely worked up a sweat making it but it was worth it. I wish I had kasseri cheese handy but the Parmesan worked well. So happy I tried it.

Just ok. Lacked flavor, and the béchamel sauce I found to be too flour-y. Definitely have made better pastitsio in the past with other recipes. Will not be using this recipe again.

This was delicious! My best friend from high school is Greek, and this reminds me of her mother's Pastitio. I followed the recipe almost exactly, although I used macaroni instead of ziti. I also ended up accidentally adding more nutmeg to the noodles and I was worried it would be too much, but it was delicious.

Made this dish for lunch today... I did have to add more milk to the cream sauce because it was too thick but this dish was delicious! I also didn't have shredded parmesan cheese so I used the parmesan powder and it was still very good. I layered it like someone had suggested with cream sauce on the bottom layer of noodles, then meat sauce, another layer of noodles and topped with cream sauce.

This got mixed reviews at our house. I didn't want to waste half the can of tomato paste, so I used it all, and I'm glad I did. I think it needed either even more nutmeg or I've used another recipe that also had cinnamon. My boyfriend also asked that I add red pepper flakes to the meet when cooking next time. I also used macaroni, but that was personal preference. I also didn't read the other reviews before cooking, so I wasn't sure about the additional cheese to sprinkle on top, so I just added some parm!

Lovely!  My husband and I loved it.  I roasted the vegetables.  I thought this was a bit light on the eggplant and zucchini, so I'll add more the next time.

I gave it 4 because I changed it up a bit. It was sooo delish. Here is what I changed. For the pasta: I did not add the olive oil and added a little cinnamon. For the beef: I used a combo of pork, veal and beef. I used less union added some cinnamon and used a large can of crushed tomatoes (with garlic, basil) instead of the broth. I used white wine instead of white and omitted the parsley and used Italian seasoning. I put 2 Bay leaves in and let is simmer for about an hour. For the Bechamel sauce: I added a dash or so of cinnamon. To assemble I put the pasta on the bottom, then some  Bechamel sauce; then the meat sauce, then the other half of pasta and then the Bechamel sauce. It was sooooo good! I used a deep dish so it was nice and thick.

I made this without adding any meat since I occasionally like to serve a meatless meal and my husband really enjoyed it.  I didn't have any ziti pasta on hand so used spiral noodles instead.

Loved the bechamel portion.  Only rated it a 4 because it really does need cinnamon.  I added some, but not quite enough to get that flavor.  Also recommend selecting a good fully bodied wine.  Good instructions and although time intensive, its easy to make.  Thanks!

This was good, but not as good as pastisio I have had at greek restaurants.  It needs A LOT of seasoning.  I added extra garlic, oregano and some others and it still was not enough. For how fatty it is, it really should taste amazing.  Also unless you have a family of 6 make sure to half this recipe.

Oh boy, oh boy!  This was fantastic.  We followed the recipe exactly and were not disappointed.  There are only two of us, so we ate this for two dinners and two lunches, and never got tired of it.  It just kept getting better.  Loved it!  Thanks for this recipe.

Great recipe!  My husband is Greek and we have a favorite restaurant that makes the best pastitsio and this about as close as I can find!  Only change that I made was to change the nutmeg to cinnamon.  The authentic dish calls for cinnamon, that's one of the signature tastes, so I just subbed in cinnamon for nutmeg.

Very good recipe. However, if you're not a fan of nutmeg it would be a good idea to omit it altogether. I will make this again minus that particular seasoning. I did however add fresh oregano (dried is fine too) to my meat and it really enhanced the flavor.

Like the previous review stated, this recipe is only missing cinnamon. My husband is Greek so I made this for him and with the cinnamon added it was a huge hit. We both LOVED it. It gave us leftovers for the rest of the week too!

A good recipe... will definately make this again.  We are following a low sodium diet, so I reduced the sodium in the following way... used  unsalted butter, didn't add ANY salt (used Mrs. Dash table blend), and instead of a pre-made vegetable broth I used sodium free bouillion, water, and more Mrs. Dash.

This is delicious. A little time consuming, but well worth it when cooking for company since so much of it can be prepared at a time. It also keeps well and makes a lovely lunch for me to bring to work the next day. My Dad ate thirds and fourths the last time I made this. It is now one of my most impressive meals served with Greek Salad and Baklava as dessert. A good winter time meal, and cheaper than moasaka since you need to buy eggplant, and I can't always find eggplant at my grocery store. This is def. a recipe I have made more than once. Thank you!

This was very tasty. Reminded me of mousaka without the eggplant. Next time I would like to drape it with aluminum foil while cooking because some of the ziti got dry and hard. Other than that, it was great!

This was an excellent alternative to my own baked ziti recipe.  I added quite a bit of cinnamon to the meat sauce, taking a hint from other reviews, and it had the most unique flavor.  When hubby says "you've gotta make this again", it's a keeper.

I didn't have ground beef on hand, so I subbed in mild Italian sausage and used beef broth instead of vegetable broth for the meat sauce.  I also topped this with 8oz of shredded mozzarella.  My husband loved it-very flavorful and well worth the effort.

I've never had this before, so I can't comment on its originality, but the cream sauce on top was not my favorite. I liked mixing it in with the meat sauce, but I won't put it on top again. Other than that I liked it.

Very good! I mixed the meat and noodles together rather than layering them and added some cinnamon and nutmeg to the meat mixture. I also substituted olive oil for the first two sets of ingredients instead of butter to make it a bit healthier.

Excellent recipe. Our 13 by 9 in. pan was a little too shallow, so we ended up using two pans, the 13 by 19 in. and a 8 by 8 in. and just made thinner layers. We baked it for just 35 minutes.
Even so, it was delicious. Best served with broccoli rabe and a sharp Reisling.

I liked this dish a lot -- thanks for the recipe. I did make some changes to the sauce -- did not use vegetable sauce or tomato paste, but instead used an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce which was pre-flavored with basil, garlic and oregano. Increased wine to one cup. Didn't use the parsley or garlic. My 6-year-old thought the dish was "OK" but my 10-year-old loved it and my husband liked it quite well.

This was good pastitsio.  My husband loved it, but neither of my kids would touch it.  I didnt really expect that they would though.  Nothing wrong with this recipe, other than I added cinnamon to my meat..  and im not entirely sure about the taste of wine in the sauce.  Im still looking for my perfect pastitsio recipe.  Thanks Catherine!

yuck.  made this to the T and found it to have very little flavor and just did not excite me or my family.  did not like the topping- something about it just did not sit well with me.  I couldn't even get my daughter to put it in her mouth.  will not make again.
