I used this recipe for my first try at bar-b-que ribs and found it easy as well as delicious!  My kids loved it. I took others advice and used half as much red pepper and it seemed spicy-but just the right amount of spice.  It was loved by the guests we had over for dinner (both from Louisianna) I will definately be making this again!

The idea of boiling the ribs in a homemade "cajin boil" before grilling save hours of actual "cook time."  Marinating and putting on the grill for that short period of time, my guests thought that I had spent hours on these ribs.  The best part?  They loved them!  If I hadn't grabbed a few ribs for myself, there wouldn't have been any left.

Depending on how your Cajun Seasoning is made, you may want to eliminate the salt completely.  Otherwise this was a fantastic recipe

These turned out very good. I followed the advice of the reviews and just left out the seasoned salt and worcestershire completely. My boiling pot didn't quite fit the full amount of water and I had to cut my ribs in half. Worked great. I parboiled ahead and refrigerated in the sauce for a few hours so it was nice for company. I served this with homeade iced tea,  jalapeno cheddar corn muffins, french fries in the turkey fryer, creamy broccoli slaw, and ice cream with strawberry rhubarb sauce. Fun party.

These are interesting if you love the strong flavor of salt.  Garlic SUPER SALTY Ribs would be a great name for these.  I am not one of those who doesn't like salt either.  Save your ribs.  The cooking directions were great.  The flavor was nothing but salt with a hint of garlic and BBQ.

Way TOO salty! In the boiling part it is okay but I would completely eliminate Seasoned Salt from BBQ sauce mixture.(especially if your cajun seasoning has Sea salt in it).  My husband is a salt-a-holic and it was even TOO salty for him.

This has become "my go to" rib recipe.  One thing I do is add a little beer (nothing too bold) in place of some water while boiling

Use a salt free Cajun seasoning, but watch out for MSG, if you don't want it. Then maybe add Sea Salt to taste instead of so much iodonized salt. Maybe add just a little of your chosen salty seasonings at a time until it tastes right. Be careful in your choice of bbq sauce too. Hidden salt and/or MSG builds up and can ruin a wonderful recipe like this. I love salt but come on....I like to use a Zatarain Shrimp boiling bag in the water and Mrs Dash for a salt free zippy seasoning on the ribs. 

My brothers say that precooking ribs in any way is a sacrilege to good bbq cook!
They cook them in a heavy duty covered pit for hours (Like four)with wood chips pre-soaked in soapy water and then drained and wrapped in foil(the chips, not the ribs!) just above smoking temperature. You have to be very careful that the fire doesn't get too hot or go out altogether. Way too much work for me, but then I'm a "wimmen". Bon appetite, chers.

PS once you get the bbq ribs right, try these tips and eat them right out of the boiling pot! Just simmer them in seasoned water until tender, about twice as long. Throw some corn or red potatoes to the mix but add a little more salt because both of these veggies soak up the salt.

These ribs were amazing!  The only change I made was omitting the salt.    The cajun seasoning had salt in it already.  Will definitely make again!

Very tasty way to prepare ribs--parboiling allows them to remain moist. Using prepared products makes it very quick. Um, um good!

This will be my way of preparing ribs from now on!I usually make a rub and bake for 3 hours at 250 degrees and then on the campfire to finish. These are really good and so simple. We used country style ribs. Very tender and full of flavor with a kick! I am anxious to try this sauce on chicken! Thanks!

These were terrific!!! My hubby and I have NEVER made ribs on the BBQ before, so this was our first attempt...they came out perfect!  My 2-year-old son even loved them (he likes food with a kick at his age, go figure!).  We followed the recipe exactly...and we only had to grill the ribs for 15 minutes total (around 7-8 minutes per side).  We will definitely make these again...maybe even for a picnic or at-home party!

Loved this recipe! Normally when I cook ribs, I typically boil for about 1 hour and these weren't the best looking ribs I'd ever seen, so a bit tough.  I only had enough Cajun seasoning for the boiling so I used my Pampered Chef Smoky BBQ rub with the sauce and the sauce was incredible.  The teenager in the house that HATES any BBQ loved the sauce & has requested again.

This is a REALLY TASTY sauce!  After reading other reviews, I knew I had to knock out some of that salt.  I used full-salt seasonings as called for during poaching, but I made salt-free 'seasoning salt' and salt-free Cajun seasoning for the sauce.  The taste was PHENOMENAL!  I think I chopped more garlic than called for for the sauce, but it was perfect!  My other problem with this recipe is I do not like the cooking method.  I like my ribs tender and falling off the bone, and these did not come out that way at all.  I have the best luck doing ribs low and slow in the oven before finishing on the grill.  Thanks for the great sauce but the simmer method just isn't for me.  Made for Western Region Allstars Faceless Frenzy July 2012.
