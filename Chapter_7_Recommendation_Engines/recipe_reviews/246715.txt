This recipe for larb was very simple compared to others.  I did have to tweak the lime juice and fish sauce a bit, and added some Thai chilis that had been soaking in fish sauce. Very good and love the simplicity!

These were good but the one thing I will add next time is a drizzle of sesame oil and some chopped water chestnuts for added texture.
