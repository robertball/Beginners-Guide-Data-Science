Very good garlic taste.  I was looking for the garlic sauce that they use on shawarma which is a little thicker than this and has less lemon zing.  It was too much lemon for me, so I added a bit more salt to combat the zing.  Next time I'm going to try it with about half the oil and less than a quarter of the lemon juice, with salt to taste.

This is fantastic, just like LaShish.  I recomend using a blender, it did not emulsify when I used the food processor. I also use canola oil instead of EVOO

I was looking for a recipe that duplicated the garlic sauce from Zankou chicken.  This was great!  Next time I might substitute 1/2 of the olive oil with canola, the sauce had a strong olive oil taste.  Served with grilled chicken, lamb, tabouleh & pita bread.

I have been looking for this garlic recipe for a while now.  I love it.  A little less lemon and maybe a bit more salt.  I didn't use all of the olive oil either.  Great with chicken, lamb, hummus and pita.  I put it on everything.  The taste of garlic will be with you for several days.

I love all lebanese foods and I love anything with garlic so for me this was out of this world.  This is very garlicky so you can tone it down to your taste to maybe 4 small bulbs.  Like previous reviewers, I cut down on the oil a bit.

This sauce is great on everything: fish, chicken, vegetables, bread. Sometimes I cooked the meats with the sauce, other times I topped the meats with the sauce after cooking. It makes a great sandwich spread too. The only change I made was 2 cups EVOO instead of 3. Because I find EVOO to have a very strong taste, I used 1/2 C of the dark green EVOO, and 1 1/2 C light EVOO. This was a big hit with friends and guests.

Although I'm giving it 4 stars, it didn't turn out for me, it was too runny, not think like it should be- but maybe I didn't do it right, I'll try it again because the flavor is good.

Yowza!  This is strong, esp if your garlic comes in large heads as mine do!  I make this in much smaller proportions becuase a little goes a long way, and serve it with kofta, roti, and a cucumber/dill/yogurt sauce.  It's so strong that it's spicy, and it will leave a taste of garlic for awhile.  If you love garlic, you'll love this -- otherwise, beware!

Mine came out a bit watery.  I would lessen the amount of lemon according the taste and texture next time.  I would also add about 1 cup of mayonaise.

I made this in a much smaller batch, for just two people.  Used more garlic, less lemon juice, in proportion, and added some black pepper.  Used a Magic Bullet and it turned out beautifully.  It definitely needs to go for a few minutes, but turns out fluffy and looking almost like humus.  For those who said it turned out runny - you did not process it long enough.

I love garlic sauce! Growing up, my best friend was lebanese and her Dad got me hooked on it! This recipe is similar to his but not quite, and therefore not quite as good (in my opinion) I used less olive oil and instead of sticking it in the blender, I used a garlic press, makes things chunkier and more flavorful. Yumm! My sauce turned out perfect, but since I didn't follow the recipe perfectly I can't give it five stars :)

I roasted the garlic first which mellowed the flavor. Also reduced EVOO to 1 1/2 cups and added 8 oz. of plain Greek yogurt. Added some freshly ground black pepper, too.

Its a good recipe but an aweful lot of each of the ingredients. Considering a little bit of this stuff goes a long long way.  I think this what may make the consistency people are looking for, difficult to achieve. If you want to stick to this recipe and are searching for that consistency then I would try boiling 3-4 small potatoes and adding them to the mix(skinned and blended of course). Adds a nice touch without sacrificing flavor. Oh yeah, NO MAYO!!!!

Wow!!! If you want a garlic hit then this is a sure way to get it! Excellent recipe and surpsingly easy to make.  We drizzled ours over french fries, topped with chopped ham (or bacon) bits and sprinkled with grated cheese, then popped into a hot oven for about 10 minutes until the cheese melted............

This sauce was EXCELLENT but was a bit runny - I'd cut down on the lemon a bit just for the consistency. I only used 1.5 C of oil. My daughter (who isn't a big garlic fan) even loved it. :)

This recipe was a good base to start with.  I didn't want as much sauce, so I cut down on the ingredients.  I used mostly canola oil and a little olive oil ,but next time, I think I would just use canola.  I also cut down on the lemon juice and still found it a little too lemony.  I used salt to taste and added a lot more garlic, since my husband and I LOVE garlic - the more the better!

I tried to only make a third of the recipe but all I got was a runny, overly lemoned, nothing like the garlic sauce I wanted sauce.  I ended up adding some sugar and oregano and using it for salad dressing since I didn't want to throw it in the trash and it was really good that way.  Sorry, maybe I did something wrong since it seemed to work for so many others.

Must have done something wrong. Made a huge mess as the sauce kept spurting out the top of the blender. I tried to keep the hole mostly covered while pouring the oil in, but it ended up on the window, the walls, the cupboards and me!

It just didn't emulsify (sp?) for me - although, I followed the directions exactly.  Very disappointed.  I tried many fixes, none worked.

As others say, I was looking for a less watery sauce. I remembering the sauce in Detroit, thick and full of garlic. But, this was really good as a 'dressing'.

I love all of the ingredients but this just didn't work for me as written. There was nothing "white" about it. I ended up with what looked like a watered down oil. In an attempt to salvage it I added 1/2 cup of Greek yogurt to the mix and that helped with the consistency but then changed the flavor. Sorry but I won't be making this one again.

Very tasty and simple - I love it with steamed vegetables (especially Broccoli), and even with Chicken...
