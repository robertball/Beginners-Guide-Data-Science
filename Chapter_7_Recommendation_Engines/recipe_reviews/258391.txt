6.13.17 This wasn t bad but it wasn t great either. It simply didn t have a lot of flavor. I did blend my oats first before adding the other ingredients as I always do with oatmeal smoothies and I did use a frozen banana. I don t like smoothies so icy or dense they re like a slushie but I also don t like them when they re so thin you think you re drinking a glass of milk. That was the case here even with using a frozen banana. Admittedly this is personal taste but if you want some texture to this smoothie go ahead and add some crushed ice to the blender. It was OK but I doubt I ll make again.

I blended the oatmeal to a fine powder before adding the rest of the ingredients. My banana was frozen and yet this was very thin. As far as flavor it was a bit too sweet for me.

Easy, healthy smoothie. Used flavored yogurt, regular milk, & added some ice.

Yes, I left out the honey, almond milk and just use 2% milk. I just use cinnamon, oats, banana with the 2% milk.   Peggy
