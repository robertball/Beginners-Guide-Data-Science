I make this in the crockpot about once a month. I use organic chicken broth and homemade taco seasoning. This can be easily made to stretch by throwing in a drained/rinsed can of corn and a drained/rinsed can of black beans. I like to top it with deep fried tortilla chips and a dollop of sour cream.

Very good, healthy.  I used homemade chicken broth and cooked chicken. Instead of a package of taco seasoning, I sprinkled a little sea salt, black pepper, chili powder, onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, cumin and oregano over the chicken broth.

I converted this recipe into a crock pot dinner that worked out great!  I boiled 2 chicken breasts (whole) until cooked (just a few minutes) and then added them to everything else in the pot, minus the cornstarch mixture and the toppings.  Then, it all simmered merrily all day long.  Later, I shredded the chicken with a fork and added the cornstarch mixture, turning the temperature from low to high for the soup to thicken.  I served it with shredded cheese and cilantro, like it suggests, but also offered Greek yogurt which, when stirred in, makes the soup nice and creamy.  I normally do a lot of complex cooking, but we have a new baby (!) so this recipe of can-dumping simplicity was PERFECT for a busy weeknight dinner.  Everyone really enjoyed it.  Thanks!!  Oh, P.S.--I also dumped in a can of black beans.

I Seriously can't describe just how good this soup is!  Not only is this delicious on it's own, you can add to, or take out, any of the ingredients that you may not have on hand and it will still come out AMAZING! I used home made chicken stock, some rotisserie chicken, a bag of frozen corn, a can of black beans, drained, and just went with it.   I did add in 3TBSP cornmeal that I mixed with water to use as my thickener instead of the cornstarch, to give it a nice corn background taste,and I also added in about 4 small corn tortillas that I cut into strips and just added into the mix.   I can only tell you that my husband can't stop eating it and neither can I!     When serving it, I put some corn tortilla chips and shredded cheese in the bowl, then added the soup on top of that.   I LOVE AVACADOS and since they were on sale here, I bought one and diced it up to add to the top of the soup.  I also added a dollop of Mexican crema to it, but my husband went with straight sour cream and LOVED IT!   It is truly HEAVEN on earth!    So good!   Thank you ladyw4kids!   Nice job!

This was the easiest but tastiest soup ever! I broke up tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl and spooned the soup over it. Added a blend of Mexican shredded cheese, and used my favorite green Tabasco sauce. I like it spicy! So good!

We liked it. I added a can of black beans to make it more filling, used more chicken because we needed more meat for our family, used Ro-tel which comes in 10 oz cans so I used two of them...etc. Little changes. I don't see why anyone would not like this if they like the ingredients. You can switch up the ingredients, add some extras, etc. and have a tasty, cost-effective meal on the table in minutes.

Really spicy but oh so good!  Family really enjoyed it.  They want to try it with shredded chicken the next time.  I don't eat cheese so on my bowl I put a dollop of sour cream. The kids also put some crunched up tortilla chips on top.  This is definitely a new family favorite.

I absolutely loved this recipe! As did the rest of my family!  The only thing I added was a can of southwestern corn and Heavy whipping cream, but other then that it is delicious just the way it is! Thanks for sharing!

pretty good, but will probably add my own spin next time.  (Enchilada sauce in the soup base, grilled corn, and make it a bit thicker)

I tried a couple of recipes for this soup and I found this recipe to be the best.  I actually just threw everything into the crockpot along with a can of black beans and about a cup of corn to give it a bit more substance.  When I got home, I took the chicken out and chopped it up and put the rest of the soup in a pot on the stove and added the cornstarch which thickened up the soup nicely. I added the chicken back in and served. I also put a few tortilla chips in the bottom of the bowl before I poured in the soup. I had available sour cream, cheese, chips and avocado for topping.  I will probably use a bit less taco seasoning next time as I am very wimpy when it comes to spice.  It was delicious and my skinny husband even had two bowls!

Even adding a can of chili beans, it still seems to be lacking something. But very good overall.

This was good, but felt like there was something missing in the flavor and I didn't really care for the texture given by the cornstarch.

Really good but a bit too spicy for my family.  We used a small can of mild ROTEL tomatoes and chiles.  Next time I would just use diced tomatoes!  Thanks for sharing!

Liked it but I put in some "Habanero Rotel" so it was a bit on the spicy side. Like the recipe and will make again. Great with Avacado.

I cooked the chicken breasts with the onion in the broth in my Instant Pot for 5 minutes. I shredded the chicken and added the seasoning, tomatoes and a cup of frozen roasted corn and cooked for another 15 minutes. I did not add the cornstarch. Topped with chopped fresh cilantro and avocado, it was great. Next time I’ll add black beans.

Excellent "base" recipe.  I add beans (black or pinto) and black olives when I have them. I find the best chicken stock to use is "Better than Boullion" and I make 1 tsp to every 2 cups of water to ease on the salt.  Substituted dry cilantro for fresh, as that's what I had on hand.  Served over tortilla chips with sour cream on top.  Yum!

This was the best taste for the least time in the kitchen! Followed the recipe, with three exceptions: I had a chicken breast and leg quarter already cooked so added this chopped meat halfway thru cooking. Added an additional 15oz can of diced tomatoes for added heartiness and needed to add about 1/2 tsp ground cumin to bring the flavor up. The heat level from the green chilies was perfect. Oh, and it didn't need the cornstarch at all. The soup was thick enough without it. We sprinkled fresh cilantro on top and my son stirred a dollop of sour cream into his. We loved it! Thanks for posting! We will have this often!

Everyone loved this.  I used fresh Roma tomatoes, took the skin off and mashed them.  I chopped a poplano pepper  and threw it in.  I am in Mexico now and can’t get the canned tomatoes and canned chilies that I like to use.  I shook in a little more cumin and served it with a bottle of green hot sauce so fokscould spice it up themselves.

So simple... but I used a crock-pot.  I added tomatillos and pureed the tomatoes, and added a jalapeno.  Had some leftover, frozen, roasted chicken thigh and leg, and threw it all in and let it stew for 2-3 hours (longer it will get better).  The chicken shredded like a dream.  Added the corn starch around the edges where it boils and it was perfectly thickened.  Next time I'm using sour cream, instead of cheese, and it could use a splash of lime.  The taco seasoning was my favorite part, made it so savory and delicious!

This was SO good. We are having very cold temps in our area and this warmed everyone. Made as written but added some zucchini and summer squash that needed eating. YUMMM
This was the perfect end to a day outside in the cold wind. Thanks ladyw4kids for a winner.

Wonderful soup.  I used rotisserie chicken and Bill Echols taco seasoning (on this site).  I also froze leftovers in individual portions to take to work for lunch. Makes a nice change from takeout

Added black beans and an extra cup of broth so it would use the whole box. It turned out great on a chilly day. We paired it with quesadillas to make it a meal.

Add some black beans, pinto beans, and roasted corn for some taste, texture, and more filling. Too with sour cream as well with avocado and then you have a real tasty soup.

Very good... I also added corn and black beans and the family opted for fritos instead of tortilla chips.  Also added in green peppers with the onions.  I didn't have the tomatoes with the chilis, only plain tomatoes and I know that made a difference, I will definitely get them next time.  I also think that I could add more of the taco seasoning.  I will definitely make this again.

This was such a flavorful, warm, delicious soup. I added a clove of minced garlic , I used a packet of hot and spicy taco seasoning and then cooked up some black beans and corn and added that too.... It was soooooo  good! I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this several times my family LOVES it. I make 2 adjustments 1. I add beans (kidney, pinto or white beans or all 3) and a small bag of frozen corn. I also simmer the chicken breast in the crock pot overnite  with finely chopped onion, celery, garlic & bell pepper. We live in the Midwest it's a great dish for cold snowy night.

Very good! I used my own homemade taco seasoning rather than the packet and added chopped green chili peppers because I only had plain diced tomatoes. Other than that, I made it as stated.  I could easily put my own spin on this recipe by adding corn or beans, or top it with sour cream, tortilla chips, avocado etc.

It's an okay recipe to start with, but there are a few things that I change. The first is that this is a recipe for tortilla soup that does not include tortillas of any kind, so I add some thin crispy tortilla strips when I serve mine. I also advise melting butter in the pot and cooking the chopped onions on their own until they're tender before adding the other ingredients. I don't quite like the flavor of the taco seasoning, so I've tried it with enchilada seasoning, fiesta chicken seasoning, and white chicken chili seasoning, all McCormick brand. The last change I make is that I stir in the cilantro toward the end rather than putting it on top, so that the flavor sinks in a little more.

I used a rotisserie chicken in the soup as well as added frozen corn and canned black beans for a heartier soup. Cheddar cheese and sour cream as garnish make the dish delish!

Easy and delicious! 
I browned corn tortilla (cut into strips) in a skillet and served on top, along with fresh avacado. 
I have also added corn and yellow squash, along with fresh  jalepenos for extra flavor. It's good either way!

Made this following the provided recipe.  I also took the suggestions of others and added black beans and corn, then threw some chopped up jalapeños in there to kick it up a notch.  

I crushed some tortilla chips and placed in the bottom of the bowl, then topped the soup with cheese n sour cream.  

I should also mention that any ingrediants that came with the option of being hot or spicy that I went that route...cause I like it that way.

This soup is amazing!  It reminds of a soup I would get at a local joint that closed down several years ago.

I may have made waaay too much, but that's alright...it'll get eaten.

I made no changes except a couple of squirts of chili sauce.  I used fresh avocado on top and sliced tortillas.  My family loved it except for the youngest who thought it was too spicy.  This was easy and fun to make and will definately be a favorite.

I love this soup! I honestly cannot get enough of it. I also drain and rinse a can of corn and a can of black beans and throw them in and also add about a cup of cooked rice.  I crush up tortilla chips and add them  to it along with a dollop of  sour cream and a pinch or two of shredded cheddar.

I love this simple and quick recipe.  I love the fact that it is one pot on the stove and no browning of the chicken first. My whole family enjoyed the soup that I made it again two weeks later.  I used low/no sodium tomatoes, a can of mild green chiles and added some chopped up corn tortillas to add even more substance. We served it with fresh sliced avocados on top and the Lime Flavored tortilla strips found with salad toppings.    I would bring this soup to a new neighbor or sick friend.  Good for all ages.

The slow cooker folks seem to have the right idea! Cooking this for the suggested time didn't give it the thickness that I wanted so I ended up letting it simmer on the stove top for a little while (stirring occasionally) and it helped a lot. I also added a can of southwest corn, a can of black beans, and a bit of enchilada sauce in with the chicken broth based on other reviews. I don't think this recipe would have been nearly as good without it unfortunately. The corn and beans added a lot of flavor and substance to the meal, and it seems like most of the 5 star reviews involve that addition. I'm giving it 3 stars for being such a good base recipe. I needed some comfort food after finals week and this didn't disappoint. Will definitely make again!

This was my first time making chicken tortilla soup and I must say I was impressed. I cooked the chicken in the crockpot with the taco seasoning and chicken broth and onions. After 7 hours on low I removed and shredded the chicken then added it back to the crock pot along with the other ingredients. I served the soup with Texas tortilla chips.

Made this tonight with some modifications. I added a can of black beans and a can of corn. I also used 32 oz. of chicken broth. I used tortilla strips on top and cut up some avocado. Easy and excellent!

I like this recipe and it is very delicious! I recommend adding black beans to make it a little more filling, and shredding the chicken. But besides that this recipe is wonderful!

Made it exactly as written except I shredded the chicken after simmering it in the broth. 
A great base recipe leaving open additions to taste like beans, corn, corn- meal, and cilantro. Also very fast!
1/8 cup of jar taco seasoning equals 1 packet of taco seasoning

Soups alright but it needed so much tweaking that it makes it into a whole different recipe. I needed something fast but I could have made something better in the same amount of time this took.

This has become a bi-weekly soup in our house. I usually double the recipe so my wife can take some to her employees at work the next day. The only thing I do different is to deep fry strips of corn tortillas to put on the bottom of the bowls and also on top as a garnish, and I also add a dollop of sour cream with the cilantro. This is a big hit with everyone!

Very yummy.  I made my own broth with water and bouillon cubes and my own taco seasoning mix with mexican-seasonings.  Browned my onions and lots of garlic before adding the broth and other ingredients.  Put tortilla chips in the bottom of bowls and topped with lots of avocado!  Could eat it every night!

Was not that good.  It was very spicy but not the rich type of spicy with an indepth flavor that I was looking for.  It is basically tomatoe soup with too much taco mix.

I had chicken tortilla soup years ago at a party and it was the best soup ever. I've tried making it myself from other recipes but, never could find one that tasted as good until now. Wow!! This was wonderful. After picking everything up from the store, I ran home to make this recipe. It smelled wonderful and the taste was out of this world. Thank you lady!!

My boyfriend made this for dinner tonight. The recipe turned out really well he added a can a white beans which helped it a lot, rather than adding a Mexican cheese blend we added Mexican cream which really made a huge difference and made it more versatile. If you can't find Mexican cream; sour cream would work really well too. I then put pepper jack on top of that because I love cheese.

This was very good and easy! A great week night meal that my kids even loved! I cooked the chicken first in taco seasoning then shredded. I did everything else according to the recipe and yummy! I will for sure make this again but I will probably add a can of black beans for some more texture.

Delicious soup and easy to make! I only used 2 1/2 lbs of chicken and it was still a little too much, so next time I'll try just 2 lbs. I like it a little more brothy so I only added about 1/4 the thickening the recipe calls for. The spice was perfect for my family...since I like it a little spicier, I added a couple of shakes of a hot sauce. I will be making this often for my family, we loved it!

This was quick, easy and yummy!  Added a can of corn and black beans and crunched up tortilla chips.  Definitely will make this again!
