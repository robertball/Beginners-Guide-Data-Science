These are DELICIOUS! I decided to make these because I was craving cinnamon rolls and had some extra biscuits in the fridge. These were a hit at my house!  Super easy to make and very tasty.

I followed this as written. I loved that they were easy to make and small. I did use flaky biscuit dough and rolled it rather thin. Enjoy! They are addicting!
