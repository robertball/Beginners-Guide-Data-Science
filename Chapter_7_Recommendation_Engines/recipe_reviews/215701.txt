These are great. But SUPER HOT!  I also cheated and cooked them in the oven. Turned out great. I also added garlic and onion powder to the cheese mixture.

My husband didn't care for the poppers.  Not just these poppers, he didn't like any.  I think they would be easier in the oven, as suggested by others.  I found them quite tasty and easy to do.  I opted to split the jalapeno to get the seeds and membranes out and then reserved a few jalapenos to use to mix with the cream cheese mixture.

I took this three *recipe to a 5 * by adding my own touch! doubled the parmasan,instead of chopping the tops I put them back on to help hold the cheese in,and precook the bacon about half way before wrapping,the bacon will still be pliable but will crisp up nicely on the grille!!

These were gone in a flash. My husband made me make them again the next day and I have to make them for his work this week. Easy and delicious:) 

I cut the jalapenos in half b/c my husband wanted more bacon per bite ratio. :) You also don't need a toothpick.

I made these at a tailgate, and everyone raved about them.  They were the perfect way to use up the remaining jalepenos from my garden before the weather got too cold.

These turned out great.  I wore gloves when working with the jalapenos and didn't have any problems.

For years I've wanted to make jalapeño poppers and I finally did today. In another recipe someone suggested boiling the bacon to lose some if the grease but I realized that you shouldn't because it loses taste also. Just use turkey bacon. It doesn't leave them as greasy should you choose to make them in the oven. ~Thanks~

I always enjoy these. A friend suggested adding a "little smokey" on top of cream cheese.  More filling and MORE fat...but delicious.

I scaled recipe to 6 servings to make appetizers for the 2 of us. I added a dash of chili powder and cumin to the cheese mixture. 

Instead of grilling the poppers, I baked them at 375 degrees for about 20 minutes. I wrapped about half of them in bacon -- they are good with or without. Overall, these were easy to make and delicious!

Fantastic.  But having a 'tray' to grill the jalapeno peppers upright I just stuffed the whole pepper.  Also rather than fussing with wrapping the pepper with bacon I added in real bacon bits I bought at the store.  The combinations of cheese really hit the spot.  And everyone that tried them liked that better than just cheddar that some recipes.

These were really good.  This was my test, so I just made half the recipe.

I took the easy way out and microwaved the bacon, crumbled it and mixed it into the cheese mixture instead of wrapping the bacon around each jalapeno.  I also just cut the jalapenos in half, cleaned out the seeds and stuffed them instead of doing the slivers.  I then finely chopped about 1/2 a jalapeno and mixed that into the cheese mixture.  I put on a sprayed grill pan on the grill for about 30 minutes.  Very Yummy-- grilling the jalapeno seemed to kill some of the heat so they weren't too spicy--just right!

I'm rating this a 5 b/c of the taste but I definitely had issues with it.  I some by cutting in 1/2 and others as the recipes states but either way, the bacon was an issue.  I cut the slices in half, which makes sense b/c a full slice would be too much.  But it didn't cover the entire surface of the cheese area and sometimes the cheese dripped into the fire.  I also didn't use toothpicks, which I will have to try next time.  As my boyfriend was grilling them at our tailgating party, I was taking the bacon off of them since it was causing problems.  He just fried the bacon next to the peppers and people grabbed a slice with a popper.  I have some leftover cheese mixture which I'm going to use to make some more but put them in the oven.  

The taste was fantastic and everyone still loved them, regardless of the mess!

Fantastic, had been waiting for an event to make them and it was Girls Night Out - Fireside.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I partially baked the bacon before prepping them and also cut the peppers in half to make stuffing easier.

These are awesome poppers.  I make them every year for our grilling compitition and everyone loves them.  I follow the recipe except now I cook the bacon, chop it up and put it in the filling.  It's easier for me while grilling.  Also, I always end up with extra filling and I serve that cold with crackers, it too is awesome.

I just made these guys; and everyone loved them - even my wife, who isn't really into anything spicy. The combination of cooking them and all the cream cheese, really tames them.
I made exactly as directed.
However, I must have had mutant Jalapenos. They were huge. The largest weighed in at 10.2oz, uncut and unseeded. These were definitely knife & fork peppers; not "poppers". I just laid the bacon strip on top.
Mmmm; but they were good.
Thanks.

These were amazing!  I didn't cut them in half as others have said as I was worried about the filling coming out on the grill and I wanted more than what I needed in there.  I wrapped them up with thick sliced bacon (a whole slice a piece) and cooked them filling side down first to get the bacon done on that side before the cheese melted out.  They got rave reviews and I will definitely be making these again!

This is the first time I've ever tried making my own poppers and they were outstanding! Make sure you get all the seeds out but once you do, the poppers are just a tad bit spicy -- not really hot at all. The flavor is really excellent. We split the poppers in 2, filled them then wrapped 1 piece of bacon around each slice -- securing it on both ends with a toothpick.  I only bought 9 poppers (18 halves) but ended up using all of this recipe.  LOVE this and am so excited to share it with my friends. Perfect just as it is.

This was delicious! I made the filling exactly as written and found it needs less garlic powder and more parm. So maybe 1 tsp and 3 Tb., respectively. But other than that? Yum! I did have to change the process since I have a standing pepper grill rack, but that didn't affect the flavor of recipe itself. I chopped the bacon and added it to the filling since I couldn't really wrap them. With just the slight adjustments noted, this will be a regular event in our backyard!

Made these for a grilling party yesterday.  I bought a bag of jalapenos (~14 total).  I liked the filling suggested here better than others on the Web.  I swapped Mozzarella cheese, used fresh grated Parmesan cheese, along with 1 tsp. garlic powder and cream cheese.  I worked in plastic gloves for this recipe.  For 7 of us, we ate them ALL!  Would definitely make again.  Bonus: one suggestion said to use the extra cream cheese filling on crackers; would definitely double the filling recipe and serve as a dip next time, too!

I made these for a Cinco De Mayo pot luck party.  I wish I had made more because the platter was emptied in 15 minutes.  I use the older red jalapenos which seem to be less hot.  Didn't change the recipe at all.  Delicious!

Out of this world! I added chives to the cheese mixture and didn't have bacon on hand so admitted that. Still came out yummy. I laid them on aluminum foil before putting them on the grill to keep the cheese from running. Worked great. 
Making them again tonight. Since I'd prefer to cook them in the foil, I'm adding cooked bacon bits to the top of each.
Thank you so much for a fantastic, fun recipe! My husband and family asks for them all the time. Can't wait for the next BBQ so I can make them for a crowd of our friends.

WOW! What a great recipe!! So tasty! The only thing I did different was put them under the broiler to finish cooking them. I do wish there were ending directions for the grill temp and browning the top. Otherwise perfect appetizer!

Best jalapeno popper recipe I've come across. I think I've been using this recipe about 3 - 4 yrs now. First time making them I followed the exact recipe (Which is delicious on its own) but I add onion powder to the recipe now. Also,I am a very avid hunter and when dove season roles around on Sept. 1st here in MO, you can bet your bottom dollar I put a single dove breast on top of the cheese filling before wrapping in bacon then they go straight on the grate if my Weber grill. Oh so so good :)

These are tasty little morsels.    The only changes I made was to bake them in the oven,  and  I slightly precooked the bacon but I wish I had cooked the bacon  just a little bit more.

Loved!!  Even fam members who have a spicy issue ate them up.  Hint:  I turned off the center burner and put the poppers on foil over the off burner. Much easier clean up. About 25 min.

These were a hit!  I thought this recipe would be too many for 6 people since my peppers were rather large, but there were none left.  Some were a bit charred to get the bacon done enough, but that just added a good flavor that my guests really liked.  I'll be making these again.  I didn't change anything in the recipe and used all organic product.

I found these to be the best poppers to date that I’ve had. I can’t say enough good things about them. The only thing I recommend is replacing the sliver after you fill them  then wrap the bacon.

I have been making this recipe for about a year.  These are so good!  I made a couple tiny changes.  I removed stem and sliced in half longways.  Let the bacon sit out for about 10 minutes so it softens up and can wrap easier.  Toothpicks are not necessary at all.  I bake in oven for 20-22 minutes at 375 degrees.  Make sure you put them on a rack while baking, that way the bacon crisps up.  I assemble a couple batches at a time and keep in frig and bake a few every day.  Holds up well.  Make sure you use gloves.  I dip in Marie's ranch dressing.  Definately a keeper.  As a bonus, if you are Keto or low carb diet, these are a perfect snack!

We liked these! They were easy to make and had good flavor, though I have to say that there are others that I make that we prefer to these...not that they are bad, because they certainly are not. These were fun to try and tasty. Thanks for sharing. :)

Not bad but have had better. The bacon took to  long to crisp up as directed so after a half hour I got impatient and  turned the heat to low under the Jalapeno's and burned them. Either precook the bacon half way before wrapping and do it  in the oven.

My mom's garden had a huge amount of jalapeños and she had cut them in half and frozen them. I wasn't sure if these would turn out or not... But they really did! I prepared them partially frozen still which actually made it much easier and helped it hold its shape. They were not mushy at all and the stuffing flavor was so good!!! Yay!

If you are having a big bbq you have to make this! I've made this at least 10 times, just like the recipe, and it's always a huge hit! Even people who don't like peppers love it!

Rating on the taste only. The grill time was off or my grilling heat was incorrect. No heat temperature was indicated and grilling instructions could have been a lot better. And it took one hour alone just to grill. Should revise recipe to better assist readers who try someone's recipe.
