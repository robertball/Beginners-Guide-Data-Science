This wasn't a hit with us. I didn't like the combination of flavors at all. Perhaps it would be better with fresh peaches, but I doubt I'll be finding out.  Sorry.

My boyfriend was not at all sold on this recipe.  I made it because we had so many peaches in the house.  This was so good that he said I should make it again.  

It feels really fancy, too.  Like something you would find at a Southern California beach restaurant.

I'm sorry, but ewe! This is almost like putting peaches in mashed potatoes, it just doesn't go together and then bacon? A good thought gone awery. I don't think eggs and peaches go together well as an omelet, or maybe something is missing. Because of the bacon, it would probably help to add salsa and omit the sugar in the recipe. Perhaps I will stick to my pancakes or oatmeal for my peaches.

I really liked this recipe. I was looking up peach recipes because I has peaches to use and I didn't want then to go bad. I was iffy at first, but figured that maybe it's like chocolate covered bacon--sounds unusual, but is awesome. :) I think so!
