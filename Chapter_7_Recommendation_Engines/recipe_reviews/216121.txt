Very good and so easy.  I used 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips in the cake instead of chocolate squares chopped.  I skipped the chocolate frosting because I ran out of time and didnt miss it.  There is enough chocolate in the cake and the cake was very moist.  Oh and I used about 4 med banana's to get the 1 1/3 C mashed bananas.

Delicious!  Followed the recipe exactly and it turned out moist and delicious!  Will definitely make again and again.  Also tried with a peanut butter frosting!  Awesome!
