Very traditional ingredients. Love this Chef John. My husband and his friend have this as their snack for lunch at least 3 times a week, thanks to your wonderful recipe. (and my cooking, lol)
His friend even asked for the recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as described.  I watched the video several times before starting and had all my ingredients ready. my nuts were toasted and kept in a warm oven. I stirred the entire time as directed. 

when I added my soft peak egg whites, I continued to cook and although my mixture got thicker, it never turned white. it just stayed a milky honey color. I did do the water test and removed it after the specified time anyway- added nuts and  poured it into the pan with the wafer paper. 

when cool, my torrone was ROCK hard.  of course if you broke it into little bits- the taste was good, but it was really difficult to eat.  you could break your teeth, it was so hard. 

so, this recipe was a disappointing fail for me. the end result was definitely NOT traditional torrone. I think it would be wise for chef john to rewrite the recipe with temperatures using a candy thermometer, so more people could experience success. 

(and he also never specified in the recipe, or the video, when to add the extra tablespoons of sugar listed in the ingredients list. in reading other torrone recipes, it’s added after the eggs reach soft peak.).

I have never attempted a recipe that needed to be cooked to a certain stage and I failed with 'soft clay' stage.  Rather than despair or serve this as a thick, uncuttable but unpourable dessert in a bowl I was able to drop globs of it into melted chocolate and it became even more amazing in taste.  At least to the chocolate lover in me.  I am not posting pics as they are certainly not professional done but they taste wonderful!

Absolutely an outstanding recipe! The video was great to watch and helped me a lot. Came out looking like I knew what I was doing and even better tasted that way too!

The recipe is NOT good, it didnt came out white, it was sticky, too hard and way too sweet. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone!

Very good, as good as our family recipe but for one ingredient not commonly found in America. Good job!

I recently bought some of this in Paris and it was so awesome I had to find a recipe. This is a great recipe and I added even more almonds and pistachios. It did not take me quite as long during the second cooking but it is a lot of stirring, but well worth it. I found that this wafer paper is not readily available in my town and I used Wilton sugar paper…DONT it's aweful!

I give this  a ZERO! Tried the recipe TWICE, exactly as written with times and stirring. Wasted a lot of ingredients a a lot of time for two complete failures. Would never try this recipe again

My niece made this for a cultural class project, and WOW! DO it the long way and don’t skimp — I promise it’s worth it. The wafer paper isn’t found in normal grocery stores, but you can get it on Amazon. It comes in a big pack, but I make and decorate cakes and they’re useful for those too, so I don’t mind. Plus, you’ll want to make this more than once!

Has anyone tried the recipe without the wafer paper? While it seems to make the cutting  easier I’m not fond of the paper feel in my mouth but I am hesitant to work so very hard and long making it only to fail on the final step of the recipe. Thanks for sharing your experiences.

I made this last year and it turned out perfectly. I didn't use the rice wafer as my Mom is a celiac and couldn't confirm it was safe for her. Still worked without it.

I made this last night and it took alot less time than mentioned.   After I incorporated the egg whites it only took about 8 minutes until the mixture was finished.   I am glad I watched the video first.  The results were great.  I used almonds whole and slivered, pecans, and salted pumpkin seeds.   I also used dried blueberries.   The torrone did not slice very neatly but it tastes great.

I made it as written and it was a hit!
We always buy on our trips to Philadelphia. 
Won't need to anymore.
My only mistake was falling 4 degrees short of 224 soft ball temp.
A little sticky but tasted  good!

Flavor 10 stars!
Should have watched the video!
My first attempt bombed. Cooked too long, color went from creamy white to tan. Not sure the heat was low enough. My low run hot. It never set.
Plan to try again.

Thank you Chef John. I highly recommend this excellent recipe.  It tasted perfect and would have looked perfect too if I hadn't made some rookie  mistakes. 

I cooked it too hot and it came out darker than expected, but it was incredible and fairly easy to make.  Next time i will use a smaller burner so i don't get to hot. Also, I had some difficulty because I made it on a hot and humid day and tried to cool the mix in the refrigerator.  This caused a condensation problem that made it difficult to handle.

It didnt say when to add the three tablespoons white sugar. 
And it takes a lot of whisking the eggs to finally get to the point of shaving cream. Also the average grocery store doesn't have wafer paper and plain nuts.
