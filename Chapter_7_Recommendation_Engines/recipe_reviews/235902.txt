This recipe was sooooo good, my girls just went to town on these. I couldn't find the fully cooked port without sauce, so I bought a BBQ rubbed Hormel Pork Roast for the slow cooker. Cooked it up and shredded it. It was divine using it with this little nummy nummy. Will totally make again, we made these as a sandwich style snack and some open faced and prefer them better open faced by a show of 4 to 2 hands in my house. Thanks for a neat little morsel!

These little bites come together easily and quickly.  If you have ever had a cubano, you will like the flavor profile of this bite. I preferred this open faced with one cracker, as opposed to the two. If you can't find sauceless precooked pulled pork, any cooked  and shredded pork will do.  I prefer the sauceless precooked packaged pulled pork for convenience.   To read more about how this recipe concept came to life visit Renee's Kitchen Adventures.

Super simple. Super Fast. Super Flavorful. Would make a good Super Bowl appetizer. I made these with leftover bbq chicken breast from dinner. Tasty! Two crackers made for quite a mouthful so I think they're best without the top cracker.

I have been hooked on Cuban sandwiches ever since the first time I had one in Miami Beach in November of 2012. I made these today for an afternoon snack, and I was so impressed by how much these little minis taste just like the big version! My family loved them. I think I'm going to make these for the bunco ladies next month. They're going to love them!

I have been a fan of Cuban sandwiches for many years and never thought about trying it as an appetizer.  These were fabulous!   I used leftover pulled pork from AR recipe slow cooker carnitas.  I made some using Dijon as used in the recipe and some with thousand island dressing instead.  They were both very good.  So easy to make and wonderful flavor!

DELICIOUS!!!  I prefer these open-faced without the top cracker because it makes it easier to eat.  I love Cubans, and these are perfect.  Put them together, pop them in the oven and you have 20 appetizers ready all at once!  Fabulous, Renee, I look forward to making more!

We love these mini Cubans! They are easy to assemble and the crowd loves them. Try them with sliced a baguette instead of Ritz and they're almost hearty enough to be called a slider. I usually buy pre-cooked pulled pork to save some time. 2 thumbs up!
