Awesome CHOCOLATELY taste!  I substituted canola oil for the olive oil (? just made sense) and I used 1 packet of hot cocoa mix (yields about 3 Tblsp.) + 1 Tblsp. cocoa powder.  I will make these again and again - Thanks!

Delicious and super moist! I substituted 1/2 cup of applesauce for the olive oil and added 3 Tbsp of ground flax seeds for fiber. Will definately make these again.

Excellent! Moist and chocolatey! Only used 1/2 cup of chocolate chips and cocoa powder instead of hot chocolate mix (which is mostly sugar). Replaced eggs (because of allergy in family) with 1/2 banana mashed, 1/4 cup sour milk and 1 1/2 tsp powdered egg replacement. Made enough for 24 cupcakes and cooked a little longer (35mins). Also I would use paper liners next time. I greased and found the tops would tend to come off when removing from the pan. Fantastic recipe!

I perfected this recipe and highly recommend you try it with my variations! REMOVE: the sour milk, hot choc. mix, and 3/4 cups sugar. ADD: 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup applesauce, 1T cocoa powder , 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/2 tsp baking powder. The most amazing cupcakes I have ever made!! Enjoy!

I was not impressed with this recipe at all. We had high hopes, but no one cared much for them and they ended up in the trash.

Made a dozen of  these for my husband and 7 are already eaten.  Wanted to make pumpkin chocolate chip but no pumpkin around so used the zucchini.  Substituted 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 bisquick and also 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar.  While not quite as sweet but sweet enough, was much healthier.  Also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 buttery spread with same amt of olive oil and came out fine.  Think that using brown sugar might enhance the taste. Will try next time.  Also used walnuts instead of all the zucchini ( only use about a cup) and will likely fare well with the nut lovers.  Alot of vit e in walnuts----good for you!!!!!
Good luck.

These cupcakes were so good!  I did use 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour and cut the sugar back to 1 1/4 cups.  I used mini chocolate chips because it's what I had.  They turned out great!!!

These were great. A nice treat for my 3 year old with at least a little bit of veggie content. They are moist and fudgy. I followed the recipe exactly except that I substituted cocoa powder for the hot cocoa mix. The only thing that was not outstanding was their appearance- not bad looking but kind of flat at the tops.

I tried this receipe and I tried to make the sour milk by combining 1 c milk to 1 tbs vinegar because I had a hard time finding sour milk in the store. This receipe was okay; next time I will find real sour milk. Very gooey consistency.

8.7.18  These have to be the strangest-looking cupcakes I’ve ever made.  Now admittedly, I’m no big baker, but I followed this recipe to the letter with the exception of substituting Egg Beaters® because I was out of eggs.  I have done that successfully before, so that shouldn’t have been an issue.  The recipe doesn’t say to drain the grated zucchini, but it was especially wet, I did squeeze out some of the liquid, but not all, so perhaps, that had something to do with the rise (or lack thereof) on the cupcakes??  All I know is that they may not be prettiest cupcake you'll ever see, but they are very chocolate-y and do taste VERY GOOD!

They were very flavorful and a big hit at the potluck I took them to. I substituted plain yogurt for the milk and used grated zucchini I had in my freezer from last summer.

They are moist and yummy but I couldn't get them to cook all the way through. I kept having to put them back in the oven and re cook them. Maybe the frozen zucchini I used was to wet? They were yummy but next time I would drain the zucchini better and cook longer on a higher temp.

These were very good! I made them with 1 C whole wheat flour & 1 C all purpose flour and used cocoa powder instead of the hot cocoa mix. The kids loved them. I did make a 2nd batch using applesauce in place of the oil.  They turned out good too, more cake like. Will definitely make again!

mmm...i don't even like cupcakes, but I needed something for work to share. I didn't have any vanilla (really, I didn't), but I used Almond extract and then put some sliced almonds in, and it worked out really well. I would strongly recommend using the cupcake papers, otherwise: be prepared to have a crumbly catastrophe on your hands. These cupcakes are chewy, moist, delicious, and satisfying. There's the perfect amount of sweetness in them, but their goodness can't be enjoyed with just one bite. They have to be enjoyed in multiple, finger staining parts that you didn't decide. They did, because they need numbers to attack your taste buds.
