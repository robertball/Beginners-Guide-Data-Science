These were very good. I did take the suggestion of increasing the coconut to 1/2 cup and added 2 Tbls milk. My husband said they tasted like coconut cream pie. We will make these again for sure.

I love coconut so these muffins sounded like something I would like. This muffin may have potential if it had more coconut and wasn't so dry. If I make these again I will add some milk so the batter is not so thick and increase the coconut to 1/2 cup or more.

Very good muffin with lots of coconut flavor. The batter was very thick so I added some milk to thin it. Shared with friends that were impressed and asked for the recipe. I will make these again.
