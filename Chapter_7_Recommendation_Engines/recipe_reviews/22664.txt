This was a terrific dip. I loved the orange flavor. Instead of chopping chocolate chips, I used miniature ones and added much more than a tablespoon. Highly recommended.

Delicious! This dip was a hit at my party. I used mini chocolate chips instead of chopping chocolate. I served it with strawberries, pineapple, orange slices and small graham crackers. It makes a lot of dip so have a lot of fruit to go with it.
