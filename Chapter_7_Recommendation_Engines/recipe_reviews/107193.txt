I can't deep fry, so I shaped these into patties and fried them on the frying pan.  I omitted the salt. The pepper and curry add a great flavor!  Thanks for this delightful recipe!

These sounded great, but they turned out pretty bland. I wouldn't suggest baking these to try to be healthy: I baked the first half of the batch and they were really blah, so I fried the rest in coconut oil, and they were much better, but still missing something. (I didn't deep-fry them; instead I flattened them out like patties.) These really need a sauce, like a raita, and I think they could use more salt. We ate them with sour cream. Also, I used spelt flour.

My husband and I loved it, but the kids did not. It was pretty oily, so it will be just a special treat.

I have never heard of, let alone make anything, like Poulourie.  I was thrilled with these.  they were surprisingly light with a nice crisp to them. I've made them twice, and even when I forgot salt the first time, I was excited to make them again.  I like them better as a snack than a side or meal though.

Good poulourie recipe. The author didn't mention that this is a Caribbean dish, favoured in Trinidad and on the Guyanese coast. Once a poor-man's GOP's, it's now considered a cultural delicacy from Jamaica through the Lesser Antilles and onto Guyana. Tomato sauces work but tamarind or fig sauces or - for an awesome American twist try a natural, red jam or preserve mixed with some sriracha to to give it that extra something that this simple food feels like it needs. Also no deep fryer necessary just use a pot with hot oil and a metal sifter/ screen. This dish tastes fantastic with fish entrees that need to be made more substantial. Don't eat too many though, they stick to you!

Very interesting. Best as a side dish--not as a snack like I fixed them. Not sure what I would fix them with--but worth a second try.

Yes, I did adjust this recipe to fit our diet, but the modifications I made did not in any way change the integrity of the recipe.  This recipe is fantastic!  I used yellow split peas, which yielded a much more typical looking batter.  I used cumin instead of curry powder, and jalapeno instead of serrano, coconut flour instead of flour (and less than half as much, since coconut flour is very absorbent), and baking soda instead of baking powder.  I also added a coupled tablespoons of olive oil to help the blender blend up the peas a bit better.  I also made mine bigger - dropping the batter in rounded tablespoons instead of teaspoons.  These were fabulous, and everyone loved them, from my husband on down to the 17mo twins.  We dipped them in salsa.

Made exactly as the recipe described and shallow fried these in about a 1/2 inch of oil. These are good but the batter is very very sticky, you HAVE to use a nonstick pan. I used a regular pan and had to switch they kept sticking to the bottom and making a mess.

These tasted much better than I thought they would.  I was looking for a recipe for split green peas other than soup and this worked out great.  I used cumin because my boyfriend doesn't care for curry and even though I accidentally spilled it and it was really cuminally it tasted great.  I think next time I'll add some other ingredients like green onion, tomato and cilantro with the cumin.  And dip in salsa, YUM!  And try it with curry too, which I like, dipped in raita. Actually the batter is such a neutral flavor you could try many combinations of flavors, and feel good that even though it's fried, it's veggies.

I have made this many times now for my family of seven. I have also made it for large groups and no matter how many I make they all get eaten and I'm always asked for the recipe.

had to cook them a bit hotter than recommended to keep the from getting too oily. But they were really good.
