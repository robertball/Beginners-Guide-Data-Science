This tart was fabulous.  We loved the crust and the filling that goes with it was perfect.  The raspberries make it tart, so to sweeten things up I made a sweetened raspberry sauce to serve along with it.  You will not regret making this recipe, it is so good!  Thanks!

This was really good.  I didn't have pistachios and I still thought it was delicious.  For my preference, I would probably cook the crust until it was just barely golden brown because it was a little too crunchy for me. I didn't have mini tarts so I just made it into one big pie.

The crust was kind of tough. I generally prefer pastry doughs made without eggs.
