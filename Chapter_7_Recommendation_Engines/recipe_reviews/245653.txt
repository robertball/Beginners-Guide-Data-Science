My version was with 3 bananas, no applesauce, 1 cup all purpose flour instead of wheat flour, and a little extra oats because my mix was runny. It turned out good.

BEWARE OF BREAKING TEETH!

This recipe will make a chocolate concoction that is dry and hard-as-bricks.  Recipe is not tested--total waste of time and energy to make.
 
Since I really like the concept of oatmeal, applesauce, bananas with chocolate cake, I modified the recipe so that the product has a soft, moist cake-like consistency.  Plus, you can actually taste the applesauce and bananasâ€”yum!  Below is my modified recipe.




Ingredients
		1 1/2 cups quick cooking oats
		1 cup brown sugar
		2/3 cup whole wheat flour
		2/3 cup cocoa powder
		1/3 cup all-purpose flour
		1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
		2 bananas
		2 eggs
		1/2 cup butter (melted)
		1 cup milk
		3/4 cup applesauce
		2 tablespoons vanilla extract
		3/4 cup chocolate and white chocolate chips

Perhaps I'm biased, but I thought these were awesome. :)

I've adjusted the recipe a bit since I first wrote it. Adding an extra banana and upping the milk to 3/4 cup (or even 1 cup) makes for moister, more flavourful brownies.
