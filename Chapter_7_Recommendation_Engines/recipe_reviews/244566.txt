I thought these vegetables were good. I would compare them more to steamed vegetables versus saut√©ed vegetables in texture and taste. The 2 minced cloves of garlic do impart a light garlic flavor. I found that 1 3/4 of a cup was basically equivalent to a 14.5 oz can of Swanson Broth. I used the Natural Goodness 33% less sodium type. 4 cups of vegetables seems like a lot, but after cooking it is maybe 3 servings as a side dish. I ended up with quite a bit of leftover broth. So, I am saving it to steam some more tomorrow or the next day. Also, watch the vegetables carefully. I cooked them for 5 minutes, as an initially suggested time, and they were very tender. Next time I am going to try 3 minutes as I prefer a little more crispness myself. This is a very healthy way to prepare vegetables.

In an effort to keep it low sodium, I used 2 c water, 2 tsp sodium free chicken bouillion, 2 cloves garlic and 1 tsp italian seasoning. I brought that to a boil first and then added 6 cups mixed:broccoli, cauliflower, red and green bell pepper, and carrots to simmer for 5-6 minutes.  Very tasty.

We really enjoyed the simplicity of this dish!  The amount of garlic could be adjusted to individual taste.  I think the amount of broth to vegetables is a bit extreme, you could get away with about 1/2 cup of broth to steam 4 cups of veggies.  Seems a severe waste of broth to me unless you used it to steam a few times, or added it to another dish.

Boiling veggies removed so many nutrients.  Steam them instead in a basket using stock instead of water.

Fantastic!  I used green beans, peppers, broccoli and carrots and for the broth I used Better Than Bouillon.  This recipe is a keeper!

We really enjoyed this simple way to make great flavored vegetables. The only thing was would do differently is use the celery, peppers instead of the cauliflower.  Would be a great addition to any weeknight meal.

This is a basic but easy side dish for a weeknight dinner.  I didn't use the cauliflower, because I didn't see the note at the bottom of the recipe, but it was still good with the other vegetables. The chicken stock lent it a nice flavor, and the garlic was the right amount.

I added a few thin slices of ginger the second time I made.  I liked it both ways.

I used my own chicken broth instead of the can. Shrimp broth would be great too. I also added a little bit more spice for added flavor. It came out really tasty.

Very easy way to prep veggies. I used a deep and wide pan so my veggies were only half covered with the broth, which worked well for me. I doubled the amount of garlic and we enjoyed the broccoli and cauliflower prepared this way. Simple way of jazzing up plain veggies.

This was certainly an easy recipe and a simple way to add flavor to your veggies. Garlic ramps up the flavor and we did add a pinch of black pepper as well.

This recipe was so easy to get together, but, the chicken broth and garlic gave the vegetables much more flavor than just steaming in water.   It did seem like there was a lot of broth for steaming, so, the vegetables had more of a boiled flavor than steaming to me.

The broth and garlic give fresh veggies a nice boost. I had a couple of banana peppers from the garden and tossed them in the mix and it worked well for those too. You can't bean fast and simple!

The broth and garlic add great flavors to sometimes boring vegetables.
