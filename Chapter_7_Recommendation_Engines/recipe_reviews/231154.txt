I changed this up just a touch. I used regular cream of chicken soup because that was all I had and I added some fresh ground pepper to the "sauce". I mixed the egg noodles, ham, chicken, swiss and sauce all together and poured it into a casserole dish, then topped it with the bread crumb mixture. My family loved this casserole--NO leftovers. My husband made it a point to tell me that I'm to make this again and the kids are still talking about it.

This is the best "pasta" casserole I've had in my life. It was so good that I called my best friend half way through dinner to tell her she needed to make this. I used shredded Swiss cheese instead of cubed, and I did not use reduced-fat soup or reduced-fat sour cream because I had some regular sour cream to use up and my local grocery store doesn't carry reduced fat cream of chicken soup (I'm not kidding). Also, I mixed everything together first (except for the topping) before putting it in the casserole dish instead of just putting it on top of the pasta, then I put the topping on. The topping is very good. It's similar to the topping I use on other casseroles, but I never thought to put Parmesan cheese in it before...duh. I will make this again for sure!

Wow! This was really good.   We have three eaters here, and I award stars by the number of thumbs up.  Six thumbs were counted.  Unfortunately there is a five star max on this site.   I used the exact ingredients called for, but I scaled them back to a two-quart casserole.   I also mixed everything together except for the bread crumbs.   I was a bit grouchy about getting a skillet dirty to add more seasoning to seasoned bread crumbs, but I have to say that the flavor of the topping was wonderful.   This was a great cold night meal!   Thanks!

OK, so , when I read these reviews I always think "if they changed it, how can they rate it so high?".  Now I know why.  This is a great dish.  I loved it. My family loved it.  Here's the thing, I found it to be very dry.  Some of the noodles get hard (to the point of being inedible).  So I served around them. I quickly made a roux, added milk, sour cream, chicken broth and then stirred in some more cheese until it melted.  It took 5 minutes and it was a great "side of sauce".  With the extra sauce, this was sooooooo delicious.  If I rated this recipe lower because it was dry and others did the same, no one would make it and that would be too bad because it is really very good.  To me, this is a minor tweak as opposed to some of the reviews I have read that make major changes to the recipe making it in essence a whole new dish.  So...5 stars for this casserole, just double the sauce.

This was pretty good as a quick recipe to use up some leftovers, but the older I get, the less I can stand canned cream of anything soup. It just tasted like... soup. Salty soup. I added dijon to the soup mix... didn't help much. Would be much better if you just made your own bechamel seasoned to taste.

This recipe was delicious!  I love Chicken Cordon Bleu and I love pasta.. so, it just made sense.  Like a few others who have posted reviews, I too used the normal chicken of cream soup.  I also used a full cup of fat free milk and a full cup of sour cream.. I definitely wanted to make sure it was nice and creamy!  I also used Kraft's mozzarella cheese with a touch of Philadelphia.. just to be naughty.

Also included, two table spoons of onions.  Love onions!  Because I added a little extra than what was specified, I cooked it for about 10 more minutes.  Turned out DELICIOUS.  Very happy with this recipe!  I definitely get that this was a healthy alternative.. I was just feeling a bit spontaneous when I made it.  Five stars!

This was really tasty - my family enjoyed it! However, I didn't use the low fat/fat free versions of the ingredients, I used the full-calorie items. I made half a recipe and that is enough to feed four of us. I'll make this recipe again!

Pretty good and easy to make, and I had a block of swiss cheese to eat up before it went bad.  I didn't have egg noodles so I used elbow mac instead, and it turned out just fine.  I also mixed everything together instead of layering.  I would probably recommend covering with tin foil while baking just to cut down on the dry noodles, but other than that, it was pretty good.  Definitely will be making again.

Very good recipe. I did not use the low fat soup, double the bread crumb topping.  I did not use bread crumbs, I used Ritz crackers crushed up in place of bread crumbs.  It gets a 6 star in my book!
Thanks much for the recipe.

I was introduced to this recipe by a family member of mine and I thanked her over and over for it. I am a huge chicken and cheese fan and this recipe includes both of them. This casserole is the perfect blend of creamy and also has a bit of tang from the Swiss cheese that adds a perfect touch to it. The bread crumbs and parmesan on the top give it a bit of a crisp also to add texture to the dish. It is such an easy recipe and most of the time I have all of these ingredients on hand anyways. I am even going to try and double the recipe and freeze one batch for cooking later. I like the fact that it is very easy to throw together and while it is cooking for the 30 minutes I can get other things done around the house while supper is in the oven. I have already given this recipe to five friends and coworkers and all of them were excited to try it. One even went out that very same day I gave them the recipe to get the ingredients to make over the weekend.  One of the best recipes I have found online!

This is a good comfort food dish. Easy to make. Next time I will use regular condensed soup instead of low fat, and I might add a little more milk or sour cream as it was a little on the dry side. I used Panko bread crumbs and added salt, pepper and mustard powder to the mix. Husband loved it!

Noting some of the other reviews I doubled the sauce, I was glad I did, otherwise it would have been too dry. My 2 chicken breasts ended up being too much, almost 3 cups! and my deli counter lady couldn't figure out how to cut 8 oz. of ham, so that was a little heavy too. Both issues not the fault of the recipe. It was a lot of food, it made 8-10 large servings!

This was very tasty, but gave it a four star as I changed it a bit. Like one of the other reviewers, the older I get the more I don't like using canned creamed soups (and I didn't have any) so I drenched  the chicken breast chunks in a few tablespoons of flour that I had seasoned with garlic powder, seasoning salt, pepper, ginger, paprika and a pinch of cayenne and mustard powder. Then browned the chicken and removed it and made a white sauce with light cream, sour cream and a chicken boullion packet. Then put the casserole together and baked it. My husband who usually only likes crispy chicken recipes really liked this.  I had cut the recipe in half as there are only two of us, and after 2 healthy portions, there is enough left over for lunch tomorrow - yay! Thank you for sharing.

Pretty good! I followed a lot of the other reviewers' suggestions and just mixed everything together, topped with the topping and baked. Quick and tasty.

This sounded so great (all ingredients I know I love) and when I made it... no disappointment! I LOVE this! The only thing I did different was using shredded swiss instead of cubes. And we did mix it all around a bit instead of just layering (which I think I'll try next time since a few noodles did crisp a bit when they were poking above the cream mixture). The mixture of cream of chicken with milk and sour cream is so creamy, smooth, and delicious! And I loved the bread crumb, Parmesan, butter mix too! I almost want to add even more of both of those, but it's so decadent as-is, I probably will shy away. One thing that may have also made a difference was the way the chicken was cooked in advance (I imagine the kind of chicken and how it's cooked can have some affect on how this turns out and there are no instructions on that part of the process). I boiled chicken breast strips in a bit of water seasoned with poultry seasoning and it came out moist and flavorful, which I still tasted after preparing the casserole. I used precooked Ham steaks from Costco and just cubed the ham (it maintained it's lovely flavor too). I've been grading my dinners as I make them, and this one was an A+! It will definitely be back on the menu!

I generally stick to a recipe as written the first time I make it.  This as written is very bland, and I didn't even use the low/non-fat soup or sour cream.  I thought it odd there wasn't ANY seasoning.  I will make this again, but will be adding SALT along with cutting back a little on the pasta.  It begs for something else that I've yet to figure out, perhaps a little chicken soup base, fresh parsley and pepper.

EDIT:  Finally got back round to this recipe.  Here are the changes I made and it turned out delicious! 

Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces, seasoned w/salt & pepper then sauteed chopped onions in the pan before cooking it.  

Substituted cream of chicken with herbs for the soup.  

Combined all ingredients (minus topping) in a large bowl and added about a cup of sour cream total.  

Added salt and pepper to taste and about a teaspoon of chicken soup base.  Then added a splash of white cooking wine and some fresh chopped parsley.  Sprinkled shredded mozzarella cheese on top. 

For the topping I melted 3 Tbs of butter and added bread crumbs until it was moist, but crumbly.  Then sprinkled on top of everything.  Baked about 40 mins.

I made a couple of changes after making this a couple of times. I double the sauce part. I put in 2 9x9 pans so we get 2 meals out of it since we don't like it reheated. I also double the bread crumb topping now. I've used what ever cream of chicken soup and sour cream I have on hand. We really like this recipe!

Good use of leftover ham, but fairly unmemorable. Don't know that I would make it again.

Great dish! My family loved it.. BUT... I did change a little. I  cut up 4 pieces of bacon in inch pieces and cooked my chicken in it. I also substituted ham for Canadian bacon. I added all the leftover ingredients  to the cooked chicken, bacon & Canadian bacon. Then tossed the noodles in. added the topping and baked 10 minutes. My family gave it a 10 out of 10 and that's huge for my family!

This was delicious and I loved the egg noodles instead of regular noodles in this. Bumped this up to 3 chicken breasts, 12 oz egg noodles (forgot to add more ham which I should have), but kept the sauce amount the same with the addition of 2 tablespoons of dijon (will use more next time). Hearty and filling! Microwaved the chicken in a Pampered Chef microwave round covered baker which kept it moist and tossed with salt and pepper after chopping.

I made this last night and it went over huge with not only me but wiith my boyfriend and his picky 11 year old son. I will definitely be making it again. I used the same amounts of ingredients that the recipe calls for but they were not the low fat versions because I used what I had on hand. I also combined the ingredients instead of layering them and then sprinkled the bread crumb mixture on top before baking! Very yummy!!!

The whole family loved this! I used reg. sour cream and cream of chicken though. And crushed up saltines instead of using seasoned bread crumbs (I still mixed it with butter and parmesan cheese though). Will definitely be making this again. The only thing I'll change is I'll mix the sauce into the noodles next time.

This was good...but a little on the dry side as written.  I added extra sour cream, milk and soup and felt it could've used even more.  Add salt and pepper to taste.

This is ok.  It had way too much Swiss cheese for me.  It's a big heavy gooey cheesy mess.  It'll probably sit like a rock in my stomach for the next 24 hours.  But yeah, it does taste pretty good, I guess.  If there's a next time I'll reduce the cheese and maybe add a little vegetable matter, I dunno - celery?  Not sure what.  Or maybe there won't be a next time.

Flavor is good, and it’s super easy! Only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars, is because it’s a little dry. I would make more of the sauce next time. Maybe even double it!

This was phenomenal.  I had great expectations and this recipe exceeded them.  
I lightly  salted and peppered my chicken and cooked in olive oil to begin with. And I changed very little otherwise. 
I left out milk because we don’t usually have it. Also with the exception of crumb topping I just mixed everything together as I prepped it in one dish and added a few tbsp of butter to the meat/noodle mix. 

GREAT RECIPE!!

I added 2 T Dijon mustard and substituted Durkees fried onions for the bread crumbs and  parmesan. My husband, who usually sticks his nose up at casseroles liked it a lot. My grandkids LOVED it, having seconds and thirds!!
This is definitely going into my regular rotation.

We altered this to be lactose free with Parmesan aged over 12 months, Lactaid Sour Cream and Campbell’s Golden Mushroom soup. It was a hit! We have also made it following the recipe as called for, also good! I would however alter the topping... I feel it doesn’t have enough crunchy topping to cover the whole casserole and the addition of Parmesan during the cooking leaves you with a gooey awkward mess to spread. I’ve altered the topping to be as follows: Cook a fair globe of butter/margarine in a pan, mix with one sleeve of ritz crackers, crushed to oblivion... cook until ritz have absorbed butter (we use Canoleo margarine) sprinkle over top of casserole and cook. Once removed from oven, sprinkle with a LIGHT coating of grated Parmesan (the fresh stuff is less salty and more tasty than the kraft kind)

I didn’t have any regular ham, I used deli ham sliced up. Also used Cream of Bacon instead of Cream of Chicken, and Mozzarella instead of Swiss as these are what I had on hand. My very picky son has already had 2nds, I will take this as a win!

Just made this for dinner. It was so delicious. I used panko bread crumbs instead to make the topping just a bit more crispy.

Loved it! Made half the recipe in a 2.5 qt casserole, it was the perfect size. Several people thought the sauce was a little light, so I did about 1.5 times the sauce, and mixed all ingredients together (except topping) before putting in the dish. This helps distribute the sauce so it’s not dry. Noodles near the top edge may get a little crispy but that’s normal. The only extra flavor I added was a dash of Dijon mustard to the sauce. Will definitely make again.

Fantastic recipe! I added sauteed thyme-encrusted chicken breasts, made it gluten-free by using GF pasta, panko crumbs and Pacific Foods soup. Have made this twice and BF and I compete to see who gets to the leftovers first!

I loved this.  I followed the recipe best I could, but I didn't have any sour cream or parmesan. I make my own 'cream of' soups so I used that. I did add quite a bit of extra milk and some water to ensure it stayed creamy while cooking instead of drying out. I covered with foil for the first 15 min. My kids weren't really fans of this but that just meant there was more for me.

I omitted the sour cream and parmesan because I didn't have them on hand. The whole family loved it, even the grandkids. Next time I might add more "sauce".

I made it exactly but added cooked Steam Fresh Broccoli that I cut up and added on top of Chicken & Ham and doubled the Parmesan & butter.  This is outstanding 1 dish meal, so creamy and good.  Great dish to have for something quick even company with some crusty bread and a salad.

I used cream of chicken with mushroom soup, and about two tablespoons Chardonnay.  I don’t know if it made it better than the original recipe but it sure was fantastic.   I only had about. 1 3/4  cup of chicken.  It was great! I also had a good quality wide noodle.  Will be made many times again.
I used leftover ham that has been studded with cloves. Home made baked ham is so much better then deli ham.

I mixed everything and then added the topping. I used shredded Swiss cheese and a honey ham steak. The chicken was made with salt, pepper and oil on the stovetop otherwise followed the recipe exactly. Tasted great. Husband and i both had seconds.

Really liked this casserole - it's very rich but definitely has all of the flavors of Chicken Cordon Bleu!  Make sure you dice up the Swiss, I cut them very small but it made the dish to have the little pops of Swiss!  I think it was much better than if it had been grated.  I can see this going into the "Comfort Food" box of recipes!

This was delicious. I had some yellow pepper and onion I needed to use up so I sauted them and poured them over the pasta in the pan. I didn’t have any bread crumbs so I crushed some rice krispies mixed with dried onion rings and butter and put it over everything. I loved the flavour of the onion rings so might do that again. Easy to put together and really good. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is phenomenal. I followed another reviewer's advice and doubled up on the sauce- VERY important step if you plan to have left overs! 
This is officially one of my go-to comfort foods....just make sure you hit the gym really hard before making this so all the calories dont make you feel guilty!!!!

Within 2 bites, picky hubby stated it was REALLY good.  Things he likes typically get an "it's OK,' so this was off the charts.   Putting this one on the make again list per his request!!!

My review: creamy enough but not too much, flavorful and just the perfect amount of taste you expect for cordon blue - tasty but not over-powering, delicate texture with the noodles instead of super-dense.  Took the easy route:  found black forest ham ends at the deli and chopped at home, extra flavor and super cheap!

My MIL was in the mood for a chicken casserole so decided to look for something different and came across this recipe.  In general I thought it was good but being an avid cook, I cannot help but tweak things here and there.  I had Gruyère cheese on hand so opted to use that for the Swiss cheese.  I also had regular cream of chicken soup and regular sour cream on hand so used those.  I sautéed onions and mushrooms in a little butter and added a teaspoon of minced garlic.  I deglazed the pan with some dry white wine.  Based on some other reviews, I decided to increase the amount of sauce and am glad I did. Some suggested doubling it but I went with an additional 50% which for us seemed the right amount.  I used low carb penne (Dreamfields)  instead of noodles as I thought they would stand up to reheating better (my MIL and husband love left overs!) I used cracked pepper in the sauce.  I also increased the amount of topping as 1/3 cup seemed pretty scant so would suggest doubling the crumbs and Parmesan (and increasing the butter accordingly. ) I baked the casserole covered without topping for about 30-40 minutes, stirred the casserole well, and then added the topping and baked uncovered for another 15-20 minutes. I thought it was delicious as did my husband and MIL.  The reason for four stars instead of 5 was that I think without my tweaks it would have been too bland for our tastes but all in all a keeper recipe.

This was a great casserole recipe.  I did think the recipe needed a bit more flavor added.  I added in some finely chopped onion, garlic powder, and parsley.  Next time I will double the sour cream and milk to make it creamier.  It was just a touch drier than I like.  I baked it covered in the oven for around 20 minutes til bubbly.  Then uncovered and topped with the butter and breadcrumbs, for the remainder of the time and turned on the broiler the last couple of minutes to get a nice brown on the breadcrumbs.  I used panko breadcrumbs to get a nice crunch on top.  4 stars as written, 5 stars with the additions.  Thank you for the recipe.  I will for sure make again!

My family really enjoyed this! Since it's not always easy for me to find meals that they all like, this gets five stars! It really is tasty with good flavors - stick-to-the-ribs comfort food. I used the ingredients I had on hand (regular soup, regular sour cream, skim milk), and I almost always use crushed Ritz instead of bread crumbs for casseroles. Since it's kind of bland-looking, I served with broccoli and a green salad. I like another reviewers idea of mixing everything together, then putting in the baking dish. I may try that next time. Thanks for sharing! Delicious!

I didn't have egg noodles, so I ended up using farfalle (bowties) instead. I did throw in some fresh broccoli that I had on hand, to round out the meal. The family really liked it - there were no leftovers. Next time I think that I will double the recipe - I have an 11-year-old son that eats everything that you put in front of him, and eats 5 meals a day (what I wouldn't give to have that kind of metabolism). This is a great way to use up leftovers, and a super easy weeknight meal.

This turned out to be an easier way to make Chicken Cordon Bleu than the traditional method. It's a great way to use up leftover ham!  Actually, I borrow an idea from another recipe, then used this recipe for the remainder procedure. I cut raw chicken breast in chunks, dipped it in a seasoned flour and sauteed it. Then I combine all the ingredients except the cheese. I covered the casserole then baked it 20 minutes, uncovered it and added the cheese and baked another 20 minutes. Next time I think I would add the bread crumbs on top.

Good, solid comfort food dish and great for using up leftovers. Of course, I subbed in what I had, which was chipotle-seasoned chicken that I had left over from the night before, I chopped up some deli ham I had in the fridge and used cubed, sharp cheddar in place of Swiss, grated Romano in place of Parmesan, and crushed Ritz crackers in  place of buttered bread crumbs. I layered and baked as directed and had no issues with dry noodles. I wonder if some are experiencing dry noodles because they're mixing all the ingredients before putting in the dish? By topping the noodles, chicken and cheese with the soup, milk and sour cream mixture, no noodles were exposed to the heat of the oven. Finished off with a generous sprinkling of Romano and the crushed Ritz crackers. Delicious and my kids and husband ate it up! I will definitely save this and use it with other leftover variations in the future.

I will make this again. I am at an AirBnb house so had to use dishes they had...no 11x9 so had to use a 2qt square glass dish. Used medium sized egg noodles made a whole standard sized bag, but left out about a cup cooked so as to not fill up the whole dish. Used 2 chicken breasts, a cup of diced ham,  and everything else same as recipe. So if you are in the same position as me then it is still possible to make with a different sized dish. It was really tasty and I will make it again.

Very easy and yummy!  I also tried this with some variations in ingredients.  I omitted the chicken, doubled the ham and mixed in grated asiago cheese, finely diced red pepper, seasoned with a spicy Italian mix  and fresh chopped parsley!  Yum!  Not your grandma's ham and pasta casserole!

I made this casserole exactly as the recipe said and while quite good, it seemed a little bland to me. One thing I noticed in most of the other reviews was that they stirred everything together rather than layering it. I think that may have made it more flavorful. I will also add some salt and cracked pepper when I heat up the leftovers.

This was really good!  I followed the recipe pretty closely, but I didn't have cubed ham, so I used lunch meat and my swiss was slices.  I also didn't have seasoned bread crumbs, so I just sprinkled basil, oregano and garlic powder over it.  As I made it, it was a solid 4...so if I did it right, I guarantee it would be a 5.  I don't understand how anyone would find this dry.  It was great with the amount of sauce called for.  I didn't even mix it together, I spread it over the top as the recipe said.  I'll make this again.

I really liked this recipe and so did my boyfriend. I didn't have time to go to the grocery store so I had to substitute a few items. I used cream of mushroom soup, bergenost cheese (muenster/havarti style), and rotini pasta!  I did use 1.5 c sour cream and 1/2 cup milk  plus  1/2 c chicken broth, since I didn't have cream of chicken soup. I mixed it with all other ingredients and sprinkled with bread crumb mixture. loosely covered and man was this good!  I did add green onion. Next time I'll shop first and make as directed but I'm really glad I found this recipe, needed to use up chicken and ham.  Thanks  for posting.

Delish!  I used small cubed  cooked chicken, and good quality deli ham slices cut into bite pieces. It had all the flavor I would expect of a  chick cordon blue., and I even used cooper sharp cheese instead of Swiss.  Took me more like 35-40 min  to prep, but was worth it.  served with a side salad.

This is definitely a keeper! I followed other reviewers' suggestion of using 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of sour cream for the sauce. It could have been a little more creamy, so next time I'll probably use 1 1/2 cups of each and 2 cans of cream of chicken soup instead of one. I will also cover with foil to prevent noodles from drying out.  Other than that, it was very cheesy and delicious! My 90 year old grandfather even liked it. :)

My husband loved this and I will make it again.  I did my best to make it lower sodium and it still came out great -- low sodium Swiss Cheese/ham/soup,  and unsalted butter for the bread crumbs.  I used penne pasta instead of noodles.  I also used broiled chicken tenders that I prepared myself, seasoning with fresh ground pepper and basil flakes -- I broiled the chicken for only 9 minutes which made is just exactly done -- the meat was tender, juicy and not over cooked in the finished casserole.  I mixed the ham, swiss and chicken before putting it on top of the pasta.  followed directions and spooned the "sauce" mixture over the pasta/meat -- the end product had sauce and cheese distributed evenly throughout the whole dish.  Steamed broccoli and/or salad make perfect sides.  I am guessing that you can even add frozen peas or broccoli florets into the mix before baking if you want a one-dish meal.

I've made this casserole twice and did not change any of the ingredients.  My family loves it!  The only change I made was to the way the casserole was layered.  Adding the soup/sour cream mixture to the noodles and then topping with the ham/cheese made it creamier.  Other than that, excellent recipe!

this recipe is delicious I have shared this with a couple different people and instead of cubed ham and Swiss cheese I used lunch meat ham and Swiss cheese and cut it up myself to add a little more in not such "large" quantities the cheese melted wonderfully and there were no left overs!!! awesome loved it!

This was a hit with the whole family. I made it after Christmas to use up the last bit of turkey and ham. Definitely on our repeat list. Not only for the holiday leftovers, but to use with the original chicken and ham. The only difference I made, other than turkey for chicken, was the bread topping. I did not have bread crumbs on hand, which was a surprise. So I followed a previous reviewer and crumbled Ritz crackers instead in the butter. Worked out great! Absolutely keeper!

It was relatively easy and it was a hit! We don't eat a lot of salt so I would refrain from adding any additional next time because it was a bit salty. Love the crunch of the breadcrumbs!

This is a very good casserole.  All the flavor of chicken cordon blue without all the work of rolling all the chicken up.  I doubled the noodles, soup and cheese and mixed everything together instead of layering.  I make this all the time now!

Changed this up and used Chipotle Gauda and Chipotle Panko. Also used boars head can turkey instead of ham. Every one loved it!!  I've made it the traditional way and it's awesome wanted to experiment so I tried the Chipotle way. It does give a kick though so if you're not into spicy then stick with the original

With all the work that has to go into this I would think that just making the REAL deal would be easier. Would I make it again? Maybe! But this is just my opinion. Have Fun with whatever your choice is =)

Made 1/2 recipe.  Too cheesy, too salty.  We ate it, but I got rid of the recipe.

Made this last night. I used Campbell's cream of chicken with herbs and it gave it an amazing kick of flavor. I also used regular elbow macaroni and I did not use the sour cream. It came out delicious!!

Very nice, and fairly easy, good way to use rotisserie chicken and always have the ingredients on hand.  Makes a very nice special day-off dinner!!!

Easy to make and delicious!  Next time I make it I will probably mix the ham, chicken, etc with the pasta instead of layering it on top.  But it was still awesome!

I used some sour cream mixed with chives and garlic salt, regular soup. I mixed it all up together other than the topping. I also only put bread crumbs on half. I didn't have swiss cheese, so I used a 4 cheese mix and topped it with it. Turned out awesome and everyone loved it.

Hmmmmmm......so I don't know about this one.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was just ok.  The egg noodles seemed to make things a bit bland.  I should've known better and added some salt and pepper because it really needed it.  With a few tweaks this could be a solid casserole.

This was a pretty good way to transform chicken cordon bleu into a casserole.  Hubby thinks it loses some of the swiss cheese flavor, but I think the swiss is fine.  A nice easy meal.
