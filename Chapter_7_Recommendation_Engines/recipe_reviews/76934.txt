Fresh and lemon-y, the zest makes this salad sing.  I tweaked the recipe a bit, (real kalamata olives, citrus-infused olive oil, more seasonings.)  As I was taking it to a buffet for a large crowd, I bulked up the bowl by adding some green peas, roma tomatoes and a can of artichoke hearts.  A scant cup of leftovers made a nice lunch the following day.  A great addition to my salad repertoire.

This is a good recipe, since I love salade nicoise.  I would suggest one improvement:  marinate the cooked green beans in some of the salad dressing for a few hours before making the salad.  Then they will taste like part of the salad rather than cold beans added to it.

Great recipe.  Tastes just like the nicoise salad from a restaurant that I love.  I used kalamata olives instead, and left out the eggs and green beans.  Served over mixed greens instead -- was super easy.  Also, after an initial tasting, added a little more oregano and lemon zest.

Solid salad. I didn't use green beans, but served it over salad greens and cut up red and yellow peppers, halved grape tomatoes, and threw in some capers and anchovies. Pretty and VERY filling.

It was ok. I did not like green beans in this salad. To my taste they were overhelming.

Instead of tuna, I used leftover grilled salmon, leftover steamed green beans and I added a couple leftover baby red potatoes, quartered.  Also perked up the dressing a bit with more lemon, garlic and a little dijon mustard.  YUM!!!

Excellent salad! Easy to put together, healthy and perfect for lunch or a light supper. What more do you want? Great served with fresh green beans from the garden. Another winner from Pam Anderson!

This was great.  Next time I will double the vinegrette part of the recipe as I found it was a bit on the blah side even though the vinegrette itself was very tasty and went well with the salad.  Makes a great summer lunch!

Satisfying. Flavorful.  Nutritious.  Delicious.  Beautiful.  And perfect as is (except I prepared this as a composed, rather than tossed, salad over romaine lettuce).  That about covers it.

I didn't do the eggs or the green beans, I just served for a light lunch with crackers and sliced tomatoes.  I was good, but too much lemon flavor for my taste.  It was also dressed too heavily, so I will make less next time and use less lemon

I found the recipe and tried it because my husband dislikes mayo.  It is the only way I make tuna now.  It is fabulous as written, but I have also added feta cheese sprinkles, which tastes great.  I just mix in the green beans now.  Sometimes I skip the eggs.  I recommend it enthusiastically!

Excellent dish.  I couldn't find Great Northern Beans, so I used navy beans - I might try white kidney beans next time, as I felt the navy beans were a bit too small.  I added canned corn for some extra sweetness as well as some parsley, marinated artichoke hearts, and sliced avocado.  I omitted the olive oil, so I ended up using more lemon juice than suggested, as it wasn't flavorful enough for me.  This is a very refreshing and easy-to-prepare dish.

this was very, very good! I was looking to make something healthy and different for lunch and happened to have all the ingredients for this on hand. I put the tuna on top of a bed of torn romaine lettuce and tomato and added some feta cheese. My husband loved it too! This one's a keeper! thanks

This was delicious! I added 1 clove garlic + 1 teaspoon dijon mustard to the dressing to replace the "zing" of olives, which I did not have on hand. I look forward to trying this again and again.

Delicious!  I used chopped cucumber instead of green beans, left out the onions, and used more lemon juice/less olive oil.  It was really good!  Next time I'm going to add tomatoes and another can of beans.  I love salade nicoise but it takes so long to make so this recipe is great.

What a healthy, fresh summer salad! Rather than portioning it, I just mixed it all into one big bowl. I didn't use the lemon zest and I found the flavor to be perfectly lemony without it.

Delicious. I like the flexibility of this recipe in that you can use whatever vegetables you like. I used what I had on hand, tuna, black beans, cucumber, fresh tomatoes and artichokes in oil all spread over kale.  The oregano olive oil and lemon was a delicious dressing.

Absolutely loved the dressing. Seared some fresh peppered 
tuna and put on fresh baby lettuces with steamed haricot vert green beans, egg, kalamata olives.  Will definitely make this many times again. Thank you for posting

This was a good base recipe, but to make it five stars, I thought it needed tomatoes - both for taste and color.
Also, I used salmon rather than tuna because it's what I had on hand. The fish/bean/olive/onion mix was delicious!

Delicious and tasty! I substituted grilled shrimp I already had on hand (marinated it in some of this salad dressing first) and used kalamata olives (preference) . To make more of a substantial dinner, I added a quartered boiled red potato, tomato quarters,  and served all over a mixture of red leaf lettuce and arugula. Very filling, satisfying and healthy!! Will make again for sure.

Too many canned items that go un-cooked that left a weird taste.  It had a nice combination of flavors from the other ingredients, but it's just not a winner in our book.

Absolutely delicious. The lemon dressing is so much better than the vinegar based dressings I’ve had with other recipes. And I love the beans and olives. My husband added more salt to his and mine was perfect as is. This is a new staple recipe in our house.

The Nicoise Salad was delicious & easy!  I added the hardboiled egg as suggested & some Arugula on-hand. Very healthy & tasty??

I did make the salad exactly with the ingredients and it is delicious.  To reduce the potassium in the beans for kidney sensitive, all I did was drain and wash the beans thoroughly.

Very yummy!  My husband was leery with it having tuna (scared it would taste too fishy), but the lemon cut that taste, and he actually loved it!  The only thing I had to do extra was make more dressing, but I'd rather not have enough than have too much - I just made more??

The dressing was awesome!  I added some celery cucumber and HB eggs. Omitted the beans because I didn’t have any. Leftovers were great too

Delicious!  Needed salt. Followed other suggestions of added ingredients. Both kinds of olives. Put it over romaine lettuce. People helped themselves from a tray of all ingredients.

Made per Recipe.  Next time...I'll add a small amount of sugar to taste.  Take out the bitterness.

I found this to be a healthy version. Changes I made were using a smaller amount of olives and adding some fresh lemon juice for a little zing. It may seem sacrosanct,  but I even liked it warmed up in the microwave!

The salad is good if heated slightly and then add the hard boiled eggs.  I would probably use only a few green beans and serve with vinegrette over salad greens.
