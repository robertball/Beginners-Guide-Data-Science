This recipe was good.  I used fresh asparagus, used 1/2 cup sharp cheese, and 1/2 cup cheddar cheese.  I had to bake it longer than 20 mins, about 35 mins.  It was very rich tasting, I would even just use cheddar cheese next time.  But definitely worth cooking again.  Thanks!

I substituted bacon bits for slivered almonds and used fresh asparagus.  I cooked the dish for an extra 15 minutes, covering with foil for 12 minutes, to make sure the asparagus was cooked.  Ten minutes probably would have been sufficient as the asparagus turned out a little more cooked than I like.  The cheese "sauce" turned out like mashed potatoes.  It was okay but I probably won't make this again due to the consistency of the cheese and the lack of "depth" in this recipe.

I did modify this slightly by using fresh asparagus (I can't stand this particular veggie from a can) and it was all right. The cheese sauce came out a little thicker than I would have liked although the flavor was good.

This was a crowd pleaser I was asked to bring a vege to 'Friendsgiving' then the host's husband ask for asparagus. I have only grilled or roasted asparagus butbi thought try this way. I used fresh bc the thought of canned sounded dissapointing. I should added salt and pepper to the cheese sauce otherwise everyone loved it. And several people stood around and ate the remaining cheese with rolls!

Just a so-so side dish for us. Couldn’t ever get anyone to eat up the leftovers. Wouldn’t make it again, just because it wasn’t fantastic.

Disgusting. I really had high hopes. I used extra cheese because I love cheese but it didn't help. The sauce it's awful and the use of canned asparagus was awful.
