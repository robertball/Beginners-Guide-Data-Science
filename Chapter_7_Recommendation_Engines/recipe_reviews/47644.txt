This was like my Mom used to make.  I didn't have rose water, but used orange water and they were delicious & very special.  Thank you for posting the recipe!

Came out perfect. Yes, I ended up with too much of the nut mixture, but I just froze it for the next batch. Just like Great Grandma from Lebanon used to make. Took them to a Lebanese family dinner they were a huge hit. No one had made these since Great Grandma, and everyone said it was an exact match.

This recipe is really bad. I followed the instructions exactly and ended up with cookies that wouldn't cook all the way through without burning (too much shortening in the recipe) and WAY too much of the sugar/nut/rose water mixture.  I could have cut that part in half and still had too much.  There wasn't enough rose water included to even taste it in the finished cookie.  I recommend finding another recipe with better measurements.

I didn't like the dough in this version.  It lacked flavor and the texture could have been better (even with the semolina). I've searched the internet and there are some others that I think the dough would accomplish that. At the point where it says to add the hot water, I would do so gradually.  I added the whole cup and the dough was too soft.  It also says to let the dough sit. It probably should say to put it in the frig to stiffen it. Could be a great recipe with those kind of changes.

I left out the rose water and spices as my grandmother never used those in hers.  They turned out very good.  A little more delicate than I remember, but with a very nice taste.  I made w/ traditional date a well as walnut fillings.  Thanks for the recipe.   The one I have from my grandmother has no measurements on it.

could not even eat these, the recipe is so off. against my better judgement, I followed the recipe proportion of semolina to shortening and it was just way too much shortening. They baked so greasy and fell apart at the slightest touch.  I let them cool completely before I removed them from the sheet lined w/parchment.  Gross taste; just so greasy. Is there supposed to be all-purpose too? There are different grinds of semolina.  I used the finer grind that I use for Basboosa and ghroobah but this was unedible. Let it sit for an hour or more. also halved the amt. of nut mixture and still had plenty left over.
