This recipe is a winner. i have served this to over twenty differnt friends in the past two months and everyone said it was amazing. i did take advise from other reviews and pureed two cups of the soup after it had simmered before the corn and salsa. i also added more corn and tomatos to feed more people.

I followed the recipe exactly and it was pretty good. Next time I might add jalepenos or a spicier salsa for extra zip!

This soup is wonderful. The only thing I might try next time is to puree most or all of the soup before putting in the corn. Wonderful taste and easy to make.

Very yummy. Per other reviews I omitted a little of the milk to make it less liquidy. It had great flavor and no other changes were needed. I also added garlic. Yummy. Thank you. very easy to make too

I could have eaten it all myself!  I used chicken broth and hot salsa since I had it in my pantry.  I will definitely make it again.

This recipe was a perfect candidate for my crock pot once I sauteed the peppers and onions. I served the chowder in fresh-out-of-the-oven sourdough boules, and it was a meal fit for a king!

This is a fairly easy recipe to put together.  I enjoyed the the kick from the tomatoes and chiles, not a favorite of the kids, a good soup for adult taste buds.  Will make again for a family dinner with pepper cornbread.

After reading over the ingredient list, and knowing we would like this recipe, I made a double batch.  We tend to like spicy foods, so along with the green pepper I added a jalape√±o and poblano pepper.  I had homemade chicken stock that I used in placed of the vegetable stock.  Homemade salsa added a nice kick to the chowder.  My soup had a nice consistency, but for those wanting a thicker chowder, I would increase the flour to 5 TB for a single batch of soup and keep the milk portions as listed.  It does take a while for the cream cheese to melt down.  Don't rush things by increasing the the heat.  It will eventually melt and give the chowder a very nice creamy texture.  This recipe is definitely going in our soup rotation.

Thought it was pretty good.  I added extra vegetables and added cooked cubed potatoes as I like my soups hearty.  Thanks for the recipe, it is different.

I also thought that the consistency was a little thin. The flavor, however, is fantastic, and my picky husband enjoyed it for the most part....I just have to figure out how to make the tomato chunks smaller. We think it would be really good with fajita chicken added to it.

I added 1 chicken breast (chopped), LOTS of spicy peppers, replaced half the corn with creamed corn, and the BEST addition was a can of black beans, rinsed/drained.  Then I cooked it to smitherenes~ the husband and I polished it off in one lazy day of movie watching!   WONDERFUL recipe, thanks!

I think this idea has potential, but as is it was just okay-not much kick considering the zestiness inferred by the name.  I added a partial jalapebno to the onion at the beginning and followed the blender recommendations of others before adding the corn and salsa. I actually liked the flavor of the soup better previous to adding the last four ingredients. It seemed a peculiar method of thickening both with flour roux and a hefty amount of cream cheese; I'm not sure that the extra calories from that addition were worth it. Perhaps more hot pepper and whole tomatoes at the end would make this a little more substantive and satisfying, as it seemed rather scant amount of vegetables also (I doubled the corn).  Do make a fresh bread to accompany, as it is the saving grace, and quite tasty when dipped.

I usually refrain from reviewing/rating a recipe I've not used much, but this one turned out SO fantastically I just had to. I took it to a soup dinner and had comments from EVERYBODY who ate it, and most of them asked for the recipe (including one who is lactose-intolerant). A big crowd pleaser, and so easy!

I was real excited when I made this in my crock-pot as one of the other reviewers suggested.  I left it on high for about 2 hours and then on low until it was eaten up - about 1 hour later! I also added a can of creamy corn soup that I had purchased before I found this recipe.  I don't know how much of a difference that made - but the soup was wonderful I doubled it for 8 people - we had 9 ladies over & it was almost completely eaten - everyone loved it - and it was such a simple soup to make too!

Note: we still make this regularly and I don't add the soup in. I always make it in the crockpot and it always turns out delicious. I have found a lime cilantro salsa that gives the soup a delicious taste! If I do that, I use tomatoes with herbs or plain instead of with the chile peppers and it turns into a nice sweet soup - perfect as a side dish with fish.

5 for ease. 5 for taste.  Used a salsa verde and it was delicious. You‚Äôll have to whisk the cream cheeses in, otherwise it‚Äôs  chunky.  I served this in the bread bowls noted in the cooks notes. .   I thought the soup was plenty thick and I added another full cup of veggie stock.  I also doubled the salt and paprika.

This soup is awesome!!!  Granted, I did make several changes and additions after reading the reviews.  I doubled the recipe, added about three to four small yukon gold potatoes (diced and boiled).  I pureed about  a cup of the potato/pepper/celery mixture to thicken it up a bit.  I also added a can of drained and rinsed black beans and extra salsa (hot) to taste to give it more kick.  It would probably be great if you wanted to add a meat (like shredded chicken or sausage) but I like to feed my family at least one vegetarian meal a week, and this is very tasty without the meat.  Will definitely be adding this to my fall/winter soup rotation.

I made this for my customers a couple of weeks ago and used the low-fat plain yogurt to keep it nice and creamy. I had to be careful how spicy I made it since I'm cooking for a lot of people, but I would recommend it with some hot peppers or other type of heat sprinkled on top :)

It's ok. Decent soup but I couldn't eat to much of it. My husband and daughter refused to eat it however my parents loved it. It's too bad because I really thought I would enjoy it more than I did. I guess I will stick to regular corn chowders.

This chowder did not fit my expectation of a chowder.  Although the taste is nice it is just a bit too thin for my taste.  However, I will reheat tonight and try to add some corn starch to thicken it to my tastes.  Very simple to prepare though!

Good recipe.  I have cooked it both in a pot and in a crock pot good either way.

This is a good substantial chowder. Perfect hearty dinner on a snowy day, served with pepper bread.
