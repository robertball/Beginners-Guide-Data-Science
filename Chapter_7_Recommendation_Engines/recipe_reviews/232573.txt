Next time if I make it I will use potatoes instead of egg plant. I will stick with my eggplant pizza instead when using eggplant. Also added cumin and garlic powder after reading other reviews.

Probably won't make again. It helped the eggplant taste if you aren't a fan of eggplant but overall it was lacking flavor. It could have used taco seasoning. One of the least liked recipes I've made off this site. I was disappointed.

I used chorizo instead of ground beef. Kids and I liked it. Kids said it tastes like chili with eggplant.

I love eggplant and this was an easy hearty tasty recipe. Yes I did a little alterations. Some times I vary the cheese I add cayenne pepper and cumin to spice it up. I have used red peppers instead of green and use salsa as a condiment on the dish when serving. A keeper.

really enjoyed this. Can't wait to make it with all the review adjustments. This is a very good staple casserole that can be made so many ways. It is a keeper.

This is very good it just needs a little more spices...maybe some cumin and garlic powder. I added a little bit of sour cream for added texture.

After reading the other reviews I added cumin and cayenne. I served it with salsa and sour cream on the side. I cubed the eggplant served it with salad. We liked it better than I thought we would. It still seems to be missing something. I think I'll add a can of Rotel next time. This was easy to make and my hubs ate eggplant so I'm happy. Edited to add that I tossed in a can of Rotel after the fact. I'll update after we have the leftovers tomorrow night. It was better the second night this is another keeper.
