Delicious and perfectly crunchy. Only change from the recipe was to used seasoned salt in the crumbs and we cooked the chicken for an hour, since it wasn't quite thawed all the way. Next time, might use less milk with the egg to make it a little thicker.

The family loved it!  I took someone elses suggestion and mixed the spices in a separate bowl and sprinkled directly onto the chicken after dreading in the milk mixture.  (I added 1 TBSP of corn meal to the milk & flour...made it a little thicker)  Also, to the spices, I added 1/4 tsp onion powder, and a tsp of sugar to sweeten it up a bit!  Be sure to REALLY crunch up the Corn Flakes too, I even poured the remainder of the flakes on the chicken before popping in the oven.  I had REALLY huge bone in chicken breasts, (which I removed the skin), and an hour at 375 was perfect! Chicken was juicy and flakes were perfectly golden brown!!  Yummy.. Will add to our monthly rotation!!! Great with mashed potatoes, corn and corn bread....

It was decent but it lacked seasoning. I recommend putting the seasoning on the chicken then putting it in the milk mixture then cornflakes or after dipping it in the milk mixture add extra seasoning directly on chicken. I also did not use chicken breast but drumsticks. Overall it was good and if you're not using chicken breasts I recommend adding an extra 15 minutes baking time to get the corn flakes to be crispy on the chicken skin.

I enjoyed this recipe. Very simple. I used boneless, skinless breasts. Sprinkled Parmesan on the top before baking.

I'm trying to eat healthier. So I was googling a substitute for fried chicken. When I came across this recipe for baked fried chicken. I know right off the back that I was going to need more seasoning. Than the recipe called for. I Can't tell you how much seasoning I used because I didn't measure it. But can I tell you the following seasonings I used.(Paprika,pepper,seasoning salt,garlic powder and Ms. dash salt free original blend. I  seasoned the chicken breast and the milk mixture.I will be making this again but with a little more adjustments here and there.

This was really good. I put the cornflakes in my food processor and processed for a couple of seconds just to break flakes up a bit. Seasoned the milk and egg mixture. Did not use flour and did not need it. Everyone cleaned their plates! A keeper for sure!

I'll make it again but it REALLY needs tweaking. Don't ever mix dry ingredients like flour directly into liquid. I wasted a lot of time blending the eggs, milk, FLOUR, and especially GARLIC POWDER with my blender. Instead, the garlic powder needs to be thoroughly mixed in with corn flakes, not into the liquid.  By the time all was done, there was NO garlic flavor in the dish whatsoever. And really, no need for flour either. (For even better flavor, add a bit of melted butter into liquid)

I had two packages of chicken, thighs and legs. I doubled the recipe, and it came out just right. I am surprised how crispy it came out! Definately a keeper!

I love this recipe!  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with celiacs but it's great for those who are gluten sensitive and don't want to break the bank!!!

Sprinkled with seasoned salt after egg mixture for more flavor after reading some of the other reviews. Quick, easy and tasty.

My Mom used to make this for us when we were kids.  I wanted to make it for my family, so I found the receipe, and made it mostly as directed.  I did cook the chicken a little longer, it was not ready at 45 minutes.  Also, I added garlic powder, salt and peper to the cornflake mixture for a bit more flavor.  I will make it again, as it is very easy for a weeknight dinner, I think I will add chilli powder or cayenne pepper for a little bit of heat next time. The family enjoyed the tsty and crunchy chicken.

Absolutely wonderful!  If you have an air fryer, this is THE perfect “non” fried chicken recipe.

My husband only wants cornflake chicken now!  Seriously, I have to make this once a week for him - he just loves it!  I add a bit more seasoning like Frank's Red Hot powder and seasoning salt to add a bit of kick but even without those it's soooo good!

Easy and delicious. My kids liked the recipe.  Suggestion which I will do next time will be to cut chicken into thinner pieces or strips to increase the yummy crust flavor and crispness.  I also agree with others on adding seasoning after dipping.

I loved it. I just added about 1/4 cup grated parmesan to the cornflakes. I made sure I salt and peppered the chicken breast before I dredged them. It turned out great!
