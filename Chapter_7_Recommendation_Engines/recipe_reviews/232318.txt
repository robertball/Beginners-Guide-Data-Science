Delicious and so flavorful! I halved the recipe and used whipped cream cheese. I didn't want it real smooth, so I just mixed everything by hand...YUMMY! Thanks for sharing. :)

Followed the recipe exactly but rather than using a blender, I smashed all with a fork. Not big on guacamole but this version...LOVE IT!!!!

My family loved it!  The cream cheese added a wonderful flavor and creaminess, the salsa (I used fresh) and garlic the right amount of zing.  WIll definitely  make this again....and again!

My husband liked this a lot, I'll need to play with it a little and make sure my cream cheese is softer beforehand.

Kept right with the recipe for the ingredients, however I didn't use the blender, just mashed up myself.  It worked very well and was so easy.  Will make again.  The only reason for the 4 was that it didn't knock my socks off but well worth you trying.
