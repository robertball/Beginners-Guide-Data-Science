Great easy recipe. Like other reviewers, my tweaks included adding avocado and tomatoes. For the dressing I skipped the honey but added ground cumin and a bit of chili powder.

Beautiful color and flavorul.  The ratio of quinoa to dressing was off. I added almost another cup of Quinoa to balance the amount of dressing.  Next time I would just add half the dressing to flavor.

I added tomatoes and an avocado.  Next time I may cut back on the oil in the dressing and add a little vinegar
