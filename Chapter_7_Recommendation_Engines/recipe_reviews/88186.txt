This was a good and simple recipe and has potential to make for a very colorful presentation but I needed to adjust the cooking times. Maybe it was the pan I used, but after 10 minutes of simmering, my orzo was not done but the liquid was gone. So I added about 1/4 cup more broth and simmered for another 6 minutes. That overcooked the shredded vegetables so next time I make this--and there definitely will be a next time--I will plan to simmer for 15 minutes with extra broth, but not add the veggies until there's about 8 minutes left. That will leave the dish fresh and colorful. It also needed salt and pepper with the thyme.

Outstanding! Can I give this recipe 6 stars??? We had this with dinner last night and absolutely LOVED it! The only thing I added was a couple of squeezes of lemon juice from the lemon I had zested. Not only is this dish yummy, but it's also quite healthy. Thank you and thank you twice for submitting this one! I will be making it again and again!

This was colorful, I'll give it that - and certainly nutritious too, given the addition of the carrots and zucchini. As for flavor, however, if it wasn't for the lemon flavor there wouldn't be much flavor at all.

This was a delicious recipe. I used chicken broth for the liquid and 1 tbsp fresh chopped thyme, as well as ground pepper. As others suggested, I added chopped carrot and zucchini to the orzo with about 8 minutes left in the cooking time. I found the 14 ounces of liquid was enough, as the chopped veggies created enough extra liquid for the pasta to cook and the veggies were tender, not at all soggy. I left the top on the pot - which helped retain adequate liquid to cook the orzo.

This meal makes a wonderful light lunch or side dish! We were really impressed. To accompany the lemon zest I added two tablespoons of juice from the same lemon, and the flavours blended really well. Slightly tangy, but delicious. Next time I will increase the amount of carrot and zucchini, and possibly make the additions of eggplant and onion to make it even better.

DEE-LICIOUS! This is great! I went ahead and toasted the orzo in oil for two minutes and then I added just the veggie broth. I used a 14 oz. can plus a tad from another can in fear the liquid would all be absorbed. I cooked like this for 7 minutes. After the 7 minutes I added everthing else and cooked for 8 more minutes. This was just scrumtious. I served with "Grilled Lemon Chicken" from AR. What a combo! Thanks for sharing :-)

I HAD THE EXACT SAME PROBLEM AS THE OTHER REVIEWER.  ORZO NOT COOKED; LIQUID GONE.  ADDED MORE LIQUID AND COOKED LONGER AND VEGGIES WERE OVERDONE.  BUT STILL DELISH.  JUST FOLLOW HER ADVICE.  MORE LIQUID AND COOKING TIME AND DON'T ADD VEGGIES TILL ALMOST COOKED. I DIDN'T HAVE ANY ZUCCHINI SO I USED FROZEN PEAS.  I THINK CHOPPING THE VEGGIES INSTEAD OF SHREDDING WOULD BE BETTER AS FAR AS TEXTURE GOES BUT PROBABLY WOULDN'T BE AS PRETTY.

YUM! This turned out way better than I expected and received full compliments from hubby.  It tastes just as good using lime as it does lemon.  I didnt have any veg broth (island life!) and thus made my own; I used some stock and a little asparagus condensed soup as the base, and then added a tin of "salad vegetables" (baby carrots, beans and peas etc) all mashed up.  Turned out a treat.  Will make again. Cheers!

This was very, very good "LitleLisa1"! I used the juice of a lemon instead of the zest only because my kids aren't crazy about zest. I made another side from this site which called for pine nuts, for which I subbed with sunflower seeds and I mistakingly placed them in this dish instead. No matter, they added a nice crunch and this recipe was a success and loved by all. Thanks so much!

The best part about this recipe is how easy it is to make. When I added the  zucchini and carrot to the pot I thought it looked like way too much but the orzo plumps up quite a bit when you cook it, and the proportions turned out just right. This is a nice side dish, but it was slightly bland. Not a show-stopper but I would make it again.

I liked it a lot.  My husband thought it was OK and different.  I could really taste the lemon zest.  We used freshly grated parmesan cheese, nothing better than that!

This recipe, or my variation of it, has become a staple side dish in our household.  We love the flavor of the lemon with the orzo and use this as a base recipe that we adjust to suit our tastes.  I don't care for a strong thyme flavor, so I use a lesser amount and also use chicken broth most often because I have it on hand.  The chicken broth gives it a great flavor.  Our favorite additions to this recipe are mushrooms, onions, and fresh spinach. At the end of the cooking process, I stir in fresh spinach leaves into the hot pasta.   I have made the orzo a few times with just the spinach, onions, and mushrooms and it is delicious.  Thanks for sharing!  :)

This recipe was a good start.  I sautéed a small onion and diced mushrooms and added them when I added the zucchini.  I also shredded a roasted chicken and cut up 2 tomatoes and added the them at the end.  I CANNOT wait to make this again.

This was actually amazing!!! Instead of shredding the vegetables, I chopped them into pieces. I just like seeing the pieces of veggies. I didn't have zucchini on hand so I substituted the zucchini with yellow squash. I also had green beans to use up so I added those in along with the carrots and squash. I would say normally you will need more liquid than just the one (14 oz.) can of broth. I cooked up 1 1/2 cups of pasta and I think I used about 2 cans of broth. I just judged how many cans to use based off the amount of liquid left in the pot and how done the pasta was. The end result though was spectacular. I pretty much followed the recipe again just substituting some veggies. I would make this again in a heartbeat and it's super easy to make!!

I followed the advise of others and used a little extra broth and added my vegies late.  I also added some cooked grilled chicken to use this as a main dish.  My husband and I both thought this was great.  It is flavorful yet light.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a good recipe for orzo - we love orzo !!
I did not have a zucchini - just used carrots.
It's a nice recipe to experiment with and use different veggies and flavors.  Thanks !

Another good orzo recipe! I like the subtle citrus flavor. It isn't overpowering, so it makes a nice accompaniment to lots of dishes. It's a good side dish to keep in mind. Thanks for sharing!

Amazing! I used chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth, and added 1/4 cup of white wine when almost all of the liquid had been absorbed. Thanks for the recipe, it's wonderful:)

To be honest, I wasn't sure all of the different flavors were going to work so well together.  The lemon is subtle, but makes the dish light and refreshing.  I served this with lemon herbed chicken, also from this site, and it was great.  We had leftovers of the rice, and it was just as good the next night as a side dish to our pork.

This recipe is really good!  I omitted the carrots the first time I made it and used chicken broth instead of vegetable but otherwise stayed on track with the recipe.  I've made it again without any of the veggies and that was also really good!  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was fine, I just don't think I really care for orzo much. And I would have preferred the zucchini and carrots matchstick style as opposed to shredded.

Yummy! We had this for dinner as a side for the Honey Grilled Chicken also on this site. We will definitely make this again! The only change we made was to put a squeeze of juice from the zested lemon.

I love a great risotto, but this didn't really do it for me.  I felt like it just tasted like a weird, lemony chicken broth.  It kind of reminded me of wild rice - don't really know why.  I think it had something to do with using vegetable broth as the base instead of chicken broth and wine.  Also, I usually make risotto using arborio rice (because it's cheaper), but this time I went for the orzo pasta.  Maybe I'm just not an orzo fan.  All in all, I won't be trying it again.

Excellent and easy side dish.  This comes together in a snap!  I just fine diced the veggies and I did use chicken broth instead of veg.  Really fresh and light.  We loved it!

Nice.  I did add more spices, though, as I thought it'd be bland as is.  I also added another can of chicken broth and some chopped bacon, and used oriechette pasta since I couldn't find orzo--obviously I need to buy more!  With the added flavor from the Montreal Steak Seasoning and the bacon, this was very flavorful.  thanks for the recipe!

This was really good and different.  I followed the recipe pretty close except that I used chicken broth.  I didn't have a problem with the orzo getting completely cooked, but additional cheese would make it a little more interesting.

This is a good recipe, but a little bland as written.  I have made it many times, in many variations, my favorite being the following:  substitute broccoli for zucchini, add a pinch of salt and onion powder with the vegetables, use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, and add the juice of the lemon in addition to the zest.  Delicious!

I made this a main dish by adding chicken to it. I also added 3T fresh chopped parsley, mushrooms, broccoli, and cooked the orzo in chicken broth instead of veggie broth. Yum!

It was good but once I added garlic salt,lemon pepper, the juice and zest of two lemons, and chopped parsley and basil instead of thyme( I didn't have any on hand), it had more flavor.  My husband really likes it.

Absolutely delicious! All five of my children loved it but even more suprising was my husband loved it. I did change one thing, I added the juice of the lemon as well as the zest. I think it would have been only a 4 star without it.

Great recipe. I have made this quite a few times now, and just chop the zucchini and carrot instead of shredding them, and they come out tender (not soggy) every time. I always use more than 1 of each to make it more healthful. Having a quality broth makes this dish taste much better. I use 1-2 tsp dried thyme in place of the fresh, and add black pepper as needed. Also, as an onion lover, I tried adding them to this dish and I did not like the result. Adding some fresh, chopped spinach was a nice addition though. Overall, very good, very easy.

The only substitution I made to this recipe was to use chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I cut my carrots and zucchini into matchsticks instead of shredding them.  The end result was very attractive and colorful.  The lemon flavor wasn't intense enough for me, so I sqeezed some juice over at the end, and I think next time I would leave off the parm.

Yum! This recipe is an amazing base for total customization. I was pleased to find this low calorie recipe, and bulked it up with frozen artichoke hearts. The pasta starch combines nicely with the broth to trick your taste buds into believing this dish has cream. A slight variation on the original, that I will try next time: a touch more broth, for a little more sauce, and served on top a bed of fresh spinach leaves.

I followed this recipe exactly, and found it rather bland, as did my family...I was disappointed after all the good reviews.  I had quite a bit leftover, which I made into chicken noodle soup.  It was great in the soup!

Wow! Way too much thyme for me. Perhaps the recipe is a misprint and should read "fresh" thyme? I should have gone with my instinct and reduced the amount. Overall, this recipe has potential and I will try it again with adjustment for the thyme. I used chicken broth because I didn't have any vegetable broth.  I left the lid on for cooking the orzo and the amount of liquid and cooking time seemed perfect to me; no trouble there. Give this recipe a try...I think it's worth it.

Easy and delicious!!! I didn't have any fresh lemon, so used dried zest. Good, but fresh would have been better.

I wanted this more for a main course so I tripled the veggies (put in half way through) and squeezed half a lemon. Also used fresh parsley rather than thyme as had on hand. Tasty and light.

This wasn't my favorite recipe.  When it was almost finished cooking, I taste-tested and felt it wasn't very lemony at all.  I added lemon juice which helped a bit, but overall it turned out just "okay."  Next time I will serve as a side-dish perhaps to some fish with veggies, rather than the main course.

This was good, but maybe it was lacking something? I didn't have any zucchini, but I added some onion. It ran out of liquid before it was cooked, so I added lemon juice and then needed to add some water as well, so I added a little chicken paste for flavor. I also seasoned with salt and pepper, and used parsley instead of thyme because thats what I had. I might try it again with the zucchini. We will probably eat it again, but it wasn't necessarily a favorite.

If you have veggie haters in your family, you definitely need to shred the zucchini & carrot. Haven't tried it chopped, but prefer shredded anyway (I do like veggies though).  Next time I'll try adding more veggies and maybe a 'light' tasting bean for a bit more protein for a complete vegetarian meal.

Pretty good...doubled the recipe...went heavy on the garlic, added ~1/2 c water extra, which was unnecessary, and added a cube of vegetable bullion along with salt and pepper...sprinkled just a touch of dried thyme in at the end and left off the Parmesan cheese, since it was a tad on the salty side with the added bullion.  Lemon was the predominant flavor, but definitely not tasteless.  Added the veggies with ~7 min left.  Used ~4 carrots and 2 large zucchini, shredded.  Yum.

While not THE most flavorful dish I have ever made, this one was great as a side dish, and didn't over power the meat I prepared. I threw in 4 cloves of garlic, vs 1. I also left out the thyme, just because I don't care for it. I'm not sure how a few of the reviews didn't end up with enough liquid- I followed everything (other than the garlic & thyme) to a "T", and it came out great. Thank you for sharing!

Wow...Awesome recipe. We are new vegetarians and have found a weekly entree! My picky 2 yr old liked it too! Added a bit of fresh spinach like another reviewer, 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1, and obviously added salt & pepper. I used vegetable boullion instead of canned--it's waaaay better. Try Rapunzel brand found at healthfood store-all organic/vegan ingredients. Did not make 4 servings..increase ingredients if you want larger portion sizes..Thanks LitleLisa1!!

Good! I cut down on the lemon zest and added some shrimp, but other than that followed it exactly and it came out great. This would be better as a side dish rather than a main dish.

Perfect base for a main dish!  I doubled the recipe, added a can of diced tomatoes (w/liquid), used chicken broth, lemon juice, and added cooked shrimp.  Fantastic!  Delicious healthy dinner!

I changed things a little so maybe if I followed the exact directions thingswould have been different. Here's the way I did this. I boiled the orzo until it was almost done, drained then set aside. Then I started cooking the veg. in the oil and lemon. Just as the veg was getting tender, I added the orzo and some chicken stock and continued to cook until the orzo was ready. I added small amounts of stock as I went to get the perfect consistency.

This was really delicious!  I made it pretty much as written, except I added a yellow squash that I had, and the juice from the zested lemon.  There was just the right amount of liquid to cook the orzo, from the broth and the vegetables.  I have a ton of fresh lemon thyme, so I used that, which probably made it a little more lemony, but it was delicious!  Will definitely make again, thanks for a great recipe!

We really enjoyed this, even though we changed it a bit.  First we added the juice of the lemon to the liquids.  Also, we added about 3/4 teaspoon to cook the orzo in.  Next we didn't have zucchini so we added a second carrot and 1 1/2 cups of chopped uncooked spinach.  Delicious!

I'm giving this five stars, because I loved it, my husband, not so much. It was a little to different for him. I loved the light taste, and the lemon in the back ground. Thanks! really enjoyed this.

This orzo was very delicious. After reading some reviews, I change little bit the cooking directions. I cooked the orzo with garlic in the broth 5 mn before adding the shredded vegetables and cooked another 10mn. Thank you for posting this recipe.

Quick, easy to make, and a nice change from the usual.  Don't cook the orzo too long, it will become a big pile of mush.

Was very good.  Suggest chopping and preparing ingredients so they can be thrown in when appropriate.  Moves quick once you get going.

You HAVE to try this one!  I followed a couple other people and added the veggies half way through so they wouldn't get mushy, but otherwise, followed the recipe as is.  Everyone loved it.  It was a great side to a light meal.  I served it with fish/pork chops and steamed broccoli.  I will make this again -- for sure!!  Thanks!

Hmmm, sorry, I just found the lemon to be overpowering here - and I even doubled the recipe and still used only 1 lemon's worth of zest.

Nice! My zucchini got a little more done than I  like it, so I added more at the end. Next time I'll wait on it and add all of it later. Great flavor, thanks!

This was really good.  It was easy to make, and my family really liked it.  I used extra veges: 1 shredded zuchinni, 1 cup diced asparagus, and 1 cup frozen carrots & peas.  I also added about 1t black pepper.  It was really tasty, and a great way to use up extra veges.

This may be five stars cubed! I used spinach instead of zucchini but it really lends itself to a variety of veggies. I wasn't paying attention to how long it cooked, but I did have to add extra water. Also, as others suggested, I added some of the lemon juice. Thanks!

Excellent - made exactly as the recipe is written, except I didn't have any thyme so I left that out. Cover when simmering and you won't have any problems with undercooked pasta.

This was a tasty and simple recipe. I also experienced the problem with too little liquid...it was easy enough to fix considering that I had extra broth on hand. Just keep that in mind when purchasing ingredients. Other than that, it was great.

I read the reviews and cooked mine with the lid on in order to avoid running out of liquid before the orzo was cooked. As a result, I had the oppostie problem! The orzo was done, but the pot was still full of liquid. In order to try to avoid draining out all the flavour from the broth, I cooked it longer with the lid off, so it was a little overdone. I don't really see that the parmesan (and I used good parmesan) added to the dish, so next time I will leave it out. A great base recipe that I will play with and adapt to suit. Thanks.

This was very tasty.  I took several suggestions from various reviewers and it turned out delicious.  I diced the vegetables fine instead of shredding, used chicken broth for a dash more flavor and added 2T of fresh lemon juice.  I kept the lid on while cooking and periodically checked it until the liquid had been absorbed.  The addition of parmesan as the final step is delicious.  Remember that this is a light tasting side dish and is supposed to compliment the main entry.  It's not supposed to be assertive and some may feel it's rather bland.  Not at all, if you appreciate its simplicity!

Very yummy.....my family loved it!  Although next time i would just cut down on the amount of thyme. I would probably use 1/2 T instead but very easy and quick to make.

It was delicious.  I added extra sauted garlic and about half a sauted onion.  If cooked with the lid on, the one can of vegetable broth was plenty. Everyone liked it.

It was very good, but I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth(didn't have any)& chopped rather then shedding the vegetables based on other reviews.   I also added shredded chicken to make it a meal.

This was great! I didn't have zucchini so I added broccoli and marinated artichokes. The artichokes added an extra zing! Also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Had great flavor! Will definitely make this again!

I love this recipe and have made it many times.  I did change a thing or two. 1) Used yellow squash, zuc and carrot for more color.  Chopped fine instead of shredded.  2) Juiced the lemon and put the juice in with the broth.  3) Added a little thyme.  Put carrot in first with orzo to sear then add 1/2 the squash for the 2 minutes, then the rest with the broth and lemon juice.  Never takes longer than 15 minutes.  Stir often.   The addition of the lemon juice makes this a 5!  Yummy side!

Loved this recipe! I added a tablespoon of lemon juice along with some coconut milk at the end to make it a bit creamier.

This was really good. I used couscous instead of orzo, lemon juice instead of zest, fresh basil instead of thyme, way more garlic, salt and pepper, and I added an onion and shrimp.

I added more garlic and dried ground thyme. I also used chicken broth and left the lid on the pot. I added about 1/2 cup of water, and my boyfriend and I both enjoyed it.

It is my first time preparing orzo and this was a quick and easy recipe. However, I felt the lemon zest gave it a sweet taste that I didn't enjoy very much and felt that one tablespoon may be too much thyme for such a strong spice. Probably, should have also follow the other reviews reccs and cook the orzo with the veggie broth before adding the vegetables.

Super delicious. I have never had orzo before but always wanted to try it. I followed the recipe to the T with a few changes. I added chopped sweet red pepper and I used lemon juice instead of zest. Also to be healthier I only put the cheese on each plate, thus using less. Per other reviews I cooked the veggies first, then the orzo and combined to heat through before serving. I only gave this 4 stars because I think it would have been quite bland had I only used zest. I will definately be making this again. Thank you for sharing.

I'm sorry to say that I followed the directions to a T and was very disappointed with this dish.  The vegetable broth doesn't do enough to give this dish flavor as it was very bland.  Definitely a "no-go" dish for us.  Perhaps Chicken Broth and some other seasonings would help.

Ok, but lacks some flavor. I will make this again but I would add some sort of spice; not sure what. I did add frozen peas to the mix also. Zesting the lemon was a near failure; maybe my grater is junk! Didn't get as much zest as I felt the recipe volume called for.

This was really good!  I realized too late that my carrots were no longer good, so I used 2 zucchini, which still worked well!  This recipe would also make a great base for other dishes!  I added tuna to the leftovers today, which was really good!!

This was SOOO good! I made just a few changes. I used chicken broth rather than vegie broth, and each time I have made it I have thrown what vegetables I have on hand. My husband loved it too. It is very light yet. Past few times I made it I haven't even added the thyme and parm. Infact  I don't think I'll ever put thyme in it again. I also squeezed some of the lemon juice in as well...

I played with the proportions in this a lot.  I used 1.5 cups of orzo (after I'd added the grated zucchini/carrot, I noticed that there was way more veggie than pasta, it seemed off, so I quickly toasted up another half cup of orzo), increased the broth to 20 ounces, increased the garlic to four large cloves, increased the Parmesan to about 1/2 cup and (as suggested by other reviewers) added juice from half the lemon and a teaspoon of fresh ground sea salt at the end.  It turned out really well (though I felt like too much of the lemon zest flavor came through).  I'm giving this four stars because I feel like if I hadn't made the alterations that I had, it would've been a little bland and unbalanced.  I will definitely make this again-with the same proportions I used this time, but with about half the amout of zest.

The flavors were subtle, but I paired this with Chicken Marsala and loved it!  A delicious and creamy compliment to the chicken, and my S.O.-- who wasn't at all excited about the zucchini-- had to have seconds.

Great side dish. I used only zucchini, diced and cooked that for two minutes before continuing with the past. I had fresh oregano on hand instead of thyme--awesome!

i don't know if meg or rachel rae came up with this first but i know this is almost identical to a recipe in one of rachel's books. i find the carrot added a sweetness to the dish that i didn't like so i made it the next without carrots and really enjoyed.

Awesome stuff that the whole fam loved -- just be sure to double this recipe! There are four of us and we were fighting over the last little bit! Next time I'll add some more veggies.  I also added 1 c white wine with the orzo -- nice!

I make this all the time and every time my picky husband tells me he loves it. I have forgotten the cheese at the end and it didn't make a huge difference. I don't add the thyme either, but that is just because we never have fresh thyme on hand. I am sure it is even better with it!

YUM!! I'd never cooked with orzo before, and to be honest I thought this dish was going to be pretty blah. I started to panic halfway through that it wouldn't be enough as a main dish to feed my family. But it turned out fabulous and was very filling. A great comfort food. I'm really looking forward to making this again when the weather gets yucky.
I substituted dried thyme for fresh, and added a pinch of salt. It was great. Thanks for sharing!

I made this instead of a typical Greek rice pilaf to serve with a Greek dinner I was making. I added in a bit of oregano. I used yellow zucchini instead of green because that was all I had. I also added in a bit of lemon juice and salt + pepper. I only added in a bit of the cheese, probably half of what the recipe called for.I really enjoyed this and didn't find it bland with the addition of flavors.

Mmmm - yummy, fast, and easy.  I love the tangy flavor resulting from thyme, lemon, and garlic.  I did as others recommended and added 2 Tbsp. lemon juice (in addition to zest), I used a little extra broth, and I added the veggies halfway through cooking.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Delicious!  As I began to get ready to make this, I realized that I actually didn't have carrots in my fridge (normally do!), but my heart was set on this, so I decided to make using some diced mushrooms and yellow zucchini.  Diced each as opposed to grating and used chicken broth since I had a carton to use up.  Along with lemon zest, I also added fresh lemon juice, from about half a lemon.  I didn't have any fresh herbs, but decided to throw in some dried oregano (about 1 tsp) as I knew this would complement our pork souvlaki nicely.  GREAT, nice subtle flavour of lemon, looking forward to leftovers for lunch!

I really enjoyed this dish. I loved the lemon flavor. I didn't use the lemon zest but two tablespoons of lemon juice. Otherwise I made it true to the recipe. My wife didn't care for it do to the lemon (she's not a big lemon fan). However I will most definately make it again.

I added an extra crooked neck squash and some frozen chopped spinach to up the veggie content even more, and replaced the zest with lemon juice as recommended by another reviewer.  My 3yr old and 1yr old didn't even notice the veggies there.  We'll definitely make this again.  :)

I loved the lemon zest in this.   I do add about 1/4  cup more of chicken broth  than the recipe suggests so that pasta cooks through.  Very good taste.

Delicious.  It was a little too moist initially, but after sitting about 10 minutes, it was perfect!  A great way to sneak in veggies!

This was okay but far from great.  Definately bland tasting.  I think this recipe would need a lot of extras to liven up the taste so it is probably easier to just use a different one.

Yummy!  I don't think I added enough lemon zest since mine tasted more like the broth.  Great side dish though.

I thought this recipe was excellent.  It had a little sweetness to it, was great served with baked salmon and fresh asparagus.

This is an excellent dish for the family! My 1 year old and 4 1/2 year old love it! Great way to sneek in the veggies! Also, nice alternative to plain rice or pasta.

This recipe is just wonderful.  I chopped the vegetables instead of grating, and I used a little less thyme (i don't care much for it) and I added it with the vegetables.

I didn't have any problems with the amount of liquid or the cooking time, but when I make this again I won't add the orzo before the broth.  That made it stick to the pan.
