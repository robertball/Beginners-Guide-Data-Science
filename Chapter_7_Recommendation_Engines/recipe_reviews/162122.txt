I am a bartender (4 years running) and this is the generic version of this drink. Improved recipe: 1.5 ounce Blue Curacao, .75 ounces Malibu, fill the rest 1/4 full with pina colada mix, and the other 3/4 pineapple juice. It tastes MUCH better. If you need strength taken off the drink, add in a (small side of jigger) of bar syrup/ sugar water.

It's too strong.  I tried doubling the pineapple juice which helped, but it may have need a little more.  It was very good otherwise.

It was okay, but adding 2oz. tonic water to the other ingredients made it very good, and less "potent".

I gave it four stars because I had to back off the rum by half. It all depends on how strong you like the drink. I'm a light weight! Great recipe and drink!
