I was very much looking forward to making this recipe and have been hyping it up over the last week. I don't know where it went wrong, or if I did anything incorrectly (I for one believe I followed the book to a tee), but this thing turned out TOO Fluffy! I Didn't think that would be an issue you could even have, but the finished product resembles pumpkin seafoam more than a chiffon.  The whipped cream, upon dolloping, SUNK into the depths of my 9x13 pan. I hope to god none of you have this same issue, but for what I know, this issue resigns in the recipe.
