I've been making this recipe for years. Make sure to bake it until it starts turning golden. After putting the toppings and cheese on top it goes back into the oven until bubbly and golden. Your pizza turns out delicous and crispier this way. The crust is better with herbs and garlic added to it also.

If you're on a gluten-free diet, there are many pizza crust options out there that require A LOT of work or time to prepare.  
This is great, because it gives those of us to whom gluten is restricted a quick and easy way to enjoy  pizza!

Really good! I wasn't to sure about this recipe. My 4 year old is on a wheat free diet and I was in need of ideas!! I added italian seasoning and garlic powder in the rice!! Also after I put the toppings on I put it back in the oven for 25-30 minutes! Very good!! :)

first, you have to remember gluten free crusts won`t be exactly like wheat. Considering this, I thought it was very good, and wasn`t as squishy or complicated as other versions I`ve tried. And it didn`t requuire my more expensive wheat replacement mix! Wonderful!

It is what is is, a rice crust.  It was made for my GF son, but we all tried a bit.  It was soooo good!  I can see adding different seasonings and meats.  I baked the crust for twice the time, put sauce and toppings on, and then cooked until the cheese was hot and bubbly.  Everyone agreed the taste was very good, even though it is not a "normal" pizza crust.

This was a great and different alternative to a flour/shortening crust! I actually used it to make a veggie pot pie..and it worked great! I was worried about it, but surprised and happy to find the end result SO good! It has a different taste and texture..so keep that in mind. I did use spices while cooking my rice and added more when mixing the egg and cheese in. I baked it for a few mins. before filling with veggie mixture and adding a "top" crust...and sprinkled cheese on top of that when it had 4 min. left to bake. A trick I learned...to get the crust to form for this I had a bowl of clean water and dipped my hands in and dried them off before forming (otherwise it would stick and not mold for a pot pie crust). That really worked and helped me out so much! Have fun..this is great and my children and I hope to make the pizza next! :)

I was not a big fan of this.  I don't know why, but it did not turn out very well at all.

It was very interesting.  Not bad, just interesting.  Maybe I did it wrong, are you supposed to put it back in the oven after the toppings are on?

I was pleasantly surprised how good this was! I made it for my gluten free husband and I figured I would have it too since I didn't feel like making a separate pizza for me. The only addition to this recipe was a tsp each of dry basil and oregano and a sprinkle of garlic salt. Thank you so much for one more way to have a gluten free meal.

I thought this was not good when topped with "my favorite pizza toppings." Rice does not go with pizza toppings at all.

I thought this turned out well. I also doubled the bake time on the crust and then baked it again after I added toppings. I was worried about it staying together, but it held for the most part - I think next time I will bake it even longer before I add ingredients.

Had leftover pieces for breakfast. It was fast and would have been faster if rice was cold already. I baked the crust longer than 4 mins. I continued to bake after toppings were added.
I would not use juicy toppings straight on this. I put mushrooms in frying pan first, cooked then added to pizza. I tried many GF flour pizza doughs. I liked this way better. Going to be a staple on Friday.
This uses staples I always have in the house. Sorghum flour cost $28 for 2 small bags made the pizza dough and hated it! This is a winner by a landslide!

My mother used to make this crust when I was small. Brought back wonderful memories. It's very filling too!
