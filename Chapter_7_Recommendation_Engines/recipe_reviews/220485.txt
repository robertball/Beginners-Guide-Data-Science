This is truly a 5 star recipe! Only change was a small increase in the mayo. Prepared it for a group of 25 people and they all raved about it. I now have the assignment to be "the official potatoe salad maker" for the group. Make sure it has time to chill thoroughly. Grace

This was tasty. I cut the recipe down to 6 since I didn't need so much. I skipped the eggs because I'm not a fan of them in potato salad. This was nice. I've never used green olives in potato salad before. I enjoyed it but my family wasn't thrilled with the green olives. I'll make this again. Thanks!

Great recipe - and easy enough to add what you like and leave OUT the ingredients you don't care for -  to customize the potato salad for your family/gathering's tastes. Made a 1/2 batch and my husband and I ate on it for 4 days! Would be great for a potluck-sized gathering.

This recipe needs a makeover. Cut the tater to 5 lbs, 3 eggs in lieu of 6 (but if you are a egg head then use 6) Use 1 1/2 cups of mayo. I also added 1/2 cup of cooked crumbled bacon

Used small red new potatoes cut in fourths and boiled with skins on until fork tender. Cut recipe down for about 4 people. Added paprika to sauce to taste. Then sprinkled more paprika on top to garnish. So great!

Ez and good!  Got positive reviews from guests.  Tastes better after an overnight (or two) chill.  The vinegar makes it.  I doubled the mayo.
