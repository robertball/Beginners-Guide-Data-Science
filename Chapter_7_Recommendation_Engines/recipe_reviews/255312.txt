Maybe savory oatmeal like this is an aquired taste. I'm sorry to give this a bad rating, but I did not like it. The vegetable seasoning was just not good in it. Just salt and pepper would have been better. I added some sundried tomatoes to give it a bit more flavor, and that helped. I ended up adding some crumbled sausage and a sprinkle of parmesan. I was able to eat half the bowl.
