For more flavor, don't use flour. Use 'self rising corn meal mix' and just omit your baking soda and salt. Do make sure to add some extra sugar to taste. 1-2 TBL. is perfect. You don't need a lot of oil for frying, if you have a good nonstick pan. These corn cakes went great with our white beans!

Tasted great and was quick. Only suggestion would be to indicate that the whole kernel corn NOT be drained!

I tried this recently as a main dish-with sesame asparagus and potatoes-it was wonderful.I didn't use anything sweet like maple syrup with it-instead I made it more savory by adding caramelised onions to the batter.My entire family loved it.Thanks!

These were a 4.5, until we started dipping them in maple syrup, at which point they become a 10!  They really are fast, easy, and delicious.  I didn't even need any fat to cook them, they slid right out of my nonstick skillet.  Also, the last review says not to drain the corn -- I drained mine, and they turned out OK, maybe they're just a little thinner with the liquid included, mine were a pancake-batter consistency.  They're pretty bland if eaten plain, definitely use the butter or syrup.  Great breakfast treat, or side dish!

These are the best! I make them all the time and the kids love them. When I have leftover corn, I use that instead of the canned stuff and add extra milk.  Maple syrup or honey goes great with these.

This was a very good recipe.  I cook on a gas stove and the cakes came out very fluffy.  I substituted regular milk with soy milk and used only 1/4 tspn salt and 1/4 tspn fresh ground pepper and I thought they came out just fine.  To be extra decadent you can fry them in butter mixed with  canola oil.  These make for a hearty meal.  I needed a salad on the side to balance them out...but was too lazy to make one admittedly.

I just made these for dinner (hoping they will make it to dinner!) and they are so good!  The only thing different I did was to use 1 1/2 cups self rising flour and left out the baking powder and salt.  I think 2 cups of flour would be way too thick.  They are addicting and I will be making them often.  Try them with some sour cream on top...yummm!

These are awesome. I would recommend adding a couple of tablespoons of sugar to them. Other than that, perfect.

I think we found a new Christmas tradition! I Used stone ground corn meal mix and DID add 2 tbs of sugar... I didn't have any cramed corn on hand so I just used a can of semi drained corn =-) SO GOOD

These were exactly what I was looking for.  We used to have these when we were young and I haven't had them forever.  I made them with added sugar and they were perfect.

Wonderful, very kid friendly too! I used three ears of fresh sweet corn in place of the canned and also added about 1T of sugar.  Cook them like pancakes with a bit of butter.  They'd also be great with bits of ham, basil, or onion inside.

Average recipe, nothing spectacular.  Makes a lot of fritters, way too many for a family of 3!  Good taste, if I could cut back the recipe I'd make again.

Made directly from the recipe these were a disaster...i  cooked about three of them then tossed the rest of the batter out...they were gooey and very bland in taste...i think the gooeyness may be due to the fact that my cream corn was more cream than anything haha...but every cook should be able to tweak a recipe according to their own needs so i can't be too harsh...if i ever do work up the courage to try this recipe again ill be prepared for  some major adjustments...

I used a can of cream corn and equal amount of fresh....this recipe is perfect just as written.  I tried a couple with butter and salt as direction and a couple with a bit of maple syrup....both were excellent.  Recipe is large for just the two of us so I fried them all up and will freeze.

Easy and tasty. The family liked these with a bit of butter maple syrup on top, like a pancake. I liked mine with just butter and a bit of salt and pepper.

This is a great recipe! Thank you. I did however make these without egg. I had none in the house. I had no creamed corn so i took 2 cans of whole kernel corn and blended one can in the blender with the juice, then drained the other can. I also used bacon grease to fry them on my electric hot plate. Delicious!! Will definitely make again.

These are very tasty! I didn't have creamed corn, so I added a touch of splenda instead. They still turned out great and I ate them as is.

These were quite good.  My husband and kids really liked them.  I am not much of a pancake person and I liked them.  We had them as a side dish with dinner.  My family liked them with syrup I prefered them plain.  We will be making these again.  Thanks for the recipe!  Barb in Vancouver Canada

Yum! I was looking for something I could make with pantry ingredients and this hit the spot with some canned mustard greens and lentils. I used a mini ice cream/cookie scoop to drop the batter and that made perfect silver dollar size fritters.

Great recipe! I did add extra white sugar to sweeten them up a bit and I drained off approx half if the water from the can of whole corn. They were GREAT!! Even after about 3 hours when they were completely cooled down, I grabbed one to snack on and it was still slightly crispy and yummy!! Thank you for a great recipe!

My only change was that I deep-fried them, dropping by rounded tablespoons into hot oil.  Tasted great, perhaps a little doughy.  I may try lightening up on the flour a bit next time, and add a tsp or so of sugar.

YUM!  I tried the because they are 'Canadian style' and they were so good!  sort of like pancakes, with corn in them  (just make sure to cook them long enough so the middle isnt mushy)...and we did have them with syrup, which was surpsingly delicious!

I loved that these didn't have to be deep fried, but that's about it.  Too me they had a bitter baking powder aftertaste and were not a bit sweet.  Maybe it's because I used home frozen corn and not canned creamed corn.  I did add 1/4 cup of sugar and that made it a little better, but still a bitter after taste.
I gave it 2 stars because I think it's a good starting point, but definitely needs to be tweaked!

Was looking for a nice easy recipe which is what this is.  I found them a little bland, I guess I like mine with a bit more corn taste.  I reduce the flour, add a bit of paprika and sometimes some chopped up bacon.  The great thing about this is you can go either savoury (add some cheese) or sweet (great with maple syrup)

They were nice. A little bland. Needs lots of salt, pepper and perhaps a little sugar. Tasted slightly floury.

I've made corn fritters before but without the baking powder. I liked these more as they were lighter and fluffier. Husband ate them with maple syrup as suggested, and quite enjoyed them. They re-heat in the mic well too. I will definitely make these again. Thanks, Sean!

This was easy & very tasty!! The ones I made were rounded like hush puppies and put into a Fryer.  The cream corn made these awesome!! A must try.

These were good with maple syrup...but absolutely wonderful as a side dish...I sprinkled a little popcorn salt on the outside and served them with fresh salsa as a side for Ranchero Chicken...good side dish.

These weren't bad, perhaps it was just our tastebuds. They were really very bland. Halfway through the batch we added some sugar, but it didn't make alot of difference. Guess we prefer Southern Style(ie-fattening and deep fried!)

I subbed an equivalent amount of my favorite pancake mix for the dry ingredients and egg to speed it up and it worked fabulously!  Fast and delightful!

.....love corn fritters! These were very good - the only hassle I had was in using bacon fat over lard - smoked too much. As well, my "dollops" were too large and as a result, the fritters were not fully cooked inside the centers. Nevertheless - we enjoyed them!

Can't say as though I'm thrilled with this recipe--I even added 2 tbs sugar to the batter.  Gotta agree with fellow reviewers when I say they were rather tasteless-even with maple syrup.  Maybe they'll be better after sitting in the fridge overnight.  Maybe with some chopped chilies added or some extra spices they'd be a little more exciting.  But the kids loved them, if that means anything!!

My husband says these are the absolute best corn fritters - I have to take his word because I don't eat corn.   Remember to drain the niblets.  Guess I had better start making them again!!!

These tasted pretty good, but I think they did have a slightly bitter aftertaste. This recipe is a good way to use up canned corn. Thanks!

Made this as a side dish and loved it.  I also tried it with maple syrup since so many seemed to like it that way - just delicious!  This is a recipe I will make over and over.  Thanks for a winner!

kids love these, I was shocked even my 2 year old ate them. They disappeared in a flash, even the extras (I,D scaled the recipe up). Boys liked them in their hand as a snack. Definitly one to keep

I have been searching for the Corn Fritter recipe from my Joy of Cookingbook (from the '70s) that was lost in a move. The current revised edition doesn't have it...  I found and made this recipe, cutting back a bit on the baking powder and flour. (Was afraid of the aftertaste of the powder as mentioned by previous raters.)  Also, I added some salt, sugar & nutmeg. YUMMY! Great with applesauce.
PS: Tried adding some diced cooked bacon to some of them, and that was good too. Next time I will use only creamed corn since I wasn't too crazy about all the whole corn kernels.

I gave this four stars because they didn't come out as I expected. They were not done in the center and were thicker than I liked. Perhaps if I cut the flour next time and also "thin out" the batter in the skillet. The flavor was ok but the cakes were too thick. I used Pam in the skillet too.

This is a great recipe.  Just like I remember them. Didn't change anything.
