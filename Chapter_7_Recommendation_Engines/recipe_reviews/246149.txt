I thought the flavor was pretty good, but these would not stay together. I'm not sure what the issue was. I like that they are healthy and great for my low-carb lifestyle. These made a good sub for hashbrowns at breakfast. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I added cheddar cheese and Romano cheese along with garlic powder and Herbs de Provence.  I cooked it on a little higher than medium heat for 7 minutes per side.  They held together and turned out crispy and delicious

Stayed together. Spooned into skillet.  Needed a little something extra in the mix, cayenne dominated flavor. Next time I’ll try adding a little something and cut back in cayenne. Maybe some peppers or green onions for a little more flavor

Pros: it's like a healthier version of a potato pancake, it only requires a few ingredients, and it's very customizable in terms of spices. Cons: really, really dense. (I actually made a full meal out of four of these things, because they're so filling.) Also, because cauliflower has such a mild taste, you end up tasting the eggs fairly strongly, which I didn't like. 

Verdict: I wouldn't make this again, simply because I like other preparations of cauliflower better...but if you're looking for something healthy and filling, this is definitely worth a try!

So, thoughts on it not binding: let the cauliflower cool, and gently press into cheese cloth, or let dry on paper towels. I found the residual water to keep it from forming. It fell apart, so I sautéed the entire serving in a skillet with olive oil, and stirred in some white sharp cheddar as a last ditch rescue effort. It turned out pretty amazing I must say. I like that this was low carb, but I think almond flour just doesn't mimic flour well enough...

Our family loved this and followed the extract recipe.  Spooned batter into the skillet and it formed pancakes that were easy to flip. Even my picky 10 year old asked for more.

Great recipe. My kids loved it and had no idea it was made of vegetables. I used whole wheat flour instead of almond flour and it was fine. It didn't fall apart. I added some spices such as onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, and hot red chilli flakes.

These turned out well but with some changes.. I mixed in cheese and spices, then baked at 375 for 10 minutes, then popped them in the air fryer.

I have made this twice and both times it's turned out delicious.  I add chives and cream cheese. They stay together when frying but one needs to handle them carefully. I've found they're great for making a week long meal prep.

Love having this recipe as an option to use a head of cauliflower I have forgotten I have in the fridge!  EASY recipe.  I made it as is (when I make a recipe for the 1st time, I make it exactly as shown in respect for the person who created it)...yummy.
What I would like to see is suggestions for their use - how do folks use these?  Bet they are great for sweet *or* savory applications...after munching on a couple of them during cooking?  The possibilities seem endless.  So nice to have an "out of the old box" recipe for cauli - I love cauli!

This concoction is impossible to form into 'patties'. I gave up and fried up the whole mess as a scrambed egg sort of thingy

I used a bag of raw riced cauliflower so they didn't stick together as well as they might if I had followed the recipe, but the eggs did the trick to keep the patties stuck together and they ended up coming out really good.

I used regular flour and cheddar cheese to hold it all together. I held together. It wasn’t good enough to make again.
