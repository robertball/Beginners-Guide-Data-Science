This is excellent.  I cook it on one side of the grill that is turned of while the other side is turned on.  This helps avoid burning the bacon.

These were good.  I wrapped the chicken breasts with two pieces of bacon.  As well, I cooked the chicken over the indirect heat first and then put over the direct heat at the end to cook the bacon in order to insure that it wouldn't burn.  I would make this again.

This is one of those meals that while you are eating you get excited about sharing it with others.  I used chicken tenders each wrapped with a half to a full piece of bacon.  I baked the chicken for about 20 min. (I am currently without a grill.) Than I blasted the bacon with the broiler. 5 min. per side. I am just sad I waited so long to try this recipe out.

My family loved this recipe. I didn't have Italian dressing so I used a 5 herb dressing and it turned out wonderfully. We will be enjoying this dish for many more meals to come.

Excellent!! Made as recipe follows. Baked it in the oven at 375* or twenty minutes, then broiled for five on each side. Thank you!

Very good! Even better if you but cheese in the middle before you roll the chicken.

I knew this recipe would be a hit because in our house BACON = CANDY.  It's really about the only way to improve on chicken breasts.  I used a hickory bacon and it infused the chicken with a nice smoky flavor.  I followed the advice of some other reviewers and cooked over indirect heat and had some applewood chips on the grill as well.  We'll be making this again for mother's day this coming weekend.  Thanks for a great recipe.

After facet of this dish rocked. i added a little worcestshire and soy to the italian marinade, and definitely didnt come even close to a whole bottle of barbecue sauce. The reviews are dead on about cooking them away from direct heat, we didnt even need to use toothpicks because the bacon sealed up so well. i will make this again for sure.

The rating on this only goes to a 5 but we rate this a 10!!!!!!  We used all the bacon and and extra sauce and followed the advice of pinwheel wrapping and make sure the breast pieces are smaller.

Good summer grill recipe.  Very straightforward... although I needed to increase the cooking time for the bacon to crisp.

I really liked the way it looked, next time might try seasoning the chicken first or marinating it for longer.

Fantastic !  I do not have a grill so I used my over instead.  I browned the bacon using the broiler, turning once to brown the bacon on both sides.  I then baked the roll ups at 350 until done (I put a temp probe in so I could tell when they were done).  This was a complete hit in my house, my kids loved them too !

For the reader who was skeptical about the use of Italian dressing.  I have been using this dressing for many years to marinate chicken, pork tenderloin, and steak (cheaper than marinades).  It works great!  Everyone raves about the taste.  I will try this recipe very soon, sounds delicious with the addition of bacon & bbq sauce.

This was a very tasty dish.  I used thin chicken cutlets and seasoned them with "grill mates" before rolling.  I also used thick sliced bacon.  They were very juicy and delicious.  I will definately make this again, maybe for a dinner party.  Served with fresh corn and oven fries.

This dish was delicious! Be sure to buy smaller chicken breasts if possible (or slice in half) as larger breasts will be hard to roll. I used light italian dressing to save on calories, and a hickory bbq sauce to match the bacon. I also don't have a grill so broiled instead, and it turned out wonderfully without the bacon burning. Thanks!

So, so good. The italian dressing makes this dish...it creates a complexity of flavor that is appreciated by everyone, but is subtle enough that you won't know what the secret ingredient is.

Excellent flavor.  Easy to prepare with every day ingredients.  I did make a slight change.  Used chicken breast tenderloins instead of whole breast.  Only had smoked bacon so I used a honey BBQ sauce to get that tangy honey flavor.  Also wrapped the bacon with the breast in a pinwheel fashion instead of only on the outside of the breast.  Then secured the entire wrap with a toothpick. Turned out so moist and flavorful.  Hubby cooked them on the grill and they were ready to serve in less than 30 minutes.  Will be making this recipe again and again.  Thanks!

Using boneless chicken tenderloin strips, I wrapped each in one piece of bacon and put them on wood skewers then placed them in the marinade.   Being in Ohio in winter, it was not grilling weather.  Instead, after marinating for 2 hours, I removed them to a 9x13 baking dish and baked for 30 minutes at 350, turning once.  To crisp up the bacon, I pulled out my cast iron grill pan and grilled them until the bacon was crisp, basting with the BBQ sauce.  These were a big hit with my picky kids.

So good, moist and tender...yum. My husband, 3 1/2 year old, even my 16 month old ate it up, no leftovers! I marinated them overnight (dinner plans changed the night we were going to have this) and added some Mrs. Dash original seasoning to the chicken before I rolled them (just on the inside) and they were so flavorful! Do use toothpicks though, I didn't and the bacon kept falling off during cooking. Thanks, will make this again for sure.

This dish was excellent! Iactually changed a few things...I didn't have Italian dressing when I got home so instead I drizzled the wrapped chicken with some maple syrup and then sprinkled it with some brown sugar. I baked @ 375 for about 40 minutes, or until the chicken looked cooked all the way. My boyfriend loved it, and he is hard to please!

We enjoyed this recipe, but I'm unconvinced that the italian dressing contributed anything to the final result.  I suspect you'd get the same final result with just olive oil.

I had large chicken breasts so I cut them in half to make smaller roll ups.  I marinated them in a gallon sized ziploc bag.  Had to watch them carefully on the bbq towards the end as the bacon drippings can catch on fire even though I had moved them to the upper level away from the flame.  Very tasty and easy.

This was delicious and SO easy to put together and cook.
I could not find honey bacon, so I used reduced sodium bacon with a spicy honey barbeque sauce and it turned out great! The whole family, even our picky three year old, loved it.

These are amazing!!!!  So easy to make and taste fantastic.  I cooked over indirect heat until mostly done  then put the heat under them to crisp up the bacon.  Thanks everyone, even my kids, loved these!
