Yummmm!  My kids loved these!  Only changes I made was to double the recipe, added some extra persimmon (since I had several that needed to be eaten), and mixed the cinnamon (about a tablespoon) into the batter instead of putting it on top.  Sprinkled tops with raw sugar.  Will definitely make these again!!!

This is a moist yummy variation to banana muffins.  I did make a few modifications.  I doubled the recipe, added an extra banana, substituted half of the flour with almond flour, reduced the sugar by a third and substituted half the coconut oil with butter.  All in all the recipe is very similar and I am sure would be great as written as well. I cannot wait to make another batch when my next set of persimmons ripen!

I used more persimmons and gluten-free flour. Family loved these.

Made a batch and a half, which yielded 12 muffins. Cut the sugar by a third, added a bit of coconut palm sugar, added a little cinnamon to the batter and just bashed up fruit with a potatoe masher instead of using a mixer, otherwise made as directed. Mine turned out very blonde in color and not toasted like the photos.  I donâ€™t know if it was because I cut the sugar or what. Very tasty, great for breakfast!

This is so easy and I loved the flavors. Banana and Persimmon meld together nicely. Finding Persimmons is not easy but we'll worth the effort.

I added raisins and walnuts and turned out very good. I also added no white sugar, but used stevia for sweetner.

The first thing that I noticed when starting to make these muffins was 6 muffins.... why after getting all the ingredients together this recipe only made 6 muffins...make a recipe using all muffin tins.    I Would have love to double the recipe if I would have had extra ingredients.  The reason for making this recipe, for me was to try persimmon, I had never used persimmon or had ever tasted one I wanted to learn about them.  I let the persimmon ripe for about a week and when I went to peel the persimmon I noticed it had a feel black spots and then the rest was hard not easy to mash I was not sure if the Persimmon was good or not but I carried on making the muffins.  I didn't read all the steps first before making the muffins and I add all the ingredients in the first step together without mixing before adding the next ingredient.  The first thing I noticed was the big chunks of persimmon and the coconut oil hardening.  but I left them like that I thought maybe the would taste good like that ..After mixing all the ingredients and pouring into prepared muffins cups the batter ended up making 9 muffins I don't know whether this was because of the chunks persimmons but i had to use a  turkey baster to get all the water out of each extra muffin cup until I used up all the batter.  Into the oven they went.  I will let you know how they taste as soon as they cool

Got the toddler stamp of approval!  They even asked me for another while writing this review.  I ended up substituting butter for coconut oil.  By filling the cups 2/3 full I got 11 muffins, to leftovers. Will make again!

Easy to make! I doubled up on bananas and added walnuts, so needed to bake another 5-7 minutes. Delicious.
