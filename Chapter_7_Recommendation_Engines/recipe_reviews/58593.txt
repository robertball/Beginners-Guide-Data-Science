There's an Irish pub, here in Seattle, that makes these and they cook the onion and sausage, first, then add the bread crumbs, some egg and herbs. They, then, wrap it in puff pastry dough and bake. This may make it a bit less greasy and, of course, cooked through in less time.

I'm English and I think the secret of this recipe is the Dijon mustard. I added 1 Tbsp each of onion powder and sage to the sausage meat.  I cut the 2 pastry sheets to make 4 strips.  When the sausage was spread onto the pastry and rolled over & sealed, I had 4 "logs".  When these were on the baking sheet I cut each "log" into 7 - 8 individual rolls and cut a small slit in the top of each. I wanted them for finger food.  I did add the bread which someone else suggested but I don't think it really helped with the greasiness, but it didn't detract either. Drain on paper towel while they're still hot. Don't skip the Dijon!

My husband is from England and has been craving these British treats for a long time!  They were easy to make and tasted great!  The only thing I did differently was to cook the sausage and drain the fat before filling the pastry dough.  This cut down on the greasiness.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Like some of the other reviewers, I too am Scottish. I have been making my own Sausage Rolls for years, and I noticed that the original recipe had excluded onions. I always add finely chopped onions to the sausagemeat along with breadcrums,parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. I roll out some pre-made puff pastry and pipe the mixture through a wide piping nozzle onto the sheet. After folding over the sheet to form a tube, I then cut it to the appropriate size. (At this point I usually cut one or two small slashs into the newly made rolls. This allows some of the fat/grease to escape from the roll.) If its for a lunch-time snack about 3-4 inchs is enough, or if its for a buffet style occasion then smaller ( about 1" to 1 1/2" is usually long enough).  Should any reader be visiting Scotland, I would recommend sausage rolls from Greggs to them. They are simply delicious.

Not quite the same taste as British sausage rolls - mainly because the sausage meat is different, but still a tasty dish. I added a small chopped onion and 1 Tablespoon of chopped parsley. My family loved them and I froze some for packed lunches. If cut much smaller these make a tasty finger food.

These really are very tasty, but I agree with most other reviewers - a little too greasy for cocktail parties.  Try this:  use "brown&serve" links (pre-cooked)wrapped in puff pastry (or pie crust strips if puff is too rich for you) that has been cut to fit each so that 1/2" of sausage link sticks out each end.  Much less cooking time and the grease has already been rendered.  A great Christmas potluck dish that disappears rapidly from the table!

This recipe is very easy and quick.  When I prepared this recipe, I added 2 shredded carrots, 1/2 finely chopped onion and 1/2 cup of finely chopped mushroom.  Turned out wonderful.  Also I made the rolls smaller so that I got 24 rolls out of the recipe.

Used plain sausage meat but added a tablespoon of sage & onion powder and a teaspoon of all spice. Took about 30mins to cook but did not burn at all. A great recipe - will never buy store sausage rolls again!

I LOVE these, I cut them into mini sausage rolls and serve as an appetizer or make large ones and feed them for lunch!  I have tried plain sausage meat and added my own garlic powder and adobo but prefer the sausage meat preseasoned.  I NEVER have any leftovers and have served these MANY times, always something a little different and this is surely the EASY version as home-made pastry and I don't get along too well!
P.S> I am Scottish!  I know my sausage rolls!!!!

These were tasty, a little greasy, but good. One kid loved them without the mustard, the other was in "not trying anything new mode".  Will definitely make again. Liked the puff pastry much better than using crescent rolls as we've done before.

These are wonderful.  You can serve mustard on the side instead of painting the dough with it if there are people who don't care for mustard.

I have a simple recipe. To 5 lbs sausage meat add 1 box stove top stuffing and add dried onion flakes. Put in the puff pastry and bake.

My Scotsman thought these were excellent!  My phyllo dough (edited to add: oops! puff pastry & phyllo dough obviously are not the same... these are good with phyllo, though!!) didn't have little cutting lines, so I just cut one of the rolls into 6 squares, and put a slightly more than thin coat of dijon mustard.  I didn't add a thing to the sausage and he is raving.  He's lived here a year and 1/2 now and is getting homesick - for food items, mostly... so for him to love them I'm thrilled!!

He noted that yes, the sausage meat is different (his take on British sausage is that it has lots of non-meat fillers), but that it tasted like a good butcher's sausage roll. (like Oliphant's or Gregg's).  After baking we put them on a cooling rack to let the remaining grease drip -- but we found them only too greasy if you let them sit on the pan (i.e., in the grease) you baked them on.  

I used a Pampered Chef stone and they turned out really well.  I baked them 10 minutes and then checked on them every 3 minutes -- probably next time I'll take them out at 13-15 minutes -- make them a little less crunchy.  Once I saw the sausage bubbling out the ends I knew the meat was cooked.

** Thank You for this recipe!! **

These are a different option for an appetizer. I cut the dough into thirds, then into fourths, making a smaller version. Put more dijon out for dipping. I precooked the sausage with onions, made up the rolls, then froze. Thawed in the frig, then baked. Came out great!! Thanks POSHIE25!

We(our Irish family) do ours with HP sauce instead of the Dijon mustard. Otherwise the same. Lovely.

I love making sausage rolls, but I do mine a bit different and they turn out better this way in my opinion...
I roll out my puff pastry a little, then cut the pkg. of sausage in 1/2 & roll it to the length of the pasty & then roll the pastry around the sausage. I cut the rolls about 2 inches in length... bite size works better, and are more like what I grew up eating in England.

These were REALLY tasty. An awesome party snack! They opened while baking, which is the only reason they're getting a four-star rating from me instead of a five. Directions should be clarified (either that puff should overlap or pastry should be baked seam-side down) for a five-star review.

Yeah BABY! I love sausage rolls, i lived in Australia most of my life and there it is also staple food. To remedy the greasyness of the recipe, all you need to do is add white bread soaked in warm water then squeeze out water thoroughly and add to the sausage, if you get the Jimmy Dean sage sausage its even better. And dont forget to dip it in good old tomato sauce or ketchup for you americans. MMMM Im hungry now!

I had never even heard of these until my boyfriend asked me to make them. I just wanted to keep it basic for my first try so I cooked the sausage with pepper and garlic powder before rolling them (to reduce the greasiness.) With the first batch I followed the instructions: cutting up the pastry into 6 then rolling. With the second batch I cut the pastry into 3 strips and rolled them, then cut them. This was easier for me. I also didn't need to use egg to seal them. I simply pressed the edges together then pressed with a fork for a finished edge. I used only egg yolk for the tops for a very rich color. This is a great basic recipe for someone who's never made them before! They were delicious, easy to make, and I will use this one again :) Thank you!

This is excellent. My son-in-law is from England and as he was coming through the door he was saying how wonderful it smelled in the house. I made only a few changes. I really dislike mustard so I brushed the dough with A-1 Sauce. I added 1/2 tsp. sage and 1/8 tsp. nutmeg to the ground pork. I browned the pork...am I ever glad...there was quite a bit of fat. As suggested by someone else, I cooked it on a Pampered Chief stone for 10 minute. I then checked it every 3 minutes. As suggested, the perfect cooking time on this stone is 13 - 15 minutes. Thank you so much for submitting this. P.S. My son-in-law loved it!!!

As a Canadian living in the States it is hard for me to get all the food I love from home.  This came pretty close. I took the advice of other posters and added onions, carrots and celery. I also cooked the sausage on the stove before hand.  I used Jimmy Dean original sausage and while it was good I will try something else next time.  The sausage just wasn't the same as in the sausage rolls from home.

I made these for a New Years day brunch, at the request of my English husband. One big change- I used vegetarian sausage (from Lightlife). They were great! Eveyone, including non-vegetarians, loved them.

This recipe was right on the money.  I have had similar sausage rolls in both England and in an Irish pub in Germany and this recipe is even better than the "authentic" ones I had overseas.  I couldn't find sage sausage so I added a pinch of ground sage to my sausage - it makes all of the difference - don't omit it!

omitted the mustard, used italian seasoned sausage meat, just like my granny makes in South Africa. Served them for the royal wedding at 3am and they disappeared before I had time to move them from the pan to a serving dish! Such a treat.

Fab taste! I did precook the sausage and onion then seasoned some with caraway seeds added swiss cheese to others. A great treat that was enjoyed by all. Thank you for posting this tasty recipe.

My boyfriend from England says these are just right.. I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage, and a non name brand dejon mustard. I have never worked with puff pastry before and it still turned out to be easy and perfect.

My husband is from Northern Ireland and can have sausage rolls only when he visits home (about once a year).  So needless to say, he was totally stoked about the idea that I could make these at home.  I surprised him with them one day when he got home from work, and he was really pleased.  Also, since I'm making them, I control the ingredients and can tailor them to my way of eating to make them lower in fat/calories.  Thanks!

These really are very simple and quite delicious. I have made them quit a few times during the holiday,  they are good hot, or cold and freeze well too.  What a great appetizer or a fancy addition to an afternoon high tea !!!!

Easy and yummy!  I made half the recipe to see how they would turn out before making them for Christmas morning, as most of my baking doesn't turn out very well! I cut one half of the package of the dough into 9 squares, rolled the sage sausage to fit the squares, browned them briefly to drain some grease, rolled them with the Dijon inside and egg on top, and they were great!  My husband is from England and loved them.  Will make a full batch or two for Christmas!  Thank you!

I saw this recipe a couple years ago, and after searches on all kinds of recipe websites I finally found it!!! I am new to puff pastry baking, so if I freeze these rolls, what is the best way to cook them from the freezer? Is there any way to freeze these AFTER baking, so they can be microwaved easily on the go?

Brushing Dijon on the pastry before placing the sausage meat on top and rolling is a MUST!!  These were delicious and a huge hit at our New Years Eve party.

This is very similar to a recipe I got from my English neighbor.  I used Jimmy Dean sage sausage and precooked it until it was just starting to brown to eliminate some grease.  I also used Pepperidge Farm puff pastry.  Both my neighbor and my English husband had never heard of adding mustard, but my husband thought it was quite a nice addition.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I am English and recently introduced my boyfriend to sausage rolls and he loves them!  I liked the idea of using mustard and another thing that I like to do is mix the sausagemeat with tomato and bacon. My mum always makes a big roll at Christmas and it is always gone within ten minutes!

I prefer to use minced onion, salt, pepper and a dash of A1 Sauce.  Also try rolling the sausage mixture between two sheets of wax or saran wrap into a reptangle then remove the top sheet and roll the sausage like a jelly roll.  You can also divide the roll into five sections with two slashes on top for a cocktail party snack.

The recipe is ok.  It was too bland for my family's tastes although I will make it again but it will definitely be jazzed up for spices and flavor.  I would definitely recommend pre-cooking the sausage before putting in the oven and cooking the pastries on a silpat to avoid blackening the bottoms.

You made my British husband's Christmas this past year. He couln't keep his hands off them. I confess that I too grew fond of these when I was living in England, and was glad to have your recipe. We made two batches, and the second time precooked the rolled sausage in the mircrowave to get rid of some of the fat. Worked beautifully.Thanks.

I printed this out for my son's social studies class (they were studying England and needed some authentic recipes). I ended up making it because it looked really easy and I had some puffed pastry to use. I have to say that I wasn't impressed...I think it is something you have to grow up with to like & enjoy. Also, my rolls could use alot of work to look pretty! It would take some practice to perfect but I don't think I will attempt again. Thanks for letting me try something different!

This recipe was great, the mustard is a must for the flavor. I took the advice in the reviews and pre-cooked the sausage first. Everyone loved it, even my fussy (i dont like mustard) kid! Will definitly make this again.

The Dijon is an interesting touch, although you need Coleman's mustard if you want to remain authentic. Sautéed onions and lashings of sage will add immeasurably to the flavour.
 Finally, pre-cooking the pork defeats the purpose of the dish, which is to have the fat ooze into the bottom of the pastry so as to create a variety of textures as you bite into these tasty morsels.  I strongly recommend grinding your own pork, so you can control the amount of fat; use loin, not butt, and the results will not be "too greasy" for most tastes.

Yes, I tired this recipe and have used it several times.  My grandson-in-law is from Kent and loves sausage rolls.  He came to the U.S. in October, so I thought I'd make these for him--just to see if I could come close to what he is accustomed to. Well, I did by genuine British bangers and squeezed the meat out of the skin.  I had already done the onion, so I mixed them up.  Believe it or not, the English bangers were NOT all that greasy.  I mixed the onion, mustard and meat--rolled the meat into the puff pastry (There were 2 sheets in 3 parts each, so I was able to make about 36 rolls.) One can always improvise, but I want to stay true to what Tom is fond of, so I followed the Brit way.  One could use Italian sausage and accompany that with a marinara dipping sauce.  Or cook/drain chorizo and accompany that with a good salsa.  You could add jalapeños, too.  There are lots of fun variations--LOVE THIS RECIPE, though!

Very good!  I took the advice of other reviewers and cooked the sausage first with some onion.  This way a lot of the fat was drained off so they werent as greasy.  I didnt notice the mustard, maybe I didnt put enough on..

As an English woman living in the states, I love to cook good english food for my kids so they grow up knowing that side of their family. There were no sausage rolls left, none. They gobbled them instantly. Great recipe and will definatley be a staple in our home now. Thanks!

These are good! Not the same as UK version, but close! I make them all the time, and my girlfriend loves them.. om nom nom

I highly recommend using Jimmy Dean's Sage pork sausage meat, and adding diced onion. That's it!

When trying out a new recipe I always go by it exactly! These are delicious and look so pretty! I may mince up a bit of onion next time to add to the sausage for an extra flavor... then again... I may not!

Really good homemade sausage rolls, much nicer than the store bought ones.  We couldn't taste the mustard much.  Maybe needed to add more.  I also added shredded onion, shredded carrot and sage to the sausage mixture.

I made 18 rolls with a tablespoon of this mixture - cooked pork 1lb, half a bag of matchstick carrots, half an onion, 3 eggs and italian seasoning.  I still had left over mixture after using the 1 package of pastry sheets. I fed 4 people these rolls for a small meal and they were satisfied. I had forgotten to put the dijon on the inside of the rolls so when they finished i put just a bit on the top and even the person who hates all mustards loved the extra flavor of spice the dijon brought to the roll. Will definately make again.

I have been making sausage rolls for years and years and years (I'm 58)  The additions to basic sausage rolls must be a 'location' thing.  I was born in Chiswick near london, and we never put mustard, sage, nutmeg etc anywhere near our sausage.  Yes I do make them out here (texas) and I do use pepperidge farm flaky pastry sheets..... But my mum would hate the fact that I do - she always made hers with shortcrust pastry and sausage meat - no thyme, sage, nutmeg or mustard etc.   Must admit that since coming to america and living in texas for the past 12 years - I am guilty of using 'Hot' spiced sausage meat...

Loved them.  I am not English but love sausage, dijon and puff pastry ... need I say anymore.  I have a bag frozen in my freezer which cook up well in the toaster oven on demand. (I will use a lower heat then so they do not burn and cook all the way through because they are frozen).

Super good.  I can't find sage sausage meat in my local grocery stores so I used regular sausage meat and added some ground sage.  I make these alot smaller too because I am paranoid about the meat cooking through and I don't want to brown the pastry too much to get it cooked through.

Problem was finding a good quality sausage meat!  I eventually found a good British/Irish butcher and was able to get a good quality authentic sausage meat and was able to make sausage rolls.  Also make sure you put a slit in the top of rolls before they go into oven.  Thanks for a nice recipe.

I made these using Sage sausage.  I also add onions to the meat and cut slits in the top of the pastry before baking.  Delish!  My 5 year old loves taking these for her school lunch.  Thanks to my British friend for introducing them to me.

My husband is English also and has lived in the U.S. for seven years and misses not only sausage rolls, but meat and potatoe pies and of course fish and chips.  He had never heard of using Dijon mustard in the sausage rolls.  I only had honey dijon and did not put too much on the sheets as my husband is not a mustard fan.  I did use the Jimmy Dean Sage flavored sausage meat and my husband said it needed even more sage so next time I might at 1/2 tablespoon of sage.  I also cooked my sausage and onions before rolling them in the pastry and had no problem with grease.  Since it is just the two of us, I froze half the batch.  We did pour beef Bisto gravy on them - delish!  Hubby even loved them with the mustard though I will keep it to a minimum.  :)

I have made these a few times. My husband LOVES them! I used the other suggestions and cooked the sausage meat first and added cooked diced onions too. Thanks for the recipe.

These are delicious. I made them at Christmas time and froze some as well. We finished the frozen ones last week so that will tell you how well they keep in the freezer. I didn't change anything about the recipe. They were a little greasy but it didn't make me enjoy them any less.

Very tasty!  I just made my first batch for my daughters school function tonight.   I had to send my husband out for ingredients for another batch since he and my kids ate most of them already.

Excellent!

So easy and so great.  I only made 8 rolls (because I only had 4 sausages) and they were too flaky. It makes such a difference to cook the sausage in the pastry.  Will try again, maybe with a turkey or chicken sausage just to offset the decadence of puff pastry.

I made these for our family's construction company Christmas party this weekend. 40+ hungry plumbers, electricians, carpenters and other burly men gobbled them up! They were so busy waiting for the next batch to come out of the oven that they forgot to play poker!!! We made our own sausage from scratch which was worth the effort. 5lbs of pork shoulder butt ground and mixed with 5 cloves of garlic, paprika, chipolte chillies, brown sugar, fresh oregano, pepper and 40 grams of sea salt. They baked up 20 mins in a 400 degree oven from frozen and weren't greasy at all. Easy and AWESOME!!!

My Canadian heart is happy.  Finally something that resembles the sausage rolls from home (nothing like it in SC).  I did add sage and chopped onion.  I have also added bread crumbs to the sausage to help absorb the oil.  Yummy

We made these as part of an international buffet for New Year's eve. They went fast and people really enjoyed them. I followed the advice of a few others and used reduced fat sausage and cooked the sausage into "logs" first before wrapping in the pastry. We served the mustard on the side, as well. Delicious! I wish there were leftovers, but there are not!

These were definately delicious! Instead of rolling mine, I cut the dough in 1/2 to have tops & bottoms and sealed the edges with a fork to make them look pretty. I did add the egg to the tops to give them a nice shine. I used mild sausage and added some shredded cheddar cheese to give it a little extra flavor. I also served them with agave nectar, which gave them a nice flavor too. Simple, easy, and very delicious (even my picky toddler loved these!). I will definately make this recipe again!

Mmm...very good!  Not hard to make, very tasty.  They are a little greasy, and next time I think I will use some of the tips from others on prepping them to not be so.  I too added sage & onion powder to the sausage meat, jazzing it up a bit.  I've never used puff pastry before, so now I'm inspired to try Jamaican patties with ground beef & curry next!

My family loves this recipe.  I used mild Italian sausage.  When we tasted the rolls, there was something missing.  My husband figured out what was missing.  It was salsa. Delicious.  My children love how easy it is to grab and go.

The Sausage rolls tasted wonderfull. However putting them togeather was not as easy as I had thought it would be. My firt few attempts at putting togeather the rolls failed miserably. However they became considerably more aesthetically pleasing as I kept going. I doubled the recipe, and following the advice of other reviewers and added garlic, onion and mushrooms to the sausage meat along with italian seasoning and some brown sugar. Tasted great, but I think they would have been a little bland without the extra add ins.

I come from a British family and we were all thrown off by the mustard. My mom and aunt had never seen the mustard rolled directly into the roll (and they've eaten plenty of sausage rolls in their time) and much preferred the mustard as a condiment to dip in. We always just roll the sausage up in the puff pastry and bake... you just can't go wrong with simple. They're so good you can't eat just one... or two. Thanks for the idea of the mustard, I'll be making them both ways from now on.

I followed the recipe to the T. I don't think I put enough Dijon...maybe I'll slather the sausages in Dijon instead of brushing it on pastry next time. Also, it was very oily at the bottom, but the pastry absorbed it all...which is not the healthiest. Too many of these and I would feel gross with fat!

Acceptable, but the conversation at our table centered on what might be better wrapped in the puff pastry.  Link sausage instead of ground, jalapino sausage, etc.

This recipe turned out great for us! I wanted to make sausage rolls because, like a few others, my significant other is from England and missed food from home. He thought that they were great and "not a million miles off the ones from home". I rolled the meat in the pastry too much so they were extra puffy, but still very edible. I am definitely going to be making these again!

Yum!  These were delicious and a hit with the entire family.  I didn't have sage sausage on hand and used Jimmy Deam hot sausage and Coleman's English Mustard.  Easy and definitely a keeper.  My hubby said they were better than the ones they serve at the English foods stand at our local Highland games.

Being from England and now living in South Florida i was very keen to learn how to make the good old English sausage rolls. This recipe is fantastic, i make up a nice big batch and even like to enjoy the left overs cold the next day for lunch.

Just like home. I'm Irish and would eat these anytime (breakfast or snack) in the day. I never realised how easy these are to make. The mustard is a good touch. 
As I am vegetarian I used veggie sausages and they worked well.

i live in england so i can easily compare them to the ones in the shops. there was too much sausage meat in them but apart from that, pretty close match. you can also make the vegetarian version which is cheddar and onion rather than sausage meat

I’ve made these a few times and I love it. The Dijon isn’t traditional but is amazing. I cook some onion first until nice and soft and add the pork and spices until the pork is just done. I hate a soggy greasy mess on the bottom so I then drain the mixture, add breadcrumbs and let it cool while the oven heats before I put it in the puff pastry. I find it easier to make the two logs and put the egg on and then cut into the smaller pieces. Easy for all levels- give it a go!

I'm British and thought the recipe needed some additions - I added 2.5 tablespoons breadcrumbs, 1 teaspoon salt and pepper, 1 tablespoon of sage, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg and a pinch of cloves. Mixed into the sausage meat before splitting it up. Came out excellent - very close flavour to home.

Been craving something my mum always made. I'm not any good at pastry. I didn't think I would find a recipe for sausage rolls. OMG, I almost cried they are just like mom's.  Flakey pastry and flavorful. Will make again. Do you make jam tarts too?

Because pork alone is extremely fatty, I always mix the pork with beef and veal (or  turkey) and then spice it with salt pepper, sage, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper (black and red). I mix the meat in a mixer to make sure it is blended thoroughly. I then roll out the dough, cover it with mustard and roll the meat into thin rolls that are as long as the wide side of the dough.  Roll the dough around the meat - you can get 3 - 4 long rolls from one piece of puff pastry, and then cut the  long roll into the desired size. I like 2-3 inch pieces, but you can  make them shorter or longer.  Bake for 18 -20 minutes in a 425 degree oven (my oven tends to run cool). This does change the recipe completely - sorry.

I am originally from London but have lived in the US for over 20 years, and every now and then I start to crave foods from my childhood. Ooooooh these are so good. Definitely worth the hunt for puff pastry.

Had some puff pastry that has been in the freezer that my son wanted me to do something with. So, I went with this basic recipe and then took some of the suggestions about spice. Fried up breakfast sausage, then sautéed some shallot, threw in parsley, a little salt and pepper and some breadcrumbs. Then topped it off with provolone before baking for 20 minutes... The piece de resistance - Lingonberry jam. You have not lived until you have had this! Throw some glazed carrots and fried some eggs (the brushings and an extra) in the caste-iron pan from the sausage and you have an AMA-ZING dinner!

Added diced onions, salt, cracked pepper and sage to taste per other comments and cooked before rolling up in puff pastry.  It was delicious.  Will definitely make this again!

A helpful idea to reduce the oiliness is purchase the reduced fat sausage. This has always been a nice holiday treat and great to bring to parties!

This is a great base recipe. I added some sage, salt and pepper. I also added about 1/8th of an onion and 2 carrots micrograted into the mix. The carrots and onions added a nice but very mild sweetness to it. They turned out great!

My husband and I both agree that these are really yummy. I cooked the sausage before baking them based on a previous review. The second time I made these I added a little ham and cheese to make it similar to a Cuban sandwich.

Can't even find the words to describe these other that WOW!  My husband has made these a couple of times since finding the recipe, and these little things were the only thing I craved on Christmas day.  Absolutly wonderful.  Need to get good quality sausage, and you can roll up the meat without cooking it first.  If you use cheaper/greasier sausage precooking the meat seemed to help.  We have tried it both ways, and both turned out great.

Tasty and easy.  I poked holes browned them and drained oil first and they were still greasy (but as someone previously mentioned, they're sausage, so what can you expect)?  I also thought they looked very big, so I began to cut them in half lengthwise and I think that gave a better meat to pasty ratio.

These were good, but greasy.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I might either brown the sausage first or bake on a broiler pan so the grease drips down.

I'm originally British, I had just forgotten temp and cooking time. I use Jimmy Dean Sausage with sage. Don't use mustard, have that nearby in case somebody wants to dip roll in. You are very good cutting out 12 exact squares, I just cut each piece of the pastry in half, roll the sausage to one long roll, place it along edge of of pastry, the rollover and cut them into pieces from there. Never come out the same size, but the smaller pieces are for my testing!

Due to popular demand, I make these often.  Quick, easy, & very tasty.  We do not eat pork, so I use a good bulk turkey sausage from our local farmers’ market.  They reheat well, and are always a hit.  Sometimes I add a drop of Worcestershire sauce to the Dijon mustard for even more flavor.

These are delicious!  I precooked my sausage with some onion, garlic, sale, pepper and sage and then let it drain on a paper towel.  I also added some sesame seeds to the top before cooking.

Made these for the first time for Easter! My mom bought phyllo sheets instead of puff pastry but it turned out really good! Only bad thing is the use of LOTS of butter if you do phyllo sheets instead but I got that perfect flakey texture after cooking them for 25 mins at 400 F. I also added chopped white onion, fresh chopped parsley, cayenne pepper, salt, pepper, and garlic salt into the pork and mixed that up with a fork before I rolled it onto the sheets. 10/10 recipe though. :)

After reading reviews and past experience with other recipes I did precook the sausage.   I added a very small amount of bread crumbs and made the sausage into "link" shapes to precook.  Placed sausage on paper towel while prepping dough and continued recipe as written.  Took off baking sheet and put on wire rack after baking.  Ended up with non greasy, crispy pastry that brought me back to South Africa nearly 40 years ago.

Simple and delicious. I've made both ways precook sausage and not. Much neater presentation and tighter roll with precook and getting rid of some sausage grease. Don't forget to score the tops or pastry will separate from meat (steam)

I added rubbed and ground sage, onion powder, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes. I also added some worcestershire sauce and tabasco. They were delicious....savory, a bit spicy, and tangy from the dijon!

A cracking dish : beautiful pastry with a great rise and I greatly preferred it to Stephens.  I liked the flaky-ness and I was impressed to see that the crumbs didn't get on my lap when I was in the car on the way to Tesco.
Thank you Mark

Great recipe!  I'm from England so they went down a treat.  The only thing I did was cut each one into three before cooking to make mini sausage rolls  I've made them twice now and will definitely make them again!!

I made these for my British husband on Bonfire Night and they turned out perfectly...he absolutely loved them! I followed recipe exactly. I used Jimmy Dean Sage Pork Sausage, as another reviewer recommended, and Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry.

Really good, and oh...so almost close to the sausage rolls I remember growing up! Used jimmy deans sage sausage, and added a pinch more dried sage and nutmeg. Used colemans English mustard on one set, and Dijon whole grain on the other. Both equally good! Thanks for recipe! Taking to Christmas pot luck for family. I slightly under baked and will reheat to serve!

I made these tonight. They were perfect. I mixed a tablespoon each of salt, pepper , onion and sage powder in with the ground pork. I cut the puff pastry into 8 squares (I didn't roll out the pastry,just dusted with flour), brushed them with dijon and filled each with the pork mixture. Then I sealed them with eggwash and brushed the remaining egg wash on the tops of the rolls. I cooked them on parchment paper at 375° for about 35 min.. they were delicious and golden brown. My English husband loved them with baked beans ;)

TRUST ME ON THIS ONE: butter and a dab of dijon, microwave for 15 seconds and you have an amazing dipping sauce. 

Also, if you haven't messed around with puff pastry, don't open it up too soon after you get it out of the freezer because I made that mistake and mine cracked on the sides. If this happens to you, you can reattach it quite easily by dipping your finger in the egg and lightly and quickly stroking the two pieces together- thats how I fixed mine and mine did not break up while cooking.

I crushed about a cup full of stove top pork stuffing and mixed it in the with the sausage meat to stop it from getting soggy. The mix was seasoned and my rolls ended up tasting very very similar to what they taste like in England- in fact the reason why I added it was because I thought to myself "hey these sort of do usually a stuffingish taste about them".  I never realised how much sausage meat my local Kroger sold. It was right next to the ham in these tubes that I had never noticed. Chances are your local grocery sells it too so don't just buy the ground pork and hope for the best. The puff pastry was fantastic for this recipe, I bought "the normal kind" which seems to be the pepperidge farm puff pastry sheets-  it comes with two long sheets which I just cut in half to make four long rolls like what you'd find at a bakery in the UK.

Absolutely love these! They're great for potluck events as you can make then in advance and serve them chilled. 

However, I plan on figuring how to make them smaller because as made according to the directions mine were 2" by 3".  I'd like them more like 2 small bites and not 4.

These are very good and super easy to make! I substituted the pastry sheets with crescent rolls because I found them first in the grocery store, but it turned out fine, though perhaps a bit more Americanized than English sausage rolls. Because of this, the prep time was only about 5 minutes. My rolls were finished at about 17 - 18 minutes at 400 degrees. I will definitely be making these again.

Thanks for the recipe.  My husband is from England and hasn't had a sausage roll for over 2 1/2 years.  He was craving them the other weekend while listening to his soccer match.  We found this recipe, and the rest is history.  Hubby says they taste like the real thing.  Thanks again!

These are YUMMY.  I took about 2 cups of generic croutons and crushed and then moistened them and added it into the jimmy dean sage sausage.  It made it milder... These were too flaky (color me surprised) for me, and only because i'm comparing them in my mind to the original thing growing up as a kid in Australia.  I don't recall that much flake, certainly more than the average pie crust...but not quite right.  It may have to do with the temp the dough was at...it is very finicky.  Still, these were very good.

We loved this. This is the first time I have ever tasted anything like it. Great dish.
