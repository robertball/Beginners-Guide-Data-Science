These were good. I added some garlic powder and salt and pepper when sauteing. And some chopped fresh basil too. I baked them in the oven instead of doing them in the skillet. I just brushed some olive oil on the tortillas, turned them oil side down on a baking sheet and put some filling and cheese on one side and folded over, then stuck them in a 425 degree oven for about 5 minutes to get a little crunch out of the tortillas. Thanks for a great idea!

I submitted this recipe, and you can use any vegetable you like--adding eggplant, spinach, or black beans also works well.  Have fun using the fresh ingredients your family enjoys!  This recipe makes 6 servings out of the 3 quesadillas.  You can use reduced carb tortillas also, and more cheese, but this was created to be a healthy recipe ; ).

*** WORTHY OF TEN STARS **  These quesadillas were fantastic!!  I also followed Nugget's suggestion of filling 1/2 of a large tortilla, folding over, and baking in the oven at 425 degrees for about 8-10 minutes or until brown.  I also added some garlic powder and onion powder to the veggies while they were cooking. You can top the quesadillas with sour cream, salsa, and sliced avocado too.  So healthy, so delicious!  Excellent recipe!

This was lovely. So yum. I did use whole wheat tortillas for the boys and wrapped mine in Bibb lettuce, with a bit of my No-Guilt Zesty Ranch dip on the side. My husband, oldest son and I loved these. We ate every bit. The veggies do enough talking on their own that just fresh ground black pepper and sea salt on them while they are sauteing is plenty. This one's a keeper! So good.

Absolutely fabulous recipe! I added a bit of minced garlic, cracked black pepper and a bit of kosher salt to the veggies as they sauteed. I added some corn and black beans to the mix as well. I baked the tortillas in the oven vs. in the frying pan which was a lot easier. These were so delicious served with a roasted red pepper salsa, light sour cream, and homemade guacamole!

This is absolutely delicious.  I admit I made the poor man’s version with green pepper instead of red, yellow onion instead of red and I omitted the squash.  I prefer this to chicken quesadillas and will be making these regularly.

I used Nuggets suggestions and it was much improved.  I found this recipe quick and easy and very nutritional.  I cut calories by using just enough cheese to hold it together and by using only 1 low fat tortilla and folding it over.  Nuggets suggestion to bake them is a definitely worth doing.  It adds a little crunch.  I also added crushed red pepper to get it a little kick and served it with salsa on the side.

Very good! I do these on the grill as well.  Just wrag veggies in foil and when they are close to done, throw the wrap on the grill until browned on both sides.  As stated by others, all veggies will do.  Homemade tortillas are always the best, but this is a great speedy recipe.

These were great. I used 4 cups total chopped veggies (zucchini, yellow squash, onion, bell pepper).  I added 3 cloves of garlic diced, a chipotle chili pepper in adobo sauce diced, and a can of lentils, rinsed.  I used pepperjack cheese.  I baked them in the oven at 425 for 5 minutes as recommended by Nuggets.  I topped them with "Amy's Cilantro Cream Sauce" from this site. My husband loved them and he's not usually satisfied with vegetarian food.

These were great! My only suggestion would be to maybe add a little seasoning next time.

I don't like eating veggies unless I season them, so I added salt & pepper & garlic powder when I suateed them. I also added 3/4 cup of cilantro to sprinkle inside the quesadillas. I'd definitely make this again. Update from the following day: I made them again! The first time I made them using my George Foreman grill, but this second time I wanted to use my oven. I left them in the oven for 5 MINS @ 425. I liked them better on my George Foreman grill though. It's quicker and much easier.

Great base recipe. I am not a fan of squash or zucchini so made mine with cheddar, mushrooms, onion and spinach. These are great with the whole wheat tortillas and especially yummy with the spinach and herb tortillas!! :)

Very good! I used both orange and red bell peppers and did not use mushrooms. I like to add about 3/4 cup frozen corn to the onions/peppers/zucchini while sautéing in a little olive oil. Black beans (rinsed/drained) are a great addition, too. I put the tortillas under the broiler, flip them over, load them with cheese and veggies, broil a few more minutes to melt cheese, top with another tortilla, and broil a few seconds to get it crispy. That method means both tortillas are crispy, without adding any oil! These are a favorite in our house! Thanks for the yummy recipe!

UPDATE:
I just made these again last night but on the grill. They turned out great. I put red peppers, muschrooms, and onions in foil with very little olive oil and some seasonings. Directly on the grill, I put zucchini and squash. I brushed them a little with balsamic vinaigrette in the middle of cooking b/c I realized 1/2 way through they were drying a bit and needed something on them. I don't know how long I kept them on the grill. I just watched them closely and turned when one side started looking done. After flipping the zuchnni and squash over I put the tortillas on the grill (over low heat). I put some cheese and cilantro on one side and added the veggies than a little more cheese and dropped the other tortilla on top. It was hard to fill over and a bit messy but it turned out really good.
These are great! I followed the recipe to the T except left out the olive oil. I had trouble flipping the quesadillas over so both sides were brown but they still turned out excellent. I served these with salsa. I also added garlic powder, black pepper, and crushed red pepper to veggies.

I loved these!  What I really loved about these quesadillas is that they were very healthy.  I mean, it is all chopped fresh veggies.  I also added some fresh spinach, fresh basil, and then dusted it with garlic powder as the veggies were sauteeing - as another reviewer recommended and that really worked well.  They have that warm, melty, texture of a quesadilla without the oil you might get if you went to a restaurant.  I think the mixture of these vegetables is really great - creates a delicious flavor).

good recipe as is, with the addition of pancetta people liked them a lot more ;) sorta negates the healthy factor though, but great addition.

These quesadillas are really delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, though I did add a clove of garlic because I LOVE it. Also, I don't ever use cooking spray when making my quesadillas, I personally find that a dry skillet works best. Check out my review and photos here:

Great idea and quite versatile!! I have made these several times now, always with a different list of veggies, depending on what I have in my fridge (carrots or corn make a great addition). I also add seasonings like basil, garlic or ginger, chili powder... and last time I sauteed it with some worcestershire sauce as well as the olive oil. Came out really tasty! Another modification was to add mayo or ranch dressing to the tortilla along with the veggies and cheese. Thanks for sharing your creativity!

YUMMY!!! We LOVED these quesadillas! Baked as recommended by many others & they were a flavorful, crispy, & delicious dinner success! I added a clove of minced garlic to the veggies and then salt & pepper to taste. They were DELISH! I think could eat a whole plate of just the veggies by themselves! I also used less cheese, but that was just me trying to be good to my hips. Thank you for the fabulous recipe! Will be our new quesadilla of choice. :)

This was okay, but lacked a bit of flavor, or spice. I would have liked it to be a bit more flavorful.

This was awesome! I used a little bit of salt and pepper when cooking the veggies and I baked the tortillas as was suggested in many reviews. Served with sour cream and salsa but no one used the toppings - it was so flavorful by itself. My husband is definitely NOT into vegetarian meals but even he was impressed. Thank you so much for the great recipe.

These were so good! I have tried several variations based on what vegetables I have in my fridge. I found that sweet potatoes are delicious, as well as black beans, sour cream, and avocado. I add minced garlic to the sauted vegetables, as well as sometimes onion, and some spices (basil, oregano, salt/pepper). I would give it 5 stars but I think without the modifications for spices it would not be as good.

I didn't make these low fat, but I cooked up the veggies I had- broccoli, carrot matchsticks, portabella mushrooms, yellow pepper, and a small onion at the last minute and made the quesadillas like instructed, and omg. SO.GOOD.

I really liked these. I probably doubled the zucchini, yellow squash, and red onion. One small one easily makes a cup. I didn't have the mushrooms, so I left them out and I subbed fresh green pepper for the red as it was what I had. The peppers and onions go great with the zucchini and yellow squash. I served it with a quick homemade guacamole. These are perfect in the summer when zucchini and yellow squash are abundant.

I made this for dinner last night, although I went about it a little differently.  I sautéed my veggies and set them aside.  Then I melted a little butter in a frying pan over medium-low heat, put a tortilla in and swished it around to give the tortilla a light coating of butter.  Then I put my veggies and cheese on half of the tortilla and folded over the other half.  I carefully transferred it to a baking sheet covered with non-stick foil.  Then I repeated the process with the next tortilla.  I baked the tortillas at 350 for about 20 minutes, flipping them half way through.  These were very good!  Next time I will double the amount of veggies.  I thought they could have used more.  We enjoyed these and will definitely make them again.  Thanks jrbaker!

Pretty good. I found that the veggies released so much moisture during cooking that the quesadilla became soggy. Not sure how to work around this next time, perhaps straining? The flavors are wonderful!

A great way to use up fresh veggies sitting in the crisper.  I didn't have mushrooms so I left them out but otherwise I stuck with the recipe.  I really liked how the flavors in the vegetables comes through, but my boyfriend insists on much more seasoning for his food, so I'll probably add a few spices next time.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

What can I say, but 'simple' 'healthy' 'quick' and very 'delicious'. Only added some sea salt and cracked black pepper. It doesn't need anything else. I'll add that these are just as good cold, so make a double batch and you'll have your lunch taken care of the next day.

This is the time of year when I make anything that has Zucchini in it!  But this will be my "go to" recipe for quesadillas from now on.  Omitted mushrooms and added garlic and fresh jalapeno from my garden.

This may seem like an odd combination of ingredients, but these are so addictive.  I find myself just chopping up a large batch of veggies, sautéing them, and storing them in the refrigerator so I can make anytime I’m in the mood for a snack or a quick easy meal.

AWESOME.  We did 4 servings and it yielded 2 quesadillas.  The vegetable combination was excellent, you won't even miss the meat.  Just be careful to not overdo the tortilla, I'd use medium heat and check it after the first minute or two.

Loved these! What a great idea. Was exactly what I was looking for when I searched for quesadillas. I followed the submitters advice and just used whatever fresh ingredients I had and sauteed with some garlic, salt, and added a tiny bit of sweet chilli sauce. I ended up cooking them in our sandwich press. Husband has been raving about them all night. Thanks for this idea!

We just made these and they are wonderful! They are a perfect recipe for a light meal. If I were going to make them for dinner, I'd add some black beans and cumin/chili powder or some chicken. But the way the recipe is written is just right for a light meal. Thank you for submitting this. I was looking for a recipe to use up the summer veggies I had in the fridge.

These were delicious and I'll definitely be adding it to my routine.  A great break from meat or fish every night.  I added a can of black beans to the mix but otherwise didn't change a thing.  Highly recommended!

Pretty basic stuff!  Our family loves the uncooked wheat tortillas.  I didn't have a red pepper on hand, but it was still good with everything else.  In fact, we made the Mediterranean Wrap last night with all the same vegetables grilled, so we just threw in the left overs for this.  Super good with grilled veggies!

These were delicious.  I added some black pepper and just a tad of cayenne, and didn't bother to measure the veggies, just threw it all together.  I will definitely make these again.

awesome recipe!  I used Wegman's roasted veggies instead of grilling them myself though.  Makes for a fast, delicious and healthy dinner.

Loved, loved, loved this recipe.  A great way to use up veggies from our CSA.  My 4 year old enjoyed them as well.

These were great with salsa- even my meat-loving man said it was tasty. The only change I made was splitting the filling between two quesadillas, rather than three. This made the quesadillas thicker and more filling.

I loved this recipe for the idea, but it does need some seasoning/spicing up.  I added some garlic, chili powder and cilantro, and used the veggies I had on hand instead of the ones in the recipe.  I baked the tortillas, and they turned out great.  Served with light sour cream and lots of salsa!  Very filling!

This is a great low-fat and delicious recipe! I sauteed 2 cloves of garlic with the onions first, then added the bell peppers. I then added the cumin, red pepper and chili podwer into the mixture. Once the onions were translucent, I added zuccini and squash. My husband and I love it and it's now a weekly meal in our home!

This recipe is great for a quick, healthy dinner. You could really use any veggie that you have on hand, but I recommend adding in some fresh minced garlic.You could also use corn tortillas for a more authentic taste.

These are great, I agree... I like spraying them with some olive oil and putting them in the oven.  I also added some garlic powder when cooking the veggies and I would add more garlic powder to the quesadillas when cooking them in the oven.  Overall, great, and I really enjoyed them with the whole wheat tortillas.

Due to family preferences, I used yellow squash, zucchini, fresh mushrooms, and fresh tomatoes on wheat tortillas. I used a wide spatula and had no trouble flipping them in the skillet. One tip is to put a thin layer of cheese right next to each tortilla; it melts and acts like an edible glue to keep it all together. My kids, 9&11, loved these! I liked pan-roasting the veggies in olive oil and Italian seasonings first to get a glaze on them. This is a keeper! Thanks, jrbaker!

Tried this tonight to use up the abundance of veggies from my garden....it was very yummy!  I used regular onion instead of red, left out the green pepper and canned mushrooms insted of fresh.  I reccomend using a quesadilla maker if you have one. (they make perfect quesadillas and only cost about $20, well worth it).  I will definitely make this recipe again!

Wow! What a wonderful recipe. I made it this time asper the recipe (except scaled down to 1 serving) and loved it. I also love, though, that I could make it with other ingredients, and that it's so quick to put together. I thought that with no spices it would be somewhat bland, but it wasn't at all. Thanks so much, jrbaker.

I have made this and found if you remove the yellow squash and add diced green chili, it gives it a more authentic taste. I also added a salsa to dip.

I added garlic powder, salt, pepper,spinach and a can of black beans. I lightly oiled (coconut oil) the bottom of a 13 x9 pan and folded the quesadillas in half, and baked in the oven at 425 degrees for 8-10 min. or until brown.

Very flavorful and a healthy alternative to one of my favorite meals. I used the raw tortillas instead of pre-cooked ones and next time I will probably substitute other veggies in place of the squash and zucchini.

These quesadillas were amazing! All of the different vegetable gave it such a great flavour. I doubled the recipe but other than that kept things the same.  Even though I doubled the recipe it only yielded enough for 4 quesadillas so next time I will need to at least triple it to feed my family of 4. They all raved about these so I will definitely be making them again. Thanks for a great recipe!

I prefer a more authentic veggie quesadilla, so I made some changes. I added 1/4 teaspoon of chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic paste, 1/2 teaspoon of cumin, and substituted pepper jack cheese for the cheddar. Very good!

Really enjoyed the mix of veggies with the cheese to make the quesadillas. We had it as a late night dinner and prepped the ingredients earlier in the day. Just know that 8-tortillas is not enough as you will have leftover 'veggie mix.'

These were great!  I used green onions instead of red onion (just a personal preference), and added 1/4 cup roasted sunflower seeds to the mixture, and topped it with alfalfa sprouts to give it some crunch.  Awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!

The whole family loved these. We did add some fresh cilantro and used regular flour tortillas. Served with sour cream, homemade guacamole and yellow rice. This is one you can use just about any vegetable combination and not go wrong. Fun family meal. Thanks jrbaker.

I just made these quesadillas and they were awesome! I used mushrooms, zucchini, leeks, and frozen corn simply because that's what I had in the fridge! I added a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice and a teaspoon of balsamic vinegar. Incredible light dinner that I'll make many times again with the veggies in my fridge!

These were perfect besides one small thing. Either I miscalculated or these weren't enough vegetables. As long as you put in say another half a cup of vegetables, then these are perfect!

Loved them :) Although I changed the recipe a bit, instead of red onion I put yellow onion, I did not add mushrooms but substituted it with cucumber and added lentil beans. Served with sour cream and salsa! Even my boyfriend liked them, will make again.

MMMMMMM. I added goat cheese to my recipe cause I had some leftover from another dish and was running low on cheddar. 

Also I recommend using ONE tortilla and folding it in half for a quesadilla rather than using two stacked with the veggies in between - - it tends to fall apart that way...

Also I sauteed the veggies in butter and some garlic salt for extra flavor. Turned out fantastic!!

I made this dish with what vegetables I had available, not 100% to recipe, and it was delicious. I added grilled chicken, used yellow onion instead of purple, and left out the mushrooms. A little too much work for me as far as a quesadilla goes, but well worth it.

Really bland. I love the idea of filling a tortilla with vege's you have on hand. We used red and yellow pepper, mushrooms, avocado and olives. To season, I just used some salt and pepper but it for sure needs something else.

Simple and good starting point for a tasty meal. It's one of those recipes that welcomes creativity. I highly recommend adding your favourite herbs and spices as the recipe is quite bland on it's own. I added flat leaf parsley and pepper. I can see how a clove of garlic, as others have recommended would make a welcome addition. I'll definitely do this one again.

This was very good.  I liked it better with sharp cheddar cheese (instead of Reduced Fat Cheese).  Also I added fresh garlic to the vegetable mix.  Altogether an easy, healthy and tasty recipe.

These were really good.  Even my husband who was skeptical of the vegetable filling liked them.  I do find it easier to put the ingredients on half of one tortilla and then fold it over, rather than trying to flip a full-size filled tortilla.

Loved this fresh, healthy recipe.  Added mushrooms, spinach, red pepper, red onion and garlic were sauteed.  I used the cream cheese spread from the turkey roll-ups recipe on this site and spread that on my tortilla first.  Then added a little bit of cheese and grilled.  Abundant flavor.

Very good quesadillas!  At-work version: We sliced the veggies rather than chopping and they were perfect.  Cooked them the night before and then threw them together at work the next day.  We melted the cheese on top of veggies, open-faced in the toaster oven, placed 2nd tortilla on top and toasted it - didn't need the cooking spray.  They came out perfect and everyone really enjoyed the flavor.  We used light sour cream for dipping.

My BF and I loved these!  I sauteed yellow onions with some garlic then added sliced zucchini, yellow squash and mushrooms.  I seasoned the veggies with salt, pepper and italian seasoning.  I low broiled the tortillas in the oven, about 4 minutes per side, instead of heating them in the pan.  I had the leftovers for lunch and they were even better.  I liked mine with some salsa and my BF liked his with sour cream.  I will def be making these again!

These were yummy!  I added some spinach to the sauteeing veggies 1 minute before I pulled them off.  I also thinly sliced (1/4") the vegetables rather than chopping into chunks, which gave teh quesadilla a smoother surface.  Might add some spices (chipotle powder, salt, pepper, etc) next time for a bit more heat.  Really good recipe and a definite keeper!

I make several different kinds of quesadillas, and these by far are the best. I've made this for other people and they loved them. I served them with the Quick Spicy Tomato Soup from this sight.

Amazing and quick! I first sauteed onions and garlic. Then added the squash, zucchini, red and green bell pepper, mushrooms, corn, and black beans. To spice it up a bit I added sea salt, ground pepper, chili powder, cumin, and oregano to the mix as it all cooked. I used Mexican blend of cheese from Safeway market. Wonderful!

Baked them in the oven and they turned out fantastic.  Only thing I changed was a Mexican mix of cheese instead of Cheddar and I add salt and pepper while sauteing the veggies.

I really like the concept and the ease of preparation, but feel these need more seasoning.  I tried one with drained salsa added to the vegetable mixture and that was an improvement.

I followed the recipe exactly except to omit the mushrooms.  My whole family (picky husband and 4 kids) loved them.  The flavors of the vegetables were enough - didn't need any spice, but a little salt and fresh ground pepper.  Delicious!

I baked it in the oven as another reviewer suggested and this came out so delicious! Other changes I made to the recipe - added some green pepper, omitted mushrooms because i didn't have any on hand and used shredded cheddar and monterey jack cheese. This recipe is a keeper.

Pleasantly surprised by these, my other half especially thought they tasted better than they sounded.  I used what ever veggies I had left in the fridge which were - red and green pepper, courgette, red onion, carrot and a few cherry tomatoes.  I did add a few slices of turkey for my other half.  Will be making again.  Very filling and a great way to use up those bits left in the fridge.

These are awesome. My boyfriend will never eat veggies and he loved them. I used a jalapeno pepper because I didn't have a red pepper and added salt, pepper, pepper jack cheese and fresh garlic. They were pretty spicy!

FANTASTIC!!  Just made this today for myself for lunch for the first time.  I did load it up a bit more with veggies, and as others stated, folded in half and put in my toaster oven.  I was afraid all the goodies would fall out if I tried to flip it in the skillet.  To my surprise, my husband who is strictly a meat and potato man, wanted a sample.   He REALLY liked it and said next time to make him one also.  Will definitely make this often.  It is so tasty and healthy.

Awesome. We loved this. I was even able to get my 9 yr old to eat these up. He usually complains about veggies. I added some  fresh spinach and diced tomato to the veggie mixture at the very end of the saute. Served with salsa and spanish rice.  Thanks!

This recipe is a great jumping off point - I'm excited to try it with many combinations of veggies.  I had leftover roasted vegetables (zucchini, onions, mushrooms, red peppers) I heated those up and added some chopped tomatoes (I also had leftover).  It made for a very quick yet tasty lunch.  It is a nice recipe to help clean out the fridge with any veggies you have on hand!

I really liked these!  I did make a few changes.  I didn't have mushrooms, I used green instead of red peppers used regular onions and I added 1 tsp minced garlic.  I have a large garden so it is nice to be able to cook something delicious with what I have plenty of.

Wasn't looking forward to chopping up a lot of veggies and then cooking up the Quesadillas without ANY spicing.....so I loaded up on a veggie spice mix. Found the combination of the cheese with the spices to be very flavourful! Don't think I'd try this without any spices.

Turned out as expected.  I made according to recipe.    I generally do, and then decides how to improve. Be sure to add some sort of spice or fajita mix because otherwise bland. Served w salsa and sour cream.

I don't know why quesadillas haven't been in our dinner rotation. I used green peppers, green onions, bok Choi and zucchini. I used packaged shredded tex mex cheese and a sprinkle of taco seasoning.
Thank you for giving me this idea. My husband isn't complaining and he's eating vegetables. I consider this a win!

My normally meat-focused family didn't miss the meat at all in this recipe.  Even my 17-year-old son who normally hates mushrooms thought it rocked!  Will definitely be making this again.

A tasty and healthy dinner option. I modified the ingredients to more suit our taste. I added a dash (1/8 tsp each) of sea salt, garlic powder and dried basil. I reduced the amount of cheese  using 1/8 cup on the bottom and 1/8 on the top. Great meal even my non vegetarian wife liked it.,

Quesadillas using ONLY ingredients one can find at the local Farmer’s market, what a great idea. Shop local! Our town is pretty small, and the farmer’s market tends to die down a little around the end of summer, so i had to make due with a Kale, Radish, and brussel sprout quesadilla. Topped that off with some freshly made LOCAL cheese curds. Not the sort of combination i would usually try, but it’s worth keeping our local farmers’ tables as full as mine!

What a great way to employ vegetables from my own garden. Easy to prepare; easy to make; and everyone enjoyed them. This recipe is a definite keeper.

Simple. Delicious. Healthy. I followed suggestions from a couple of the reviews, adding seasoning  (I used McCormick’s Garlic ‘n Herb and a pinch of salt) and baking the quesadillas in a 425 degree oven for 8-9 minutes. I will definitely make this again!

Great recipe!  I wanted to add a little Mediterranean flavor to it, so I topped them with plain tzatziki sauce (plain kefir, garlic, cucumber, salt and oil).  Perfect taste! Will make them again.

This was the perfect lunch dish for a Sunday afternoon. We had an abundance of fresh zucchini & yellow squash from our garden and I used homemade salsa over the whole wheat tortillas. Delicious!

loved the food. my stove wont keep a constant temp though, so tortillas were either too done or not done enough. I used an iron pan. Any suggestions, besides geta new stove.

I did a few modifications. I used only one green zuchini and I added black olives. You can really alter the taste using different cheeses... great versatile recipe ! You could also add some black beans if you don't like olives.

Great idea!  It needed a lil more flavor though, so I added fresh garlic and cilantro to the veggies after I cooked them for some extra flavor.  It's a hit.

These were sooo good! I used the veggies I had (as suggested). So, mine consisted of red and green bell peppers, spinach, mushrooms, shallots, and corn. I also used colby because that's a preference and whole wheat carb balance burritos. I toasted one side in the pan them flipped them and filled the toasted side with the veggies and cheese while the other side toasted. I don't like soggy tortillas and thought this would help prevent that. It worked perfectly! These were really filling and incredible without seasoning! I will definitely be making these again!

Made this today (8/21/18)--had gotten a couple zucchinis from someone so thought this would be a healthier way of using them instead of zucchini bread or bars.  I used red, yellow, and orange mini peppers; zucchini in place of the yellow squash since I didn't have any; and added 3-4 handfuls of fresh spinach.  When I removed the quesadilla from the plan, I topped it with sour cream and picante.  This was easy to make.  Tastes like other veggie quesadillas I've had.  Also, I would probably use a little more cheese than what is called for in the recipe.  I agree with others that the filling seemed a little sparse.  When I spread the amount called for on one tortilla, it was at least an inch from the edge of the tortilla.  Smaller tortillas (or doubling the filling) would probably be a good idea.  I'm not one for hot/spicy food but  agree with other reviewers who noted the taste was rather bland.  Maybe a little chili powder or some other spice added when cooking the veggies.

Super fast & easy - and this is coming from someone who hates to cook! - so we'll definitely make these again. Left out the mushrooms because I forgot to buy more! Didn't put any cooking spray or oil on the pan - just let the veggies do their thing. Added some taco seasoning for a little boost. This makes enough for two meals, but keep the veggies separate - don't end up the next day with a soggy tortilla like I did. Still tasted good though!

I added cumin, salt, salsa, and garlic powder to add more flavor. I also added black beans for protein. It's such a great (and yummy) way to eat vegetables without feeling like your just eating vegetables. Went over really well with the family.

Love this recipe! 
Very easy and quick. I didn't change anything but you could add other vegetables. I will make put this in my regular recipes and make it often.
Update* I made this for friends on a girls getaway and they loved it too. I didn't change anything this time either.

I didn't use squash but I used all the other ingredients listed and they turned out great! I'll definitely be making these again. I did find that the amount of each ingredient wasn't enough so I'll just make more next time :)

This is definitely something I will make again. My husband and I have decided to become vegetarians. And this recipe just hit the spot!The only thing I did different was changed the cheese to mexican blend and did not add mushrooms. This is a great entree, really.

I liked it. I put some leftover meat into the quesadilla and traded the zucchini and squash for other veggies, and it tasted wonderful ;)

I made this recipe after going to the farmers market today.  I didn't have any mushroom or red pepper.  I added green peppers, yellow peppers and added fresh tomatoes as well.  I served it with salsa.  My family loved it.  Just watch how long you fry it as 1 1/2 minutes per side was plenty of time.

Add canned black beans (rinsed and drained), diced jalapeno, a little frozen corn, and some garlic powder or minced garlic for even more protein and extra flavor and kick. This dish is surprisingly filling! I doubled the recipe, and my bf and I were stuffed before we finished (and we are big eaters who were pretty hungry). I will definitely make this again!

The combination of veggies was real good :) I added cilantro to my veggies because that is the best herb in the world. I agree with some other reviewers, that the veggies needed some spice. I wish I would've sautéed the veggies with garlic. Maybe add cumin? Definitely top with guac!!!

I added just a hint of more cheese with a little less veggie mix but added some green onions, spinach, and black beans! I think this recipe is super good and just add or take to your taste! Will definitely make more of this with variations of what I have available.

This was really good. I made it as written, minus the peppers. This is one of those recipes that is very versatile. I will make it again. Maybe throw in some black beans next time. I wish it were a little easier to flip to the other side without sliding. Perhaps practice makes perfect. I will keep trying!

My 10mo baby, toddler, little girl, and husband ALL loved this! Big win in my book! I followed the recipe until they were assembled, and baked them on a greased baking sheet for 5 min at 425. Used avocado and sour cream to top it off. Thanks for the great recipe to add to our collection!

My daughter is a vegetarian and I am always looking for new recipes. I did as others did and baked them in the oven. The only changes I made - l added some garlic and a few mushrooms to the mix. I didn't use red pepper but cut up some tiny tomatoes  . I only had very large tortillas. I halved the recipe and folded them over. They were delicious. My daughter gave them 5 stars too. I will add this recipe to the rotation. Thank you for it.

Never had made quesadillas before, but this turned out really good.  Omitted the red pepper & yellow squash and added a little Perfect Pinch garlic & herb seasoning.  Will definitely make again.

Really does deserve more thasn 5 stars!  It was delicious even without adding salt.  I had some frozen Key West Chicken (from this site) that I chopped and added to the cooked veges.  I will try adding a little balsamic vinegar next time.  I couldn't eat this slowly!

These were Amazing! I loved the blend of vegetable flavors! I did make a couple of SMALL changes. I only had an orange pepper on hand so I subbed that for the red and also added a little mozzarella in with the cheddar but followed everything else to a "T". Will definitely be making these again!

When using reduced fat and whole wheat ingredients, I think you need to beef up the herbs and spices. The addition of chili powder, garlic, cumin, and oregano to the stir-fried veggies really ramps up the flavor. Extra virgin olive oil also makes the flavor more rich. Also when I make quesadillas, I fill half and fold over the top. Makes it SO much easier to flip! No pieces of cheese and veggies all over the pan!

I chopped, then  placed the veggies in 1 Tbsp of grapeseed oil in a plastic zip bag adding seasoning salt & pepper. After thoroughly coating the veggies with oil and seasonings in the bag, I poured the oiled veggies into a grilling basket and roasted then on the patio grill. Remove the veggies when cooked and assemble the quesadillas. Spread a little oil on the both sides of the outside of the tortilla of the assembled quesadillas and finish grilling on the hot grill. Now, that's a great summer meal.

We thought this was great!  It made enough for us to fill 6 small tortillas which we folded over and baked for 7 minutes.  We used 1 cup of extra old cheddar, butternut squash, and added some garlic with the veggies but no other changes.

My picky  kids didn't realize it was made of only veggies.  the only thing I did different was add a store brought packet of fajitas seasoning.

This is my go to appetizer, although, I spread a layer of refried beans on the bottom tortilla, then add the sauteed veggies and top with the shredded cheese.  They're a hit whever I go

Throw a couple of splashes of Balsamic vinegar in with the vegetables when you're cooking them. It's a game changer.

Recipe #1 of our new vegetarian/vegan lifestyle! I added fresh basil, sea salt, black pepper, green bell pepper, fresh minced garlic, and onion powder. I have a quesadilla maker which made for easy cooking. Used my food chopper but next time I would slice the veggies instead so that the quesadillas are thicker.

This was my first try at quesadillas and they were a big hit! I doubled the recipe (for six kids and two adults) and added in a can of corn. I'm only giving this four stars because it desperately  needs spices to pull it up to five stars. Add in sea salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and basil, and you'll have a ten star dish. Serve with sour cream and salsa.

So good! Also added some curry seasonings with salt and pepper when grilling the veggies. Used two different types of cheese that I had on hand with soft corn tortillas. Added fresh Thai basil and just a bit of parsley before closing up the quesadilla to grill. Excellent for all the leftover veggies in the fridge that I hate to waste.

Made these for the family. The hardest thing was trying to brown each side. Added a few plum tomatoes and loved it. Quick and easy. I chopped veggies up on a Sunday and make it on a Tuesday.

Instead of using cooking spray I used olive oil again. It made the tortilla more crispy.

I HATE vegetables.  But I'm trying to eat better so I tried these.  I sautéed the vegetables in a small amount of garlic-infused olive oil and sprinkled them with salt, pepper, and minced onion. I drizzled olive oil over a low-carb tortilla and filled with the cheese and vegetables.  I baked at 425 for about 8 minutes.  They were amazing.  So good.  I can't believe this is vegetables!

Using my food processor to chop everything up together made this super quick and simple. It was delicious and I will be making these often! A little sprinkle of part-skim mozzarella was all the cheese I needed.

These are amazing!  I served with avocado, salsa, and sour cream.I added black beans and black olives with the rest of the veggies and a dash of chipotle seasoning. Baked them as suggested by other reviews, since I had to make several.

I did this and added a little bit of pollo seasoning from knorr.  the kids had no idea I only used veggies in the quesadillas and they ate every piece.  no leftovers!!!  After they were done I told them they had just participated in meatless Monday and they couldn't believe.  a real hit in our house and very easy to make.

This was AWESOME.  I discarded mushrooms for personal preference, removed the zucchini and squash due to poor selection, and added broccoli and cauliflower.  I got the oil nice and hot and cooked the veggies 7.5 minutes.  Served with salsa, guacamole, and smashed black beans.  YUM.  Next time I might try adding some seasoning (cilantro, cayenne, and even some cumin). It was definitely great as is though.

wonderful! This is truly a quick, easy, and delicious recipe. I used green & yellow peppers and white onion sauteed with garlic powder. Used the great tip by a previous reviewer and brushed olive oil on exterior of tortilla, loaded it up with cheddar cheese and folded in half, backed in oven at 425 for 5 minutes and it came out amazing!!! Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe as a jumping off point to use up some ingredients I had on hand.  I agree with the recipe submitter, use any veggies you like.  I used red pepper, red onion and black beans with a mixture of cheeses.  Next time I may add some garlic or some seasonings.  Also, for my stove - I needed to reduce the heat to med/low after removing the veggies and adding the tortillas, so as not to burn the tortillas.  Thanks for a great recipe, jrbaker!

I/we loved these!  Like others suggested, I added a bit of cumin and Mexican chili to taste.  I cooked the veggies, refrigerated them and then assembled the quesadillas later.  For each one, I filled one side of the tortilla and folded it in half.  I cooked mine on the grill (sprayed each side lightly with PAM) and even my kids liked them! I served them with sour cream and mashed avocado.  Since the recipe calls for 1/2 cup of each vegetable, I have veggies to spare - so we're having them again tonight!! :)

Oops sorry, but I made it vegan and did not use any oil!  No need when sauteing vegees, they had plenty of liquid.  I did spice while it was cooking with sea salt, pepper, crushed red pepper and cumin, then added a clove of garlic during last few minutes.  No need to spray non stick pan with oil for burritos each, they were nicely crisp.  I also made a larger amount and just used one of each whole red pepper, red onion, zucchini and yellow squash, had no mushrooms.  Also used Daiya cheddar cheese.  Twas Awesome!!!  So this was really a healthy dish with very low fat.

These were yummy!  I added a bit of taco seasoning, and next time I will add some more.  Loved all the veggie goodness--not your average quesadilla!  Thanks for the idea!

I cooked the vegetable in a pan in the oil. As suggested I added onion powder and garlic powder. I also added garlic salt and about 1/8th of a chicken bouillon cube and black beans. Butter the back of the tortillas.

Just made this for my husband and I and we both enjoyed it very much. As suggested by others, I sprinkled the veggies with garlic and onion powder. I baked them in the oven at 425F for 10 minutes as well (brushed the tortillas with olive oil first). As for added ingredients...I added some spinach to the veggies in the skillet in the last few seconds to wilt and included kidney beans. I served these with salsa, sour cream, and sliced fruit. Perfect vegetarian meal that totally satisfied us.

Just made this and it tasted great! I had to make a couple of changes bc I didn't have all the ingredients but I think if I made it exactly as written it would still be a 4star recipe bc it lacked seasoning. My veggies: zucchini, red pepper and yellow onion. I doubled the zucchini and seasoned the veggies with garlic powder, pepper and cumin. I also added canned black beans to the veggies.
The cumin added a nice kick and I would recommend it.

These are fabulous! I used a mixture of yellow squash, red onion, orange and red bell peppers and white mushrooms. These went really fast at the event where I served them. I think I will keep the vegetable mixture (already cooked) in my fridge for quick quesadilla snacks.

These were awesome! I had some zuccini and squash left over from the garden and some red onion so I gave these a try, and I'm so glad I did! The flavors of the vegetables worked really well together. I've never made quesadillas before, and I learned to make sure the temp is nearer to medium and that the tortilla is crisp before flipping so that nothing spills out. I used fat- free cheddar cheese and it worked fine; I might just put a little ore next time. I don't think it needed any seasoning though it would probably taste good with some anyway. Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good, I have made these several times and changed filling based on what I had on hand. I have added corn and salsa and some black beans for protein.

OMG!  I had no idea that making a veggie quesadilla would be so yummy!  I cooked the veggies a little longer than it said and used my big tortillas from Bountiful Baskets added a little chicken and they were so good.  My non veggie eating daughter asked if I would cook them again and why would I say no to that.  I would highly suggest these to anyone.

Tasted wonderful! Made some for me and my brother. I used regular cheese on mine and soy cheese on his. He loved it! Still felt like it needed an extra something at the end. Maybe next time I will try cooking the vegetables with more spices/seasoning. I used onion powder, sea salt, and Ms. Dash. Otherwise, it was very, very good!

I loved these!  I used onion, orange bell pepper, yellow squash, minced garlic, and spinach.  Then used sharp cheese, hot sauce and chopped avacado to finish.  Also used the carb smart flour tortillas that have lots of fiber and protein but softer than whole wheat tortillas.  Really loved the combo and how healthy!  Thanks for submitting!

Parents and older kids loved it!  Younger kids were not so happy about vegetables instead of chicken.  I doubled the recipe for 5 of us and added minced garlic.  Also good on corn tortillas for the gluten intolerant.

Very good but needed more flavor.  Added some garlic, sea salt, pepper and red pepper flakes.  Hate rubbery mushrooms so replaced with carrots.

This recipe was great!  The only thing I added was a poblano pepper I roasted and chopped up.  Thanks for a great quick recipe!

I made these for dinner. Luckily I bought way more than enough of the ingredients and ended up using about twice as much of the recommended amount of everything. They turned out perfect. If I would have used the listed amount they wouldn't have been as filling. Great recipe. Delicious

These are awesome.  I mixed and matched with whatever fresh vegetables I had and they turned out amazing.  Even my picky husband, who never likes it when I make quesadillas because I use whole wheat tortillas, loved these.

I absolutley loved these. I made them for a party. Most people didn't even realize they were meatless. One person asked me what was in it and I told them and she was like I hate everything you name but love the quesadilla. I added some garlic and herb seasoning.

Super tasty! Probably one of the best veggie quesadillas I’ve ever had! I used jalapeno tortillas instead of whole wheat and added about a teaspoon of taco seasoning to the sautéed veggies. I also drained the veggies just after cooking them. I cooked the quesadillas as directed. I served them with homemade guacamole, Spanish rice, and beans. … Although the quesadillas alone are plenty! Good recipe.

I used the vegs the recipe called for, just added a little fresh spinach and shook in a bit of Tony Chachere's. The one thing I should have done - but didn't - was use a nonstick pan. Let's just say, I had a mess to chisel out of my skillet. Otherwise, a yummy and quick recipe.

DELICIOUS!!!! and so easy!  Even my 10 yr old who claims to hate, squash of any sort,mushrooms and peppers snarfed it down, and requested one the next day, all the while stating, I should keep these ingredients on hand so she can have this more.  It's is just so good.

Excellent healthy choice for dinner. It's a versatile recipe that can work with whatever fresh vegetables you have on hand. I covered the "empty" half as suggested with cheese and after that melted I flipped it over on the full half. Also added chicken for the by the bigger eaters in our house. It's a keeper.

This was FABULOSO! Pretty much followed the recipe and the reviews!  I didn't have any mushrooms, but had the rest.  So, I added diced garlic, garlic and onion powders, red pepper flakes, a pinch of chili powder, and McCormick's Smoky Sweet Pepper Seasoning Blend, which I had purchased for another recipe. I used the new CANDY red onions...oh, so sweet!   Because I have difficulty flipping a pancake, I elected to fill 1/2 of the tortilla as suggested [using Kraft's Mexican Cheddar w/ Jalepnos shredded cheese] and baked in the oven.  So very satisfying and hopefully, fairly healthy!  LOVED this recipe, and will make it again and again!  THANK YOU JRBAKER!

This was a great idea and very good.  I added some seasonings while cooking the vegtables.  Red pepper flakes gave it a nice spice.  You can change this recipe with whatever you have on hand. That is what makes it a keeper.

I didn't have squash, but I used what vegtables I had in the frig (snow peas, onions, mushrooms, etc.) for a delightful meal.  Even as leftovers they are good!

I didn't know what to do with the squash and to be honest I wondered why my husband even bought squash for us to grow, but I am SOOO glad he did.  This recipe is the best thing ever.  I had people over and we made it together and everyone LOVED it!  Even my 5 picky eating children!  They can't wait until the other squash get big enough to pick :)
