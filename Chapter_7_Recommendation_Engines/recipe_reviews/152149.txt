This is a very tasty and easy side dish!

Just a tip, I find this recipe to be much better if you leave out the milk and the mustard, and mix in a little garlic powder, paprika and fresh ground black pepper, along with a handful of grated parmesan cheese.  I used Tex Mex cheese on top, which is a combination of chedder and jack.

Omitting the milk makes it much less soupy.  It will also firm up more if you let it sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.

I was VERY happy with this recipe...the broccoli came out nice and tender :)  I think I will add extra cheddar, next time...we love cheese ;)

For the person who had a bad experience with this recipe, you said you doubled it...did you allow extra cooking time too?  Using raw broccoli or not baking it long enough are the only reasons I can think of for your broccoli to be tough :(

I was looking for a broccoli noodle casserole, and I didn't find what I wanted, so I used this recipe as a base and added some noodles and other vegetables (steamed carrots, sliced mushrooms, red onion). I made the sauce exactly as written, though I reserved about 1/3 of the cheese to sprinkle on top, and I put the bread crumbs (actually croutons that I put through the food processor) on top of that. It was delicious- even better than I expected. Don't omit the mustard- it adds a nice flavour without being recognizable as mustard. Great recipe, whether you use it as written or as a starting point like I did.

This dish was a good side dish but kind of bland. I added rice and more cheese but it still didn't hold enough flavor. I don't think I will make this until I find a review that seems to be more tasty.

Very good side dish. I used fresh broccoli instead of frozen. Made it along side of a chicken dish. Perfect combination.

I enjoyed this as my main dish, but found it to be too salty for my taste.  I chose to mix the soup, milk, and mustard together and the poured it over the broccoli and cheese.  I topped it with cornbread stuffing to make it heartier since I knew it would be an entree.  If I make it again, I will definitely seek out lower sodium ingredients.

Always solid as a side dish!  I substitute bread crumbs for french fried onions all across the top ad fresh broccoli is a must.  This is a huge favorite in my home and quick and easy to make.  Although it's not the healthiest side ever (ahem, so much yummy cheese) it's certainly a delicious crowd pleaser.

Wonderful!    Like others, I used fresh broccoli and steamed it a bit in the microwave first.   I also added 10 large white mushrooms, quartered.   Added  garlic powder, onion powder and fresh cracked pepper.   It didn't say if it should be cooked covered or uncovered so I cooked it covered 15 minutes, uncovered the reamaining 15 minutes.   Probably should have been uncovered the entire time.   I also substituted panko for the bread crumbs.   More light and airy.   Loved it!   I'll share it with the family and definitely make it again.   Oh, and I definitely thought the mustard added something special.

Pretty good.  It was a little watery, so I'll probably reduce the milk next time.  My husband isn't a huge broccoli fan and liked this.

I doubled this recipe and made it for Thanksgiving. It turned out very well. I added a little extra cheese on top before covering with the bread crumb mixture. A very good recipe.

I made this the other day for our St. Patrick's Day "green" potluck lunch at work. Everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe & added 10 minutes baking time or until the bread crumbs turned golden. It turned out perfectly. I, too, thought it was a little bland but I used the "25% less sodium" Campbell's Mushroom Soup & mild shredded cheddar cheese. I think next time I will use the regular soup & sharp cheddar cheese. I think that should help.

Great recipe. I just tweek it a little bit.  Less mustard, a little more cheese and I also add more breadcrumbs and sprinkle a little garlic salt on it before I bake it.  Everyone goes crazy for it.

I made this dish by the recipe, and the mustard was too much. I will enjoy trying it again without it. The bread crumbs were a great topping.

Fixed this yesterday with T-bone and a baked sliced potato and onions dish I make.  We really liked it.  I was worried about the milk factor after reading most reviews.  I didn't have just broccoli; I used a mix of broccoli and cauliflower.  I prepped the frozen veggies by nuking them for 4 minutes, rinsed and drained in colander. I even placed them on double layers of paper towels to soak up additional moisture.  Frozen vegetable have a lot of moisture to them. I didn't have 2c of cheddar, so I used 1c cheddar and 1c+ parmesan.  Still concerned about the milk, I only used 1/4c (could have used 1/2..it would not have hurt it).  Since I had left over French's onions, I used them, adding last half of baking.  Very good.  The mustard is a must and also added garlic powder and pepper.  Will definitely make again.  Going to try with fresh veggies; gotta be even better.

Used fresh broccoli instead of frozen and added some cooked chicken breast and diced mushroom but otherwise loved the recipe. A flavourful side dish.

I have made this several times as we love broccoli.(but we do not like mushrooms) so when I make this I use either a can of cream of broccoli soup. OR  a can of cheddar cheese soup. and it is delicious.
