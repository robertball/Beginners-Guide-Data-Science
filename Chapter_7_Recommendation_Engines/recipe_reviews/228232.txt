OH YUM...This is AWESOME!!! I made as written, but a smaller version, using mini ice cream sandwiches (10), layered in a loaf pan (that I lined w/ plastic wrap for easier removal/cutting), w/ an 8oz. whipped topping, and just eyeballed the caramel sauce and peanuts. We did drizzled it w/ chocolate sauce just before eating it and that really put it over the top! I would be totally confident in making this for company...it's THAT good...A definite keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a great recipe! I "baked" it in a clear glass pan and used hot fudge topping instead of caramel.I put the peanuts in a little baggie and crushed them before adding and also added half cherries to the top layer.It not only looked delicious,it tasted heavenly!

This is so easy & delicious. I drizzled chocolate sauce over the bottom layer and instead of peanuts I used skor bits. When serving, you can dress it up with some raspberries or sliced strawberries for a bit of colour.  I made it for a family reunion & everybody raved about it. I'll be sure to make it again.

Cannot go wrong--total winner! I used one layer of caramel sauce, and on another layer fudge sauce. I added Heath toffee bits to each layer. There was not a bite left and we were all discussing the variations you could make of this according to your tastes. I will take this to every party this summer.

I've made this various ways throughout the years.  Substitute peanuts for pecans, caramel, and hot fudge--turtle pie.  Use hot fudge and heath bars, butter finger, reese cups,etc  Each time I make it, it is always a hit!

This cake garnered so much praise and was so easy to make!  I made it for a birthday party and was able to assemble it as the party was starting.  I made the caramel myself with butter, vanilla ice cream, a bit of brown sugar (for color) and fructose to lower the blood sugar impact of this cake.  We omitted the peanuts.  I sprinkled confetti candies on top for a pretty presentation and it was a hit!

Instead of making one big 13x9 cake, I used 2 smaller cake pans to make 2 smaller cakes! I wrapped them well and put them in the freezer for unexpected company.  DELICIOUS !!!!!!

The layers slide around and fall apart while trying to eat it.  My family thought that even a little bit of caramel made it too rich.  Would not make it again or recommend it to anyone.

It is double yummy if you poke holes in sandwiches and soak in coffee liqueur.I omit the fudge sauce,
It doesn't need the extra calories.  Just ice with cool whip and top with nuts or coconut,

Everyone loved this. Is really easy to make; the hardest part is taking the paper off of the ice cream sandwiches. Feeds a lot of people!

I made this as directed. I will not make it again. I am shocked at all the 5 star reviews. It tastes just like what it is. Frozen ice cream sandwiches from a box. Nothing special about it, sorry.

Instead of peanuts I added crushed up pretzels, almonds, and chocolate chunks. I also swapped out the caramel for hot fudge. YUUUUMMM!!! I was worried it was going to be too sweet but it turned out amazing. Brought it to Easter dinner and everyone said this was my new dish to bring to all the fam jams from here on out. No problem considering how ridiculously easy this is to make.

I made this dessert for an Independence Day cookout at my aunt and uncle's house.  It was a huge hit!  There were 3 other desserts on the table, and mine was everyone's favorite.  I assembled this dessert in a Corning Ware 13"X9" dish, which isn't exactly square as the sides of the dish are at an angle.  I wasn't counting the ice cream sandwiches as I was assembling the dessert because ice cream sandwiches melt rather quickly! When I looked in the 24 ct. box of ice cream sandwiches, I had 6 left over, so I didn't use all the ice cream sandwiches as the recipe stated.  Oh, well!  The next time I make this I will try cutting 4 ice cream sandwiches in fourths in an attempt to completely fill up the bottom of the dish. 
**Helpful hint:  For those of you who have a side-by-side refrigerator, the freezer side is very narrow.  I think my Kenmore has 22 cubic ft. of storage capacity. I had to empty a shelf in order to put this dessert in the freezer.  The dish WILL NOT sit flat on a shelf, so it will have to sit at an angle.  After 30 minutes, I took the dish out and turned it around so everything wouldn't slide out the side.  I rotated my dish at least twice before it actually began to freeze/set.
