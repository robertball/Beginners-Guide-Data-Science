We loved this! So buttery good. Only had 2 boxes of mix so cut recipe by a 1/3 and came out perfect in an 8x8 pan.

I didn't have any cream of corn soup so thickened the corn liquid with corn starch . It was still good.  I will made it often.

Family loved it! I made exactly a 1/3 of the recipe in an 8x8 pan. Used actually 1/2 can of  cream corn tho. My oopsie was that I mixed all ingredients up in bowl, poured into pan, and baked. Turned out perfect yummy sweet and super moist.
