AR: please use the original recipe that was submitted!! This published recipe has the lemon juice and zest reduced.  With the reduction of lemon juice, these can not be called lemon cupcakes, there will be very very little if any lemon flavoring. I spent weeks tweaking this recipe and made many less-than-mediocre cupcakes until I came up with the one I originally submitted. I've tried this cupcake with store bought gluten free blend and they were awful! The GF blend recipe you want to use is also in my recipe box. I can almost guarantee that this particular published recipe will not turn out good with many of the store bought GF flour mixes.

Lemony goodness in a gluten free form. I originally made a batch of these exactly as written, using the flour mix by the submitter, but the texture was off as well as there seemed to be too much baking powder. The second batch was much better. I only used 1 tsp of baking powder and 1 cup of the original flour mix + 1/8 cup of sorghum flour to give it a bit of density. This proved to be the right mixture rendering a cupcake to sink your teeth into. I used a lemon-lime glaze on top. Thank you for the recipe.

I used my standard GF flour mix of Sorghum, Rice & Tapioca flour.  The texture was a bit spongy.  Also I added Lemon extract, but it is still a very subtle lemon flavor.  Glad I added a raspberry to each cupcake.  I used raspberry puree in the buttercream frosting.  Will try again to improve on texture.

If I were to make these cupcakes again, I would double the recipe because they turned out a little small. Besides that, I wouldn't change a thing, all in all,  these were superb cupcakes.

(p.s. Use actual lemon juice, I hand squeezed mine, to give them the lemon kick.)

Came out just right and were delicious. Only thing is substituted vanilla for lemon extract. I also used freshly squeezed lemon juice.

I must've cooked them just a bit too long, because they ended up dry. However, the flavor was excellent, and the kiddos devoured them!
