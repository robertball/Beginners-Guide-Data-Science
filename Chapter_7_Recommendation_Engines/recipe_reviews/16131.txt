I have been on a three-year quest to find the perfect ranch dressing recipe, and I finally found it!  This is great!  I did make modifications to suit our Texas taste buds (ranch dressing is a condiment here!), but this is a wonderful start.  My modifications are to 1) Change the mayo/sour cream/buttermilk to 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup buttermilk, 2)Increase the garlic to 1/2 tsp., and 3) Add 1/2 tsp. vegetable oil (for consistency).  Thanks Dawnia!

Pretty good. If you want a dip for cut veggies - use the sour cream. If you want a dressing to drizzle over salad - use buttermilk.

I'm a chef in Southern, CA, and 27 years old...best 'simple' recipe for ranch/house dressing that I've ever made in a pinch. I had suprise guests come over, and my buddy loves my cobb salad. I left my recipes at work, and needed to make a good blue cheese dressing. I looked up this recipe and then added a tsp. of worstechire sauce, and gorgonzola cheese to make the blue cheese dressing and it was great. I saved half of the original ranch dressiing and had it woth some buffalo wings, carrot, and celery the next night, and by then it had developed a fantastic flavor. GREAT RECIPE.

I quite like this recipe with a few changes of my own and from those of other reviewers.  First I decreased the sour cream to only 1/4 c. as I thought the sour cream flavor was a little overpowering.  I added 1/2 c. buttermilk to the mayo and used 1/8 tsp. seasoned salt in place of the regular salt, I also added 1/4 tsp. vinegar as had been suggested and upped the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp.  With these changes I gave it 5 stars.  Thanks for the recipe, it is wonderful!

Bottled dressings aren't even close to hanging with this homemade version! I loved it! I used buttermilk and also used fresh chives. It is imperative to let it chill in the fridge for a while. Just after making it, I tried it and it tasted "mayonnaisey." But after three hours it just tasted great! Thanks for the recipe, it is definetly a keeper.

This is absolutely the best ranch dressing I have ever tasted!  I make it all the time for my husband and when I have guests over.  Everyone asks for the recipe!  If I use it as a dip I leave it just the way it is.  As a salad dressing I thin it out a bit with 2% milk.  Always yummy!

I've made this a number of times now, and everyone always compliments it.  Based on earlier reviews, I use 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream, and buttermilk, but otherwise leave the recipe unchanged.  It is a thicker dressing (even with the buttermilk modification), perfect for dips, but also compliments salads nicely, sticking to the salad and not gathering uselessly in the bottom of the bowl.  As others have mentioned, the flavors blend together much better after a day or two.  Have I found my Ranch Nirvana?  Not yet, but this is as close as anything else I've tried!  Thanks, Dawnia!

Prepared as written this is a perfectly acceptable mayonnaise-based dip.  But that's not what I wanted.  I wanted ranch dressing, easily achieved by backing off on the mayonnaise and thinning it out with buttermilk.  Dried herbs, if they're fresh, are just fine; but since I had them I used fresh herbs to taste.  Much improved if prepared an hour or two in advance.

Very thick, and very good.  I cut the recipe in half.  I did a combo of 1/4 c. of mayo, 1/4 c. of sour cream and 1/4 c. of buttermilk.  I also added 1/4 tsp. of ground mustard and 1/2 tsp. of sugar.  I had fresh chives so I used that in place of dried.  A nice change from bottled dressing.

This dressing is awesome!  I don't have any onion powder, so I double up the garlic powder.  The dill really gives it a wonderful taste.  I also used this dressing to dip carrots and make Ranch chicken with.  Dip your chicken in, roll in bread crumbs, and bake!  It's excellent!  Thanks for a great recipe!

"HOW" incredible is this recipe? Let me tell you! 1) I hate "Ranch Dressing" with every fibre of my being! I grew up before the current "Ranch Dressing Craze" and never understood the attraction. I prefer oil & vinegar style or less creamy dressings, but there was always "something" about store bought Ranch Dressings that set my teeth on edge! Yesterday, my Grandson asked for the dreaded Ranch Dressing on his salad! I grudgingly came HERE, found this recipe, read 20 reviews, and made it, vowing to not taste a molecule of it. Served it immediately, rather than waiting; what did I care, I wasn't having any?!? Well, I'm now eating my words! My GS went insane for THIS recipe! I was forced to try it and it blew my mind! THIS is not the awful stuff served in restaurants! I am now a dedicated fan of this dressing for life! 2) Another reason to love this recipe? My buttermilk and Half & Half come in identical containers from my dairy. It was only 24 hours later, that I saw that instead of adding buttermilk to this, I had grabbed the wrong container and actually used Half & Half!!!!! If this recipe can survive that kind of mistake, it's a 10 star recipe in my book! Bravo, Dawnia, on teaching this Old Dog some New Tricks! LOL

This is delicious and easy!  Turned out nice and thick and not "vinegar" tasting like so many are.  The only thing I changed is that I added 1Tb. lemon juice to thin it out a little.  If you want to use it as a pour-on dressing, you might want to add a little milk to thin it out more but if you mix the salad in a bowl before serving, I found that the moisture from the salad itself automatically  dilutes it to the right consistency.  The dressing actually clings to the salad and doesn't end up at the bottom of the bowl!

Now I much prefer vinaigrette dressings over creamy ones, but I made this dressing for a steak salad as my partner does like creamy dressings. He liked it of course, but I was surprised to find I liked it also. Very much so in fact. I made it as stated and served it that way. The next day, however, I thinned it with a little milk to make it more of a pouring dressing consistency and that's the way I shall make it in future. On a side note, I did find the sauce a just a whisper on the salty side as there is already salt in the mayo, however it was perfectly fine after adding the milk to thin the dressing.

I know I may be beating a dead horse, but this ranch dressing is fantastic! I mixed about 8 batches worth of seasoning together and added about 3 teaspoons of the finished seasoning with the cup of mayo and 1/2 cup of buttermilk. I knew this dressing was delicious when I had to go out and immediately purchase veggies just to dip in it, but I had no idea I would be polishing off the whole batch in one weekend. I usually only purchase Hidden Valley Ranch, but this dressing is like a gourmet restaurant ranch and is far superior. I even tried to use up the rest of the HVR I had in the fridge after finishing this and almost gagged at the taste of that bottled stuff. I definitely recommend letting this dressing sit overnight as to allow the flavors to mingle and the dried herbs to reconsitute (if you can let it sit that long!) Truly addicting!!!

YUM!  I'll tinker with the consistancy as a dressing, but this was VERY TASTY & great as a dip (good with a vege tray)!  It really has a better flavor if you use the buttermilk, I've tried it both ways & the sour cream takes away from the flavor, it's still tasty, but better with the buttermilk.  This was great with the texas ranch chicken from this site.  Thanks Dawnia!

This is the way I always make ranch dressing, with one modification. If you want a buttermilk "taste", add some lemon juice to the mix, which essentially turns the sour cream into buttermilk. I usually use a couple of tablespoons.  This also thins out the dressing a bit and gives it a nice fresh tang.

I've made this recipe many times & have (I think) perfected it. When I made it the 1st time, it was way too thick & way too dill-y. Next time I added the milk/buttermilk as suggested by reviewers, too runny. The last time I made it I added equal amounts of mayo/sour cream. Left the dill as is & doubled all the other seasonings & then added buttermilk at the end to my desired thickness. Perfection!

I followed Christy's advice and used 1/2 cup each of sour cream, mayo, and buttermilk (just under 1/2 cup of milk and a tsp or so of vinegar worked as a substitution in a pinch) and it was awesome. Thanks for sharing, Dawnia!

Good. Even better? Taking the amount of dry seasonings called for and using it like you would a dry mix packet of ranch that costs about $3 from the grocery store. I use the dry mix in cream cheese for veggie dips, bacon ranch pasta salad form this site, and countless other recipes.

Not impressed at all...was worried a whole cup of mayo would overpower the flavor so used only half of cup and still thought it overpowered the taste...So I added more sour cream...followed the rest of the recipe and it's just ok.

I have been using this recipe for several years now.  I haven't bought ranch dressing since.  I add extra onion and garlic powder.  Today when I made it, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and added just a dash of white vinegar and what a difference it made.  It adds that little something that seemed to be missing.

I used buttermilk, and the texture was nice, but all I could taste in here was dill. I would cut the dill in half next time.

This is the ranch dressing I've been looking for...I tried several from this site and none worked for my tastes. This one is just right. I halved the mayo and subbed sour cream for the other half, and used all fat free or reduced fat products, but kept everything else just the same. When I have fresh dill, I'll use that instead of the dried, but this works perfectly and I can finally say that I make *all* my own salad dressings. Goodbye preservatives and chemicals!

Fantastic recipe. I make this recipe minus the may0 and sour cream, and up the servings to 72. I store this in a jar in my pantry to a ready to go quick spoon out the mixture and add to the mayo and sour cream for dressing ready to go when I am out of time. Great with just sour cream for a veggie dip, or thinned with buttermilk for a thinner salad dressing. My family likes it with less dill, but that is just personal preference. Thank you, Dawnia, for sharing.

This one is better than Hidden Valley. I used 1/2 cup yogurt and only 1/2 cup mayo and it still taste great.

This recipe uses the right amounts of each seasoning.  It's a great recipe as-is, and you can easily tweak it to suit your own taste.  After reading the reviews here, I opted to use buttermilk instead of the sour cream to make it a little thinner.  There was a little something off or missing in the overall flavor, so I also added a few squeezes of lemon juice to brighten it up.  Perfect!

I made this dressing for tossed greens last evening.  Made it as is, but seemed to need a bit more "tang" to it.  Added a splash of lemon juice, it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

i found this recipe to be fantastic!!  

i modified it to my wife's favorite dressing, Parmesan Peppercorn Ranch, by omitting the dill, adjusting the garlic and pepper to 1/2 tsp. each, and adding 1/4c of grated parmesan and 2 Tbsp. of vinegar.

Works extremely well. As many have noted, too thick for dressing--so thin with milk as you like. This takes fresh herbs and even fresh onions and garlic well. If you add fresh garlic, remember to blanch it in boiling water for about 10 seconds before you dice it fine. Doing so takes out the stinging brightness of raw garlic. As long as you really give the onions a fine dice, they add well. As much as we like it, it’s best to call this a Ranch Valley type dressing. Frankly, until you add some anchovy paste to the mix, you can’t get that deep flavor that true Ranch Dressing offers. But this one is great for its kid friendliness and familiarity in color and texture. No vinegar tartness at all, either.

I have been making this for about a year now and I no longer like the HVR bottled salad dressing that I LOVED for probably 25 years.  This recipe is delicious, I make it exactly as written.  It is so quick and easy and I always have all the ingredients on hand.  Perfection!  Thank you Dawnia!  10 stars plus!

This is fantastic!  In New Zealand, I don't have access to Ranch dressing mix, or American style buttermilk, but this tastes just like the real thing, if not better!

Fantastic recipe.  My daughter is sensitive to MSGs (seizures)and since most processed foods contain MSGs, I prepare nearly everything myself.  This ranch dressing is truly tasty.  It does come out a little thick, more like a dip, but very easily resolved by adding milk to your desired consistency.  Love it!

I'm giving this recipe four stars because I played with it a little to get the perfect taste for me, but after I 'tweaked' it a bit, it is definitely worth five stars.  I substituted 1/4 C. of mayo for 1/4 C. of buttermilk.  That thinned it out a little....still thick enough to be a veggie dip but thin enough that it could be tossed with a salad.  I also didn't have any dill on hand, so I left it out but didn't miss it!  I doubled my garlic and onion powders.  Next time I will cut back just a tad on the onion, I like the flavor but it may be a little overpowering for others.  I also doubled my salt (I used sea salt) and used white pepper instead of black.  Next time I might even add more garlic and just a pinch more salt.  This is a fantastic base recipe that can easily be altered to suit an individual taste simply by adjusting the amount of herbs you use rather than having to add in new ingredients all together.  Definitely a healthier and tastier alternative to bottled dips and dressings.  Just want to add another note...definitely allow this dressing to 'rest' overnight.  Doing so allows all the flavors to fully incorporate into the sour cream/mayo base.  Otherwise if you only allow an hour or two you are going to still taste each individual spice/herb as well as the sour cream!

Yum, yum, yum!  I used buttermilk (milk with vinegar) instead of sour cream and it was really good.  So much better than store bought preservative-filled dressings!  Quick and easy too, thanks!

Loved it... 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup buttermilk as others have suggested.  Also, I added ground peppercorns to make it a "peppercorn ranch" dressing that my family favors.  Rest I kept the same.  DO NOT be tempted to taste the dressing before putting it in the refrigerator to chill (because it won't taste very good until after it has had a few hours in the refrigerator).  Thank you!  This is a keeper!

Fabulous!  I used the lowest fat mayonnaise available (with just 25 cal/Tbsp) and fat-free sour cream (just 25 cal/2 Tbsps).  I also used fresh dill, dried minced onion, and fresh minced garlic, all for stronger flavor.  I will never buy the bottled stuff again!

I just mixed up this recipe using  1/2 cu mayo type salad dressing, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/4 cup reconstituted buttermilk. I added a little skim milk to get the right consistency. All other herbs I left alone. It tasted a tiny bit bland so I added a tbs lemon juice. Perfect. That's what is in it. 


I just checked on the ingredients for HVR seasoning mix. Here is what is in that.  "Maltodextrin, Salt, Monosodium Glutamate, Buttermilk Solids, Whey Solids, Garlic, Onion, Lactic Acid, Modified Food Starch, Spices, Citric Acid, Calcium Lactate, Casein, Hydroxypropyl MethylCellulose, Whole Milk Solids, Artificial Flavor, Guar Gum, Calcium Sterate. No Preservatives."


My mind is made up. I like the homemade list of pronounceable ingredients. :)

So good I'm not sure I'll ever buy Ranch dressing again!  The only thing I did differently was used fresh chives and parsley because I didn't have any dried.  Oh, I also used buttermilk instead of the sour cream like some others had suggested.  Fabulous!

I didn't like this dip when I first mixed it up, but after it set overnight and took on the flavours of the herbs, it was awesome! I had it with celery sticks and also dipped baked potato fries in it. Yum! Thanks!

Oh! I am so happy to have this delicious recipe! I buy Hidden Valley in the envelopes and it is so expensive! I think this is better tasting - I love the dill!! The only change I made was I added 1/2 cup Half & Half and doubled the spices - FANTASTIC Dawnia!! Thank you!

Really terrific, but like almost everyone else, I cut back on the dill and used reduced-fat buttermilk instead of sour cream. Also, add 1/4 skim milk.

I have bought my last bottle of Ranch dressing! Excellent! It was very thick, so I thinned it with milk. I skipped the dill, I didn't have any, and I used fresh chives. It is excellent on baked potatoes.

Love this dressing. I have to make it every time the guys come over.  For a dip, I reverse the amounts of mayonnaise and sour cream i.e. one cup of sour cream and a half cup of mayonnaise. Also, I use 1/2 teaspoons of salt and pepper. 

This makes a great dressing for pasta salad. 

Nobody would ever want to go buy the bottled goo ever again after trying this ranch dressing.


*** Made it for the guys last week and substituted a clove of pressed garlic for the garlic powder.  It was described as "magically delicious."

I made this dressing for the first time this morning before I went to work.
I do not like mayonnaise whatsoever so I was sceptical about liking it, I put buttermilk in mine and slightly increased the garlic whisked it good and put it in the fridge, when I got home at lunch i put some on my salad, I can't say enough how awesome it was and I could not taste the mayo in it one bit. I totally love this dressing and its the only one I will make.
I would reccomend letting it sit a few hours for the full flavor to take over. Everyone who loves ranch dressing should try this one, you  won't be disappointed!!

This is a very good ranch dressing. I used a 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream, and buttermilk, and all fresh herbs in place of powder and dried. I added fresh garlic, black pepper and hawaiian sea salt to season the dressing. I let it marinate for half an hour before tasting. It is a thicker salad dressing even with the 1% buttermilk but you can doctor it up some more to the consistency you want.  This is perfect for dips, compliments toss salads nicely and is also great as marinades. This is fresh tasting, creamy and I love the flavors of the herbs in the dressing. My reccomendation is to use fresh herbs whenever possible because it really does makes a world of difference in taste! Best part of this recipe is you can adjust the seasonings to suit your tastes. Today I used this as a marinade for, "Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs," also from this website. I also plan on using this recipe again for salads in the near future.

Just okay. Had to tweak quite a bit more than I really wanted to get some flavor. I did use 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sour cream, and 1/2 buttermilk but the dressing tasted very "sour creamy"

This was fantastic!  I did use fresh parsley, dill, chives and upped the onion powder and salt after tasting.  I actually thought it was better after 2-3 days and in the future will make several days ahead of when I plan to serve.  VERY good dip... would cut with buttermilk for more of a "dressing" than a "dip" though as it is rather thick as written, but PERFECT veggie-tray dip consistency and flavor.

I always buy ranch, and last time i looked at the ingredients and thought, hey...i could make that.  I used buttermilk instead of sour cream because i wanted a more liquid salad dressing.  I used dried herbs, but would love to try it with fresh next time.  This does get better with time, so make ahead.

This recipe great, I like the sour cream but think traditional Ranch should be more "tangy", achieved with buttermilk. (Also way less calories!) The ABSOLUTE KEY to fabulous Ranch dressing is Buttermilk POWDER. (I learned about this from Mark Bittman in the NY Times). This can be purchased in the baking section of many supermarkets. 1 cup mayonnaise plus 1/2 cup buttermilk and 1/4 cup buttermilk powder plus salt & pepper. Put that in a jar with a tight fitting lid and and shake for 30 seconds. So simple! You can add 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives or parsley if you like. Also if you start with HOMEMADE mayonnaise which is easy to make with a mini food processor, takes only a few minutes and makes a BIG difference.

VERY Good. My standard is "O'Charley's"  Ranch dressing, and this comes pretty close. ( I did substitute the sour cream with buttermilk). Certainly less expensive! Will now make my own ranch dressing!!

I make a healthier version with 1 cup non-fat yogurt and 2 tbs mayo, and I replace the onion powder with fresh grated onion (which prevents it from tasting yogurty).  Any time I make this dressing, I end up stuffing myself with so much of it on top of raw veggies that I end up losing a pound or two from not being able to consume much else -- it's that good.

This is a keeper!  The seasonings are just the right proportions, no overpowering garlic flavor. I used the suggestion to mix 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream and buttermilk.

Wonderful recipe!!!  I didn't have the chives or the dill so I just left them out.  Also, I like a lot of spice so I doubled all of the other spices.  Don't need to buy the little packets again!

This is great. I used 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream. The only other change I made was to add a little more garlic powder. Good stuff, and I'll be making this every time I need ranch dressing.

We love this dressing! I keep all the herbs & spices mixed together in a jar, when it comes time to make it I just add the spices to the mayo, buttermilk, & sour cream. Usually 2 1/2 -3 tsp depending on how strong of a flavor we want. Either way...its great!

Excellent recipe! I subbed buttermilk for the sour cream and did have to add a bit extra to get a consistency I liked. I didn't have chives so instead used green onions and as per another reviewer's suggestion, I added about 1/4 tsp of olive oil to make it a little smoother. We've also taken to adding a couple tsps of fresh Parmesan.

My husband said this tasted like restaurant dressing. I used fresh chives and dill, and threw in some fresh rosemary too. Subbed FF mayo for half the mayonnaise and light sour cream. I added milk till it was the right consistency for us. I think this will become a versatile recipe for us--I have no desire to buy commercial dressing again!

I rated this yesterday as 2 star...but today after the flavors had a chance to blend, it is so good! 30min is not enough. make the night before or early in the day if you have a chance. I used lowfat mayo and skim milk. My son said it was better than storebought.

I found this to be a great recipe, however, it is more the consistency of a dip.  I just added a touch of milk to thin it out to the consistency I wanted for dressing.  I do think at least some milk should be added, even if you want to have it as a dip, as the milk made a BIG difference in the taste...it was the finishing touch!  Loved it!  Thanks for sharing!

I used this recipe as a place to start.  I used yogurt instead of sour cream and put in dill and Italian spices.  My friend has raved about it ever since.  This will become a staple in our household.

This dressing is that unobtainable "restaurant dressing" that until now, I've not been able to purchase in grocery stores.  It's just so creamy.  The key for me with this recipe was *no buttermilk* - that's the common taste of store-bought dressings.  This recipe has changed my life and the frequency with which I eat salads at home.

Great recipe! I add a little milk and concentrated lemon juice to get a buttermilk ranch dressing flavor and to thin out a little. It pours much better with a little more liquid added.

This was okay.  Actually - this makes a great party dip, but this is NOT Ranch dressing in the truest sense.  I would not put it on a salad.  Sorry - I will not be having this recipe again.

Living in England I found my self "stocking up" on Hidden Valley packages when coming home on Holiday.  Never again.  This recipe is Fab.  A bit thick for my liking but a little milk did the trick.  My family loved it and it was soon gone.
Goes great with cold Salmon and cucumber

a really good ranch recipe.  I did use buttermilk instead of sour cream, and I found it to be a tad blander than I had hoped, so I added more of all of the spices, especially the garlic powder.  I used light mayo, which gave it a sweeter flavor, but it still turned out rather well.  I used this on the Anniversary Chicken recipe on this site.  Out of this world!  Thanks for the recipe!

I have a hard time with reviews that include people who change the recipe then complain about the outcome.  They're really just complaining about their own recipe.  

This was simple and awesome. Follow the recipe and it works great.  If you change it up and it sucks, then don't complain.

Amazing. I downscaled the mayo a bit, it results in this amazing dip! Right now I'm happily dipping carrots in it, it's hard to stop eating this!!! Will maybe add some buttermilk soon to have it as a dressing.

I made for this for a party and everyone loved it. I did make a couple of adjustments because i did not have all the ingredients on hand but it still came out delicious. Instead of chives, i used a table spoon of chopped white onion, and one garlic clove. I threw in the black pepper, salt, dried parsley and left out the dill weed because i did not have it. It was AMAZING! My wife asks me to make this instead of buying the stuff from the supermarket because it has so much more flavor and freshness!

Because I have a son who will only eat Hidden Valley dressing, I have been trying many recipes for homemade. I made this yesterday, with the changes posted by one reviewer, using 1/2c buttermilk, 1/2 mayo and 1/2c sour cream and increasing garlic to 1/2 tsp and my son said "pretty good" which means great! Probably even better today, I'll let you all know. Guess what!! better when it sets!Imagine!  And for a southwest kick, add 1/2C spicy salsa for a nice change.

I made buffalo pulled chicken sandwiches for dinner one night and was looking for a ranch dressing that came as close as possible to the Hidden Valley Ranch packets that you mix up at home to serve with them.  This one is almost spot-on!  The whole family agreed that there is a little too much onion with the chives and the onion powder both, so I'll cut back on that next time.  Also, it was a little too salty, which really surprised me with only 1/8 tsp of salt in the recipe.  I really think the added salt could be left out and whatever salt is in the mayonnaise will be enough.  I wanted a little bit thinner dressing, so I substituted buttermilk instead of the sour cream and was very pleased with the results.  I highly recommend using buttermilk instead of sour cream if you're using this as a salad dressing.  It makes flavor fantastic and consistency perfect.

Oh my, this is a really wonderful recipe.  To cut the fat I used light Best Foods mayo & light sour cream.  I also added a squirt of extra virgin olive oil and red wine vinegar - everyone loved it and were amazed that it was lowfat.

I love this recipe and it is definitely much better than bottled, which is full of junk. I add 1/4-1/2 cup (depends on how runny you like it) of buttermilk substitute (1Tbsp. vinegar or lemon juice per 1 C. milk and let stand 5 minutes before incorporating into recipe) and let it refrigerate overnight. So yummy on salad and for dipping veggies.

This is a quick and simple recipe with ingredients you normally have in the kitchen.  I use it just the way posted for dips and then out some with milk, buttermilk for a pourable dressing.  Try it!

I have made this several times, and love it! I adjust the amount of mayonnaise to 1/4 cup, and add 3/4 Greek yogurt. I also use low-fat sour cream, which lowers the amount of fat in the dressing significantly, but is still delicious! I have also used fresh herbs in replace of the dried, which is also amazing!

This ranch dressing is AMAZING! I made minimal changes...I eliminated the sour cream and went with 1 cup mayo and 1/2 cup buttermilk, as per previous reviews. I added 1/4 tsp extra of chives and garlic powder, and used freshly ground black pepper. Tasted after whisking all ingredients together and I was dubious, it didn't taste like ranch dressing at all. HOWEVER, after chilling for 2 hours, I tasted it again and the flavors were very well blended and it was absolutely delicious! I will never be without this dressing in my refrigerator...THANK YOU for this wonderful recipe!

This was the best dressing ever.  The only thing I did different was add 1/2 tsp garlic powder.  It was a mistake but it was really great.  I won't ever by ranch dressing again!

Thanks DAWNIA for this recipe! I never knew it was so easy to make ranch, and all with stuff I always keep in my kitchen! I made wedge salads for lunch, and it was a hit. Better than any I have ever bought, I will say. I made this recipe to the exact way written the first time and added a little more chives and dill to my taste the second. I know TAST IS SUBJECTIVE, SO I SAY TRY THIS ONE, it worked great for a group of picky eaters.

I, like many, have been raised on Ranch salad dressing. My mother used to buy the bottles of Ranch when I was in school, and at some point she started making the stuff out of the packets sold at the grocery stores. I, too, have been buying the packets, and making my own salad dressing for years. I thought it was getting old, and not to mention expensive (those packets or jars add up). So, I thought I would look around for a Ranch mix, and I came across this recipe.  This is a good version of Hidden Valley Ranch. It is a little bit on the milder side, so I do recommend using 1/2 cup mayo,  1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup of buttermilk (or you can substitute as an alternative 1/2 Tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon in bottom of 1/2 cup and fill milk to the top of container, and wait 5 minutes like I did). Also, I tweaked it a little by adding another 1/8 tsp of herbs, salt and pepper.  I strongly suggest this recipe, because you can do so much with it. Also, it gets better over time!

I made this as-is, but with twice the garlic powder and it was just OK (a little bland for my tastes honestly). After reading the reviews, I added 1/2 c. skim milk and a few dashes of worcestershire and it was perfect.  I used all reduced cal ingredients and it was a bit lumpy at first, but I got those out with an egg beater. The resulting dressing works for salads or as a dip.  Yum...

This makes the best ranch dressing I have ever made.  I always use plain yogurt in the place of the mayonnaise and sour cream.  Excellent flavor.  I don't like store bought ranch, but I love this one.

This was really good!! And so fast and easy!  I used light mayo and fat free sour cream and we still loved it. The flavor was definitely better after sitting overnight. I'm going to mix up a batch of the dried spices and store in a bag so I can make it in a hurry.  Thank you Dawnia!

Excellent. Use 1/2-3/4 cup buttermilk w/o the sour cream for a dressing.  Only gave it a 4 since you need to double the spices to give it some taste.  Let it sit for a few hours before serving. Add 1/4 tsp of cayanne red pepper for a little kick.

I make a large batch of this and it keeps well in the fridge for a month.  This is very good.  Store bought salad dressings usually have additives so finding an easy, delicious and healthy recipe is very important to me.

This is amazing.  Ranch dressing is not sold in the U.K. and it is so close to the packet that I don't have to rely on friends to send it to me!  I used 1/2 cup milk with 1/4 tsp white wine vinegar. and 1/2 tsp garlic powder and also used celery salt instead of regular salt.  Brilliant!

I really quite enjoyed this recipe.  As others suggested, I used a 1/2 cup each of (light) mayo, yogurt (instead of sour cream), and buttermilk.  Also didn't have onion powder, so I ommmited.  However I did add MAYBE a 1/4 t celery salt (eyeballed it).  I think the flavor from the dill, parsley, and garlic powder are what really make it, in additon to the wet ingrediants already mentioned.  Play with the additional spices to your liking.  It was really very, very  delicious.  I could understand other's complaint about the consistency being too thick for a dressing.  That's a personal prefernce of course.  It will easily be thinned with more buttermilk.  A keeper!

i LOVE this dressing!!!!!!  i don't like commercial dressing because it always has a sweet taste, so i started looking for a home-made dressing and i found this amazing recipe.  i doubled the spices, added juice of half a lemon, and some buttermilk to thin it out.  i'm going to be making this recipe ALL the TIME.

Great recipe, better than restaurant ranch. I like a thinner ranch, so I used 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c mayo, & 1/2 cup milk. Delicious! I used it right after I made it, and it was still great. Thank you for this recipe, I will never buy ranch again.

Just what I was looking for!  All 3 of my kids gave it "thumbs up".  So good.  I did change a few things according to other reviewers.  Doubled the recipe and used 1 cup light Mayo, 1 cup buttermilk and 1 cup sour cream.  Added more garlic powder than 1/2 tsp, probably a full teaspoon. Used minced onion instead of chives and left out the dill weed.  Used my hand blender to mix.  If I would have known it was this easy I would have been making it long before now!

I know this recipe doesn't necessarily need another great review, but I had to give my "cheers" too! This was thick, but I loved the flavor-I'll never spend another dollar on the Ranch seasoning packets! The only change I made was to add minced onions in place of the dried chives (didn't have any).

This recipe was very, very good!  I will never by store dressing again.  I made it with sour cream and it was a little thicker than I wanted so I added a little powdered buttermilk and water to thin it out.

I've been making this for 9 years and it's by far my favorite ranch dressing. After trying this, I've never been able to eat the store bought stuff without cringing. Everyone loves it. It's incredible and what ranch dressing is supposed to be.

This dressing is delicious and it was the only thing that kept my husband eating the salads on the low carb diet!

I made it with buttermilk and still didn't get the authentic Ranch taste I was looking for.  Good, fresh taste - just, missing something...

This is outstanding. Never again will I buy Hidden Valley Ranch. It tastes just like it, only better, fresher, and of course, cheaper! I didn't have any dried chives or onion powder. I didn't think the amount of dill was overpowering at all, as some other reviewers have suggested. I only used about 3/4 cup mayo, and added about 1/2 cup buttermilk which thinned it down to a consistency suitable for a salad dressing and gave it delicious flavor. Wonderful recipe, Dawnia!

This dressing is delicious! I'm lactose intolerant, so I used 1/2 tsp. lemon juice and enough soy milk to make 1/2 cup instead of the sour cream or buttermilk, and it turned out great! Thanks!

This is a good recipe.  Next time I will use half of the dill and increase the garlic and onion.  I also thinned it with a little milk.

Quick, easy and delicious.  Clean fresh taste. Great base recipe to make variations of  different salad dressings and/or taste. Most important, my kids are crazy about it and ask for salads so they can have the ranch salad dressing.

Have made this for years, try adding 8oz of cream cheese, use fresh garlic, Lauray's season salt! Dill weed. Great for chips, veggies, salad, or just out of the bowl...

I was making hotwings and celery and needed a dipping sauce/dressing. How clever this recipe ... no need for buttermilk! I didn't have dehydrated chives, nor sour cream. I substituted with a tiny bit of chopped red onion and full fat Greek yogurt.  Tangy and full flavored. Great recipe!

I go one step farther and make my own mayo.  I use the "stick blender" recipe from here I believe.  I double the all the spices, except the dill.  The only problem with this recipe?  I can no longer eat ranch dressing ANYWHERE ELSE! lol.  This will absolutely ruin you to any other kind...they don't even come close to how good this one is.

I made a really small recipe of this since it's only me and my husband. I usually hate ranch dressing, but this was so good. I used vegenaise instead of mayonaise and used chopped green onions in place of the chives. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the ranch dressing recipe I've been looking for - herby not sweet and can be thinned with milk or kept thick for dipping. I was out of chives so I upped the onion powder to 1/2 tsp, upped the garlic to 1/2 tsp as well because we're garlic lovers and omitted the pepper due to dietary concerns. Still a very nice flavor profile. I halved the mayo and just thinned slightly with 2 Tbsp whole milk. Perfect!

Great basic ranch dressing.  After my first batch, which was darn good, I followed the advice of other reviewers & made a few tweaks based on my own tastes, including using light canola oil mayo and fat-free plain Greek yogurt in place of sour cream:

1)  Cut the mayo down to 1/2 c.
2)  Added 1 c. buttermilk (actually 1 c. skim milk w/1 Tbs. white vinegar)
3)  Increased garlic powder to 1/2 tsp.
4)  Cut dill to 1/8 tsp.

I always try to make it the night before, or at the very latest early in the morning, because it's even better as it sits and all the flavors meld.  DELICIOUS, fresher, and healthier without all the fat, fillers, and starches of store bought dressing.

Used 1/2 cup each of buttermilk, sour cream and mayo.  Skipped the dill (really dislike) and added more garlic powder.  Chilled for 4 hours, and thinned with milk before adding to a tossed green salad.  Delish!

A truely great base recipe... It makes a great ranch veggie dip... you can adjust it to fit your likings... for me that is less mayonnaise and more sour cream... if you want to make it into a dressing just thin it down with milk... for a ranch dip it is a great place to start

This dressing came out alright. I made it exactly according to the directions. I can't exactly place what the off taste is, but it's either the sour cream or maybe the garlic powder...I'm going to keep looking for an excellent recipe...thanks for sharing!

wonderful recipe, I will never be out of ranch again and no more Hidden Valley for me.  Some times you forget the simplest way to make things.  I am making alot of my own sauces, mayo and now ranch.  Thanks.  I did make an adjustment as per another reviewer.  I used 1/2 sour cream, 1/2 mayo, and 1/2 buttermilk(whick I made myself with 1/2 reg milk, I use raw, and a splash of white vinegar).

Good Dressing or Dip! Used it as a "dip" for Bacon Cheese Fries and it worked out great. Flavor is much better than bottled. I would use the buttermilk or replace a portion of the sour cream with the buttermilk to use it on a salad due to the thickness. We enjoyed this. Thanks for sharing!

Because I wanted to make this as a salad dressing and because I like buttermilk ranch, I followed the tip of using buttermilk instead of sour cream. It's really good, but I wouldn't say it's my favorite... a little too strong on the dill flavor for my personal tastes. I'm sure we could play around with the seasonings a little though to get it just right! If you use Best Foods light mayo instead of regular mayo (and use buttermilk instead of sour cream like I did), it's only 65 calories for 2 tablespoons of dressing... doesn't even taste "light" either

We really liked this recipe.  I added a bit more salt than what is called for - not sure how much, just kept sprinkling in till we liked the taste.  I did increase the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp. too.  Also, I did the 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup buttermilk - as suggested by a previous reviewer. The longer it sat, the better it got.  Thanks for sharing!  I love being able to make things from scratch!

I love, love, love this recipe for Ranch dressing! I cannot stand to eat the stores' shelf varieties anymore after having this. Thank you for sharing a great recipe! (I do use half mayo and half sour cream per my own liking)

I tried this because I ran out of dressing and was to lazy to go to the store....Am I ever glad this was soooo soooo good... the only thing is I think I put to much salt in. I will never buy it again!

If my son in-law could bath in ranch dressing he would that's how much he loves ranch.  Made this one night and he said this was the best he has ever had.

I have never bought ranch dressing since using this recipe! It is awesome! I use the canola or olive oil mayo and the light sour cream. Perfect every time! Don't spend money on all those chemicals in the store bought Ranch. Make this instead.

Why would anyone buy ranch when it tastes so much better making it like this.  I am glad it doesn't have buttermilk b/c I usually don't have any around, all other ingredients I do.  I like to dip everything in this ranch, like truly everything.

This was great! I cannot believe how inexpensive homemade ranch is. I had fresh parsley on hand, but no dried, so i chucked that in instead and my dressing was BRIGHT GREEN. Oops. Delicious, though, and my husband really liked it.

While this is excellent unless you make your own mayonnaise you still get chemicals and preservatives.  I have yet to find a commercially made mayo that does not contain msg (sometimes called natural flavoring).

GREAT recipe.  I did take the advice of other reviewers and used the 1/2 Mayo, 1/2 Buttermilk, and 1/2 SC (all low fat versions).  I put in extra of the onion powder, garlic powder and dill simply because I have a strange HEAVY SPICE addiction :-),  omitted the salt and added Worchestershire and a dash of lemon juice.  I can't wait for my fresh herbs to mature, I am sure this will be even better!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made just enough for two, so... two spoonfuls mayo, one spoonful tofutti cream cheese (herb flavor), 1/4 tsp parsley, 1/4 tsp dill, 1/8 tsp garlic and onion powders, pinch of salt and pepper and added splashes of water until I got the right consistency. No chives on hand - but I can imagine that would only make it better!

Pretty good...I took others advice and used a mixture of sour cream, buttermilk and mayo...along with a tsp of veg. oil for consistency.  Iused the same measurments of spices but I think for next time I would use a little less dill, it was a bit over powering.

OH.MY.GOODNESS.  This is so good.  I signed up just so I could review this recipe.  LOVE IT, obviously.  I added a little more onion and garlic salt, as well as a little thyme and a splash of milk just to thin a little, but I am so pleased...

I thought this was one of the best ranch dressing recipes I have ever had.  Definitely use buttermilk over sour cream to create a thin dressing that has tons of flavor!!!

This dressing is restraunt quality. I omitted the dill and added enough buttermilk to make it a little runny for salad. Great on hot wings! My husband loved it.

This was brilliant, the only thing I changed was fresh parsley and chives.  This was so good I am 100% sure I will not buy bottled ranch ever again.  I used this on the Cobb Salad from this site and the two go together brilliantly.

I have been looking for a Ranch Dressing for years.  This recipe is as close as I have gotten to perfect.  I made a few changes though, for our own personal taste.  I doubled the spices, except for the dill, which I cut back to about half.  I also used half a cup each of mayo, sour cream, and buttermilk.  It's best after it sits for a few hours in the fridge.  My entire family loves it and even our picky teenager who doesn't want to try anything new.  I stopped buying the bottled stuff since this is so much healthier without all of the chemicals.  So he had no choice but to try it.  Now he loves it and doesn't ask for the bottled stuff anymore.  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!!!

Very very good. The flavor was excellent though the texture was too thick for salad unless you add a little milk or buttermilk to desired consistency. I'd been looking for a homemade Ranch dressing to replace the processed powdered mix I had always used before. The taste of this recipe was far superior and was a  hit with everyone at the table. We'll make this again and again.

WOW..I was really surprised at how good *fresh* ranch dressing could taste.  My kids eat ranch dressing by the gallons from french fries, sandwiches and chicken!  I know now I can make it for half of what it costs store bought.  I halved the recipe and didn't add the dillweed (didn't have) and added a small amount of fat-free buttermilk.  Very GOOD!  This will be a staple in the fridge from now on.

This is really good, and super easy to make, to boot.  It does taste like Ranch.  I wanted to try doing it with buttermilk but bought a small carton of 2% milk instead of buttermilk-oops!  So I just made it as written and have been using it mostly as a dip, since it's so thick.  When I go to the store again I'll get buttermilk and try it that way.  I used light mayo and sour cream to lower the fat. **** I made this again- this time using buttermilk instead of sour cream.  I had to add extra buttermilk to get it to the consistency I wanted.  I enjoyed it more this time around!

I just mixed up this dressing, and it's fine, there's no problem with it. But the description states "...no sharp notes in this buttermilk and mayonnaise dressing", except there's no BUTTERMILK in it! It's fairly thick with just mayo and sour cream, so I might thin it with some buttermilk, but I'm wondering if perhaps the buttermilk was accidentally left out of this recipe?

I stopped buying store bought ranch a while ago due to the added MSG. My kids and I have missed it. So I found this recipe, made it, and it is delicious. I added some extra chives, onion and garlic powder for our tastes, and it is so yummy! This will be a staple in our fridge from now on.

I have made this dressing many times the only change I make is I add a little more of the dried herbs to suit our taste.  It has gotten rave reviews from everyone who has tried it including my 10 year old granddaughter who uses it on almost everything. I always have a container made up in the fridge.

This was good - but not the bottled Ranch. I did substitute milk for the sour cream, so it wouldn't be too thick. It made for a nice change, and a very light tasting dressing, but don't make this if you are wanting "Ranch" dressing.

I have been making this for a while as the recipe is written except for using buttermilk in place of sour cream or using 1/2 cup each of sour cream mayo and buttermilk.
Today I decided to use fresh garlic & onion both pressed in the garlic press and then fresh chives, basil (instead of parsley and increase salt. So basically, I have done what I hate when other people do and completely changed the recipe. But it is still is good. As it is written the recipe is good but it is also a great basic idea to play with.

I ran across this recipe when looking for a dressing to add to sliced cucumbers this summer. I did make it with buttermilk instead of sourcream and diced dried onions instead of onion powder. It was wonderful, and since have replaced my favorite bottled Ranch dressing with this. Thanks for the recipe!

I used lowfat sour cream and mixed lowfat and regular mayo to make one cup.  Without all the salt found in packaged mixes, the flavor of the dressing really comes through.  This is delicious both as a dressing and a dip.  Edit:  I now make this with all fresh herbs as a dip and it is over the top delicious.

This is wonderful!!! Even better than bottled Ranch dressing.  Added minced shallot and bacon bits to dressing and it was outstanding.  This is now my dressing of choice to make!!!!  Might also be good with fresh minced garlic!

An excellent ranch dressing. I personally found the dill flavor to be overpowering (and I really like dill). It was so strong in proportion to the other seasonings that I could taste little else. I would definitely make this dressing again; however, I would cut the dill proportion in about one-quarter so as not to mask the other flavors.

I made this recipe vegetarian by substituting the sour cream with tofu, blended it in the food processor and served it with assorted veggies during the holidays. Everyone loved it, even the kids! I didn't get to it soon enough to try it and had to scrape the bottom of the bowl just to get a taste.

The taste/flavor of this dressing is fabulous, I love Dill! This recipe written with sour cream is definitely the consistency of a dip, I replaced the sour cream with buttermilk which is still a thick dressing, but the flavors seem to hold together better on lettuce when it's not so thick.

I thought this was pretty good, and would probably be a five if I had all ingredients on-hand. I used sour cream but added a TB milk or so, plus about a tsp of lemon juice. I would caution that even if you love garlic like I do, using too much in this recipe might not be the best idea. I added more garlic powder to make up for the fact I didn't have onion powder on-hand and it was too garlic-tasting for me.

This was pretty good. I didnt have dill but will try that next time. It tasted a little too mayonassie for me but Im sure if I mess with it a little I will get it to match more my taste but very cool recipe! It was fun to say I made my own dressing - I will use this from now on!

Very good!  I followed the advise and used buttermilk and mayo, and just did about 1/8 of a teaspoon of dill.  Very tasty!  It's so easy to make that we'll never buy store bought again.

This ranch dressing is awesome. I used lite mayo, fat-free sour cream, and low fat buttermilk to thin it out a little bit. It was great! I also added some cayenne pepper for a little spice.

This is the best Ranch EVER! We are against preservatives and this one is so good. I switch around the sour cream and mayo, we like more sour cream taste. I also add a little milk for salads. My friends and family are addicted too.

I liked this recipe, although it was thick, and even with alot of buttermilk, it still remained like a dip, I will add less sour cream and more buttermilk next time.  I used all low-fat or fat-free ingredients, and the flavor was still great.  I will be adding less dill next time, a bit too dilly for my taste. ;-)

Was very good. Taste more like a dip than a dressing. I will make it again, but it will not replace my bottled Ranch.

Wow.....I was very skeptical about this..it was so good......the only change I made was to thin it w/about 2 tbs of milk.  Never thought I could make ranch dressing that would rival Hidden Valley.  (and I had all the ingredients in my cabinet!)  this was great!!!

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  My family is a bunch of "ranchaholics," I have spent a fortune on the little envelopes of the premixed stuff, until now!!!  You have saved me so much money already, wow!  This is a great recipe, the ranch dressing is fabulous.  I use 1 cup of buttermilk and 1 cup of mayo to make a dressing for salads.  This has a wonderful flavor and is quick and easy to do.  Try it, you won't be disappointed!  Thanks so much Dawnia.

Love, Love, Love! As written this is the best ranch dressing I have tried! I usually make a double batch for parties and serve with veggies and chips, and it's never enough. I used fresh parsley and fresh green onions (instead of chives) from the garden and sometimes make it lighter by adding Greek yogurt. Had to write a review as this is my favorite dipping ranch and salad dressing (thin down with a little milk or water for salads) and I make it quite often. Best part about making it from home is that there is no MSG!

I have this one memorized. I always keep these ingredients on hand. People are amazed when you tell them you make your own ranch, and that it's so easy! Waaaaay better than anything on the shelf. It's pretty thick, so if I'm using it as a dip, I leave it as is. I ad a little milk if I want it a little easier to pour. Add bleu cheese, and you have bleu cheese dressing. Add chipotle gravy, (from the chipotle chili cans) and poof, chipotle ranch! I just made another batch for the taco salads later, and I had to review this recipe. Thanks for making me look like I know what I'm doing in the kitchen! Lol, all my friends and co workers are amazed:)

I have tried this recipe and loved it. I've also done a little tweeking to it and still loved the taste of it. I've switched the regular sour cream with the Mexican style darigold sour cream and with the spice and seasoning that sour cream has in it, makes the ranch so much flavorful

OMG I just mixed this up adding the buttermilk and using greek yogurt for the sour cream and fresh herbs. Licked the spoon and thought it was amazing! Can't wait to try it in a few hours after flavors have melded. Thanks for this recipe! I hated to buy bottle or dry ranch because of all the additives. Going to use this dressing in the Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs recipe from this site.

Pretty close match to the most popular brand of dressing mix.  After making it a few times, I decided to tweak it a bit.  I prefer more sour cream flavor & wanted to lighten it up.  So I make mine with either light sour cream/plain greek yogurt & lowfat buttermilk (if I want a dressing) with just a spoonful of mayo.  Yum, yum!  Tastes best if it has a few hours or overnight to sit in the fridge before using...

I am really impressed with myself that I turned out something that was so incredibly good! And equally impressed with DAWNIA for submitting it. Thank you. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it was delicious. Next time, I am going to try greek yogurt in place of the sour cream but I seriously doubt if the taste of this recipe could be improved. Someone surely did their homework with this one.

I will never buy bottled dressing again. This simple recipe tastes better than any ranch dressing I have purchased....even those expensive refrigerated versions in the produce section. I had all the ingredients in my cupboard. I used frozen parsley and chives that were in my freezer from last summer that I had harvested from my garden instead of the dried stuff. i also omitted the dill because i did not have it. otherwise, I followed the directions exactly and the dressing came out perfect. I had made wings and chopped the celery and realized I had no ranch. I immediately went to allrecipes and knew I would find a perfect replacement for the bottled stuff and I did. Awesome site. Thanks so much!!!!!!!

This is a pretty good recipe as is but the mayonnaise is a bit overpowering. The second time I made it I tried some suggestions to use 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup buttermilk which I thought gave it a better consistency for using on a salad and more of a tang and less mayonnaise taste. I also increased the garlic power and onion powder to 1/2 teaspoon each which gave it just a tiny bit more kick.

This is a really good dressing and dip. I find that it needs more of the herbs, particularly the garlic and onion powder, for my taste, but it's excellent. Love it on salads or as a dip for veggies. It's also delicious when you toss cooked veggies (green beans, for instance) with a little of the dressing. I make this regularly, so thank you for the recipe!

I make this all the time and it's wonderful!  I always have people asking me for the recipe.  I was looking for a homemade version because my daughter is allergic to milk so we can't use store bought.  Well, we will never use store bought again(even if my daughter outgrows her allergy)!  Made as is, is great, but I normally substitute seasoned salt for salt and also add cayenne pepper to taste.  I also like using fresh ground peppercorns for the pepper.

I only changed a couple things ...I increased garlic powder to 1/2 tsp and I "thinned" the dressing down just a little using buttermilk. It was awesome!! I wont be buying Ranch dressing again!! :)

This is delicious! It tastes better the longer it sits. We didn't care too much for it the day we made it, but loved it the next day.  I used 1/2c fat free sour cream, 1/2c low fat buttermilk and 1/2c fat free greek yogurt as a sub for the mayo - very point friendly for those on Weight Watchers!

This is delicious! I do add more garlic and onion powder than the recipe calls for. I get compliments on this every time I make it. People are always asking me for the recipe.

A wonderful recipe for ranch dressing...  I used homemade buttermilk substitute (1 C milk + 1 T white vinegar to make 'buttermilk') in place of the sour cream.  I added 1/2 C of it, but I think I'd add 1/4 C next time because I like my dressing a little thicker.  For the spices, I customized it and added a bit more black pepper and garlic.  It turned out wonderful!

Followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was really just like a vegetable dip. The second time I reduced the dill by half and used buttermilk instead of sour cream...perfection!

I live in Germany and it's impossible to find ranch dressing anywhere. This recipe has solved all my problems! :) ...I usually make a double batch, and substitute low-fat plain yogurt for half of the mayonnaise (because light mayo doesn't exist here either) and it comes out perfect. It's amazing how much this exactly tastes to restaurant quality ranch!!

My first attempt at homemade ranch dressing.  I find I am no longer a fan of the bottled stuff.  It tastes like chemicals to me.  Since the option to add buttermilk was in the notes, I used 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup reduced fat sour cream, and 1/2 cup buttermilk.  I was a little heavy handed on some of the spices too (chives and onion powder).  I think this would be over the top with real chives.  Hubs loved dipping his cucumber wedges in it.  Thanks!

Super fast and easy. I have made twice. Last time only used sour cream as I did not have mayo or buttermilk and whipped it up for veggie dip for the kids! They begged or more. Bravo!

I have finally found the perfect ranch dressing! The ones purchased at grocery stores or eaten at restaurants are never the same - too sour, too much vinegar, too sweet, too creamy, etc. However this recipe is consistent and delicious every time I make it. It does get better a couple hours in the fridge. Thanks for the recipe!

it is rare for me to say something is perfect as is/no changes to suit my taste...but this one is. I did use half buttermild for the mayo (so 1/2 c each of buttermilk, mayo and sour cream) and it is JUST what I wanted!

YUMMY! Made as written, subbing buttermilk for the sour cream to get a more of a dressing for salad. I did add more than 1/2 cup to get it to the consistency that I wanted. Great flavor and very easy to make w/ things I always have on hand. Super close in flavor to the packet mix. Will def make again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This recipe was incredible.  I substituted the sour cream for buttermilk, and it was delicious.  It was still thick enough to dip vegetables in, and I think it would also work as a salad dressing.

Great recipe.  I didn't have any sour cream but I had leftover buttermilk I was looking to use up.  This did the trick.  I cut the recipe in half and followed the spice measurements.  I added a bunch of white vinegar to it because I wanted it to be more tangy than it was, but other than that it was great.  I will make this again.

5 FATS PER TABLESPOON and pretty delicious = I modified to 1/4 C. Mayo, 1 C. Sour Cream, 1/4 C. Buttermilk; then I double the rest of the ingredients. Comes out super tasty so you don't need as much being there's so much flavor packed in 2 tablespoons—less mayo means less fat. For a good dressing you don't really need 1 cup of mayo. You can still get the flavor and consistency with 1/4 cup.

I'm from a part of the country where ranch is the 'house dressing' in most restaurants. This isn't it.  First, it was way too thick and needed some liquid to dilute it a bit (I used milk). Second, it was missing something in flavor. I finally realized it had no acid so I added some vinegar. Totally worked. I'll make this again, next time using buttermilk (since that's one of the key ingredients in ranch dressing). I also don't keep powdered garlic or onion so I added fresh, minced of both. The outcome, after modifications, was delicious. It the original recipe needs work.

This recipe had great flavour and was a crowd pleaser.  I used 1 cup mayo, and a 1/2 cup each of sour cream and buttermilk.  I was using it as a dip, and and even with the buttermilk it was more dip texture than a dressing.  I had to make a second batch because the first was eaten so quickly.

Yum! Served this tonight on our Cobb Salad, also from Allrecipes. It was the perfect compliment! I quit buying salad dressings this past year. They always taste too 'vinegary' and too salty to me. Making them fresh I can also only make the amount we'll use and not have to toss out any partially used bottles because they taste funny to me. Definitely will keep this recipe!

I rarely ever write negative reviews, but this is not what I expected after reading all of the reviews. I followed the recipe exactly and it tasted like seasoned mayo. Not good. Noone in my house liked it. Maybe with the buttermilk it would taste more like ranch and less like mayo?

I really enjoyed this dressing, but it is SO thick if you make it as written. I added buttermilk just to thin it out a bit and I think the flavor benefited as well. I also used fresh garlic since I'm a serious garlic lover. Yum!

I was looking for something to use as a dip, as my current buttermilk dressing recipe is a bit on the thin side for dipping.  This was not good at all.  This was the least successful recipe I have ever tried.  My mayo and sour cream taste perfectly fine apart and are well within freshness dates, but when I mixed them and added the spices, it just tasted weird.  No, not weird, nasty - tangy in a bad way and bitter.  I'll see if I can make my other recipe a bit thicker instead.

Great recipe. I am allergic to MSG (in most Ranches), but love ranch! This recipe has great flavor. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars, is that I have yet to figure out how to keep it a consistency that befits a dressing.  It always congeals again to a dip consistency no matter how much milk I add. Maybe I'll try the buttermilk suggestion, next time.

I mix up a larger batch of the dry ingredients to keep on hand, then make a veggie dip or salad dressing by adding it to buttermilk, yogurt, sour cream and mayo..whatever your tastes prefer.  Can also add some celery salt, seasoning salt or a bit of cayenne for some zip.  I find dried minced onion adds more flavour than powder.  Once it's mixed it helps to sit for a few hours to really bring out the flavour.

Very good ranch recipe.  As recommended by Christy, I substituted the 1 cup mayo with 1/2 cup mayo & 1/2 cup buttermilk.

The search continues for a HVR substitute.  I made this recipe twice.  The first time as directed and it tasted like mayo and not much else.  The second time I modified it based on suggestions of other reviewers and used 1/2c mayo, 1/2c buttermilk and 1/2c sour cream.  This balanced the mayo flavor out but it was extremely bland.  I doubled all spices and it helped alot but it isn't anywhere close to steakhouse ranch or the stuff in the bottle which is what I wanted.

I wasn't expecting something out of a bottle... but that's exactly what this tastes like! I did only 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup buttermilk, and it's perfect (if not better than the store-bought stuff)!

While not the best Ranch dressing I've ever had, this was pretty decent nonetheless. On the contrary, my parents liked this a LOT! Every time I invite my parents over for dinner, I try to serve a fresh salad on the side - and try a new dressing to go with it. My dad has never been a "greens" fan, but due to his health, he's on a heart-restrictive diet. If I can show him that healthy foods can be flavorful, I've made a stride in the right direction. :) This really doesn't taste like Ranch at all, IMHO. It's very sweet compared to most Ranch dressings I've tried (store-bought / restaurants). Perhaps it was the generic brand mayonnaise I bought or the substitution of buttermilk for sour cream??? Next time I'll stick with my gut and make what jumps out at me first. Sarah Jo's no-guilt zesy Ranch dip / dressing sounds far more interesting and now I know why.... Thanks anyways, Dawn. :)

I didn't have any onion powder so I substituted a tbsp. of finely chopped vidalia onion.  I also didn't have any dried chives.  Used low fat mayo and fat free sour cream and also added a tbsp. of half and half.  Put it all in the food processor and it was delicious!!  Will never buy bottled ranch again if I can help it!

Thank you so much for this recipe.  I have been searching (without success) for a good from-scratch recipe for  ranch dressing for almost 10 years.  I don't know how I missed this one before, but I am so glad I found it now.  My preschooler came home asking for "dip" since he had tried it at school and liked it.  I won't bother looking any further now that I have found this great recipe, I can't wait to surprise my husband with salad tonight.  I only had about 1/2 cup mayonnaise, so I poured some buttermilk in the mayo bottle and shook it up to get the last bits out, and then added a little bit extra sour cream.  I didn't end up with quite 1 1/2 cups total, so I used slightly less of the spices than it called for.  I can't wait to try some of the variations other reviewers mentioned, this is so yummy!

Wonderful recipe! I realized at the last minute that I was out of ranch dressing, you saved the evening. I added 1/2 tsp. of garlic as other users had suggested as well as 1/2 cup of milk since I was low on sour cream. It still turned out to be the right consistency. Thank you for the great recipe.

Fantastic recipe. I wanted half the amount, and used 1/2 cup Hellman's mayo, 1/4 cup light sour cream and 1/4 cup lowfat buttermilk. Halved the spices as well. Perfect consistency for dressing and delicious even before refridgerating.  We started making our own dressings awhile ago, but had never tried Ranch. Will definitely make this one again. Thank you!

I made a low fat version by using light mayo and low fat buttermilk (I didn't have buttermilk in the house, so I made it by adding 1 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to 1/2 cup of 1% milk).  I also added some all-natural Mrs. Dash seasoning, which gave extra flavor and flecks of color.  In contrast to bottled low fat ranch dressing, which often tastes like glue, this recipe is simply delicious.

I have always been a Hidden Valley snob.  I don't like any other brand of ranch, and I don't even like HV bottled dressing; it had to be made from the mix packet.  Then I read the ingredients and discovered that HV contains MSG.  And so began the hunt for a suitable replacement.
This is it!  It's easy, and it tastes just as good as HV, IMO.  Made as written, it's more like a dip (the kids love it with carrots and celery sticks).  If I want dressing, I add a little milk to thin it out.  Or, I imagine, if you use buttermilk in place of the sour cream to begin with, it would be more dressing than dip.
Thank you for this awesome recipe!

This is the best homemade ranch dip/dressing I've tasted. I made it as a dip for veggies and crackers and it's perfect! As a dressing, you would probably need to thin it just a bit. The ONLY thing I did differently was use 1 cup sour cream to 1/2 cup mayo. Actually, I ran 1/4 short on the sour cream and added plain yogurt in to make up the difference. This is truly a wonderful tasting dip (or dressing if you use it that way).

I like a runny dressing so I added some milk to thin it out. This is a very very good dressing. I think fresh herbs would make it even better. To make a lighter version of this dressing (and make it weight watcher friendly) I did the following:  1/2 cup Fiber One Cottage Cheese 1/2 cup fat free mayo 1/2 cup low fat buttermilk  1/2 cup super skim milk  chives, dillweed, parsley, garlic, onion and sald & pepper to taste.  I put all of the ingredient in a food proccessor and it made the perfect lighter version of this recipe!

This is really good. I think next time I will stick to the original recipe. I did the 1/2c. thing using the buttermilk, made it too runny for our taste. The next day I loaded it up with blue cheese and it was heavenly!! I will have this in the fridge often. I think it would be delectable on a baked potato. YUM!

Used 1/2 c each, sour cream, mayo and buttermilk.  It was so good! Besides using on salads, I use it on sandwiches, buffalo chicken pizza and for dipping vegetables.  This is truly a great recipe.

this recipe is so good! I used fresh dill about 1/2 tsp and fresh chives, about 2 Tbsp.  I did use reduced fat mayo and buttermilk, 1/2 cup of each in place of just mayo - I find it is too thick but with the buttermilk, it thins nicely to pour from a bottle.

Wow, VERY yummy!  I used Hellman's Light Mayo and reduced-fat sour cream, but otherwise I made it as the recipe instructed.  I used it to make twice-baked broccoli cheese potatoes - I had two leftover baked potatoes, so I scooped them out, used half the ranch recipe to mix with the potato, steamed some broccoli, threw in some fat-free cheese and mixed it all, then stuffed the shells and sprinkled a bit more cheese on top.  Baked them at 400 for about 20 minutes, and they were REALLY tasty.  I've been craving broccoli baked potatoes, and the addition of the ranch dressing was perfect.  Can't wait to make it again with some of the suggestions, especially subbing in some buttermilk.  Thanks for sharing!

Excellent!!  I used it with the seasons for Artichoke Spread and it was very very good.  I didn't make any dressing but the seasoning sure worked in place of a packet of ranch mix.  thank you for this great replacement, so much cheaper and you know what's in it!  I like that a lot!!

LOVE this recipe! Perfect blend of herbs and spices as is, I did however add some MSG (yeah, I know, not politically correct, but I have read the studies, and it tastes GOOD). I didn't have sour cream but look forward to using it next time as just mayo is really too thick. I used it in a pasta salad and everyone loved it and cleaned their plates.

My daughter and I have been searching for a simple basic ranch dressing and this was fantastic!  The consistency was more like a vegetable dip but by adding a little milk or buttermilk, you can thin it out enough for salad dressing.  I like to have this on hand for a healthy veggie dip snack and will only thin out some for salads on an as-needed basis.  Thank you so much for this recipe!!!!

I've made this twice now, once as is, and once with a few changes. The first time, I thought it was good, but pretty bland. The second time I made it I added more then double the garlic powder, a little more onion powder, and a little extra dill. Oh, and both times I made it I used 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup buttermilk.

This was a great base. We added some garlic pepper seasoning instead of regular pepper and a dash of chili powder, left out the parsley and chives.

Consistency was great, I just thought the dill was a little overpowering (and I like dill).  Next time I'll reduce it.  I added about 1/3 cup of buttermilk.

The flavors are so fresh and wonderful! I made it as stated then tried it. It was very thick and would have made a perfect dip. Then I added 1/4 cup of buttermilk to thin it out. Perfect for salad.

I was soooo excited to be able to make ranch from scratch (I don't know that I even thought it was possible).  I followed this recipe to a T, but was entirely overwhelmed by the dill flavor.  If you like dill, then this is great, but it didn't taste anything like the "ranch" that I expected.  Next time, I'll omit it completely, and then add it little by little to taste....

I use buttermilk instead of sour cream and use fresh parsley and chives from my garden, a dill seasoning blend instead of dill, garlic and onion powder because the blend has all three.  My husband was never a big ranch dressing fan until I started making this recipe.  I've used it on salads and as the "sauce" for pasta salad with fresh cucumber and cherry tomatoes.  Delicious!

I'm glad I "listened" to the reviews that stated to use the buttermilk if you want this for a dressing.  Thanks to Melissa I did and it's still very rich and thick but suitable as a dressing.  I used low fat mayo and low fat buttermilk and I still absolutely love this dressing.  The seasoning is perfect for me.  Just remember if you want a dip the sour cream will be ok I'm sure - I even had to add a bit more buttermilk to get the right consistency. I do think there should be a better description of the use of sour cream vs. buttermilk - only reason I did not give this a 5 also.

One of the most satisfying things about this recipe is when someone says, "That's homemade, isn't it?"  Even if you look at it as a bunch of dried spices, it doesn't taste like it came out of a bottle, or one of those little packets.  Yea!

This is excellent, but the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I feel like it's more of a dip -- and is in fact delicious with raw veggies.  While it is good on a salad, I think it would be even better with a bit of tang in it, like lemon juice maybe, or some buttermilk.

I'm giving this 3 stars, not because it wasn't good, but because I don't believe that this tastes like a true ranch dressing.  The dill overpowers the other flavors but that is just my opinion.  I did enjoy using the recipe as a dip for chips and pretzels.  I will try it again with less dill next time to see if it's the flavor that I associate with ranch.  Thanks!

This was more of a dip consistancy instead of a salad dressing, you would need to do the buttermilk if you wanted it to be for salad dressing.  The flavor was not what I was looking for either.

Skipping the wet ingredients, this worked well in place of half a packet of ranch dressing mix which I did not have on hand.

I used this recipe to make a dip with blended cottage cheese and buttermilk, for nutritional purposes.  It is delicious!  I also added finely shredded sharp cheddar to dry up my dip texture and richen the taste, it is a great dip!

Easy and tasty.  I'm used to ranch being a little thicker, so I may try some of the suggestions next time.  My 12 year old saw me making it and didn't know what it was so he tasted it and said "I can really taste the Ranch". lol Guess it tastes just as it should!

Best Ranch dressing ever!  I like it with a bit less dill, but this recipe has become one of my favorites. Even my husband who rarely eats salad will have seconds now!

This is a very tasty recipe for ranch! I followed it except for substituting the following:

Dried chives: chopped fresh green onions
Onion Powder: 1 tbs dried onion flakes
Up garlic powder from 1/4tsp to 1/2tsp
(Left out the parsley)
Best after it sits a day.
YUM!

Made this exactly as written and it made a fantastic raw veggie dip.  The flavor was very nice and mild, and it was gone in no time!!  Definitely a keeper, and will absolutely make it again and again!!

Loved it! So far, i've made this twice. The first time, I doubled the spices like everyone said, but my 10 year old didn't like it. So next time, I made it as the recipe said, and she liked it. I thought it still had lots of flavor, and everyone else loved it as well. I bought dillweed, which I had never used before, and it gives the dressing that "ranchy" flavour (don't omit it). I didn't read the recipe correctly and bought fresh chives instead of dried. But it still worked out great. I diced them really good and the dressing was terrific.

This was an okay base, but as is, all we could taste was the mayo.  Plus, even though we were using it as a sauce for a Buffalo chicken pizza, it was still too thick.  We doubled all of the spices, which gave it more of a noticeable ranch-flavor, added an extra tablespoon of sour cream, and added a quarter cup milk to thin it out.  For the pizza, this worked fine, but as a salad dressing, I'd add another quarter cup of milk at least.

Try Number Two:  My husband has been craving ranch, but we don't eat dairy, so we can't have the store-bought.  I kept searching and searching for a good ranch recipe I could alter, but kept coming back to this one.  I ended up trying it again with a few changes, and this time, it was great!!

Here's what I did:  Used 1/2 cup canola mayonnaise, 1/2 cup soy sour cream, and a scant 1/2 cup plain almond milk.  I also doubled all the spices.  After an hour in our fridge, it was perfect, and my husband ate it right up!

I thought this was an excellent recipe and will never buy prepared ranch dressing again!  I made a few revisions to suit my tastes.  I doubled the garlic, onion, and chives and used buttermilk instead of sour cream.  Also I added a splash of apple cidar vinegar and honey to taste, which helped to round out the flavors and give it a little zip. Finally, the flavors meld over time and it definitely tastes better the next day, so best to prepare the day before using.

Outstanding dressing!  Everyone in the house enjoyed the recipe. Like another viewer suggested I used 1/2 each mayo, sour cream and buttermilk.

I've made this over and over except for our taste with the following changes: Equal amounts of mayo/sour cream with at least 1/2 c buttermilk to thin. I also use considerably more of the herbs and seasonings than what is listed. I've made with fresh and dried and I prefer the dried. Plus, the dressing seems to last longer with the dried herbs. At this point in time I don't even measure anymore, just use my palm to pour into and throw in to mix. I use my hand blender for the final mixing too.

This is by far my favorite dressing to make, when I serve it as a dip I use sour cream, when I use it for a dressing I use buttermilk.  Everytime I make it I get lots of raves.Thanks

I think my verdict is still out on this one.  I'm not sure this is a keeper for me.  It could be that I used reduced fat mayo and nonfat sour cream; maybe that's what I didn't like about it.  I also took the advice of other reviewers and did the 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream, and 1/2 cup buttermilk ratio which is definitely right on as far as consistency goes.  So that it's not totally eliminated, I am going to try it with regular sour cream to see if that makes a difference.

This stuff is great! I use it as my default veggie dip now. I'd use buttermilk to thin it a bit if I wanted to use it as a dressing, though.

Per other reviewers suggestions, I halved the amount of dill...and I used buttermilk rather than sour cream.  I thought this tasted just like the Hidden Valley Ranch packets...which is not necessarily a bad thing, I was just hoping for something more original.  Still very good though!  :)

This ranch came out way better than the packaged stuff I usually buy!!  I did substitute 1/2 cup of buttermilk for sour cream and I only used about 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, and it was just the right consistancy.  Thanks a bunch!!

We enjoyed this dressing even though it does not taste like Hidden Valley (still on the hunt for the perfect copy).  I substituted homemade cultured kefir for the sour cream - and I'm glad I did because it would have been too thick with the cream.   Next time we will try it with homemade mayonnaise as well.

Well, I added a little more dill to this, since I love dill.  I did see that it was more like a dip than a dressing with the sour cream, but it was perfect for vegetables and hot wings!  It had a nice flavor, different from the bottled ranch.  I think I'm going to start making it from scratch every time.

We liked this- it's more of a dill tasting Ranch- but we love dill! Definitely use buttermilk instead of SC- unless you are making dip!

Pretty good. It really DOES taste like the kind used in restaurants, although i'll use a bit more spice next time. I'm so happy I found this recipe amongst all the others... I can't stand bottled dressings.

This is an amazing recipe.  I thought that it really was like restaurant Ranch Dressing.  I did add a bit of lemon juice (about a teaspoon I think) to thin it out.  It works great on both salads and potato chips!  I will be using this recipe from now on.

Absolutely perfect as is!  I used sour cream as the recipe called for and it's delicious!  Much better than the ranch dressing in a bottle.  Made it initially as a substitute  in a recipe, but it's so good that we'll be using this INSTEAD of store bought from now on!  Thanks Dawnia!

For someone who doesn't even like Ranch Dressing, this recipe has changed my mind.  It was so good.  I didn't change anything to this recipe.  Made it as is.  Since I was going to mix in into a salad and serve, I didn't add the milk to loosen the consistency.  However, when I had left overs and need it to be more "pourable" I added milk as needed (1T at a time) and it did the trick.  This dressing is a big hit and would definitely make you STOP buying store bought.

This was super delicious adn easy to make! We used the buttermilk in place of the sour cream which made it easier to pour. We also used some of our own herbs. It is so much better than store bought! I am so glad we tried it, thanks for the recipe!

By the other reviews, I thought this would be outstanding, but my husband and I thought it was a little blah.  I ended up doubling the dill and adding 1 tsp of lemon juice, and we ate it that way as a veggie dip.

I won't buy bottle dressing again (if I can help it!)  This has wonderful flavor.  I did as others suggested and made with buttermilk.  Other than that, the recipe can stand on its own.  I'm going to try to keep ingredients in the house so I can make this regularly - Thank you Dawnia!

This is delicious and so quick and easy to make.  Immediately upon finishing it you can use it instead of waiting for the flavors to blend. I am certain it will be even better tomorrow.  Thanks!

I didn't have dried parsley or dill weed so I used Italian seasoning. It turned out wonderfully. I tried it with a BLT salad. It has a great flavor.

I've been using this for months. This is great stuff. You won't buy bottled ranch ever again. Made the recipe exactly as written. The longer it sits the more the flavors blend. I highly recommend this recipe.

This recipe tastes authentic. It was fresh and delicious. I would recommend letting it refrigerate for at least 4 hours though and definitely use buttermilk. Excellent!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I was trying to put together a veggie platter for a party, and all to late discovered I was out of ranch dip!  This was the only one on this site with ingredients I had, and it worked great in a pinch!  Of course, I embellished on the seasonings, which I always do since I am a seasoned chef and prefer some "kick" to my foods.  Great recipe, and better than the usual ranch from a bottle for a veggie dip!

A very easy and tasty dip. I think it's too thick to be a salad dressing if you use sour cream and mayo. The buttermilk would make it a good dressing, I imagine.

This tastes so much better than the bottled version!  Like some other users, I also cut down the amount of dill. I used the suggestion of using buttermilk instead of sourcream, and it tasted delicious!

I have recently moved to Canada from the States and I cannot find packets of Hidden Valley Ranch mix anywhere..only the bottled stuff..I always liked ot make it homemade..I was so happy to come across this recipe...The only change I made was decreased the dill just a little and added a touch more garlic powder...sooo good... My husband, who is Canadian, never really ate that much ranch, but he thinks this is really good..Now I wont stress about having family send me the packets from home when I run out..

This was delicious!  Very similar to the good thick dressings (that sell for $2.99) that you buy in jars in the fresh produce section of the grocery stores.  And this is much much cheaper---plus it's homemade.  This is going to part of our Christmas dinner.  A keeper!

This was delicious tasting.  It was, however, very thick and I wanted mine a little bit thinner, so next time I added half the amount of mayo and used buttermilk instead of sour cream.  I also ended up using chopped fresh cilantro in place of the parsley because that's what I had on hand.  I think, personally, that a little lemon juice gives it a nice tang as well. Yum!

I liked it but wasn't in awe over it. Kind of a bit bland.

For those who claim to have made buttermilk from scratch adding a lemon juice or vinegar to milk does not make buttermilk. It makes sour milk. It is a fine substitute for buttermilk. It is not buttermilk though.

 To make buttermilk from scratch you have to make butter and then use the remaining liquid. That is what buttermilk is. The milk left after making butter. Hence the name buttermilk.

I was very short on Ranch dressing for my Buffalo wings so I whipped this up in no time. My guests raved about it and so did my husband. He wants me to throw the bottled dressing out and use this one from now on. I followed the recipe exactly as I had all the ingredients. I was amazed at the flavor with just a few ingredients. I am going to try the buttermilk the next time to thin it down but loved how thick it was and creamy. I will be making this again.

Wonderful recipe!  I used some fresh ingredients instead of a few of the dried (onion, chives, and garlic) and wonderful just the same - probably better.  I'm just one to use fresh whenever possible.  I did add a couple dollops more sour cream, as it seemed a little mayo heavy to me.  But wonderful, just the same!

I am a die hard Ranch Dressing fanatic.  This is by far the BEST ranch dressing I have ever had.  I don't like to eat the bottled stuff anymore.  This is AWESOME!!!

This is a quick & easy recipe, and very tasty. I agree that fresh herbs prob'ly make it better, but there's nothing wrong with using dried. I've been cooking for 45 years and I'm here to tell you there isn't that much difference, if the dressing is allowed an hour in the fridge to marry the flavors. I think the mixture of mayo & sour cream is a good one, because a lot of people don't have fresh buttermilk on hand every day.

This needs some tweaking to make it a dressing and not a dip. It also seemed to be lacking something. I added some freshly squeezed lemon juice which brightened it up a bit. I also increased the seasonings to give it less than a mayo taste. Even after adding the lemon juice it needed some milk to thin it out (buttermilk would have been good but the addition of the lemon juice helped since I didn't have buttermilk). Even with the additional milk it thickened upon chilling which was still way too thick to be considered a dressing IMO. It also seemed to have a "sticky" texture, coating every piece of salad goodness, and not in a good way. While I love homemade ranch this one didn't do it for me.

If you don't have mayo you can use milk instead it tastes just as good

this worked great, i did half cup ea of mayo and plain greek yogurt. I'm sure the taste is fairly similar, it just seemed like a healthier option. dressing tasted great, it was really thick so sometimes i added a little whole milk to thin it down before serving.

Simply awesome! I can choose between two different type of Sour Creams. The lighter(cheaper too) version which is also the more creamy, is the perfect one for this recipe. Otherwise I did everything exactly according to instruction. I love Parsley and Chive so much, therefor decided to doubled the amount on them. This Dip will from now on be the most of the time to find in our fridge. I just found a way to make a homemade  Mayonnaise. I think this will make this recipe even better. That's a 5 Star recipe for me. Simple, inexpensive and unbelievable good taste.

We really enjoyed this.  I was out of sour cream so I used a mixture of yogurt, milk, and lemon (which gave it a nice freshness).  Also used fresh chives as I had some that needed to be used.  You do have to let it sit at least 30 minutes for the flavors to truly develop.  Will definitely make again.  My thanks for the recipe!

This was a great Ranch dressing!  One of the best I've tried.  I halved the sour cream and made up the difference with buttermilk.  The buttermilk made it into a dressing instead of a dip.

My family tried this recipe a couple weeks ago and have had it on salad ever since.  I cut back a little on the dill as I thought it was a little over powering (my family isn't a big fan of dill).  Thanks for sharing!

Even without sitting to allow the flavors to blend, this recipe is wonderful. I was sceptical, but not anymore! Used 1/2 cup each homemade mayonnaise, homemade Greek yogurt, and milk curdled with vinegar for the base. Seasoning and consistency perfect.

I wanted a lighter calorie dressing so used 1/2 light mayo and 1/2 fat free sour cream.  I added reduced fat buttermilk to loosen it up.  It is delicious and my new favorite low cal dressing!

Made recipe as is and found it a little bland.
After using only sour cream, and adding a full teaspoon of both garlic and onion powders, this recipe is a 5 star recipe!

Great to replace the chemical filled bottles that go by the name of Ranch Dressing.  Took 2 minutes in the blender - I used kefir instead of sour cream.  Yummy

This was a pretty good recipe, but it definitely needed more of all the spices. I also used some minced garlic, dash of hot sauce, dash of Worcestershire sauce and a little paprika in the mix. I used 1/3 cup may, 1/3 cup sour cream and just under a 1/3 cup milk with vinegar (buttermilk substitute).

Thanks for an excellent recipe. Like many other home cooks, I am increasingly reluctant to buy commercially prepared, shelf stable products because of the use of chemicals and preservatives. I'm even beginning to experiment with making my own mayo.  This ranch recipe is tasty and is so easy to prepare.

I seem to be the 900th comment here. (like 899 aren't enough). This turned out great! I was out of onion powder, so I ground up some dried minced onions in my coffee/herb mill. Worked fine.

Delicious tasting as is, but is way too thick. I added about a 1/2-2/3 cup milk to thin it out enough to pour and it was still very thick. Also added about a tablespoon of red wine vinegar.

I made this tonight and cut the recipe in half since it's just me and my husband. It was fantastic! I didn't have any sour cream, so I 'made' some buttermilk with 1 tablespoon of fresh lemon juice and 1/2 cup of half and half. I also added another teaspoon of lemon juice, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It was GREAT! Pretty thick, still, but great!

Delicious even before waiting the recommended 30 minutes. Just needed to be thinned out with a touch of milk for dressing consistency, otherwise was perfect for veggie dip

I use this recipe for vegetable dip. We love it. To make it healthier I use 3/4 cup plain yogurt and 3/4 cup of sour cream instead of the mayo. Always turns out great. Best if it sits a night or two in the fridge.

I made this twice, first time as is. I found the original recipe had too much dill and was too thick. The second time I made it, I used 1/2 C light sour cream, 1/2 cup light mayo, and 1/4 cup of fat free half and half to thin it. Measurements for spices stayed the same, EXCEPT reduced dill to 1/8 tsp. it was FABULOUS!!! Let this ranch sit for a few hours for the flavors to meld before reviewing. This is a great Ranch dressing, but with all recipes I adjust to my taste. Make this, then adjust to your liking!!

This was very easy to make and far superior to any brand of bottled ranch I've ever tried.  I used 1/2 cup of regular mayo, 1/2 cup of low-fat buttermilk, and 1/2 cup of sour cream.  As a matter of personal preference, I also reduced the dill slightly.  I'll be using this recipe again.

As stated, this recipe ends up tasting overwhelmingly too mayonnaise-y.  When remaking this I cut the mayo in half, added some buttermilk and it was pretty good.

I read the reviews before I tried this.  I used 1/2 c Mayo, 1/2 c buttermilk, 1/2 c light sour cream, and the spices as listed in the recipe. I think I will cut the dill in half next time, but my son absolutely loves this!  He even suggested adding a bit of BBQ sauce to it and using it as a base sauce for BBQ chicken pizza.  I am not sure how that would bake up, but this dressing was great with to dip our BBQ chicken pizza in!

A four for me but a five for my family!  I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream and less mayo. Thick and creamy and just perfect for the kids.  I'll use it as is for ranch dip and thin with milk for salads. No more store bought for us.  Thank you, Dawnia!

Used 1/2 cup each of buttermilk, mayo, and sour cream. No dill weed. Chilled overnight. Not bad!

Used blend of mayonnaise, buttermilk & sour cream.  Intense herb flavor; you won't go back to store bought.  Would be excellent w/ fresh herbs in the summer.

Having just made this recipe,  I am wickedly irritated that I have bought Ranch dressing for the last 20 years.   This recipe is stupid easy, and is positively FANTASTIC.

This is absolutely delicious, a great hit, but very thick! I ended up adding water to make it thinner to drizzle over salad, but adding buttermilk would probably be better. It's hard to believe how many years I used commercial ranch dressing, never again!

To overcome the mayonnaise, I eventually doubled each of the spices. Than, after a few hours of refrigeration, it was terrific.

Great recipe - really fresh tasting!  I took other reviewers tips and use 1/2 cup each sour cream, mayo, and buttermilk.  When possible try to use fresh herbs (need to triple amount vs using dried).

I am not a fan of store bought ranch dressing, and therefore was very excited to find this recipe! I scaled down the recipe to serve 4 people, and followed the recipe exactly as it was written, but subtituted the sour cream with buttermilk. It tasted good, however I found it to be a little on the bland side. As per the scaled down recipe, I added another 1/8 teaspoon of the parsley, chives, garlic powder, and onion powder, as well as a dash more pepper. It was delicious! I will definitely be making this again.

Took Christy's advice with the spices but didn't add any buttermilk not oil as i wanted it to be more of a ranch dip vs. dressing.   also, substituted  miracle whip for the mayo and used fresh chives.  turned out amazing! took it to a potluck and was being asked left and right for the recipe.  THANKS!!

This is a nice base for homemade ranch.  I did add fresh garlic as i felt it was a little bland.  I have also added a teaspoon of taco seasoning and some salsa for a taco salad dressing.

I followed another reviewer's advice and cut the sour cream in half and added 1/2 cup buttermilk (well, milk and lemon juice style), added some vinegar and doubled the garlic powder.  Also, I had no chives so I doubled the onion powder.  This was fantastic! Loved it so much, I'm going to get fat on ranch dressing!  Why would anyone buy bottled dressing when they can make this scrumptious recipe so easily?

I gave it 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe for consistency. I found it was too thick , so I use less mayo and add some buttermilk.  The herb blend is delicious mixed into a bar of cream cheese and a little milk -1 tbls. It makes a great spread for crackers, Leftovers, if there are any, would be great on a fluffy baked potato.

Thanks for sharing.

This was very good... I will admit, I did add a rounded 1/4 tsp of garlic salt as well. For my liking, it needed a bit more salt/garlic. I served this to a serious ranch dressing lover and she LOVED it. Said it was better than the packet kind. Also, I used fresh chives (green of the green onion, about 1 1/2 Tbsp, not actual chives) because that is what I had on hand. I will be making this again. A for sure KEEPER!! Thanks Dawnia!

This has become my go-to recipe when I want to make homemade ranch dressing.  Following the lead of another reviewer, I use 1/4 cup sour cream and 1/4 cup buttermilk (instead of the 1/2 cup sour cream).  BTW -- I keep powdered buttermilk on-hand at all times to avoid buying large containers when only a small amount is needed.  I use the powdered buttermilk in this recipe and it turns out just fine.  I generally add just a bit of paprika as well; the red color adds a little 'character' to the color of this dressing.  It stores well in the refrigerator, too.

This was great! I used 1/2 cup buttermilk instead of sour cream. You can't have ranch w/o buttermilk! I also halfed the dill, and upped each of the other spices just a bit for extra flavor. We are allergic to bland food around here! But you can't get an accurate taste right after you make it. You really need to let it sit in the fridge for a while to let the flavors combine. My hubby tasted it right after I made it & didn't like it. When he ate it w/ his chicken wings & carrots after it'd been in the fridge a couple hours, he loved it! So if you're not letting the flavors combine, yes, it tastes too much like mayonnaise. Otherwise, it's yummy! It is on the thick side. Not ideal for salad dressing, but was perfect as dip w/ our chicken wings. This will be my new go to recipe for ranch!

This dressing is really GOOD, except I think it's a bit thick. It's more like a "dip". However, the taste is exceptional!!! Thx~

I love this recipe! I've been using it for several years and just realized I never reviewed it. I make it almost exactly as the recipe states, except I double the garlic. It's the perfect consistency for dipping, and every time I serve it everyone asks me where I got it. Delicious! Thank you so much!

Quick. Easy. Delicious. We add a good dash of milk to thin it down but it has all the taste that we love in Ranch. Really good to use for a BLT salad. Adds a kick of flavor to that already yummy BLT taste. I can sit and dip veggies while watching TV and have no snack guilt feelings. :)

My 10 year old daughter prepared this today for our dinner salad.  She made it just the way it's written and we loved it.  
**To make it thinner, add 1/4 cup milk and 1/8 tsp seasoning salt and it's great.

Sooooo good! Love to crumble bacon in it for a more decadant dip.  Also can be made with light sour cream and mayo and thinned out with skim milk for a less fattening dip or dressing.  Thanks for the great combo of herbs and spices!

In a pinch, I will make this recipe again because it contains all the ingredients I already have in my pantry.  Flavor is good but it's a little too thick for salad.  You may need to thin it out....not sure how yet. :)  It works best as a dip...wings, carrots, etc.  Thank you Dawnia.

This is a great substitute for bottled ranch dressing, and it tastes better too!  However if you want dressing, not dip, definitely replace the sour cream with milk or buttermilk.  The only variation I made was I used celery salt in place of regular salt.  Will definitely make again!

To me this tastes like a fresh version of Hidden Valley which I wasn't expecting at all. The things I did differently were 1/2 tsp salt and fresh pepper, 1tsp of the rest (though with fresh dill, parsley and Mexican onion which tastes a tiny bit milder than chives), 1/2c light mayo, somewhere between 1tsp and 1tbsp of fresh lemon juice and then about 1tbsp of plain almond milk. I should've just used 1/8tsp salt otherwise it's still very good and has a regular dressing consistency.

I substituted buttermilk I had leftover from making butter and all fresh herbs from the garden.  GREAT! Very easy recipe and I will never buy ranch dressing ever again!  (I added some horseradish one night for a little extra kick, which also came out pretty good)  The next night I added cilantro to some of the ranch and used it as a taco topping.  This made for the best tacos ever!

BEST. RANCH. DRESSING. EVER.  I substituted a few fresh herbs because it's what I had but I think it will be just as good with the dried.  I will definitely be making this again.  It tasted like a house made dressing from a high end restaurant.

Great, quick recipe for a simple, healthy dressing. Recommend thinning out with 1/4-1/2 cup olive oil if you'd like to pour instead of dip.

This was my first attempt at making my own from scratch (really from scratch, no packet from Hidden Valley..lol) We loved it.  I was a little heavy handed on the dill but my dh loved it anyway.  Thanks for posting.

Made as is. So gooood!!! Used it as a dip for a fried pickles recipes from this site and will use it as my go-to dip from now on.  To use as a dressing, I would thin it out with buttermilk or milk until desired consistency.

This dressing is absolutely delicious!  I followed it to a t and served it with boneless buffalo wings.  However, I did add a bit of buttermilk to thin it out when I had a garden salad.  This is the first homemade ranch dressing recipe I've ever used and it may be the only homemade ranch dressing recipe I use!  Fabulous!

Had a taste for a restaurant type Ranch dressing, and this did not disappoint! Excellent! I made the dressing in the bottom of a salad bowl and added the lettuce, cukes, tomaotes etc over it. I used about 1/4 cup each of mayo, sour cream & buttermilk and decreased the spices, also. It was so good!! Will def make this again & again as it was not difficult at all!!

This recipe is pretty bland.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time. The second time, I used 1/2 C mayo, 1/2 C sour cream and 1/2 C buttermilk per other reviews. It was still a little bland.  The search continues for a tangier ranch dressing.

Great recipe! I just can't find a bottled version I like anymore. I had an AMAZING recipe that uses fresh herbs, but the herbs start to taste wilted after about a week, so I found this recipe. WONDERFUL! I used 1 cup of mayo, 1/2 cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup of buttermilk. I used a minced garlic clove instead of dried, and ended up doubling the dill and chives. I also added about 1/2 tsp of white pepper to give it some kick. Heavenly! This has a permanent place in my fridge :)

This is a great basic recipe.  I made just as the recipe states and I found two huge flaws.  First off, it's more of a dip than a dressing.  It's thick.  And let me tell you, we normally like our dressing thicker than thin.  We found that this dressing was even too thick for us.  Next, it was really bland.  I will make this again but with play around with it until I can get it right.  More seasonings, less mayo and maybe add some milk to thin it just a bit.

I rated it on the recipe as it's listed. This was a really good recipe! My only problem with it was it was more of a "dip" consistency.. very, very thick. It also tasted a lot like dill, which is okay, but it was just too much for my tastes.  So then I made it with buttermilk instead of sour cream, used half the dill and a little more onion powder and it was great! This is a very good base recipe-- I might try adding bleu cheese or minced onion next time!

It's ok for dipping veggies but way to thick for salad. I thought the dill weed was too strong, will change up the spices next time. I really happy that I have a dressing I can eat because all the store bought ones have vegatble gums in them and I'm allergic.  So anyone else allergic to gums will love this recipe!

This is my first time trying out a recipe from here and did this ranch dressing.  i've never tasted ranch dressing before but i bet it's not as good as this one!  It was totally easy to make...i didnt follow the measurement..just went along with my instinct/tastebud...i couldn't find onion powder on the supermarket shelf..so like one of the reviewers did..i upped on the garlic powder.  Left it overnight..and used it for the Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs..I'm gonna so make this again soon.

What a great recipe! I scaled it down to 6 servings for a veggie & dip tray. It was plenty. I halved the mayo and sour cream but kept all the other ingredients as listed. After mixing everything, I let it sit in the fridge for about an hour to let the flavors come through. I've made this dip many times - I don't plan on ever buying dip in the future now that I've found this treasure.

I followed the recipe exactly.  It was -really- thick.  My husband is addicted to Hidden Valley Ranch, light or regular.  He said this was "okay," which usually means he doesn't want to hurt my feelings.  I also tried to thin it down with milk.  Still no sale.

Wow, if I knew making Ranch dressing was this fast, easy and good, I'd have stopped buying those bottles of chemicals (titanium dioxide anyone?) ages ago!  All I did was mix the mayo, buttermilk, parsley, minced garlic, salt and pepper and I was ready for carrot dippin.

Five stars, with a few changes.  I used 1/2 cup mayonnaise, 1/2 cup sour cream, and closer to a cup of buttermilk (I was going for dressing consistency).  I fried up a couple of pieces of good bacon and crumbled it really tiny into the dressing.  It also got better the longer it sat.  By day two you could taste the bacon in every bite.  It was fantastic and now I get to figure out how to do it again.

There was WAY too much dill in this recipe!  My son was reading me each item as I was getting them from the cupboard and adding them to the bowl.  I asked him 3 times to repeat how much dill was needed, then checked myself.  I would try again with half the dill.

5 stars if you follow Christy's advice and do the 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup mayo.  Great flavor and good dressing consistancy.  Use less buttermilk if you want more of a dip.

My families new FAVORITE ranch dressing!  The recipe as is, is very thick, perfect for a dip.  Today, I made potato salad.  My family likes ranch dressing in it, but we didn't have any.  Remembering this recipe, I quickly pulled out all the ingredients and wala, 5 minutes later, I had my dressing.  For a runnier consistency, I doubled all spices and then added buttermilk to the mayo/sour cream to get the consistency I wanted.  So very good!  My kids today told me I should make this from now on instead of buying from the store.  I think I will make this next time with low fat mayo and no fat sour cream for a healthier variety.  I'll post this on here later to let you know how this went.    P.S. I took the potato salad to a barbecue and when I got there, there were two other potato salad dishes there.  In the end, mine was all gone and the other dishes were only half gone!  I received many compliments!  Thanks for this recipe.

I used fresh herbs from the garden, and even so, there was something missing for me, no matter how good it already was!  I put about 1/2 teaspoon aged white wine vinegar and got the taste I was looking for.  It gave it a little more depth....

This was delicious!  I modified to fit what I had on hand and used light mayo and sour cream.  I used no chives, dil weed, or onion powder. I doubled the garlic powder and added paprika.

was looking for a recipe to make closer to natural....this was very good.  I used plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and a more healthy mayo with flax.  This one's a keeper!

This is Great Ranch Dressing! I cannot stand bottlled ranch dressing, and even the package is a little too much. I think I finally have figured out its the buttermilk. I did change the recipe a bit. 1/2 cup mayo 1/2 cup sour cream increased the garlic like alot of other diners. And completley left out the dill. Made it before didnt care for the dill. And added 1/4 cup of milk. It was great tasted alot like one of of our favorite pizzarias. Not too strong!

As wriiten, this recipe is not that great.  Instead of being a dressing, it is more like a dip.  Very thick and heavy on a dill taste.  I am going to try it again by thinning with buttermilk and cutting the dill in half, if not more.

WOW!!!I thought it was going to be horrific when I first made this for the simple fact I'm not a big fan of plain mayo, and thats all I tasted at first.I let it sit in the refridgerator till next day and boy am I glad I did.It made a huge difference sitting.I did try per other reviews halfing the mayo and adding buttermilk and doubling the garlic.What a fantastic, clean ranch taste this has for a base ranch dressing,I will not be buying bottled again.After a very few modifications this is one of the best ranch dressings I've had.Adding grated parmesan and more pepper also makes a great parmesan pepper dressing too.Thank You for the recipe.

Delicious.  My daughter tried it and wanted the recipe, also.  Thank you for sharing!  I did use buttermilk instead of sour cream for the dressing, will use sour cream in a dip.  Yummy!

I didn't have chives :( and used mayo, sour cream and 2% milk. Guessed at the amount of herbs/spices to taste. This is a really really good recipe, much better than the bottle or the packet. Thank you so much for posting - I won't buy premade again.

I've made this dressing many times. Absolutely no changes whatsoever! Ranch dressing is my hubby's favorite, and comments how much he loves it every time! NOTE: I double the recipe and store in a Food Saver canister. I keeps fresh for a very long time.

Thank you for this recipe. I've just eliminated buying the dressing. My family will only eat this now and it's encouraged them to take veggies to school too. What an incentive to make this. I did make some adjustments; reversed the ratio of sour cream to mayo, added some finely minced scallions and onion, increased the quantity of parsley and garlic powder. Definitely a great addition to my recipe box collection.

This is so great!  I change the ingredients to 4 servings and it gives me all of the measurements that go perfectly with a can of tuna and some diced pickles.  Add to fresh bread and voila!  Tuna sandwich!

This really is one of the best tasting ranch dressings that we've ever had. Like other reviewers, I used the 1/2 cup buttermilk, 1/2 cup mayo, and 1/2 cup sour cream combo instead of just the mayo/sour cream and it was delicious. Thanks, Dawnia, for a great dressing recipe!

I am truly amazed with this recipe!!  I scaled it down to 2 servings because I was so skeptical about the results but it is fantastic!  It tastes like ranch dressing from the store but better.  It's similar to a peppercorn ranch...so, if you aren't a fan of that, decrease the amount of black pepper.  I did decrease the dill to 1/16 teaspoon and it was GREAT!!  I used light sour cream and light mayo and it still tasted awesome!

I wanted something with ingredients I could pronounce and that would taste really good.  I am not really a ranch dressing person but my kids are, so I thought I would try this...I LOVE it!!  So did the kids and hubby!!  Incredibly easy to make too, with ingredients I already had around the house.  The only thing I did differently was to use fresh chives because I didn't have dried ones.  So good, I will make this over and over!!!  Thanks for the recipe!  8D

I don't really like ranch, but LOVE this recipe.  I like that I can make dressing fresh and without all the  that goes into commercial dressings.  I even modified it for my son who is lactose intolerant, using veganaise and Tofutti sour cream.  Came out GREAT!!

Not a bad recipe.  I did adjust it a bit and used 1/2 cup each sour cream, mayo, and buttermilk.  It had a pretty good flavor, although I found the dill to be a bit too strong for my personal preference.  I would make it again though and reduce the dill and increase the garlic and onion powders.  Definitely a good base recipe for Ranch dressing that you can play around with and personalize to your own liking and so much better than the bottled stuff in the stores.

Oh, wow!  I have just whipped it up as written except using dried buttermilk and reconstituting as instructed on the package and using a lower fat olive oil based mayo. The flavors are amazing and it hasn't even had a chance to really blend yet.  It was so easy - I won't be buying bottled Ranch ever again.  Thank you SO much for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe.  Very easy and nothing artificial.  I use 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup plain yogurt, and 1/2 cup sour cream to lower the fat content and it turned out really well.  I make it all of the time.

We make this all the time in the place of store bought ranch.  You can't go wrong with the way it is written, but it's also fun to tweak it depending on your preference.  I've also used this recipe when things call for dry ranch mix.  I just take out all the liquids and use the called for seasoning.  It's much better without all those nasty preservatives!

Wow! This recipe already has soooo many great reviews but I still wanted to add mine. This recipe is incredible. Unlike other recipes I have tried this one is really thick and creamy like store bought ranch dressing. I did ADD about 3 Tablespoons of dried buttermilk because so many other recipes called for it.

Excellent dressing/dip.  I used almond milk with lemon juice as a subsitute for buttermilk.  The consistancy if perfect as dressing or dip.

I would give it 5 stars if it would have told me to buy buttermilk. The flavor was great but it was more for a dip like others have said (I try to follow the instruction, but now I know maybe I should listen). I will for sure make it again, but if it's for a salad then FOR SURE buttermilk for the actual dressing consistency

Absolutely wonderful. My family loves it. I use plain yogurt instead of the sour cream and I add extra spices.

I halved the recipe, but other than that, did everything as instructed.  I didn't think it was the best ranch ever, but it was pretty darn good.  Don't make it the day you plan to use it becuase it tastes better after it sits for a day.

This is by far the best homemade Ranch dressing I have ever had. It is always a tremendous hit when ever I make it (which is all the time) The only thing I added was 1/3 cup of buttermilk.  Love this recipe. Very refreshing summer salad dressing.

Fantastic ranch dressing!  I followed other reviewers's advice, and decreased the amount of dill.  Living in the UK, I cannot find ranch dressing, and, even if I could, I won't be going back to bottled dressing now!  Thanks!

Good stuff.  A little too much dill for my taste, so I added more chive and garlic.

I wouldn't use this on a salad because it is pretty thick. But, I used it on a chicken wrap and to dip veggies in and it was great. I used Olive Oil mayo and that was quite good. Great recipe!

I have been trying to find a good ranch dip/dressing.  This was fantastic.  I made it for a family get together and had to make more!  Everyone loved it.  I have not heard so many ahhs and oohs before.  It was gone before I knew it.  Maybe I need to triple the recipe.

Was ok, not great! I used 1/2 mayo, 1/2 sr. cream and 1/2 buttermilk. Still found the mayo to be overpowering in taste.  Dressing was missing the "wow" factor, but not sure what exactly is missing.

This was a good recipe, but I did make some changes so I am reviewing as I made it, not as it is written.  I used equal parts of sour cream, mayo, and buttermilk in order to add the buttermilk flavour and make it pourable.  Lots of garlic and dill, I made this for a green salad at a family get together, and everyone loved it, a few even asked for the recipe.  Great flavour, even better the next day.

I made this just as stated and it was too thick for a dressing, better for a dip. Also, it had too much dill. The dill was overpowering. I think it will have a great flavor if the dill is reduced.

I don't buy ranch dressing anymore!  This is a great recipe.   I've made it using 1c buttermilk (or 1 TBSP white vinegar and enough milk to make 1 cup) to it to make it thinner, and it turned out great.

Yum! My kids love ranch with everything, but I hate buying the stuff at the store, because it's got all kinds of additives and preservatives.  This is a perfect replacement--better than the store-bought. The 1st time I made it, I did it w/ just the mayo and the sour cream.  It was wonderful, but thick like a veggie dip.  And, it definitely tasted better after a night in the fridge. The 2nd time, I did 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream, and buttermilk.  Dressing perfection achieved! :) The 2nd time, I did 1/2 tsp. of the garlic and onion powders (instead of 1/4 tsp.).  I liked it better that way (& it's easier for me to remember when it's 1/2 tsp. all around. Hahaha!).  Great recipe with all the right herbs and flavors!  Thank you!

Excellent Recipe!  I did adjust a little based upon personal preference after the first batch, but did enjoy as written as well.  My 2nd batch I used equal 1/2 cup measures of Mayo, Sour Cream and Buttermilk to make it a little thinner, and less dill weed (1/4 teaspoon) and more garlic powder (1/2 teaspoon) and added a teaspoon of Johnny’s Garlic Bread Seasoning (mostly more garlic and parmesan).  My taste preference is more garlicky and a little less dill.  This was a great home made alternative to the yucky bottled stuff or the expensive seasoning packets (Hidden Valley, etc.) that have stuff like MSG, and other chemical, preservative, fillers, etc.  I won’t be buying store bought / premade seasoning ranch dressing again.

I HATE store bought ranch so I've been looking for one from scratch. THIS IS DEFINITELY IT! It tasted great right away- I can't wait to try it in a couple more days when the flavors have melded. I think I'm going to use the dry ingredients in small jars and give them (with directions) at Christmastime! I'll be using this for serving guests dips and dressings. Thanks for this great recipe!

So far this recipe has come very close to a restaurant recipe I have been trying to figure out. Very refreshing. However, do not be lazy like me and throw it in the blender. It will come out runny.

This is blander than regular Ranch dressing, and too thick.  I added 1/4 cup milk, 1 t worcestershire sauce, seasoned rice vinegar to taste (about 2 Tbl) and some extra chives, garlic powder and salt.

I added a teaspoon or so of worcestershire sauce for added flavor, and about 1/8 cup of milk to give this the consistency of a creamier, more liquidy dressing.  I also used fresh parsley simply because I love the flavor of the fresh parsley from my garden... I never use dry anymore.  This dressing is perfect with a garden salad.  Yummy!

I didn't have chives or onion powder, so I increased garlic powder and dill. I made it just now and it is delicious! I'm sure it will be even better after it sits for 30 minutes or more. Very close to a bottled ranch, I think.

THE BEST is the only way to rate this ranch dressing.  No more store bought for this family - no more questionable preservatives either!  I make it as stated except for doubling the dill - because we love the stronger dill taste.  As is, still delicious, and that is how I make it for a group.  Try adding a couple of tablespoons of salsa for a salsa ranch, or mix in the blender with some cilantro for another yummy variation!

I reviewed this recipe a few years ago, and wanted to re-review.  I took a hint from another reviewer, and now use equal parts mayo, sour cream, and buttermilk.  I also use only sea salt, and I double the amount in the recipe.  If this is too thick, add more buttermilk to keep from diluting the taste.  I was never a ranch fan, and made this for my stepkids, but now I love it!!
Original review:  The kids could not believe this wasn't from the package.  I was thrilled that it had the great taste of Ranch with none of the chemicals in the packet.  I diluted it quite a bit because I like thin dressing.  I mixed it according to the recipe, then added plain milk til it was the consistency I wanted.   Thanks!

This has the most amazing flavor! We never have onion powder around, so I add a little extra garlic powder. It's a little thick for a dressing, so when I want it for salad I add either milk or half and half. Sometimes mine gets a little salty, so I add a pinch of powdered sugar. Every time I make this it is eated almost instantly! Never will we buy ranch dressing again! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Too much dill flavor for me the first time I made it but easily adjusted to. Best flavor/consistency with buttermilk added!

This is better thanHidden Valley Ranch salad dressing. I added a half of cup of buttermilk and it really made a difference.  Let the dressing ferment overnight in the refrigerator.

Excellent. Double the spice. If you want to make this non-dairy, use a bit more mayo, and add 1 tsp. of lemon juice to get some tang.
Update: If you do make this dairy, replace 1/2 cup of mayo with 1/4 cup buttermilk. Great!

Loved this dressing.  I did follow the advice of others and used 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream and buttermilk.  I added a little extra garlic and dill.  Very tasty.  Will definately make this again!

This dressing was quick and easy to make. I used plain yogurt instead of sour cream and I skipped the chives because I did not have any on hand. It turned out great.

Absolutely delicious!  I double the herbs and use fresh chives...I could eat it by the spoonful.  I omit the buttermile and use it mostly as a veggie dip.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is excellent exactly as written. Sometimes I replace the sour cream with buttermilk. Either way it is wonderful. Letting the dressing meld overnight enhances the flavor.

I can't believe I used to buy salad dressing in bottles. This takes just a few minutes to make and tastes great. I used 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream and buttermilk. The recipe is very forgiving. I only have a teaspoon measuring spoon so I estimated the herbs and it was perfect.

My daughter loves to dip her pizza in ranch dressing so upon discovering that we had none she and i decided to try this instead of heading back to the grocery store. She says that from now on im not allowed to buy it. I do recommend letting it sit for about 1 hour in the fridge to let the flavors marry. yummy!!

I just needed the flavoring in place of a packet of dry ranch dressing mix. It was for a corn salad and this was so much better! I used fresh chives, dill and parsley because the herb garden is really full and it tasted great!

YUM!!!  We tried this recipe and it was great!  We decreased the dill slightly and added a bit more chives.  Also, we added an additional each ingredient when we added milk to thin it to our desired consistency.  SO GRATEFUL WE FOUND THIS RECIPE!!!!!!  We've already passed it on to our friends!!!!!  Thanks Again!

I gave this recipe 4 stars because of the modification I made, but the result was the best ranch dressing I've ever tasted. I considered the modifications of other members and used the following:
Added 1 tsp Olive Oil
Added 1/4 cup grated parmesan
Added 1 TSP white wine vinegar (it was flat without this addition)
Doubled the herbs and spices
Used 1/2 cup each mayo, sour cream, buttermilk
Added 1TBSP lemon juice

With these modification, the dressing was wonderful. I won't use store bought again.

I received RAVE reviews for this dressing.  I tweaked it just a bit by adding fresh chives and some buttermilk to make it a bit more creamy.  This will become a staple in my house!  Thanks.

I needed a dressing in a hurry so rather than spend $10 in gas to go to the store, I made this one using fresh herbs from my herb garden.  I used 1-1/2 TB chopped fine to substitute for the chives, parsley and dill.  It was pretty thick, so I thinned it with some buttermilk.  I did end up adding a touch of salt.  Great recipe.  Even my picky daughter and grandson LOVED it!  They took the leftover dressing home.  Today I'll make more, chop the herbs even finer and use less mayo and more buttermilk.  I do make my own mayo for this type of recipe and I think I'll add garlic to the mayo being made and perhaps eliminate the garlic powder altogether.  I never realized that dill was the mystery ingredient in ranch dressings that I could never identify.
Thanks for this recipe.  No more Hidden Valley for us!

This is a really great recipe.  Better than the stuff you pay a lot of money for that comes in a bottle.  I added about a tsp of olive oil as suggested previously and agree that it makes a smoother dressing.

Fantastic!  Doubled all the herbs and spices, used 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup lite sour cream, and 1/2 cup fat-free buttermilk.  Added a bit more buttermilk to thin for salad dressing.  Absolutely delicious!

I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy this recipe, as I've hated Ranch dressing since childhood. I think I can see why now, though, as this doesn't have that weird, almost tangy aftertaste that bottled dressing does. For the sour cream portion, I used a mixture of buttermilk and Greek-style yogurt (which is very similar to sour cream) and it gave the final product the perfect consistency. Thanks a million!

Started with 1/3 cup mayo, 1/3 cup sour cream and 1/3 cup buttermilk.  Then after adding the other ingredients used a little extra buttermilk to thin to desired consistency. Great dressing!

Used as is for dip, was fantastic (changes: cut mayo in 1/2, didn't have any chives, put in an extra shake of garlic). Will thin with buttermilk for salad dressing tomorrow.  Can't wait!

Oh my Gosh! This is the BEST ranch dressing ever. I will never buy store bought dressing again. I added a bit of milk to thin it out for salad dressing and didnt have dried chives, just fresh. Next time I will try it with buttermilk and use all fresh herbs from my garden. Tasted wonderful. My hubby loved it, I loved it. Definitely a keeper, thanks!

Love it! I found this recipe when I got tired of the greek and  raspberries salad dressings (found also here).
 I added double the dill, and used fresh parsley (besides the dry) and green onions (didn't have the chives). After trying it out once I ran to get buttermilk, and used 1/2 sour cream 1/2 buttermilk. Yummm, husband loves it.

This is excellent and very easy.  I would definitely make this again.  The only change I made was I used fresh chives rather than dried as I didn't have any dried chives on hand.

Wonderful recipe. I did everything to the T except adding buttermilk to make it more liquidy. It smelt wonderful and looked just like ranch. It even tasted good before I put it in the fridge. Let's see how it is on my salad tomorrow. Thanks poster.

Excellent.  Made it as written and then refrigerated it until I was ready to use it.  I then added milk to make it the consisistancy I liked.  Mmm Mmm...

This is the best Ranch Dressing ever! It is not made with buttermilk, which I like, because buttermilk is not a staple in my house. My family loved it! I will never buy store bought Ranch Dressing again!

Yummy, and I love making this for my kids - no additives.  It is thick, but they like it that way, very "dippable".

As written is it very thick and has a strong mayo taste.  I did add about 1/2 cup of buttermilk which helped thin it out and gave it more of a ranch flavor. I made it and let it sit in fridge for 24hr and it had a nice flavor, but after 3 days it had an awesome taste with veggies. I will make this again. It is easy and cost about the same as the bottled stuff but has a better taste.

I am very happy with this Ranch Dressing recipe use the dressing on a daily basis.  It lends itself well to slight alterations like using plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  I also add some milk to thin it a bit to make it more pourable.

Used to live in Canada and loved Ranch dressing. I cannot get a good one in NZ, too vinegary. This one is awesome! Have used for years now as a dip and add milk to thin as a dressing. Thanks

My family and I love this recipe; we have been using it for years.  I make it with sour cream or buttermilk (which ever I have on hand) and both are great.  Warning!  Once you start using this recipe there is no going back to store bought stuff.  I have tried a couple of times when I have been in a hurry and my family was full of complaints.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I agree that it is somewhat thick if you do not use the buttermilk.  You can thin it with a little bit of milk or buttermilk.  I liked the combination of herbs a lot.  I noticed that someone was hoping for more of the sour or buttermilk flavor I believe?  I was also interested in that flavor and to get it added just a bit of white vinegar.  I halved the recipe and used about 1/2 tsp of vinegar.  Start with just a little and add to taste.  We used this for dipping spicy wings so it worked great that it was thick.  I like other reveiwers ideas of adding some garlic and will definitely try it that way next time.

Good, but not great.  This is not the consistency I was looking for.  I'm trying to find a steakhouse ranch texture/consistency. This recipe has the same consistency as store-bought ranch to me. Flavor is good though.

This ranch has a really good flavor. I'm not really a dill fan, so I'll cut down on that next time, and it was a little too thick for me, so, as another reviewer suggested, I will replace the sour cream with buttermilk in the future. A really nice change from other Ranch dressings though.

I've made this recipe exactly as written and I've made the buttermilk version suggested by many reviewers.  It was wonderful both ways.  When I used the butter milk version of the dressing I was cooking for 60 people and I needed a dressing that would pour easily.  It was great. This dressing will be a staple at our house. Thank you!

I changed this a little, so I held back a star.  I'm pregnant and was craving veggies with dip, but didn't want to feed my unborn MSG.  Glad I found this recipe.  After a few changes, it was perfect.  I used 1/2 c. mayo, 3/4 c. sour cream, 1/4 c. buttermilk, and a little extra garlic powder.  Definitely curbed my craving.  It was awesome.

Great dressing! I used buttermilk but doubled the amount as other reviews said the dressing was too thick as is. We enjoyed it in the "Warm chicken ranch wraps" from this site: perfect mix of herbs and spices!

I did as other reviewers suggested and used equal parts sour cream, buttermilk and mayo.  I also substituted and added a couple herbs, and it went for a whirl in the blender with two cloves of garlic and some leek because I thought it needed something else.  I thought it was fairly good, but my friends thought it was awesome.  I mixed the leftovers with mayo and celery salt and used it for pasta salad- in that form, it was probably the best pasta salad I've ever had!  So, 3 stars as salad dressing and 5 as sauce for pasta salad.  Oh and I like the Buttermilk Garlic dressing on this web site a lot more than this for salads.  Thanks for the recipe!

I halfed the recipe and followed it exactly. I used sour cream. With the sour cream, it would probably be good as a veggie dip, but way too thick and sour cream tasting for a salad dressing...Next time I'll use buttermilk. I'm sure that will help with the consistency and the flavor. The spices seemed right on though.

I wanted a lower fat option so I used fat free sour cream and low fat mayo, cutting the fat to 5 grams and calories to 70 per 2 tablespoons.  Finally a low fat ranch that doesn't TASTE like a low fat ranch!  (I also thought it was heavy on the dill flavor, so I added more chives and pepper and it was fine)

Just when I had given up hope of ever finding a ranch dressing that doesn't contain MSG I find this! (May I suggest everyone research MSG-it's awful for our bodies) Thank you soooo much for sharing this recipe!!! I'm so excited!!

I have a recipe that calls for Ranch dressing that I've been wanting to try. So my husband and I were at the store reading all the Ranch dressing labels. They all contain MSG (monosodium glutamate), which I can't have since I'm severely allergic to it. I found your recipe and tried it and - oh my goodness - this must be one of the best dressings we've ever had! I love using it as a veggie dip, too. I did follow someone else's advice and used 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream and buttermilk. I don't think it tasted too "dilly" at all (of course, I like dill). Thanks for a great recipe!! You ROCK!

15,000 stars!!!! I love, love, love this stuff. The only thing I did was added 1/2 c of buttermilk, because I had it on hand and I also added between 1/8 c and 1/4 c of grated parm/romano cheese.  I would eat this with a spoon if I could get by with it. THE BEST!

Rather disappointing.  One reviewer said it tasted just like the packets of ranch sold in stores, so I was happy; I really like that dressing but wanted to make it from "scratch" without all the additives and preservatives.  But this does not taste like it at all.  I like the buttermilk flavor, so I used 3/4 C. mayo and 3/4 C. buttermilk.  The predominant flavor was mayo, which isn't my favorite.  I might make it again, but I will try some different tweaks.

Good dressing.  Felt it was a bit heavy on mayonnaise-flavor, so next time I'd cut back on the mayo a bit - maybe to 3/4 cup.  Balance of herbs was good, but I might try tad less dill and use fresh versus powdered garlic.  I thinned out the dressing with a little milk to make more fluid and it worked great.  Aside from being tasty on salad, this makes a GREAT sandwich spread (try it on a grilled chicken sandwich - yum!!)

There is another clone that I took some advice from, and that's to add a little accent or msg. The flavor seems to fade after a day or 2. Although, its pretty darn close to what we are all looking for, and I think its Hidden Valley. I keep the dry ingredients mixed and ready. Certainly saves you $$. Those packets are expensive! NOTE: I think I'll cut down on the dill and up the garlic and onion powder. Thanks for the recipe, defintite keeper.

I made this last night and loved it.I really like the dill flavor in it. My husband loved it too.My kids won't eat salad.  Thanks for an easy recipe. I have two bottles of ranch dressing in the cupboard and now I don't know when I will use them! By the way,I used buttermilk instead of sour cream. Thanks!

I've never made homemade dressings before, but I'm glad I gave it a try.  I like this better than the Hidden Valley pkg. kind.  This will definately be a staple in my fridge!

This was good-we thought it was missing something though and you have to thin with buttermilk-too thick. We liked it better as a dip then a dressing.

You might want to decrease the amount of dill just a bit, and I thinned it with a little whole milk.  Otherwise, I find this recipe excellent!!

Really good.  I made it with buttermilk instead of sour cream and doubled the recipe.  Our family loves buttermilk dressing over slow-cooked green beans with ham.  I will definitely make this dressing again.  Thanks Dawnia for this great recipe.  Angela

This rach dressing was really good, but it was quite thick, more like a dip then a salad dressing.  the next time I make it I think I will modify it a bit and use buttermilk to make it thinner.  The spices were perfect.  I will definitly use this recipe again.

Yummy!!!  I have been waiting for a "from sratch" recipe for ranch dressing.   I used all the dry ingredients in a cheese ball, it was really nice.  I can't wait until I try this on a chef salad.  Also, maybe to dip my pepperoni pizza in!!!  thanks for the great recipe.

This was an amazing find! It really taste much better than one from the store. I doubled spices, added buttermilk, grated fresh garlic and onion to taste. I loved it so much I just made another double batch! Also fantastic with gorgonzola:)

I made this because I needed veggie dip. I used fresh dill - a lot of it. I added a bit or sriracha too. The texture is so creamy. It's a really good personalizable recipe.

If you like a great, fresh, Ranch dressing, this recipe is solid as is. 

COOK'S NOTE: If you have it handy, replace the sour cream with buttermilk 1:1; it makes it a little easier to pour. Also, I doubled the dill to 1 tsp. (or more) because I really love the herb. Enjoy!

Very good and easy recipe! Followed everything the same but added a few splashes of buttermilk at the end to thin it out a bit. Also added a tad more salt to taste. I love ranch dressing but hate the store bought stuff, this tastes like when you’re out at a restaurant. Thanks for the recipe!

Couldn't be easier to make, and is delicious! I felt it really did taste fresher than the store-bought kind. It's well-seasoned and not too overpowering. A good staple item to have in your fridge!

Delicious!
Definitely make it hours before eating or better yet, the night before. I followed the recipe exactly, even though I read reviews but all I added was an extra 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder (personal preference). 
Now I'm ready to wow my friends!

Good base recipe. Made it as is and was tasty but too thick and more like dip than dressing. So, I added a tablespoon dry buttermilk, juice from a lemon, and some filtered water. Tastes even better now and is the right consistency.

This has become my go-to dressing! Great on keto-friendly salads. I do thin it out with a couple of tablespoons of water, and I add a tablespoon of vinegar to tang up the flavor.

In my opinion, the easiest way to make this is to put all of the ingredients into  smoothie or protein drink shaker with the little metal mixer ball in in it. Screw on the lid, make sure the pouring spout cap is snapped on tightly, shake well and you've got this delicious ranch dressing!

Super easy to make and it takes no time at all. I go just a bit more on the spices to exaggerate the flavor but either way it tastes great. It is very thick so keep that in mind.

I made it “as is” the first time, and it was fabulous. The second time, I substituted buttermilk for the sour cream, as per reviewers’ suggestions. Loved the flavour but found it a bit runny. Third time, I made it “as is” (but with fresh herbs) and *added* buttermilk until it was a consistency I liked. Bingo. People actually groan with delight and disbelief when they eat it. But no matter how you make it, substitutions or not, the recipe is a keeper.

This has been my standard ranch dressing.  The variations I use are a pinch of tarragon, about a Tbsp vinegar and about 2 Tbsp milk.  Friends have said it's the best they ever had (with and without my variations).

Ran out of my daughters favorite...  HVR dressing.  I bought fresh snap peas, beans and broccoli from the farm stand, and dipping in a vinaigrette just wasn’t going to cut it.  I had no chives, so I upped the onion powder by 1/4 teaspoon.  She’s devouring it, as I type.  Thank you...  I may never buy that bottled stuff again!

Exchanged sour cream for 2/3 C. buttermilk.  (It was a little to thick). I also added a little more of the herbs.

I subbed 1 PKG of cream cheese and a 1/4 cup of heavy cream to make this a keto friendly vegi dip/spread. Turned out fantastic. 
I would use either more cream or buttermilk or both to thin it down as a dressing.

This was a great recipe. I minced some sliced jalapenos that  you buy in the jar. Turned it into jalapeno ranch.  Better than bottled dressing or dip. I will definitely  be making  this again.

Great recipe!  I dislike the bottled dressings as they are too salty and expire before we can use them up.  I make up a bottle or container of the dry ingredients to have on hand and make smaller batches as needed.

I am in ranch heaven!! We quit buying ranch years ago because of all the added chemicals. I have tried numerous 'organic' flavors that I never bought again because I just couldn't get beyond the taste. But since I have been discovering just how many things I can make at home (think dry onion soup, again from this site!) i thought I would try this. And score!! We do double the garlic (just because Im a garlic lover) and use 3/4 cups of mayo (we never seem to let it set long enough before dinner to let the flavors meld) but I'm sure it's awesome even as originally wrote! Thank you, Dawnia!!!!!

10/10 will make again. Very thick consistency (figured I could add buttermilk if it was too thick, but this is perfect for dipping veggies in).  Literally the spoon stands upright, hah!

Modifications: Didn't have sour cream, substituted same amount of plain Greek yogurt.  Didn't have any parsley at all (whoops).

We have modified this to our preferences, but love the recipe even as written. We let the girls use a mortar and pestle to grind fine the parsley and chives, and then combine all dry ingredients in a lidded container so we can just measure out what is needed when it’s time for a new batch of dressing! (So we generally quadruple the recipe lol)

Had already whipped up Mayo/Sour Cream and a little touch of milk ( just a consistency preference) went to the spice cabinet and found I was OUT of my ranch dip mixes!  What!?!  Found your recipe and mixed it exactly as written.  Moral of this story:  I will never buy a mix again....who knew I could make my own that tastes as good if not even better and without all of the unwanted/added !  Yay!  Thank you Dawnia you literally saved my bacon with this recipe.

This is a great base recipe for ranch vegetable dip. As is, it's great,  I mainly use it for dipping vegetables and stuff in it. If you want a dressing like consistency for salad greens, use less mayo (or skip it) and just use sour cream and buttermilk. My husband and I like to add some Tabasco sauce or some cayenne pepper to it occasionally to give it a  it of bite, to change it up. Some days I'll add some fresh Lime juice and use an avocado in place of some of the mayo and the buttermilk to make Tex-Mex ranch.

I really love this easy ranch recipe. I used a splash of fresh lemon juice and fresh parsley and it was so good! It is thick, so will add a little milk for salads but much tastier than store bought!

Exactly what I’ve been searching for to have at home. Almost identical to one of my favorite restaurants! I did follow advice of another and used 1/2 cups of mayo/sour cream/buttermilk and added tsp vegetable oil for thinner consistency.

This, can be easily veganized, by using vegan mayo, (Just Mayo, Veganaise, etc.), vegan sour cream (Follow Your Heart), vegan "buttermilk" [plant based beverage {soy, oat, almond, rice, etc.} with lemon juice added].

I never add vinegar to anything, I just hate the taste of it. I add lemon juice instead, which adds tang and brightens the dressing up.     

I use Just Mayo vegan mayo, which I think is way too vinegary, so, I tried different things, to try and counter act it.   I tried adding a few tbs of  apple juice , and it worked!

One might also use pickle juice,  instead of apple juice, to counter act an overly vinegary taste, and use up pickle juice that most people just throw out, when the pickles are gone.

I tried green olive brine, as a diluter & salt additive, and it tones down the vinegar taste as well,  adds depth of flavor,  and uses up olive brine, that most people just throw away, when the olives are gone.

 So, there are many different ways one could tweak this recipe to their exact liking.  

   I cook cubed potatoes for potato salad, in the diluted olive brine, and they come out tasty. 

I cook pasta for pasta salad in diluted pickle juice, and it adds more flavor. 

  I just didn't like wasting a whole jar of pickle juice, and olive brine, so I tried to invent ways to use them up. 

One can also use pickle juice as the liquid in  meatloaf/veggie loaf.   

One can make a savory bread, by using it in place of water, when making bread dough, add some herbs to

I used sour cream and buttermilk, added a bit more of all the spices, and used fresh chives. I loved it! A couple of my tasters said it was missing tang so I added a bit of apple cider vinegar and they became super fans of this recipe!

I made it as listed but added a tablespoon of milk to thin it down. Others stated to used buttermilk instead of sour cream but I liked the flavor of sour cream. It was very tasty. I think the longer it sits the better it will be? I only let it sit for 15 minutes. Will definitely make it again. I love knowing what is in my dressing.

I made this for a baked chicken recipe,  came out yummy! I doubled the garlic and onion powder, added 1/2 teas tarragon. I also added some diced green chile. There is a local restaurant that makes a home made ranch dressing with green chile. This tastes just like it!

Wow....this is too easy and too good, I'm not huge ranch fan, but after making this version it is my dressing of choice! My only addition was adding a splash of buttermilk.

Delicious  I do ADD BUTTERMILK to this (makes it even more creamy combined with the mayo & sour cream).  And, I also add 2 teaspoons of LEMON JUICE.  Other than those two things, I do go by the recipe.  I really did enjoy this!  Thank you so much for sharing.  :-)

Wonderful ranch flavor for the spices. Tried it first with Miracle Whip—still good, but didn’t taste like ranch, too mayonnaisey. Tried it again with olive oil mayonnaise—huge improvement!  1/2 cup of mayo, 1/2 cup of plain Gk yogurt, 1/2 cup milk

This is really good. I sometimes double the seasonings because I like a lot of flavor but it's good either way. I also add a bit of cream if I want a thinner consistency. Thank you for sharing!

Finally a junk free (say anything I can’t pronounce) homemade ranch dip/dressing (depending if you’d like to add a bit of milk/buttermilk) that is just amazing! I’m letting my daughters all know about this one. YUM!

This is a wonderful recipe! Great flavors. Agree that you have to thin it out to use as dressing. Also substituted Greek yogurt for most of the mayo to make it healthier. Will definitely not buy store bought dressing after this! Yum!

I love making home made ranch. First I use a 1:1 ratio of  mayo and 2% GREEK YOGURT. I also add PAPRIKA (a couple dashes/pinch for a half recipe used tonight). I ALSO ADD a couple dashes of LEMON JUICE; it thins the mayo and greek yogurt (or sour cream - I have used that in the past too) and adds the zest the ranch needs.

I hate store bought ranch dressings, both bottled & flavor packets. I tried this recipe using some previous suggestions. Changes I made: 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup of the only brand of sour cream I like, added some Lemon juice to 1/2 cup skim milk to make like buttermilk, cut out 1/2 of the dill & added the vinegar (i love vinegar).  Tasting after preparing, I was ready to throw it away as I thought it tasted like a chip dip. Refrigerated it  & hours later I loved it. Used  a squeeze bottle for an even distribution on top of my grilled chicken taco salad. All the other eaters loved it also. I'll be using this often & making my chicken taco salads frequently  Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe using the adjustments Christy E. had suggested.  I didn't have onion powder so finely chopped a teaspoon of onions instead. The dressing was good but lacked something.  I'm not sure what but will make it again with onion powder and a dash of hot sauce to give it more umph.

Very tastey dressing. Only thing I changed was to double the garlic powder. Dressing was thick but that's what I wanted as I used it for the ranch dressing called for in 
Dill veggie tuna salad on this site.
 My leftovers were excellent as a dip for veggies.

I used only sour cream (no mayo, no buttermilk) for a dip.  I added a bit of salt, too, and a sprinkle of tarragon (I'm not sure what it did for it) and pinch cayenne.  Super easy!  No odd chemical taste like store-bought stuff.  Delish!

We have been searching for a "secret" ranch dressing recipe. This is as close as it gets. After much experimenting we finally figured out that ingredient! The garlic! Increase the garlic to 2 TB fresh garlic. I also add 1/8 cup water because we like it a little more runny than creamy. I also added fresh green onions instead of dried chives. Delicious!!!

I will never buy ranch dressing in a bottle again. I've made this recipe so many times I don't really even measure any more - just keep adding the herbs til it tastes right. I will say that the more fresh herbs you add instead of dried, the better it will be. And my preference is a bit thinner so I always end up adding milk. To make it a spicy ranch, I add ground cayenne and smoked paprika. To die for.

I have been looking for a good ranch dressing recipe for a long time.  I don't like store bought thick ranch, I like it a little more runny.  I did follow other reviewers advice on cutting the mayo down to 1/2 c. and adding 1/2 c. of buttermilk.  I also add about 1/4 tsp. of dry ranch dressing mix.  Amazing!!

Very good for raw veggies.  If using as a dressing, would have to thin it out a little with milk.  My daughter's friends love when she brings this to school because they all mooch off of her.  They told her "Your mom makes the best ranch!".  I usually divvy it up into 2oz. sample cups after making it so that it is easy to just grab for lunches.

I loved the recipe and I did use the buttermilk instead of the sourcream,  because I was using it for dressing. If I wanted it to be thicker as for a veggie dip I would use the sourcream . It was very tasty. I would make it again.

I love the flavor of this ranch dressing. I did make a couple of tweaks to fit my personal preference. For a salad dressing, it was very thick, so I added about 1/4 cup of buttermilk. I also doubled the garlic in it. Other than that, it is a fantastic recipe!

This dressing is wonderful. I've made this my go to ranch dressing recipe. I didn't change much; I just added a little milk and a little lemon juice to thin it out a bit. I love the dill in this. It gives it a fresh flavor. I double the recipe and put it in a large mason jar. No more store bought ranch dressing for me.

This is delicious. I substituted fat free Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also added some 1/2 & 1/2 and lemon juice because it was too thick of a salad dressing for me. It would be a great dipping sauce without the thinning agents. The spices were spot on.

I had to improvise and mix milk with cream of tartar in place of sour cream/buttermilk. The mayo tasted strong, but I think that was my doing. I'm definitely going to use this recipe again. It's perfect consistency and was very good as a dip for the fried mushrooms I made.

Very tasty dressing! I swapped regular mayonnaise for non gmo mayonnaise I found at Wal-Mart since the whole point of making it homemade was to avoid gmo.

This so so much better than the bottle version. I eat a lot more veggies and cabbage with this dip. It's flavor in burgers instead of mayonnaise is super and I use less cuz it's so full of flavor. I use it a lot.

Love it.  I changed the 1/2 C of sour cream to 1/3 C, and added 1/3 buttermilk.  Also added 1/4 teaspoon of tarragon, a little cayenne, and Worcestershire.

I made it as directed.  The best ranch dip I have ever tasted or made!  If I use it for salad dressing, I will take other's advice and thin out with milk/buttermilk.  
Thank you- I will never buy bottled ranch ever again!

Delicious! I made garlic parmesan wings from a recipe on Allrecipes. Great! I couldn't wait to dip them in ranch dressing. Looked in fridge and realized that the white bottle of dressing  (A) is blue cheese, not ranch and (B) expired a month ago. Crud!
Whipped this up pretty quickly. It's thick ,as is , so I added 1 cup buttermilk (made from heavy cream and vinegar, cuz i was batting a thousand tonight for ingredients). I also didn't have dried chives but it still tastes fantastic.

This is really good ranch dressing.  I add a little milk to make it thinner for salad, but it works great as is for a veggie dip.

Pretty good. Our family loves ranch so we used this as a dip tonight for red peppers and home made  chips, it would have been a little thick for salad I think. I followed another reviewers suggested and added a bit of veg oil. The flavor was good, the other thing that I changed was I added fresh parsley bc thats what I had on hand. Will use again and probably tweak to the consistency I like, definitely  useful for a good start.

Had dried shallots instead of chives and used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. Hubby and I both loved it as a dip.

DELICIOUS!!! I followed the recipe, but used 1 tsp garlic powder. (I love garlic!) It is a thick dressing, perfect for dipping!!!  As previous people have stated, you may want to thin it out with buttermilk if using for a salad.  I used it for a veggie tray and also to marinate chicken for a chicken, bacon, ranch, mozzarella cheese, crescent roll wrap and they were amazing!!   Everyone LOVED the ranch and asked for the recipe! I will never go back to store bought ranch again!!!

This is wonderful dressing. I love it as written, but I've found that substitutions work too. The other day, I started making this dressing and realized I was low on mayo and had no dill, so I substituted more sour cream to replace the missing mayo and (reluctantly) used Italian seasoning in place of the dill, expecting to be disappointed. Well, the dressing turned out rather delicious, despite the changes. Try this dressing, is what I'm saying. You'll be glad you did!

This is an awesome ranch dip/dressing. Made it just as stated in recipe and loved it. Even my husband liked it. The second time I made it I omitted the garlic and onion powder and added Mrs. Dashes southwest seasoning and it was great.

I have made this several times and I we love it!  I use Plain Greek yogurt in stead of Sour Cream and reduce the mayo slightly (I am a trial and error cook (why I don't bake).  I also add a teaspoon of Dijon Mustard and a 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil and a splash of apple-cider vinegar.  Double the recipe so you can store it in the coldest part of your refrigerator (good on steamed veggies too)!

This is a great Ranch Dip, too thick for salad in my opionion.  So for the dressing i thinned it out with buttermilk about 1/3 cup or so.  Fabulous!

This is BY FAR the BEST ranch dressing ever. I read reviews and the  thing I did differently  was ( at the suggestion of others) add  2% milk and vinegar because I didn't have the buttermilk. Some reviewers said they would never buy ranch from the store again and I'm with them. I taste it right after I made it and I said; This is delicious, so  I let my 9 year old taste and he said  this is better than delicious and better than Hidden Valley and I couldn't agree more. No more on the shelf ranch for us. I told my sister it's so good I may take it with me to restaurants if I know the ranch is not that great. If I could give it 10 stars I would!!!!

I like the light taste, especially used as a dip for buffalo chicken wings.  I've made it twice, once with sour cream and once with buttermilk and both are very good.

This was amazing! I haven't been able to eat ranch dressing in so long. I veganized it a bit by using a brand of mayo called "Just Mayo"(tastes exactly like hellmans mayo) and substituted almond milk with a squeeze of fresh lemon in place of the sour cream because I wanted a buttermilk effect. The almond milk made it a touch too watery so I added an extra 1/2 cup of mayo. Thank you so much for posting this recipe.

I used for Sue's Taco Salad on this site. I wanted to use what I had on hand as well as make it healthier. I didn't need to make so much so I used 1/4 c light mayo, 1/4 c Fage Greek yogurt and 1/4 cup homemade Kefir milk. Adding to this 1/4 t garlic powder and dill weed. Good flavor and made a nice topping for the taco salad.

Absolutely great, it's as good as ranch gets. I doctored it a little bit for my purposes: decreased the mayo:sour cream ratio to make it lighter and (relatively) healthier and added a few teaspoons of milk to make it runnier for pouring over salads (it was too thick otherwise for that purpose). Great recipe though!

Excellent taste, I really love the flavor of all of the spices combined and it really does taste like ranch!  If you want dressing you need to replace at least half of the sour cream with buttermilk otherwise it's very thick and more like a dip. I have also made this recipe as a veggie dip but instead of using the mayo and sour cream I used plain Greek yogurt and it was amazing, just another way to prepare this recipe but as written this recipe is still great!

Oh my. Perfect. Light and refreshing taste. Nicely balanced flavors. 

*Followed reciped exactly:  It was a dip. 
*Added 1 c. buttermilk:  It is a dressing for salad.

This recipe as is ... is perfect.

Also, I look forward to playing with alterations mentioned in other comments. I.e., adding a touch of vinegar. Half and half instead of buttermilk. I might read more comments to see if I find more fun add-in suggestions.

Based on other reviews, I used 1/2 cup sour cream, mayo and buttermilk. Increased salt to 1/4 tsp. I did not have dill weed and perhaps this explained the lack of "punch" but overall very good. Will continue to experiment to please the home crowd.

Came out perfect but I thinned it out with buttermilk, and instead of using garlic powder I used garlic salt and omitted the extra salt, tastes JUST like the restaurants! The buttermilk was Deans low fat and the salt was Lawry's with the parsley in it. Also I've been making Ranch dressing for about a year now and sometimes it tastes way too much like mayo but I've learned it tastes best with Kraft Real Mayo, I can't taste it at all, as for other reviewers almost every single recipe I've seen has 1C. mayo and 1/2 C. sour cream, ranch is supposed to have a strong sour cream taste, and yes for dressing you need buttermilk or it will be dip lol.

It was pretty good. I didn't have sour cream, so I used plain yogurt and thinned it out with milk. My daughter loved it.

I didn't make any changes with the ingredients but did cut the recipe in half.  I will never buy ranch dressing again.

My family and I  LOVE this recipe! This has become our go to recipe instead of buying store bought/processed/GMO ranch. I love that it takes no time at all to make! We buy the Just Mayo since organic is hard to find where we live. I do add milk to thin it out. I just add enough to make the consistency I like. I have made this for family before and they were shocked that I made this and it didn't come from a bottle!

I can't believe I've been stupid enough to buy the  packets of ranch mix when the recipe is so easy! I recently moved and am building my kitchen so was forced to make changes. I substituted a cup of lowfat yogurt for the sour cream, doubled the garlic powder because I didn't have onion powder and used a half teaspoon of Herbs de Province because that's all I had in the way of herbs. Soooo much  better than any ranch I've had in the past!

This was too thick for a dressing, more of a dip. I thinned it with milk and that was fine. It was very mayonnaisey, which I didn't care for. Also, not much flavor till I doubled the spices and added salt and soy sauce, then it was  alright. Won't make again.

I made this for the first time, and made a few changes. First I used Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, I skipped out on the chives altogether, I ran out of dill so I used dill pickle juice but turned out great.

As written it is totally bland, but the combination of spices is very good. It  tastes WAY better the next day, I don't even recommend serving it the first day. It lasted about a month the first time I made it and did not go bad. 

Now I've adjusted the measurements and it  is DELICIOUS. I make my own buttermilk using lemon juice (I tried it with vinegar and the lemon tastes better for this dressing) then I add 1/4 cup mayo and 3/4 cup non-fat Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream).   I double all the spices and add even more to taste. 

Now its a healthy, thick, ranch that  does not taste overwhelmingly like mayo. i realize I made a lot of adjustments to the recipe but  its the spice blend that keeps me coming back to this one. My favorite way to eat it is as a bbq ranch salad!

Better with equal parts mayo, sour cream and buttermilk plus extra seasoning. Fresh chives taste better than dried.

I made a double-and-a-half recipe. I also used buttermilk to substitute sour cream. It wasn't as thin as I liked, so I added about 1/4 cup more buttermilk and 1/4 more water too.  It has turned out to be a great homemade dressing. If you want a ranch dip, then follow the recipe verbatim.

This recipe should be subtitled, "How to Trick a Kid Into Eating Their Veggies" dip.  I feed 50+ kids every Friday.  They come from a background that doesn't provide much variety in foods, but I try to provide veggies for them every week (to widen their palate, somewhat).  The only way they eat raw veggies is with some kind of "ranch" dressing.  I had a lot of sour cream left over from another recipe and needed something to include it so it wouldn't go to waste.  This is the best recipe and I have since used it just about every week for my own use!  I use a little more sour cream than mayo because, to me, I prefer a less "mayo" taste.  But those little munchkins ate all their veggies and came back for more.  ; )  Kudos to the chef!

This was fantastic. Made it just as directed and it came out great. I didn't have time to chill it the first time and it was still great. Made it for my kids and they all requested a gallon(!) to take home.

I make HUGE amounts of the seasoning mix and store it in an air tight container.  Lasts forever.  When I'm ready to make dressing, I shake up the container really well to mix all the seasonings together.  I use about 1 tablespoon of the mix to about 2 cups of liquid.  Use whatever combination of mayo, sour cream, buttermilk,  milk, etc. that you prefer.  Definitely a keeper!

Very nice recipe for Ranch, and living in Australia you won't find a Ranch dressing on supermarket shelves that's anything like the Hidden Valley Ranch I remember from thirty years ago.
Following are the modifications I made:
I used 1/2 cup each of mayo, sour cream, and buttermilk.  Doubled the garlic powder and salt.  Added 1/4 tsp of paprika and 1/4 tsp. of Worcestershire sauce.  The remaining ingredients remained the same.

Made this with the following changes based on other reviews:

Added 1/2 cup whole milk
Used twice the amount of garlic and onion powders
Omitted the dill
Added 1/2 tsp. vegetable oil

This came out like restaurant ranch.

This is my go to ranch dressing. I use low fat mayo and low fat sour cream and extra pepper, it's perfect for salads, veggies and buffalo wings! Everyone will love this and want the recipe.

It was ok. Definitely better for dipping vegetables vs. using on salad. My dressing was very thick. I also had to double all of the herbs to get the taste that I wanted.

My apology, Dawnia, for not doing this a long time ago.   I just made it (again) and realized I had not rated it.  I first tried it in 2008.  This recipe has become a staple in our home.  It's perfect as written.  Thank you so much for posting it!

I love this. It tastes like Hidden Valley ranch dip more than the salad dressing, which was a pleasant surprise. I love it so much. And it's so easy too. I made it exactly as written and it only took a few minutes.

I made it just as the recipe stated and loved it!  It was quick and easy and I will never buy bottled again!   It is easy to adjust if you want to spice it up or give it a slightly different taste.  (I added Italian seasoning to one batch.) However, for a basic, simple Ranch, I felt the proportions of the ingredients were spot on.

I have made this dressing multiple times now. It tastes great. Store bought ranch dressings contain a lot of unwanted ingredients (such as soybean or canola oil), but I can make this healthy from scratch. Thanks alot!

This is a great staple recipe! we made it exactly per recipe using homemade mayo and it was very good!  We ate it all in a few days!  recently, we made it with plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, went heavy on the seasoning/herbs, and added about 1/8 tsp tarragon.   And this version was fabulous!!!

A very good recipe that's easy to adjust to personal taste. I took the recommendations to use 1/2 mayo and 1/2 cup buttermilk. I thought it was great!

This was the first time I made Ranch Dressing from scratch...
Mmmm...scaled it way down and didn't have dried chives. I completely agree about how much better it tastes than store bought bottled ranch.  Why do I make homemade Caesar dressing without a thought but not Ranch? Not anymore.  :):

This is the only recipe I use for ranch. I don't buy store-ranch anymore. What I do slightly different is use 2 cups mayo, 3/4 cups sour cream, 1/4 cup water then double the seasonings. Makes a good family-size amount (salads, tacos, dip for fries, veggies and chicken strips, etc.).

I think this is FAR to mayo tasting .   We added parm cheese and it was better.   Thankfully we made it for a dipping sauce for chicken tenders, it was ok for those.

Our family has multiple food allergies.  I recently found a milk, egg, soy-free mayo substitute, and love this recipe.  I've made it way too many times in the last few weeks!  I'm still tweaking the spice ratios to get it just right for my taste buds, but this is a really good start.

As is it's a perfect DIP.  For a salad dressing increases the spices/herbs a bit to your liking and add some milk to desired consistency!

Fantastic, I used creme fraiche instead of sour cream, doubled the garlic powder and added a dash of virgin olive oil.

I'm not sure if I have ever reviewed a recipe on this site because I think everyone has different tastes for everything. I was looking for a ranch dressing recipe to go with some leftover wings I made from this site. I made this recipe exactly as is (using the buttermilk) and wow, I am truly blown away with the taste. I may never buy HVR again! Kudos to Dawnia for bringing this excellent restaurant version of ranch to my kitchen! :)

My husband and I loved it. I am not sure I can ever go back to bottled dressing again. I agree with other reviewers that sourcream should be used for a dip and buttermilk for a dressing. The sourcream made a good, but thick dressing.

It's a great recipe. Add to this about 1/2 cup of buttermilk for a little more tang and a reduced consistency. Thanks Dawnia.

Thank you for this recipe. I'm going to a dinner party tonight at some new friends house. I was asked to bring a garden salad. I want to make a good impression. I replaced the sour cream with buttermilk, and added 1/2 teaspoon of vegetable oil. I doubled the recipe and it taste perfect.

I found this tastes more like a dill dressing than a ranch dressing. I used it on salad but I think it would be better used as a dip for veggies.

Good recipe, I like to use fresh parsley, dill and chives.  I always add extra dill because I like it that way.
I also add some buttermilk to thin it out.

I found the dressing to have a heavy mayonnaise flavor. I also Took the tips from another review which resulted in a heavy garlic flavor as well.

So good... so very, very good.  I have been buying the expensive ranch dressing in the refrigerated section of the produce department at my grocery store, and the price keeps climbing. This is much more economical and tastes better.  It was a little thick for salad dressing, so I mixed in approx. 1/4 cup of skim milk and it was perfect.  My "go to" recipe from now on.  Don't forget to give it some time for the flavors to meld... definitely an important step in this recipe. Thanks Dawnia!

This recipe is delicious & easy to make! The dressing was tasty on a mustard greens salad with bell peppers, fresh herbs & garlic. This recipe also, makes a great dipping sauce for wings, mozzarella sticks & veggie sticks. I will only make this from now on if I want ranch dressing.

Very Good - a little thick for my taste so I added some milk to make it the consistency I wanted.  I also added more salt to our liking which brought it up to maybe 1/4 teaspoon or just a little under.

Thicker than Hidden Valley out of a bottle. You can really taste the dill weed and can certainly tell it is mayo based. Overall I really like it and will certainly make it again!

YUM!  I just whipped up a half a batch to give it a try. Tastes just like the dry package mix that is the taste we all identify with.  Also tastes just like what you get in a restaurant.  I did use fresh green onion (minced) and fresh parsley (fine).  I didn't have the dried chives on hand and needed to use up my fresh parsley.  Also added water a 1/2 TBLS at a time until I came up with the dressing consistence I was looking for.  It comes up very thick as written, more of a dip. I'll try with the dried next time to see how it works that way. We'll see if it rates a 5 that way =)

This turned out really good. As one other reviewer wrote, I added some buttermilk which made all the difference. I halved the recipe and added 1/4 cup buttermilk that I made from scratch (milk and lemon).

I was surprised at how delicious this Ranch dressing is because I don't like mayonnaise based anything - but this was amazing!  As is, the recipe is quite thick - suitable for using as a vegetable dip.  I thinned it down by adding cream until it became the consistency I wanted for a salad.  There was no need to adjust the spices.  It turned out perfectly.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I tried this recipe and loved it!  Based on other reviews I swapped out the sour cream for buttermilk and for personal preference omitted the salt and was fantastic!  I was leery about the dill weed, but I really think this truly made this recipe.  Will use again and will use sour cream for dipping fresh veggies.

I had gotten some free sour cream last week or so and wasn't about to let it go to waste, but didn't know what to do with it. I've never made homemade salad dressing before, but let me tell you I've never eaten my salad that fast! I used extra onion because I didn't have chives, made a few other to-taste adjustments of the final product, and it turned out great!

This has become my go-to ranch recipe. Sometimes, I add a little milk to thin it, and use a crushed garlic clove for the garlic powder. Thank you for sharing this great recipe!

i like a creamy tangy ranch dressing and this needed alot done for my taste. I added worchestershire sauce about 1tbs, 1 tsp vinegar and bumped up.salt and buttermilk. I made both mayo and buttermilk from scratch which really gave the recipe a clean tast. I came to realize it gets better over time (the taste).

This recipe was so easy and quick! And so much better than the bottle stuff. I changed a few things it improvise with what I had available in my pantry and fridge and it was fabulous. Added fresh crushed garlic, fresh green onions, didn't measure anything but used less sour cream and mayo and made my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar and added it to thin it out. Added the other dried herbs salt and pepper to taste. Perfecto!!! Never buying that bottle stuff again. Thank you!!

One day, all my husband and I had available for lunch was stuff for a salad. I wanted to spruce it up a bit, so I decided to look for some homemade ranch dressing, as we almost always bought ranch from the store. I really can't say enough how happy I am that I did...I now won't even buy store-bought stuff anymore. I got so spoiled on this stuff! It's AMAZING just as it is...however, over time, I made just a small change to make it a little more liquid-y (since we always have it on our salads)--I use a 1/4 cup sour cream and a 1/4 cup buttermilk, instead of the 1/2 cup sour cream. This makes it a little more spreadable, but we also do like the thickness, so the sour cream works out great. Thanks so much to whoever submitted this!

Super yummy! I have just gotten back to making everything from scratch because of health issues. I can use vegan mayonnaise, and no one in my household can tell the difference. In fact, it tastes super fresh! Love it!

Finding myself suddenly out of bottled ranch,  I came across this recipe. I did not have the dill or chives available. I don't care for dill anyway but the chives definitely would have added to this! I thought it was REALLY mayonnaise-y and so I added 1/4 C more sour cream and more herbs/spices and it helped but I could still not get over the overpowering mayonnaise taste. I read some of the reviews and added a tsp. of white vinegar which helped. I will make this again but I will halve the mayo.

This by far is so much better than bottled dressing. My husband who doesn't normally use ranch but does oil and vinegar raved about how good it was.  I enjoyed it too and will make it again. Our daughter, sadly she likes the other kind. ( I am thinking may be the dill, will try again for her without it).  Based on earlier reviews I used mayo, s. cream, and homemade buttermilk substitute (milk and vinegar).  I served it as a drizzle on Buffalo Chicken lettuce wraps, I used the same spice mixtures of the ranch with a spoonful of sour cream on the boneless chicken cut up pieces as I sauteed them in olive oil. - it was amazing on the chicken, Can't wait to eat the leftovers tomorrow! I will definitely make this dressing again.

It's fine if u don't refrigerate, I forgot to and it's fine. It's good although there is way to much mayonnaise, I'd go with half of he amount of mayo. All I can taste is the mayo... Sorry

Awesome! I'm never buying a bottle of ranch again! The first time I made this I followed the recipe as is and it is thick but full of flavor. The next time I made it I followed the suggestion of some other reviewers and added 1 tbsp lemon juice to thin it out just a little and it is perfect! Thank you for this amazing recipe=)

Perfect. Used 1/2 mayo 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 heavy cream because that is what I had. Next time I will use buttermilk but heavy cream worked fine. Also used 2tsp fresh chives. Yum!

Have been doing Creamy Ranch Dressing for many years.  The one I make has a 1/4cup of milk in it. It is the most delicious.  The consistency is not runny like the store bought type. It keeps very well for weeks.

So easy. We loved it! Even my husband who is a great cook! I was out of a few ingredients and wanted to lower the calories. I substituted low fat plain yogurt for sour cream, fresh parsley for dried and added extra garlic salt and onion salt. I added a third of a cup of buttermilk to thin out the consistency. This is the first time I have added a review/changes on Allrecipes.com and did so because I have benefited from others adaptations so often.

I have made this recipe several ways. I tried the original recipe (well nearly, I omitted the garlic - allergic) and then dry versions. My favorite is adding 1/4 c dry buttermilk, doubling the dill, and omitting the garlic again. I use the dry like a ranch packet for potatoes, chicken, pork, etc., and have also added some of the dry to sour cream for a veggie dip. Very good and simple.

I think this recipe is wonderful.  I've been looking for the Holy Grail of ranch dressings.  I have tweaked mine a bit but I won't review the actual recipe because I didn't follow it to the letter.  The only initial change I made was to double the garlic.  Once it chilled and the ingredients melded I found that it was a little lacking in salt, too thick, and if I used too much dressing it got bitter.  I added a half pint of buttermilk and an additional teaspoon of salt which ended up being a good consistency, too salty, and still bitter.  Added a spooge of Worcestershire sauce (some sugar for the bitter) and 1/2 t of ground black pepper (for the salt) and it's better but not perfect.

Next time I'll make as the recipe calls for it but try the 1:1:1 ratio of sour cream, buttermilk, and mayo.  I'll also not add extra garlic and will probably start with half the recommended herbs.  I buy my herbs at Penzey's and they're usually very fresh.  Sometimes because my spices are so fresh (I replenish all the time) they're too strong which is I think why it ended up bitter

Great recipe for a basic dressing. You can easily add other spices to make new dressings/dips. Add our fave pepper sauce for a spicy tex/mex dip. Double the Dill for dill dressing (that may be good for a quick Cucumber salad). Best advice I can give, let it rest at least 30 min before you add flavors, the dry spices need to bloom and release flavors.

It does have all the preservatives in it because of the mayo.  :) Would use greek yogurt instead of sour cream as well.

Huge hit with the wife and kids (me too :-) ). It is definitely a ranch dip...swap the sour cream for buttermilk for a salad dressing. Also, I used the spices as purely a ratio guide between the spices and upped the qty for our family's taste (about 1.5x). Excellent base recipe.

I ran out of ranch and decided to try this recipe.  Wow, this was better than I was expecting.  I didn't have any dill weed handy so I used Basil instead and it came out pretty tasty.  I'll be making this again.

I am not buying bottled Ranch dressing again. This recipe is better than bottled and most importantly, does not contain all the chemicals and preservatives. This is so easy to make with ingredients I always have at home! Thank you for sharing!!!

I have been making ranch dressing almost exactly the same as this ... the only thing different for me (and less calories) is I use 1 pt. mayo, 1 pt. buttermilk, 1 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp. pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and 1 Tbl. dried parsley....try it I am sure you will like it too.

I tried it using greek yogurt and buttermilk.  Next time I will try with the suggested buttermilk, mayo, sour cream combo.  I used season salt, dill mix and garlic pepper mix.  Because of the ingredients I did not use much onion powder and no additional garlic powder.  I did add chives as it called for.  With the yogurt it was not as thick as I like for a dip, but worked well on salad.  Thanks Dawna and others!

I used 1 cup sour cream to 1/2 cup mayo (I use the canola mayo). The sour cream flavor was what I was wanting, the mayo adds the tang. I added all the seasoning as the recipe calls. It is definitely the best tasting chip and veggie dip I've had. My husband is allergic to soy and have not found a store dip that isn't chalked full of soy/ msg.

Fantastic! I'm temp in Australia and every Ranch I try is "Sweet".  I was unable to use Mayo because it too is sweet as a standard.  I just stuck with sour cream and it was excellent!  After 8 months without a decent Ranch I am thrilled!  Thank You!

Exactly what I was hoping for as a veggie dip! I used one 5.3 oz container of plain nonfat Greek yogurt, and an equal amount of mayo. I didn't have dill the first time I made it, so I subbed an extra 1/2 tsp of chives. I love garlic so I generally add more than called for, and it's simply perfect!

This is a very tasty dressing.  My husband loves this creamy type of dressing to mix with Italian dressing--a throwback to a taste he loved many years ago.  Thanks very much for this easy-to-make salad dressing, DAWNIA.

This recipe hands down is the best I have come across. My daughter raves about it. For those of you who think the mayo will be too overpowering, I found after the herbs had a chance to "marry" for a few hours it tasted much better, and the next day its even better!  I like my ranch dressing a little thinner, so I added a few splashes of milk to mine. Great recipe!

This is like the best dressing I have ever made. I used 1/2 cup sour cream, buttermilk, and mayo plus used extra garlic powder. I made it two days in advance and it was delicious. DAWNIA you the best for sharing this recipe.

It was pretty good as is, but just not quite what I was looking for. I wound up doubling all of the ingredients except the mayo, and that made it excellent.

I have used this recipe for years. I teach Senior High foods.  Students LOVE this ranch.  I use equal amounts of mayo and sour cream. I make it the night before serving. Simply the best; I have it available in the fridge all year long for carrots and dip.

An easy ranch dressing that uses ingredients I usually have on hand. I subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream. It makes a great dip but needs to be thinned a bit for dressing.

It is a MUST to refrigerate for a good while before eating. Immediately after preparation, the dill is the only herb/spice that really comes through. My husband and I thought it was acceptable, but not amazing. The next day, it was outstanding - the best ranch dressing either of us has ever had. 

Changes: Instead of sour cream, I used 2 tbsp of buttermilk powder and enough water to get to my preferred consistency, which was far less than half a cup. The second time I made it, I added thyme and chipotle powder and it was even better.

Pretty good.  Not quite "it" but all in all everyone enjoyed.  I used less mayo and more sour cream/buttermilk to cut the overpowering flavor that mayo can have.

Super easy and way better than store bought ranch!  I didn't have sour cream, so I just used plain Greek yogurt instead, super yummy.  I didn't have chives or dill, which I'm sure makes it taste even better.  I'll be picking some up for when I make my next batch.

Very good recipe.  The consistency is perfect for dip but is a little thick for my liking as a salad dressing, so I added a little milk and fresh lemon juice since I didn't have buttermilk and it turned out perfectly.  Definitely beats store bought bottled dressing any day!

This is amazing! I used buttermilk to make dressing rather than dip. It's delicious, the kids loved it, my husband loved it, I loved it. Will definitely make this again.

Only one "gripe", this is the only food I've ever encountered that LOSES flavor with time. I put it in the fridge overnight, thinking the flavor would intensify, but nope, when I took it out the next day, it tasted kinda bland. So be prepared to season some more the next day.

OMG this is good! We added blue cheese chunks to it and it was to die for. Excellent with carrots, and absolutely amazing with onion rings. I love ranch, but man this is so much better than the bottled stuff.

Very good.  I used real mayonnaise - you know egg yolks and oil beaten together.  Didn't have any problems.  Salt and pepper is a matter of personal taste.

Instead of mayo and sour cream, I used silken tofu, lemon juice and a splash of unsweetened soymilk. Vegan, low fat, creamy and has protein. Fabulous!

I whipped this up at the last minute when I realized I had no salad dressing to go with our dinner salad. I made the buttermilk version. It only had about two hours in the fridge for the flavors to marry before we served it. Our guest were raving about how great the dressing was.
Second review: 8-14-13, I made this again with the sour cream since out of buttermilk, it was a bit thick after a couple hours in the fridge, but a bit of milk mixed in thinned it down. It was still very good.

Straightforward with minimal prep and minimal cleanup.  I added a bit of sweet paprika to get a little color in the mix without seeming 'hot.'  Also, used frozen dill, which was a mistake.

I realized after mixing 1 cup may and 1 cup buttermilk that I couldnt find the ranch dressing mix I had bought so I found this recipe and put the spices together and added it to my mayo/buttermilk and it turned out awesome!  I will be using this from now on.

Great recipe to avoid the processed and preservative-laden store-bought kind.  I found the initial mix to be too thick (more dip-like), and so whisked in buttermilk until it got to the right consistency for us.

What is with the onion and garlic powder. Since this is usually paired with other fresh veg. I recommend making the mayonnaise from scratch and using all fresh ingredients. Forget the fact that it is healthier it just tastes a lot better.

I love love love this ranch recipe! It's even better with fresh herbs.  If you use fresh herbs, make sure to add more than what's called for in the recipe.  Yummy!

This is what I have been looking for!!  We go through a lot of ranch in our household, and I have been trying to find a homemade mix that is as good as the packaged, preservative laden kind that I buy at the store.  This is so good!!  Thanks a million!!  I didn't have chives on hand, so i doubled the onion powder and it was very tasty.  I will be getting chives on my next shopping trip so i can try the recipe exactly as written.

I made this one, Great dressing for chips, I did add 1/2 cup buttermilk to thin it. Still pretty thick with the buttermilk added. Little more buttermilk help to pour it from a bottle. The best recipe I have made today. My family loves it. Making a double dose of this only last 3-4 days in our home. Salad's, Chips and Crackers are enjoyed with it.

I liked it alright, but it needed more oomph. Tripled the garlic and onion salt. Doubled the dried herbs. Used buttermilk, sour cream, and reduced the mayonaise. This is the way it works for my family for salad dressing.

1st ranch I have tried to make and loved it! I did use vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream because it is what I had on hand. I think I will continue to make it that way it was so much BETTER than the store bought stuff!!!

Better and healthier than those bottled ranch!  I don't think it's really a huge inconvenience to make this, and it's definitely worth the extra 10 minutes to prepare.  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I substituted where I had to.  Plain yogurt for the sour cream.  Fresh parsley for the dried.  Grated real garlic instead of powdered.  I omitted the chives and powdered onion since I didn't have any.  I prepared the dressing at least 1 hour before serving so the flavours can all blend together.

This is very good.  Tastes way better than bottled.  It is a bit thick so could thin with milk.

Changes I made- First, I make the Whole Egg Mayo from this site, then I proceed with this recipe- I skip the sour cream and chives (because I never have those on hand) and I use fresh parsley. YUM! It's great as a veggie dip or salad dressing.

WOW!! Best Ranch Dressing I've eaten, either homemade or commercial. I didn't have any parsley flakes so used celery flakes instead. This was the only change I made. The blended flavors are fabulous. Thanks for a great recipe.

I've been looking for a simple ranch recipe, and this fit the bill. I made it with buttermilk instead of sour cream, and substituted 1 tbsp fresh herbs for the dried. A few hours after I made it, it was good. The next day, it was awesome. Definitely let it sit overnight.

When I first made this, it was good... but I wished I had doubled the liquid part of the recipe.  As it is written now, it covers about half of the cucumbers and onions.... and that's if you only used a couple cucumbers.  The flavors meld into a tastier dish, if you make this, put it in the fridge and don't use it until the next day.

I thought this was an excellent recipe with the sour cream as I don't care for buttermilk. The only thing I changed was the dill, I left it out. I put in a little extra garlic powder, and my grandson loved it!

This was kind of bland and WAY too thick  to actually be salad dressing.  It seems that you should start out with the buttermilk, maybe half and half with sour cream?

Awesome recipe!  So simple!  I made this exactly to the directions (with sour cream), and I wouldn't change a single thing!  I used this to dip chips and buffalo wings.

This is great.  I used buttermilk instead of the sour cream and left out the chives as I didn't have any.  I also substituted tarragon for the dill weed (I didn't have any of that either.  Still was great.

A wonderful blend of flavors!  This dressing is thick, so it seems to me more like a dip and not a salad dressing.  I used it to make the Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabob recipe and it was super!  A very tasty recipe worth making.

I was looking for a home made ranch dressing recipe and this fit my needs perfectly.  I used low-fat buttermilk in place the the sour cream.  I didn't have garlic powder, so substituted garlic salt and omitted the salt.  I whipped this up in my food processor since I had it out.  I think that next time I may try to make this with home-made mayonnaise so that I can totally get rid of any preservatives in the mayo.  Thanks Dawnia for sharing!

I made this recipe with the mayo/buttermilk for salad dressing and it did have a strong dill flavor as others said. Luckily I love dill, but it was not the ranch flavor I was looking for. Still delicious!

Serving size - reduced to 6 (US). Subbed buttermilk for sour cream (didn't want it to be that thick). Doubled the garlic as advised on here = too strong. I really like garlic, but this was a lot. I also like dill, but it overwhelms the final product.Will probably halve the amount next time. Overall I still like this recipe.

I was just put on a low carb/low salt diet and this is just perfect.  I traded the sour cream for buttermilk and left out the salt and FELL IN LOVE!

I wanted to drink the leftovers out of the jar.  :P

Awesome recipe! 
Wife took the salad dressing to work with her, so I had to improvise, never made it before.. Dang was this gooooood.. I did not have dill weed, and it was still good without it! Made it like the recipe, just thinned it with milk to consistency I wanted.. Without thinning it would be great dip! Saving this for the future, way better than store bought.

I'm not a ranch person, so we never have it on hand. My husband wanted some last night when he was making fried chicken, and I found this recipe. Super easy, and he said that it was "legit," and I could serve it in a restaurant. Since he has probably ordered ranch at every restaurant he's ever been to, I think I'll keep this recipe on hand! Thank you so much for sharing!

This was pretty good. I used homemade mayo that was made with olive oil, so there was a very distinct flavor. I also subbed greek yogurt for the sour cream. Will definitely add a touch of buttermilk as others suggested. Very yummy!

Very good. I followed the advice of others and used 1/2 cup each buttermilk, ranch, and mayo. Next time I will up the seasonings a bit. Even after a day in the fridge, it still isn't quite as seasoned as I would like, but still better than any bottled dressing you can find. With a little more tinkering, this will be the ranch dressing recipe for us. Thanks!

Very tasty but way too much Mayo for me. I cut it with a little milk. Next time I will use half mayo, half sour cream.

This is similar to a Ranch Dressing I created. The main difference is I add a piece of peeled, grated cucumber and use a small blender. The cucumber gives it the 'cool' ranch flavor.

I am lactose intolerant and I substituted Tofutti Sour Supreme for the sour cream and it tastes great.  This is a great recipe that tastes good with my (baked) sweet potato fries!

Good base recipe, used fresh herbs-parsley, chives and basil, skipped onion and garlic powder, added 1/2 cup milk to thin out as used for a pasta salad.

Like many here, I altered this recipe a bit. For the base, I use 1 c mayo, 1/2 c buttermilk (lowfat is fine), and 1/4 c sour cream. (I did go 1/2 lite mayo and 1/2 c regular mayo to cut down on the fat and didn't notice a difference in taste from the 1 c whole mayo). For the herbs, I use fresh chives, dill, parsley, and crushed garlic in a jar rather than the dried herbs recommended in the recipe. I am very liberal with the dill and chives. I agree with others that it does taste better after some time in the fridge. I think time allows the oils in the herbs to leach out and blend with the base. I have been a ranch dressing fan my whole life, and have never been able to purchase or recreate the ranch found in many restaurants until now. Fantastic recipe :-)

This dressing is very tasty, and I usually don't like ranch dressing.  Only change I made is that I made my own mayo.  Superb way to get my kids to eat veggies.

Just mixed this and already it's the best I've tasted. Can't wait to try it after the flavors have melded. I did 3/4 cups of mayo, and 1/4 cup 2% milk, with the 1/2 cup of sour cream, and added a lid full of red wine vinegar. No onion powder but 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. Can't wait to have it on oven fries tonight. Thanks, this is just what I was looking for!

Fantastic Ranch recipe! I followed Christy's advice to use 1/2 cup each: buttermilk, sour cream (used sour lean), and mayo. I didn't add oil as some suggested, and found the consistency just right.

Very, very good!  Easy and using stuff you already have in the cupboard!  I made my buttermilk with lemon juice too so I didn't end up with the rest sitting in the fridge.

My husband loves ranch dressing to dip veggies in. Whipped this up in pinch when we ran out one night. I followed the recipe exactly. Loved it! I am not a fan of ranch dressing but I absolutely loved this one. I loved the fact that it was creamy and not vinegary. Bye bye bottled ranch dressing.

I don't know if I've ever commented on any recipes, but really wanted to on this one.  It was late and so hot I didn't feel like cooking so we decided on salad.  Then I realized we were out of Ranch.  Sooo happy to have found this super simple recipe.  I was anxious to eat so only waited 15 min at most, and still thought it was great.  Anxious to try after it sits the correct amount of time! :D  Thanks so much for this recipe.

I whipped this up and poured it over sliced cucumbers.  30 minutes later it was on the table and everyone LOVED it.  Now, when I give my son bottled ranch he says, "No, I want the good kind."  :)

Thanks, Dawnia!  This is fabulous!  I used the 1/2 cup version that some others had posted with mayo, sour cream & buttermilk, misread the garlic and put 1/4 tsp of the squeezable garlic instead of garlic salt, but all else is the same and it's just wonderful!    This recipe is definitely a keeper and one I'll be making from here on out!  This is a winner!  Thanks for sharing!

Wow!!!  I didn't measure anything and it was still a knockout!  I only had about 6oz of light sour cream.  So, that is the only wet ingredient that I used.  I added a little of all of the dry ingredients and it tasted just like ranch without being precise.  I also used fresh parsely b/c I didn't have dried. It turned out awesome despite all of the above :-)

I just forwarded the link for this recipe to my sister, so I thought I'd better review it.  This is a great recipe as is; I think my favorite thing is that you can get away with estimating amounts rather than measuring precisely.  I've been making this for over a year, and there are now a couple of changes I make, as a rule.  First, I use a ratio of 1/2 mayo to 1/2 sour cream.  For dip, I use sour cream, but for salad dressing I use regular fat yogurt.  It makes it pourable, but not too runny, and I'm glad for a new way to work some live cultures into my diet.

Awesome recipe, I was looking for a ranch with no MSG and other fillers and this one tastes wonderful, as well as cheap and easy to make! I added about 3/4 of a cup of buttermilk to thin it out and make it alittle softer.

The best homemade ranch! I did use just a little less sour cream, and added some buttermilk to compensate/thin it out. I feel like it would be super thick if made without some buttermilk. But delicious and so easy!!

Too much dill for me.  I will try it will less next time.  I also used less mayo and skim milk instead of sour cream.  Of course, that made mine too thin.  :)  Thanks so much for the starter!!

Absolutely delish! Alas I did not have buttermilk but I'll definitely have to try that next time! I added 1/4 tsp of garlic to what was already recommended as well as 1/2 tsp of vegetable oil as someone recommended and it's smooth as silk! This would be just as great as a potato salad dressing or a wings dip! Next time, I'll try adding a bit of chili powder or paprika for an added twist...:)

This was great! I eyeballed the measurements to make a 1/2 batch (I didn't want leftovers) and am very impressed. I've been making homemade vinegarette dressing for years, but had never tried ranch. This will be a new staple in my house. Thanks!

This recipe was a good base. I found it to be too much mayo, so I added an additional 1/2 cup of sour cream, and about a tbsp. of white vinegar.  I didn't have parsley, chives or powdered onion, and used herbs de provence in its place. Nice consistency for a dip. I will make this again.

I substitute 2/3 c milk + 1 T lemon juice for the sour cream. This adds a brightness to the flavor that I prefer over buttermilk and/or vinegar, and it's more pourable. Let this mixture stand for a few minutes before adding anything else. I increased the pepper and dill a bit, too. The family loves it. Thanks!

Made this exactly as written.  It's very thick, like a dip not a dressing, so I had to add a good amount of milk to thin it out.  It is good, but for my taste there is way too much dill in it.  Will make again but cut it to 1/4 teaspoon.  With those adjustments I think it would be a 4+ rating.

I followed it, without any modifications. I found it to be too thick, like a dip rather than a dressing.   This flavor of this dressing reminds me of sour cream and onion potato chip.  Still overall, I heart the flavor.  This recipe is a keeper! ;o)

I was looking for a recipe with no chemicals or MSG. This is very good. I made it with 1/2 cup Smart Balance Mayo, 1/2 cup fat free sour cream and 1/2 cup Buttermilk. I love the taste and consistency and to think it is only 25 calories per Tbsp. I will be making this from here on. My next thing to try is adding salsa. I love Salsa Ranch Dressing too.

Thanks for the great base for Ranch Dressing.  My husband loves Ranch and I won't buy the chemical stuff.   Your recipe is delicious.  Taste being subjective, I did go along with the 1/2 buttermilk, 1/2 sour cream, and 1/2 mayo...great consistency and flavor.  Upped the salt and garlic powder, and added 1 tsp apple cider vinegar as suggested by others.  I leave out the dried chives and parsley as I don't think much of them.  When I need Ranch Dressing, I just add in freshly chopped parsley and chives to my salad.  If I'm using it as a dip for other foods, I add them to the dressing at the last moment.  Everyone raves about it.

This dressing was not to my liking.  I was looking for a restaurant-like taste and this just reminded me of the bottled ones.  The dressing tasted just ok to me.

I will never buy store bought ranch dressing again. I did as others suggested and thinned it out a bit for salad dressing and added a little more garlic. My 11 year old loves salad now! Thanks!

This is wonderful, and the only way to eat this is to let it SIT IN THE FRIDGE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. AT LEAST overnight. 30 minutes wasn't enough in my opinion. It was wonderful though, the next night after I made it. I made it exactly as it instructed.

Delicious!  This is the only ranch that will be in our house from now.  I halved the recipe, just in case. Didn't have sour cream, so I subbed 1/3 c. buttermilk.  Also instead of 1/4 t. dried parsley, I only used 1/8 t.  Thank you.

I love this recipe!  the herbs make it taste so fresh! I am kind of a health nut, though, so I couldn't do the sour cream and mayo combo.  I combine equal parts mayo and Greek yogurt and that gives it a kick and keeps it more healthy.  If you don't have a taste for Greek yogurt you might not like it, it's more tangy, but very creamy!

This recipe was great but I had many changes.  I had 3/4 c. mayonnaise instead of a full cup, I added an extra 1/4 c. of sour cream.  I added 1/2 c. buttermilk and 1 tsp. lemon juice.  I easily doubled or even tripled the amount of garlic.  The recipe could have used more salt and pepper to taste.  This recipe was a great starting point for a great ranch dressing.

Delicious!  I like this dressing because it has a pronounced dill flavor, and I happen to love dill.  If you're not a huge fan of the herb, I would suggest using a little less.  I also made some changes like other readers: only 1/2 cup mayo, added 1/2 cup buttermilk, only 1/4 cup sour cream, upped the garlic powder to 1/2 tsp, and used celery salt in place of plain salt.  Soooo good!  5 stars with the changes I made!

This is the perfect ranch recipe!!!  I did change it just a little... I used buttermilk instead of sour cream, but added about 1/2 cup to make it a little runnier.  I also left out the onion powder, but added 1/2 tsp. season salt, and we didn't have any dill, so I put about 1/8-1/4 cup of dill pickle juice straight from the jar- and Oh My Goodness!  It is DELICIOUS!!!  Thank you so much!!  No more Hidden Valley for me!

This dressing is excellent, I can't stand fat free or reduced fat ranch dressings that you buy in the store.  For this recipe I followed the suggestions of 1/2 cup each of sour cream (fat free), Mayonaise (Helmens light) and reduced fat buttermilk.  I also used fresh parsley and chives instead of the dried.  I find especially with the chives that the dried version does not have very much flavor.  So I finely chopped four chives and added to the mixture.  I also added a couple of TBLs of skim milk to thin out the dressing.  I have made this recipe three times already, I will never buy ranch dressing in the store again!!

This was really yummy! My only complaint is that the dill was a tad overpowering, but I'll just add a little less dill next time. But all in all it's a winning dressing!

We use this recipe exactly as written for every party we have (kids' birthday or other) as a dip for veggies, and for whenever we want a good ranch salad dressing for dinner salad (dinner salad being the main course with some sort of chicken on top).  EVERYONE loves this recipe.  I tried it with fresh herbs - it's not the same.  It is IMPERATIVE that you BLEND this (I have a vitamix blender that does the trick quite nicely).  It makes the flavor so much better- as though it had already been sitting in the fridge for several hours mixing flavors.  I do not mess with the ratio of Mayo/sour cream; I simply do as called for in the recipe every time.  I've also tried it with buttermilk; not an addition I 'go to'.  Blend it; use dried herbs; use the Mayo/SourCream ratio as stated in the recipe.  You'll love it.  Especially with your Vitamix, if you have one.

I never ever considered making my own ranch dressing until this site. I somehow stumbled upon this recipe and decided to give it a try for my party last night. We used this for fried chicken wings and a veggie platter. It was a hit. Everyone was surprised that I made it from scratch. I really, really enjoyed this recipe. This one is a keeper. Thanks!

This recipe has helped cure my homesick cravings for ranch dressing. I personally like to double the garlic and black pepper, but it's wonderful as written too.

This is ok, but is lacking one key ingredient that I can't put my finger on. I'll keep trying.

wow I just made this and had to come back to the computer to tell everyone this is awesome. Like many others I don't like all the preservatives in store bought dressings. I agree i made it AS IS and it is very thick so try the buttermilk for a dressing. I am using it for a pizza recipe. Cheers and happy cooking

I love this recipe!  The store bought dressings are loaded with sodium and this is a fabulous alternative.  My daughter loves it and will ask, Mom, where's the recipe were short on dip.  I haven't tried it as a dressing yet.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.

This was fantastic! I made it to go with the veggie tray for Thanksgiving and I should have doubled it because it was gone pretty quickly. Great dip!

I thought this was an excellent base recipe! I found it too bland (and thick) for my tastes so here were the modifications I made: 1 CUP REDUCED FAT MAYO (WITH OLIVE OIL-IT'S KRAFT) 1/2 CUP LOW FAT SOUR CREAM 1 MINCED SHALLOT- DID NOT HAVE CHIVES 1/2 TSP. PARSLEY 1/2 TSP FRESH DILL WEED 1/4 TSP OF GARLIC POWDER 1 MINCED CLOVE OF REAL GARLIC 1/4 TSP ONION POWDER AND A FEW SPRINKLES OF DRIED MINCED ONION A SPLASH OF LEMON JUICE 1/4 TSP. "TRADER JOE'S 21 SEASON SALUTE" WHICH I HIGHLY RECOMMEND FOR MANY DISHES! A FEW SHAKES OF FRESH OREGANO I BLENDED ALL OF THESE INGREDIENTS IN A SMALL SIZE BLENDER AFTER MIXING WITH SPOON. I NOTICED THE DRESSING WAS MORE LIKE A DIP AND ALSO I LIKE SOME TANG SO I ADDED 1/4TH CUP OF 1% MILK AND A SPLASH OF VINEGAR. BLENDED SOME MORE, LET IT SIT FOR 30 MINUTES AND IT WAS PERFECT. 5 STARS AFTER MY MODIFICATIONS!!!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE :)

Pretty good. I used less dill...just a small pinch. Good, just not quite restuaruant style.

quick easy & so much better than the bottled option. I do 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup mayo and 1/2 cup buttermilk and I add a dash of Mrs. Dash spice which gives it just an extra kick. = )

This was pretty tasty, but I like a real kick, I revised the ingredient amounts as follows, 1/2 Cup buttermilk, 1 Cup Mayo, 1/4 Cup Sour Cream, 1 1/2 t dried Chives, 1/2 t Parsley Flakes, 1 t Dill, 3/4 t Garlic Powder, 1/4 t Onion Powder, 1/8 t Salt, 1/4 t Pepper, 2 sprinkles Paprika.  So tangy, very thick.  Thank you for submitting such a GREAT base recipe, and one so easy to adjust according to taste!

This is pretty good. It definitely needed to sit for a while though. I tried it about 15 minutes after making it and could really taste the mayonnaise, but the next day when I tried it again it was really yummy.

Great recipe, great flavor. I live in Australia where I haven't found any good American style ranch dressing, so I'm very glad I can make it myself now! I added 1/2 cup of milk to make the consistency more like dressing and less like dip. I also added a little bit more salt and a dash of lemon juice, just according to my personal tastes. So happy I found this!!

Absolutely wonderful!! I have been on a lactose free diet, longing for the taste of real Ranch dressing...I found that I can use a sour cream substitute (Sour Supreme) instead of sour cream. The blend of the herbs is perfect!!

I made this to go with some buffalo wings and it turned out pretty great!  I didn't have any buttermilk or sour cream so I used 1/4th cup of half and half with a table spoon of softened butter and 1 tsp of white vinegar. I also upped the salt, garlic and onion powder for more flavor. The consistency is creamy and tastes just like restaurant style ranch!! I will definitely make it again in the future!

I,too, thought it was a bit too much dill-even though I love dill. Added sour cream and mayo to buttermilk and thinned with skim milk to make easier pouring for salad dressing. Very, very close to the real thing! Thanks for the recipe. I will cut back on the dill next time and add garlic, since I am a garlic fan!

We were making wings for Sunday Football and I realized I forgot the ranch dressing packet at the store.  So, I pulled up this recipe online and was able to whip this up.  I followed some other's suggestions and did 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup sour cream and 1/2 butter milk (which I had to create too b/c I didn't have that 1 cup milk, 1 tbsp lemon juice--let sit for 15 minutes at room temp and wah-la, buttermilk) and sub'd the chives for thyme b/c I didn't have those either.  I was thoroughly impressed!  Will be keeping this recipe for future times and will never buy another ranch packet again!  Thanks so much!

delightful! much tastier than bottled, costs less, and is super easy to make. i add a half cup of milk so it's the right consistency for our squeezy bottle, and up the seasonings a bit to compensate. NOM NOM NOM! we go through a batch a week.

I am so excited to have found this recipe - it is great. It is thick, and I thinned my quite a bit with buttermilk so had to go back and add in a bit more of each herb. It's so great to know that I can mix it up anytime I need it - minus the nasty MSG that comes in the pre-packaged mixes and bottles of ranch! YAY!

Very good ranch dressing.  Using other reviewer's tips, I used 1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 c. sour cream, & 1/2 c. buttermilk.  Perfect consistency.

I prepared this with the dried herbs as listed using lowfat mayo and nonfat sour cream.  After letting it sit for a few hours I did a taste test and choose to up the pepper, chives and dill based on personal tastes.  This one will be a keeper for my family, it's great!

Made it just as listed and also with fresh herbs.  Both great.  I've also made it with light sour cream and less mayo.  Still good.  I've also made it with 1/3 mayo, 1/3 light sour cream, and 1/3 plain yogurt.  Still good but you just can't beat the full fat!  This is the best ranch I have ever had.  It is a summer time staple in our house.

This is the closest to a recipe at a local restaurant I have been trying to copy.  I have tweaked it a bit and I use 1/2 C Sour Cream, 1/2 C half and half (OR Buttermilk depending which I have available) and 1/2 C sour cream.  I upped the salt and pepper to 1/2 t also to give it more of a salt/peppery flavor.  It is WONDERFUL!!!!

I only put in about 2 tbs. mayonaisse and about 1-2 cups sour cream (depending on how much I need) as well as about 3 tbs buttermilk powder, then season to taste. It is absolutely delicious! The only ranch I eat anymore and I use it all the time!

Flavour is good but I found it a little to heavy in texture, so I added a bit of milk.  Still a thumbs up. : )

I made this for my son with lots of food allergies (no gluten, dairy or soy).  Made homemade mayo and substituted 2T rice milk for the sour cream.  He loved it - great blend of flavors.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I think this is a very tasty recipe, you may have to adjust it for a dip or dressing, but overall I can't find ranch in Japan and this recipe is a wonderful addition with the current ingredients! Try it with cream cheese for a different spin!

I used 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 cup buttermilk, and 1/2 cup mayo, and a bit more dill than it called for, and it was a lovely, fresh alternative to bottled dressing.  Thanks!

finding this recipe after realizing I'm lactose intollerent was a life saver.  I love ranch and cannot live with out it.  this recipe taste just like ranch with soy sour cream, I just had to add 1/4 cup soy milk to make the consistancy right.

Very delicious! I did take others advice and use 1/2 cup of each: mayo, sour cream and buttermilk. Was perfect, not too thick. It does have to sit in the fridge for a while so the flavors can meld. Tasted sooo good. Will use from now on! Thanks for sharing!

Easy and delicious!  I make this often.  I like it fine as is, but sometimes I also substitute plain yogurt for some or most of the mayo.  Gives it a nice zippy flavor.  I also add a couple tablespoons of milk if I want it a little thinner.

I have to change my review. I think this is much better with no mayo and just all sour cream(full fat 14%) and I think it needs to sit over night to reach full flavours.

So easy - why buy bottled? I use fat-free sour cream and light mayo and it's still great. Add some vinegar and a touch of sugar/sweetener to make a zesty salad topper.

I used a vegan mayo found at your local health food store for a more healthy version. Also I increased the garlic powder to 1/2tsp and added 1/4tsp of vinegar. Then instead of using 1/2c sour cream I used 1/4c buttermilk and 1/4c sour cream.

We really enjoyed this ranch recipe.  I am looking forward to using fresh herbs from the garden this summer with fresh garden veggies to dip into it.  I will also add 1 finely minced fresh garlic clove the next time I make it.

This was good. I did want it more runny to use as a salad dressing so I made the recipe as is and added buttermilk until I got the desired consistency. Best if you wait a few hours before consuming.

So good and easy to make, love that I always have all the ingredients on hand. I don't like dressings that taste too much like mayo, so I used 1 cup sour cream and 1/2 cup mayo, and it turned out perfect! I used it to dip Boneless Buffalo Wings from this site, along with carrot sticks and bell pepper. Delicious!

Wow! This dressing is so good and so easy to make. Used it on the layered spinach salad from this site and it was divine. For a regular tossed salad, I would thin it a little with buttermilk. As is, it is perfect for dip and would work well as a sandwich spread too. Thanks!

I used homemade buttermilk (2% milk and vinegar) instead of the sour cream to make the dressing thinner.  I like mine thin because I use less which means less calories.

Loved it! Our family tried Uncle Dan's for Easter. We liked it so much more than Ranch bought dressing. I had to find a recipe to match and this was it. I love the dill flavor. It's soo much more than a ranch dressing and I would'nt change a thing. Thank you !

Excellent replacement for the powdered packets. It's much cheaper and there's no preservatives or garbage going into it. I used this to make beer dip and it came out fantastic.

This was tragic.  Ranch dressing doesn't have dill in it.  I thought that I was perhaps confused, so I tried it and it was terrible.  I had to add huge amounts of garlic an onion powder to get it to taste like anything.  Not what I ws looking for at all!

I love this dressing! I think as a dip it's perfect. I've found that adding a little milk or 1/2 and 1/2 helps with the consistency for pouring over salads.

This dressing is fabulous!  I make with buttermilk as I like my dressing a little thinner. I make big batches of it and keep it in a large mason jar in fridge.  It doesn't stay around long at our house.

Dressing had an overly mayonaise taste and was so thick you had to use a spoon. I added some vinegar for flavor.  The dip made from the recipe was the consistency of dressing- liquidy. The buttermilk gave the dip a horrible taste.We added sugar, more seasonings but nothing helped.

Very good recipe. I like to make it a couple days ahead and the flavors are so much better then bottled.

I thought the flavor was right on.  However, for a dressing, I found it rather on the thick side.  Next time I would add a little buttermilk to make it thinner.  Overall, great flavor!  Thanks.

This is delicious.  I prefer to decrease the amount of dill weed or the dill is overpowering for my taste.  I love fresh salad dressing, and since ranch is one of our favorites, this is great for us.

Oh man!! This dressing is awesome! I like to add a little buttermilk to thin it out (its rather thick). I have passed this recipe on to my grandmother and my aunts after having some at my house. I used to buy the hv mix with all the junk in it... not anymore!!! I also like to make the recipe without the cream and mayo and use it on chicken and burgers. Very good!!!

i LOVED this recipe!! i can't seem to find a bottled ranch dressing without a strong buttermilk flavor and since this recipe didn't contain any buttermilk i loved it!! i only used 1/4 cup of mayo but kept everything else the same and it was wonderful!!

Perfection!  This ranch dressing is delicious.  I took the advice of other reviewers and swapped out 1/2 cup of mayo for 1/2 buttermilk.  I didn't have onion powder so I didn't use it.  This is absolutely delicious I agree with the others, I may never buy bottled dressing again!  Great recipe, so glad I tried it!

I have never made ranch before and was wondering what went into it.  I began making this in October.  I have not bought bottled ranch since then!  My 9 year old will not eat any other salad dressing now!

I did really care for it.  It's ok.  For ranch I use buttermilk, mayo, and a ranch packet. I've work in the restaurant business for years and this is the way that two of the places I've work at make this dressing!  It's gooood, thick, and simple.

Holy cow!!! I am so impressed. I was out of chives and it was still fantastic! It's pretty thick so it makes a great dip for potato skins or cheese fries. For salads, just add buttermilk until desired consistency. Great recipe!

Since I love thick and creamy dressings I thought this was fantastic! Hubby, who isn't a ranch fan, thought this was great too. However, our two year old, who will only eat salad coated with ranch dressing, did not like this at all. This is a very thick dressing, really more like a dip than a salad dressing. I made a few changes due to personal preference; I doubled the garlic powder and the salt. I also used seasoning salt instead of regular salt. I served this over garden salads, with added bacon and cheddar cheese. Yummy!! Thanks for a great recipe!

I followed the other suggestion and made this with mayo, sour cream, and sour milk (because I didn't have buttermilk).  My little girl can't have gluten, which is found in a lot of commercial ranch dressings.  She gobbled this up!  Maybe next time I'll try some other mayo combinations.  Thanks!!

Great ranch dressing! I took other reviewers advice and used a combination of  1/2c.buttermilk, 1/2c. mayo and 1/2c. sour cream. Also increased the garlic powder to 1/2 t. It was so easy, no more bottled ranch for us!

I have been living in Australia and missing my ranch dressing until now. This is the best and I will never buy packet or bottled dressing again! Using buttermilk would create a slightly thinner dressing if you prefer or add a couple tablespoons of milk to sour cream recipe if you would like. Cheers!

Tastes too much like mayonaise. I thought the spices would over-power the taste of the mayo, but they didn't. I might try this recipe again (I think the blend of spices might be right on) with buttermilk or sour creamm, but definitely no mayo!

This is the first ranch recipe i've ever tried. It tastes pretty close to restaurant ranch, but I'm new to cooking so I don't know how to give it that fattening taste. I used buttermilk. Next time I will try it with half buttermilk and half mayo. Definitely good for dipping. Not sure if it's salad dressing status yet but it's definitely a keeper. Thanks for submitting!

This is so yummy. I personally found it a little too "dilly" and adjusted it accordingly. I also use 1 cup buttermilk instead of sour cream and 2/3 cup mayo. Makes a more pourable dressing that way. Since we go through this so fast, I multiply all the dry ingredients by 8 and make a big batch, store in an airtight container and then I always have it on hand. Just add 1 tablespoon to the buttermilk and mayo and whisk it up.

Ran out of the ranch mix, so threw this together in a pinch.  I didn't have dried chives, used 2 fresh chopped green onions instead.  Very good.

Great recipe...unbelievably better than the Ranch you get in the supermarket...and really easy. Have tried it with non-fat sour cream as well as reduced-fat. Both were good. Also tried it with reduced fat mayo and no mayo. Same results...very tasty. Best to let it rest for an hour or so before serving. Very very good...thanks!

I really enjoyed this recipe, it thick, so it made a great veggie dip too! I tweaked it a little with a little more chives, parsley and garlic powder, but it's great "as is".  I will make this again, and so will everyone I gave the recipe to!!

This is a very good dressing.  Like many others, I found it mild.  Some reviewers commented that a touch of vinegar was a good tweak to this recipe.  I tried that, but the flavor was unbalanced.  To salvage the dressing, I added a bit of sugar.   Very good result.

Excellent recipe and a giant leap from the funky, chemical taste of bottled dressing. I used the 1/2 c. mayo, 1/2 c. s.cream, 1/2 c. buttermilk formula that other reviewers had success with and it was still a little on the thick side for salad dressing but the perfect dip consistency (think Buffalo wings & celery!). Of course, it can be thinned with add'l buttermilk or olive oil. I used it as part of the Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabob recipe posted on this site as well as on a garden salad and it was wonderful for both. Thanks!!!

The recipe was good, but I also added a 1/2 cup of buttermilk. It seemed a little bland so I added a 1/2 tsp each of the spices and it still seemed a little bland. I then added some lemon pepper seasoning and that was exactly what it needed. A good base recipe, but since I had to add ingredients it only gets 4 stars.

I didn't have the chives for my first batch of this dressing and it was wonderful even without it.  Nice flavor and creamy.  It was hard to not eat it by the spoonful.  I had to keep "tasting" it to make sure it was "OK"!  Better flavor than the most popular bottled variety.

Great. I didn't have sour cream, so I used nonfat plain yogurt. To bring up the "zing" I added some dried buttermilk powder. I also didn't have any dried parsley, so I used dried cilantro (which is REALLY bland, not like fresh) and it mimicked parsley quite well.

This dressing is awesome! even my husband who does not like mayonnaise could not tell that dressing had lots of mayo and found it great.
I made substitutions because of pantry issues: I used Greek style yogurt instead of the sour cream and omitted the onion powder and the dried chives. i added 1/2 t.of garlic powder instead, and still the recipe was wonderful. Next time I will try with all the right ingredients to see if there is a difference, but I cannot think that it can get any better that was I tasted with the substitutions. Thank you for a great recipe for home made Ranch dressing!

This dressing gets better the longer it sits. I followed the suggestion to use 1/2 c. buttermilk, sour cream and mayonnaise as other cooks had suggested. It is good but still lacks something . . .

I'm giving this a 4 as is, but really with the changes everyone suggested I'd give it a 5. Instead of the mayo/sour cream proportion, I used 1/3 cup light mayo, 1/3 cup light sour cream and 2/3 cup low fat buttermilk. I also doubled the spices and used fresh chives.

Definitely will NOT make again.  Way too mayonaise-y.  That's all you taste, also, way too thick for a dressing.  I tried thinning with buttermilk and adding extra spices, helped a little, but its not "steakhouse" ranch if thats what you're looking for.

The critical part of this recipe is the spices.  Mix them up in larger amounts and store them in an empty spice jar.  Add them to sour cream for dip, mayo or buttermilk for dressing.   Very versatile and can be used to season baked chicken too.  Cheaper, better and less salty than the packets of ranch dressing/dip mix.  Thank you!

This was so yummy and super fast.  The time it takes you to make this dressing is less than the time it takes you to go buy bottled ranch. It tastes so fresh and like the restaurant's ranch (it is a little bit thick, but not a problem with me). The dill gives it wonderful flavor. I will try it with buttermilk next time.

This was my first attempt at homemade ranch. It was great! I could not believe how easy it was and tasted just like the "official" packaged stuff, better-fresh.  I did not have chives, didn't miss them. I added a drop of lemon juice to help preserve it in the fridge. Good recipe!!!

Wow is this good.  Bottled reduced fat ranch dressing is usually nasty.  I used about 3/4 cup of a VERY reduced fat mayo and decided the mayo didn't have any flavor, so topped off the cup with Miracle Whip.  I subbed fat free buttermilk for the sour cream because I wanted it to be more pourable, but it was still spoonable.  I also doubled the garlic and subbed dry cilantro for the parsley (don't think either one tastes like much anyway).  Fantastic.

Wow!! i loved this. Since we're just two at home, i halved the quantity of mayo and sour cream, but kept the same amount of herbs, even increased the garlic powder to 1/2 teaspoon. Added 1/2 teaspoon of vinegar, next time i'll try adding 1 tablespoon.
Used this to make the Anniversary Chicken I from this site and a delicious potato salad. Thanks Dawnia for sharing this wonderful recipe :)

Fantastic! I followed Christy's advice about increasing the garlic, subbing buttermilk, and adding a bit of oil and it turned out beautifully. I dislike bottled ranch (it never tastes like the kind in restaurants) and now I will never have to buy it again. Thanks!

I was excited to make this recipe as I love ranch dressing & making it at home without all the preservatives is always appealing. I just got done with it, and of course, I had to taste it before I put it in the fridge. I didn't want a thick veggie dip, so I followed someone elses advice and used 1/2 cup mayo, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/2 cup sour cream. It ended up like ranch water! VERY runny, so I added in a little more mayo. It doesn't have the taste I was hoping for. The aftertaste tastes more like ranch than when you first put it in your mouth. Maybe I should have used buttermilk, and I will try it again that way. But as for the way it is now, I will not be making it like that again. It's pretty though!!!!

This recipe is excellent.  My daughters and their friends love it as an after-school snack with carrots, and kids comment on how as a dip it's so good.  We even use it as a salad dressing with lettuce and parmesan.  This can also be used with tofutti sour cream for allergies.

I live in Uganda where we can't get mixes. This is an amazing recipe! I have shared it with many visitors. I use my food processor and add fresh onion and garlic since I can't get the powders. Works great! This is the only ranch dressing I use now!

Has anyone else ever been ticked off that Ranch from the store never tastes like Ranch from a restaraunt? Those days are over! This is awesome! Thin it out with a little buttermilk - and WOW! Thanks for ending my never-ending quest for the perfect Ranch!!

If you're after a restaurant-style ranch, this might not be the recipe for you.  As a whole, it reminds me of vegetable dip, not salad dressing.  I was looking for a thinner, restaurant-style flavor.  The dill weed was far too strong for my liking.  I added a lot of milk to get a thinner consistancy for my personal taste.  If I make this again, I'll leave the dill weed out altogether. After seeing previous reviews, I see that others do prefer this taste, as well as a thicker dressing.

I'VE TRIED THIS RECIPE BOTH AS A DIP AND AS A SALAD DRESSING. I LIKED IT MUCH BETTER AS A DIP. IT'S PRETTY GOOD THOUGH.

I stopped buying ranch dressing because this is so good.  My daughter-in-law is hooked on it now also.  I add more dill because my husband & I love the taste of dill other than that I haven't altered the recipe at all.  I am going to experiment with it next time.

I unfortunately couldn't find chives, dried or fresh, but otherwise I made this as written.  This recipe definitely improves with time.  The first night I could only taste the mayonaisse, but in a day or two the flavors blended nicely.  I also mixed some of this with extra dill, black pepper, onion, celery and chicken to make a great chicken salad sandwich.

Overall yummy - I added a dash of worcheschire sauce for a little kick,and it was good.  A little too thick, so I will add buttermilk or milk to thin out to pour, but very easy and good.

It seems that the buttermilk was missing from this recipe, so I added about a half cup or so. The taste is really thich and rich. I loved it.

I followed the recipes exactly as directed.  I've made it a few times & find increasing ALL the herbs/spices a bit (heavier handed on the garlic & onion powder) & the addition of celery salt makes it superb! I also add a little milk to thin it out a little, so it pours easiler.

I have been using Dawnia's recipe for a long time now; I make all kinds of salads and sandwich spreads with it. Recently I used this as the sauce for the Gourmet Chicken Pizza recipe...fantastic! I will never buy Ranch dressing from the store again! Thanks, Dawnia.

This was ok, not what I was expecting.  I followed the recipe exactly but it is better as a dip then a salad dressing.  Next time I might try using buttermilk instead of sour cream.  I didn't use all the dill called for in the recipe either.

Very flavorful.  I served this dressing on a bbq chicken salad and my husband loved it.
