this recipe was to dry and bland to give this recipe a 5 star rating you must add 3tbsp. surgar, 2tbsp.cocoa, 1tsp. vanilla,  1 extra egg, 1/2 cup milk bake at 350 instead . They came out moist and full of flavor thank you for the starting of the recipe.

I just got done making these muffins, and they are AWFUL. What a waste of perfectly good over-ripe bananas :( I guess I should have read all the reviews first, then I wouldve known that the muffins BURN if you bake them for 15 minutes like is recommended in the recipe. Also, they just taste gross. Dry, baking powdery, not sweet enough. Like "add water" box mix or something. :/ I'm no  major baker, so I don't come on here to mess & tweak with recipes. I want a good recipe the first time. My husband couldn't finish them, we couldn't even pawn them off on our kids!! VERY DISAPPOINTED.

I really changed up these muffins.  I didn't even have bananas on hand so I added 2/3 c homestyle applesauce, 1/2 c milk and an extra egg.  I also added crushed bran flakes for a non-nutty crunch.  Baked also on 350 for 15 minutes.  I sell Avon and we just came out with a muffin top pan which I used instead of a regular muffin pan.  The second batch I added peach preserves and cream cheese chunks and topped with sliced honey roasted almonds.  Both variations were good..

These muffins were great.  After reading other reviews, I lowered the oven temperature to 350 and they turned out moist and delicious.  Also, I ended up with 12 muffins and a bunch of mini-muffins (which my kids love).  Thanks for the great recipe Corwynn!

These muffins were great! I only used half the amount of oil (and used olive oil instead) and they were a huge hit!

I baked these at 425 degrees but they were done after only 13 1/2 minutes.  I also had more batter than 12 muffins so made eleven additional MINI-size muffins with the extra batter, and baked them about 7 minutes or so.  These are delicious!

I should have followed the other reviewer's suggestion and lowered the oven temp!!  I checked on them just as they were starting to burn! They were still good tho! I used 3 bananas and had a little over a cup, so i also ended up with about 4 more muffins than I was supposed to.  The last 4, I lowered the temp to 350 and baked for the recommended time and they came out perfect!

These are terrible. So bland. Very heavy, not nice fluffy like banana muffins should be. I used more bananas than called for and barely tastes like banana.

I baked at the rec temp, but would lower to 350 next time. They didn't burn, but they were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside. I enjoy a more overall fluffiness. Would also reduce baking powder and add vanilla next time. They were okay, but seemed to be missing that special something.

Num, num, num!  I made these a tad healthier by using a sugar substitute, all-natural applesauce vs oil, and carob chips.  (And no cocoa powder.)

This morning Imade this muffin and the smell of it in the oven was enough to make my stomach snarl, yes not a cute growl but a full blown harley davidson growl. It was satisfying but not number one in the book (you made 2nd though!), I think I baked it to long or was it that I only used brown suger but they came out looking a little oven light tanned (because I did not burn them!). I used half a cup of milk more+an extra egg and it turned a little cakey. One thing's for sure I had three perfectly good bananas and I couldn't taste any of that flavour that my tongue expected on that first bite, so maybe 1 or 2 extra next time? But to my personal recipe I morphed it with a nother recipe with coconut and cinnamon topping and it turned out alright you can just see it in the picture.

This batter was very, very dry...I also cut the baking powder from 3 TABLESPOONS (which is ALOT) to 1 teaspoon.  I kept the temp at 350 degrees, 425 seemed high to me.  Ok...they just came out of the oven.  Oh my there is something seriously wrong with this recipe...ok flavour but took them out thinking they were cooked and found out they are not...looked like they were burning.  Ugh.  Horrible.  Won't be making these again.  Waste of chocolate and bananas.  Dry and crumbled/fell apart after cooking.

these were delicious!  i cooked them at 350 for 20 minutes, doubled the batch, and substituted applesauce for the oil.  this is a very yummy chocolate/banana combo.  only reason i didn't give it 5/5 was because it was a bit chewier than i'd like, however that could be my own fault with the applesauce switch.

great idea but something is off in the mix - too much oil for sure and not sweet enough for my taste. very dense and not light and airy. disappointed. think it could be great if tweaked but i'm not sure how to do so . . .

I loved this recipe. I can't find it now but I remember reading to add plain yogurt to the dough and that was a God-send. I added 1 1/2 cups of the yogurt to the dough and they turned out perfect.  I also used Ghirardelli chocolate chips I already had on hand.  Yum!

I found this batter to be REALLY dry - I had to add about 3/4c milk to get it to a consistency where I could drop it into the muffin tins. I also agree with other reviewers that dropped the oven temp.  I did like the final product though - a very dense muffin - my kids (3 and 5 yrs old) LOVED them, so I will make them again for them.

This was good, but I did take the other writers advice and added, vanilla, extra egg and more sugar and changed the oven temperature to 350 for 15 min.  Will use this one again.  This is a keeper.

I love making muffins to have on hand for breakfast.  Seems like I always have bananas that get too ripe to eat so I've been on the hunt for a good banana muffin recipe.  Boy did I ever find one here!  My hubby and I absolutely LOVE these muffins!  I think they'll be a weekly ritual for a while!  Perfect when you need a chocolate fix!

I agree with the review that said these are baking-powdery tasting. They are also dry. I will not be making these again.

They were done in 14 minutes...so watch out! I omitted the cocoa powder and added some pecans and almonds. The muffins came out great! Also added an extra banana and 1/2 tsp vanilla. Gave them 4 stars because I tweaked the recpie a little. Good luck with yours!

I tailored this recipe to my lactose intolerance and highish cholesterol problem. Followed the same instructions, but: 3/4 cup wheat flour, remaining flour all purpose. 3 Tbsp cocoa powder. Just under a Tbsp baking powder. 2 mashed bananas. 1/2 cup almond breeze milk. 2/3 cup olive oil. 1 egg, 1 egg white. 3/4 cup dark chocolate chips, 1/2 cup walnuts. 1/4 cup dried cherries. Delightful.

The other reviews scared me a bit, but I made this as written and thought it was really good. The texture was a bit dense, but since the flavor was good, I didn't mind. I used two overripe bananas from the freezer. Another bonus was that the batter didn't stick to the muffin cups at all.

This is my favorite way to use up brown bananas.  I'm not a big fan of banana bread so the chocolate "disguises" the banana flavor.  I substitute half unsweetened applesause for some of the oil to make it lower in fat and it turns out great!

After reading the reviews, we did add 1/2 milk and decreased our temp to 350.  We also added 2 Tbsp of honey.  My 9 y/o loves to make these, and they are a favorite here!!  Could you not just change the original baking instructions to 350?  Not sure how that works, but thanks!!!!

These muffins are delicious!! They would probably taste bland if the chocolate chips weren't in the batter, so remember to put them in. A double batch makes 33!

I didn't measure the banana (just threw in the 3 I had).  It was the perfect amount.  I'm not sure the full amount of oil was required.  It makes them pretty fattening.  However, the muffins turned out moist and my family loved them.  Much easier and more fun than banana bread.

I made these last night and they were good.  The only thing I would add is a bit of milk (like 1/4 cup).  The dough seemed too sticky if I didn't.  Definately worth a try.

When I first made this recipe and saw how dry the dough was, I came back & read the reviews.  I saw that people had added various things to the batter, so I added milk, vanilla, and applesauce.  It still didn't help.  They taste chalky and dry.

This recipe was difficult to work with.  The batter was extremely stiff, so I had to add 3/4cup of milk.  Even then it was still very thick.  Additionally, the muffins were not sweet at all.  I recommend adding another 1/2 cup of sugar, if not going with another recipe altogether.

These muffins are wonderful! The light and taste, the chocolate and banana are a great combination. My kids eat these up! The batter is very thick, but don't worry about it. I bake them without liners and the muffins brown more. You simply must try them to see for yourself.

I made this into bread instead of muffins, reduced the temp to 375 and eyeballed it for time, I think it ended up being around 30 minutes. 
It was yummy and not too sweet, although it was rather crumbly. I'd probably make it again!

I used the small muffin pan and set the timer for 12:30. They are a bit dry but its okay. They were made with the intent of dunking or just along side a cup of coffee. I will try the modified versions ( vanilla, milk added) next time.

Followed the recipe exactly as posted.  Dry, rock hard and they had hardly any banana flavour.  Just became a chocolate muffin with a hint of banana.  Couldn’t help but wonder if an ingredient is missing in the posted recipe.  Wasn’t the least bit moist.  Won’t make again.

The proportions are off on this recipe. I made it as written and it was too stiff and dry to drop into the muffin cups. I like the idea of chocolate banana muffins, just not this recipe.

My granddaughters and I made this 3 times this past week during their spring break.  Once with Chocolate chips, once with chopped walnuts, and once with white chips.  All 3 batches were made right to recipe - turned out well.  Everyone loved them.  Much of the temperature relates to how your oven works.

With so many different reviews I thought I'd follow the recipe exactly as it's written (though I did turn the oven down to 170C).  They were terrible muffins, unfortunately.  I could barely taste the banana, they didn't rise at all and looked more like sick UFOs.  Very stodgy and tasteless.  So... I guess a lot of changes are needed per the suggestions!! Lesson learnt.

This muffin recipe is just right for the taste of the whole family. It's not bland at all coz the bananas and the chocolate chips already added to the sweetness. :) I even reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and the cocoa powder to 1/8 cup as I don't want it to look so dark. I only used 2/3 cup oil and added few more bananas to compensate. I don't have semi-sweet chocolote chips so I only put 1 cup sweet choco chips. I also added half a cup of old-fashion oatmeal for added fiber.  Baked it at 350 deg for 25 minutes with a half-filled muffin pan at the bottom of the oven to keep it soft and moist. I just made sure that I din't overdo the mixing on the process. My husband likes it very much! I will surely make this recipe again.

i changed alot, going by the other peoples reviews.

they look great and rose well. But although i added more sugar and theres chocolate chips in them, they come off as "healthy" mufins.. and to me that doesnt mean the most tasty. for sure going to try adding banana again though, but to perhaps anouther chocolate chip recipe :)

If i made them for me, they would be fine and i would have added ground flax seed, but i made them for the boyfriend since he needed some mufins for his snack at work, and i know he wont be that thrilled by these.

This was my first time making muffins (just learning how to bake), and I didn't realize that you could read reviews of the recipes on allrecipes.com! I wish I had ;) When I finished preparing the mix, it was totally dry, seemed like I had missed an ingrediant, so I added about half a cup of milk. I baked them at 425, but lowered the temp after awhile b/c smelled like burning. In the end, they weren't great, but they're edible. And hey, they have chocolate chips in them. But, they were a little small and dense for muffins.

This recipe does not seem like a recipe for muffin but more for cookie/cupcakes. Muffin batter is suppose to be runny, not hard and stiff. I will not make these "muffins" again

I wonder if there is a missing ingredient in this recipe, because when we made it, the batter was VERY thick, and the muffins are not sweet at all. Most muffin recipes I have used have equal amounts of sugar and flour. The taste of the muffins was also flat, and I think salt would help.

I was so excited to try this recipe 'cause I'm new to the cooking for myself thing (away at school!)  : )  Anyways, the muffins weren't like muffins at all... more like cakey cookies that didn't rise. YIKES!  Sounds like some others have made some great suggestions to fix this recipe that's in much need of help!  Thanks for your ideas to save what turned out to be a tasty but ugly disaster!

I have made these twice now, and my Mom and Dad and I all enjoy them.  They use up the ripe bananas, fulfill the chocolate craving, and provide something special for breakfast or a snack.
The first time I made them, they were a little scorched on the top, so I baked them at a lower temp than recommended the second time.  I think this oven runs hot, though.

Mine too, when mixed up, were more like dough than batter.  But I stuck some in the paper cups anyway and hoped for the best.  They weren't much to look at but they were moist and had lots of banana and chocolate flavor.  The kids liked them and that, for me, was the most important thing.

These were pretty good. I didn't put chips in, hoping they would be pretty chocolatey on their own, but they were mostly bananay. bananaey? Anyway, they were still gone in a flash. I will definately make these again and try to up the cocoa / sugar. Turning the oven down to 350 was definately good advice too.

These are great snack muffins! Following others suggestions, I cooked them at 350 and it took about 18 min. The recipe made 15 muffins. I was out of oil, so substituted unsweetened applesauce and then added a few splashes of milk (3-4 Tbs I think) to get the right consistency. They came out very fluffy and even won the approval of the 4 yr old I take care of!

Not sure what I did wrong, but these muffins were very, very dry.  I noticed they were dry as I mixed them up, but was hoping for the best.  Will not try this recipe again, unless someone has a suggestion.  This recipe sounded really good.
