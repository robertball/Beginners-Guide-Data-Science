Can you really rate any recipe that boasts hot sauce and avocado? No. It's a perfect marriage. The recipe calls for one cup of avocado, you'll want one avocado, no need to measure it seeing that it will be cut and served inside the skin.

Delicious! I used Tapatio hot sauce. It was a perfect snack. This will definitely goo into my bag of tricks.

Pretty fabulous. I’d say it’s a few less carbohydrates than listed.  Great way to have a quick snack. I like my avocados really ripe so mine don’t normally slice all pretty but it’s still delicious.
