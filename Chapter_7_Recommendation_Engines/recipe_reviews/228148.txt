Wasn't sure what to think of this since I was the first one to rate it. This was actually really good! I followed the recipe pretty much exactly (I did form it into a circle instead of the square) and really enjoyed the pesto flavor. I made sure the potatoes were real thin so they softened, and the added onions on top really added to the flavor. Yum!

I used homemade spelt flour crust for this, and it was  quite good. I also added some parmesan cheese on top. The oil from the pesto made it pretty greasy, but I didn't mind that much.
