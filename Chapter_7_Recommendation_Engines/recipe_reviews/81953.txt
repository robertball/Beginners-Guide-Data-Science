This is a good recipie!!! I suggest adding a red pepper as well because its flavour is less stong and balances the green pepper. Also, eggplant can be bitter if not "sweated" in advance, so a tsp of sugar may be required in the sauce. 1/8th of a tsp of oregano is ridiculous..add more..same with red pepper flakes.  This recipie can be varied a lot!!!

This was excellent. I left out the green pepper, bay leaf and tomato paste which I do not think is necessary because my gravy turned out on the  thick side without it. I also left out the mushrooms because I do not like them. I added extra garlic and used 2 cans of anchovies. The whole time this was cooking I thought it smelled familiar, IT SMELLED AND TASTED JUST LIKE LIGUINI WITH RED CLAM SAUCE BUT MUCH CHEAPER TO MAKE.  Do not be afaid to try this if you like trying different tomato sauces.

It smells just like my grandma's house up in here. I was skeptical about the anchovies cause i know they didn't go into hers, but they do a whole lot for the flavor

Very good...I did substitute anchovy paste and capers for the anchovies  because it is what I had on hand. This reminded me of home. I will make again.

So many good things to say about this recipe. It is a traditional pasta served in Southern Italy. I saut√©ed the anchovies in the beginning, allowing them to melt into the sauce. I also omitted the mushrooms . The sauce was so good my husband used his bread to clean both his and my plates. This is called "fare la scarpetta"- considered a rude gesture in parts of Italy, but my husband didn't care! It was that good. Leftovers are wonderful in risotto or served as a side dish with lots of Italian bread!Don't forget to add some hot peppers! Thank you for sharing your recipe. :-)
