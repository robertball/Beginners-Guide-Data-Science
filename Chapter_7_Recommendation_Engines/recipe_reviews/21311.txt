This was a tasty dip, however I'm giving it 3 stars because the consistency was not so great. I used grape juice concentrate instead of orange (to dip grapes in), and it had a very pretty color. However, it was rather runny and after sitting for a little while it started to take on a curdled appearance. With all the other excellent fruit dip recipes out there, I'm not sure I'd make this one again.

We love love love this dip! I have never had a problem with consistency or appearance. When you first whip it up, it appears a little runny, but if you put in the fridge for an hour or two, it firms right up and is that way from then on. Whenever I take it to parties it gets rave reviews.
