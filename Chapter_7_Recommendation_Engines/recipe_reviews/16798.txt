I use boneless chicken breasts instead of legs and 6 oz. of Tropicana oj from the jug. I also use French onion soup mix in place of the regular onion mix. My extra twist...and you will want to add this (TRUST ME)..is sauteeing about 1/2 onion in olive oil, garlic salt and pepper. Place on top of the chicken as the last ingredient before baking and WOW!! I have made this 3 times for my family and plan to make it for my parents when they visit next month. It is JUST that good!!

I liked the orange flavor but the onion soup mix made it way too salty.  Next time I would cut it back to half a package and supplement with additional dried onions.  Also, there is way too much sauce for the amount of chicken.  I ended up throwing quite a bit away.

This is a very tasty, easy recipe.  I use 8 chicken thighs and serve with rice and frozen peas.

This was a very simple recipe.  I always like having a quick meal idea for those nights when we're on the go.  I don't want to have to eat out!  Next time I'll marinate the chicken.

I needed to use up a bag of oranges, so I put them through the juicer to make this recipe. I put frozen mixed vegetables in the bottom of the pan and covered with the chicken and sauce, baked it and served it over rice. It was tasty and has a strong orange flavor which we like.

This recipe has potential.Probably should cut back on the orange concentrate.Maybe use half a packet of dry onion soup mix. But other than that it was somewhat delicious.

Pretty good.  I would cut down on the orange juice next time for my taste, but my husband liked it the way it was.

This was one of the easiest meals I have made.  My husband and I loved it, but not such a hit with my picky eating boys.  Used Tropicana juice instead of concentrate and halved the onion soup.  Added sauted onion, with minced garlic and pepper.  Used thighs and legs - next time will use skinless.  There was a lot of chicken fat in the sauce.

My family loved it!  I altered a few things...I used both boneless breasts halved and legs.  I sauteed sliced onions in olive oil and garlic then placed them on top of the chicken.  I decreased the amount of dry onion soup mix to 1/4 cup.  I then mixed the ingredients and poured them on top of the chicken and onions.  I served it with white rice and steamed broccoli.  It was fabulous!!

This was delicious, I used only half a can of concentrate and half a package of onion soup mix, as reccomended in the reviews above and it was so good, a perfect amount of sauce too.

Everyone said there was so much sauce left over I decided to make more drumsticks with it.  I used 11 legs and it was still too much sauce!  This was good the first night we had it...then it just go to strong and oniony.  Next time I make this I'll cut down the entire sauce recipe and then cut the onion soup mix even more.

I like this a lot. It has a strong flavor, and that's fine with me. I used more chicken than the recipe called for and I like having lots of sauce.  Will definitely make this one again.

Made to recipe specifications, but found the chicken to be greasy and the meat, overall, lacking in flavor. Maybe if it had a bit of pineapple and the sauce possibly thickened with some carrots added to it might have made it nicer.

5 stars for being simple with few ingredients. It definitely is orange! I don't know why the other reviews said to halve things, keep in mind it is 6 oz of OJ and a normal add-three-cans-water concentrate is 12oz. I used 6 boneless skinless thighs I got on sale and this was the perfect amount of sauce. Great as is, and I think next time I'll bread and fry chicken pieces and top with this sauce for a crunchier version. Thanks for easy cheap Chinese food!
***side note - seems to be a milder orange flavor the day after***

This recipe was OUTSTANDING. Five stars definitely. The orange flavor really stood out and contrary to other reviews, I did not think it was incredibly salty. I actually thought it was perfect the way it was. After baking it uncovered, I did throw it on the grill to get some charred marks on it. I made it alongside some green beans lightly tossed in lemon juice, salt and pepper and rice with Cilantro. YUM!

Not bad.  It was missing something.  I didn't add salt since some reviews said that the Soup Mix made it salty.  That wasn't the case for us...it needed more flavor.We used 4 legs and 4 thighs and doubled the juice and seasonings.  I will try it again with a little more seasonings this time.

I made this. The only difference was I added half the amount of onion soup and I added sautéd onion. The flavour ended up still being very salty and tasking exclusively like poultry seasoning.

I didn’t have onion soup mix or French dressing so I used honey mustard and half a can of frozen OJ. I also used chicken legs. It was wonderful!

I've been making this recipe since I was a kid! Hubs and I both love it, but four chicken legs is far too little. We generally use at least five leg quarters! (Who doesn't love leftovers?) If you're a fan of the orange flavor, try this: remove the chicken from the pan after about 40 minutes. Spoon out some of the sauce (enough to spoon back over the chicken later), and stir in 2 cups of cooked white rice and whatever frozen veg you like - we use a stir fry blend to lend an Asian feel. Mix the sauce, rice and frozen vegetables well, and plunk the chicken pieces back on top of the whole thing. Now spoon your reserved sauce over each piece and pop it back in the oven uncovered for twenty minutes or so. Bam! One-dish super orange meal!

This recipe was not appealing to our family.  The orange juice sauce produced a bitter taste.  Perhaps with some modifications it would be better.
