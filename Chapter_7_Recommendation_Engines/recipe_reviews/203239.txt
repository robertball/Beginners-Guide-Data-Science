I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very tasty and easy to make.  However, you need to strain it before drinking, as the blackberry seeds are impossible to ignore.  Next time I'll substitute something else for the blackberries.

Excellent. I used greek yogurt because that was all I had on hand. Made one batch, then turned around and made another because my kids and I loved it so much. Great use of this year's bumper crop of blackberries/raspberries.

I have a Vitamix, so that pretty much took care of the seed problem but I can see how this would be an issue without this workhorse of a blender. So I'm not so sure blackberries, with their huge seeds, are the best choice for smoothies.  The flavor was good, but we found the banana just a little distracting for a "Raspberry Blackberry Smoothie." I used frozen berries, so the ice cubes weren't necessary, but a little milk to thin it out was.

The flavor was good.  However, it's pretty thick and there's really no liquid (milk or juice) to help get this blended up well.  I'm not fond of smoothies with bits of fruit left and some liquid is what helps them blend up really smooth.  It also just got stuck in the blender a lot.  So there was a bit of a hassle factor involved.  Also, as someone else pointed out -- the seeds.  Blackberries and raspberries both end up with a lot of seed to contend with, and while the suggestion to strain it is a really good one (which I will try on other smoothies), I just don't see how to strain something thick like this through something that would catch seeds.  Therefore, even though I liked the taste, I don't think I'd want to make this again.

We really enjoyed this smoothie. Followed the recipe and they are very refreshing. Hubby is on a smoothie kick, as he wants to find a replacement for coffee on his commute in the morning. He asked for a raspberry/blackberry combo and I was happy to find this one. It is extremely easy with ingredients I had on hand. My fridge makes smaller ice cubes so I added a little more and it was perfect. Will make this often this summer. Thanks for sharing!

Almost like mine.  But I cook the blackberries and raspberries to soften and put through a strainer to remove the seeds and have a puree.  Freeze 1st until they are ice cubes and only use 1/2 banana.  I use organic cane sugar instead of honey if needed, because I'm not a honey fan.  If it is too thick I add some V8 fusion Goji raspberry or Acai raspberry juice.  That juice also adds some veggies to it as well.

The puree and some fresh crushed berries also works when making a yogurt parfait with whole grain granola cereal and walnuts.

1 layer of yogurt your choice
1 layer crushed fruit and the a little puree.  Again your choice of fruit
1 layer cereal and walnuts.

Repeat until the glass of your choice is full.

In place of ice cubes, you can thin this smoothie with any favorite liquid from juice to milk. I had to strain the drink because the drink with seeds was too gritty. Then, it was smooth and wonderful! For a thin smoothie, leave out the banana.

To use up what I had, I used frozen blackberries, fresh blueberries and fat free raspberry yogurt.  Instead of ice, I added some peach juice so it wasn't as thick (for my husband).  It was delicious but rated 4 because of the blackberry seeds.

Good, but the seeds are a problem and a little heavy on banana.  I substituted 1/2 cup strawberries and 1 cup blueberries for the blackberries and raspberries, and only used 1/2 banana.  Still had some seeds, but not nearly as many.   It was great.

Good and healthy, but seeds were too big.  Better if you run it through a sieve, then chill.

Except for the blackberry seeds, this was a really good smoothie. I'm not a huge fan of just straight-up berries, but the banana and yogurt muffled the berries the exact right amount.

This is a quick and easy breakfast.  The seeds from the berries were quite noticeable, which didn't bother me, but this may not be the smoothie for you if you want it truly "smooth."

This is pretty good, but I tried freezing slices of banana (layered on a plastic bag) first. Didn't even need the honey and the sweetened yogurt- the frozen bananas made it thick and rich! I added some almond milk to make it non-dairy. But hey, this other recipe's good too :)

Didn't use the banana per my kids' requests.  Because my berries were already frozen, I didn't feel the need to add any ice.  Smoothie was very good.  I liked using the honey instead of the usual sugar called for and the blackberries and raspberries made a nice combination of flavors (but had lots of seeds).

I used a pot of vanilla soy yoghurt, 1 tsp of agave, 5 ice cubes, 1/4 cup each blackberries and raspberries and a normal sized banana. It made two glasses and came out a lovely dark pink.

Very good. I always replace the yogurt with almond milk for extra calcium and it was delicious.

Instead of blackberries, I added blueberries. This was delicious.

Used frozen raspberries instead of fresh and cut out the ice cubes. Made a wonderful smoothie!
