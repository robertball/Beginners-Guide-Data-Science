A simple yet flavorful recipe that can be a base for a multitude of meals. Rather than use water I used unsalted beef broth.  I used this for beef dip sandwiches without any further seasoning needed. Shredded beef tacos are next on the menu.

The simplest recipes are usually the best - no exceptions here.  Followed the directions to be generous with seasonings (even though I halved the water and added a 10 oz. can of Campbellâ€™s beef broth & 1/4-cup of coffee). Made tacos - DELICIOUS!  My new go to for shredded beef!!
