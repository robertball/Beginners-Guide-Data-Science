It was by far the worst smoothie I have ever had. I could barely get one sip down. Everyone else in my family that tried it thought it was terrible too.

Made this as a post workout shake and it was very good. I drank half of it before I remembered to take a picture. I will recommend adding chunky peanut butter (and add a little more for a nuttier flavor).

Smoothies and shakes are such a personal preference type thing, I believe. This one just didn't do it for me. The almond butter flavor didn't come through at all, and it needed a little sweetener and thinning with water. Easy enough to adjust, but probably not a shake I'll make again.
