My husband loved these! I used crescent rolls instead of the phyllo dough...very easy. I have been requested to make again.

This is very tasty, attractive and easy for a quick spinach pie. Just remember to allow time for the spinach to thaw. I will be making this again!

I made this at work today it is absolutely delicious. I need make a couple of change though. I sauteed ground beef with the onions and added some seasonings. I mixed it with the remaining ingredients and put a scoop on an 5" puffed pastry square which I then fold and pinched like a turnover. I brushed the tops with egg whites and baked a 400 until puffed and golden.. Awesome!! Thanks Brenda

my husband wanted spinach pies like his lebanese grandma used to make ... and although i will never reach that standard, this turned out great and buttery and SUPER easy using refrigerator biscuits -- although the filling mixture should be halved for 8 grands biscuits.

i sauteed the onions and some minced garlic before adding them to the spinach/cheese mixture (husband said more onions next time), only used 1 cup of cheese (husband is fairly lactose intolerant), added some italian seasonings.  got a can of flaky biscuits and separated them into halves.  spooned mixture into center of one side, covered with the other, pressed down edges with fork.  cut 3 slits in tops.  cooked on 200 for 40 minutes which heated up the insides -- then followed biscuit baking directions (350 for 14-17 minutes) and finally broiled for a minute to get the tops brown.

will be making again soon to use up the rest of the filling.  thanks!

UPDATE:  used up rest of filling, this time made casserole-type dish.  put half biscuits on bottom of greased glass dish (had to smush them around some to get it covered), topped with spinach mixture (with extra sauteed onions added), plopped rest of biscuits on top.  cooked same amount of time.  EVEN BETTER because 1. super easy and 2. MORE spinach-y.  have already been requested again and again...

I looked at the amount of cheese in the bowl and went out and bought another 10 oz package of spinach, doubling the green stuff and the onion.

I also thought the recipe was vague about the quantity of phyllo dough (2 sheets?)  I used a 1-lb package divided 4 ways (about 10 thin sheets per roll)

This was an amazing recipe!  It was so simple and it literally took mere minutes to throw together.  I don't think it really matters what kind of cheese you use.  I used fresh spinach and this still tasted great.  It also makes for great leftovers.  I made it all for myself and it was my lunch for an entire week (plus dinner once or twice - depending on serving size, of course, but a little  bit will do ya!)  I will definitely try this again.  I might add mushrooms to it or potatoes - it was really that versatile.  Didn't use phyllo dough, per se, but I used "baking pastry dough" - it's basically the same thing.  Can't recommend enough!

I used eggbeaters and lowfat cottage cheese. I sprayed butter flavored cooking spray between the phyllo layers. My husband loved this. I also add a healthy does of garlic

This was a great recipe, and I would definitely repeat.  I marked it only four, because I also thought the cheese to spinach ratio was a bit too cheesy.  I used almost double the spinach with the same amount of cheese and that worked out great for me.  As one reviewer suggested, I tried using the crescent rolls instead of phyllo.  It didn't work out at all to do the jelly roll; the dough just didn't stick together and the filling spilled out.  With the second half of the filling, I put it in the bottom of a 9" pie pan and then covered the top with the crescent rolls.  Loved the flavor and the ease.  THANKS for a great recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I felt it was too heavy with cheese and the onion was surprisingly powerful.  I didn't think when I was adding onion that it was that much, but I think since it wasn't cooked first it dominated the flavor.  This was the first time I used phyllo dough, so I wasn't expecting it to be perfect, and it wasn't.  I rolled it up tightly, and scored it on top, but the contents still spilled out when it baked.  Not pretty. up.

Excellent!  I served this when my mom wasn't hungry and she devoured it!  Hubby even loved it.  I can't wait to make it again.  I made 4 "loaves" instead of 2 big ones.  Extremely easy to make as well!

This was pretty good - it was a little bland for my taste, but the rest of my family loved it! My only issue was that the pastry cracked while baking and the filling spilled out, so be careful about that! otherwise it was a great recipe.

Very good.  I subtracted the cottage cheese and added crumbled feta cheese.  I also added some fresh lemon juice to the mixture.  At the end, I used croissant rolls instead.  Thank you.

This recipe was amazing!  I'm a relatively inexperienced cook, but this was extremely easy to make, and was a big hit with my roommate.  I changed up a few things according to my personal tastes... I sauteed the onion first in a little bit of olive oil, and I added some Greek seasoning to the mixture (no idea what's in it, but it's got a great flavor).  I also substitued one 2-cup package of shredded Italian cheeses (comes pre-packaged and includes parmesan, asiago, romano, and mozzarella) for the parmesan and jack cheeses.
The only bit I had trouble with was the phyllo.  The pies came out nicely browned and flaky, with no spillage of the spinach mixture, but it was a little too papery for me.  I think next time I'll use puff pastry sheets or maybe even crescent roll dough like another user suggested.  I'll also add a little garlic, as I'm a HUGE fan of garlic in just about everythign!

Great recipe, though, I absolutely loved it!

I substituted one cup crumbled feta for one cup of the mozzarella cheese, which gave it a great flavor. The only problem I had was that the phyllo dough split open during baking, even when I used a triple layer of dough. I think I'll use more layers and lay the rolls next to each other in a smaller pan, so they support each other. Still, everybody raved about this, and even my kids ate it!

This was my first time using phylo dough so I need a LOT of practice! My 2 "rolls" deflated together into one "pie" looking thing.  We cut it up like pizza, though, and it tasted FABULOUS! For my family, it only fed like 3 of us, though.  It was that good! I will definitely make it again- maybe try adding ground beef and mushrooms.  AND baking it in a pie pan!  :)

I made this dish for my parents a few weekends ago.  My dad, who is a huge lover of greek food (and NEVER gives compliments on food) woofed this dish down.  My mom said he spoke about it all the way home that evening!  My husband even gave out a compliment!  Great dish!  Thanks.

Enjoyed this treat.  BUT I made a mistake.  I took the advice of others and added extra spinach - we love spinach so 
I doubled it.   I will not do this again, as the cheese mixture tasted really good and the spinach over powered it.  I will probably do recipe as written next time. Thank you ;)

Wow, I had doubts because I didn't think cottage cheese was a great ingredient.  But it was fantastic - the cottage cheese seemed liked it melded (and melted) with the other ingredients and wasn't....cottage cheesey.  My preschool kids liked it, which is rare because they are suspicious of dishes whose ingredients they can't identify.  Cheese covers a multitude of culinary sins.  Impressively easy and tasty.

Simple recipe, great ingredients, but it clearly wasn't ever tested as written.  Over two pounds of wet ingredients are supposed to be held together with just two sheets of phyllo?

This was my first time working with phyllo, so maybe I should have been able to psychically divine that two means, like, 20.  But I ended up with a giant mess.  A mess that smells delicious, but still.

Yummy! My husband loved this, he even finished all the leftovers within a day... that's a first in my house.  I did add a little bit of feta cheese to it, we like the traditional greek flavor.

The taste was good, but my filling went everywhere and the part that spilled out was inedible. I think I would also increase the spinach to cheese ratio next time.

I'm not even a fan of spinach pie, but this was yummy!  I substituted ricotta cheese for the cottage cheese, and used a mixture of parmesan and asiago cheeses instead of using all parmesan, and the flavor was incredible.  I also had a lot of trouble working with the phyllo dough, so I may make this as a quiche next time and top with sliced tomato.  Thanks for the great recipe - definitely a keeper!

I had a difficult time working with the phyllo pastry, the spinach mixture itself tasted fine, however not worth the trouble to make.

I loved these spinach pies. I had trouble with the phyllo dough, but that was probably my fault.

This was good, however the onion was too much for us. I think next time I'll use a teaspoon of Onion powder rather than chopping up onion (equivalent to what the recipe requires). The texture of the onion in this dish was a turn off for my family. But will prepare this dish again!! Thanks!

Brenda, you've got a winner of a recipe here. I'm a huge Spanakopita fan and this is very similar, but the jack cheese gave the dish a different flavor. Used low fat whipped cottage cheese which made it creamier. Thanks a heap for a great recipe!

I made it as the recipe said. me and my daughters relationship with spinach goes as far as spinach dip and thats it. We both liked this recipe a lot. The only thing I'll do different next time is not use ALL the filling. maybe 3/4ths. It was too much and kinda deformed the rolls in the oven, plus me and my daughter like to taste the pastry besides the ends.

My first time making spinach pie and this recipe was easy and turned out tasting good.  I did not have monterey cheese, used feta instead and I sauteed the onions first and did an egg wash on the dough before baking.  I will make again!

I used crescent rolls instead of phyllo dough. Very easy to make and delicious!!
