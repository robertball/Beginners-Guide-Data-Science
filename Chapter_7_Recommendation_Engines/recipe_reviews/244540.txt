Easy peasy, just the way I like it!  I opted to use peanut oil instead & just found out if you're really looking for "authentic," fry them in lard.  If feeling adventurous, you can make "taco" flavored chips by placing the hot chips in a paper bag & adding taco seasoning, a pinch of salt & feel free to add things such as hot pepper, chili powder, powdered garlic &/or or onion or my favorite; McCormick's Southwest Seasoning! (it clears your sinuses- WOOOOOOOO!!!)  If the chips are too cool for the seasoning to stick, put them on a cookie sheet in a 350ยบ oven for 5 minutes & then try this as hot oil is what helps the seasoning stick to the chips.  You can also brush them with vanilla paste or extract after frying & coat them in sugar & cinnamon.  :)  I'm thankful for this "recipe" as it means no more rushing out to WholeFoods when we get to craving nachos (they are the only ones who offer flour tortilla chips which are best for my meat, refried beans & cheese laden nachos.)  Thanks!

What's NOT to love?! Simple and delicious and you could season them any way you want. Do watch them as they are frying b/c mine took no time at all to brown, so just keep that in mind. A keeper, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a super easy quick snack! My wife loves these and they store very well in an air tight container.  I used vegetable oil the first time and the second time I used canola oil.  Either one works great!

As recipe stated - I fried.  We tried both corn and flour tortillas and decided the flour chips are superior.  About 20 seconds per side at 375 oil temp (I bought a Copper Chef multi-function cooker).  They were light, fluffy, and crispy like you get from a taco salad bowl!  Served with fresh tomato salsa, green tomatillo salsa, and fresh guac, delicious!

I added salt when they were done and I think I found a new party snack instead of wasting more money at the store on potato chips
