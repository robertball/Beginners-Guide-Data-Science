I am new to spicy food.  I added the cayenne pepper a tiny bit at a time til I got to the spice level that was good for me.  I too used prunes and doubled the amount used.  (Love them!)Served with fresh bakery Kaiser rolls.  This recipe is so great.  Sweet and spicy at the same time.  Just loved it.  Am so glad that I ran out and bought all the ingredients so I could make as written.   Thanks for sharing, Jeidippins.    Just one little suggestion...remove the bay leaves before eating!!!

I've made this many times and finally decided to review it.  This last time I made a few additions which I think made this dish even better.  First I always  double the recipe as it never lasts long and it's great as a leftover, so remember the following is for a double batch. In place of the tomato sauce I use a 28 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes drained (save the liquid)and a 6 oz. can of tomato paste.  I use 1 cup of the small pimento stuffed olives measured after chopping.  In addition to the raisins I add a 4.5 oz. box of pitted prunes chopped. A yellow or red bell pepper in place of the green. Add 1 cup of the liquid from the drained tomatoes to a small pot with 1/2 cup of Quinoa and cook as directed.  Once cook add to the other ingredients in Step 2 along with a small can of chopped Portobello mushrooms.  I like mine spicey but do as others have suggested and add the cayenne a little at a time or eliminate and use Rotel diced tomatoes with green chillis.

The cayenne pepper was too much for my tastes so I gave the recipe 4 stars. I even added less than called for. I will add twice the amount of raisins next time. Very yummy!

Perhaps one of the best recipes I have made from this site.  Very authentic.  Works great with nacho chips, as a sloppy joe type of sandwich or just a dish served with rice.

Jeidi, thank you for a wonderful recipe! It is so tasty! , just like the one my grandmother prepared when I was growing up. She prepared picadillo with ground beef but your recipe is so good I did not even noticed the difference. This is a keeper.

The combination of ingredients seemed wierd to me at first (olives, black beans, raisins!?), but when it all came together, it was delicious.  We served it over rice.

This is delicious... the only thing that I would change to give it 5 stars would be to add more raisins (double them) and olives and less cayenne. I used one tbsp and it was way to spicy. I ate it plain and it was good alone.

i did a lot of different things to this but the main concept was kept..... thats why i gave it 5 stars cause its SO versatile... i used garbanzo beans,added a can of diced tomatoes,  peas and believe it or not i diced a sweet potato and threw that in there also!!! EVERYBODY had seconds....and it was healthy so you dont feel guilty!!  wonderful staple

Very tasty. The ingredients reminded me of Chicken Marbella which I love. I substituted chopped prunes for raisins, otherwise I prepared it exactly as written and served it with brown rice. My picky toddlers ate it.

As someone who does not cook nor knows how to cook. I must say this recipe was delicious. Thus far, I've made it twice and it does not disappoint. However, my first try I was missing a few ingredients: bay leaves, cumin and cayenne pepper. I simply just added salt and pepper instead and it was delicious! 

However, during my second try, I actually used cayenne pepper and it was way too overpowering and spicy. I couldn't actually taste the picadillo. My advice is to try it without it and if you'd like a kick, slowly put cayenne until you reach your desired taste. I had to add brown sugar to offset the cayanne pepper. Overall, I will begin to actually cook lol and will begin making this more often. 

Thank you so much for sharing!

this was pretty good but missing something.. i think i was expecting the olives and capers to be more pronounced.. i subbed dried cherries for the raisins and probably should have doubled them as i doubled the beans.. i reduced the cayenne to 1/4 tsp and could have gone up to 1/2 tsp.. 2 would have been way too much.. i should have seasoned the turkey as it was cooking b/c it was lacking something in the final product.. i salted to taste and added some onion powder at the end.. condiments will be added

As others have suggested if I make this recipe again I would double the raisins and olives.  I thought it was ok, my husband ate it but said not to make it again.  I would give it a C+ and would play around with it to make it better if I decided to make it again. I wish I would have read the reviews before I cooked it.

Really yummy! I love that it's a one pan dish. I don't know what's wrong with me that I feel the need to double these types of recipes and I did, but it was unnecessary. Happy to have left-overs though! I didnt' use raisins because I just don't like them. Served over brown rice. Thanks jeidipippins.

I've made this recipe many times. I usually make double the amount and freeze, which works out great. I don't add as much cayenne as the recipe calls for, instead I just put a pinch in and I omit the raisins and capers. That makes it not as authentic, but this is one of my family's favorite meals and I'm so happy I came across this recipe.

Delicious!  I had never heard of Picadillo and stumbled upon this recipe when looking for something utilizing ground turkey - what a find!  My whole family loved it!!  I did reduce the cayenne to 1/4 tsp for my kids taste, but it still had a little kick, and it already has a lot of flavor from the other ingredients.  I also added a can of drained chopped tomatoes and served it over brown rice.  This is definitely a keeper and will be made again and again.  Thank you!!!

I made this as the recipe directs with one small change, less cayanne because my husband does not like foods that are too spicy hot.  My whole family enjoyed this dish on top of burger buns as well as with rice!  The flavors are so rich and yummy!

Add a can of diced tomatoes, and it becomes what we call "cuban chil"i ... ummmm!  The family is more likely to like something called, "chili' than 'picadillo'.

I didn't have green olives so I substituted black, which probably detracted from the authenticity, but this was still delicious. Also, I used a little more than a pound of ground turkey (about 20 ounces) and I also used the whole can of black beans, and cut back a little on the cayenne. The end result was very tasty! A definite keeper.

I enjoyed this "Turkey Picadillo II"; however, I had issues trying to brown the turkey (the way hubby likes it). Thank you jeidipippins for sharing your recipe.

I love this dish.  It’s one of my favorites. I’ve made it several times.  The only change I made was to add more green olives and a red pepper instead of a green one.  It is delicious.

Have made this for years. It's a family favorite. My recipe version doesn't include black beans or wine and it uses golden raisins which I really think makes it so good!! I'll try adding the black beans and wine next time.

Although I forgot the white wine, it turned out great. We ate some with Brown Rice and some with Whole Grain pasta.

My family is from the Dominican republic so I grew up eating picadillo made with ground beef. I don’t purchase ground beef in my home (I use ground turkey for everything) so when I found this recipe I was thrilled to try it. I must say it is absolutely easy and delicious!! I’ve been making this for years now—and quite often at least once a month—my husband and two kids (they were ages 2&3 when I started giving this to them) ALWAYS ask for seconds. I do double most of the recipe (2LBS of turkey and one full can of beans), omit the spice bc of kids, and have a nice amount of leftovers, which everyone loves. Deliciosa, sabrosa receta Caribeña/Cubana. FIVE STARS!

ITS DELICIOUS!!! I could not believe how healthy is it compared to such big flavor.  My kids asked me to make it every week, and I sure will. The only thing I would change is adding less cayenne pepper, it was too spicy for the kids. I'd recommend just adding half the serving. Oh! Also, I like more raisins in it too. You will love it!

i was trying to find another way to cook turkey -- we don't really eat beef.  my mother in law used to make this for her family with beef, but she passed away before leaving me her recipe.  my husband really liked it, but his mom used to make it with potatoes....i may add those next time.  i, too, doubled the olives and raisins.  i think it was better the next day!

Great recipe, so rich and flavorful! Husbo didn't even know it was turkey.  I added few packets of Sazon, and extra olives, capers and raisins.  So yummy!

Wow, my mouth dropped as I watched my boys 10 & 12 eat this without any hesitation.I would not tell them anything that was in it (still won't) but was surprised because they always complain about black beans, never eat raisins and forget capers (I chopped these up small). I only added 3/4 tsp of cayenne and that was their only complaint- I didn't make it spicy enough.We ate it with Spanish rice & flour tortillas. This will for sure be made from now on. The other plus, they didn't even realize they were eating turkey. Win Win Thank you for sharing!

This "Turkey Picadillo II" was a tasty treat! I had to make mine making substitutions based on what I had on hand: ground chicken (instead of ground turkey); red peppers (instead of green peppers); and black olives (instead of green olives). It looked beautiful! I used only 1 teaspoon of cayenne. If I were to make this dish again, I would fry the spices with the poultry to take the raw edge off my freshly-ground cumin and to give the poultry some color (it never browned despite adding extra fat). Thank you jeidipippins for sharing your recipe.

This was completely unmemorable to me but the husband really liked it.  However, it seems mostly healthy so that is a bonus.  Forgot the capers unfortunately. Served it over brown rice.

Reduce Cayanne to 1 t. for more reasonable spice level. Love it otherwise and have made it many times.

Easy to make and very unique tasting. Be careful if you're not a spicy hot food person. Even 1/2 tsp of cayenne is enough to give a fair bite!! So much that it almost drowned out the other flavors for me. My cayenne was a newly opened spice so maybe it had more heat to it?? I'm feeding this to my toddler later so I think I will have to doctor it a bit as he may not like the ending tingle it leaves in your mouth. I didn't catch the salty/sweet even though I doubled the raisins. I would say start off with 1/4 tsp of cayenne and you can always add more if you want to dose it down with the rest of the wine! :)

I'd never eaten a picadillo before, so I didn't know what made it a "picadillo".  It was very tasty.  Olives and raising.  Interesting flavors.

Very satisfying and easy to make. I have never been a green olive fan, but didn't mind at all because all the flavors are in perfect harmony. I added a bit more raisins because they're just so delightful.

I like to follow the recipes people share to give a rating. This was a good and easy recipe to follow. I wanted to know if (Hinode) calrose med grain w/ rice or mashed potatoes would work best. well they both went over great . i will now use this as a base to over and over to build on. now thats goood! thanks, chefboyartie

Yum! This was a lot more flavorful than I anticipated. The salty olive and sweet raisin combo is delicious. I even mistakenly added a can of kidney beans instead of black beans, didn't add olive brine, and forgot the capers. It still tasted great (even better when I remembered to add the capers!) I will make this again, next time following the directions.

Wow, was this good. I've never had anything like it and both my husband and I really enjoyed it. Next time, I'll go easy on the cayenne pepper. The only change I made to this recipe was doubling the raisins (I love them). I posted a pic of the deliciousness and will definitely be making this again. Thanks!
