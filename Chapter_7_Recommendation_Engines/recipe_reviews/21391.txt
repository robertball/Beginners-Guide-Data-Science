This was unbelievably delicious with roasted garlic. To roast garlic: slice the top portion off a head of garlic and remove excess papery skin. Drizzle olive oil on top and season with salt. Wrap garlic tightly in foil and place in oven preheated at 375F for 35 minutes. I scaled this recipe down to 6 servings using a 3-pound bag of new red potatoes.

I'm the author of this recipe, and I just wanted a add a couple of notes.  Do NOT use margarine with the recipe, they will come out dry.  Make sure you drain the potatoes very well, drop the butter in first, give it a couple of mashes and add the rest of the ingredients.  This will help with the consistency.  Do NOT overmash or they will get sticky.  There should be a few small chunks of potato in the mix when you are done.  I know a lot of people do not like raw garlic (I do!), as other reviewers have noted, you may like it better with roasted garlic.  Do not add the garlic to the boiling potato water, or you'll end up with almost no garlic flavor at the end.  When scaling the recipe, use the "scale recipe" feature on the recipe page to reduce the chance of any math errors.  IF you decide to reduce the butter and add milk... the milk MUST be added after you mash in the butter, or the butter will not bind properly with the starch in the potatoes and you'll end up with a weird consistency.

One more review hardly seems worth it - so many have already praised this dish.  But I'm adding my 2 cents anyhow: Very good - VERY garlicky. 
I, too, scaled it down for 10 people. Red potatoes boil up very nicely and make it easy to use your blender on them once they're done. I very much liked the strong garlic taste - but a few of my guests did not.  However, one did ask for the recipe, and that rarely happens. I did not use quite so much butter as the recipe wanted - I used 2 sticks for the 5 lb of potatoes. After all was said and done, it was more like creamed potatoes than mashed. But I liked it a lot. 
My suggestion on the garlic: next time I make these, I plan on blanching (boiling) the garlic.  This, too, will cut down on the rawness of it without killing the flavor. I would suggest putting in the garlic with the boiling potatoes during the last 10 min of boling as this would both flavor the potatoes and tone down the garlic as well.

Yes, I completely changed the recipe, but I wanted to review it anyway to express my appreciation for the concept.  I made one serving and just eyeballed the amounts of ingredients to my preference.  I used russett potatoes, parmesan, margarine, and milk.  I boiled the garlic along with the potatoes, which resulted in a loss of all garlic flavour.  Next time I will try oven roasting the garlic, instead.  This was an enjoyable recipe and a nice change from the norm.

ETA:  The pungent carmelized flavour of oven roasted garlic was fantastic!  I peeled the cloves of garlic and placed them in the centre of a doubled piece of aluminum foil.  I drizzled extra virgin olive oil over the garlic and closed the foil, leaving a small vent for steam to escape at the top.  I placed this onto a pie plate and then into the oven to roast alongside my meatloaf at 375F for approximately 45 minutes.

Absolutely unbelievable!  So easy to make and turned out perfect. Instead of chopped garlic, I simply roasted a bulb of garlic in the oven, mashed it and added it right in. That way the garlic was more mellow and not overpowering.  I was a bit nervous that the recipe didn't call for milk, but DON'T WORRY... the butter will make up for it!  I added a bit too much (16oz - 4 sticks) and they still came out PERFECT!  I used fresh grated romano cheese that I bought at the store in a little tub in the cheese section.  Even those who don't like skin-on potatoes raved about them! Virtually foolproof and exquisite!

I have a similiar recipe, however I boil the garlic with the potatoes and just mash them together, which leaves lots of garlic taste without biting into raw garlic.

A unique and exciting flavor. The preparation was easy and didn't take long at all. I made it for my friends and they were all trying to figure out what the extra kick was, it was the Oregano. It goes nicely in these potatoes. I made a couple of minor changes: I added a 1/4 cup of sliced garlic cloves when there was 5 minutes left to boil, this helps soften them up. If you are scaling this recipe down to 10 servings I recommend boiling for only 35-40 minutes.  Enjoy... (It's very good!)

My daughter made these potatoes to see if they were as good as my garlic mashed potatoes--we both agreed it was a big dud.  It would be infinitely better if you put the whole garlic cloves in the water with the potatoes as they cook.  This infuses the potatoes with lots of garlic flavor, and the cloves mash right into the potatoes.  Also, oregano in mashed potatoes is just not good at all.  We didn't even finish the 4 servings it was scaled down to!

WOW! These are some great potatoes!! I really don't like the taste of raw garlic, so I used the equivalent amount of roasted garlic, and also substitued Italian seasoning for the oregano.  These are fabulous and actually very easy and fast.  Will definitely make again and again, especially when I want to impress!

I added 8oz of cream cheese and 1 cup of sour cream.  I used fresh romano cheese but it was definitely overpowering.  I recommend using half the amount of romano cheese if you are grating your own and if you are not a HUGE garlic fan, but like the taste, use half the garlic as well.  All in all a recipe I will keep, but it needs a little more tweaking...

Like this recipe needs another review, but I have to comment. I scaled this recipe down to 5 servings, and followed it to the T. Excellent!! This puts mashed potatoes everywhere to shame. Even my fiance loved them...and he's very picky. He doesnt like anything out of the ordinary...just a basic meat and potatoes kinda guy. But, he ate 3 servings of these, and was upset when they were gone! I made it as a side to my own meatloaf recipe (Karie's Meatloaf). They went together perfectly!! I dont understand why people completely change a recipe and then rate it to THEIR changes. Or comment saying it was too much of this or that. They know their own tastes. So if a recipe calls for a certain amount of something, and they know they dont like it...lessen the amount to your families tastes! Try this recipe...you wont be disappointed! I will never make regular mashed potatoes again :o)

These are great potatoes!!  I cooked the potatoes with the garlic and it made for a wonderful flavor.  I also added a little extra salt and a little milk.  Will make these all the time!

Well, the secret is out and this definitely is a great recipe for garlic mashed potatoes! I was a bit skeptical because there was no milk but I gave it a try and am glad I did. This was a nice departure from traditional mashed potatoes. I cut this back to 2 servings for a pound of red skin potatoes and used a combination of Parmesan and Romano cheeses. Thanks for sharing AUSTAD!

I scaled this recipe down to 8 servings.  Added fresh parsley and chives and a dash of milk.  My family does not like smooth mashed potatoes so I left them quite lumpy.  A good side dish on a chilly autumn day.

Quite gourmet with little effort. I didn't chance the comments about the garlic overtaking the dish so I made an adjustment there.  Additionally, I cut the cheese down by 1 ounce (I didn't want cheese to dominate either)  I used 3 sticks of butter because I didnt want to measure out,  I used 1tsp of oregano because we don't like alot of this spice,  Plus I roasted a head of garlic (cut off top of head drissle with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, wrap in foil and bake 375 for 35min).  Mash the garlic before you mix with potatoes.  I also didn't have red potatoes so just used white & peeled.

Omg, these were so good. My husband went back for thirds. I cut the recipe down to 6 servings. I added extra cheese and used 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of the 2 sticks recommended. I aslo roasted the garlic before adding it to the potatoes. **FYI, if your in a hurry( like I always am) you can roast garlic in the microwave. Peel the excess paper off and trim the top off the garlic head exposing the individual cloves. Lather the entire head in olive oil. Place on paper towel and microwave for 30 seconds or less. Flip garlic on other side and microwave another 30 seconds or less. Be careful not to overcook though. It'll be like chewy cardboards. Then just squeeze gently and the garlic cloves come out easily.

These tasted great, but I put in more butter than the recipe called for and they still came out a little dry.  I had leftovers, so while heating them up, I threw in even more butter.  That made the consistency *much* better, but I had to use almost half a stick.  Will remember that when I make them on Thanksgiving, or if I have milk on hand next time, I'll add that.  Thanks!

I did this recipe for 2 lbs of small red potatoes. I used a 1/2 cup of butter, 2 oz of romono cheese, and 3 cloves of garlic, which was less than a tablespoon, a tsp. of salt and a tsp. of oregano. The whole family enjoyed these potatoes including my 18 yr old son who never eats them in restaurants. He said I could make them again. I don't thikn our family would want the full amount of garlic. I will definately make these again!

First of all, i have to say in AUSTAD's note at the top of his recipe it says that this is a secret mashed potato recipe from an Italian restaurant... I have never been to an italian restaurant that has served mashed potatoes. Second of all, the recipe as is (for a serving of 10 or under) is good. Was not to fond of the oregano. Made the recipe again after reading the reviews and I did roast the bulb of garlic, used Parsley instead of oregano, I used Parmesan/Romano cheese, and instead of using milk i used a evaporated milk. definitely not the kind to make if the guests are expecting gravy on them, but over all after getting asked for the recipe by lots of people I say now it is fantastic!! 
P.S. I read a lot of reviews that said this recipe was way to salty. Might I recommend using unsalted butter when making this. Or before you add the one salt ingredient you might want to taste the potatoes and see if they at least need the salt before ruining it and decide serving a salt rock. Hope this helps.

Very tasty! Did two things differently- added a bit of fresh parsley, to brighten the flavor of the oregano; also, grated the garlic with my microplane grater (which was already being used for the Romano anyway!) This was really, really good- rave reviews from the whole family!

These potatoes are really great and I've never made potatoes from scratch before! Also FYI: Under the directions at the bottom of each recipe there is a feature called customize this recipe. You can change the number of servings and click submit and Allrecipes does the work for you! The new recipe will tell you the proper measurements for the # of servings you choose. Don't you just love this site?!

Scaled this down to 8 servings.  Guess it lost something in the scale-down, because no one in my family liked these potatoes.

A shame that this recipe used to be a secret. Gorgeous taste, especially for the garlic lover in you. Recommend changing nothing in this recipe.

Ok, I was in a rush so I made it with instant mashed potatoes and jarred minced garlic.  It was delish!  I also nuked the garlic for 30 seconds to mello it a bit and skipped the oregano so my kids would eat it.  Very good!

A pot full of heaven! This recipe is incredibly easy & tasty, and hard to mess up. A wonderful surprise from very little effort! My house smelled like an italian restaurant (thanks to the roasted garlic) and this dish was restaurant quality! I scaled down to 2.5# red potatoes, scrubed and cubed. Boiled ~ 20mins. 1 cup italian cheese (all I had!), 1 stick butter, salt & pepper, and 4 cloves of roasted garlic (thanks to other reviewers -- smashed garlic to remove skins. salt & pepper. drizzle olive oil. wrapped up in foil. baked for 30 minutes. minced into potatoes). Although next time I think I'll use less garlic (hubby is not a garlic fan at all). I don't think you need to measure the ingredients at all, toss in some cheese, butter, s&p, and garlic to your liking. ALSO.. these are not meant to be creamy and smooth like regular mashed potatoes. Chunky is better. Don't add milk! You're going in the wrong direction from the intended recipe. I promise it's wonderful the way it's written! Enjoy!

I planned on making these at dinner and totally forgot to buy romano cheese.  I had parmesan in the fridge so I used that instead and the potatoes were amazing.  If you cut the potatoes smaller you can cut the boiling time in half.

I used run of the mill white potatoes this time and overall was very pleased with the outcome. The oregano was a nice (unexpected by many) touch. I first scaled the recipe down to 8. I also **roasted an entire bulb of garlic then added 1 tsp of garlic salt rather than salt to the recipe while mashing. I added one cup of fresh grated parmesan. I think next time I'll try a 1/2 cup of heavy cream to add that little extra creamy texture that I missed this time. Did I say that I loved the oregano?? That's why the 5 stars! (whoda thunk?) Oh, and just for a fresh little crunch, I also tossed in a handfull of chopped green onion. Yum!  **Roasted Garlic = slice off bottom portion of garlic bulb. drizzle with EVOO and S & P to taste. Wrap tightly in foil - cut side up - and roast on 375 for 30 minutes. Mash with fork before mixing in well with potatoes.  I served with a Prime Rib recipe I found in here. What a meal!!

Unbelievable!! This is by far the best recipe for garlic mashed potatoes that I have ever come across (and believe me, I have  been searching). The blend of the garlic, oregano and romano cheese was just perfect. I made these as my dish for our company Thanksgiving Potluck and they won the prize for best dish. People were actually fighting over who was going to take home the leftovers. Thank you for ending the search for the perfect mashed potatoes.

Like almost everyone else, I didn't need to cook for 100 (wondering how often home cooks make mashed potatoes for 100...? But I digress). I used 3lbs potatoes and 4 tablespoons (1/2 a stick) of butter, plus a few splashes of milk and 2 spoon-fulls of fat free sour cream to make up for the lack of butter... Just couldn't bring myself to add that much butter! I used a whole head of roasted garlic and then added a spoon-full of minced garlic too. I've never been a huge fan of garlic mash because I'm a purist and love plain ol' mashed taters, but the BF requested garlic. It was a good call on his part - these were DELICIOUS!

These are awesome.  Will definitely make again and again.  I don't know the restaurant these are supposed to be from, but one of my xmas guests did, exclaiming "these are EXACTLY like the potatoes at yada yada".  

A couple people commented that there was perhaps too much garlic, but I thought they were perfect so I won't be modifying it to suit them.  They'll have to learn to deal!  

A keeper!!

These potatoes were definitely nothing to write home about. Luckily I added the ingredients slowly so I didn't end up adding all the cheese and garlic. The flavor from the romano cheese over powered everything else. If I made this again I would use less garlic and a different type of cheese.

Husband said he thought these were the best he'd ever had....so there ya go.  :)

On my side I halved the butter and did a mix of parmesan and romano.  I also followed the suggestion of another reviewer and roasted the garlic - although differently than she suggested.  I strip each clove down and drizzle with olive oil then wrap loosely with foil - but the foil is completely closed so all steam would stay inside the pouch - and roast for 40 minutes at 375 F.

So glad I tried this - it's easy and tastes great!  I mashed with a potato ricer, and with extra stirring the consistency was on the thick side, but good.  I used 5 lbs potatoes, 6 oz butter, 1/2 cup romano, 2 T + 1-1/4 t garlic from a jar, 1-1/4 t salt and 1-1/4 t oregano.  This is proportionally half the added ingredients in the recipe as shown and it was still very tasty.  My kids ages 9 and 6 LOVED it.  Will definitely make again and again.

These were very good, but I did change a few things.  I tried the recipe the way it stands and I wasn't impressed, so I tried it my way.  I roasted the garlic and added some milk.  I turned out so much better for our tastes...Thanks for the post.

This is an INSANELY GOOD recipe.  I've never had better mashed potatoes (well, next to my grandmother's, anyway -- and I don't have her recipe!).  I'm not even a huge garlic enthusiast (although my husband is), and I couldn't get over how wonderful this dish was.  Everyone raved.  Thanks so much!!!

I make garlic mashed potatoes all the time because they are requested from me but this just doesn't come out right for me at all. I don't know what it is but I tried doing it exactly the first time and no dice!! Sorry!! I did try this with roasted garlic and it's much better and I also put sliced garlic in with the potatoes to cook and it was much better. As far as the butter going in first, I always melt my butter in the milk and add it together and it turns out every time.

This was a huge hit at a dinner party I had with friends and family!  I paired it with baked pork chop recipe from this site that got rave reviews and everyone said the meal was so home cooked and delicious that they felt like it was Thanksgiving!  I was told this was a keeper and that from now on when someone wants mashed potatoes their going to call me!  I made this as is, no changes except to lower from 100 servings to 12.  There were no potatoes left and the gravy sauce from the baked pork chops went well with the mashed potatoes.  Great job on this recipe!

I scaled this down to 10 servings and they were enjoyed by everybody. I also used minced garlic since this is what I keep on hand. I still prefer my recipe which uses cream cheese and sour cream, but these were yummy and easy to make. Thank you for submitting this recipe.

I have only eaten garlic mashed potatoes in restaurants and this recipe makes it super easy to make them at home. I too, roasted the garlic but other than that followed exactly. The only thing i will do differently next time is to add a bit of milk to moisten slightly. Delicious side dish.

These are much better if you boil the garlic with the potatoes rather than adding it in later.

WOW... these were amazing!  I scaled the recipe down to 8 & it turned out great!  I added milk to make them creamier.  I also took some suggestions that were posted about reducing the amount of garlic (wished I hadn't, but oh well!).  I also used a little less Romano cheese than called for as it's quite a strong cheese.  I added the cheese after they were mashed to avoid any gumminess.  The entire family raved about them!!

How can I review this to finally suit the Allrecipes staff? We liked the recipe very much, but I had to reduce the amount of potatoes, because that seemed to be an excessive amount of potatoes, to serve 10 people.

I loved this recipe, but DH was indifferent which is why I rated it a four.  Obviously, we cut the recipe down significantly, here are the measurements I used.  1.5 lbs of red potatoes (skin on), 2 large cloves of garlic, 1/3 cup butter, 1/4 cup of table cream (we found the potatoes were a bit dry) and 1/3 cup freshly grated Romano cheese.  I also used about 1.5 tbsp of dried chives in lieu of the oregano.

These are wonderful!  Try scaling it down to 4 servings -- that was just the right size for my family of 2 adults and 2 children.  And we still had a few leftovers.
The only thing I did different was to roast my garlic before adding.  
Roasting garlic is really easy, by the way.  Just take a whole head of garlic and place it in a large piece of aluminum foil.  Drizzle with a little olive oil and salt and pepper.  Completely close the foil around garlic and throw in a 400 degree oven for about 30-45 minutes.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  Just try squeezing the garlic -- if it feels soft, it's done!

BRAVO!  I scaled this down for 10 servings, but only two people showed up making our dinner party a total of four.  We have MAYBE 3 servings left.  These potatoes are incredible.  Other reviewers suggested roasting the garlic, which I did.  That gave it a wonderful taste.  I also added some milk to thin them out.  My husband didn't care for the first taste and smell, but I think he wasn't used to the romano and garlic.  Later when I served it - he raved about them along with our friends who made several trips back to get more.  I will certainly make these again!

I scaled the recipe to 5 servings and absolutely love it!  The cheese I used was a Ramano/Parmasan mix and it turned out wonderfully!
I'm rescaling the recipe for Mother's Day, for 12! Yummy!

These were pretty good, had the garlic not been so strong and the potatoes not so dry.  Next time, I'll halve the garlic and roast it and add heavy cream.

I cut this down to six servings. I served this with Evin's My Daddy's Meatloaf and BLT Caesar Salad. Every bit of this was eaten. Excellent when paired with the gravy made with the meatloaf. True comfort food.

These were so delicious! I scaled down the recipe using the calculator for a family of 4. I used 2 lbs red potatoes, 3 tabl. butter, 4 oz. romano cheese, 1 tabl. garlic, 1/4 tea salt, and 1/2 tea oregano. They came out great!!!

I used the same ingredients and found it was dry so added 2% milk which did the trick. I found that you can use Red potatoes or russet potatoes, either potato will work

very good, scaled the serving size down quite a bit.  i would do everything as directed with the exception of adding less garlic. i like garlic but this was WOAH.  i would whip the potatoes using 1/2 the recommended amount and add more to taste.

These are absolutely incredible...however, there are a few additions that I always make whenever we have these: sour cream, heated milk, and shredded mozerrella cheese (in addition to the Romano since my husband LOVES creamy & cheesy mashed potatoes!) But this recipe is still excellent without those additions. THANKS FOR SHARING!

Very tasty. Scaled to 8 servings and used 4# of red potatoes, used the minced garlic in the jar from the produce section, but went ahead and chopped even finer with my Pampered Chef chopper and then roasted in foil in the oven. Used 2 sticks of butter and still found the need to add 1 cup of heated milk. Also added pepper. Some reviewers had mentioned that there was too much cheese; I did not think so and hubby asked if I had forgotten to put it in if that tells you anything! All in all this was a 4.5 for us. Our guests enjoyed but did not ask for the recipe. Will make again.

Loved it!  My butter wasn't room temp and it still seemed to turn out fine.  I cut it into one inch blocks and added it to the warm pan then put the warm potatoes on top to help melt the butter.  Also, I didn't have Romano so I used a shredded Italian cheese blend from a bag.  Delicious!  I will be making this again.  Thanks!

This dish has quickly become a favorite in our home. I of course changed the serving size to four but that was not enough. I have increased it to six servings so everyone will get their fill. Plus this recipe is so easy and quick. That is a bonus for our busy life because it is still important for our family to eat dinner together. This is just another recipe to help us do just that. Thanks for sharing!

The only change I made was to roast the garlic in the oven at 350 degrees for 15 or so minutes before putting it in the potatoes. Goodness, this is my default Mashed Potatoes Recipe for life!

I just made a batch of these last night but scaled it down to 6 serving and oh my goodness they are awesome!!! I used to just put garlic powder, salt, pepper, and butter in mine, but I followed the other reviews for roasted garlic and it definitely adds a whole lot more flavor to them!! The combination of the ramono cheese, oregano, and roasted garlic just can't be beat!! I will never make plain old regular mashed potatoes again!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Scaled to 10 servings. Guessed on the amount of butter and cheese. Didn't add oregano. Roasted a head of garlic...probably would roast more for even 10 servings. Didn't chop it up well enough maybe. Delicious!

Very good but like others I boiled the garlic cloves with the potatoes and mushed it all together.  When cooking you really shouldn't measure your seasonings as mentioned on recipes. You should sprinkle and taste until it's good according to your own taste buds. ~Thanks~

The amount of butter in this recipe is absolutly ridiculous. I love the taste of butter but there is no need for so much of it even in this large recipe. Also the garlic does need to be roasted or the pungent strong taste is a bit overwhelming and I totally LOVE garlic. I substituted whole milk for half of the butter and used a bit more garlic (roasted). They tasted great. I think I would gag if I had used all of the butter. And I also love butter.

Delicious! I didn't have Romano cheese on hand, so I used Fontina and Parmigiano-Reggiano. I also happened to be roasting garlic, so I used that. Turned out great!

Rated 4 stars because I believe it's better with roasted garlic.  To roast garlic, preheat oven to 400.  Peel some paper off entire head of garlic and cut off about a quarter of an inch of the top of the bulb.  Lay it on a piece of foil and drizzle with with EVOO, salt and pepper.  Seal the foil and bake for 35 minutes.  Let it cool and squeeze the roasted garlic cloves right out of the skins.  Smash up the tender garlic and add it to your taters.  Note that I scaled my recipe back for 10 servings which uses 5 pounds of potatoes.  That's a lot of potatoes.  I also added some half and half because they get pretty starchy.  It makes them a little creamier.  You'll absolutely love these and so will your other partakers!

We loved these sooo very much! I scaled this down to 10 servings , made as written except I decided to roast a whole bulb of elephant garlic and added that instead of it just minced. I also was skeptical that there isn't any milk or cream added, so I fought the urge to add it and it does not need it at all. If you use the butter called for, the milk is never missed. The addition of the freshly grated Romano is just simply delicious with the flavors in these potatoes. I received many compliments on this dish. These were served with Chicken Marsala Flroentine from this site. I will use this recipe often :)

I found this recipe one year ago and have been making these potatoes exclusively ever since. Every time they are a knock out. People ask me for the recipe, complement on how insanely tasty they are, and ask for more. However, like many others, I alter the recipe slightly. First off, I always roast the garlic cloves in olive oil and a bit of water in a small ramekin inside the toaster oven at 300 degrees until the cloves are softened. Because roasting mellows the flavor, I typically use more garlic than is called for. Also, "I can't believe it's not butter" is used in place of the real deal and I usually only use 2/3 of what the recipe calls for. A mix of parmesan, romano, and asiago cheeses is thrown in to the batch, also in reduced portions. Pepper and parsley is added as a personal preference. The result? Healthier potatoes without sacrificing texture or flavor. The only bad thing about roasting fresh garlic is the smell left to linger on my fingers. It serves as a reminder of how awesome the potatoes are, though! I can't get enough!

Can't say enough about these potatoes!  Followed the recipe the first time which was great, but changed the second time to make healthier but still amazing!  I only used one stick of light butter for 5 lbs of potatoes (land o'lakes, half the fat all the taste) used about 3 T. of the butter to saute the garlic for about 5-7 min.  I would decrease the garlic a tad if serving for company and you're not sure if they love garlic.  This really brought out all the flavor of the garlic, added it to potatoes and put about 1 cup of whole milk into the pan to warm it up.  Only needs about 30 seconds.  You may need more milk depending on the consistancy you like.  Omitted the oregano (good with but better without).  Have also made it with and without the Romano.  Both ways are great!  I also added freshly ground pepper and then mashed with a potato masher.  Yummy!!

These are the most wonderful mashed potatoes I have ever had!  That said, I did make a few changes: peeled the potatoes (hate skins), added a touch of milk, little less butter, and roasted a whole head of garlic instead of raw.  They were so rich and delicious!  I'll always make mashed potatoes this way from now on.

Fantastic! I was skeptical about making this recipe; I've never made mashed potatoes without milk. According to my husband, they were the best he's EVER had. I prefer a slightly thicker consistency to my potatoes, but the flavor was excellent. I boiled the garlic with the potatoes as other reviewers suggested. I also scaled it down to 6 servings. Next time I'm going to start with much less butter and add more if needed.

ALMOST PERFECT!!  This is a wonderful recipe for a creamy smooth flavourful mashed potato dish.  I liked the addition of the cheese which elevated this from a plain old side dish to a wonderful accompainment to any gourmet meal.  I roasted the garlic wrapped in foil at 400 for 30 minutes since I was already roasting squash for another meal.  Roasting made the garlic flavour more subtle without the bite you get from raw.  I ended up having to use swiss cheese since I couldn't find romano but this did not seem to detract from the recipe.  I did find it a tad bit salty but this could be due to a miscalculation when reducing the recipe measurements.  Nonetheless I will use less salt next time.  Other than that, it's a definite keeper.

OMG! If there were mashed potatoes in heaven they would taste like this!  The oregano really makes the difference.  I too roasted the garlic (only 7 minutes) and then added to the boiling potatoes in the last 10 minutes.  The garlic flavor was kicking but not overpowering. Thank you for this keeper of a recipe!!!

super! I did add some milk and used sharp white cheddar (that's what I had) and zapped the chopped garlic in the microwave with about 1/2 t olive oil before adding it to the potatoes since I prefer my garlic cooked. 
Great flavor. Thanks

These were pretty good.  I would adjust the cooking time to the size of your potatoes.  Mine were done in about 25 minutes.  I think next time I make these I will try a different type of cheese.  The Romano was good, but I think asiago or cheddar would be better.

I was able to make this for 4 servings, and even that worked out very well.  My boyfriend raved and I really enjoyed it.  This is definitely the best home-made mashed potatoes I've ever had.  It was extremely easy, however, I would recommend chopping the garlic into as tiny pieces as possible.  Every once in a while I would bite in to a bigger piece and it is too strong that way.

the first time i made this, i did not have any cheese on hand.  bad mistake.  the cheese adds so much to this recipe, don't even bother making these without them.  the recipe didn't say anything about roasting or cooking the garlic bits and they were too crunchy and made the flavor too strong.  the second time i made it was MUCH better.  i used both freshly grated parmesan and romano cheese and half and half since i had no butter.  the half and half made it very creamy and with less guilt than using all that butter.  i also used garlic salt to taste rather than fresh garlic because i was too lazy to roast them.  this is a good recipe but as it required so many changes, i now use the traditional mashed potatoes recipe on this site (which uses both butter and milk and has a creamier texture) and season with garlic salt to get the garlic flavor and it works a lot better.

Wonderful smashed potatoes!!!
I took other reviewer's advice to boil the garlic with the potatoes. Good idea.
My dinner guests loved this dish, and I barely have enough leftovers to revel in the goodness tomorrow.
This is now my dinner party "secret weapon".

This recipe is awesome... no leftovers.  I did make some adjustments, (as well as scale down the recipe for 4).  I cut the butter down to almost half,  added garlic cloves to the boiling water  because they soften and mash well.  Then I left out the extra salt because the boiling water is already salted. A great recipe to please company!

Love it, I roast the garlic, and use whatever cheese I like, not quite as much butter as called for, and a bit of the water from the boiled spuds if too dry, and the recipe is delicious.

Absolutely delicious!  I made these to go with my rosemary-scented pork loin stuffed with garlic, apricots and cranberries.  The potatoes were a dense and a bit sticky though.  Next time I will add a bit of milk.  The garlic was fantastic, though I worried it might have been a bit too much for my parents.  This recipe is definitely a keeper for life!

This was a great method, and very easy.  It was my first time making garlic mashed potatoes, and I admit I made a few changes. I could not bring myself to use oregano--I was afraid it would overpower the dish; instead, I used an ample amount of freshly ground black pepper.  Also, the potatoes looked very dry when I was done, so I added about 3/4 c sour cream (for 3 lbs potatoes).  The sour cream really made a difference--these potatoes were wonderful.  The aroma was tantalizing, and the flavor and texture were perfect.  And so easy!!  I'll make these often.  Thanks for posting.

Had good flavor but will probably not make again.  Good for a side dish though.  And a word of advice :  Don' use stand up mixer to mash or else potatoes will turn out gooey.

Although I did enjoy these potatoes I wouldn't say that they're the best I've ever tasted.  I ended up using parmesan instead of romano since that's all I had on hand and maybe that had an affect on the taste.  My family and I do like a lot of garlic so that was okay but I'd have to agree with the others that they're a bit thick without any milk (which I ended up adding).  I will make it again though but I'll get some romano for next time.

This were very yummy!  I liked this recipe because it did not require that you roasted the garlic.   Those recipes may have a richer garlic taste but I was looking for quick and easy!  I added a little bit more garlic because we like it a lot.  The only thing I will do different next time is to add a little heated milk. I like garlic mashed potatoes to be thicker than regular mashed potatoes, but I felt like maybe 1/4 of a cup for 4 servings might be about right to keep them from being too dry.  (Don't forget to heat the milk!!!) Great and simple recipe, THANKS!!

Help!  These were good and I definitely could see the potential for them to be great but they weren't.  I scaled them down to 8 servings.  I had two problems.  They were VERY salty (and I love salt).  Maybe I used the wrong cheese and that is where the extra salt came from or maybe I inadvertently added too much salt to the potatoes when I cooked them?  I used pecorino romano cheese.  I love garlic but the raw garlic was unpleasant to bite into.  I am definitely going to try these again but I will either roast the garlic or mince it, double check I am using the right cheese and ofcourse watch how much salt I put in the water to boil the potatoes.

I think I might have scaled down the recipe incorrectly cause it turned out too heavy and salty for me. I used crushed garlic instead of chopped, which might have affected the taste too. My boyfriend thought it was delicious though and ate it right up. Thanks for the recipe!

I scaled this recipe down to 4.  This would've been wonderful if I wouldn't have put the full 1 tsp of oregano in.  The taste was overpowering for our taste.  I will definitely be making these again but either without the oregano or a 1/2 tsp.  The cheese & garlic are very tasty together!

This was good, but we decided the raw garlic was too much and too strong.  Will boil garlic cloves with the spuds next time to mellow them out.

Way too much garlic, and I love garlic.  There was so much garlic in there that it was hot.  I had to boil more potatoes to tone it down some, and then it was fine.  Next time I'll cut the garlic in half.

These taste EXACTLY like the Garlic Mashed Potatos at Buca di Beppo, my favorite italian restaraunt.  If you have never had Buca's garlic mashed potatos, you must make these.  If you have had them before, you're probably running to the kitchen and getting out your ingredients right now.  By far the best Garlic Mashed Potatos EVER!

I use this recipe for every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner for the last few years. I am not a huge fan of mashed potatoes but this one is really good. I like that it is not made with milk and has Romano cheese and the skin of the potatoes. I love garlic and this recipe has plenty. I won't make any other version of mashed potatoes and I follow the recipe exactly. It is perfect.

I have experimented with mashed potatoes for years, adding everything I could possibly think of.. cheeses, sour cream, you name it.  This is the best version and most loved by all my family and friends.

The recipe calculator worked beautifully to reduce to 3 servings!  Used red skinned potatos.  Saved time by microwaving the quartered potatoes 10 min on high (for 1.5 lbs potatos). Cut the butter in half and left the salt out, and they were still delish!

The garlic is too pungent. I suggest adding the garlic to the potatoes 5 minutes after the water starts to boil.  It mellows the 'bite' of the garlic and the softer garlic then blends into the potatoes better.  This step is huge and makes it 4 to 5 stars.

I make this for every family gathering, because I am always asked to.  It is delicious and so easy.

I used roasted garlic which made it taste even better.  You can make the garlic a day ahead since it takes a while in the oven.  Also omitted the oregano.
For 5lbs of potatoes i used the below for garlic, but you can't go wrong with more...
1 elephant garlic or 10 cloves 
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F 
Arrange heads of garlic on a baking sheet. wrap in foil. 
Sprinkle garlic with olive oil and salt. 
Bake for 40 minutes to 1 hour, when the garlic is soft and squeezable, it is ready.

Fabulous!  Made this to go along with lobster for a family gathering and there wasn't a bite left!  I adjusted it for 10 servings and used 3 sticks of butter.  I roasted a full head of garlic by peeling each clove and drizzling some olive oil over it then wrapping in foil with small vent at top as another reviewer suggested.  It was absolutely perfect and so so tasty.   A hit.  Will be making this one a lot!  Thanks!!

I scaled down to 10,and included a head of garlic that I roasted.  Garlic taste was subtle.  These were the best mashed potatoes I've made. To keep them warm for thanksgiving, I made these following the instructions but kept about 1/2 stick butter aside. I buttered the inside of the slow cooker, and put these in on low once they were done. They stayed warm without turning into paste.  20 minutes before serving, I put the remaining half stick of butter in and stirred once it melted.  Perfection.

I made this recipe but adjusted it to 10 people.  We all *loved* it.  I made it as described except that I halved the garlic because I was using raw and i wasn't sure how my guests would react to it.  Wow.  It was *fabulous*.  I slivered the garlic with my sliver contraption thingie and then chopped it before adding it to the potatoes.  I let the potatoes "rest", covered, for appx 10 minutes before turning out into a nice serving bowl.  It went awesomely well with the Beef Tenderloin and Roasted Shallot recipe here  http://m.allrecipes.com/recipe/14606/beef-tenderloin-with-roasted-shallots   .  Oink!

LOVE IT!  Have made this several times. I cook the garlic with the potatoes for a softer flavor.  4-5 cloves of garlic put in with the potatoes while cooking will give you the extra oomph you're looking for.  The butter makes it oh so creamy.  Don't eat before any major social event, as ithe garlic smell will be coming out of your pores for a day or two.

The best garlic mashed potatoes I've ever made, honestly. I followed the recipe for the most part, but I boiled garlic with the potatoes and also added roasted garlic.  We like our potatoes garlicy and it was great!

Every time I made garlic mashed potatoes in the past I was disappointed.  I read all the reviews about how to mellow the garlic flavor and decided I would probably end up with another disappointment, so I chose to follow the recipe to a "T".  My only alteration was cutting the recipe to make only 10 servings.  I was rewarded with rich and flavorful potatoes. The oregano was a perfect companion to the Romano Cheese.  My dinner guests thought so too!  This is a keeper.  Thank you Austad, whoever you are!

I made these last night, cutting the servings to 6. I think these are the healthiest, garlic mashed potatoes out there. Very tasty, they go great with meatloaf. I will probably make these for Thanksgiving.

Mashed potatoes always have been a mystery to me.  Usually, mine end up gluey, which has made me dislike mixers and caused me to say things like, "How about rice?."  But I tried this recipe anyway, and it lives up to its ratings.  I didn't roast my garlic; I just tossed it in. I did use a quarter-stick of butter and a hand masher.  I used whatever potatoes that were on hand: some red and some brown but maybe mostly red. Dinner was delayed so the potatoes boiled longer than usual, so I anticipated comments about whether I would be hanging wallpaper after dinner.  Amazingly, these potatoes turned out delicious!  The extra cooking time made the potato skins disappear into the mash.  That never happened before.  The oregano is the secret flavor. These potatoes were so good that, even if I had managed to make glue, I would have enjoyed the smell of the room in which I later hung wallpaper.

Amazing. Tasted better than I even expected. Does not taste homemade. I found it hard to scale down this recipe because the calculator gives you all measurements in pounds, even for a few people. But I guessed on the measurements an guess I got close because it was simply delicious.

Wonderful - apart from scaling down to 6 servings! the only change I made was I used Asiago cheese instead of Romano.  I prefer these 'smashed' instead of 'mashed'.  Other garlic mashed potato recipes on here tend to be gluey.  Will definitely make again and company loved them.  45 minutes seems a long time for potatoes to cook - mine were ready at about 20 minutes.

It was a good base recipe, but I made a lot of changes. Cut it down to 6 servings. I used minced garlic and browned it lightly in the butter before adding to the mashed potatoes- I actually ended up adding more garlic to get the taste I wanted. Also added some pepper and milk.

Ok so I took a fellow reviewer's advice and roasted the garlic beforehand. I wanted to eat the garlic plain when it came out of the oven! Just wrapped a few cloves in aluminum foil w/olive oil + salt and baked for about 30 minutes. They smelled amazing! These potatoes were perfect, the only thing I changed was I added about a 1/2 cup of milk (serving 5). I mustn't have added enough butter because the potatoes weren't creamy so I added the milk and they came together.

I was pretty disappointed, especially given all the rave reviews. First, who starts off a recipe with 100 servings?? I have to wonder how accurate it is when I scale it down to 1 or 2. Obviously cooking time had to be adjusted; I guessed at 15 minutes for 1/2 lb of potatoes, which seems to have worked. I'm a garlic lover, but in the end it just wasn't anything special. Pretty enough, but I like my old standard recipe better.

Easy, simple but delicious!  I scaled it down to about 2 lbs small potatoes, 2 Tbsp butter and I grated one large clove of garlic.  I added a splash of milk and some pepper.  Because my potatoes were small, cooking tome was only about 30 minutes.  I wasn't sure I would like oregano in this, but it worked!  Chives, rosemary or other herbs would also be a nice twist.

Great recipe and easy to make.  I used a little milk after blending in the butter and roasted some garlic to mix in.  Served at New Year's Eve dinner and received multiple compliments on this dish.

These mashed potatoes are amazing!  So simple but delicious, everyone raved about them!  I could eat them as a meal by themselves.

Whoaaaa! Pretty darn good! I scaled it down to 5 servings as it is just my bf and I. I use Country Crock Churn Style margarine (I know the author opposed and recommended real butter but I only had margarine). It was SO creamy! Not salty enough for my taste but that's MY preference and a super easy fix. Very garlicy but that's how we like em'! Will add some crushed black pepper. Best potatoes I've made yet!!

These were AWESOME!!! I did not add salt since I used salted butter. I also added 1T of minced garlic since some stated that the garlic was overpowering. It was PERFECT! Will be making these again and again!

The romano is way took overpowering. I made it for 20 servings for Thanksgiving and NOBODY ate the mashed potatoes, yet they ate my mothers boxed mashed potatoes. I made it once again for less servings, and once again, nobody wanted them and said "why have your mashed potatoes been coming out so weird tasting?"... So I'm definitely going back to my traditional mashed potatoes. These are great if you like the strong romano taste in the potatoes, but these just aren't for me or my other 20 family members.

Wow, this recipe calls for wayy too much romano!!! It's delicious with a lot less...I'll have to make it again to say how much, but it was very over-powered by romano using this recipe.

Tried it with roasted garlic as suggested by others... seriously, best mashed potatoes ever!!!  Added a few tablespoons of milk to give it a smidge more creaminess, too.  Served to two guys who work in a restaurant... they were in love!

This is a super mashed! Simple & easy to make. I roasted my garlic (whole head sprinkled with EVOO) and the flavor was amazing. Scaled it to 6 servings. WOW!!!I also added mine with Lobster meat (sauteed in eVOO/butter) and mushroom gravy sauce, it's even better than the one from the Continental Resort. Served with crab cakes! It's a keeper! My picky daughter even loved it!

omg!  These are the best ever!  Scaled the recipe down to 10 servings using a 5# bag of red potatoes.  Roasted 1 1/2 bulbs of garlic following another reviewers directions - worked awesome!  What a delicious recipe!  My husband couldn't stop eating them and I think they're even yummy cold!

Very good. I too like many others threw garlic cloves into potato water for the last few minutes. I actually forgot to put in the cheese and they were still amazing and my family really liked them. I will make again, next time of course, not forgetting the cheese. Thanks for sharing :)

Tried 04/12/2011 - My husband is not a big fan of garlic, so I erred a little bit in trying to make this recipe to his liking...  Rather than using fresh garlic, I used garlic powder (and way too much of it for the reduced amount of potatoes I used).  I just read that when subsituting garlic powder for cloves, to use 1/8 t. per clove (why I didn't look into that BEFORE tossing in a full t. is beyond me).  So mine came out with a very strong garlic flavor.  I personally still liked them, but my husband was NOT a fan.  I'll try them again in the future, but if I use garlic powder again, I'll cut back on it for a more subtle flavor.  

I also seemed to have trouble with the consistency; normally I have no trouble whipping my potatoes with an electric mixer, so I'm not sure if my potatoes were a little too firm yet, or if the recipe just needed more "wet" ingredients.  I ended up adding extra butter, a little milk, and even some sour cream to get them to the conistency we like.

Sooo delicious!  This one is going to be a regular addition to our family meals!  I thought the consistency was fine w/o sour cream, because these are mashed potatoes, not whipped.  Couldn't be better...thanks for sharing this one!

These are very tasty, though would cut out some of the garlic. I minced fresh garlic (instead of chopping) though my family ended up burping garlic for the rest of the night! Even after burping the garlic, they ate more the next day!

I served this for a family gathering (10 people) last night and it was a tremendous hit for both young and old alike. This will certainly be served at my dinner table again. I did take the advice of several and roasted my garlic and added a mild flavor. I would recommend this to everyone! Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was fantastic! I loved how easy it was, and the taste was *incredible*! I'm usually disappointed with how my mashed potatoes turn out, and with the lack of milk, I was skeptical. As it turned out, both my husband and I agreed that these were the *best* potatoes I've ever made. I omitted the oregano, because I hate the taste of it, so for anyone wondering, it's still awesome without. Also, I tend to salt all of my food, but these potatoes didn't need it. (They weren't overpoweringly salty, but they just didn't need salt.) I like creamy potatoes, and thus used a mixer. The texture was great! This will be my new go-to potato recipe!

I make garlic mashed potatoes often. Adding cheese to the recipe is a great idea, & I will try it, but use Parmesan Reggiano, for a more delicate taste.  I always boil the garlic with the potatoes, & have never found a lack of taste. The potatoes should compliment an entree not overpower it. Raw garlic is fine when mellowed with oil & vinegar for a salad dressing.

OMG THE BEST POTATOES I HAVE EVER MADE.  By far!!!!  I used Yukon Gold cause thats all I had and also used a Parmesan/Romano mix (again its what I had on hand) - I also only had my phone app for the recipe so I had to do the scaling down in my head.  I took other reviewers advice and I roasted my garlic in the oven first.  I used about 2 1/2 pounds of potatoes -  1 1/2 sticks of butter and about 5/6 cloves of garlic and about a 1/4 cup of cheese and oregano by taste (site) - I did a lot of this by taste and used a mixer to make a smooth mashed potato (vs a hand masher and chunky potatoes) but I still left the skin on.   WOW!!!!  They were absolutely fantastic - next time I might add some cheddar n chives and see how that turns out.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

Scaled down to 10 servings and used 2 sticks of butter rather than 3.  Only boiled them 15-20 mins and it was perfect. Also used garlic powder (1tsp) rather than fresh garlic and added a splash of heavy cream.  Top the taters with chives. These were delicious potatoes! I love not having to peel them! :-)

This really was wonderful! Funniest thing ever happened though, I put my boyfriend in charge of it. I gave him the recipe and he set it on top of a recipe for marinated shrimp. He accidentally combined this recipe along with basil and tomato sauce from the shrimp marinade. Still turned out fabulous :)

Yum!  I boiled my garlic along with my potatoes, like other people had done as well and added a little bit of milk while I was smashing these, but other than that, I kept everything else the same and they were delicious!  Would for sure make these again.  And these are way fancier than just plain mashed potatoes, so they are good to use as a side dish to entertain with as well.

These were amazing!  They were better than any I have ever had at a restaurant!  I followed the recipe as stated after adjusting the servings to 5.  Will def. make them again and again and again...

The chopped garlic kills this dish.  Here's the real secret:  smash the whole garlic and drop into the boiling water with the potatoes.  You obtain a garlic flavor that doesn't drive away loved ones.

Easy recipe, great for crowds. I scaled it back to 10 servings. I love garlic and put it in everything, but 1/3 cup was overpowering. Next time I'll try 1/4 cup and saute the garlic before adding to the potatoes. The raw garlic was just too much for me, though my guests loved them!

i did not like how the oregano tasted in the potatoes.  Every bite I took I could only taste a strong cheese flavor and strong oregano taste.  My boyfriend and I were not big fans.  We might try it again jus without the cheese and oregano since we are such big garlic fans

What a wonderful recipe!  The mashed potatoes were a side dished to my roasted pork loin.  The idea of using Romono cheese and oregano was something new to me.  However, I'm glad I tried it because everyone loved it.  The Romano cheese gives a creamy texture to the mashed potatoes.

These were delicious!  I scaled it for 6 servings.  And although I hate to alter the recipe the first time I make it, I did roast the garlic beforehand and only used half the butter (because 2 sticks seemed like an awful lot for 6 servings).  I also added milk after mashing everything, only because we like mashed potatoes a litte creamier. Will definately be making these again.

Used 10 pounds potatoes and 3 whole bulbs of garlic, roasted. It was perfect--not too garlicky at all. Made for office luncheon and it disappeared! Will use again but only for special occasions due to all the butter and cheese!!

These really are good.  I made a scaled down version to feed a family of 5 for our Thanksgiving dinner.  The only change I made was to add a small amount of sweet potato (maybe 1/4 the amount of the reg. potato) to the pot for the added nutrients as well as a little bit of light cream.

I'm only giving it 4 stars because I had to make some changes; I didn't have romano cheese at hand so I mixed equal parts of parmesan and mozarella, I also followed suggestions of adding extra garlic. The touch of oregano was perfect. Very yummy!

This was just ok for me.  Somehow it seems like the raw garlic is just too potent for the potatoes.  Maybe sauteeing them will make a difference.  Might do that next time.

Absolutely fantastic recipe! :)  I tweaked it a bit by taking a full head of garlic, peeling it and putting it in wrapped aluminum foil with some olive oil at 375 for 35 minutes.  I think roasting the garlic really made the recipe ;)  I also used fresh grated parmesean cheese instead of romano, because the store by me was out of romano and it was still excellent!  A few minutes in my KitchenAid mixer and voila ... HEAVEN!

These potatoes are absolutely fantastic. They are better than any other potatoes I have ever tasted. I use 3-4 garlic cloves for a 6 person recipe and I add 1/2 cup of milk and 3/4 cup of butter and pepper. I have made them twice and will make them over and over again. Thanks for the recipe.

I give this recipe 5 stars though I didn't follow it completely. I made it according to 10 servings and it called for 13 ounces of butter, which seemed a little excessive for our tastes. First I took a garlic bunch, peeled the garlic and separated the cloves, and roasted it.  I boiled the 5 lbs of red potatoes. Then I drained them, added the softened cloves, added 4 ounces of butter, probably about a cupful of milk. Blended the ingredients together...WONDERFUL! Perfect garlic mashed potatoes and I didn't need to add any salt. I made this to go along with the almond parmesan tilapia and roasted asperagus.

I've made these potatoes twice - once following the recipe and once with my own modifications. The original recipe calls for crushed garlic, which is too apparant in creamy mashed potatoes. I hated biting into bits of garlic right in the middle of a smooth bite.
Instead I used water from the potato pot (to retain nutrients) + some whipping cream + butter + oregano + garlic powder + lemon pepper (just a bit) + salt. 
VERY perfect flavor. I'll make these from now on this way.

This recipe was a huge hit in our home. Of course I scaled it down to feed our family of 5 ;o). I also made a few changes based on the ingredients I had on hand. I used 6-8 med red potatoes, cooked as directed. I used about 1c of butter, 1 tbsp chopped roasted garlic, and about 1 tbsp (maybe more as I eye-balled it) italian seasoning - I omitted the cheese as I didn't have any and the salt because it didn't need it. SOOOO yummy! A new favorite side in our home, Thanks!

I love creamy mashed potatoes and garlic, so I figured this recipe would be fantastic. Unfortunately, there was too much butter, garlic and cheese, and it tasted like Alfredo sauce - all the potato flavour was gone! It end up being something you could pour over pasta, with no potatoes in there whatsoever! So, I won't try it again. The only thing I did differently was that I sauteed the garlic.

HOLY COW! Best mashed potatoes I've ever had! I halved it since I cook for 2 ppl, reduced garlic by 1/4 tsp, but added dash of garlic powder. A little less salt, and 4oz of butter, 2 oz margarine. I used parmesan since no Romano on hand. I also used the hand mixer and mixed until creamy. THANK YOU FOR SHARING, IT WILL BECOME A STAPLE IN MY COLLECTION!

Very good garlic mashed potatoes. I decreased the amount of garlic just a little and added a bit of milk as well.  I decreased the recipe to 10 and still had a ton of potatoes left over!

These were good! I may use a little less garlic next time... and make sure to use top quality cheese (it makes the difference)but these are a keeper.

this was a huge hit at our last dinner gathering. we had already peeled garlic cloves (the ones they sell at the asian markets). so i drizzled olive oil onto a handful of these cloves, wrapped it in aluminum foil and threw it in the toaster oven for 20 minutes. i took the advice of using roasted garlic instead of raw garlic and it worked out great! it does dry out if you want to eat it as leftovers, so you'll want to add milk before microwaving the leftovers.

I pride myself on my own recipe of garlic mashed potatoes, so I was curious to try this.  After reading the reviews, I also boiled the chopped garlic with the red potatoes.  I also boiled a bouillon cube in the water.  Didn't have any romano cheese on hand so I added parmesan.  I,too, added about a 1/4 cup of milk to ensure creaminess.  I was hesitant about the oregano, but no worries, this is delicious!  Enjoy!

As others have said, it needed milk, otherwise it was to thick.  Very good potatoes.  I used baking potatoes.

These were terrific! I did not have red potatoes, so I used Idaho and peeled them instead. I also used parmasean cheese because I did not have romano. The whole family liked them. These were the best homemade garlic mashed potatoes my family has ever had.

I scaled this down to serve 6.  I only used approx. 6 oz of butter.  I also added chopped cilantro and chopped green onions.  My girlfriend and I both loved it, and are glad there are plenty of leftovers so we won't have to fight for them.  Enjoy!!!!

Not bad!  I used russets since that's what I had at home, and I peeled them.  I used a little less butter, parmasan instead of romano, and a splash of skim milk, plus the garlic and oregano.  I really thought the oregano gave it somehting a little special.   I will definately use this concept again!

Hard to fail on this one - No guessing on how much more milk / sour cream to add to make the potatoes the right consistancy.  You don't add any!

I mixed all of the extras (butter, cheese, garlic, oregano) into a food processor first.  Primarily because I did not have grated cheese and I only had slices of swiss cheese.

Oh my gooooodness!!! This is the greatest recipe ever, the potatoes are so creamy and rich and the flavor is wonderful. The butter adds a lot of fat but remember *fat=flavor*. The ONLY suggestions I would make is too ease up on the Romano cheese just a little - this cheese is powerful (yet still yummy). This is the best recipe ever!!  (hint: Use the chopped garlic that you get in the produce section)

In a word, awesome.  I've tried many mashed potato recipes through the years and this one tops them all.  I scaled the recipe to ten servings and next time, I will reduce the butter slightly.  I felt too many guilt pangs eating as much butter as I did.  The flavor was decadent, but maybe just a slight hair too rich.  I served this with "Herbed Pork and Apples," another allrecipes winner--and it was the perfect compliment.  Rolls, and Bavarian sauerkraut ... it was a meal fit for a king.

I took peoples advice and scaled down the garlic. And i also scaled back the butter and added some heavy whipping cream, it helps keep it creamy and it doesn't get gummy and sticky. It was perfect! I defineitly have a new favorite recipe! I also passed this on to my mother to try.

These are truly like the smashed potatoes in fine restaurants. Hearty and stiffer than everyday mashed pototoes - if you're not serving with gravy, thin to your liking with light cream or half'n'half. A 5lb bag of potatoes is way more than 10 servings - closer to 15-20.

Great recipe however, next time I make these I think I will add some cream instead of using all the butter. They were a little dry and noticed others thought that as well. Also, do be careful with the oregano. Add it in slowly to taste.

I made this recipe exactly AS IS and thought it was terrific.  I would recommend a potato masher instead of an electric mixer.  The chunks of potatoes gave it a great texture.

When I prepared this recipe it called for 3 sticks of butter.  One of my thanksgiving guests saw me add them in and the shock factor was enough to start the comments.  They turned out amazing and people were saying how great they were, but you may want to play around with using a little less butter.  (Or do it when there aren't any guests around).

Very good.  I made 10 servings and it came out perfect.  Any excuse to use my mixer.  Didn't change a thing about the recipe.  Thanks.

This recipe is very similar to one I have been using for the past year and I can no longer bring myself to make regular mashed potatoes.  Don't be afraid of the dried oregano, especially if you are serving with an Italian dish!  I sometimes substitute parmesan cheese for the oregano, and it is just as yummy!
(I have also used this recipe base to make cheddar mashed potatoes by adding 1/4 of the garlic and substituting shredded cheddar for the romano)

Good, very garlicky. Almost a smoky flavor. But, we enjoyed them.

Fantastic mashed potatoes!!! This recipe deserves 10 Stars!! I did put a little too much cheese in mine, but they still turned out wonderful.  My family raved all through dinner, including myself! I paired these yummy potatoes with the “Chicken Fried Chicken”, posted by Cassie Wicks (also, an UNBELIEVABE chicken recipe), and steamed broccoli with cheese sauce.  YUM!!  Thanks so much for sharing and EVERYONE here on Allrecipes.com, you have gotta try these and the Chicken Fried Chicken!!!  Wow – what a meal to remember!!

These had a great flavor, but were SUPER dry, even after the addition of milk.(think wallpaper paste)  They were actually better the next day.  I put them in a square casserole dish and put some milk and butter on top, then heated them in the oven.  The extra milk the second time around made them a little more appetizing.  I will probably try them again, adding even more milk this time.

Very nice recipe. I needed to make a few changes though. I use chicken stock to boil the potatoes, and at the end I use fresh oregano instead of dried. I also add milk. Without it the potatoes turn out dry. I also lightly toast the garlic in order to mellow it out.

I scaled this down to 10 servings... the amount of garlic was insane, even after cutting it in half it was way overpowering!  Romano... nice touch.  Way too much butter!  Holy cow!  I pulled out a huge chunk of butter after I mashed it for a while.  What can I say, I will eat the leftovers, but probably not make it again.

I really liked these mashed potatoes. I liked the way the oregano flavors them. I don't think I will add as much garlic next time. My son thought they were good, but he says he likes my recipe better. My daughter said they were okay as long as you put ketchup on them. LOL!

Delicious! made for a dinner party and everyone loved them.  Made ahead of time and kept warm in a slow cooker - stayed perfect.  I did add milk while mashing to make creamier

I made these potatoes for Thanksgiving, and although they were good, the raw garlic was too much.  Next time I might try to roast the garlic first so it's not so overpowering.  One thing that I did the next day was to take the leftover mashed potatoes, form them into patties, dreg them in egg then Italian breadcrumbs and fry them in some olive oil.  They made really good little potato pancakes and we ate them with our eggs the next day!

Very good recipe...As I was mashing, I thought the potatoes were a bit "dry" so I added cream and that worked great. I also used garlic from a jar and that really help speed up the prep time. This was delicious with the roast pork I had for company!

I made this for a large banquet (110 people) and they went nuts!  One thing to make it easier to handle this amount is to half the recipe so as to not burn out your mixer motor.  We also kept it warm by having boiling water under the pan (chafing dish) and kept it in the oven (covered)for a couple of hours before serving.  You can make ahead & it will work great.

These are wonderful!!! The whole family loved them - and they were really easy to make. I loved the fact that I didn't have to peel the potatoes. They have a strong oregano taste - so if you are not an oregano fan -  you may want to reduce slightly. I liked the recipe just the way it is though.

Absolutely delicious!  Everyone raved at how good these were!  I would, however, cut down the romano or use half romano, half parmesean.  I also sauted the garlic with some butter and poured it in at the end, and added some milk.

I thought this was really good, but I made a few additions/substitutions.  I didn't have the red potatoes or Romano cheese, so I used white potatoes and Parmesan.  Yummy!  I also added some milk to give them a creamier texture. All-in-all a good recipe.

These mashed potatoes tasted GREAT!!  I've made them several times.  Yukon Gold potatoes make a good substitute.  I don't like my mashed potatoes too dry.  Adding a bit of milk works well and makes them a bit creamier.

Love this recipe!  We scaled it down to 10 servings and it turned out great.  These reminded me of the potatoes a local (expensive) restaurant serves.  We have made this recipe 2 or 3 times in the month since we've found it.  When reheating leftovers it helps to add a little milk.

I made these potatoes for my boyfriend last night with grilled fillet minon, and he loved it.  They taste sooooooo good. He thought I slaved over the stove to make them, but they are really easy to make. My only tip is to go to an italian deli and get freshly grated romano chese instead of the kind that comes in the cardbord container, because it gives it a stronger flavor.

This definately something to make for someone you love.

FABULOUS!!!  Made these for a company Italian dinner and everyone loved them.  My husband ate them for breakfast & lunch next day and our 3 year old daughter kept saying, "Umm, potatoes!" These are large servings.  Will feed 15 easy with large meal.  Thanks for sharing.

I scaled this down to 6 servings and it is much too sticky thick without any milk/cream.  I added heavy cream and it was much better.  My husband, although he liked the taste, he thought it SMELLED strange.  I think the  Romano cheese was unfavorable to him.  Probably won't make it again.

overall it was good.  it did make a difference adding the butter in first, mash a bit and then adding the rest.  I used yellow potatoes, not red and used my instant pot  (8 mins)

Yum!  Even my potato hating kids loved this recipe.  I followed the recipe except adding roasted garlic (a little more than directed).  To roast garlic: cup top off the bulb, drizzle with olive oil, and add salt and pepper.  Roast at 375 for 30min.  Thanks for the great recipe!  Also, to change servings click on the servings number on the current recipe page and change the number.  The web site does the calculations for you!!

This was my favorite mashed potato recipe I've tried so far!  I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings.  I only used 2 T of butter, about 1/2 T of garlic, and added a little milk.  Otherwise I followed the rest of the ingredients.  YUM!

I'd never added fresh parm to smashed potatoes before finding this recipe. Now I add it every time. Roasted my garlic before hand and smashed it right into the potatoes. The dish turned out ... smashing. ;)

I made this for my husband for dinner last night and he loved it.   Of course I reduced the recipe, and replaced the red potatoes with white because that's what I had on hand.  Great taste and texture.  Use the garlic to taste as you're mixing, we prefer more then less.  5 Stars!

5 stars because I know it has potential, 3 stars for my version because I over calculated the salt :-(. It smell delicious, until the salt hits my taste buds lol. Make sure if u use 5lb of potatoes that your other ingredients match the portions, I miscalculated.

I scaled it down to 4 recipes. Very yummy. I took advice from others and roasted a garlic and used that. The best part of that is that I got garlicky goo on my fingers and had to lick it off. YUM.  This is definitely being saved.

This recipe is delicious! I did add a little milk to it in the end, just because I wanted to make it creamy. The whole family loved it and asked me to make it again for the next family event. The garlic was a wonderful touch. I would have never thought to put raw garlic in my mashed potatoes, but I'm glad I found this recipe! Try it, you'll fall in love. Never going to make my mashed potatoes out of the box or any other way again. Simple, easy, and delicious recipe. Thank you!

Splendid recipe and the only way I will be making garlic mashed potatoes from now on. I used Z's recommendation and roasted the garlic in the oven before adding to the potatoes. I have made this several times now to rave reviews from every single person. The flavors go very well together and quite honestly these mashed potatoes can be used as a side dish for any main dish.

we enjoyed these potatoes with the following modifications.. i know the submitter said not to use margarine, but you have to make use of what you have on hand.. i scaled this down to 3 servings and used half red potatoes/half russets, 3 T of margarine, about 1/4 cup of greek yogurt, a splash of unsweetened almond milk, 1.5 T of some kind of parm/romano/asiago blend by kraft, half a tsp of italian seasoning for the oregano, and added 3/4 tsp of pepper.. i left the salt and garlic amounts the same, but made sure to sautee the garlic first as i didn't think raw garlic would taste right in the mashed potatoes.. ty for allowing us to try something different

This recipe was very easy to make, and delicious! I'm a flavor lover so I will be doubling the raw garlic, oregano, and Romano cheese in the next batch. I did however find that you may need a little extra butter to make the potatoes a little more creamier.

Amazing! Follow the advice and use butter instead of margarine. I didn't have romano so I just used grated parmesan and it was still one of the better mashed potatoes I've ever had!

Perfectly ideal. For the taste of our family, I cut back the garlic and salt slightly and they were still flavorful and delicious. Love them and will use this as my go-to recipe.

I also used roasted garlic & scaled down the amount of butter for a 10 serving recipe. I added a bit of heavy cream and followed the authors suggestion of ensuring the butter is well mixed prior to adding the cream. I think I may have slightly over mixed it because it came out a little denser than I like. Although I'm always super careful not to over mix my potatoes, so I'm not sure if it was the cream. I'm making it again tonight so I will try it without the cream and see what happens. Everyone loved them the 1st time (I'm my worst critic!) though!!

This recipe was phenomenal, and easy (as mashed potatoes should be). I would recommend this for anyone. The Romano cheese and garlic is a great flavor combination for this side. For a side note, the texture may not be what you expect, but they are very good nonetheless - don't let that throw you off.

Excellent recipe! Best mashed potatoes I've made! I didn't have red potatoes at home so I used russet potatoes instead & turned out great. I also roasted the garlic beforehand & it really brings out the flavor. I love garlic, so I also added in garlic powder & it wasn't overpowering. Will definitely make again.

Adjusted the recipe for 4 people. Used chopped garlic in the water while the potatoes boiled and then a dash more when I mashed them. Left off the oregano because it didn't go with the meat I was making. Very, very tasty. Will make again!

Very tasty. I'm not sure I'll use that much Romano cheese next time though.

I don't think I'll ever make mashed potatoes a different way again. YUM. I did roast the garlic (4 big cloves for 4 pounds of potatoes -- I'll double or triple that next time). And I used pepper instead of oregano just because I don't care for oregano. These potatoes were superb!

Tried this recipe for Christmas dinner. My only mistake was not cooking enough!!! My guests thoroughly enjoyed the potatoes and are now expecting for its appearance the next gathering we have.

These were great!  Made them exactly as directed.  Found they were a teeny bit dry, so added a splash (maybe 2oz) of cream and they were perfect.  Will definitely be making these again.

Great recipe. I made this for Xmas dinner. First time that I tried it and it came out so good.  Super easy to make, I followed the recipe exactly. There really wasn't any reason to make any changes.  Family really like it.  The cheese and garlic (I used minced garlic) gave it a great flavor.

I really like this recipe. But made a few adjustments. I used Parmesan instead of Romano cheese. I melted butter and sauteed garlic and then stirred in potato. First time, I used the recommended amount of butter and it was too buttery for me. So I decreased the amount a little bit and added a little bit of milk. Turned out to be really good. This one is a keeper!

Made 10 pounds for this years Thanksgiving get together with my brother and sister in-law and family. Used 5lb of red and 5lb of gold spuds. I roasted 4 large heads of garlic (tops cut off, olive oil, wrapped in foil, 325 for and hour). Seemed to be the correct amount of garlic to spud ratio for our tastes. Thanks for posting!

This is my go to recipes for Thanksgiving every year. I do add milk because I like creamy mashed potatoes and it turns out delishious, I also boil the garlic but after reading other reviews I might start roasting them instead.

This was the best mashed potato recipe I ever made,I did have to cut the servings down to 5,I did't follow it exactly for I didn't have any Romano cheese,so I used Parm. and I used roasted chopped garlic in a jar,and parsley flakes instead of oregano, I also like boiling my potatoes in chicken broth instead of water ,this was restaurant style mashed potatoes,I LOVED THEM and so did my husband.

I made this recipe as-written with the only changes being to reduce the quantity to 8 servings and to use roasted garlic vs. chopped. The roasted garlic really ups the flavor and I highly recommend it. These potatoes were delicious and everyone enjoyed them -- that was until my wife found out how much butter is in them! Flavor-wise, 5-stars but calorie-wise, a little less.

I'll definitely be making these again but will experiment adding milk and reducing the amount of butter to see if I can get a lower-calorie version for the family. Overall a great recipe and one that is a keeper.

The only changes to this recipe were a recalculation for 5 servings and a total of 5 (nice size) garlic cloves. Other than that, the ingredients were exactly the same. As lovers of raw garlic in this house (hence the additional cloves) my only suggestion to those who are not, roast the garlic. I think if you are going to boil it, you would be better of eliminating it completely.
I made these potatoes with a meatloaf recipe (also from Allrecipes - Brown Sugar Meatloaf By: tangastar which if you decide to try, read the reviews (or at least the first 10) I took the advise to reduce the # of eggs and amount of milk and used the coating on the top. This meal was a real success in our home. Hope you experience the same.

I made this tonight and they were fabulous!!!!!  I'm a big fan of garlic and this did not disappoint.  I must have had four helpings and I saw others dig in for a couple helpings also.  I know I will be making this again and again..I did not mash mine though, I diced them into bite size pieces and then just stirred it all together.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe..

Okay not sure what I did wrong, but I had a similar isue as one other person.  It needed something milk, cream someething.  My husband and kids wouldn't eat it.  Pretty sure it was the raw garlic.  I think I will try boiling if I dare to try this recipe again.

These mashed potatoes turned out well! As other reviewers suggested, I boiled garlic with the potatoes. Also just added the other ingredients to taste. I might try adding roasted garlic next time, but either way I think this receipt will hit the spot.

Scaled down for 6 people = 3 lbs of potatoes.  Had lots of left overs.  Easy recipe, great flavor but felt guilty about eating due to amount of butter.  Keeping the recipe for a "once in awhile" mashed potato treat.

Awesome, easy, I was a T-giving rockstar.  "Wow, I usually don't like mashed potatoes!"  I scaled down to 6 servings.  Didn't have time to roast the garlic, so I sauteed the chopped garlic (and reduced the amount of garlic just slightly).  YUM.

This is the best mashed potatoes ever! I made it at school for cooking class, and my partner and I loved it! It was creamy, no need to use gravy and it was perfectly mushed, which tasted GREAT! If there were less herbs, it would have been better! I prefer food with herbs. If we peeled the red potatoes, it would have been PERFECT

My fiance and I love garlic mashed potatoes and this is our go-to recipe.  We do reduce the butter a bit and add a bit of milk.  We also add ground black pepper for some spice and increase the garlic--we love garlic!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!

The absolute BEST mashed potato recipe I have ever come across.  I scale it down to 10 servings, and roast the garlic first (a must in my opinion!).  Turns out fantastic every single time!

Ugh, so GOOD. I was surprised at first by the amounts -- never thought to put THAT much fresh garlic in! But I was merely limited by my own imagination.

Also, I love that the original recipe is for 100 servings. Makes me want to serve this at a gigantic dinner party.

Tasty! I took others' advice & roasted the garlic first by wrapping in tin foil with olive oil & baking for 45 minutes. Reducing to 10 servings makes plenty for a 6 person meal.

I have been making this for 2 thanksgivings and throughout the year now. I LOVE it! I cut it down to 10 servings and it's absolutely perfect! As for the garlic I cut that down to about 5 cloves minced in my chopper to a fine mince. I add a splash of milk for creaminess. These are the most absolutey amazing potatoes ever! Creamy.. buttery.. and cheesy :] How could anyone NOT like that?!

These were good mashed potatoes, but if made as specified they are just too overpowering in the garlic and cheese department.  I would certainly make them again, but next time I'm halving both the cheese and garlic.  I even threw the garlic into the pot for the last ten minutes of boiling to avoid it being too strong...there's just way too much.

This has become my "go to" recipe for mashed potatoes. I used other reviewers suggestions and roasted the garlic. I've also sauteed minced garlic before adding it to the potatoes. Even when I forget something, like the garlic or the oregano, these potatoes are delicious!

I made this for Easter dinner. There was no complaints but no rave reviews either. They were super creamy and did not need milk. I too did the roasted garlic and it was just enough garlic flavor.

Yummy! Added 3 cloves of garlic to the pot of boiling potatoes ....I thought the "raw" garlic taste would be to strong.  I put the potatoes and garlic through a ricer. I also had to add some skim milk to loosen these up a bit. Nice and creamy and full of flavor from the garlic, oregano, and romano cheese. Salt and fresh pepper a must. Served these with Slow Cooker Cranberry Roast from this site. Family enjoyed!

Very good, made these for 16 people for Christmas Dinner.  I didn't really taste the Romano cheese, maybe it was the brand I bought, but I didn't think it was worth the extra calories.

This was pretty good. I used a whole bulb of garlic for about 2lbs of potatoes (we like our garlic) It was missing something, but since I didn't have a clue what to do with it, we just ate it as is. It's worth a try if you are limited on ingredients you have on hand.

I absolutely loved this recipe! Just like almost everyone else who reviewed. I did modify it, only because I was only cooking for 2 people so it would have been way too many servings, so I went off the custom version (by bobdi) where the portions in the recipe are just smaller. Also, instead of Romano cheese, which I looked everywhere in the store for, I finally gave up and ended up using PARMASAEN cheese. Turned out sensational!! I couldn't believe I had cooked them because they were better than anything I've tasted in an upscale restaurant. My  new favorite recipe!

scaled down to 10 servings (5lb potatoes) and followed everything to a tee. it was just ok. a bit dry. maybe i'll try to add some heavy cream or sour cream to make it moist. a bit disappointing.

I made some big changes, but it still tasted great. Made only five servings of the recipe. Instead of butter and Romano, I used leftover packaged onion dip, Parmesan and a good splash of milk. I only have pre-minced, jarred garlic so I did my best to roast that in the oven before adding it to the potatoes. It came out really good, can't wait to try it without those changes!

These were very, very delicious mashed potatoes. They had a great texture, and were perfectly seasoned. I gave this recipe 4 starts because I wasn't particularly fond of the oregano. Besides the oregano the flavor of the potatoes was awesome...so it's easy for me to just omit the oregano the next time.

Wonderful!  I scaled this recipe way down to a 5 lb. bad of red potatoes.  I panicked when I didn't have enough butter -- I only used half the amount that should have been used, but it still turned out great!  Thanks for posting -- this is definitely a keeper!

One of the most amazing recipes  I've ever tried. Used it this Thanksgiving and everyone raved about them.  The only difference was that I used Garlic salt instead of minced Garlic, but it was perfect! A MUST TRY!

OMG, these are so good! I don't really like mashed potatoes, but these are great. I roasted the garlic and used parmesan cheese (I forgot to get the romano) I will be making these regularly as my family loved them too!

Very good recipe with lots of wonderful garlic flavor!  Next time I think I will omit the oregano due to personal preference.  The garlic was just right as was the butter and cheese.  I actually reduced the recipe down to 1 serving since I was just making it for myself.  Turned out great that way.

Made this dish last night for my wife and she loved it. I roasted the Garlic which is really important and makes the dish taste really nice. There is a lot of people posting that this dish is too Garlicky !!!! Then it would be a good idea not to add so much Garlic to the dish only to ones personal taste!!!! A five star rating - make this and you won't be disappointed.

Very garlicky and good.  There is no need to salt the water to boil potatoes (or pasta, for that matter) ... first of all, if you add salt before the water comes to a boil you could pockmark your pot, and second, if you add enough salt to your finished product it's simply not needed in this first step.  I also used only about half the amount of salt called for in the ingredients list, and that was plenty.

Great recipe.  I added less salt and used only a tiny bit of butter because I like to watch my sodium intake and fat intake. It would be different if this was a holiday side dish but for everyday, I want to make it as healthy as possible.

I scaled this recipe down to 4 servings and I'm not sure I was crazy about the consistency.  I cooked them for less time since I downsized the recipe so much but I found they were a little too thick and pasty like. The flavour was good but nothing special for me, hubby said they were good but I have made better.  Sorry - but I don't think I will make these again.

I have to say that I followed the script, mostly, added some more cheeses, but after testing this recipe on my family for Thanksgiving, I turned some taste-buds. Needless to say, this recipe is stellar and will probably give the same effect if you are so inclined to make these absolutely fantastic mashed potatoes.

Loved it! I reduced serving size to 10 and only used half the amount of butter. Didn't use an electronic mixer. Just mashed it with an old fashioned potato smasher. Still fantastic!

OMG! These are the best mashed potatoes ever. Made them for thanksgiving and they were the first thing to go. Scaled the recipe down to 10 serving and changed the recipe a little. I add minced garlic to the potatoes and water as another review suggested and some milk to make them creamier.  This is the only recipe for mashed potatoes i will be using from now on.

Hands down THE best mashed potatoes I have ever had, I printed this out ove a year ago and now I feel like a complete idiot for not making them sooner.  I followed the recipe to a T but for 3lbs of potatoes and it was perfect, just enough butter (and I always add butter to potatoes) and garlic, we're huge garlic lovers.  These would be such an easy to make dish for any holida, a guarenteed crowd pleaser.

I made this for a family dinner, and even my brother-in-law the self proclaimed chef loved them! They have a nice flavor and are quick and easy. I found that no additional salt was needed with the flavor of the romano cheese. I only used 1 and a 1/2 sticks of butter. Next time I think I will add a few tablespoons of milk or cream to make them a little creamier. But over all, this one will be going in the recipe box.

AMAZING!!! I changed the recipe alittle. I scaled it down to 10 servings, added 3 tsp minced garlic, and the rind from the ramano cheese to the boiling water. I used 3 sticks of butter and half of the cheese it called for. I didn't add any garlic after I mashed the potatoes like it called for, the garlic flavoring was already there from the garlic I added to the boiling water. I also didn't add any of the oregano. It was beautiful! I will definitly be making this for family get togethers!

I LOVED these! I followed the suggestion to drop the garlic in the water for the last 10 minutes of boiling to make it softer. Next time I may use a little less butter to make it a little healthier, but I definitely give these 5 stars!!

I am not a potato lover, infact i usually make only meat and salad or veggies when cooking for myself. However, cooking for my family, I make potatoes etc.. today I tried this recipe, it was amazing, I actually ate potatoes alone (My meat dish was not finished).. so i tried the potatoes and I was just eating it as if the potatoes were the full meal. I did however alter the recipe by using roasted garlic as others did. consitency was excellent as was the flavor

My husband LOVES garlic mashed potatoes!  The steak house that we worked at had good garlic mashed potatoes, but we like these even better!  I use garlic powder instead of real garlic, add a little onion powder, use russet potatoes and cheddar cheese rather than the more expensive romano.  I just kind of eyeball how much to use for 2 people, I usually use 3 potatoes and get a lot!  I really recommend this recipe to go with steak, we usually grill some bacon wrapped filets to go with these.

At first I had forgot to change the quantity to 10 servings, but had already reduced the potatoes to 5 lbs. potatoes, so when I added 3 cups of garlic... oops!  My brain was really not on straight!  So I decided to just go with it and just drained the water about 15 mins. into boiling, then added fresh water to the potatoes and resumed boiling... somehow it still ended up fabulous! Excellent, thank you!

Wow...not your every day mashed potatoes.  What an awesome recipe.  I did use the roasted garlic though (I love roasted garlic - used a whole head) and since I had some fresh guyere cheese, I grated some and added added it along with the Romano.  Yummmmm this was soooo good!  I had to edit this a second time because I've made it several times now and this is soooooo good.  We have a dinner party for 20 coming up soon and my husband said he doesn't care what else I serve, but this is the ONE thing he wants to have. You can't go wrong with this one!

These are fantastic.  As good as I have had them in any restaurant and my family loved them.  The only thing I changed was roasting the garlic and mashing it in.  It was delicious!  Thanks.

This was my first time ever making mashed potatoes.  The potatoes only took 20 minutes to soften (4 servings).  I think I put too much cheese by accident because that was the flavor I tasted the most.  But overall it was excellent.  I may try less cheese and/or more garlic next time.

I made these for my brother and sister in law, and the 2 neices.  Went over really well, and simple enough to make! Didnt take 45 minutes for potatoes to cook for me, probably 30-35 minutes. Will make again for sure!

MY HUSBAND DEFINITELY GIVES THIS A 5 STARE RATING- HE USUALLY ALWAYS COVERS HIS POTATOES IN GRAVY- BUT THIS TIME HE DID NOT- SAID IT WAS AWESOME WITHOUT- ONLY CHANGES: ROASTED THE GARLIC, PARMESAN INSTEAD OF ROMANO (ALL I HAD)- ADDED A DASH OF 1/2&1/2 (NEEDED THE MOISTURE)-  I WOULD GIVE IT 4 STARS- I DID NOT LIKE THE OREGANO- IT WAS OVERWHELMING FOR ME- I COULD NOT TASTE THE CHEESE FOR IT- ROASTED GARLIC IS DA BOMB THOUGH!!

I normally don't like skin in my mashed potatoes, but this was delicious! Used a 4 cheese mix and roasted my garlic as suggested.  Paired so well with Rosemary Garlic Lamb Chops I made.

These were good and creamy but had a strong garlic flavor. Good but I would scale back on the garlic.

Scaled recipe down to serve 4. Cut down on the butter. Next time will cut down on the dried oregano. Overpowering I thought. Will make again as a side!

I like the idea of this recipe, but I did not like the overpowering oregano in the recipe. Next time, I'll just omit that all together.

This is AMAZING!!! I used 3/4 tsp garlic powder instead of garlic, because i didnt have any on hand, and reduced it to 3 servings. it was the CREAMIEST most DELICIOUS mashed potatoes EVER! I had always used parmesan before, and just recently decided to buy romano. This is the first recipe i have used it in, and WOW! YUMMMMMMMM!!!!!!!

Fantastic, I also used roasted garlic following the other reviewers instructions.  I scaled the recipe to 6 servings and it made a ton, I also cut back the butter to 3/4 a cup for that scaled recipe. will make again and again!

I took these potatoes to a family Christmas party with some possible fussy eaters and the dish was licked clean! Even the kids ate it! 
I took others suggestions and roasted the garlic (one batch I roasted garlic in the oven, the oner on the stove, and the oven version I liked better), and I didn't have Romano cheese so I used Parmesan and it turned out fantastic. Everyone loved it and wants the recipe!

I even made it the night before, and it still turned out great!

Thank you for such a fantastic recipe!

It never would have occurred to me to use oregano and romano cheese in mashed potatoes, but we have ourselves a new mashed potato staple! I didn't use any of these proportions - I just made the same number of potatoes I normally do (4) and added the other ingredients to taste. I also added some milk.

These potatoes are great, definitely restaurant quality. I reduced it to 10 servings and only made four small changes. First, I boiled the potatoes then peeled off the majority of the skins, only as a personal preference. I too roasted the garlic before adding it, and wow did the house smell good. But, then again we love garlic! I only used 3 sticks of butter and added a little bit of milk to moisten them up a bit. Really good and creamy...just the way my family likes them!

These potatoes were so awesome!  I followed the recipe to the exact T and it was flawless.  I finally have been able to replace the family's cherished "yukon gold mashed potatoes" that had been served at every holiday meal for 10 years!  This "new favorite" was an instant hit, and the beauty of the recipe includes the fact that I didn't have to stand over the sink and peel the 5 pounds of potatoes we used by hand.  :)

Pretty easy and tasty.  I added sour cream and used fresh parsley instead of dried oregeno.  But it turned out great, will definitely use this recipe as a base again in the future.

Added 4/19/10: I've made this at least a dozen times now and honestly it is best as/is.  Dice up the garlic and put it in the water then just smash it in with everything else once the potatoes are cooked.    One of my favorite side dishes ever...

I had no milk so I figured this would be the perfect recipe and it is! I just boiled the potatoes and chopped garlic together. Then added butter and cheese. It was delish!

Anyone who doesn'tlike this recipe either didn't make it right or they just don't like garlic mashed potatoes!!  It was excellent.  I used parmesean instead of romano cheese because I only had parmesean and it was fine. I made enough for 2 and roasted the garlic per another reviewers instructions - yummmmm.  I didn't use the mixer to make the potatoes creamy - I just mashed them with a spoon and they had small chunks of potatoes - just like the restaurants do.  They were awesome.  I served the slower cooker london broil from this site over the potatoes.  Thank you for a great recipe and soooo easy.

This was extrememly yummy. I cut the recipe down to ten and had tons of leftovers after serving it for 4 people. I ate most of the leftovers throughout the rest of the week and found myself craving more later. I like it with the skins on but my husband would have preferred no skins. Personal preference. I will definitely make this one again.

YUMMY! My husband told me I need to make mashed potatoes like this every time! I used Parmesan cheese since it was the only cheese I had and it tasted really good. I made it as a side for the Pirate's Pork Chops and it was way too much flavor. It should be made with something that has a bland flavor.

I sauteed the garlic with a large amount of butter. That way the butter also picks up some of the garlic flavor and was already melted for adding to the potatoes. To make it more healthy, cut down on the butter and added milk. Very good!!!

Thank you for posting this recipe!  I've used it a number of times now over the past few years, usually for Thanksgiving or Christmas and my family loves it!  I often add about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of milk just to make them a little bit smoother as that is how the family prefers them.

Loved it!  I cut the recipe down to 5 servings.  I only used one stick of butter, and not as much salt.  I feel that it was a little too garlicky, but very tasty.  I will definitely make again, and I am happy that my husband now trusts me to make mashed potatoes again!

Needs a bit more liquid, like milk or butter, to make the texture more appealing.  I found it very tasty, it was just very thick.

Very good.  I reduced the recipe to serve 4 and will use a little less garlic next time.  Also, I used Idaho potatoes rather than reds.  I will definetly make this again!

I've been making this recipe for a few years, and it is always a hit.  After boiling the potatoes, I split them up and put a lesser amount of garlic in part of them for those people who don't like it so much.  Sometimes I add a smidgen of milk if they look dry.

These were the BEST Garlic Mashed Potatoes Ive ever had, and Im so shocked I made them!  For some reason I havent had much luck with mashed potatoes.  After having my wisdom teeth pulled I started craving them, and as much as I wanted to stray from the recipe I didnt!  The only thing I did differently was scale it down to 5 and boil the potatoes in water with a few chicken bouillon cubes.  I cut down a bit on the butter which was unsalted so next time I might add a bit more salt.  These are very mushy and I cooked them only 20 minutes, but perfect for my situation!  Will amaze my family with these soon!!

This was the easiest recipe to make!! They came out amazingly good! I made for 8 men who ate them all up! I did the recipe for 10 and I didn't quite use all the garlic it called for.  I didn't want it overwhelming, so I used about 5 garlic cloves.  I still thought there was a LOT of garlic, but the potatoes are gone, so the guys must have loved them! I used a masher for the potatoes, but still left a little clumps of potatoes, I like the consistency better than too soft. Will DEFINITELY keep this for future!

I thought this was quite good.  I served it with the Beef Tenderloin & Shallots (on this site).  Used the 6 serving recipe.  I didn't have Romano so added Parmesan instead.  It was very good but I had the sauce from the Beef Tenderloin to put on top.  I will say that this is quite good left over.  I added some fried bacon pieces and sour cream, warmed in the microwave - yum!

Used 5 lbs of potatoes and it was way too much for my 7 person party. We ate the leftovers the next day and we still had more after 6 more people ate some!  I added some milk to make them creamier.  I roasted the garlic in the oven (YUMMY) and added some raw garlic the last 10 min. of boiling the potatoes.  I personally didn't like the taste of the romano cheese but my guests said they did.  I think it would be great w/o the cheese or w/ a different kind.  Thanks!

This is our new favorite mashed potatoes recipe! We modified the recipe for 6 servings, roasted a head of garlic per others suggestions, used one stick and 2 Tbsp. butter, and 3 oz. Romano. We omitted the oregano by accident, but the potatoes came out great.  Very creamy and delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

My Mom always prided herself in making homemade mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner.  However, she's been busy this year and I volunteered to take over on the potatoes.  She was reluctant on trying my potatoes but after rave reviews from the relatives, she tried it and loved it - though she was in denial for a few minutes.  I am now the designated person to bring that dish for all holiday parties.  Thanks so much!

This recipe has potential but didn't quite make the cut. I made it a year ago and everyone raved but this year it was the one dish that yielded the most leftovers. I would recommend roasting the garlic first like other reviewers have stated; the raw garlic is too sharp and bitter otherwise. I also added some sour cream and seasonings.

I loved these potatoes and if you are a garlic head like me, you will also. I did modify it a little bit. I boiled my potatoes and tossed in some bullion cubes and when the potatoes were done, I reserved a cup of the bullion to add to the potatoes mixture. I actually added 2 cups and this made the potatoes too thin.    I also put in about 1/3 less garlic than instructed but it had more than enough garlic taste, and I LOVE garlic. The Romano completes this recipe.  What a great addition!

This was a GREAT recipe! These were hands down the best mashed potatoes I have ever had/made. I made some changes since I did not have everything on hand... I used regular Russett potatoes instead of red, Grated Parm. Cheese as I did not have any Romano, I added just a couple of pinches of seasoning, and a splash of milk as the y did not seem creamy enough. Absolutely WONDERFUL! Will definitely make again.

These weren't anything special.. my mother said she'd had these in a restaurant before, but when she saw that for 8 people, you need 10 ounces of butter, she flipped out. Thats a lot of butter. So we usd 4 ounces of butter, and the rest milk. We added a little more salt and oregeno, but I'm sure that this recipe would have been much better if we had used all the butter. So I dont exactly recommend anyone using milk instead of butter unless you want it healthier. Maybe next time we'll use all the butter, hopefully it turns out as good as it says it to be!

I scaled this down...just a bit.  They were good but I don't think 2 people need 100 servings!  I enjoyed this recipe.  I may have added a little too much garlic.(yes, I also thought that was impossible!) I'll measure better next time.

Wow, were these fantastic! I didn't use strictly Romano cheese (I used a 3 cheese combo) and not as much garlic or salt, but I plan on making these for special occasions. But I guess this recipe was made for a restaurant because I know I can't hold 50 lbs. of potatos in my entire kitchen! So I cut it down to fit 2 1/2 lbs. It worked out great. These are marvelous... or as My husband said "These are some rockin' potatos!"

Delicious and so easy!  A fantastic recipe!  The romano gives it such a rich flavor!  This one is going in my special recipe collection for when I need a trusty, no-fail recipe that's sure to knock their socks off.

these were extremely easy to make, the romano cheese can be exchanged for parmesan, they reheat well also, just throw them in a pan with some pam for a few minutes and they come back great!

These were very good! I made them for a family dinner, and added a little bit of heavy cream (like they needed the fat)They turned out awesome, and were a big hit.

I scaled this way down , but pretty much followed the recipe.  I took other reviewers' advice and boiled the garlic for a while with the potatoes.  I either won't do that next time or I'll add more garlic.  But I'm definitely a garlic lover.

I LOVE garlic, but these were too garlicky even for me. My husband said that if he had received these in a restaurant, he would've sent them back.  HOWEVER, that said, everything else about them was great.  Consistency was perfect, and the oregano gave a great flavor that I never would've thought to add. I WILL be making these again, but I'll definitely be easing up on the garlic!

Very good. Just a little too much salt for my liking. Made it for Christmas and everyone loved it. Just next time I won't as much salt as the recipe requests, but thats my own preference

Excellent as is.  Wouldn't alter a thing.  Goes great with Balsamic Bruschetta,
Insalata Caprese II, Italian Breaded Pork Chops, Sauteed Garlic Asparagus, and Chocolate Covered Strawberries.  All from this site.

These turned out really good.  I also scaled them down to 10 servings.  I also added whole milk and put in one less stick of butter.

I made these last Thanksgiving and everyone is clamoring for me to make them again. These do not have the same texture as traditional, smooth mashed potatoes.  They are perfect "smashed potatoes", like they serve in some restaurants. I used my potato masher to keep a chunky texture, and added some milk just so they weren't so thick. I think the mixer is what makes them gummy. Fastastic flavor!

Very good & easy.  Made just like the recipe except I didn't have any Romano cheese so I used parmesean.  My husband said they were great!  Will make again.

I LOVE these mashed potatoes, and I generally do not like mashed potatoes.  I cut the recipe to 10 servings and cut the butter in half, and they still had awesome flavor.  They are really thick, which I love but it was painful to my Mom to not be able to beat them and drown them in milk!  I will definitely be making these potatoes again!

We've made this several times with a few minor changes.  I usually boil the potatoes (skins on) with some garlic juice from the jarred minced garlic.  We then follow the recipe and add a bit of milk, just to make it a little more moist.  We always add some extra crispy bacon to the mix. It's phenomenal!

This was a great recipe, but I wish I had read some reviews first! Things I learned: 1. Add FF sour cream or sub it for some of the butter. 2. Double the cheese or you won't taste it. 3. Add some milk or these might be quite lumpy (& I used an electric mixer). And lastle, fresh garlic is ALWAYS better. (I know, it is more or a pain ... but you can REALLY taste the difference in a recipe like this one!)

I used this as a base recipe but threw in some parmesean cheese instead of romano and a couple of spoonfuls of sour cream.  It was sooooooo good.  Best mashed potatoes of my life.  Tasted like the ones you would get at a nice steakhouse.

I also cut the recipe down to 10 servings...which was more than enough to feed a platoon of hungry firemen.  Once again...the guys loved it & there was very little left over.  Mashed potatoes are a staple in our meals...so this recipe made for a nice twist on a well-known otherwise ordinary dish.

I used yukon potato and took the advice of others and boiled the garlic with the potatoes and added a little fresh parsley, and OMG these were good! But they did need sour cream (they didn't seem finished without the sour cream). I don't know what made me look up a recipe for mashed potatoes (I've been making good mashed potatoes for years), but I'm glad I did. I would've never thought to add oregano to mashed potatoes!

We have been using this recipe for garlic mashed for over a year now.  It's a favorite with  kids and husband.  Made while vacationing with family recently, and was a hit with brothers-in-law and picky cousins, too!   How can you use the words "too much" in front of the word garlic, anyway?  Thanks for a great recipe!

SOoooooo good! I had to use parmesean cheese instead of romano, cause that's all I had in the kitchen. ANd also I boiled the garlic with the potatoes like the others suggested. And if you are not a big fan of garlic, don't make this cause it is very garlicky. But tahnks for the great recipe I will defintley make this again.

Very yummy! Made twice- the first time I didn't put enough cheese and the amount of oregano it called for was way too strong! The second time, they were delicious- I was generous on the cheese and put only a pinch of oregano. I also added milk to make more creamy. Everyone loved them, but they are very high in calories!

I used the recipe modifier for 10 servings.  I absolutely love mashed potatoes, but I did not love these.  I thought they were way too garlic-y for my taste.  On the other hand, everyone I served them to really, really liked them.  So if you love garlic, you'll love these potatoes.

I'm sure they would be really good!  I've tried many times and just can't seem to get the recipe right!  Either too little garlic or way too much!

Definitely scale this down and roast the garlic beforehand.  I went to 10 servings, which was too much.   I should have known better.  Also, way too much butter.  Maybe some of the other reviews offer suggestions on cutting the butter.
By the way, if you have a standard kitchenaid mixer, 5lbs of potatoes just barely fits -- lots of sloshing.

I really liked using red potatoes since they didn't have to be peeled. I tweaked this recipe just a bit to suit us. I used minced garlic, italian seasoning instead of just oregano, and cheddar cheese. I wanted to use what I had on hand and I just don't keep romano cheese in the house.I scaled this recipe to 3 and it still yielded some great leftovers the next day.

Very good!  I'm not sure how anyone could say these lacked flavor, they pack quite a powerful punch.  I made them a few hours before serving them, so put aluminum foil over the bowl and set the oven on warm.  I think that helped tone down the garlic a bit.  I also followed other reviewer's advice and waited until I was finished mixing everything and then stirred the cheese in.  I didn't have to add more or less of anything, these were great!

Very sticky and gummy.  I tried adding milk to make it the right consistency but to no avail.  My kids didn't like them but my hubby liked the flavor.  Won't be trying this one again.

Pretty tastey.  I scaled the recipe down to 8 boiled the garlic with the potatoes ( i was scared of the raw taste) and used parmesan cheese instead of romano (its all i had).  Mashing them up they were pretty gummy.  I just used a little butter and some heavy cream.  IT took a lot it to make them the right constistancy.  It must be the cheese that does that.  As soon as I finsihed mashing i loaded up my plate to eat and was a little dissapointed because Although i could taste garlic it wasn't Blaring at me like i wanted it to.  My husband doesn't get home till much later and when he took a bite he says "wow!  how much garlic did you put in this"  Apparently the garlic nearly knowcked him out.  They tasted better the longer the flavrs mingled.  My 2 yr old wouldn't really touch them and my hub and i agreed they are a nice departure from the ordinary but not something to make all the time.  VERY GOOD!!!

These were AMAZING.  I used regular Idaho potatoes because they were all that was on hand, and added a tiny bit of milk.  They got rave reviews from my incredibly picky family, too.

These were delicious!   I did add some milk, but you can really taste the garlic, and the cheese binds it up so it's a bit thicker than normal smashed potatoes.  I would have never thought to use the oregano...it really adds a nice touch.  I will make again for sure. Thanks for the post!

I served this for the first time Christmas Eve.  Everyone loved it.  My kids were asking for left-overs for days afterwards.  I made it for 15 people and cut the garlic down to 1/3 of a cup and it was perfect for our tastes.  I also added some milk.

Scaled the recipe to 10 servings.  I agree with other reviewers - they were WAY too dry.  I added almost a cup of milk to mine! That didn't make them creamy, just moistened them up. After that they were nummy!

AWESOME!  I customized the recipe for 10 and bought a container of fresh shredded romano cheese and poured the whole thing in.  I used extra cloves of fresh crushed garlic and didn't change a thing.  I have never used red potatoes but that made all the difference in the world.  Incredible.  I made this recipe with PGraff's BOURBON Pecan Chicken.  Awesome!!!

YUM YUM YUM!!!!  I made these last night for our anniversary and they were awesome!  I love the garlic flavor - I used minced garlic and a little garlic powder.  Be careful of the oregano - a little does go a long way.  But these are wonderful and I will definitely be making them again!

I couldn't get myself to add the oregano as it typically overpowers the dish. Instead I added a handful of chopped fresh parsley at the end. Delicious.

These were very good. I did add milk to them because I like them creamier and I whipped them rather than mashed them. I love garlic so that was a big plus. I would make these again anytime.

What a fantastic recipe!  I made these potatoes for my mother's 50th birthday and they turned out wonderfully.  I added a little more cheese than called for, a little bit of freshly ground pepper and about 1/4 cup of milk for texture.  They were absolutely delicious.  Only one word of warning...these potatoes are for true garlic lovers as the fresh garlic is very potent.  I would add less garlic if I made them for anyone but my garlic-loving family.

I scaled this to 5 servings and did not add any milk.  I thought these were WONDERFUL! I used fresh garlic and didn't roast it.  These were a perfect "smashed" potato consistency rather than a "mashed" potato.  I truly enjoyed these!  Thanks!!

This is an awesome recipe and SO good. You must add milk to the receipe though or it doesn't work. I used minced garlic in the jar and that's the only to changes I made. My family love these.

Yes it was good, and I will make again but I don't know how it's supposed to turn out without adding some kind of liquid when you're mashing or mixing them. I added milk and a tad of left over cream in the fridge.  I also roasted the garlic on the stovetop (med-high) for ten minutes (wrapped in foil & oiled) in a lidded pan. I think that was really great for the recipe too.

I really enjoyed these, because I love garlic.  They needed a lot of milk added to make them creamy, I cut the garlic down by half,because my husband doesn't like it as much, and   added parmesan instead of ramano (its all I had).  They had a perfect garlic flavor though, and next time I will add more cheese because I really couldn't taste it.

Excellent potato dish! Finally garlic mashed potatoes that taste garlicky. I think it's the cheese that really brings out the flavour. My only caution would be salt: the cheese adds a lot of salt, so be cautious about adding more.

Very yummy, the garlic needs to be chopped VERY small so there will be no chunks.  Also it is very thick and you might want to add some milk to thin these out.

The flavor in this recipe is really good...but I think that the romano cheese is a little overpowering. This is still a great recipe, but I think that next time I'm gonna use less cheese.

Great recipe.  I used mozarella cheese instead of romano cheese and basil instead of oregano, and everything worked out fine (I wasn't being inventive; we just didn't have the right ingredients).  Very tasty.

These were delicious! I scaled the recipe down for 5, used only 4 oz. of butter (the recipe called for 6 oz.) and used chopped roasted garlic from a jar. They were a huge hit!

WONDERFUL!!!  I'm eating as I'm typing.  I put a lot of garlic in (I like it that way) and about 1/2 cup of Bacon Bits.  I also added a little milk and about 2 teaspoons of pepper and onion relish (I'm a mix-it-up type of guy).

I love mashed potatoes,big time comfort food for me and my husband thinks it's the worst way to eat a spud.(he's a grease junkie)so I tried these cause they were screaming my name and much to my delight they were apparently screaming at him too-he about fell out of his chair while proclaiming how he never knew mashed potatoes could be so awesome and now is always asking for these.Major flavor....delish

Not too much taste in these potatoes by themself, although they were great when topped with gravy from a meat dish.  Nice change from ordinary mashed potatoes.  Needs to have the right meat complement and they round out a nice meal.  I scaled to 6 servings and still had a big bowl of potatoes left over.  Will keep recipe for future use.

I made these potatoes last night with the recipe "Garlic Chicken" on this site (WOW--make this recipe, you'll love the chicken!!). They were good but I used an "old fashioned" masher and the potatoes didn't mix well with the cheese. I live in the Netherlands and could not get Romano cheese here so I substituted which was probably MY problem. In any case, the oregano was delicious in combination with the garlic. Thanks!!

this was a recipe with potential, great potential, but the amount of romano cheese is WAY too much. cut it by 60% and it will be fine. if done by the recipe's suggested amount of romano it will turn out like Elmer's Paste. Not very good

Yummy!  My husband loved these potatoes with the gravy from Vini's Pork Roast.  I scaled the recipe to 4 servings, and didn't have 2T worth of fresh chopped garlic, so I subbed garlic powder.

Very good recipe. Cut down the size considerably to four servings; added a bit more minced garlic as well. Also, used parmesan instead of romano cheese because that is all that I had. It was well received but we still like some other recipes a bit better.

Absolutely the BEST MASHED POTATOES EVER! This is the 3rd mashed potato recipe I've tried from this site. Even though the others were very very good, these were just incredible! I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings and used 5 cloves roasted garlic! Other than that I didn't change a thing.

THE BEST MASHED POTATOES EVER. The best thing about this recipe is that it's very adaptable. I scaled it down to ten servings (5lbs of potatoes) and used Yukon instead of red. I boiled the garlic with the potatoes, then poured all the garlic off, and when I added garlic into the mashed potatoes, I used about half the recommended garlic, which I had baking in the oven. I used a little less than the suggested amount of Romano cheese (I followed what others said and kind of tasted as I went) because I found that they tasted perfect before I added everything. I made these for easter and I think they're delicious!

Delicious!  I made them for a party of ten.  Definitely use the "taste as you go" method.  I boiled a couple cloves of garlic with the potatoes as others suggested and also put some  through a press and added it at the end.  I was worried they would be dry but they weren't at all.  They reheated nicely.  This recipe is a keeper!

I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe, although I did find that I missing some of the key ingredients when I began to cook. I did not have red potatoes, so instead I substituted Yukon Gold potatoes, and I only had a limited amount of Romano cheese, so I used 1/2 romano and 1/2 parmesan, and it turned out wonderfully. My boyfriend felt that the potatoes were too buttery, so he gave it 3 stars, but I loved them. They were also wonderful as leftovers.  Next time, I'll make sure I have all the ingredients BEFORE I begin cooking, but even with the substitutions, I would give them a 5.

I had to add a pinch more of the salt, oregano, and the cheese to give it a little more flavor. And I would suggest putting the garlic through a press instead of chopping it.

We loved this one...just a few changes:  Reduced to serve 10, only used 2/3 stick butter and 1 small can evaporated milk.

This was a big hit. Even my sister, who can be finnicky when it comes to food, said these potatoes tasted like something from a really good restaurant. She ate them up, as did the rest of the family. I'll definitely make this again.

My baby loves this, though my picky 7 year old does not.  I think it was the onion that he disliked.  It has been great as leftovers.  This would be great for a potluck.  It would also make a great side for fried chicken.  I thought it would be plain without gravy, but it can stand alone!

I was scared of the garlic issue after reading the reviews, so I used roasted garlic and only about a clove and a half (serving 6)...next time I'll use more.  Even with very little garlic, the potatoes got rave reviews from everyone!  Super easy to make and I will certainly make them again.

I made these potatoes for Thanksgiving dinner, and they were a big hit.  I had been a bit worried about the potatoes, as they were very small and I wasn't sure I had gotten the right kind.  Because they were so small I didn't quarter them, and that was a mistake because the peel made them harder to mash later on.  Also, they were very dry.  I had to add quite a bit of milk.

I thought these potatoes were great, but my fiance and his father each had a forkful and told me to burn this recipe. Way too much garlic for them. I'll try roasting the garlic next time or cutting the amount of garlic in half.

Austdad is not kidding!  These are the best mashed potatoes you will ever eat.  Both of my boys (ages 2 and 11) loved them!  They have quite a bit of bite to them, but it is balanced by the mellow quality of the potatoes and butter.  This is our "new" mashed potato recipe!

These potatoes were way too garlicky, even for those of us who really like garlic.  Add less or roast it first and I think it would be fine.

This was absolutely delicious.  I doubled the garlic and it was just a tad too garlicky, so the original recipe is probably perfect.  It was also quite simple.

These are fantastic potatoes, perhaps all the more so because they are so easy! My only variation is to use half the amount of garlic (I use bottled chopped garlic) as called for in the recipe.

Best mashed potato recipe I've tried. I made this for my first Thanksgiving in my own home.  It was a big hit.  I'd use a bit less butter than the recipe calls for.  These potatoes are so good, you just won't believe your taste buds.

Loved this recipe. Used roasted garlic as others stated. Think I’ll try raw as recipe suggested for better garlic flavor. Made these one half hour ahead of serving and placed into 250* oven to keep warm. They were PERFECT! Piping hot, flavorful and not dried out! Needed a bit more salt. I will be making again!

I made these for thanksgiving and they were a hit. No gravy needed and they are incredible. Also wow that’s a lot of butter and cheese. No wonder they’re amazing. I’ll be making these for every holiday now.

Didn’t use the garlic, but the technique of adding the butter to the potatoes and then the milk was spot on! It is soooo fluffy now! Thanks!

Love this recipe but sure would've liked it better if I didn't have to cut it down and do the math for smaller servings lol.

A great mashed potato recipe .... easier than most since you dont have to peel the potatoes... i was afraid the peel would ruin the texture but not at all .. i will definitely make it again

I made this recipe and everyone loved it. I was sitting on the fence as to which way I would use the garlic : roasted or add near the end of the boiling potatoes. Personally I found the roasted garlic too strong, but maybe it’s because I used two garlic bulbs when one might have been enough. I need to try one bulb of roasted garlic next time to 10 large potatoes.  Roasted garlic is the best I feel - it just was to strong for me!

These potatoes turn out perfect every time! Once, I forgot to pick up romano cheese so I used parm instead which still tasted great.

I scaled down to 4 servings since I had some leftover russet potatoes I wanted to use up. I didn’t have Romano cheese on hand so I used freshly grated Parmesan and added a little freshly cracked black pepper and Himalayan pink salt. Great recipe!

So so good . Changed serving size to 10 which was equal to a 5lb Bag of red potatoes . Couldn’t find “Romano” cheese so subes for shredded Parmesan . Also used 2tbs of minced garlic since I didn’t have fresh garlic . Still came out absolutely DELICIOUS!!!

These are very tasty. I had to use Idaho potatoes vs red cause it’s what I have on hand. I haven’t even served these up my family yet.. I’m waiting for everything else to finish so we can eat. But didn’t want to forget to comment how much I am pleased with the recipe. And the oregano is a game changer.. I tasted them and was like these aren’t so amazing. Double checked the recipe and realized I left it out. Now I’m blown away and can’t wait to eat them!!!

Absolutely wonderful recipe!!! We are garlic addicts so we doubled the garlic (I would not advise this unless you really love garlic), used spicy oregano instead of regular, added a bit of milk for creaminess, and added bacon and chives for garnish.... oh good night!!! everyone ate 2 bowls and eyeing up a third. next time I may double the cheese.

I used baking potatoes not red and added half & half just to moisten more.  I didn't add the oregano.  Everyone LOVED the potatoes and I'll definitely make again.

Amazing. I roasted the garlic per the author’s suggestion. They came out perfect. I wouldn’t change a single thing.   I served these with Easter dinner and my guests raved about them. Pretty easy too!

I always follow a recipe exactly as written when I make it for the first time.  That being said, this dish was absolutely delicious and everyone enjoyed the dish.   This recipe was a “10” in my family.  Everyone simply enjoyed this dish and a lucky few were able to get “seconds.”  Which means the next time I make it I will double the ingredients.  This dish will definitely be in the monthly family rotation of meals in the future.

Garlic should be boiled with the potatoes and mashed with them. Raw garlic was not a good flavor here. Romano cheese overpowered the over-all flavor of the potatoes and the oregano just ruined them! Big NO from my family. They want me to stop trying new garlic mashed potato recipes and stick to my own recipe.

I love garlic in just about everything I make but I have never, for some unknown reason, made garlic mashed potatoes. I made this recipe tonight as a side dish with Brown Sugar Meatloaf and Candied Carrots (both on this site). It came out delicious and the only thing I did different was that I added the garlic to the water and let it boil with the potatoes and then mashed it all together. Thank you for sharing this!

I made these for my boyfriend and he couldn't brag enough about how good of a cook I was (I have zero experience... Shhh..) I cooked 3 pounds of potatoes. They were cooked in about 25 minutes so I'm glad I checked on them!

It's so so so good!  I followed the recipe, except I did roast the garlic just because my family loves that.  Without prompting, my daughter said they tasted exactly like the garlic mashed from her favorite restaurant!  Thank you!

Perfect as is, because I love garlic, but for the kids I used a bulb of roasted garlic and slightly reduced the butter. That’s it! Will make again. Served with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. Delicious meal :)

Best mashed potatoes ever but the recipe makes a hole lot and I was cooking for 5 so cut everything in half.  Also I used 4 tablespoon of the butter and stuck it in a pan on low heat to cook the garlic for 5 minutes for more of a garlic butter flavor. It really brings out the flavor of the garlic. Overall great recipe.

Best mashed potatoes I ever had in my life. I used garlic powder because I didn’t have regular garlic, and threw in a little more Romano cheese than called for. Otherwise I followed the recipe and it turned out so yummy I about lost my mind on the first bite.

Edited 2019-For Six servings (enough for my parents family dinner) which is 3 pounds of potatoes, I cooked 6 cloves of chopped garlic in a stick of butter over stove before adding. Then I added ONE more stick of butter to potatoes then mashed. Added dill and oregano to taste. Delicious!!!  So, 6 servings = 6 cloves and 2 sticks of butter.

We loved the flavor of these!  I roasted the garlic rather than using raw which worked really well.   I opted for parmigian cheese over Romano.  I also used the conversion tool, but wasn't comfortable with the amount of butter it instructed to use. Because of my guests' health issues, I opted to reduce the amount to one stick rather than two.  Everyone enjoyed the flavor but the potatoes were on the dry side.  Next time I'll still use less butter but add a splash of milk to smooth them out a bit. The basis of this recipe is great - whether I had to make alterations or not.

- I roaster the garlic like others suggested by removing the skin --> drizzling olive oil on garlic and some salt --> wrap tightly in tinfoil --> oven for 35 mins at 375*F.
- When I don't have time to roast garlic, I add less than the recipe asks to not be too overpowering.
- Use butter only (not margarine)
- Don't over mash (prevents them from getting sticky)
Serve it warm and not cold. Cold - tastes stodgy.

I loved the use of the Romano cheese, it gave it jus the right extra flavor.  I did not use all the butter the recipe called for. Only used half as much and instead used milk and some sour cream to add to the creaminess of the dish.

Followed recipe to the "T". They are good but a little dry in my opinion. I would make them again but maybe add some milk.

A friend introduced me to this recipe almost 5 years ago. I loosely follow the recipe and almost never actually measure anything. I used russet potatoes and shredded mozzerella, since that's what I always have on hand. I added a lot of garlic, since we're under the weather, and it added a nice kick to it.

Try putting in garlic powder in when you mash the potatoes. You can taste as you go. Cheers from New Zealand

We had them for Family Nite Dinner (FND) they (our adult "kids" & grands) loved them.  I followed a the tip about adding more garlic because we are Californians and like our garlic!  Will make them again.  Actually, I made so much I have leftovers and have frozen them.  Hoping to use them on my Shepherd's Pie for a FND in a few weeks when the weather cools off !!

Great Father's Day pairing with grilled steak.  My little town had no Romano, substituting Parmesan and mozarella was very tasty, but I look forward to trying  the Romano.

I followed the recipe using the ingredient amounts provided in the video, which was for 2.5 lbs of potatoes.The final result was way too greasy from all the butter. I won't be making this one again.

Made these for Easter.  Cut the recipe back to 25 servings which ended up filling two 9X13 dishes!  Which means we were eating these potatoes for a week after the holiday.  I used roasted garlic which was wonderful although it must be thoroughly mixed- grandpa said he got one big bunch in a bite- yuck!  I used romana and parmesan cheese.  Outstanding.

Considering I'm not a frequent chef in my kitchen I do like to dabble every once in a while and this recipe makes me look like I know what I'm doing.
Recipe is easy to follow and the results are outstanding.  Hands down the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.

I really just eyeballed the ingredients, as I was making this for just two people.  I thought the cheese gave it great flavor.  I roasted the garlic (as I had something else in the oven).  WONDERFUL!  We used the extra garlic as a spread for bread.

A little heavy on the butter (to the point that the potatoes look a little greasy as written). I like to use roasted garlic, a little less butter than called for, and eyeball the milk until I get the consistency I want. You really can't beat the flavor of these potatoes! I just like mine a little fluffier.

potatoes were a little too garlicky and when I used the electric mixer the mash was too sticky I think it may have been to much cheese as well. I think if I reduce the quantities of both in the recipe it would have been much better

Great recipe! Made this for a function where everyone brought a little of the same. This was the only batch of potatoes cleaned out in full!

Yummy although next time I will definitely roast the garlic instead of adding it raw.  My boyfriend, on the other hand, liked the garlic raw and thought it was fine.  I used russet potatoes instead of red potatoes and used a mixer to blend everything together.  Made six servings with 3lb bag of potatoes.  Very delicious!

select 7 servings is enough. And I recommend 2 tablespoons (less of the recommended) of garlic instead of 3. It was way too much garlic, more than enough.

Big no for me. Tasted too buttery and garlicky. Also oregano just did not taste right in this dish.

These are AMAZING. So delicious and with so much flavor. I'm not even a huge mashed potato fan in general and I'm in love with these.

I changed the servings to 2 for me and my husband and the ratios came out perfect. I still cooked the potatoes for the 45 minutes recommended for the larger serving. Really this is the perfect recipe, no adjustments needed.

I love this recipe, and use it as a base for pretty much all my mashed potato ventures.  I contest the cooking method: start with cold water, once it reaches a boil drop it to a simmer, cook for ~20 minutes, or until you can easily crush a piece of potato with tongs or a fork against the side of the pot.

Wonderful!  It was the perfect side dish for the popular Baked Ziti recipe here.  I have gotten carried away with adding so many extra spices and dairy products to my traditional mashed potatoes.  It serves me right to find out that less is more.  :-)

Thick creamy mashed potatoes with just the right amount of garlic and oregano.  I did add a little bit of cream cheese but that was it.  Very good and easy.

First of all I did adjust to just 4 servings since there was only 2 of us.  So, I loved these and the flavor they gave me. I gave it a 4 but I was right on the line of a 5. They went really well with the ribs that I made tonight.  I did leave a little of the boiled water from the pan in with the potatoes since some said theirs were dry(this helped). Unfortunately, my daughter didn't care for the flavor of the parm cheese in her potatoes and only gave it a 3.  I was looking forward to making again but I guess not.

Simple yet effective! Due to time limits and lack of some of the ingredients I used garlic salt, parmigiano reggiano, and chopped dried basil. I also added a small amount of milk AFTER the butter, per AUSTAD's notes. I'm looking forward to making it again with roasted garlic instead of garlic salt!

Super easy and delicious!! I didnt change anything about the recipe, but did scale down the amount of servings. We love garlic so the chopped garlic worked perfectly for us. Luckily I made enough that there were a ton of leftovers for everyone to take home! This will definitely be a staple for us!

They tasted good, but a little too simple for me. The picture is misleading because the potatoes are cubed in it even though the directions say to mash them.

My favorite recipe for mashed potatoes!  I had a recipe that called for cream cheese and I loved that recipe until I became lactose intolerant. I can handle butter no problem so this is by far my 
favorite new recipe and the best recipe I have had for mashed potatoes!!

Yummy! I didn't have time to roast the garlic as other reviewers have suggested, but didn't want the strong taste of raw garlic, either, so I put the chopped garlic together with one tablespoon of the butter and one tablespoon of olive oil into a bowl and microwaved it for about 45 seconds on 50% microwave power (to allow the garlic to cook a little without overdoing it).  It was great--still plenty of garlic taste!

My wife loves garlic mashed potatoes so I went looking for a good recipe. Followed this one to the letter and they were a huge hit. The garlic flavor was perfect.

I made this for my daughters birthday and took some to my co-workers.... Everyone loved these potatoes. However, I added some milk (not measured) and it was delicious!

This recipe gives you a starting point.  The quantities for this recipe when scaled down to 10 servings (which I assume most people on here will do), seem a bit off.  13 oz. of butter and over 14 cup of garlic!!!!  We used 8 oz of butter and thought that was still a lot and 2 tbsp. of garlic was easily enough.  We still ended up having to add some sour cream to get the potatoes to a less "clumpier" consistency.  They were quite good at this point, but it may have well been a different recipe.

How can you go wrong with this simple list of delicious ingredients? I used the recipe as a base, and made a much smaller quantity, as it's just my husband and I. I added parsley for the "halibut", and a bit of milk, just because the mixture seemed a bit thick for our taste. Also a matter of taste, we're pepper lovers, so I made sure to add that vital ingredient. I steamed the potatoes instead of boiling, again, a matter of preference. This is a great go-to for a side dish when company comes...simple and predictably delicious!

Incredible and very easy to make. As Austad says in a review, drain the potatoes well and add the butter first. It takes very little mashing with a hand masher to get them soft. No milk needed. I used Kosher salt and the amount called for is plenty for me. Try this recipe.

Great recipe, delicious mashed potatoes.  I also roasted the garlic and I forgot to add the oregano.  I halved the amount of butter and substituted sour cream for the other half that should have butter.  All the guests raved about these.

the romano cheese makes the potatoes already salty, and the extra salt was too much. next time, I would add the cheese and salt to taste. 
Also, used rosemary instead of oregano. i

These turned out great. Scaled the recipe down to 12 servings for Thanksgiving dinner. I should have added more garlic believe it or not but these were still great! They turned out creamy and delicious! I did follow the advice of other reviews and roasted the garlic first.

Delicious! Listened to the reviews and boiled the garlic with the potatoes for a couple minutes, it definitely helped soften the garlic and made it more enjoyable to eat. My in-laws weren't crazy about the oregano kick but I was.

I've made this a dozen times with variations, but do yourself a favor and stay true to the recipe. Fresh oregano didn't work, nor did fresh Romano. The only thing that seems okay is using minced garlic (available at most grocery stores) as it saves some time and minimally impacts the taste. Not to mention that I always have it in hand. Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic, easy, restaurant- worthy. That's what I think of these mashed potatoes! I made 5 servings, cut the potatoes into even- sized chunks, and they were done after about 25 minutes. My parents thought these were too garlicky, but I thought it was perfect. Later I realized that I forgot to add the cheese! Maybe it would have been creamier and less garlic-tasting if i had included it. I used a potato masher- I think this gives it a country-style texture. I'm definitely saving this recipe!

Very good. I wouldn't add more than the amount of cheese that it calls for or it would be too much. It tasted fantastic the first day and tasted rather good when reheated, but not as fantastic.

Very good.  I scaled it down to 6 servings with 3 lbs and that seems to be more like 12 servings to me.

I like this recipe. I had ever intent of following the recipe with the exception of roasting my garlic. For some reason I could not find my oregano so I had to do without. Next time I make it I will be sure to go out and buy fresh oregano to give that a try.

I really loved the flavor of these potatoes.  The garlic really enhances the flavors of the other food you eat.  I think it needs some sour cream though to make it more moist.  They were still delicious though.

This is the best recipe for mashed potatoes! The potatoes came out perfect, and it tastes so good! I used only 8 oz. of butter and then a splash of milk. I also didn't mash it completley and left some texture and chunks of potatoes. Fantastic! :)

SO GOOD!!!  I am a smashed potato snob, and these are one of my favorite recipes to date.  I didn't have any romano (which I will get and try next time!) so I added a couple oz of milk, and followed the rest of the recipe to the "T."  Add a dash of pepper and you won't have any leftovers!  Thanks for sharing AUSTAD!

I just made these tonight for the first time, and my mashed potatoing is now changed for life.  I'm always trying to figure out how to make mashed potatoes flavorful and creamy.  Usually it comes down to using the right amount of milk and a hand mixer.  The recipe's author commented that butter should be mixed in before anything else, so I did that, and the texture was amazing!  The potatoes were fluffy and creamy and so easy to mash.  I changed the flavor a bit, using garlic powder because I don't like raw garlic much and didn't want to take the time to cook some.  I also used grated Parmesan instead of Romano (it's what I had), and chives instead of oregano.  I also had powdered buttermilk on hand, so I put two teaspoons of that per pound, and it added a nice subtle twist to this classic.  The key is butter first!  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

Easy and delicious! I used Yukon Gold instead of red because I like the buttery taste better. Also, I substituted Cheddar for Romano since I had it on hand. Everything was still delicious! I cut the cooking time to about 15-20 minutes though since 45 would have led to mush.

These mashed potatoes are the best I've ever had! I fellowed the recipe exactly that first time and my husband raved about them for days! Next time I'm going to make them with a tad more garlic since my husband and I are garlic lovers. Fantastic recipe!

If I could give this recipe more stars I would!  I scaled the recipe down to 6 and still have enough for a few days of left overs.  I roasted the garlic as suggested and used the entire bulb.  My grocery store was out of red potatoes, so I used yellow Idaho potatoes.  I also could not find plain Romano cheese and had to settle on a parm/romano/asiago blend.  It was delicious!  Can't wait for dinner tomorrow!

Made it for christmas 2010.  Turned out great, followed suggestions of others, roasted the garlic first.  Consistency was thick but still good.  Will try russet potatoes next time instead of red potatoes.

I made these according to directions only than a minor change. I put the garlic minced in a skillet with 2 TBS of the butter cooked it a minute added the oregano to it then mixed it with the potato mixture and they are DELICIOUS! Everyone in my family wants a big bowl. This will be a family favorite. Thanks for the recipe!

Simple Perfection!  I do like to cook the butter and garlic together first on a low simmer to enhance the garlic flavor! Then add the oregano to the garlic butter.

WAY too garlicky for my tastes.  It also had the consistency of pudding. Gave it two stars though as it had a lovely aroma.

Good as is. I crushed fresh garlic right into the potatoes when they were done and loved the garlicky taste!

I thought this was a good recipe, I used it for Christmas dinner, but it was a huge amount of butter so for 15 servings I used 1lb of butter and a cup of heavy cream, also I used other people's suggestions and roasted the garlic, but then it didn't have as much of a kick so I ended up using two cloves of roasted garlic and a large amount of raw crushed garlic, generous with the romano cheese, and yum! My family loved it, as a matter of fact they took all the left overs! thanks!

This turned out really well.  I divided the ingredients by 12 and fed five people with plenty left over.  The division basis worked well except for the garlic...could have cut it down a bit more.

I get rave reviews every time I make these. They're so easy to make, but I try not to over-saturate my family with how tasty it is (don't want to spoil them too much!), so I try to reserve these potatoes for special occasions and holidays.

These came out so amazing!  Even hubby commented these were the best I've ever made!    I followed a previous reviewer's advice and roasted the garlic head.  I almost wanted to add some milk, just because that's what I've always done, but I decided to follow the recipe to a T. Over 800 people can't be wrong.  Definitely worth making again.  And again.  The only thing I will do differently is make more!!  I didn't make enough for the two of us!  I think I need to buy a bigger pot just so I can make more of these glorious potatoes!!

Sooo Good! I made them with Chicken Marsala and everyone, even my picky 6 year old, loved them. The only thing I changed was that I added a splash of heavy cream.

Excellent potatoes! I melted 3 sticks of butter and sautéed the garlic in it-that did the trick with the garlic.  Otherwise, I kept to the recipe & like the fact it was made w/o milk, etc. Tasty!

I made this with two substitutions. I used a few dashes of garlic powder since I realized too late that I had no garlic. I also used Parmesan instead of Romano. Otherwise , i followed the recipe entirely and ended up with great mashed potatoes. Not too garlicky and with a lot of flavor.

This is a delicious recipe!   Only recommendation aside for try to ease up on the garlic, which I did - you can also use garlic powder if you don't have close, is to ease up on the salt. My family doesn't normally cook with a lot of salt (plenty of spices for flavour, but not much salt) so we found this to be quite salty.  I didn't even add as much salt as the recipe called for and I still feel like the additional salt could be skipped.  So the next time I make this, I think that I'm going to cut the salt out seeing as the butter/margarine and cheese have enough salt as it is.   Otherwise good recipe.  I also scaled it down to 10 servings.

I could feel my arteries clogging while making this dish, especially whilst adding a stick and a quarter of butter, but it was oh-so-worth it in the end.  These were THE BEST mashed potatoes I've ever had--and I'm a mashed potato freak!  Usually I would not even THINK of not serving gravy with mashed 'tatoes, but the flavor was so amazing, gravy would have just ruined this dish.  Five stars!

I followed this recipe exactly but scaled it down for five people.  It is absolutely delicious just as it is.  It is a garlic lover's recipe so if you don't love garlic this will be overwhelming.  I love garlic and will be making these potatoes often.  Thanks!

These were SOOO yummy! My husband raved about them and I'm sure we will make these very often! Only thing I did different was to cut the garlic by half b/c it would have been way too garlicky for our taste otherwise, but other than that I followed the recipe! YUMMY!

Made this recipe EXACTLY as written, but scaled down to feed a family of 6.  Why is it that the only people that didn't give you 5 stars ALSO changed the KEY ingredients that made this so tasty, then had the AUDACITY to say that YOUR recipe just needs tweaking?  Maybe they need to TWEAK their conversions back to your original recipe to see why you deserve 5 stars on your potatoes?  DUHHHHHH

One word - WOW.  This is so easy and very, very tasty.  My husband suggested I make this again as a side dish for Mother's Day this weekend.  Thanks for an easy recipe that makes me look gourmet ;)

Very tasty...used parm cheese instead of romano (it's what I had on hand) used minced garlic and russet potatoes.  Very good garlic flavor...added a little milk to make them creamier.  Served with meatloaf.  Great meal!

I think there was way to much oregano in this recipe. It overpowered the taste of the garlic, which I could not taste at all. No one in my family finished eating their serving of this.

YUMMM DIGGETY!  The best garlic mashed potatoes I ever made!  I had to cut the recipe down to about 3 pounds of potatoes, but tried to keep the ratio of ingredients correct from the original recipe.  I also had to use a shredded italian cheese blend (mozzerella/romano/provo/parm from a pouch), which certainly didn't hurt the flavor at all but did make it a little "stretchy" when the potatoes had cooled.  Thanks for sharing!

This was so so good with the roasted garlic!! I'm so glad that previous posters suggested it. Followed the recipe exactly otherwise and used my electric hand mixer to make the potatoes smooth. I think my hubby would be happy eating these with every meal!

These are sooo good. I asked my husband to pick up the red mashed potatoes. He didnt want to because he said he hated red potatoes. After I made them for New Years Eve he was sooo glad, and I think hes changed his mind about red potatoes. Definately will make again.

I scaled this down to make 8 servings, and I use cream cheese, fresh garlic and cheddar cheese in my potatoes, but I liked the addition of the oregano.  Yummy.

Definitely use yukon gold potatoes--it makes all the difference. Also, I used roasted garlic instead. I chopped the tops off two garlic heads, seasoned with EVOO and salt, wrapped them in foil, and baked for an hour plus in 400F. Then mash the roasted garlic cloves into the potatoes. I used about 2 sticks of butter for 5 lbs of potatoes and thought it was enough. Great recipe!

Delicious.  Did make some changes based on what I read.  I made if for 20 people (10 lbs potatoes),  I used only 1 lb of butter, I used a 3 cheese blend Parmesan, Asiago, and Romano.  I only added a little  salt, because the butter I used was salted and with the salt in cheese.  Also I didn't add the oregano because I didn't think that would go good with turkey gravy.

These were great and so easy. I scaled the recipe down for two servings and it made more than enough.  The only thing I added was a splash of milk (maybe one and a half teaspoons). Also, instead of chopped garlic I used a bit less dried minced garlic because that's all i had. I reduced the amount of dried garlic tends to have a stronger flavor.  Also, I reduced the amount of butter by 1/3 to make it a bit healthier..my boyfriend LOVED it! Will definitely be making these again

I LOVE Garlic.   That said, this had WAY TOO MUCH in it.   I scaled it for 15 servings, which required 1/3 C. + 2 T. Garlic.   I had used a little less than 1/3 C. and it was still way too garlicy.    I will make this again, but next time will scale back considerably on the garlic and on the butter.

I just made these for our thanksgiving dinner, and wow! These are definitely my fave mashed potatoes EVER! The addition of oregano and romano is the best combo I have ever had in potatoes. However I didnt add fresh garlic, I roasted a whole clove to add to the 5lbs of potatoes. I mixed all the other ingredients before adding the garlic, and I would of been just as happy without it. The romano and oregano is where its at  This will be used again and again. Thank you :)

these in fact ARE the best mashed potatoes I have ever had. I got a little carried away with the garlic, but as I was making the potatoes for Italians, it was no big deal.

I really liked this.  It was very strong garlic flavor which I loved.  I did estimate a lot on the ingredients cause I reduced the potatoes to about 6-7 red potatoes since i was making it for just 1.  Will make again

So very easy and ohh so good.  Just don't eat before a big interview or a dentist appointment as you will have very bad garlic breath.

I really liked them.  My family took one bite and would not eat them till I added some milk.  They are too used to the watery mush they serve at other places. Oh well, good recipe for those of us that enjoy real mashed potatoes.

These are truly the BEST mashed potatoes in the world. My son begs me to make them. The only change I make is to boil the garlic along with the potatoes and then blend it in when I mash the potatoes. Much milder and deeper and so delicious.

Holy cow, these are great!  I scaled it to 10 servings and the only thing I did differently was at the 10 serving level it called for 1/4c + 2t garlic, but I only used a little less than 1/4c roasted garlic.  It was just perfect for us because we don't like it overpowering.  Otherwise did everything else exactly as stated.  It is definitely not something I would make often because of the calorie/fat content, but when I do I know I'll enjoy every bite!

They really are delicious.  I just have a hard time with the amount of butter.  Certainly not healthy...is there a way to cut the butter without losing the awesome flavor.

I made these the other night according to recipe except for the cheese part.  I used pizza blend cheese because it is a lot less expensive than romano.  They are very good!

OMG! I found this recipe to be extremely good.Scaled the recipe for 6 servings. I took the advise of another viewer about adding garlic to the boiling water. I minced the garlic (6cloves) before adding it to the water.  I wanted mine to be rustic looking but still have that creamy texture. I added 1 cup of half and half to mixture and a tbls of italian seasoning instead of oregano by itslef. I will be making this again..

I'm not a fan of this. The flavor really isn't interesting. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't special. For something this unhealthy, I really wanted it to taste magical! It needed some tang - like a splash of vinegar or a cup of sour cream. This recipe isn't memorable enough to bother tweaking it.

These are AWESOME! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe! I used 4# potatoes, about 11/2 cup butter, 2 cloves roasted garlic, and about 1/2 cup of a mix of Italian cheeses. BIG hit at our house! These were so easy, we will be making these over and over again!

I had 4# of red potatoes and I used 1 stick of salted butter, 1 clove roasted garlic, some fresh grated parmesan cheese, and oregano.  I also seasoned with salt and a lot of pepper.  Turned out great!  Definitely a keeper and I'm not a big fan of mashed potatoes.

Very tasty!  I like garlic in foods so the large quantity for this recipe was not offensive to me, but possibly a little less garlic would appease more people.  This was great with the recipe "Slow Cooker Chicken Continental."

These were fantastic.  I have tried many different variations of mashed potatoes and I have finally found the go to recipe.  They were so easy too.  I used the roasted garlic in the same amount that is listed on the recipe.  You will not be disappointed with this one.

Not very good at all.  No one at our house finished their helping.  I thought after reading the reviews that fork mashing would be best.  They still tuned out like glue.  I don't think there is anything you could do to make these right.

Very good but I didn't use all of the butter.  Seemed like WAY too much to me.  It was very thick so I think next time I'll add some milk to thin them up a bit.  Excellent flavor though.

I did not have red potatoes and there are only two of us, but I put into my own mashed white potatoes a little of every ingredient in this recipe.  I also did not have any fresh garlic in the house, so I left out the plain salt and added garlic salt instead.  The oregano and cheese really give it a different flavor and my husband inhaled this!  Awesome!

OMG I just finished making these potatoes and couldn't help myself but try some- HOLY SMOKES, they taste better than the restaurants make them.  I can't wait to feed them to my fiance when he gets home.  Thank you so much!  I also roasted the garlic first (also love how it makes the house smell).  Definitley five stars from me!

KILLER!  Reduced for 20 people.  Obviously not good for you, but you can kinda figure that out from the ingredients :)  Super tasty and super easy.

These potatoes tasted great, but I was grossed out by the large amount of butter.

This was good...I sized it for 4 servings and only used 1/2 tablespoon of garlic (less than half of what the recipe called for).  I think it would have been over-poweringly garlicky if I'd used the full amount.

i love red potatoes and this was a very good recipe!  Think I may need to tweak it a bit more, though, given I scaled it from 100 servings down to 8.  I used nearly an entire bulb of roasted garlic, and think I could've used more.  After all, can you ever REALLY use too much garlic?  ;)  Thank you for the recipe!

I will be making this again and again. We are garlic lovers in our house so I had to triple the garlic quantity. Otherwise it tasted just like the garlic mashed potatoes I have eaten at steak houses!

That was one of the best tasting mashed potato dishes I've had.  I didn't have all the required ingredients, so I replaced some of the ingredients with ones I had on hand.  I used russet potatoes and added sour cream and garlic salt because I didn't have enough garlic.  Following other reviews, I boiled the garlic cloves and they tasted great.  I also used half butter and half margarine.  Because I added garlic salt, I didn't add regular salt or oregano.  I also didn't have any romano, but the sour cream did a great job of replacing it.  The potatoes turned out delicious.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

My family all loved this recipe. I used an Italian cheese mix with both romano and parmeson.I threw the garlic in with the spuds, and they were just perfect. If you really love garlic, just add some garlic salt instead of regular salt.

This is a great recipe.  Everyone loves the potatoes when I make them.  I would do as others have suggested and boil the garlic with the potatoes or stick it in the oven.  The garlic is tender this way.  Otherwise you end up biting into chunks of garlic!

I made this at Christmas time and it was so good.  Bordering on perfect.  It's been buried in my recipe box and I totally forgot about it!  One person said it was too much garlic for them, but you can't make everyone happy.  Next time I'll make it with roasted garlic.

Delicious!  Calculated for six servings, this made more than enough.  I added a little sour cream and did roast the garlic.  Family raved about it and some had seconds.  Sure tasted restaurant style.  It was fantastic with our steaks!

I absolutely love this recipe, I've made it many times, but always scaled it down quite a bit.  You must be a garlic lover to enjoy this, I've reduced the amount of garlic whenever making it for guests if I don't know their garlic sensitivity.

Needs less cheese flavor, I will try next time i make them.  To make a reasonable portion, I used 3 lbs of potatoes, you can cut boiling time down by 15-20 minutes.

This recipe was good but after reading all the reviews I expected much more so I felt a little disappointed. I also modified a little - I added about a 1/4 cup of milk and half the amount of butter. I also added the garlic to the boiling potatoes. Next time I will try to stick to the recipe!

ABSOLUTELY wonderful recipe!  However next time I will use garlic powder/salt instead of chopped garlic! NO complaints on this one.

I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings & it still could have served 6!  I also used roasted garlic and the potatoes were very yummy - my picky family even enjoyed them.

This recipe came out absolutely delicious. I made it with roast beef and some Grands biscuits, great combo. I did make a few changes just to suit mine and my husband's tastes, though. I added milk and pepper to taste, Parm instead of Romano cheese, and a whole lot of extra garlic! I will definitely be making this instead of regular ol' mashed potatoes!

Absolutely the best garlic potato recipe I've ever made.  I made this dish for our New Year's Day dinner.  It was a hit with everyone and still good for leftovers later.  I only wish it was a bit less fattening - LOL

These are the best mashed potatoes that I have ever tasted.  Since I found this recipe one year ago, I have used this only, instead of the more traditional "bland" potatoes.  The only adjustment I make is to use less garlic than it suggests.  I LOVE garlic, but it is too much even for me.

These are the BEST potatoes I have ever had! I served these for Christmas dinner and they were a hit!  I cut the recipe to 3lbs of potatoes and used a whole head of roasted garlic instead of fresh.  Other than that, I followed the recipe, and they were great!!

Finally an okay recipe! Lots of flavor, just a little difficult to mix all of the ingredients together; they slosh out of the mixer! Pretty good, though.

This side dish was wonderful!  However, I had to give it 4 stars because it came out a tad bit salty.  I cooked for a servings of 10 people using the calculator.  Next time, I'll cut it to maybe about 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt.  Otherwise, everyone raved about it!  Thank you for the recipe!!

12/29/09 UPDATE:  I did this for Xmas dinner. I used UNSALTED butter and Parmesan cheese.  That way, it won't be so salty!  It came out fluffy and delicious.  Also, my family isn't a fan of the potato peels, so I peeled them after I boiled them.  Now my family wants more!

These were very good potatoes. My portion was embarrassingly large, and there wasn't a bit left on my plate. I scaled down to a non-army sized recipe and they turned out perfect - even the picky eaters devoured them.

So made this for a big family dinner, kinda in a rush and my helpers ended up peeling all of the skin off the potatoes which was fine. But these potatoes are the best out there. My moms claim to fame is her mashed potatoes and she said they were better than hers! YES!!!!

A little too cheesy for me.  It overpowered the garlic, which I roasted first.  Will reduce the cheese next time, but still very tasty.

These were good, but I had to deviate from the recipe a bit because I used the frozen "steam and mash" potatoes and the store was almost out so I got one plain and one garlic. So I modified the garlic amount a bit (and I cut way down on the #servings) so I winged it a bit.  I roasted the garlic and I think that was a nice change.  A bit too much garlic I added but they were still very good.

I only gave this four stars because I really felt that it lacked flavor.  I used extra garlic that I had roasted and the potatoes were good but not really creamy.  These were great for Thanksgiving with gravy on top, but without the gravy I felt they were just a tad bland.

Really good potatoes.  Mine were a little different from this recipe by accident as well as design.  I downed this to four servings and it was still a ton.  For prep, I boiled the potatoes with some salt and pepper, a tsp of onion powder and a smashed clove of garlic.  When hubby was taking the potatoes out, however, he couldn't find the garlic so that just got mashed up along with everything else.  As he was mashing I added the margarine, oregano and cheese as well as another couple dashes of onion powder and a quick dash of garlic powder.  Very garlicky but very tasty potatoes resulted though I would probably add more oregano next time as I thought that was a nice touch.

I have made this a few times now. It is definitely better if you roast the garlic like other reviewers have said. I also used less butter than it called for and added some milk instead. Other than those changes, this recipe is perfect!

My 15 & 17 year old children say these are the best mashed potatoes they have ever tasted.  I do add a little extra garlic, and have used a variety of cheeses.  They love it every time I make it.  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

These were good and my one guest really liked them. However, I did not care for the oregano in them - I woudl make again but without the oregano - too grassy of a flavor for me.

Very tasty. As other reviewers suggested, I roasted the garlic. And I did take the skin off the poatotes. I was a little short on butter, so add a drop of milk to make up. Put the cooked potatoes, the roasted garlic, cheese, oregano, butter and milk into the 'mixie and it came out so smooth and yummy. Great recipe.. will definitely be making it again :)

Great recipe. The whole family loved it. I used parmesan cheese since I did not have any romano. Served this with a Salisbury steak recipe on this site. Great combo. These are def. the best mashed potatoes I have made.

At first I was taken aback by the pounds of potatoes, wow. Narrowed that one down. Really good recipe. I have a similar one that calls for addtl' ingredients such as garden vegetable cream cheese (8 oz.tub) and real bacon bits. I think this one is a little less fattening.

I scaled this recipe down to just a few servings. You won't need milk, the butter is sufficient, I think that is what makes it taste restaurant style. I sauteed fresh garlic in butter and I just added the flavored butter to the potatos and I left these more lumpy rather than smooth, a highly recommended recipe, very flavorful!

I grew up in a household where Mom made very basic mashed potatoes - no skins or anything (sad, I know). This past Thanksgiving I made this recipe and everyone loved it - Mom was blown away. They all enjoyed it so much that I was forced to make it again on Christmas - this will probably be my contribution to holiday dinners from here on out.

This recipe certainly reminds me of a certain restaurant mixture.  They are fantastic!  However, if you're looking for smooth and creamy, skip this recipe!

Loved them!  I did add milk to get them to the right consistencey and had to use parm since DH couldn't find romano at the grocery store :)  I paired them with asparagus with Bearnaise Sauce II and Blue Cheese crusted Filet Mignon with Port Wine sauce from this site.  This was like having an expensive dinner but at home!  I also used roasted garlic in the potatoes too!

This was absolutely delicious. I added a bit of chicken broth to add a bit of creaminess, since they seemed a little sticky. I also added a couple of garlic cloves to my potatoes as they boiled and mashed them up with the potatoes.

Yum, yum, yum...... When the kids gobble it up I know I have a hit. They even wanted them the next day at lunch. I did add milk as others suggested and used shredded parmesan,romano,and asiago cheese. Will definitely make this again.

Oh my god were these incredible! I boiled the garlic with the potatoes for the entire boiling time. I only added alittle over 1 tablespoon of garlic even though it called for over 2. I drained the potatoes in a collander so most of the garlic was gone but the flavor boiled in the potatoes but was not over-powering at all. My main dish was the salisbury steak and it all went together beautifully...a great meat and potatoes meal! I will make these almost exclusively from now on! Thank you!

This was absolutely delicious.  I took into account a few of the reviews before I made it and altered the recipe slightly with delicious results.  I boiled the garlic beforehand and used the water since I used instant mashed potatoes.  After boiling the garlic I chopped them into smaller pieces.  I followed the recipe using the oregano and instead of using romano cheese, I used Ireland Dubliner Cheese which is slightly sweet and salty.  My husband absolutely loved it!

Absolutely perfect recipe! I make this time and time again with all different potatoes - not just red.  I always add butter and milk to my mashed potatoes anyway so I just remember the 3 main extras: oregano, grated hard Italian cheese (I usually use parmesan) and then of course the garlic.  Then season as with any dish (salt and freshly ground black pepper).  The mash always turns out perfectly and this is a staple in my recipe collection.  Thanks so much for such a simple, tasty recipe!

I followed the recipe to the T, and thought these potatoes were just OK.  After dinner was over I took the leftover potatoes and added skim milk and ranch dressing to them and mixed them with an electric mixer.  This did the trick, they were much smoother and the flavor seemed to come out more.

This was a very good recipe.  I agree with others that the garlic would be better boiled with the potatoes and mashed up with them (not to mention easier).  It was a little overwhelming as well as time-consuming to put all the chopped garlic in afterwards.   Also, these are very thick so people who like creamier potatoes would probably want to add some milk.

Very good.  They were a big hit.  I used fresh grated parm cheese instead of romano.  I used a 3-pound bag of potatoes and a whole head of roasted garlic instead of raw garlic.  It was not too much whatsoever.  It was perfect.  The 3-pound bag was plenty to serve 5 people.

Everyone loved it!  I used 5 lbs potatoes, 1 1/2 sticks of butter (the amount on the recipe is a ton!!).  I mashed with a potato masher so it was chunky instead of beaten.  Really yummy!

We loved these!  I scaled the recipe down to 3 lbs of potatoes.  The idea of "raw" garlic was not very appealing to me so I sauted the garlic in butter while the potatoes were boiling.  Used paramasan cheese because that is what I had.  Great flavor, texture etc.  Will probably not make regular mashed potatoes again.  Also set aside a portion without cheese for a child that can't have dairy.  She enjoyed her's too.

Delicious!  But I had to make a little change.  I halved the recipe and there just wasn't enough liquid in this.  I added an extra 1/2c butter and 1/2c milk.  After that it was nice and creamy.  Also, I first tried to mash this by hand but it was really chunky. I gave in and used an electric mixer and after 5 long minutes it was mostly smooth and creamy.  I think the serving calculation might be a little off, it seems like it serves about double the number of people it's intended to. But after the changes, it's definitely a new fave in my house.

My family loves these mashed potatoes.  In fact, they are often requested when we have to go to family/friend gathering.  I use parmesan cheese in mine.

I scaled these down to 5 servings for my family of 6 and we barely ate half of them.  They were just ok to my family.  No one would eat them plain so I ended up making up a quick batch of country gravy to pour over the top.  My husband and I didn't mind them this way but the kids still wouldn't touch them.  This is something I would probably never make again.

YUM!!! These were the best potatoes! I used parmesan cheese instead of romano and added a little bit of grated mozzarella. I used my bosch with the whisk beaters to mash the potatoes and it came out so creamy! I only made a 5 serving batch, I think the maximum amount you could fit in the bosch would be a 10 serving. Be careful not to get too much oregano!

Gave a four bc the raw garlic is killer on the stomach and breathe.  I will use roasted garlic next time.  But gotta say these are awesome.  I made it with Ch. and Stuffing casserole from this site.  Both great family loved it.  Can't wait to make a again.

I made these tonight with porkchops and I thought these were pretty good.  I'm not sure if my calculations were exact but it was still good.  I did end up adding more salt once it was on my plate.  I didn't have the right cheese so I used parmesean which still worked.  I also roasted the garlic like others suggested.  I think next time I will experiment with blue cheese.

I could eat this all by itself, it's that good!  I add the garlic to the water while the potatoes are boiling.  Otherwise, I don't change a thing.  I use new potatoes, with the skin on, and use a hand mixer instead of mashing (it's just easier).  I also don't blend the potatoes completely smooth because we like them a little bit chunky.

I really did not care for these potatoes.  I thought they had a glue like texture.  I did roast the garlic as other reviewers suggested.  My 6 year old daughter did like them though.

I first made this dish for Christmas and with it being my first time, I was a little skeptical. BOY, was I wrong!! Everyone is still talking about them. I actually made them again yesterday and substituted the Romano cheese for a mixed blend of Parmesan, Romano, and Asiago, and it was just as good if not better. I will forever keep this recipe as one of my favorite dishes! Thanks so much for sharing. ;)

Perfect recipe!

I roasted the garlic first like so many reviewers recommended and the potatoes came out better than anything I've ever had in a restaurant. Thanks so much!

This deserves 10 stars. I finally have potatoes to rival my mother. I downsized mine to 5 servings and added more garlic. I throw my whole cloves in with the potatoes to boil and just mash them up, always comes out good. I will never make another kind of potatoes. Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this.

Excellent, but the garlic should have been roasted prior to adding it to the potatoes. The raw garlic was a bit overpowering and difficult on the stomach.

Made these for a dinner party of 20 people, they were a hit.  The romano cheese is a little expensive but worth it.   Served along side a prime rib and this site's Airport Bob's Green Beans.

This recipe was amazingly delicious.  I used fresh ground garlic and grated Romano cheese with the recipe and it seemed to work out quite well.  I also cut back on the butter.  I only used 1 stick instead of the 1 1/4 called for for 5 servings.  It was a big hit and I look forward to using it again soon.

If only I had found this in time for Thanksgiving! They are fantastic. I cut it back for 10. I used a Romano/Parm cheese mix and used Italian seasoning instead of Oregano. Also -- I used canned minced garlic versus raw which I think helped tone down the heavy garlicy taste that bothered other reviewers. My family loved it and are already asking me to make it again! Thanks!

One of my thanksgiving guests thought there was too much garlic - probably won't use as much next time.  I also had to add some milk - the mashed potatoes were too thick for my liking.  Just to add a garlic taste I think next time I will add 1/4 of the garlic to the water 10 minutes before the potatoes are done.  Overall a very good recipe.

FAR too garlicky, even for this garlic lover! I scaled it down for 10 people, roasted the garlic, and cooked in the slow cooker. The flavor was good, but hugely overpowering. Next time, I will cut the garlic and the cheese in half (never thought I would say that about CHEESE!) They were also very heavy, not fluffy.

My family and I love garlic, so these were a big hit.  Make sure to chop the garlic very fine or mince it instead.  I did add milk as others suggested, but other than that, this recipe is awesome!

This was absolutely delicious.  I was looking for something different than regular (boring) mashed potatoes, and this was perfect...my fiance loved them as well.  Although next time I will either sautee the garlic or throw some in with the potatoes while they're still boiling, as others have suggested, because the garlic was a bit strong.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Awesome!  Used white potatoes and parmesan cheese and it was delicious.  I have had multiple requests to repeat this recipe.

I made this for dinner with my in-laws and they were all very impressed. I did roast the garlic beforehand and cut down on the salt they came out delicious! Not too much garlic flavor at all. You must try these!

Best ever! Yum! Cut down on salt like other reviewers and it was perfect. Only had grated parmesan and romano on hand, but it worked terrific - very tasty!  The cheese is definitely what makes the dish.

Tasty recipe. I scaled it down to 6 servings, but ramped up the garlic... roasted one clove and added one more minced, fresh clove. I also used Yukon Gold potatoes instead. The end result was a little thick, so I might experiment with some milk next time. Bachelor rating is medium... only because I randomly owned a potato masher, and I can't imagine many bachelors having one of those around.

I made this last night for me and my boyfriend.  Didn't even need the gravy, it was so good.  VERY EASY to make as well.  The hardest part is waiting for the potatoes to finish boiling because I'm so hungry.  There after, just mix in the cheese, garlic, and butter... good to go!

Hmm.. I didn't have Romano cheese on hand so I used Parmesan cheese instead.  This change required adding a bit more salt.  Also, boiling the garlic first was a good idea.  It's a good recipe, my brother didn't complain, but I prefer my mashed potatoes creamier.

Tried this recipe for 6 servings it was fantastic!  I really like the fact it doesn't require milk which in my opinion makes for weak mashed potatoes.

Not bad, a little stiff for my liking. If you like creamy mashed potatoes you'll need to alter the recipe and add some liquid like milk or broth.  I added milk and cut the butter and garlic in half.  Next time I make them I will roast the garlic and add more liquid per other reviewers.

I scaled the recipe down to 5 servings and rounded up on the garlic because I like strong garlic flavors.  I'd give this recipe a perfect 5 stars but I thought it came out a little too creamy as is.  Next time I will either increase the amount of red potatoes or decrease the amount of butter used.  Other than that, this is exactly the restaurant styled garlic mashed potatoes that you have been looking for.

These potatoes were great but with a few modifications.  I cut the recipe down to feed 5 and used fresh roasted garlic.  I also added a good bit of milk as we like our potatoes creamier.  They still came out VERY thick so I couldn't imagine the consistency without it.  Overall we loved them and I will make them again.

What a tasty way to serve mashed potatoes.  I do agree that the amount of garlic was on the high side, but this can be scaled down to your own taste.  My 10 year old son who swallows water after every mouthful of potato ate this in a few seconds and loved them!

This recipe is perfect. It came out deliciously the first time I made it. I roasted the garlic as others suggested, and I used a combination of parmesan and colby jack cheese instead of the romano, which had a great texture to it. This is a perfect side dish to any meat course that won't go unrecognized.

mmmm.. instead of using garlic, i used concentrated garlic spread. It gives more fragrance and smoother texture.

My sister made these at a dinner party this last weekend and they were FANTASTIC! She emailed me the recipe and I made them tonight (scaled down for four) but they weren't quite right - not the same, at least. I'm not sure what I did, but they were still the best garlic mashed I've made. Great recipe, once I've made it a few more times I'll probably have them down pat.

These are great, really garlicky.  I did add some 1/2 & 1/2 to make them a little creamier.  The oregano makes them "pop".

4.5 stars. EASY to make! Great taste! Put in mix of Romano & Mozzarella. Like the idea of not having to take the skins off prior to mashing. Roasted the garlic first.

I thought these were DEE-LISH!  However, my family didn't think so.  I'm not a picky eater and I'm willing to try new foods and hoping that my family is willing to try along with me, but didn't quite work on this recipe.  I still think they are pretty, darn good.

I have made this several times for various holidays and absolutely loved it. I normally like to prefer healthier recipes, but I believe everyone needs to splurge every now and then. (In moderation of course.) I followed the recipe exactly, except to scale it back to suit my needs for fewer servings. I will definitely make again and again.

I also used less butter than called for.  I couldn't imagine using that much for mashed potatoes.  They were ok.  Nothing special though.  A little too garlicy for my taste.  Next time I think I'll add some cheddar cheese and more bacon bits.

This is the first time I've made mashed potatoes that didnt come from a box, and they turned out great! I did change the recipe a little based on the reviews. I roasted the garlic in the oven while the potatoes were being cooked.  I used parmesaen cheese and a little milk and a lot less butter than the recipe called for.  Def didnt need to use the milk - it made them a little soggy (but still good) Either way they tasted fabulous and even the boys loved em! thanks for the great recipe!

Super yummy! I roasted the garlic first which gave a milder flavor, otherwise stayed true to the recipe.

This recipe was excessive, and not in a good way. Potatoes tasted harsh, the sharp cheese and raw garlic combination is truly unpleasant. If I were to make this recipe again, which I doubt, I'd saute the garlic before adding it to the potato mixture.

I only changed one thing, I used the shredded cheddar jack that you can buy in bags instead of the romano. I was hesitant about the amount of butter the recipe called for but seriously, these potatoes were AMAZING. I making them again tomorrow for my family's thanksgiving.

I used salad bar roasted garlic, and next time I'll know to mash it separately before whipping the potatoes.  Otherwise, easy and yummy.

These potatoes were excellent, I cut the recipe to feed 10, and did not use quite as much romano cheese as called for.  I also found that it was creamier if you added cream(half and half) to it.  These potatoes are as good as gourmet potatoes.  I had lots of compliments on the potatoes that night. I also used one more teaspoon of minced fresh garlic.

Whipped these up to serve with leftover Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker.  So good!  I blanched the garlic during last 3 mins of boiling potatoes to tone down intensity of raw garlic.  Was surprised to realize there is no liquid, such as milk, added to these, but they looked and tasted just like regular mashed potatoes with lots of great flavor!  Thanks so much, Austad!

The best mashed potatoes!  I usually sub FF sour cream for most of the butter and add a little milk.  Other than that, these are great.

I have made these potatoes 3 times and everyone has loved them everytime. I have had several more requests to make them and I definitly will. I am definitly a novice and they were easy to make. I scaled it down to 10 servings and the only things I changed is to use a little less garlic and only 2 sticks of butter.

Those were by far the best mashed potatoes I ever ever tried!!!  I will never go back to the way I used to make mashed potatoes.  I cut down the recipe to 10 servings, and didn't put all 13 oz of butter that the recipe asked for, it just seemed like a bit much, and next time i think I'll substitute the butter with margarine, for a lighter taste.  The red potatoes were perfect for this recipe.  All my family loved it, the garlic in it was just yuuummmmmm!

Awesome - whole family devoured it!!  It was so super easy.  I scaled down to 4 servings and actually used 2x the recommended garlic b/c I added the whole garlic cloves to the boiling water.  It tasted exactly like restaurant garlic mashed potatoes!!  I didn't have oregano on hand, and can't wait to add it next time!!

I used a ton of minced garlic b/c I couldn't figure out how much to use, since it wasn't chopped.  But we were a little bit disappointed b/c the potatoes tasted a little bland.  But then I reheated some yesterday for dinner and holy  where they garlicy!!!  They do get more powerful when they sit.  I think I will make again, just modify it a bit more.  Thanks for the recipe!

These are a huge hit whenever I make them.  Easy to make and they taste like a 5 star restaurant....

This was okay. I had to add milk and a little sour cream just to make it creamier. I would also recommend roasting the garlic because it's easier to blend. I used my mini-chopper to mince the garlic and still found myself biting down on little pieces of garlic. It was too much. Roasted garlic has a much better flavor when it comes to mashed potatoes. But this is a good starting place. Thanks for the recipe.

I thought these were great, the garlic was just a little too much for me. I used 1 tablespoon of garlic for 2 pounds (4 servings) and added milk to make them a little creamier. I will definitely make this again just with less garlic! Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These potatoes are great! I cut the recipe down to 4 servings and the ingredients were just right. I used minced garlic instead of chopped (not much of a change) because that's what I had on hand.  I always steam my potatoes, too, instead of boiling but I don't know how much of a difference that really makes. My husband wants these all the time now.

I made these for a suprise birthday that I hosted and was really disappointed with how they turned out. They were way to thick. One of my guest said " man you could use these as spackle" embarrasing! I followed the recipe exact however next time I will add whipping cream so they dont turn out so thick.

Very easy with alot of flavor.  I did use a bit less butter and garlic.  I used a hand masher to mash the potatoes first and then added everything else and stirred.  This made them more smashed than mashed.  I loved them!

I had this recipe scaled down to about 6 servings, it was okay maybe next time I will make it with minced garlic instead of chopped and cut down on the amount of cheese, it had a bit of a bite to it, not a bad recipe but if and when I make it next, I will do a bit a tweaking.

It was good but the romano was a little over powering.  We're still eating the leftovers of a 5 lb batch, and it gets to be too rich after a second helping.

I made a big batch for a pot-luck.  I guess I should have realized how garlicy it was going to be from the name.

There was too much garlic for my taste, but those who liked garlic enjoyed it!

If I try it again I'll probably use less garlic and keep everything else as is.

You have to make so many changes for this to come out right and in the end you end up making your own recipe. Maybe if you follow this recipe exactly and make the 100 servings it would come out right.

I scaled this recipe down quite a bit and served for a romantic dinner. I really enjoyed them, but my boyfriend was not a fan, too much garlic he said. Probably won't make again due to his preferences, but I enjoyed them.

I absolutely loved this recipe! Often I've gone to restaurants where they have served these delicious mashed red skins and wondered how I could make them at home. Well here's the answer. This is now listed as a favorite on my menu at home! Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!  Used a 3# Bag of the little baby red potatoes (scaled the recipe down to 6 servings)  Five stars isn't enough for this one!  (Use your electric mixer)

This was pretty good, I did think it was a little dry and could only eat a few bites which I thought were delicious at first then, it got more bland and too dry to eat much more.  The initial flavor is very nice though.  i will stick with some of the other exceptional mashed spud recipes on this site in the future.  thanks!

I have made this several times now. It's super easy and everyone always wants to know how I made them. I also sub fat free butter spray (I cant believe its not butter) for reg butter. No difference and less time working it off on the stairmaster.

So, so....a little dry.  Don't think I would do again unless I tweaked it a bit....perhaps some chicken broth to add a little more moisture to it.

This is VERY close to recipe used in those famous restaurants. I use any kind of cheese I have on hand, usually cheddar. I also use the minced garlic in the glass jars. It works very well! Thanks to this great recipe, I make the best potatoes in the family and everyone asks me to bring them to our family gatherings. :)

This was a great change from regular mashed potatoes. Be careful with the salt as using the cheese and garlic you really don't need much salt. I did grind in some fresh black pepper and added a bit of milk when mashing, not much, just to achieve the texture we prefer. Whole family liked this potato dish.

I scaled to 6 servings. The Romano gave the mashed potatoes a very distinc flavor, that even now I'm not completely sure I like. My husband loved it though.

This was very good and would probably make again.  The only thing I would change would be to reduce the amount of butter and add some milk.  Way too rich for my family.

I have always loved the garlic mashed potatoes at our favorite steak restaurant....they are to die for and this recipe was even better!    I don't know why I never thought to make them myself until I saw the recipe here.  Thanks so much!

Yum!  These were some of the best mashed potatoes I've ever made. I substituted Asiago cheese for the Romano (it's what I had on hand) and had to add some milk because they were so thick they were clogging the mixer.  I scaled the recipe down to 2 servings, and when they were done, I wondered if they meant servings   for giants! There was enough for 4 people!  Definately will make again!

I'm so sorry but they were nothing to rant and rave about, I made them for a father's day dinner and my husband didn't even have seconds!! I did roast the garlic like others had suggested, and the funny thing is that we could barely taste  it. They were good and I will definately try them again..maybe with more cheese and more garlic. I did add some milk, probably about 1/3 cup for my 8 servings.

Pretty good mashed potatoes. Better than my mom's. I added milk, I don't know how much, but quite a bit. They ended up creamy, just how I like them. Yum yum..

I tried these the other night with high hopes.  I obviously made a much smaller batch, however, they just didn't turn out as I was hoping.  I will try them again as my measurements for the garlic & cheese could have been off by a bit.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe. Once you get used to it, it is easy to make. I did follow some reviews, I used baby reds and boiled them in about half chicken broth. My husband says it is resturant quality.

Did not like this recipe.  The garlic is too overpowering and this recipe needs milk added.

I am never allowed to make normal mashed potatoes again! Every time we have a gathering, these are required for me to attend. I usually make a couple batches with different levels of garlic and cheese. Some people like the "extra" and some like the "taste". All in all, very excellent!

These taste just like my favorite restaurants.  I had to use garlic powder last night, since I ran out of garlic, and it still tasted wonderful.  I can't imagine ever having regular mashed potatos again.

I'm just chiming in on the chorus of accolades for these potatoes!  They were superb, and very easy to make (actually, my husband practically did the whole thing!).  Thanks for the excellent recipe; this is now my mashed potato recipe for life. :)

These are DIVINE!  Make sure everyone at the table has some though, because the garlic taste and aroma is best shared.  Couldn't be tastier or easier.  I used Sam's Club dehydrated minced garlic (rather than chopping so much) and it reconstituted in the recipe.  Will be a family and company-over-for-dinner favorite!

This is, by far, one of the best recipes for potatoes I have ever tasted. I cut down on the butter but they were still very tasty and rich. Thanks so much for the great recipe, Austad!

Very good.... Downsized amount for 4 people.  Little strong on the garlic, but still good.  Next time I will try just a tablespoon.  In any case, still very good.

Yum!  If it were up to me, I would never make another mashed potato recipe again!  This is my ultimate favorite of any I've had (even at restaraunts!)...I LOVE the flavor the oregano gives, it's not overwhelming at all (which is what I was afraid of)...it's a perfect compliment to a traditional favorite.  Nice presentation, too.

Thought it was very good.  Actually my first time ever making mashed potatoes, and they turned out very good.  I used a little extra romano to make cheesier potatoes.  I used minced garlic from the store and thought it turned out fine.  There would be little bursts of garlic in your mouth every once in awhile.

I scaled this way down for just two.  I roasted the garlic before smashing it in with the rest of the ingredients.  I like spice, so I added some cayenne and paprika to warm it up a bit.  The Romano cheese added a nice zing.  This was a great base, I just switched some things around.  Thanks for sharing!

I think it is much eaiser to make mash potatoes as you would normally and then add roasted garlic, with cheese if you please.

Wonderful recipe - no need to change a thing.  I made these at Christmas and my husband said that they were the best he's ever tasted!  They are also good reheated because of the cheese melting.

These tasted great!  I made the recipe for 4 servings.  I used Parmesan cheese, and only a little bit... I think it would have tasted fine without any cheese at all.  I also reduced the butter by a little bit.  The garlic flavor was wonderful!

Although we left out the cheese, it turned out GREAT. However, something to keep in mind with this recipe is that the serving size is a bit off. What I prepared for 12 ended up on their plates three or four times and there were still leftovers. Don't dispare if there are leftovers -- they're great warmed up, or even (dare I say)... on a Post-Turkey Day Sandwich? Cheese, the potatoes, turkey, it's surprisingly a good sandwich.

I loved these potatoes! They take mashed potatoes to a whole other level of "comfort food"! And the leftovers were even better. I will definitely mash these again!! Thanks!

I love garlic, but this recipe had too much!  I'll try it again using a little less.

These are so, so good. Make sure you roast the galic first. It gives it so much flavor. I do think a little less butter can be used if you want.

These were great, the only thing I changed was that I used a 4 cheese blend of asiago, romano, prov, and parm instead of just romano.  They were creamy and delicious.  I might cut down on the salt just a tad next time but this may be because of the kind of cheese I used...  5 stars definitely!

These were really good. I added a dollop of sour cream before mashing and some roasted garlic. The cheese makes it very tasty!

THE BEST EVER!  To shorten time, you can nuke potatoes in the microwave.  I didn't have fresh garlic (plus it makes my fingers sticky and smelly) so i just used minced garlic in the glass jar instead (you can buy these usually in the grocery store by the produce).  Even better reheated!

I made this for Easter dinner and it was very good but I had no idea how to roast garlic. It ended up being more time consuming than I thought it would be. I used 1/2 the amount of garlic and cheese as someone else had suggested.

This recipe was missing the creaminess that I like in my mashed potatoes.  I added sour cream, but half & half might work better.  I also added more garlic.  The end result was a nice base recipe that is lacking what it needs to be really good.  I’ll keep working with this one.

This was great!!! I didnt use the romano cheese (cause boyfriend dislikes) and added some milk while mashing witch gave them a creamy texture. What a nice change from the same old same old mashed potatoes! Can't wait to try it with the romano cheese added.

I do not understand how this recipe could get such rave reviews when I could not stand it.  I thought maybe I did something wrong....but I followed this recipe to the tee....even whipping out the calculator for exact serving calculations.  The romano cheese...being softer than a parmesan made the dish almost gelatinous to me....and I love Romano!  Just not for me.

I served this at a dinner party (cut the portion down to 10 servings) and it was a hit!  Although I only used about a tablespoon full of pressed garlic, it still seemed like too much.  No one else thought it was too garlicy but I guess that's just a matter of opinion!  This recipe still gets 5 stars from me.

This was sooooooo good!  Used a whole head of roasted garlic, even though I cut the recipe to serve 6, and it was fantastic.  However, I will cut down a little on the Oregano next time.  Made this with Baby Back Ribs (also found here), and wow did the two go hand in hand!

These were phenomonal!!!  I made these for my boyfriends birthday party and everybody raved about them.  I took the idea to roast the garlic from one of the reviews and added half roasted, half fresh garlic.  I definitely think the cheese is the "secret" ingredient.  You MUST make these!!!!

Very good. I used less butter and added warm half & half. The raw garlic was a little strong if you're not a serious garlic fan. I might try half raw half roasted garlic next time.

This was one of the best potato recipes that I have had.  They reminded me of ones that I have had in a fancy steak restuarant.  I will definitely make these for myself and guests.  They were awesome with the prime rib I made for Christmas dinner.  Just right moisture and all.  We could not find grated romano so we used shredded.  They still turned out great.  I think the cheese is the "secret" ingredient.

These are AWESOME, I could not stop eating them after I made them!  (finally had to stop myself since I'm bringing them to work for a potluck tomorrow)  They did seem a little dry after I made them......I don't know if I did something wrong or what, the only thing I did differently from the recipe was use margarine instead of butter, could that have been the problem??  Anyway, it wasn't a big deal, I just added about 1/4 cup milk and 1/4 cup sour cream, and all was well with the world.  These are really great!!!

These were very good but I added extra garlic and I will probably leave out the oregano next time.

I guess I dont like raw garlic in recipes.  I think it would have been much better if it had been sauted or something.  The overall flavor was wonderful, though!
