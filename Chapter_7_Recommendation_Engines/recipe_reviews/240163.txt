This was a hit with both the adults and the kids! I did reduce the milk by a cup, so the pudding mixture would be thicker. Also, I saved some oreo's to sprinkle on top...a keeper, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

So easy to make and super yummy! I used cookies and cream pudding mix instead of chocolate and it was amazing! ??

Made the pie per directions except I accidentally bought 'cook and serve' instead of instant pudding. Also used light whip cream. It was a big hit with the family especially the kids. Quick, super easy, delicious!

This was a great dessert but honestly I served it to 10 adults and 5 children. The children loved it and while the adults enjoyed it, it was a bit too much for adults in the way of chocolate and whip cream. Flavour was great though and it was really easy to make so that's why I'm giving it full stars.

This tastes very good and was really easy. I used a graham cracker crust, and only one package of pudding mix, but it turned out well.
