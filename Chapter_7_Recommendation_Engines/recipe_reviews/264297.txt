I made this omitting mushrooms (because my family would rather go hungry than eat a mushroom) and subbing Worcestershire sauce for soy sauce (per reviews). Based on some reviews I upped the pasta to a 12oz box. I used gluten free rotini for noodles, I grew up with macaroni in my goulash though. It was a pretty tasty and there weren't too many complaints about dinner from my family. Just a daughter complaining about tomato chunks but she still ate it

My very first experience with the Instant Pot... It was like it was 1958 and my Mother cooked this Goulash... (No higher praise can be given) Both taste and consistency was spot on... Better than a trip to Wal Mart...

Overall a solid, very quick, fairly healthy, and low calorie meal. If anyone was wondering, this recipe yields about 10 cups. 

There was extra liquid when it first finished cooking, like someone else was saying - and that's despite the extra onions, mushrooms, meat, and noodles I added. I would recommend adding only 1.5-2 cups of water instead of 2.5, adding corn, and using 3-3.5 cups of noodles (shell noodles in particular).

Substituted Worcestershire Sauce for the Soy Sauce and used 8 oz. gluten free 100% corn penne rigate  pasta.  Served with red hot pepper flakes to taste.  DELICIOUS!!!  No problem with too much liquid...

Didn't have an instant pot so I made this on the stovetop, I followed directions & it came out great. I've been making this exact recipe for around 5 years now & it pleases everyone who eats it. The only thing I changed was I used 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilies. This is a great dish like when there were no instant pots, cell phones, smart tv's, just like my Mom made when I was growing up!!

This was very good.  Will make it again.  Here is where I deviated from the published recipe:  used Worchestershire instead of soy sauce, used 12 oz of penne, used 8 oz of chopped mushrooms (a bit more than a pint), 2 cups of water, and because my diced tomatoes were Italian style, used only 1 tbl of Italian seasoning.  When finished, it still had more liquid than I wanted, so put it on "low saute" for ten minutes.  The end result was the consistency I wanted.  Next time, I will use only 1.5 cups of water.

Having read some reviews, I left the mushrooms out because my husband and don't care for them.  I used worchestershire sauce instead of soy sauce , used less water and less tomato sauce and added more shell pasta.  It still came out a little more like soup but this was only my second recipe using the Instant Pot.  Yes, I'll try it again.

We enjoyed this tonight, but made it with only one can each of tomato sauce and diced tomatoes.  It was thick and very tasty.

This is very good but it isn't goulash, it's Pasta Bolognese. It's a very good Pasta Bolognese. I may try making it without the pasta and less water as simply Bolognese sauce.

I just made this for dinner tonight.  It was amazing!  I loved it!  I used 4 cloves of garlic instead of 3 because...  garlic....    For the diced tomatoes, I used the Italian flavored cans.  For mushrooms, I used baby bellas (portabelllas). Everything else was the same.  I LOVED it!

Made this last night in our instant pot.  Added can of green beans and corn, 12oz of gluten-free rigatoni, only 1 can of diced tomatoes and 2C water.  Wife likes her pasta soft, so we added more cook time (about 5 min) on the back end to be sure they were done.  This was a mistake.  The pasta was really mushy and there was no liquid.  It still had good flavor and if we make again, will not skimp on liquid or adjust cook time.

I made this tonight for dinner, and my family loved it. I did make some changes, but some were for ingredients I didn't have. Instead of the pint of fresh mushrooms, I used 2 cans of sliced mushrooms. Instead of the 2 1/2 cups of water, I used 1 1/2 cups of beef broth since other reviews suggested the 2 1/2 cups of water in the recipe was too much. I had only 2 8 ounce cans of tomato sauce on hand, so I reconstituted 2 small cans of tomato paste with 1 can of water. I also used Worcestershire sauce instead of soy sauce as other reviewer did since the soy sauce would add too much salt. I did all of the cutting and chopping ahead of time and had everything ready to go into the pot as needed. By doing this, preparing this meal was incredibly fast. The results were very good and the consistency of the goulash was perfect. For 3 of us, this recipe made enough for tonight's meal and one meal to freeze for later. I will definitely be making this again.

Doubled all ingredients except Soy and water and sauce. 4 tbls Soy.  1 Cup of water and 1 Cup of tomato juice strained from diced tomatoes.  Substituted Green Pepper for the mushroom. Added some Lowry's garlic seasoning and used elbow macaroni with the spines.  Used to 2 regular cans of campbell's tomato soup (no water added) and 15oz of hunts tomato sauce. 4mins was the perfect pressure cook time. Came out excellent.

Flavor is very good, but it had WAY too much liquid and not enough noodles.  Would probably make a decent soup.
