Using the golden mushroom soup instead of the traditional cream of mushroom soup was SO much better. Not only in appearance but also in flavor. This was excellent and ridiculously easy to make too. The one thing I will  mention is that made as written, the green beans are under-cooked and crunchy. This is how we like them but if you like a softer green bean you'll want to add to the cook time.
