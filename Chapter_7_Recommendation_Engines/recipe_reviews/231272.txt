This needed just a hint of help to be 4 stars as it was lacking some flavor, so I'll give it the four because it IS better than a three star recipe and it's easy to fix.  The issues are not enough tomato flavor, which is easily fixed my adding some tomato paste, and it needed and herb of some sort so I felt oregano would work well.  Other than that, I used red bell pepper as a preference and chopped the top and cooked it with the onion.  The directions don't say when to add the garlic, so I added it when the onions started to turn translucent. I'm not a big spicy person so I used less cayenne, and instead of mozzarella, I thought using Mexican cheese blend went better.  I liked really the outcome with these changes!

This is the way our family likes stuffed peppers. We use red and yellow peppers but everything else is as the recipe states. Add a green salad and you have a nice meal.

This was a great dish, but it was missing something. I couldn't put my finger on it but the flavor was definitely lacking an ingredient. Instead of water I as well used chicken broth but it was my homemade broth instead of store bought. maybe try again
