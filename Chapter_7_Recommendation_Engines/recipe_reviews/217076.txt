I made this for dinner tonight, but just took a taste. After marinating over night, the flavors are really well melded! I made one big mistake and realized that my can of black beans was really a can of dark kidney beans. The dish still came out really well, though next time I'll be making it with the black beans (which are my favorite!) For a little more flavor, I'll add a diced jalapeno as well. My only complaint is the amount of sauce! So much as just sitting at the bottom, so next time I will reduce that not quite by half. Thanks for the great cold, NO COOK bean salad!

Very easy and tasty! I made as written and found nothing needs changing. I found the salad yields more than 8 servings plus lots of dressing. Next time I will add some chopped celery as a personal preference and perhaps extra beans and/or corn for a better dressing/bean ratio.

I made this 24 hrs ago. The dressing is very light and the flavor blends well with the vegetables. I just didn't think it had enough flavor because it is very mild. I don't know if I will make this again as I think it definitely needed another flavor and I am not sure what yet. I had plenty of dressing, actually just right. If you are looking for something with more spice, this isn't the recipe for you, but if you like a very mild subtle flavor, this is it.
