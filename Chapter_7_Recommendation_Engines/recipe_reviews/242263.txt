Ok, these are amazing.  I had chimichurri sauce frozen from another recipe. Mine was super potent so I didn't use a cup. I will definitely make this again. I buttered the top of the potato that I cut off and crisped it in the oven when I reheated the potatoes.  It was a good crunch. ;) The extra sauce drizzled on top is perfect.
