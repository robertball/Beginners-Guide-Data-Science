Other than the fact that the chocolate chips sank to the bottom, this recipe is fantastic!  I could see using cherries or raspberries in it also.  I didn't have a 6x8 pan so I just used 2 loaf pans.  Would definitely recommend!

I ended up using fresh strawberries that had gotten frozen in my fridge when the temperature was too high. I also left out the chocolate chips because I am not a fan of crunchy things in my brownies, I never put walnuts in them either.

Also as it wasn't passover I put 1 cup regular flour. They made the house smell really nice and tasted really good.

I did make a double recipe and cooked it in one large pan and they came out all right but needed to cook for an hour instead of 45 minutes

I made it in a 9x13 pan. I have made it several times during the year since I found it on Allrecipes in 2015. It's a great Passover recipe.  It's really delicious and not too hard to make at all. Debi18

45 minutes sounded like a long time but actually needed a few more minutes
