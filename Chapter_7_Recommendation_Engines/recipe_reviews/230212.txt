Wonderful recipe if you're a pumpkin pie fan...all those wonderful smelling and tasty spices (my 16 year old son said the house "smelled like Christmas"). My mother has celiac disease so I was looking for a nice dessert to make for our Thanksgiving dinner. She's not a big pumpkin pie fan but I'm convinced it's because she hasn't found the right one yet....I think I hit it with this recipe. She (and everyone else who tried it) absolutely loved it. Without the crust, it seems like a much lighter yet rich dessert. Will absolutely make again! This is a keeper. I changed absolutely nothing. Thank you for a wonderful alternative to the traditional pie.

This recipe is GREAT.  Completely ignore the photo.  Bake this in a circular 9-inch pie plate and it is picture perfect.  I did not include the pecans, and since there was no crust that started to brown before the pie was set, I was able to time it perfectly, and it done while still a beautiful bright orange.  I wouldn't think of this as a gluten-free recipe, I'd never make a pumpkin pie again in any other way.

Great recipe! I used egg beaters and almond milk to cut the calories and used pumpkin pie spice. Used a few crushed ginger snaps to line pan but they were mushy. Will sprinkle on top next time.  Husband loved it.

My sister made this for me on Thanksgiving as I am gluten and sugar free.  She subbed stevia for the sugar and upped the spices somewhat.  She used coconut milk in a can (yeah, no regular milk any more either).  Delish!  
The pecans topping adds a lot to this - you won't miss the crust with those lovely pecans to give it added texture.  
Thank you, Anita (I am also an Anita!) and to my sister, Dee.

Great!  I sprayed the pie pan lightly with Pam, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Made it for a friend who is gluten intolerant, but we all loved it!

I made this for my ladies bible study as a couple of ladies are allergic to wheat.  It was a huge hit and everyone (non glutten free incuded) wanted the recipe.  I only gave it 4 stars as 1/2 cup sugar is not enough.  I tasted the batter before baking and it wasn't even sweet.  1 cup provided that true pumpkin flavor. Definitely add the nuts as it adds great flavor and texture.  I served them on cut in squares on flattened muffin liners.

Thank you very much Anita Schoeb for taking the time out to share this Gluten Free Crustless Pumpkin Pie recipe with me. Pumpkin Pie is my favorite! This is my first gluten-free recipe. This makes me feel better about changing my cooking and eating habits to a gluten-free diet.

I mixed everything and realized that my pie dish was left at a friend's. I had no choice but to bake in a square 8x8 pan. It required longer in the oven. I also used homemade pumpkin puree but was sure to weigh 15 oz. The pecan topping was nice and made it less painful to not have a crust.(I love a good crust). The pecans could probably use to be doubled. This is still a nice dessert that I will make for my family again. Thanks Anita.

This recipe is awesome! I sub out the evaporated milk for unsweetened vanilla coconut milk to make it dairy free.  I also put it in a gluten free praline crust and follow the same cooking instructions and it is the most amazing thing anyone has ever had!  I am going to try w "flax eggs" to make it vegan, hope it stays as delicious as I make it now

Wonderful, easy recipe.  I followed it with a few tweeks for my own tastes.  I often make pumpkin pie with sour cream and so I substituted 1/2 cup of sour cream for some of the evaporated milk.  I did add vanilla to the spice combo.  I chopped the pecans in the Cuisinart with a 1/4 cup brown sugar and then spread them on top of the pie after it had already begun to bake.  The result was heavenly - light,  spicy and so satisfying.   I didn't miss the crust at all!

Awesome base recipe!  I made a few adjustments based on other reviews and other recipes.   Since it was for Thanksgiving, I upped the brown sugar to 3/4 cup for a little more sweetness, added 1/4 c flour and 3/4 tsp baking powder in with everything.  Spice adjustments were 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp allspice, 1/8 tsp cloves and vanilla.  Topped with a rolled oat and brown sugar streusel (1/4 c each...no butter.)

I substituted Splenda Brown Sugar and almond milk. Did not add pecans. Kept it low carb and diabetic friendly. Only 11g carbs per serving!

Really grateful for this recipe!! I used fresh pumpkin purée that I'd baked the day before and it is delicious!! The pie had a mousse or custard like texture in my opinion, and was not as dense as with canned pumpkin. It benefits from the crunch of the pecans. Making it again!!

Used egg white substitute (forgot to buy the eggs when shopping). It was fabulous. Got rave reviews. Was even better for breakfast the next day. This one is going in the permanent collection. Taking it to my sisters for Friendsgiving.

It is ok, and the texture is nice, but I didn't feel like the sugar and spice ratios were quite right. I also thought that the pecans on top took away from the overall flavor, despite the fact that I love pecans.

Marvelous recipe, especially in the fall as the weather cools!  I increased sugars: using 1/2 cup of sucanat (vs brown sugar) and 1/2 cup of organic cane juice crystals. I also added 1/4 tsp of allspice. I lightly greased the pie plate to make it easier to serve pieces of pie. Pecans are a great touch!

I made this according to directions. I was hesitant on how many spices and how much was to be added but did so anyway. I also have never used brown sugar but again did so anyway. I used a 9" pie pan to bake it on that I sprayed with olive oil first. I baked for 60' at temp called for in recipe and it turned out fine except for the spices and it could have used more sugar I will stick with the pumpkin pie recipe and just not use the crust next time.

Everyone keeps asking me to make this again and again. Recipe is perfect as written, but because my husband is diabetic I used Truvia to sweeten and also subbed in egg whites to keep the calories down. Such a great and easy pie.

I substituted condensed almond milk for the condensed milk. Looks scrumptious, waiting for it to cool to dig in.

Used 1/2 cup white truvia in place of brown sugar and substituted vanilla almond milk for the evaporated milk. Doubled + the cinnamon for a FABULOUS treat!!!

I left out the cloves but this pie was as a goodbye as any pumpkin pie sans crust.  No artificial sweetener or other garbage!

I am doing low carb so made this and substituted the brown sugar for stevia in the raw. Great recipe and I will definitely make again. Very easy.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was a little soft, but my family loved it! It didn't matter that it was gluten free. I used the pumpkin spice I had on hand instead of each spice separately, using the measurements needed for each spice. I also added a little more sugar to the recipe. What made it a winner, was the candied pecans I added on top, using a recipe I found on this site.

This was fantastic. I added each of the spice ingredients individually instead of using pumpkin pie spice. I made half with nuts and half without. I liked the half without better.

Very good if you have to stay away from gluten or are watching your calories.  Would make it again. For sure.

Made this for my diabetic husband because of the fewer carbs with no crust. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of individual spices and it worked well. We love it and I will be making this again.

EXCELLENT! Followed the recipe exactly and this came out delicious. Whole family loved it. I wondered how it would come out with no crust but it was delicious and easy to scoop out of the pie dish.
