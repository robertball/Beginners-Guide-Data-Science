Simply wonderful! What an awesome flavor! I think the mayo mixture makes it! If you can have the mayo then don't leave out the sauce!

This recipe was fantastic and I highly recommend it.  The coconut (barring allergy of course) is a must to cool the heat of the hot sauce and curry paste and the blend of flavors was perfect.  What an adventure to find these ingredients, though!  I added new stores to my shopping arsenal, and think that this is the perfect recipe to introduce Thai into a kitchen.

Awesome burgers. I like a little more kick so for 2bls of chicken i added 1 tsp of cyanne pepper. also divided the topping 1/2 sour cream 1/2 mayo and put a 1/4 cup more coconut because i had the packaged flakes and not fresh.

This recipe is GREAT and is totally flexible.  I used it with chicken the first time and beef tonight, and both were AMAZING.  Very flexible too.  I've used just lemon juice (no lime), dried herbs (instead of fresh), and regular bread crumbs (no pako) and it blew everyones taste buds away at my bbq last weekend.  TRY IT -- it is not overly spicy!  My guests raved, devoured everything and told me i was a genius!  I had to copy the recipe on my fax machine because nobody wanted to leave without it.

Very good! I used Peanut Butter instead of Peanut Sauce and served the burgers on toasted rolls with grated carrot, cheese, avocado & lettuce. The mint / coconut sauce was the best part. I used half sour cream & half mayo as I find mayo too sweet on it's own.

To sum up, YUM!  I usually make regular chicken burgers, so this was a great change.  Here's what I did differently:  I didn't have any red curry paste, so I added a whole lot of cayanne, also, I didn't have any lemons, so I just added a little more lime juice.  I also didn't have any mint, so I just added the mayo (Miracle Whip) and coconut together.  I didn't let it mingle for an hour, but the flavours of the mayo were still great.  I'm looking forward to making some to freeze for our camping trip!  Thanks for the terrific recipe!

EXCELLENT flavor!!! I used ground turkey and only 1 1/2 cups of regular bread crumbs, but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I wasn't as impressed with the sauce, and now that I've read the reviews, I'll try the sour cream/mayo mix. I also think a fresh mango salsa or chutney would be great on these burgers.

My husband and I love Thai food. These were really good grilled on the Webber. We couldn't get the kids to try them though. I didn't make the Mayo sauce since my husband is on a low Cholesterol diet. They heated up wonderfully the next day for lunch too. I will make these again! YUM!

These were very good once I made a few changes for my families taste.  I used cilantro in both the burger and sauce - not the mint or parsley.  I added the peanut sauce and peanut butter to the sauce recipe.  In the buglers, I only used lime and didn't add the hot pepper sauce - the red curry paste is spicy enough for us.  I made these very small, to fit on dinner rolls - great appetizer or small dinner plate!  I would now give it a 5 star rating

I really liked these a lot. I used ground turkey and instead of peanut butter, I used a powdered peanut butter product to save calories. I also accidentlly added mint to the burger, so I had mint in the mayo AND in the burger. it wasn't too much. I was able to cut way back on the panko as well. The only thing I would do differently next time is mix up the liquids and paste first and then add the meat. I had a few bites of meat that had a lot of the curry paste and some that didn't have enough so I think mixing the stuff before adding the meat would result in a better distribution. I made mine on my stovetop grill pan.. they are really tasty

Wasn't sure about the mayo but it was the perfect complement - substituted light mayo and added a tsp of lemon juice.  Also cut the bread crumbs by half and texture was much lighter without loss of flavor.  Husband said he will stand outside BBQing in winter again anytime for these!

These turned out SO much better than I thought they would!! The mayo mixture was OK, not my fav but still good on this recipe. I used peanut butter instead of the peanut sauce- I think thats what kept them SO moist- however next time Ill add a little less because it was just a tad over powering. I tried frying them and baking them in the oven, both worked out great!

Nice change from the regular type of burger. We weren't huge fans of the mayo though, we preferred ours with additional peanut sauce.

These were fantastic! Spicy, complex flavor and super easy to make. The coconut mint mayo is a must - do not skip it! Mine took longer to cook than the recipe suggested though, probably closer to 30 minutes overall, but I made six big burgers instead of eight, so I'm sure that had something to do with it. It was kind of hard to tell when they were done, since the red curry paste and the hot sauce give them the permanent color of "undercooked chicken." I wound up having to use a meat thermometer to make sure I wasn't going to get us sick. Overall, a great recipe though, and one I'll be keeping. Thanks!

Loved the burger! Added spinach, and onions after.  Did not use the dressing, but used mustard and it worked well.

These are truly amazing.  I didn't use the mayo/coconut mixture, but I didn't change the burger recipe at all.  These were great and had excellent, unique flavor.  I will make these again soon as my boyfriend told me they were excellent about 5 times while eating them. :)

This recipe was fantastic! A definite keeper. The ingredients blend well and the taste is wonderful. These burgers are better served with a crustier bread than the regular hamburger bun...I would suggest something like a ciabatta.

I really enjoyed these - I think they'd be equally good with ground turkey (which also might give it a slightly better texture). I'd also like to try this recipe with ground beef.

Really Awesome!  Made this exactly as recipe calls except substituted a diced jalapeno and some curry powder for the curry paste(didn't have any).  I was leary of the mayo but it was great for dipping burgers.  Served the patties on a bed of lightly dressed greens lower carb style.

I had some ground chicken I bought on sale and my sister and her Thai husband were visiting so I thought they would enjoy this.  They did--and it's so versitale, they ate it with rice, I had it as a burger.  It would make a good wrap too!  I couldn't find red curry paste, used curry powder instead and italian seasoned bread crumbs instead of panko.  Still tasted great!

These are FANTASTIC!! I love the flavor and the coconut-mint mayo is a perfect compliment! My dad who is SUPER DUPER picky and never tries anything new actually surprised me and tried one and he had to come back for seconds! Seriously he forgot all about the burgers he made! haha Now trust me that is saying A LOT! They are good on the grill or I've made them on my foreman grill and they are just as awesome! The only issue I have is not knowing when they are cooked fully with them being red so make sure you have your dandy meat thermometer handy! Thanks for the recipe its a real winner!

turned out great!! Funny also, because i have to admit that i didn't follow the recipe instructions, and ended up adding mayo and coconut and mint to the burger instead of making a side sauce with it. i didn't add nearly as much mayo as called, because i didn't have enough... lucky that or i would have had sauce burgers! but it still tasted great!! go figure. it's a good win-win recipe.

These turned out great. Followed recipe exactly, with the one exception of using coconut milk instead of actual coconut (bf was afraid of the texture). The mayo really complimented the burger. Delicious. Oh, and chicken burgers do not shrink like beef burgers!

Have made this recipe at least 15 times. In-laws beg for it and fight over leftovers. Excellent. Only suggestions: reduce the panko or they are a bit dry; mix wet first, mix chicken and panko, then combine; pack each ball into a biscuit cutter for perfect round circles (can tamp down to desired thickness). The mayo makes them superb - I make double sauce it is so popular. Use a fresh jar of mayo. Even with the curry paste and hot sauce, these are not overly spicy - my young kids love. Bonus: you can make and cook the patties even a day or two in advance, and just reheat right before serving with no loss in quality whatsoever.

I rate this one as only OK. I'm a big fan of Thai food, but this one was a little weak.  Not popular with the kids either - and they are fairly adventurous eaters.  Probably won't make this one again.

So good! I made it with Turkey as well, and added some carmalized onions and sweet chili sauce on top. Fantastic! Thanks for sharing!

felt everything was overpowered by the peanut butter.. bf liked it though.. maybe it's bc i didn't follow the recipe to a T and only used what i had in the house.. i left out the breadcrumbs, used peanut butter for the thai peanut sauce, forgot the hot pepper sauce, used regular onion, cilantro for parsley, garlic powder for fresh, all bottled lemon juice for the citrus, and ground turkey for the chicken.. for the mayo sauce i used dried mint for fresh.. i just wasn't impressed

I am giving it 4 stars only because of the amount of panko bread crumbs. I halved the recipe and added only 1 cup of panko and that was way too much. I think 1/2 cup would be perfect, but I will have to play around with it. The extra panko cut down the wonderful flavors that should have shined through and made the burger tangy and nice. It also made the burger dry instead of juicy. I didn't make the sauce that is in the recipe as I didn't have coconut, so I topped with a mango, tomato and avocado salsa.

I've tried many Thai burger recipes, and this one is absolutely the best!  Great for cook-out parties!  I've used it  often!

These were delicious!  Ours were not dry at all, in fact they were tender.  We used ground turkey, though, maybe that made the difference.  I didn't have any limes, so I used all lemon juice.  Ours were only mildy spicy, perhaps it was the brand of curry paste we used.  We will definitely make these again.

Wonderful! Great flavor. I served them with the mayo but also a chipotle mustard I found in the store.

Really good.  Burgers were grilled and enjoyed at a cook out.  Burgers were slightly dry - always a challenge with ground chicken.

OMG this was delicious! Only changes I made were a white onion (didn't have any green) and the amount of hot pepper sauce since I can't handle a lot of heat. Just wish that I'd done a stir fry or something to go with it.

Flavors on these were good. I cooked them stovetop and found I had to reduce the temperature to a medium low and cook them longer to get them cooked through. Might be in part because I slightly scaled up the recipe because ground chicken isn't sold in pounds at my local grocery store.

I also substituted oats for part of the bread crumbs due to running out. That worked fine.

Very, very good, and with just a few minor changes - excellent!  I used ground turkey, as it was what I had on hand.  I omitted the hot sauce and used 1/2 tsp. hot chili flakes (just because I like the appearance of the little red flakes in the burger and it seemed more "authentic").  Replaced the chopped parsley with chopped basil for added Thai flavour.  Also added 1 tsp. minced ginger from a jar.  Didn't have ready-made peanut sauce as we usually make it fresh when needed, so added 2 Tbsp. chunky peanut butter with a tsp. each of fish sauce and soy sauce as a replacement.  Tip - when using extra-lean ground turkey, use only 2 cups of panko to avoid dryness.  Served topped with a mixture of julienne carrots, cucumbers and red onion in a sweet vinaigrette (see Chef John's thai chicken burger recipe as a guide).  Sounds like a lot , but minor changes overall.  Also, this meat mixture is excellent cooked crumbled in a frypan to use in lettuce wraps!  Definitely a keeper, thanks!

Everyone liked these. In fact one husband asked his wife to get the recipe.I followed many other reviews and cut the panko crumbs to 1 1/4 cups and did not put in the hot sauce as we are wimps. Very tasty. Instead of the mayo topping (we can't eat eggs) I put extra peanut sauce on the burger. Thanks for the recipe.

This was great! The panko crumbs give them a crispy crust on the outside. The only thing I would change is I would add some salt

Awesome! I tried these with ground turkey and they were so good. I used half mayo/half sour cream for the sauce and it was unbeleivable. My husband who hates Thai food LOVED these (I left out the word Thai when I told him what was for dinner!)I will definitely make them again and again.

I did not like these very much.  I made them for a lge group and was a little embaressed by them. I found the burgers to really taste like the crumbs and also the texture of the crumbs and dry like the crumbs  sigh....Other than that I liked the combo of the other ingred so I will try again?!  but not on anyone but immediate family first!!
