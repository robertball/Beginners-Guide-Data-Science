Great pear custard dessert. I covered the bottom of the dish in the batter and placed in the oven for 10 minutes. This added a firmer bottom to the calfloutis. I make may fruit variations

Will try this for Thanksgiving! I've been making a lot of clafoutis versions recently but haven't yet tried pear. It's been a crowd pleaser....I like my 'base' recipe(very similar) that I've been using but will add brandy per your suggestion.
