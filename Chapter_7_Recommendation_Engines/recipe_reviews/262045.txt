First of all, this recipe makes way too much! I even left out a couple ounces of the noodle as it looked like it would be too much. Of course, I was making this for three people but two of those people have big appetites so I thought it would be fine. Hubby didn’t like the texture of the shiitake mushrooms so next time I make this (yes, I will make it again with changes) I plan on using cremini or regular white mushrooms.  The taste was really not bad but we each did put in some sriracha as we like things to be a bit more hot/spicy. It just didn’t impress. As I said though, I plan on making it again, cutting everything in half and changing up the mushrooms, maybe throwing in some hot peppers.

This was relatively easy (just a lot of slicing of veggies) and was tasty.  I didn't add the spinach, but still thought it had a good amount of veggies.

Ooops!  I spiralized a regular sweet potato and used that instead of dangmyun, but it still turned out great!

Delicious! The method works perfectly and the balance of flavors and textures is spot on. I used bok choy instead of spinach. Thank you for the recipe.
