Can you spell YUM?!!?!  Easy and simple recipe.  I bought 10 lbs. of carrots accidentally and didn't want any to go to waste.  Carrot soup was the perfect answer.  Low-fat, low-cal, tastes great  and FILLING!  I added 4 whole cloves of  garlic, didn't peel anything (except the onions) and boiled it all together.  Pureed the mixture, added 2 Tbls. cilantro, extra chili powder and juice from a whole lime.  If you don't have chili paste, use chili powder, salt and vinegar (base ingredients to chili paste).  This soup defined comfort food!!  I will definently make it again!  This would be a great starter for a Thanksgiving feast. Oh!! I also added 2 extra carrots! ;0) Enjoy!!

I've had this soup 3 times in the last month.  I love it.  One small thing I did that brings out the flavors even more was adding lemon juice to taste.  My only complaint was I could not find Chili Paste.  I had to substitute something that (I hope) is similar.

MMMMMMMMM!!! Ten out of ten... for Ease, Speed, Flexibility, Comfort, Satisfaction and Great Taste.    chunky or not, thicker or thinner, veg broth or chicken, lots of lemon juice or less, sour cream or no, tortilla chips on bottom of the bowl or not, tons of cilantro or a bit, opening course of a lovely mexican meal or a light comforting lunch/dinner.  YEP.. A total keeper and a staple on our menus from now on.

I served this at a mexican feast that I made for a friends birthday. Everyone loved it, especially the men.  They asked me to give their wives the recipe. I used a little chili powder and some very hot sauce instead of the chili paste.  Worked great. this will be a staple in our house from now on.  bye bye tomato soup.

Very good! I used a lot more cilantro than stated, and also a tiny splash of lime juice. The chile paste I used was incredibly hot, so I sloshed in some half-and-half. Thanks, Jennifer!

I forgot to add chili at first but the soup tasted so much better with it.  Also, it's better the next day.

This is delicious!  Of course I added more garlic, cilantro and chile paste than called for - I love a lot of flavor.  I added a dollop of non-fat sour cream on top and it was the perfect compliment to the sweet/spicy flavor of the soup.  Very good!

Bland as is. Double the amount of chili paste, garlic, and cilantro. Stir in more fresh cilantro, the juice of one lime, and a good amount of kosher salt at the end... delicious!

I should have made this as written! I substituted beef broth because that's what I had, and to me it tasted a little like leftover broth when you make a pot roast. However, husband loves pot roast and he loved this soup!

I didn't have any cilantro so I added about a tsp of cumin plus a few dashes of season salt, black pepper, and 1 dash of nutmeg.  I used chile flakes instead of paste as other reviewers commented on it being too hot.  I added a few Tbl flour to the onion/oil mix (I also added a touch of bacon grease here) to make a rue to thicken the soup.  Turned out great!  Great way to add a veggie side dish to a mexican meal.

I don't like many vegetables, esp carrots, but "hiding" them in soup is a great idea! I used red pepper flakes instead of chile paste and added chipotle powder. After blending, I added shredded chicken, corn, and black beans. This soup was SO GOOD and very filling with the add-ins. Thank you!

This was excellent!  I doubled the recipe.  I added celery and sauteed the onion, garlic and celery until the onions caramelized.  I added the carrots, potato and used chicken broth.  I boiled until the vegetables were tender.  I then blended the soup with the cilantro and 1 t. lemon juice.  I added a dash of chili powder and salt to taste.  My 7 year old had 2 bowls!

I made this soup tonight and it wasn't bad for carrot soup. I didn't have high expectations but needed a recipe to help get rid of my carrots. My son finished his bowl and my husband thought it was ok.

Great soup with a real mexican flare. I loved this soup as did my roommates however it did not freeze well. After being frozen it appeared as though it had somehow curdled but it did not affect the taste in any way so it was still tasty.

I love this soup, and now get free carrots from my friends garden if I give him some of this soup in return.  I did ,however, put in less chile paste than called for, otherwise it's too hot for me.

I have been waiting a long time to review this recipe.  I have made it 3 times without the chili paste.  I could not find it anywhere and then my DD gave me a bottle for Xmas that she finally found at Whole Foods.  When I made the first time I used chili powder mixed in with the cilantro and garlic.  We loved the flavor!  But I thought that the chili paste was the secret ingredient so was anxious to try as written.  Actually I love it with the chili powder and red pepper flakes as it has more of a kick.   I do not blend mine in the blender but just mash the ingredients with my potato masher to make a small chunky soup.  I had printed this recipe out 2 yrs ago and just made for the first time about 3 months ago.  Great, "makes U feel good" recipe.  Like chicken soup, says MOM!

I make this soup all the time, especially when I have a lot of carrots.  However, I LOVE cilantro and think the taste is wasted when you use it at the beginning of the recipe. I use 1 tbsp of dried cilantro instead, and then add the fresh cilantro at the end before I blend. Then you can actually taste it! I also like to add a bit of milk at the end to make it a bit more creamy.  Regardless, this soup is a staple recipe in our house!

A very delicious recipe and simple once all the veggies are cut.  I did virtually double the recipe, except for the onion and chili paste and used 3 cans of chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth.  Wow.. just have to say that my version had a KICK with the chili garlic paste that I used from the Asian market (with the green cap).  It was very hot and spicy.  Of course you can easily adjust this to your taste and even modify with chili powder or red pepper flakes.  Definitely a keeper, especially since it's so healthy!

When it comes to making homemade soups, my biggest problem is getting the darn thing smooth enough! Mine had the consistency of a salsa- slighty smooth, slighty chunky. Regardless, this is still a good soup. I was a bit spice crazy, and used (a lot) more chile paste than stated, probably about 3 tablespoons worth (good thing I can stand the heat). I also used a lot more cilantro, beef broth instead of vegetable (it is what I had) and had to omit the potatoes (didn't have any on hand). Definitely worth making again, and hopefully I'll learn the secret to getting a smooth soup. Thank you DONOGHUEJ!

We thought this soup was excellent - the quality of a fine restaurant.  I substituted crushed red pepper for chili paste, and added extra garlic and cilantro because I love these seasonings.  Great soup.

Really much better than I thought.  I could not locate the hand blender to save my life, so it was thicker and more of a puree.  It was also better a few days later.  Love spicy food, so I won't be as shy with the chili paste next time.

Delicious!!! I did not have chili paste and used chili powder instead. Instead of a peeled potato, I used the flaky stuff from the box (lazy!) after blending which worked great in thickening the soup. I love cilantro, so I used way more than the recipe called for. I added half of the chopped cilantro after the mixture was blended which preserves its taste better. At the very end, I added a little lemon juice which made even more perfect. Thanks for sharing!

I made this into Cilantro lime and black bean soup. Used this recipe as the base. I won't add carrot next time I make it for orange soup is not appealing and carrot adds zero flavor. I used about 4 squeezed limes and a ton of cilantro to taste. Very good!

Love this soup -- it's easy to make, low fat, and delicious.  Sour cream is good as a garnish on the finished product, and also takes out some of the heat if you make it too spicy.

So yum and so simple!  I didn't have any cilantro, but did add some cumin and coriander.  I had it as a light dinner with tortilla chips and sharp cheddar cheese sprinkled in.  Excited for the leftovers!

Left out the cilantro since I can't stand it, but otherwise was Very good.  I doubled the veggies but left the stock the same.  Used chicken stock since that's what I had around.  Overdid it on the siracha (chili paste was hiding) but will make again.  Added a dollop of greek yogurt on top to cool it off with a squeeze of lime.

My husband and I loved this recipe. Since I love cilantro, I added 1/2 cup fresh cilantro instead of 1 tbs, 2 tsp chile paste instead of 1, added 1/2 of a red bell pepper (diced), 1 tbs ginger paste, 2 tbs cream cheese, 1/8 tsp red pepper flakes, and 1 tsp lime juice. I also used a fine grater to grate the carrots and potatoes (I used 2 russets instead of a large one) before I started cooking so that I wouldn't have to blend afterwords and the consistency was delightful. The soup was full-bodied and was a full meal in itself. I served it with some fresh french bread on the side. I will DEFINITELY be making this soup again! :)

This was easy and delicious.  The flavors were subtle.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, b/c I didn't have any veggie.  When mentioning this recipe, everyone was like "ugh! carrot soup", but this had even my kids loving it!  Definitely will make this many times over.

this was very easy make and tasted pretty good. I more than doubled the garlic and used more cilantro for garnishing. I didn't know what chili paste is so I used Sriracha. Again, it was very good but I probaby won't make it again.

I was shocked by how good this soup was.  I admit I made this recipe with pretty low expectations, I mean, how great can carrot soup be?  But this recipe is fantastic!  I tried it both with half and half to make a cream soup and without and it's delicious both ways.  I did add more cilantro than the recipe called for and substituted red pepper flakes for the chile.  Also, one caveat, my soup didn't not look as pretty as the one in the picture - for some reason it was more brownish than orange.

I didn't have any chili paste, so I just threw some crushed red pepper into the pot when everything was simmering together. It turned out well. Pretty good.

Loved it. I had never thought about using carrots as the main ingredient in a soup. I was out for lunch with a friend and carrot soup was on the menu. It was so good I had to find the recipe. This is it!! Delicious, and I have taken to the taste of cilantro and it goes great with this carrot soup...use a little or a lot. For those who don't like cilantro I see there is a ginger-carrot version I'm going to try next.
5 more stars. It's good done with ginger and no cilantro. I've done various versions now,adding red lentils, quinoa, celery, it is so flexible for changing up. Some reviews have said its bland...you can customize it for your likes and dislikes, go ahead and amp up the flavour!

This is now a staple soup in my family.  I do a few things differently, partly because of what's on hand and partly because of preference.  I use coconut oil instead of Olive oil, Chili sauce with garlic that you can find in the Asian section of major super markets, and fresh grated ginger---YUM!!!  I only blend half of it to enjoy the texture of the carrots and potatoes.  WE LOVE THIS SOUP!!

This soup is excellent!  I pureed in a blender which gave it a smooth and creamy texture.  I added more cilantro and chili paste - I'm not sure I used the right kind of paste?  But it doesn't matter because it came out amazing.  I spiced it up a bit more with some cayenne because we like our foods hot!

Doubled the recipe and used three large potatoes and a few extra carrots.  Didn't have chile paste so I used 1 TBSP of red curry paste.  Wasn't spicy enough so added some cayenne pepper at the end and it was great.  Used my immersion blender and it tasted like liquid pot roast.  Didn't used all the broth it called for.  I liked it a bit thicker.  Would make again, but not all time.

I made this soup with a bit of pessimissum.   But it got really good reviews, and basically I had the ingredients, so why not?  I did change a few things (which I always do):  used a can of green enchilada sauce instead of the red, used Knorr's Veg Boullion for the broth, mashed 3 cloves of garlic and 1 bunch of cilantro in a pestal and sauted in a little olive oil at the start.  Used some hot sauce instead of the chili paste.  Used about 2/3 and left the balance as is.  Then added a 1/2 cup of pearl barley (wanted it thicker) and cooked for another 20+ minutes until done.  Served with sour cream and chopped cilantro.  Excellent!  And vegetarian and healthy - better yet!

I love this soup, especially with a dash of lime and red wine vinegar, with more cilantro added at the end and a dollop of fat free sour cream. One of my staples!

Great flavor with these variations:  Used chicken broth in place of veggie broth, Used crushed red chili pepper in place of chili paste, Added the juice of two limes and some grated fresh ginger, and Used 3 cloves of garlic instead of 1.  Bon appetit

I liked this but my roommate didn't. We served it to a dinner of 16 people and while some loved it, others left theirs almost untouched.  I think the look may have scared some away.  For the taste, maybe a little more cilantro would have helped.

I thought this was amazing. I made a huge meal last weekend, with this being one of the courses. A lot of people didnt eat it, some said they were too full or it was a little too spicy, But I give it five stars because I thought it was perfect and I will make it again (atleast for myself).

I'd never made carrot soup before but my husband and I were very pleased with how this turned out. I used chile powder, since that's what I had. I also used frozen hashbrowns to save time. The only other real change I made was to add about 3/4 can of condensed milk in the last five minutes (made it nice and rich). Then I put it all in the blender (solids first). Once dished into bowls I put in a little cilantro for garnish. Yummy! Next time I think I'll put some cayenne in for heat. I Baked breaded chicken (to which I added chile powder to tie it in) and steamed broccoli to go with it. It tasted really good after a bite of broccoli but just okay after a bite of chicken. Just an FYI. I think it'd be good with mexican food. Can't wait to enjoy more soup tomorrow!

I followed some other reviewers' advice by doubling the garlic, cilantro and chili paste (I used a red thai paste). And at the end I added 1/2 Tbsp of lime. It turned out delicious!

Thanks for the recipe.  I was in a hurry so pressure cooked the carrots and microwaved the potato before adding to the soup.  Also I just chopped the garlic using 3 cloves.  I only used 4 cups of vegetable broth..maybe my carrots were small and I only had a medium sized potato.  Additionally I added some fresh lime juice to the soup.  Cilantro flavor was wonderful in the dish.  I did not cream the soup just left the diced carrots and potato pieces etc.  Flavor was great.  It made a meal for two people.

I thought this was just great - the amount of heat was perfect.  This is a wonderful framework; I think you could change the proportions of vegetables and it would still be fine.  I added more carrots because I had more carrots.

My guests said it was great and my husband loved it and had to have a second bowl later.  My granddaughter said it was delicious and it was her favorite.  But she's 2 and eats just about everything.

Awesome soup for a cold day after work.  We had it as a starter for Mexican night. I couldn’t find Chili Paste so just dropped in a T of Sambal for the kick, and it worked fine.  Also didn’t have a single potato on hand, so used 300g of pre-peeled potatoes from a package. Great combination of flavors- the whole family loved it.  A definite keeper.

My niece is in the hospital and just started eating food again and I gave her a choice of 5 soups and to my surprise she picked this one.   So glad...it was so good and I love the kick. I had all the ingredients so I was able to stick right with the recipe.  I did add a little more cilantro (love it) than called for and right at the end I did add a dash of salt just to open up the flavor a bit.

Absolutely loved it! I'm trying to lose weight so I left out the potatoes, which honestly I wasn't so sure of, but it still tasted awesome! Can only imagine how it tastes with it ;) I also added waaaay more garlic & cilantro than the recipe called for and used chili powder. I tried a bowl with some grounded red pepper & it was awesome! I am definitely making more when this batch runs out. So delicious.

Loved this recipe!  I served for a lunch for 8  (cup each) -   used 5 carrots and a cup or so of white wine.  Instead of chile paste I used chile powder and some vinegar.  Then at the end right before serving I added juice of a half lemon.  Everyone loved it!

Couldn't find chili paste, but I used red pepper flakes to get some heat.  This soup was great.  The carrot's sweetness really comes out in this soup.  It is hard to believe there is no sugar added. Sweet with heat makes this a great soup that I loved dipping my dinner rolls into.

I didn't use chili paste instead when I put the carrots and sweet potato in with the oil I diced a tomato and had it all simmer in the oil with cayenne pepper, crushed red pepper, cilantro, and a jalapeño. The rest of the recipe I followed I am surprised by how low calorie it is for such a filling soup! I'm a vegetarian and I'm so happy to find another filling meal!

REALLY delicious. Like the others, I added a lime, and substituted chili powder and red pepper flakes for the chili paste. I also pureed in batches in my blender. Came out nice and smooth!

I love this soup.  I make it all the time, but I use 3 potatoes in order to make it a bit thicker once blended and I prefer chicken broth.  It's very simple, but delicious.

I made this because I received way too many carrots in my produce delivery this week. I actually used the pale yellow carrots and the mildness of them plus the spice and cilantro made for a delicious soup. I added lots of siracha to make it nice and spicy. Hoping it will chase away the remnants of my head cold!

Not bad!  Doubled and used bouillon instead of broth; also added more chile paste and cilantro as garnish.  Would use less water next time.

The only thing I will do differently when I make this again, is add the cilantro right before I puree.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe.

I've never heard of carrot soup, but I was making a Mexican meal for Cinco de Mayo, and this sounded interesting.  I didn't have any chile paste, so I used chile sauce and a little bit of chile powder (the results were a bit too spicy, so I'll just use the sauce next time).  I thought this soup was great, and my only complaint is, that I think the vegetables needed to cook a bit longer to soften more.  The flavors were awesome, and really light and everyone enjoyed it.

I'm not sure what I did wrong...but we ended up dumping this soup down the drain!
I used chili powder instead of paste..but followed another persons tip from a positive review.
This was a lot of work for a very bland result that we couldn't even eat :( 
Better luck to you!

I made this soup last night for a dinner party and was it ever a hit! Very flavorful and light! Perfect for preparing the palate at the beginning of a meal!
