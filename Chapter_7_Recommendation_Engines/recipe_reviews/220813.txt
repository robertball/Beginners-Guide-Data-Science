So yummy! To make these a little healthier, I subbed agave nectar for the corn syrup and brown rice cereal instead of regular rice cereal... Will be making these again!

Delicious but be sure to carefully read the ingredients on the crispy rice cereal.  "Malt" refers to barley malt and that means it is NOT gluten-free. Kellogs Rice Crispies are NOT gluten free.  Rice Chex are. Beware if you are very sensitive or celiac.

Well, I didn't have any corn syrup so I had to improvise and it turned out amazing! I will make this again. Instead of corn syrup I used 1/2 cup of honey and 1/2 cup of aunt jemima syrup (haha). I used cappuccino chips because I just wanted a different flavour. Otherwise I did everything the same and YUM!! I also pressed it into a pan lined with wax paper to make them come out nicer. I also found that in order to get 36 bars you really have to cut these small (less than an inch to get 12 across the pan - not what the picture would suggest).  Not really realistic for anyone to eat them that small but it doesn't really matter. But if you are making this for a group you might over estimate what you have that's all. Because I had used honey and syrup they came out a little soft but I think they are better that way anyway they don't even taste like a granola bar.

These are delicious!  Recently going gluten-free, we were missing our fiber bars.  I have made these several times and they always disappear quickly!  We like them best with cranberries added.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is versatile enough that you can add or subtract ingredients to please any picky eater!  I used chopped walnuts and cashews instead of the almonds.  I also used semi-sweet chocolate instead of milk chocolate chips for my son, who has a dairy allergy.  I added dried cranberries and some shredded coconut.  This recipe is perfect, the options are limitless!  My new favorite snack!

THis is exactly what I was looking for! I used almonds and pecans, added dried cranberries and blueberries and skipped the flax. This was so great and easy I will continue to make it! Thank you!

Easy to make and wholesome, too. Most commercial energy bars have way too much sugar. In contrast, these are tasty, but not rot-your-teeth sweet. My daughter loves them. To keep them crunchy, I individually wrapped them in plastic wrap and then stored them in an airtight container. For a not-so-wholesome change, I switched half the peanut butter with Nutella which made for a yummy option. I believe Nutella separates when over heated, so I suggest you heat the corn syrup and 3/8 cup peanut butter first. Take it off the heat before mixing in the Nutella. Both ways are very good.

These are REALLY good, not too sweet.  I use chopped peanuts instead of cashews just because it is what I always have on hand.  Great snack for GFCF kids and adults, and really quick and easy to prepare!

Gor to admit, I was really disappointed.  Was looking for something for school lunches, but with all of the peanut butter and almonds and cashew, this definitely isn't it.   :(

These are great and super-easy. I used almonds, raisins, and walnuts. I am going to try with fewer chocolate chips next time and keep playing with the ingredients. Really good base recipe - I'll make these again and again.

This is a great recipe that is quick and simple.  I substituted Karo LITE Light Syrup for a savings of 40 calories per 2 tbls.  I also added some spices - pumpkin pie spice, nutmeg, and ginger.  I cool them in the fridge and then individually package them in wax paper for a grab-and-go snack.

So easy! Soon good!! Use whatever substitutions you want...it's all good :) I used cherry flavored dried cranberries and used roasted sunflower seeds instead of almonds. Delicious!

Also used/added: light corn syrup, honey, Honey Bunches of Oats, cocoa powder, coconut flakes.   So good!  Toddler loved "helping" me make it.  :)

AmaZING!  Easy ingredients to shop for, a pleasure to make, crowd pleaser. I followed a few of the previous comments - using gluten free Rice Krispies, maple syrup and honey over corn syrup and it worked like a charm. Mine didn't look like the photos, but a-ok.

This is so easy and a great non-processed (healthier) treat for my 4 year old !  I was looking for a gluten free recipe for myself while nursing an infant with food allergies.  I used dairy free chocolate morsels and mixed in a little honey with a smaller amount of corn syrup.  So delicious!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good and versatile recipe. I did substitute honey for the corn syrup and it came out nicely. My chocolate chips melted after mixing them in, so I recommend you reserve a handful to sprinkle on top as you press the mixture into the baking dish, if just for looks. I also recommend lining the baking dish with parchment paper and setting it in the freezer for a few minutes for a very quick set and easy way to get them out for slicing. Two picky kids gave them 2 thumbs up!

These are very good. But they look much more chocolatey than the picture, and tasted more like a candy bar than a healthy snack. Will try to make them without the chocolate chips next time.

Loved it.  Used 1 cup cashews, crushed rice Chex cereal in lieu of Rice Krispies and omitted flax.  Will make again.

Love the idea of adding rice Krispy cereal, but I buy the gluten free version.  My son is celiac and cannot have the malt in it (barley).

I made these minus the chocolate chips because I don't like the sweetness in the morning (which is when I eat my bars.  Actually, I pack them in my luggage so I don't have to buy breakfast when I travel :-)).  I used pecans instead of cashews (less fattening and I like pecans more) but the bars were sagging so I put them in the oven at 300 degrees for about 20 minutes and they turned out great.  Not sure if this happened because I used almond butter instead of peanut butter or if it was because I omitted the chocolate.

Made these last night. Made a little extra of both the dry mix and wet mix. Turned out well. Added dried cranberries to mine, and mini M&Ms for the kids. I pressed mine into a larger cookie sheet (think they call it a jelly roll pan, actually - 12x17 maybe?). They turned out the perfect size. Mine have great flavor...a little on the sweet side, but yummy. The house was really warm though and they weren't hardening at all, so I put them in the freezer for a bit. It did colored the M&Ms on top, but everything still tastes fine. It is a good base recipe that I'll have fun playing with. I only gave 4 stars because it makes too many to eat all at once, and there is no storage recommendation included. I want to use them for kids' lunches. I looked up other recipes and recommendations. Similar recipes say you can store them at room temp for abt a week & a half in a sealed container or individually wrapped. Right now, mine are individually wrapped in Press'n'Seal. Half in a Baggie will stay out, they other half will go in the freezer. I don't see any reason why they wouldn't freeze well... But I guess I'll find out!
