Very yummy, made it for a tropical themed party.  I used Heavenly White Cake (from this site) for the cake portion.  I followed the recipe as written for the topping and frosting and they were very good.  Not too sweet.  The key lime topping started to run off my cupcakes after a while, so next time I may try to make that a little thicker.

I made these as Mini Cupcakes. (Not the normal sized ones as the recipe says) It sure was a lot of work to frost all the tiny cupcakes but they turned out great! Very cute!  Will make 'normal' sized ones next time.  And for Eastern I might even use different colors to tint the frosting.  Not very Key Lime like but pastels go great with the Easter theme.

This is an absolutely delicious little cupcake. The one change I made was that I made mini cupcakes instead of regular sized ones, baked for about 7 minutes. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It is time-consuming and I made a flat-out mess in my kitchen but these little gems are worth it. One note, I neglected to read the part about REMOVING the cupcake liners before I went out and bought them. I searched for cute little Easter ones and then realized that I'd have to remove them before frosting. :( But I do think you should remove them like the recipe states. I think it would be hard to neatly peel off the wrapper without getting the topping all over yourself if you frosted them with the liners on. And, I used ziploc bags for both the green topping and the white frosting. Just fill them up, snip off a small piece and pipe on. They taste best after they've been in the fridge for a bit so plan accordingly. I let mine hang out overnight in the fridge and this morning they are so good I can't stop popping them in my mouth! :( 5 stars, can't wait to bring them to the Easter celebration!

GREAT RECIPE! I altered the recipe a bit to make it healthier- I used nonfat vanilla yogurt instead of oil for the cake mix (it makes it moister). I used light cool whip instead of heavy whipping cream and I used half the sugar frosting....it was AMAZING! Will definitely making these cupcakes again :)

Super fun (and easy) to make!  I did use a bit more lime juice where called for, and probably more zest, too.  First day, they're a little intense, but they do mellow in the fridge.  I'd advise making them a day in advance, at least.  (These were a hit with the kids, as well!)

SO easy, so delicious. I followed exact recipe, EVERYONE loved them! Usually, a full cupcake is TOO much cake. I love the halves!
