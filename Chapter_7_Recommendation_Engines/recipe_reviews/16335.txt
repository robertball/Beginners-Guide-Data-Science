the recipe calls for white sugar, I interpreted this to mean regular granulated,--confectioner's sugar would make this a great recipe.

Merci Monsieur Boyer!

My french-canadian grandfather used to make a similar sauce to put on his bread pudding and his last name was Boyer too!

I figured it had to be a sign. I did add cornstarch and a bit of water to thicken it.  

It was delicious!

If you are having problems with the recipe being "gritty", then use powdered sugar.  That's the way I've always made it.  Start with a half cup and add until it's about the texture of peanut butter.  If it's "firm" that's okay because it will melt on the warm bread pudding.  I use pure vanilla extract instead of brandy and almond extract.

GREAT! Had made a spice cake and wanted something different instead of plain frosting.  I did use confectioner's sugar and had no problem with it being too thin.  In fact, I added a bit more brandy.  It was wonderful topped on the spice cake and the ex-husband put some on his cheesecake (and took the rest home and PO'd the new wife...evil giggle!)  Thanks for a great recipe!

white sugar, to me, means granulated sugar.  recipe was gritty & thick. Was it meant as "powdered sugar"? I was making it to top Bread Pudding.  Decided to melt it, then had to make adjustments, as it tasted like sweet melted butter.

Yes, definitely confectioners sugar! Plus way more brandy. My family recipe calls for adding brandy  to the beaten sugar and butter gradually until the mix can hold no more. The almond extract is not in the traditional old english recipe.

To the person that found the sauce 'gritty', you didn't beat the butter and sugar together long enough.

As some other reviewers mentioned, I also took the sugar to mean granulated.  I had to beat the tar out of it to get rid of most of the grit (I didn't have all day to keep beating this to smooth it out completely).  I think this recipe should call for powdered sugar but you may need more than the 1/2 cup called for in this recipe.  I also omitted the almond extract and added way more brandy - probably closer to 1/4 cup.

Smooth, creamy and absolutely perfect with warm bread pudding.  I have also tried the recipe using bourbon or rum with excellent results.

I used confectioner's sugar and whipped butter and I substituted light rum for the brandy since I had none.  It was a very nice addition to a raspberry bread and butter pudding.  Thanks for sharing, Marc!

I made this with rum to go with bread pudding. I used confectioner's sugar. It's good but definitely needs more rum (or whatever spirit you use) than called for.

I followed the advice of many of the reviewers and used confectioners sugar and the result was fantastic.  Took this to a dinner party along with bread pudding and everybody ate it up, even so far as scraping out the dregs in the serving bowl.

Made this hard sauce per recipe and it is perfect on mincemeat pie which tastes wonderful.  Wonâ€™t buy brandy hard sauce again. I added more brandy than called for and it tasted delicious.
