This is such a delicious pie! It's the sort of pie that you want to eat whole-- all by yourself! Very, very yummy! I found it was best the next day after being refrigerated overnight... gave the ingredients a chance to really come together.

Yummy!  I also found that using 1/2 sugar and 1/2 brown sugar gives it a richer flavour more like a caramel cream pie.

Very greasy.  I think it has too much butter. It has a good taste, but my pie crust became very soggy.

This is a delicious pie and it's so easy to make.  I added several sliced peaches (canned) to it which I arranged on top of the filling before baking.  The finished results were wonderful...it looked like a pie from the cover of a fancy food magazine.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

I thought this pie had too much butter in it. Though it tasted good, it was so fatty that I couldn't enjoy it, thinking about all the calories and fat I was ingesting. I'm no health nut either, and usually enjoy full-fat and calorie desserts.

I would try this recipe again, but cutting butter way back.

I used a 9" crust and still had too much filling.  After refrigerating it all was very greasy.  It left a coating in my mouth.  Tasted good though.

This was my first attempt at buttermilk pie, it is the other half's favorite and I was bringing it to the in-laws for Christmas. It was super easy and delicious!

I've made this pie for the first time a while back. But I didn't get a chance to review it. I made two at a time and it came out perfectly. I couldn't believe it. My first time making it what a good pie. My mom enjoyed it and I enjoyed it. Also, what I found would be helpful before eating this particular pie is to let it cool down and refrigerate before cutting it before plating it. Great Recipe. Will make again for Easter and Mothers Day????????????????????

This pie turned out just fantastic and was a most delicious celebration of three of my favorite things--butter, sugar &  buttermilk. Velvety smooth and set up perfectly. Out of habit, I sprinkled a little flour & nutmeg on the floor of the pie shell, and some nutmeg on the top of the custard before baking. So easy and so delicious!
