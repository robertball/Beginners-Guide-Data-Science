My hubby and I decided to try this because we thought it sounded really good and interesting.  While making it, we weren't so sure.  However, the "many layers of flavor" description is spot on!  It was very yummy, but very different and not for the faint of heart.  It is very spicy, but mostly from the chorizo so that can be adjusted or changed to a different, less spicy meat.  We made this dish exactly to the recipe with one exception...brown the chicken before cooking down the sofrito.

This was good in theory but didn't turn out as flavorful as expected. I would increase the amount of raspberry and cocoa next time. I also thought it was overcooked - 45 min. probably would have been plenty.

This was a really interesting dish. I made the sauce and tasted it. I was doubtful how it would taste with the chicken so as not to ruin the chicken with a sauce I maybe didnt like, I cooked it a little differently. I stuffed thee breast with chorizo and some of the sofrito.. no cheese or guacamole. I browned the breast and cooked them all the way through on the stove top. I remove the chicken and added the remainder of the sofrito and the sauce and cooked it til thickened. I topped the chicken with some queso fresco and made a small bowl of sauce to serve on the side. I really liked it this way. If I had the chicken cooked in the sauce, I think it would have been too saucy and too spicy for me. I will have a lot of the sauce leftover which I will freeze for next time

I took the advise of the other two reviews and increased the raspberry jam to 1/3 cup and a full tbsp of cocoa powder. I'm glad that i did as the sauce then had a more full bodied taste. Honestly, the cheese and guacamole just simmered away as it oozed out of the sides of the chicken even though I secured the ends as best as possible. I wouldn't bother to include these two ingredients. I'm a fairly experienced cook and not afraid of labor-intensive recipes, if they're worth it. I'm really on the fence with this one. If my husband requested it again, I would certainly make it but I don't see me wanting it again. I'm sorry if that hurts but I salute your efforts. Thank you!

I will admit this took me 2 days to make.  I made the sauces and pounded/stuffed the chicken one night and cooked the next night.  BUT this recipe is awesome and well worth the effort.  On the advice of other reviewers I increased the cocoa powder to 1 TBLS and the raspberry jam to 1/3 cup.  I would add that I recommend using seedless jam.  Also, on the advice of other reviewers I skipped the cheese and guacamole.  Hot guacamole doesn't sound good to me anyway.  I this is more of a Sunday dinner type of dish, since there are so many components, but you won't be disappointed.  In fact, I just made the sofrito again yesterday and froze it for future use.
