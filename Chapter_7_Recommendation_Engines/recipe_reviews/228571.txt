This was good! Similar to how I usually make my enchiladas, but different enough to be a nice change. I intended to make the recipe as written, and I pretty much did, just a few small changes: I cut back on the cream cheese and monterey jack in the filling to try to trim the fat and calorie numbers; I didn't add anywhere near 15 oz of tomato sauce - I bought an 8 oz can and didn't use the whole thing, it seemed like it was definitely liquidy enough with this small amount and tasted tomato-ey too; I accidentally used basil instead of parsely but it still tasted good; and I can never find canned enchilada sauce and I didn't feel like making a proper one, so I used tomatillo salsa mixed with some sour cream as sauce. Thanks for the recipe! I enjoyed :)

Made this tonight on a whim. It was yummy! I too reduced the cream cheese to about half and we would probably reduce the chili powder just a bit. I was amazed that the cleanup from the onion, cream cheese, cheese...mix was so easy. I kept the heat around 3 (pretty low). Other than those mods I made it as written. This would be a great dish to make for company. Serve with Spanish rice and refried beans - oh my the guests will be more than satisfied! Thanks!!

Since I was using green enchilada sauce I used a 10 oz. can of diced tomatoes/green chilies (generic Rotel)instead of tomato sauce, just thought it would be a better combo. We really enjoyed these. Took about 25 minutes until it reached a nice golden brown on the edges. Topped with taco fixins for a complete meal.

Good recipe... If I had added rice like Homechef-81 I think it would have made all the difference. I may try Spanish rice next time. I used a can of diced tomatoes with green chiles instead of green peppers and tomato sauce which added a nice heat. I would also omit the Monterrey Jack cheese in the filling due to the salt it adds to the dish and just use the full amount of cream cheese using more chicken. I used twice the amount of chicken the recipe called for, and it made the consistency of the filling just right....I will try this again with these minor adjustments and see how it goes.

I tried this recipe tonight. I always put my own twist on things and hubby asked that for once I just follow the recipe. Well, I did and it turned out wonderfully! He barely looked up from his plate and I was up, looking for seconds. I do feel that next time I might cut down a bit on the cream cheese. I also put the chicken in the crock pot in the morning. I just shredded it when I got home and followed the recipe from there. Delicious! I will definitely do this again!

Was looking great , till I added the tomato sauce----I think 8 oz would of been more than enough and only 1/2 the cream cheese...Too saucy!! I would try again with this adjustments!! Such a bummer

I made this tonight.  WOW!!!  I loved it!  I made a couple of changes after reading the previous reviews though. 

I used a little less of the cream cheese ( 6 ounces),  then I added one more cup of the shredded chicken that would make
the total amount of chicken used 3 cups.  I also used 8 ounces of diced tomatoes in their own  juice instead of the tomato sauce or soup.   To top before putting in the oven, I used the red enchilada sauce as it adds a deep rich flavor.  Add a  small dollop of sour cream and garnish with sliced black olives and Bon Appetit!

AMAZING!!!  As Guy Fieri would say,  "That's Money!!!"

Love it! Our new family favorite! I use the "10 minute enchilada sauce" recipe that you can also find on this site. My husband and 2 year old are huge fans!

The recipe was great! I don't like red enchilada sauce, so I used green. I changed the tomato sauce to 2 (10 oz) cans of diced tomatoes with chiles. I put in all the liquid, thinking I'd need it, but it was very soupy. I also put a little of the green enchilada sauce in so the filling would taste like the topping, but that just made it more soupy. So, next time, I think I would drain the tomatoes. It also made a ton of filling. I made 8 huge enchiladas and had some left over. I think next time, I will freeze half of it and make 8 regular enchiladas. Other than that, though, it was amazing!! Will be making again for sure!!

This dish is great. I have made a few changes I have used diced Tomatoes instead of the Tomatoesauce and red bell pepper since we are not a fan of the green ones. I have cut back on the cheese and I used half sour cream and half greek Yoghurt. My new favorite 
All in all my family and friends loved it 
Yummy

Ok so I should have read more reviews, do NOT add the full can of tomato sauce!! You will be spooning soup into the tortillas! (Yummy soup however :)) and I only needed 1 c. Enchilada sauce as they were already swimming :) but really besides cutting back on the sauces, DELISH!

This was great.  My family loved it, including a 3 year old and 5 year old.  I agree it was soupy after adding the tomato sauce and cream cheese, so I decided to make it into a full 13 X 9 baking dish enchilada casserole.  I put enchilada sauce on bottom of baking dish.  Then a layer of tortillas.   Next I put the chicken filling, half of it with a light  layer of cheese, then repeated.  Finished it with a last layer of tortillas, enchilada sauce and cheese.  Everything absorbed nicely and turned out great!  I will make again and was asked to make again by family!  Thank you to the poster of this recipe, very nice filling.  (have used sour cream if out of cream cheese and still comes out great!)

Excellent outcome with a couple alterations below!
-Sauteed the veggies and chicken and added Spicy tomato sauce from GOYA and it added a lot of flavor! I folded this with some jasmin rice, a little Cumin and other seasonings according to the recipe.
-In the cheese sauce, added Sour Cream- no cream cheese- and 1/4 cup of mexican cheese blend to get a nice cheese sauce.
We will be using this as our new easy and delicious enchilada recipe! Thank you for the recipe!

To cut down on time I used ground chicken and layered with ,rather than, rolled the tortillas. Resulting in a nice casserole dish.  Family loved it.

My husband loved it as is, but next time I make it I'll either cut back on the cream cheese/tomatoe sauce or add more filling. It could be spicier. Imo, some added toppings like in the picture (cilantro, tomatoes, black olives) really wouldn't hurt any.

These are fantastic! The only changes I made were to omit the green pepper and use a can of tomatoes X green chilies I had on hand. It gave it a little more spice and flavor. I loved this recipe but it is VERY rich so only a special occasion thing for me. Also, they heat up very well!

Good but not great. The toritillas were soggy. I followed others instructions and cut back on tomato sauce and cream cheese. Left me wanting for more flavor.

Made exactly according to recipe. I did not care for this recipe! My daughters' father is half Mexican and makes really good food for them at his house, so I thought I'd try something new while they're with me. They barely ate a few bites.  I ate half of mine, but felt so gross because these are so creamy. I usually only try recipes that have a couple of hundred good reviews but somehow this one slipped by me with only 30 reviews. Lesson learned.

Was very good, just made three alterations. I cut the cream cheese in half, substituted the can of tomato sauce for a can of cream of celery (add just a little water), and I cut the chili powder down to a 1/2 tsp. It came out great. I didn't think my son was going to stop eating it, he thought is was "delicious"....those were his words.

The prep time was more than 15 min, probably closer to 30 minutes. Cook time was longer too. At 20 minutes right now, still cooking. I used fire roasted tomatoes instead of tomato sauce. I didn't have have monterey cheese, so I used mozzarella. The sauce was very delicious. I'm sure it will be delicious when it's finally done.

I made this for breakfast today with my boyfriend.  He doesn't particularly care for enchiladas and has stated very clearly that the only ones he has ever liked are the cottage cheese & cheddar enchiladas that I make with my own homemade sauce.

I made these this morning following the recipe exactly and making my own enchilada sauce.  He told me he liked them better than my cheese ones.  So, this was a super score for us.  

They are saucy, but unlike regular chicken enchiladas...they meat doesn't taste dry.

So delicious!  Followed recipe as is except maybe type of cheese and it was so good. We prefer spicier, but this recipe was fine for Grandma who dislikes too spicy and the guys all added their own heat with diced jalapenos and salsa.

I made this  for dinner and we didn't really like them. I think using flour tortillas for enchiladas might be the problem. They ended up too soggy. I usually use corn tortillas and I fry them. I was excited about the filling so next time I will try it with corn tortillas.

Was a huge hit! Used chicken I had already cooked and seasoned in the slow cooker previously. Need a lesson in proper enchilada folding! Not too good in that department!

Authentic Mexican enchys are made with corn tortillas only. I didn't have any so I tried with flour tortillas because of the positive reviews. Tasted more like raw dough as I expected. I'll try using the filling in quesadillas or with corn tortillas. Never again will I go against my limited cooking knowledge and experience. A lot of posted recipes turn out a waste of time despite their positive reviews. Like they say, there's no accounting for taste.

I definitely will make it again.  We did spoon on Tostitos chunky salsa, for a little
kick.  And I used green chili/chile verde enchilada sauce...delicious!!!
My husband loved it, never realized there
was cream cheese in it, something he claims he doesn't like.

This was really good.  I have never made enchiladas before without dredging them in a sauce before wrapping the filling.   Just used tortillas straight out of the package and they turned out great! The flavors of the filling were excellent.  I didn't change a thing and the consistency of tortillas after cooking was perfect.  Will add to my favorites!

This is super yummy! I made it except I cooked my chicken separately so I could make a veggie version too. I made the sauce as it shows but also only used an 8 oz can of tomato sauce and added a little tomatillo salsa. When I rolled my enchiladas I made four with refried bean in the middle and put the sauce on top before rolling. On the other 4 I put chicken in the middle and sauce on top before rolling. Then I drizzled a small can of enchilada sauce on top of all the rolled enchiladas along with tomatillo sauce. So yummy!

These are great if you use about half the amount of cream cheese and 3/4 amount of the tomato sauce. I served them with a side of refried beans. Husband and I loved them! Perfect as leftovers too! :)

These enchiladas were so good!  Everyone loved them so much that there were no leftovers. The only thing that I changed the second time around was to put less onion and less green pepper as some people thought it was a bit too much, but other than that they were delicious. I will definitely be making these again and again.

Very yummy.  Made quite a lot so I froze for another lunch or two.  This recipe is obviously very fattening with the cream cheese so I will keep it as a treat.  I also made enchilada sauce from scratch following a recipe I googled.  It came out great especially knowing all those weird additives were not in the enchilada sauce.

Everyone loved it!  Unique tastes that my family really appreciated.  I made it with flour and corn tortillas.  Next time I will use only corn as they add to the flavor when flour doesn't.

The flavor profile was great! I used multigrain tortillas to add nutrition. Next time, I would add some corn and black beans instead of green pepper. I made it with leftover rotisserie chicken to save time. You can increase the amount of chicken, since there is plenty of sauce. My family enjoyed it!

These were good enough to make a second time before thinking about making adjustments. Between my wife, myself and our daughter they were all gone by the next day.  I'll definitely make them again within a month or so, and decide if any changes are needed then, but why fix something that's not broken?

This variation was a new one for me and at the last minute I made my own changes, instead of regular enchilada sauce I used green enchilada sauce, no tomato sauce because I don't care for the way it would make the overall sauce brownish. But I did chop some tomato for the topping for added flavor and color, I also cut the cream cheese in half and added a 1/2 cup of cream, 1/2 teas. garlic powder and beat these three together first.  We loved it and I will fix (my variation) again.

Super easy.  A little saucy when I followed the directions.  I might cook off the sauce abbot more and add some extra cheese to the top.

Nothing like the taste of corn, tortillas that is. Just the traditional way I was brought up, part of the enchilada taste, I guess, that makes it more authentic. Good quick way for a quick meal it's OK.

We loved these.  I did make a few changes so if you don't like reviews like that.....I baked 3 chicken breast halves and shredded them.  Sauteed sweet onion, red sweet bell pepper, fresh garlic in olive oil.  When tender I added 1 can of rotel with green chilis and some tomatillo salsa, cream cheese, jack cheese and chicken and simmered a bit.  Rolled and topped with more tomatillo salsa and jack cheese and baked.  Delish!

Adding one tablespoon of Cumin is a MUST.  I'm sure the Cumin was an accidental omission from this recipe.

I should have read the reviews before cooking. The filling came out way too soupy. Diced tomorrow's would definitely be the better option!

It turned out pretty good except that it came out really wet and sloppy. Way too much cream cheese, tomato sauce and enchilada sauce. I'd reduce those 3 ingredients by half. Also, it needed some rice!!!! I added rice and some corn!

Based on other reviews, I used diced tomatoes instead of tomato sauce and left the jack cheese out of the filling. Perfect level of spice. Everyone loved it.

This is an excellent recipe. I made this as written, with the exception of omitting green pepper, as it doesn't like me. It was really "hot" (spicy) to my taste, but my husband loved it. I also cooked the chicken on the grill and that added another dimension to the flavor. Instead of plain tomato sauce, I used canned diced tomatoes with green chili peppers(15 oz. can) and one 15 oz can of Red Enchilada sauce, and there was just enough liquid.  Next time, will try decreasing the Chili pepper to 1/2 tablespoon. This is definitely a keeper in my recipe box!

Had to use shredded cheddar because I forgot the Monterey cheese and had to use mild salsa instead of tomato sauce because I ran out of that too. Used onion and chive cc. Also passed on the bell pepper because I have a picky 4 year old. Besides that I followed the recipe and it was very well received by this family of six. My picky 10 year old daughter even asked for seconds.

This is superb!  I used red bell pepper since I had it on hand.  I used a very large onion and three chicken breasts, so I used two bell peppers.  Next time I will use more cream cheese and twice as much jack cheese.

There were some skeptical moments, but it turned out great and the hubby loved them! I would definitely recommend cooking the chicken in a separate pan while sautéing the onions and adding the other ingredients. Also, you don't need a whole onion. I love onion but half, at the most, is good.

I didn't have monterey jack cheese or cream cheese because this was made on a whim. I used sharp cheddar and Havarti cheese. Also, I used shrimp for my wife's enchiladas and it came out good as well. For the shrimp ones, I kept out oregano though. For both, I did not use as much tomato sauce as the recipe called for. Good recipe, and I will make again.

I changed the recipe a bit.  I used 4 to 5 cloves of garlic, medium green chile enchilada sauce, and added 2 handfulls of fresh spinach.  I also reduced the chili powder to 2 tsp.  My family enjoyed it very much.

Everyone in family liked it. But too much dairy for us so made  Some changes, first sprinkle chili powder on chicken when cooking gives chicken more flavor, added only about 3 TB cream cheese and used 1/2 cup of salsa instead of tomato sauce. Also used only about 1/3 cup cheese.
Served on tortillas with beans and rice (steamed rice with chicken bouillon cube).
.
