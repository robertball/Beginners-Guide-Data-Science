Excellent! Broth was flavorful and balanced. Good balance of veggies, rice and chicken. As other have mentioned, the liquid volume seemed low once done. I added extra chicken broth and water during the course of the cook time to compensate which worked out fine. This is a total repeat! Will probably double the broth amounts and keep the solids the same for the next go 'round.

We couldn't get enough of the soup. The only change I made was adding about 2 cups of broth, but this may not be necessary if you cover the pot so the liquid doesn't steam away. I would say this recipe serves 2-4 adults, if eating it as a meal.

This recipe was great. It was simple, and it doubled well. The only change I made was to replace the carrots with diced acorn squash. It's what I had in the kitchen, and it worked really well. Very yummy!

Loved this.  It's the kind of recipe that allows you to play with amounts as long as you have the basics.  I added 6-7 cups of broth and increased the beans to a can and also used a bag of frozen brown rice that I microwaved which then allowed me to eat the soup sooner.  I went heavier on the sage and added 2 bay leaves.  I wanted to take a picture to post but was too hungry.  So good on a winter's night.

This soup was so good!  All four my kids (and hubby!) asked for numerous servings and even asked if I could make it again tomorrow night! I used nine cups of broth, three chicken breasts, a whole can of corn and beans and forgot the bay leaf.  It also did not take as long as the recipe says because I cooked the chicken and veggies together from the beginning.

My daughter and I made this for the first time last night. We loved making it together as it was so simple and fun. It was definitely a hit and we will make it again. All of the flavors married so well together.  Our kitchen really smelled good, too. krismariev

I've made this soup twice. The first time, I made it exactly as written. While it was good, there was not enough broth for my taste and 1 teaspoon of pepper was way too much! The second time I made it, I used 2 quarts of chicken broth, omitted the pepper altogether, and substituted quinoa for the rice. What a great soup! I will definitely be making this again.

This soup was really good. A great way to use up some leftovers. I used leftover roasted chicken, grilled corn and leftover rice instead. I  sautéed the onions, carrots and celery first then I added in my chicken broth, roasted chicken and remaining ingredients. The sage gives it a nice flavor. The soup does need more broth than stated in the recipe and next time I make this I will bump the broth up to 7-8 cups.

I have made this twice and love it because I can use what I have on hand and make substitutes and/or additions of vegetables. Also it’s healthy.

I started with red onion & garlic as a base.  I added all the ingredientes one by one to take the flavor.  Also, instead of sage, I added cilantro leaves.  I agree that you may need to add more broth/water.  My husband loved this recipe.

Great recipe. As others did i added more broth/stock, put in the whole can of beans, and the whole package of frozen home canned corn just so i don't have leftovers. I would definitely make this again.

It tasted great. The only thing I would do different, next time (there will most certainly be a next time), will be to add more water and/or cover the pot. Living in Cajun country, I was worried about what seemed a minimal amount of seasoning, but it was right on.

I loved it!! Hubby loved it! I was looking for a  vege/bean chicken soup (not a chili and not too southwestern) and found the perfect one. Followed recipe exactly except I used a whole chicken and chicken stock I cooked in the slow cooker. I imagine you could use any veges you have on hand and it'd still be fantastic. Added diced avocado and OMG. This WILL be a regular in my house!!

This is the best recipe I have gotten from allrecipes.com to date.  It is very easy and inexpensive to make, very flavorful and filling yet low calorie - all good!  My only suggestion would be to use more chicken broth than the recipe calls for or it is just too thick. Otherwise, this one is a keeper!

I made this and used zucchini and peas instead of corn and black beans, due to food sensitivities.   It was very good,  I would cut back on the pepper next time.  I prepared the rice in a pampered chef microwave rice cooker then added it to the cooking vegetables and chicken.  Everyone liked it.

I made this exactly except I did not add beans. WAY too much pepper! Spent 15 minutes scooping it out. add only 1/4tsp then more to taste if necessary.

very yummy and hearty!  I used dried black beans since that is what I had, but otherwise stayed with the recipe exactly.  It's super easy but has a very sophisticated flavor and texture.  The longer you cook it the better, but I had to add broth often since I used the dried beans they kept soaking up all of the broth!  My husband loved it and asked me to PLEASE not lose the recipe! High fiber, low cal and what could be better?  Thanks grayartist!

This is the best soup. I add an add'l 3 cups of broth and kale.
