This is a fantastic recipe and now our go-to for leftover ham after holiday meals. Love it because when you’re about over all the ham, prepping it this way is truly something different. I’ve got little kiddos and they all devour this (11 months, 2.5 and 4). This is a forgiving recipe. I adjust it based on what I have and always omit the olives (not a fan). Any type of almond will work (currently used slivered because that’s what’s left post Christmas.) Definitely a keeper. This is the 7th or 8th time I’ve made this since stumbling across the recipe.
