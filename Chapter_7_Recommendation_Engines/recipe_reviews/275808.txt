I have been making a similar recipe for several years and keep them in the refrigerator,  try to not be without  them for very long.

The recipe I use is:
3 bananas
2 cup old fashioned oatmeal
2/3 cups slivered almonds
2/3 cup dark chocolate chips (I like Garadelhi squares)
1 TBL honey

I blend the bananas and honey in the blender or small food processor.  If the blender is large enough I add the other ingredients to it and gently mix.  Otherwise, I add to the other ingredients in a mixing bowl.

Other directions are the same as the one above.
