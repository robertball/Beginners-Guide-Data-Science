I followed the recipe exactly as written. It had good flavor and it was even better the next day. The only problem for me was the cooking time wasn't nearly long enough. My potatoes(which I diced) were still hard and even the peppers were a little crunchy. And I needed to add cornstarch to the broth to make it thick, as it was more soup-like. Next time I'd let this cook all day, 8-10 hours on low. Maybe add a few more spices to kick it up a bit. Not that it needs it, just sometimes we like our stew a little spicy.

Have made this stew twice and found it both tasty and a good change of pace if you like stews.  Two changes I would absolutely suggest:  cook much longer (5-6 hrs on high, 10-12 hrs on low) and add the milk in the last hour.  I researched adding milk to slow cookers and this prevents curdling/or separating.  Like others, I adapted ingredients to what was on hand, adding carrots and cannellini beans in place of the peppers.  As in all my crockpot stews, I used 3 Tbl quick-cooking (Minute brand) tapioca for thickening instead of cornstarch, though I did coat the meat with flour before browning.

This was a great stew!  I added celery and did not use the cornstarch.  I cooked it in the crock pot for 8 hours on low.  I think if you're only going to cook for 2 hours you should boil the potatoes for about 10 minutes before placing in the crock pot or they may not get soft enough.  I really liked the italian seasonings and the cream of mushroom soup gave it a nice texture.

I had a bunch of pork that I needed to use. This recipe was exactly what I was looking for. I have to admit that I used what I had. I used turkey stock (homemade, frozen from thanksgiving, and cream of chicken soup. They worked fine. I really liked the milk base. The texture turned out very hearty and it made great leftovers.

This was easy and really good.  I did not make it in the slow cooker, but on the stove.  However, other than adding extra garlic (because I ALWAYS add extra garlic) I followed the recipe.  REALLY GOOD!

This stew is perfect for a cold autumn day! I changed it a little due to lack of ingredients. I added carrots instead of peppers and corn, and I didn't have canned tomates so I used tomatoe paste and added a little water and it turned out fabulous! I made some homemade buns to go with it, and my family was so impressed! :) I will definetly make this again!

This is a great crock pot meal. I made it two or three times last winter, with a few recommended modifications.  I added a can of black beans, as well as carrots and fresh garlic, and cooked it most of the day in the crock pot--the flavor just improves. It's a good way to use cheaper cuts of meat and the beans give it a southwestern flair and improve the meal value.

This is a fine recipe.  Because it is a stew a crockpot is best to keep it from burning.  But the cook time is off by about 2.5 hours.  Set your crock to high to get the stew to bubble then lower it and cook for another 3.5 hours.

I wasn't too sure about this at first - even though I added way more garlic, pepper and Italian seasoning, I found it to be incredibly bland and boring. However, by the time I dished it up in the evening, it was much more flavorsome. Other than upping the seasoning, the only other change I made was to use creamed corn as that's what I had on hand. Not bad at all. Thanks, Mitzy!

I also added potatoes and put the whole thing in the crock pot after browning the pork.  came out tender, but soupy.  May put sour cream to make it creamier...but very good!

we tried this last night, and substituted the cream of mushroom soup with a canful of lactaid milk to make it nondairy for me. 
we threw in a can of black eyed peas as well to make the stew even heartier and it was delicious. 
very easy one-pot meal! i look forward to having some more for lunch in a little while.

I would give this 5 stars but I didn't follow it exactly! I was out of cream of mushroom soup so skipped that ingredient. I also added chopped carrots, celery and a little garlic. This is soooo good! I had to cook it longer than what the recipe calls for in the recipe, so the veggies would be done! This recipe is a keeper!

Okay so I was worried; I saw another negative rating posted today and was rushing home to see how mine turned out... I don't know what she was talking about b/c this is GREEEAAAATTTT! I did as the recipe called for except I played with different spices that we like; garlic, def. added more Italian, onion powder and a touch of chili powder. I threw it together last night in the crock and let it sit in the fridge overnight, simply turned on my crockpot and set on low for 8 hours. And off to work I went.   Thanks for an awesome recipe which will become a staple in our house :)

this is a perfect recipe for a busy day. just brown the meat, dump it in the crockpot with all the ingredients and leave it all day. 

i cooked mine on high for 3 hours then low for 4 hours. i added 2 tbsp of worcestershire sauce in the end to give it a little kick. served it with fresh bread and grilled asparagus. everybody loved it! will definitely make this again.

I took this GREAT recipe and created a Southwestern version: I had some leftover boiled red potatoes, so I chopped them up, added fresh corn cut off the cob, added sliced carrots, used chicken broth instead of beef; added 3 cloves minced garlic, 1 can of green chilis and instead of Italian sseasoning, seasoned with about 2 tsp. ground cumin and 1 Tblsp. chili powder, plus squeezed in juice of one Key lime (bottled juice would work if you can't grow them)and a few shakes of hot sauce to taste. Cooked on low in Crock Pot for almost 11 hours (just because we got home late), and then added a mixture of about 1/4 c. corn starch to 1/2 c. water to the crock pot and let it thicken to gravy consistency. We all loved this! If I weren't trying to lose weight, I would top with sour cream! I would also consider skipping potatoes and serving over rice for another version, but as hubby said, "This is a Make-Again!" Thanks for the inspiration, Mitzy!

I made this with the leftovers from the Czech Pork Roast recipe here.  It put me a bit ahead on seasoning, with caraway, salt, etc.  I used a second can of cream of mushroom rather than the milk, and four cloves garlic instead of powder.  So delicious.  The cornbread was a great complement.

I dislike recipes that call for seasonings 'to taste' because it makes it difficult for me to tell if the recipe is bad or I just didn't add enough seasonings!!  Anyway, I added cajun seasonings (about 1t) to the slow cooker, and more in individual bowls.  Served with corn muffins.

This stew turned out beautifully with a few minor adjustments.  I used only red bell peppers and at the end of cooking time I added a few tablespoons of cornstarch mixed with a little of the stew liquid.  It made the stew have a nicer consistency.

Definitely a keeper. The only change I would make is to reduce the amount of liquid in the recipe to make it a little less soupy. Flavor was different and great. I did not want a beef stew recipe using pork so this was great - totally different from your standard stew.

This was very easy and fast to make! I already had all of the ingredients and did not need to make a trip to the store.  The only thing is that is is more like a soup than it is a stew.  Plus you need to cook it longer than it says it does.  My potatoes were still hard when it was finished.

This was great.  Followed the recipe exactly except I used closer to 1lb of pork stew meat because 2lb seemed like a lot. Next time I might use slightly more than 1lb.

This turned out really good!!  We substituted Cream of celery instead of mushroom and added one chili pepper, carrots and celery.  Also, used white potatoes instead of red (only because we have a large amount of them) and everything tasted great together!  We did let it cook twice as long (about 5 hours) and the pork just fell apart as you ate it. The chili pepper gave it a nice kick at the end and was great served with sweet cornbread...yum!!!

We really liked this recipe.  This is what we were searching for!  We cooked in the slowcooker all night on low and re-heated for dinner.  The milk was added right before serving.  Did a basic rue and added it in.  Definately be tossing out the other pork stew recipes.

I made this exactly as written, and even though I have a very large crockpot, I could barely fit it all in. The recipe calls for '8 Red Potatoes' but it should probably read '6 medium red potatoes, cubed' because that's all that would fit. Also, like many other reviewers, I noticed the cooktime to be way off. After the first hour on high, the crockpot hadn't started bubbling at all. I cooked it for 5 1/2 hours on high and the potatoes were still hard -- I should have cut them smaller. Overall, it was soupy but it thickened up and tasted better the second day. I threw in some carrots and 3 boneless pork chops for meal #2 and it was better. I didn't like this dish enough to make it a second time.

Never have much luck finding recipes that I really love but this was one of them!  Excellent, flavorful and filling.  I had no beef broth so used chicken; I added celery and carrots.  Did NOT cook it in the crockpot as recipe stated.  Cooked it on the stove bringing it to a boil and them simmering until potatos were done.  My broth was perfect with a nice, thick "stew" texture.  Yum, Yum and my hubby agreed.

As posted before, the cook time was way off. Cooked for 4 hours on high and omitted the peppers because I didn't have any. Came out well, but was missing something. Next time I will add some chili powder to give it more depth of flavor

Excellent as it was written. I added lots of extra carrots and used Better than Beef Base and water instead of broth (I had none). I also added a can of rinsed black beans as others had suggested and eliminated the corn. The pork came out so incredibly tender. The whole family loved it and I have two picky kids aged 4 and 6.

My boyfriend and I absolutely loved this! I did add extra veggies like carrots and celery. It wasn't as thick as I would have liked it to be so I added an extra can of cream of mushroom and a packet of brown gravy about 30 min. Before it was done.  I cooked it on high for about 4 1\2 hours.  It was delicious and I well definitely be making it again.

A nice homey filling stew, I did brown the pork well to get a nice color on it as it added some depth to the pork and also cooked it on high for 5 hrs. I also added tapioca at the end to thicken and left out the milk as it was pretty creamy form the cream soup.

Very good recipe. The only thing I changes is to substitute frozen bell pepper strips for fresh, and added some fresh sliced mushrooms. Cooked it on the stove top to reduce cooking time. Will definitely make this again.

I absolutely loved this recipe. The sauce it made was delicious. I cooked it all day in the crockpot and the only change I made was I added carrots as well and used baby yellow potatoes as I did not have any red. This is a keeper for sure. Everyone I served loved it. I made cornbread to go with it and it was a nice compliment.

You can't really go wrong with these ingredients, but the timing is WAY off! If you cook this thing for one hour on high, and one hour on low - you will get a soup in which the pork is tough and the potato is uncooked.  In addition - the recipe calls for WAY  too much liquid. You would have to add a very unappetizing amount of cornstarch to thicken it. Best to leave out at least two cups of liquid. 

In addition, in my opinion, the "prep" time of 15 minutes is fantastical.
I would like to see a video in real time of someone chopping 2 peppers, dicing an onion, getting together a can of beef broth, a can of stewed tomatoes, a can of mushroom soup, a can of corn, a cup and 1/4 of milk, measuring out the ingredients for "italian seasoning", salting, peppering and dusting with corn starch the pork and then sauteing it until brown - in 15 minutes!

I will make this again. After reading reviews I made some changes.  For depth of flavor I seasoned pork with s&p, garlic powder and chili powder then coated with cornstarch and browned.  I removed meat and poured broth in pan and scrapped up the brown bits, stirred in a cornstarch paste to thicken broth,  added stewed tom. and soup, 1 1/2 T italian seasonings, 3 tsp of more garlic powder & chili powder, 1T worchestshire and a bay leaf.  Put the pork back in added bell pepper, carrots, onion, celery and a drained can of corn (to avoid soupy).  I didn't have potatoes. But, due to reviews, if I did, I would have parboiled or microwaved before adding.  We just moved so I don't have my crockpot readily available. I did all of this on my stovetop in a Dutch oven then covered it and placed in 325 oven for 1+ hour.  The kitchen smelled devine!

Very nice! As with most slow cooker recipes, this is a very adapting and forgiving dish. My note of caution is this: like another person, I used tomato sauce instead of diced tomatoes, and it turned the slurry pink. The final product was dark pink instead of that red in the photo. Tasted fine, but I can see that being a problem if you have picky eaters.

This is one delicious stew. I am a stew and chili man and make them all the time. First time I made this and will make it over and over again. I did leave in the crock pot longer than suggested and it came out just fine. Looking forward to leftovers tomorrow.

Most of the time I can manage to eat something I've cooked if I like all the basic ingredients...this is the one exception. I honestly could not believe how this tasted! There was nothing good about it - not the presentation, not the texture & most definitely not the taste. Very disappointing considering how much it makes. I will be a little more cautious when trying a new stew.

Great recipe, cooked all day in the crockpot, then pureed some of the broth and veggies to make it thicker. Plenty of potatoes so used those instead of adding more cornstarch. Will be making this again with a few changes. Add carrots and celery, use cream corn instead of cream soup.

This was an excellent stew. I did not use the cornstarch and played around with seasoning to make it a little spicy, but awesome. Great to come home to on a chilly day!

This recipe is delicious!  Easy to make too, and especially when you only have like, a half hour to make something for dinner.  I omitted the cornstarch, because I din't have it.  I didn't have canned tomatoes, so I added about 1/4 cup tomato sauce instead.  Delicious!

This recipe needed some more flavor.  I added lots more seasoning and salt and pepper and it still needed something.  It was better the next day.  It needed something to thicken the sauce. It was rather watery.  The cooking time needs to be longer.  I cooked it for 4 hours and the vegetables were still crunchy.

Wonderful soup.  We are a soup family, especially in the cold weather.  I will definately be making this again.  The only change I will be making is to try some carrots in it next time.  But excellent as it is.

I didn't think I was going to love this recipe but I was wrong, because it's delicious. I made it according to the directions and then decided I wanted more veggies, so I added 3 sliced carrots, and two stalks of celery sliced. I know the taste profile might be slightly different than the original but not a real big difference and if it weren't for the original, I would have never known that I like it! Cooking it in the crockpot makes it so simple. I will be using a little cornstarch to thicken it just a little, but it's great tasting just as it is!

I left it cook on low for about 10 hrs and the veggies were not  over cooked. Added a bay leaf, Maggi, carrots, celery and lots of course black pepper, also left out the corn.
I also use corn starch and water when reheating left overs if it is a little to thin. This had excellent flavor especially after one or two day's. Good enough to eat cold if you can't wait !

I have to admit that as I was making this I decided to change it up. I omitted the milk, Italian seasoning and potatoes but added celery and Cajun seasoning. What came out was a very good base for a gumbo. I served it on rice and next time ,will add some sausage and shrimp to complete the transition

Pretty good . I think there are some obvious flaws, as others pointed out - the time is ridiculous (should be more like 3-4 on high or 8-10 on low), it would make obvious sense to cut up your potatoes...but I think it's a good recipe that can easily be played with.

This is an awesome recipe. When I made it I did not have red potatoes so i used regular potatoes and I chopped them up and added the last hour of the cooking. Also I did not add milk and it turned out wonderful my family loved it!

Really loved this recipe but made some minor additions. I omitted the green peppers and fried up 3 pieces of bacon. Used the fat to fry my onions. I was worried my potatoes would be hard so I took another readers advice and nuked my potatoes (only used 4 ) with fork marks for 5 minutes.  I added a small can of green chili sauce, paprika, some tomato paste and red chili powder to make it just a bit spicier.  With all these changes I really liked how this turned out. I also want to add slow cooked high 3 hours and 1 hour low and it was ready.

With a few tweaks, this stew is great. I used golden mushroom soup instead of cream of mushroom, added tomato paste, a roux to thicken it a little more and cooked for 5 hours. Excellent served over wide egg noodles.

I read some reviews and made some modifications accordingly. I thought 2 hours for slow cooking potatoes was not enough for sure! So I cooked my veggies and the sauce for 4 hours on high, then added the meat(after searing as directed) and cooked for 2 more hours on high. For ingredient modifications: I reduced the broth to one cup(because comments said there was to much liquid), used herbs I dried from my garden and added a couple small hot cayenne peppers. I didn't add the milk because it looked liquid enough, so I added roughly 3-4 tbsp of butter instead for a creamy flavor. Butter is a restaurant trick I learned from years of working in them. Most soups in a restaurant will have butter. 
I will be making this again!

I cooked 4hrs on high. Turned out just right. Except mine wasn't the same dark brown color.... It was good. It all went between 5 people. Nothing spectacular. Could've added black beans perhaps...celery. Other than the time, I did it exactly as it said. I even added some cornstarch at the end like another review said to thicken the sauce...just didn't look like the picture...dunno why. Was an okay meal and certainly something different cause I normally don't do stews, more of a roast type person.

I really liked this, but do agree that cooking time was way off.  I used pork tenderloin, added a little less broth and a can of black beans and four diced potatoes (versus eight) and cooked for an hour on high and then on low for about seven hours.  Over rice, it was great.  I'm not a huge fan of sodium, so flavor for me was perfect.  Will definitely make again.

As others have noted, this gets better with time, where the flavors can meld together.  The first time I made it, I didn't think it was great, but the next day.....yummy!! Even making a few hours before dinner and letting it sit really makes the flavor come through.  As far as using the slow cooker for this recipe - it only has a two hour cook time, so I just make it on top of the stove in a Dutch oven, slowly simmering it on low for about two hours.  I find that potatoes are slow to get done in the slow cooker anyway, and I usually cook them for a few minutes before adding them to any slow cooker recipe.  We love this recipe!  I served it with freshly baked zucchini yeast rolls last night - so good.

This tasted delicious!!  I didn't have pork stew meat so I just got ribs and cut the meat off into chunks.  The only thing I would say is that it took A LOT longer than 2 hours on high in the slow cooker to cook the potatoes (and they were diced)...   I will make it again but either cook it for 5 hours on high or 8-10 on low like most crock stew recipes say.

(USE at least a 5 QT. crock pot)

I replaced the corn with black beans as someone had done. I included some carrots as well. I cooked on the slow cooker for 6 hours on high. I added a few splashes of Worcestershire sauce too! It turned out great and had a nice taste to it. We actually liked it better than regular beef stew. Had a nice flavor to it. Would make this again. Perfect for a rainy day.

When tasting during the cooking process it tasted *wonderful*. However, I must have overcooked it. When I tasted it the next morning (after cooking from 6pm to 11pm the evening before, disconnecting the crock pot, then tasting the next morning)it tasted tart -- like I had added vinegar to it. I finally got the tartness to calm down by adding another can of mushroom soup, parsley, more garlic (which cures *everything* :D) cayenne pepper, and a little sugar. Next time I make this dish, I will cook just until the potatoes are done.

We all really enjoyed this recipe! I cooked the whole thing all day in the slow cooker, first browning the meat in a skillet as directed. (Had no problems adding the milk in the morning, it never curdled.) Our only addition was adding some sour cream to our bowls before eating, made the gravy even creamier. Will make this alot!

This is a great recipe. I used a 2lb pork tenderloin cut into bite sized pieces and cooked several hours in the crock pot. I didn't use milk...wasn't sure how that would be all day in the crock pot. This is a really good change from your regular beef stew. My husband loved it! I will definitely make this again.

Fabulous! I loved this stew. It was even better the next day. Here are my changes: I only added 1/2 cup peppers. I added chopped carrots, potatoes, and celery. Wonderful way to use pork! Very, very tasty. Wonderful comfort food. I can't say enough about this delicious meal, and the best part is it's made in a crock pot!!!

I used leftover pork roast, potatoes and carrots I had cooked in the oven a few days earlier, so skipped the browning stage. Added all the other ingredients, but used evaporated milk in place of regular milk, as its consistency usually keeps you from needing to add additional thickener. This was really good, and as I did it on the stove-top, I just threw it all together and heated to serve; very quick.

I thought this was excellent!  I used a few more potatoes, added carrots, low-fat soup and cooked it in the crock-pot for 8 hours on low based on some of the other reviews.  I added the milk an hour before it was done.  It turned out great!  The meat was soooo tender!

This stew was a hit! Never heard of, or tried a pork based stew but sure glad I did. I did as others suggested and added carrotts and garlic also, in place of potatoes I used rutabegas (they go great with pork and are healthier) and added some green beans, also used both cream of mushroom soup and golden. I also had to thicken the broth a bit as mine was runny.  And, as others stated it has to cook for much longer then stated (I cooked mine all day in the slow cooker).  VERY GOOD!

This turned out well...I did add a bit more spice with some fresh jalapeno peppers(2) diced and then a package of baby carrots.  I did cook all day on low so the potatoes and carrots would cook.  My other half loved it.

Very tasty but remember to DICE the potatoes and definitely cook longer - at least 3 hours.  I ended up taking it out of the slow cooker and into a dutch oven for the last hour because I had company coming over and the potatoes were solid after an hour on high!  But it still turned out very tasty.

The Italian seasoning really stood out. Thought I had used the wrong measurement. Added a little more garlic powder to counter. Cooked about 6 hours in crock pot on low setting.

I did brown the pork before putting it in the slow cooker.  I also added the vegetables to the fry pan briefly to take advantage of the flavors there from the pork.  I had a cup of alfredo sauce in the fridge so used it instead of the mushroom soup.  Otherwise, I made it according to the recipe and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was even better the second time around which is usually the case with stews, etc.

At the current time, this has been on high for 5 hours and no sign of getting thicker.  I'm a very inexperienced cook but even I questioned the amount of liquid used in this recipe.  I wish I hadn't used the milk.  Bland, despite using more pepper/garlic powder with my meat, I've had to add a ton of salt to make it somewhat palatable.  Got rid of some of the liquid and seasoned more.  I might make this again, but with the changes mentioned above.  One user suggested using cornstarch to thicken, will have to give that a go.  I'm glad I read the reviews first so I didn't start this at 3 expecting it to be done for 530.
*EDIT* So 6 hours in and we were hungry, so I spooned out a cup of liquid, added the extra salt/pepper needed and thickened with cornstarch.  More stew like instead of soup now.

I've made it twice and it was Ok but it needed some additions to make it amazing.  The second time I made it I added a little extra italian seasoning, a small can of chipotle peppers,  fresh cilantro (coriander), fresh parsley, some carrots, and celery.  I also reduced the amount of potatoes.  15 min pressure cooking followed by 6 hrs slow cooking.  It was a 5 star dish after the tweaks!

Horrible instructions. How should you prepare the potatoes? How big are they? The timing is WAY OFF. Potatoes were still raw, even though I fixed them. The meat was raw even though I followed their instructions. I'm a very experienced cook, this was bad.

Very easy to make (I used a pressure cooker rather than a slow cooker).  It didn't have much punch, I.e., it was quite bland.  My red potatoes were too large and I should have cut them at least in half.  I believe that it would have been better if I added some garlic to it rather than just depending on garlic powder on the pork.  Perhaps the pork wash't fatty enough.  I will try it again with carrots and maybe leave out the corn.  I don't believe that using a pressure cooker rather than a slow cooker made a difference.  In any event, I made enough for a few meals and I'll see how it does the next day.

I didnt have stewed tomatoes, so I used a large  can of whole peeled plum tomatoes and mashed them with a potato masher.    I also cooked it all day in the crockpot.  Its a keeper.  Will definitely be making this often.

I changed things to suit what I had in my kitchen....so instead of beef broth, I used Chicken Broth,  instead of Mushroom Soup....I used Cream of Chicken soup....I did the pork the way the recipe said to...threw it in the crock pot after browning....added fresh cut up Butternut Squash, two peeled and cut up russet potato's, carrots, diced tomato's with celery and onion, onion, red and gold small chopped up peppers, a handful of cilantro, lots of Italian seasoning, no corn....cooked it on high for four and a half hours.....made homemade parmesan garlic bread to dip in it.

I had almost nothing of the ingredients listed, but I was looking to make a stew with some leftover Marinated Pork Tenderloin from this site. I used 1 large russet potato, carrots, a scallion and some celery. I microwaved this for about 8 minutes to get it started as my meat was already fully cooked. For the sauce, I used a can of broth, a can of cream of chicken soup, milk and rotel tomatoes mixed with the cornstarch. I did not add the italian seasoning as the meat was already well seasoned. This turned out tasty and spicy! I can't wait to try the actual recipe. Thanks for great inspiration!

I followed the recipe ingredients, but I altered the cook time to 8 hours on low as I use my crock pot when I am working all day.  It came out great and I've made it a few times already.  The family likes it too.

This has been a family favorite since I discovered it on All Recipes a few years ago.  I make it once a month and often serve it to guests.  We eat the stew with cornbread on the side.  Yum!  I usually add some carrots.  Also, I peel and cube a couple of potatoes instead of the 8 red potatoes.  My slow cooker is small, and it barely fits this stew.  Instead, I simmer it covered on the stove for 45 minutes.  Don't forget to stir occasionally if you cook it on the stove.

This stew was really tasty, but next time I will use a little less italian seasoning, it was a little much. The only thing that I did differently was add a little crushed red pepper for a little zing! Also I didn't have any red peppers and I never use onion (only onion powder) which was fine. Thanks for the recipe.

I usually have bad luck with pork, it comes out tough for me. This recipe is really tender though, and has a nice creamy gravy.

My husband, (who never follows recipes) followed this to a "T." I have to say the recipe sounded really strange, and after tasting this it is probably the strangest soup I have ever had.  The pork really threw me for a loop.  Maybe I have missed out on the experience of a pork stew, but now I am glad I know I haven't been missing out on anything.  If you like pork in your stew than I would give it a try.  Thanks for sharing!
