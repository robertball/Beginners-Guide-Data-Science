I only gave my own recipe four stars because you really should add the milk or sour cream suggested in my description. (Add 1 or 2 Tablespoons whole milk and 2 or 3 Tablespoons sour cream (to taste.) *Leave out the Nutmeg, Parsnip, Rutabaga, and Turnip if you want a more 'kid-friendly' version, as they all tend to be somewhat bitter to the younger palette.
 Treat these just like mashed potatoes: Butter and salt or rich gravy. I have even made potato latkes with the left-overs with great success!

Really liked the flavor, but had trouble with the rutabaga. I would either omit it or put it in to cook before the other veggies. I cut all the veggies in similar size and tested them for doneness, but I guess I didn't poke a rutabaga. They were unmashable. The beets were a little on the firm side but it wasnt as much or an issue as with the rutabaga... which was woody. This would be a pretty addition to a holiday table

I made these for my grandchildren and they loved them. I subbed carrots for the rutabaga.  They thought they were fun and said they looked like dinner on the movie HOOK.  Next time they suggested stirring in some mixed vegetables for more color.

What I found helpful was to start cooking the hardest veggies first and then keep adding the rest of them in order of hardness - rutabaga & turnip, then red potato and a few minutes later the other potatoes.  I cooked the beets separately.  Very good taste with this mixture of veggies.
