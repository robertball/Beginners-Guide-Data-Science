This recipe produced very tall flakey, moist buiscuits, but they tasted a lot like baking powder, so next time I think I'll reduce that ingredient since it's already in the buscuit mix. They look beautiful though.

wow these are great! 2/3 cups milk i think was a bit too much. i had to add a little more biscuit mix. i also used a heaping tsp of baking powder. they came out so big and soft! i don't usually use a recipe that calls for biscuit mix, but i'm glad i did! i'll have to make and keep the biscuit mix recipe from this site.

These were really good, and so easy!  I manage to screw up even the most simple and highly-rated biscuit recipe so I'm happy to have found a foolproof one!  The only thing is (and this is most likely somehow my fault) they are a little bit dense, not as light and fluffy as I had hoped.  But I will be making these again and again!

These turned out very tender and very moist inside. I couldn't even tell the vinegar was there. I used a homemade biscuit mix for this. Very good biscuit and I will make this recipe again.

I felt so-so on this recipe - 3 stars because I feel like part of it was my fault.  We didn't have any malt vinegar, so I used apple cider vinegar, which was probably a  mistake as the biscuits were rather vinegarry.  This would have been ok, but we could also taste the baking soda - not a good flavor :P  The didn't seem that much different than the recipe on the box, so I think that I'll stick to that one.  Sorry!

Pretty good for an quick biscuit. I didnâ€™t add the baking powder, as others said the mix already has leavening agents. I was also pretty conservative on salt for the same reason. Added the vinegar to the milk and let it sit for a few minutes before mixing. The biscuits are pretty good, but for 12 biscuits, they are pretty small. Basically just making box biscuits with added vinegar in the milk to emulate buttermilk. I cooked at 450 for 8 minutes and they were cooked just right.

I used 1/2 tsp baking soda rather than the baking powder and used my soured milk instead of the milk/vinegar. I always have a quart milk bottle of soured milk which is actually a mixture of milk and vinegar in my refrigerator  to use in biscuits,flapjacks, and banana bread. This is a good recipe although I am not a fan of premixes I do keep a couple of sacks for emergencies.  A good quick fix for surprise breakfast guests.

Very good.  Followed the recipe exactly, except that I forgot the pinch of salt. It didn't need it anyway.  I didn't find the dough too wet but having read the comment, I floured my board really well and it was fine.  Next time, I'll do as another did and increase the extra baking powder.  I certainly didn't notice ANY vinegar taste - it's only a 1/2 tbsp after all.  Though I don't know why it's in the recipe - I will try it without to compare.  One of the reviewers commented negatively on the Baking Soda.  There isn't any, so is it fair to penalize the recipe?    Good flavour  and texture in these biscuits, which I made with my own biscuit mix.

I use this recipe when wanting a quick drop biscuit. I use basic biscuit mix from this site to make these.
