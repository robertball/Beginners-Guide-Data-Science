Oh man is this one ever good.  So simple!!!!  I always buy my tofu in water bins at an Asian market, so the tofu tastes smooth and creamy.  I ate this whole recipe by myself for lunch.  I will make again and again, and adding extra veggies is super easy.  UPDATE: I made a big batch of this for my lunch.  The next day the sauce made the tofu taste a little strong and bitter.  It was still good, but just too strong.  I would recomend eating it right away or mixing the salad together and throwing the sauce on when you eat it.

Nice taste, although rather saucy.  I didn't have the cilantro, so I used parsley flakes.  I also baked the tofu pieces for 10 min ea on opposite sides of the tofu.  This makes it less squishy and more the consistency of hard-fried eggs.  (I originally didn't like tofu due to the consistency.)

The sauce was absolutely delicious - I mixed it with greens so it was a nice salad and it was a good amount of sauce for that

delicious! i used green onion instead of red to my taste, and threw in some rough grated carrot. thought bean sprouts would've been good too, am planning on trying that next time. i did not find it to be even a bit too saucy; it all absorbed into the tofu -- which i recommend freezing, i never have to press it afterwards and it has the best texture, even uncooked!

I just made this for a potluck and everyone was asking for the recipe.  I did brown the tofu in a little oil to firm it up.  I also minced jalapeno and added it.  Next time I may try some other veggies since, as other reviewers said, there's extra sauce.

I couldn't imagine raw, albeit pressed, tofu cubes, so I stir-fried them in a small amount of sesame oil.  I also substituted a can of drained mandarin organ segments for the tomatoes.  I added a bag of mixed greens and tossed it all together.  Yum!

I LOVED this recipe and so did my "meat and potato" husband. Basically used the recipe as a base and added mixed veggies such as peppers, red, yellow or/green, broccoli, shredded carrots, snap peas, fresh sliced basil, and put tomato at the end of stir so it doesn't get mushy.  In addition to the spices in the recipe, I used lemon pepper, little bit of chili powder or curry powder, white wine (to replace the mirin). I put this with rice and was a hit! I loved this so much that this is my first recipe post I am submitting!! This is was definitely added to my recipe box!

Excellent salad dressing. I also add some greens (spring mix works great) and leave out the red onion.

I enjoyed it very much. Unfortunately, my husband voted it "not a repeat." He discovered that he's not crazy about tofu that is not crispy on the outside. We both really liked the dressing though.

My husband raved about this salad and I have to agree!  It is very tasty and I have several ideas of things we could add to the salad for some variety.  This will be a recipe that will be made often.

We use just shoyu and sesame oil for the dressing.  I leave out the onion and cilantro, and add in some cucumber.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds, and, simple and delicious dinner that my kids love!

Loved it, with the decrease in the amount of sauce as others mentioned (used the same amount of the aromatics though). I used shallots, since I didn't have red onion. Used fresh tofu from a local tofu shop, which is amazing. Thanks!

Simple and delicious!  I followed the recipe without changing a thing.  No need to brown the tofu, in fact, I suspect you may lose a little of the light, freshness of the recipe by doing that.

Thanks for your recipe!
