This is a very good recipe!  I  had all I could do to keep my spoon out of it while it was cooking.  I thought the texture was very smooth on the tongue.  M”Lady gave it a definite large 5 stars, and I concur wholeheartedly.  I’m thinking of adding some oregano and garlic, and trying it as a spaghetti sauce.  It’s definitely a recipe to keep.

Thank you for posting this, Bud. My father in law actually made this for me when my husband and I started dating (and he made it for my husband growing up) and I didn't ask him how he made it before he passed. My husband asks about this quite often but I didn't know how to make it. This is EXACTLY how he made it, only he added a little "green" spice I didn't catch. I did add a half tsp. each of basil and oregano and that was it exactly. I only had a small taste but my husband and kids ate almost all of it over parmesan noodles. You made our day. And sometimes, it's really the simplest things that get you every time. Thank you.

I made half the recipe and put it over almost stale Italian bread.  The only thing I did was add a bit of basil.  Great red gravy or sauce or whatever you want to call it.  Will make this again.  Thanks for sharing.

This is terrific! I made it tonight along with meatloaf, rice, and biscuits and it was wonderful with all of them. I asked my hubby how he would rate it and he said 10 stars (: Thank you so much for sharing this recipe with us Bud, I will definitely be making this again and again!!

Absolutely delicious! My husband kept talking about this "tomato gravy" (which I had never heard of) that he had ate once. So i found this recipe and he said it tasted almost exactly how he remembered it! Thanks for this!

There's something really timeless about tomato gravy which is not the same thing as marinara sauce. The flavors meld together with the long simmer and it's wonderful. I personally like to use the diced fire roasted tomatoes in this sauce. Wonderful and simple. Thanks Bud!

This is awesome stuff. My children (who are not picky eaters) loved it and so did I. We added mushrooms for fun since I was out of onions. I also used fresh tomatoes for the diced tomatoes and serve it over tinkyada rotini noodles.

Great recipe! Easy to make and served over meatloaf. For health reasons,  left out the bacon, and it was still great. A healthy alternative to ketchup, and goes well over potatoes too! Will definitely make again.

I halved it & edited.  Bottom line:  For me, I'd like a fresh slice of tomato on a biscuit with/without bacon & onion rather than this; buttttt, until now, I've never heard of or made tomato gravy so maybe it's one of those things ya have to grow up on?   I'm glad I tried it though!  Thanks for sharing it.

We have tried for 8 years, since my mother-in law died, to make her meatloaf red gravy. This is the closest we have ever come! Thank you Bud for sharing! They only thing we did different was add the meatloaf juice.

I love the recipe, the only thing was I took out the bacon to use in my salad. It was simple and easy to make.

Yum! Tried this over pasta (halved the recipe and used less onion) and it was great! Thanks!
