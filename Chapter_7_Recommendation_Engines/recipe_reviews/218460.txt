Made this to bring to a friend's house for dinner. Baked them into small bundt cakes & served with powdered sugar on top & fresh raspberries on the side. HUGE hit! Tasted like brownies! Seems like it's going to be a heavy, rich cake, but it is light & delicious!

If I could give these a google stars, I definitely would......... I made these for my soccer team for tomorrow (I made them today, Friday) and they came out looking BEAUTIFULLY!!!!!!!!!! I baked them just enough so the center was fudgey so it was kind of a surprise in the middle. I added chocolate chips insted of the chocolate squares but they were still unsweetened. My only probably was that there was a lot, and  I mean a LOT of batter. I doubled the recipe as I was making 12 mini cakes instead of 6 but I should've just stuck with the original 6 and added a tiny bit more of everything instead of doubling it completely. I put cream cheese frosting on them and iced them to look like soccer balls and wrote some letter on the too and they looked phenomenal!!!!!!!! I used the extra batter in a yellow cake I was also making for my soccer team and everything worked out great. Thanks for the recipe, Jocelyn, I am definitely making these again!!!!

So good. SO GOOD. More intensely chocolate than any chocolate cake I've ever made, and remarkably fluffy. The chopped pieces of chocolate mixed into the batter make these little molten pools when the cakes are eaten warm. They're good after cool, but will blow your mind when hot out of the oven. Two comments - no way this quantity of batter fits into a regular 6 muffin tin - probably intended for the extra big muffin tin? Otherwise makes 8-9. Also, greasing the tins with butter was not sufficient to keep the cakes from sticking and coming apart a little. I'll probably grease AND flour next time. And there will most definitely be a next time.

Made these for a Christmas Eve party at my in-laws house. They weren't quite what I was expecting, I thought they would be more of a cupcake type snack, but they were delicious and everyone at the party loved them. All in all a fantastic recipe that I will definitely make again. Made a chocolate frosting to go on top, not too much, just enough to cover.

This was an easy recipe to follow, you can also substitute with chocolate bars that have nuts (I only had dark chocolate with almonds) They turned out great the first time I tried it! Just double it and make a huge batch for a party! Tastes great with vanilla bean ice cream!

I made these as my final foods class project. They came out perfectly! I was glad that they tasted dark and rich as opposed to super fluffy and light like a cupcake. As another review said, there was a lot of extra batter. I had my servings set for twelve, and I got a good 18 little cakes out it (people didn't mind the extras!)

I will definitely be making these again!

Pretty easy and ridiculously good. Making these for my daughter's first birthday party, so I had to try out the recipe first! I might "try" it a few more times before the party, just to have an excuse to eat more of them. I did put vanilla frosting on because of how I am decorating the cupcakes for her party.

These were so rich and so good.  I assumed they would be similar to a Ghirardelli brownie in cupcake form, but somehow they were richer and denser (in a good way)!  I did eat one right after baking and I can honestly say that I liked them better when they were completely cooled and solidified the next day.  I put a thin layer of dark chocolate buttercream on them and this only enhanced the experience.  The one change I would make is to leave the cinnamon out completely.  I even halved it when I made mine and I still did not like the spice in combination with the chocolate. Also, for the non-melted bittersweet chocolate chunks I just used a half cup of semi-sweet chocolate chips I had on hand. They worked fine, not need to go out and buy 2 expensive chocolate bars. Just one good bittersweet chocolate bar for the melted portion of the recipe will do.

I made these for my husband's birthday- they were easy and so so good. I used cupcake liners sprayed with nonstick spray and filled the cups almost full; they turned out beautifully rounded, dense and fudge-like as described by the author. Just what he'd hoped for!

The cinnamon was a bit overwhelming in this recipe. I think it would have been a better compliment to the rich chocolate in smaller amounts, maybe 1/4 tsp.  The cakes are rich and dense though. Will make again.

We made this recipe the other day, and I was slightly disappointed. About half of the batch was cooked perfectly and the other half was burnt. For the perfectly cooked ones, they were delicious and extremely chocolatey. They tasted great with homemade whipped cream on top as well. Would make it again, just be sure to keep a close eye on them.

I confess, I don't know how to separate an egg. So I just used three... Everything else according to the recipe. It's perfect! And surprisingly easy to make, while looking and tasting super classy.

Unbelievably easy and decadent! I didn't have unsweetened chocolate squares so I subbed with 1.5 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips. I used Lindt Excellence chocolate bars for the other chocolate. I filled 6 heart-shaped cupcake molds and had enough batter left over to fill a ramekin. These are just to die for. Thank you!!

Hubby made & gave a 5, I thought a 4 star, but mostly because it seemed like a lot of work. We will make a couple of changes because of our new oven. We'll bake at 350 & for less time. There was nothing "gooey" as the submitted person suggested so that is why we need to make the changes. As far as I'm concerned this is a dessert you need the raspberries on top for sure to give a contrast to the strong chocolate flavor & maybe a little whip cream.  Make sure you use unsalted butter & no marg. Hubs debated but did use the unsalted butter.  We make for "special" occasions so we don't get burned out on it.

I made them in the mini muffin tin. Very good! I used shortening instead of butter because I ran out but wouldn't suggest it.

I am very confused about the amount of chocolate in this recipe. Can anyone help? The proportions are

1 (4 oz) bar of bittersweet choc
1.5 (1 oz) squares of unsweetened
.5 (4 oz) bar of bittersweet choc

So, how much chocolate. I think First there is 4 oz chopped up. Then there is 1 oz or 1.5 squares. Or is it 1.5 1 oz squares for 1.5 oz total. Then .5 of a 4 oz bar or 2 oz. total? I'm going to go with 4+1.5+2 = 7.5
