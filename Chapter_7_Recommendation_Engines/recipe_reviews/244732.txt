I really like Ranch Dressing, so I tried this.   I did make 2 changes.  I soaked the ears of corn in cold water for about 5 min before roasting them.  (They kind of steamed/roasted) I also like a strong flavor of ranch dressing so I put the dry dressing mix in a shaker and liberally sprinkled the buttered ears of corn.  YUMMY!

Haven't tried oven-roasted corn before.  Found this recipe and decided to try it.  Whole family loved it!  My kids even chose the corn over the main course. :)

It really needed 10 extra minutes for corn roasting perfection.
