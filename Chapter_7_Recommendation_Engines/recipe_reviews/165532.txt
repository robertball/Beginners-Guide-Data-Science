Compared to "that burrito place" (which I frequent at LEAST once a week), this comes close, but not enough for me to use as a substitute for my "burrito place's" rice fix. I wanted to leave the chicken bouillon out, but I always make my recipes as-is (or as close as I can) on the first run through. To anyone who is skeptical: leave it out, or cut the amount in half. I've tried another recipe with much better results, Google "Chipotle Copycat Lime Rice."

This isn't really that good. We doubled the recipe and were anxious to make it due to the fact that we enjoy that certain "burrito place" that they claim it tastes like. However, such was not the case. I don't know if it is because we used a rice cooker but it just didn't turn out that well. The taste was a lot more like chicken when I was expecting more lime and cilantro. I would probably cut the chicken bullion is half and add more lime juice and cilantro. Still, we put it in burrito shells with seasoned chicken...not too bad, not too good. Sorry no picture...just looked like rice

I used a bit less lime juice than the recipe calls for after reading the reviews.  Also I the cilantro (plus a bit extra chopped finely) just before the rice finished cooking to allow the extra heat to increase the cilantro flavor.  Turned out quite well and went great with the mexican dish I was making.  Will make again for sure.

The chicken bouillon granules kills the lime and cilantro taste.  Use plain water instead and you will get the taste that you are looking for.

This was light and fresh tasting and we both loved the lime/cilantro blend of flavors.  Hubs and I enjoy cilantro in mild amounts so I reduced it by about half but prepared the rest of the recipe just as directed. The chicken bouillon rounded out the flavors and just for a little richness I added a dab of butter. This is a delicately flavored rice, perfectly suited for more highly seasoned main dishes.  I used this as the side dish for "Blackened Tuna Steaks with Mango Salsa," also from this site. It was a delicious combination.

When I was done revving up this recipe it was good, but the base recipe was just average.  I’m taking it to a work potluck and we have several vegetarians there (so I nixed the chicken bouillon) as some of the reviews suggested.  I think it would have been better with the bouillon.  Anyhow... I used brown rice.....added a can of black beans (drained and rinsed), garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, and some cumin.  Kosher salt, and fresh ground pepper.  It’s much better, but...when I tasted the original recipe there was NO WAY I would have taken this to a potluck “as is” because it was just to bland.  I have a reputation to uphold...lolol    I think it would be best layered into a big ol’ bathtub burrito as filler (as opposed to an actual side dish).  Or maybe with some delish marinated flank steak served over it.

Turned out pretty good! We used basmati rice- it is what the burrito places use and can be found at most grocery stores. Just be sure to follow the cook time that the rice package recommends as we overcooked ours! Will be try this in some different burritos!

I'm not the biggest fan of cilantro (I'm of the camp who thinks it tastes soapy) but I tolerated this okay because I reduced the amount some.  Loved the lime. I used chicken broth instead of the water and bouillon. This was darn good and I added some butter which made it even better. Four stars even with the cilantro.

I don't think this tastes much like "that popular burrito place", but there's nothing majorly wrong with this recipe. I cut the bouillon in half and doubled the cilantro and lime. This recipe could benefit from a little cumin and garlic, but it's a good base. Thanks :)

Ya might try a different rice.  I love Jasmine rice and have made this recipe using it.  Also, infuse your lime with a tablespoon of olive oil...clings to the rice better.

I made this as a burrito filling. I pretty much doubled the cilantro stated in the recipe - because I love it so much! I also let the rice cook a little while longer because I found that the it was to stiff. Also I didn't add the chicken bouillon cubes. It was pretty good and went well with the black bean salsa filling and guacamole!

It's always hard to rate when I love it and another family member hated it.  I think the difference is that I ate mine WITH Shish Kabobs and he opted to eat his as a stand alone side dish.  For me, it was a nice complement to Chicken and Bacon Shish Kabobs, but for him the lime flavor was too tangy in a stand alone rice dish.

Creamy and mild-flavored rice; the lime and cilantro do not overpower the chicken taste from the bouillon .  Served with border-style shrimp, black beans topped with chopped onions, spiced marinated tomatoes, and cherry jello with sliced fresh cherries.  This is solid side dish to accompany a variety of entrees.

This was my first time eating cilantro lime rice. I thought this was an excellent recipe. I used a can of chicken broth intstead of water and bouillon granules. I squeezed a bit more fresh lime on my rice before serving and salt and peppered to taste. I will make this again!

I made a batch in my rice cooker and it turned out great. I used them as a filler in barrbacoa burritos. I added barrbacoa, lettuce, pico de gallo, some shredded montery jack cheese and rolled them up in a flour tortilla. Delicious!

This was really good.  I had read the reviews, and some were not so positive, but it sounded good so I went ahead and tried it.  We loved it.  It does have a strong lime taste, so you may want to cut the amount of lime in half, however we were eating the meal with a sweeter wine and it complimented it well.

Yum. Great way to use fresh cilantro. Had my meal all set up and unfortunately realized I had no rice in the pantry, so I substituted quinoa instead. Given the mealy texture of quinoa, I thought it might need a bit more, so I added a handful of frozen edamame in the last couple of minutes of cooking. Tasted terrific and the family loved it. We'll use this recipe again. Have to disagree with the comment about not using the chicken granules. I thought the broth flavoring was a great addition to the dish.

I think this was very very good, just as written. I paired it with the chicken enchilada verde, that I also got off this site. I served it with black beans that had a tiny bit of cilantro and red onions cooked into it. Definitely a keeper in our house!

This became a family favorite from day one,especially paired with Mexican grilled chicken or a spicy sausage.  Fresh cilantro is a must since it offers the best fragrance.

This recipe is amazing. I just made a few changes in order to make it more like the rice I like. I put 2 cups of rice in with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and sautéed it for a bit. Then added 2.5 cups of water and the 2 tablespoons of chicken bouillon. Brought it to a boil and then let it simmer for 25 mins. Then I added the cilantro and 2 limes and salt. It came out really good.

This recipe was very good, I changed it a little by adding canned bullion instead of granules, also I sautéed the rice before adding the bullion. when the rice was finished I added some fresh butter, along with the lime juice and the cilantro, and garlic powder, thanks for this great recipe, my family loved it

Pretty average, bit light on the flavor. Recommend more lime juice and cilantro for more kick.

Tastes pretty close to Chipotle's recipe.  I put in the juice from a whole lime and I think it was too much.

I used this as a filler for chicken tortilla soup with black beans. the combo of the 3 was great! I will try to cut the bouillon in half next time and see what flavor I get. Thanks!

After reading the other reviews I made a few modifications.  I only used half of a vegetable bullion cube and I tripled the lime juice and cilantro.  It turned out tangy and flavorful.  I will make this again.

Yeah! I got alot of compliments on this rice. We BBQ carne asada, had refried beans along with this rice. It was just right for this. BBQ. Yes we were all mexicans and I'm always looking for something different than your tomato based mexican rice which I'm not a big fan of and this was it. I did use Caldo de Pollo and it was very good, I made it again for some other friends who are vegetarians using Swanson vegetable broth and it was just as good. Add corn and peas and you have a wonderful vegetarian meal or side dish. I dont know about any burrito places that use rice like this, but I do know that this will be our new Mexican rice. Thanks Mrs. Brown

I almost forgot about this recipe as I made it awhile back. But I did not care for this recipe; it's nothing like the burrito place. I found it sticky and starchy tasting. I only remembered this disaster today because I finally got around to trying user { Heidi} 's suggestion (her review is right below the recipe as a popular review).  That recipe was much closer to "the burrito place".

I used brown rice and cooked according to package directions for 50 min. using plain water and a bay leaf or two.  When done, I removed the bay leaf and then added zest of a whole lime and juice of 1/2 lime.  I also added salt and a little avocado oil (could use olive oil), and cilantro.  My son said it tasted just like the rice at his favorite Chipotle Grill place.

Made this rice dish alongside the "Chicken Breasts with Lime Sauce" recipe from here. Turned out fantastic. Since the chicken recipe called for lime juice and having to cut that recipe's ingredients helped me with a half of a lime left over for this recipe. Instead of using a chicken bullion, I used a "Not Chick'n" bullion cubes instead. Bottom line, fantastic dish that is going in my recipe box for future use. 

Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We thought this was quite tasty. I'm not familiar with whatever chain makes the original, so I can't speak to how close this is to it, but for a rice side dish it's good. I used it to go under "Trinidad Stewed Chicken" from this site and it was a great complement. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe tastes almost like the one from that famous burrito place. I say "almost" because I made a change to make it taste like the one from the famous burrito place. Instead of cooking the rice in chicken bouillons, I cooked the rice as is, alone. Then mixed in 1 tablespoon of butter to the hot rice and mixed until the rice was coated with butter. Then added the lime juice, cilantro and salt. This tasted great. Perfect for summer days.

I do this recipe myself with Basmati rice and I add ground red chilli as well as season with salt and pepper...tis a killer to serve with Teriyaki marinated salmon (24hrs marinating if pos) which I then poach or grill. Nice healthy meal that my family love!

We used a rice steamer instead and omitted the chicken bouillon (I didn't know how I felt about the chicken flavor) - very tasty!  It went perfect with our Tequila Lime Shrimp!

This recipe was delicious, everything I hoped it would be, with a few modifications! I substituted Uncle Ben's Brown Rice (4 servings - reduced water to 2 cups), added about a 1/4 cup onions and 2 beef bouillon cubes to the rice, water and butter, in the end I doubled the cilantro and lime juice, and did not add any salt having used the bouillon cubes. Enjoy!

There was way too much lime juice in the recipe for my liking, and I really couldn't taste the cilantro.

As suggested by others and by experimentation, I use brown jasmine rice, cut the bouillon in half (so you can appreciate the other flavors more and to reduce sodium content), and add a tablespoon of butter to the water. Throw it in the rice cooker and it's a quick, easy, and delicious addition to our Mexican feast nights.

I made this receipe without the chicken boullion bits becausae im a vegetarian and dont like the taste of it. I also made this with basmati rice which helped with the flavor a bit but overall was a bit bland. will try again later and tweak it a bit!

I never had the rice from "the famous burrito place" but I really liked this recipe. I sauted the rice in butter and diced onion before adding the cooking liquid. Was a great side with Mexican Baked Fish also from this site. Will definitely make again.

Pretty good for a basic rice side for mixing/topping with more vibrant tasting entrées. I used Jasmine rice instead of plain/basmati rice and thought it brought out the lime really well. 

I'd like to see how to vamp this into a main entrée kind of recipe. In the meantime I think I will try pouring some black beens and/or barbacoa on top to add some jazz.

This was a tasty rice, but nothing special.  Served with black beans and they made a good side dish together.  The lime was lost.

very very good rice!! only thing was that my rice started sticking to the bottom of the pan,and finished after about 15 minutes of simmering.  possibly because I have a gas stove? not sure, but the result was delicious anyway.  Thank you!!!

This is a great change from the red mexican rice... I have had this rice at burrito places but it's always been in the burrito so I've never tasted it on it's own, so not sure if this recipe tastes like theirs or not, but it's still very good and refreshing. My mom made two cups of instant white rice for me right before I got home from work so I just took 1 cup and added some lime juice and cilantro to it and stirred it all together. Used the other cup for mexican rice also from this site.

I see some reviewers give a lower rating due to the recipe being a bit "bland." However, I liked to think of it as simple and mild. It's a great side dish to serve next to a spicier main dish. It is also versatile, and as other reviewers did, you can add things to vary the flavor. I might try a can of chopped mild green chilies, or some red or black beans, or some tomatoes or spinach. There are many possibilities

I Doubled the Cilantro and Lime. I boiled the lime and cilantro while boiling the rice. After rice was to proper tenderness, I added the next round of Cilantro and Lime. I also added a hit of garlic. Turned out beautifully with much flavor.

Good. I eliminated the bouillion completely based on others' feedback. Was a bit tangy with the lime but I ended up stuffing it into enchiladas instead of using it as a side dish and it added nice flavor.

I really liked it. I improvised a bit and took out the chicken things and added more lime. I actually liked my rice more than the mexican place near my home. Maybe it was the extra lime.

Not bad, but a little bland.  I made it in my rice cooker.  If I made this again, I would definitely  use more cilantro and more lime.

I had to make this recipe twice...when I used regular rice, it was very moist and sticky.  I don't know what I did wrong. I started over using Minute rice and it was delish!  I too added some extra seasonings to it - garlic powder, diced onion, and a little cayenne pepper.  Served it with the Across the Border Tequila shrimp from this site and it was a huge hit!  Not a drop left over!

I am so sorry but I did not care for this recipe. I followed it EXACTLY and it was just not good at all. I even tried to add LOTS more cilantro-still just not right. I had to quickly make another side dish instead as the main course was almost finished. We love cilantro, lime and rice so thought this would be perfect, I guess it's just not the dish for us.

This rice is really good.  I didn't read the recipe through once i got home, so i forgot the bouillon, but it was still good.  It was definitely missing something without the bouillon, but the cilantro and lime gave the rice a really fresh taste.

I made this last night, and there's something about it that my husband and I didn't like.  I think the recipe calls for too much water, so I would reduce it if I were to make this again.  I had to use dried cilantro, but I think my issue is that there are too many competing flavors to sort out.  It might have been different had I used fresh cilantro, but I don't think I'm willing to try.  Sorry.

My family loves this rice, personally I would give it a 3-4.  This recipe can come together in less than 2 minutes if you use the uncle bens already cooked long grain rice and micro it for a min or two.

The cilantro is kind of overpowering in this recipe (especially if its fresh), I'd recommend using a bit less cilantro and a bit more lime.  Otherwise it was pretty good, I'm going to serve it with a jerk chicken recipe tonight with the proper modifications.

Very simple and easy. This will make for a good staple dish. I'll keep making it and tweaking it. Didn't have fresh cilantro so I bloomed 2 tbsp. of dried cilantro in 2 tbsp. hot water. Next time I'll use fresh chopped. Also I didn't have broth so I used plain old water. Still very good. I added corn this time so maybe peas next time.

Made this for a large gathering, using store-bought chicken stock instead of the bouillon and water. Everyone loved it - even all the kids and my SUPER picky hubbie! Will definitely be making again! Goes great with the slow cooker cilantro lime chicken - YUM!

I used my rice cooker and used 1 cup of chicken broth. Added cilantro and lime juice after it was cooked. Would add a pinch of salt but was very tasty!  Served with Mexican round steak made in the crock pot.

I doubled this recipe as well as seasonings.  I'm giving it 4 stars because it really needs more seasoning to be anything special...easily done.  Next time I will add cumin, increase salt and cilantro.

I've made this rice many times now. The orginal recipe was good but, now I change a few things. I use chicken broth to cook the rice and add one tablespoon of butter and one chicken bullion cube. I never measure the lime juice, just squeeze a whole lime onto the rice. This is a nice change from always fixing a Spanish style rice with Mexican dishes.

Nothing like the "burrito place".   Cut the chicken bullion.  I add the lime a bit at a time until it's just right.  I also added some butter.  It enhanced the flavor but didn't take it over.  I've used three types of rice, long grain, basmati, and Jasmine.  Thought the Jasmine is a bit stickier, I liked it best.

Love this rice! I make it with the Tacos in Shells recipe. They compliment each other well. I add the cilantro by taste versus the measured amount.

Ya, I gotta agree... water over chicken broth and a little less lime juice. I'm gonna stick with the amount of cilantro because my taste buds fully dig on it!! It was very good, though. And different taste buds have different ideas of what's good. So, I saw look at the amounts and decide on your own. Do that, and you got yourself a winner rice dish!!

I used this as a base to imitate a burrito bowl from a restaurant. I used brown jasmin rice. I did not have chicken bouillon. So I added a litte Adbo to the water as I boiled the rice.  I served it with black beans and pieces of avocado. It was delicious.

I start off with a large high sided skillet and roast  garlic in grape seed oil then add the rice and toast all of it until the rive has a nice nutty smell. Then I use chicken stock seasoned to taste so it's flavorful like chicken soup not bland. Simmer for exactly 23 minutes (high altitude were 4,000 ft  above sea level) Then I added the fresh celantro and lime juice and served this rice with Mesquite Smoked Talapia Fish Tacos and refried beans

This rice was good- I do like things a little more spicy but it was great in our fish burritos.  I think I might add a diced jalapeno next time,maybe a little more cilantro(only because I love fresh cilantro!) Give it a try, you just might like it too!

I love this. It's fast and easy and I think it has a wonderful flavor. I've also tried it with a pat of butter and with a dash of sesame oil and both were really good. The sesame oil gives it an Asian flair. So it works well as a side dish for a variety of cuisines!

This was "OK." It's nothing special, but it's not "terrible" either. Actually, my bf liked this a lot and said he'd eat it all by itself (I used the rice as a burrito filler). Even though ENseeber's Lime Cilantro Rice got a higher rating, Mrs. Brown's version sounded better to me (I think the amount of lime juice was spot on... adding lime zest as per ENseeber would have been overpowering IMHO). I must say that the rice/water ratio is WAAAAY off, but it could be because I used instant rice instead of long grain rice (?)!!! I didn't have any long grain rice on hand in order to compare the cooking directions on both packages. The back of my instant rice box directs to boil 1 c. water FIRST, THEN add 1 c. rice, cover and let sit for 5 minutes (this makes 2 servings - 1.5 c. water/rice would yield 3 servings, exactly half this recipe's yeild). I ended up draining the excess liquid and all was fine (whew!). Nothing compares to Chipotle's rice, but I'm glad I have this recipe on hand for those times I crave it! Thanks for sharing :)

Very tasty! I sauteed an onion and some garlic, and add basmati rice to sautee a bit. When it was finished cooking, I added freshly chopped cilantro and dried cranberries. It was really good and super easy!

I found it to be very tasty.  I used a vegetable bouillon cube instead of chicken and  Texmati basmati rice.  It tasted very fresh.  My family really liked it.

I loved this rice. It was great! Will make again for sure. My boyfriend made chicken tacos and added the rice.

Pretty good! My roommate and I made this to go with the Campbell's enchilada recipe on this site. We used two chicken bouillon cubes and added 1/2 stick of margarine. We eyballed the cilantro, and added only one tablespoon. I could just eat the rice! :-)

Okay, so I loved this recipe. I thought it was simple and great aaccompanied with chimichurri salmon and a pablano sauce. It was prefect. I didnt go by the meansurements. I squeezed almost a full lime and about 2 tbls cilantro into the rice (I cut the rice amount by half because I was only serving 2 people). It was fantastic and I will definatly be making this recipe again.
