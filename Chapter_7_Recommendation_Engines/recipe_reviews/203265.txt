The flavour was fine, but the cooking time was way too long for my liking. I cranked the heat up to reduce the time.

I don't mind the 2 hr roasting time, but did find that I had a lot of cheese and dressing for the amount of tomato.  The flavor is amazing.

The flavors are good, but I'm not sure the roasting of the tomatoes is really required.  I think this would be fine with fresh tomatoes, maybe let them marinade for a while.  I also thought it needed less dressing (or more tomatoes).

Takes some time to prepare and doesn't make a whole lot; but it is really good.  A really winner in our home!
