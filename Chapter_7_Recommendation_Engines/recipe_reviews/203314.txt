Excellent!  I have made this 3 times in thhe last 2 weeks.  I added 1/4 c. ground flax for extra benefit.  The kiddies love these and syrup is not required. No mess! These are very moist and great reheated as well.  I did try this once with frozen blueberries and that worked as well but fresh peach is best.  I will try other frozen fruit as the seasons change.
Update - I've now made this at least a dozen time's and wanted to add that shredded apple is a VERY close 2nd substitution for fresh in-season peach.  A little sprinkle pf cinnamon-sugar and you have a great start to your morning.

These pancakes are sweet, light, fluffy, and...delicious! I didn't have a peach on-hand so I left it out and topped them with homemade blueberry syrup instead. Perfect served with a dollop of whipped cream!

Love em! I used whole wheat flour and replaced the milk for water. Because of the whole wheat I used a tad more water. They turned out fabulous! Even my little picky pancake eater loved them. Oh and I also used canned peaches since I didn't have fresh. I just took out the equiv. of one peach and chopped it up. We used the rest as a side to our pancakes. I'll be adding this to our meal rotation!

Yum, I love finding healthier breakfasts for my diabetic husband. I get tired of making him Steel Cut Oatmeal. This was fantastic! I subbed Splenda for the sugar & added in some ground up flax. I also ran out of butter so used Olive Oil. I made his pecan & used mixed fruit in mine. We ate it with Sugar Free Syrup & it was fantastic!

My kids loved these pancakes - they said they were the best ever! I added slightly more cinnamon and more peaches to the recipe.

No peach, but I did have fresh nectarine. I had a half pint of raspberries that were about to go bad so I added those, too. I made no other changes. I did make the batter last night and let it set in the fridge overnight, which probably wasn't the best idea. Everything turned out okay, pancakes were tasty.....I just don't think cottage cheese in pancakes is for us. NOTE: Use you 1/4 measuring cup and try to make the pancakes on the smaller side. The pancakes will spread, you'll want them a little smaller.

WOW!!  These were REALLY good and healthy!  All 5 of my kids gobbled them up and asked for seconds.  Then, my husband finished off what was left and raved about them too!  Highly recommend!  Only change I made was to use canned peaches!  Try it!!!

These were light but yet not airy, if that makes any sense.  The family loved them and rated them a 5.  The one person that does not like pancakes at all rated them a 4....that says it all. I used apple instead of peach and topped with apple topping and warmed syrup.  Will defiantly make these again.  Thanks for sharing!!!

These were terrific!  I substituted nonfat cottage cheese, used one egg plus six egg whites (the kitties like the egg yolks,) nonfat milk, skipped the butter, and had only canned peaches, which I chopped up and used.  These were eaten all the same day!

Super tasty (and relatively healthy)! I needed to use up some cottage cheese, and found this recipe. I only had about 1/2c of cottage cheese, so halved the recipe, which still yielded 12 relatively big (3-4" diameter) pancakes. I didn't have any peaches, so used a small apple, shredded, instead (like other reviewers suggested) - which came out really well with the cinnamon flavour. To make it healthier I mixed in 2tbps of flax seed with the egg mix. The cottage cheese gave the pancakes a light texture, and I will be using this as a staple recipe for pancakes from now on! We ate the pancakes with some Greek yoghurt and a bit of honey on the side. Then scattered about a tbsp of flaked almonds to finish it off - lovely!

What a fabulous use of fresh ripe peaches.  This was excellent.  I had to first assure my husband that there was nothing wrong with the “lumpy” batter, and no, I wasn’t trying to kill him.  Once we tasted these delicious and light pancakes all thoughts turned to taking the next bite.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Really neat recipe idea, just made my quick version (busy chef) used Krusteaz pancake  mix, water, the vanilla, baking powder, salt, Splenda, cottage cheese and cinnamon, canned freestone peaches, no eggs,sprayed pan and added veg. oil, turned out wonderful and fluffy, think shredded apple would also be awsome for Fall season, also as waffle batter. Thanks!

I cooked allot of my recipes in my time. But I have to say this is one of my favorites. My husband and I love them. I noticed that in one review someone thought they did not taste done. They're just "very" moist from the cottage cheese in the mixture.

These were very good! I used more peach and sub'ed whole wheat flour and brown sugar for the whites. I let the batter rest for about 15 mins to thicken up, and they were still a little challenging to cook. Next time I may try using a blender with the cottage cheese so they cook more uniformly. A guilt-free breakfast indulgence. Thank you!

Edited to add - Since finding this recipe a couple weeks ago, I've made this probably 10 times. All different fruit and spice combos and it's to DIE for. Blending the cottage cheese first does make them more round and easier to cook. These are a MUST try!

Excellent! My husband, who isn't a cottage cheese fan, told me he would make his own breakfast before he ate these. He did make his own breakfast, but then ended up eating half of mine as well because he liked these so much. This makes a very moist pancake with succulent pockets of delicious peach paradise. I think I will marry these pancakes.

I'm boring and usualy use Aunt Jamia(? I know spelling is bad) but she just got put on the back shelf. This is so moist, wonderful texture and extermly tasty. I used canned peaches instead of fresh and I don't think it would really make a difference in the batter. Very, very tasty!

I made these yesterday, following the recipe as written, only increasing the cinnamon by 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon because we love it in our house. These pancakes are a real treat! They are going into my regular rotation with a special note that they are definitely company-worthy. Thanks for sharing!

They tasted great, but they were hard to cook.  The batter was thin, so they spread out far on the pan.  I ended up cooking them in a small frying pan, so they would stay small.

I used wheat flour instead of white flour, egg beaters for the eggs, skim milk, and stevia for the sugar. I threw all the ingredients into the bowl at the same time and mixed it. Pancakes came out fluffy and divine.

July 2012- Halved the recipe for the 2 of us. Only differences were to use 1/2 cup cottage cheese which I think was low-fat, eyeballed 1/2 tsp vanilla, 1 tbsp butter which I prob should have waited to melt, 1/2+ peach shredded, 1/2 cup AP flour, 1 tbsp dermera sugar, etc. Again, didn't smush the pancakes down while cooking. Light, fluffy, delicious!!
---------------------------------------
Made it with 100% whole wheat flour, splenda sugar for baking, and frozen blueberries. I didn't smush the pancakes down since the blueberries were so big and they were delicious, soft, fluffy, and moist. Oh and I didn't have cinnamon and it was still quite yummy.

These were excellent!  We are definitely adding them to the breakfast rotation in our house.  I used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup ap flour.  Also, I used frozen peaches and just diced them up really fine.  My one-year-old twins couldn't get enough, and they don't like cottage cheese.  Delicious!

I am not a fan of pancakes but I love these.  Will make them more regularly.  Substitutions that I made were to use whole wheat flour and 1 cup of frozen berry mix (defrosted and mashed up) instead of a peach (will try the peach when they are in season).  My husband and 14 month old also enjoyed these.

Super yummy! I think one of the individual cups of diced peaches, drained, would be fine for this recipe. My peach was pretty ripe, so it was the consistency of canned, anyway. Also, if you're expecting a light fluffy pancake, this is not it. They have four eggs in them so they are going to be a bit on the custardy side. Overall, a super flavor that is sure to please. I will definitely make them again!

Great option for pancakes!  I subbed Mango-Peach-Apricot spread for the peach and left out the sugar.  Also added a few tablespoons of flaxseed. Much healthier!

my husband and I loved these pancakes.  I didn't have any peaches, so used some fresh strawberries, I also used 1% cottage cheese, and they still turned out fabulous.  Will definitely be on our favorite list.

Yum!! great and feels so healthy.  I put in some whole oats...about 1/4 cup, no peaches and lots of vanilla, since the cap accidentally came off:}  However, they turned out super!!

I was very hesitant to try this recipe since I had never heard of cottage cheese in pancakes. After reading the reviews I decided to try it and am I glad I did! These are awesome. My two year old son loves them and I have also made these pancakes for my niece who has type 1 diabetes. Not too many carbs and some added protein.  Thanks for the recipe!

A nice 'base', but not very peachy. The only change I made was to add a banana and delete the sugar. Kinda of blah.

Ok, I never thought anything with cottage cheese in it could be any good but I was wrong.  These pancakes are truly moist and delicious.  I'm giving it 4 stars simply because I've made them a few times now and they always come out very thin--almost crepe like and we found that they still needed butter and maple syrup.  But oh, are they good.  I substituted maple syrup for the sugar and used a 15 oz. can of sliced peaches in pear juice cut into chunks.  The cottage cheese just melts away as they cook and makes the pancakes very moist.

This didn't go over so well here. We felt it wasn't sweet enough, and the little bits of nectarine (I didn't have a peach) didn't blend well with the other ingredients. If you do make this, you may want to use half whole wheat flout.

Made these a little more diabetic friendly. Used 1 cup of whole wheat flour in place of all purpose, 2 packets of Sun Crystals(all natural sweetner, it is stevia and pure cane sugar) in place of white sugar and added 2 Tblsps. flaxseed. These are delicious. No syrup needed, just put extra peaches on top and a little whipped cream. Other fruits would work fine too, like chopped apples, blueberries, bananas, whatever you like.

These are SO healthy, and so versatile!  I made three variations of this for breakfast Sunday: plain, banana and apple.  They were DELICIOUS and kept us full longer than a typical pancake (thanks to the added protein in the cottage cheese).  THIS will be my go-to pancake recipe from now on!

Had to try this, and they were delicious. I used a can of peaches, and diced them, and used Splenda instead of sugar, and half & half instead of milk. Also used large-curd cottage cheese. The texture is almost like a crepe and they're very light. Next time I'll try adding flaxmeal as I've read in other reviews, for added nutrition. If you're interested at all,  you must try these.

Yummy!  My family loved them!  I replaced a few things though.  I used flax in place of 2 of the eggs, applesauce instead of butter, truvia in place of sugar, non fat cottage cheese.   I also replaced the peach with Mango.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks!

This has become my go to pancake recipe. I've made it exactly as written and have made it with various substitutions based on what I have on hand and they turn out great every time. I typically only use 2 eggs. Have used pears and apples instead of peaches depending on the season and even subbed greek yogurt for part of the cottage cheese b/c I ran out and they were still delish! You won't regret making these! Also, I love that they give my kiddo a more well rounded bfast than typical pancakes. Sometimes we even eat them for dinner.

Oh my goodness these were good!!  Since it was just my boyfriend and me, I froze the left over batter that we had made for dinner and he asked for it for breakfast 2 days later.  Still tasty!  I took other reviewers advice and heated up blackberry jelly as a substitute for syrup.  SO SO GOOD!!  I also serve it up with turkey bacon. This will become a regular in our house!

These were hit! The one complaint about texture and color -- he must have done something wrong because both were perfect. I used two peaches and my four eggs were smaller ones.  The only thing I might do differently next time is add more cinnamon. These were great!

Very good recipe! My kids are picky cottage cheese eaters, so first  I pureed it until smooth (or you could try Ricotta). I would also like to try adding more peaches and other fruit to this recipe!

I liked these except I could taste the eggs. Even my son asked if there were eggs in them. Oddly, he didnt notice the cottage cheese nor peaches. So next time I'll try with only two eggs and maybe bananas.

I'm so glad I  gave this a try!! This takes pancakes/flap jacks to a entirely new, and better level. Like others have said, I will be trying this with other fruits also, but the cinnamon and peach is a wonderful combo!! Thanks for sharing!

*I made these exactly as recipe stated*-First, these did not fluff up for me, they did in the pan at first, after the flip they sunk. I think they need baking powder to make them fluffier. Second, I have a regular T-Fal frying pan and an electric stove, these were starting to burn at medium, so I had to turn it down to medium low so they would cook all the way through without burning ( some were still raw). I didn't care for the flavour or texture. I think pureeing the cottage cheese would help-( I have made and like ricotta cheese pancakes.) I rated two stars because my Dad liked them, but my husband and kids did not like them either. Sorry, these were just not for me.

Made these for Saturday morning breakfast today and, at the suggestion of my son who was home from college, instead of syrup topped with a combo of softened cream cheese with a drizzle of honey!!  AMAZING!!!  I might try to roll them with the cream cheese in the middle next time!  Thanks for the recipe.

Tried it this morning.  It was a pretty quick, easy recipe that yielded some of the best pancakes I have had in years.  Definitely a repeater!

I love these pancakes! I made them with blueberries because I didn't have any peaches on hand. Next time I am going to try chocolate chip! I also added a dash of cardamom to the batter and it gave it a great flavour.

I think i need to add less milk (almost by half) since the cottage cheese gives so much liquid. I didn't have peaches so i used mango and cardamon instead. it was delicious

Made a few substitutions/changes: no butter, only 2 eggs instead of 4, whole wheat flour instead of white, honey instead of sugar, did not use salt, sprayed pan with oil instead of using butter and added frozen blueberries because I did not have peaches. really good!

I am not a big peach fan so I made these with raspberries and the whole family thought they were great! (Other than the fruit substitution I followed the recipe.) We used honey cinnamon syrup (recipe found with the chocolate chip pancakes receipe on this site) on them. Will definitely make these again. Thanks for the recipe!

I made these for my family and they loved them!  I didn't have any peaches so I used apple instead and I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of white flour.  The cottage cheese and fruit gives them good texture and I thought they had great flavor.  I will be making these again soon!

I was not sure my picky eaters would like them, but they are on their 3rd pancake already!  I also did whole wheat flour and added a touch of water to the 1/2 cup of milk.  No syrup necessary! Very yummy! :)

I made these for breakfast today.  Bummer!  What a waste of good syrup.  They tasted like eggs (I have a strong dislike for anything eggy).  I love cottage cheese, that's why I decided to try the recipe.  The color was weird, even my wife said "I was looking forward to saying that they looked ugly but taste good" but she couldn't say that with a straight face.  And she likes eggs!  She said it reminded her of quiche.  I used grated apple, double cinnamon, nutmeg and cardamom.  The flavor of the spices and apple were fine, it was definetely a texture thing for me and the little woman.  I saw some reviewers that mentioned serving it to company.  I'm afraid to say this, but I wouldn't serve it to company.  Sorry, this was my first disappointment on this recipe site.

We rate this a 3 star because it didn't have a taste besides the peaches.it was an easy recipe and will probably do it again but might add more flavor. Other than that, it was good with the syrup. We were actually shocked that we couldn't taste the cottage cheese even though it calls for it.

These were easy and great. I boosted with 1/2 cup blueberries and 1/2 an avocado and 5% cream instead of milk (needed higher fats in mine) and blended the moist ingredients in the blender! Husband loved them.

Really really good! Followed recipe ingredient measurements but added fresh strawberries instead of peaches. Such an interesting texture and doesn't need much maple syrup to make them interesting because they have a nice flavor on their own! Make some now!!

Made it exactly as written, except 2 eggs and 1/2 cup egg whites. Also, used frozen, packaged peaches. They don't have as much flavor as fresh (or fresh-frozen) peaches, so will go with fresh next time. Shredding frozen peaches is easier than fresh, however.

This recipe was really good. Easy to make and low carb (for pancakes). I used canned diced peaches which I drained first. The result was light, fluffy and tasty. No syrup is necessary.  I will definitely make these again.

Made it using a frozen peach so added about a 1/3 cup more flour so batter would not be so runny. Pancakes have an excellent flavour and are light as a feather. Definitely will make again!!!

I loved this recipe. I left off the fruit and sugar, but would try with fruit in the future. I puréed the cottage cheese so it's not lumpy. I topped with sautéed apples and cinnamon. I would like to add flax next time as another user suggested. It's a keeper!

They were good, but not rave worthy. I followed the recipe as written. The batter was thick and needed a little help when spooned onto the pan so it wouldn't be mounded and cook unevenly. No matter what I did, the pancakes got "leggy", so they aren't very visually appealing. They were moist and the peach bits added a nice pop of juicy flavor, but nobody in the family gushed about how wonderful they were. I think I'll just add a little cinnamon to my regular pancake recipe and serve them with fresh sliced peaches on top. That would be easier, prettier and taste just as good or better.

Very good, even my picky kids loved them!! The only changes I made were to use peach and strawberry jam in place of the shredded peaches. I also used brown rice flour instead of all purpose flour, to make it gluten free.

I'm not sure why, because I didn't notice other reviewers saying anything about the pancakes being extremely dense and "squishy", but that's how mine turned out.  After adding another cup of flour and a little bit more sugar, they turned out great.  They are MUCH better WITH syrup.  Also, I didn't have any vanilla, so I used almond extract instead.  That was great!  I would highly recommend that substitution!  Oh, and I put all of the ingredients in the blender to keep the cottage cheese from making the pancakes all lumpy.

Easy to make, versatile, and delicious!  Thank you.  I can see the opportunity to easily change up the fruit for these wonderful pancakes.  My husband loves pancakes, so I am always looking for different ways to make them and this recipe fit the bill.  I used canned peaches as that is what I had on-hand and they were still great.  Half of the can went in the pancakes and I used the other half for the topping - peaches, sour cream, and a bit of Trader Joe's pumpkin butter - a terrific accompaniment.    We will be making these again.

Great recipe. I made a low-cal version of it by using Splenda (3 packets = 2 tablespoons), skim milk, non-fat cottage cheese. I also used apple slices instead of peach (and threw in some walnuts for fun).

Delicious! We were nervous about the shredded peach but it turned out fine. Grated two peaches directly into the mixture. Having made it several times now, i like to leave some chunks of peach. We used buttermilk in place of milk, whole wheat flour, and half tsp. Of ground ginger. Yum!
