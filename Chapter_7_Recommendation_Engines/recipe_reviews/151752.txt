I really enjoyed these cookies.

The only thing is...I suggest using 3 oz of chocolate chips apposed to the baker's chocolate.
Also, I rolled mine in chopped almonds and coconut, they were really good!!

I am not crazy about these cookies. The cookies really don't have good chocolate flavor. Needs more chocolate because with how they are the pecans over power the cookies.
