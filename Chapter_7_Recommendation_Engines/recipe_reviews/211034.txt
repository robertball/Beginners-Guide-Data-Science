This is an excellent recipe! It was absolutely delicious!  A few things that I would recommend - I made for 6 people and I probably should have used from 1 -  1 1/2 cups of dried bread crumbs instead of 2 cups (threw away probably at least 3/4 cup of crumbs). Also, I am shocked that it only calls for 1 jar of Ragu sauce. This is definitely not enough sauce to cover this recipe. This recipe SHOULD call for a jar and a half, minimum. Thankfully I had bought another jar to cover all the layers anyway. I used Ragu 6 cheese and the flavor was perfect for this dish. Overall, very wonderful dish.

This is a keeper for me because it is quick and easy and I like the idea of the no frying as it is a healther version. I did have to use 2 jars of sauce. I like Bertoli garlic and oil. I used 2 cups of bread crumbs,you really need it and can't avoid wasting some as it clumps when you dip the eggplant and the clumps have to be thrown out.  I did throw away part of the egg mixture though and felt 3 eggs with 2T of water would have been enough for dipping.  I turned the eggplant 1/2 way through  the cooking process and found 25 minutes enough.  I served sweet Italian sausage on the side and found it was a nice compliment, as suggested by another reviewer. I have a pan that is slightly larger than a 9x13 and that worked out better for me. Spray your foil before putting it on and the foil won't stick.  A good and easy recipe.

My husband and I love this.  No grease, and so yummy!  I used eggplant & zucchini, and put some peppers & onions in the oven while the other veggies were getting toasty.  Layered it all with sauce (about two jars) and mozzarella cheese.  Hubby doesn't like parm cheese.  Still wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe!

The recipe is fantastic.  I've used both regular and panko bread crumbs on different occasions.  The fact that it was all baked instead of fried, made it so much less messy, plus a nice health bonus.  if you've never made eggplant before (i hadn't) this is really an excellent recipe to try.  peeling the eggplant is a bit tricky, the better your veggie peeler, the easier time you'll have.

This was my first attempt at eggplant parmesan.  The eggplant tasted very yummy, but the recipe needed AT LEAST another  jar of sauce. The sauce cooked down and the dish was dry. I will try this dish again using more sauce and a different kind (my family did not care for the Ragu Robusto, a bit too heavy tasting).

Fantastic, I picked fresh eggplant from my garden and they were small Ichaban, so for me to make a small brownie size pan it took about 4.  This was great - my husband & I  loved it.  What was even better, we had leftovers and both had it for lunch the next day and we agreed it was even better the second day.  I can wait for more to be ready to pick so I can make this again.

Delicious without complicated. I have made this a number of times now. My vegetarian sweetheart loves taking this to work with her for a quick reheat in the microwave. Her coworkers tell her they wish they had a man at home who could cook so well. Thanks for this recipe.

I wanted to like this but it just wasn' t the same for me. I think I will just fry the eggplant.  I just prefer it that way.

This was really delicious.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I made a few minor changes.  We love lots of sauce, and since I served this on whole wheat linguini, we needed a second jar.  We also like lots of cheese, so I used 2 cups of the mozzarella.  2 eggs was enough, and I didn't add water to them.  Lastly, I garnished with a bit of basil and oregano for the top, and broiled it for about 5 minutes to brown it slightly.  It also freezes very well.

I thought this was excellent. I was looking to cut the frying step out due to time and health reasons. I made just as follows. I had it baking for about 25 minutes but it didn't brown much. I still took the second step and did the layering and second bake. I made it in a 2 quart dish and it baked up nicely in a half hour. I also left it uncovered. My fiance loved it. This is more like 4.5 stars. You really do need more sauce if you make the full recipe as it does absorb and you don't want it dry.

Absolutely wonderful, even for a guy.  So simple and delicious, I followed the directions and put it over a little pasta, and voila!  Definitely will make again.

This was absolutely perfect!  I especially loved the fact that there was no frying involved.  No mess and way less fat is always a good thing.  The only thing I did differently is that I made my own homemade sauce instead of using jarred or canned.  That coupled with the most perfect eggplants made for a delicious supper!

I made this with a few edits, and it came out great! I used the recipe for Homemade Tomato Basil Sauce on this site rather than the recommended sauce, and added ricotta cheese since I had it on hand. I didn't peel the eggplants, since I'm pretty lazy. This is an excellent way to use veggies from the CSA or garden.

I have never made Eggplant Parmesan before, fried or otherwise, but have used eggplant in many other dishes, so was very eager to try this. OMG - definitely in my Top 10 favorites, possibly top 5. I made almost no changes other using more eggplant (more like 2 small/medium) and a little more sauce. I did add one light extra layer of mozzarella in between the eggplant layers. I used Panko bread crumbs. Absolutely delicious. Can't wait to make it again!!!

Really good! I halved the recipe, but used the full amount of Ragu. Eggplant isn't my favorite vegetable, but covered in cheese and tomato sauce, it's not bad! I used Reggiano Parm because the stuff in the green can is not real parmesan cheese. Served this with Meatball Nirvana from this site.

This is my new eggplant parmesan recipe!  So much healthier than the fried version and just as tasty.  I did use my own homemade spaghetti sauce though, as I prefer it to jarred sauces (sorry).

I can't stand eggplant, but I loved this recipe. As other reviewers have noted the amount of sauce suggested seems to be insufficient; I used maybe an additional 1/2 cup or so. At any rate, this is easy and delicious--I made this at the behest of my boyfriend, who loves eggplant, and even though I was pretty confident I wouldn't like this, I cleaned my plate. I'll definitely make this again, perfect for a quick mid-week meal.

Excellent recipe, nice change from chicken parmesan.  I agree with other reviewers that you don't need 4 eggs and you definitely need more sauce.

Great receipe.  I was able to modify the recipe to be gluten-free by making my own bread crumbs.  I used a gluten-free baking mix to make a loaf of bread and crumbled double the amount called for in the recipe (since my bread crumbs are not the prepared dried seasoned bread crumbs).      I got rave reviews - not from the kids, but that's not the recipe's fault.

Excellent dish!  I did not think that a non-fried eggplant parmesan would be worth a .  I was wrong.  Even my husband loved it, and he likes full-fat *everything*.  We were blown away.

This was super easy to make, and I managed to whip this up on a week night.  Delicious!  Can't wait to make it again.  This was a great way to get more veggies in the diet.

The eggplant prep is great, but the whole thing cooks down kind of soggy. Good flavor, but not perfect for our fam.
