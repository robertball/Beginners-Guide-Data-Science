I noticed in the editing process that the staff listed mandarin oranges to be used for the feathers. They will work, but for a good variation of color and larger size, I used grapefruit and orange segments! And for the walnut wattle, it needs to be smooth side DOWN, bumpy side up! Enjoy

What a great dessert for my dinner party!  Easy to make and delicious.    When I put them out for dessert everyone raved!  I made a small change by using grapefruit slices instead of manderin oranges.  The size was more in keeping with the apple and apricot slices. This recipe is a KEEPER!!!

So cute!  I made this for my son's Christmas party at school, and it was a hit with the kids and the teachers.  Thanks for the great idea!

This is such a cute idea!  We made this last thanksgiving and the kids had a great time with it and ate their fruit turkeys while waiting for dinner to be ready.  I prepared all the pieces, made one for them to use as reference and let them have fun!  The only things I changed were that I used fresh clementines instead of grapefruit sections and that I used pecans instead of walnuts because that is what I had on hand.
