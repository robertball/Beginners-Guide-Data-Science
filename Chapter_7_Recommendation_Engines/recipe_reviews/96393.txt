My entire family, including a 4 year old enjoyed this reciepe.  We did make a couple of changes, the green chilies were grilled and placed on top and we used a spicy pepper jack cheese.  The cummin and chili powder really came through (maybe becuase my 1/2 teaspoon measuring is by sight and very liberal, the burgers were quite moist and the oats added to the texture.  We will make these agian very soon

These burgers were very good. I didn't add the salt but doubled the chili powder. Used pepperoncini in lieu of the green chilies which gave them a nice kick. Thanks!
