Excellent Pie. It was very creamy with a sweet flavor.  (and I cheated and used canned pumpkin)  Also, the recipe doesn't say to do so, but it really should be refrigerated before eating.  I was impatient and cut into the pie when it came out of the oven and it was very soupy. After it was refrigerated it was fine.  Rave review from co-workers and my husband.

I couldn't find a sugar pumpkin so I used a canned pumpkin puree. I used a homemade pie crust (no-fail pie crust III, from this site) & I used a little leaf fondant cutter to cut out leaves to decorate the pie crust. I used egg whites to "glue" the leaves on the crust & I wish I had sprinkled the leaves w/ some raw sugar to add a little sparkle...I will next time. Garnished w/a couple of extra leaves & some frosted cranberries. This pie tasted even better than it looks...it's fantastic! Served it w/ some maple flavored whipping cream ( I just added a bit of real maple syrup to fresh whipped cream as I am out of maple extract.) Thanks Carole Rhodus...thsi is probably the best pumpkin pie I have ever eaten (& I have eaten more than my fair share! LOL)

Absolutely incredible! I made a couple of substitutions. I used canned pumpkin, evaporated milk in place of half/half, I also didn't use clove or allspice, but used fresh ground nutmeg and the cinnamon.I also used 1 Tablespoon of maple extract.(I didn't have enough maple syrup).  This recipe just bursts with the "little extra" flavor! I am definately making this instead of my regular pumpkin recipe! It amazes me what a little maple flavor does to any ordinary recipe! UMM GOOD! Thanks so much!

EXCELLENT recipe -- it's now my favorite pumpkin pie.  Works great with canned pumpkin.  I put in only 1/2 cup brown sugar (instead of 3/4 cup), and it tasted just right to me.

Highly recommended pie, I read the review and reduced the brown sugar. I had 1/2 package (4oz.) of cream cheese in the fridge so I added it and reduces light cream to 1 cup. The result was excellent. Mind you I had almost enough filling to fill in 2 9'pies.

I found this pie to be a little too sweet for my taste.  If I were to make it again, I would definitely cut back on the sugar, and would use less ginger.  The ginger was a little overpowering.

This pie was FABULOUS. FOr the first time, I used the best of everything - fresh pumpkin puree, fresh spices (I ground the nutmeg and allspice myself), organic half-and-half, fresh whipped cream sweetened with maple syrup, and a tart pastry crust with an entire 1/2 lb. of organic butter. This pie was better than ANY pumpkin pie I've ever had (and got similar reviews from my husband and friends), and it now has a permanent place in my recipe box. Thank you!

The BEST pumpkin pie.  We like it ever better when we replace the brown sugar with just a dollop of fancy molassas.

After a long time of trying different pumpkin pie recipes that were good but not great, I have finally found The One. This is just as good as everyone says it is - even for those who aren't into pumpkin. I have made this pie several times and I do make 3 changes (sorry!). I use canned pumpkin (entire 15 oz. can), I decrease the brown sugar to 1/2 cup (the correct amount for you will depend on how sweet you like your pie and what kind of pure maple syrup you are using), and lastly I decrease the half and half to 1 cup (to shave off a little of the fat/calories). Really tasty - props to Carole for a pumpkin pie to eat any day of the year!

Amazing! I would give this 10 STARS if I could! This is by far the best, creamiest, tastiest pumpkin pie I have ever eaten. First of all I have an abundance of butternut squash from my garden, so after I baked it and prcessed in my food processor, I used that instead of the sugar pumpkin. I also eliminated the3/4 cup of brown sugar. I can't imagine why you would need so much sugar in this recipe?? (We don't eat refined sugar anyway.) The only other change I made was to reduce the ginger and the nutmeg to 1/2 tsp. I was afraid that it might be to much as written. As others noted it was very runny when I put it into the oven, but it solidified beautifully in the oven. All in all the end result was FANTASTIC!

Okay, so first I should state that I usually make a sweet potato pie for Thanksgiving, as I find pumpkin "boring". Well, NOT ANY MORE!!!!! Our guests took one bite and one asked "what restaurant did you used to work for? 'cause this is the best pumpkin pie I have ever had" One of my husbands favorites, he also thought it was one of the best Thanksgiving pies I have ever made. It did take longer to bake then stated, but that wasn't really an issue. I did use canned pumpkin, other than that I followed the recipe, adding extra spice, but I always do. Thanks for adding a new pie to my regime.  I wonder how the addition of orange would be? hummm..........................

Sooooo good, the best pumpkin pie I've ever made.  I've been trying to find a great pumpkin pie recipe, and I think this is it.  Family loved it as well.  I took reviewers' advice and decreased the sugar to about 1/3 cup and it came out perfect!!

great pie! made 1st one exactly according to recipe except limited the brown sugar to just 1/2 cup and also used 1 1/2 cups Libby's Canned Pumpkin instead. i personally thought it had a little too much spice so on my 2nd one, i left out the ginger and allspine and it is superb! brings out the maple better. thanks for the idea! never would of thought about maple syrup in a pie... haha

This was AMAZING!! Tons of compliments, several people said it was the best pumpkin pie ever.  I had to make two because I screwed up on the first one and HERE'S WHY:  You must stir all the ingredients (especially the egg) very well.  If you don't stir the eggs well, they will not be distributed evenly, the pie will not set and the egg whites will cook in lumps and settle to the top.  Even though the pie mixture is incredibly thin and it's scarry, KEEP STIRRING!!.   Other than that it wasn't that hard and I will be doing it again, (without throwing the first pie away).

I had to use canned pumpkin because fresh weren't available right now. This recipe was by far the BEST pumpkin pie I've ever had!! I served it to a housefull of Swedes on Canadian Thanksgiving and they all adored it. I served it with maple whipped cream and it was truly amazing. Thank you SO much!!

BRILLIANT Pie!!! I was born and raised in Vermont, but now live in Scotland. I had to learn how to make pumpkin pie from scratch (no canned pumpkin over here), and discovered fresh stuff is far better...and being a Vermonter, I ONLY use real Vermont Maple Syrup...This is truly a Vermont Pumpkin Pie!! Fantastic!!

I didn't taste maple, but I did taste a very gentle sweetness, perfectly balanced with pumpkin and spkce.  I did make the adjustment someone else did--1 cup maple syrup and 1/3 cup brown sugar.  And I only had canned pumpkin, so that's what I used.  Evaporated milk, as well.  This is my favorite pumpkin pie recipe to date!  If it's this good with cans, think  how good it will be with fresh ingredients!

***edited 11/24/2011 I made it in a bigger pan, 1-1/2 recipe, using 1-1/4 c maple syrup and not even 1/2 c brown sugar, rounded up to 5 eggs and used heavy cream and fresh pumpkin.  Eyes lit up with the first bite!  Definitely my best ever pumpkin pie!

This is absolutely the best pumpkin pie recipe I have found.  Be sure and double the recipe because one pie just isn't enough.  I will definitely be using this recipe over the holidays.

I have made this pie 4 times this year.  It has now replaced my traditional pumpkin pie recipe that I was making for more than 10 years.  If you expect strong maple flavor, you will be disappointed.  The maple syrup simply replaces sugar as the sweetener, but conveys a smooth texture that I find pleasing.

Alterations - I increased the amount of allspice to 1/4 teaspoon, and decreased the amount of brown sugar to 1/3 cup (the full amount of sugar suggested in the recipe along with 1/2 cup of maple syrup would yield an overly sweet pie.  I received comments at Thanksgiving that the pie was still a little on the sweet side).

When I process pumpkin, I usually use a neck pumpkin (looks like an overgrown butternut squash - widely available in central Pennsylvania, but I don't know how prolific they are in other areas).  I cut the pumpkin in half lengthwise, remove the seeds (bake these with butter and salt for a nice snack) and place it on a foil lined baking sheet, tent with another sheet of foil, and bake for 350 for 1.5 hours.  I remove the top sheet of foil and allow the pumkin halves to cool and scrape the pulp into a food processor to puree (I find working with the half pumpkins makes this step easy.  I then place the pureed pumpkin in cheesecloth in a container with a strainer bottom and place the purred pumpkin in the fridge for 3 days draining when liquid accumulates.  I find draining the pureed pumpkin yields a stronger flavor and better pie texture.

I'm on a kick this year, as much as possible, to cook from scratch out of produce from our garden, partly out of necessity, partly as a challenge to use resources that I can produce myself. One of the things that caught my eye on this recipe was the fact that it called for cooking your own pumpkin. I had several little sugar pumpkins sitting in a bin.... Excellent recipe that can easily handle substitutions according to taste and what one has on hand. I use molasses and brown sugar if I don't have maple syrup. I use whatever milk products I have - whether it's a mixture of half-n-half and milk, canned milk, or even watered-down heavy cream. It always turns out great. And definately a homemade crust. Yum, yum, yum! Thanks for sharing.

My roommates devoured this the second I let them. The only thing is that you have to let it sit overnight for all the pumpkin filling to set. Delicious!

Great recipe idea.  I agree with other reviewers that the maple flavor gets lost, so I did the following:

Changed from flour to 1 1/2 tsp corn starch
Increased Maple syrup to 1 cup
Reduced Brown sugar to 1/3 cup

I mixed everything in the blender and just poured it straight into the pie crusts.  One dirty dish, and the pies were great.  You could smell the maple while they were cooking, and definitely taste it when they were done.  Not too sweet, either.

I followed the recipe exactly and thought it was superb.  I had made a pumpkin pie with maple a few years ago and couldn't find the recipe.  This looked similar so I tried it and will keep this one.  The maple complements the pumpkin perfectly.  I did have to cook mine quite a bit longer than the recipe called for - not sure if that's because of my confection oven but I just kept an eye on it and it turned out great.  This will be a Thanksgiving tradition.

Fabulous!  I took this pie to a Thanksgiving dinner at the home of my best friend, who is a very discriminating cook.  She had to admit it was the best pumpkin pie she had ever tasted!  I have made pumpkin pies all my life, using varying recipes, but this one is really something special.

This is a delicious pie!  Know that it is definitely a lighter and more custardy pumpkin pie than you might expect.  As written it is far too sweet for our taste, but with the brown sugar cut to 1/2 cup it is perfect!

Also, a note for those using fresh eggs.  I was using eggs straight from our chickens and no matter how much I beat the eggs, egg pieces were still rising to the top of the pie during baking.  I finally figured it out and got rid of that problem by straining the eggs through a mesh sieve before beating them into the mixture.  Problem solved!  The whites of fresh eggs are just so much firmer.  Really lovely pie!

Really great pie!  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and it tasted wonderful.  The recipe says to preheat to 375 degrees but at the bottom says to bake at 350 degrees.  I opted for 350 for an hour.

Although this pie is delicious I don't think I'll make it again. You can't taste the maple syrup in it - so why waste maple syrup? It's too expensive!! I'll use a different recipe for pumpkin pie and just drizzle the maple syrup over the pie or put maple syrup in the whipping cream when serving to get the maple taste.

My mother & I made this for Christmas, thinking it would be a nice change from the standard Thanksgiving pumpkin pie made with the recipe off the back of the Libby's can. Other than the darker color due to the tasty grade B real maple syrup, you couldn't really tell a difference (kind of a waste of good maple). Guess I'll just stick with the classics.

this was a great pie.  i needed to keep the filling dairy free so i used Coconut milk instead of the half and half.  It was great, there wasn't a strong coconut flavor, it still seemed like a classic pumpkin pie.  my guests loved it.  Personally, i always think pumpkin pie needs more crust (the best part of a pie!) so i cut out some leaves with extra pie crust and decorated the top of the pie.  Very pretty!

I didn't have access to a sugar pumpkin, so just used canned pumpkin (1can = 2c).  I also subbed 1/4c of the milk with 1/4c of eggnog, just for the fun of it.  I loved the combination of flavors with the spices, the subtle eggnog flavor, but I think the brown sugar and the maple syrup are the keys to the great outcome.  Thanks, Carole!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  The maple syrup really adds great flavor.  I did use canned pumpkin to save time but it still turned out great, of course everyone asked for the recipe at the end of the night.  Thanks~

My family raved about this pie when I served it for Thanksgiving.  I got two 9" pies, Like another reviewer, but I think it' because the frozen pie crusts I used were so shallow. A deep dish pie would probably only make one.  The pie was very rich and very tasty.  My family loves real maple syrup, so thought this was great.

I loved this recipe! It is so much better than the typical pumpkin pie. I differentiated it from the normal pumpkin pie by decorating it with a few maple leaves made out of pie crust. I had to add them after the pie had solidified a bit in the oven or they would have just sunk right in.
The only change that I made was cheating and using canned pumpkin like some other reviewers suggested. Since I was making 7-8 different types of pies, this really sped up the baking process!  It was still delicious, and I would highly recommend this
recipe.

Great pumpkin pie. Instead of bothering with making my own pumpkin puree, I used canned.  Tasted just fine! Loved the subtle hints of maple in the aftertaste!

This is wonderful! Thank you so much for this recipe. I've often wondered how we all got along before sweetened condensed milk. Don't change a thing in this recipe.  At least not till you bake as is.  The Maple Syrup is not overpowering, it just adds this little something extra that is so perfect.  My favorite pumpkin pie to date - and I've eaten and made MANY!!!  Thank you.

While the pie was good, it takes a lot of maple syrup with little difference added to the flavour. For the extra money for just a touch more flavour, I'd rather just stick to an original.

With this pie, you have to be prepared that it's not going to have a maple flavour- it's not supposed to. The syrup just gives it a nice sweetness that works perfectly with fresh pumpkin. It got rave reviews the last 2 years as 'the best pumpkin pie ever' and I don't feel the need to try any other recipes- this one is awesome.

My first real pumpkin pie that worked! This is a great recipe. I love maple syrup, but I did not think the taste was very strong--I used some 'real maple syrup' from one of the local apple orchards. Maybe next time I could add just a little maple extract. Anyway, great recipe, thanks! Oh, I used Never Never Fail Pie Pastry from this site for the crust.

I feel bad giving this 3 stars because it has the potential to be the best pumpkin pie ever. But, as the recipe is written, it's just too sweet. Next time I make it, I will reduce the brown sugar to 1/3 cup. I made this the night before Thanksgiving after reading all of the rave reviews; I had some extra filling left over, so I baked it in a pyrex dish. After it cooled and I tasted it, I realized it was waaaay to sweet to serve and wound up making another pie (using a different recipe) the next morning. On the up side, the mix of spices is wonderful; combined with the maple syrup, this is definitely not your average pumpkin pie. Just cut back on the sugar unless you like things very very sweet.

WOW! This is the recipe I used to make good use of all the pumpkin meat leftover from our jack-o-lanterns! I increased the pumpkin to 2 cups and substituted honey for the maple syrup (I didn't have any). I also used All Recipe's Pie Crust IV to make the perfect flakey crust for this recipe. Terrific combination. It came out beautifully.  I have more pumpkin frozen in the freezer and plan to make this again for Thanksgiving. Delicious!

We loved it SO much that we made another one the next day! YUMMY! Thanks for sharing!  I did use the canned pumpkin and it was fine!!!  I also had to cook it about another 10-12 minutes longer than the recipe called for - not a problem and worth the extra minutes!  My grandmother even loved it more than her own!  WHOOOHOOO!

This pie rocks, I made my first one last year for a dinner party in early November and made four more before New Years.  This season I'll be making about 15 and giving them as gifts.  Thank You Carole!

I made this pie as part of my marathon pre-baking session to get as much of my Thanksgiving dinner done and frozen before hand surgery the week before Turkey Day and when I saw it listed as part of All Recipes' make-ahead menus I gave it a try. I was most concerned about whether to pre-bake or not as I only had experience with pre-freezing apple pies, not pumpkin. I checked around online and ascertained that in order to have success I should prepare and bake this pie as per the instructions in recipe then cool completely. Once completely cool I wrapped it well in plastic, then in foil then froze. It is essential that this pie not be frozen with any seafood or it will develop a seafood odor and taste. I took my pie out of the freezer on Monday night and began thawing it in the refrigerator for Thursday's dinner. It is essential to thaw the pie in the refrigerator and not at room temperature as at room temperature condensation will form on the outside of your pie (much like that which forms on the outside of a glass of ice water when it hits room temperature) and your crust will absorb this condensation and become soggy. If you thaw the pie in the fridge' no condensation forms hence no soggy crust. 
This pie was delicious and received rave reviews from my guests who were amazed it had spent a few weeks in deep freeze!

Best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted! I would go for a homemade crust next time though... and yes I bought the real maple syrup...too afraid to try something else because it tasted SO good!

This is a wonderful pumpkin pie. I made it exactly as stated in the recipe, except without allspice (could not find it in Germany) and used condensed milk instead of half-and-half (again, couldn't find it in Germany). It tasted excellent, and looks fantastic as well. My only complaint is that I wish I could have tasted more of the maple syrup. I made it with the Flaky Butter Crust from this site, as well as whipped cream sweetened with maple syrup. Everyone loved it.

I made this for Thanksgiving especially for my dtr-in-law as she loves maple flavored sweets. This had a weird taste and was just not good. Even she did not like it. I will not be making this again.

I read other reviews and took the advice of using 1/2c. brown sugar and I used canned pumpkin and everyone LOVED this pie! It was my first time using real maple syrup as a sweetener and it went over so well! A new staple!

Wow! This pie tasted great! I made this pie last weekend and it was my first time making or even tasting pumpkin pie. I made everything from scratch.  Because it's impossible to find pumpkin puree where I live (Belgium), I was forced to make it myself. From one small pumpkin, I yielded about 4 cups of puree.  I followed the recipe as written, but it took me a whole lot longer to make than 2Hrs and 30min. My pumpkin had to bake for approx. 2Hrs at 375, eventhough it was cubed. (It took me another 30min before I could bake the pumpkin, due to poor knife skills when handling a whole pumpkin.) For the pie crust I used the No Fail pie crust recipe III from this site.  After baking I chilled it overnight, but I was too curious and ate a piece after 3Hrs of chilling. Let me tell you, it was worth the work. The taste is rich and incredible. The maple syrup really complements the pumpkin flavor. A comforting thought is that I now have some pumpkin puree left for the next pie.  Thank you for such an amazing recipe!

This is the best pumpkin pie ever!  I have been making it every year for Thanksgiving for five years, (and a few Christmases, by request)  My husband and his grandfather usually don't eat pumpkin pie, but they eat this one!  I use canned pumpkin for it and it always turns out fine, next year I think I will try using a real pumpkin.  I really think the maple syrup is what gives it the great flavor.

This is the best pumpkin pie I've made.  Last year I made this and a "normal" pumpkin pie.  This one was gone in a flash while the other one had leftovers.  This year, my mom said "I can't believe I had to wait 52 years to taste a perfect pumpkin pie!"... she obviously loved it!  I've had only good reviews.  Thank you!

A great recipe!
I was worried because I had never made a pumpkin pie before and when I poured the mixture into the tin it looked REALLY watery.  It baked up perfectly though, and tastes delicious!

This is the best pumpkin pie I have ever made or eaten.  I used canned pumpkin and 1/2 teaspoon of Cardamon instead of ginger as I didn't have ginger. Everyone raved about this pie.  I think the Maple syrup and half and half make the taste so wonderful.

WOW, this is a fantastic pie.  I didn't need to change anything - I made 2 pies and they were gone in less than 10 minutes at a family gathering.  Thanks so much for the great recipe.

My seven-year-old daughter and I made this exactly as it stated except we divided the pie into two shells and reduced the cooking time to about 35 minutes (I think.)  It was the best pumpkin pie we'd ever eaten (and I've eaten quite a few.)  The maple flavor was present but not overwhelming and complemented the other spices.  I may try it next year with fresh pumpkin, but it is wonderful with canned pumpkin.

The best pumpkin pie I've had yet. Followed the recipe exactly as written, only next time I will cut back on the sugar as it was a little to sweet for my taste, but other than that it was perfect. Thank you so much for this recipe.

This is awesome!!!  I made the recipe as stated (well, except I did use canned pumpkin).  Well, I also changed the baking temp/time...did 15 minutes at 425 degrees and then reduced oven to 350 degrees and baked for another 40-45 minutes.  Couldn't wait to try it and when it had cooled for about 20 minutes, I cut into it.  It was soft and dreamy/creamy in the center (even though a toothpick placed in the center came out clean) but not soupy as one other reviewer mentioned.  The taste was simply devine!  Loved the maple syrup taste!!  Will make this again, but will reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup...the maple syrup alone might be enough to sweeten the pie and may try that next time.  I prefer a less sweet pie, regardless of pumpkin, fruit, etc.  Folks....ya just gotta try this!

Great recipe.  Thanks for posting one with REAL pumpkin.  It was the first time I made a pie with real pumpkin and it turned out well.  Followed the recipe as written.  It turned out a little less-firm than I usually like, but it tasted great, esp. with a little whip cream!

My sister is the pie maker in the family and this is hands down the best pumpkin pie any of us have had. We always use the canned pumpkin bc it is just easier that way. This is now the family recipe and we will never go back! She also brings this to all of our church potlucks and everyone is hooked :)

Its a good pie, but too sweet.  I should have read more of the reviews and cut down on the brown sugar.  I'm also not sure that using the maple syrup which is very expensive is really worth it.  I eliminated the cloves and allspice since I don't like either one.  The pie has a nice texture and flavor, but I don't consider it the ultimate pumpkin pie.

I was super excited to make this pie, but it ended up not being the right pie for our family.  It was very sweet, if I made it again I would cut the brown sugar at least down to 1/2 cup.  The texture was the biggest thing my family had a problem with.  It was too creamy?  Soggy?  The texture was a little better the 2nd day, but I think we prefer our pumpkin pies to be a little firmer.  I hate to admit it, but I think the one on the Libby can is still my favorite recipe. . .maybe I can do something with it and maple syrup to get what I'm looking for.

I was slightly disappointed in this pie.  After reading many of the reviews, I expected to eat the entire pie non-stop.  Luckily for my rear end, I didn't because I lost interest after the first few bites.  I made as is (no mods) and found the spices to be a little much.  I didn't taste the maple until after I was done eating!  I will try this again and back off the spices.

It didn't seem firm enough.  I baked an exrta 15 minutes since I doubled the recipe, but it was slightly mushy.  Flavor was good tho.  I will have to play with this if I make it again.

Wow! I love this pie! I made it exactly as written...I did double it, and it successfully filled 2 10" deep dish pies.  They did take longer to cook, obviously. Will make again for sure!

Nice pumpkin pie recipe- definitely "vintage" tasting.  Very, very sweet- some may prefer to reduce the brown sugar to 1/2 cup or even less.  The nutmeg flavor is also very strong, so some may prefer to reduce it to 1/2 teaspoon.  Also, don't worry that the filling is liquidy when mixed- it will set once it's cooked.

Everyone said it was the best pumpkin pie they've had so I'll make it again for sure! (when I can find the four hours to do so)
I like it spicy so I added double of the spices and it turned out just right.

This recipe is amazing! 
I don't eat eggs so I replaced the eggs with 4 Tbls of cornstarch. It worked great and the texture was perfect. The mixture from the filling looked very liquidy...but it turned out!

This is a fantastic recipe. I followed it to the letter and it turned out so well, I will never alter it!  I even went a little overboard and bought 100% pure Vermont maple syrup (which in Seattle, is a bit pricey). The results were delightful. 

My family traditionally makes a pumpkin pie on Halloween every year. I made mine Oct 30 and I had to make another one on the 31st because my household ate it all!

Thanks for a top notch recipe!

This was the first time I made pumpkin pie.  I have had several pumpkin pies before, this was definetly the best.  I substituted the half and half with same quantity of evaporated milk.  It came out great, I am planning to make it for thanksgiving. Thanks for the recipe.

This is a scrumptious pumpkin pie recipe! I will never again make a pie with canned pumpkin! And baking with fresh pumpkin is so much easier than I expected! I love the nice texture and the addition of the maple syrup makes this recipe stand above the rest! This will be a permanent fixture on my Thanksgiving menu! Many thanks!

Cheers to you! This is the best. I did like others suggested and decreased the sugar which was a good move because it was perfect! The first time I made this I accidentally put 1 tsp of clove in it (definitely learned my lesson) and it was incredibly strong! But the second time? Oh baby did it disappear fast! Hooray for an excellent recipe!

I appreciate the 'Canadian' essence of the maple flavour in it. Although I've been surprised by the wet consistency of the filling, it has always come out perfectly for me. This is the only recipe I've ever used. I've even used field pumpkins (couldn't get cooking pumpkins until this year) and had great results. So don't be afraid to cook up that jack-o-lantern next year. My British guests are consistently pleasantly surprised by how good my pumpkin pie is; they don't even consider pumpkins to be edible.

Everyone in my family had seconds of this pie on Thanksgiving!   I cut down the sugar and used a little less cream (like other reviewers suggested) and used just a touch more ginger.  It came out beautifully!  Not over-sweet like the usual pumpkin pies.  It is a great recipe--thanks so much!

I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't really taste the maple syrup. That being said, however, my nephew announced the pie was the best dish Thanksgiving day, and that he was a true devotee and expert taster of pumpkin pies.

I chose this recipe because I thought maple and pumpkin would really compliment each other, and I sure wasn't wrong!  This pie was just voted best dessert at my family dinner!  I made the filling per the recipe but made a home-made pie crust using chopped gingersnap cookies, pecans, crushed graham crackers, and butter...not a single piece leftover!

I tested this recipe before making it for our Thanksgiving gathering. I loved it the way it is written (except for using canned pumpkin), but based upon a lot of feedback from others, I reduced both the ginger and nutmeg to 1/2 t. and reduced the brown sugar to 1/2 cup. With those minor adjustments, most people who tried it on Thanksgiving said it was the best pumpkin pie ever! Thanks!

This was a really great recipe.I made a few adjustments though... I didn't have allspice or cloves, i also didn't have any half and half, so I used some of my left over cheese cake filling (from [Best No-Bake Cheesecake]) and some whole milk. I also only had 1/3 cup of maple syrup, so i substituted the rest of it with 1/3 cup of brown sugar a little bit of water and vanilla extract (plus i added some honey). For the crust I used [Pie Crust V] (in that crust recipe it said to cook it, but i only cooked part way and then added the pumpkin mixture)

All in All, it is a great recipe. i and everyone else loved it. ='.'=

ok I loved the taste of this, but I had a problem. The pie refused to set. I followed the ingredients to a t but i used canned pumpkin. I cooked it and it wasnt set so i kept cooking it until the crust started getting too brown. I put it in the fridge but the middle wouldnt set. We ate it with a mushy middle.

I used canned pumpkin. This is full of spices, and I couldn't really taste maple. The texture was a little lighter than I prefer. I had to cook it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. Also don't like the look of the dark specks - spices clumping maybe? Haven't had that happen with other pumpkin pie recipes. I would go for a quicker/easier recipe next time.

This is the absolute best recipe for fresh pumpkin. I sprinkled a layer of crushed ginger snaps on bottom of pie crust, and it was so good it barely lasted a day in our house!

My family really enjoyed this pie. I thought it was a little heavy on the ginger, but my husband loved all the spices. He said it was so much better than a bland store-bought pie! The maple flavor was subtle enough to add something different but did not overpower the pumpkin flavor. Very nice recipe!

I've made this pie several years now. Most people who eat it say it's the best pumpkin pie they've ever eaten! I usually use butternut sqaush, but have also used red kuri. The only sub I make is using cardamom instead of nutmeg, just because my mom doesn't care for nutmeg.

love this recipe. the pumpkin I used made two cups of puree and two pies. I cut my pumpkin into slices and put it in the instant pot for 15 minutes then peeled off the skin, mixed everything together and then pureed it to break down the eggs. I used 1/3 cup brown sugar with 3/4 cup maple syrup and that was perfect. instead of using half and half I used whipping cream and used the remainder to make maple sweetened whipping cream. I didn't use any all spice or ground cloves because I didn't have any. another user mentioned that the pie is watery when it comes out, I don't think so! you can eat it right away if you let it stand for ten minutes.

I was hoping for a rich yummy pumpkin pie. It might have been the organic pumpkin I used but we did not care for this at all. Fortunately we are all watching our sugar intake so didn’t care too much tossing it in the trash.

This is the best pumpkin pie recipe I have made (and I've tried a lot of different ones). The only change I made was reducing the brown sugar to 1/2 cup, and it was plenty sweet. I stuck with the fresh pumpkin (I always use fresh pumpkin, I just cook one big one up in early Nov and put the mush in the freezer for the season). Can't recommend this highly enough!

This pie tastes so much better than the ones made with canned milk! The taste of this pie is delicate, and you don't need to top it with whipped cream. I did use canned pumpkin and real maple syrup. Will be making this pie every Thanksgiving from now on.

I've made this several times as is over the past couple years. I love it. 
Recently I made it with canned pumpkin and reduced brown sugar. It tinged green after sitting overnight. Any ideas what could have caused it or how to prevent it?

I am not the hugest fan of pumpkin pie, but THIS pumpkin is now my favorite kind of pie!   Between my apple pie , which had rave reviews, and the pumpkin exceeded my expectations! I used homemade pastry and canned pumpkin (1 small can) and 1/4 tsp cardamom and vanilla. This filling makes 2 pies so have 3 pie crusts ready. Freezes well once baked.

Really good, but I recommend you do not do it in the mini pre-made pie shells ( a.k.a. tart shells ) because they had no sign of doneness or way of signifying that they were done ??

Yes!
 I subbed some cream with 2% milk and also used a glug of molasses instead of brown sugar. Although I cut a little of the maple syrup and sugar it was a bit sweet.

I've made this for the last three Thanksgivings. I love the way it tastes, but I must be doing something wrong: it takes forever to bake. It seems too liquidy.

Just had a slice (for breakfast ) as I made this late last night. So delish! I did make some minor changes, used  2-1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the ginger cloves nutmeg allspice, as that is what I had. Also used Evaporated milk instead of cream as that is what I had on hand.  Also I doubled the recipe and used 9" deep dish store bought pie shells and there was too much filling for them, so luckily I had another package and and put the excess in a third shell and had an almost  full extra pie, which is why I could have a slice for breakfast, yay! So I think you could actually get  3 - 9 inch pies out of doubling  this recipe, as the first two were really full to the edge with the filling. Preheated oven to 375 , put pies in and turned heat down to 350, baked for 1 hour and 5 minutes.
Update: Served at thanksgiving this weekend, and received many compliments on the rich flavour. Hubby whos been tasting my pies for years said it was the best pumpkin pie I've made.

The caterers I work for wanted pumpkin maple pie in mini pie pans to sell at a Fall Fest they attended.  They came out great!!  I did omit the spices and instead used 4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, but that worked out well.  Used canned pumpkin too, but I will make it with my fresh pumpkin soon, here at home!

I used 1/2 cup brown sugar since it already seemed sweet.  I also topped with a maple syrup whip cream.  Finally, I did 2.5 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice instead of all the ground spices listed in recipe.

Friends loved it, and the 5 of us took down a whole pie.

Best pumpkin pie I've ever made. Used this as a base recipe modified by: used 1 can pumpkin puree, omit sugar, used 1 C maple syrup only, only 1 C half & half, add 1/4 C egg nog. Fresh whip topping with no added sugar. Delicious!

I reduced the brown sugar to a heaping 1/2 cup. I also slightly reduced ginger, clove, and alspice. Almost spot on, a little less clove still. My wife thought it was spot on. I'll never make another regular pumpkin pie again!

Fantastic recipe! I live in New Zealand so I needed a recipe that used fresh pumpkin. This was easy to make and delicious! I cut the brown sugar down to 1/2 cup and cut out the ginger (only because I'm not a huge fan). Everyone loved it and was very impressed with the complexity of the flavours! I'll definitely be making this one again!

This pie was delicious.  My only substitution was to cut the brown sugar back to 1/3 cup. (Once I was out of cream and had to substitute 1 cup sour cream and 1/4 cream cheese and it still turned out yummy).

We really like this pie, it comes out great every time, and it is nice to use ingredients that are more natural. I have made it with gluten free crust, too. I'm still looking for a really great gf pie crust, though.

Without a doubt the best pumpkin pie I have ever made (and I've made more than my fair share).  I have been on the search for a great pie - and this is IT!  I did decrease both maple syrup and brown sugar by 1/4 cup because of other reviews of to much sweet; and I had to use canned pumpkin.  (Can't wait to try it with fresh!)  This pie held together remarkably well, with very nice texture.  I made another pumpkin as well, and it was... meh.  This one was fantastic!

Perfect blend of spices with maple syrup! Made two pies and brought one to the office where I work and my co-workers absolutely LOVED it! One of them mentioned that it would probably go well with a glass of wine so I'll have to try that at some point. I actually made the filling completely to the details of this recipe. Got a sugar pumpkin and made the puree myself and I was stoked to see that we had all the spices already in stock in our spice cabinet at home, as well as real maple syrup. I doubled the recipe so I still have pie filling left over to make more pies for Thanksgiving since we have several family members coming over.

This is such a great pumpkin pie recipe! Like most of the reviewers, I only had canned pumpkin, BUT I only used 1/4 cup of brown sugar (instead if 3/4 cups, which would have been way too sweet for me)! I'm still rating this a full 5 stars, because other than that, the recipe is AMAZING, and I suppose the amount of sugar could be different if you make this with a fresh pumpkin. Be sure to make this with pure maple syrup!

As always, I made a few changes for funsies. I nixed the brown sugar entirely and left the maple syrup as is, though this may not work if you use canned pumpkin as it can be bitter. I make my own pumpkin puree on a regular basis with the large carving pumpkins and used that instead of the usual "sugar" pumpkin. They are lovely sweet pumpkins and lend a lot to the flavour profile. The texture and sweetness is perfection. I also made my own crust from scratch, which really made this the BEST PUMPKIN PIE EVER!

I changed some of the ingredient to make this dairy-free. I used one 14oz can of Coconut Cream in place of the half-and-half. I also used 1/2 tbsp Pumpkin Pie Spice in place of the spices. It was delicious and everyone loved it, but it was a bit on the sweet side -didn't need any whip cream!

Was a little heavy on the spice for me...I cut the ginger nutmeg and cloves in half. Love the maple though.

I hate to be one who does not give this pie a glowing review. However when I made this recently for the holidays, no one was excited about this pie.  Although the consistencey was about right.  Not one of about six people who ate it could taste the maple syrup.  I put the perscribed amount of syrup in the pie, but our tastebuds could not distinguish it.  I am still searching for a better maple pumpkin pie.

Super easy and not too overly sweet, this recipe was a hit with my guests. I used the Never Fail Pie Crust II from Mary Roahrig with it. I'd definitely use this recipe again.

Pumpkin+maple syrup = perfect pie! This recipe is worth the time and effort. I have 2 young children that won't eat pie, but, asked for seconds with this one. Truely impressive. I forgot the flour and used half cup whipping cream and 3/4 cup half and half instead because thats what I had.

following advice i reduced the sugar to a loosely packed half cup but found it could have been sweeter... but then i used a 'field' pumpkin (a Queensland Blue which is usually used for roasting in Australia) so that may have needed sweetening up. As Half and Half is not available in Australia i used half milk and half cream but next time i will reduce the quantity to 250ml in total as mine came out a little soggier than i think it should be. The spice mix was perfect. Also agree that the egg should be well beaten before adding.

I love pumpkin pie to begin with, and this pie is, indeed, the best of all!  We make our own maple syrup, so I am always looking for good recipes using it.  I made it for Thanksgiving a couple of years ago, and have been making it ever since.  Certain members of my family (who shall remain nameless-ha,ha) like it even better than Mom's recipe!  I always change recipes a little (or a lot) to suite our taste, but this one is just perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This pie was sensational!  It has a wonderfully light custard quality... ate the last piece today (six days after Thanksgiving) and it was wonderful!  I mistakenly baked it at 375 degrees... and the top bubbled and carmelized adding a nice crunchy coating on the top... this will now be the only way I'll make pumpkin pie!

I served this at Thanksgiving dinner.  It is interesting, people who normally love pumpkin pie were so-so with it, but some people who don't normally eat pumpkin loved it.  I made as is and decided to try it with a graham cracker crust (I ran out of time to make a regular pie crust).  It was not quite as heavy as other pumpkin pies I've made, which I really liked.  Next time I will try it with some of the modifications others have listed too just to compare.

Very good, but it definitely can stand to have the sugar cut. I used a half cup of brown sugar and it was still a little too sweet for my taste. Next time I think I'll just use the maple syrup. 
Also I didn't mix the eggs in enough and it came out with little baked egg pieces: an electric mixer (or whipping the eggs before adding them to the mix) is recommended!
Another little idea: I used a graham-cracker crust and it turned out great! Fit very well with the cinnamon and ginger flavors.

Great recipe!  Everyone enjoyed it.  Just be sure to remove as much liquid from your pumpkin.  My first attempt was a little spongy in texture in some spots.

The pie was very very good.  Not the best I have ever had, but still quite good. I did take the advice of other reviewers and cut down on the sugar.
Also, as other reviewers mentioned, I could not taste the maple syrup. The best this about this pie was the good balance of spices and the texture.

This pie turned out very well, but I agree with previous reviewers that the maple flavor was not as prominent as hoped. However, I still had a very difficult time not eating all of the batter before adding the eggs, and will definitely be looking for a way to add more maple next year!

I've made this several times now.  Personally, I love the flavor, but it is a little on the spicier side for most of my friends.  The bake time needs to be about 10-15 minutes longer than indicated here or it won't set up properly.
