Right now, these are in my freezer. I'm rating these before they are done...I know I know. But with the results I'm having before they are completely set are worth it. I followed to a T, but when grabbing the lemon juice out, I mistakingly grabbed the lime...Not realizing it until after I had mixed in. But I'm not complaining. This in the state it's at right now, is like a mild non-alcoholic margarita. It's delish. I could just drink it verses freezing it. It's that nice. Now I can't wait to have these frozen. I did make designer ice cubes using a decorative silicone mold but only did one tray that way, I poured the rest into popsicle molds to eat like a pop. The color and easy of this recipe is quite nice. It's a winner for the summer's heat in Oklahoma! 5* recipe for sure!

I used the recipe first as a fruit salad for lunch.  Then blended the leftovers and put into leftover cleaned and dried egg cartons...Made yummy ice cubes for drinks....
