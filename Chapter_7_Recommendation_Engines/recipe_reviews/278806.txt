This was delicious. I used gluten free panko. Its unclear how the rolling is supposed to work - I put the two halves back together after the cheese and ham and then rolled the breast. This is quite difficult as there's just too much there to roll. I don't see how rolling the open butterflied chicken breasts would work. Still, its delicious. I used Jarlsberg cheese.

I used this recipe as a starting point.  I swapped pounded/seasoned tenders and thighs out for the breasts; pre-cooked bacon for the ham; peppered colby-jack for the swiss; rolled in egg and parmesan/ coconut flour to keep it keto friendly; and instead of mustard inside, I  made a honey, spicy mustard, mayo, sour cream dressing to put over it after air-frying. Served with a salad with the same dressing. It was tender, juicy, flavorful, and slightly crispy outside. It was a huge hit!

I seldom review a recipe, but this one is truly 5 star. My only change was to use Italian bread crumbs instead of panko. The chicken was moist and and flavorful.   Fantastic.

I pounded my chicken to make it easier to handle. Added smoked Gouda and prosciutto. Took closer to 35 minutes for the inner chicken was still raw at 20 minutes. Pretty standard recipe.

Would add more spice and use cheddar cheese but well worth it.
