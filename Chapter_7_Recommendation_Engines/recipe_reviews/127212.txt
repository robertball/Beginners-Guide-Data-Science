I was disappointed with this recipe, maybe it was user error.  The oil and sugar separated despite having stirred it contantly to combine and not burn the sugar, so instead of pouring the separated mess over the seeds I grabbed a paper towel and soaked up the unwanted oil and poured the rest over the seeds.  I think it needs salt and the chili powder is so miniscule it's not spicy at all, either the amount of chili powder needs to be increased or use cayenne pepper instead of chili powder (if I make this again I think I'd rather use cayenne).  Overall it was fun to try something new.

I added 1/2 teaspoon of salt into the spice mix, and these came out great. The spice isn't too strong for me, but enough to be a nice change from plain salted pumpkin seeds. With the salt added, it's a nice balance of sweet, salty, and spicy.

I made these for my daughter/hubby while up in Portland on Halloween.   Everyone loved them!  But I mistakenly didn't pour the seeds into a bowl prior to adding the "sweet & spice".  I kept them on a cookie and the mixture only stuck to a small portion of the seeds.  Next time I'll put them in a bowl!

I also had problems with the sugar and oil separating. I used white pepper instead of chili or cayenne and it was sufficiently spicy. The spices didn't stick as well as I had hoped, but I did get a good mix of sweet and spicy on the ones the spices did stick to. I think I will try increasing the oil next time. It was delicious, just needs some tinkering.

This was a good recipe, although I used butter instead of "oil" and you have to be a little patient when melting sugar as to not burn it. I also added more chili powder and a little salt and these came out nice!

I LOVED this recipe!!! I've tried a few for pumpkin seeds, this is hands down the best. Every friend & family member who tried it said it was incredible. I did, however, use a LOT more of the seasonings than it called for-I used tons of seeds and made the mxiture double of the powder. It is really good, you won't be disappointed!

Same problem as the other reviewers: my oil and sugar mix separated.  I just poured all of it over the pumpkin seeds, but was disappointed with how the sugar (now caramel) made clumps of some of the seeds and didn't seem to coat most of the others.  I think the problem was that my seeds had cooled so this recipe should note that the seeds have to be hot or warm, probably straight out of the oven, to stop the caramel from clumping when poured on them.  Also, the seeds didn't seem very spicy with the chili powder so I added cayenne to the batch to make it a little hotter (per another reviewer's suggestion).  Overall, this recipe has potential, but is woefully incomplete or incorrect as is.

I was so disappointed with this recipe. I found as well that the sugar and oil seperated and when I finally got the sugar to melt (into a caramel-ish consistency) you have to work really fast before it hardens. I had to keep microwaving the pumpkin seeds to melt the caramel in order to coat all of the seeds. There is potential with this recipe, but I would definatly start off with a small batch of seeds, rather than use all that you have and waste them.

I am not so familiar with carmelizing and dissolving sugar in oil.  How I did it took a long time.  Maybe too low of heat??  Also the mixture solidified quite quickly which I was not prepared for.  Ratio of sugar to oil could be greater than 1 to 1.  There was quite a bit of oil left.  I used some cayenne and a chipotle chili powder in addition to chili powder.  The taste is very good.  People have compared it to the candied almonds with a kick.  If I made this on a regular basis I would be much better the next time around.  I think I might forget all I have learned by next year.

I have made this recipe several times, and have had the sugar separate from the oil at times.  If you keep stirring it begins to slowly melt and turns into carmel.  I doubled the amount of sugar and oil so we would have enough carmel to spoon over the seeds.  It helps to have a second person sprinkle the spices over the seeds while you are spooning the carmel and turning the seeds to coat them well. Our family looks forward to this treat every year.
