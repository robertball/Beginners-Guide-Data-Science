Everyone at the party liked these. I've made these several different ways. My sister hates onions so I omitted the scallions for a few and my dad hates cream cheese so I swapped hummus in for those. Everyone else liked the recipe as is. Very versatile, very easy and quick.
Thanks

What's not to like. Can change recipe to suit own tastes. Just hadn't thought of a wrap with these ingredients before!

I've been looking for finger foods that aren't sugary, and don't need to be kept warm. This fits the bill. Easy, tasty and so easy to make... I made a couple exactly as written. For a bit of a kick, I made others with Philadelphia's Jalapeno cream cheese, and for the vegetarians, substituted the turkey with some chopped black and green olives with cilantro. They all disappeared.

I thought it was absolutely delicious. A refreshing but still filling platter that can very easily be the main-meal. LOL The only thing I changed is that I didn't include the scallions, and even then it was only because I couldn't find them at the grocery store. Odd.

Excellent  recipe......great as a light lunch just cut in half...or as appetizer cut in one inch pieces.     Always the first to go at a get together.  Add sliced black olives for more color and taste!

Not the best wrap I've had.  It was ok, but next time I'll just make my own combos.
