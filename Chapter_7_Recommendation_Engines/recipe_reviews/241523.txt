As flour-less Apple crisps go, this was very good. My Mother-in-law with Celiacs disease was able to enjoy it (made with gluten free oats) and on a gluten-free scale would give this five stars!  I omitted the honey and added more brown sugar and butter.

I had to make a few changes because I did not have any gf oats in the house but I had apples.  I used a combo of granny smith and honey crisp apples.  I ran cheerios through the food processor to get a similar consistency to oatmeal and used that in place of the oatmeal.  I cut the honey down to a quarter of cup because of this.  I used almost a tablespoon of cinnamon. I also baked it for an additional 15 minutes.  It came to amazing!  The crumble was so good!  I will make this again with oatmeal and my rating may change to 5 stars!

A delicious gluten free addition to brunch! Didn't have honey on hand so used molasses and corn syrup.

Really tasty, nice easy recipe.
The only modification I have made each time I make this is to toss the apple slices in a good coating of cinnamon as well. 
Last time I only did a touch of oil and more honey and it was a bit thicker, which was nice too.

It was a very tasty recipe though I would add a bit less brown sugar next time. That's just my personal preference. Worked great because my partner isn't supposed to eat any flour.
