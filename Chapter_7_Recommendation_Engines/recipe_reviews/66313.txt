Delicious!!! A few tips though-if possible it is best to have all your ingredients at room temp.(heat the jam up a little in the microwave to make sure there are no lumps) and melt the caramels first then add the chocolate and remaining ingredients. It makes a lot so be prepared to freeze some for another occasion.

I liked this recipe, but the sauce is really thick. I wound up adding a full cup of whipping cream and about 1 1/4 cups of jam to thin it out a little and it was still thick and creamy. It turned out delicious!

This sauce tasted GREAT! Although I didn't like how thick it was and it was VERY rich...I think next time I will try to thin it out a little.

I reduced the butter to 4T and it was still amazing.  May reduce to 2T next time.  Everyone that tried it loves it!

This is very rich and dark.  I served it warm over vanilla ice cream and everyone gobbled it up and proclaimed it delicious.  As someone else mentioned it's a good idea to melt the caramels first because they take awhile.  Very satisfying and lots of leftovers for a future treat!

Chocolate, caramel and raspberries?! How can you go wrong with such a combination? I made this sauce to go over vanilla pound cake slices and this makes a whole lot! I did not add in the whipping cream but instead just put in a bit of cream in my individual servings and reheat the sauce in the microwave. It only takes a couple seconds. Out of the fridge it is almost like a "type of truffle filling." Not rock hard but maybe fudge-like consistency. I think it would make a nice truffle filling rolled in some finely grated chocolate too. I love this recipe. Thanks!
