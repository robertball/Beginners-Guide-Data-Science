Very good!  One of the best mac & cheese recipes I've used.  My additions: 1/2 tsp. dry mustard, 1/4 tsp. pepper, and 1/2 tsp. salt.  The mustard adds a bit more flavor.  As for a floury taste if you cook the sauce until it is "just boiling" it will alleviate the problem (don't reduce the flour or it will never get thick).  Remove from heat and let set for a couple minutes before adding the cheese, this prevents the cheese from melting too hot and getting "grainy".  I'll make this over and over.  An update of my review:  Many reviewers are saying the sauce never ‘gets thick’.  It’s *not supposed* to “get thick”.  It will be a creamy-textured sauce when mixed with the macaroni.  It thickens and absorbs as it bakes in the oven.  When making the sauce, use the standard above: Bring it to “just boiling”, period.  That is the consistency it is supposed to be!  When you take the dish out of the oven it will be perfect! ****Another update**** This recipe just keeps getting “favorite-er and favorite-er”!  I’ve had a lot of company this summer and so as to stay out of the kitchen and visit I’m now using the crock-pot. (I triple the recipe and use several kinds of cheese. Omit the bacon for vegetarian guest and it’s still great.) Make the sauce the night before, let cool some, add the cheese, stir & refrigerate.  In the morning, cook the noodles, al dente, and mix with the sauce in the crock-pot. Cover and cook on low, about 5 hours, just in time for a late lunch.  Stir well before ser

OK, so I'll admit it's a little bland; so jazz it up the way you want!  The "flour taste" complaints are because you all don't let the roux cook long enough!  It's actually a pretty simple cooking technique that if you follow it, the sauce will thicken immediately.  Like the recipe says, add the milk SLOWLY!  To make it even easier, heat the milk slightly and then add it to the sauce.  Just don't add it all at once, the sauce will seize and become lumpy.  This is a great recipe for a basic sauce or one of the mother sauces called a Bechamel sauce or white sauce.  Once you master this sauce, you can master anything that is cream based, like mac & cheese or a chowder or cream soup....just be patient.    Good things come to those who wait!  :)

I'm giving this great recipe 5 stars, but I made it slightly differently. No bacon. I made caramelized onions, which tasted excellent in the dish so I recommend it for sure. The cheese sauce which is made from a roux needs to be modified. Once you have melted the butter, added the flour and then milk, you need to simmer the mixture over low heat for about 8-10 minutes & stir occasionally making sure it does not burn. This is to cook down the flour and make a nice paste. Then add the cheese, and some nutmeg always adds that extra perfect touch to cheese sauce. I also added some garlic powder and cayanne. I love this recipe and next time I will throw in some stewed tomatoes as well. Thank you for sharing!!

Well I hate to be in the minority but I won't be making this one again.  My husband is a purist and did not like the onions in his M&C.  There is a floury taste which surprised me.  Perhaps cornstarch would be a better thickener.  This will not be made in our house again :-(

There are 2 things you don't add a lot of onion to.  Pasta and seafood.  They are delicate and are overpowered. What you taste is onion, you don't get the wonderful taste of other ingredients.  When I get recipes with a lot of onions I replace with fresh chives to give a more delicate taste and flavor. This was overpowered with onions.

This was good. Even my husband who is not a fan of mac and cheese enjoyed this. The only thing I did was I sauteed the onions in a little bit of the bacon drippings and I added some pepper in step 3 otherwise great recipe.

I read the other reviews before making this and therefore put 3 whole cups of shredded cheese to help thicken and up the flavor of the sauce.  I also used SHARP cheddar, and thank heavens I did otherwise I think this would have been too bland.  I more than doubled the bacon, and used 11oz of large elbow macaroni.  Used the onion and garlic just as suggested, and used a sweet onion.  The sauce took FOREVER to thicken.  The bottom line was that with these modifications, I thought the flavor was fantastic.  My husband liked it too, but thought it wasn't different enough to warrant all the trouble, particularly the stirring time on the sauce.

Though this recipe was great for anyone making their first mac n cheese and the cookin instructions were good the recipe itself needed quite a bit of work. First of Im an onion lover and it was even too much for me. Half and onion is just the right amount.I added an extra cup on cheddar to the sauce aswell as a couple tsps of garlic salt. And topped it off by sprinkling 6 saltines mixed with a table spoon of melted butter on top.

I thought this was a great recipe and my boyfriend even enjoyed it for lunch the following couple of days.  I'm a little skiddish of too much onion, so I used one small yellow onion and it was perfect.  I also like to take short cuts, so instead of grating cheese I bought already shredded cheese and instead of cooking a couple slices of bacon I used 1 tbsp of Oscar Mayer Real Bacon Bits.  The bacon bits are awesome and can be used for so many things, I keep a bag in the fridge for just such recipes.  I heated about a tsp of olive oil in a pan and sauted the onion, garlic, and bacon bits all together.  I will certainly make this dish again.

My kids loved it!  Only gave it 4 stars because I tweaked the recipe a lot due to what I had on hand.  I left out the bacon and onion (bummer).  I used 2c cheddar and 1 c mozarella, and put fresh grated parmesan on top. I also added a little dry mustard and chili powder to the sauce.  My kids gobbled up and have requested I make it all the time.  Next time I'll add the bacon or maybe stir in some ricotta as I thought it was too dry (my own fault, I bet it's fine with the additional fat from the bacon and onion).    Just a note to those that might find the sauce gritty: Pre-shredded cheese usually has flour or some other starch on it to keep it from clumping in the bag (that's what gives the cheese the dusty look).  If using pre-shredded be sure to melt/stir the sauce long enough to not only melt the cheese but to fully blend that additional starch into the sauce.

I was looking for a simple, basic, but tasty Mac n Cheese recipe. I would have to say this is the one!  The recipe is excellent as it is, only made minor changes. One of the most critical, I think for taste was to use the same "cast iron ' pan through the whole process. From frying the bacon to cooking the onion and garlic, to making the roux. Then finally in the end adding the cooked pasta to the pan and then putting the same pan in the oven. I didn't measure exactly how much cheese I used, but it was probably at least a cup more!  Everyone loved it, even my non onion loving daughter had to take leftovers to school this morning!  This will be added to my recipe box !!

I added 3 cooked, cut up hot dogs to this and my kids went NUTS. They loved it! I didn't have penne, so I used tri-colored rotini I had. Added panko bread crumbs to the top at the end--perfect!

Very simple and super comforting. I did end up tripling the bacon and adding just a little more cheese in the "sauce" as we like our noodles SUPER cheesy. I also used elbow macaroni because that was all I had. It was hard to keep myself at one serving, this is total comfort food. There's just something about adding fresh onion and garlic to macaroni and cheese. NOTE: I do make this a little more personal with just a touch of dijon mustard and a little hot sauce.

This is a good basic recipe.  I do agree with an other reviewer that the basic roux definitely needs salt, pepper and dry mustard (1/2tsp) and needs to be cooked long enough to prevent the "floury" taste.  The reason you don't want the sauce to be too thick, is that you want the sauce to get inside the elbow or penne pasta.  The sauce will thicken as the M&C bakes in the oven.  Almost everything else is a matter of taste and you can adjust the amount of bacon, onion & garlic to your liking.  I prefer sharp cheddar, but any cheese will do.  Finally, I've been making baked M&C for about 45 years.  Before baking I spread a cup of cubed cheese over the top of the casserole along with cornflake crumbs and a little salt and pepper.  This makes a wonderful crust on the top.  Served with a side of stewed tomatoes and peanut butter muffins!!  Love it

Good, simple recipe.  My husband doesn't like homemade macaroni & cheese, but he enjoyed this.  I agree with a number of reviews that adding a few extras to zip up the flavor a bit is good.  I used ziti but will use elbow macaroni next time. I did not have mustard on hand but added some ground red pepper and increased to four strips of bacon, which still weren't noticeable enough for our tastes (so I will use six or even eight next time!). I did two cloves of garlic and will increase that to three. Also, I will increase the amount of butter to match the flour 3/3 (I have only ever read that it's equal amounts).  This was extremely dry and pasty in the pan and I could not cook it for the suggested two minutes for fear of burning the flour. I look forward to trying this again with the above-suggested alterations.

This recipe was the best mac&cheese recipe I have ever tried and I have tried many! I totally disagree with the reviews that said this was bland. The only change I made was to use a mix of colby, jack and mild cheddar.  I also sprinkled hot paprika over the top before baking.  Plenty of flavor, plenty of cheese. Perhaps some of the people who tried the recipe don't know how to make a roux.  The flour/butter/milk ratio was perfect-the garlic/onion flavor was just right.  Thank you.

This recipe, in my opinion, is 5 stars. And yes, I did alter it slightly, as I have to admit, I tend to do that based on my families preferences. I increased the pasta to 12oz, fried 6 pieces of bacon and then caramelized my onions in the bacon pan. I used all three cups of cheeses in my sauce and even added a little extra to the top before baking. Now here is where I really deviated! I took the spices from Chef Jonh's Mac and Cheese (from this site) and added them to my sauce. I also used his Panko topping as I prefer my Mac and cheese to have a crunchy topping.                                                                        The reason why I love this site is not only for the recipes but because of the reviews! Countless times in the past (from cookbooks) I have made recipes that never turned out....I have made dozens of recipes from this site and I can honestly say that there was only one that wasn't a hit, it was good, but not a 'wow I would make that again'. And the reason for my success (other than my stellar cooking/baking skills ;) is because I read the recipes over and then the reviews to see what has worked countless times for everyone. I see nothing wrong with altering a recipe as I believe that is what cooking/baking is all about! If it wasn't for the recipe submitter playing around with recipes, it wouldn't be here for us to enjoy. :)

I thought this recipe was great!  I will preface my review with the fact that I have never made macaroni from scratch before and am still learning a lot about cooking. As always, lots of previous reviews helped me.  Those along with my own suggestions: (1) use 3 cups cheese in the sauce, (2) mix up the cheeses - i did 2 cups sharp cheddar, 1 cup colby jack, and a little bit of both mixed with parmesan on top, (3) a light coating of bread crumbs under the top layer of cheese.  For my version, I used a whole 13.5 oz box of whole grain macaroni noodles and it was perfect.  I did not add the onions or bacon (working with limited time and a large group) but I did add cumin as suggested (and, as noted, couldn't taste it at all so I guess it was a good thing??). I had to google "roux" and was glad I did since mixing flour and water seemed a bit odd.  The sauce took longer than I anticipated.  I was unsure at what point the roux/milk mixture thickened but someone had noted that as soon as it thickens at all, it's done.  So, I went with that.  Will turn the stove up slightly above Low next time bc I think it was not hot enough (and therefore took longer).  I baked it for about 15 minutes but then covered it with foil for a bit longer.   I got A LOT of compliments (served it with slow cooker bbq pork and California Coleslaw which is from allrecipes too).  Will definitely be making this macaroni again --- so sad there were no leftovers!!!  Enjoy!

Any dish that messes up 5 pots/pans isn't one I am going to continue using. The bacon is a nice touch, tho.

I am SOO glad I decided to try this recipe!  I consider myself a connoisseur of mac n cheese and I give this one four stars.  It had humble beginnings in the pot at first but it turned out really great!  I didn't use bacon or an actual onion, but instead used onion powder (a few shakes).  Also, I baked it in a 9x13 baking dish since I don't yet have a 2-qt dish (newlyweds, go figure).  I only baked it for about 6 or 7 minutes because I was afraid it would dry out.  It turned out great!  Next time I think I'll add some swiss as well!

You can use three cups of any of your favorite cheese for the sauce, I have tried it with just cheddar, and a mix of regular or sharp cheddar, mozzerella, american, whatever you feel like. My husband raves about this mac and cheese. We both agree it is by far the best recipe we have ever found for mac and cheese. I even cheat and add more bacon. YUMMY! Thanks for the recipe!

As is, just as a lot of other reviewers said, this is a bland recipe.  Even using sharp cheddar, I thought it was a bit blah.  I added several more cloves of fresh garlic, lots of cajun spice, red onions, some lemon & pepper and that took care of the spiciness needed.  I also sprinkled some crumbled blue cheese (a little, depending on your taste) on top-- it added a nice bit of texture & flavor.  

For the flour taste, I used about 1/4 cup corn starch disolved in a half a cup of cold water. Use a little more if it's not thick enough. The cheese thickened almost instantly-- I really didn't have to stir for long at all.

Also, to get a veggie serving, and some color I added frozen peas & corn to the mix before baking, and if you're not a big bacon fan, substitute tuna.  

This is a great base for a home made macaroni.  If you're looking for the really intense flavor of the "box" style mac & cheese, this isn't it.  It is mellow, even with the spices, but it's got a home baked creaminess that you can't get with a mix.  Just add what you like and taste it before baking.  Go a little wild; you don't have to stick strictly to a recipe like this one.

I should have read the reviews before trying this recipe.  Very floury tasting.  Will not try this again.

I read the reviews before I decided to make this.  I understand the "flour" comments.  It's a texture thing but, in my opinion, doesn't detract from the favor.  This is a good recipe.  I followed another suggestion of sauteing the onions and garlic in the bacon drippings.  A few other alterations: 3/4c. of heavy cream +1 1/4c. of milk instead of 2c. of milk; 12 oz. of macaroni instead of 8 oz; 3c. of shredded mexican blend cheese in the sauce and 1c. of mild chedder for the top instead of 3c. of chedder total; and 1/2 a large onion rather than a whole onion; 3 slices of bacon instead of 2.  VERY good recipe.

I absolutely loved this. It is so creamy and rich. I may add a little more bacon next time. Also a great recipe to replace lobster for the bacon.

This recipe is great!  The bacon and onion add just a little kick that keeps it from being plain old mac and cheese.  I made it using an 8 oz block of Cabot extra sharp cheddar that I shredded myself.  Definitely a keeper in my book!

This was an amazing recipe, though I added more cheese than it called for and it was just barely enough to cover the pasta (perhaps i just cooked too much pasta? I'm not very precise about these things). I also added ground beef as well as the bacon. Loved it!

When making the roux you can also substitute the butter with bacon fat.  I save my bacon drippings in a mason jar in the freezer and use it all the time when cooking.  It works great in this dish since we are adding bacon anyway.

this was excellent. my boyfriend went back for thirds and his friend had seconds. it makes the perfect amount, and the leftovers are great too!  i made a few minor changes. im a vegetarian so i didnt use bacon at all. i sauteed onions and garlic in a little olive oil. for the cheese i added a little extra cheddar and also some mozzarella/provolone shredded cheese i had. i topped it with more cheese, then i crushed up some ritz crackers and multigrain club crackers and covered the top with those, and then put a layer of shredded parmesean over that. nice and crunchy!  the roux is really easy. if you're having trouble, use a wisk and add the milk by half cups. just wait for it to thicken, it will.  will make again and again!   *EDIT* finally got the perfect cheese blend. It's sharp cheddar, colby, and provolone in the sauce, and shredded parm on top. mmmmm!

This was awesome. I only changed it a little - I used 2 cups cheddar and 1 cup mozzarella. I sprinkled the top with italian breadcrumbs before baking.

Yummmy!  added a few things...browned 3/4pound of hamburger(omit the bacon) and seasoned with 1 tsp of taco seasoning (from this website), I added this to the cheese sauce along with and extra 1/4cup of parmesan cheese.  Oh ,I did increase the garlic to 3 cloves and the pasta was 12ounce of whole wheat. Verrry chessy...lots of sauce.  Both my children ate their entire dinner.... THAT never happens.  Thanx for the recipe.

Wow! This mac and cheese was really good! It is not your traditional mac and cheese but it is amazing! I didn't think this lacked flavor at all like some others said. I used only half of an onion, a little extra garlic and about 6 slices of bacon. I also used a blend of different cheeses. This was VERY good! My hubby and I both loved it!!

Both my boyfriend and I were excited to try this dish but were sorely disappointed. It just tasted like flour/extremely bland. Perhaps I did something wrong but I followed the recipe exactly except used vegan bacon bits because I'm vegetarian. I did not care for it.

I've tried a few different mac & cheese recipes and none have turned out just right. This one did, though! My husband, who much prefers the boxed version of this food, actually took two helpings. I already loved the taste, but seeing him go back for more when he usually won't even touch homemade mac & cheese really sold me on this recipe!  My changes: I added 1/4 teaspoon ground mustard, thanks to a reviewer's suggestion, and that turned the dish from really good to wonderful! I also only had two cups of cheddar so I added a cup of mixed american and mozzarella. Fantastic!!

I'm giving this 5 stars because the cheese sauce was fantastic! I'm anxious to try it on broccoli. I left out the bacon, onion, and garlic and used elbow macaroni instead of penne. This was going to be the beginning of my search for a good mac and cheese recipe, but my search has ended before it really began :) This is neither a typical baked mac and cheese nor the cheesy Kraft kind... it's somewhere in between. I absolutely love that this recipe does not use processed cheese, and it does not need it, in my opinion. If anyone is getting a flour taste, you're not cooking the roux long enough. It needs a full two minutes on medium low heat before you start adding the milk. And you need to really nurse the cheese mixture a bit... constantly stir it and *gradually* add the milk and then the cheese for best results. I went ahead and mixed all 3 cups of cheese into the cheese sauce and didn't bother adding any to the top. I baked the whole thing for 25-30 minutes. It tasted even better the next day. Thanks for the recipe!

I used the recipe for the cheese sauce to try to replicate my husbands grandmothers recipe.  I added half a packet of the powdered cheese sauce from the packaged mac n cheese in the store to this recipes cheese sauce.  His grandmother used that and it actually tasted good.  I used sharp cheddar cheese, as well, and layered everything in the casserole.  Then I carmelized onions, added whole peeled tomatoes and tomato sauce and let that simmer while the mac n cheese cooked in the oven.  Served with the tomato sauce on top and it was delicious- what a great comfort food!

I also thought this was really bland.  If I ever decided to make it again, I would definitely add more cheese and maybe use a different type of cheese.  It was a lot of work and a lot of dishes for mediocre macaroni!

We call this fancy mac and cheese.  The kids wont touch it.  I love it.  I don't like the onion in it, so we leave it out now.  I also use a combo of cheeses, cream cheese, colby, jack and cheedar.  I've made it with and without the bacon and I perfer without.

I used more bacon prob 5 slices and also tried it with chunks of ham ( at different times ). Less onion probably 1/2 big one.  2-3 cloves of garlic.  Awesome recipe !!  I have been looking for a great mac and cheese and this is it.  The white sauce ( which I was scared of making ) was so easy to make as long as you continue to stir with a wisk you wont get any lumps.  Last time I made this, there was one little bit left over for lunch the next day and we had a fight over who would get it !  Really really mmm mmm good ! Thanks.

This Recipe is Great! I'm a very experimental cook, and this recipe was a great starting point. It's extremely yummy as is but I've also modified the recipe in with great success. Definitely make sure the flour is fully cooked.
Some suggestions:
Doubled the pasta (this makes a drier version, but still tasty), added more bacon. (for the bacon I usually prepare a special breakfast for myself and a group of friends earlier in the week and then just snag some of the crisper slices to make this recipe)
Only 2 cups of cheddar, but added 8 oz of cream cheese to the sauce (after the milk and b4 the cheddar)
Added broccoli to the veggies.
I've also tried adding a can of well drained tuna.
This recipe tastes great as leftovers as well :)
Thanks Abbey for posting this recipe :)

Leave out the onions, use pancetta instead of bacon and use a mix of cheddar, gruyere and asiago for the cheese. To make it a real winner throw some panko breadcrumbs mixed with a little more cheese on top at the end and pop under the broiler, until browned, for a delicious crunchy texture and even more flavor. My 13 year old daughter and her friends will demolish a whole platter in minutes.

If you're getting a floury taste - work on your roux. This should be pure creamy, cheesy goodness.

Love the concept of making it from scratch, but this recipe lacked flavor! Needs ALOT more spices, seasoning, and more liquid. Mine came out dry and tasteless.

Great Mac and Cheese recipe even though I made it healthier -- turkey bacon, low fat cheese, corn pasta and skim milk. I added some peas and dry mustard to add some kick.

Everyone Loved this.  However, I added more bacon and used cheddar and mozzarella and provalone cheeses (I am not a big cheese person )it is so easy as well (which really calls for a lot of will power,LOL)

The first thing my husband said was "Im never going back to Kraft Macaroni again"!! It really was that delicious. I read ahead to the other comments before preparing myself and the only modifications I made was I added a 1/2 tsp of Garlic Powder, and Salt and Pepper. Otherwise i followed the directions. Just remember to be patient making the sauce and it will turn out great. I will definitely be sharing this recipe with others and it will be a staple at our table from now on.

Good flavor, but my sauce turned out a little grainy. I'm going to keep trying to find an awesome mac and cheese recipe.

I used jalapeno bacon which gave it a nice flavor.  I probably will add some cayenne next time.  Great base recipe to embellish as you please!

We followed the recipe exactly, except we used whole wheat ingredients.  It was good!  If I were to make it again, I would probably add a bit more spice, as it was rather bland, but my kids ate it, which was a huge compliment!!

WOW! This was really good! I used about 6 slices of bacon, removed from the pot when browned and then I used about 2 tsps of the bacon drippings to saute the chopped onions and garlic for a little extra flavour.  After removing the onions and garlic I used the same pot to make the sauce.  When adding the milk i added only about 1/4 cup at a time while constantly whisking to ensure that it would be smooth.  Before adding the cheese i removed the milk from the direct heat and allowed it to cool for a moment so that it wouldn't be grainy.  Best mac n cheese my family has ever had! Thanks so much for sharing!

I really liked this recipe...I did make some changes tho, you do have to WAIT a while, let the milk almost boil!  I also added a diced fresh tomato and some green chilis to give it a little extra zest and ommitted the bacon.

This is a staple in  our house, I never really liked mac and cheese until I tried this recipe.  I add a little dijon mustard and a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the roux for a little extra flavor, and I omit the bacon.  Great recipe.

This tasted like onion and noodles! VERY VERY VERY bland. I followed the recipe except for only used half an onion and did not use bacon.  It tasted like it should have been a hash brown casserole instead of mac and cheese.

For lack of a better word, this recipie was very interessting. The onion, garlic, and bacon was different, pretty good actually. I wouldn't always make it this way...but it's worth a try. I made it according to the recipie measurments for myself and my boyfriend, and we have enough leftovers to last a week. I also added extra milk at the advice of the others, and it did not dry out. I added cracker crumbs to the topping as well as cheese...overall, pretty good.

This was a great recipe and fairly easy too. My husband loved the onions and the bacon, and I could hardly keep myself from eating it out of the dish before it baked.  I doubled it as some of the other reviewers suggested and am glad I did- it would have been enough for two, but now I have it to look forward to as leftovers! Definitely not for those on a diet, but so rich that you can be satisfied with a smaller portion.

This is a really good recipe…it turned out perfect except that when I served it (right from the oven) 5 minutes later it dried up and became a bit stiff… needs a bit of tweaking but otherwise a great success…I found the qty too little so I doubled the entire recipe and was perfect for two... a keeper. Thanks!

I made this to see if my 23 mo old would like it...I didn't have any bacon on hand and I used baby shells rather than penne pasta.  I used only half an onion and minced before sauteing with the garlic...This was a little too dry for our taste and had too much onion flavor.  I think next time I will reduce the onion and add sour cream or cream cheese to the sauce...will probably add a pinch of cayenne too.

Very good-- sauce is a little intensive to make though.  I added about 6 slices of bacon as other reviewers suggested.  This is NOT your traditional southern mac and cheese, so-- if you want somethings different, give it a try.

I made sure to avoid the "raw flour" taste by thoroughly cooking the roux, and cutting the amount of flour to 2 tbsp. I used a sharp cheddar and threw in some jack and colby to boot...The bacon and garlic flavors are fine, but we much preferred the dish the second time around when I left out the onion. I will definitely use this recipe again, it is much more versatile than my old stove-top method!

This is a very easy dish to make. I changed a few things(lactose intolerant) I used Goat Cheddar Cheese, Earth Balance in place of butter, lactose free milk and gluten free macaroni noodles. I also doubled the bacon.It turned out to be a very tasty dish. I have not had macaroni and cheese in years, but thought i would try this with my changes and very happy i did.My husband who can have dairy enjoyed it also. Thank you very much for the recipe, will be making this again

I followed the recipe exactly, I always do the first time and if I want changes I do it the second time.  I will make this again but I will omit the onions they just didn't seem to belong. I will however keep the bacon, beacon belongs everywhere :-).  Next time I will only use two TBS flour to my 2TBS butter and 2 cups of whole milk and a big pinch of nutmeg. Now after writing this I realize that I have just reverted back to my old recipe with the addition of bacon, hard to teach an old dog new tricks.

I made this last night but I made mine spicy! I mixed jalapenos and used Jack and sharp cheese, then topped it off with bread crumbs. So good!

Be sure to use small to medium pasta shells or there won't be enough sauce to cover the shells.

A little dry, however, I added two garlic cloves and bread crumb topping. After adding the bread crumbs, I baked for 20 minutes (as described) and then broiled on high for 2 minutes. Also, I added oregano for garnish

Way too much cheese, and it seems like it would be a really great recipe, it just didn't turn out for me. I'm not a fan.

This recipe was not bad but it was a little bland. After reading some of the other reviews, I too will definitely add a little something to flavor it up.

My kids would give this a million stars if they could, and that is a direct quote from them.  They were in love with this recipe and have requested it twice in the last week.  I mean, what's not to love, pasta, cheese, and bacon?

It was all right.  Fairly bland.  Of course, I did use 16 oz. of pasta, not 8.  Still, next time I will definitely season it up a bit!  And I like it not as saucy as it would have been had I used 8 oz. of pasta.

The fact that my kids think box mac n cheese is the best, they loved this version. I did add more cheese and only used 1/2 of an onion.  It came out perfect and its no more box for them.

This was good. It's not the cheesiest, it's more like a casserole, and quite heavy for a meal. Still in small portions its good.

I liked this a lot! I was nervous making it, because many people complained about floury tasting sauce. I added the milk veeeeeery slowly and it turned out great! I didn't use the bacon, but that is just a personal taste thing. My boyfriend liked it, too. :)

Very good recipe. I substituted turkey bacon for regular bacon and added 2 cups cheddar cheese and 1 cup reduced fat sharp cheddar.  Tasted great!

I thought this was a nice recipe.  I enjoyed the bacon and onion flavors because it made the usual mac and cheese so different.  I did add bread crumbs on the top with the extra cheese, and that made a nice crust.  I think I used too much pasta, but it was still great and I will make this again.  Thanks!

Not the best mac & cheese I have had. I had to add extra flour and the sauce still didn't thicken. The recipe didn't list how much cheese to use either.

This was a huge hit with my family. My 3 year old son was even asking for seconds. I however, made a few changes out of necessity. First off, I didn't have any onion so that was omitted. Then because I was too lazy and short on time to defrost and cook any bacon, I chopped up some presliced pepperoni. I sauteed the roni with the garlic and drained off the extra grease. Then I didn't have enough cheddar cheese so I mixed in Monterey Jack and Mozzerella. I also was a bit worried when I mixed it all together and it seemed too runny so I baked it for an extra 10 minutes (30 minutes total). Absolutely, hands down, THE best mac and cheese recipe on the site!!!

I would have rated this more stars if I could.. LOL. My very picky g'daughter loved this version of mac and cheese!! She requested left over the next day. I did not add the veggies or bacon, just did the basic of butter, flour, milk, and cooked noodles. I also added dry mustard, salt, and pepper as another cook recommended! Excellent!

This is a super recipe!  The more I make it, the better it gets.  I have never had a problem getting the sauce to the right consistency.  I put all the cheese in the sauce and put extra on the top.  I also put salt & pepper in the sauce and use turkey bacon, instead of pork.  I like to broil the cheese on top for a few minutes until it is golden brown.  Excellent recipe - definitely a keeper!

It was ok.  i cooked the onion and garlic in the bacon grease, which may of made the mac'n'cheese too greasy.  I also added a bit more cheese, that could of made it greasy also.  Not as creamy as I would of liked it.

I haven't made baked mac n cheese in a long time and honestly didn't have a good reipe for it anymore.  This one works great!  I followed the recipe and added a few extra spices (black pepper, seasoned salt) an it came out perfect.  I did have to bake it for about 25 minutes to get the cheese to brown on top and ended up turing on the broiler for a minute to crisp up the cheese (yum) My boyfriend and I both loved it.  It was even better the second day for lunch reheated!

This is a good basic recipe. Instead of bacon, I used some diced ham. I love onions, so I browned and slow cooked a large vidalia until it was translucent and added that to the garlic. On the top I sprinkled some italian bread crumbs, a tiny bit of old bay (i don't exactly know why, it just struck me as I looked through my cabinet..lol) and it turned out really good. I used a combination of shredded provolone, swiss lorraine and a tiny bit of american cheese. It was different, but good. The white american cheese, which I normally think is flavorless and do not ever buy, made it really creamy and assisted the other stronger flavors. Try it, you might like it..lol.

Didn't use onion, replaced garlic with abount 1/2 tsp garlic powder and added paprika.  Husband loved it, we don't have kids yet, but he said "will you make this for our kids?".  I think it's good comfort food, and an excellent replacement for box mac n cheese...b/c who knows what actually goes in that????

Edible, but not really enjoyable.  I think I'll stick to my tried and true recipe. I love bacon, onion, & garlic, so I thought this would be delightful...BIG DISAPPOINTMENT :O( Btw:  If you're having trouble with the roux, use a whisk or fork; that'll make it smooth.

Loved this bake - added more flavour with the onions, garlic and bacon than just plain old macaroni cheese.  As others have done, I cooked everything in one pan at the same time.  Compliments to the chef from the girls at work, too!!!  Very enjoyable!

This is awesome as a base recipe.  I have been desperately trying to recreate the baked mac and cheese from a local pub, and this has catapulted me to the closest I'll be to perfection.  I omit the bacon, use orechiette pasta instead of penne, and omit the onion and garlic.  Instead of just cheddar, I use a mix of shredded asiago, swiss, smoked mozzarella, and cheddar and I sprinkle a tiny bit of mustard powder in top of the mac before it bakes.  I always bake it for more than in called for because I like parts to crisp up.

Very tasty, the flavor of onions, garlic & bacon are well worth the extra effort.  I split the cheese between cheddar & Monterey Jack vs. all cheddar, yum!

I am usually not very fond of baked mac n cheese, but my husband loves it.  Finally, I have found a recipe that was easy to make and delicious!  I will definitely make it again.  To make it even easier, I used real bacon bits.  I added more than the equivalent of two bacon strips.

My family loved this recipe (although my son prefers processed cheese to cheddar).  I will make it again.

Sometimes you can't improve on a classic comfort food.  Macaroni and cheese lovers love just that - the extras in this recipe are great but change the satisfaction index of this comfort food.

This seemed so easy and I followed the recipe completely but it was so bland!  No tang at all.  I didn't really like it but maybe I didn't use enough spice or the right kind of cheese.

This is a great recipe.  I  used this one everytime I make mac and cheese.  It's so easy and the cheese sauce is always the same consistency.  I don't put the onions, garlic, or bacon in.  Instead I put turkey hotdogs and prosciutto.  Yummy!

Pretty simple to make. Took a little while for the sauce to thicken but it eventually came around. Decided to add a steak,  mushrooms and a few extra slices of bacon to "beef"it up; besides that followed it to the T. Delicious.

I made this for the first time today and was so please, I made a second batch immediately!
I made the sauce and had no trouble with thickening . I added some adobo seasoning for taste.  I also added frenchs fried onions to the top prior to baking for the crunchy elimate.
Amazing, I have 7 boys and this does not last long.

Came out great. I followed the recipe almost exactly only used a short cut instead of real bacon I used packaged real bacon bits from Oscar Meyer, I mixed it into the sweet onions and garlic which I sautéed in butter. I liked the way it came out with the onions and bacon and I didn't have any issues with the cheese sauce or making the sauce in the pot (cooking the milk mixture) and no issues with floury taste as others have stated. I am sure maybe you could add more cheddar cheese to the main mix but it was good the way it was IMO. I did add a little bit of salt before putting it in the casserole dish. I will see how my fiancé likes it when he comes home from work later.

I used a little less flour, stirred it with the butter for a long time, and could still taste the flour. 

I did add broccoli to the veggies, and a little hot sauce. I wish I would have used sharp cheddar, because it needs some sort of kick (the hot sauce helped).

Also, the sauce took FOREVER to thicken. Maybe 25 minutes? I think I'd rather just stick to my usual recipe for mac n' cheese.

This turned out great! I used only 2 cups of cheddar, plus 1/2 cup parmesan and 1/2 cup mozzarella for the topping. The sauce turned out great and was the perfect thickness. I made sure to add the milk slowly, and it took awhile to reach the right consistency, but it really turned out tasty and the cheese melted perfectly in the sauce. So very good! Would definitely make this again. :)

When the family says "make that any time" it's a 5 star recipe.  I used very old cheddar (7 years old) and topped it with some bread crumbs mixed with some parmesan.  The bacon, garlic and onion added lots of flavour too.  Easy and tasty.

Very good!  Trying to be the most efficient (and dirty the least dishes) I made the sauce all in one pan.  Use a large pan to cook the bacon, then remove it.  Cook the onions and garlic in the bacon grease (why waste that extra bacon flavor?!).  Add 1 TBSP of butter to the onions after they have cooked, then add the flour and proceed.  With any gravy or roux base, I've found that after adding the milk, stir until it comes to a boil and boil for 1 minute, while still stirring - that usually thickens it up nicely and removes any lumps.  Like others, I added salt and pepper and may add other spices next time.  But overall it was super yummy and my whole family loved it!

Best Mac and Cheese recipe that I've made to date.  I did saute garlic and onion in the bacon fat and added 1/4 tsp dry mustard to the roux.  The rest stayed the same.

Just like most almost everyone that has tried this recipe, I had to add a little salt in the sauce. My family loved it.I love that fact that a little goes a long way. The recipe says that it is for 5 servings but I got about 8. I will be making this again soon.

While this doesn't knock my socks off every time I ALWAYS get rave reviews from husband and children. I pretty much stick to the recipe but often add peas to it to get some 'green' in there. I also sometimes crumble potato chips on top or seasoned bread crumbs for a bit of crunch.

We can see how this could be considered a "bland" recipe, idea wise it was a great way to make mac & cheese and have it not be to "grainy" texture wise (using a roux) however, had we not used sharp cheddar, smoked cheddar, Chipotle cheddar, then used sharp and Parmesan on top, this could have been rather flavorless. We added more salt (season salt) as well. Great idea, just executed it differently.

Not the best macaroni and cheese I've tasted. I expected more. As my first time mac n cheese recipe, I did not want the flourry taste as some commented on. I followed some suggestions by reviewers but unfortunately did not substitute the flour for cornstarch. I had very slowly added the milk at low heat and waited forever for it to thicken. I did not use onions as I do not like them. I had it on low heat for over 10+ minutes without it thickening at all--still watery! the only way it would thicken is if i had raised it up to medium heat (and it still took some time to thicken with my constant stirring to prevent chunks/uneveness). I had used medium cheddar (the recipe didn't really state what type - i assumed mild). I took the sauce off heat for a few mins and added the cheddar very slowly while stirring.  Overall, all of the time/effort to make this was not worth the end result. I was ok, but I was disappointed when I got a grainy taste after I had followed all of the other suggestions from the reviews. I wonder if cornstarch would serve better as a thickener and prevent the flour taste.

This was the worst mac and cheese I have ever tasted.  Even my 4 year old wouldn't eat it.  I had to go back and review the recipe because I thought I did something wrong.  It was tasteless and the texture was awful, eventhough I added a lot more cheese than the recipe called for.

I just made this and I thought it was tasty.  I found that it needed A LOT of salt, although you wouldn't think so with all the bacon and cheese.  I added dried mustard and I think it would also taste good with a pinch of cayenne pepper or with sauteed green/red peppers added.  For my first homemade mac and cheese I thought this was good.

My fave mac and cheese! I have made this a good few times now, the more you make it the better it tastes. Be sure to take you time doing the cheese sauce it can be runny if you rush!

This recipe is just great! I made it for my mother's surprise birthday party last week and received thumbs-up from everyone. All said it was marvelous. A few of them even hurried me for the recipe.

I improvised by substituting the bacon with button mushrooms, however, as there were vegetarian guests as well. I was very worried when the sauce became very gooey  but i followed the advice of SLOWLY putting in the milk and it turned out perfect. Thanks!!

A suggestion for making white sauce - warm the milk in the microwave before adding to the roux.   Just whisk a lot as you add the milk, and it will thicken faster and turn out just fine.

I wish I would've read the comments before posting my earlier post.  This dish was very easy to make and it was my first time making homemade mac & cheese.

I add velveta cheese along with the sharp chedder, my hubby doesn't eat anything with out velveta!  Was very good.  But can be bland without adding salt when baking.  We just added it to our plate when needed.  Otherwise was very very good, even the INLAWS loved it!

SOOOOOOOOOO GOOD! We love a little kick in everything, so I added just a dash of cayenne pepper- just enough to tickle the throat. My husband, the UBER picky eater so it was truly the "yummiest mac and cheese" he's ever had. It's a keeper!

For a first time chef, this recipe was extremely easy to follow. The results were great! I've made this twice and I've had cheers both times. As a suggestion, I find using bacon bits saves time and offers convenience for the student cook.

This recipe tasted good when we added 3/4  cup of marshmellows. Whats better than mac and cheese and marshmellows? My favorite two things! A little fluff never hurt.......

This recipe is awesome.  It's a great basic recipe that's easy to change and add to.  I recently just tried it with chopped grill chicken and italian cheeses and that was pretty good. I love my mom's homemade mac'n'cheese but it takes forever to make, this doesn't.  It's fantastically easy to make and easy to eat.

Despite the reviews that claimed it was hard to make the sauce, i found it actually quite simple. It may have taken a lengthy amount of time, but it was well worth it. I also added a sprinkle of breadcrumbs to the top for an added crunch. It was superb!

So i don't like bacon and decided to omit it. Apparently it is the bacon that gives flavor to the dish (?). Very bland without it. I probably should have tried a different meat instead but I haven't got to the point of experimenting yet...

Pretty bland. I wish I would have read the "most helpful" reviews before I prepared that one because it really could have used some  salt & pepper. I didnt like it with bacon and neither did my kids. But, for my first try at homemade mac & cheese- I learned what not to do.

Very good recipe. My husband told me right away that it was a keeper. We used Old Cheddar and it was very good. Next time I might do it with Extra Old Cheddar and Old Cheddar (50/50). 

The only thing else is that the prep time was A LOT longer than 10 minutes! The sauce alone took me about 20 minutes of intense stirring. Next time I will use a hand mixer because it was very tiring on the arm.

Tasty and creamy!  I used a mild cheddar, and knew right away it needed to be a sharp cheese for better flavor.  I added a can of chili for a very nice CHILI MAC!  The recipe went far.  Will make again...but with SHARP cheese!

I'm not much of a Macaroni and Cheese eater, but I thought I would try this recipe.  It was great.  But I did use Sargento's 4 Cheese Mexican blend cheese instead of cheddar.  I will be making this weekly.

I made this last nite and my husband and I thought it was great. I used one pan for the cooking portion to make clean up easier. I added more bacon (defatted), used a small onion and added 1 shallot and salt and pepper, since it tasted bland without it. The sauce came out beautifully, taking time to add the (whole) milk slowly. I used Colby cheese and topped w/ sharp cheddar. The penne was nice, holding the sauce inside each piece. I considered adding Durkee onions on top, but thought I'd try it w/out first. I look forward to leftovers and hope it's just as tasty!

I definitely enjoyed the onion and bacon in this recipe.  The cheese sauce was lovely coming immediately from the oven, but turned pasty upon cooling slightly.  I used four slices of center cut bacon and one pound of good quality, extra sharp cheddar.  The cheese flavor was wonderful, and I would have enjoyed more bacon.  I saved pans by sauteeing the onion and garlic in the same pan I had used for the bacon after pouring out most of the bacon fat.  Don't think this is a keeper, though, because of the texture.

I liked the complex taste with the onion and bacon....but I used half of what the recipe called for with the onion.  I also added about 1/2 stick of Velveeta, cubed for a cheesier/creamier dish. Don't forget the salt and pepper.

This was very easy to make. I think the next time I might try adding a different cheese to the cheddar for more flavor. I'll bet adding some stewed tomatoes to this recipe would taste excellent as well!

i thought this mac and cheese recipe was delicous with a few out-of-the-ordinary twists.  the garlic was a nice touch, and since im a big garlic lover i added a little extra.  i put in onion powder unstead of real onion becuase onions irritate my eyes so much.  my brother thought it could have used a lot more bacon, and i think if i make it again i would add more.

we weren't crazy about this.  while i think the additions of garlic, onion, and bacon are great, it wasn't cheesy enough for us, despite adding an extra cup of cheese.  maybe i didn't cook my roux long enough, but it still tasted a little floury and gritty to us, too.  i'll probably look for another recipe and add garlic and bacon to it.

My family and I really enjoyed this one. It had a lot of flavor and made a great main course. I do agree with the other reviewer who felt that it was better unbaked.

Overall recipe was quite good.  I changed a few things...added 1/4 c of cream cheese, substituted the cheddar cheese for an italian mixture that I had on hand(mozzarella, asiago, parmesan) & a couple of tablespoons of McLaren's sharp cheddar.  I also topped it with ritz cracker crumbs and a sharp cheddar.  Very cheesy and yummy!!!  :-)

I have made this recipe every year during the holidays.  My friend's children look forward to it every year.  It is the most delicious mac and cheese ever!  I make it a little more festive by sprinkling chopped red and green peppers on the top.

This is a great version of an adult macaroni and cheese!  It is well worth the time put into it and is great when you are craving a familiar but tasty comfort food.  Thank you for the recipe!

i fryed the onion,garlic and chopped bacon together to save time. If you add equal quantities of flour and butter together and cook off the flour a little, the taste wont be so floury

The onions add a tasty zip to the dish.  A good addition to the recipe is to stir in sliced hot dogs or smoked sausage and then bake.

This macaroni was awesome!  The bacon and onions added nice subtle flavor, but the flavor wasn't overpowering.
I baked mine for about 35 minutes.  It really was worth the effort.  This recipe gets an A+ in my book.

Add seasoning or add more bacon. It was bland.  Made for Thanksgiving and the kids and guests preferred broccoli casserole over this mac & cheese.

Delicious! I think the onions, bacon, and garlic contribute to the nice, flavorful touches. I added some habanero peppers and used unsweetened almond milk because that's what I do. I also used about 2 cups of freshly grated sharp cheddar cheese and about a cup of fontina cheese and added some cajun seasoning, sea salt and freshly ground pepper. I made a panko bread crumb and butter mixture and sprinkled it on top of dish before putting in the oven. I had to be patient for the thickening step. It took about 15-20 minutes on low/med heat. I just kept stirring and stirring like I was making risotto or something.  Glad I had the patience because the dish was delicious. Next time, I might add more bacon and perhaps add a little mustard and a little nutmeg. Great base recipe, and I will be using this recipe on the regular.

Very easy recipe to follow. I omitted the bacon because I don’t really eat pork. Made a few tweaks and overall tasted great! I added a mix of Parmesan cheese and Italian breadcrumbs on top.

I'm always asked if I will be making and bringing this to family gatherings and the pan is always empty.  I make the 12 serving size, but use one pound of bacon (you can never use TOO MUCH bacon!).  I use a mixture of ricotta, sharp cheddar, italian and mexican blend cheeses.

Great recipe! I didn''t have a problem with a "floury taste" at all, but usually the roux has an even amount of butter and flour, so I did 3 Tbsp of each. I made some minor adjustments as well, based on what I had on hand. Instead of regular cheddar cheese I used a shredded tex mex blend, and threw in a package of ranch dressing. And of course, sauteed the onions and garlic in the bacon grease. Deeeeeelish! And my boyfriend suggested next time I should throw in some diced chicken breast.

It's not my first time making mac & cheese & this is a keeper. I used sharp & extra sharp cheddar. Also I used a 12 oz can of evaporated milk & added water to make it 16 oz. Added 1 tsp mustard powder & black pepper. My husband raved about it & said to give it 5 stars.

I love this recipe. I've made it a couple of times, though it has been YEARS (maybe a decade) since I last made it...but that was also the last time I made mac n cheese from scratch.

I also decided that, instead of butter, I was just going to use the bacon grease. I mean, they are both fats, and the bacon grease is Right There already. No sense wasting it. Works out just fine.

Only reason I gave 1 star off (so, only 4 stars) is that it basically makes an 9"x9" pan of this. It requires doubling if you want to chow down on it or want substantial leftovers (or both). I tend to cook for the week in advance for lunches (at the very least), so the recipe As Is isn't quite up to that. Just a thing to remember.

I really enjoyed this and it was quick and easy. I added a 200g pack of bacon instead of just 2 slices, I also added a spring onion and some cherry tomatoes. I also added quite a bit of salt and pepper to the cheese sauce.

We made this gluten free by using rice flour and rice pasta. We made individual portions by putting pasta into muffin tins - only baked for 10 minutes. We sprinkled hemp seeds on top for a bit of crunch.

Recipe should've mentioned adding salt.  Of course i should've remembered to as well.  LOL

I probably should've added a little corn starch to the cheese sauce too.

I found it strange that there were no spices in the recipe, so I added salt, pepper, and dried mustard powder. 

This recipe was delicious and super easy. I highly recommend it.

It was bland so I will be spicing it up next time, and the only thing I did this time was add some leftover grilled chicken on top before I spread the rest of the cheese over it.

This is a stick to your ribs macaroni and cheese but -oh- so worth it! There are a few more steps than a regular macaroni and cheese, but again, with it! The onion gives it a nice subtle flavor that kicks it up a notch! A must try!!!

I don't typically like onions in my food so I left out those and the garlic (although I might try it again with both to see if it improves the overall flavor).  The bacon was a pleasant addition.  Overall, the kids liked it but I thought it could have been a bit cheesier.  It seemed a bit dry and needed a thicker topping of baked cheese.

It was too thick and pasty. I liked the bacon in it, but if I did it again, I would simply melt the cheese in hot milk and mix it in. I don't think the flour is necessary at all.

It never fails, the more time I spend making a recipe the worse the meal comes out. This was no exception. It may have been because I listened to too many of the reviewers, but I wanted to make sure I got flavor and everything ran smoothly up until the eating part. I unfortunately listened to the reviewer that suggested adding the crackers to the top and putting the cheese on top of that. That made it taste very floury and prevented the cheese from flowing through to the rest of the mac and cheese. Bad move.  I am going to try to scrape that off and re-do the cheese tonight and see what happens. And yeah, it did take a lot of pans! At least my husband ate it...

Yes.  I loved it.  We all know how to make a roux, take the time to let the flour brown just a bit.  I love the use of penne pasta, that takes in all of the goodness of the sauce.  I tend to add more milk ( I use fat free 1/2 and 1/2) for a creamer mac.  I too caramelize my onions, and add the bacon 1/4 into the mac and the rest on top as my family wants. This is the go to, "it's so cold outside, want comfort food recipe".. Thanks for sharing!

Made this for a lo boil, and although it pretty much all got eaten, it was easily the worst dish there. It was not horrible, but even though I added quite a bit of freshly cooked/crumbled bacon and herbs, it still was pretty bland. I will probably cook it again, but I'll be adding a lot of other things to make it more flavorful!

I tried this recipe and liked it but made a few minor changes.  Before putting it in the oven, I drained a can of Italian flavored diced tomatoes and placed them on top of the casserole - then instead of a cup of shredded cheddar, I cut slices of cheddar into strips and put on top.

Made it with gluten-free penne and subbed a can of evaporated milk because I was out of milk. Topped with double the amount of bacon. Very tasty - a more "grown up" mac n cheese. My kids like mac n cheese plain but I enjoyed this recipe. Make sure to add plenty of salt and pepper to season the sauce well and a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder is a good addition to consider.

well the sauce does thicken but it does take time and stirring.  in other words... do not walk away and just bring it to boil.  YOU WILL NOT GET THE SAME RESULTS.

that being said i did you half an onion like others suggested.  i also used some of the bacon fat and mixed this with the bacon mixture and the breadcrumbs and used this as the topping instead of mixing it in.  

I also added some gruyere and parmesean and took out some cheddar.  it killed me to do that but it was soooo worth it!   SUPER CHEESY!  adding a pinch more salt i mixed it with small shell pasta and out it came from the oven and then into my belly.

I tweaked a little but over all great recipe and not too difficult to make

Great Mac and Cheese recipe!  I increased the amount of bacon and used Mexican Cheese because my husband is not a cheddar cheese fan.  He liked it that way!

I followed everything in the recipe and mine turned out really bland. I would suggest adding more bacon, and using some salt & pepper too. The flour and butter clumped up and took forever to thicken the milk. If this dish was a little more flavorful, it would've been good.

My husband really enjoyed this recipe.  As suggested I added the dry mustard and cracked pepper.  I also added another clove of garlic.

The roux for this recipe is fine as long as u take your time and cook slow as well as allow to boil a bit at the end. I used half sharp cheddar and half montery jack with jalapenos, added spinach and YUM!

This is the first time I made homemade Mac and Cheese, and I like this recipe as a base recipe very much.  My boyfriend and roommate liked it as well.  I didn't have trouble making the roux from the instructions given.  I did substitute with 2 parts heavy cream to 1 part 2% milk, added some white cheese, and substituted for whole wheat flower.  I also added pancetta, tomatoes, and bread crumbs. But overall, I would recommend this as a starter recipe.

I've been using this recipe for years and it's very popular with my family particularly on cold, wintry days. I made my regular vegetarian adjustments to this recipe by omitting bacon. I've also taken to using 1 cup cheddar, 1 cup American and 1 cup white cheddar cheese instead of just cheddar.  The three cheese combination adds extra flavor to an already tasty recipe.

Extra bacon with some onions (half of what is called for) was perfect for us.  We topped with crumbled buttered crackers for a little extra crunch and served with a side of green beans for a great meal that the kids ask for again and again.

I used this as a base for what I made last night. I only had 2 cups of cheddar, and one of mozzarella, so that's what I used. I also used whole wheat pasta and added shredded carrots. Delicious! My husband and 2 year old love it!

Delicious! Best mac and cheese I have made so far! I did add 1 extra slice of bacon, dry mustard, cayenne, nutmeg and white pepper. I did not have just cheddar cheese, so I used a mixture of chedder, mozzerella & asiago. We ate every bit!

I made this for a tailgate. I changed it as I used cream for the rue. It was very thick . I also used some breadcrumbs and smoked cheese for the topping then browned it with the broiler at the end of backing. I also used a mix cheese with cheddar and mozzarella. I think it went over well as it was all gone!

I loved this respie. I love when there aren't a lot of ingrediants and it's still delicious.  I tweaked it a little. firt off, I used Wondra and added it until it was the consistency I wanted to the butter. Also, I used bacon pieces from Oscar Meyer to it.  I skipped the onion, after reading some the reviewsand my own sense told me onion might not be a good idea. Another reviewer wrote that she added saltines melted with butter on the top, loved that idea, too. My family loved it!

This recipe is very good, you may need to add a little more bacon as i did for more flavor...yum, the first time you make it, you may feel there isn't as much flavor but then the next time you make it you can add you own little twist to this recipe. My twist was to add more bacon and some cheyenne pepper.

This was amazing. mac and cheese heaven. The only change that I made to the recipe was to use macaroni instead of penne and didn't use any onion or spices. The basic recipe, however was sooooo good. The only thing I would change next time would be to use just a little less bacon. Thanks for the great recipe!

After reading the reviews, I too added double the bacon and cooked the onion in a little of the bacon grease.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of the milk for whipping cream.  I did use cheddar, and I thought it was not bland, but was exactly like restaurant macaroni and cheese.  I had been making the joy of cooking version for 10 years, but this is my new standard.  I added the milk slowly and had no sauce problems and did not find it floury at all.

Excellent! I read the reviews and only added 1/2 the onion. Also, to jazz up the recipe I used 1 cup mozzarella, 1 cup mild cheddar and 1 cup Dubliner. Instead of bacon, I sprinkled the pasta with breadcrumbs before popping it in the oven. Delicious!

This recipe was good.. I would have liked the sauce to be a little more creamier and less thick. But to give this recipe some EXTRA flavor I added: 1 additional glove of Garlic, 1/2 Tsp. Dijon Mustard, 1/2 Tsp. Cyane Pepper, 1/2 Tsp. Paprika and a couple shots of Worcestershire. Also for more flavor try different types of cheese. I used Mild White Cheddar and Monteray Jack Cheese. I also coverd for half the time so the cheese would be melted instead of extremely crispy! I would make this again!

I didn't do the bacon because it just seemed like an ick thing to do. It was good, but not amazing. If I could do one thing over again it would be no garlic. It was a weird combo with the creaminess.

This was very good!  I used canadian bacon, more garlic, and omitted onions.  My husband doesn't like them.  I baked it for double the time, as I didn't want it too creamy.  It was crunchy on top, which i loved!  I would definitely make this again!

I used less cheese to reduce fat content - and added tomatoes as suggested by another reader.  Why kids prefer KD is way beyond my comprehension - it was delicious!!!  Will be using this at my next pot luck - that's if it makes it out the door from my house untouched!

Very good and easy to make, didn't change a thing.  If you are use to box mac and cheese, this is a good change of pace.

Fantastic!! I used only half an onion and I had to bake it for an extra 20 mins (I think that was my oven though!!) It was delish..... kids loved it as well. Thank you for this one, its a keeper.

I'm used to mac&cheese out of the box, so the texture of this recipe threw me at first, but I got over it.  I thought it was very good.  Unfortunately, my son couldn't get past the texture.  I'll make it again as a punishment ;).

I doubled the amount of chedar cheese and added velveta to the top.  My wife and I both loved it.  I would have given it five stars but making it caused a lot of dish washing

I didn't add the garlic and onions cause I thought that might give it a wierd taste.  I also mixed about 2 cups of crushed corn flakes with a handful of breadcrumbs in 3 tblsp melted butter for a topping. It was exccelent and there were no leftovers.

I didn't use bacon in this because I don't eat meat, but even so, I wasn't incredibly impressed... it was a bit rubbery, and I followed the instructions exactly. The taste was good but the texture wasn't exactly what I was looking for, I was hoping for a creamier mac and cheese. Maybe next time I'll use processed cheese as well as the cheddar.

This was a bit runny for me. Feels too much like a casserole with the onions and bacon. I would omit them next time -- but still very tasty.

My husband loves mac and cheese, so I wanted to surprise him with this side dish.  He didn't rave... and finally said 3 stars.  When I asked if he wanted me to save the leftovers, he said no... OK, 2 stars.  I dumped the rest of the dish.  I had to leave out the bacon because of Lent, but I doubt a couple slices of bacon could have saved this recipe for us.

This was really great and my husband loved it.  I made one minor adjustment to the recipe and added spicey mustard powder to the roux... gave the dish just a little kick.

Very good!  Easy, too!  I don't think it was very labor intensive.  Mine was prepared and in the oven in about 20 minutes.  I did use Oscar Mayer's real bacon bits to cut down on time, though.  Smelled awesome!  Tasted better!

standard mac and cheese has been a constant in my home for 10 years.  I haven't been able to stomach it for the past 5.  I LOVE THIS!!! I also added more bacon. Mixed swiss and cheddar.  Love the onions as well. I can eat mac and cheese again.  thanks!! might have added more garlic and salt and pepper.  I was on the phone at the time and was tasting as I went along

This turned out fantastic. I made it for Easter dinner. I added an extra clove of garlic and about 12 oz of penne. There was plenty of cheese sauce to cover it all. I turned on the broiler for the last 5 minutes of baking to crisp the cheddar cheese on top.

This was excellent.  The added bacon flavor was perfect. As the other reviewer said, you must cook the flour to get rid of the "floury" taste. I found the sauce very creamy and rich.  GREAT RECIPE!

I tried this recipe last night and am sorry to say didn't like it.  I followed some earlier advice about the flour, so I used half the amount but I still tasted a lot of flour and couldn't really taste the cheese.

An excellent recipe, although I had concerns about people saying that they tasted the flour. So I used less flour, and doubled up on the cheese. With less flour, the milk didn't sufficiently thicken for a while, but the extra added cheese made up for that. What resulted was a very very cheesy Macaroni and Cheese that pleased all. The bacon was a real nice touch.

This is a fabulous dish!  So easy and soooooo good!  And it re-heats really well too.
I didn't add the onions as I don't like them, and I didn't add the bacon so it needed a little 
salt.  But it was great and soooo easy (I made while chatting on the phone!).

I don't understand to when the milk and flour are supposed to get thick mine never did and i was stirring it constantly? I also added some polska sausage to give it a better taste, but it wasn't as good as i thought it would be. My husband did like alot,though my 9 yr. old kid wasn't as thrilled either.

This was very good. I liked the bacon flavor. Next time, I will only use half an onion and half the flower.

You could taste the flour in it. My husband loved it but no one else did. If I make it again I would use just a little flour.

It's O.K.  However the kids did not care for the bacon and onions.  A little too thick also.  I think I will find an original Mac & Cheese.

Excellent.  Very good variation on regular Mac & Cheese casserole.  I especially liked the onions.

I LOVED THE RECIPE. IT WAS EASY TO MAKE AND VERY TASTY. I DID ADD ONE FEATURE TO THIS RECIPE. I TOOK SEVERAL PLUM TOMATOES, TOOK OUT THE FLESHY PART AND CHOPPED THE REST AND ADDED TO THE MIX. IT ADDED SOME COLOR AS WELL AS FLAVOR. OTHER THAN THAT IT WAS DELICIOUS.

GREAT mac 'n cheese!!  Very tasty.  I will definitely make again.  I used less onions than called for, but that's totally personal.

this recipe is really good. I substituted mushrooms for the bacon. I do not eat meat.
The sauce is unbelievable.

This receipe combined two tastes I was not accustomed to combining.  Mac
and cheese and onion!  I love onion but not with macaroni and cheese.  
I will make this recipe again only omitting the onion completely!  This move
makes it more kid friendly, too.

We really liked this recipe, it was quick to make and we loved the flavour with the onions and bacon.  My husband was a little hesitant when he saw me making it saying your not going to put in those onions are you?  He cleaned his plate and asked for seconds at dinner.  We are having leftovers tomorrow and I'm going to make salmon patties to go with it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I found this recipe easy to make and delicious in taste.  However, next time I would cut down on the amount of cheese and substitute a low fat cheddar which may then be more heart healthy.
