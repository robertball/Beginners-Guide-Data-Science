Oh, my gosh, so delicious!  I had to tweak the recipe slightly to accomodate my pantry.  I excluded the oregano and parsley and added italian seasoning.  I also added 4 gloves of fresh garlic (since my family, obviously, loves garlic).  It was definitely a great recipe though and the sausage was the perfect meat for this one.

This is a good recipe.  It is relatively easy to make, except that it dirties 2 pans, 1 mixing bowl, and the casserole dish.  To ensure shell success, don’t overcook the shells.  Cook them at the bottom end of the suggested cook time.  This will keep the shells from breaking while you fill them.  I’ve found that a plastic spoon works great for inserting the stuffing.  I did not have sausage on hand, so I substituted a pound of hamburger and added spices.  I’m sure the sausage would give it a more complex flavor. I also enjoyed the green pepper in this dish.  I had very little meat left over, so I was pleased that the proportions seemed correct.  It made a very large casserole dish.

Pretty good but the ricotta was overpowering the flavor of the sausage. Maybe if it were 1/2 the ricotta and added mozzarella, it would have been better. Overall ok but you won't see me eating the leftovers...and it made heaps!

I made this because my hubby prefers some meat in his shells. The family really enjoyed this dish as it was a little different from the ordinary stuffed shells.
