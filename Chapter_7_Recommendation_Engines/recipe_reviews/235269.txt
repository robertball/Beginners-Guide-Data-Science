This recipe was the worst .  One reason, the instructions state to roll up like a crescent roll. The picture shows it differently. Dough crumbles because recipe states to refridgerate, so tough isn't pliable

This was my first time making rugelach. I was invited to a friend's Chanukah celebration and I thought this would be fun to bring and share. I mixed up the sugars but adding more brown sugar than white, especially in the filling. I also added cinnamon to the filling and an extra sprinkle on top of the rolls before baking. I found it helpful to pulse the walnut and sugar filling together in the food processor. I pre-sliced the rolls before baking and then finished slicing them one they were cool.   Everyone loved this and it definitely something I would make again!
