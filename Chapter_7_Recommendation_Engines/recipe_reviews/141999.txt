I found the chicken to be a little tasteless the first time I tried the recipe, so the second time I doubled the garlic, reduced the amount of chicken stock, and added a little brie cheese to the center.    I also found that the dish was better with some sweet cranberry SAUCE instead of the jus.    First attempt was a 3 star, but the 2nd with the brie was a 5... So I gave it 4 stars.

This recipe was wonderful. Nice flavor and easy to make. I used canned cranberries instead. Chicken was moist and full of flavor.

I would probably NOT make again.  Turned out fine but sauce lacked something.  I love proscuitto, and chicken and cranberries, but this was just fair, in my opinion.

This was pretty good.  The cranberry au jus was a little too sweet for me, so next time I will probably omit the sugar and cook the OJ down to more of a syrup consistency.

This was really tasty and great for a holiday meal. Turkey and ham kinda get old but with the cranberries, it's a nice change for a Christmas meal. I used whole cranberry sauce and it turned out great!

Made it following the recipe exactly and didn't particularly like the end result... The tastes were just too conflicting--butter versus garlic versus cranberry versus prosciutto... it was just too much.  :(

It was OK - wish it had more flavor, but then again I didn't make the dipping sauce!

Fantastic dish! I substituted orange-pineapple juice and cranberry sauce and reduced the amount of sugar down to about 2 tsp. So good, I will definitely be making this again!

This was an excellent for diner.  Only thing I did not make enough.  Everyone enjoyed it.  Will definitely do again without changing a thing. Great
