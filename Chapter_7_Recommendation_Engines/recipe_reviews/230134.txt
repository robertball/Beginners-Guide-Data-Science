I am 76 and I got this recipe from my Mother, so you know it's old!  It is one of my favorites.  It will last for several days in the fridge, if it isn't eaten before then.

Yes! This is it , I am so happy to find this. My mother used to make this year round - for the really cold months she would make a batch and keep on top of our wood heating stove, not "crispy" that way but still just wonderful.
   This is going in my "keeper" recipe box right awau.

An excellent recipe that can be made zippier with just an easy change. In a saucepan on stovetop or glass measuring cup in microwave warm the vinegar, sugar, and salt stirring until everything is dissolved. As it cools, add up to about one teaspoon of mixed pickling spice in an infuser (or leave it loose if desired). When cooled completely dunk the infuser several time to extract flavor and remove. Stir in the celery seed and pour over the cucumbers and onions. Chill and enjoy.

This is IT!! I've tried a couple recipes from this website, and neither have been the exact kind that my mom used to make. This is, though! I add a tbsp of dill and leave out the celery seed since I never have any. Thank you for the great reminder of childhood :)

I really liked this recipe.  It was refreshing and kind of like a homemade pickle.  I used red onion and thought it was still a good balance between sweet/sour.  Didn't have celery seed so omitted the salt and used celery salt.

I loved this recipe. I did make some changes. I used just over a 1/4 cup of sugar, not the full 1/2  cup. I also added a splash of apple cidar vinegar, and pepper, and used red onion. It was so yummy! Will be making this again.

I thought this was good. It was like a mix between a summer cucumber salad and a slight pickle taste with the added celery seed. I ate some after it sat about 15-20 minutes or so. That is only because I am partial to crispy cucumbers. Don't try to use a diet sugar I mixed up some that way and it did not work texture or taste wise. Stick with the recipe as is. Only change I made was using 1 English cucumber and making a 1/2 recipe.

Great recipe. Just like my grandmothers, though I think she cut back on the sugar and increased the vinegar. I made this for a party and everyone said it was just like their grandmothers' too.

I am 65 years old and I've eaten these most of my life. My paternal and maternal families always fixed these for get-to-gathers; the only difference was they added black pepper and left out celery seeds. We even use the vinegar/sugar mix for "pickled" beets. Yum!

3 stars as is. 5 stars only with changes: Prefer to use apple cider vinegar. To buffer  acidity, add 1/2 c water. Too sweet. Used only 2 Tbsp sugar, increased salt to 2 tsp. Added dill weed instead of celery seed (not on hand.)

Great to make ahead and have a refreshing salad ready to pull out of the frig.  If you like a little heat, through in a few peppers.

Love this recipe! So refreshing for an easy Summer salad. I placed the cucumbers and onion in a gallon zip bag (I quadrupled the recipe). Poured in the marinade and kneaded it around to coat all the vegetables. Before zipping the bag completely, I pressed out the air so the marinade contacted everything well.  I’ve made this recipe exactly as written many times. I’ve also subbed out the white vinegar for Bragg’s, salt for Himalayan pink salt and Stevia for the sugar (1tsp liquid Stevia = 1/2 c sugar)   Both ways are equally as delicious.

Wonderfully simple and refreshing. For the store bought cucumbers I used, this recipe needed more than two days to get rid of the rawness of the skin.

Turned out great.  I doubled marinade, but only used about 1 Tablespoon of sugar.  Also used apple cider vinegar.  May have to use a little more sugar, but waiting for husband to try it.

I peeled my cucumber because I don’t like eating the peeling. So the cucumbers so soggy. I did it again and cut the cucumbers thicker and it was better. My biggest complaint was it was too sweet. If I make it again I’ll cut back a lot on the sugar.

A little too much sugar for me, but otherwise very good. I also assed the "splash" of apple cider vinegar as suggested by other reviewers. Kept in the fridge for a couple of days.

I've made this three times now!  It is reminiscent of what my mom used to make.  I did make several changes:  I used 2 cups of vinegar -- 1 C white, 1 C organic raw apple cider vinegar; 1/2 C of liquid was not enough to cover the cucumbers at all.   I lessened the sugar to 1/4 C or less; the 1/2 C is way too much IMO.  For my cucumbers, I cut them in half length ways to remove the seeds (that can cause & other stomach irritations) before I sliced them.

Exactly how my mom used to make it, except with apple cider vinegar, which gives it a zesty delicious flavor. There was no way the recipe was enough for two cucumbers so I doubled it, and it was still barely enough for one large cucumber, but its so easy to increase that it wasn't a problem. Thanks for sharing!

Definitely would make again!!  I did make some changes, though... I added about 1/2 cup of water (to dilute the vinegar a bit), extra salt (used grey sea salt), and added a good TBSP of dried herbs de Provence, and freshly cracked black pepper.

I prefer English cucumbers over domestic (left the skin on) and I'm planning on making this over and over!!  So good!!

A nice recipe starting point, customer to your taste. Like the others.... Just Too Sweet. Cut the sugar by 2/3 and it's better tasting and healthier. Also added 1 T dried dill and black pepper.

Very good. I used six mini cucumbers and half of a sweet white onion. I did have to make additional marinade...another half recipe. Left out the celery seed.

Based on prior experience, I used only half the sugar because I don't like my marinated cukes sweet.  I like a little tartness.  You can easily adjust according to your taste.

We made two batches. The first one was as the recipe, it was made as written. The result was "just okay". We found it way too sweet. The second one, cut the sugar to only 2 Tblsp. To us, it was Oh So Much Better.

Finally!!! I found the recipe I have been looking for.  Thanks so much for posting it. I did make one change though.  I am not eating sugar so I substituted Splenda for the sugar.  I used about 10 packets as they say 12 packets equals a half cup. It was a little too sweet, for me, but not by much. Next time I will reduce by another couple of Splenda packets.  I am sure if regular sugar is used it is perfect!

This is the one recipe my family always requests that I bring to bbq's.  "You're making those cucumbers, right?!"  This is a great recipe that takes about 10 minutes to throw together and is a nice, cool, refreshing side for the summer cookouts.  I omit the celery seed (because I never have it on hand) and I add in a good handful of chopped fresh dill.

Perfect way to enjoy cucumbers and onions. If I am ambitious, I heat the vinegar and sugar together on the stovetop, but this is a classic as is !

07-18-16 ~ We've got a lot of cucumbers going on right now. This was a nice and refreshing recipe to use up a couple of them. I used the mandolin to slice the cukes and the sweet onion so that they would be really thin, just like my grandma used to make them. I did cut the sugar in half as we like the taste of vinegar and the tang that it adds. A very good recipe to use up an abundant garden.

Followed recipe exactly. Celery seed adds a pickling flavor. One reviewer said it was too sweet. I leveled out the sugar until it was a little below the top of my measuring cup. 
I don't have red onions on hand, but its delicious anyway. 
My step mom used to make a similar dish during the summer. Difference with hers was that it became spicy as it sat. 
Great recipe! Thanks for posting.

During cucumber season my grandma kept a margarine tub full of this on the counter.  She didn't use celery seeds so I skipped them as well.  Other than that the recipe is just like hers, perfect ratio of sugar to vinegar.   Thank you so much for posting!

Yum! Just like Grandma's. I left out the celery seed since we don't care for it. I also took another rater's advice and added fresh dill. Very fresh and summery! It was even better the next day!

This was really good and easy to make. I was looking for a new cucumber recipe that was different for us. I followed the recipe as written other then I used celery salt instead of celery seed as that is what I had on hand. We really enjoyed this.

I love this recipe, the only thing I changed was to halve the sugar as I like pickles less sweet personally.  Really good with cheese, ham, etc., or just by itself!

Love this! Everyone at work went nuts over this!
They had never had a sweet recipe and now it's the only
One they want! I had no celery seed so I just used dill and added a little black pepper. Perfect!
