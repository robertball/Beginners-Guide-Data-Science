This batter was runny and wouldnâ€™t hold together while cooking.  Wasted time and ingredients.

I've tried these twice and both times the batter was too runny. Cachapas are like pancakes and these need to be thicker--probably leaving out the milk would help. But I'm basically on my own experimenting with the right ingredients.
