I actually make this recipe in the crockpot instead of the oven. This roast beef makes the BEST french dip sandwiches. I like to layer sliced sweet onions in the bottom of the crockpot, then lay in the meat and the rest of the marinade. When I make this, we literally can't help but sneak pieces out of the crockpot.

I really liked this recipe! The roast was very tender, and it tasted great. I didn't have Montreal steak seasoning but I used the steak seasoning that I bought at Steak-n-shake. My husband loved it, too! He kept asking me when I am going to make it again so I used this recipe for venison steak, too! We both loved it! (It is best if you marinate it for the full 24 hours to help make it more tender and more flavorful, but okay if you only marinate for a few hours.) I will use this recipe often.

I used another reviewer's suggestion and did this in a slow-cooker.  I had a 2.5 lb roast, so I halved all of the other ingredients. I browned the roast first on all sides in a separate pan, and put it on top of a chopped onion in the cooker. I then heated all of the other ingredients in the pan, de-glazed the pan, then added everything to the cooker. I also added some baby carrots. Set on High for about 3 hours and it was done.

I made this with elk roast. I put the roast in a covered roasting pan with the marinade. Lined the pan with potato and carrot slices but I wont put the vegetables in there again they got way to much of the peppery seasoning.
delicious and tender roast, and excellent left overs on French dips!

Fairly easy to do and will result in a relatively fairly moist roast beef.  Meat was not the most tender, even though this was a fairly high quality meat cut.  It just provided enough taste to the roast and wasn't overpowering.  I haven't made any substitutions.  I did not roast using the marinade as some other have done, but have used the drippings from the roast for "au jus" gravy and it created just just the right flavor.

This  is a great recipe for deer or elk roasts too. I cook the roast in the marinade, remove it close to end, add some water and bisto gravy maker, best gravy ever!

This was a great recipe and VERY easy! I bought a 3lb roast and just did the same ratios on the marinade. Had extra marinade but no big deal. Baked in the oven in a dish sitting in about 1/2 the marinade at 375 for one hour. Our two girls 5 & 3 enjoyed this too.

Easy recipe, though I cut the quantity in half. My son hates roast beef, but ate more than half of this. He raved about it! My wife was very complimentary, too. I will definitely be making this again.
