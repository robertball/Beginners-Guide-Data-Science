A tasty, healthy recipe.  I listened to previous reviewers and (1) layered chopped spinach over the ricotta instead of mixing it in, (2) combined the ricotta with two eggs and (3) used three cloves of fresh garlic instead of powder.  I also sauteed the onions with some diced green bell peppers (to get more veggies in there) and used no-boil lasagna that I had on hand.  Results were great!  My boyfriend, who is a little picky, really loved it.

I made this tonight and was extremely disappointed. Took me longer to prepare. The reason it was not good was due to the spinach. It was loaded with spinach. Way too much. If u choose to make this try 3 cups spinach.

For my personal tastes I like to kick this up with the addition of a couple of cloves diced garlic, some extra oregano, and a BIG dose of Crushed Red Pepper in the sauce.

Not to be that reviewer that says, "it was good, but I changed it in such and such way and it was better...", but I have been making turkey spinach lasagna for a while now and have a pretty good recipe now. 1) I always use a 10oz box of frozen chopped spinach that I defrost and squeeze all the water out. 2) When I mix the spinach in with the ricotta, I always add an egg and a couple spoonfuls of lowfat cottage cheese (I know it sounds weird, but it's really good). 3) I also like to use jarred pasta sauce that has veggies in it, just to get that much more into my kids. Even though a whole lasagna takes a while to eat in my house, by kids are happy with the leftovers the whole time :)

I made a double batch last night and my kids are eating it up no problem, and I think it is great comfort food. I threw in 2 garlic cloves with the onions, 2 eggs with the ricotta (I've never made lasagna without egg and decided not to try it) and used baby spinach. I used Hodgson Mills ww lasagna noodles and cheap store brand sauce. I did have some problems with assembly, the spinach/ricotta was hard to spread and I ran out after 2 layers. I ran out of meat sauce as well after two layers. I skipped the top ricotta layer and meat layers (which I actually prefer to do anyway) and used some extra sauce I had in the cupboard for the top.  I think when I make it again I will not combine things - I will pour plain sauce, layer ground turkey, layer ricotta/egg mixture, lay spinach leaves across the ricotta and then sprinkle mozerella.  With these changes I will definitely make it again.

I was a little skeptical about making this lasagna since it uses fat free ricotta but it was pretty good!  I made a couple of changes though.  I used about 4 cloves of garlic instead of the garlic powder and probably only 3 cups or so of the spinach.  I think any more than that would have been way too much.  I also replaced the mushrooms with green bell pepper (I don't like mushrooms).  In a traditional lasagna, you add egg to the ricotta so that's what I did but I'm not sure I needed it since it was fat free, the cheese was already pretty soft.  Also instead of layering the mozzarella, I mixed it in with the ricotta and grated in some fresh parmesano reggiano.  I only got two layers out of it with the turkey and ricotta but it was plenty.  And, not so bad reheated the next day.

I thought this recipe was great!  I read other reviews that there wasn't enough ricotta mixture so I made sure to spread it pretty thinly and it worked out.  I also only used 3 cups of spinach and added an egg to the ricotta mixture.  Also, I eyeballed the nutmeg and went a little light on it.  Delish!

I don't eat beef, so this was a great alternative to a more traditional lasagna.  It went together quickly and easily.  Mine came out with a bit of runny liquid around the bottom, but could have easily been a mistake I made, and either way it was still very good and I will definitely be making it again!

I am giving this five stars because I tweaked it.  1.  Left out the mushrooms, personal preference.  2.  Used 20 oz italian seasoned ground turkey (omitted the italian seasoning) added fresh garlic.  3.  Used about 3 C part skim ricotta, also used reduced fat mozzarella, a couple of shakes of a 3 blend grated cheese, added 1 egg and only a sprinkle of nutmeg.  4.  Used 1-10 oz pkg of chopped frozen spinach.  Thawed in a colander, and patted dry as well as I could between paper towels, this will take a few times of between several layers of paper towels.  5.  Used a brand name premade jar sauce (chunky tomato, garlic, olive oil).  

Browned the ground turkey and onion, with 4 cloves of finely chopped garlic (omitting the garlic poweder), used a little salt and pepper at this point (turkey is very bland), then added the sauce.  Simmered the sauce for a 1/2 hour.  I used regular lasagna noodles as that is what I had in the cupboard.

Was not bland or too watery as some reviewers have stated.  This is a keeper.

Excellent recipe! Light and delicious. Like most other reviewers, I layer the spinach rather than adding to the mixture. A great go-to recipe when you're expecting company.

I doubled this recipe & it worked GREAT in a huge disposable aluminum pan like you get from a caterer (cooked about 7 extra minutes) 
I did not have whole wheat noodles but regular worked fine. 
Also used frozen spinach 2 10 oz packages, & squeeeeeezed the moisture out. perfect amount, but easy to add slowly to get the amount you like.
Also addes a 1/2 cup of grated parm to the ricotta mix. Spead thin the ration worked out great. 
Think I may add some fresh parsley next time to the sauce. Took a good bit of time, but worth it! Served 21 hungry folks (with others thing too, but, everyone got a piece with a bit left over) This was a real crowd pleaser.

Overpowering Italian spice, suggest reduce amount. No fat ricotta tastes chalky. All ingredients didn't fit into a 9 x 13 dish. Nothing special here.

So good! I used boiled chicken instead of ground turkey and also added in 3 cloves of garlic and some canned tomatoes. Other than, I kept everything the same and will definitely make it again. Looking forward to eating the leftovers tonight!

This was a delicious meal.  Made it for the first time and it was easy to make.  I ran out of the turkey sauce so I thought it wouldn't turn out good, but it was very good and there was plenty of liquid.  I used one bunch of spinach and that was the perfect amount.

It is a great recipe.  I added a tablespoon of brown sugar to the sauce and used no bake noodles in place of whole wheat noodles.  Good flavor.  Will make again.

This was just average for me. I followed some of the other recs like adding only 3 cups spinach on top of the ricotta layer (which I mixed with 2 eggs), and added 3 garlic cloves. I only added 1.5 Tablespoons of italian seasoning and thought that was a bit much--3 Tablespoons would have ruined the dish. I think I will continue looking for another alternative to lasagna.

Overall, it turned out pretty well!  Everyone enjoyed it.  I might add a bit more ricotta next time because it didn't seem to be enough when I was assembling, but that probably makes it healthier too.

My husband doesn't care for lasagna but couldn't stop raving about this dish. He finished off a second helping! I left out the spinach, mushroom and onion because I didn't have any on hand. I used Prego meat sauce and it was delicious.

My family and I loved this recipe!  I couldn't find the wheat noodles so just used the regular ones.  The only other change was I added diced red bell pepper with the onion.   It was so yummy and I will definitely make it again.  To the Recipe Box it goes!

My boyfriend said it was the best lasagna he has ever had!! My bf considers himself a food snob but loved this meal and definitely wants to keep it in rotation. I did add fresh garlic when cooking the onions. Since its only him and myself we have plenty of leftovers for lunch or dinner. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is easy to make and delicious.  The lasagna maintains the traditional lasagna flavor, while having more veggies, fewer calories and less fat.  I will be making this again.  The only changes I made were I added a can of diced tomatoes and did not pre cook the noodles.

Delicious! But, I used marinara instead of tomato sauce and the ricotta didn't really taste like anything so I might season it next time.

First time making lasagna and it was delicious.  Looking at other reviews, added one egg to the ricotta mix and only used 3 cups spinach. I had to add more ricotta to my last third of ricotta mix to have enough. Next time may reduce the nutmeg to a sprinkle and use less Italian spice mix.  My husband loved it and said it was one of my top dinners.

Great recipe! I used spinach noodles and chopped fresh baby spinach and added it to the ricotta per the recipe. I layered the spinach ricotta mixture in half the pan and used just spinach for the other half. Both halves turned out great! I used a small amount of mozzarella and parmesan in the half without ricotta so it was very light- very little cheese. It was not runny at all, I baked it for 10 minutes covered and 30 uncovered.

I loved it; I substituted 1% small-curd cottage cheese for the ricotta and fresh rather than powdered garlic. I chopped the spinach (well, had my husband do it) quite fine, and added a bit of cayenne pepper for some zip.

Made this recipe with my husband and had some family over. We absolutely loved it. Added to minced garlic gloves and cut down a little on the spinach because of a review I previously read but it would have been fined if used all 6 cups instead I did 4. Overall great recipe

This recipe is delicious. I used a jar of pasta sauce and frozen spinach. I thawed, drained, and squeezed out the extra water from the spinach before mixing it with the ricotta. Also, I added red chili flakes to make it spicy. Scrumptious.

This was really good for the first lasagna I have ever made. I left out the spinach and used oregano and basil because that is what I had in the cabinet no italian seasoning. Did it with regular white lasagna noodles not wheat and it turned out really good. My kids really liked it and they are very picky. Will use this recipe again.

The whole family loved this recipe. We've been trying to cut back on gluten, so I used brown rice lasagna pasta. If you haven't tried this kind of pasta, do so. The flavor and texture are excellent.

good but in my opinion way too much nutmeg, the spinach should be cooked with the sauce and taste as you add the Italian seasoning it can be a bit much. next time i make it im going to saute garlic with the onions. and add salt to the sauce as well as the spinach.  I may or may not even use the nutmeg it was all i could taste. over all good choice im just going to make these changes

Way, way, way tooooo much italian seasoning! The recipe calls for 3 tablespoons, I put only 4 teaspoons and it was still way too spicy. Maybe it is because my italian seasoning was homemade? anyway great recipe but next time I will use less italian seasoning...

Good but not as flavorful as I would have hoped for.  Make sure to season the meat and sauce to ensure it is delicious...for all the ingredients and seasonings it listed, I'm surprised it didn't pop more in flavor.  Hopefully leftovers will be better!

I used my homemade spaghetti sauce that I made with ground turkey the day before. I also doubled the sauce and ricotta cheese and the mozzarella cheese. Mine, like other reviewers said, came out a little watery. Enough to where it diluted the sauce a little bit I thought. Still good. I think the spinach made it a little watery. Next time I will use frozen spinach and pat it dry before I put it in the lasagna. But I would make it again. I also like red pepper flakes in my sauce.

Great flavor, but I had way too much sauce.  I was wondering if the noodles coud be dry when assembled to soak up the extra.  I would tweak the seasonings next time too and save time and layer the spinach.

This was a great, healthy alternative to the traditional lasagna. 1 serving is more than enough to fill a larger person like myself up. I did cut back on the Italian seasoning a little though. I will make this again.

I didn’t add the spinach. I used ricotta cheese and a half cup of cottage cheese. The nutmeg in the mix gives it a good flavor. I also added a little kick with some crushed pepper.

I made this recipe after my daughter insisted that I not use beef...which I prefer. Having said that, it was delicious and flavorful!  The 3 tablespoons of Italian seasoning probably made the huge difference since Turkey is fairly bland.
Everyone went back for more and I will make it again.

I used regular whole milk ricotta cheese instead of fat free. I also used vegetable spice instead of Italian and really preferred that! Great flavor! Always a great dish to share!

Everyone in the family loved it! Plus my boyfriend’s family. I did follow some of the comments advice. I also doubled the recipe, it was enough to feed about 6 people. I added egg to the ricotta, and used italian seasoned ground turkey and omitted the italian seasoning. I totally forgot the spinach, but it tasted great without it anyway, but the next time I cook the dish I’ll be sure to layer it above the ricotta instead of mixing it in.

I doubled this recipe for a big family dinner, and made a couple of changes.  Instead of the tomato sauce, I used jarred pasta sauce, but still added some Italian seasoning to it. Instead of fresh, I squeezed the liquid out of frozen spinach.  I used fresh garlic, and threw in about half a pound of ground Italian sausage (I know, I know, but it adds so much flavor!)  I assembled it as directed, then thew some grated Parmesan cheese in with the topping.   It was super easy and the entire family loved it.

I made a few changes  but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. I used regular lasagna noodles because the grocery store I went to didnt have whole wheat lasagna noodles. I also took the advice of several reviews and used only 3 cups of spinach. But I will definitely be making this again. It was delicious!!!!

I liked it. I would change a few things though. I thought there was too much spinach, but it was actually the perfect amount. I would do less Italian seasoning and more turkey.

Great twist on lasagna! I made it for 6 people and i used 15 oz of ricotta because I felt there wasn't enough in comparison to the spinach. I also might put a bit more turkey meat next time, but it had great flavor!

This recipe was fantastic! I fed it to my 19 month old, and she couldn't get enough! Because we feed a baby, we went whole milk ricotta and whole milk mozzarella which made it really good. Also, I always feel ricotta is skimped on most recipes, so we just threw in the whole container, which is about 1 and 2/3 cups instead of just 1 cup. Will definitely be making this again.

There was way too much spinach and not enough ricotta filling. I added two eggs to the ricotta to give more texture and used fresh garlic, as well as a spicy garlic marinara to give more flavor to the recipe.

I will make this again with some tweaks. 
I like my lasagna to be saucier.
Also, I made it with a pasta sauce instead of just plain tomato sauce,  added some chopped garlic and Parmesan cheese on top. I also added another half cup or so of mozzarella to make it look a bit better.
Honestly, I'd probably thin the sauce a bit,  add more spices, and use a smaller pan to avoid spreading things too thin.

I ground the chicken I used in a food processor and also used my previously canned tomatoe made from scratch with fresh tomatoes from my garden. I added 5 minutes to the cooking time to brown the top layer of cheese. Bon Apitite!

I melted the ricotta cheese with the meat sauce. Then i layered it:
 - meat sauce (to prevent sticking) 
- noodles
- meat sauce
- noodles
- meat sauce
- thick layer of cheddar cheese
I also chopped up the spinach and added it to the meat sauce. Fresh chopped garlic was also added to meat sauce. 
Turned out Great!!!

This was my first time making a lasagna. I'm not much of a cook but enjoy trying new dishes. I followed the directions exactly except I used a package of frozen spinach, thawed, and squeeeezed it so all the moisture was gone...I seasoned the ground turkey while cooking it because I just can't imagine not seasoning my meat. My boyfriend is more interested in the way a dish LOOKS than the way it tastes (odd)... luckily, this came out the oven picture perfect, like a cheesy heavenly work of art!..and tasted just as good as it looked! I burned my mouth because I didn't let it cool down, but I didn't care! Just kept eating it! My only regret is I didn't bring any to work for lunch...

It came out perfect.  I kicked it up a notch with a few cloves of minced garlic and sauteed along with the onion. I also seasoned the turkey meat while browning for more flavor. I used 3 cups of fresh baby spinach. Used 24 oz Jar of Prego Sauce with Mushrooms which is all I had on hand. Cooked covered for 25 mins and uncovered for remaining 10 mins. It came out delicious! My 23 yr old son went back for 2nd & 3rd serving. This simple recipe will definitely become a regular staple on the menu.

The flavor of this dish was absolutely fantastic and light. The lasagna itself was quite runny, but I chalk that up to me using canned leaf spinach instead of fresh. Also using one 13oz can of spinach was more than enough roughage, I wouldn't add the full amount the recipe called for. Also more ricotta cheese is necessary as I ran out on the last layer. Tastes fantastic with zucchini squash added into the sauce and meat layer. I will definitely make this again with some fresh spinach, but I have to finish all the frozen leftovers first!

A wonderful and healthy lasagne that held up PERFECTLY when done. This would be great for company.  I put it together in the morning and made it for dinner in the evening.  Turned out perfectly.
