I would love to make this recipe, but one thing stops me. The Oyster sauce. I am very allergic to shell fish. Is there another ingredient I can use  instead?

I used boiled egg noodles (less greasy). Doubled the marinade and sauce measurements and thickened with cornstarch. My kids and husband loved it and were fighting for leftovers for lunch this morning.

Pretty good. Iâ€™d like to substitute shrimp for the chicken. Portions are a little small for our big family , so I doubled .
