As it is written, this is a bland mess. However, the thought behind it is good so I took it a few steps further. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic, 6 stalks of asparagus cut in 1 inch lengths, a small yellow squash sliced, some par boiled baby carrots and a cup of broccoli florets.

Saute all the garlic and veggies together until they are heated through then continue as the recipe is written.

This recipe was bland. The sauce was heavy and, as originally submitted, way too much for the amount of veggies and pasta.

I read all of the reviews and made the changes accordingly.  I still have to tweak the consistency, thinning it out as it still is rather a "glob".  The taste and ease of making it was there though.  What I did was use a carton of mushrooms, a  bunch of green onions,  a whole green and red pepper, a few stalks of celery with the inner stalks and tops, a frozen bag of peas and a bag of broccoli (thawed).  Next time I would use fresh, not frozen broccoli, that's what helped turn it to mush.  Some crunch would be nice.  Omitted the ham.  Added some pepper.  Using 8 oz. of spaghetti, this amount of veggies was plenty, it's just the consistency that needs to be worked on.  I hate to say adding heavy cream might do it but then it's not something you would eat every day.

Ok this is really good. With some changes. The amount of pasta is way to little, I used about a pound of pasta. The cream cheese needs to be softened before you put it in the pan. It will incorporate much easier. I added extra milk since it was really thick as is. I also added minced garlic, zucchini, fresh mushrooms instead of canned, carrot sticks,onions, and tomatoes. I didn't have any red bell pepper so I just used green. And since I added extra milk I used extra parm. I topped it with diced tomatoes and green onions. Very tasty recipe. Thanks.

The sauce was far too pasty. It would be better with half the cream cheese.

I gave this a 4 because it truly does need a lot of revisions--I used a ton more vegetables--a 16 oz package of frozen broccoli, cauliflower and carrots, a cup of frozen peas, a cup of frozen green beans, half of a fresh red pepper, a can of mushrooms--and a pound of angel hair pasta.  So I cooked the vegetables in some canola oil and made the sauce in a seperate pan and boiled the pasta in a seperate pan.  I also added garlic and onion to the vegetable mixture and the sauce.  Also, I added basil and oregano to the sauce too.  So the cream cheese idea is a good base, but you definitely need to jazz the recipe up a bit.  Also, I don't see the need for all the butter--I used about 1 tbsp of canola oil to saute my veggies and they were delicious!  And I cannot even IMAGINE this sauce on 4 oz. of pasta because we had enough for 1 lb of pasta--but if you like a lot of sauce, you may want to use about 3/4 of a pound of pasta.  Overall--good base of a recipe, just need to add a lot more stuff--but in the end, it's great!

It was really good!! The sauce came out great. I used fresh mushrooms and skipped the ham, so I had to season it more. I added minced garlic and cilantro, and I was glad I did--added a little kick.

Tasty and very easy.  I had a ham steak and several peppers to use up and found this recipe that used both.  I didn't have mushrooms but did have an oriental eggplant which worked nicely.  This is kind of a kitchen sink recipe - I think it would work with most veggies you might have on hand.  I had to add extra milk since it really thickened up fast.  I would make this again.

this will be one of those reviews where you'll wonder why i bothered since i really didn't make this recipe, but thought i'd share anyway. i basically had the same ingredients on hand as the reviewer caliloo, so i followed her advice. i sauteed a little shallot, garlic and onion along with par-microwaved carrots, asparagus, broccoli and squash. i only had about half a block of cream cheese, so i cut down on the milk. and i used some leftover rotisserie chicken. i salt and peppered it, threw in some red pepper flakes and dried basil (might leave that one out next time), and used extra parm. it turned out pretty well; i think a little white wine would be good in there and as well as shrimp, if you have it.

I thought it was too thick, even after I added several extra glugs of milk.  I'd suggest only using 4 oz of cream cheese.  but it was a quick and easy dinner.  it is a good way to get the family to eat veggies.

I used regular onions instead of green since it was what I had on hand, and used double the red peppers since I didn't have any green.  My husband and I don't like mushrooms and left those out.  We thought it was great!  I always add tons of spices and needed alot more spaghetti for the two of us than the recipe called for.  But I will definitely repeat!  It was great!

I thought this was great!! I left out the mushrooms because I didn't have any and I added about 1-2 tsp fresh minced garlic. It's a bit rich with the cream cheese, but still VERY good!!! The only thing I would suggest, besides adding some garlic to give it some more flavor, is to at least double (if not triple) the amount of pasta you use. I used spiral noodles instead of spaghetti. I doubled the amount it called for and I still could have used more noodles. It really makes a lot of sauce! I also kind of wanted something crunchy in this. Maybe add some chopped celery or something along that line at the end. I made mine more like a warm pasta salad since I used the spiral noodles. Maybe that's why I wanted something crunchy in it. lol  Good recipe! Give it a try!!!

easy - very tasty - I did use fresh mushooms and didn't mix in the parmesan - but left it for everyone to top individually...

I sauteed onions, garlic, ham, crushed red pepper, and Italian seasoning. Then added cream cheese and milk and made the sauce (didn't measure). I added the canned shrooms and a bag of nuked and drained frozen veggies(broccoli, carrot, snap pea, and pepper medley) with the cooked pasta. I used more pasta than called for. Quick and easy weeknight meal for when you don't feel like cooking much. Will probably make something similar again when I have leftover ham to use up.

A good way to use up leftover ham.  I too used more (whole wheat) pasta then was called for and I used fresh mushrooms.  Although it was pretty good, there was no real "wow" factor that would compel me to make this again.

I agree.  This recipe needs a lot more vegetables and a little tweaking.  I used the veggies I had on hand (aspagagus, broccoli, bell peppers, cauliflower, onions, carrots.  Sugar peas would be fantastic!) and added fresh minced garlic and a few drops of tobasco (not enough for spice just gives it a fuller flavor) to the sauce and poured it over pasta and grilled chicken.  It was a lot more filling than anticipated and my young kids ate all their veggies!  They wanted to eat it again the next day and again a few days later.  BONUS!  This seems like a very versatile recipe and one my family will enjoy for years to come.

Delicious! I added 3 cloves garlic, approx 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 sprinkles crushed red pepper and some cherry tomatoes halved. Also, omitted the mushrooms for my hubby who doesn't like them. Going to have this many more times in the future. So easy and not many ingredients!

I doubled the pasta for the amount of sauce and it was just right. I had 8 oz of country vegetable spreadable cream cheese to use up and it was delicious. I had red and orange peppers, onions and cooked peas. I also added 1 cup of milk to get the sauce the right consistency. This was delicious and my husband is a fan. I made this as a side dish but I will add ham to the leftovers for a meal. Thanks for this one.

Good, quick and easy. Added garlic and seasoning and less butter. Prefect weeknight meal for the kids.
