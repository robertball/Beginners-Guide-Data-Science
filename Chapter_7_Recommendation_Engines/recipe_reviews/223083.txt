Instead of sauteing the onion and garlic in water, I sauteed it in butter. I used Baby Ray's barbeque sauce in this recipe. I topped each helping of barbeque tuna with a slice of sharp cheddar cheese. I was seriously taking a big chance on this recipe because I wasn't sure that my family would like this......but they did. They ate every bit of it. Great quick lunch.

I was so worried that the BBQ would taste fishy and no one would like it but the fam didn't even notice it was tuna. Taste and texture were awesome and took so little time to make... I've got a new favorite tuna recipe!!!

I made this recipe it was delicious. I added cheese and put it in the broiler for about a minute and a half. All of the flavors combined was orgasmic. We will make this again at my home.

This was perfect! I've been pescatarian (only eat fish) for quite some time now and I certainly missed barbecue pork! Now, not only is this recipe simple and good for those on a budget, but it tastes wonderful. However, I used minced garlic from a jar and onion powder. I also added some mustard powder and chili powder for more kick. Baby Ray's sauce works best since is had sweetness to it. There was no fish taste at all either! Phenomenal recipe - Thank you!

This was absolutely amazing!  I'm not going to lie, the thought of putting BBQ on tuna sounded a little funny, but WOW!  It honestly amazed me!  It is a great addition to my Lentin season!!!

definitely a lot better then it sounds at first. like some of the other reviews I used a little bit of butter and added some oil so the onions would just saute and not brown. definitely will try this again.

Soo good! Never would have thought of this on my own. I don't eat "meat" (pork, beef, chicken), so this is a yummy alternative & you can't even really tell it's not pork! For a "healthier"
version I substituted a bed of spinach for the rolls, and it was delish.

I've been trying to expand my repertoire of tuna recipes, and this was a fabulous addition! The tuna has a rich, meaty taste that my family loved. We didn't have coleslaw, but served it with sliced tomatoes. It would also be great with pickle spears. Some of my kids spread the rolls with cream cheese before stuffing them with the tuna mixture, and really enjoyed the combo.

It was really good. My boyfriend could not stop raving. He even went for seconds! I made mine as a wrap and added spinach and lettuce with vegan cheese. YUM!

I made this recipe to a  T.  I was very surprised with the outcome. I am going to try it again, but use grilled tuna steaks in place of the canned tuna. I think it will be even more liked pulled pork bbq without the pork. Great recipe! Thanks for sharing it.

a really good way to disguise tuna, not that it needs disguising, but it's something different if you have cans in your cupboard that nevertheless don't sound appetizing. 

Basically, the recipe works by barreling over the fish flavor with the steak seasoning (I used Badia brand), which gives it an all-purpose savory meat flavor, then doubling down on the deception with warmed-up barbecue sauce while distracting with fresh sauteed onions and the punch of garlic. 

Very clever, very good...if it's what you have in your cupboard and you want to thin your tuna stocks, absolutely give it a try.

Absolutely delicious!  I will definitely continue to make it again, and again.  Very easy to prepare and if I hadn't put the tuna in the skillet myself,  I would swear there was no tuna in it.  I did use albacore.  Thank You.

very tasty. I turned my into tacos (simply substituting the bun for a corn tortilla). I think it could use some coleslaw or something cold added on top. Either way, yum!

These were delicious but they were a little zippy for my liking, I will do less than 1 tbsp of steak seasoning next time.  The sauce was also a tad runny, I will do a little less than 1 cup next time.

Not bad.  We used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ.  The kids all liked it.  My husband said it was even better cold the next day over lettuce.

The one time I needed BBQ sauce and didn't have any.  Couldn't believe we were out so I subbed teriyaki sauce with siracha to taste.  I let it sit in the frig for several hours and had it for lunch.  My family said it was fantastic.  I used albacore tuna in oil that I drained.  I used the drained oil to saute the onion and garlic in.  I let the onions and garlic sit for 20 minutes with the heat off to infuse the taste into the oil better.  I then pressed the the onion/garlic mixture through fine mesh.  I mixed the onion/garlic oil with melted butter and liberally applied to the inside of pita pockets.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.

Love this recipe! It taste wonderful! The only tip I would give is to use a nice firm tuna like Albacore or Yellowfin in the can (water or olive oil) instead of a cheaper quality tuna.

I made this filling and served it in mushroom caps and we were really surprised how much we liked it.  Although we agree the tuna is really just a vehicle
for really good bbq sauce.

Amazing! Cheaper than pork and almost can't tell it's not except for the texture.  Will make again for sure.

I'll be honest, the concept of putting BBQ sauce on tuna didn't appeal to me at first. But this recipe is awesome. There's very little fishy taste and you can tweak the recipe to your like very easily. Those who don't eat pork might find this recipe useful.

Easy and good.  My husband and boys couldn't guess what meat it was.  I'll be making it again.  Perfect use for 1/2 bottle of barbecue sauce that was in my fridge and also Costco size pack of tuna cans.
