This was a relatively good recipe. I followed the instructions to the letter.   I was expecting something more "Asiany", I guess.  The ginger I had was a bit old which could have affected the flavor of the roast.  It was perfectly acceptable though.

The broth was excellent.  Next time I would add more carrots.   Those were fantastic too.  This would be the one change I would make.  That and fresh ginger!

Since the description in this box asks specifically if I made changes, I will answer the question with yes. I didn't use an oven bag. I coated everything in a Ziploc and then dumped it into the slow cooker. I cooked everything on low for about 8 hours. For the last hour, I put instant rice in the slow cooker and let it cook and absorb the liquid. Worked great!

For those who said they want more Asian flavor, a good, economical way to do that without having to change any recipe much, is to add Chinese 5 Spice Powder. It's excellent with beef. Other items you can add include Gochujang or red chile pods for heat (as in Kung Pao Beef), Orange Peel, Mirin or Dry Sherry, and a few Tablespoons of Hoisin.  To really flavor the beef, cook it the day before.  Put it in the refrigerator to get cold.  Slice, and let the slices sit in the cooked juices overnight.  Heat and serve.  You might want to reduce the juices in a sauce pan to serve over the beef as a sauce. My personal preference is to not use cooking bags.  They're expensive for what little they do, make a roast look terrible, and you lose precious steam pressure which helps tenderize the roast.

Very good. I also added mushrooms. I unexpectedly had company over the night I made it and they loved it too.

I made this recipe exactly as directed and we were very disappointed.  It needs more flavor. Very bland.
