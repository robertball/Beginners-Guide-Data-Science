I make this recipe for the exact same reason the previous reviewer, Dancing Cook from NC, does!  It is my "go-to" recipe for bringing to new mothers, or families in need.  However, I substitute corn bread stuffing mixed with melted butter in place of the fried onions and cheddar cheese.  Trust me, the dish is still rich and satisfying.  Also, I use green peppers and fresh celery instead of pimento and celery seed simply because I tend to have these ingredients on hand.  Everyone who I have made this recipe for loves it and is very appreciative!

I have used this recipe for YEARS without the onion rings, to bring to sick or injured neighbors or new moms.  I make several at a time without the cheese and freeze them in those new disposable plastic dishes that can go from freeser to oven (read the instructions on the plastic ware --preheating is REQUIRED).I take the still frozen dish and 1 cup of cheese to the sick person's home and tell them (or their family) how to cook it, and they can choose to use it WHENEVER they want.  This dish takes about the same amount of time to cook in the oven whether frozen or thawed before putting in the oven.  Great dish!

I have made a version of this with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving for years.  I use 4 c turkey and 2 c celery (instead of the seed).  I also add 4 hard boiled eggs, cut up and 1 can cream of mushroom soup.  Mix everything together the night before, except cheese, almonds and french fried onions.  Refrigerate overnight to let the flavors connect.  Then cook for 20 minutes at 400 before adding the "toppings" and cook for another 15 minutes unitl bubbly and brown.  Excellent!!  If you don't have french fried onions, 1 c crushed potato chips work well too.

This is one of the most delicious casseroles I have made.  Not only did my family love it, but it is easy to put together.  It would be great for a dinner party because it can be prepared early in the day, and then baked when I need it.  I did serve it over rice, as noted, with a salad and good European type bread.  Yum!

This was good, but it did not come out like I expected from the reviews. This recipe is more like a coated meat with cheese and fried onions than a casserole, so you definelty need side dishes.

This was good.  My son loved it! I thought it was a little heavy.  I will try making it next time with 1/2 or 3/4 c of mayo vs. 1 cup.  I also think adding broccoli into this or serving it over it would be good.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe; prepared and cooked much more quickly than I anticipated.  I tweaked it a bit:  Doubled the recipe, baked 3 lbs. chicken in chicken broth, and substituted dill weed for the celery.  Still delicious!  Will definitely use this one again in the future.

This was absolutely delish!!!! I made it for company and everyone raved about it!! Great crunch and flavor. The only thing I did different from the recipe was I baked the casserole for 20 minutes without the french-fried onion rings on top and then added them for the last 10 minutes of baking - otherwise, for sure they would have burned.  This one is definitely a keeper!  Yum!

Really easy, quick and tasted great.  You can tweak this so many ways too.  I made it as directed and served it with broccoli.  The next day I mixed them together, tasty! Would add broccoli at the beginning next time.  Mushrooms or black olives would be good too.

All I can say is Yum!  It was easy to make and as previous reviewers said, the combination of flavors was great.  I wouldn't change a thing, except to double the recipe.  For a family of four, there weren't enough leftovers!

Very good and easy.   My one minor change was to use some finely chopped red sweet pepper in place of the jar pimientos.

I was really surprised how good this was with so little ingredients. I didn't have pimentos, so I used jarred roasted red bell peppers. I also boiled my chicken so it would be good and moist.

The reviews are all over the place on this recipe.  I read comments about it being bland and dry, neither of which I found to be the case.  The flavor is good, but the texture ended up being runny, and I followed the recipe to the letter.  The recipe author tells you to watch the onions because they may brown quickly, and mine were completely browned at 20 minutes, so I did cover with foil. After the 30 minutes cooking time, I tented the casserole with foil and cooked for an additional 15 minutes hoping that the liquid would cook out, but that didn't work.  I'm wondering if the mayo liquified; if I were to make this again, I'd probably cut the mayo in half.  We have some leftovers, and they will be eaten, but I'm not so sure I'll make this again.

This was fair,at least it was edible.It just didn't turn my crank is all.I couldn't find the french fried onion rings in the store so I didn't bother with it,that certainly couldn't have made much of a difference.I doubt that I'll be trying this one again,there's better recipes out there for chicken than this one.

It was nice but not up to five stars, my neighbor cooks out of boxes and would have really enjoyed this recipe!  SOrry, not a keeper.
