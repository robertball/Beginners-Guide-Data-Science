YUM! This is a wonderful way to take a classic like grilled cheese and give it a "gourmet" twist. I love pears and brie cheese so I had to give this a try and even my husband who was a bit skeptical gave it a thumbs up. Next time I might add a little proscuitto. Thanks for a great recipe Chef John!

My vegetarian daughter was coming for lunch and I thought I would do a search for Brie and found this recipe.  Well we made it exactly as called for and it was a terrific hit!  I didn't realize it was Chef John's recipe until I came back to write the review, Bravo Chef John!

Loved this recipe! I actually added prosciutto ham and used sourdough bread. It was amazing and my husband and 4 year old loved it as well.

I made this the other night for the family. They are not picky eaters but this is a strange but wonderful combination and we all enjoyed this recipe. I even went way out of my way to purchase some bakery sourdough bread. I will make this again for sure.

Delicious!! If you can't find Brie cheese at your local grocery store, try the spreadable Cr√®me de Brie...still makes for a great sandwich!

I quite liked this fancier twist on a grilled cheese. Due to dietary problems, I used brie instead of the recommended bread. It was tasty, and the pears were delicious with the brie. However, it's not a recipe I would make frequently. It's a nice twist on the original, but I felt like it was a bit too fancy and savory to eat on a regular basis. Every once in a while, though, it would be a delicious treat.

This was a great idea for a sammich that I never thought about! Two of my favorite things Brie and pears! I used a sprinkle of salt and Italian seasoning and it was so delicious. This will be a regular easy dinner for me on my late work nights.

I used dried thyme and my pears were hard (but tasty!), so I am not sure how much it affected the dish. I feel like the pear taste was not prominent enough, and that the pears didn't stick well to the bread and kept falling out, so I couldn't really add any more pear.

It sounded like a good idea, but the pears were so mild that they didn't add much to the sandwich... beyond slipperiness!  I think I'll be keeping my grilled cheese fruit free!

Fantastic! My family loves this, both as is, and with thinly-sliced ham added.
