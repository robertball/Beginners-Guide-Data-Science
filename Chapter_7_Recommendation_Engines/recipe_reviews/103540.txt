The cookies turned out great!  I did tweak the recipe a bit though.  It seemed a bit too dry, so I added an extra egg and about a teaspoon of water.  Just for fun I added some M & Ms to some of the cookies, and they taste great!  But they are great without too!!!  :o)

The cookies tasted good but they were way too dry.  If I ever make this recipe again I'll add a whole stick of butter and another egg but I don't think I'll bother to again.

I used butter the first time and found them a little too dry.  I used vegetable oil instead of butter the next time. It was much better and the taste wasn't any different.  I used to make a similiar cookie with smooth peanut butter on a much larger scale at a coffee shop in Las Vegas where I worked.  It was always a big hit!

I followed other recommendations to add an extra egg.  Also, PB in my area only comes in 16 oz. jars, not 18 so I threw in a couple dollops of creamy PB.  Cookies took a bit longer to cook but they came out moist, chewy, and tanned and firm on the top and edges.  I think they'll go down well at my class potluck because they're not overwhelmingly sweet.

Easy recipe, good ingredients...two bits of a so so issue. #1 Very crumbly...very. Makes sure to really work each little ball smooth before placing it on the cookie sheet and pressing with a fork. I used a small scooper and my 1st tray was very crumbly when I picked them up while still warm & after they were cooled. Totally work the cookie dough good. And possibly add either 1/4 cup more butter OR an additional egg for better binding. #2 even though there was 1 small 18 jar of peanut butter to the batch...I thought it needed just a tad more possibly 1/2 cup more. That's just me. But other then that.

I thought it was great just the way it is written.  I did not have the dryness problem others mentioned but will keep it in mind when I make them again.

These cookies are on the dry side and crumble apart very easily.

I will make it again using an additional egg and 2 tbsp of butter. Also, baked in gas oven so went 9 minutes instead of 10.

Last night I had a sweet tooth and thought i had everything needed for this recipe.  When I checked my pantry, the cake mix I had was a Betty Crocker mix with 15.25 oz not the required 18.25 oz.  I quickly went online to see what substitutions I could make for the deficit.  It just so happened that I had PB2 powdered chocolate peanut butter, but had only used it for smoothies.  So I figured no time like the present and used 1/4 cup and 2 tbsps of that, 2 eggs, half stick of butter and 1/4 cup of oil, and mini chocolate chips as others had suggested.  They tasted pretty good out of the oven, but decided to take another's suggestion to put a slice of bread in with them to keep them moist, as they seemed rather dense when cooled.  This morning they are soft and still good.  Thanx ladies for all the help!
