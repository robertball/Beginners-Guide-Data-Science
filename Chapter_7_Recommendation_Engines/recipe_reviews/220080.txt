These are good, but the filling is even better the next day!  I'd suggest making it in advance, then fill your mushrooms when you're ready to bake them.  I used baby portabello mushrooms. *I made these again as written but left the breadcrumbs out to stay with a low carb diet--they turned out perfectly and are delicious!!

I made this appy recipe as a entree for dinner by using large portabella mushrooms and we loved it! I doubled the minced garlic as usual with any recipe I make. I also used freshly grated peccorino romano as we prefer the rich taste over parmesan. Thank you, Johnsonville!

Came out great!
I substituted a packet of Italian dressing mix for the garlic/parsley/lemon juice bc that's what I had on hand. Was very pleased with the recipe, a big hit!

My boyfriend loves these and practically begs me to make them. I don't discard the stems, I chop them up and put them in the sausage mixture while cooking. They disappear really fast and other than using the stem, I follow the recipe exactly the way it calls for.

This is one of the best recipes for stuffed mushrooms that I've tried.  Ever.  In my life.  Thankfully, no one in my house likes mushrooms, so they were all mine!  I followed the directions closely except, I didn't process, top separately, etc.  No time for that and didn't want to dirty up the food processor.  I just dumped everything (except the mushroom caps) in a mix and mixed well.  Crammed as much into each cap as I possible could, and baked from there.  The recipe was INCREDIBLE!

I liked it and my kids loved it! I made a little change, I didn't use bread crumbs and add extra parmesan cheese. Thanks for  another good recipe.

I made a mistake and bought hot Italian sausage so I wasn't sure hot it would work out, but the cream cheese smoothed the heat and they were delicious!  I can see this filling in many other applications such as my stuffed shells.  Thank you Johnsonville, another winner!

I have a recipe that is very similar, although I use ground sausage and add chopped imitation crab meat, and I skip the lemon.  I also use both parmesean and mozerella cheese.  Big hit!  My husband hosts his poker group twice a year, and these are expected now!

The stuff mushrooms are amazing. I tried the other Johnsonville stuffed mushroom recipe and this one is by far the best. I would not direct you towards any other stuff mushroom recipe as this is superior.

Quick and simple and very easy to customize with your own spices, cheeses, and proteins. As a vegan, it's nice to be able to easily sub in vegan sausage or even crumbled tofu. YUM.

My family has asked for this every time we have a special meal! My husband LOVES this! I keep the recipe the same for the most part sometimes I try different mushrooms and playing with spices- it's always a winner at my house.

Very easy and delicious.  I used mild italian sausage, and fresh chopped basil instead.  Also stuffed button mushrooms.  Took to a potluck party and there were none leftover.

Made half the recipe and should have made a full recipe because they went fast! The cream cheese added such a nice texture I didn't expect. Definitely will make again

These were good but I thought they would be a bit creamier. Next time I will try adding in another cheese like cheddar.

This was a great recipe for stuffed mushrooms!! It does make a lot of stuffing so have plenty of mushrooms. We had a few left over ( there were only two of us) and they were just as good the next day. Thank you for a great recipe!!

These are delicious! The only modification I made was to finely chop the mushroom stems and saute them with the sausage. That made too much stuffing for the mushroom caps, but oh, well, the stuffing mix is great on bagels!

I love these- just like gigi used to make! I used spicy sausage, omitted the parsley and used parmesan-reggiano cheese. I ended up having extra so I added the stuffing mixture to baby bell peppers, the small sweet ones and I loved the combination of flavors.

This was excellent!! I misread the recipe and added the Parmesan to the meat mixture, but it still turned out just fine.  I also added a little of cayenne pepper to give it a little kick, and I also added paprika at the top.. I will for sure make this again!!

After preparing the mushrooms, I baked them in the pan on a bar-be-que pit over mesquite coals.  The smokiness added a wonderful flavor and my guests were over the moon with the appetizers!!

It turned out really well. I added a dash of sage, some dried onion, and chopped stems into the sausage.

I've been meaning to make italian sausage stuffed mushrooms for a long time. This was the perfect recipe. Easy and delicious. One of the reviews I read said it needed salt. I am very glad I stuck to the recipe and didn't add any. I always like to get my Italian husband's feedback when making these kinds of recipes, as he is a great cook, and he was very impressed. Thanks for this recipe. Give it a try!

Easy recipe and everyone raved about them! It was my first time eating let alone making stuffed mushrooms. I added some green bell pepper and onion while cooking the sausage. Will definitely be making again!

I think this recipe was a bit bland. It needs a bit of salt and maybe some pepper too. As others suggested, I chopped the stalks and cooked them with the Italian sausage. I will think about it to make them next time, but if I do, I will add the aforementioned ingredients and probably a bit more garlic or think of something else.

First time I have ever tried stuffing mushrooms.  Added garlic when frying the meat and then used canned Parmesan cheese (as opposed to grating fresh).  Stuffed mushrooms are wife’s favorite and she loved these.

I will make these again but with small differences. These are easy to make and I really loved the idea of this. Since my family loves garlic I kind of went overboard on that part and that was the predominant taste. So next time I will go a bit lighter on the garlic! I used turkey hot Italian sausage as pork is so fatty and it didn’t bother me to change that up because it was still Italian suausage. I forgot about the bread crumbs and didn’t have any on hand so I omitted that, which I think is just fine. I honestly don’t think the little bit of bread crumbs asked would have made that much of a difference. I also didn’t have fresh parsley so I had to use dried parsley flakes. I bought huge white mushrooms so the filling only filled up 13  instead of 24, which was fine with me because there were only 4 of us eating them. Oh! I chopped up the stems and added them to the mixture, per some other reviews.The verdict: everyone agreed the garlic was too much but otherwise liked them. My husband generally isn’t overly crazy about mushrooms but thought these were “quite tasty”. For myself, I thought them to be bland. I will definitely use fresh parsley next time and maybe add another fresh herb to it. It just  needs to be spiced up a bit. The sausage didn’t have much of a taste, which surprised me because we always use turkey Italian sausage and think it tastes great. There’s definitely many things that could be added to this to change up the flavor depending on one’s taste.

I was very surprised with this recipe it was my first time making stuffed mushrooms at home. I did leave the feeling sit overnight because we was called away. When I made them the next day they was for flavor and we love them these will become a regular staple in our house.

These were very easy to get together, but, had a ton of flavor!   Mine were done in about 12-15 minutes.   I thought they had a good taste, but, for our liking I would prefer to have more cheese in the filling other than the cream cheese.  I will make these again, but, experiment with the filling.

Took these to two different parties, and everyone loved them.  Didn't stop eating them until they were gone.  Really good, perfect balance between everything. I made some with zesty sausage and the other with mild.  Both were excellent.

Used large portobello caps instead, and stuffed them as full as I could get them (this recipe filled 4 large ones pretty darn full!). Half way through I realized I didn't have bread crumbs or parmesan cheese, so I substituted shake-n-bake style (not the brand - prefer a certain "Mart's" store brand flavor over the name brand) pork seasoning and coating mix and topped with mozzarella instead. Turned out DELISH!!!

Basically made as written, the only exception is that I used rolled Jones sausage and added more garlic than stated..Excellent!
