This is really really creamy and easy to bake. I think it was even better the second day!

Tastes fantastic! I cooked the filling in the microwave, stopping about every minute or so to stir. Cooked up great. Omitted the lemon juice and added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and nutmeg instead.

The comments I received from the people who ate this pie was "different! but very good".  some say it tasted alittle like a cheesecake and one said it tasted like key lime.  I have to admit that I've made pies that I liked better.  I also think there were too many raisins in it.

I made it as the recipe, except I sprinkled the top with cinnamon sugar.  Too many calories, but I enjoyed it once (alot!) and took it to a church dinner.

Great recipe.  I have also made it with a graham cracker crust which brings out it's cheese cake like taste.  We don't eat much sugar at our house so I substitute splenda.  Really taste great!
