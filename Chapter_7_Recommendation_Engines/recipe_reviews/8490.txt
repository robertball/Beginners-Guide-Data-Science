Just a reply to MCCREARY74's comment about the Ladyfingers being so hard. When I first made Tiramisu (a different recipe), I went to my local supermarket and bought the only type of Ladyfingers they offered. They were hard as rocks (like Stella D'oro breakfast cookies), and even had a picture of Tiramisu on the package (No, they weren't just stale). You need to buy the soft variety. I have not come across a Tiramisu recipe that distinguishes between the two kinds of  Ladyfingers. My Ladyfingers did not absorb the liquids when following the directions to dip them for just a few seconds--and turned out unpleasantly chewy. Hope this info helps avert a first time flop for some Tiramisu lover.

This was EXCELLENT!  I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this Tiramisu is. I have some points to make, 1. it's EASY, 2. It's great that the eggs are cooked, 3.  I didn't add any vanilla at all even though I was worried that since there were 6 egg yolks it will have this eggy smell, but it didn't, 4.  I only used espresso and no coffee liquer (1/2 cup water and 2 tbsp of coffee), 5.  I chilled the bowl that I was planning on beating the whipping cream in, make sure to get the whipping cream that looks like a milk carton in teh fridges, and not the 'whipped' cream.  6.  Mascarpone cheese isn't hard to find but it's expensive $8.99., 7.  Make sure to use the soft lady fingers, if you go to a large grocery store you wont' have a hard time finding them, I bought 3 10 oz packages, 8.  I refrigerated the mascarpone/egg mix while I was beating the whipping cream. 9. And this might be helpful, use a cheese cake pan, chill it, and the next morning you can just pop the tiramisu out.  It looked beuatiful!  I decorated it with some fresh raspberries and slices of strawberries, shredded chocolate and dusted cocoa powder.  Took it to work and everyone oooed and aahhhed at it.  It tasted very very good!!!! Keeper!  By the way, it's important you chill over night.

This is awesome! Same recipie fromback of the ladyfinger package, except they gave a wonderful substitute for the marcapone cheese, it's one 8 oz package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream and 2 tbs heavy cream, whipped together...this was the best dessert I've ever made! I brushed on really potent coffee, no alcohol, and it was a great, light, coffee and chocolate taste!

My friends love this Tiramisu and I love serving it. I substitute the Mascarpone cheese with 8oz of cream cheese, one-fourth cup heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of sour cream.  I use 2, 3oz packs of soft ladyfingers (bought from the bakery section of the local Kroger). I don't use coffee liquer, so I substitute with espresso (half cup water + 2 tablespoons instant coffee).  Serve it in a 3QT dish. Suggest keeping this dessert in the fridge overnight.  This Tiramisu is divine - thank you Carol for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I have made this many times, LOVE it and get tons of compliments!!!  Here is a summary of the tips I use from other reviewers: 1.  I scale the recipe to 10 servings so I can just use the 8 oz. container of mascarpone cheese.  2. I use the Savoiardi style hard ladyfingers, buy them in a 17.5 oz. Package (which has 60 ladyfingers) and use about 32.  I do not split the ladyfingers.  Also, I have used the soft ones from Trader Joes but do not like the result as much.  3. I like to layer the dessert in a loaf shape. Yes, your "filling" should be thick enough to do this! I sometimes use two 9.5 c “Ziploc” containers and make two, 2-layer desserts 2-go or 2-gift!  4. I use a hand-held electric mixer when cooking the egg yolks & sugar (for the full 10 min. on low heat).  5. I refrigerate the mascarpone mix while beating the HEAVY whipping cream, in a chilled bowl, until it is super stiff.  5.  Instead of the Kahlua, I make two 6 oz. cups of extra strong coffee (4 TBSP coffee per 6 oz water). I dunk the ladyfingers completely, but quickly, in the coffee.  6.  It is even better a day or two later and has a wonderful ice-cream quality if you can freeze/thaw it before serving!  Thanks so much for the recipe Carol!

excellent recipe!!!! rave reviews from everyone!!!
i found that i had to 1/2 the sugar. also, the double boiler must be on the lowest heat setting!! too high will cause the egg to cook and clump, and must be cooked for the full 10 minutes, otherwise sugar grains will appear in your tiramisu. also i accidentally went out of order the first time and whipped the cream first. bad idea. the whole tiramisu came out runny (as the whipped cream had slightly melted). the tiramisu consistency highly depends on the whipped cream consistency!!!! excellent recipe, have made a dozen times!!

I always end up with more lady fingers than I need to make this dessert. Not a problem since I just pop them in my mouth as I'm making the dessert. But since they're kinda expensive to buy, I'll be using the recipe for ladyfingers by roxanne. I always end up using more mascarpone cheese, than called for. So much creamier. And I always use lots of kahlua. Wonderful presentation and always get rave reviews. Thank you for the recipe!!
   One reviewer had problem whipping the cream. The first time I made this recipe I had the same problem. The solution for me has been to use heavy whipping cream instead of heavy cream. It will never turn to curd no matter how long you beat it and you don't have to watch out for the split second between cream and curd the way you have to with regular heavy cream. You should be able to find whipping cream in the same row as the heavy creams.

Oh man... I'm pretty sure tiramisu will be waiting for us in Heaven.  I used the ladyfinger recipe from this site and sliced them in half longways, like a hot dog bun.  I used a pyrex 9" x 13" pan.  I made a single layer of ladyfingers, poured some of the coffee liquer on top, then the whipped cream/cheese mixure, and repeated this two more times.  I do like my tiramisu to be really wet with the coffee flavor, so I made an additional cup of coffee, added an enthusiastic amount of french vanilla creamer (2-3 T I guess), let it cool down a bit, and poured it over top the top layer of ladyfiners, before making the last layer of whipped cream & cheese.  I let it sit in the fridge overnight before serving.  It was delicious!!!!  My friend said it was some of the best tiramisu he's ever had.  Will DEFINITELY make again.

This recipe was beyond great!  I made it in a bowl for a school meeting and everyone raved.  I used strong coffee mixed with 1 - 2 TBSP. of rum to LIGHTLY dip one side of the cookies in(I didn't have any Kahlua on hand).  Only one correction though. At least with the ladyfingers in my store, the recipe should call for two 3 ounce packages of ladyfingers with 12 cookies in each package.  NOT two 12 ounce packages!

This recipe came out GREAT for me and I was pretty nervous about making it for my italian in-laws for Christmas ;). I thought it was light and fluffy and not rich as some reviewers said. Normally I make recipes from this website as they are with no changes the first time around, but I read through at least the past two years of reviews and took a few tips to heart. 

1. Use 'soft' ladyfingers if you can get them. I can buy mine in 3 oz packages and I needed about 2.5 full packages. 2. reduce sugar to 3/4 cup 3. Definitely beat the yolks and sugar a bit BEFORE cooking. And as you are cooking, be sure you cook on low heat AND stir constantly. I just kept whisking and flipped through a magazine on the counter to keep me occupied ;). 4. I used one full 8oz container of 'tiramisu' marscapone cheese and half of another 8oz container of regular marscapone. 5. Add 1 teaspoon of good quality vanilla extract to the whipped cream. Use a chilled bowl to whip. 6. I used 1/3 cup of kahlua AND 1/3 cup of cooled, dark espresso roast coffee. I mixed the two liquids together. Then BRUSH onto the soft ladyfingers. You can still get a lot of liquid onto the fingers but it's more controlled. I tested the dipping method on a few ladyfingers and, for me, it made the fingers way too soggy.  7. I used a springform pan, which made for a very pretty dessert! But, I might do another layer of ladyfingers next time since I like the cake part of tiramisu :). 8. Definitely make at least one day before. The

You can never go wrong having tiramisu, yet you can mess up during the making of.

Some tips:
Melt the sugar down to a syrup in the double broiler with a bit of water. Then in a separate bowl combine syrup with egg yolks and whisk to the thick lemon yellow consistency. 
This made it much easier since it was my first time with a double broiler. Plus with this method all the sugar melts and the yolks won't end up being cooked.

I made this dessert two days in a row for two separate family gatherings (in laws and my own family). The first day I followed the original recipe. The second day I made some tweaks based on lessons learned and everyone absolutely loved the tiramisu. They couldn't believe that I had made it. Here are my tips: 1. Use mascarpone and not the cream cheese, sour cream and whipping cream as substitute. The substitute is not bad, but if you're making tiramisu, you are better off with mascarpone. 2. Make espresso (3/4 cup water and 4 tbsp coffee) and add 1/3 cup coffee liqueur (alt. 1/2 cup if you like the strong liqueur taste). 3. It is important to generously brush the lady fingers in the serving dish so the coffee taste mixes with cream and for the fingers to soak properly. The first day I dipped the lady fingers in the coffee for about 2 seconds before layering, and even after 24 hrs in the fridge, I felt that the ladyfingers were on the dry side and the cream didn't have the coffee taste. Splitting the ladyfingers in half is good as it will help softening them - particularly f you are serving the same day. 4. Soft ladyfingers - someone suggested using soft ladyfingers. I went to a huge grocery store in an Italian neighbourhood and couldn't find soft lady fingers. The softest brand I could find was Milano Giant Ladyfingers Biscuits (5.3 oz/ 150g per packet). I found that 2-3 packets are enough if you are not lining the side of the dish with fingers.  This recipe is a keeper!

I have been making this recipe for some years now and no matter where I go, I'm asked for the recipe. I've learnt a few  tricks though: After adding the mascarpone, I let it cool down completely and then add my cream un-whipped. I then proceed to whipping the whole lot with a regular hand-held whisk, untill it's nice and thick. I use a mixture of strong, black coffee, brandy and Khalua and almost drench my biscuits. I've made this for an Italian granny who has sworn by her own recipe for decades - she now makes this one! My daughter started making this recipe three years ago (she's 18 now) and has NEVER had a flop. You just can't go wrong with this one.

I reviewed this once, but thought since I have made it so many times I would review it one more time. The basic recipe is good with a little tweeking. First please, please, please buy the hard ladyfingers - when you dip them they become soft - if you start off with the soft ones they become mush after sitting. Use 2 cups of espresso with 1/4 cup liquor of your choice - I use rum - you can also adjust how much liquor you put in for those who like it stronger. The amount of sugar is way off to my liking. I use 1/2 cup sugar with the egg yolks. I put the eggs and sugar in a bowl over simmering water and take my hand mixer and mix the entire time they are heating...makes it easier. Whip the cream until very stiff. With these adjustments this is a wonderful recipe!!! Also I know people substitute the mascarpone cheese, but don't do it unless you have to - the original is the best.

I made this recipe for the 4th time this weekend. It was the best as I think I got it right this time, with my guests dubbing it the best tiramisu they ever had and that some, who didn't really fancy it, have been converted. The problem I had in the past was that I genuinely could not understand why I could not get the whipping cream to stiff peaks. Admittedly, I have little experience doing desserts. The key, I learnt by trial and error, is that cream needs to be whipped on a very slow speed on your hand mixer and patience is important. As you slowly whip the cream, it begins to take form and as it thickens after a few minutes slowly whipping, you can begin to see the stiff peaks. In the past, I whipped it like I was attacking it, on the fastest speed and it became to light and fluffy like the ones in the tin. Once I had gotten it to the right consistency, for the very first time, the finished mixture was quite robust to be honest and it stood up very well. Just some other comments: I will be using espresso with a dash of alcohol next time as the Savoirdi lady fingers require a little more liquid to ensure that they are not dry. If I were to add the same amount of coffee liquer, the alcohol overpowers the beauty of the other flavours.  Now that I have cracked the formula, I will be making it again and again. Thanks guys!

This was fabulous! I did get the hard ladyfingers. Instead of brushing them I also brewed 12 oz strong coffee and added a 1/3 cup kaluha. I quickly dipped the whole lady fingers in the coffee mix before layering.

This is a great recipe and not very hard to make. I noticed that the recipe calls for 2 (12oz) lady fingers. I think that is an error and it should read 2 (3oz) lady fingers. The lady fingers I use are called  Specialty Bakers Lady Fingers and you find them in the bakery section. If you can't find them ask your baker for them. I got them at my local Publix grocery and if they are not out they usually have them in the freezer. These are soft cake like ladyfingers, not crunchy. With that said if you find these ladyfingers, this recipe is on the back of the package. The only other change I will make next time is more coffee liquer. This is a fantastic recipe but I would love more coffee flavor. Also, I used mascarpone cheese that is coffee flavored. I did make this in a springform pan as well.

I'll give this five stars.  It's easy and YUMMY! I was concerned about the custard having too much egg yolk but after it sits in the fridge at least 24 hours it's good to go. The recipe didn't say to let the yolks/sugar cool before adding the cheese and whipped cream. This is a step that needs to be added to the original so you don't end up with a curddley mess. I let mine cool to room temp before adding either.  I used the soft ladyfingers and dipped them quickly in strong coffee and Kahula, gives the perfect texture and taste. As other reviewers mentioned let it sit in fridge at least 24 hours before serving. One addition, I did add a teaspoon of vanilla to the custard as it was cooling. Great recipe!

yum! easy to make, not too sweet, though i changed it slightly...
i used strong coffee instead of kahlua and only 1 cup sugar. 
tip* to make the ladyfingers stand up straight against the sides, cut an inch off the bottom so they're flat
yum!

Holy cow!!  This is an awesome dessert - it is now my new favorite way to impress friends.  I used "biscotti savoiardi", found in the Italian food section of my grocery store.  They are firmer and prettier than the squishy ladyfingers I saw in the bakery seaction.  I used a 9" springform pan.  Dipped one side of each cookie and shook off the excess - very quick.  Note that with the savoiardi there is no need to "split" them.

I added some hot espresso to the yolk/sugar mixture - mine didn't really "whip" and stayed gritty with sugar - but just a few teaspoons of hot liquid smoothed it right out.  I added a little kaluha to the mix too.

I used the whole pint of whipping cream and whipped it to very stiff peaks as recommended by another reviewer. Put the assembled dessert in the fridge for day, then dusted the top with cocoa powder just before serving.

The dessert looked masterful and tasted heavenly.  Next time I will use a mix of Kahlua and Godiva chocolate liqueur.  I'll also make it easier on myself and just assemble it in a 9x13 pan - it will taste just as good.  I'll just keep the springform pan version for people who need to be impressed.  :-)

I've made this twice now and both times it got rave reviews!  Both times I used the hard lady fingers.  The first time I dipped them in a coffee/kahluah mixture and they came out soggy.  The second time I brushed the mixture on the hard lady fingers until they were well covered and it was PERFECT!  I even had a friend who's not big on tirimisu ask for the recipe!
  A few notes on the recipe- I reduced the sugar by almost 1/2  and it was plenty sweet.  I also used a 2:1 coffee/kahluah mixture for brushing the lady fingers.
  For the reviewer who was concerned about possible raw eggs (during pregnancy), I used a food thermometer and made sure the yolks reached 160 degrees before removing from the heat.

I'm giving this 5 stars because the actual recipe (from the back of one brand of ladyfingers, which I lost)makes perfect tiramisu, but this copy has a few flaws.  The recipe calls for 2 (3 oz.)packages of soft ladyfingers. (Not 12 oz.)  You also whip the yolks and sugar together until lemon colored BEFORE you cook in top of double boiler.  (Beating AFTER cooking AS Well does cool the mixture and helps it to incorporate into the cheese)  I often make a "half-batch" of this layered in a bread/loaf pan using all of an 8oz. container of mascarpone cheese (as well as the full 1/3 cup liguor).  A better size that's just right for the hubby and me.

First of all I have to say that this tiramisu is very rich and creamy but overtly sweet. Next time I will cut down the sugar to 3/4 C only. Remember to use heavy whipping cream that is NOT ultra pasteurized since it will be easier to reach to desired volume. I whipped the cream to stiff peak for about 20 min or so. Bought the soft lady fingers and Belgioioso mascarpone cheese at Trader Joe's. From other reviews, I thought mascarpone cheese would be so expensive, but actually my husband and I thought it wasn't bad at all. It was less than $2.50 for each 8 oz package. Since this recipe called for 1 1/4 C, of course we both had to pick up 2 packages for total of less than $5. Oh even with the soft lady fingers, I dipped it into the room temp espresso really quick on both sides, and it didn't turn out to mush at all. Don't worry, dipping would create stronger taste than just brushing.

Wonderful! I made this to impress my boyfriend's mother and that is exactly what I did.  As some of the others mentioned it was kind of soft the first time I made it.  Make sure that your heavy cream is really whipped and chilled well before you add it to the egg mixture, this worked better for me the second time around.  But in slices or globs it is soooo yummmy. Thanks for the great recipie.

This fit in a 9" springform pan perfectly. After I'd assembled mine, I had one 3-oz package of unopened ladyfingers left. (Kindda like putting an IKEA piece together and being left with a few nuts and bolts. LOL.) Would have helped if the recipe specified to make double-thicknesses of cookies at the bottom and middle. Still, very easy to make, great light flavor. Next time, I'm going to bake my ladyfingers a bit to get them crispier, and make 3 layers of filling and 2 middle layers of single-thickness cookies. Thanks for sharing the recipe, Carol.

Incredible! (with changes) Per other reviewers, scaled recipe to 10 servings to perfectly use the 8oz container of mascarpone cheese. Made my own espresso instead of using liqueur. Cooked TWO DAYS IN ADVANCE and chilled it all that time.  Brushing espresso on the cookies didn't work out well.  Dipped them instead, but they have to be dipped FAST or they just fall apart.  Also, line the bottom of the pan first, then the sides, as that will help the cookies not fall over on themselves once they are soaked and getting soggy.  My friend I made it for said it was the best Tiramisu she'd had outside if Italy!  I think the advance preparation and two-day chill time allowed the flavors to really deepen.  I used a springform cheesecake pan, which made it easy to serve and look pretty.

Words are inadequate to describe this recipe and the "hit" that it was with the guests at the party.  Even my husband whose idea of a heavenly dessert is apple pie told me this comes close and might even be equal!  So kudos to you Carol.  Anymore recipes like this?  Please share!

I did use butter pound cake,Entemmans, just cut it up in squares, and it was great.  Probably will only use them, not ladyfingers.  Brushed the cake with a pastry brush and used a glass bowl..good presentation,but better yet..HEAVENLY!!!

An authentic Italian recipe does not include whipped cream or nearly as much sugar.  The original recipe calls for five eggs, half a cup of sugar, one teaspoon of pure vanilla flavouring and one pound of Galbani mascarpone cheese.  The brand is very important.  Galbani is imported from Italy and is the best available domestically.  The savoiardi biscuits are dipped in two cups of strong espresso coffee and one third of a cup of brandy or kahlua.

This was my first time making Tiramisu (I made it for Valentine's Day) and although it didn't come out as great looking as many of the other ones in the pictures, it was DELICIOUS.  Like some of the other reviews, I left out the coffee flavored liqueur and instead brushed the lady fingers with espresso.  I also substituted mascarpone cheese with a sour cream/cream cheese/ whipping cream recipe provided by one of the other reviews.. It must replicate the real thing pretty well because it tassted great. I'm looking forward to practicing and making this as beautiful at it was delicious- Thanks Carol!:)

I made this for my sister who fancies herself a Tiramisu expert and she loved, loved, loved it!! I took alot of reviews into account and scaled this recipe down to 10 servings so that I would only need the one tub of marscapone cheese, which my Italian friend told me to NEVER sub in this recipe. Luckily I have an Italian deli close by and found both the marscapone and lady fingers at very reasonable prices. A 7oz pkg of lady fingers for $2.60, it had 24 lady fingers. I made this in an 8x8 square glass dish and I did use a mixture of strong coffee and kahlua to very quickly dip the lady fingers into. I was able to create 3 layers all together and let it set in the fridge for 2 days, as some had suggested. On the second day it was good, but boy was it better on the 3rd day and Fabulous by the 4th day! So if you want it for a Friday night, make it and put in the fridge on Monday night and you will not be disappointed!! Thanks for sharing!!

Wow!! I was really nervous since I haven't made a tiramisu in years and needed to make one for my husband's birthday but will definitely be looking forward to more now.

I only wanted to make a small one, so reduced all the portions to 1/4; used expresso bought from the shop and rum; dusted the cocoa with dark and white chocolate and added a strawberry to garnish; and served it all in a whisky glass - very pretty!

Oh and yes, letting it sit for 2 days definitely does taste better!

This is beyond fabulous. It is a little more work than a standard dessert but tastes like a million bucks. And that's what it'll cost for all the ingredients too! Just kidding. Made this for a large get together and had many people say that this was not only the BEST tiramisu they have ever had in their life but the BEST dessert they have ever had. A note on the recipe: It calls for way more ladyfingers than you will need if you are using a spring form pan. I couldn't find enough at the store and ended up making them from scratch(now that is a pain!) but made too many because of the incorrect amount. I would say you need about 16 oz worth of lady fingers not 24 if you are using a spring form pan. Make this recipe if you want people to think you are a fabulous cook and want to give you a diamond necklace because of it!

This was definately good!  I have made it a few times.  People always want me to make it, they love it so much.  I used a 9x13 pan with strong coffee and pound cake (my supermarket didn't have lady fingers?) instead of what the recipe calls for.  I used more liquid than called for because the first time it came out dry.  I am still in search of the perfect tiramisu, but for now will use this recipe.

I am from Malaysia and I decided to try this recipe based on the favorable reviews for this Tiramisu recipe and I have tried this recipe with success twice using cream cheese!  I love it smooth and velvety texture.  This recipe scale is a perfect fit for a 9" springfom pan.  But if you prefer smaller serving, I'ld suggest that you half this recipe.  I would recommend that instead of soaking the lady fingers into the coffee mixture, dip your brush into the mixture and brush instead.  My first attempt with the lady fingers was a disaster as the lady fingers soaked up too much liquid and start to leak from the springform pan which was rather messy.  Afraid that the cheese mixture would turn out too soft, I have at my own discretion dissolved 4 tsp of powder gelatine with 3 tsp of hot water and added into the cheese mixture. It turn out fabulous and everyone was pleased!  I can believe it was soooo easy!  Thanks Carol, heaps!

We have made this recipe many times and love it.  We have used both types of lady fingers.  They are not always easy to find.   We actually line our pan/trifle with the ladyfingers and use a turkey baster and brush to spread the expresso/kahlua mixture we make.  The ingredients can be expensive but a couple of tips: if you have a trader joe's, they have the mascarpone cheese and the heavy whipping cream for a fraction of the cost.  Near the holidays, they even carry the lady fingers.  They don't have them for too long so go in when you can and stock up.  It was about 1/3 of the cost at the local Italian market.  We make this recipe for people and we always have the nicest thank you's.  People love it.  Hope it helps.

I thought that this was DELICIOUS! For the 1 1/4c of mascarpone I used an 8oz container of local mascarpone and then used 4oz cream cheese, 1/8 cup sour cream and 1 Tbs fat-free 1/2 & 1/2 . I know it was more than the 1/4 c. that was called for but at this point who cares? I also used the whole pint (2c) of whipping cream instead of the called for 1 3/4c.  Because I have some "non-alcohol" peeps, I used a scant 2 Tbs. of kahlua and then filled the rest of the 1/3 c with strong instant coffee. It was EXCELLENT! I made this in my trifle bowl and refrigerated it overnight. It presented well and the lady fingers absorbed the coffee/liquor and were soft and delicious! Definitely a keeper! TRY THIS! This is an update...I used 2 pkgs. of lady fingers. They come in 3 oz. pkgs. Be sure to douse the bottom layer w the Kahlua/coffee mixture. There is plenty to go around. This is a relatively quick and easy recipe. For some reason I thought it took longer. It is delicious! Now, what to do w all those egg whites?!

I made this for my boss' birthday today since it's his favorite dessert and it got RAVE reviews.  I substituted the cream cheese, sour cream and heavy cream mixture for the mascarpone cheese, and used strong coffee instead of Kahlua and it still came out beautifully.  I put mine in a 9" springform pan overnight and when I took the outer ring off this morning it held its shape and looked awesome.  I garnished with dark chocolate curls and chocolate covered espresso beans.  Such an easy, but impressive looking dessert that gets lots of oohs and aahs!  Thanks for sharing!!

Over all, the recipe is good. Except, I thought it was way too weet. I will reduce the sugar to 2/3 or even 1/2 cup. When I made my second Tiramisu, instead of using the heavy whipping cream, I whipped the 6 egg white to stiff and mixed it with the egg yoke mixture. It turned out just like the whipped cream but LESS fat & calories!!!

I loved this recipe! I've had many versions of tiramisu, but never made it myself before. Really easy to make, except my pan was too large to make layers. I did a couple of changes: I brushed Kahlua onto the lady fingers instead of soaking them; added Kahlua to both the filling and the topping; added chocolate chips to the filling; added cocoa to the topping. I wanted coffee and chocolate :)

VERY rich, quite good.  I made this for my husband's birthday and one guest said "this reminds me of flavored whipped butter" and it really did have that consistency.  I went back the next day and looked at the nutrition facts and was amazed - per serving, it has over 30 grams of fat and 129% RDV of cholesterol!!!  We didn't even eat the leftovers.  It was very good, but I won't be making it again because it is just so bad for you.  If you're looking for a yummy tiramisu, though, this is definitely one of them!

I had to make this dessert three hours before a dinner party, so made the ladyfingers off this site which were easy.  If you're using a springform pan only make them 3 - 4 inches long or you'll be doing a lot of trimming. It's understandable that it wasn't quite set five hours later when we ate, but even though I added 1/4 c. of Kahlua to the batter in addition to brushing the ladyfingers, I found it had a wonderful consistency, but needed more flavor.  I would try this again and add some cocoa (1 tbsp perhaps)during the mixing stage, prior to folding the two batters together.

I am not rating the recipe because based on previous reviews, I altered it somewhat. I decreased the sugar to 1 c., added 1t. vanilla to the cheese mixture, added approximately 3 T. of instant coffee dissolved in equal amt. of water to the Kahlua. I also used almost twice the amt. of Kahlua because I dipped the ladyfingers quickly, instead of brushing them with it. I used Trader Joe's ladyfingers and needed three pkgs. using a springform pan. YUMMY! I think the added coffee gave it a much needed slightly bitter element to counteract the rich, sweet cheese mixture. I was originally attracted to this recipe because the yolks are cooked. I have never made tiramisu in the past due to the raw eggs.

I have to agree with this tiramisu being way too sweet and whipped-creamy. Not going to give this recipe another go, I'm afraid...

What happens when you add mascarpone to anything hot? It melts into an oil. This recipe says to whip the mascarpone into the cooked and whipped egg yolk mixture, with no mention of chilling it first. I followed the directions, even though I knew what would happen, and sure enough, the mascarpone melted. What a waste of good, expensive mascarpone.

Sheer brilliance. I used this recipe to make it for the very first time and skipped the coffee flavored liquor and made fresh espresso instead. According to the italian grocer, the key to a great tiramisu is super strong espresso - it also didn't hurt that their marscapone cheese (polengi brand) and lady finger cookies (bonnomi) were both excellent ingredients!

Great recipe that got everyone praising. However, just one thing to take note, if u r using sponge finger which is coated with sugar (mine was Tesco brand) be sure to cut down on the white sugar. else it will turn out to b tad too sweet.

I've made this twice now. Once for my family in which I used a 13x9. I substituted coffee for the liquer due to feeding it to the kids.  The second was at a family gathering in which I used a trifle bowl I purchased for this reason.  The kids loved it, which shocked me as I have a picky eater.  The extended family RAVED about it.  It was gone very quickly, and I was told I am not allowed to show up to a gathering without it, ha!  The trifle bowl looked beautiful, so not only did it taste great, it made me look like I know what I'm doing.  I was asked if I always made "fancy schmancy desserts".  Leftovers are great too, the kids liked it better after it sat in the fridge for a couple days, and hubby and I definitely thought it was a great leftover treat.  It was gone before I could see how it tasted on day three. ;)

I have made several recipes for tiramisu, but this is the best one BY FAR I have ever made. I like the fact that this one is sweeter than the others, plus I like the fact that you cook the egg...makes it just a little bit safer in my viewpoint. I did not have mascarpone cheese, so used the cream cheese/sour cream/whipping cream substitute used by LGIORGI on that review. Since my ladyfingers were hard, I made around 1 1/2 cups of strong coffee with a little Kahlua, soaking each ladyfinger for just a few seconds. If you use this method, do not soak too long or the ladyfingers will fall apart. Everything came out perfect. I impressed the heck out of my guests! :D Wonderful, wonderful recipe, which I will definitely make again, probably over the holidays. Thank you VERY MUCH for the great recipe!

Easiest recipe for a delicious dessert. This recipe came out perfect on my first try. I made a few changes, instead of splitting the lady fingers I used them whole. I used the hard ones because that is all the store had.(one reason I used them whole) Since some of my guests dislike the taste of coffee I substituted the coffee Liqueur with a chocolate Liqueur. The flavor was great and it was a hit by all. I also used the masarpone substitute I found on another review. Next time I will soak the lady fingers a few seconds longer but the key is to let it sit in the fridge to firm up the filling and soften the lady fingers. 3/2009- I have made this recipe 3 times now and it is still a favorite and it is just to easy to taste so good. I have now found if I make it on Tuesday and wrap it in plastic wrap the lady fingers have the perfect texture by Friday. A quick dip of the Lady Fingers in the Liqueur is all it needs. I can't wait for the next time to make it again.

This recipe delivered a perfect tiramisu. I  have lived in Europe and Tiramisu was my go to dessert when reading the menu was difficult or impossible so i have tasted my fair share of tiramisu. The only change i made was i used 1/2 cup kahlua and 2.5 cups of strong coffee to quickly dip the lady fingers. I also used hard lady fingers instead of soft as i dont care for soft ones. And, do all the people who reviewed and said that cream cheese is a good substitute- i TOTALLY disagree. Use mascarpone and you wont be sorry!!! YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY!

FANTASTIC!!! I made this for a catering gig a couple years ago and everyone went crazy. I got 3 more jobs from this dessert alone. Now it's the only tiramisu recipe I use. We live in a fairly small community and mascarpone is sometimes hard to find, so I use the cream cheese/sour cream/heavy cream substitute and it works just great. (less expensive too) I often sub. the liquor for very strong coffee with rum extract if I've got a non-drinking crowd. Thanks this is the #1 requested dessert on my menu! Thanks Carol!

I have tried SOOO many tiramisu recipes and this one got me closer to what I was looking for than any others.  I made a few changes to finally get it where I wanted.... I reduced sugar to 3/4 cups, use 8 oz mascarpone, 16 oz heavy whipping cream, and I brush the lady fingers with a mixture of strong coffee, sugar, and amaretto or almond extract.

I made this for my wine tasting party dessert and it was a big hit.  Keeping with the wine theme I made indiviudual serving in wine glasses (12)  I placed the lady fingers up against the glass and the filling in the middle.  Dusted with cocoa powder and placed a mint leaf on top.  Very classy looking!  Very one loved it!!

Help!!!
I've made tiramisu loads of times, diffrent recipes but never using the double boiler method. NEVER AGAIN. It's turned out runny with the fingers floating to the top when I poured in the second layer of custard. What have I done wrong??

Have 15 people coming to dinner tonight and it's still not anywhere near set....going out to buy a dessert.

This was my first crack at making tiramisu and boy was it successful!  I had some extra marscarpone cheese that I needed to use up, so I decided to try this recipe out.  I made the ladyfingers from this site, which were surprisingly easy, and they formed a perfect base for the rest of the ingredients.  I made this in a casserole dish (about 8 x 13) instead of a bowl, which worked out fine.  Instead of using Kahlua, I just used espresso, and the espresso actually cut through a lot of the other flavors when I took my first bite.  It worked well.  I also didn't have any regular granulated sugar on hand, so I used turbinado sugar and it didn't have any adverse effects on the final product.  I chose to top it with an espresso-flavored dark chocolate, which I just shaved with a vegetable peeler as someone suggested.  It looked like something that I might get in a fancy Italian restaurant and it tasted better than any tiramisu I've ever had.  After my co-workers get a taste of this tomorrow, I'm sure it will be an often-requested favorite.  This one's a definite keeper.

I will definately be making this again. I used store bought hard lady fingers because I'm lazy, and  in compensating for that, added more kahlua than called for and thus over did the booze a little (I guess there is such a thing s a too-boozy dessert, who knew?) I also used the Marscapone substitute recipe from this site as my grocery store decided not to stock any until the day after New Years!! Next time I will cut down on the booze and mix with espresso as some have suggested. Also, I didn't have a brush handy, so I used a turkey baster to dribble the kahlua on the cookies and that worked really well.

Ok. I made this about 6 months ago, and I came back to see if any helpful comments had been made.  My tiramisu came out BEAUTIFULLY last time.  I made it in a 9 inch springform pan, which is perfect for presentation.  I actually put mine in the freezer, and allowed to thaw a bit before serving, becuase I found mine to be a bit runny.  I think this was because I did not beat the whip cream enough?  Mascarpone cheese can be found in the deli section with all the specialty cheeses. It's a bit on the expensive side, but totally worth it.  If you're not into alcohol, here's what I used: they actually have Kahlua flavored coffee in tiny packets at Wal-Mart.  This will give you that great taste without the alcohol.  I used the entire package and made a little over 2 cups of super strong coffee.  I bought the lady fingers at Kroger (we don't have Trader Joes anywhere near here).  They were in the Italian foods section, and I bought two packages.  These ladyfingers came with a little bit of an icing/sugar coating on top.  I dipped and flipped the lady fingers in the coffee, and they were saturated as if you dipped an oreo in milk.  It depends on how much you want that coffee taste.  I just dipped enough to get both sides covered, and then removed it.  Others had suggested using a bit less sugar, so I will try that this time.  I'm also going to use ramikans (sp?) to make little individual tiramisus.  Have fun with this recipe, it's a crowd pleaser, they are sure to be impressed!

Sorry for the poor rating, but it was disheartening to go to the store 5 times because I kept messing up on whipping the cream! I kept getting cottage cheesy like stuff and finally I went online to find out exactly how to whip the creme and when it finally worked out, it was somewhat harder than the liquid, but by no means formed stiff peaks. I couldn't find lady fingers and thought that using the bisquit type ones would work.. BIG Mistake. Luckily the recipe was runny enough to soften the lady fingers but forget trying to cut a piece out, best eaten with a spoon and scooping out like ice cream. I don't understand how to prevent such a disaster and would like to give a rave reviews like everyone else. Suggestions on getting a more custard like consistency? ( I even put it in the fridge for 2 days!)

ARE YOU KIDDING ME????  This was incredible, my family didn't even believe that I made it.  I don't own a double boiler so I just used a stainless steel mixing bowl over a pot of boiling water.  I used a 10-inch springform pan and lined the bottom first, then the sides with upright cookie halves.  Instead of all Kahlua, I also mixed in some espresso for a more authentic flavor--and instead of brushing, I rolled each cookie in the mixture--BUT NOT TOO MUCH, or it'll turn to mush!  Just a quick roll in the liquid.
This was absolutely fantastic!  It looked like a work of art when I took it out of the pan!

I thought this was okay for tiramisu.  I had troubles with it being a little too runny.  I think you have to let it sit in the fridge for a couple days to help because I followed the directions and had stiff peaks in my heavy cream.  I used 3 packages of soft lady fingers and quickly dipped them in Kahlua instead of brushing them.  Flavor is pretty good, I just wasn't as happy about the consistency and would have liked it to be thicker.  I used a springform pan, but can't release it because I am not sure it will keep its shape.  If you are going to try it make it a few days ahead to allow the coffe/liquor flavor to meld into the tiramisu and also to let is set and thicken.  I think I would try a different recipe next time instead of this one.

My mom used to make Tiramisu as it's my sister's favorite, but hasn't made it in forever. I found this recipe was even better than hers.
First, I followed another reviewer's instructions and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and prepared the sugar in the double boiler separate from the egg yolks; I'm not sure what a difference it made as I never made it the other way,

I HIGHLY recommend making it in a springform pan. My biggest complaint with my mom's version was that the bottom tended to get soggy because the coffee from the cookies would leak out. That being said, I put a larger bowl under the pan as I worked to absorb the coffee that leaked out.

Also, because I was taking the cake to go, I froze it for a few hours beforehand. It kept its shape PERFECTLY on the drive over, made slicing it much neater, and even though the center was slightly frozen, I'd probably just not freeze it as long next time.

Great recipe. Loved it.

I made this for Italian day potluck for work.. So easy to put together.. However I would suggest cutting down on the sugar.. I also used a 8 inch springform pan. I did taste the filling.. Wow its sure to be a success! Lol..Update it was a HUGE Hit .. One of the girls at work actually said if I had a bakery she would bake this from me .. :) I love Allreceipes, theyve never steered me wrong!!!!

Just made my first Tiramisu! It's sitting in the fridge right now. Can't wait til tomorrow when I can taste it. It was so easy to make. I was terrified that I would mess it up. For some reason I thought that tiramisu was difficult to make. I did half mascarpone cheese and half creamcheese. Also, I found it easier to make chocolate curls using a sharp paring knife on a chocolate bar instead of a vegetable peeler, but that just is preference. Great recipe!

Inedibly sweet!  Not sure I'll try this again but if I do I'll cut the sugar in half.  Reminded me more of cotton candy than good tiramisu.

to make it a real classic tiramisu you missed the amaretto and one uses fresh ground coffee beans.

This is definitely a classic recipe.  I have been making this recipe for the past 20 years.  It is the only one that my family and friends ask me to make over and over again. Simple ingredients. I let my eggs stand outside the fridge for a couple of hours before I separate them so that I don't have to put them over the double boiler. I add my alcohol to the coffee so that I dip each cookie into the liquid with both flavourings. Truly a wonderful recipe.

Easiest recipe for a delicious dessert. This recipe came out perfect on my first try. I made a few changes, instead of splitting the lady fingers I used them whole.  I used the hard ones because that is all the store had.(one reason I used them whole) Since some of my guests dislike the taste of coffee I substituted the coffee Liqueur with a chocolate Liqueur. The flavor was great and it was a hit by all. I also used the masarpone substitute I found on another review. Next time I will soak the lady fingers a few seconds longer but the key is to let it sit in the fridge to firm up the filling and soften the lady fingers.

This recipe is fabulous.  I always make a mascarpone substitute http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Mascarpone-Substitute/Detail.aspx, since it's so hard to find, and it's wonderful.  I also make the ladyfingers from scratch http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Ladyfingers/Detail.aspx, which makes the whole thing much more moist.  It is definitely worth it to leave it in the fridge for a day so that the flavors can really merge and then emerge.  Perfect for entertaining.  I've tried lots of tiramisu, and this recipe, with everything made from scratch, tops them all.

reduced sugar to 3/4C as recommended by other reviewers. I kept the eggs over the double boiler for about 13-15 minutes to thicken more because I was worried about other  comments about runny and soggy final products, which I did not experience with this recipe.  Thank you for this simple yet impressive recipe!

Delicious recipe.  I couldn't find any soft lady fingers so I got a pound cake mix and baked that according to directions, and then sliced it up into "ladyfinger" sized pieces.  I also cut the sugar to 3/4 cup.  It was way too sweet for me using the full amount of sugar.  I dipped the ladyfingers into a mixture of espresso and kahlua and got them pretty wet.  The first two times I made this I only brushed it on and it was too dry for my tastes.  I make this a couple of days ahead of time and EVERYONE LOVES IT!!  YUMMY

Very good flavor and consistency.  It was really much easier than I thought making a custard would be.  I made it with softened cream cheese since I couldn't find mascarpone and it still worked.  Just a little hard to get the lumps out.

Well, I'd be the first to admit that I had A LOT of trouble with this recipe. My first batch turned out soggy, although when I filtered out the water and tried it it tasted like pretty good tiramisu. My second batch turned out more or less like my first batch. Why? Because of how I'd whipped the cream.

So I tried again today (but threw out the first batch of cream I'd whipped cause it'd turned into lumps (of butter) and liquid (buttermilk)). I finally managed to whip a batch of cream that looked acceptable, made the tiramisu using this batch - and it turned out perfect.

So basically if you end up with somewhat runny tiramisu, one possibility is that it could be because of the cream. I chilled the cream in the freezer before whipping, and watched the cream as it was whipped, stopping the mixer the moment the beater left a trail on the cream - which I think is how it's supposed to be. Not exactly stiff peaks, though - anyone know how to make the cream into stiff peaks?

Oh and I cut down heavily on the sugar - and it was still sweet. I'd recommend cutting down quite a bit on the sugar. And I substituted a cup of coffee (half cup water, 2 tablespoons of coffee) for the coffee liquer. :)

Other than my problem with the cream, I think this recipe is really really good - and of course the tiramisu I made tasted pretty good (am getting other people to try tomorrow). :D

WOW!  I followed other reviewers' advice to let it sit overnight, which meant running to the grocery store at 11pm the previous night...  I found the mascarpone in the deli section of my store, not with the regular dairy.

I also made 1.5 times the recipe to make it really fill up a 9 x 13 glass dish (with enough to make a little single serving so I could try it out before my party!).  I added some coffee to the Kahlua and quickly dipped the top and bottom of my "Vicenzovo" lady fingers (if I submerged them completely they got too mushy).  

It seemed too sweet in the morning but by the evening it had mellowed out.  It was great!

5+ stars!  The best I've ever tasted, I cannot believe that I actually made this!  I used Vienna Fingers (they are the hard ones) and I soaked them in espresso that I made with instant coffee.  The cream part was the best, it tasted perfect, better than in any restaurant.  

Update:  I have made this again several times and I have used the hard lady fingers and the soft ones, is you use the soft ones, brush them with the coffee, if you use the hard ones soak them.  My husband actually like it better with the hard lady fingers soaked in coffee vs the other way.

Easy but a little time consuming.  I made this for my Italian Step-Dad.  He said it was better than any he has ever had before, I agreed with him whole-heartedly.  I think that the longer that this sat in the fridge the better it got.

I love tiramisu and this receipe was so good.  It tasted like something I'd get at a restaurant.  I made a few adjustments though; I added just a splash of marsala wine to the egg-sugar mixture while over the double-boiler.  It gave the dessert that "rum-like" flavor.  I also added a little Kahlua to the coffee for an extra kick.  So, so good.  Thanks for sharing.

Very simple and easy to prepare with great flavor. I used a springform pan and refrigerated the cake for 24 hours. I was very impressed with the way the desert appeared once I removed the sides of the pan. I would suggest standing the lady fingers on end when lining the outside of the pan. It gives an impressive presentation when the cake is served. I would also suggest dipping rather than brushing the lady fingers with espresso to improve the flavor. I served this for 10 people and they loved it.

I made this recipe and received excellent reviews!  It was so delicious, but I did do a couple of things differently.
1) I used Italian Savioardi cookies I found that were harder than the soft Milano ladyfingers.  I think they are more authentic, and liked the sugar on the top layer of the cookie.  
2) I mixed 1/3 cup of coffee liqueur with one strong espresso for extra coffee flavor.  Because the cookies were hard, I did need the extra liquid to get them to my desired softness.
For assembly, I used a springform pan and followed the directions like the recipe indicated.  Next time I will line the sides of the pan with cookies  first, then line the bottom.  I quickly dunked both sides of the cookie in the liqueur, placed in the bottom of the pan, and brushed a little more on top.  I also brushed the cookies on the sides of the pan a little so they wouldn't be too hard to break with a fork.  The cookie layer was perfect!!
I also think there is enough cream to do three layers. (I only did two layers and it was fine but the cream layers were quite thick).
Overall, great recipe and I will definitely make again!

This is the best recipe. I have never made tiramisu before and it turned out like I have been making it for years. In some of the comments I read, their cream was runny - I think the key is really step 2 - whipping heavy cream into stiff peaks. I bought three packages of soft lady fingers and it was the perfect amount. I brushed the espresso/kahlua mix and it gave great flavor. I also used a 8.5" spring form pan and it was awesome for presentation - looked like I bought from a bakery! This was a fun dessert to make, super easy and one of my favorites to make. Love, love, love it!!!!

I picked this recipe bec the egg yolks are cooked. Next time I make it, I'd add brandy and rum to the eggyolk/cream cheese mixture before folding the whipped cream, and I'd really soak the lady finger layers in espresso with kahlua instead of just brushing it on the cookies. And I advise you to freeze it because it tastes so much better frozen ;).

Made this yesterday....It was outstanding!  We were having an Italian themed dinner party and this was the perfect way to finish the evening.  It wasn't hard to make either.  I will confess that I used quite a bit more than 1/3 cup of liqueur.  I dipped the lady fingers in the liqueur rather than brush it on and they really soaked it up.  Everyone raved about it.

WOW!!!!  That was fantastic! 

After reading the reviews I decreased the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 12 oz of Starbucks coffee with a shot of marsala wine instead of coffee liqueur. I also added some coffee to the cream mixture. YUMMY!!!!!

BUT it NEEDED to set overnight.

This is SO GOOD.....BUT.......Why did my filling turn out so goopy?  It didn't set up - looks like pudding inside and it has refrigerated over 24 hours.  What did I do wrong?  :-(

Loved this recipe. Made it for a dinner party. Used a trifle bowl-looked great!  Lots of compliments.  I would make it ahead of time-it tasted better the second day. I would also soak the Lady Fingers in the liqueur for more intense coffee flavor! Very easy to make.

I made this recipe last night and it turned out delicious! I added spiced rum to the strong coffee. Approximately 1 part rum to 2 parts coffee and this can be changed depending on how strong you like the taste. I used hard ladyfingers and poured the coffee/rum mixture on top of the cookies instead of dipping them. I added cocoa powder to the top and sprinkled semisweet chocolate chips on top as well. I brought it to work today and everyone said it tasted amazing! Definitely worth the trouble!

I made this for Christmas dinner - nothing but raves!!!  I followed the advice of the man at the Italian market and bought the "good" mascarpone, instead of the less expensive stuff - I don't know if it made a difference or not, but what a hit!  Also couldn't/didn't split the hard cookies - not a problem to use whole.

Amazing!! I married into an Italian Family and Tiramisu is my mother in law's signature dessert.  I bought a tub of Mascarpone cause it was on sale.  I made this recipe, my father in law just started laughing hysterically once he took a bite, then my husband and his brother started to laugh. This recipe beats my MIL's hands down!!!  The men just kept their heads down and ate, knowing that I was in trouble cause this was soooo good!!!  So, thank you !!!  Oh, I used Grand Marnier with the espresso.  YUM!

My first time making any sort of Tiramisu and my boyfriend was totally blown away. I was fortunate enough to find the ladyfingers for 1.06 a package and the mascarpone was 3.99 for a 16 oz. tub. Not one reviewer gave advice on how to keep the outer ladyfingers upright while preparing so it was a challenge. Mine were crunchy so I dipped them for just a second and they came out perfect. I used 1/2 Bailey's (because I always have some around) and 1/2 strong coffee. I would recommend to the cooks that had problems with it setting properly: it's always a good idea to fold in a little of the cream at a time, and be gentle. Thanks Carol for the great recipe!!

I really liked this recipe because it was one of a only a few tiramisu recipes I could find that cooked the egg yolks.  It is a beautiful, fun dessert to make but I made the following modifications: 1) I soaked the ladyfingers for 2 secs instead of brushing them as it gave much more flavor, 2) I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup as we thought it was too sweet.  Other than that, great!

This is not a bad recipe. However, I believe this should be called maybe Carol's Tiramisu. A real ''classic'' tiramisu requires that you use egg whites (not whipping cream). For the ladyfingers, you can seek some at your local italian restaurant or shop online to find ''Savoiardi'' ladyfingers (Savoiardi are made specifically for tiramisu) and although coffee flavored liqueur sure is tasty...the Classic italian recipe calls for using expresso. This author played with the recipe and the result is not bad at all. However, if you are seeking a true classic recipe I would suggest you browse other recipes which list the ingredients I have. Not to say Im a food snob, but I prefer any recipe that claims to be 'Classic' to indeed BE a classic recipe.

This recipe is the closest I have found to that we made while working in a little neighborhood restaurant in Italy. Interestingly, the Italians rarely use liquor in their tiramisu recipes, just the expresso. So I changed this recipe a little to do a 50 / 50 compromise with Kaluha and expresso. i also dipped each ladyfinger quickly on both sides in the mixture to give a little more flavor instead of brushing them. I then laid them on a rack to await assembly. It did not take nearly the number of ladyfingers that was asked for in the recipe, but mine might have been longer cookies. Lastly, I garnished the recipe with chocolate covered expresso beans and my dinner party guests thought it was the best Tiramisu they had ever tasted. And several are world travelers and had had tiramisu at some of the top restaurants around Europe. It also received rave reviews from second graders and their Italian teacher when I took it to their class for Italian Day. Finally, it was so good, my Pilates instructor gave me a free training session for bringing her a sample - and this is a woman who swears you should NEVER have refined sugar in your diet!!!

This is better than any tirimisu I have ordered in any restaurant.  I use strong coffee with some DaVinci sugar free kahlua flavored coffee syrup (sold in coffee aisle near creamers, etc) instead of alcohol. I also pipe sweetened whip cream all over the top before garnishing with chocolate curls.  For the chocolate curls I use giant sized Hershey bars, one Special Dark, one Regular and One Symphony.  I only use maybe about 1/3 of each bar, but the tri-colored chocolate is pretty and tastes great too!  If you want a dessert that looks AND tastes great, this is the one... a bonus is that it is a "make ahead" recipe!  This one takes a little time and effort, but it is SOOOOO worth it!

I have made this recipe numerous times to rave reviews.  I usually use the soft lady fingers that I buy at Trader Joe's (about 1 1/2 packages).  They taste so much better than the harder lady fingers that are found elsewhere.  I also buy the mascarpone cheese at Trader Joe's and find that one 8 oz tub is sufficient.  Instead of all Kahlua, I mix together about 1/4 cup stong coffee, 2 Tbsp of Kahlua, and 1-2 tsp rum extract.  I think that the rum flavor really makes the Tiramisu taste special.  I make this in a 8" trifle bowl, alternating 4 layers of lady fingers with 4 layers of the cream mixture.  I usually just finish up with the cocoa powder and skip the grated chocolate on top.

I made this for dessert on Christmas Eve to be eaten Christmas day. I used 1 1/2 cups of mascarpone cheese as someone suggested and alls i could find were the crunchy lady fingers. They worked perfectly. I also used 1/2 c. water and 2 TBLS of instant coffee and 1/2 c. coffee liqueur mixed, rolled the lady fingers in the mixture to soak for a few seconds then lined the pan. (I did not have a problem with chewy lady fingers.) I also didn't have a bar of semisweet chocolate so used some chocolate chunk chips i had left over, put them in a food processor to crumble and this worked really well for the topping. Thank you for this recipe! It was perfect!

This recipe came out perfect! I followed the recipe exactly as it was and there were no changes that needed to be made. I used the soft lady fingers and Kaluah for the coffe liquor. It tasted delicious and it got a lot of compliments and it looked beautiful.

I subbed the mascarpone with 8 oz. cream cheese,  1/4 c. cream (which is what you have leftover from a pint in this recipe-so you'll use it all if you buy that size), and 2 T sour cream. Also subbed the liqueor w/ 1/3 rum as mentioned in here someplace. AWESOME RECIPE. 1 more thing for my friends to ask me to make for their birthday parties. Ha!

Since everyone seems to be somewhat at a loss as to the "traditional" biscuits to use, they are called savoiardi biscuits--they're usually sold right alongside the sponge lady fingers.
 
I basically followed this recipe but I used the savoiardi biscuits instead of the sponge lady fingers.  I ended up using a bit more coffee liqueur than called for as I dipped the biscuits into the liqueur rather than just brushing them.  Hubby is a tiramisu expert of sorts and he said it was one of the best ones he's had over the years.  Both my hubby and I agreed that we could skip the extra 1/4 cup of sugar and that Tia Maria liqueur would be preferred over Kahlua in this particular recipe.  This dessert needs to sit for AT LEAST 24 TO 48 HOURS to really allow the flavors to come through.

Living in Europe for the last 3 years, I have a certain fear about making tiramisu and serving it at my home.  Everyone here has been to Italy and other places around Europe and have had some awesome Tiramisus. How could I compete right?   Well, this recipe helped me to do it.

I made it last night with a spring form pan.  It didn't solidify properly for a couple reasons.  1. my whipping cream didn't whip so well 2. my spring form pan leaked.  But I left it til morning.  My husband thought it "looked" awful but he said it tasted good.  He put it in a bowl and took it to work.  He left it in the freezer by mistake and then took it out.  According to the 4 calls I got from the office, it was delicious.  Presentation isnt everything afterall.

So, tonight, I ditched the spring form and used a large flat glass bowl about 4 inches deep. The presentation is great because you can see through the bowl and see the layers of fingers and custard.  

I couldn't get my chocolate to curl though.  I just put little chips on top.  I used the most delicious Swiss chocolate that I picked up recently on a trip.  I topped it with a cherry and it looks great.  I didn't use lady fingers because only the hard ones are here in Germany.  I used these delicious little mini cakes, shaped like lady fingers, called Madelinas.  By themselves, they are delicious.  I also used kaluha, coffee and warmed it a bit with maple syrup to make just a little thicker.  It really helped avoid the soggies.

I put it in

Awesome!! This is the best Tiramisu I've made or eaten!  Made this twice during the holidays for different gatherings and it was loved both times by everyone!  The only change I made was the second time I made it and I all but doubled the amount of the coffee mixture that I put on the lady fingers, which for me was a mixture of strong coffee and kahlua. Couldn't really taste it enough the fist time.  This recipe is even better if it sits in the frig at least 2 days.  Yum!  This will be my new specialty dessert!

This is such an delicious and easy recipe!  It took me exactly 35 minutes, from the moment I started the recipe until it went into the refrigerator.  Make sure that you cook the eggs long enough that the sugar is no longer crystalized.  Next time I make this I am going to try to just use 8 oz. of marscapone and substitute the rest with cream cheese/whipping cream.  Marscapone is expensive and I don't think that subbing 1/4 cup of cream cheese would make too much of a flavor difference.

This tiramisu is absolutely phenomenal!   I only made one change and that was to brush the ladyfingers with a mixture of amaretto liquor and Godiva chocolate flavored coffee.  A friend of mine, who loves tiramisu, after she tried it said that this was better than what she had in Italy.

This was amazing! The only problem I had making this was that my dogs ate my lady fingers! This was 10:30 at night and I was too tired to make my own and no stores were open to get more. I  make my marcapone cream mixture and fridged it overnight. I also halved my Kahlua with expresso. The next day it all came together easy as could be! I allowed this to marry overnight and got rave reviews. Thanks so much for a fabulous recipe!

This was my first attempt and something like this and I can say I was rather skeptical.  The labor that went into it was well worth it!  I didn't have a any liqueur on hand so, I just used espresso and instead of sifting cocoa powder, I sifted finely ground coffee on top.  This is by far the best tiramisu I've ever had.  

I had many requests for this dessert!  Thank you!

I made this recipe for a fella at my station who was getting transferred, for his going away dinner. It was my first time making it and it turned out great, and the whole thing was gone very quickly.

This was much easier to make than I thought.  I used kahlua flavored coffee and mixed very strong coffee with it to brush on the lady fingers.  I also had 3 extra packages of lady fingers; which means I'll buy 3 less the next time. Yummy!

Fabulous!!!  The only changes I made were to use Kaluha and espresso on the lady fingers (instead of just the Kaluha).  I also baked my own lady fingers using a recipe on this site.  The tiramisu filling was so light and perfect.  This is quite honestly one of the best tiramisus we have ever had and we love tiramisu.  I've made this recipe three times so far and I definately plan to make it again.  Delicious!

I have had a few marriage proposals over this one, some of whom were married... I did do a few things of my own though... I baked the lady fingers found in the bakery section until they were golden brown and brushed the coffe mixture over them instead of dipping them... it holds together much better that way.. and it's worth the effort to find marscapone cheese... I also make mine in a square glass baking dish instead of a triffle or springform... it's easier to serve that way...I recommend making this a day or two before you plan to serve it, the flavors mesh much better that way.. overall I'd say its well worth the time you put into it to get such a great dessert out of it.... thanks Carol!

WOW!  This was great!  I have tasted several versions of tiramisu, but this was the first time I made it myself, and this was easy and delicious.  I don't like the taste of alcohol in desserts, so instead I made 2 cups of double-strength coffee (next time I would make a little more).  I followed several previous reviews' suggestion and dipped the ladyfingers in the coffee instead of brushing it on.  (A mini loaf pan was the perfect size, and I just dipped them in for a few seconds on each side.)  The only problem I had was that my trifle bowl (or maybe the way I arranged the cookies) made it so that there was about 1.5 inches of ladyfinger sticking out above the top layer of filling.  So I used the whipped cream recipe on this site (1 cup whipping cream, 1 tspn vanilla, 1 Tbspn powdered sugar) and added that on top to sort of fill up the bowl.  It turned out fabulous!  My husband (the artistic one) made this neat little cut-out, and we laid it on top before we topped it off with the cocoa so there was a nice design.  I don't think I have ever made anything that looked so pretty like something you'd buy in a store!  And everyone raved, even those who said they didn't like coffee.  So overall, you have GOT to try this.  I will be making it any time I want to impress. :)

This is a fantastic recipe that looks gorgeous and tastes divine.  A couple of thoughts: (1) I used a springform pan which made it look professional; (2) at first, my custard also had small yellow eggy bits but it was because the heat was too high --- make sure you stir at the lowest heat on your burner and you shouldn't get any bits; (3) I dusted with cocoa powder the night before and it ended up looking very dark and wet so I redusted before serving and in the future will dust just before serving; (4) I used very strong Turkish coffee (2 tablespoons to 1/2 cup water)instead of the liquor and it turned out perfectly; (5) I garnished with Pirouette cookies which looked really cute and festive.

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!!
I used coffee as well as Kahlua to coat the sponge fingers but kept everything else the same. I tried a bit after about 4 hours and didn't think much of it. After being in the fridge overnight the flavours developed and the taste was amazing.

Sorry for the rating, but it was mostly my fault.  I've never made tiramisu before, and I didn't see how only 1/3 c kaluah could soak up and turn those hard ladyfingers into a cake-like texture.  So...I decided to pour some kaluah into a bowl and coat both sides of each ladyfinger (only for a second!) and then layer them in the pan.  BIG mistake!  I served this for Easter at my church potluck, and there were alot of people there that dont usually attend church, so you can imagine what they were thinking!  My pastor's wife refused to put it away, because it went well!  Evryone loved it anyhow!  But it did no turn out good to my standards.  I think it is also missing espresso or coffee, and I had a hard time getting things to whip to stiff peaks.  Having cooked the yolks could have something to do with it, they wouldn't cool down enough to whip properly.  I think I'll try another recipe next time :-(

Made this Saturday night for a Sunday party. Got nothing but rave reviews and requests for the recipe. I was impressed how easy this is to make. Would suggest incresing the Kaluha to about 1/2 cup just to enhance flavor some, other than that recipe is perfection!

This is a very great and simple recipe.  I make in a 9 x 13 pan instead of trifle dish or spring form pan.  It still tasted great. I used extra ladyfingers and liquor to adjust to the size of the pan but it was resturant quality.  All my guests loved this recipe.  This is the first recipe for Tiramisu that did not call for coffee and liquor so it was not very soggy.  A+

next time i'll use more cheese and less whipped cream. i might even put in some unflavored gelatin. the filling was too soggy and with every slice i served the filling just caved more and more into the bottom.  that said, i must admit that all 18 of my guests raved and thought it was heavenly.

This was very good and not to hard to make.  I put a little too much kahula in mine (read the reviews and thought I would dip the lady fingers in it).  It was a litte to strong but next time I'll just brush it on.  It was a huge hit!  I had to give them all the recipe!

I made this for my roommate (her favorite dessert).  She said it was great, but said it needed a little more kahloua.  she suggested a quick dip of the lady fingers into the coffee liquour instead of just brushing it on.  I also shaved Milk chocolate on top (about a half a bar of See's chocolate).  Thanks for the recipe, she is reqesting I make it for her birthday.

This was fabulous!  Needed much less ladyfingers than called for but maybe that is because I used the crisp variety rather than soft cakey ones?  Anyway it was great and looked beautiful, I am sure I will make this again.

I did not have coffee liqueur so I brewed some coffee and added a little rum!  YUM!  I made this in a trifle bowl and only used two packs of ladyfingers, total 6oz.  This was wonderfully easy and quick to prepare.  I had my husband working as sous chef!  I made this for a co-worker's birthday and he is a tiramisu lover, and he absolutely sang praises for this rendition.  Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out very good! However, I had a problem that I didn't see anyone else mention. When I stirred the egg yolks in a double boiler, they cooked! I didn't realize it so after stirring 10 minutes on lowest heat, I tried to whip it in a kitchen aid and nothing was happening except it was getting dryer and stiffer. The problem was a very thin metal double-boiler steamer pan - it held too much heat! I started over with new eggs, and used a small pan with a thick ceramic bowl over it, and stirred for 5 minutes. It was smooth, sugar dissolved and it was beautiful! When I whipped it in a cold bowl, it was perfect! So watch out for a bad double-boiler. If it looks wrong ( not like in the video -  then it is cooked.) Used soft lady fingers, used up 2.5 packs of 12 each -made in 9X13 pan.  Added  1/2 cup espresso to Kahlua. Also sprinkled cocoa over 2nd layer of ladyfingers. Will make again!

This recipe is phenomenal! I make it in a springform pan, and it comes out perfect every time. Took the advice of other members and halved the sugar. Used the mascarpone substitute from Giada' s website (Googled mascarpone substitute), and strong coffee so it's kid-friendly, and my world-travelling best friend says it's the best she's ever had. Really hard to find lady fingers where I am, so I use (2) 12 oz packages of Stella D'oro brand Margherite (spelling?) cookies, and the recipe uses every single one, minus two or three for snacking. Can't even tell that it's not exactly authentic. Super easy to make, and delicious to boot. It'll even impress the in-laws.

I use only 1/4 cup of white sugar, or it is extremely sweet. I also use biscoff cookies soaked in coffee and Kahlua turns out perfect :)

The first time I made this Tiramisu I used the accect recepi. It was way to strong for us. The second time I made it I changet it up a bit. I used 1 cup of very strong coffee and 3 Tablespoons of coffee flavored liqueur mixet together. I cooled the coffe mixture in the fridge wile I mixed the othed ingrediants. The flavor was great and we were able to enjoy it better.Also it's much better if you make it the a day before you serve it to your guests. The flavor is much better the next day.

Great news everyone, you can make your own mascarpone cheese at a fraction of the price and it tastes great, easy too.  However you have to make it at least one day before making your tiramisu. In a double boiler bring one quart of heavy cream to 90 degrees farenheight (takes about ten minutes).  Stir often to keep the cream from scorching.  Add one tablespoon of tartaric acid, (or try one tablespoon of lemon or lime juice or one tablespoon of vinegar). Let cool.  Keep stirring until you begin to see separation of whey (clear liquid).  Line a sieve with three layers of cheese cloth or three coffee filters and place sieve over a pot or bowl.  Pour  cream inti sieve and cover.  Place in fridge overnight to allow the whey to drain.  The next day, vola, you have mascarpone cheese.  Peel away filter and place cheese in an airtight container till ready to use.  Use within five days.  I suggest you google this and or watch you tube videos.  Now for my rating, great recipe but way too much sugar and I do have a sweet tooth.  Will definatly make again but less sweet.  Thanks for sharing.

Made this for my son's 12th birthday...at his request (tiramisu is one of his favorite desserts) and we all loved it! That included my husband who said he wouldn't like it because he hates coffee...and then loved it so much he was a little greedy eating 3 bowls! But in all fairness he has never liked any that we've tried in restaurants. My son keeps asking me when I'm going to make it again. I'm going to have to soon. Very, very good!

This tiramisu was absolutely lovely. I baked my own lady fingers using another recipe, and I love how the eggs are actually cooked in this one! I substituted mascarpone with cream cheese, and it turned out just as good, if not better. I also added some coffee to the whipped cream AFTER it was already whipped, and it gave the cake more of a coffee flavour which I found very nice. I'll definitely make this again!

I made this for the first time for our family Christmas dinner.  Each year we do a dinner from a different country and this year it was Italian themed. I chose this recipe because of the cooked eggs and the ease and clarity of the directions. I did omit the liqueur and used strong coffee mixed with some  Herseys syrup for brushing the ladyfingers. I also made it in a 9 X 13 pan for ease of cutting and serving.  It came out beautifully cut into nice neat squares, not runny at all.  It was loved by all and everyone said it was the best they had ever had. My own birthday is coming up very soon and I will be making it for myself as my birthday cake!  One note on another review that was helpful to me was being very careful not to cook the egg yolks at too high of a temperature or they might cook through and get lumpy, like scrambled eggs.  I made sure I constantly stirred the eggs and never left them for the entire 10 minutes. I wanted to make sure they were really cooked so I think I actually cooked them for closer to 12 minutes.  Thank you Carol, for sharing such a great recipe!

I have made this many times and it is a great recipe. A little less sugar might be good.  I use way more kahlua than called for. I don't bother to split the ladyfingers. I garnish with chocolate covered espresso beans. I get a lot of compliments on this one.

after reading the reviews i made similar changes, i used 3/4 c sugar and mixed it with the eggs a bit before cooking. i added 1 tsp vanilla to the heavy whipping cream and whipped it in a chilled bowl. used soft lady fingers, 2 packages (but will get one more next time) and used a tbsp to pour the iced coffee over them. turned out fantastic. will make again

I looked up this recipe a few years ago when I discovered my boyfriend was in love with the tiramisu his late father used to make. I decided to make it for his birthday, and he flipped. Everyone loves it. It's become a birthday tradition now, and we even decided to use this recipe for our wedding cake! One of our guests told me that he's never liked tiramisu before, and he went back for fifths!

The first time I made this, the lady fingers made up about half the cost. So since then, I've used angel food cake instead. You can make your own, but I'm usually so busy around my husband's birthday (he has the misfortune of sharing a birthday with Jesus) that I'll just pick two up at the grocery store for $4 and slice it up. It usually takes a bundt cake and a loaf cake. It's slightly sweeter, and not quite as pretty, but delicious.

I followed the instructions as is, turned off the oven when it was done baking, and left it in the oven to cool for an hour. I still had a couple cracks on top but the taste was divine! I just topped it off with some fresh fruits and drizzled melted white chocolates on top and no one knew. Next time I'll try the water bath to prevent any cracks on top.

This recipe is amazing!! I followed it for the most part except I used strong coffee mixed with 2 tbs of rum.  I bought marscapone cheese and lady fingers at an Italian speciality store.  I recommend using the more firm lady fingers since they will absorb the coffee mixture and not fall apart when serving.  This recipe will be used often at my house especially during my Feast of the Seven Fishes dinner on Christmas Eve!

The only issue I had at all with this recipe was that it's a little sweet for my taste. That's a lot of sugar compared to some other tiramisu recipes I've looked at. But it was good. My boyfriend loved it.

I was a little concerned about this recipe as most other tiramisu recipes call for at least SOME espresso or strong coffee and not just liqueur.  I was able to fit 3 layers into my pan and it seemed as though I had to use more like 1/3 cup of liqueur per layer instead of 1/3 cup for the whole recipe... that being said, the liqueur flavor was very strong.  I will make this again, but next time, instead of just liqueur, maybe combine 1/2 cup liqueur and 1/2 cup espresso to brush onto the lady fingers.

Make sure that you added the yolk mixutre to the marscapone first!! I accidentally added the warm yolk mixture to the whipped cream and totally killed it.  I used amaretto instead of coffee liqueur, and added some of the amaretto into the cream filling as well.  Since I wasn't going to eat it immediately, I froze it instead of refrigerating it, and the tiramisu-ice cream was great!

It was my first time making this dish. I used a 9x13 pan, and substituted amaretto for the coffee liquor. I also doubled the amount, since used hard ladyfingers.My co workers loved it.

This was my first attempt at making tiramisu. I made no changes to the recipe at all and it was FANTASTIC. I couldnt resist and tasted it as soon as it was chilled, and it was good but was much better the next 2 days.

This was very rich.  I brought the egg & sugar mixture up to 160 ° F to make sure the eggs were safe to use.  I also use "Mascarpone Substitute" in place of regular mascarpone which in & of itself worked well.  The ratio of lady fingers to filling resulted in too little filling in the finished product so I only used about 1-1/2 packages of lady fingers.  Even that adjustment still seemed to produce a tiramisu heavy on the lady fingers.  I'd use a lot more cocoa next time since that flavor was lost in the end.  Using a large glass bowl was awkward with the size & shape of the lady fingers.   I think a rectangular glass baking dish would have worked better.

I think next time I will use the espresso instead of kahlua.  The liqueur is more sweet than coffee tasting and I personally like the coffee flavor.  Very easy recipe and the sub for mascarpone someone mentioned is awesome.

I have made Tiramisu all of my life and being Italian I have to comment on this one. Please do not cook the eggs yolk with the sugar!!!!! It is NOT the way it is made in Italy. Tiramisu does not require any cooking what so ever!  Grazie, Maria

I heard that tiramisu is hard to make. So, when I tried this recipe I was really nervous. But then the tiramisu turned out great and was quite easy to make. I did make few changes to the recipe. I reduce the sugar to 2/3 cup (and for me it's still to sweet, I will use 1/2 cup next time). Also, I only used 250 ml (1 cup) of mascarpone because I can only found mascarpone in 250 ml package. Well, yes I could buy 2 packs but I have no idea what to do with the remaining 85 ml mascarpone. Then, I also used 2 cups heavy whipped cream (to substitute the 1/4 cup mascarpone). Instead of coffee liquer, I used 2 tbsp instant coffee + 1/2 cup water.  With the changes I made, it still turned out great. My little daughter really love it. I will definitely make it again.

This is crazy good! My family and company can't stop talking about this dessert! I understand why some people have trouble w/ the cream. My grandmother showed me years ago how to properly whip the cream and that's the only way I didn't mess it up the first time. Don't give up, you just have to get the hang of it!  Only change I will make next time is to add another layer of ladyfingers in the middle for prettier presentation upon serving.

I just made this for my husband's birthday and it is excellent! I made it on Thursday morning to serve Saturday night, and the flavors blended beautifully! I used only coffee, no liquor, and it tasted perfect! I used the ladyfinger recipe for "Emily's Famous Tiramisu" instead of store bought. The only suggestion I got was to make this with more than 2 layers of ladyfingers. I think next time I will make the ladyfingers thinner and do as many layers as I can. I sifted cocoa and powdered sugar on each layer and pure cocoa on the top.

The soft ladyfingers are the American version as opposed to the hard Italian "cookies". I found that the soft ones absorbed too much of the liquer and the filling wouldn't set. Although the flavor was very good, I ended up making TiramiSOUP! My aunt told me also that it would be wise to do half espresso, half Kahlua (or your choice of liquer).

This turned out fantastic except it wouldn't have been possible without all the helpful reviews! I followed the recipe exactly but reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and added powdered almond biscotti to the mascarpone. The biscotti gave the cream a light almondy-vanilla flavor. I can't wait to see how my guests will like it!

The whole recipe (for ingrediants) was PERFECT!!  I made it for my brother a few weeks ago for his birthday (because he never tried classic tiramisu before), and he loved it.  He liked it a lot, and told me that he thought it wasn't too sweet.

I was a little nervous about the egg mixture at first (I thought that the recipe called for raw eggs in the cream part when whipping, but when I read the recipe through, I saw that they are cooked with the sugar for 10 minutes).  Definately let the egg/sugar mixture cook through before whipping; also make sure to use the double boiler (you can use a medium sized metal or glass bowl on top of a medium sized pot of water if you don't have a double boiler).

Also, instead of refigerating the cake when completed, I put it in the freezer overnight, because the cream wasn't firm...other than that, the recipe is great!

Thanks Carol, and I will keep the recipe in my recipe box! :)

This recipe is amazing...but i made some changes because i wanted it to be exactly as my favorite tiramisu that i used to get from a famous restaurant, so i made a sponge cake for the bottom layer, then the mascarpone cream, then ladyfingers, ending with the cream again. I also reduced the amount of sugar to 3/4 cup as other reviewers mentioned and it turned out perfect. The flavor are great. The only problem was that i had to freeze the tiramisu like an hour before serving for the cream to be more firm....any advice of why this happened??  Other than that, is one of the best desserts i've made!! Everyone raved about it, you can't go wrong with this recipe! Thanks Carol for sharing...

After two tries with this I gave up and tried a different recipe.  The sugar just didn't cook into the eggs.  It remained gritty.  Thankfully, I didn't waste the mascarpone cheese.  I would certainly like to know what went wrong!

This recipe was easier than I thought it would be!  I did cut back on the sugar to 3/4 C. I also whipped the eggs and sugar before putting it on the double boiler.  I kept mixing it on the boiler until I felt the sugar was disolved and no longer gritty.  It shaped up perfectly in a trifle bowl, but the real test will be when we eat it tomorrow night!

Delicious!!  The grocer didn't have mascarpone or ladyfingers so I used cream cheese and a sponge cake, cutting the cake into 4 sections to make two layers in a 7 x 11" pan.  Because I was using sponge cake, I increased the liqueur to 2/3 cup. I added a little milk to the egg mixture.  I think that the next time I make this, I will use a 9x13 and have only the bottom layer of ladyfingers and the entire cream mixture on top.  Olive Garden serves theirs this way, and it is much more attractive on the plate and the servings hold together much better, making for a more attractive presentaion.  It was delicious, I can't wait to make again using ladyfingers and mascarpone!

I have made this recipe twice in a springform pan and both times it was fantastic.  The first time, I followed the recipe to the letter.  The second time, however, I could not find ladyfingers and wound us using these small finger-shaped honey grahams instead.  I just used extra Kahlua to soften them up.  Also, if you'd like to make this over-the-top decadent, place a layer of chocolate ganache on top after the tiramisu has set in the refrigerator.  To make the ganache, melt 4 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate over very low heat with 6 tablespoons of heavy cream.  It's definitely sweet, but if you're going to indulge in something as rich as tiramisu, why hold back?  Happy cooking, ladies and gentlemen.

Ladyfingers were in the frozen food section right next to desserts/pies.  I thought they'd be in the cookie aisle!

I made this tiramisu for a recent dinner party- i followed the directions to the letter, using some of the tips from other reviewers.  I now have bragging rights to the best tiramisu in town- everyone raved about it!  I did have some difficulty finding the ladyfingers and mascarpone (I wanted the authentic ingredients- no shortcuts) but finally had some luck at an Italian market across town.  The results were amazing- definitely comparable to what you would find in an upscale Italian restaurant.  I let it sit for about 3 days in the fridge- like other reviewers said- it gets better and better the longer it sits. I will most definitely make this recipe again and again!!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I couldn't find the mascarpone so I tried the substitute recipe that was recommended by people and the lady finger package. I really did not like the result. It didn't really taste like tiramisu because it tasted far too much like cream cheese. If that was what you are looking for then this is alright, but I wasn't happy with it. I'll try the recipe again but I'll make sure I have the right cheese this time.

Oh, wow, YUM!! I made this for our Italian-themed Christmas and it was delicious. My store didn't have ladyfingers so I used those Italian coffee dipping cookies. It also didn't have marscapone, so I used the cream cheese, sour cream and cream substitute given by a reviewer.  Also, with no hand mixer I just bought an 8 oz. container of whipped cream to fold in. And, I bought one of those little sampler bottles of Kaluha mixed with some strong coffee to coat the cookies. I let it sit overnight in the fridge and it set perfectly! THANK YOU FOR THIS WONDERFUL RECIPE!

I made this for a Sopranos season premiere party we held with some friends.
Following some lasagne rolls this was the perfect finish to the meal.  The tiramisu was sweet, but not too sweet and also nice and light.  I will certainly make this again.

I wish there was an option for ten stars!  This recipe was amazing and fairly easy to make.  I took it to my office Valentine's Potluck and watched it disappear before my eyes.  I particularly enjoyed my boss eating 2 huge platefuls, breaking his diet for the first time in our memory.

I used hard italian lady fingers which may have contributed to my tiramisu not having any structure. Since the lady fingers are hard, I though I would need to really soak the ladyfingers in the kuhlua so they wouldnt be crunchy. Well, I ended up using more than a half a bottle of kuhlua. Do not over do it  because I made it wayyyy too strong. When I took off the spring pan, the cake completely collapsed. It was a mess. We had to eat it like pudding but it was still very delicious! Next time I will definitly drizzle the kuhlua over the lady fingers instead of soaking them and I will use the soft ladyfingers.

MAKE THIS IF YOU WANT TO IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY...AND NOT BAKE.   However, you will get an arm workout from mixing for an hour.  The supermarket near me only sold Tiramisu Mascarpone. (it had a mild Kahlua flavor)  I took a tip from another review and lightly toasted the Lady Fingers for a few minutes.  Then I brushed them with a Kahlua/Chocolate Flavored Coffee mixture.   I also made extra whipped cream for the top of the cake.  
This is perfect for Christmas.  I used a springform pan and put some strawberry syrup and holly around the dish for decoration.  My whole family was taking pictures and everyone took some home.

This pretty much is the recipe off the back of a package of lady fingers. The main difference is this recipe has the quantity of lady fingers wrong. It is two packages, but they are typically 3 ounce packages. Perhaps the 12 came from the number of lady fingers in a package? Regardless, I enjoyed it.

Delicious and creamy, just like restaurant tiramisu.  I made it in a 9" springform pan since I don't have a trifle bowl.  It fit perfectly.  I ended up making 3 layers of ladyfingers and cream since I had too many ladyfingers.  Btw, I usually by ladyfingers at Trader Joe's (only on the west coast?), but they were out so I got supermarket kind which are heavier.  I dusted mine with cocoa on top.
Modifications: I added 1 cup of mascarpone cheese because that was the size of the container.  I ended up using more kahlua, and I dipped the ladyfingers in it, which is probably why I had to use more.  I could really taste it though, unlike when I make the tiramisu cheesecake on this site.  Next time I would reduce the sugar because it was pretty sweet.  And I finally got to see what my KitchenAid is made of when I whipped the cream--that was the best part.

Ten Stars! I used this tiramisu recipe for an Italian Feast I had at my home for 50 people, two days prior to my wedding. It was so delicious, I got some many raves that in my thank you cards I gave them a copy of the recipe! I made this three weeks prior and froze it, the day of, I defrosted it, and it was incredible, maybe even better than the one I made and ate that day!

THE BEST EVER!!!
this IS it!  i was a little hesitant to make this based on some of the other reviews but at the same time, i had committed to bringing tiramisu to an italian dinner party and couldn't back out.  i decided to follow the recipe exactly with the thot that i'd make changes next time if need be.  well, you don't need to make any changes!  its delicious just the way it is!  beyond delicious actually!!!  the one part i didn't get was the amount of ladyfingers it called for.  its not so much that i changed what was called for; there was just no way i could fit that many in the bowl.  i found some ladyfingers in the store but they were 7oz packages.  i thot well i'll get 3 and that should be more than enuf eventho its only 21oz and not the 24 called for.  it WAS more than enuf.  i didn't even get halfway thru the second pack. i'm guessing it was a typo?   also, i would follow Carol's recommendation of letting sit overnight before serving.  2 days would even be better if you can stand the wait.  i made it the morning of and the kahlua was a tad strong.  next day - LOVELY!!!  i'm making a double batch today to bring to a christmas party in 2 days.  can't wait to dig in!!  (also, if you increase the servings to 20, you can use up an entire container of mascarpone 475g - who can have too much tiramisu??!??!)  thanks Carol for the fantastic recipe!!!!!!!!!

Oh. My. God. This was SO awesome! I chose this recipe because the eggs are cooked. I used ladyfingers I made from scratch (see recipe for Ladyfingers submitted by Roxanne on this website). I dipped the ladyfingers completely into the Kahlua rather than brushing, and it didn't turn out soggy or overly alcoholic-tasting. I layered the tiramisu in a bowl, and dusted the top with Hershey's unsweetened cocoa powder. The bowl was literally licked clean at the end of the party with numerous requests for the recipe. I will absolutely be making this again, thanks for sharing it!

This was good but a real pain to prepare. Not sure I would trouble myself again. I cut the recipe in half and only needed 6 oz of ladyfingers. Oh, make sure you use hard ladyfingers or let soft ones sit out a bit before you brush with liqueur, otherwise they expand too much and that is all you taste.

Tasted nice, but not like tiramisu. Needs some coffee.

Cheese mix a bit sweet. I added rum which helped a bit.

I also had a major disaster with my ladyfingers. I made them from scratch and allowed them to sit for about 24 hours before I used them. The problem was that the middle layer floated up to the top! Don't know why or how to not have this happen. Might cut a layer cake in half next time so the middle layer is solid.

I too, had difficulty finding frozen ladyfingers, and after trekking to three different grocery stores, I gave up and followed the suggestion of another reviewer and made my own using a recipe here on allrecipes.  It was so easy!  And it had to be ten times cheaper.  The end result was spectacular, and so pretty!  I got rave reviews from everyone at our party, and no one could believe I actually made it.  I would highly recommend this recipe if you are looking for an elegant and deceptively simple dessert. A+

I found this tasty, but it needed more liquid.  I added 1 cup of strong coffee with the Kaluha, which helped in the soaking of the dry lady fingers, i suppose the soft fingers would'nt need as much liquid, but the coffee added great flavour!  I also tried making some with pre-prepared sponge cake cut into strips as I plan on serving this to seniors and needed a soft product, it was very accepatble and  will be used for an upcoming event, hopefully when I increase the recipe to 100 it turns out.

The only change I made was that I used a processed mascapone cheese mixture with tiramisu flavor already mixed in because I couldn't find pure cheese.  It was sweet and nicely flavored with Kaluha, especially after it sits for a few days.  Even those who did not like tiramisu enjoyed this recipe. The tiramisu fanatic in the house gobbled up almost half the casserole dish in one sitting!  Thank you for sharing.

This was so yummy. I'm guilty of making three substitutions because I didn't have certain ingredients on hand: Cream Cheese for mascapone, vanilla wafers for ladyfingers, and strong coffee for coffee liquor. But it still tastes like the store bought. I made it in remekins and it was delicious overnite. The only bad thing about this recipe was the cooking the eggs part...it was annoying that I had to constantly stir the pot for 10 minutes. But it was worth it!!

The next time I made it again....I put everything into an ice-cream maker and OMG tiramisu ice-cream is heavenly!

An excellent recipe! Instead of coffee liquer, I substituted coffee, and added chocolate liquer. I also used a good pound cake instead of lady fingers. Each time I make this, I am asked what school I attended to learn how to cook, or where I bought it!

This recipe is fantastic.  I made this for Easter dessert and got praise from everyone.  If only they knew how easy this was to make!!!!  I used 12 ounces of lady fingers instead of the 24 that the recipe calls for.  24 ounces of lady fingers is a lot!!!  Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks for great recipe!!!

I have made this recipe several times around the holidays, and it's a huge hit.  I have found that it calls for way too many ladyfingers, but that's okay, I just eat the extras as I'm putting the cake together.  Just be sure to dip them in the liqueur first, otherwise they are dry.  LOL (no pun intended).  If you have a nice glass bowl, it makes a nice centerpiece, although it doesn't last long.

Amazing. Followed the instructions except I let the egg/sugar mixture cool first before mixing it with the mascarpone. People just need patience when making this. It is a lovely dessert and one of my friends called it comfort food.

not bad, but the coffee liqueur in addition to all the sugar made it too sweet for my taste. I will be trying a different recipe next time.

I made this recipe my one.  The following are ways I tweaked this recipe...that I believe made it better.
- ~6 oz dark rum and strong coffee mix (used to baste each layer of ladyfingers)
- ~8 oz cream cheese & ~8 oz mascarpone (homemade is a lot easier than one might think, not to mention the awesome taste)
- Homemade Ladyfingers
- Used 1 cup sugar, vice 1 ¼ cup.  
For the mascarpone I simply purchased a cheese making kit from: 
http://www.cheesemaking.com/Mascarpone.html#Anchor-Option-49575
    *Great site for those who want to get into cheesemaking*
The biggest impact I noticed on taste improvement, was the ½ & ½ mixture of cream cheese and mascarpone.  The taste was creamy, sweet (but not too sweet), with almost a tang.  This is a recipe I will be making again!  The only changes I will be making are the shape of the cake.  
    *I do not want to toot my own horn, but I was impressed and so were my guests*

This was heavenly:) We ate the whole thing. Would add rum extract instead of rum, when there are kids involved. I used smaller Ladyfingers, so I didn't cut them in half. I rolled them in the coffee/rum mixture I made, and proceded with the directions as written. Happy eating:)

This recipe calls for 2 (12 oz packages) of lady fingers, which would be 24 ounces.  We got 6 packages which amounted half the weight required.  We had way to many lady fingers.  In comparing other recipes the lady fingers are soaked in coffee to make it moist.  It was ok.

Made Tiramisu for the 1st time using this recipe and it was so very simple with no fuss at all! 

Although I must say that I was pretty sure I used more than 80ml of coffee liqueur which is fine by me. :)

I brought this dessert to a family dinner and received rave reviews! Absolutely delicious!

Thank you for sharing this recipe. It is a must try for those who have yet to make their own Tiramisu.

This was delicious! I had never eaten or made this before and it is so great!  I went to a friends house for dinner and they loved it! I will be making this again and frequently.  Appearantly my mother-in-law loves it and now that she knows I can make it she is already requesting some.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!!!!

Yes, this was by far the best desert I've ever made. It's easy and tastes great! It turned out excellent for the first time. I used less sugar like some reviews suggested. Next one tho I will make it overnight and use a bit more rum (I think I used less than the recipe suggests). Can't wait to make more. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe!!  I used other reviewers advice and got the hard ladyfingers and dipped the entire thing quickly in the coffee (these shouldn't be split).  You just have to be sure you dip quickly or they will fall apart.  Doing it this way avoids the cakier texture of just brushing the coffee on the soft ladyfingers.  Overall, fantastic taste and texture and easy to make! I will definitely be making this again!!

I made this for a dinner party my in-laws were invited to and i got rave reviews back on it. i personally don't think I will be doing the step with egg yolk. I will just mix the mascarpone cheese with the cream. I used coffee flavored mascarpone cheese and used starbucks italian roast instant coffee and it came out great. The egg gave it a real eggy smell that i don't like.

This was the first attempt at tiramisu and I'm hooked.  I gave a piece to my coworker and she couldn't believe that I made it.  She practically melted off of her chair while eating it.  I followed the recipe almost to the dot but made a few minor changes.  Since I'm not a huge fan of alcohol, I used a strong black coffee to brush on the lady fingers instead.  My coworkers said I have converted them to virgin tiramisu lovers.  Also, definitely let it sit overnight or atleast 8 or 9 hours so that it sets properly otherwise it is too runny.  The only other change I made was I cooked the egg yolks and sugar for 5 minutes rather than 10.  I may decrease the sugar to just over 1 cup rather than the 1 1/4 cups next time but that's it.  This is a keeper and I can't wait to make it again!

Made this for a dinner party and not only was it much easier than I anticipated, but my guest loved it.  Could not find mascarpone so I substituted ricotta.  Worked fine. I think the only way to improve will be to make my own lady fingers--hmmm.

I'm sorry...but I don't think this turned out well at all. I followed the directions exactly, my yolk/sugar mixture was a bit weird and it never set up even after being made over 24hrs in advance. I'm a bit dissapointed because the ingredients were expensive and none of my guests liked it so it all got tossed.

This is the best dessert I have ever made.  I've done it with the mascarpone and also with the sour/cream cheese substitute-- both are amazing!  I do it in my trifle bowl and am able to get 4 layers (instead of 2 as the recipe suggests) out of the ingredients.  This is my favorite tiramisu!

Great Recipe- I replaced the coffee liquor with Rum Cream for a sweeter taste and it was excellent!

Great recipe. the cream although i didnt use the Italian cheese but the common substitute was superb.just remember the coffee taste is very strong and bitter so dip the biscuit lightly until its color is light brown,if the color was coffee dark it will be very bitter. trust me that happened to me . the stiffer you want it the more you must whip the whipping cream only,not the finale mixture!

This is fantastic!  I had never had tiramisu and made it for my fiancee, he was amazed by it..  I did take the suggestion from others and used the cream cheese mixture rather than the mascarpone.. Alsom we have been experimenting with flavored coffees..

I made this twice in two days. Both were very popular at the parties. First day, made it on a 9x 11 tray.. but ran out of the cheese mixture on my layers and had to make more. Second day, i made it in a trifle bowl. Had just enough cheese mixture.  1st try- followed the recipe, found too sweet. For the 2nd try, i did this and it was much better (1) use beater at lowest speed when beating egg and sugar over heat (tip from another reviewer) (2) reduce to 3/4 cup of sugar (3) use strong coffee, add 1 tbs of sugar + 2 tbsp of port wine (4) chill bowl & beater in freezer while making cheese mixture (5) add blackberries on the last cheese mix layer, then another cheese mix layer and cocoa powder..The sourness of the blackberries goes well with the sweet tirammisu....Other tips: (6) use small ladyfingers so no splitting required (7) soak for 3seconds in coffee, otherwise it will just fall to pieces  (8) the blackberries can be replaced with any berries fruits...Carol, Thanks for the delicious and easy recipe!

This was delicious, but I have a couple of pertinent comments!  I went to purchase the ladyfingers, and the packages were only 3 oz (i used soft ladyfingers, maybe that was the difference?); I started to question the number of packages I'd need, but decided to play it safe (I had to purchase 8 packages to equal the 24 oz stated in the recipe @ $3/pkg).  This, of course, was too much!  I should have followed my instincts.  I used about 3 1/2 packages, and that was because i doubled up on layers in order to try to use some of the ladyfingers up.    The other is that 1/3 c of coffee liquor is not enough . . . i actually combined about a 1/6 c espresso and 1/6 c liquor, but either way, 1/3 c liquid is too dry.  There wasn't enough flavor in the ladyfingers.  But the cream was delicious and overall it was a wonderful recipe!  Just keep in mind you do not need to spend $24 in ladyfingers!

Very good! Substituted 1/3 less fat cream cheese for the mascarpone cheese, used strong coffee instead of coffee liqueur, and used 3 (3oz) packages of soft ladyfingers. I also used a Hershey's milk chocolate bar to shave on top.

Great recipe! It always comes out delicious. My family always asks me to make it for special occasions. I add a 1/2 cup of Marsala sweet wine gradually  to the egg yolk mixture while it's on the double broiler. Try it! It gives it amazing flavor. I continue stirring the mixture until the alcohol is cooked out and it's thick enough to cover your spatula. This takes about 20 mins due to the extra liquid but it's so worth it! I also only used 1 cup of sugar and it was plenty sweet. I dunked the ladyfingers for about 1 second in instant dark coffee with 1 tablespoon of the wine (optional). I always use the hard ladyfinger. They soak up the liquid throughout the night and by the time it's ready to eat the next day it's soft like moist cake. Just don't dunk too long or they get too soggy. You want them to be a little hard when your layer them. Soo good! Thanks for the recipe!

No way can you skip mascarpone in this!! It's so uniquely rich and wonderful... it will take this recipe over the top! My only change was to mix strong coffee with the liquer. I tried the recipe as-written and had a chef-friend critique...after adding the suggested strong coffee to the liquer, it really made a wonderful difference. --A fabulous recipe otherwise! Made for a big birthday party and everyone raved! YUM!!

WOW! This was great. I used the ladyfinger reciped from this site and they were quick to make. Coffee liquor is essential! It adds the flavor. I used the whole pint of the whipping cream ( I didn't want to throw away 1/4 cup) It tasted good after about 10 hours in the fridge but was definitely better the next day as others have mentioned.

Having never made a Tiramisu, I decided to try this recipe after looking over many others.  Good decision as this was absolutely delicious (according to everyone who tried it).  I took the advice of one reviewer and cut back the amount of mascarpone cheese and sugar to 1 cup each, since the mascarpone in my store comes in 8-oz. containers only.  I used strong coffee mixed with a little Kahlua on the ladyfingers.  While no one complained about the taste, I personally think it might be better with espresso or strong coffee only.  I will also "baste" the ladyfingers lightly with the coffee.  The texture and taste were wonderful.  I highly recommend it.

I could not find soft lady fingers and had to brew coffee to make them soft.  I like the liquor on mine so I did 2/3 C.  1/3 for the coffee and 1/3 to brush on top.  My lady fingres had a sugar crust and sugar in the coffee was not necessary.  This is a very good recipe and you will not be dissapointed.  I will do less sugar next time 3/4C (it takes a while to dissolve with the egg yolks) and will add 1/2C of confectioners sugar to the whipped cream.

This a really good recipe.  I made the lady fingers from scratch.  I also took a cup of strong coffee and added the 1/3 cup of coffee flavored liquour to it before pouring on the ladyfingers.  It made it much better.  Make sure the coffee is cold.

I make Tiramisu all the time using the crunchy Lady Fingers (you can find the soft ones in most bakery departments) I think (for me atleast) that the Lady Fingers soften over time. I make the Tiramisu the day before, keep in the refrigerator overnight. I have always worried about soggyness if I were to use the soft Lady Fingers.

I made this desert and it was FANTASTIC!!! The only thing I did differently was I did not split my ladyfingers. I used the hard kind and I dunked them in Kahlua for a second on both sides. THe cake turned out very moist (not soggy at all). We ate a half of it between 4 people and everybody got seconds!!! Thanks for a great recipe.  I am making again next week for my birthday.

Really good, just like the best restaurant tiramisu.  I never could get the chocolate to peel into pretty curls like that, but otherwise it turned out great.  This is a labor intensive recipe but not overly complicated - just time consuming, but worth it.  I followed the recipe to the "t" - didn't make any changes.  I used good Italian mascarone, fresh ladyfingers, and real Kahlua, not a cheaper coffee liqueur.  I took it to an Italian potluck dinner, and everybody raved about it.  Ten star recipe.
This is an update to my previous review:  I made it a second time and used most of 3 packages of ladyfingers instead of 2, which wasn't quite enough.  It takes more kahlua than 1/3 cup to sufficiently coat the ladyfingers.  And, I still can't get the chocolate to curl using a potato peeler.  What's the trick?  I'm going to get some chocolate covered coffee beans and put around the top rim of the trifle bowl for a garnish.

INCREDIBLE! I was looking for the perfect tiramisu recipe, and I found it. I made this in a 9x13 glass pan, and it fit perfectly. I made 3 small cups of bold, dark coffee using my Keurig coffee maker and substituted it for the coffee liqueur. Other than those changes, I followed the recipe completely, and it tasted better than many Italian restaurants' tiramisus I've eaten! In fact, I'm making it again for this weekend!

The way the recipe is written, I would rate it 4 stars. I had to reduce the sugar and whipping cream somewhat b/c the mascarpone cheese came in 8 oz containers, so I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup whipping cream. In my opinion, espresso should be incorporated into this recipe. I made 4 cups of espresso (using espresso cup measurements). In the espresso, I mixed 1 tablespoon of Ameretto liquor and a couple teaspoons of sugar (you could taste it to make sure it's not too bitter, but you still want to maintain a stronger coffee flavor). I poured the espresso mixture into a square pyrex-like baking dish. I dipped both sides of the ladyfinger (Balocca Savoiardi brand) cookies into the espresso mixture and lined them up in a Springform pan.

This recipe for Tiramisu is ridiculously good.  I had always been a bit nervous about making tiramisu, because I had heard it was difficult.  The recipe for this was easy and accessible.  I used the "hard" lady fingers and actually dipped them into coffee, versus brushing them as the recipe suggests.  Other than that I just followed the recipe.  It was so easy.  Thank you for providing such a wonderful recipe.

I made this using Kaluha to brush on the lady fingers and I used cream cheese instead of the marscpone cheese and it was fabulous!. I purchased one of those extremly huge martini glasses from Walmart for $12.97 and made it in that. I made for a very nice presentation. I tied a red tulle bow around the stem of the large glass since it was for Valentine's Day and it looked just awesome.

Overall an exceptionally delicious end result! As others have mentioned, be sure to add more coffee/liquid and get SOFT lady fingers that soak up the liquid. Also, make this dessert a day in advance and refrigerate for AT LEAST 24 HOURS to ensure it will be the correct consistency upon serving. These were the 2 things I overlooked- despite my oversight it tasted great! I'm excited to try it again, implementing these learnings.

Absolutely Perfect!  I would not recommend using a trifle dish because it makes it too deep and hard to serve.  Maybe a 9x9 dish if you don't have a springform pan.  I did not dip the lady fingers just brushed heavily and they were the perfect consistency.  The longer it sat the better it tasted so definitely make a day or two before you need it.

I found this exact same recipe on the back of my package of ladyfingers. Instead of coffee liqueur, I brushed the spongy ladyfingers with coffee. I used two 3-ounce packages of ladyfingers and assembled the tiramisu in a springform pan. I found that I fell short of a few ladyfingers, and I have yet to find a successful technique of layering them in the bottom of the springform pan in a neat and organized fashion. I refrigerated the tiramisu overnight but made the mistake of letting it come to room temperature before serving. You MUST serve the tiramisu as soon as it comes out of the refrigerator or else it will be too soft and literally melt! I've never tasted tiramisu before; the adults liked the coffee flavor and even thought that the tiramisu was a little too sweet. In contrast, the kids disliked the bitter coffee flavor and wanted a sweeter taste. But perhaps that's just how tiramisu tastes. It's more of an adult, not a kid, dessert. At least with a dusting of cocoa powder and chocolate shavings, the presentation was lovely.

Amazing! I took the finished product to a party and it was a HUGE hit! I used 1 cup sugar and 8oz. regular mascarpone, and 8oz. tiramisu coffee flavored mascarpone. YUM! I also used espresso and Kahlua rather than the coffee liquor.

Right idea, wrong amount of sugar. If one looks at traditional recipies for this, they have far less sugar. I tried this recipe with about the same amount in Fructose, but like almost all the other sweets on here, I must make at minimum, 2x more (for 3x total), and use no sugar, then spread the ingredients. How can anyone taste the ingredients when there is so much white sugar in the recipe?! Also, I would not worry about the raw eggs. Salmonella is from factory chickens and eggs, and regardless only exists on the outside of the shell.

Delish!  Made exactly as written, but could only let sit for 3 hours.  I used Kahlua and brushed it on, but wish I had dipped, it needed more.  The bakery of my HEB had ladyfingers back in the freezer. I used other reviewers tip of getting two 3oz. ladyfinger packages, but I actually needed a few more to layer properly, so will get three packages next time. To approximate a double boiler I put a few inches of water in a pot, then put heavy foil over the top, then put a metal bowl on top of the foil and settled it down with the ingredients in it.  It worked, but was very hard to take the bowl out, as everything was extremely hot and I spilled a little bit as I burned myself. I used a springform pan and presentation was great. Next time will put cocoa powder in the cream mixture to add taste, as my cream tasted just like whipped cream, kinda boring.

This was delicious!  My first time making tiramisu and it was a HIT!  I made it for dessert this past mother's day and it got rave reviews.  I mixed the Kahlua with about 6 oz of expresso and dipped the lady fingers into it before putting into a spring form pan.  Topped it with some shaved Ghirardelli semi sweet chocolate bar and it was as good as what we get at the expensive Italian restaurants!  You have got to try this...you will not be disappointed!

I've put off making this for a long time and I wish that I would have waited even longer. I should have waited for a special event or something, because this is sooooo good and is beckoning me from the fridge right now. 

Excellent, Excellent, Excellent!

I've made this three times now and every time it has turned out delicious!  Made it for my fiance family at their easter dinner and it was a huge hit!  Definitly will make again and again!  It's definitly better if you let it sit over night so the coffee liquor has time to set into the lady fingers

This is an outstanding tiramisu recipe. I couldn't find any ladyfingers so I used butter cream cake instead and it turned out great. To brush the cake/ladyfingers, I mixed 1 part espresso and 2 parts kahlua to bring out a stronger coffee flavor. Also after putting everything in the springform pan, I drizzle in bits of the espresso/kahlua mix and swirled it around with a toothpick to give more presentation.

At my daughter's request, we had this for dessert at our Easter brunch.  Everyone gave it five stars for flavor and texture.  A few notes: I used a springform pan (10") that was a bit too big; so next time I'll use a 9" or 9.5" pan.  Our top was not fancy, just shaved semisweet chocolate and cocoa powder.  I liked that fact that the egg yolks were cooked, nothing raw.  Awesome dessert, very pleased to have this recipe in my file!!  Thanks, Carol.

This Tiramisu is AWESOME! My mom and I made it for my 18th birthday. We splurged and used all Mascarpone cheese. I couldn't find ladyfingers. We baked 1 pound cake, let it cool and then sliced it. This worked great!

We had a group of friends and family over and we all cooked a dinner of: Grilled Shrimp, Cheddar Bay Biscuits, Sugar Snap Peas and Sweet Potato Bake. It was awesome. All enjoyed.

Have been making this recipe for years, since it was first posted and it's excellent, I make it for Thanksgiving every year and special occasions. Once you get the hang of dipping the lady fingers in the coffee the right amount of time you have mastered the recipe. If they are the hard kind of cookies you have to make extra coffee and dip the cookies long enough until they are soft, but not breaking. Perfect!!

This is an excellent recipe by Carol.  We have used this recipe numerous times at different get-togethers, Italian-themed parties, etc. and everybody loves it and ask for the recipe or asks which bakery we bought it from.  I wish I could take credit for how good it is but it is really Carol's recipe that makes it the best way to finish up a great meal!

Tiramisu turned out to be great! My husband was thrilled. I did soak the ladyfingers in Kahlua. It gave a very rich taste. It was quite challenging. Beat,beat,beat! My hands were so tired, but it was really worth it. This recipe is definitely going into my recipe book!

Dessert from heaven!!!  Me and my bf loves this tiramisu, we can't stop eating.  I modify it a little bit, I use 1/2 cup of starbucks creme coffee liqueur and 1/3 cup of white sugar instead for a 6 servings size.  Thanks so much for sharing.

I loved it! I wish I would have soaked the ladyfingers in the espresso (I used instead of coffee liquer) because I think brushing it on just wasn't enough coffee flavor, but other then that, it was delish!

As many of the reviews said, I cut the sugar in 1/2.  I was quite disappointed.  It didn't seem to have much flavor, and I spent $25.00 on ingredients.

While I don't eat Tiramisu (Lactose Intolerance) my husband thought it was delicious!  It was quite easy to make as well.  I didn't find the ingredients too expensive as others said.  I used coffee liqueur that I made at home rather than buying it - a recipe from this website 'Coffee Liqueur' by Cathie.  
My husband did say it was a bit sweet and maybe next time to cut back on the sugar.  I had a hard time making the chocolate curls, they tended to be more flakes.  But it still looked fantastic and made a nice presentation.

Outstanding!  I made this for family Christmas dessert.  It was really easy to make, and everyone loved it.  It seems to be even better after it sets a couple of days, as the coffee flavor gets richer.

I halved the recipe and made in 2 separate plastic containers. I added 2 cups of strong espresso as adviced and dipped the ladyfingers into the coffee/kahlua mixture for 8 seconds each. interestingly, they tastes better after refrigerated for 2 days. In fact I find the longer you keep, the better it tastes! I will make this 3 days in advance for my next party.

Delicious!  I used mascarpone substitute, 2/3 cup of sugar, strong coffee (1/2 cup water with 2 teaspoons coffee) and three (3 oz) packages of ladyfingers to make 12 individual servings.  I used hand-held electric mixer when cooking the egg yolks/sugar.  It is a lot easier than using a whisk for whole 10 mins.  I made it two days before serving, refrigerated until ready to serve and dusted with cocoa powder just before serving.  The guests loved it and think I am a culinary expert!  One guest’s (man in his 50s) eyes lighted up like a little kid in a candy store after he took the first bite.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe!!  Thanks, Carol.  It is so sweet though so I used half of the sugar what is suggested in the recipe and used normal coffee to replace the coffee flavored liqueur.

One trick for this recipe is, you want to freeze it and thaw it before you serve it.

heavenly.  made it for a family reunion--only two people knew what it was (they oohed and ahhed), but it was gobbled up.  very creamy, but not soggy--i followed advice of the person who said to REALLY beat the cream.  used three packages of the soft ladyfingers from the store, dried overnight.  also, used part espresso for the liqueur (and a little more of both), and let it sit a day before eating.  next time, thinking about adding a little cocoa powder to the custard to make it overall more chocolately (and thicker, too).  very good recipe!  easier than you'd think!

Wasn't going to comment on anything as we all know how good this is! If the reviewer RIGELH sees this, and to anyone who may need to know, whip the cream until it's hard, not just the cream we have with food but over-whip it until it sticks to your whisk in blocks, I've never had problem whipping cream with an electric beater! Also in place of lady finger, I just made sponge cake and sliced it in half horizontally then place it in the dish however fits, it's good for ppl who likes more "cake" than "cream", too. :)

Just a quick answer to those of you who need the ladyfinger. You can find them in Cost Plus or any Russian or European Grocery store.

This recipe is AS GOOD as any tiramisu I have ever tasted in a restaurant and I am a huge fan of tiramisu.  I have made this at least six times and I always get rave reviews.  It is not too soggy, not to dry..........just the perfect combination of light, fluffy mascarpone whipped cream.    My husband requests this every year for his birthday and I am the  now offical tiramisu maker for our family gatherings now! I would suggest you make this the day before and let it sit overnight in the frig. It will not become too soggy and the flavors will have a chance to meld together. Yummmmm!!!!

Received SOOO many compliments on this dessert-will make this recipe over and over. Made only a couple of changes: instead of lady fingers I used two Entenmans Butter Loaf pound cake (which worked beautifully-very moist) and added some espresso to the Baileys coffee liquer that I used (I really think that is necessary to give it the true tiramisu taste). I would recommend definitely searching out the mascarpone cheese (always at the farmers market)rather than subbing for cream cheese - this also adds to the authentic tiramisu taste.  I made this in a trifle bowl and presentation was wonderful! Be sure to let it sit overnight so that the flavors can really meld.  This was SOOOO delicious!!!!

Simply a GREAT recipe...and not difficult at all!  I made it in a springform...what a beautiful presentation!  It went very quickly once the first person who tried it starting raving about it.  I will definately make this over and over again.  Thank you VERY much for this stunning recipe!

This recipe not only tastes terrific but it makes a beautiful presentation in a springform pan.  I did add 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the whipped cream, as suggested by another reviewer, and found that it enhanced the flavor of the mascarpone mixture.  I think it's a good idea to apply the liquid using a pastry brush because you have more control that way, and the ladyfingers absorb just the right amount of moisture without getting soggy. Finally, this is a dessert that gets better the longer it sits.  Definately make this the day BEFORE you intend to serve it for optimal flavor. I will look forward to making this again and again. Kudos Carol and thanks for a great recipe!!!

This was my first attempt at making Tiramisu.  The recipe was very easy and very good.  I wasn't able to split the lady fingers so I used them whole.  I wasn't able to find a 12 oz package so I used 3 3oz packages.  Over all good and easy.

This recipe is so good! I used more of the coffee liquor then it called for and less of the ladyfingers. It came out just perfect! I would suggest this recipe to anyone who loves tiramisu!

I made this for our "Italian" dinner party.  It was wonderful.  Used very strong, black coffee with a bit of rum flavoring (one of those attending won't drink or eat alcohol)  The only complaint I had is that the custard was a bit runny, and not as fluffy as I would have liked.  (although, I may have over-whipped the whip cream)  It didn't matter though, everyone loved it.  Thank you Carol for such an easy and tasty recipe.

This recipe was awesome.  I made it for a get together and received lots of compliments. I will definitely make this one again!!! The only thing I did different was use 1/2cup coffee with a bit of Irish Cream Liquor and I dipped the ladyfingers in the coffee mixture before lining the pan rather than brush them.

This is a great recipe.  I made it for a dinner party that I was having.  I couldn't find ladyfingers, so I used shortbread cookies.  They worked great!  I used a french vanilla coffee liquer instead of Kahlua.  I will definitely make this recipe often!

This dessert tastes great and the presentation is very impressive.  My mom made it first and put it in a trifle dish.  She has a few tips that I thought would add because she showed me today and they make it very easy.  To dip the ladyfingers.  Pour the coffee liquor in the ladyfinger tray which they came in {of course after you have removed the ladyfingers.}  Don't break apart the fingers into individual ones just halved like they come and dip the whole string of them quickly all at once- only dipping one side of them.  Line the bowls edges.  Also we used a hershey bar for the chocolate curls and if you slightly warm in microwave for 15 seconds {just to soften} the curls come out much better.  Don't nuke longer than 15 seconds - bar should still be somewhat hard.  This dessert is probably the best I have had.  Loved it, thank you.

OK so theres a reason this recipe is listed first. It is absolutely FAB and I am a tiramisu snob! We made this in a glass bowl and used regular marscapone instead of that foul tiramusu flavored marscapone..ick! We added some chocolate milk powder to the instant espresso powder and made a sort of "mocha" to dip the lady fingers in. (my kids loved that part) The cheese/egg mixture was so incredibly fluffy and custardlike it was unreal. After assembling the dessert we mixed up another 1/2 c of fresh whipping cream for garnish, and topped it off with sprinkling with cinamon, cocoa powder, and shaved Ghiradellis chocolate. If I had any chocolate covered cocoa beans I would have used those as well. This truly is a keeper, very very very smooth tiramusu. Make it 24hrs in advance of serving, it really makes a difference to have the right consistency. Thanks for your submission Carol! :)

Great dessert!! I served this to 10 people I had for dinner and they loved it!!  Don't get sticker shock from the price of the mascarpone cheese though--it is a little pricey but well worth it..I made it in a springform pan; it was a little hard to keep the servings intact but still tasted great!!

This was very good; however, compared to some tiramisus I've had in restaurants, the custardy part was a little too sweet and runny. Also, next time, I'll put more ladyfingers in the middle layer, rather than so many on the sides.

I visited Italy last summer and enjoyed the real thing several times. This is  a very good version. The filling is quite light as it should be. I served it to friends and it got rave reviews. This is a keeper.

just made this and it turned out fantastic….I followed the video and that was most helpful.I used rum extract rather than the alcohol because I was serving to children and non drinkers.I put it in a 9x13 pan for ease of serving.Well make this again.

This is the most authentic tiramisu I have ever made, and the best my husband has ever had, according to him. Very rich and delicious. I did have to had a little bit of water to the sugar/yolk mixture, but otherwise all went well.

First time ever making Tiramisu. Made for friends 85th birthday. Was nervous about serving as had no chance to taste it before serving. Received many GREAT compliments. Very easy recipe to follow, be sure to allow yourself plenty of time as you don't want to hurry the process. Really fun to make !

I have made the recipe.  It was fantastic.  Very easy.  I used the mascarpone cheese substitute. It turned out excellent.  My family loved it.  It is my son's favorite. So I made it for his Birthday.

This is the best Tiramisu recipe I've made and I've tried a lot of them over the years.  Someone else commented on the lady fingers having to be soft and it's right - you have to get the soft ones - I get mine at Trader Joe's.  TJ also sells Mascarpone cheese at a reasonable price.  Anyway, I made this for the office party last week and it was a huge success.  I also like the coffee liqueur flavor over brandy which is used in some other recipes.  I think the coffee liqueur makes it taste smoother without being overpowering.  This recipe isn't hard to make but you have to follow instructions closely.  Also, you can use just about any bowl but a glass one makes it interesting.  If the bowl isn't exactly the right shape, that's not a big deal.  Just cut the lady fingers to fit properly.  Bon Appetit!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! I did find that it was a bit too sweet so next time I'll use 1 cup of sugar instead of 1 1/4 cup.

Upon reading some of the reviews, I have decided to buy the Savoiardi style hard ladyfingers and dipped them quickly into the espresso mixture instead of brushing the espresso mixture onto the ladyfinger's for a more intense taste. 

As for Mascarpone cheese, I too, followed the rest of reviewers of substituting it with one 8 oz package of cream cheese, 1/4 cup sour cream and 2 tbsp of heavy cream, whipped together. I then refrigerated the mascarpone/egg mixture while I was beating the whipping cream. . And lastly, I poured the mixture onto a cheese cake pan and proceeded to chill it overnight. 

The result? Rave compliments from colleagues and friends all over! This is certainly a keeper recipe!!! Thanks Carol:)

This tiramisu was a huge hit with my family at Easter dinner.  I also substituted the mascarpone cheese with an 8 oz package of cream cheese and a 1/4 cup of sour cream and it worked out very well.  I layered mine in a trifle dish and it looked beautiful.  Great recipe!

I made this Tiramisu as a sweet treat after an evening of appetizers. At the end of the night, I do believe someone had licked the serving bowl clean. The only thing I did different was to add a shot of espresso to the Coffee liquor to give the lady fingers a wonderful rich deep coffee flavor. I used soft ladyfingers and gave the a hick dip in the espresso-liquor mixture so they had more of the sweet coffee flavor than I would have gotten from brushing them. It was the best Tiramisu recipe I have found!

I made this as a special dessert for my sister's birthday. The whole family raved and every scrap was gobbled up! I'm a little confused by the amount of lady fingers that are listed in the ingredients. I bought 3 packages (7-3/4 ounces each) and only had room for 1-1/2 packages in the large bowl I used to assemble it. I wish the recipe suggested a bowl or pan size that it should fit into. My other suggestion is that it needs more coffee flavour. It was too subtle. Next time I will dip each cookie completely in the kalua (or espresso) on both sides. 
Can't wait for the next occasion to make it again and tweak it:-)

Wonderful Recipe, but you only need 2 (3oz) packages of ladyfingers.  I also used a cocoa/water mixture instead of the liqueur as I don't like coffee.  It turned out beautifully.

Great recipe!!! Tastes just like at the restaurants. I just made this for my husband's birthday and have never made a tiramisu before and it is wonderful. I followed some of the recommendations from other users. I didn't like the thought of using only coffee liqueur to moisten the lady fingers but did want to use some so I made a combination of strong coffee (4 tbsp instant coffee to 6 oz hot water) and about a 1/4 cup of the coffee liqueur and dipped the ladyfingers in the mixture. I placed them in a trifle bowl and it looks beautiful! I also followed the other suggestions about chilling the bowl for whipping the whipping cream and also chilled the marscapone and egg mixture while whipping the cream. It all came out beautifully! Will definitely make it again!

Easy recipe! As far as ladyfingers, these can be found in the deli/bakery area of your local grocery stores.  Mascarpone can be found in the deli section at Super Target for $3.19/8oz. pkg. in the Orlando area.

I love this desert and my family does too!!  I have made it numerous times for parties and family and always get rave reviews.  We move alot, and sometimes I have a hard time finding lady fingers where I live.  Sometimes, I can't even find the hard ones everyone talks about!  Once, I ended up substituting the lady fingers with chocolate biscotti and it worked out really well!  I know its not traditional, but it tasted fantastic!  Thanks for this recipe!

I only used 1 cup mascarpone instead of 1 and a ¼ b/c that is how it was packaged at the store.  I also made my own lady fingers using the "lady fingers" recipe from this site.  (they were eggy by themselves, but once in the dessert, not eggy AT ALL).  I added about a ½ teaspoon vanilla to the whipped cream b/c that is how I have always made whipped cream.  I didn’t have coffee liqueur so I made my own concoction of what I had on hand.  I used a combination of Jamaican Rum Cream, Crème De Cacao and strongly brewed coffee.  I also soaked my lady fingers for about 5 seconds in this mixture instead of brushing them.  The liquor flavor really added a nice flavor to the dessert.  I also dusted heavily with unsweetened cocoa (instead of just using a teaspoon).  My husband LOVED this dessert!!!

First time making Tiramisu.  So glad I tried this recipe.  Absolutely delicious.  Followed recipe to the letter except that I used espresso instead of the coffee liquor, and it came out perfect.  I will make this again, but next time I will make it at least 3 days in advance.  It got better and better as it sat in the refrigerator.

This was really good, I baked my own lady fingers. I could really taste the mascarpone cheese and not really taste a lot of the coffee liqueur though. I think I might be use to Tiramisu with a little of the coffee flavor mixed into the filling and not just brushed onto the lady fingers. I dipped my Lady fingers in french vanilla Kahlua (that didn't have orginal here). I am giving it 5 stars for being a good dessert but I might try it with more kahlua or brewed coffee next time.

Great recipe!!!  I only used 8 oz of mascarpone and added a extra 1/4 cup of heavy cream to make up for it. I also dipped the ladyfingers in Kahula for a quick second.  I let sit in the refrigerator for 2 days and it was just perfect! Thanks for the great recipe!

My first  Tiramisu and it was so easy and a big hit with my book group, rave reviews from everyone.  OK, now on to the minor changes I made. The mascarpone container was only 1 cup so I add a 1/4 C of cream cheese & 1 tsp of sour cream to make up the rest, and I added a shot of Kahula to a small strong coffe instead of using straight coffe liqueur on the lady fingers.  Thanks for a great recipe.

This was my first tiramisu effort.  I could not find any ladyfingers at the grocery store, so bought instead a large package of cookies that looked like ladyfingers in an Italian sack.  I was overly generous with the Kahlua, and instead of brushing on 1/4 cup, I sloshed it liberally over the cookies.  When I was done, it looked like I had used about a cup of kahlua -- or a little more.  Other than that I followed the directions exactly, and when it was done we let it sit in the fridge for several hours.  When we tasted it that night, I regretted being heavy handed with the alcohol.  The dessert hadn't set up at all, the cookies were still crunchy, and the whole thing tasted very much like alcohol fumes, so much so that I thought I was going to have to do a rescue effort and make another double or triple batch of the cream (without alcohol) and mix it with this batch to save it.  We never got that far.  The dessert sat in the fridge for another two days, when we tasted it again we were amazed.  It transformed itself into the best tiramisu I've ever eaten.  The alcohol fumes either soaked in or evaporated, and the dish sat up beautifully!!  Truly is the BEST tiramisu I've ever eaten, and I will definitely make it again.  Next time I will make it at least 2 days in advance and I will most likely follow the exact measure for the kahlua.

Wasn't all that. Had difficulty with step 3. Reduced to the sugar to 3/4 cup and despite that, it was still too sweet!!! Overall it was ok. Will not try this recipe ever again.

This is deliciouso. We live in Italy, and my husband declares it was the best he's had thus far! I brushed the ladyfingers in a combo of sweetened espresso and brandy with a squeeze of lemon. Ive made it twice in the last 6 days, the second time for some reason the cream flopped, I must have over-beat it, it separated and curdled. bummer. Am going to give it another go this afternoon, Highly recommended! Just be careful on beating the cream.

This was awesome.  I could not find mascarpone, and substituted cream cheese. Also layered whipped cream over the cheese mixture instead of folding it in, for more richness. Also tripled the liquor because I like it super moist.

absolutely delicious!  My new favorite dessert for when I want to impress.  I used espresso (2 tbsp instant decaf coffee and 1 cup water)instead of kaluha, and used the cream cheese/sour cream/whipping cream substitute for the mascarpone cheese, and it was still awesome.

Delicious! Glad to see that you heat up the egg yolks...so many recipes just use them raw--I just can't do it!! Also I soaked the ladyfingers for a second in a coffee and coffee liquor mixture instead of just brushing the liquid on--made it softer. (i used the hard ladyfingers). What a great recipe!!yummy!

Lol.  I messed this up, but it wasn't the recipe's fault.  The custard part turned out awesome.  I oversoaked my lady fingers with Kahlua and you get a buzz off the fumes.  Everyone just laughed and ate around them.  Next time, it should be better.

The first time I made this Tiramisu was about 3-4 years ago, for my then bf's birthday. Now, my hubby (then bf) only wants this as his birthday cake every year! =) It's really good and easy to make!

I can't tell you how long my Mother has been bugging me to make her Tiramisu and I've always told her no, that it would be too hard to make.  Was I wrong!  This recipe is wonderful and not so hard to make after all.  I did find the soft lady fingers at Wegmans and didn't have to split them in half as they are already split.  I used a mix of coffee liquor and some of our morning coffee that I had saved (although I did forget to brush the 2nd layer of lady fingers).  I also used the mascarpone substitute from this site.  It was wonderful and a big hit with my family, my Mother especially!  Needless to say, she got to keep the leftovers :-)

I've made this twice now and it is one of my family's favorites!  I used Starbuck's Coffee Liquer which made it especially good!

This recipe is excellent, I made it a couple of times and have just gotten great reviews for it.  I made my own version on the mascarpone cheese with one of the suggestions from the reviews and used just instant coffee to soak the ladyfingers.  I have a nut allergy so I made my own ladyfingers with the ladyfinger recipe from this site. Excellent, definitely a thumbs up, fast, easy and great to take at a party.

I made this recipe in a 9x13 dish - usig 2 8oz packages of mascarpone and 2 packages of soft lady fingers from Trader Joes... It fed 15 easily and was a total hit.  I've had multiple requests already for the recipe! I have to admit, it was one of the best I've had... and I'm a Tiramisu fan!

Awesome awesome awesome!  I made some adjustments like some previous reviewers (in lieu of mascarpone I used 8oz of cream cheeze, one-fourth cup heavy cream and 3 tablespoons of sour cream) I bought one 14oz package of ladyfingers. I substituted the coffee liquier with half cup water + 2 tablespoons instant coffee.  I brushed the bottom of a 9x13 baking dish with the coffee mixture and proceeded to build the tiramisu without cutting the ladyfingers in half.  I also dusted cocoa powder over the first layer of the cream mixture.  It just gets better and better the longer it chills in the fridge but I guarantee it wont last that long because it will be devoured first :)

This is a great, easy recipe for fantastic tiramisu.  A few notes based on my experience: first, cool the egg yolk and sugar mixture in an ice bath before adding the cheese (mixture will be very thick and grainy).  I used 2 cups of cooled brewed espresso in place of liquer.  I also used the full 1 lb. of marscipone.  Instead of soaking the ladyfingers, I brushed them after they were placed in the dish (I used a 9x13 in pyrex dish).  Brush them several times so they are very moist.  This is a recipe you will use again and again.

Delicious.  I've made this twice and got rave reviews both times. I couldn't find lady fingers so I used pound cake coated with a liberal amount of kaluah.  It's nice to have a recipe that doesn't involve raw eggs.  Thank you!

This tasted GREAT,but my cream never really set into a thick creamy texture.Was still a bit liquidly at the bottom.Think it is vital to use full cream and not half cream (which I did) and to chill mixture for an hour or so BEFORE layering with biscuits.

I wasn't really a big fan of this recipe. Something still tasted off. I didn't have coffee flavoured liquer so instead I replaced it with strong coffee/espresso and a dash of rum. My friend who I made it for really liked it though so maybe it was just me.

This was just what I was looking for. I did use the sub for the marscapone cheese. (sour cream, cream cheese, Whipped cream). I shaved some of the chocolate into the filling mixture and it was great. Also, I used Stella d'oro original breakfast treats and dipped them into strong coffee then lined a Trifle dish. Excellent presentation. % stars all the way

This was so tasty! My family RAVED forever. I substituted 1/4 cup mascarpone for cream cheese since all I had was 1 cup of the mascarpone. Turned out fine. After letting it sit for 48 hours it was fantastic. Even better sprinkled with some extra amaretto and served with ice cream.

I love Tiramisu, but i was a little disapointed in how it came out for me, the only lady fingers i could find were the soft ones, so when i dipped the lady fingers in coffee they became really mushy so it actually ruined the whole desert, i guess next time i will brush the coffee instead of diping them, other than that the marcapone filling was great. but i will say i will defenetly try it again!

An Amazing recipe and great tasting dessert. It was my first time making tiramisu and I still can't believe how great it turned out. This recipe is definately a keeper. I used hard lady fingers but made sure that I let them soak in the coffee and liquor before making the dessert. Turned out great

Fantastic recipe!  Everybody loved it, even the ones that I thought wouldn't eat it.  The only thing I did wrong was that I went a tad bit past the "stiff peaks" phase in whipping the cream… first time trying.  I couldn't find the coffee flavored liqueur so I perked some strong coffee and stirred some rum extract into it.  I will definitely make this again.

Oh my goodness!!!  This was just divine; everyone raved it was literally the best tiramisu they ever had.  I believe the high quality ingredients I used (organic eggs, cream) really make a difference.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla to the egg mixture.  Delish!

ended up tossing this- was too custardy and sweet and did not have the texture I was hoping for. I thought they had a layer of melted chocolate in there somewhere.

I used only half the sugar and still found it a tad bit too sweet. Other than that, this is an excellent recipe. For a stronger liquer taste, dip the lady fingers in the liquer instead of brushing the liquer on.

I changed this recipe up a bit, instead of lady fingers I baked a chocolate cake and soaked them in the espresso, kahula mixture. The cream I made turned out perfect.

I consider myself a pretty good cook and baker, but I've never tried making tiramisu before.  This recipe was incredibly easy and absolutely delicious.  I made this recipe two different ways for a big Italian-themed party (one in a springform pan and the other as a trifle).  All of it was gobbled up!

SO GOOD (and easy, I think)! I had to whip the cream twice - the first time I was so concerned with getting it whipped-enough that I crossed the threshhold and turned it into butter! :)  Turned out fluffy and great! I had to make one adjustment - could NOT find Ladyfingers anywhere in this town and settled for angel food cake, cut into slices, as a backup. Yes, it was a bit different, but still fine (and a good idea if you'd like to try it).

This was excellent.  I have actually had someone offer to pay me to make one of these for them!  For the chocolate shavings, I used Ghirardelli dark chocolate with ground espresso beans, and it was great.

My bf is a tiramisu nut..  so when he started buying whole cakes from restaurants at $50 a pop, I needed an alternative.  He LOVES this recipe.  It does taste just like the restaurant version.  I was very impressed, and this was the first dessert I ever tried to make from scratch.  I am so proud of myself!  I screwed up the ladyfingers a little and they were runny, but I baked them in mini cupcake pans and they came out perfect :)

Yum.  It was a big hit during Christmas dinner.  Used a 9-inch spring form pan and it came out beautifully.  Even though the ingredients were rich, the dessert was surprising light.  Used strong coffee to brush the lady fingers and didn't bother spliting them in half.

I made this for a potluck at a family members, and we all thought that it was a little bland.  next time I will add rum in as well as coffee liquer to the cheese mix as well....proably a 1/4C should do it.  otherwise the presentation was awesome

Good but a little on the sweet side for me.  I would use less sugar next time.  This is very rich - not something I would make often...a special treat!

I used Kahlùa in this recipe-quickly dipped the ladyfingers in a bowl of it, rather than brushing it on.

Let me tell you--I made about 50 servings of the tiramisu for a special dinner at my co-op and not one drop was left.  I received a standing ovation as the best dish of the night--and there were some amazing dishes!!  Talk about a crowd pleaser.  One man said to me that he HATED tiramisu but this one was amazing.

Give it a go--it's pretty fun to make.  Put on some italian music in the background while you're at it.  Enjoy.  I did.

I personally like my desserts not too sweet and find this recipe way too sweet for me.  I also made a mistake by using Trader Joe's ladyfingers which has tons of sugar in them.  If I make this again, I will definitely reduce sugar to 1/2 cup and use regular grocery store lady fingers.

This is an okay dessert, but not a true tiramisu, which requires that you make a zabaglione. If you want to make tiramisu much easier, this is a nice option. However, I think it is worth the extra time to make it the more traditional way.

I made this recipe twice. The first time I tried to make my own ladyfingers which was a mistake. Buy them, they are better and so much easier, Trader Joe's has them. 
I couldn't beleive how delicious this was! I made it in the springform pan, then dusted with powdered sugar, and shaved chocolate on a nice platter. Fabulous, better than any restaurant tiramisu I have ever had. I also made a raspberry puree from frozen raspberries and sugar in a blender, throwing in some of the mascarpone mixture. I then piped some of it on the serving plates in squiggles. It was so gorgeous and so delicious it was almost intimidating! It made me want to run around outside and scream. Follow the directions!

What a great recipe - not for dieters, though!  I dipper the ladyfingers in cooled, fresh-brewed espresso before laying them down which, as one of my guests noted, gave it more of a coffee-flavour than other tiramisus (tiramisi?)...  Also, I added a dash of vanilla to the cheese mixture.  I made this just before Valentine's Day, so before sprinkling the cocoa over the top, I cut out a few paper hearts and placed them down on top.  Then, after sprinkling, I removed the hearts, which left a festive pattern.

The only thing different I would do, is to soak the lady fingers in either coffee or Kalahua, instead of just brushing it over them...

In response to PINKITTY: 

You can omit the alcohol if you want, just dip it in plain coffee instead.  I'm referring to Italian coffee, so the American equivalent would be espressso.  Also, you can use a mixture of rum (or coffee liqueur) and espresso, that way, you can control how much alcohol you want in it.

i made this recipe 4 times, each time the taste was fabulous. everyone wanted the recipe! i made mini cups and i added lots more coffee liquer cuz i like mine strong ... someone actually called it evil and ate 3 whole cups! only 1 mistake i made during the last one. instead of using normal size eggs, i used jumbo size eggs, and everything became too runny, unlike my previous attempts. so bigger isn't better!

Made this for a special New Year's Eve dinner.  It was easy to make and delicious!  I scaled it down to 4 servings and it still came out fine.  That amount actually would've been good for 6 people, I think.  Brushing with coffee liquer didn't seem to soak in enough, so I poured the liquer in so it would soak up better.  Thanks for sharing!

The recipe was great. I made it for the first time Sunday to bring to my friends dinner party. The guests loved it. I think it is great that you cook the egg and sugar combo for ten minutes. It made me less worried about salmonella (sp?). I made one small modification... I added a shot of expresso to the Kaluah.  I also made it in a spring form pan which made the dessert look store bought. Again I received a lot of compliments. Overall this reciepe was a HUGE HIT! Thanks for sharing I am going to make it again for the holidays.

This is an excellent recipe. It tastes genuine, and I'm so happy that the custard is cooked first. With previous recipes that have called for uncooked yolks, I always felt like I was playing Russian roulette, salmonella-style!  This tiramisu tastes even better after allowing it to sit in the fridge for a day or two.  I used about 1/2 cup of coffee liqueur, and I made the lady fingers from scratch, which I think definitely added to the recipe. You can make ladyfingers from a biscuit a la cuilliere recipe, and it will only add about 1/2 hour to your prep time.

This was very good and well worth the effort!  I made this for a family who had a new baby.  They loved it.  When I made it, there was actually enough extra to make a couple of servings for my husband and me!  It was very rich and creamy.

I thought the taste was amazing, but when I went to serve it, all the creamy part sort of melted and it didn't hold together! Does anyone have any suggestions? Maybe I didn't use enough lady fingers? I am certainly going to try this one again though, everyone LOVED it, even though it looked like slop :)

I made this recipe and it was wonderful!  It takes a little time to make some of the ingredients, but that is what makes it better than other recipes I have tried.  I made mine in a springform pan and it looks gorgeous when it is taken out.

Excellent recipe.  I made this dessert in a spring-form pan the night before and it was the hit of a dinner party.  I actually put birthday candles on the to and used it as a birthday cake.  I used the soft sponge-like lady fingers which I found in the freezer section of my grocery store.  I also combined the coffee liquor with espresso and brushed this on very generously.  Definitely a "keeper".

i've made this twice and received many compliments both times. i don't know if anyone else had this problem, but when heating the yolks and sugar, some bits coagulated. i thought they would break apart when you blend it but they don't. so the second time i strained the mixture before i whipped it, and it turned out great. also, i made one using ladyfingers and one using poundcake, and i don't like poundcake as a substitute. next time i might try using those dessert shells they sell in a pkg of 6...the spongecake kind that you can scoop icecream on top of. i also added some kahlua to the whipping cream, next time i might add a lil expresso to that too.

Fantastic recipe.  Tasted like it came from a restaurant. I used a pastry brush to apply the espresso and it didn't soak the ladyfingers enough.  Next time I will dip the ladyfingers into the espresso.

This was better than most restaurant tiramisus.  

If you choose to add vanilla to the cream/cheese mixture, don't over do it.  Part of the allure of this dessert is the subtly of the flavor.  Too much vanilla makes it taste like cake frosting.

Make sure that you use soft lady fingers and not the hard ones.  (Your grocery store probably sells them.  You might have to ask.  It took me a while to find them.  They're usually in 3 oz packages with 12 fingers per package.)

Don't oversoak the lady fingers.  A pastry brush really works best.  The lady fingers should be slightly damp, not soaked through.

When whipping the cream, it might be helpful to do it in a metal mixing bowl sitting in ice.  The cold really helps.

The flavor really develops over time.  You definitely want to let it sit in the fridge at least overnight.

Sometimes, it's a lot easier just to substitute. Tiramisu creators have used ricotta or cottage cheese as successful substitutes by whipping the cheese until it is smooth.

This recipe was very easy to make! 

Next time I will use a little bit more liqueur and coffee to give the desert, a more distinctive Tiramisu flavor. I brushed the liqueur and coffee on the lady fingers. 

Folding the whip cream into the yolk mixture very gentle is the key part!

This was not too difficult, and turned out nice for my first attempt at Tiramisu. I halfed the recipe, and next time would lessen the sugar and add more coffee flavor by using strong coffee in addition to the kahlua (the coffee flavor wasn't strong enough). 
Overall, my finace really enjoyed it as a special Valentine's Day treat!

I made this for a special dinner  and every one loved it and the leftovers are great too..I use alot more liquer and added exprsso too--I think I soaked the bottom layer of ladyfingers a little too much so I would let my lady fingers get harder at room temp for a day, but other wise wouldn't change anything.

I have been using this recipe for two years now.  Most restaurants do not come close to over ranking this wonderful dessert.  I have had to find a recipe for the lady fingers since the stores near me don't sell them wo a cream filling.  Best Tiramisu me  my family have ever had.

This recipe was absolutely delicious and tasted better if not just as good as the ones at the restaurants.  I thought it was too sweet, so I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups the second time I made it and it was perfect.  Also, be sure to follow the recipe in brushing the liqueur over the ladyfingers instead of dipping or it will get too soggy.

It tasted great, but like the other reviews, it was too runny.  It was still not as firm as I'd like after being in the fridge and was messy to eat.

I had never had this before, but always wanted to try.  It was very good and different. I will make it again.  I couldn't find the ladyfingers at my store so I made my own.  There is a recipe off of here I used.  It's Ladyfingers by Roxanne and it was good and easy.

This recipe is excellent and is a Perfect 10!  The taste and texture is incredible. Also on the plus side is the fact that the eggs are cooked, which is not common in many Tiramisu recipes. Whenever I make this dessert, it goes extremely quick. On several occasions, I have been told it is THE BEST Tiramisu ever!  Thanks for sharing Carol!

For the liqueur substitute, I used a creamy Capichino flavoured brandy liqueur.
This was such as success that I have been told that this is the best Tiramisu that they have ever tasted.

Most defintley worth it.

This was a wonderul recipe.  I didn't have the coffee liquer, so I used instant coffee and imitation brandy to dip the ladyfingers in. I am a big tiramisu fan - and this was my first attempt.  I was very pleased and will definitely make it again!  It wasn't hard - just very involved.  Takes time.  It's best to let it mellow for a while too.  It's even better the next day!

My girlfriend made this recipe because she likes tiramisu.  It's not one of my favorites, but this recipe won me over.  I normally don't like the coffee flavor, but the flavor wasn't as strong in this recipe as it is in many others.  It was sinfully good and a big hit with the friends that we had over too.

It was simply fabulous- I also found I didnt have to use all the biscuits quoted in the recipe, so nexttime I will buy fewer biscuits.
My husband who is a BIG tiramisu fan LOVED it! He said it turned out much better than those in restaurants. Thank you

As close to Olive Garden's tiramisu as you can make!  I used the soft lady fingers and did only one layer; I used individual ramekins, and two layers seemed like too much "cake" and not enough custard.  Very good recipe that I will certainly make again!

Carol,

Thanks for the great recipe!  At first I was discouraged at the grocery store seeking the ingredients.  I couldn't lady fingers so I used poundcake instead.  It still got rave reviews!  I would soak the cake instead of just brushing it though.  I will definately make it again.

Wow! Considering that I was working out of my pantry and with my favorite flavors I had to change many of the ingredients it STILL turned out awesome!  (hazelnut liquor mixed with Coffee Liquor, Entemann's lite Pound Cake, Lite Cool Whip etc etc....)  Not exactly "classic" but awesome anyways!  My previous attempt at making Tiramisu was soupy/soggy and nasty.... Thanks Carol!

I'm going to add to the list of wonderful reviews for this recipe.  I had tiramisu once at a restaurant and really liked it (which is rare for me since I usually can't tolerate custards).  Since that time I'd been looking for an easy recipe with gourmet flavor.  I've found it!  I made it Saturday for myself, it is Wednesday and it is all gone.  I think the next time I will dip the ladyfingers.  I am making it for my family on the coming holiday and we LOVE sweets, so I think I will dip the coated fingers in sugar (maybe a sugar/cinnamon mixture) before lining.  Also, I think I will add vanilla flavor to the cheese/cream.  I didn't miss it in this recipe but I am of the firm believe that any dessert is better with vanilla.  Good job!

This was fantastic! It was exactly what I was looking for.  I couldn't find coffee liquor so I used espresso.  Also, my stove wasn't working so I combined the egg yolks and sugar and microwaved for 4-5 min., stirring every 30 sec. or so.  And it still turned out great!  Very hard recipe to mess up!

Thank you for this recipie.  This was my second attempt at making tiramisu (this first time was awful!) and thanks to you it was a huge hit at my in-laws 30th anniversary party.  SO easy.  I also made it in a springform pan and left out the alcohol and used strong cold coffee.  Appreciated the fact that the eggs were cooked.  Thanks again.

This is a great recipe, and although it is a little time consuming putting it all together it really is very simple to do. I ended up soaking the ladyfingers in the Kahlua instead of brushing them. The only problem is that I dipped the whole ladyfinger in the Kahlua and it ended up being too much of a strong Kahlua taste. I would recommend quickly dipping one side of the ladyfinger for the best results. I also put a couple of pinches of cinnamon across the top along with the dusting of cocoa powder and shaved chocolate. I also whipped up the remaining heavy whipping cream with some confectioners sugar and vanilla and put a dollop of that on the top. YUMMY.

This was fabulous! So velvety rich and creamy, with deliciously soaked ladyfingers. Yum! Another plus - it is not difficult to prepare!!

The first time my boyfriend and I had tiramisu was in Paris this past December and we fell in love with it!!  For Valentine's Day, I dectided to attempt to make it for him and he says it is the best he's ever had, even better than the restaurant in Paris!!  I was very impressed with how easy and how well it turned out.  I can't wait to make it for my girlfriends now!

This was absolutely awesome! It tasted just like it does in the nice Italian restaurants. I was a little unsure of it since I am used to cake and not ladyfingers. But it really was delicious. I have a friend who is 100% Italian and she told me it was the BEST she had ever had. So that's really saying something. I gave the "Kid friendly rating" only one star because of the coffee liqueur that is used. I don't allow children to eat it.  But this recipe is two thumbs up all the way!

This recipe worked out really well for 10 people. I preferred this recipe over other tiramisu recipes because this one requires you to cook the eggs (some recipes call for raw eggs). I used a springform pan and lined the sides with upright ladyfingers. The downside to this is that the Kahlua runs down to the bottom, so the sides aren't really soaked well (next time, when serving, I'll spoon additional Kahlua over the dry parts). However, the presentation was very impressive. I prepared this a day ahead of time so that the cake would hold itself together when served. This recipe was a hit.

A wonderful recipe! Much easier than I expected. It also gave me a reason to buy a double boiler ..... I had never invested in one before. So now I not only have a great recipe, but my kitchen is also more complete. Make this yummy treat for someone you love!

What a wonderful tiramisu!  Everyone I've made this for raves about it, with the exception of my kid who doesn't like coffee flavored anything.  I use a clear glass salad bowl to make it, which works just fine.  This is our new, favorite dessert, always requested.

I wish you would have explained how to dish this up without making it look like a big heap of cream.  It was so messy to dish onto the plate.  Presentation seemed impossible.  It did taste great though.

I saturate the lady fingers in espresso before lining the pan. I add amoretta to the mixture.
It is very delicious this way!

The best tiramisu recipe I've tried.  Refrigerating overnight gives better results.  I soaked each ladyfinger with 1/2 tablespoon of unsweetened coffee along with Kahlua.  If you prefer soggier ladyfingers you might want to give that a try.

I had trouble finding ladyfingers in the store so I made my own with another recipe from cookierecipe.com.  I made some shaped tradionally but then made a sheet of ladyfingers that I could cut in circles for the middle layer. I also substituted cognac for the coffee liquor which is more traditional.

I made this for xmas dinner 2019 and it was amazing! very easy to make if you follow instructions, watching the video was a great help as well. A helpful note for others, if you like it boozy, then buy a bottle of kahlua and use that to soak your lady fingers in. This was a delightful hit with everyone!

I made this for New Year's Eve and it was a great success.  The sweetness level was just right.  I made it in a truffle bowl for the biggest wow factor although it would be easier to serve in a cake pan.  I cooked the eggs and sugar in the microwave.  You need to stir it down often, but works fine.   This recipe is a winner!

I used less ladyfingers because of the serving dish I used.  I also used about 2/3 cups of strong coffee instead of the coffee liqueur (because I didn't want to buy a whole bottle for 1/3 of a cup), and it still came out amazing.  I made this for dessert on Christmas and received tons of compliments.

I have been making this recipe for years but never wrote a review.  This is by far the best Tiramisu recipe I have ever made. My family and friends always ask for it at Christmas and Easter. I have made it with Amaretto and Amaretti cookies instead of lady fingers.  Always, always a hit.  Thank you for sharing Carol.

I am on a quest to make the best tiramisu.  This is the best I have made so far.  Nice flavors.  Easy to make.  
Definitely will try again with these adjustments:  
use 1 cup sugar.
Use 2 cups whipping cream and full container of mascapone (454g)  cheese, cos what am I going to do with leftovers.
 I used a 98x13 pyrex dish so the extra mixture will be fine

I make this every Christmas and it is delicious.  This is by far the best and easiest recipe for tiramisu.

Love this recipe! It took me a few times making the recipe to get it down, but now I can assemble this in 30 minutes.   This is always a hit when I make it - and this is my go to recipe for tiramisu.

I used crisp last fingers instead of the soft cake variety. It made for a better dessert, they hold up better.

After making this I am rated "best ever tiramisu maker" and "tiramisu from the finest restaurants cannot compare to this" as  quoted by my family. Takes long to make but so worth it! I've make it every holiday season. I use a blend of espresso coffee, light rum, and Kahlua to drench the lady fingers. I omit the chocolate shavings just because they are a pain, and not needed.

Absolutely delicious. I made a full batch for six people and we finished the entire thing in ten minutes - next time I'll do a double batch because I want leftovers. I substituted the mascarpone for cream cheese as some other reviewers did since my grocery store doesn't carry it.

I found it had excess cream, so i made it with 4 egg yolks and reduced everything else in proportion. Worked out perfect!

This is wonderful and easy to make.  Husband loved it.  Made exactly as written but added some vanilla extract to the whipping cream. This would be a hit anywhere.  I took other viewers advice and made it 2 days ahead of time.  It is nice and light but not low in calories.  Great to take to a party or special occasion.

The only change I made was to make it into a Yule Log for xmas.  And, of course I used a chocolate butter cream to decorate.  It was fantastic and I am making it again for New Years as a roll.

Made it my first time for family Thanksgiving dinner and it went over extremely well with everyone, even the kids!  I used espresso instead of liquer. 
On thing I wondered about, my filling was about the consistency of ice cream once it set. Is it supposed to be that thick  or did I do something wrong? 
Didn't affect the taste any but I would like to know since it was my first experience making tiramisu.
I will be making it again... a lot!!

D.E.L.I.C.I.O.U.S. ! Followed the recipe exactly . I did allow the egg/marscapone to cool before folding in the whipped cream. Will be making this again and again.

This was my first time making this dessert, and I couldn't find ladyfingers so I used Stella D'Oro Italian anisette cookies soaked in coffee liqueur and they weren't as soft as I would have preferred. I also couldn't find mascarpone cheese so I used a recipe of cream cheese, heavy cream and sour cream to substitute. So it was good but not the best tiramisu I've ever had in a restaurant.

Family loved this dish even the ones who were not big tiramisu fans.  I put piroettes around the edge of a spring-form pan, then did layers.  End result was beautiful.

LOVED IT- I made this as a dessert contribution to a family dinner when we had a lot of family come in from out of town. It was a major hit! I made it again for pot luck at work and it was the only dessert that was gone. This is a keeper!

1st time made according to recipe
Too sweet
Not enough coffee flavor
Great consistency

2nd time
Reduced sugar to 1/3 cup
Added 1tsp coffee liquer (Bailey's) and 1tsp vanilla extract to marscapone mixture
Dipped savoiardi ladyfingers in combination of Bailey's and strong coffee
Perfect!!!

The quality of your liquer and coffee is crucial to overall flavor.  If you don't want to drink it, do not add it to your tiramisu!

Marscapone is high in fat and will separate as it gets warm.  Let egg yolk mixture cool completely before adding refrigerated marscapone.

I use the hard imported lady fingers and I use about a cup of very strong coffee and Kahlua mixed together to dip them in. Be generous when dipping.  Then the Tiramisu must sit in the 'fridge overnight at the bare minimum.  The egg is the hardest part, you are actually making Sabayone.  Whisk constantly while cooking and don't let the mixture get too hot.  Excellent recipe.

I was in Florence this past summer and had the most amazing tiramisu. I promptly begin looking for a matching recipe and found this one. It's not traditional with beautiful square lines (or maybe I just make it differently...) but it's perfect and reminds me of Florence!

I made this twice in one week that's how big of a hit it was. like others I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cups. but i added 3 layers to the cake so i increased the whip cream amount to 2 cups. it made it more cake like and small portions were enough for each person. but overall people wouldn't stop raving on about it and begged me to make it again for another dinner party.

Yummy! Very easy to make - I used an 8oz pkg of marscarpone b/c it was not cheap but I may break into the second package next time as the tiramisu didn't get very firm. I saw a few other comments on it not firming up but never saw any suggestions as to how to fix it?

Rave reviews at a potluck. I made it in my trifle bowl and needed a double recipe to fill it. Next time I will add the kalua in to strong instant coffee ( didn't have any instant coffee this time) I too made it 2 days ahead. I have had a request to make it again for a gathering this weekend.

This is very good and very easy.  I'd venture that it is a bit cloyingly sweet, and I only used 1 cup of sugar in the recipe.  My biggest complaint is that it lacks that espresso flavour so desirable in a genuine tiramisu, and so I would suggest incorporating an unsweetened coffee or cafe mocha swirl into the mascarpone/whipped cream mixture (fold it in so it makes the swirl effect, rather than blending completely).

This recipe was AMAZING. I had never made Tiramisu before and it turned out great. In fact, I made it only because my brother brought back wine from italy so i was making an italian dinner and didn't even really like tiramisu. BUT NOW I am stuck on it. It was perfect and a total hit!!! Definatly make this

Very good recipe and much easier than I anticipated.  Next time, I would use less ladyfingers and slightly more Kahlua.

This is the only Tiramisu recipe I use. It is the best. It's very close to the recipe printed on the package of Lady Fingers that I use, but this one is still better! Thanks!

I have to agree with my fellow italian cooks, this is NOT a classic recipe and cooking the yolks is disturbing to me. the real Italian tiramisu' has raw eggs, no cream but only mascarpone and egg whites and absolutely no liquor. It may taste super delicious but , again, there is nothing italian in this recipe.

This was a great dessert! rave reviews all around. Made it with very very thick espresso, no alcohol and added grated semisweet and white chocolate layers. It sat in the fridge for about 12 hours. Absolutely gorgeous to see and taste. I would reduce the sugar a bit next time though. Thanks for all your reviews. they helped a lot. Already have requests for Thanksgiving!

Great recipe!  It is identical to the recipe on the package of soft lady fingers.  Those packages are actually 3oz not 12oz.  I halved the recipe, but still used the recommended amount of coffee liquer. I don't drink alcohol, so I mixed 1/3 C very hot water with 2 tsp instant coffee granules and 1 tsp vanilla.  I arranged the lady fingers in the dish, and brushed the coffee mixture on with a pastry brush.  They soaked up just the right amount of liquid while still retaining their shape.  The tiramisu definitely tastes better the next day.  Try to wait if you can :)

I used this recipe to make my first tiramisu cake. And it turned out great! I didn't soak the ladyfingers with just coffee liquir, I mixed it with brewed coffee so it would have a stronger coffee smell. I made it twice so far, and it disappears very quickly!

I made this for my husband yesterday and he loved it! Sadly, I can't eat eggs so I didn't get to try it myself, but he can't quit singing its praises.  I followed the recipe *almost* exactly. The only difference was the ladyfingers. The recipe called for 2 (12) ounce packs, but the ones I found in the store were in 3 ounce packs. They were the soft type, so I don't know if that makes a difference or not. I used a total of 6 ounces of them and used a spray bottle to spritz on the Kahlua.

This was my first time making tiramisu as its one of my favourite desserts. It was full off flavour (added one of the small shot bottles of Kahula to coffee) and I left it overnight before serving at a potluck. However, my only complain was it didn't firm up very nicely and was somewhat of a mess serving.

Awesome recipe! I did not make any changes and it turned out fabulous! I think the key to getting a great tasting tiramisu is the type of whipped cream that is being used. Dairy (milk) base whipped cream tastes so much better then the non-dairy one, it really does make a big difference. Try this recipe! It's easy, it's pretty quick to make and it is bound to impress!

I did not care for this recipe. I should have known that it was too much sugar to begin with.  I'm a pastry chef...I wish I hadn't attempted it...but alas, I did.  Had to reduce the sugar by a lot.  In a pinch, this is not a great recipe.

I thought the flavor was great, but it never stiffened up for me once I added the egg mixture to the cream. The cream stiffened, but I couldn't seem to get that texture back once I mixed the two together. However, A+ on the flavor of the mousse part!

My boss is a BIG fan of Tiramisu and for his birthday I surprised him and he LOVED it! I didn't use the marscaponi cheese, but did the substitute recipe and nobody knew the difference - I didn't tell either!  Thanks for a well liked, not overpowering, flavorful dessert that a guaranty to impress any guest!

Loved this recipe. I made it for X-mas eve dinner. I ran out of coffee liquer so I used a chocolate flavored one and it was so good! I will look forward to making it again and again and again...

Terrific! I made this in a 9"x12" pan and 9 oz of ladyfingers was plenty. I'd also add a little coffee/expresso to moisten the ladyfingers more next time.

Super good! Time consuming but not too difficult. Used a springform pan. Required way less ladyfingers than the recipe called for.

Delicious!  I used a 13x9 pyrex casserole dish and substituted the mascarpone cheese with the 1 pound cream cheese, 1/4 c sour cream & 1/4 c whipping cream suggested by some other reviewers.  Also, I didn't use any alcohol, just espresso, so I want to try it next time! Definitely let the tiramisu sit in the fridge for at least a day, if not more.  The flavors start to really soak in, and the lady fingers also soften up.

Look no further. This is THE Tiramisu recipe to use!  Tastes just like the deliciousness you get at authentic Italian restaurants.  I used a 13"x9" glass pan and it worked  perfectly.  The lady fingers I found were in the bakery department of the grocery store (I had to ask for them).  Get the marscapone at Trader Joes--much cheaper!  I also used the whole container of whipping cream (2 cups).  For a desert with 'difficult-to-make' reputation this really was rather easy to prepare.  You will surely keep it in your recipe box and use it for special occasions.  Thanks for the recipe!!

This recipe was surprisingly very easy to make. I was a little hesitant because I have tried to make tiramisu once before and it turned out horrible. I did reduce the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was just right. I also could not buy coffee liqueur because I was making it on Sunday and my city does not allow alcohol sales on Sundays. Anyway, I used instant coffee. I let it set in the refrigerator for a little more than 24 hours and the only thing I would change is the amount of coffee I used. The lady fingers were a little soggy. I made this for my 1st anniversary and my huband loved it! This is definitely a keeper!!

I made this for my husband on his birthday because it's his favorite dessert.  I've never made it before, nor have I ever really enjoyed a Tiramisu.

My husband, our friends, and I really enjoyed this recipe!  The ONLY thing, my husband said, that would make this better, is soaking the lady fingers with more of the liqueor.

YUM!

Quick and easy, such an added benefit that the eggs in this recipe are cooked.  The one item I chose to change was to use espresso rather than coffee liquer to be more true to the tiramisu flavor and to avoid adding alcohol to the dessert.  Looks beautiful with the coloring from the espresso in the cream as well.

Everyone seemed to really like this and it was very easy to make.  I made several modifications; mascarpone cheese was no where to be found so I used 1 pound cream cheese, 1/4 c sour cream & 1/4 c whipping cream.  Also, I used a frozen pound cake for the layers and then 1 package of lady fingers stood up on the outside in a spring form pan.  It was very fancy looking!  Also, I used strong coffee with  a few teaspoons of Tia Maria.  It stayed in the fridge until it was served the following afternoon.

I made this for my fiance's birthday last fall and it was a hit!!  I also made my own Ladyfingers (courtesy of Roxanne on this site).  I agree, it tastes even better the next day - but who wants to wait???  I am going to make it again tonight with the leftover 6 egg yolks from the "Olive Oil Bundt Cake."  Thanks Carol!

Definately a wondeful recipe. I made this for my anniversary and it will now be a new tradition! I love the fact that the eggs are cooked and the tip to make sure you get the soft Lady fingers is a must. If you can't find them on the cookie aisle check in the bakery section of your grocery store.

This was great! Not overly sweet-just right. I only needed 1 3oz package of lady fingers for a 8" spring form pan and needed to add more liquid to the liqueur, so I added 1/3 cup strong coffee. It did take alittle longer for the sugar to melt into the yokes-I just keep whipping.

I think this recipe was missing something. Tasted like tiramisu but maybe it was me making it in a truffle bowl and it should be made in spring form pan.

Easy to prepare, great tasting recipe!  I didn't look very hard for ladyfingers, next time I definately will.  I used "Nilla" wafers and they were ok, but they required alot of soaking.  I used "starbucks" coffee liquer...gave it a great taste!  I wouldn't change anything to this recipe..it is bang on..a hit with everyone in the family ;-)

I made this recipe for my husband's birthday and it was the best tiramisu we have ever had. It was fantastic. I opted for the springform pan and didn't line the edges with ladyfingers. The key to success is to purchase soft ladyfingers. I also sifted my cocoa on the top and used more to cover the entire top of the tiramisu.

This was pretty good. I made it for Thanksgiving. The only problem I had was that the sugar crystalized in some parts of the custard and made it unbearably sweet in spots. I loved that I could make it two days in advance.

Pretty good, but after adding a lot less sugar, i thought it was too sweet yet. Until the last minute i didn't realize i had no coffee liqueur at home, so i brushed my ladyfingers with a mixture of black coffee, unsweetened cocoa powder and amaretto. My mom raved about it!!

Very tasty. I have never tried Tiramisu before. My husband has been to Italy & ask me to look up a recipe for it, he said this was very close, but very good. I found it good as well. Will make again. Thanks.

This recipe turned out well. It was a gret hit with people from work who have had Tiramisu in the past. As I have never had nor made Tiramisu before, this was an excellent recipe and will continue to use it.

This was so awesome!!  I've never made Tiramisu before and was a little nervous, but it turned out to be fantastic!  The one thing I added was vanilla extract to the cream.  Other than that, I followed it to the letter.  If you're thinking about making this, don't think anymore - just do it!  It's fabulous.  It's virtually impossible to mess up.  I just had it with my husband this time, but I would definitely feel comfortable serving it to company, too.  A keeper!

This was an easy, outstanding recipe!  It was my first attempt at Tiramisu and it was a hit at a party that I served it at.  I was in a hurry, so I used a pretty flat-bottomed oval serving dish to make it in and serve it in.  It looked beautiful and served up very nicely.

I too had difficulty finding soft ladyfingers.  Trader Joes has them, but they are a seasonal item.  I finally found them at Wegmans, but in the bakery NOT in the cookie section.  Despite the problems locating them it was so worth it.  I also didn't need 24 ounces of ladyfingers as the recipe calls for; my trifle bowl only needed around 9 ounces.  I dipped them in, NOT soaking or brushing on, the Kahlua.  Definitely not a recipe that you can substitute or skimp on ingredients and expect to get the best result.  I used exactly what was called for and it turned out excellent!  Many compliments and recipe requests!

YUM, this tiramisu was out of this world. It was even better on day two, after the flavors melded. Definitely a keeper!  I made my own lady fingers, but that's probably not neccesary.

This recipe is so easy to make and was received better then anything I ever baked (not that this cake is baked).  It's amazing the feedback I am getting and folks that want to order it.
Lady fingers were a bit a hassle to find, but Nob Hill Foods had them.

I made this dessert for a dinner party I had. It was amazing. My husband has been eating the leftovers  for a couple of days. It is great with Kaluha. You need to make sure to use the mascarpone cheese. I will make this again.

Delicious, easy and really, really rich!  Makes a huge dessert though, I had to divide it into two bowls. All the more for me when the guests left!

Nothing to change with this recipe. I would keep the sugar content as stated. I made it in a glass bowl and not only did it look beautiful, it tasted delicious.

I had some trouble with the recipe, in that I couldn't seem to fit the amount of ladyfingers in. I ended up using less than half what the recipe called for. And the whole thing looked a little funny and lumpy. But... it still tasted incredible. I followed the recipe exactly (not counting the ladyfingers), except I skipped the cocoa powder since the chocolate shavings seemed to cover he whole thing adequately.

This recipe is great if you follow it exactly and don't try any substitutions.  I did shave some extra chocolate on top and added a tiny bit of an extra splash of the coffee flavored liqueur.

Great recipe!  I made it for a party I was hosting, and everyone loved it.  I used the hard ladyfingers, in the cookie aisle.  The brand I used was called Alessi.  I made 15 single servings, using custard cups, and put the cups on doily lined bread and butter plates.  I dusted the tops with cocoa and shavings off a Hershey bar.  I didn't measure the amt of Kahlua that I used, but it was a lot more than the recipe called for.  I dipped the ladyfingers in it instead of brushing it on.

I would consider myself a 'novice' baker and I had no trouble putting this together. I did notice that the sugar wasn't completely dissolved after the cooking time so I just kept at it with a whisk after adding the cheese until all the sugar was dissolved. 

I followed the recipe exactly except that I shaved some mint-chocolate on the top since that's what I had. I made it in an 8" springform pan and it made "a bit too much" for 11 people, though it was completely gone when the night was over. 

Excellent recipe. Somewhat expensive when you consider a bottle of Kahlua and the cheese, but certainly worth it as a once-in-a-while treat. Everyone loved it.

I've made this twice and we love it. If little ones are eating this you can use espresso instead of Kahlua and it's just as good.

Thank you for this super recipe. I made this  for the first time & I "experimented" with it by dipping the lady fingers on coffee with amaretto. This turned out to be superb!!! I'll be making this for my mother-in-law, I'm confident but wish me luck!! (*wink)

the flavor was really good, but the consistancy...SO heavy and overly rich.  I will try and find something lighter and a little less overwhelming.

Great recipe.  I did tweek it a bit and used brandy and coffee for a different flavor. My husband loved it.  It was very good and  I usually don't like Tiramisu.  I also used a springform pan as others suggested and it was very pretty.  Thanks for the great dessert.  I will be making it again for sure.

I have made this recipe many times, and I've always altered something about it.  I dont always have the same alcohol on hand, and I dont always have coffee liquer, so I make my own combinations using straight liquor and coffee or espresso.

I must have done something really wrong because mine was incredibly chunky, gritty(the sugar never properly got absorbed by the eggs) and milky as the same time. I've made delicious tiramisu lots of times from a different recipe and will go back to that.

This recipe was very delicious.  Definitely make it with less sugar.  Marscapone cheese is very expensive to buy, but worth it for the taste.  An option for those on a budget is to make it with half marscapone and half regular cream cheese.  It tastes very good that way too. Very tasty!

I made this recipe last week for a dinner party, and it was such a hit, everyone loved it so much that I decided to make it yesterday for Easter.  Once again, my family couldn't get enough of it, and it was SOOO easy to make!  I didn't have any coffee liqueur, so I just used strong coffee, and I dipped the ladyfingers in quickly, instead of brushing them on.  I also added a touch of vanilla to the homemade whipped cream.   Thanks for the tip about the ladyfingers at Trader Joes, I can't find them any place else!  This recipe is DEFINITELY a keeper!

This was perfect. I didn't have any on hand, so I made ladyfingers using a recipe from this site. I also don't like a really strong alcohol taste in my food, so I mixed about 1T of Kahlua and about 1/3c of coffee and used that instead of the liqueur. Finally, since I had so many ladyfingers and couldn't think of anything else to use them in, I layered the mascarpone and ladyfingers several times, which came out delicious. This tastes good as soon as you put it together, and gets better (if you can keep any around) the next day.

I bought ladyfingers from the bakery in a large grocery store, and was confused by the ounces listed to buy. The packages I bought were 3 or 4 ounces each, so I bought 4 just to be safe. 2 of those packages worked out perfectly in a 10" springform pan. Otherwise it was a wonderful and authentic recipe, as said by all the other reviews.

The cream was wonderful.  My friends, who all thought tiramisu was okay because they'd only had it in restaurants, devoured this--this was amazing!  I used a mixture of espresso and kahlua, and I used homemade ladyfingers.  I also used the mascarpone substitute that I found on this site.

Fantastic recipe... I also added a double shot of espresso to the Kahlua for flavor and an extra 1/4 cup of heavy cream for more fluffiness... Truly impressive and will definitely make again and again!

Add me to the long list of fans, this is yet another Easy, Quick, and Fabulous recipe!
My husband works at a bank, we made it for a potluck. By noon the tellers were drunk (kidding) and the bowl was licked clean. He's now required to bring to every work potluck, and the good news is he can make it himself.

Other than the stirring for 10 minutes this is a great recipe. I substitute espresso coffee in stead of the liquer and pound cake for ease. I have made it 3or4 times now and always get rave reviews from my guests! I sometimes add a few chocolate chips to the top for decoration. thanks for a great dessert!

this isn't a review, but i'm looking forward to trying this. when you split the ladyfingers, are you slicing them into thinner layers? and if you don't want to use alcohol, what do you use for soaking them?

This recipe is "the bomb" as the kids say.  The only problem was I couln't find "lady fingers".  I went to three different grocers and was finally told it was a seasonal item.  I used a double layer yellow cake instead.  It was a hit at my office.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Thank you Carol, for this recipe.  I have made this about 6 times now and the only thing I change is that I add about a 1/4 cup strong brewed espresso to the liqueur.  Everyone loves this one.  The flavour really comes out the next day but around here it never lasts that long!

This recipe lived up to all the previous reviews.  I did have to substitute with cream cheese but the bowl was indeed scraped clean!  Served this at a birthday dinner and everyone requested it for their own upcoming birthdays!

I followed this recipe to the letter the 1st time and the taste in general was great however the lady fingers were too dry prepared this way and detracted from the great taste combination of the other ingredients. 2nd time used slices of plain white cake and strong coffee & it was perfect.

Excellent recipe, very easy (once I found the marscapone cheese that is!).  I substituted the liquor with strong coffe and used a trifle bowl.  It was a beautiful presentation with delicious results!

Excellent simple recipe ! Made with light cream cheese. Everyone had second helpings.  Added sliced strawberries on top for a fresh twist.  Will find an excuse to make it again.

I used espresso with a bit of rum added rather than the coffee liqueur. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert and I didn't believe I'd find a recipe that is as good as what I've had at a few restaurants, but this is really wonderful!

Fabulous recipe! I will make this many more times. Rave reviews at a cocktail party served elegantly in a trifle dish. Next time I will only brush the cookies with the kahlua.

Fabulously rich and tasty!  Great for impressing guests!  Ended up with way too much mascarpone mix, though.

A Great recipe for tiramisu lovers. I suggest using coffee liquer rather than coffee. It does make a difference.
