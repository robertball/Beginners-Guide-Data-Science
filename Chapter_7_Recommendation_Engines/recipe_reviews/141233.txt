This meatloaf has lots of flavor. I only gave it 4 stars because the baking time wasn't long enough. There was still a fair amount of pink in the meat after baking. I omitted the dry mustard-I'm not a mustard fan-and substituted the quick oats for an equal amount of cornbread stuffing. My husband isn't a big meatloaf fan, but he LOVED this recipe! My advice, bake about 15 minutes longer before you put the ketchup on-and make extra ketchup mix so you can have more to put on top!

I made this for dinner tonight, and what a hit it was.  I used one of the recommendations, and did 1/2 of the oats and then 1/2 of chicken stuffing.  It was perfect.  Very moist, held together well when taking it out of the pan and when slicing.  I think that this will be our family's new meatloaf recipe.  Thanks for sharing it with us!

The combo of meats was super tasty!  I used dry stuffing instead of the oats. It was great even for my hubby who does not like meatloaf.

didn't have any oats or mustard, so I just left the mustard out of it and threw in some instant rice instead of the oats.  Came out great.

This is a pretty good recipe. I substituted prepared mustard for the dry stuff (I'm not a huge mustard fan). I chopped some carrots and green bell peppers in there for taste. To keep it moist, I like to add some diced tomatoes and include the liquid. Not sure what my measurements are but I know I use like 1/2 a carrot, 1/4-1/2 a green bell pepper and a large sized can of the diced tomatoes. What I really love about this recipe (now that's I've totally distorted it) is the glaze on top. It's simple but has some great results. My bf is picky, picky, picky, but he liked it. :)

Very good dish. I used two cups whole wheat bread crumbs in place of oats and used 1 pound of hot flavored sausage.

Reminds me of my Mom's meatloaf.  There wasn't enough sauce remaining to put on top, so I added a few shots of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce - it was perfect!  Thanks for the recipe!

This meatloaf was a hit with my non-meatloaf-loving husband.  Success!  

I used whole oats instead of instant, and because of that, the mixture was a little too wet, so I added about 1/4 cup of bread crumbs, and it was perfect.  I also added some fresh chopped parsley.

I too substituted the sausage roll with chorizo (sorry Bob Evans) and top it off with parmesan.  Low and behold it turns out great every time.  I double the sauce measurements though..

The boyfriend was apprehensive about having meatloaf at first but I finally went ahead and used this recipe. To add to the recipe I added a half a green pepper - diced - and it came out wonderful! The reason I'm giving this 4 stars is that when I cut it to serve, it fell apart rather easily. Maybe I didn't mix the egg in well enough? All in all, still very TASTY!

I thought it was good, as far as meatloaf goes - and one of my two children ate it - but the other child wouldn't touch it (no surprise) and my husband didn't like it at all.  All he could taste was the oatmeal, I couldn't taste it all - so it's not going to stay in my recipe box.

YUM!  I used a squirt of yellow mustard, a 12 oz. package of sausage and a half box of stuffing leftover from another recipe instead of the quick oats.  I also got busy, cooked it for a little longer than I was supposed to so I put the reserved ketchup mixture on without putting it back in the oven.  Very tasty!

My family and my boyfriend loved this recipe, in fact we always double it when we make it as there never seem to be many leftovers...I Loved the basic recipe but these are the changes I made.  I followed someones advice and substituted chicken stuffing mix for the oatmeal, I had some mild Italian sausages thawed which I took out of the casings and substituted for the sausage, I add garlic,  oregano,Epicure three onion and  the garlic dip mix for a bit more flavor ( I love spices)... and I agree with the other reviewers who suggest to increase the sauce...its very nice to have extra.  I made my sauce a bit more smokey by adding to it a teaspoon of smokey paprika ( the kind used in Pallella...really yummy) added a bit of vinegar and Worcestershire sauce,  and garlic to the ketchup and mustard as well... and last but not least I top the whole thing with slices of bacon!  mmmm enjoy!

Have tried lots of meatloaf recipes and this is now my go-to meatloaf.  Lots of flavor and moist, great texture.  I've only used regular oats not quick, and it's great.  Get raves even from meatloaf haters.

Very good. I had Hot Italian Sausage so that was yummy for us.  I had read the other reviews about substituting Cornbread Stuffing for the oats, so I tried that.  It was good. I had used oats before a few times and sometimes it was too mushy. I like the stuffing.  I made the rest of the package of stuffing as a side which everyone always loves.  It is true; there is not enough ketchup mixture to cover whole thing, so I experimented and used Maggi Hot and Sweet sauce (very thin) on top of half of the loaf. I liked it a lot.  Nice and spicy.  Enjoy. Oh, it was very easy too!

I made 2 batches of the ketchup, brown sugar and dry mustard sauce. One I mixed in with the meatloaf and the other I put on top. The baking time was perfect. I also sautéed the onions before adding to the meat mixture. I also used 1 cup of chicken stuffing instead of the oats. Super moist and delicious.
