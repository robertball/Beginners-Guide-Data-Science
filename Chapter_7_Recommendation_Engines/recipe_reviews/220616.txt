I made one change.  Instead of onion powder I added some finely chopped onions.  Delicious!

I made a few changes instead of onion and garlic powder I used diced onions and garlic, and I used Cajun seasoning. It was a hit!

I too used fresh onion and garlic instead of powder. The only change I would make next time would be less eggs. I seemed to have quite a bit that didn't mix into the potoatoes. I am guessing my "large" potato wasn't as large as the original recipe's large. Fresh black pepper and lots of it and the addition of the cheeses made this quite tasty.. I enjoyed it

With the fresh garlic and onion, as recommended by the other cooks, these potato pancakes are delicious. Thanx for the recipe.

VERY GOOD! I read the reviews and decided to use one less egg. It still seemed a bit watery, so I added in about 2-3 TBSPS. of flour, and that brought everything together nicely. These had great flavor w/ the addition of the ham. A definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Feeling lazy and made it with onion and garlic powder...these pancakes are really good using the recipe exactly as written. Five star review by the kids too! Will definitely make this again - excellent use of left over ham (I just chopped it finely). Thank you chocoholic1!

I really liked these, I didn't have any ham, I used cooked bacon instead of the ham. I took others advice and used real onions and garlic. I also added some parsley. Defiantly will make again. I gave 4 stars because I did not follow the recipe to the T.

I do use my medium microplane grater for the onion and garlic but, with this addition, they are marvelous!

The flavor was nice but this was way too watery!
