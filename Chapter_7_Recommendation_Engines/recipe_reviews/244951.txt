I like the addition of the honey and Dijon it's like putting a honey mustard dipping sauce on the inside. I cooked up 5 chicken breasts which I flattened to all the same thickness. I wouldn't have had any more egg mixture left for a 6th one..let alone 12 . I would double that if making the full batch.

I cut the recipe to two servings using one package of Costco's organic boneless skinless chicken breasts cut horizontally.  I started to run out of the mixture to dip the chicken in, so if you want to double dip, I'd suggest doubling that part---or at least half again as much.  We really liked the flavor of the breading because I did fry it in coconut oil, and then rather than use lemon for serving we used a little drizzle of coconut white balsamic vinegar (yum) on top.  We have some leftovers that will become a sandwich tomorrow night for our dinner.  Thank you for a very welcome change for our dinner tonight!

I thought this was quite good. I made pork schnitzel before, but prefer chicken. I left off the salt and lemon wedges.

I'll make this again, but probably will try a spicy brown mustard instead...

These were crispy, flavorful and perfect with some sweet/sour red cabbage! I used wild turkey breast, pounded out flat. Made homemade breadcrumbs from old pretzel rolls in the freezer. Perfect!
