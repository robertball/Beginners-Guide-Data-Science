This is a terrific recipe.  On a scale of 1 to 5 I give it a 10.  It is sweet though so it is more for a person with a sweet tooth.

I love White hot chocolate, but dont love the calories that come with it.  This is a much healthier yet yummy version!  I sometimes add raspberry extract to it, to make it taste like the ones you get at some coffee houses.  Even my four year old daughter loves it!
