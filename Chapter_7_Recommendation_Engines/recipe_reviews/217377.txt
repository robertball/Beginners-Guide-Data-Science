My fianc√©e said the sauce was "spot on"; however he would have liked more mushroom so I will do that next time :)

the flavors in this sauce are phenomenal. I used cumin for the cajun spice.   you can cut back on the sodium content if you substitute fresh tomatoes instead of canned, and I added 1/4 cup brown sugar.

This was pretty good. A bit too spicy for me. The Worcestershire sauce was a bit too powerful, so I would recommend stepping it down a bit. Makes a LOT of spaghetti!

Great recipe! Don't use that much Cajun at all. I added some sugar too..but overall..great!
