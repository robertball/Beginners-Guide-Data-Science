My girlfriend made these for dinner and they were great. We heeded the reviews and reduced the amount of vinegar and they didn't have a harsh vinegar taste. In fact, they didn't taste of vinegar at all. All of the ingredients combined to make a very balanced and savory taste that went well with the crisp steamed beans. Fresh beans cannot be compared with canned. I gave it 4 stars only because of the need to reduce the amount of vinegar...I gave my girlfriend a 5!

Excellent side dish and a great way to perk up green beans.  The white wine vinegar wasn't overpowering and gave it just enough zip.  I used steam in bag green beans to save on time and a mix of freshly grated parmesan and romano cheeses.  This is a keeper and goes great with grilled steak.

Excellent! Had the perfect blend of seasonings and the vinegar gave them an extra little kick. My whole family loved them, so I guess I will be making them again tonight with my hubby's favorite meatloaf recipe! Thanks for sharing!

We love these green beans, and it was a good way to make use of the tons of green beans that we grew and that our neighbor insisted we take home. I wouldn't change anything about this recipe. Delicious, and unique. Thank you for sharing it! UPDATE: We also like using this recipe on fresh, steamed asparagus as well. It is even better on asparagus!

This is what I call a realistic recipe. It's great to throw together for that fresh out of the garden taste. The ingredients are main staples in my kitchen and the dish adds a crisp color to any dinner setting. The green beans are complimented very nicely and there is no question that they are being showcased. I personally could do without the parsley. All that being said there isn't a lot to rave about. They are after all just green beans, but they are a good side. Enjoy!

I didn't have fresh garlic and was a little nervous about the white wine vinegar.  So after steaming the green beans for approx 7 minutes...I tossed in olive oil and garlic sea salt, topped with shredded parmesian cheese.  Awesome!

These were pretty good.  Hubby liked them more than me.  I thought the vinegar taste was a little strong but I had to modify the recipe for portion size so I might have been off on the amount.  All in all, not bad.

I love green beans, but this recipe wasn't what I expected. I think the problem here was the vinegar, it gave a very strong flavor.

Easy is right! Nice flavor, too. They don't really look too appetizing the next day, however. The vinegar makes them look a gross moldy green color. I used balsamic vinegar because it's less vinegar-y tasting than white wine vin. Thanks!

Thank you for this great recipe. I did not want to just make steamed green beans tonight with the usual salt, pepper and garlic salt. So I made this but I did change the white vinegar to balsamic vinegar, a little more parmesan cheese and used only a half of teaspoon of minced garlic which stayed in. Loved it and so did everyone else.

I've made this recipe a few times now since both my parents and I like it a lot! The only thing I omitted was the vinegar as we're not a big fan of it.  Other than that, it was awesome!

Simply delicious.
Didn't have the parsley, but I'm sure it tasted just as good as original.

I don't know why I didn't like these more.  I like all of the ingredients, and the combination sounded good, but there just didn't seem to be much flavor.  Maybe not enough salt.  I'd try them again, though.

These beans are excellent!  In an effort to make them more healthy, I cut the olive oil to 1 1/2 tablespoons.  I also used only one tablespoon of wine vinegar.  It still gave it that zip, but it  wasn't overpowering at all.  I used only one level tablespoon of Parmesan/Romano mix.  Finally, I browned the garlic in a pan with olive oil cooking spray, let it soak in the olive oil in a ramekin for about an hour and left the browned garlic in the beans rather than remove it as the recipe calls for.  Much healthier this way and DELICIOUS!

Really liked these green beans! I used frozen whole green bean instead of fresh. The vinegar gave it a nice freshness and the cheese made it special. I will make again!

These are easy and wonderful!  My whole family loves them.  I cooked them in the microwave because I don't have a way to steam them on the stovetop.  I use a white "rice" vinegar, so it has a much milder flavor than regular white vinegar.  Also left out the parsley.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used minced instead of slices of garlic.  I loved this, my fiance thought it was a little tart from the vinegar.  Next time I'll use maybe half the amount of vinegar.  Great out of the ordinary way of serving green beans!

Made these with some overcooked pork chops and thanks goodness I did. At least we had something decent to eat! Used white balsamic vinegar and omitted the cheese because I didn't have any on hand - still a delightful side dish that we'll have again. Thank you for sharing!

Great! Reduced the vinegar a bit (really not that much) as per other recommendations. Everyone liked it. I would suggest covering the green beans as you let them sit for 10 min, cause ours were a little cold (which we don't mind, so it wasn't a problem... just a heads up). I also used minced garlic instead of sliced, so no need to take it out at the end. Will definitely make this again!! And will probably try it on other veggies. Also, I dipped my chicken in the extra sauce, that was good too :o)

This was wonderful! I harvested Bush Beans from the garden today (First harvest:) and wanted a simple way to cook them that had zero sugar. I halved this recipe and chopped extra garlic and left it in with the beans(we love garlic).  I didn't measure anything, but I think I got about the right amounts per the recipe. And I think steaming left them with great flavor.  Thank you for posting this! My boyfriend also loved it and said I should make them like this all the time. (oh, I also used sea salt, and skipped the parsley as I didn't have any, and just put the grated Parmesan cheese on for serving.)

Made as directed except used minced garlic and apple cider vinegar. Tasted ok, not a ton of flavor though, probably due to the fact I didn't marinate for ten minutes. I feel that wouldn't have made much of a difference, i think part of the problem was not having enough of a marinade. The flavor was good, just not enough of it for me.

I loved this recipe.  I used white wine in place of the vinegar and it blended well with the other ingredients.  My family enjoys green beans but found this recipe to be a big step up from plain green beans. This is a keeper.

This is absolutely the best recipe for fresh green beans I've ever had. I did cut down on some of the ingredients because I am a pretty picky eater. I really just added the "pour over" ingredients to my own taste. We just loved the taste!!! I give it a big YUM!!!!

I sauteed the garlic in the olive oil and cooled it before adding it to the mix.  I also reduced the vinegar by half and I would probably reduce it to a fourth next time, I am really just not a fan of vinegar.  This is a nice way to prepare green beans.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband loved them and we will definitely be having them again.  Instead of removing them from the pot, I just added all of the other ingredients directly into the steam pot and tossed them with the beans, then left the lid slightly open so they would stay hot until I was ready to serve them.  The beans were still crisp and perfect (not overcooked from leaving them in the pot). I had to substitute the fresh garlic with garlic powder this time, but I can't wait to try them with fresh! We had them as a side with broiled salmon.  VERY nice complement of flavors together.

I followed the recipe exactly and these turned out great!! My husband loves fresh green beans, but usually the traditional southern way. He raved about these and wants me to serve them for a family get together. I will have to alter the recipe to fix enough for a group of 10-12 people, but I am sure they will be as imprssed as he was. A nice new way to cook green beans and with summer gardens coming in soon, I am sure many more people will love this recipe if they try it. It's good with any meat. Thanks for sharing!!

I made this for the first time for a potluck dinner and received great comments on the flavor.  Per some other comments, I did cut the vinegar amount in half (I think I'll try the full amount next time to check it out).  I also steam-cooked the fresh beans for 8 minutes.  Will definitely make this again!

I made it according to the recipe.  I thought it was excellent - a nice quick variation for plain green beans.  My hubby thought the vinegar taste was a bit too strong so he added French fried onion strings and liked it better that way.

This was really good.  I forgot the Parmesan but it was still yummy!  I just sprinkled "some" salt, pepper and garlic powder over the beans and the topped it with oil and vinegar only.

Fabulous for a side dish. The only change I made was I used parmesano regiono. Flavors were in balance and I will definitely make this again.

I love these. However, instead I sautée them with the ingredients and I add a squeeze of fresh lemon on top instead of vinegar. After they're done cooking I sprinkle a bit of parm on. Also great if you add sautéed onions. Delicious!

Amazing. The beans were fresh from the garden. I steamed them for six minutes. And I used garlic salt in place of the garlic cloves and salt. I also used grated Parmesan cheese because that's all I had on hand. And this is incredible.

My modification for Chinese buffet style green beans: Add an extra clove of garlic, 2 tsp lemon juice, about 1-2 tbsp soy sauce, a pinch of onion powder and cayenne pepper, 1 tsp of rice wine vinegar, and omit the white wine vinegar, cheese, and parsley. I steamed the beans for about 8 minutes and they were just the right mix of crisp-tender without tasting "green"

My husband is a very picky eater and even he said he couldn't tell the difference between these and the beans from his favorite Chinese buffet!

Super simple way to jazz up steamed green beans. My mother-in-law hates green beans but had to admit she liked these! I always follow the recipe before making changes so used the vinegar as directed. Honestly the tang was exactly what I LIKED about it. Wouldn't change a thing.

I didn't have parmesan, so I omitted that.  I used half of the vinegar, and had to use red wine vinegar instead because I didn't have white wine vinegar.  To top it off, I had only minced garlic, so I added that and didn't remove it at the end (you really can't remove minced garlic).  I loved it!  My kids liked it too (14 and 12 year olds).  I will definitely be making this again!

Really easy, equally good.  I also cut back the vinegar and it proved to be a wise choice. Excellent flavor, quick prep and cooking time. Will be a go-to for green beans for me!

This was so quick and easy, I has all the ingredients on hand.  It didn't take long at all.
I usually just throw some salt on my green beans and this really stepped it up!

Thanks

I usually don't give things one star, but we took one bite and that's it. Not sure what went wrong - I even cut down the vinegar a bit and it just tasted wrong - like the flavors did not go together. Sorry.

They were amazing, they were a big hit for my family. I didn't add the exact measurements I just estimated what I felt was right but they still came out amazing, the vinegar gave it a great taste.

Very oily. Chunks of garlic. Just too much "stuff" on the green beans, and didn't like the added flavor.

Recipe was great and I recommend it. Steam for 2-3 minutes longer. Make sure you put a lid on the pot and let the beans soak in the marinade for 4-5 minutes before you serve.

I used frozen green beans and poor hot water for 10- 15 mins, I also mixed extra cheese. My husband and my son loved it. Good recipe, thanks!

I always have a ton of green beans fresh from the garden every year and I get tired of the same old routine. I decided to try this tonight and it is a hit. A new delicious way to eat fresh beans. Even my niece who doesn't like them said she liked them. I will be making this quite often now. Thank you for sharing. :)

Very good, but seemed a little greasy. Like other reviewers, I halved the vinegar, but it was hardly noticeable! I will try again with less oil and the recommended amount of vinegar. My 5-yr-old asked for seconds.

Didn't have parsley and forgot to put on the parmesan but otherwise followed the recipe.  The cooler the beans got, the better they taste!  If I had left overs, I would have loved them cold the next day!

I made this hoping this would jazz up plain old steamed green beans.  While I like the idea of this, my results weren’t what I was hoping for.  I thought 3 T. of oil was totally unnecessary and just lightly drizzled some on. I didn’t particularly want to be fishing out the garlic just before serving, so I used garlic salt, rather than the garlic slices and salt called for in the recipe.  My biggest disappointment (I should have known better) was that after letting them stand for 10 minutes, they were almost cold and not very enjoyable.  If I decide to try this again, I’ll use balsamic vinegar for a little more flavor and I’ll skip the standing time and serve immediately.

Loved this.  I omitted the salt as the parm is plenty salty.  Next time I'll only use about a TBS of oil.  Very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great! I don't even like green beans and this was delicious!  I followed the advice of others and halved the vinegar. I chopped the garlic and left it in...little strong on the garlic, but we love it...so it was perfect.

I don't agree with others who said the taste of vinegar was too strong . . .I didn't taste it much at all.  They were good green beans, but I've had more flavorful green beans.  Of course, I adore green beans so I try as many recipes as I can, so I'm a bit jaded.  Thanks for the recipe!

I boiled a small batch instead of steaming them and substituted garlic power for the fresh garlic, added the ingredients with the beans in a plastic container and shook to mix. Very good and quick!
