The only change I made to this recipe was to add about a good tablespoon of lime juice to "freshen" the taste.  Other than that, it stands on it's own...love it. Thanks Tina!

This was okay.  I think I shouldn't have used the super chunky type salsa as that totally detracted from the taste and texture of the avocado, the one ingredient that I wanted to experience when I made this dish.

Nothing worth writing home about.  This was salsa with avocado chunks.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I figured maybe it would be better than I thought while reading the recipe.  It wasn't.

Well, it certainly isn't very appetizing-looking. But, it's not bad. It's basically just any jarred salsa with avocado chunks.

I had a couple of puny avocados that needed to be used and I stumbled across this little gem. I used a chunky salsa and I added a bit of fresh lime juice. Tasty, pretty and bright flavor. YUM! What a great way to stretch avocados. Thanks for sharing Tina Fox!

Needed a salsa to go on my fish tacos. Mauigirl suggested this one and Man she RIGHT! I was luck enough to find ripe hass avos and had a can of tomates with chilies in the pantry. A quick chop of cilantro and green onion and that was done.i added a sprinkle of garlic salt, pepper and key lime juice, DELICIOUS! Thanks Tina. Keeper!!
