I was looking for something "autumny" to match the weather and this sounded good.  Although we only had one apple in the house (we added 2 tablespoons oil so it didn't turn out dry), it was awesome!!!  I can't wait to try it with 2 apples.  I had my hubby take some to my picky next-door neighbor (okay, she's my mother), and she called requesting this as her standing birthday cake from this day forward.  My kids didn't like it, but they don't like anything without chocolate or vanilla, so their opinions don't count.  The only thing I might change is adding raisins....I think that would make this the best cake ever.  Thanks for an outstanding recipe.

This turned out great! I grated the apples on a cheese grater and used 1 tbl of applesauce to make it extra moist. The sauce was so tasty but it made about twice the amount one would possibly need on this cake. Overall, I loved this and will be making it again!

This is a great recipe and it is very easy to make.  My family loved it!  Try adding a tablespoon of Amaretto to the butter sauce.

This recipe was fabulous! I added an extra apple and the cake was so moist! The icing made too much, though. Next time I will divide the icing ingredients in half and maybe substitute vanilla for almond extract.

Dicing the apples allows you to enjoy their flavor and texture more.  Still, this cake got rave reviews from everyone who tasted it.

This is by far the best ever coffee cake I have had the pleasure of baking! It is moist and quite flavourful and that butter sauce is "to die for"!!! It is quite easy to make and oh so worth it!  Great for brunches or teas!

We celebrated my mom's 75th birthday today.  Went out for Mexican food and margaritas and came home and had this for dessert.  I baked the cake earlier but did not feel like shredding the apples so I cut them in small cubes.  Then I  made the sauce when we got home adding the 1 T. Amaretto as suggested in another review.  It was delicious!  Everyone was 'umm'ing and Mom said that was the best cake she had had in a long time.  Gave her the leftovers to take home.   Reminded us of a bread pudding.  Next time I think I will serve warm with the warm sauce.  This one is going in my keeper file for sure.

First of all, the picture doesn't look like it was made in a glass pie plate. Secondly, I don't understand why we were not to grease the pie plate. All in all, I was disappointed in the cake and will not make it again. After reading the reviews, I was really looking forward to the butter sauce. The taste was no special, the color wasn't good, and it was very sweet. The cake wasn't bad. It was moist and the flavor was all right.
Sorry, Robin.

I added 1 extra apple that was diced instead of grated. Everyone thought the cake was moist and delicious warm. Be sure to stir the sauce enough to completely dissolve the sugar. Very good!

This is the easiest cake I've ever made. It didn't even take the whole 50 minutes. It smelled and tasted great! It's ever so moist, too. I really like the creamy sauce but wish that it's more custardlike. I can't really taste the apples so may add more in the future. I will definitely make this again!

This is really good.  It tastes very holiday-ish/.  It does have about twice as much nutmeg as I feel is necessary though.

This cake is like tasting Fall, it was moist and apple-e-delicous! I took the advice of previous reviews and checked the cake after 30 minutes, and it was done. Also I cut the sauce in half. Wonderful recipe! Thanks for sharing.

This cake is the BEST.  It is perfect just as written.  The only thing I would say is watch cook time closely- for me it was done in more like 40 minutes.  This is a definite keeper- thanks!

Delicious! I used 1/3 whole wheat flour and 2/3 white.  I also went ahead and greased and floured a 9 inch round cake pan... I was scared to try baking this in an ungreased pie plate?!  I baked it and 350 for 30 minutes and it was finished.  I also used 3 large apples.  For the sauce I used brown sugar instead of white sugar (like the picture I would guess) and also had way too much sauce.  I don't have a double broiler either... just cooked on low and stired constantly.  Definately will half the sauce.  This was fabulous! Thank you for the recipe!

I use this recipe all the time. My fiancé's favourite cake is apple and he says this tastes even better than his mom's! I use a basket cakelette pan from Williams-Sonoma, which has a perfect ditch for butter or caramel sauce.

The butter sauce for the recipe is way too much, though. You only need about one third to one half the recipe listed.

This was a delicious, moist and very easy cake to make.  As recommended by others, I finely chopped the apples instead of grating them.  I also added about 1 tsp. of brandy to the sauce, yum yum!!  I was serving it to kids so next time I may add just a few drops more  ; )  This is a wonderful recipe, do give it a try, you won't be disappointed!

This has become one of family's very favorite cakes. I served it at a dinner party last night to rave reviews. The texture is a bit like gingerbread. I add craisins and three apples. Both the cake and sauce has be made in advance. I serve it warm, either warm in oven or microwave a slice for 15 seconds.

I am eating my 2nd slice and find this DELICIOUS! I only had small apples, so I used 4 of them. I used a silicon form and turned the oven off at 35 minutes. I have not yet made the sauce, because I am trying to save calories, but alone this cake is very moist!

Made this cake for my husband's family.  They all absolutely loved it.  This cake was heavenly!  I also used three apples in my cake...and it did end up boiling over the dish.  Was still delicious.  And yes....too much sauce...but, holy cow, was it delicious!  Will be making again.

There's nothing amazing about this recipe, it's just a really good breakfast bread (like zucchini bread or banana bread).  I like that it was a simple recipe so my daughter could help and cooking it in the pie pan was nice and easy, too.  (not sure what's going on with the picture that goes with this recipe because clearly that's not the same shape)  And we all loved the butter sauce but i agree with the others that it calls for way too much - i made a half-batch and i still had a lot left over.

The cake is absolutely delicious.  Followed previous advice and added a bit more apple, and kept the apples chunky.  I also halved the butter sauce recipe.    I am only giving this 4 stars because there's no advice given on what to do with the butter sauce if the cake is not being served immediately.  I would not recommend adding all of the sauce to the cake because it would become too soggy.  I only used a small portion of the sauce for what was being served immediately, and didn't bother to reheat the sauce at future servings.  The good news is the cake is delicious without the sauce.  Next time I will not make the sauce!

I have many similar apple cake recipes but all have been made with oil.   This one is much better - butter makes the difference.   Half the sauce is enough or it is just too sweet.  Thanks for submitting an apple cake that is superior.

The sauce definitly makes the cake!  So yummy!  The cake itself was very moist, but I feel it was lacking in flavor.  Next time I make this, I will try to make it more apple-y, maybe  by adding applesauce.

Instead of a pie plate, next time I would use a normal cake pan to make sure it cooks more evenly.  My friends liked it and said to make it again.  The texture was a little different- really moist- but still good.  Use only about 1 tbsp of the sauce- it's really rich.

Followed the directions, but did not turn out how I thought.  Something was missing, rather just make an old fashioned apple pie.

Followed recipe with the exception of using a cake pan instead of a pie pan and loved it. Got raves reviews from family. Like others I halved the sauce and used brown sugar, which made a divine caramel sauce. This cake is moist as is and very easy to throw together. This will be a regular at my house. My mouth is watering now just remembering it.

OMG!!! This cake is incredible and sooo easy to make.  I was looking for a butter sauce similar to the sauce Applebea's serves on their Blondie Sundae and figured I'd try the cake as well.  It didn't last long.  This one is a keeper!

I misread the recipe and bought thick cream, instead of heavy whipping cream. I guess the topping was supposed to be fluffy, but mine turned out runny. It was still delicious though. I'll try it with the whipping cream next time. YUM!

I used half the sugar and 3 apples. This was very good but it did  not rise like a cake does. I sprinkled some sugar in the raw over the top before I placed it into the oven. This was done in 40 minutes.

We really liked this cake! I followed the recipe, except added about  1/2 c. of freshly made applesauce (my neighbor gave me a bucket of apples.....I had lots of apples to use up!). Also used a 9" square glass baking dish (lightly sprayed) and baked for 40 minutes instead of the 50 mentioned in recipe.  It was moist and ohh so tasty! Didn't do the butter topping. Didn't need it. It was great with a scoop of vanilla ice cream! Give this one a try. You won't be disappointed!

Huge success!! The sauce made too much and I cut the amount by half! My husband, who isn't a sweets person, LOOOOVED this cake. It is dense and like bread pudding. This might be my new signature dish :)

Perfect! I've done this recipe 3 times and it's a good call to add one more apple and you may decrease the sugar a little bit; the last time I divided the flour by 3, one third all purpose flour, one third whole wheat flour and one third soy flour to add protein and it came out great! I even served it without the butter sauce and it didn't need it.

Fantastic rich and moist cake with ALL THE BUTTER SAUCE.  I disagree with the reviewers who said they'd use half the sauce.  I've made other cakes similar in style and the cake should be drenched in the sauce, not just drizzled with it.  I used 3 apples, grated 1 and 1/2 and just chopped the other 1 and 1/2 for great texture.  I also added a (very generous) teaspoon of amaretto to the sauce.  The guys looooved it!

this cake was very tasty.  i did, however make a few small changes.  i really like cinnamon, so i upped it to a full tsp.  also, i like using wheat flour, so i used 1/2c wheat and 1/2c white flour.  instead of a glass pie pan i used my pampered chef stoneware pie pan.  it was very tasty and moist.  the sauce went with it very well too.

If we could give this more stars...we most certaintly would.  My DH is still making remarks about this recipe.  What an outstanding recipe and nothing could be easier.  Last weekend we went to the Octoberfest in Mt Angel, Oregon and he had their apple cake with butter sauce and he says this is even better.  Will be making this for years to come.  Thank you for sharing.

My mother requested a spice cake for her birthday, and based on reviews, I picked this one.  She was disappointed it wasn't a traditional 2 layer cake with icing, until she tried it.  She said it tasted like a fancy desert you'd get at a nice restaraunt.  Everyone raved and loved it.  Its very rich, moist, great served with ice cream.  There was a lot of excess butter sauce, you could easily 1/2 the ingredients for it.

This is just like my Mom's recipe from the 50's.
It is fabulous and so pretty to serve. Excellent on a fall night!
It can take any apple as the spices enhance some of the apples without too much appley taste.

If I could give this more stars I would.  This is by far the best apple dessert I have ever eaten.  No changes needed.  I always make two recipes of the cake and one of the sauce.  I didn't have nutmeg so I used pumpkin pie spice and it was fantastic.  Never bothered to try it with nutmeg.

Reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup; could probably reduce to 2/3. Halved the sauce; it was plenty. Baked in a 9" round pan, which I greased because I couldn't believe I'd be able to get it out of the pan without doing so and I wasn't willing to risk it. Super-easy recipe.

I was looking to replace an apple cake recipe I had lost when I found this. the butter sauce sold me on trying it. I added an extra apple as well as 1 cup chopped pecans and about 1/2 cup raisins. baked in a square pan at 325 for 50 minutes. came out purrrr-fect. poured the hot sauce over it and let it soak in and served it hot. it was very much like bread pudding. next time I think I will use a rum sauce (substitute imitation rum for vanilla)  a new family favorite for sure. thank you for a great recioe!

This is very good! It's very moist and flavorful. It did take more time than I wanted due to having to grate the apples but it was worth it.

Made for my yoga class Christmas potluck, and it got RAVES!!! I used half AP flour and half whole-wheat; half white and half brown sugar. I also roughly chopped my apples (used 2 Galas) because I like texture, which worked well. The sauce, well . . . I'd cut the sugar down, as it was VERY sweet, but we just drizzled a bit onto each slice. I think a shot of rum to the sauce would be excellent!

Skipped the sauce, used gala apples, baked in a 9x9 glass pan. Turned out great. Very moist!

This was really good, almost reminded me of carrot cake. I diced the apples and they still just baked right in and disappeared. I did use half whole wheat flour which made it a little darker but adds a little nutrition. I also cut the sauce recipe in half, still plenty of it. Although my sauce looked nothing like the picture, it was like an icing.

Wonderful cake.  I served mine with a white chocolate glaze instead of the butter sauce (had the glaze made already and was too lazy to make butter sauce lol).  Everyone had seconds and it was gone in a flash.

This cake was amazing!  I saved the butter sauce in a jar to serve later.  Everything was perfect!  Even my not so big apple eaters loved it!

Great recipe! I cut the nutmeg down to 1/4 tsp. Will cut it down to 1/8 next time I make this recipe. Although we like nutmeg, it overpowered all the other flavors. Could be because we use organic nutmeg - which is definitely more flavorful than conventional. Also took other reviewers advice & only made half the qty. of sauce. Sweet enough to use as a drizzled topping. New family favorite!!!

Fantastic!!!!  I took a chance and made this for Thanksgiving (Canada) and it was a hit.  I only had to bake it for 30 minutes.  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  SUPER!!

PHENOMENAL cake, and the sauce tops it off excellently.  Sauce is like Applebee's Maple Brownie Sundae sauce ... mmmmmmm!
Husband and children (ages 6 and 9) loved it.  The best compliment?  After serving small seconds of the dessert, my son asked, "Can I have thirds?"

So delicious! I used two jumbo apples, one grated and one chopped fine. I also added a 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste.

 I made this for my husband who used to eat apple cake as a kid. He said it tasted like a great memory!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Always popular when I make it. Excellent without the sauce as well (which is very sweet). A food processor really helps with grating the apples. I also cube about 1/2 an apple - leaves wonderful chewy bits in the cake.

The sauce is lovely - I cut the ingredients in half and it was plenty.  My mother-in-law loved the cake and my sister thought it should be thicker.  Hubby said it lacked something and I agree.  For some reason, it is not satisfying and not worth all the butter and calories.

I switched the butter sauce for a cinnamon, clove and nutmeg-based frosting, and it was very tasty.  Quite sugary, but rich and filling.  Yummy!

The cake part was nothing too exciting, but the butter sauce was delicious. Next time I'm going to add an extra apple. I doubled the cake recipe and put it in 3 8" cake pans. Then I baked it for 35 min. which turned out to be too long. I used Caramel Frosting VII (also from this site) inbetween the two middle layers- I didn't put any on the top. Then I served it with the butter sauce- wonderful my family loved it! I used regular whipping cream for the butter sauce, and it still turned out fine.
