Delicious! Didn't even want to share it once I tasted it! I only had a can of chopped clams so I gave a quick whirl in food processor and that did the trick. I was so eager to make this I didn't read directions well and drained the clams. So no juice to use to get the "right" consistency. I used my stand mixer so that the ingredients got nicely mixed. To get consistency I wanted I added about 2 T. Sour cream. For onion juice I just used a micro plane to grate onion, which essentially juiced it. Great on crackers, but also great on toasted rye bread. Yum! Thanks Lucky!
