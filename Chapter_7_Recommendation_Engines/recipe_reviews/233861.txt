So I totally blanked and forgot to marinate this and it was still awesome!  My piece of bison was really thick, so I cut it in half, length-wise, and THEN flattened my two pieces.  I skipped chopping the spinach and added the feta cheese directly to the meat and spinach.  I also left out the olives because we're not a fan in our house.  The oregano in this recipe had me skeptical, but I really liked it (and I had to use dried.)  It gave it a really nice flavor that went well with the feta cheese.  I sprinkled some lemon juice on it before it went in the oven to try to make up for my mistake of not marinating it.  I cooked it for probably 25 - 28 minutes (one of my pieces was smaller, so I took it out) and then let them rest for 5 - 7 minutes before cutting.  My husband and I both really enjoyed it and it was quick enough for a weeknight meal (but nice enough that I would totally serve it to company.)  Fantastic recipe!

Whenever I’ve cooked flank steak on the grill or in a stir fry, instructions have always said to “slice on the bias” for tenderness.  Unfortunately, you can’t do that with this recipe.  I have to wonder if a flank steak, whether bison or beef, is the best cut of meat for this recipe, particularly since bison is so incredibly lean.  The recipe says to cook for 35-40 minutes, but has no cooking temperature indicated.  I looked up stuffed beef tenderloin on this site, and all recipes said to cook at  425 degrees F, so that’s what I did.  Took the meat out at 25 minutes, and it was just slightly pink, overcooked for us contributing to the chewiness.  Probably 5 minutes less would have been better as far as doneness goes.  The flavor of the bison was sweet and the filling was good, but unfortunately, the meat itself was tough.  From an eye appeal point of view, I also think it would have benefitted from slightly browning the meat on the stovetop before going into the oven, as visually, it did not develop a nice browned crust.  This is my first time cooking bison, and I did like the flavor of this recipe, but I’m not sure this is the best way to cook bison flank steak.

The first time I used bison... AWESOME. The second time I made this recipe with beef flank steak... STILL AWESOME. I'm not a fan of olives so the third time I replaced the olives with bacon. That's right, I said bacon. It changes the flavor drastically from awesome to EPIC!

The flank steak turned out really chewy for me. Otherwise, it was a decent recipe. I'm with another reviewer; I think a different cut would be a lot better. I'm happy to have tried bison, but I'd like to experiment with it with different recipes other than this one. Thanks for the fun idea, though.
