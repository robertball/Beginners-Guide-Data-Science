The quantities for this recipe are totally wrong!  The mixture ends up far too wet.

the ingredients in this recipe are way off. It was sloppy to the extreme.Is it a diabetic recipe as there is no sugar. Awful.

I followed the recipe to the letter and found it way too runny!  There was no need to form a well in the centre for the jam, as the mixture flattened out and the jam bored a hole (while cooking) straight into the biscuit base.  It tasted like pancake more than cookie.  I tried fixing it up a bit with the addition of sugar and a little more flour to firm it up a bit - but after one failed batch after another, it went down the sink.  Sorry....:((

Yep, if you follow the recipe, the cookie batter is way too sloppy! I should have read the reviews before attempting it! I made it with non-wheat flour (rice and potato flour, a commercial brand) which requires you use less liquid in recipes, but still ended up putting in an extra cup or so of the non-wheat flour until I got a mixture that would roll into balls. Hey, it turned out fine in the end. These are not sweet cookies, and if you use non-sugar jam (jam sweetened on fruit concentrate) rather than ordinary sugar jam you will - with a bit of experimenting with the flour- end up with okay sugar-free biscuits. My diabetic uncle sure loves them! Me too.

I agree recipe is wrong, mix ended up much too wet.  Added several handfuls of flour til it looked right.  Even tossed in some sugar because the batter didn't taste sweet.

How are you supposed to make a hole when this comes out wetter than pancake batter? I had to find another recipe! Complete waste of ingredients.

This recipe is not good.   I followed it exactly and the batter was super runny.  So the 2nd batch I added more flour.   No idea what custard powder does to help this recipe as they taste bland and salty.  The only good thing is the bite of jelly.   I have a sugar cookie recipe I’ll use and just add jelly drops to that as this was a total waste I f ingredients.  Don’t waste your time!

The mixture was like batter had to keep adding flour so that I could handle it and because the recipe said use sr flour they came out of the oven like little cakes . The end result was not what I was expecting I will not be makeing it again
