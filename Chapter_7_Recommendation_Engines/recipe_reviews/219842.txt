Very good easy. We made our own taco seasoning from another recipe on allrecipes don't think I will ever buy packaged taco seasoning again as I like being able to decrease amount of salt.

Southwest Chicken was great! 4 stars just because the recipe really didn't go into a whole lot of detail about the rice but hey its rice... whats there to really figure out? Super pleased because this was a really easy dish to make that turned out tasty! Only thing I changed was the salsa I used Chi-Chi's Salsa which was pretty darn tasty. The only problem I had was when I was tossing the seasoning mix with the chicken some of it ended up stuck to my fingers so next time I might add more to compensate for sticky fingers! Overall was a pretty great dish easy to prep make and the taste was right on! Definitely saving this recipe for a later date.

I loved this recipe! I'm definitely saving and I will make this again. Note: Makes enough food for 3 adults. If you have a large family you may need to adjust the recipe:).

Yummy! Loved it. I didn't have any green onions or chicken thighs. I used yellow onions and boneless chicken breast and it came out great. I also cooked the onions when browning the chicken.

I used this to start and changed the recipe a bit. First I cooked the rice with Sazon seasoning to add more flavor. I also would suggest using more chicken. I used 1.5lb. and I thought the amount of chicken compared the the rest of hte ingredients wasn't enough. The combination of the taco seasoning and italian dressing was delicious! My boyfriend and kids told me that I could have just served the chicken and they would have been thrilled. I used about 4 tablespoons of dressing and a whole packet of seasoning. I also put in plain diced tomatoes in addition to the salsa. Most of my meals are from scratch and the family has really loved my dinners lately but last night I was told that this was the best dinner in a long time. So this will earn a permanant spot in my dinner ideas.

Delicious and filling. Only changed two things: I used a different brand of taco seasoning and left off the cheese to accommodate a family member with a dairy allergy. (The rest of us added cheese to our plates.) Everyone went back for seconds and none of us were actually still hungry when we did so. =D

The flavors in this recipe are wonderful. Just a touch of spice and loads of flavors. I changed a few of the amounts of the ingredients to adjust to our tastes and used my own Spanish Rice recipe. The chicken turned out so tender and tasty and you can taste the Italian Dressing slightly. The chunky salsa gives a nice texture against the corn and beans.Family loved it hubby took some to work for lunch a double portion!

This was a very tasty recipe. I used a mild taco seasoning mix and Chi-Chi's salsa. I didn't have green onions so I left those out and I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of Mexican-style. This is quick and easy and I will put it in my recipe box to use again and again.

Surprised how good this was! I didn't use green onion but added chopped onion and banana peppers from our garden. We like cheese so I used mozerella and chedder to our taste. No complaints just compliments.

Loved this! I also made this recipe with white onions and chicken breast since I did not have any chicken thighs or green onions on hand. Also instead of using the brown rice I made the cilantro lime rice resipe from this website and my husband and I both added sour cream on top. It was excellent and I will definitely be making this again!

My absolute favorite dish right now! And perfect over the brown rice. Made it for my women's monthly get-together and everyone just loved it! Great pot-luck dish. I just use any kind taco seasoning and I've made it with and without the Italian dressing (subbed olive oil) and any kind jar salsa to keep it quick and easy and it always comes out fantastic.

Made this tonight and we loved it! I used extra virgin olive oil to brown a lb of frozen grilled chicken pieces along with a few tsp of frozen chopped onion. We only had fajita seasoning so I used maybe 1 1/2 tsp of that along with the chicken and onions. I didn't use the whole can of black beans because our favorite salsa also has black beans and corn. We used white rice and it was still delicious. Also topped with sour cream and then dipped tortilla chips in it. This was so quick to throw together with what I had. Awesome!

This was really good. Had to give it only 4 stars because I really screwed up. I had decided on making this dish early in the day so by 6:30pm when I started to making it I realized I didn't even have all the ingredients. Argh! So I improvised and even with my screw up it was so good. I had to use red onion (didn't have green) and I cooked it with the chicken. Then I had no black beans only non-fat refried. I smothered those on the bottom of the casserole then topped with the chicken. We love corn so I used closer to 1 cup. Then I realized I only had about 2 Tbs salsa. So I substituted 3/4 a can of diced tomatoes with chili garlic and cilantro and mixed in some more diced green chilis. Stuck that in the oven covered. Then to top it off I only had Colby Monterey Jack not Mexican and served it over brown rice. But it all worked. You know its a great recipe when you can mess up and it still turns out good. I'm keeping this one for sure!

The chicken turned out amazing and I might use it this way in other recipes. Quick and delicious I'll definitely make this over and over again. Would be very easy to double the recipe for a larger family in a 9x13 casserole dish.

I used extra dressing to cook the chicken and after picking out the chicken for the casserole added the extra dressing to water and cooked the rice with it. Also used sour cream and green onions as a topping. I would make this again!

This was really good and super easy. I made it with green chilis rather than green onions. I also didn't have frozen corn so I used a can or corn with poblano peppers. And I misread the instructions and put the cooked rice at the bottom of the casserole pan and baked it all together. I figured it would soak up extra liquid but it actually came out a bit watery (user error I doubt the recipe as is has that issue). Was so good even despite the error! I'll definitely be making this again.

Better than expected! Made it as directed except (a) didn't use the same brand of Taco Seasoning & Salsa (b) used breast instead of thighs and (c) made my black beans from scratch rather than out of a can. The casserole ended up with a little "juice" in the bottom which didn't look too appealing BUT worked great when serving over rice (Basmati is my choice of rice). For me the oven time might be a tad shy. I baked for 30 minutes at 350 until is was bubbling nicely around the edges then added the cheese and broiled for an additional 10 until it was golden brown. This recipe is SO simple and quick; perfect for the working family that prefers "real" food over processed frozen meals. Hint: Double the recipe so you don't have to cook tomorrow:-). I'll definitely make this again!

I didn't have the pre-packaged taco seasoning mix but All Recipes had a great quick recipe with all the spices in my cabinet. This perfectly matched what I had available without having to go out and shop. Big hit with my boys who demanded a repeat performance next week!

I decided to make these into individual packets! I layered the diced onion frozen corn black beans salsa.. then topped it with a chicken breast that I had coated witht he italian dressing (i left out the taco seasoning mix didn't feel it was needed). Topped the chicken breast with the shredded cheese. Cooked in the foil packets in the oven. Delicious! Served brown rice on the side.

Loved this simple recipe! I used what I had on hand so boneless chicken breasts instead of thighs and Monterey Jack cheese with jalapeños. Oh and I didn't read the recipe through and combined the rice in the casserole dish. I think being able to limit the amount of rice per serving would have been better though. Will definitely make again.

Made it 100% by recipe. Hate it when folks don't follow the recipe and then gripe it doesn't come out the way they thought it would. Anyway next time will probably toss in a couple or three diced serranos to give it a bit more heat but that is personal preference.

Really great dish! I made my own taco seasoning from a recipe on Allrecipes and I also made my own Italian dressing! because I didn't have either and a trip to the store seemed like more work than just making them myself! I used a little more dressing in the frying pan than was called for. My boyfriend loved this dish too I will definitely be making it again and again!

This recipe turned out to be a great inspiration. Changes were made based on ingredients onhand but the italian dressing and taco seasoning went together surprisingly well. You can certainly take liberties such as using rotisserie chicken or adding more veggies of different kinds. I did and it turned out great. I am not encouraging deviation from this recipe just want to explain that at the core is a very tasty dish that works with variations quite well. My 18mo loved it!

Amazing! I mix everything in a skillet including the rice rather than layering it in Pyrex. I double the corn put a full can of black beans and 1.5x salsa. Add sour cream ontop of each plate.

Made as written except used a full can (398 ml) of black beans just to use them up. Served with basmati rice. This has excellent flavor and the chicken is extremely tender. Will definitely be making this again and again.

We made this with chicken breasts and carefully used dairy free cheese for me on one part and regular cheese for the rest of my family on the rest. We also didn t use taco seasoning and seasoned more how we typically season our own tacos which involves more spice and less salt and it worked out wonderfully! Also works well reheated.

Delicious! I made a few adjustments and am so happy to have another recipe to add to my collection! I substituted onions with 1/8 tsp onion powder Taco Bell seasoning with 2 TBS McCormick seasoning used store brand salsa drained canned corn instead of frozen and added 1/4 cup more cheese to the top. For the rice I made a box of Near East brown rice with orzo. The rice take about 35 mins to cook so I got that going early on so it would be ready when the casserole came out. I added approx 2 more minutes of cook time to the casserole after adding the cheese since my rice still needed a bit more time to be done. Thank you for another fabulous dinner!

Quick easy and nutritious. My only difference was having a salsa verde medium on hand rather than a tomato-based salsa. Excellent!

So Good! I didn't change recipe at all but did do my own version of Spanish Rice with brown rice. It was so good. For my version of Spanish Rice I used Jalapeno bacon found at Walmart. Cooked 4 pieces until crisp. Sauteed an onion in bacon grease then added 1 cup of rice. Stir until rice is coated. There should be like 1-2 T. of bacon drippings in pan. Coat the uncooked rice (I used Minute Rice). Add small can of tomato sauce and then add 1 can of water. Bring to a boil and lower to low heat and boil according to directions on pkg. I then cut up avocado into chunks and served next to the spicy Spanish Rice. Nice combo with this dish. Enjoy!

Very tasty I will make it again. I also won t mind increasing some the ingredients. I did use my favorite salsa and cheese and taco mix but it came out great. Mine was mild but there is room to spice it up if that is your thing.

I love this! I followed the recipe without altering anything and it was perfect. I made it again but had no taco season so I made my own. It wasn't as good so I will make sure to have all ingredients on hand next time I make it.

Love this! I substitute the juice of one lime for the salad dressing skip the green onions use a whole can of black bean and most of a can of corn (instead of frozen). We also serve with white rice instead of brown. Great with tortilla chips!

Didn't change a thing in this recipe and it was absolutely DELICIOUS! I loved the "blandness" of the brown rice as a fantastic complement to the zesty flavors of the dish. It was easy to make and very filling!

Very yummy!! To suit my family I made it a one-dish dinner combining everything except the cheese which was added at the end of baking. I cooked the onion with the chicken and used chicken broth to cook the rice. This is an extremely versatile dish so I'm sure I'll be using this frequently without it getting boring.

This was SO good. I did not have italian dressing so I used a little red wine vinegar and white rice instead of brown. Great comfort food dish. Shared with my neighbor whose wife passed away since she always cooked for him.

I changed it fairly substantially by taking it up to 3lbs of thighs. I left out the salsa used olive oil & butter instead of the italian dressing to brown the chicken used a home made taco seasoning added 6 cloves of garlic 1 can creamed corn instead of frozen corn drained but didn't rinse the beans used a roasted onion instead of green onions used basmati instead brown rice and added cayenne pepper. Did it all in a dutch oven. Baked at 350 for 30 min covered and then added the cheese and baked 10 more min uncovered.

This needed a lot of doctoring to give it any flavor. Coat the chicken in the taco seasoning and add 1/2 teaspoon of each: cumin onion powder salt chili powder oregano and a dash of cayenne pepper. I also added some lime juice. Then cook chicken in oven-safe skillet toss with remainder of ingredients (I also added a can of diced green chiles) cover with cheese and put in oven just enough for it to warm and for the cheese to melt. No need for the casserole dish! Enjoy:)

I used a green bell pepper & a clove of garlic instead of corn since my family doesn't like corn. I also used green chile salsa and used more like 2 cups. I think this will be good heated up in the morning with eggs to make breakfast burritos. Next time: I will cook the onion and peppers up so they are very soft as I baked this about 40 minutes so it wouldn't be crunchy.

Good flavor! Nice weeknight meal. I used a different brand of salsa cheese and I used sauted yellow onions instead of green. Just want to remind those not familiar with cooking brown rice that it takes longer than white (about an hour).

Yum! Family loved. I had to make several substitutions based on what I had but it generally was very close to the recipe so here goes: southwest salad dressing instead of Italian 1 large boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs yellow onion instead of green can of diced tomatoes w/ green chiles instead of salsa and shredded cheddar & parm cheese instead of 4 cheese. This was very good and everything different that I used was just a slight variation to the original ingredients so I m pretty sure it would be just as good so therefore 5 stars. I also added two small packets of fast food salsa to make the diced tomatoes have a bit more salsa flavor. This was a great dish to eat with tortilla chips! I think this would also make a great taco filling(shred the chicken) slow cooker meal or soup/chili(add chicken broth). Thank you I ll make this again!

This is another one of those recipes that's so simple to make...but so tasty....I made the recipe as written using white shoepeg canned corn because that is my preference. I served it over jasmine rice and it was simply delicious..Thanks for a great recipe. I will definitely be making this again

This was very good! My wife added a sweet potato to the casserole doubled the black beans and corn and we added pico de gallo and sour cream to garnish. The cilantro in the pico was just what this needed for a perfect bite. We crunched a few tortilla chips on top as well.

This was really tasty. I used different brand named items for the dressing (used 1/4cup) and salsa (used about 1.5 cups) and I used Taco Seasoning Mix I from allrecipes.com. Also used entire can of black beans. I didn't layer ingredients just mixed together everything but cheese and rice. Will definitely make this again.

I sautéed cut up chicken tenders - like the flavor better than chicken thighs. When I was done browning the chicken - I spread it in my baking dish then sprinkled with about 1 cup of cooked jasmine rice. Then I topped it with everything else (including 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro). I didn't want to take it out of the oven for the cheese - so I mixed a tiny bit of salt and chili powder with 1 cup mozzarella cheese and patted that down on top. Baked for 25 minutes - then broiled for one minute. Came out so very good - I thought this would just be a ho-hum recipe - but it is very delicious!!! Will use again!

Read the reviews and this was better than expected - but only after it sat for a few days. I just ate the last of the leftovers today (Thursday) after making it Monday. Eating it right after preparing it left something to be desired. Unsure why. Used taco seasoning recipe from allrecipes. Didn't want it to be super salty. That was a good call. That was the only change.

It was really good. We used canned corn instead of frozen and I had some left over onions and peppers (green and yellow) that we needed to use up so we threw it in. It ended up giving it a really nice look and we would probably do it again.
