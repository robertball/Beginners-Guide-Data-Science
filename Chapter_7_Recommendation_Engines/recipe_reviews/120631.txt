They tasted decent enough but the topping didn't look all that appealing.  I took it to a Christmas gathering and no one even tried it until I brought back it home.  Not a bad recipe but I wouldn't go out of of my way to make it again.

These are excellent brownies. Due to other peoples issues with getting the brownies out, I buttered my pan, laid wax paper, and buttered and floured the paper. As a result- I had absolutely no problem just sliding them out once they cooled. Very nice, easy, rich recipe.

I am excited to be the first to rate this recipe, with the five stars it deserves!  These are quite rich and the peppermint adds an interesting twist. I followed this recipe as written, except for the chocolate glaze on top -- instead of melting the chocolate with shortening, I just sprinkled the chocolate chips on the hot brownies and spread them once they melted. The only difficulty I had was in crushing the peppermints -- used a hammer and a plastic bag, which soon got holes in it and spread peppermint powder everywhere! I also felt these were best after being stored in the refrigerator overnight. Highly recommended.

These are FANTASTIC! My step-daughter & I made these with candy canes that were in her stocking from Santa. We took them to our family's new years gathering & they were a huge hit. THese will become an after Christmas staple @ our house. YUM! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

very good.  I added twice the peppermint to the batter, and used about 1/4 cup of peppermint on the top.  I used the advice of putting the chocolate chips on it right when it came out of the oven to melt, and it worked perfect (less mess too).  Thanks for the recipe!!

Great flavor, made the house smell wonderful.  Am I the only one that had a huge problem with the foil lining though?  I ended up throwing away half of these because they were impossible to get out of the foil.  Next time I will just make in a glass pan and cut out like any other brownie.

I was looking for a recipe so i could use up my left over candy canes and I came across these brownies.  I used 9 crushed candy canes for the recipe.  I followed most of the recipe with the exception of half splenda and half sugar. I also didnt have the ingredients for the glaze, so i mixed together confectioners sugar, a small amount of vanilla, cocoa powder and milk instead.  I have yet to try the brownies, but my house smelled delicious while they were baking! Ill update on the taste when i get around to trying it! so, i did try a small piece, and the brownies were good, nothing to die for.  They were very dense, so definitely make sure you have a glass of milk or water nearby!  i will most likely make these again if i have more candy canes to use next year.

Crazy how easy these were, and how quickly they went!  They did pull away from the pan some and the edges curled over a bit, but the were very good,nonetheless.

these were delicous!  I made 2 batches for a square-share, and the recipe was asked for again and again.
making some more today for a Christmas banquet this weekend..
now, if only to figure out how to crush those candies without destroying the bag?!

I don't know what happened to my brownies, but I'm a fairly experienced cook/baker, and these were the densest, brick-like brownies ever.The flavor was good, but they were so hard!

These brownies weren't very good. We think there is too much oil.

These brownies were awful. I followed the directions exactly, and they came out very gritty. My husband wouldn't even eat them, and he eats everything.

Very good, and quite easy to make. Based on other reviewers suggestions, I just put the chocolate on top as soon as they came out of the oven and spread it once it had melted a bit, then sprinkling it with the extra crushed peppermint candy. It was extremely easy that way and looked quite nice. I also used 1 cup of crushed peppermint candy in the brownies instead of just 3/4 cup, with whatever was left going on top. And rather than using foil, greasing it, etc, I baked these in a glass pan that I had greased well. They came out fine, and were enjoyed by all. They are a fudgy sort of brownie rather than a cakey one, but that's my preferred kind of brownie anyway. I will definitely be making these again!
