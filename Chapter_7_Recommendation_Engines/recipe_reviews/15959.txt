I made this for my son-in-law, and he ate 2 pieces. It is very, very good. I did add some candy kisses, about 1/2 cup, just because I had them left over from something else. Made it the perfect chocolate taste. Next time I may make my own graham cracker crust, just because.

This is a great recipe! I followed the recipe completely the first time I made it. After that, I added more marshmallows because the family/boyfriend likes it better with more marshmallows.
Also tried using dark chocolate bars instead of milk chocolate, and soy milk instead of regular milk/whipping cream (I am lactose intolerant) and it still came out pretty good.

I made this for Easter and it was a big hit with our guests.  The filling reminded me of a tasty chocolate mousse.  I thought it was easy to put together also.  I used a purchased graham cracker crust because I was making several other desserts but next time I will make a homemade crust.  It's really so much better.

I loved this pie. I made it for Thanksgiving this year. The only thing I did wrong was not watch when pouring it in the pie pan. It made more than my pie crust could hold. It didn't look that pretty due to this goof up, but otherwise it tasted fantastic!!! I will watch next time to make it look as good as it tasted.

This was surprisingly delicious and a big hit with my family. I had a bunch of marshmallows to use up and we were smored out, this fit the bill perfectly. I made my own crust and melted the chocolate differently then directed, I melted the marshmallows in the milk then removed the pot from the heat, added the chopped chocolate and stirred until melted and smooth, then folded in whipped cream as directed. I froze mine due to lack of fridge space.

This is one of my all time favorite pies, and I'm glad to see it on Allrecipes.com.  Over the years I have taken it to many functions and always receive requests for the recipe.  It is easy to prepare and sets up beautifully.

Everyone loved the pie. I would give it a 5 but it didn't set very well even when I left it in the freezer for a while. I am not American and don't love Hersheys so out of everyone I probably enjoyed it the least but everyone else LOVED it.

This pie was nice and easy. It was a little too sweet. I would try it again with a salted pretzel crust, or some fresh raspberries on top.

This pie was easier than pie to make, and it was DELICIOUS! If you're thinking of using just plain Hershey bars instead of the almond kind, I would recommend against it (unless you have an allergy, of course).  The little nutty pieces really add to the flavor.  I think this pie would also be good frozen, but it was thick and substantial, even just refrigerated.  Will definitely make again!

My daughter brought this pie to our 4th celebration and it was absolutely delicious.  She used the chocolate bars without the almonds since not everyone likes nuts.  We served it right from the frig, but after she left we put the remaining pie into the freezer. Of course I had to try it again, and I LOVED IT FROM THE FREEZER. This is a keeper.

Very Yummy!  I used chocolate bars without nuts, because that is my preference.

This is my favorite pie in the world. My great grandmother used to make it at Christmas time. the only difference is, she used plain candy bars and she made a coconut crust. AMAZING!!!!

I made this as one of my Easter desserts and it was a huge hit with the chocolate lovers at the table.  My grandson practically inhaled his piece, while his father had two large pieces and then took the rest of the pie home.  I didn't have a taste but still give it a five rating just for the praise I got.  Thanks.

excellent chocolate pie recipe and easy to make.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips for the chocolate and it was very good.  i usually prefer dark chocolate, but since i put it in an Oreo pie crust, milk chocolate would have been good, too--it was very chocolaty and yummy.  I'll use this recipe for my chocolate pies from now on.
