Where in the world does one find a cherry cake mix? I went to numerous grocery stores with no luck. So I made the recipe with a yellow cake mix and that worked fine. I might cut back a little on the sugar and pecan topping as there was an excess that just fell off.

I'm sorry, but this was SO disappointing.  It sounded so good and I was so excited about making it, but the final result was bland and a mix of flavors that just didn't blend well.  The cinnamon and pecan topping didn't blend at all with the fruity flavor of the cake and the chocolate chips scattered throughout were horrible.  It was a cake that couldn't make up its mind on what it should taste like.  It was neither fruity enough to be a fruit cake nor chocolaty enough to be a chocolate cake.  Won't be making this one again.

Very good, everyone I served it to loved it. It tastes like a chocolate covered cherry.

It was an easy recipe to make, but tasted sorta dry and still like a boxed cake mix.
