This was a culinary adventure.  And the result was very tasty.  Here is what I did:  I used 5 New Mexico Chiles and 5 California chiles because I was afraid of the heat.  Be sure to wear gloves while working with the chiles and don't touch your face.  I could not find plain mango juice, and I did not feel like making my own, so I used mango nectar.  (Nicola--was this a deal breaker?)  Then I pretty much followed the recipe as written.  I must say that after the week was over, the onions were pretty pungent.  I ended up with a little over 1 quart of sauce.  Slathered it on pork ribs and they were very good.  I still had plenty left over and I poured the remainder into ice cube trays and froze.  I could not tell any difference between, say day 3 and day 7 in the refrigerator, so if I make this again, I might just let the mixture sit in the refrigerator for less time.
