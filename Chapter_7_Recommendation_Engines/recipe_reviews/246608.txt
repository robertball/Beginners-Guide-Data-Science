The donuts tasted so good!!! I made them for a super bowl party, hence the green sprinkles. GO, Eagles, GO. I didn't add any pineapple, because I didn't have any, but they still tasted amazing, and so did the dip, which I used as icing

I added a couple cups of flour, once I was able to roll it out I cut with a regular doughnut cutter and fried them up. Dropped them into cinnamon and sugar, I  thinned the cream cheese dip with milk , drizzled it over the doughnuts. The family loved them,  I will make them again.

We L-O-V-E carrot cake at our house so thought this would be a nice change up.  A little too sweet for me but my husband couldn't get enough.  Definitely will make them again when we have family/friends together.

yes yes and yes. I made these for my anniversary dessert. it made so many I gave some to family and now I am making them for all events. my family isn't shy to indulge a little and I think the dipping sauce should be doubled. but that's us. I will try doing half the batch without the sugar cinnamon coating we will see. but a must for family gathering.

Made no changes to the recipe - came out fantastic. I mixed it all up and my husband fried them for me. Thanks for the delicious recipe!
