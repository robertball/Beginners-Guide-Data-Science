Good recipe--how smart your mom must have been to add all those veggies to this recipe. Oh yes it was pretty darned easy to prepare.

I quadrupled the recipe and made it for my Super Bowl party. It was a big hit with everyone. Being in southern Louisiana the store didn't have chicken gumbo soup. I made my own with a gumbo recipe and tweaked it a little by adding chicken broth concentrate with a light roux. Best sloppy joes I've had in a decade. Good job!

These sloppy joes got rave reviews from my family! The best we've ever had. I did add a lot more chili sauce than the recipe calls for.

I'm keeping this recipe. It's very close to a couple that I've made and one that my mom used to make. 
For those who don't know, chicken gumbo soup is typically put out by Campbell Soups and is condensed, like tomato soup.
Chilli sauce IS NOT canned chilli. It's a condiment like ketchup. You can either make it or buy it. 
Seriously folks. I live in the woods and I can find these ingredients!  
I think I'll make it soon and will most likely give it 5 stars.

It was good. A little confused about "chili sauce", I used sarachi hot sauce, I know assume you meant actual canned chili.
