This is the most amazing and delicious quiche I've ever made, and I've made a ton of quiche.  The only thing I changed was subbed Greek yogurt for the sour cream, and included a chopped onions with the mushroom, omitted the onion powder, and added a tablespoon of ground mustard.  A winner and a keeper for sure!!  Thanks for sharing.

This is ALMOST a real 5 star recipe, quite unlike any crustless quiche I've ever made. I followed the recipe exactly, because I think it is unfair to rate a recipe that has been modified. It is delicious as it stands - the texture is so smooth and it is very, very rich. The directions are easy to follow, and it is uncomplicated to make. There were three of us at dinner, and I divided it into fourths, but it would easily serve six, as none of us could completely finish our portions. My husband commented that it could be more colorful, so I think I'll add some diced sweet red pepper to the mushrooms next time I make it. I might also use diced onion and garlic, as some reviewers have suggested. Also, it took mine a full hour in the oven to be ready to eat. Thanks for the great recipe; we all agreed that I should make it again, soon.

Awesome.  I was fridge-raiding to use up my overstock of eggs, but didn't have all the ingredients, so I used different cheese (mozzarella and a basil/tomato white cheddar mixed) and threw in a little Sopressa for kicks and this quiche turned out better than most I've purchased at bistros.  
I highly recommend trying this out and/or adding your own twist.  It was easy to prepare before baking as well, which is important to me.

This is FABULOUS! I'm always looking for lower/no carb breakfast casseroles & quiche's & this is perfect! I didn't use the heavy cream(not sure why it's needed) & baked it in my small 10x7 cake pan, checked it at 35 min. & it was done perfectly. When I've made crustless quiche's in the past, they tend to puff while baking & fall while cooling. Not the case with this one. Absolutely LOVE this!

This was delicious and easy! I subbed greek yogurt for the sour cream, used fresh spinach instead, and added some extra spices instead of using hot sauce. The sourness of the greek yogurt had me a bit concerned, so I sprinkled just a few dashes of sugar in, too. Like previous commenters, I sauteed the mushrooms with minced garlic. I also used pecorino instead of parmesan because it was what I had on hand. Thanks very much!

My husband and I thought this was delicious! It was certainly easy. None of my kids would try it however, but I don't know why.

This quiche was great! I substituted half a chopped onion and 2 minced garlic cloves for the onion and garlic powder and just sauteed with the mushrooms. It had tons of flavor this way! I also did not have cheddar on hand, but had monterey jack so I just used that. Still great! Will try with cheddar next time.

Fantastic. I made it lower in fat and was still blown away. Omitted cream, used fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream and only had a can of mushrooms so fried them up with fresh spinach and red peppers using only Pam spray. Next time I don't think I will even use all the cheddar called for. Best quiche I ever made. You will not miss the crust.

Incredibly delicious, easy to make, and healthy too! Very little prep time involved as using a blender to make the egg mixture speeds up the process - - pop it in the oven and go about doing other tasks. Made changes based on suggestions by some reviewers as well as an aim to reduce the fat content and pack this already healthy quiche with more vegetables. Instead of 2 cups sour cream, used 1-1/4 cups sour cream and 3/4 cup nonfat Greek yogurt (6 oz. tub) based on several reviewers feeling it was a tad sour tasting. Added 1/4 red bell pepper, 1 large carrot, 1/4 Vidalia onion, 2 cloves garlic, and the entire (10 ounce) package frozen spinach. Left the egg mixture pretty much as is except for adding 1 more egg and subbing almond milk for the heavy whipping cream. Used a 9" deep dish ceramic pie baker, and the dish was filled perfectly. Took 50 minutes to bake given the extra ingredients which were added. The only change next time would be to adjust the seasonings a little for our personal preferences and be a bit more liberal with the hot sauce. Thank you for sharing, hrgdane, and this recipe is destined to be a winner on this site.

I made it as written, and while edible, I found it a little too sour (as in sour cream).  I used low fat sour cream, so perhaps if I had used regular sour cream it would have been better.

I've made this recipe a number of times, my family LOVES it! The quiche comes out so light and fluffy, it's fantastic. I make a double batch because everyone wants leftovers for breakfast LOL. I change up the filler ingredients depending on what we have on hand. Example: broccoli, bacon, spinach, cherry tomatoes, onions, different cheeses, etc. BUT, I never change the base recipe...it is perfect (in my opinion). Just about anything you would throw into an omelet works well in this recipe.

I tried this recipe today for brunch guests.  I read some of the comments and made a couple of adjustments to the recipe.  Used fresh garlic, onions, and a little red pepper saut√©ed along with a couple different kinds of mushrooms.  It really turned out great, everyone loved it.  They particularly like that it was just vegetables in the quiche.  Appreciate the recipe and input from others.  It was easy and delicious, a great combination.

This recipe is amazing!  My husband said it was the best quiche he has EVER had!  I'm sure it's awesome as written, but on some suggestions from the other reviewers I added one large shallot and 2 large cloves of crushed garlic in with the mushrooms. I still added the onion powder, but just a little.  I also added a little ground mustard as well.  I cooked up about 1/2 lb of bacon, chopped it up and threw that in there too.  I used a mix of mozz and mild cheddar cheese.  I also sprinkled just a little cheese on top and it made it soooo golden brown and pretty.  This will be my new go to quiche recipe for sure!

I have just finished preparing this quiche. I had to substitute powdered onion and garlic for fresh. Also I used fresh spinach and peppercorn cheddar. I used creame fresh instead of 2% sour cream and 2 tbls of half n half. WOW! More prep but came away with a wonderful taste.

I bet it's awesome as is, but I had to alter...only added 1c sour cream (all I had) and about a quarter cup half n half, didn't have spinach either but added green onion.  Sauteed mushrooms in a bit of truffle oil with the butter.  Also, mine cooked at 350 for 35 minutes, then I shut oven off and continued to cook for another 12 minutes...perfect :) I really liked it :)  Thank you for submitting a very nice recipe!

I loved this Quiche so much that when my husband walked in the door I placed a large bite of it in his mouth. He loved it! Small change I made was diced and fried 1 lb. of bacon an added. Also used (9) 6" round paper bakeware,baked for 33 minutes, cooled, and froze for the RV trip.

Huge hit!! I used plain nonfat greek yogurt instead of sour cream, added an extra egg, and used grated carrots and spinach as the filling.

The first time, I made it per the recipe .   My wife and I loved it.  The second time, I used aged sharp cheddar (Old Crock) and I used fresh spinach instead of frozen and substituted gluten free flour for the all purpose flour.  My family absolutely loved it  . My daughter said I could give one of the best restaurants in town a run for their money with this recipe.  The next time I make it, I intend to substitute fresh broccoli (fresh, steamed,  finely chopped) or asparagus (cooked, fresh finely chopped) in place of the spinach.  Future changes may include cutting back on the mushrooms and adding bacon or sausage.   The is an excellent base for all sorts of creative variations.  At some point in time, I may make a version of this with gluten free crust.

Fantastic! 
I made a double batch as follows:
First batch: instead of onion and garlic powder I sauteed 1/4 of a huge sweet onion (sliced) and real garlic (pressed) before adding to the cheese mixture with the mushrooms and spinach. I used half yogurt (6% fat) and half sour cream (14% fat) because that's what I had on hand.
Second batch: again, instead of onion and garlic powder I sauteed an onion (3/4 of a huge sweet onion, sliced) and real garlic. I also cooked 4 slices of bacon which I then crumbled / sliced into the cheese mixture with the onions. I used gruyere instead of cheddar in this combination.
I prepped the cheese mixtures and add-ins separately the night before and refrigerated everything in tupperwares. The next morning I added the eggs, mixed with my immersion blender, added the add-ins, and baked in pyrex dishes sprayed with vegetable oil cooking spray. Worked perfectly! The meat one, which was a bit smaller (8"square) cooked in about 40 minutes, the veggie one (8x10?) took about an hour. Both came out of the dish without any problem.
A BRILLIANT recipe - and great for the gluten-free crowd - will do again and again!

Added onions in with the mushrooms and used fresh spinach wilted with the mush/onions.  Used greek yogurt instead of sc, but only because i had it on hand.  Amazing consistency and flavor.  Everyone loved it!!!

I made this Christmas morning, we had a vegetarian join us. Everyone loved it. I use a blend of cheese because I didn't have 2 cups cheddar and I was to use all the cheese that I had left over ( cheddar, mozzarella and Parmesan). I think cooked bacon or ham would work well.

Wonderful.  Substituted non-fat greek yogurt for thr dour dream, added fresh chopped onion, gsrlic and chopped red peppers to the mushrooms in the third step.  Needed a bigger fish since also used entire package of spinach.   Bery easy to make and very filling.  Will make it again.

I wasn't thrilled with the texture of this quiche, I'm assuming it was the large amount of sour cream and cheese.

This is the easiest recipe and tastes delicious! I made it exactly as the recipe is written with one exception I didn‚Äôt have onion powder so I saut√©ed some onion with the mushrooms instead and I‚Äôm so happy with it! I will be using it quite often and trying other ingredients like chicken, ham, bacon and tomatoes in it as well. Great for low carb diet!  (Note to self - I could go with a little less garlic but that‚Äôs just me)

Wonderful recipe.  I used full fat sour cream and half & half instead of heavy cream because I had both ingredients on hand.  Otherwise followed recipe.  It was wonderful and reminded me of Panera's quiche.   This is a great base so I'm going to cut the recipe down and try it in puff pastry to see if I can get closer to Panera style.   Either way, I will make this many times over in the future.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Very good quiche! I halved it and used a 1.5 qt baking dish. In place of the sour cream, I used plain Greek yogurt, adding a few pinches of sugar in case of a sour taste. I added about 1/4 c red bell pepper (for a little color, as others also stated), sauteeing for 3 min, before adding the mushrooms. I used fresh spinach and went with the Mexican blend cheese that I had already opened and a few shakes of ground mustard powder. I checked at 40 min and it was done. I'd test it 5 min earlier than that the next time. Nice recipe!

baked it in cast iron skillet cause it would not fit in pie plate.  Next  time will bake at 325 degrees for 45 min.  I used steak cut up real small instead of mushrooms (don't care for rooms) and a big bag of fresh spinach saut√©ed in butter reduced down to almost nothing then added meat and egg mixture. Yum! Very good recipe that can be used to clean out the frig if you need to....which I did add a few things like little leftover cheeses and a couple more eggs....but basically stuck with the main ingredients.

Creamy and tasty. Substitutions: 1C ham for mushrooms and butter, 1 C sour cream + 1/2 C half-and-half for 2C sour cream and only 1 C cheese. Neighbor loved it. Needed a smaller pie plate.

Delicious!  I made it exactly by the recipe which is rare for me. I have made another quiche for years and it has two crusts on it so very heavy. This is very filling because of the cheese and sour cream, but it is hard to stop eating because it seems light. The seasonings were good for us, but I could see adding other interesting seasonings to taste. New one for our rotation--thanks! (sorry I just realized I used regular sour cream not lowfat)

Hubby says best quiche ever, and this is coming from a meat and potatoes guy. Very fluffy out of the oven. Sauteed 2 cloves of garlic with the mushrooms in lieu of garlic powder and threw in some feta. Delicious!

Didn‚Äôt have mushrooms.  Cut ingredients in half.  (3 eggs & combo of sour cream/yogurt.)  Saut√©ed 1/2 onion in  butter, then steamed 5 oz fresh spinach on top of that & added that w/liquid ingredients to blender.  Poured back into the small saut√© pan I was using & added grated cheese & baked. Best quiche I‚Äôve made so far.

I thought this was yummy; my husband thought it was just okay. Changes I made: fresh spinach (chopped in food processor) instead of frozen, a garlic clove instead of powder, full-fat sour cream--and I left out the tablespoon of whipping cream. I made this in a food processor--BIG MISTAKE--that I had out from chopping the spinach. Next time, I will use grated cheddar or grate it first, and, if I use the food processor again, only put half the liquid in it. Messy! 

This was extremely cheddary; I think less cheese would have been fine. In my oven, it took an extra ten minutes, plus I gave it five minutes to cool. Very pretty. And tasty. And fattening. Sigh. I think, with a salad, it would serve four easily for supper.

I'm keeping this one! Thanks!

This was good and easy (as promised).  I didn't add the cheddar cheese to the first one and only added a cup (instead of two) to the second batch.  Served it with a side salad of spring greens, cucumber, fresh mango, and avocado.  The mango and cucumber really helped to balance the heavy, rich flavor of the quiche.

Too much cheese for my taste.   I must have done something wrong, mine ended up very flat.  I'm wondering if it would've helped if I'd used my convection setting??

Very easy and very good! I did make a few minor edits, ONLY because I thought I had all the ingredients when I started cooking the mushrooms and quickly found out that wasn't the case so I had to improvise on the spot. Didn't have onion powder so added about a quarter cup diced onion instead and increased garlic salt and regular salt to 1/2 tsp each; used fresh spinach vs frozen and cooked it with the mushrooms; only had 1/2 cup sour cream (didn't realize the family ate so much of it over the holiday!) so added 1/2 cup of skim milk for 1c total (didn't want end result to be to runny so I stuck with that); and, used sharp cheddar vs regular cheddar. JUST fit in my 9" pie plate and was golden brown and perfect consistency after 30 minutes of baking. End result was slightly salty but fabulous nonetheless, so will definitely leave the salts as they were next time. Made it for dinner and cannot wait to have the leftovers for breakfast!  Also, sorry, I normally don't leave a review if I've made edits as I don't think that's fair, but I think this recipe would've been wonderful as originally written so I decided to.

I made this for my husband who was super skeptical but he loved it! As did my guests. I was able to substitute the spinach and mushrooms with ingredients I had on hand as well and it came out beautifully.

I saut√©ed mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers and added diced ham.  With the additional ingredients, I increased the eggs to six.  Everyone really liked it.

this turned out super yummy and was easy to make! i did not have heavy cream so i eliminated it, but i don't think it made a difference. i used fresh spinach, cooked it down in butter with the mushrooms. also i used 1/2 cup mozzarella and reduced the cheddar cheese to 1 1/2 cups.

Amazing! Kept the Parmesan as is and for the remains cheese used: 8 ounces Mascarpone cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheeses and 1/2 cup Mexican cheese blend. Creamy, yet firm. Very flavorful. Added dried oregano to taste.

I thought this was really good.  I think it would have been great as suggested...I did make changes as I was trying to feed a hungry 15 year old.  Added ham, onions, garlic to the mushrooms.  Also added a couple more eggs and baked it in a large skillet.  Great flavor.

It's my family's favorite!  They ask me to make this all the time. I make it like the recipe states, only adding fresh garlic when I cook the mushrooms in my iron skillet. I've also tried it with various veggies, red peppers, onions, etc. wonderful breakfast!!!!
