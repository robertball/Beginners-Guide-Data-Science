Really simple recipe with surprisingly good flavours. I followed the suggestion and doubled the spices but didn't change anything else. 
I was worried that it wouldn't have much flavour as the smell wasn't that strong, and before it finished cooking it was a little on the bland side. I resisted the urge to add more spices and it proved to be the right decision. 

Thanks for the great recipe.

This was tastier than I imagined it would be. My husband, who is a meat lover, actually enjoyed it. Of couse he said he thought it would be great with beef stew meat. :) I think lamb would be a good choice. We did eat this meatless, but I did sprinkle a small bit of good fresh goat cheese on top. Yum.   The house smelled wonderful while cooking this. I would suggest cutting the potatoes rather small so that they get nice and soft. I cut mine in larger cubes and had to cook this an additional 45 minutes and they were still rather hard.  Overall, this was good, and the hubby requests it again.

This recipe was a great base for a warming vegetarian stew!  I decreased the garlic by half, used about 1.5 inches of fresh garlic, and increased the tumeric and cloves.  It made a GREAT sauce :)  I also added some pumpkin in place of about half the potatoes and ate it with brown basmati rice.  I think a squirt of lime juice at the end would've be a nice touch... if I had a lime ;)  This seems to be one of those things that gets better the longer you cooked it... i cooked mine for a little over an hour.  So good!  Thanks for posting it!

It was REALLY garlicky but very very good. I cut back on the oil (1/4 of a cup??) and the cloves, used ground fenugreek instead of seeds, and I added maybe 2/3 of a can of chicken broth as it was getting rather dry. We ate it with paratha. I think I'll add a handful of peas next time. Thanks, alemana!

Excellent!  I did not add the cabbage, but added beef cubes.  I cooked it in the crockpot.

I made this to try to impress the little Ethiopian girl I tutor. She did like it but said it is not Ethiopian food. I later attended a class hosted by the Ethiopian adoption support group in our area and learned to make some very good Ethiopian food. It is traditional to use a lot of garlic, onion and tomato paste. You also need a special spice that is only available from Ethiopia but a good substitute is called Spicy Salt available at some ethnic specialty shops.

Very tasty, but not hot, so my one-year-old loved it!  My husband also requested to have it again.  For the veggies, I used 1 onion, 1 bowl of Trader Joe's chopped stir-fry veggies, and 2 cups diced tomatoes rather than tomato puree.  I used Trader Joe's mixed bean medley rather than potatoes.  I served it on top of whole wheat couscous, made with butter and veggie broth.

Very yummy. I did not use cabbage or carrots, but used 3 potatoes, 1/2 cup lentils, and 2 chickens breasts.

We all liked this. My kids - 10 and 12 - were able to help prepare it, which is always good. I added lentils, skipped the fenugreek (b/c it wasn't on hand), and used sauce instead of puree. We like things on the spice side, so I would probably add more garlic next time. I was actually wondering if raisins would be interesting to add for the last few minutes. In any case, we will make it again and try different variations. I like the idea of lime juice and will probably try that. Thanks!

I really enjoyed this Ethiopian-inspired dish.  It happened to have everything I was trying to use from my winter CSA and it made for a savory dish that smelled amazing...the cloves really make for a treat.  I halved the garlic and used fresh turmeric, ginger, and veggie stock.  I like serving it over brown rice or bulgar since i don't tend to have injera on hand.

This was a good simple meal.  Mine came out a lot like Japanese curry and was especially good when I ate it over rice.  I agree that meat would be delicious in this meal but anyone should be able to add meat to this if they wanted without a problem.  I rather like eating vegetarian meals most of the time anyway.

I made a big skillet of this last night- delicious! I look forward to having to to eat for a couple of days. I did make a couple of modifications. As others have mentioned, I upped the turmeric and significantly reduced the ginger. I also added around half a teaspoon of cayenne to give it a little kick. Where it calls for tomato puree and water, I tossed two large tomatoes and some vegetable broth into a blender. I added the cabbage separately, closer to the end, since I wanted it to retain a little more texture and flavor. Finally, I added about a cup of frozen green peas. The peas were really the main change, I just like them in this kind of dish!

Delicious. I used a different ratio of vegetables, since I was working with leftover produce (half the potatoes, twice the cabbage). I kept the spice portions the same, except I only used 6 cloves of garlic. I didn't have cloves, but I did have Chinese 5-spice, which worked just as well.

Pleasant and filling. I didn't have all the garlic that the recipe called for, and not exactly tomato sauce (used italian) so that might have changed the flavors a bit...I'll make this again and update =)

Very tasty. Replaced the carrots and cabbage with okra, kale and broccoli from the garden. Served with doro wat, mesir wat and home made injera. A fair amount of effort but a smorgasbord of flavors, loved by all.

This was really tasty and filling - my only recommendation would be to make this in a big stock pot rather than a skillet, since it makes a TON. I couldn't find fenugreek seeds so I researched online and subbed in a tsp of mustard seed and a tiny, tiny amount of maple syrup, but other than that I made no changes.

this is a tasty, easy to prepare dish of whole vegetables with plenty of seasonings, that goes well with rice or quinoa, and especially yummy with Injera, an Ethiopian flatbread recipe that is also very simple to prepare. 

I make it without the oil, toasting the seasonings dry before adding wet ingredients. This takes the calorie count down, so i can feel good about eating it whenever I want. 

It tastes good fresh out of the pot, and is even better the next day. This recipe will be in my top ten, for sure. One I will make again and again.

Just made it pretty much as written but used ground fenugreek instead of fenugreek seeds. After adding all vegetables I cooked it for like 15 minutes before adding the liquids, because it seemed like it was best to do this to "cook down" the vegetable bulk a bit. In fact, it was hard to fit all this into the largest pot I had available, so halving the recipe might be a good move for some kitchens. Results were pretty good, I was pleased and my husband even ate it.

A delicious option for serving vegetarian friends. Next time I'll try adding chopped chicken; it just seems right for it!
