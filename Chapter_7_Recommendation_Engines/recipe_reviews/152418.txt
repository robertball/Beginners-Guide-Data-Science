Almost perfect!  I took the advice of a few reviewers below and decided to substitute 1T Brown Sugar for the white sugar when caramelizing.  Used 1T butter instead of olive oil (not as healthy, but added A LOT more flavor and made the caramelization process more accurate).  Instead of plopping everything into the pan together, I melted the butter, added both sugars and heated on medium-high till the sugars just barely started to caramelize.  Then added the seeds and toasted, stirring regularly till they started to brown slightly and pop (about 5-min depending on temp under the pan).  Added the coated seeds to a pan with the sugar/spice mixture and voila!  Yummy, yummy!  Even my fianc√©e, who doesn't like pumpkin seeds, likes these!

This recipe was great the only thing I added brown sugar to caramelize the seeds was a huge hit. They were gone in minutes!!!

Completely addictive.  The only thing I changed was to add a pinch of nutmeg.  These are indeed very sweet, which suited me just fine, but if I were serving to more sophisticated palates, I would take the advice of those who recommend scaling back the sugar by a tablespoon.

For as long as I can remember my Mom has cooked pumpkin seeds for us after carving pumpkins with the same old recipe. Now being on my own I decided to try a different recipe & this turned out great! I added my own variations like a tsp of garlic salt instead of just plain salt when toasting and I added extra cinnamon in place of the ginger and extra cayenne pepper and these turned out great. Even my boyfriend who never liked pumpkin seeds was surprised! I think this will be my new recipe for years to come.

These were a little too sweet for me.  Next time I would cut the sugar down to 2 Tablespoons.  The kids loved them just they way the recipe is written though.

These were super good!  I used 1 tsp of cayenne pepper instead of a pinch because I like a little heat.  I also added a sprinkle of all spice and nutmeg for personal taste but I'm sure they would still be delicious without.

I just made these with our leftover jack'o'lantern seeds (2 large pumpkins). Delicious! I added a little fresh nutmeg to the spice mix. Thanks!

I can't even imagine why this doesn't have a full 5 stars.  These are amazing, so amazing that I don't even want regular salted ones anymore.  My kids love these, and although I made it exactly as per directions... I can see how this is easily customizable to your liking, for instance, I think I want a little more cayenne next time.  I love these, and when we run out I'm going to be sad to have to wait until next Halloween to have access to pumpkins again. :)

These are a yummy snack. (Made after Mrs. Sigg's Fresh Pumpkin Pie.) Sweet with a spicy kick. A nice change from regular salted or garlic roasted.
Edited to 5 stars. These are good!
* I've made these using different types of squash seeds. I wish I could just buy seeds, that's how yummy these are.

These were a great deviation of traditional pumpkin seeds. I used brown sugar to caramelize, upped the cayenne, added nutmeg, and a dash of cloves. Boyfriend liked them, though he insists you aren't suppose to eat the shells.

Awesome recipe...  I might eat them all before anyone else can see them!  I added two pinches of cayenne pepper instead of one for extra spice - came out great.  Thanks!

Four stars only because I use 2 T sugar in the spice mixture instead of 3--but these are SO ADDICTIVE! I brought a huge container to a Thanksgiving potluck this year, and they were completely gone by the time I left. Such a cool way to prepare pumpkin seeds.

I tossed the seeds with butter because I was out of cooking spray and a little salt and garlic powder.  I added a little extra cinnamon to the spice mixture, added nutmeg and substituted cayenne with mexican chile powder because that was all I had.  I carmelized butter and brown sugar together before adding the seeds.  It came out great! :)

YUM! These are the best pumpkin seeds I've ever had (& I've been making the seeds for many years). They're sweet w/ just a little bite from the cayenne. A great combo of flavors. My new favorite! I didn't change a thing. Thanks Theresa :-)

It tried this recipe as written, down to the end where you stir the seeds into the seasonings. I tasted them, and decided to add more cayenne to make them spicier. So much better with more cayenne if you like hotter/spicier stuff. I think I will cut the sugar down a little bit next time so they won't be as sweet. Chili powder would probably be good to use instead of the cayenne, too.

These were delicious! Definitely NOT bland. I substituted the cayenne for 1/4 chili powder and used butter instead of oil. Other than that followed the recipe exactly. We LOVED them!

These seeds turned out great and tasted really awesome. I am not sure exactly how much a pinch is, but I like spicy food so I had more cayenne pepper.

Loved it! Changed it a little, after tossing seeds in the sugar mixture I threw it all back in the pan to caramelize a bit more.

These are great!  I usually use less sugar, and sometimes butter instea of oil.  I just do them in one step.  throw all the ingredients together, spread them out on foil in a pan, and roast.  when they come out of the oven, I let them cool for a few minutes and then break them up.

Oh my goodness!! These are so much better than your basic roasted and salted pumpkin seeds! Totally addictive! I don't think my sugar melted quite right (the seeds aren't caramelized at all) but they still taste great and turned out awesome.

This recipe has an excellent mix of sweet and spicy flavors.  I was afraid to try it, because of the cumin and ginger (even though I like these flavors).  You could not taste any one ingredient.  It is the perfect blend.  I only used 1 cup of seed for this recipe and cooked the seed for 30 minutes on 275 degrees.  They turned out great!

I look forward to making these every year after carving pumpkins!  I used 3 tbsp of sugar to carmelize instead of 2.   Dont try to carmelize more than 2 cups of seeds at a time or you will end up burning the seeds trying to get all the sugar to carmelize.

i did like the other reviewers and used brown sugar instead of regular. I also added butter to the pan after finding the sugar wouldn't really dissolve. this was the first time I've made pumpkin seeds and i have to say my daughter and i loved it!! but my husband didn't.  just a matter of personal preference, and i think it was the cumin, so maybe i would omit that next time. still, these were worth the extra effort. i will never throw away my pumpkin seeds again!!

So yummy!  After reading the reviews, I added a few shakes of nutmeg, just under 1/4 tsp cayenne & subbed 1 tbs brown sugar in 1 tbs butter for the caramelizing.  Delicious!  These are going to become an annual staple in our house!

I don't even bother with oven roasting anymore.  I always end up with more burnt than roasted.
just for fun I tried the microwave and lo and behold they turned out nice and dry and crispy without having to sit in front of the oven watching them to make sure they didn't burn.  I use a microwave safe plate, and it works great.

I need an answer, please, to my question.  I assume the seeds still have the shell on them and are not the inner meat alone?  Or do I spend time removing the shell for only the nut meat that is inside?  Thank you to all who will answer.  I need help!  I rated this without trying the recipe because it would not accept my question without my doing a rating.  But I have not made the recipe until I truly find out if the husky part is edible for children and adults when they chew into them.  Thank you.

These had a very good combination of flavors and came out pretty good, but think it could have used a little butter or moisture to hold the sugar/seasoning better.  Will make them again with modifications suggested including brown sugar.   Thoroughly enjoyed the sweetness compared to the usual salt flavor.  Thanks for this rec!

I thought they were okay. Not as carmalized as I expected. I even through them back in the pan to get a more carmalized result and it did not work well.

I found it hard to caramelize the pumpkin seeds which was frustrating as I don't think they quite turned out how they were supposed to. Also I would have added a touch more "heat" to my seeds if I were to try these again.

The taste was odd. I thought the ingredients sounded like a strange combination, but I decided to try it because of the *enthusiastic* positive reviews. 

If I ever tried this recipe again, I'd certainly delete the cumin, which added nothing good and made it smell weird - like cumin!

This is a home run recipe! The only thing I would suggest based on the fact I only had 1/2 of a cup of Pumpkin seeds to start with, is to use this recipe for every 1/2 cup instead of 2 cups. I used the exact measurements from above but with only 1/2 cup of seeds and it was absolutely perfect! My boyfriend and I couldn't set them down! Thank you for sharing this recipe with us. We will for sure make them again. :)

So this is my first time ever making pumpkin seeds. Also my first time ever caramelizing anything. So I saw that a lot of you liked it better with brown sugar so I gave that a try but I guess brown sugar doesn't melt down as fast as white sugar does because I cooked it for almost ten minutes and it just wouldn't melt. So next time instead of putting the pumpkin seeds in with the brown sugar to melt I will cook down the sugar then put in the pumpkin seeds. Other than this they are awesome Just like candy but better!

Very good! I don't usually have much luck with pumpkin seeds, but these were tasty. Much more sweet than spicy or savory, but they have a little kick at the end. Yum!

Just made these and they are amazing! Will never make pumpkin seeds another way! Sweet, spicy and full of all sorts of flavour!  I followed the recipe exactly, but followed some suggestions in the comments...used 2 TBSP of sugar instead of 3 (perfect sweetness), used salted butter instead of olive oil, added 1/4 nutmeg and I like a bit of heat so I used 1/2tsp cayenne and it was just right to have some spiciness but not overpowering!  Going out to buy more pumpkins just to make more!!

Amazing! The perfect amount of sweetness and kick, and the whole  family loved it. I followed the recipe exactly, just using peanut oil instead of olive, because i didn't have any left. i also added a pinch of nutmeg. Fabulous recipe!

Yum! I "hate" plain old pumpkin seeds but these are awesome. I didn't quite follow the directions...I melted the butter and brown sugar, added the spices and then the seeds and roasted them for about 20 mins. Then I spread them on aluminum foil (didn't have any parchment paper) and sprinkled them with white sugar. They are crunchy, caramelly goodness. Thanks!

Wow! My sons like roasted pumpkin seeds a little, my husband not at all. We never did this in my house growing up so I like to do it now. I love that it's sort of healthy. I've always just done the salted and seasoned kind...never any with sugar. These came out great. The flavor is very good. I got my sugar carmalizing in a little butter before adding the seeds, tossed them in the spices, threw it back in the warm oven for just a minute (to see if I could make them crunchier) and let the boys try them. I'm buying another pumpkin today so I can try to get the seeds a bit crunchier but the taste is great.

These were alright. The taste was good but I wasn't impressed with the process, there are much easier ways of doing this.

Wow these are great!  I want to carve another pumpkin so I can make them again!  I was skeptical about the cumin, but don't skip it--it added depth and complexity of flavor.  I also doubled the cayenne because I love spicy stuff.  This one is a keeper!!

This recipe is AH-MAZING, I did not have any cayene pepper, but I had some "Cocoa and Chile" spice {that I had never used!} and replaced it with that just so I'd have some form of "kick" to it, it was awesome! I did use the tips other people wrote here about replacing the oil with butter {I can't believe it's not butter worked great} and replaced the last of the sugar with brown sugar, the seeds, I left in the oven for about 35 minutes, I think I had more seeds than the recipe calls for, but this turned out just amzing, can't wait to make them again!

Reduced sugar to 2T, added 1/4t cardamom, and increased the cayenne in the spice mix. Used brown sugar to carmelize as suggested by a reviewer - these were awesome - definately a keeper!!

Have always liked pumpkin seeds and this is one of the best recipes.  I did increase the cayenne to 1/4 tsp since I do like things spicier but will increase it still more, probably to 1/2 tsp.  I am going to half the cumin also.  I did roast the seeds in oven for an additional 10 minutes too since I like my seeds crisper. Thanks for a great recipe!

Was pleasantly surprised how well these flavors combined. I did add extra cayenne pepper to taste to give them some kick, otherwise followed the recipe exactly. I particularly enjoyed the carmelization.

Yummy! I did fine the cumin to be overwhelming, so next time I'll definitely either add just a pinch or eliminate it. I also added more cinnamon just because I like it. Thanks!

Really tasty pumpkin seeds.  Very chewy, if you want them crunchy I'd leave them in the over for 30 minutes more at least.

I just made these tonight and cannot express how positively delicious and addicting they are! Amazing. The sweet and spicy flavours go so well together. I did everything as written, except I did not have ground ginger, so I used a bit of ground nutmeg instead. Fantastic!!!!!!!

Yummy.  These are by far more "sweet" than spicy.  The sugar coating at the end overpowers the spices used.  If you want super spice, add more cumin or cayenne.  I used enough spices for 2 cups of pumpkin seeds but only used 1 cups of seeds to ensure they were all fully coated.

SO GOOD! I also added nutmeg and forgot the ginger (will use it next time) but it was still super good. I think almonds would be really good this way too. Or cashews, maybe any kind of nut...

I made these and they turned out great! I was a little apprehensive when I read some of the previous reviews so I made few changes and was very pleased with the results.  I used a homemade pumpkin pie spice instead of straight cinnamon and I baked them each stage for 10 minutes. They came out like honey roasted peanuts except they were pumpkin seeds. Excellent!

What am I missing in the directions that no other reviewer has mentioned????  I've read it over a few times now.  The recipe states to mix together the initial 3 TB. sugar & other spices and set aside.  Next,  spray seeds with cooking spray, sprinkle with salt & bake.  Then, add olive oil to pan with the  final 2 TB. of sugar, add seeds, & stir until sugar melts & coats the seeds.  Right?  So, my question is......when do you add the sugar and spice mixture to the seeds?  Before you bake them?   Can I just carmelize the sugar and spice mixture to the seeds in the final step with the olive oil?  What did the rest of you do and how am I the only person to notice that the directions are off?!

I didn't completely go by the recipe. I used brown sugar in the bowl along with too much Cayenne pepper (less next time) and cinnamon only. I added the oil (grapeseed) and white sugar in the pan to cook with the seeds. Sweet and hot but so good.

These are wonderful, a great combo of sweet and savory!  My son wanted me to use seasoned salt instead of regular.  I also used brown sugar to caramelize instead of regular.   Otherwise, made them like the recipe calls for.  So good and so addictive!

Delicious even though I mixed up the steps a little. I will definitely be making this again. I did follow the suggestions and used 2 T. of brown sugar and more cayenne as I like spicy. I also used pumpkin pie seasoning.

Made as per recipe, slightly sweet and subtle spicy, a nice crunchy snack, these did take longer in the oven to turn golden about 30 min. but worth the effort

This is a great recipe!  I did tweak a few things because I really love sweets. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar for the caramelizing process, and butter instead of oil.  Next time I'm going to double it because it creates a nice crunchy sweet coating and helps the spices adhere to the seeds better.  I also used Pumpkin  Pie Spice since it has most of these spices in one jar.  All in all, I highly recommend this recipe.

These are so good. I don't use cooking spray (too many chemicals) so I toasted the seeds in the oven with olive oil and salt. Then I followed the advice of several to caramelize using 1TB butter and 1TB white sugar and 1TB brown sugar. I also added more than a pinch of cayenne pepper in the sugar/spice mixture, about 1/8 tsp. I like things hot.

Loved this!  Added a little nutmeg, swapped white sugar for brown sugar and put about a 1/4 tsp of cayenne instead of a pinch.  Best pumpkin seed recipe!  I need more pumpkins to gut now!

Here's the thing with this recipe--the parchment paper kept my seeds from cooking properly!  It took forever and they still weren't done, but I had already done the rest of the steps.  No matter--the next day, I threw them back onto an ungreased cookie tray, seasonings and all, and baked them 30 minutes more at 350.  Voil√°!  Perfection.  So, cooking method was a bust for me, but since they turned out delicious in the end, I gotta go 5 stars!!  Also, added double the cinnamon; it was a little heavy on the cumin for me.

This was a great recipe! 

Everyone loved them, but I did make a slight change. Instead of adding sugar to the olive oil, I swapped it out for approx the same amount of liquid BUTTER RUM flavoring syrup (as in the kind you would flavor a latte with). Gave the seeds a delicious fall flavor. :)

OK...I hate not giving it 5 stars...but I just can't.  It's great, but too sweet for me.  I used butter and brown sugar.  I knew it was going to be sweet when I read the ingredients...but thought I would LOVE it like the others.  It's more sweet than spicy.  That's the best way to describe it.  I would add more spice next time!  :)

So absolutely delicious! Used minimal sugar and replaced it with Trader Joe's maple syrup and a splash of vanilla extract. Also didn't use ground cinnamon and made sure to use chopped ginger root. The seeds burned a little while in the frying pan, but that turned out to be beneficial for stronger flavor. SO good!!

Five stars!  This is the best pumpkin seed recipe I have ever tried! It is very flavorful with the sugar and spices. I didn't change a thing and they turned out perfect.  They were not around long before we devoured them all.

I made this three times this fall!! First I think my pumpkin seeds actually measured 2 1/2 cups, and I soaked them in heavy salt water 24 hours. Make sure you allow the seeds to DRY! I did change the baking time to about an hour as I like mine really toasted! Two of the times I changed the sugar to dark brown sugar (just the sugar you caramelize) Plus adding 2 tbls olive oil and 1 tbls butter to the pan. You have to stir this constantly and just when everything is coated get it into the other sugar. When I made this per directions it was just as good! I did what others said with the cayenne by making it a 1/4 tsp. I'm told to keep making it this way!! Thanks for the recipe!!

The carmelization didn't work... 2 cups of seeds is a lot to pour into only two tablespoons of sugar.  The spice mix is ok, but i was expecting something more.

In step 4 I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Also used lofat butter(lol) in the skillet instead of oil. Came out way better than the gross seeds I tried to make last year, thanks!

I added the brown sugar substitute like some reviews said to do, and I didn't have cayenne pepper so I used paprika and chili powder. If you want more heat at the end use chili powder! I used butter instead of oil which worked great and has good flavor. Also, I added another half tbs butter and another tbs of sugar for the caramelizing part just to add more coat to it. SOO delicious!

Amazing!!  I took advice from other reviews to use brown sugar and butter for the caramelization, but also added more white sugar as well (just didn't look like it was going to be enough).  I also added some brown sugar and extra cayenne to the sugar-spice mix.  Maybe some more cayenne next time, but still very good! I have a feeling these will be gone tonight!

I made these for a surprise for my mom because she LOVES! pumpkin seeds. They turned out to be so sweet and yummy. I did an experiment. Instead of doing brown or white sugar i did both and it made them really sweet and yummy. Hope this little tip will help. I'm making these every year!

These are great.  We didn't have ginger, so just left it out.  Added nutmeg in it's place.  Also used brown sugar for the caramelized part of the recipe.  My 3 year old loves them.  I can't stop eating them either.  My new favorite way to make pumpkin seeds.

These are utterly fabulous! They are more sweet than spicy but I found it to be a perfect balance. I used butter and brown sugar for caramelizing rather than olive oil and white sugar. It just sounded better to me. I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned that these taste like caramel kettle corn. I think these will become a Halloween tradition in my house :)

Fantastic! I couldn't stop eating these. As reviewers suggested I used butter instead of police oil, but it turned out a bit greasy. Next time I will use half the butter. The spice mixture was delicious. Now I need to go buy another pumpkin so I can make more of these!!!

Made them on Monday, finished them on Tuesday! Will follow the advice of others to substitute brown sugar and add nutmeg for one set but sticking with white sugar and more cayenne pepper on another set as I think the spicy was lost in the sweet. Also didn't have parchment paper but wax paper did just fine. My kids get more pumpkins and husband gets the rewards of carving with these sweet treats..just awesome!

Ok but considering there's a lot of sugar and extra work in this recipe, I don't like them that much better than straight out of the oven with a little salt...

My kids (ages 3 & 5) and I LOVE this recipe! I too used brown sugar in the pan as others suggested and they came out awesome! I had to roast mine in the oven a bit longer than suggested and I ended up bumping up the temp to 400, next time I'll prob do 10-15 mins at 400 - just because its quicker. I will be keeping this recipe and making it for years to come I'm sure! Thanks!

Like all of the other reviewers I had to make a few tweaks...but man oh man are these the best out of the 3 different recipes/bathces I made this afternoon.

Definitely caramelize the sugars/oil/butter first.  And beware of popping oil when you add the seeds.  

These tasted fantastic and I didn't have cayenne pepper nor ground ginger on hand.  Just finely diced candied ginger bears and added a few shakes of nutmeg.  I would also reccommend ramping up the cinnamon and brown sugar quantities.  Just delicious.

Great recipe - very tasty.  I didn't have ground ginger and made it w/out.  Still very yummy.  I followed previous reviewers comments and used butter and 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1 tablespoon sugar.  Great recipe.

Wow is all I can say :o) My first time making roasted pumpkin seeds and they are yummy!! I used 1/4 tsp cayenne and it's just right for the spicy, not to spicy though. Used 3 cups of seeds and now I wish I had more seeds lol.

cooking time was too short, the seeds were still pretty hard with lots of "un-chewable" pieces. Coating was good, would try to make again but cook for longer.

Totally tasty! My whole family liked them including my 18 month old. I didn't find these to be spicy at all, but a very nice blend of flavors with the spices. I might try a bigger pinch of cayenne next time. I followed other reviewers suggestions and cut the sugar by 1 tablespoon. There was plenty of sugar without it.

These are great!!  I used a "heavy" pinch of cayenne and a "heavy" pinch of ancho chili power!!  I used these seed to garnish a fall salad and a pumpkin cheesecake for a dinner I catered.  We ate the rest of them as snacks for the next few days...

Me and my sister in law made this. We only added a tiny pinch of cayenne because we wanted her 2 year old to be able to eat it. It wasn't spicy but it had a pleasant kick. If you want it spicy add extra cayenne pepper.

DELICIOUS! I tried this recipe as an alternative to the boring, roasted, and salted pumpkins seeds I have been making for years. The taste was phenomenal. I would compare the taste to the roasted nuts you buy at the mall.   I don't agree that the sugar should be cut down. I did find that the baking time was not accurate. After 45 minutes of roasting I turned the temp up and that finally worked.

Great!  Loved a change to my usual salted seeds.  Sweet, would probably add more pepper for adults next time, but a great way for kids of all ages to enjoy a good snack!

Perfect recipe! Exactly what I've been looking for.  This recipe if far from bland and easy to make.  My 2 year old enjoyed making them with me and eating them when done!!!  Followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't change a thing.

Flavor wise its ok.  but it's WAY to chewy.  It needs to be cooked longer.  I think I'll throw mine back in the over and see if I can get them to crisp up.  If they got crispy then I think I would really like them

This was just OK, I didn't add the ginger (didn't have any on hand).  I added a touch of nutmeg as others suggested, and more cayenne.  Was a different spin on the standard salted version, but not amazing.  Willl keep looking for that killer recipe.

Super Yummy!!! I recommend using butter instead of the olive oil and at LEAST doubling the cinnamon. I also added some salt to the sugar/spice mixture. I love the sweet & salty combo.

These were surprisingly wonderful! I didn't have any cumin on hand so I left it out. As per other reviews I did add some nutmeg and doubled the cayenne. I didn't find these to be too sweet at all. They were even better the next day!

As a very new cook, the only trouble I had with this recipe was that I had the heat on too high and burned the first batch on the stove. Despite this, the guys LOVED the blackened result, and I made another batch with more success. Thank goodness for recipes that are forgiving with my newness.
