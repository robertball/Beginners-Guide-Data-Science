This is a simple yet delicious way to serve Tilapia!  I had my dinner ready in about 15 minutes...which is amazing for me!  I season my fillets with either Penzey's Northwoods Seasoning or Penzey's Jerk seasoning and while it's baking, I make up a quick home-made Alfredo Sauce with 1/4 cup of butter, some fresh garlic, 1/2 cup of half & half, 3/4 cup good Parmesan (grated) and a little Italian seasoning.  (Just saute the garlic in the butter over med/high heat, then add the other ingredients, stirring until blended.)  This recipe is definitely a keeper - thanks for a new way to serve up Tilapia!

This recipe is FANTASTIC.  I'm sure it's wonderful with the Creole seasoning but I can't eat spicy food so I used Johnny's Seasoning instead.  When the sauteed garlic was just right I added some raw shrimp and cooked them until they were almost done, added the Alfredo sauce and heated it throughly.  By the time the sauce was ready to top the fish the shrimp were perfectly cooked.  Who needs to go out to eat.  This is fare fit for a king.

Out of the 10 recipes I have tried on this site this is my favorite. I used the roasted red pepper alfredo instead of regular alfredo and it was amazing.

OMG...this just works!!!  I was a bit hesitant to top my beloved tilapia with alfredo sauce.  I am so glad I did as it takes it from wonderful to amazing!  I bake my tilapia the same way, but have never added a topping.  I did take Westie Mom's advice and made my own alfredo sauce as I don't care for the jarred stuff.  I followed her recipe for the sauce which is:  1/4 C butter, fresh minced garlic, 3/4 C parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup half and half and a bit of Italian seasoning.  It was perfect!  I actually used 2 T fat free half and half and 2 T heavy cream because this is what I had.  Do yourself a favor and make this sauce!  You only need a couple tablespoons for each piece of fish so it is worth the splurge!  Thanks for a great recipe!

Very Very Tasty! I did make my own alfredo sauce for this because jared ones are just not very good.  This was gobbled up by all three of my children. It has been put on the "make again" list!

I was a little worried about the alfredo with fish, but it was de-lish!  Wish I had some broccoli or asparagas to go with it though, I think that would have really complimented the dish!!  Thanks for a great meal!

We eat a lot of Tilapia and were growing bored with the same style over and over again.  When searching for a different taste, I decided to give this recipe a try and it was wonderful.  We will be having it again.

So simple and so good.  The alredo sauce and spicy seasoning nicely offset each other.  Huge hit w/ the fam.

What a quick easy meal.  This is our 2nd time to eat it and we still love it.  I use a little extra garlic to suit our tastes and this time I actually cooked the fish in a skillet versus the oven simply because I didn't want to heat up the kitchen when it's 100+ outside.  Excellent both ways.

This recipe turned out great.  I used Cajun seasoning instead.  I also added it on top of the Alfredo after it was served.  Delicious!!!

We LOVED this! Instead of using regular alfredo sauce I used Classico Brand Sun-Dried Tomato Alfredo in a jar because that's what I had in my cabinet (thats what I'll be using from now on when I make this) and for the creole seasoning I used Tony's Chachere's Creole Seasoning (I'm from New Orleans and that's what my family always bought). The only thing I did that was different was that I topped each tilapia fillet with shredded Parmesan Cheese before I put it in the oven. It was WONDERFUL and I'll be making this lots more! This is a 100% keeper! It taste like take out from a restaurant it was so good!!!

We have a winner!  My family is not big on seafood, but they will grudgingly eat tilapia.  My husband and oldest son really liked this recipe and even went back for seconds.  I accidentally used the whole jar of Alfredo rather than just a cup, so I've frozen the extra to use another time.  We'll see how well it freezes....

This was excellent!!! I did it in a skillit, I didn't have any creole seasoning so I sprinkled carribean jerk seasoning over the tilapia, I put a tblsp. of olive oil and a tblsp. of butter in the skillet than added garlic. Cooked the tilapia about 8 minutes on each side. I made the homemade alfredo sauce. Thank you westie mom! I made farfalle pasta on the side poured the sauce over it all yummy!!!

So delicious and extremely simple to make. I made this over a bed of angel hair and mixed veggies. Made me fall in love with tilapia all over again.

Only thing to note though, creole seasoning is pretty salty, so use a light hand when seasoning.

What a great alternative to the same boring fish recipes! This recipe has quickly become a favorite in my home. I use cajun seasoning over the tilapia and by suggestion from another user, Cassico light alfredo from the grocer. I've made rice as a side as well as pasta. This a a recipe your family will love!

This was quick, easy and tasty!  I used Mahi Mahi fillets instead of tilapia since that's what I had in the freezer.  I only used 1 tablespoon of butter and at least double the garlic.  I will be making this again soon.

My only adjustment was using a McCormick season grinder instead of the creole seasonings and came out good. My family really enjoyed this, plan on making again!

This was really delicious!  Definitely will become part of the regular rotation for sure.  I thought I had Creole seasoning but I only had Cajun seasoning so I made due with that.  It was still wonderful!  I have made several of the tilapia recipes from this site but my husband said this is his favorite!  Thanks for a great new idea for fish!

halved the recipe, but otherwise followed exactly (maybe a little heavy on the cajun, I didn't measure that part). My husband said it was the best meal I've made in months (served with white rice, crescent rolls, and onion green beans). I also found it delicious and look forward to making it again.

I didn't have fish, so i used leftover chicken. I removed the meat from the bone and set aside. I then sauted a small can of sliced mushrooms with the butter and added the seasonings,along with the chopped garlic.I then added the alfredo sauce along with a half jar of 1/2 n1/2 to thin. Mixed in the cooked chicken then tossed with cooked penne. Served with chopped broccoli, totally yummy and quick.

What a Showstopper. I will fix this over & over. I truly believe if you make your own sauce, instead of jarred, you could win a "BLUE RIBBON" for your recipe.

This is a good recipe for Tilapia, although not a big garlic fan. Next time I will use only one garlic clove.

This was a good and different way to use alfredo. I added thyme and some creole seasoning in the alfredo while it heated. I served it with corkscrew pasta and broccoli.  The tilapia tasted good with the alfredo too.

Made this for dinner.  It was so flavorful and juicy.  I used a whole jar of alfredo sauce and just made ravioli to put on the side.  The creole seasoning gave it a little spice and was perfect! My husband loved it and he's not a big fish eater.  Really easy to make too! thanks for sharing!

Made this as stated and was very good, husband and I shared the last piece of fish as I cooked 1 extra. I can't think of anything I'd change except to make my own alfredo sauce. 1 of the things I really like was how quick it was fixed, no long prep and only 9 minutes cook time as mine was done. I had dinner on the table in less than 15 minutes, with rice and steamed broccolli. Thanks for such a good, quick recipe.

I made this for my husband before I went to work. Easy and quick! My fish looked amazing and super tasty- magazine perfect till I put the sauce over it. It tasted great but looks weren't appealing with the sauce over it.

This was really good, I do a lot of recipes from allrecipies.com and this was by far the best meal I've prepared. Thank you for posting I did everything exatly as it says, but I just added some lemon juice to the tilapia while baking.

Loved this! My husband gave it rave reviews. Definitely not diet food. I made the tilapia as written. For the sauce, I doubled the butter and garlic and used 1 jar of alfredo sauce because I served the sauce over penne and asparagus also.  Great dinner!

Such a fast and easy recipe! I used less butter and oil, but used a whole jar of alfredo sauce since I was serving over noodles. I love the flavor of the creole seasoning, so I added a bunch more on the tilapia and noddles. I will be making this often!

I love seafood and this was the BEST!  We made our own Alfredo sauce.  Fresh garlic (more than the recipe called for) and Chesapeake Bay Style Seafood Seasoning instead of the Creole.  As soon as the Alfredo sauce was ready, I popped the tilapia on a searing hot grill outside and in a few minutes . . .  pure heaven.

This was amazing! I loved it! The kids loved it! Even the husband joved it! KEEPING THIS RECIPE. Thanks so much for posting it!  My husband was bored of my usual tilapia and when I found this I just had to try it! I had to make my own creole seasoning (from this site of course) and made my own "easy" alfredo sauce (from this site also) and it was literally the best thing I've eaten in a long, LONG time.

Fantastic!! Everybody loved it. After topping with the sauce, I like to slice a couple of Roma tomatoes and lay them on top, sprinkle with some mozzarella, and broil for a couple of minutes. Delish!!

This was really good and different!  I was going to just bake up my "normal", kind of bland tilapia and looked on here to try to find something different.  Well, this piqued my interest!  The only change I made was to chop up some asparagus, fry it up with some olive oil and add it to the sauce.  I also chopped up the tilapia when done and combined everything in one dish.  Yum!

My family raved! I made this dish for my parents, who don't like fish very much, and they asked for seconds and the recipe. I used Cajun seasoning (as I didn't have Creole seasoning on hand) and it was absolutely delicious! I too made my own alfredo sauce, 1/2 stick of butter melted, combined with 1 cup heavy whipping cream until boiling, then I add 1/2 tsp of crushed garlic and 3/4 cup grated parmesan, added slowly and stirring frequently to allow for complete melding of liquid with cheese. This recipe is wonderful as is and is incredibly easy and quick to make!

Fantastic!! I was skeptical at first but was looking for new ways to cook tilapia. I made it for my parents one night and my mom was not impressed with the idea. She actually said "if I don't like it, I'll just eat something else." Boy was she wrong! She scarfed it down. It is safe to say, we will make this again and again. DELICIOUS. My only suggestion would be to use about half the butter. Other than that...it's perfect. And it is super quick and extremely easy. Couldn't ask for anything better than that!

We didn't like this recipe at all.  The tilapia was too spicy for our tastes and the garlic alfredo sauce was very rich.  We should have toned down the spice and just baked the fish and served with no sauce.

Very good dish-quick and easy too.  To make this more figure friendly, I coated the filets in cooking spray instead of olive oil and I heated light Alfredo sauce with just garlic-no butter.  Delicious!

Really good, and a nice new way to cook/serve Tilapia.  I used way too much creole seasoning & it turned out a little salty, but that was my fault.  Served with rice & broccoli for a nice meal.

Awesome way to spice things up a bit with tilapia. Love this sauce, next time I will use better quality alfredo sauce (i used ragu) or make my own. Good for picky eaters who usually aren't too thrilled about fish. Definite keeper!

This was awesome! I made it exactly as the recipe outlined. I am not a fish eater and I even went back for seconds. Definitely would recommend and plan to make it again.

I have made this about 3 times now and it always turns out WONDERFUL.  I've used noodles w/ this recipe and rice.......both are equally as good.  It's easy, inexpensive, and goes great w/ any steamed veg.  My fav is asparagus ;)  All around a great dish.

Great, Easy recipe. I substituted New Orleans Cajun Seasoning which is basically the same as the Creole and it was awesome. We found a new way to have tilapia. Thanks.

This was so easy and so tasty that it just became one of the dishes i will be making on weekly basis. I used cajun seasoning because I couldn't find creole but I was told it is similar enough. I served it up as suggested with broccoli and rice. yum! Thank you for this recipe.

Took the advice of other members and did not use that much creole seasoning. Did however throw in some bell peppers and portabella mushroom. They added some extra color and taste. Very easy to make dish, will definitely be making it again sometime soon!

This...this was wow.  Very good.  I used lemon pepper seasoning instead of Creole seasoning.  And it rocked!  I served with lightly buttered white rice and kidney beans with a touch of brown sugar.    mmm x3

Very good and so, super simple to prepare!  The Creole seasoning and Alfredo sauce play very well together.  I baked my fillets for about 15 minutes.  Other than that, I didn't change a thing to the recipe!

This recipe was a pleasant surprise!  It was quick, easy and delicious!  I served it with angel hair pasta topped with the rest of the alfredo sauce.  I also increased the garlic because we are garlic lovers!  I will definitely be adding this to my list of quick and easy weeknight dinners.

We had this 2 nights ago and this morning my husband said "I believe that is the best meal you have ever made."  I am a full time homemaker and a serious gourmet cook... and this simple little recipe has humbled me!  I followed the recipe exactly using fresh tilapia and served it with Uncle Ben's garlic and olive oil rice and plain steamed broccoli.  I used Tony Chachere's creole seasoning. Next time I'll add some small shrimp.

I made this tonight and my husband and I both loved it.  I didn't have any Creole seasoning so used Old Bay.  I sauteed some fresh mushrooms with the garlic and used Ragu light parmesan alfredo sauce (70 cal. and 5g fat per 1/4 c).  I served it with steamed brocolli and steamed carrots for a quick, healthy delicious meal.  Thanks for the recipe!

WOW !!! This recipe was absolutely delicious. My daughter and husband (who are extremely picky eaters) wanted me to cook more of this since I only cooked the 4 fillets. Needless to say this will go on my weekly dinner list and added to my all time favorites.

LOVED IT! I couldn't find Creole seasoning at my super market so I used cajun seasoning and it turned out well! I went kind of heavy on the seasoning to make sure the fish was saturated in it and once that flavor was coupled with the alfredo sauce... oh my. De-lish!

Super delicious and super easy.  This recipe is a winner.  My only complaint was the Creole Seasoning Blend that this recipe calls for (I also found this recipe on allrecipes.com).  It really gave a flavorful zing to the tilapia, but it was WAY too salty.  If using this seasoning with this recipe, I'd recommend halving the salt that is called for (a whopping 3 tablespoons!).  Other than the salt, this dish was flawless.  Thanks!

this recipe was good but it seemed a bit salty.  I might try homemade alfredo next time instead of jarred sauce.

I've been dying to try a new recipe with tilapia because I eat it so often and wanted to try something new. This recipe was truly delicious. Simple to make, very versatile, and was a hit with my fiance. I used Bertolli Mushroom alfredo sauce out of the jar, added shrimp to the sauce mixture, and I couldn't find creole seasoning so I used cajun. I've added a picture of my outcome Served with long grain wild rice, broccoli, and cheddar bay biscuits (recipe off this site of course). I must say this one was a winner!!

Very tasty and super fast!  I really enjoyed having extra time to spend with my son, rather than being in the kitchen.. Definitely will be a go-to meal for this single mommy:)  I made it with light alfredo sauce from Wal-Mart and light butter, a few spoonfulls of minced garlic to save time.  It turned out delicious!  Thank you for sharing this unique way to serve tilapia.. I would have thought the combo to be much to rich.. It is, in fact, perfect:)

My husband and I loved this recipe! it was so easy to make (i used all purpose seasonings) and i had all ingredients on hand. The fish comes out flaky and the sauce melts in your mouth. My husband said "make sure you keep this recipe handy!"

This is a nice and easy recipe. It's been fun trying different alfredo sauces, and fresh tomato. I always serve it with Pasta. I prefer real butter (salted)

This dish was excellent.  I'm always looking for new and interesting and delicious ways to prepare foods. I will make this again, often. I did add sliced mushrooms and bottled marined sweet red peppers while sauteeing the garlic, before adding the Ragu Alfredo Sauce.

This recipe is amazing! I added shrimp and used two tilapia fillets with the sauce for 4 fillets. So delicious!
Next time I make this recipe I will try and be more health conscious- probably do 1 tablespoon EVOO, 1 tablespoon butter. I HIGHLY recommend this recipe!!

Yummy! This was so good and so simple to make. I did not find this spicy at all. I used Tony's Creole seasoning and Ragu roasted garlic. So I did skip the garlic and butter step. I cant wait to mix this up with different alfredo sauces! Low-carb and lovin it.

Wow, I've never had the Ruby Tuesday's version but mine was spectacular!  So easy to make.  I used the Bertolli 4 cheese alfredo sauce and followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  I did have to bake my filets a little longer to get them done, around 17 minutes.  Otherwise, this is a company worthy meal.  I served with angel hair pasta and a garden salad.  Just terrific and so fast & easy.

Tried this last night.  It is a KEEPER!  So easy and elgant.  Sauce is very rich so go easy with it when you ladle over fish. I served it with lima beans and garlic bread for a great week night meal. This would be good for company too because it is so easy to prepare you would have time to spend with guests and they will be impressed with your kitchen skills.

This was a great, quick recipe. Tilapia is often a sort of boring-tasting fish, but this recipe really livens it up! We decreased the butter since I felt like the alfredo sauce just didn't need much added to it (we used Bertollli) but otherwise kept everything the same. Thanks for sharing!

This is wonderful. I have never written a review and have made more delicious recipes from this site than i can count. This one is phenominal. I'm typically not a fish person but got in the mood for it yesterday and decided this looked interesting. Every time i make a new recipe the fam rates it if we like it as either a "once a week-er" or "once a month-er"....this one is definitely on the weekly list. Thanks for a simple, quick, and YUMMY recipe!

The alfredo does an excellent job of balancing out the somewhat dry taste of the tilapia.   I made home-made Creole since I have dozens of spices but no Creole, but since it was a bit spicy I rubbed 1/2 t of Creole on one filet and sprinkled 1/2 t of Old Bay Seasoning on the other.   Both turned out so amazing that I ate 1/2 lb of fish that night. This is some of the best fish I've ever had!

No need to sprinkle my homemade creole. Actually rub about half a tablespoon.

This was so delicious!  We loved the spiciness and creaminess combined together!  I followed the recipe to a tee and I wouldn't change a thing.  If you do not like spice, however, substitute the seasoning with Old Bay.  I served it with some pasta and asparagus and the pairings were perfect.  Watch the tilapia in the oven, it will be done before you know it!

2 stars because it was edible, but we will not be making this again.   I did not like the creamy sauce with the tilapia.  My husband usually likes spicy things but he did not like the Creole seasoning with the tilapia.

Our whole family enjoyed this recipe! What a great new way to serve fish.  Very quick and easy to make.  Did not have creole seasoning, so googled a recipe and made my own!  I followed the recipe for the sauce, but pan fried the fish in butter.  Served with rice and broccoli...delish!  Will try adding mushrooms and red peppers to the sauce next time.  Thanks for the recipe...it's a keeper!!!

This is amazing! I took the advice of the person who said to use lite Alfredo sauce. Just delicious. Next time I might make it just a tad spicier, but it's a great recipe.

This was very good, the only reason I didn't rate it at 5 stars was because I felt that the 1 tbl of Creole seasoning was a little too much.  It turned out a little more spiced than it should have been.  It was great, I doubled the alfredo sauce, and made some pasta and broccoli to go with it.  The fish was very good, but again, a little more seasoned than it should have been.  Next time, and there will be a next time, I will only use a half tablespoon of Creole seasoning and see how that turns out.

This is good. I will probably use less Creole seasoning next time. I served it on top of a bed of mashed potatoes.

Inexpensive, quick and easy and delicious....perfect weeknight dinner.  I walk in the door after work, start the water for the pasta, preheat the oven and go get changed.  30-40 minutes later, I have finished a tasty meal, cleaned the dishes and am ready to relax for the evening.  Shrimp would be a nice substitute for the talapia  Pounded out chicken (to keep it quick) would also work well.  A homemade alfredo,I used store bought, would put it over the top.  I make mine with steamed broccoli

Woohoo, you gotta try this recipe!  I made this as written except I scratch made the alfredo sauce.  I used Slap Ya Mama seasoning for the fish which I bought specifically for this recipe as it was suggested by another reviewer and we did not own a Creole seasoning.  Served with a New Orleans style seasoned rice and Cajun Corn and Bacon Maque Choux (submitted by "YOYO78").

This might be an example of better on paper than in reality.  I'll keep this recipe around because the directions for the tilapia with cajun seasoning part is perfect. I use my home mixed Emeril's Essence, cook as directed, and serve over rice cooked with chicken broth. It's great.

I was doubtful to try this recipe, but I am so glad that I did:) I used homemade Alfredo sauce and it turned out great. My dad loved it!! Other than to add some broccoli to the Alfredo sauce, I followed the recipe exactly. Will be making this again!! Thanks so much for sharing:)

This came out excellent! I was looking for an easy and quick way to bake some fresh tilapia I had on hand and already thawed. I used cajun seasoning and Rinaldi Alfredo Sauce (my favorite) since I had them on hand as well. The baking time is spot on and the sauce came out light and creamy. Not too rich. I definitely recommend going easy on the creole seasoning (or whichever one you use) since the sauce came out with a lot of flavor on its own. I served the tilapia with seasoned rice and fresh steamed veggies. Awesome and easy dinner my kids loved.

Soooo good!!  I added some extra minced garlic because I love it so and sprinkled some more cajun seasoning (always Tony Chachere's) into the alfredo sauce to spice that up a little too.  Will definitely repeat this recipe often!  Thanks!

This is a great, simple recipe!  I make this at least once a week- my boyfriend demands it!!  I do add medium shrimp to dish.  I cook the shrimp in a skillet with some butter and creole seasoning, and put on top of the fish, then top it all with the alfredo.  So delicious, thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Eh. It isn't awful but I had 2issues with this dish. First it is co fused if it is Italian or cajun.  Second the cream sauce sigh all the butter and Alfredo sauce kills any health benefits of the tilapia......so it wont be making a return trip here

This recipe is just WONDERFUL! It is so incredibly easy to make, and the tilapia doesn't have a strong fishy taste, which my husband doesn't like. Even he can eat this though! I just love this recipe and I have made it numerous times!

FABULOUS!! The only thing that I did differently was make my own alfredo sauce instead of using the jarred kind.  My son said this tasted like something you'd get in a nice restaurant at the beach!!  A keeper for sure.  Thanks :o)

This was absolutely amazing!!!!  Definitely go with the alfredo sauce that Westie Mom suggested.  I only had Cajun seasoning and it worked great.  The blend of the cajun and the amazing alfredo sauce is wonderful!!!  Serve over pasta for an awesome meal!!!

Whipped this up for Sunday lunch for my wife and I. Took less than half an hour. I had frozen Talapia fillets and a jar of Alfredo sauce from Aldis. Cooked some pasta and broccoli to go with it. Really good fast lunch.

This was was great tilapia dish to add to our menu.  I didn't have Creole seasoning so I looked up the ingredients (left out  paprika, white and cayenne  pepper) added basil, thyme, onion powder, old bay (my choice), sea salt, and pepper.  I took others suggestion and made my own alfredo sauce...(recipe is on this site) It was very D-lish!!!  Highly recommended...family loved it!!!

This was excellent!  I basically followed the directions except I made my own alfredo sauce (1/4 cup butter, 1 cup milk, 1 cup grated parmesan, garlic) then I added some cajun seasoning to the sauce as well as sprinkled on the fish.  The whole family loved it!  Served over angel hair pasta and had a side of broccoli...awesome!

Great receipe! I reduced the fat by cutting back on the butter about half, and using butter buds in my mixture. I didnt have garlic cloves, so I used garlic powder. Still great. Served over penne pasta.

I thought this dish was ok but it was not exciting enough for me which probably had a lot to do with the tilapia but I don't think I would make tilapia like this again.

This recipe was a hit for me and my fiance.  Instead of using creole seasoning, i seasoned the fish with just salt and pepper.  We also made some pasta and served the fish over it.  It was wonderful!

Made this for some friends and it was a huge hit. Everyone even made sure to eat up the leftover fish =0D I used Cod as the Tilapia in our store happened to be farmed. The Cod was wild. It turned out wonderful. I will be making this dish again. Super quick and so simple. Thank you for sharing.

This was not a bad recipe. It was very quick and easy. But it did not taste very good. It did not do the fish justice. It may be better with less sauce and more spices.

So Delicious.  I pan cooked the tilapia in a little olive oil and used a light alfredo sauce. I served with blanched asparagus and brown/wild rice.  It was a hit!

Not as great as the 4.5 made me think it would be. Actually, I thought the alfredo overwhelmed the fish. It may partially be because I put Italian bread crumbs on my fish too. I liked the breaded fish much better by itself.

Delicious. I did add some shrimp to the butter & garlic before I added the alfredo sauce. I served it with a side of pasta & sauteed mushrooms. The hubby loved it & it will definitely be a keeper.

The Creole seasoning has a lot of kick to it and surprised my family who was used to a lemon-garlic or Parmesan sauce. I liked being able to make this in the oven. It didn't take any longer than broiling since there was no need to turn the fillets and the sauce went on afterwards.

Wow, that was worth every bit of the 15 minutes it took to prepare such an amazing meal!! I loved it! Made a few tweaks to the jarred Alfredo sauce - sauteed 3 cloves of garlic in the butter then added some heavy cream to the sauce because the extra butter made the sauce a bit too salty. Then, added in some grated asiago and a handful of shrimp. The sauce was good enough to eat alone but I spooned it over the seasoned filets, on top of bowtie pasta and served with a side of broccoli. Life was really good in the few minutes it took to scarf that down!! Thanks for the inspiration! It will go on my favorite list!!

Holy smokes, who would've thought this combo would work?! My bf was hesitant when I told him what I was making, and ended up licking the plate! Followed the recipe except added mushrooms to the garlic and butter before adding the sauce! Served with rice, broccoli, and sauteed spinach. Sooooo good! Definitely will make again, and again, and again!

This is probably great for people who actually don't like fish much but eat it because it's good for you.  The flavour of the sauce is nice, but overpowers the fish.  I prefer a lighter topping for fish just a little lemon, dill and olive oil.

This was delicious. I broke the tilapia up in the sauce then added some steamed veggies. It tastes so good just by itself, but would be even better on rice or pasta. Thank you for posting this recipe!

Wow!!! I was expecting this to be good but it was amazing! My husband said it's his favorite meal ever :) and he's not even a fish person. I added a tad more garlic and sauted shrimp with that, then just eyeballed the Alfredo sauce and it is officially my favorite meal. It would be really good on top of pasta. To top it all off it only took 15 minutes, you can't beat that!

I loved this and the kids did too.  I serviced it with spaghetti noodles with some of the alfredo sauce poured over it.  This is very yummy.  It was a little salty so the next time I'll use unsalted butter and maybe a little less butter.  It was a little spicy for my youngest daughter so I'll probably use half the cajun seasoning.  I thought if was delicious.

This was absolutely delicious.  My husband just loved it as well.  I didn't have creole so I substituted Webers N'Orleans Cajun seasoning. This does have a bite to it which we like but can be adjusted to personal taste.  I also used roasted red bell pepper alfredo sauce instead of plain. This is a keeper!

It was easy and delicious, and my family enjoyed it. I couldn't find cajun seasoning at my store so I used Old Bay Seasoning instead. Old Bay Seasoning is fantastic. I was dumping it in my hand and eating it plain. It also goes wonderfully with any fish or seafood. Great recipe!

great taste and easy! too spicy for my kids though. I'll put less seasoning on theirs next time.

Made again on 1/2016 and just lightly sprinkled with Cajun seasoning. perfect!

Delicious.  Doubled the recipe as I was feeding 3 grown men and myself.  Should have tripled it!  Not a morsel left.   I also used the roasted red pepper sauce which a reviewer suggested and it was great.  Thanks for sharing.

This was delicious!  I made it exactly as the recipe and video describes and I would make the following changes: I would omit the butter and sauté the garlic in a couple of tablespoons of olive oil, then brush the garlic oil over the filets. I would use the creole seasoning more sparingly that shown in the video and I would use less Alfredo sauce and dilute it with some milk or water.  The flavors were great together! We had it with a Caesar salad and U can’t wait to make it again!

It was so easy to make for someone who is always in the go. Literally took fifteen minutes to make. I used Cajun seasoning because I couldn’t find creole, but tastes a smells just fine.

Living in south Louisiana we eat a lot of fish. I have never used garlic Alfredo on any fish. I made the sauce using 1/3 stick of butter with a little oil, about a tsp of minced garlic, evaporated milk and a handful of shredded Parmesan/Romano blend. I baked Cajun seasoned (one side only) catfish filets in a dish at 450 degrees for about 20 mins until done, then poured the sauce on the fish. This is a great recipe for catfish filets. It’s quick, easy, and there wasn’t a bit of the fish left over. Also good is that it requires only a baking dish and a skillet to prepare. Already looking forward to the next time.

I didn't use 3 tablespoons of butter (because I was out), and subbed Creole seasoning for Old Bay (personal taste) but we loved it! We're going to try it was a different fish, though, because we both found out talipia is bleh for is.

Simple and easy to make. For that I would give it a four. Still found it be a bit bland but my son said it was the best Alfredo pasta dish I've made. So I give it 3.5 stars overall.

This is sooooo good! My husband loves it and asks for it at least once a week (generally when I start pulling out the fish). I make my own Alfredo sauce, but that is the only change I make with this recipe. Super yummy!

I have a divided household (vegetarian and meat eaters) so I made this with chicken and then tilapia. I prepared the tilapia as noted but also prepared the chicken the same way. I doubled the sauce recipe and added fresh spinach and a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and basil. I served this with penne pasta and it was a hit! I will definitely make this again!

IFirst, I can’t have gluten so I substituted rice pasta.  Then I also added fresh shrimp cut into pieces, even though the recipe didn’t call for it, then added fresh garlic, onions and mushrooms.  I made my own spices out of dried chipotle chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and a bit of salt.  Mixed with Alfredo sauce and it was good.  I would make this again, I just felt it was a bit plain as written so I added to it.

Hubby and I Loved it!!  I didn’t have any Creole seasoning so I used Bam Bam seasoning ( that is a mix of paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, black pepper, oregano, basil, thyme, celery and salt.) I also sprinkled lemon juice on the fish before I baked it.  I used Asiago cheese Alfredo from a jar and added minced garlic and butter. The fish came out so good! I served it over pasta and broccoli tossed in the Asiago Alfredo sauce with some of the sauce over the fish. I will definitely make this again.

Loved it!! Did add a few of my regular seasonings to the tilapia since I'm a seasoning freak, but first time using my Creole seasoning that's been sitting in my drawer and it was great! Especially with the creamy sauce!!  Thanks for the Yummy recipe, going to make it tonight for my Picky 15 year old daughter!! She can't turn this one away....Keeping my fingers crossed!!

Nice change from my regular tilapia recipes. It is very rich so will only make 1 or 2 times a year. Instead of using a jar of Alfredo sauce, I used Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce by Dawn Carter on this website. We love that sauce & was worth the little extra time it took instead of opening a jar. We made half a recipe for the tilapia. I didn't have enough fresh Parmesan cheese, so had to thicken a little with corn starch & it was still as good as the 5 stars we gave that sauce. Now for the sauce in this recipe being poured over the tilapia, it says use 1 c which I thought was more than really needed for 4 fillets, but that is personal preference.

Incredible. This is my new favorite way to make tilapia. I made exactly according to the recipe. My kids thought it was too spicy, so next time I will not sprinkle as much on their fillets. My husband said it was too spicy, but he is extremely picky. He liked it otherwise. Definitely making again!

The tilapia was a great protein for the meal. I served the tilapia and sauce over penne pasta and added Parmesan Cheese to the sauce to help thicken it and provide a pleasant cheese after tone to the meal. Very filling and satisfying without being painfully full. Definitely a new family favorite.

Awesome & easy - the whole family enjoyed this. I made my own creole seasoning (Creole Seasoning Blend recipe from this site). My tilapia from Costco was frozen so it took about 15-min (at 400 in convection) to cook. I also made my own alfredo sauce using the suggestion of another reviewer (1-cup Butter, Fresh Minced Garlic (3/4 of an entire head), 2-tsp Italian Seasoning, 1-tsp Creole Seasoning, 2-cups Dry Parmesan, 1-cup Coffee Cream, 3/4-cup Milk). Served over linguine with steamed broccoli.

Yum! I added yellow pepper & white onion and used no yolks egg noodles instead of penne. I also cooked the fish a bit longer with the sauce on top.

I am one if those people who have an urge to vomit from the smell of fish but this is one of the best meals I ever tried! Not only does tilapia taste nothing lile fish if seasoned properly but it goes so well with alfredo sauce!
I seasoned it with similar spice mixture and made my own alfredo but it's not a lot more work at all. Would really recommend this recipe to anyone!

Is there any ways to suppress that fishy ssmell in the fish? I tried soaking in vinegar, but the fish smelt even after soaking. Other than that it tasted good. And this is the first tym i tried cooking fish.

I had a bag of baby spinach I needed to use so I sautéed it and added it to the alfredo sauce. Served it over buttered/peppered spaghetti. My husband and I loved it. So glad I doubled the recipe can't wait to have the leftovers tonight. Thanks for the great recipe!

Amazing blend. I added rice to the bottom with the tilapia on top and then drizzled the sauce (with red onions and mushrooms and a chicken broth) on top.

So easy and so quick!! Great weeknight meal. 
I wasn't sure how tilapia and alfredo were going to mesh but it worked. I normally make my own alfredo sauce but happened to have a jar on hand. With the garlic and butter it improved the flavour and went nicely on a bed of linguine.

I thought this recipe was delicious and, perhaps even more importantly, easy to put together. I thought the combination of the Alfredo sauce (I used a light Prego sauce) and the Creole seasoning was very tasty.  I served it with some lemon-garlic asparagus and some cellentani pasta.

I would have to say it was beautiful. Mixed it with a bag of broccoli and spagetti noodles. Instead of creaole I used a touch of Italian seasoning. Tasted amazing and went down just right. Thank you for the recipe.

Such a great dish. Quick, easy, and most importantly IT TASTE GREAT! My family loves fish so this will be a regular dish for us! My children 7 and 12 cleaned their plates.I paired it with broccoli and brown rice. I'm far from a chef or nutritionist but it was a perfect fit for my family lol.

Absolutely delicious!  I cooked this as a combined effort I made from scratch with two other Allrecipes.com recipes: the Cajun Spice Mix recipe and the Alfredo Sauce recipe.  I also used Swai filets which for me there is no difference in taste and texture from Tilapia.

We will definitely be having this again! Yummy and different way to have tilapia. I served it with angel hair pasta, but might try a different type of noodles next time. Also I put chopped chives on top for a little extra flavor.

This was delicious and so easy to make!  I had dinner ready in 20 minutes and 10 of that was making the creole seasoning from scratch!  Definately one of my favourites.

I usually order alfredo pasta at all the major food chains. This recipe is really comparable to the quality one might find at Ruby Tuesday, TGIF, and Olive Garden. I served the fish with pasta and broccoli. It was easy to make and was ready pretty fast. I was extremely impressed with the result, and I will keep it on my short list of go-to recipes.

Delish!!! I am not a fan of fish but trying to become one because it's healthier for me, and this is sooooo good! Granite the alfredo  is not good for me, but it takes the fishy taste out! We like garlic so we also used a garlic Alfredo on it! Thanks for sharing!

Super / Great flavor.  My family loved it. I served  it with long grain wild rice. "Delic".  Try it if you want to get away from frying fish all the time. Very filling, quick and easy.  My three year old liked.That says something to me.

I don't usually eat fish, but I'm trying to eat healthier. I LOVED THIS RECIPE! I sauteed the garlic in a 1/2 tblsp olive oil and used a light alfredo sauce to cut the fat and calories. Amazing flavors!

I Made this tonight The wife and Children loved it. I used a cream cheese alfredo sauce I found here and it was very tasty. I was the only one who thought there was a bit too much creole seasoning so next time I will try johnny's seasoning instead. Thank you for a great recipe and I served it over rice with broccoli and cheese.

Great recipe!  This is my first review (I am trying to expand my cooking skills lol) and I loved how it turned out.  I was a bit too heavy on the seasoning (I always forget about the salt in the sauces), but will make the modification for next time.  Thanks for sharing!

I made this dish the other night for my wife and she absolutely loved it!!! She eats fish all the time so I wanted to prepare it a little different this time around. This is definitely a go to dish. One thing I will say is that with the creole seasoning, a little goes a long way.

It was delicious!  My son is not that fond of fish and he loved it.  We used a home-made alfredo sauce and did not use the butter that was in the ingredients list below.  Very good recipe!

Very tasty and very easy.  Though it really doesn't need 3 Tbsp of butter, i used much less, i also used less alfredo so it didn't overpower the fish.

I don't eat fish any more, because I dont like the smell of fish. I friend told me to try tilapia it doesn't smell fishy. I used this recipe for my first time eating tilapia and I liked it, my husband did too. He said he never had fish with an alfredo sauce before.

Used season salt instead of creole seasoning on half the fish.  The other half season salt, crushed red pepper and a bit of red pepper powder for a little kick.  Added shrimp to the sauteed garlic and butter, served over fish with alfredo sauce.  Family was surprised to like it so much!

Magific!  since I don't ever use jarred sauce, I made the alfredo.  Make a rue with garlic, add heavy cream and parmegan, some black pepper, maybe some diced red bell peeper if you like. viola!  I made some extra for the linguini (or rice), with some garlic bread and what a meal!  Make this for those who are not crazy about fish... mine ate it all up.

Amazing! LOVED it! My husband said it's the best fish dish he's ever had!  Made the homemade alfredo as well & added shrimp.

Really a great recipe.  It was super simple.  Best fish dish I have ever made.  I only used about a tablespoon or two of the Alredo sauce per fillet.  But if I had kids that didn't like fish I suppose I would pour much more on.  You won't be sorry in trying this recipe out! Thanks youngwoman!
