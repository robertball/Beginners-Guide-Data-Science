I have been making this recipe for years! I sometimes use milk chocolate chips and I also use this recipe with peanut butter chips! This always turns out wonderfully and am asked for the recipe. Thank you.

This fudge has a wonderful chocolate taste.  If I made it again I would not boil for the 4 - 5 minutes stated in the recipe - it turned out hard.  2 - 3 mintues would make a creamier fudge.

I used 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips, and 1 cup semi-sweet. I cooked for exactly four minutes, starting when it starts to boil. It is flipping fantastic! Honestly, the best fudge I have ever had. Fudge is usually too sweet and not chocolatey enough for me. This is just the ticket, and the texture (once well chilled) is heavenly.

This recipe came out perfectly. For one batch I substituted 1 1/2 cups semi sweet chips for 1 cup milk and 1/2 cup semi sweet... DELICIOUS. Extremely creamy and my husband says,"Tastes like fudge." Will now make all of the time. It was SO easy

Very Very delicious. If you live in the UK, Use castor sugar because granulated sugar is far too coarse and does not give a creamy texture, no matter how long you cook it!

I was looking for a recipe for fudge that was as simple as could be and I found this. It tastes just like those more complicated recipes, who would have guessed you just boil a few ingredients, mix in a few others, and refridgerate. I love this recipe!

I really like this fudge! It is very simple and tasty. One suggestion is too only boil the evaporated milk mixture for 2-3 minutes. (3 if at altitude)

Easy! I took another reviewers suggestion and used marshmallow cream in the sugar/milk mixture.  Opted out of the nuts.  It's in the fridge right now, but after licking the spoon, I can already tell how delicious it will be.

I have used this recipe for years and it always turns out great!  I use half milk chocolate chips and half semi-sweet chips and always get rave reviews.  Sometimes I even throw in a handful of peanut butter chips for a great chocolate peanut butter fudge!  Always creamy and the perfect texture.  Thanks Nestle!!!!!

I did not like this recipe at all!  I followed the directions to the letter, with poor results.  It looks NOTHING like the picture.  It wasn't creamy either, and the sugar cooking time needs increased or the sugar will still be "gritty".  I will not be making this again!

Always buy Tollhouse  Semi Sweet Chocolate in the big bag at Costco for the holidays and use many recipes, but never the fudge.  Fantastico!

The first batch I made following the recipe exactly. It came out really chewy. I added 1/2 cup more chips and 1 TBS of butter and only boiled 2-3 minutes. It came out perfect.

My husband loves this fudge.  He wears dentures and it isn't too hard.  He loves the taste a lot!  Easy to make too.  I've made it for Thanksgiving, Christmas and during the week when his sweet tooth is craving fudge.  Make it, it's a keeper!

I spent hours trying to make fudge over 5 times and only once came close to a good consistency.  These take 15 minutes and taste great with an awesome texture.  Now to learn to limit my daily intake.

My granddaughter (age 19) and I made this fudge yesterday and it was awful. It is hard as a rock and unfit to give as Christmas gifts as we had intended. I see that other reviews said to boil for 2-3 minutes. Wish we had read that review first. The fudge we made is going in the trash. :(

This is a pretty standard recipe, and was pretty good fudge, but not quite as good as I had hoped.
