I want to start off by saying that we have always loved Chef John's recipes, rating them all 5 stars, but we did not like this one at all.  We had 5 adults that ate it and only one said that it was O.K.  It was WAY to acidic for us so we added extra sugar which made it better but still not good. I will not be making this again but will continue to try other Chef John recipes as they are normally amazing.

I like where this recipe was taking me but not where it ended up.   I used Sriracha and was a little worried that a whole tablespoon would be too much spice, so I started with a teaspoon.   Not enough.   Two.   Too much for us.   Not overpowering, but wanted it a little gentler.   It was good, but different like that.   I did end up adding more sugar to make up for the extra spice.   I like the premise of this recipe and I will make a version of it again.   I liked the extra sweetness that I got when I added the extra sugar and did like some of the bite of the Sriracha, but I should stick with 1 teaspoon next time.

This could be a gourmet coleslaw, and it was very good. The peaches made a nice tangy addition, but it is entirely too spicy as written. The next time I make this I will cut the Chili pepper sauce to half a tablespoon or less. I don't like my food to have an afterburn. Maybe it was the type I used--so if you're going to make this recipe either know your chili paste well, or use caution with one you're not familiar with. I opened a new jar of something I had never used before.

Just made this for a bar-b-q....It was a huge hit...
Something different than the usual cole slaw.  I also
added toasted sliced almonds on top for taste and
contrast.  It was quick and very easy.

This recipe sounded really good to me.  I have a mango coleslaw recipe we love, but this one really lacked the wow factor.  I ended up adding a bit more siracha and vinegar, but something was still missing

This was awesome!  I used a pepper jelly and didn't add the cayenne pepper because I didn't have those items.  But, it turned out delicious anyway. The BF loved it.  Next time, I'll try it as written.  Thanks!

The sweetness of the peach contrasts nicely with the hot sauce and cayenne, but be cautious with how much you use (as other reviewers have noted).  Ridiculous as it may be, I had 4 different kinds of hot sauces/chili pastes in the fridge, tasted each, and went with the mildest.  Even then, I didn't use the amount specified, and we're probably middle of the road on spiciness.  As we all know, you always can add more, but you can't take it out.  And this is not a criticism of the recipe because spiciness is subjective, so each person should adjust to his/her own liking.   This was a nice change from the same old-same old style of coleslaw.

This was a great recipe. I was a little nervous to bring it to a BBQ last weekend from the reviews I read. Pulled Pork was being served by the host, and I brought the slaw. This was so tasty! I made it exactly like it said. However I used my Ninja to blend the dressing and to cut the cabbage up. The peaches were very sweet against the slaw. The spices were very mild but that worked well because the pork was spicy and the slaw kind of had a slow burn to it. It says it makes 6 servings, well there were 12 people at the BBQ and I had enough for grilling out the next evening for another 4 people. Everyone commented on how much they liked it and asked for the recipe. WIN for allrecipes and a WIN for me!

Fabulous flavor, a new family favorite!  Make a generous amount; I might make 1/2 recipe next time.

Nice fresh, fruit flavors. Needs a bit of tapioca to hold it together.

I'm not sure why my reviews are being edited considering my opinions are always fair and non judgmental. Some recipes are hands down winners and some just aren't. Opinions are just that. So, here's my second attempt at writing an honest review. I did not care for this  at ALL. For one, this was VERY tangy! There was barely any sweetness to balance the tangy-tart vinegar, mustard and lemon flavors. Secondly, this had an oddly spicy aftertaste (from the Sriracha)  that just didn't belong, IMHO. I rarely ever toss good food, but this time I couldn't resist. Maybe this will float your boat, but it did absolutely nothing for me. :(

I made it exactly per this recipe, but it was lacking. I then added more sugar, then more salt, then again more sugar and more salt. Finally added more mayo & that did it! So Chef John does say that the ingredients are per taste, and he means it literally!!! I'm now going to try the toasted almonds as suggested by Mary Thomas' review.

I made it according to package directions and I liked, as did our guests, but it was bit spicy for me.  If you like spicy, you will be good, if not I would skip the cayenne pepper.

This is the bet coleslaw ever. The peaches add a fresh summer taste and the mild spicy flavor is wonderful.

I made this salad as stated.  On it's own, the coleslaw may be a little bit too funky for some.  It's more vinegary than a typical coleslaw.  However, I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because it creates a fantastic topping for black bean burgers.  Spicy peach coleslaw really shines in this capacity.  Thanks for the recipe Chef!

The underlying heat made this a very satisfying alternative to regular coleslaw. I found that Sambal Oelek didn't add as much flavor as the Heavenly Chef Hunan Red Chile Pepper Sauce that I had on hand. The peaches and cabbage were a good enough contrast to the heat from the chile pepper sauce to make the coleslaw tasty and not overwhelming. Several people that I served this to were curious as to where the heat came from but didn't complain or leave any on their plates which I took to mean that they also enjoyed it.

It was too spicy and I left out the cayenne.  Will make again with less hot sauce.

A winning side dish from Chef John!  I went a bit heavier on the sambal and dijon, and used apple cider vinegar instead of rice wine because that's what I had on-hand.  I included added some diced apple as well - it's that lovely transition in the seasons when peaches are ending and apples are starting, so I happened to pick up both from the farmers market.  We liked this one a lot!

What a pleasant change from usual slaw.  Be careful not to make it too spicy, as I did the first time I made it.  That will teach me to embellish on a great recipe.
