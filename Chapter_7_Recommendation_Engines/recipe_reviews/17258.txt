You don't have to use quite that much cheese. Also a little "real" cheese doesn't hurt. I used a little mexican cheese blend added to the original recipe with about half the cheese food and some parsley basil and a bit of chili pepper. We dipped bran crackers. VERY GOOD!

This recipe was VERY easy to make and perfect when trying to figure out what to do with things you have on hand. It's good a little bit warm - goes well with veggies too.

I didn't think this was all that great at first made exactly as described and cooled before I tried it. But when I had the leftovers reheated a bit and ate it while it was warm and somewhat melted it tasted quite a bit better to me. Also is that a typo? I've never seen a recipe use 1 tea spoon of butter instead of one tablespoon. I don't know if the small amounts of butter and mayonnaise really make a difference anyway. I ate the dip on generic wheat thins.

Such a simple idea but I needed something to go with some crackers and this was super good. I didn't add the butter and don't think it was needed.
