I did change this recipe a little...added bacon bits, 2 cans carrots, celery salt- I used 1/2 the garlic & onion and only added 1 1/2 c. flakes-no bread crumbs.  My family are all potato soup lovers and thought this was the best they've had in years!  Thanks

Tasted ok, but very thick and did not look appealing

Terrible. Bland with a weird almost grainy consistency and way too many onions. Definitely will never make again.

I wouldn't actually call this soup. I did not care for the taste or the texture.

I really wanted to like this. The garlic was very overpowering. I omitted the bread crumbs.  The texture was odd with the potato flakes. I ended up adding cheddar cheese salt and pepper to try to salvage it. It just didn't work. If I were to try this again  I would lessen the garlic powder to 1-2 teaspoons. I would thicken with a roux rather than the potato flakes. The cook time was also off... the potatoes were not cooked enough in the 4 1/2 hours. I ended up having to finish it on the stove due to time constraints. Wish it had come out better. I will stick with my normal potato soup recipe! Thanks!

Made this today. It wasn’t awful...  But it was lacking something. The smell of it cooking all afternoon was scrumptious but as it cooked, I could tell the onions were going to be overpowering...  and while the potato flakes were helpful to thicken it up, it may have been too much. If I make this again, I’ll use about half the suggestion of potato flakes and definitely less onions. I also think it needs one more flavor, although I’m not sure what I’d add just yet. The broccoli is yummy but doesn’t have a distinct taste after cooking all afternoon. Either way, it was a decent meal and nice to try new things. I almost wonder if it would have maybe been good as a side to a pork tenderloin or even a steak?  That would be a heavy meal but on a cold night it might just be perfect.

I followed the directions as written and all the milk curdled. I won't be using this recipe again.

This is a recipe to use IF you are creative and use it as a starter recipe.  First it has no size for the veggies.. All the veggies should be minced. Cubed is just to big.  2nd IF You wanna still do this in the crock pot.. Aim for high for 8 hours. I did for the 4, and like others said I had to finish on the stove.  Instead of the potato based on the other reviews, I added shredded cheddar to it.  It was already very thick from the potatoes..   Gage the vegiies.. The dont tell you how big the potatoes should be.. so use your best judgement...

This soup was barely palatable.  I think it was the boiled broccoli that really did the soup in. The rest of it should have been a good base.
