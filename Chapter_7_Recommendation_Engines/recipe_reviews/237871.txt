This was good as is.  Another time I made it, I didn't have the boullion, so upped the taco seasoning.  Also good.

The first time I made this, I used Mexican sour cream and it ended up way too salty. The second time, I subbed plain Greek yogurt for the mayo, and it was really tasty. I'm sure you can adjust the heat with different salsas and using pepperjack cheese.

Used all sour cream and no mayo. Also added aprox. 1 tsp of cumin. Tasty and easy recipe!
