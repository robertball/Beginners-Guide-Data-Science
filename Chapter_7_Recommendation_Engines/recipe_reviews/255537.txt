I cut the calories by more than half since since I only made half the recipe, used soy milk instead of regular milk and subbed Truvia for the sugar. It's not thick like a milkshake, more reminiscent of an Orange Julius and very delicious.

Yummy! our orange juice was a bit sour, so up'd the sugar to compensate; very refreshing

Maybe the best milkshake I have ever made. I used fresh squeezed orange juice and it was absolutely perfect. Bravo!
