This was a great recipe. I did substitute mushrooms for the peas and I added a bit extra on the seasoning but other then that everything was great.

I followed the recipe as stated but didn't add the peas. It was easy to throw together and put in the crock pot for a busy day. After tasting added some A1 and worcheshire sauce.

Great! This is just the stew recipe I've been looking for. I made no changes except for serving over rice. It was a big hit with my family.

It was both easy to prepare and a excellent stew. I did substitute venison for the beef since deer season had been kind to me. Since I have no small kids I also added a bit of Worstchestire and Texas Pete to taste. I also didn't have any frozen peas but found a regular can of baby peas works well.

With the exception of swapping fresh mushrooms for the peas I followed this recipe exactly. The vegetables were perfectly cooked the consistency was great but the stew didn't have one bit of flavor. I added some tomato paste and wine just before serving which helped a little. I'd like to try this recipe again; maybe to figure out what went wrong. Also personal preference but the cornstarch seemed to give the stew a slimy feel. No one else commented on that though.

This is a great basic stew recipe! The other day i didnt have beef broth or beef stew meat so i substituted chicken broth and pork meat and it was great! Kind of like chicken pot pie without the crust!

Husband thought it was great. I thought it was horrible. Settling for a three star the in between for us. The thyme was overpowering.

Love this one! I use fresh herbs from my garden rather than the dried and I use fresh sliced mushrooms instead of peas. It is by far the best heartiest beef stew I've ever made. Bravo!

This recipe was interesting and tasty. When we saw the picture i thought that my children wouldn't like it but. It turned out great and lasted a long time. It was great proportion for your family to reheat.

I'm a college student living with three other guys and four girls. Between classes and work we barely have time to cook good meals. But this stew is easy to make it doesn't take too long and it's always a hit! I usually double the recipe and add a pound of bacon coated in brown sugar. It does our family well. Thanks Ted whoever you may be.

Same as mom's. Make sure to brown the beef in batches and add oil as you need to. Also add the flour left overs just after the onion is soft and that will thicken it up nicely

AWESOME! This is a very traditional stick to your ribs kind of stew! Stayed true to the recipe. I did end up using less broth so that the consistency could be what I wanted without needing the cornstarch. Cooked in a slow cooker for 6 hours on low. It was totally delicious. My husband loved it and said "make this again". This also would be easy to freeze. Thank METAXA313 for this wonderful recipe! YUM!

To make this gluten free I replaced the flour with ultra fine rice flour. Instead of broth ( I must avoid glutamic acid) I used just two cups of water instead. Rather than potatoes I used white Japanese sweet potato. For the herbs I used herbs de province. I loved this.
