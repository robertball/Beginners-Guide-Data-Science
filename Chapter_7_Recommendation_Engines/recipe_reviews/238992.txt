I would give this 10 stars if I could. Absolutely delicious, and so easy to make. I used mixed greens instead of just spinach; dried figs instead of fresh; and added a clove of garlic to the onions. I would eat this salad every day if I could. So going to make it over and over again! Thank you!

I really liked this flavor combination but it's not for everyone.  It's so rich!  Easy to make and delicious.
