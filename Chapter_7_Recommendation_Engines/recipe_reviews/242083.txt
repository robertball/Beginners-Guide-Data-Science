I made this to bring to work for dinner. I diced my avocado, rather than mash it - and sprinkled the flax seed over it, hoping to keep it from oxidizing before I can eat it (= I thought I had a can of black beans, but what I had was a can of seasoned, mashed black beans - which were good in this. I also used grape tomatoes, rather than the diced romas, because I thought it would travel better. I did bring a balsamic vinaigrette for the veggies sitting at the top of my bowl. My suggestion [and what I will do in the future] - is to use a larger diametered, shallow bowl - so the diced veggies aren't in a tall stack above the hummus, avocado, and flax . . .

Love doing this in a tortilla too! Other great additions include romaine olives cucumber and some feta. A splash of lime juice helps if you want something like dressing without the oil or calories.
