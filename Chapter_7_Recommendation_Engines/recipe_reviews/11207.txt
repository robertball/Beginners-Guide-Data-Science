I'm one serious baker. I bake all the time and only use the finest, freshest ingredients available. In search of a butterfly cookie lollipop recipe, I came across this.  It was the very cookie I had been looking for. It's sturdy enough, did not spread and the vanilla I used came thru wonderfully.  The Lollipops look beautiful and will be used for my daughter's tea party. Made again 12/21/06-  This is truly a no fail recipe.  I would refer to this more as a cut out cookie.  It's super sturdy.  Made them for my daughters cookie decorating party.  This is by far the easiest cookie I have ever made.
If your making them as simply just a butter cookie, I suggest using chocolate, jam, confectioner sugar or sprinkles to enhance the cookie.  Or even bake them with that coarse sugar.4/17/08 What can I say, used the recipe again!  This is the most reliable recipe I have.  I used it this time as a cheesecake crust. I wanted to make something easy and will bring them to my daughters class today.  Ro, thank you so much for sharing.  Anyone who gave this recipe a bad rating must have done something wrong.

Well, this sounded like a good idea when I made it.  The cookies, however, turned out somewhat bland and floury tasting.  I will say that the dough was easy to work with and made very nice looking cookies.  I ended up dipping them in chocolate and various toppings -coconut, walnut, candy sprinkles, and crushed candy cane, which helped the taste a lot.

Great Recipe but I made a couple additions of my own. I added a tsp of cinnamon & 1 tsp of almond extract. I also topped these cookies with the Pink Valentine's Frosting. With these additions they were *amazing* - you couldn't eat just one :)

This is a great recipe. Cooks nicely. Does not PUFF like sugar cookies. To make gingerbread cutouts ( nobody here actually likes gingerbread but me) I knead cocoa powder into part of the dough to get that gingerbread color. (cinnamon would work too)They turned out perfect. I will use this recipe from now on.

Perfect!  My daughter's teacher asked me to bring 3 dozen heart-shaped cookies for Valentine's day for the kids to decorate.  I wanted a cookie that would stand up to the frosting and sprinkles and this recipe was ideal.  The taste was very nice -- just sweet enough.  I will definitely make them again.  Thanks to Ro for sharing the recipe.

These cookies tasted very bland and were extremly dry. Even after sprinkling them with icing sugar, they still tasted bad. Nearly the entire batch went into the trash because nobody in my family would eat them.

These butter cookies turned out absolutely fab! I decorated them with pecan nuts and sprinkles aswell as leaving some plain. Try dipping them in melted chocolate and letting them set!

This is a great recipe for the novice. First one I tried off this site (or ANY site for that matter) and it worked like a champ!

Excellent butter cookie recipe! I used the Sugar Cookie frosting from this site for the frosting and the cookies were a hit. I made these for a Christmas cookie swap and topped with crushed candy canes. 
I will make these again. Thank you!

These cookies are so soft and delicious.  They are not too sweet which is a perfect compliment to the sugary Royal Icing that makes them so beautiful.  The people who rated them as bad clearly must of made errors if their cookies turned out dry.  They are anything but dry if they are cooked properly.  Everybody I make these for LOVES

The taste of these cookies is good, but it is by far the worst recipe to use cookie cutters with.  The dough stuck to everything, the shapes from the cutters fell apart even when I used flour on the rolling pin and on the wax paper I used to roll the dough.  I finally dropped them in spoonfuls on the cookie sheet, flattened them with a cup dipped in flour, and used color sprinkles on top.  My daughter loved the taste but didn't get to have fun using cookie cutters.

Keeps its shape and does not puff out. This is a good recipe for decorating cookies. I was wanting more of a butter cookie. This tasted like a sugar cookie. I will make this again with less sugar. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I saw this being advertised as a recipe for cut-out cookies. Absolutely NOT! This dough tastes great, but it doesn't keep it's form when baking. They positively melt in the oven. So my advice - keep to drop cookies or circular cut-outs.
