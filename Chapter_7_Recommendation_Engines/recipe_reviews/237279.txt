Oh boy!  Can you say YUMMY!  These were fantastic. I didn't have fluff so I cut 3 large marshmallows into 1/3s and placed them on the tortilla. These were super good and fast. I only had creamy peanut butter on hand and it was 5 stars.

Yum and easy! Made me feel like a kid. I don't like peanut butter desserts much, so I subbed out the pb and chocolate chips for Nutella. Added some crushed up graham crackers and a little cinnamon and voila! Mexican s'mores! So good.

Delicious! And, with a combination of marshmallow, peanut butter and chocolate it's sure to be a winner. This was so easy to put together and made for a quick and easy dessert. I opted to use up some mini marshmallows I had on hand and the crunchy peanut butter really took these over the top. Perfect when you have a craving for something sweet! Be sure to serve with a tall glass of ice cold milk for a real treat that's great for kids of all ages!

Really fun and yummy! The kids LOVED these. I used mini marshmallows, and they melted nicely. I lightly buttered the outside of the tortilla before putting it in the pan to get a nice, golden color (also added an extra layer of flavor). I always have extra tortillas on hand, and now I know what to do with them! Thanks for sharing. :)

I made these for the neighbors kids and they loved them! Aside from the fact that I used a cookie cutter to make heart shaped quesadillas, they were a cinch to make.

Oh boy, something sweet & crunchy that's super fast & easy. Try it with banana slices instead of fluff or marshmallows.

These were very indulgently yummy. I liked them just fine, but my 2 y.o. didn't care for them, which I don't get, cause the kid loves peanut butter...and chocolate. Maybe marshmallow was a turnoff. I would definitely make these for another set of kids, but not for my family.

Easy way to use up some extra smore ingredients. However, I found it too rich and the tortilla taste distracting.  My husband had no complaints.  May make again for the kids but not for myself.

I thought this a was a nice yummy treat. I didn't measure anything--just spread the crunchy peanut butter, sprinkled on some mini marshmallows and chocolate chips, making sure not to go out too far to the sides. It only took about 3 minutes on medium heat on both sides. I let it sit just a couple minutes before cutting. It wasn't too messy, but it was still nicely melted.

Easy and fast enough for my daughter to make.  It's like smores in a tortilla. She has tried it with almond butter instead of peanut butter, and also cookie butter. Any butter will probably do as long as it helps the chips and marshmallows stick.

I was just making this for myself, so I used one large tortilla. I cut it in half with a pizza cutter, spreading a layer of the crunchy peanut butter,  semi-sweet choc chips and used mini-marshmallows. On the outsides, I spread a thin layer of soft butter. Let it cook 3 min, flipped then another 2 min. Very nice sweet treat and filling. Kids would like this. You could change out the chips flavor and even add thinly sliced bananas. I was only going to have half of what I made, but I lost control!

After try this recipe a second time this recipe it tastes good, but it cause a mess the peanut butter melts every where and runs all over the pan as does the marshmallow and chocolate chips. The instructions are a disaster, My advise is put the ingredients closer to the middle of the shells and let it melt and then it will melt to the sides. But the key is you have to put equal parts peanut butter on top of equal parts marshmallow and of course however many chocolate chips or vise versea.  (I didn't write the recipe.) That's  my suggestion and what i did and it worked out great for me.

This was very messy and rich.  I added a banana to the recipe and used creamy peanut butter.  My kids would love for me to make it again.  It's not a dessert I would make often though.  Not sure that it's really good for them.
