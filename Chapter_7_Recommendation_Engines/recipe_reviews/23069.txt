This was VERY good. I made a few additions myself. Along with everything called for here, I added a can of cheddar cheese soup and a tsp. garlic powder. I also mixed in 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese. I found it easier to throw all ingredients into a large mixing bowl, brown and drain the beef and onion, add to the mixing bowl and toss everything well. Then transfer to the baking dish. I took this out to stir every 15 minutes because my tater tots were not completely thawed. This helped, as well as helped the tots to crumble a bit and mix well with everything else. I liked that effect. For the last 15 minutes I topped with more shredded cheese and the french fried onions. This was AWESOME! A+

I sampled a tator tot like casserole at a potluck dinner I attended last night.  After the first bite, and even though it was a little cold, I knew I had to find a similar recipe.  There were plenty to choose from at allrecipes, but I'm glad I picked the one I did.  It was exceptional, easily a 5 star recipe--as casseroles go.  I used a pound of hamburger and a pound of sausage.  I usually feel like there isn't enough meat in a dish like this.  Adding the extra meat was a good move.  Fearing there wouldn't be enough soup and that the casserole would be too dry, I added what I thought was another can of mushroom soup.  After I opened it, I discovered it was cream of chicken, not cream of mushroom.  Never fear, there is margin for error in this dish, but I loved the way this turned out.  The flavor was amazing.  The tots disintegrated into the mix and it was an absolutely fabulous layout.  Talk about comfort food!  I served this with some leftover Cheddar Biscuits, the recipe of which is also available at this website--for a meal I won't soon forget.  Do it!

This recipe hit the spot.  I seasoned the beef and onions with garlic powder while browning, added shredded cheddar and green beans between the meat and tots, used Healthy Request soup to lower the sodium and fat, and also used onion flavored tots.  We loved the way it turned out.  This is a keeper!

This is a fine recipe, however, once I ground the hamburger (with the onion and garlic), I add the soup - almost any "cream of" will work - 2 cans.  I also add a couple of cups of mixed vegetables to the mixture.  You can do any combo, but the traditional is the green beans, carrots, corn.  Then you layer your baking dish with tator tots - then cover with shredded cheddar cheese - then put the hamburger mixture over that.  Cover with more cheese and top with tator tots.  This is easily one of the favorite fall/winter comfort meals for my family.

I'm from Minnesota and this is a very Minnesota dish.  I have come to find out that people from other places don't even know what this is.  I'm finally going to make it.  BUT I don't reccommend thawing the tator tots too much first because then they get really soggy and gross.  I also reccomend putting the tator tots on top. Add corn, it makes it really good.  I would also mix the beef and the other ingredients so that the beef doesn't burn so easily..

A great all around dish! My Boyfriend is from up north and says this is a mainstay. I added a can of peas, can of corn, and a can of mushrooms to the soup before pouring over tots. Turns out great everytime and dissapears quickly!

I saw this dish the newspaper for a Durkee Onion ad. I add a layer of chopped cooked broccoli and a layer of fresh chopped tomatoes. 1/2 cup of cheddar cheese is mixed with the soups. At the last 5-10 minutes baking, add shredded cheddar cheese to the top + some reserved onions.

This turned out awful.  I baked it for one hour and the hamburger on the bottom was burnt.  Guess I should have checked it before the hour was up.

This is a great dinner that can be made ahead of time and frozen for a quick but tasty busy night meal. Leave French fried onions off until the last 30 minutes of baking. (Remember not to put a frozen glass pan in a hot oven because it might break). Bake at 350 degrees for 1hour and 30 minutes.

I added Grated chedder cheese to the sauce mix.  If you do this there is no need to salt the recipe. It did seem to cook much faster than indicatedd in the recipe,  so check it often. Very Good!

Very good and easy.  Serve with salad and applesauce and you have a full meal.  I didn't have cream of celery soup, so I diced up 2 ribs of celery, threw that into the hamburg while it was cooking, and substitued a can of cheddar cheese soup.

I thought I was going to dislike this recipe. After all, I've tried 3 or 4 tater tot / hashbrown recipes lately and haven't been particularly fond of any of them... but when I tried this, wow! I love this recipe. I did alter it a bit, but I think the use of hamburger is what makes this so good. Most other tater tot / hashbrown recipes I've come across call for sausage, which I don't particularly like with potatoes. I used the whole bag of tater tots (even though I scaled the recipe down to 4 servings), substituted a can of cream of chicken for the cream of mushroom, and left off the fried onion rings. I mixed the beef and onion up with the soups, layered 3 cups of reduced fat cheddar cheese over it, and placed the tater tops on top. Having the tots on top allowed them to get crisp, which made the dish even more enjoyable. It also reheats well! I will definitely make this again. However, next time, I will only cook it for 45 minutes. When I took it out of the oven after one hour, the hamburger/soup mixture was beginning to become burnt to the bottom of the pan.

We love it! Here is the trick, put tots in frozen on bottom, make ground beef as instructed then add your soups and canned veggies and mix all that together, we do corn and green beans. Also I add some cheese too. After I mix that all together I put it on top of the tots, and stir it every 15 min to break up tots. They end up broken up into the casserole in the end. Finally we put the fried onions on the last 10 min of cooking. YUMMY! Best tot casserole ever!

Good! I took the suggestion in the recipe description and put green beans in between the meat and soup and skipped the french fried onions. I would use all cream of mushroom soup next time, as I didn't love the cream of celery in this. Browned the ground beef with minced garlic and added a little worcestershire. Thanks! :)

As a beginner cook nothing is more satisfying than seeing your family enjoy your food. And this simple yet tasty dish did the trick. The recipe is simple enough to make an simple enough to customize and that's what cooking is all about. I added peas but would've added more vegetable but i have a choosy eater as a brother. I recommend the french fried onions on top: they give great flavor to the dish.

Definitely close to a 5 star as written, but I added a few things to add to the flavor profile. 1lb lean ground beef browned with 2 teaspoons of minced garlic, white pepper, black pepper both to taste, 2tsp of  Worchestershire sauce, and 1/2tsp of liquid smoke. Mixed soups, and meat together, add 1 cup of frozen broccoli cuts, 1 cup of frozen sweet corn to soups/meat. Cover bottom of 9x13 casserole dish, only had 1/2 a bag of tater tots so placed them on top, and then sprinkled the fried onion rings over the entire dish. Popped it in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes uncovered. Left the cheese out completely, and it was great. Thanks for a great base recipe, and a quick & easy dinner for us.

This was excellent! After reading other reviews, this is what I did and it was the best tater tot casserole I've ever had: I used 2 lbs of beef. I used cream of chicken instead of cream of celery. I mixed the onions in with the soup instead of sauteing them with the meat. I added 1 cup of sour cream to the soup mixture. I then put the soup mixture into a saucepan and simmered while the beef was browning (I'm not sure if that made a difference or not). I added 1 Tblsp minced garlic to the meat with the salt and pepper. Since there were complaints about the beef burning, I mixed the beef together with the soup mixture. I sprayed my aluminum pan, then poured the soup/beef mixture into the pan and topped with the tater tots (so they would be crispy). I did not top the dish with the french-fried onions until the casserole cooked for 1/2 hour. Then it only needed another 20 minutes to cook (for a total of 50 minutes). Delicious!

This was great!  Even my super picky 6 year old cleaned his plate.  I added some cheese and sour cream before topping with the soup, it was fabulous!  I will definitely make this again.

This was very tasty and a snap to put together. I mixed the cream of celery soup in with the meat and spread the mushroom over the top of the tater tots and topped it with cheddar cheese slices then added the french-fried onions on top. I only used a lb of beef, how ever many tots it took to cover the top, and used the full cans of soup undiluted. It seemed to come out a bit salty for some reason even though I cut back the salt to less than 1/2 tsp. Easy recipe. Very filling. Man hearty. Thanks!

excellent! Instead of cream of mushroom we used cheddar cheese soup and cream of chicken... we added green beans in to this and instead of the french fried onions on top they went under the tator tots to ensure them not burning! Will definetly make this again!

I made this recipe as directed with just one change--I added a can of drained green beans on top of the ground beef. It could have used a little more soup, so next time I will use 3 cans instead of 2, but it was a great casserole.

I loved this one.  The french-fried onions were much better than the cheese that is usually on top of a tater tot casserole.  I'm not sure about pre-browning the ground beef though.  I kind of like it better smashed in the bottom and then baked with the casserole. Pre-browning is less greasy of course, but the casserole holds together much better if the ground beef forms a base.

I loved this, and really...it is so perfect, it's idiot proof! I use cream of chicken soup, and a layer of shredded marble jack between the beef and tot's. Also add a little sour cream to the mix and top with french fried onions before baking. Delicious. and the left-overs are even better once it all melds! Thank you!

I jazzed ours up a bit.  Made a half batch and then added in some leftover grilled veggies I had.  Also thinned out the cream of mushroom soup a bit with milk and added some garlic powder.  Added cheese to the soup/meat mixture and then added a bit more for the last 20 minutes.  I cooked mine at 400 degrees for 20 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered.  Delicious!

This was awesome! I didn't use the onion rings and I used 2 cans of cream of mushroom soup instead of the celery. I also put a layer of monterey/cheddar between the hamburger and tater tots. The only thing I will do different next time is add another can of soup because I would like mine to be a little bit saucier. It is goooood!!!!! I will definetely cook this again!

This is delicious comfort food!  It's easy and has great flavor.  I use venison instead of beef and added garlic salt and powder.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly as stated.

The recipe as is would get 3 stars. Skip the salt - the soup has plenty. I chopped half an onion to cook with the beef and put that in the bottom of the pan and covered with half the tots. I mixed a can of Ro-tel into the soup and poured over the tots then sprinkled on a layer of grated cheddar and baked for 20 min. Added the remainder of the tots and baked 25 min to brown nicely. I didn't think the uncrisped tots under the sauce would be good, but my family loved the combination and they were cooked perfectly. This one is a keeper for the comfort food category!

Thank you, thank you, thank you for posting this AMAZING recipe!! The only thing I changed was put cream of asparagus soup instead of celery because I did'nt have the other. It went over so well here at home that we had the leftovers for breakfast the next morning :)  .....

@ PAT FRANK;  YOU GAVE IT ONE STAR BECAUSE IT WAS NOT A DIABETIC RECIPE.   Anywhere in this recipe did it say it was suppose to be diabetic?  You could 1 star just about every recipe on the internet.  Geeez!

We loved it.  We put a layer of shredded Colby cheese on top of the meat mixture and eliminated the salt ingredient.

I have made this many times and there are never any leftovers. I dont cook the hamburger meat before putting it in the oven. I mix hamburger meat with cream of mushroom soup and onion gravy mix and spread it in a pan adding the tater tots and cooking for an hour. Then I add bacon and cheddar cheese.

This was much too salty. I might try it again and make my own sauce in place of the canned soup, but as is, it was difficult to eat.

This is a simple and great fall dish. Why not add some veggies for color and vitamins?? I cooked the meat with onions and garlic. To the recipe I added sweet corn, chopped broccoli and diced carrots. I also added Queso to the soup mixture. This turned out yummy and even my 20 month old liked it! I recommend it

This was good simple comfort food. I followed the recipe with the exception of adding a little roasted garlic while browning the hamburger and onions and sprinkling a handful of shredded cheese between the hamburger and potato layers. I only cooked this for about 40 minutes. The French fried onions were beginning to burn at the point. I would suggest not adding them until halfway through cooking time. Next time I think I would add more shredded cheese and maybe an extra can of soup, but that's just a personal preference. My husband and two year old enjoyed it and the leftovers were good as well.

I thought it was good. I did make a couple changes. I added jack & chedder cheese I also added a little garlic powder to give it a little more flavor. It is a good thing I checked it early because the ground beef had already started burning with 20 min. left on the timer. May try again if I do I will defiantly only cook about 30 min, instead of an hour.

My husband introduced me to the idea of Tater Tot casserole. Great comfort food. I gave it 5 because while it might not be my favorite food, my family LOVE it. I skipped the french fried onion rings, and added cheese to the meat mixture, and sprinkled it on the top for the last 5 minutes. I baked it at 400 to cut down on cooking time (about 35 minutes) and everything was warm and crispy!

We loved the recipe although I made modifications.  I used ground italian sausage because my husband does not like beef and I added fennel and celery to the beef mixture.

Surprisingly, we loved it!!! I think it needs some veggies next time, either green beans or Veg-All mixed in with the soups, maybe add some cheddar cheese and sour cream or an extra can of soup???  I served with salad because this is nothing but meat and potatoes.  I pretty much made as written except I substitued cream of chicken instead of mushroom and added minced garlic to the meat and onions.  I also added the fried onions the last 20 minutes so they wouldn't burn.  Like others, some of the meat did get a little dark brown (not burnt) on the bottom but I think it added more flavor to the dish and more texture too.  And I like how the soups are poured OVER the tots because they did not completely cover the tots so some were crispy some were not, it was great that way!  I wouldn't want ALL the tots to be crispy, it is a casserole after all!  It was super easy, will make again soon with the additions and update my review!

Very solid hotdish. I used cheddar cheese soup instead of cream of celery because it is what I had on hand (and who doesn't like cheese anyway). I also added some garlic powder to personal taste. Tasty and simple, yum.

as is this was not very good. I mixed the soups and the hamburger with a package of frozen veggies. I used additional spices to enhance the flavor (original mrs. dash) After stirring the stuff together I then layered the tatertots on TOP of the hotdish. this way they got crispy as the hotdish cooked in the oven. I ommitted the onions on the top because the tatertots where on top and they crisped up nicely... I grew up putting ketchup on this hotdish and continue to do so as an adult... When the tatertots are mixed into the soup mixture they get mushy... put them on top and the dish is much more enjoyable!

I was looking for something quick and easy that used items I had on hand and this fit the bill so I decided to try it out.  I can maybe see that this would be popular at a potluck or something-where people are only taking a spoonful and eating with other things.  As a stand alone main course though, it was fairly unappetizing.  It looked ok in the pan but when served on the plate, it was just a pile of slop, not very pretty to look at.  But, beyond appearances, the main problem I had was how salty it is.  The soups, the fried onions, and the tator tots combine to make it so salty that none of us could eat more than a few bites-and I didn't even add the extra salt called for in the recipe.  I did add green beans and cheese as some other reviewers recommended.  I guess this just wasn't my family's favorite.

Excellent - easy - fast! What could be better (okay healthy would be better)! This dish is definetly a crowd pleaser I have made it about 4 times now according to the directions and a couple times with some variances depending on what I got in the cupboard. My husband AND 4 kids love it - it is easy to put together - I'm bringing it to a potluck tonight. I would definetly reccomend this one - it is a frequently used recipe everyone enjoys!

I tried this mostly out of curiosity because I had heard it referenced on that "13 and Pregnant Again" show, thinking of the recipe as an oddity, much like the family from the show. Well, turns out it was a super crowd-pleaser (especially with the short ones), so I suppose I will make it again--just not soon since it's so  fattening. As other reviewers suggested, I cooked the tots first, added a bit of garlic powder to the beef, and added about a cup of cheese over the tots before layering the soup. OH! and if I had it to do over again I would have held the fried onions out until 15 minutes before it was done. I had to foil them to keep them from burning. Overall, good comfort food. Will make again!

I was plesantly suprised at how this turned out. Everyone liked it.  The variations I made were to use 2 lbs lean ground beef and a large, family size can of Cream of Chicken soup.  I prebaked the tater tots as another reviewer suggested, before placing on the casserole.  I did use the french fried onions on top.

A classic that I grew up on - but my 10 & 12 year olds never had.  Although they didn't know what to think (it looks gross) - they loved it!
I added a can of corn and 1/2 bag of cheddar cheese.  Also put the tots on top (I like them crunchy).  Only needs 45 minutes in oven.

This is so easy and it tastes great. The leftovers are easy to heat up and taste even better after the ingredients sit together for a day.

This turned out great, however I used ground turkey. Tastes just like tater tot hot dish should.. and it tastes even better with ketchup.

I made this last night for my family (including my husband who "hates casseroles") and they LOVED it.  I was surprised that the tots disintegrated, because other tot casserole recipes I've made didn't do that - but it was ok - it actually added to the overall yumminess of the dish, and made me realize I could use shredded hashbrowns in a pinch if I didn't have tots.

I did modify slightly - used more meat, added 2 cans (drained) of french style green beans, and topped with cheddar cheese over the french fried onions.  The cheese and onions made this wonderfully cheesy/crispy top layer, that my husband said he'd have loved to eat alone!  It was great.  I highly recommend this dish for anybody with kids!

Very good and super easy to make! I added one can of drained corn and american cheese slices below the potato layer. I didn't thaw the tator tots, and it didn't seem to make any difference. I also upped the amount of pepper as we like a lot of black pepper. 
Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I heard about hotdishes during a message board discussion of regional foods and was curious to try one, so I came here in search of a recipe. I liked this one. It didn't look terrific, but it tasted good. Definitely comfort food. I couldn't find cream of celery soup, so I used two cans of cream of mushroom instead. I also added grated cheddar cheese between the meat and the tater tots (which are known as potato gems here in Australia). With so many salty ingredients, there's definitely no need to add any salt to this dish.

My husband LOVED this!  I added shredded Tillamook cheddar cheese and the onion rings in the last 10 minutes and it was great!  Quick and easy recipe, thanks for sharing it!  We will add scrambled eggs and salsa and have instant breakfast burritos with the leftovers.

I made this last night for my husband and we both loved it! We kept going back for more! I I oven heated the tater-tots before I put them in the dish thus making the whole thing cook in about 35 mins. I used to cans of mushroom instead of the celery and I also omited the onions and salt. A MUST USE AGAIN!

We made this recipe for a homeless shelter our church serves. We are able to use our own recipes, or the one provided for by the church. I didn't have my own or the church recipe, so allrecipes.com saved me. Needless to say, my recipe was different then all the other pans of tator tot hotdish.
I added about 1 cup of cheddar/jack cheese right before adding the french fried onions. All the volunteers loved the dish.  Men in the shelter were coming back for more specifically asking for the one with the cheese.

I liked the taste of this casserole a lot, but I would bake it covered for about 50 minutes then add the french fried onions and then finish baking. The onions got scorched in the first 15 minutes of baking. Otherwise it was very easy to make and my husband liked it as well.

This is a great recipe that you can customize to your taste.  I read dozens of reviews and decided I would sub cream of chicken instead of cream of celery soup. Did use cream of mushroom. I added 1/2 C mild cheddar cheese to the soups, 1 T Worcestershire sauce, 1/2 can cut green beans, small can of corn. For prep, I left the tater tots frozen and place 1/2 the bag on the bottom of dish (sprayed with Pam), added the mixture of soups, meat, veggies, then topped with the rest of the tots. I sprinkled 1/2 C mild cheddar cheese on top.  I left out the french fried onions only because I didn't have them.  Next time I will use them but not the plain variety but the cheesy ones.  My husband had seconds. A definite comfort food perfect for cooler weather.  I also added minced garlic while cooking the meat and onions.

I made it with ground pork, and ground beef.  I like the recipe and my whole family loved it.  I also used half of cream of mushroom,  and half of cream of roasted chicken in our casserole. I also put cheddar and mozzarella in this tater tot dish.  I will try it again for church potlucks and Sunday football.

Preheated oven 400 and cooked tots on a baking sheet while working on meat gravy (~20min). Cooked 1 lb ground pork and part of an onion, added seasonings (½ tsp @: cayenne, garlic powder, paprika, pepper, thyme, Worcestershire; no salt), lowered heat and stirred in one can cr. of mushroom soup and one can milk, turned off after blending. Put several leftover tator tots (hard & dry from fridge) in the bottom of a deep pie plate, poured meat gravy over them, and smoothed mixture w back of spoon. Reduced oven to 350, placed baked tots over meat gravy. Dish was really full so put on top shelf w baking sheet on bottom in case it bubbled over. Baked 30 min, let sit out 10.  Served with fresh cooked green beans. This was a little too spicy for us; also, I don't each much processed food so still on the salty side, can't imagine using another can of soup. I'll make it the same way again, but omit cayenne (spicy) and Worcestershire (because adds salt) or reduce all my seasonings to 1/4 tsp. Hubby gave dish thumbs up, approved technique.

Good recipe!  So fast and easy to make. I used the cream of celery and cream of chicken soups. Skipped the onions on top. I agree the tater tots need to sit on top of the casserole to get crunchy. Adds good texture. Served with creamed peas to add a green vegetable. My husband, who doesn’t care much for tater tots thought it was very tasty and good.

Instead of hamburger I used cooked chicken breast (or dark meat, even rotisserie chicken) cut into small pieces. SO delicious, kids love it!

Being from Wisconsin, this is a hotdish that my family has done for years except for the fried onions.  I tried it that way and is just as good.  The way we make ours is 2 lbs hamburger,  3 cans cream of mushroom, 4 cans of french style green beans drained, 3 cans of mushrooms drained, 1 bag of tater tots, and seasoning with salt/pepper.  Sometimes we replace one can of beans with whole kernel corn, and sometimes add garlic powder.  Fry the burger, in a casserole dish dump the soup/veggies/shrooms/salt/pepper and some a little bit of milk is added too.  After the burger is cooked, drain and add to the mixture, stir and add the tots on top,  the extra tots in the bag we push down into the mixture.  Into the oven 350 for about 45 mins till the tots on top are browned and done how you like.....and then enjoy!....you can add onion too if you don't have picky eaters at home.

Made this with the ingredients as listed, but made a slight change to then order since I love the tots crunchy. Make the meat and onion mixture and mix the cream soups into the meat. Pour this mixture in the pan and cover the whole top with tots. They brown and crisp really well and mixing the soup into the meat keeps it from burning or drying! Great flavor!

I added fresh, blanched green beans layered over the meat and soup mixture in a 9x13 pan. Added about a half cup of milk to the soup to make it mix in better. Slightly thawed the tots by putting them in the microwave for 1 minute. Put tots in a single layer on top and baked for 30 minutes. Sprinkled shredded cheddar and fried onions on top and baked another 15 minutes. Delish!

Used a 7 1/2 x 12 casserole dish.  Had 20 oz. of hamburger and used 3/4 of the bag of tater tots.  Still used 2 cans of soup - cream of mushroom and cheddar cheese - both Healthy Choice, and it was great.  Added 1 can of green beans and about 1 cup of  cooked frozen corn on top of the hamburger.   Also put about 8 oz of cheddar cheese between the hamburger and the veggie layer.  The changes I would make if still using the same size casserole dish would be go ahead and use the full 1 1/2 lbs of hamburger and maybe just a few more veggies.  halfway through baking I topped with crushed Lay's potato chips.  Served with Louisiana Hot Sauce!

I added thin slices cheese on top of the meat and omitted the salt. I added garlic salt to taste while browning the meat. I used healthy request soups as well. Best tator tot casserole I've ever made or had. Great idea to add the onions on top!

Loved this recipe! Add a handful of shredded sharp cheddar to the soup mix.  Also added Garlic & Cayenne Pepper to the meat & onion simmering.  Mix meat mixture into soup before putting into casserole dish.  Put tators on top, but I think next time I will add them into the mixture.  The crunchy onions on top provided the "crunch" that is needed. So So good!!! TY very much.

Ok, for those having meat problems, mix the soup with the meat, THEN put it in the pan. The tots don't need to be wet, they're nice and crispy when used as a topper alone. Also, someone in my family is lactose intolerant, so we followed the recipe and skipped the cheese. Don't worry, it does not need cheese, it's great as-is!

This is an easy Tuesday meal that you can tailor to your tastebuds easily. Reminds me a little of shepherds pie. I mixed up ground beef and ground sausage. 1lb of each. Browned that with onion and garlic. Partially cooked frozen sweet corn and green beans in French onion soup. Mixed that up with the beef and 2 cans cream of mushroom (would have subbed one of the cans with cream of celery if I had it). Added a little bit of onion soup to mixture so it didn't dry out in the oven. Spread that in a 9x13 pan. Sprinkled with pepper.  Covered in cheddar cheese. Topped that with Tator tots. Cooked at 425 20 min till the tots crisped up. Everybody loved and it wasn't too salty. :-) It's the next day and the pan is gone. I forgot the onion crisps but those will be used next time.

We are usually a steak and potato kind of family and don't really like casseroles.  But we had some hamburger to cook up and when we cleaned out the pantry we must have had 20 cans of cream of mushroom soup so I looked up recipes and found this one.  We were pleasantly surprised.  We seasoned the beef with garlic salt, seasoning salt, cayenne pepper and black pepper.  We used 2 cans of the mushroom soup instead of the celery and added a cup of colby cheese to the soup.  We cooked for 30 minutes, sprinkled the french fried onions on top and then baked for another 15.  I was worried that it wouldn't be hot enough as the tater tots were still pretty frozen when we put it in the oven.  But it was nice and hot.  It fed four of us with about 3/4 cup leftover.  It was a hit for lunch!

I love this recipe it is a good "go to" for an easy and comfy dish. I did add sautéed garlic, onions and green peppers to it and little season salt. Didn't thaw out the tator tots so it wouldn't get soggy, as per other reviewers, and worked out great! My three year old, nineteen year old and husband loved it!!

Good, comforting dish; I omitted the salt, and it was just fine.  After browning the meat and onions, I added the soups, 1/2 of the still-frozen tots, and some frozen veggies and allowed them to simmer for a few minutes.  I layered that in the dish with the other tots and onion rings.  This simmering cut the baking time in half!

This was good but not amazing.  I added garlic to the beef while browning. It was nice comfort food but didn't have a ton of flavor. I think it needed some additional seasoning (but not sure what...)

This dish is amazing. I used ground chicken (seasoned with s&p) as well as a can of cream of broccoli soup instead of the celery, and added a package of frozen broccoli as well as a package of sharp cheddar cheese. It's SO filling and GREAT leftover!!

This was great. I followed some of the other reviewer suggestions.  I added a can of cheddar cheese soup and about 3/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  I also used ground turkey. I skipped the fried onion topping. Yum!  My picky son loved it.

I used the base of this recipe for my hot dish, but I altered it a bit based on other reviews. I added a bag of steam veggies with corn, pea, beans and carrots and also 2 stalks of celery finely chopped. Also, instead of using cream of mushroom or celery I used 2 cans of cheddar cheese soup. I think next time I'd add another can of soup though because mine turned out a bit dry. Otherwise, it was delicious!

I was looking very forward to this after all the reviews, and ended up rather disappointed.  Mine turned out very salty, and I didn't even add salt, just pepper.  I did add an extra can of cheddar soup, as others recommended, and mixed the soups with the ground beef.  But other than that, no extra ingredients or changes.  Maybe it's because I'm a southern girl and not used to this type of food, but the whole family (including my 16 month-old) ate up the sides (peas and carrots) and left the main dish almost untouched.

This is an amazing staple recipe!!  I did do as one reviewer suggested and used one can cream of mushroom, one can cream of mushroom and chicken and one can cheddar cheesse soup and about 1 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese also, but this was the best and every member of my family cleaned their plate.  Thanks!

My family loved it!  I added corn, garlic, paprika, chili powder and season all to the meat.  Added milk and replaced Cream of celery with cream of cheddar, and it was really good.  I think the seasoning helped give it some flavor, cause i can see it being bland without it.  I also added shredded cheddar to the soup mix and the tator tots on top.  My boyfriend doesn't like crispy onions, so for added crisp, having the tators on top made it a good medium.    I also had it for lunch a couple of days later, and it was even better, just like good comfort food should be.

This was good and easy! I didn't change a thing in the recipe.  I just let my dish bake a few minutes less because my oven usually cooks food faster. My sister and I enjoyed it.

I give this recipe a four star.  The family like this but I did add a few things.  I added Garlic Plus seasoning.  I used Nacho Cheese instead of plain cheddar, substituted Cream of Mushroom soup because I couldn't find the frozen vegatables with cheese.  I pre-cooked my broccoli & carrots.  Tossed them into the chicken after I added the soup.  Great base recipe.  I will keep this to use again.  Thanks for the recipe

Normally I don't care for Tater Tot Hot Dish. But the Cheddar cheese soup and the garlic powder made a bland dish into something I really liked and will make it again.

Very good for an easy, surprisingly tasty dinner.  I like to put my tater tots on the bottom and pour about 1/2 cup of KETCHUP over them.  Then I mix the ground beef (cooked with a little onion, garlic and green pepper, and seasoned with salt, pepper, paprika and cayenne) with the crm of mush and crm of celery and about 3/4 cup of milk... along with a can of corn.  I didn't use the french fried onions, but I sprinkled the top with shredded cheddar.  My boyfriend does not get too excited about this "midwest" sort of fare, but he actually really liked it... and went back for seconds!

This is a very satisfying comfort food that really invokes that classic hotdish flavor.  With ideas from the other reviewers and a few of my own, I made some modifications.  On ingredients I used 2 lbs of ground beef, a few handfuls of frozen vegetable medley (peas, carrots, green beans, and corn), cheddar cheese, and I omitted the french onions.  I layered a few (maybe 1/4 of the bag) tater tots on the bottom for integrated tot flavor, then I added the ground beef/onion layer, then the vegetable layer, then the cheese layer, then the soup layer, and finally topped it off with the remaining tater tots.  It turned out really well, and I would definitely make it again.

This recipe was great with a few alterations. First I baked the tots 20 minutes. After I browned the ground beef with onions, garlic powder and black pepper, I added approx half of the soup mixture and milk (I used one cream of mushroom and one cream of chicken because that's what I had handy) Then I mixed the rest of the soup mixture along with a cup of mild cheddar and a little pepper into the tots. I spread the ground beef mixture on the bottom of my baking pan and then spread the tator tot mixture on top. I baked it up until it was golden brown and bubbly, but I left off the french fried onions. It was absolutely great. Note: no need to add any salt, I think the soup had just enough

I made this dish, it was good for the most part.  I added a clove of garlic with the onion and added some cheddar cheese with the soups.  It was good, but it was a little salty for my taste.  Other than that, I would make it again.

Excellent kid friendly recipe.  I also added garlic powder to the ground meat and a layer of shredded cheddar cheese over the tater tots before I added the soup mixture.  Will definitely make this again.

This was great!  I used moose burger and added a handful of cheese.  Next time I would omit the extra salt if I use cheese- even so the whole pan was devoured.  So far everyone that has tasted this has asked for the recipe, more proof that it's delicious!

I loved this recipe! My husband also commented that he liked it! It was very flavorful and easy to make. I did use 2 cans of cream of celery because I do not like mushrooms. I also added cheese on top of the meat - under the Tate tots- and then some on top with the French fried onions. This will definitely be in my regular rounds of dinners. Thanks for sharing it with me!

I made a smaller portion of this recipe for my husband and I. I also used some suggestions and took 1/2 of the soup mix and added it to the meat until well blended. Then with the other 1/2 of the soup I added some milk to make it more creamy then added it on top of the tater tots.  I added a little chdr chz to the dish too. Served with a side of mixed veggies, its a keeper.

I changed this recipe slightly. On top of the meat layer I put some spinach,feta cheese and cheddar. The soup mixture:I added to it 1 can of milk for more moistness and I omitted the salt. My husband Loved this recipe and asked to save it. He never does that!

This casserole was very good and easy to prepare.  I was a bit concerned about lack of flavor, so I added a bit of worcestershire sauce and steak sauce to the beef and onions.  I also added about a tbsp of ketchup to the soup mixes and added 1 1/2 cups shredded cheddar which I layered over the meat, topped with potatoes and then soup.  I may add the french fried onions a bit later on next time, they got a bit brown and some burnt.

I make a similar cassarole: with cheddar between the tots and meat. It's always fantastic, and really easy.

This recipe was surprisingly good. My husband absolutely loved it. I have made it twice so far and none of it has gone to waste. It was real easy to make and I made it just like the recipe says. It's also a great comfort food.

This dish was pretty good. Both my kids like it, and my daughter is super picky. I think the meat itself needed a little extra flavor, next time I make it I'll have to work on that. All in all it was good, not great, but good. I'll probably make this one again, only a little different.

Very good taste.  I may use a little less milk next time so it gets a little thicker.  Also, I might broil for a few minutes at the end to get the tater tots a little crispier.

My family loved this.  My husband keeps requesting it for dinner.  The first time I made it I added about 1/2 cup sour cream, but the second time I didn't and I don't use the onions or the topping b/c we don't like onions much.  Great recipe!

This was very easy and good.  My husband, daughter and I all thought it was good.  I didn't season the meat, and I used lower sodium soups.  I also added cheese between the meat and tots.  This will be added as an "occasional" recipe.

Just tried this one last night to rave reviews from all.  Definitely a keeper.
Modified a bit by putting grated Mozza-Cheddar blend on 1/2 for the cheese lovers in the family mmmm.

My family loved this recipe!  I didn't add the fried onions on the top, and had corn as a side dish.  Great easy dish to make!

Another one my kids didn't like, but I've got the world's pickiest eaters living in my house.  I gave it good scores in every area but that one, but wouldn't be surprised if lots of other kids really enjoy it.

This recipe was great and very simple to make.  Instead of using the can of fried onions (which my brother-in-law doesn't like) I made my own oinon rings from a recipe I found on this site and added them.  I never seem to have any leftovers considering this makes a good portion.
