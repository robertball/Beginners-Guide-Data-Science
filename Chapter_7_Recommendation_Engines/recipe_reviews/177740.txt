Excellent recipe, very easy to prepare and came out great. Could be a little better with some extra herbs and spices thrown in though.

I've made this recipe a few times...The first "as is" and then tinkering with it a bit.  Here are the changes that I would recommend:  1.)  Use chicken broth instead of vegetable broth - especially if you are using this dish to accompany poultry.  2.)  Add 2 chicken boullion cubes when you add the broth.  This gives the dish the extra needed flavor.  My family loves it - thank you!

Other reviewers' criticisms of this recipe, that it lacked seasoning, was exactly what I liked about it! I was serving a spicier entree, blackened fish, and wanted a rice dish that was   more subtle in flavor than the fish, but that still had a little more flavor and presentation quality than just plain rice.  This was perfect! Exactly what I had in mind. Pretty and colorful, delicately flavored, with a pleasant nuttiness from the wild rice, this was the ideal side dish to complement a spicier meat or fish.

This is a great side dish for fish. It's also a great starting point to add whatever herbs and spices you desire. I added 1 tsp. basil and 1/2 tsp. thyme, as well as salt and pepper. I also used chicken broth. The cooking time and amount of liquid were just right since the wild rice came out nice and tender. One thing the recipe does not mention is that you should always rinse the wild rice before cooking it.

I love this savory pilaf! It went great with the Cornish game hens I served for Easter dinner. I would have given this 5 stars, but I had to doctor it slightly. The chopped veggies added color and rounded out the texture and flavor. (I chopped up some mushrooms along with the carrots, celery, and onion.) Also, I used chicken broth as per other suggestions. I knew it would be a little too bland, especially from what other reviewers said, so I added 1/2 tsp. salt, 1/2 tsp dried tarragon, 1/4 tsp. dried thyme, a few dashes of cumin, and a few grinds from my pepper mill. I'll be making this again--a hearty, satisfying, versatile side dish!

Excellent rice, everyone enjoyed this one. I put all the vegetables in food processor to make it faster and really get it chopped up. 1-2-3 it was very easy to make, and got requests to have it again. Great flavor. >^..^

Perfect blend of flavor and color. To those who thought it too bland, PILAF means rice cooked in seasoned broth. It should be rated for what it is, not criticized for what it isn't.

This has great potential but lacks a bit of seasoning, I used chicken broth instead of veggie broth figuring that would help but it wasn't enough.  I also added thyme garlic and onion powder.  I will have to play with this recipe.

I thought this recipe was great.  I didn't think it was bland at all.  Rice traditionally isn't a grain that needs extra flavor, in my opinion.  The only changes I would make are to add salt and pepper.  I also use vegetable or chicken broth interchangeably.

We liked this pilaf a lot. On its own it was a teeny bit bland, but it complimented the spiciness of "Blackened tuna steaks with mango salsa" recipe (from this site also) perfectly! Also, it is an interesting change from plain white rice, and contains many veggies, which is good for you. A winner!

Very good dish! I wanted a rice pilaf dish that was more subtle and light in flavor for the bbq chicken kabobs I was serving tonight, but that still had a nice presentation than just the plain ole' white rice we normally eat. I used a little red, orange and green bell peppers, chopped. I sauteed red onions with garlic in olive oil then added the carrots and peppers. I had a 16 oz. bag of Hinode White and Wild Rice that I picked up for $3.00. I stirred that in the pot along with the vegetable broth. I seasoned with a little salt and black pepper to taste. This was the perfect side dish! It was noticeably pretty and colorful, and it was delicately flavored. All of the vegetables rounded out the texture. The ingredients, directions and cooking time were approximate. I served this side dish alongside, "Rosemary Ranch Chicken Kabobs," also from this website.

This fits the bill perfectly.  My son had been wanting some pilaf, so I went looking for a wild rice pilaf that didn't use brown rice.  Left out the carrots and celery, but added mushrooms.  Used chicken broth instead of the vegetable broth.  The family raved about it.  Nice addition to my repertoire.  Thank you for sharing!

I too made this to go with some blackened fish, and I loved it. It had just enough flavor but didn't take anything away from the meat. I liked the chunks of carrots and celery as well. Looks pretty good, tastes even better.

I read a few of the reviews about different broths and and adding a bouillon cube.  I added a beef cube to the 3.5 cups of broth (one veggie, one chicken).  I believe it turned out awesome.  Both my husband and I will make this again!  We did use the food processer to shred up the veggies, but the next time we will just use the food chopper.

A very nice side with a spicy entree.  I used 2 cups chicken broth, 1.5 cup water.  I also omitted the carrots.  Living in Minnesota you have to have a good wild rice recipe.  ;)

This is a really yummy recipe!  I saute the veggies in a pan for 5-8 minutes then I transfer it to a rice cooker and finish it in there! I have swapped out the veggie broth with chicken and beef depending on what I serve it with. It is really good.

I am giving it only one star because it was very, very bland.  I feel when one has to add a lot to make the recipe taste good, the recipe is a flop. I added different seasoning from my pantry and with the sauce from my Chicken Ham  Tomato bake it  was fine.  But I feel I shouldn't have had to do that.  After reading all the reviews it seems most  people thought it was  bland and needed more seasoning also, but they gave it more stars.

I used the advise of the other reviewers and this Pilaf was fantastic.  Very easy.  I only had cooked wild and white rice on hand, so after I sauted the vegetables I added in the cooked rice and about 3/4 cup of chicken stock, let the stock cook off and it was perfect.  My entire family loved it.  Served it with a proscuitto wrapped stuffed chicken breast with herbed goat cheese.

Delicious and a welcome change from the usual side dish.  Like many others I also substituted chicken broth.  In addition I added some poultry seasoning (about 1 tsp) and fresh ground black pepper towards the end of the cooking time.  It was great with turkey breast.  Nice enough for dinner guests.

This is a nice classic pilaf, I liked it a lot. I scaled to 4 servings and used about 3/4 of a green bell pepper.  Never could taste the pepper, so next time I'll either skip it altogether or add more.  I used chicken broth instead of vegetable, and used brown Jasmine instead of white rice. In pilafs I always like to saute the raw rice with the vegetables for a few minutes before adding the liquid,  It seems to give it a better texture and better separation when the grains are lightly coated in oil.  Because both rices needed a a long cooking time I put them both in the sauce pan at the same time.  Turned out they needed longer to cook, I think a little more then an hour. Mushrooms and toasted almonds would be great in this. I'm happy with this one, it made for a nice side dish to pork tenderloin.

Tasty recipe! I'm not a big carb or rice fan but this was a winning side dish with my salmon.

I didn't have all the ingredients and used a few substitutions to make this dish last minute. 

i stirred in a creamy veg "cup of soup" after boiling the wild rice and then added the heated carrots, onions, and garlic.

yumm!

Excellent!  I made as written expect I omitted the parsley and used chicken broth instead of vegi.  I think next time I'll use half chicken and half vegi because the chicken broth flavor was very strong.

Excellent.  I had never made rice pilaf before, and this was yummy.  Instead of just regular wild/white rice, I used the uncle ben's box of wild and long grain rice, and the seasonings (mostly because others said this was a bland dish) it worked out nicely.

This was a very good dish.  I used homemade chicken broth and added extra seasonings to it.  Even my picky eater at home ate it!!

I really like this recipe, of course with a few minor changes.  I added Laurel leaves, onion soup package and curry.  It goes perfect with grilled vegetable- I am vegan-.  This is a perfect and tasty recipe, try it and thank you for sharing.......

Really needs more spices. If you're using this as a side-dish for a much spicier dish it's a good choice.

Like some others I think this is a very very bland dish. I even added extra garlic salt and pepper and it was still bland. If you are not one to experiment with flavora and diff herbs and spices to give it flavor this is not for you. Although if you are looking for a rice dish to possibly put a sauce on or something of that kind this is it. Oh yes and I wouldn't reccommend dobling this recipe as this makes a ton. I will check back to see what others came up with with regards to brining this dish more flavor. Thanx for the recipe

Really loved this recipe!!!  The reason I gave it a four is I also added a lot to it  but the measurements and proportions were perfect. I used chicken both even though I eat a 90% vegan direct. I also juice so had tons of veggies in the fridge which lessons the carb count to this dish. But the fresh parsley and sliced almonds were a perfect touch to this recipe. This was our main course so I server it with quinoa flat bread.  This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing!!!!

Both DH and 18-year old son really liked this.  They said it might not have been as good on its own but it paired really well the Easy Garlic Broiled Chicken (from this site) and made the meal terrific.  Modifications:  used 1 tbsn butter instead of olive oil.  Added 2 finely chopped mushrooms.  Added 1 tspn better than boullion (chicken) to low sodium no fat chicken broth.  I sauted the vegies until the shrooms reduced (maybe 10 min) then added half of the liquid and the wild rice.  Let simmer for 30 minutes.  Then added remaining liquid and white rice and let simmer for another 20 minutes.  I probably let it simmer without the lid for about 5 minutes at the end.  Stirred in about 4 tbsn toasted slivered almonds before serving.

Simply wonderful! I loved the taste! It was great hit at a dinner party I served this at. I used a pressure cooker to cook my white rice (I used Basmati rice). I also had a packet of precooked wild rice. I used vegetable broth from The Fresh Market. I also sprinkled salt and pepper into the pilaf.

I used 3/4 cup of each rice as I wanted more wild rice - good thing I did as the white rice ended up a bit mushy. I also used chicken broth and added slivered almonds.  Tasted great!

This was a great recipe!  I substituted Quinoa for the white rice and it turned out even better.  If you haven't worked with Quinoa before, it has a complete protein so this can be a whole meal for vegetarians.  So tasty!

Amazing! It smelled so wonderful while cooking and tasted even better once it was done.  It was a perfect side item for rosemary lamb chops in a balsamic reduction.

I used a brown/wild rice blend for this dish and toasted the rice with the onions and garlic. I added a little rosemary as well, but it was still very bland. However, this worked well as I served it under Grilled Adobo Chicken and drizzled with the sauce.

Great basic pilaf recipe however just two suggestions - pre-soaking the wild rice will help it cook better. I also add a bit of herb seasoning (Epicure) for flavour.

I prepared this with some fish and it turned out great. I had to use chicken stock in place of the vegetable broth and it worked out fine. I did add some salt to taste as well since my chicken stock was unsalted. Will be making this again. Thanks!

Very easy and tasty for what it is.  I did take others suggestions to simmer in chicken broth.
This is a very acceptable side for more savory dishes

Made this for a church meal for about 60 people.  Made my own broth using celery, carrots, garlic, and chicken thighs. I only added carrots and celery to the dish and it turned out great! Looked just like the picture! I would definitely make it again but add more chicken flavor, maybe some bouillon. I love the nutty favor of the wild rice.  I wonder how it would be using brown rice instead of the white.... hummmm.

This recipe was fantastic. I've been on healthy journey and this was a great meal to start off a great year. I didn't use the entire onion or the entire two garlic gloves, but everything else I used completely. I did add a little extra seasoning that consisted of onion powder, garlic powder and some salt. Everything was perfect and my picky family even enjoyed it. I can't wait to make this tasty meal again!!!

I deviated from the recipe a little so I could use my rice cooker. Less babysitting that way. I bought a wild rice mix from the bulk foods at Winco, so I just put mine in the rice cooker with a couple of bouillon cubes for flavor. I cut up the celery, onion, carrots and sauted them with a splash of oil and some garlic, keeping the veggies firm. I then added a bunch of chopped green onions and zucchini toward the end, just barely letting the zuc soften. When the rice was done I combined it with the veggies, and my family loved it. I think it could use a few shakes of basil and oregano but they liked it as is!

Great rice pilaf!  Subtle flavors, just like rice pilaf should be.  I used homemade chicken broth to keep the sodium down and added fresh mushrooms.  This paired well with a spicy seasoned grilled chicken breast and garlic, rosemary, and butter sugar snap peas.  The whole family loved it!  Thanks for posting!

This rice turned out wonderful!  I used 3/4 cup jasmine rice and 3/4 cup wild rice. I had no broth, so I made some using 3 1/2 cups water and 5 bullion cubes, since other reviewers mentioned using more.I didn't use carrots, because I had none, and I used only 1/2 stalk celery. I sprinkled in some cilantro and 2 dashes of Chinese 5 Spice. I'll definitely make it again!

I thought it was good. Based on other reviews I added additional seasonings. I used some tarragon and cumin.

I added chicken bullion to the broth, and it was quite flavorful.  One problem, there is too much liquid for my preference.  Perhaps it was b/c I used the rice cooker to make this dish after I sauteed the veggies.

This dish was amazing. I took the advice of others and added two chicken bouillon cubes. It made it a bit salty, but the flavor was absolutely delicious. My family has a similar recipe for thanksgiving that is a wild rice stuffing, made in a very similar fashion, but this is a much cheaper method. Will definitely be making this pretty often. Super easy!

Made this with beef broth. It was delish. Needs a lot more liquid than called for, though. Maybe next time would add a dash of red chillies or hot paprika.

This is really good. Taking the advice of other reviewers, I used low-sodium chicken broth in lieu of water. I also added about a tablespoon of dried porcini mushrooms to the broth when I was cooking the wild rice.

Very good!   Like others said, it does need some seasoning...but that's it.  I did use a mix of brown and wild rice along with the white rice.  Will make again..thanks!

Going by what other reviewers said, I added some extra seasonings - garlic salt and onion powder and 2 all-natural veggie bouillon cubes.  The flavor was great!  I was looking for a gluten free pilaf and was happy this turned out so well.  Just keep in mind that the wild rice has a much more dense texture to it.  If you're not expecting that crunchiness, you might be disappointed!

LOVE that I found a great wild rice pilaf recipie!! However, I was prepared to doctor it a bit after reading reviews about it being a tad bland.  All I did different was to use chicken broth instead of veggie, and simply added a packet of onion soup mix at the same time I added the broth.  I was delicious...even my 10 yr old loved it!!  I did cut the amount of onion in half as well in order to compensate for the onion soup.

This was pretty bland, but definitely edible. Actually, it was kind of nice that it was bland because I put some of the cooked marinade on top (from the steak we had for dinner) and it tasted good after that.

I loved this recipe. I used a boxed white and wild rice that came with a spice packet, as well as the other ingredients listed here. It turned out amazing.
