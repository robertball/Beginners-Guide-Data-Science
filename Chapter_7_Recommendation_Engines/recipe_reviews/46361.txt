This is a great sauce!  My husband and children loved it, even with it being just a little spicy.  It is great for those who love garlic, and a rich, fresh taste.

I halved the recipe and added 2 cans of tomato paste instead of 1-1/2, and also added a pinch or 2 of cinnamon.  This would make a good pizza sauce or could be used in lasagna as well, I'd think.  Definitely a keeper!

Well, I don't think this tastes like chef boyardee, but I didn't like it. More like a barbecue sauce than spaghetti sauce. In fact, if you made some minor ingredient changes I think you'd have a wicked sauce for ribs chicken. This would be a great Cinncinati (sp?) chili sauce too. The allspice and cloves add a different flavor.

Pretty good and easy.  I added ground beef.  My husband likes smooth spaghetti sauce and this worked for him.

I agree with the last reviewer - this absolutely tastes like Chef Boyardee. I even added the meat and to no avail.

Sorry - didn't like this.  I thought the allspice would be more subtle but it ended up being too strong for my tastes.  It did have a sort of "tang" to it, but not the kind I like.

My whole family loves this sauce.  I first made it six months ago and used it in lasagna.  Now we use it for any time we need a tomato sauce.  Every one who tries it comments on how wonderful it is.

The flavor was yummy!  It wasn't chunky enough for me, so next time, I'm going to try adding some veggies and meat!
