I loved it!  However, I did add 1/4 cup more milk and 1 tbsp more oil (I think it should resemble a cake batter when all is mixed together).  Also did 3/4 cup of cocoa because I like it chocolately!  And, lastly, I used 1/2 tsp salt and will use a bit more next time around.  It is pretty hard to toothpick-test something with chocolate chips because the toothpick can come out wet even if the batter is done, so I just recommend that you cook for 25 minutes and it should come out as perfect as mine did!  Great recipe -- thanks so much!

I followed the recipe exactly, baked them for exactly 20 minutes, took them to a function, and they disappeared in 15 minutes. Awesome recipe.

I just made these this morning and they are wonderful!  I did make a few adjustments however.  I substituted whole wheat flour for AP, omitted the nuts, used mini chocolate chips.  I also substituted 2 tbsp of pumpkin puree for the oil, this not only cuts the fat almost completely out but helps the batter to have more body.  It made 17 good sized muffins.

The muffins were great! Very easy to make and lovely to eat, considering this is only my third attempt at baking! Everyone loved them! I also took the advice of SukeyNY and used the following: 
1.5 cups of milk, 3 tbsp of oil, 3/4 cup of cocoa and 1/2 tsp salt. Also, we made a mistake when purchasing the ingredients and got chopped almonds instead of whole ones, so we used a 1/2 cup of chopped walnuts + 1/3 cup of chopped almonds in addition to the chocolate chips. The muffins tasted wonderful anyway, and richer besides. We also forgot to sprinkle the sugar before baking, but reading the other reviews, I guess that's just as well. With all the extras, this recipe can yield at LEAST 16 muffins. We made 12 anyway by filling the muffin cups to the top so they were HUGE and lopsided but very moist. I hope this helped!

Good overall flavor.  First, this made 20 regular sized muffins.  Also, many reviewers stated that their chocolate chips sank to bottom of muffin; to resolve this issue dust chocolat chips with 1T flour.  For those who think this is a dry muffin, check your cocoa.  If it's dark or dutch cocoa you should add extra dairy fat (think sour cream) since chocolate, especially dark and dutch, will absorb the fat content in a recipe and dry it out (also the milk should not be skim or low fat).  Also, if you omit the nuts this too will dry out the recipe as nuts add / help maintain moisture.  That being said, I used 1 1/2 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat, and 1 T oil plus 1T applesauce.  Since I use a cocoa which is half semi-sweet / half dutch I added 2 t sour cream (double that if your cocoa is not a combo).  My milk was 2%, but whole milk would've been a better option. Also, do not overcook.  I baked 20 minutes and removed IMMEDIATELY from pan to help end residual baking.  My muffins were chocolately and moist.  The family really enjoyed.  Better than store bought.  P.S. For high altitude I reduced the baking powder by 1/2 t; this helps with over rising which leads to a deflated end product.

Whoa.  Careful with these, don't eat 'em for breakfast, or you'll experience something akin to Death By Chocolate.  These are for 'after' a meal, or an afternoon snack. I put a green M&M on top of each because as everyone knows, they are a very strong aphrodisiac. I give these muffins five stars.

This is our favorite chocolate chocolate chip muffin recipe!  I omit the nuts (kiddo doesn't like them), and increased the eggs to two instead of one.  I usually double the recipe and freeze them.  They are FABULOUS warmed up in the microwave!  Thanks so much for this recipe!

I followed the exact ingredients, except for spilling some extra vanilla extract in by accident....it turned out really delicious. very fluffy and the chocolate chips in the center were perfect.

These are great!  We don't like nuts and I was out of chocolate chips and they still tasted wonderful.  Can't wait to try them with the chocolate chips next time.

In all fairness, these probably deserve 5 stars, but they came out kind of dry.  Not sure what I did wrong.  I followed most ingredients listed however made the following modifications:  3/4 tsp salt, 1 1/2 cup (fat free) milk, 2 eggs, 3 tbsp canola oil, pecans (no walnuts or almonds on hand).  I think I made a mistake in using fat free milk, and I think some butter and maybe even applesauce should be in there somewhere.  I will re-make and update my review in the future.

Great Recipe!
I tried it with wrappers and without and both were fine. I sprayed the pan and had no sticking.
Decorative wrappers always need to be sprayed cause they will stick regardless. 
Just a side note on the applesauce comment. Yes, it was for sure the applesauce that will make them heavy.  Apple Sauce is a horrible substitute for oil! Sour cream or yogurt works great. Try that instead.
If your baked goods sink, simple problem.
Wasn't baked long enough.
As far as the choc. chips sinking. Add Half your flour mixture into the wet mixture. Then add the choc. Chips to the remaining flour mixture whisk together. Then add to the wet batter. No more sinking chips!
Hope these tips help!

I think these were very good.  Batter made more than 12 muffins, so I made 18 muffins and one mini loaf of bread.  I am so happy with how they turned out (I followed recipe exactly)  I think this will become a favorite recipe for mini gift loaves.

Very yummy and chocolaty but a tiny bit dry. When I bake muffins I usually preheat the oven 25 degrees higher than instructed but when I put the muffins in the oven I lower the temperature to the recommended temperature. That makes the muffins rise earlier while baking.

I followed the recipe exactly and the flavor of these muffins was very poor ~ bland and unpleasant at the same time!  I am not sure if it was something I did inadvertently or if this muffin just wasn't my cup of tea... my kids didn't like them either.  Sorry!

I made a few of the adjustments that other suggested.  I'm not sure how to describe how these came out...  Maybe tough?  Chewy?  The texture of them was odd, and I thought they were a little too sweet and a little too chocolatey for a muffin.  Next time I make them, I will not do the adjustments and see how they turn out.  My muffins also collapsed in the middle, I'm thinking I may have overmixed them.  To avoid that next time, I will mix the wet into the dry instead of the dry into the wet.  I find it easier to do without overmixing.

I think this is more a cupcake than a muffin, based on the texture.  I only used 1 cup of brown sugar and they were sweet enough.  I also added a heaping tbs of instant coffee granules to enhance the chocolate flavor.  I made 10 slightly larger than normal muffins and they were nice and moist.  I omitted the nuts and sugar topping and neither were missed.  Warm they stuck to the paper lines but that wasn't an issue once they cooled.  Thanks for sharing.

I actually left out the nuts in this recipe because I was making them for toddlers, but they were still delicious.  We actually made ours into spiders for halloween by putting icing and M&Ms on their backs and giving them little strips of fruit leather for legs.  We made the faces out of chocolate.  the kids loved them - also good to know is that we made them the day before and they were still delicious, we were even eating them on the third day.

I made these exactly as written.  Firstly, the taste was wonderful.  Moist and chocolately.  Cons:  they domed and then collasped leaving a nasty top crust and chips did sink to bottom.  I used regular muffin tins and came out with 18, so either a) they were meant to be baked in larger muffin sized tins or b) there's too much baking powder in batter.  They simply couldn't hold the weight of the batter.  I'll definately try again - first using the larger muffin tins and if that doesn't work, will try reducing the bp or increasing the fat content as others have done.  UPDATE:  So so sorry - just too hard to try to adapt recipe to prevent the top from caving in...

These were edible, but not very tasty and turned out dry.  I should have known that it did not seem like enough oil for muffins.  I would not make these again.

I used SukeyNY's adjustments and omitted all the nuts because I can't stand nuts in my baked goods. I also used lactose-free milk and was slightly short on vanilla, but it didn't seem to matter.  These were delicious! I made a pan of 12 regular sized muffins and a pan of 24 mini muffins. Baked the former for 20 minutes and the latter for about 13 I believe - set the timer for 20 but kept an eye on them to make sure and ended up taking them out early.   My first bite made me think it wasn't chocolatey enough, but as I kept eating I found myself taking that back. By the end of my taste-test muffin I was very satisfied with its chocolate content. The texture is nice, not crazy moist but not dry either.

YUMMY! I just made these this morning. I didn't have semi-sweet chips, so I used milk chocolate chips. Nice. I will use semi-sweet next time so the tangy flavor of the chocolate chips is more noticeable. I will be making these all winter & experimenting with different flavors of chips.

I made this recipe without the nuts, since I didn't have any. Like a previous reviewer, I upped the cocoa content to 3/4 cup and a bit more oil. They were devine! I baked them for 20 minutes, I think 25 minutes would have been too long.  This recipe is a keeper! Perfection!

I willl never buy chocolate chip muffins again from the store! This recipe is too awesome! I made this for my family of five (three kids) which one of them are not crazy about chocolate. HE loved it! My husband asked me after the mufffins were gone, when I will make them again! ;-) Thanks for submitting a wonderful recipe. Also, I omitted the recipe and used mini chocolate chips. For some reason mines kept sinking to the bottom when using regular sized ones. But perhaps I am adding it at the wrong time. Either way, these muffins still came out great!

I can't believe how many people have rated this and then pointed out that they haven't even used the  bleedin' recipe!   I've followed this recipe to the letter twice now and absolutely LOVE it!  I've also done it loads without the nuts and have used chocolate chunks instead of chips a few times.  It's very versatile and so long as you don't over cook (did this once and the muffins didn't burn but they were rather dry), they are beautifully moist.  Thanks so much for this recipe!  This is the first time I've succeeded in making chocolate muffins as other recipes have resulted in chocolate scented bricks!

These were the easiest muffins I've made in awhile. I didn't have choc. chips,so I added dried cherries instead and dusted them with powdered sugar hot from the oven. Friends love them!

Very moist. I did not change the recipe except I used dark cocoa instead of regular (I'm a huge fan of dark chocolate) and left out the nuts (I'm not a fan of nuts at all).  I made 12 regular size muffins and still had tons left so I had to make a pan of mini muffins as well. Very yummy.  I gave it only 4 stars because they stuck to my non-stick pan which I even sprayed with Pam.  All the chocolate chips sunk to the bottom of the muffins and that is why they stuck.  Definitely use muffin papers if you make these.

Made these as written, but did leave out the nuts, as my husband doesn't like them. I tried them fresh from the oven and I was worried, I thought they were awfully dry. Didn't serve them until the next day, and they were better, but still a little dry. Good with a glass of milk or cup of coffee.

Delicious recipe.  I made bread instead of muffins.  Decreased sugar to one cup and increased oil to 1/4 cup.  Very moist.  Will definitely make again  So good with my morning coffee.

After reading the reviews about the chips sinking to the bottom, I added them to the flour mixture before adding the wet.  That is supposed to stop the sinkage.  But it didn't.  The bottoms are basically pure chocolate chips.  The tops did not rise but mushed out around the edges of the cake papers.  I think the taste was good but something needs to be tweaked.  I'm just not sure what.

these came out perfect! the chocolate explosion you get in your mouth from these is like no other! very very rich & the only think i changed was that i used dutch cocoa powder (because i had no unsweetened one available) & i didn't sprinkle sugar on top. i would recommend chopping the almonds & toasting them (as i did) & placing some walnuts on top before baking. delicious recipe thank you!

Scaled for 18; made as directed, except omitted nuts due to preference. Love them!!! Made 26 regular-sized muffins, some slightly bigger, some smaller. Just wish they weren't so calorific! :) Might try subbing stuff out next time. Thanks bunches for a great recipe!

Delicious, super-chocolatey muffins! I do recommend increasing the milk to 1 1/2 cups, this gave me muffins that were more moist. As always, don't mix that muffin batter too much! 20 minutes in my oven and they were perfectly done. My brother ate 3 in one sitting! Thanks for sharing :)

I followed the recipe almost exactly (I did substitute baking splenda for the sugar to reduce calories). I made jumbo muffins and the batter was exactly enough to make six of them. They did come out a little dry but I put the timer on for 25 minutes because I thought jumbo would take longer and they were probably done in 20 minutes, also maybe the splenda changed something. They were not chocolately enough for me (but we're talking about someone who gets hot fudge sundaes with death by chocolate ice cream, and crushed Oreos. So no surprise there). I also didn't find them to be super dense like other reviewers said, I was looking forward to dense... But overall my way was a 3 and if I weren't a recovering chocoholic it would be a 4, so that was my rating.

This recipe made way too much batter for 12 regular-sized muffin cups. As a result, I overfilled them, and they ended up taking a lot longer to cook. I realize now that I should have just made more than 12. Anyway, the muffins turned out yummy.

These were really cupcakes, not muffins, judging from the batter consistency and smooth domed tops! Changes I made: reduced sugar to 1&1/4 cups, added 1/2 tsp salt, used 1&1/2 cups of milk, 3 tbsp of oil, and used my own combo of pine nuts, chocolate chips, and dried cranberries. Also didn't sprinkle sugar on top. These were quite moist and a little dense. Again, a cupcake, not a muffin, even with reduced sugar amounts!

I just made these and they are perfect!!  Still sitting in the muffin tray, they are warm and moist!  Supersoft and delicious.  I followed everything on the recipe except i ran out of milk, but had some whipping cream, so used that instead.  I know that must really add to the fat, but it makes a wonderful muffin!!

This recipe needed a bit more salt than the 1/4 tsp. Overall, good recipe. I discovered I was out of cupcake liners, so I poured the batter into loaf pans instead. I baked it a little longer, and they came out perfectly.

Surprised by the number of reviews. I thought these were just ok. The submitter must have used jumbo muffin tins. I used regular and got 20 muffins. Mine didnt rise very high and I didnt think they were especially chocolatey. I'll keep looking for a really good double chocolate recipe.

I was attracted to this recipe for it's low fat content; I've been looking for a nice breakfast muffin that I can enjoy without lots of guilt (and I LOVE chocolate).  The recipe as is, is great!   I did the following for less fat and sugar and absolutely loved these muffins: rather than 2 T oil, I used 1 T oil and 2 T of low fat plain yogurt, 1/2 C sugar and 3/4 C stevia by the cup (the kind of stevia you measure like sugar), and omitted the nuts and sugar on top.  These are wonderful muffins - and it definitely fills my chocolate craving with low fat and low sugar.   Thanks for a great posting!!!!

I knew even before cooking that these would be wonderful, because the batter consistency was superb! I left out the nuts, but otherwise measured everything EXACTLY, and they are great!

I followed another reviewer's advice and add 1/4 cup milk and one tablespoon more of oil and 1/4 cup more of cocoa but the chips sank to the bottom...=(  Next time I am omitting the chips because this was chocolaty enough!

They were "ok". Needed more chocolate in them - next time I might melt a 1/2 cup of chips and add to the batter in addition to the whole cup of chips.

My daughter made these the other day.  I would probably give them 3.5 stars.  I didn't think the chocolate flavor was as complex as some other chocolate muffins I've had- maybe the lack of espresso or coffee effected that.  My daughter loved them and they sure didn't last long.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These are really good. I did make some changes like some people said. I used more cocoa, 3 tablespoons oil, omitted the nuts, and used M&Ms baking bits because I ran out of chocolate chips. I also forgot to sprinkle with the 4 tablespoons of sugar. I think these muffins taste better after sitting overnight in a container because when I ate one one fresh it was more like a cupcake than a muffin. The next day, it tasted like a muffin from a bakery! Thanks!

These muffins are delicious.  I did not use the nuts because my kids don't like them.  The sugar on top made a slight crunch and the muffins were moist.  They were great while they were still a little warm.  The chocolate chips were melted and gooey.  They were even good the next day heated in the microwave for 20 seconds.  This is a recipe I will be making again and again.

These cupcakes are definitely "death by chocolate" and they are wonderful. I have made them twice, the second time I used almond extract instead of vanilla and they were excellent.

Tasted good.  Major problem is that the chocolate chips sink to the bottom and if you do not use paper liners, you lose the chips as they stick to the cup when you take the muffins out.  These made 18 full cupcakes (not 12).  Mine were done at 18 minutes (vs. 20-25 as indicated).  Others have said these were dry and this is likely due to overbaking.  The sugar on top can barely be tasted - feel free to skip that step.  Tasted ok, but I won't make again due to the chocolate chip issue.

I just pulled these out of the oven a little while ago. I thought they were pretty darn good and will definitely make them again. I forgot the sugar on top and next time I'll add an extra 1/4 cup of cocoa to the dry ingredients.

I made this recipe just as written, without adding choc chips or nuts-I was out. They cooked up fine, about 22 minutes, didn't have any problems with thme setting up, and I didn't add any additional anything. Did it just as written. Great muffins. I'm sure they will be even better with the choc chips the next time I make them! Thanks!

I just made these muffins and they turned out great!  I used 2 tablespoons of oil like it said and added 1 tablespoon of natural applesauce.  I also, like others, added 1/4 cup more of cocoa and milk.  I omitted the nuts and used mini chocolate chips.   I will be making these often.

I took out the almonds and sugar for the top. I also used 3/4 a cup of cocoa powder instead of 1/2. And by the way, my muffins were done in 20 minutes, so watch out for those timers!

didn't use any nuts but they were the best double chocolate chip muffins i've ever had.

PS these freeze well and straight out of the microwave you wouldn't know they were frozen. :-D

These muffins were a big disappointment!  The chocolate chips all settled to the bottom, which made it a pain to get out of the pan.  They seemed moist on the outside, but they were dry and course in texture and not much chocolate taste other than the chips on the bottom.  Not at all what I was looking for.

These had great texture and were very moist.  They absolutely need more salt than 1/4 teaspoon. Next time I am going to add more nuts and a little less chocolate chips.  I am also going to mix some chips and nuts in with batter and push some into batter after I've put them in the muffin tin so that the "extras" will be more evenly dispersed throughout the muffin.  I will definitely make again - but I can't stress enough that you have to add more salt.  I can't believe no one said that in any of the other reviews.

Delicious! I used a 1 1/2" scoop and this made 32 adorable mini-muffins. So moist and chocolatey! I skipped the nuts in them but put a pecan on the top of each one before I baked them. I did add about a 1/4 cup more cocoa. So easy and so good! Thank you!!

Incredibly rich and chocolatey.  Hubs wanted chocolate muffins with choc chips the moment he saw these individual crocks we received as a wedding gift, so I dutifully looked for a recipe and made this recipe into jumbo muffins.  I made 6 and baked them at 375 for 30 minutes and they turned out very well.  Huge, pretty, and incredibly rich.  Hubs is happy.  He doesnt' like walnuts much so I used almonds in the batter (about 1/2 cup) then topped with sliced almonds and turbinado sugar.  very pretty.  thanks for the recipe!

This recipe is FAR from a par. The outside rim of the muffin is crunchy.  I had no problem with them being moist on the inside but the overall flavor is substandard.

I make these as the recipe is written, except I didn't add the almonds. They are tasty but I thought they weren't as moist as I would like. I will try them again but add a little more fat.

These were OK.  Not fantastic.  I was thinking they would be a little more dense.  They were moist, but a little too "spongy."  The only adjustment I made was melted butter instead of oil, which shouldn't have made a difference.

these are really yummy! the only issue i had was that the batter was really runny, so it was harder to fill the cups. they look like cupcakes and baked like cupcakes and filled like cupcakes, but they came out muffin-y - not too sweet, and not super moist, but just right.

These were okay...not great.  I didn't think these were chocolatey enough and they were more like cupcakes vs. muffins.  I followed the recipe per the directions except I didn't add nuts.  I was a bit disappointed due to the rave reviews.

My family loves these! When they cool down they taste exactly like Costco's chocolate muffins. The only thing that I did different was not add the nuts and I added about 3/4 cup chocolate chips.

I followed the recipe exactly, but ommitted the nuts.  All of my chocolate chips sunk right to the bottom of the cake batter... YUCK!  Unfortunately this left a thin layer of solidified chips sitting at the very bottom of each.  So try it if you love dark chocolate, but skip the chocolate chips.

Definitely more like a cupcake rather than a muffins.  The chocolate flavor was rich, but these were dry.  I actually had some leftover chocolate frosting in the fridge and my kids frosted them and had them for dessert.  Probably won't make again.  If I want chocolate cupcakes, there are better recipes.

Best choc chip muffin...i will always use this as my basic recipe now ;)  I too added more cocoa powder & used 3/4 cup, 1/4 cup more milk & 3 tbsp oil.  I did not hv any choc chips or nuts on hand, so i used what i had which was white choc chip~delicious!!!!  I will consider adding peanut butter or caramel chips & add perhaps a tbsp of instant coffee powder as well...i think coffee will enhance the flavour of cocoa ;) - will keep u all posted.

This recipe sounded so yummy, I decided to try to make a healthier version and hope for the best. I used 1 cup of all purpose flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat, and 1/2 cup wheat germ. I also cut the sugar down to just over 1 cup, and used a single serving cup of unsweetened apple sauce instead of the oil. I followed another reviewers suggestion and used 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 tsp salt, and added more walnuts and only 1/2 cup of chocolate chips. I didn't think they needed the sugar on top. Honestly, for all the changes, these muffins are awesome! I filled the cups right to the top and got nice big rounded tops, the recipe made 15 good sized muffins. So yummy and chocolatey, and still not TOO guilty.

Delicious, but not as chocolatey as I expected.  I baked them for 20 minutes (without nuts) and used milk chocolate morsels instead of semi-sweet.  Very good and so very quick and easy!

Really good chocolate muffins but I find they cook way better if you don't sprinkle any sugar on the tops and I cooked them from 25 minutes to 30. Other than that, great chocolate muffins.

These are so good! I used slivered almonds since that's what I had and I made regular and mini muffins. So GOOD!! Also, I made half the recipe, scrambled the egg and (tried) to use half, but 95% of the egg went in and it was still ok. I added the topping on some and some without. They were both delicious!! and so easy!

Delicious! I increased the milk by a 1/4 cup as others suggested, doubled the salt and added a very generous 1/2 cup of cocoa powder. I didn't add any nuts only because I didn't have any on hand. I'm normally the type to substitute applesauce for oil however 2 tablespoons isn't a lot of extra fat/calories for the amount of muffins you make (I got 24) so I just used the oil, I will try the applesauce in the future though just to see if I like it. But these came out w/ the perfect consistancy, not too light and not too dense and they puffed up perfectly in the oven, they all had nice round tops. I sprinkled the tops w/ some leftover cinnamon/sugar mixture rather than just sugar and I really liked that. With the last 12 muffins I made I added a peanut butter swirl to the batter (I used maybe 1/4 cup).. if you like peanut butter and chocolate try doing that sometime, they were really good that way. Thanks for this recipe, its a keeper for sure!

I made these as written except left out all nuts and didn't put sugar on top. Fresh out of the oven I feel it needs more salt (maybe 1/2 teaspoon) and fewer chocolate chips (maybe 1/2 cup) and pinch of cinnamon. Now it is the next day and I would reduce the score to a 2 star. Might try again with changes.

I followed the recipe to a T except for adding a tsp of cinnamon (love chocolate and cinnamon together).  I made 12 muffins and almost a whole pan of mini muffins. The mini muffins were done in 10 minutes.  I cooked the big muffins for 19.  They weren't very chocolatey and turned out a bit dry. I was careful not to overmix or overbake.  Won't be making these again, sorry.

The muffins turned out great. This is the first time I bake muffins and I am very happy with the result. I followed SukeyNY's changes to the original. One thing I do regret is using less nuts than the prescribed (you couldn't really feel them in the end) so I won't change that next time. Other than that - awesome muffins!!!

I sort of liked the hard exterior crust on the muffin, but the interior was close to dry on the first day. On the second day the whole thing seemed to dry out. I will try 1 more time and add applesauce or more liquid of some kind.

These turned out very well. Next time I will use a 2% milk instead of a fat free skim, because it wasn't as moist as it could have been, but still very good! I made a variety of Jumbo sized and regular muffins, both were great. Will make again.

Very good as a dessert! I made these as a whim because the picture looked so good. At the last minute I decided to bake them on a sheet cookie-style instead of a muffin tin because the batter was so thick. The result was 2 dozen muffin-like chocolaty cookies.

These are really good. I didn't have a problem getting high muffins because I raised the temp to 400 but I think that may have made them a bit dry. Next time I will try adding sour cream. I also tossed the chocolate chips with a bit of flour to keep them from sinking to the bottom.

Not quite moist enough for my liking. Next time I would add 1/4c more milk and either more sugar or 2Tablespoons of powdered sugar. The sugar on top creates a nice crust.

Seemed like a pretty standard muffin to me. Not really special in anyway. I am special.

I have made them twice and both times a big hit.  I mixed 1/2 cup white chocolate chips and 1/2 semi sweet choc.chips.    They came out moist.  Baked for only 20 minutes at 350 as suggested. Next time i may cut back on the amount of sugar used.

My son made these, really good. Did not add almonds, or much sugar on top at all. Gave a 4 because we used liners, and they stuck to liners & tiny burn on bottom. Next time will cook about 5 degrees less and 1 minute less. Was good though & he had fun making them.

Mine turned out very moist and delicious. I left out the nuts because I did not have it.   Used 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil, and 1/2 tsp. salt.  Mixed all the dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk the wet ingredients in another bowl.  I then added the wet ingredients into the dry and mixed just until combined. Sprinkled more choc chips in the batter before baking.  Very good. Yummy.......

I do love chocolate muffins and these were the best I've found so far.  Iced a few of them and called it my birthday cake. :) Didn't quite reach the Sam's Club/Costco ones though, which is what I always have in mind in regards to CC muffins.

I omitted the walnuts but other than that, followed exactly. Delicious when still warm. Unfortunately, mine got a little dry quite fast. I don't know why. I don't think I overbaked them, and I really was careful not to overbeat them. I would make again without the almonds on top, and maybe add a little extra oil for moistness. They are beautiful big chubby muffins, which I love! thanks for sharing.

Pretty darn good! Not sure if there is much you could do to improve these.  I made the recommended ingredient adjustments and ommitted the nuts.  They turned out super chocolately (which is what I wanted) and moist! Can't wait for hubby to try one with his coffee tonight.

Tasty & moist! I didn't use any nuts and took the reccommended changes (1/4 cup more milk,1 tbsp more oil, 3/4 cup of cocoa, 1/2 tsp salt)  
My chunks dropped to the bottom - found this out after for the next time I try to make them...

Easiest thing to do is flour them beforehand. Just measure the chips
out into a separate container, lightly dust with flour, stir to coat
completely, then incorporate into the batter.

Also, you might want to try the mini chocolate chips. They are
lighter, obviously, so they tend to sink less often. (still dust with
flour though!)

We love these muffins. Concerning the chocolate chips falling to the bottom of the muffins, I waited until I had the batter in the muffin cups and then added them on top. It worked out perfectly. None of them stuck to the bottom, and they were pretty much scattered through each muffin. Delicious!!

This recipe was pretty good, but not sure if I will make it again.  I chose to make this recipe b/c I love Costco Choc chip muffins but won't buy them b/c of the fat/sugar in them.  This recipe, for the name of it, was pretty low in all that, being that the recipe made 24 muffins.  I did make the changes with the additional milk, salt, cocoa, but I changed the 3Tbsp oil to applesauce.  I bake more with applesauce than oil & have never had a problem, so I am not sure if this is why I felt they were not very cake/muffin like.  They almost felt rubbery.  Not sure why since I bake with applesauce all the time, maybe more than 3tbs would have been better.  Mine baked for 18 minutes & was perfect, anymore & they would have been overcooked.  I gave it 4 stars b/c they are good & we will eat all of them, but not sure I will make them again.

Don't even try to make these without using muffin wrappers.  Eventhough I greased the tins they stuck to the pan.  These are very rich....almost too rich.

I changed the recipe as the others suggested, but these were far from "perfect".  I upped the milk, cocoa, and added an egg.  This just didn't do it for me.  Whenever I make "cakelike" recipes, I always add 2 tbsp of cornstarch per cup of flour to improve the texture.  I think this recipe could really benefit from that.  My muffins looked NOTHING like the photo; mine were flat and shiny.  Not a keeper recipe.

Loooove this recipe! been looking for a long time for a good chocolate muffin recipe, and this was it!, although at first was a bit dry, insed of adding more oil or milk, I added one tablespoon of baileys! and it was great! evryone loves them, i usually make insted of a dozen i make 24! because they dont last more than 3 days! p.s: vanilla isnt soooo important! with baileys you get the flavor, and also if you want or dont have walnuts, they are not so important!

these turned out great! on a whim, I took the last apx 1/3 of batter (this makes more than 12!) and added about 1 Tbsp. of instant coffee. Delicious! If making a full batch with the coffee, use 3-4 Tbsp coffee, depending on your taste. I used the 1.5 cups milk and 3/4 cocoa like others suggested. I also left out the nuts because I didn't have any, but these are great for a chocolate lover! however, not as dense as i had hoped. more of a 4.5

Although I used white chocolate chips and went without nuts, this gets 5 stars.  The cake itself is great.  I believe with mini chocolate chips and the nuts it would be awesome.  I made them the way I did for someone else's taste (not mine!)

These turned out delicious, but next time I will make them as specified instead of listening to the reviewer who said to use 1.5 cups of milk.  The batter turned out too liquidy (with chips & nuts sinking to the bottom and the batter sticking to my non-stick muffin pan - even after buttering!) and the muffin was too much like cake.  I like my muffins a little more dense and a little less sweet.

This batter is perfect!!! I did change the recipe a bit. I added extra 1/2 cup of chocolate chip and used normal cocoa powder instead of semisweet ones. I also left out the nuts (because I am allergic to it) and the vanilla extract because I have none. The outcome was still perfect except the chocolate chips are a bit too sweet (totally my fault for adding extra and using sweet ones). The batter when finished appear very very watery; however, after you bake it, the muffin is perfect except it didn't raise too much but it doesn't affect the taste at all!!!

I omitted the nuts. Instead, I added 1/4 cup of dried cranberries and put some on top. Also I used pieces of good quality chocolate (72% cacao). We ate the muffins when they were still warm, and the melting chocolate came out.....yum...
I added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. Nice dark colour inside. I like the combo of the cranberries and dark chocolate very much.

This muffin is pretty good, although I must agree with the previous comments that it's not that chocolatey. It's not that sweet either, but I think the chocolate chips somehow compensated for the lack of sweetness. I like that fact that it's not that moist, otherwise it would taste like cupcakes which I'm not very fond of. I didn't have nuts available but I didn't miss it at all. I'd definitely make this again, but I would probably add more cocoa powder next time.

turned out fluffy and delicious. A tad dry though, but it was because I used 2tsp of oil instead of 2 tbsp ( error in reading ) and used non fat milk instead of regular. I too, omitted the sugar sprinkle and nuts. With the paper liners, the muffins came out easily. Tasted really chocolaty, we did not miss the oil at all. Nice.

Hmmm these were okay but not what I wanted. I think that these should have been a little sweeter and choicolatier. I didn't use the muffin liners but I highly recomend them to anyone who wants to make this as the chocolate chips will carmelize to your pan greased or not.

I will have to agree with a lot of the other posts that these are too dry.  I even added mayo to add moisture.  They don't have much flavor and I prefer muffins to be more dense and moist.

These were great. I didn't add nuts or sprinkle the tops with sugar (why?). Instead of the oil I used about 2-3 tbsp of Mayo--I always use Mayo in baking for moistness! I sprayed the muffin pan with PAM but next time I will definately use muffin liners....the chocolate chips sank to the bottom and most were quite gooey at the bottom which made the bottom stick and get all blobby--I think I will use less chocolate chips next time and might push the chips in from the top and see if they don't sink as much. My kids loved them....the flavor is great--I didn't find these heavy at all. I didn't sprinkle the tops with sugar because they were VERY sweet to begin with..it would be like sprinkling sugar on a candy bar! Oh and I thought the batter seemed thin (not a problem) and I made 18 regular sized muffins--not 12 as the recipe says.

I am going to give this recipie 5 stars, because my kids loved them so much, even my son who normally isn't a chocolate fan.  I listened to others and did not add the nuts, to my disappointment, without the nuts they are only chocolate cupcakes. (Not good for breakfast, unless nuts or some substance is in the muffin) I used milk chocolate and peanutbutter chips, don't do that, they sank to the bottom and melted and didn't come out of the pan with the muffin.  Stick with semi-sweet, I am hoping they don't sink too. I will make these again BUT with nuts and the right chips.

I followed the recipe 100 % without changing one thing. I don't know how people like it! they are completely dry. They  were heavy (dense) and  I couldn't even eat one bite. I had to throw them in the garbage. Couldn't stand the dryness!
Also, the paper kept ripping when i tried to get it off. it needed more oil or butter because they were mate, not shiny at all.

I'll give this recipe a 4. They are good but a tad dry.  Next time I will use more oil and maybe a bit more sugar as the cocoa flavor was not quite sweet enough. The guys at work liked them well enough!

These were very good - I may try some of the suggestions of more milk, egg and cocoa.  The dough was very thick so I added a little water because I had not read the comments.  They tasted a bit doughy to me but my family is not so picky and they disappeared.

Went to the letter on the recipe, however I didn't add the nuts. My son is not a nut fan. I am though. These came out fantastically well. Nice chocolate flavor. They are very sweet and will satisfy any chocolate craving! My son loves them.

I made them exactly except for the almonds because....kids don't like them. However, I will make sure they go in muffins tin liners because they were hard to get out. All the good stuff went to the bottom AKA, the chocolate chips.

Delicious!  I used half whole wheat flour and half regular, and omitted the almonds and sugar on top.  The recipe made 18+ plus muffins, not even close to the 12 the recipe predicted, but that was perfect for us.  My kids loved them, and so did I.

Tried to follow the recipe as close as possible, as this is my first time making these ones.  I did use half WW flour and half AP, also added in 1/2 cup bran.  I only have skim milk in the house, so I did 1/3 cup half and half cream and added a cup with the skim (used a little extra for the bran).  Put all my liquids into my four cup glass and made a well 
into the dry, mixing them that way.  Also, did the 3/4 cup of cocoa instead of the chocolate.  Made 12 huge muffins in a regular pan that was filled to the top.  So far daughter likes them, so its a winner!!  Hubby and son will eat just about anything I make but she's the real judge.....lol

Very disappointing! I wanted muffins for breakfast the day after Christmas and made a variety. I was excited about these, but didn't have yogurt so used this recipe. My son didn't even like them :(
I used a tad more oil and tad more cocoa, nothing to measure. They were just, too chocolaty? And I LOVE chocolate, like overkill love. They weren't dry, but VERY dense. They definitely needed yogurt, or even applesauce, but I will not be using this recipe again to test that theory. Also, I have a giant muffin tin and there was still a little too much batter (fine if you want more than 12). I did omit the nuts. These just weren't worth it, I promise! An entire different recipe is needed to make the perfect chocolate muffin!

I just made these muffins for the first time and I will definately make them again. I used a large muffin pan and baked them for 22 minutes.I also substituted 2 TBSP of coffee liqueur for the vanilla. Next time I will take the suggestion of coating the chocolate chips in flour or using cupcake liners. The chips stuck to the bottom of the pan and I had a hard time getting them out. Other than that they were fabulous even without the nuts!

I work in a residential living center and I made these for breakfast for the residents and staff. They were a big hit! They are very easy to make and have a wonderful chocolatey taste. I will surely be making these again! Thanks for sharing this recipe.

The flavor was ok, rather bland. I followed the recipe as written. I did not care for the texture of these muffins. Seems they could use sour cream, applesauce, or banana, something to help the texture.

Amazing muffins!  I omitted the nuts and added a splash more of the milk to thin out the batter a bit.  I think these are best eaten the day they are baked, as the small amount of oil means that they don't stay moist for long.  Fortunately everyone loved these, so there were hardly any leftovers the next day.  I imagine it would also be great cooked in a loaf pan like banana bread.  Thank you for an easy and delicious recipe!

I made them basically as written, just without the nuts (I'm not generally a fan).  Very yummy!  The only downside is that they're very sticky, so even with paper liners they were hard to get out of the pan.

I liked these. They were nice and moist. I did change a bit. Instead of oil I used unsweetened applesauce and I put in 3/4 cup of quick oats in the batter. Made them a bit more healthier.

Great recipe! I usually add 1 teaspoon of cinimon (my bf loves it) OR 1 teaspoon of instant coffee. As I'm allergic to nuts I substitute all the nuts for chocolate chips and it is SUPER chocolatey! Best muffins EVER!  Thanks!

One of my favorite recipes!  For added deliciousness, I did a mix of brown & white sugar for the topping, and added about 2 tbsp of chopped chocolate chips.  It made a wonderfully crunchy topping!  Also, whole wheat flour is easy to put in this recipe because it's hidden with the cocoa powder.

Made these last night and they are pretty delicious. If they were healthier, I would make them all the time, but I'll still make them again with some changes.   I didn't use nuts, but they probably would have improved texture.   I swapped out half the AP flour for white whole wheat and the resulting batch was just slightly tougher than usual muffins.   I also cut sugar to 1 cup, though next time I will use probably 3/4 or 1/2 cup.   I used egg whites instead of whole egg, because that's what I had at home. Next time, I will use a whole egg. The additional calories and cholesterol per muffin is kind of negligible and would have made for a lighter muffin.   My batter came together very watery, more like cake batter than muffin batter. Because of this, the sugar added on top for that usual crunch didn't have the intended effect.   Overall, these were tasty muffins that easy to make and quite delicious, but more like dessert than breakfast for me.

These muffins are amazing. So moist and tasty. I did do a few alterations. I chose not to add chocolate chips or nuts, I just wanted chocolate muffins. I also cut the sugar in half and added an extra egg. But that is a personal choice so that they're not as high in calories. I found the taste was still fantastic, even with using only half the sugar.  I recommend these muffins to EVERYONE!

This recipe is a big hit in my family.  My husband just loves them.  My daughter isn't too into them, but it is because I think she is looking for chocolate cup cake taste.  My father in law has now asked met o make these for him.  I didn't change a thing.  I added chopped walnuts and that made them really good too.

These are excellent!  My friend and I just made these, and followed the recipe exactly - minus the walnuts and almonds.  They turned out wonderful, rich, chocolaty flavor and soft, fluffy texture.  My only problem with this recipe is that I can't really call them muffins, they're too sugary for me to think of them as anything but cupcakes without icing.

I've never made muffins before, just made these: I followed suggestions and used 1.5 cups milk, 3 tbsp oil and 3/4 cup cocoa powder. While they did rise beautifully, tad too chocolatey for my personal taste but definitely good for that occasional chocolate craving with a cold glass of milk.

This is a great recipe. The only changes I made was using 1cp instead of 1.5cp of sugar (trying to cut back here and there and I have read that cutting out 1/3 is usually not detrimental) and used two cups of chocolate chips and NO NUTS (I HATE nuts in my baked goods). I was going to use apple sauce instead of the oil, but my wife balked - "on the first attempt?!?!".  I made mine in jumbo muffin tins and ended up baking for about 30 minutes. Made 6 of them. They came out super moist.  I'd give 4.5 stars if I could.

Followed the recipe exactly and wasn't pleased with the results. These muffins were dry and bland. Maybe I should have taken the advice of other reviewers and increased both the milk and oil.

These are delightful!  We had a snowy day here today in the Northeast, and I wanted to bake something chocolatey.  These were easy and good.  My kids loved them.  I was afraid the batter looked a little brownie-like (not what I had in mind), but they baked up like beautiful muffins.  I forgot the sugar on top, and left out the nuts, but neither was missed.  Make these muffins!

These muffins were moist and delicious!!! I have never had chocolate chocolate chip muffins with nuts so I wasn't sure I would like this but it was great.  It made about 20 muffins.  Enough to share with neighbors shoveling on a snowy day!

it's a great recipe! I used drinking choc instead, changed the white sugar to brown sugar and reduced it to half a cup, and did not sprinkle more sugar in the end. and it came our perfect for my family's taste buds. thanks!

I omitted the almonds/walnuts and opted for a teaspoon of peppermint extract. They turned out wonderful, and I would definitely make them again! Recipe yielded 17.

The first time I made these I was very disappointed, so I made them again.  Same deal.  I don't like these at all.  The taste is terrible and nothing like I think a chocolate muffin should be.  I'll keep looking.  As per other reviews this recipe does make 18 instead of 12, and the chips do sink to the bottom so either use mini chips or sprinkle them on top.  I am confused as to why this recipe is rated so highly.

WOW this recipe is great!! It's the perfect muffin texture. Only thing I did was use about 3/4 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar because I ran out of white and I added mini peanut butter cups w/no nuts. The texture was OMG amazing. This will be my choco muffin recipe from now on!

My high school students loved this recipe.  After a few results we changed it up a bit.  We did not mix in the chips-we started sprinkling them on top-they didnt sink to the bottom after that.  We also added white and milk chocolate chips for variation.  The actual cake taste was amazing!!!  I noticed that in every single batch the tops did not round, but stayed flat.  If they filled the cups to the 3/4 mark the batter, when cooking, would overflow the cup.  I do not like this!  I will play with the recipe to find the problem and report back.

Wonderful recipe!  I agree, a little more salt helps bring out the flavor.  I also added a generous sprinkle of cinnamon.  Wonderful texture.  The recipe makes more than 12 muffins though, more like 16.

So easy, so good! I loved that it is not too sugary, and somewhat crunchy with the walnuts (I didn't have any almonds on hand). Quick baking time, which was great!

I didn't have any walnuts or almonds, so I made it without. The amount of batter was a little too much for 12 muffins, but they turned out perfectly.

This recipe was ok in taste. I thought it was too sweet and not enough chocolate. I didn't really like the texture as it was not as moist and decadent as I think a chocolate muffin should be. Also, the batter was too thin and the chips sank. I am sorry that it wasn't for me.

Dry, bland and stuck to pan even after generous greasing. The only way I saved these was by making a little chocolate frosting to put on top to make them more like cupcakes. I'd skip this recipe

This is an excellent recipe. I do have one suggestion, though. The first time I did it exactly as written and filled the muffin cups 3/4 full, and instead of puffing up nicely they exploded sideways. This time I filled them all the way full and the puffed up beautifully, plump the way I think a muffin should be.

Great recipe exactly as written.  I made some changes to try to up nutrition and reduce fat and sugar:  Substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup oats for the 2 cups white flour.  The oats gave it that "oaty" texture, which my family doesn't mind.  Decreased sugar to a scant 1 cup.  Used 2 T applesauce instead of oil.  For variety, used 3/4 cup mini choco chips and 1/4 cup white chips.  Delish!  Still a sweet treat to be eaten only on occasion, but a little better for us.  (Or at least that's what I'm saying as I shove the third mini muffin down the hatch!)

Fabulous! I made these with few adjustments. I used organic sugar rather than white, 1 tbsp more oil, and self-rising flour rather than AP (also losing the baking powder and salt), as this is what I had on hand. Very nice, moist and luscious muffins bursting with chocolate. Made them tonight for breakfast tomorrow and my boys are going to be ecstatic if Daddy leaves them any.

I left out the nuts and chips, added a little extra cocoa, and pressed 1 tp. cream cheese into the center of the batter before baking the muffins. They were a hit!

I only had walnuts so I used a full cup of them and I added a good handful of white chocolate chips. Super delicious! Also, I only had bread flour handy and it still worked great. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow, these are some delicious and moist muffins! I used pecans instead of walnuts because I had an abundance of those and milk chocolate chips because that is what I had on hand. These muffins are wonderful! They were still moist and fudgy three days later! This one is definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

My family and I loved them.  These were the best we've had.  Very moist.  We didn't add nuts this time, but will consider adding pecans the next time.  My mix yielded 16 muffins that we good sizes.

I added white chocolate chips at the request of my sister. These actually taste better the next day! I think I would add more milk next time. Also, the recipe makes 12 HUGE muffins.

YUM!  I modified this to make it a little healthier by using whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose, and subbing applesauce for oil.  I also used chocolate chunks instead of chips (it was all I had), and didn't add the additional sugar on top of the muffins at the end.  They were AMAZING!  The recipe ended up making more like 16 standard sized muffins instead of 12.  I will definitely be making these again!!!

I followed some of the other reviewers changes by adding 1/4 cup more cocoa, 1/2 cup more milk, an extra tablespoon of oil, 1/2 teaspoon of salt.  I used special dark cocoa. Next time, I would use 1/4 cup cocoa and 1/4 special dark because using all dark cocoa made the muffins look black. Tasted good but the color looked unappealing.

Divine! Granted, I took the advice of another reviewer and added a quarter cup more of cocoa powder. I like chocolate :) To lower the fat and calorie count some (I do the same with every muffin recipe; it works amazingly well) I used 2 tbsp. of applesauce and 1 egg white. The muffins rose beautifully and were absolutely delicious. Will definitely be making these again. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

These were not at all what i expected. didnt have an intense chocolate flavor. I did substitute with whole wheat flour and some rapadura sugar instead of all white but it should have atleast still had a chocolate flavor which was lacking. for the second half of the batch i was baking i added some oil and milk and cocoa powder and almond extract, which helped in the moistness but still not the richness i was hoping for. all in all its an ok recipe nothing amazing or i would try again.

Fantastic muffins. The only thing i would change is adding a bit more  cocoa because they just didn't quite taste chocolately enough. The only thing i changed was using half milk chocolate and half dark chocolate chips. MMMM!

This muffin recipe is really good.  It actually taste better the next day when you heat it up in the micro for 30 seconds or more depending on how hot you like your muffin.  I followed the recipe the way it is plus took other reviewers suggestions such as adding   1/2 Tbsp canola oil, 1/2 Tsp. salt, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup ghiradelli cocoa powder, and 1/4 cup espresso.  I used espresso rather than coffee because it enhances the taste of the chocolate better.  I will surely make this recipe again.

Wonderful muffins!  I just finished baking them and my man ate four right out of the oven haha.  I'm not one to review a recipe that I've changed but the only thing I did was add a bit more milk then it called for.  I love it when a recipe turns out just as yummy as they said it would! It made about 18 muffins.  Just try it!

These were perfect!  Exactly what I was looking for... a MUFFIN, not a cupcake.  I followed some prior tips:  I used 1/4 cup more milk and 1/2 Tbsp. more (canola) oil.  I also sprinkled the tops of the muffins with the (mini) chocolate chips and chopped nuts, but they did not sink like another reviewer had mentioned, so next time I will mix them together in the batter.  Maybe they added a lot more milk and it made the batter thin.  I will definitely make these again!

These were quite good. They weren't AMAZING, but they were good. I had to use part brown sugar/part white sugar due to what I had at home. I also had to use whole wheat flour, which is probably what is leading me to give 4 stars and not 5. Even with those substitutions, these were a nice treat. If I made them again, I think I would substitute some of the milk with cold coffee. That can give a chocolate dessert a wonderful, richer flavor.

I also used SukeyNY's addition of 1/2 cup more milk and an extra tablespoon of oil, and I used a heaping 1/2 teaspoon of salt. These muffins are awesome and taste very similar to those delicious Costco chocolate muffins you buy in the bakery, 5 stars on this one thank you!!!

These were great! Even after sub'ing 1c whole wheat and 1c white whole wheat. I did modify them by following others' suggestions: upped the cocoa powder and milk by 1/4 c each, and salt to 1/2 t. Thanks!

This is more like a 10 star recipe. As always, I try the recipe first as it is printed exactly. Even to the minutes to bake them. These were excellent. Everyone who tried them, wanted more. Moist cake with gooey chocolate chips. I used half Ghiradelli dark chocolate and half semi-sweet chocolate chips. Second time I made them, I omitted the chocolate chips,the almond and sugar on top and over baked. (I was watching tv at the same time and wasn't thinking what i was doing.) DON'T do this. You will be disappointed with a dry muffin. I may try the tip of adding a little raspberry jam to the center of these as I do believe the flavors would be great together.

I would give this more than a 5 star! its incredible... moist and gooey just perfect :) 
i did some of the other users suggestions and used 3/4 cup of cocoa, 3 tbsp oil and 11/2 cups of milk and 1/2 tsp of salt. I omitted the nuts since am not a fan and i ran out of chocochips so i used chunks of baking choco instead turned out just great :) yummoooo

Great recipe. I tried it the other week (with SukeyNY's alterations, though it could use a bit more salt still) and it made for amazing muffins (though I didn't use any of the nuts, added more chocolate chips instead).

Death by chocolate. As someone mentioned before, this is for someone who really likes chocolate and is not looking for a breakfast muffin. But I love chocolate :-) Next time, I will try to replace some coffee for the milk.

I must have over baked these as mine were a little dry, and the texture seemed more like a brownie than a muffin.  I used mini chocolate chips and didn't have a problem with them sinking to the bottom.  I also used pecans instead of the walnuts and almonds (didn't have any).  I will have to try these again and next time will try not to overbake them.  For me these made 12 large muffins.  I did bake them for 27 minutes but sometimes I find my oven does take longer to bake.

Had about an hour to whip together something tasty to bring to a meeting.  Made these and left the nuts out because I didn't have them.  I was expecting them to be so-so but they got rave reviews.  Someone even said "I think that is the best muffin I've ever eaten."

These muffins tasted scrumptious, but I had a bunch of trouble with the baking. It took about 30+ minutes before the muffins set and I ended up having to put them back in the oven to re-bake after the first 25 minutes. Even then, the muffins did not rise well and stuck to the bottoms and sides of my greased muffin tins. I think a little more flour, filling the cups only 1/2 full instead of 3/4 full, or using muffin cup liners, or a combination of all of the above would have helped tremendously. Am definitely going to try again though!

We used whole wheat flour instead of AP and milk chocolate chunks instead of semi-sweet chips. I made mini-muffins for the kids and regular muffins for the adults. I forgot the sugar on top! Regardless of the changes and ommission these are a 4 and the kids keep going back for more which is great!

I tried the recipe and my friends said the muffins were heavenly!!!!I omitted the sugar topping and substituted a chocolate glaze.  Also the next time I would add an additional tbsps oil.

Used cooking chocolate ground with a blender instead of chips (because they are impossible to find in Germany) & dropped the nuts. These muffins were a huge hit at my husband's birthday! We froze the leftovers and they are just as good if not better now. Moist & soft still...will definitely make these again! A chocolate lover's dream

Really yummy muffins!! I had special dark cocoa, and it was almost too much, but the kids loved them. Gave some to my neighbor also and her kids were drooling over them as I left. 

The only 'problem' I had was that my muffins turned out really smooth on top. Just not as beautiful and textured as I'd like, anyone know why? Maybe its because I'm used to baking with whole wheat, but ran out this time. 

Thanks for a keeper!!

I love this recipe, made this for a bunch of construction workers who gobbled them down. Used the suggestions for good chocolate, applesauce and added golden flax meal for added nutritional benefits. Have already made a few times.

Made these as stated but without the nuts.  I have to say I had high hopes for these muffins, but I was disappointed.  They were dry (I only baked 20 min) and they lacked the rich chocolate flavor I was looking for.  My kids liked them in spite of their flat taste otherwise I would have rated 1 or 2 stars.  I am sure there are better chocolate muffin recipes out there than this one.

They are almost fudgey. I like to use pecans instead.

Absolutely out of this world! Could be used as a dessert but do not add icing (makes it too sweet).  Rich chocolate taste.  Easy to make. I only had money for walnuts and cut amount inhalf and muffins were still wonderful!

This recipe is so easy to do and they turned out light and fluffy,  but if your not a chocolate fiend then they might be a bit rich.
 Two of my lads loved them and the other two found that halfway through eating one they where too rich for them.
I will make these again but with a little less coco powder.

I made this recipe as posted, except I excluded the nuts (allergies) and I substituted white chocolate chips for the semi-sweet. YUM! I'm thinking I might add more chocolate next time, like other users did, just to see if they endup a little more cupcake-y.

these were good but you couldn't tasted the sugar on the top at all! I only put chocolate-chips in 1/2 of the batter...and i liked the ones without chocolate-chips better. the batter was runny but over-all they were very good, and it's a "keeper" recipe.

These muffins were declared "not too sweet" and "really good" by my mother and sister. However, my little sister had one before they cooled and one after. She said the first one was really good, but the second one was too hard on the outside. I don't think I over-cooked them, because when I took them out, I was worried that they might not be done yet because the center of one was a bit gooey.

I followed Suky's instructions and they're lovely.  I didn't use nuts and I used white chocolate chips.  I don't see how people thought there weren't sweet enough.  They got a little dark on the bottoms but that might have been my fault.  We're eating them now while they're hot and the hockey game is on!

Good with modifications suggested by others - a bit more cocoa and oil. Amount of sugar was actually just right, unless you have a strong sweet tooth.

However, let's face facts -- these are actually cupcakes rather than muffins!

This was not sweet enough, and really not what I was looking for. I thought like most food it would be gone quickly, but because of the large amount it made and the bland taste they were around our house for way too long.

I make these at least 3x per week. They are terrific to take to teachers. BIG KUDOS!! Just the right amount of chocolate. Also, I change the servings to 6 for my amll family. The recipe still makes about 9 muffins.

These were nice. I made them with brown instead of white sugar and whole wheat flour instead of all purpose. I also halved the recipe, but ended up using a whole egg. No walnuts. Great recipe, thanks :)

After reading the other reviews, I took a few liberties with this recipe.  First of all, I cut the recipe in half, but I still used a whole egg.  I cut all other ingredients in half, except the sugar.  I used only a scant half cup of sugar so that it wouldn't be too sweet.  I made 4 regular muffins and 12 mini muffins.  I used paper liners and sprayed them with Pam and didn't have any trouble with sticking.  The batter was very thin.  The chips sank to the bottom of the regular muffins, but remained dispersed in the mini muffins.  In the future, I might thicken the batter to keep the chips dispersed by substituting sour cream or maybe even cream cheese for the milk.  The muffins turned out not-too-sweet and pefect with my morning coffee.

Very yummy! I LOVE chocolate and these satisfied my sweet tooth. I left the nuts out. The muffins seemed a bit too sweet, so if I make them again I might leave some of the sugar out.

I didn't care for this recipe.  I thought my kids would love them but ended up no one liked them.  They were very dry and not alot of flavor.  I would like to know if they tasted better with the mayonnaise (as suggested on a previous post).  It taste like it needs more oil and maybe less milk.

YUM!  These were so good!  I made them in mini muffins for a baby shower, they made 24 mini muffins and then another 6 regular muffins!  I forgot to put the sugar on top of the mini ones until about 10 minutes into the baking, so they didnt melt into the chocolate "icing" like on the regular sized ones i made, but they kept their crystaline form and looked so pretty sparkling on the top!  i would make them like that again, i liked it a lot better.  A keeper for sure!!

More like a brownie than a muffin!  Would be better for larger muffins. I made small ones so they ended up a bit dry. My children wouldn't touch them but I thought they were pretty good.

I did enjoy these but I personally prefer a lighter muffin. These were slightly heavy, but they were moist. I didn't have any chocolate chips so I used chopped chocolate covered raisins and left out the nuts but I will include these next time as I think these muffins need the nuts for a bit of crunchiness. Next time I will also add raspberry jam (jelly?) as I think the two flavours will mix well.

These are definitely rich but wonderful!  I decided not to add the nuts but added extra chocolate chips.  Everything else was exactly to the recipe.  While they were cooling they felt hard, so I put them in a plastic container and they softened up.  Everyone seemed to really like them, they're almost gone!  I'll probably be making these again.

This could've been better if I had not used Dutch-processed cocoa [the only type of cocoa I had in the pantry]... Otherwise, a pretty good muffin recipe.
