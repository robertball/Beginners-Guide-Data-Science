It was really good my family liked it but i don't think it will get requested at the next family get together. the brand of sauce is good but i added roma tomatoes, small chuncks of onion and i used a prediced roasted garlic that really added flaver to it. you can't really put these togther early because the sause soakes in to the bread so i put it in a bowl and made it look nice. and just let everyone spoon there own. oh don't dip the bead in the oil must brush it on or the bread get's yucky! I also put italian seasoning to the oil to jazz up the bread. great basic recipe
