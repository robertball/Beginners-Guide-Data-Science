This soup is awesome!  Pure comfort food.  I made this using the Thanksgiving turkey carcass.  I pressed a few (4 or 5) large cloves of garlic while making the broth.  I omitted the rutabega, added 5 small potatoes,added some fresh basil I had on hand for another recipe, and added a bit of salt.  The flour/milk mixture makes a nice creamy broth.  I do not have a food processor, therefore I used another recipe I had for the dumplings.  Will definately be making this recipe again and again!  Thanks Christine...

Great recipe.  Family loved it.  For the dumplings, I "cheated" and cut refrigerated biscuits dough in small pices and just dropped them in the broth.  Turned out great!!!

I had to cook the soup for quite a bit longer than the recipie recommended to get the dumplings cooked.  After this, the soup and the dumplings were quite good.  I also found that after allowing the mixture to thicken in the refrigerator overnight, it made a most delicious stew for dinner the next evening.

I have made this several times and I think it is delicious --the dumplings are great. I've tried it with and without the rutabaga and now believe it does not matter whether it is there. Fresh parsley is a must. The salt for the broth needs to be reduced -- start by reducing it to half of what the recipe calls for and add according to your taste. I frequently add fresh or canned corn, garlic. I also like to add small noodles about 10 minutes before it is done, and frozen peas a minute or two before serving. This soup is comfort food, no doubt about it. If you are worried it might be to bland for you, I'd 1 1/2 x the onion for extra flavor...I have made this several times, sometimes using chicken instead of turkey. It is very good.

Great soup for leftover turkey.  I didn't make the dumplings and omitted the rutabaga (whatever that is??)  I used more bouillon probably 6 cubes or so.  Came out really great!!Freezes great too!

Incredibly delicious soup Christine! I cheated and made the dumplings with Bisquik and added a few more seasonings. Perfect dinner on this windy and very rainy night. Thanks so much!

I have made this recipe for several years on the day after Thanksgiving. The only variation I have made is by substituting the rutabagas with potatoes. My family always looks forward to this soup and I highly recommend it.

I've been making turkey soup for 40 years and until today I would have said mine was better. Not anymore!  This was fantastic, it made me think of my childhood and mum's chicken and dumplings. Don't change a thing it is great soup just as it is. Thanks Christine for teaching an old bird new tricks.

Soup doesn't get any better than this and being that the "frost was on the pumpkin" this morning here in N.J., my family couldn't have wanted for anything more perfect then this wonderful comfort food. Using a leftover turkey or chicken carcass definitely gives soup the best flavor possible. I made my stock the day before so that I could skim off the fat. I made matzo balls in lieu of the dumplings as my kids are totally addicted to them. Thanks Christine!

This soup was delicious!!!!  I made it as is with the exception of using half a rutabaga because I never ate one before.  They're delicious.  My husband didn't like the rutabaga but he's like a child...I think his tooth touched it and then he declared that he didn't like it.  He did like the soup (doesn't like dumplings either, but that's okay).  I put in fine egg noodles but DH thought it needed bigger noodles...I disagree but that's not important.  Anyway, great soup and fattening but I'll just make it once a year after Thanksgiving.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Time consuming but worth it! Dumplings are the gummy kind.(If you are used to Bisquick like I am) I did not have fresh parsley so I substituted for the dried type but it was still good. Don;t know if it lives up to the name hearty..  but then again I left out the rutabaga...Maybe some potatoes in it... That would make it hearty. I had two bowls and I'm still hungry

This is the best tasting turkey soup I have ever had! It is somewhat time consuming to make, but well worth it! I have gotten raves from everyone who has tried it. I have not attempted the dumplings yet - I have added barley instead. This is quick becomming one of my favorite meals to make! Thanks for the recipe!

I used just chopped turkey from T-day,(about 1.5 cups) not the carcass. But first I sauteed the sliced carrots/celery w/ a cpl heaping spoonfulls of garlic in evoo and a splash of chix stock. After about 30 mins I added the rest of the can of stock, about 4 cups of water and a chicken bouillion cube, tbls of thyme, splash of white wine and a can of diced potatoes (about $.50) instead of cooking and dicing potatoes. Toward the end I added the fridg biscuit dough torn up, and a cpl tbls of fresh flat leaf parsley. It was a tad bland so I put in a cpl shakes of regular ole seasoned salt/pepper then a tad of tabasco. We all loved it including the kids... another way to uniquely use leftover T-day turkey!!  Thanks (Oh yea.. who has rutabaga?? :)

This is a delicious recipe.  I don't know why everyone skips the rutabaga.  They're so sweet and delicous, a nice taste that falls between carrot and potato. I cooked my dumplings the standard way, 10 minutes uncovered and then 10 minutes covered.  That's the best, for a light fluffy dumpling, cooked all the way through.  The 12 minutes recommended here doesn't work.

Very Good! I used a whole cut up chicken instead of a turkey carcass and it worked great! Next time I will add spices to the dumplings. In my opinion they are a little bland. I think I will add celery salt next time. The rest of the recipe is great! Add spices to the broth to taste.

Our Thanksgiving turkey was a little overcooked this year so I thought this recipe would be perfect to bring a little moisture to the meat. I used 8 cups of organic chicken broth (msg free!) instead of the bouillon and reduced the water to 4 cups. I added a little extra celery & onion to the broth while it was cooking. My local grocery was out of rutabaga so I substituted 2 golden potatoes. 12 min. was perfect for the dumplings.. thou I imagine it would depend on how big you make them.  Mine were a little smaller than a golf ball but grew to twice that big in the pot. I also threw in a half cup of wild rice to the mix which was wonderful, but make sure to add more water or broth to the pot if you do.

My husband made this soup the day after Thanksgiving and it was absolutely delicious. He did not make the dumplings, choosing to add egg noodles toward the end of cooking instead. He also added one large potato, cubed. That and the rutabega seemed to add a wonderful depth of flavor and a silky texture. Otherwise, he followed the recipe exactly. I can't wait to cook another turkey just so we can enjoy this soup again!

I can't wait to cook another turkey just so we can enjoy this soup again!

This is almost exactly the way I have made soup for 25+ years.  If you simmer the carcass and veggies long enough, with a little sea salt, no boullion cubes are needed for flavour.  I have never thickened my broth with milk/flour but decided to give it a try.  I had thick lumps of flour in my broth, so I ended up pouring it through a sieve.  Like many others I used potatoes instead of rutabaga and egg noodles instead of dumplings.

I had homemade turkey stock made from my Thanksgiving turkey, so I used that and started at step 2. This is a very hearty and satisfying soup. I loved the parsley dumplings - they added an old-fashioned touch and were the perfect complement to the soup. Delicious!

Followed directions minus dumplings. Sad to say that this was not flavorful at all (after hours of work) and the flavor it had was dominated by thyme.

I'm giving it only 4 stars because I followed the directions exactly and the dumplings came out too mushy. It could of been my mistake, but I think it may just be the recipe.

Delicious..even the skeptics in the family, once they tasted it, enjoyed and went back for seconds. One bit of advice - the flour/milk mixture NEEDS to be strained while adding it to the stock...otherwise, you'll have pasty lumps to explain..giggle...(learned from experience)!

This soup was sooooo good. I too used potatoes instead of rutabaga and egg noodles instead of the dumplings. Be careful not to let it simmer too long like I did, otherwise the noodles will suck up all of the liquid. Even with the reduced amount of soup, it turned out great!

i did make a few changes with the spices (using what i had in the house) i didn't use the thyme, bay leaf. I added parsley to the broth, some garlic and onion powder, a good bit of pepper, salt and some season salt. I didn't make the dumplings and used homemade egg noodles from this site (grandma's egg noodles 2) It was a pretty good tasting soup, It made up for the turkey being disaster. the flour/milk mix didn't do much to thicken the soup even with all the xtra flour from the noodles but still and awesome comforting soup. The next day is OMG good like alot of the other reviewers stated it turned into a stew. The was probably the first soup that we ate all of and was trying to fight for the leftovers and was genuinely sad when it was all gone. I'm going to be making it again for tomorrow's dinner. I can't wait!

The soup was delicious. I thought that the dumplings were heavy, but that they had a good flavor.  I had cooked the chicken carcass without any veggies and it was in the frig before I found this recipe. After skimming the fat off, I heated the broth and added the carrots, celery, onion and spices. I did not strain the veggies out. Then, I followed the recipe exactly except I did add more flour because the amount of flour didn't do much to thicken the soup. Next time I'll try a different dumpling recipe.

Hmmm..I was really excited about this recipe, but I can only give it 3 stars. For starters, you need a bigger stock pot than 4 qts! I don't really understand the need to mix milk and the flour together to mix into soup. It didn't thicken the soup, in my opinion just clouded it! I think it had a bit too much pepper, and I messed up the dumplings. They were too doughy! However, I could still taste some goodness through it all. I will try this again...and maybe make a few changes.

What a fantastic recipe.My family loved it and I have very picky children. I didn't try the dumplings and I substituted the rutabaga for potato. We used a free range fresh turkey and there was no fat or greasey texture like with some soups.  It was awesome!

This is very good... you must make sure to skim off as much fat as possible or else the soup will turn out extremely greasy.  The dumplings were great.  I added cornmeal and cooked them for ten minutes covered and then ten minutes uncovered.  I substitued the cube of chicken bouillon with a can of chicken broth.  Overall a very yummy soup.  I'll use this recipe for every leftover turkey!  Thanks for sharing.

This soup was great - the best, most flavourful use of a turkey carcass after Thanksgiving! Now... the dumplings in this recipe were a disaster- which could have been something I did  - they turned out like doorstops! I had to scoop them out and throw em away, but the soup made up for it..!  Stick to easy bisquick dumplings with this recipe.

This recipe was fantastic.  I did not have a rutabaga in the house, so I used 2 small potatoes with great results.  Also did not have fresh parsley, but the dumplings were still great.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I used this recipe as a base for my Xmas dinner leftovers. I didn't make the parsley dumplings. I used a few small shallots instead of the onion, extra celery and left out the carrots because I didn't have any. Instead of tossing away the veggies after making the stock, I picked through and re-added them to the broth. This where things changed- I used extra turkey, added leftover cheesy creamed spinach (roughly 1 cup) and instead of just one rutabaga I added the leftovers of mashed potato-rutabaga w/caramelized onion casserole. Seasoned to taste. End was result was a nice, thick, stew.

Whenever I make stock, I insert a metal colander into the water and and put my bones, skin, bay leaf and anything else I will need to fish out later.  I cook all the veggies at the same time placing them underneath in the to keep section.  Saves time and all that straining business.

Whenever I make stock, I insert a metal colander into the water and and put my bones, skin, bay leaf and anything else I will need to fish out later.  I cook all the veggies at the same time placing them underneath in the to keep section.  Saves time and all that straining business.

Great recipe, took much longer for us, because we doubled it because of the large turkey carcass, but it was a good lazy day to do it. I would add more chicken bouillon as one other user noted, I put in 4 cubes. We didn't have a rutabaga, so just used potatoes.  Our dumplings were too big, so be careful not to do that like we did.  All in all - GREAT recipe.

This soup was excellent!  It took some time because I wanted to let the stock cool to get the fat off.  It was very good.  I used a different method to make the dumplings because I don't have a food processor.  My husband loved this soup!

This soup was fantastic!  We made this Thanksgiving night and my eight year old daughter ate it for lunch and dinner the next day! I plan on making a turkey just so I can make the soup again.

Fantastic! I followed to the letter except that I omitted the  flour and milk to thicken stock.  The parsley dumplings were quite appealing in flavor and appearance.

I made this as per the instructions, however, I only had wheat bread...but the dumplings still turned out really good.  I may add more to the soup next time, as I felt it needed more seasoning, but overall a good hearty recipe

This was time consuming, but, one of the best soup recipes I've got.  It is definitely worth the time.  I skipped the dumplings (from the previous reviews - just made toast to dip in it instead), added mushrooms & a can of corn as I like a few more veges in my soup.  Well done & a double thumbs up from our house!  :)

The soup was good, but didn't like the dumplings due to a too gummy texture caused by the bread. I will find another dumpling recipe and use this recipe for the soup. I also think wide egg noodles would be excellent in it instead for the time being.

Great recipe for a snowy day.  I did not include the rutabaga (didn't have any), but the soup came out great anyway.  The real reason for the five stars is the parsley dumplings.  Everyone was fighting over who got the last ones!

Great recipe!  I've used leftover rotisserie chicken as well and the whole family loves it.  I did saute' all the veggies first in olive oil.  My family is picky about celery especially, so I wanted to make sure it was well cooked.   Overall great recipe!

Very good flavor but I didn't cook the dumplings right, so they were a bit doughy.  Otherwise a great soup that I will make again!

This stuff was great. I also used potato in place of rutabaga (because it was what I had on hand) and I did't have time to try the dumplings. But altogether it was very good. Thanks!

I added barley, potatoes and omitted the turnip.  I used Seasoning Salt instead of regular salt.

Wow, the best we have ever made.

This was soooo delicious.  Definitely worth the work.  Too bad I only roast a turkey once a year, it's almost worth it to cook one just so you can make the soup!  Don't skip the dumplings, they are a close second to the delectably complex broth for the best part of the soup.  Just make sure to keep the dumplings small, otherwise they are a little doughy in the middle.  I skimmed the fat from the broth.  Loved it!

This soup does not taste like it was made from leftovers.  It is reminiscent of chicken & dumplings that my mother makes.  I did make a few changes:  2 chicken bouillon cubes, 1 tsp. dried basil instead of bay leaf (didn't have one), no rutabaga (didn't have any), and I made my dumplings from Bisquick mix (2 cups Bisquick & dried parsley mixed with enough milk to form a moist dough).  Also, I had already thrown my turkey carcass away so I used my 1 1/2 pounds of cooked turkey in the original stock and then picked it out and reserved it for the end.  Even with my changes, it still turned out delicious and full of flavor.

I made this last night.  After straining stock, added fresh onions and celery along with the carrots.  Didn't have rutabaga, so used peas instead.    For the dumplings, don't have a food processor, so chopped up bread and parsley on my bread board.  Picked out the big pieces of bread and added to dry ingredients.  Then made as per directions.  They turned out really good.  In fact, this soup, though rather labor intensive, is absolutely wonderful!!  Am adding to the list of soups my husband will eat (he won't eat many-lol).  He even said not to change a thing.  Great soup!!!!

Good soup but a little bland.  I used the Rosemary Roasted Turkey recipe to roast my turkey.  I think this soup would work well as an appetizer, or possibly in combo with a sandwich.

Wonderful!  I used leftover deep-fried turkey which was perfect for this since it was a bit tough from being fried and needed to be softened.  I skipped the rutabaga.  My dumplings may have been a bit runny.  They didn't hold up real great, but that was fine because it made a very creamy soup that way.  I can't imagine why I would ever do anything else with my leftover turkey after trying this recipe!

The flavor of this soup was excellent! The dumplings were light and delicious, my whole family loved this. The only thing I might try next time is to add a cup of cream at the end to make it more of a cream of turkey tyoe soup.

Great recipe. When making the broth, I added garlic cloves in addition to the other seasonings. I did not thicken the broth when finishing the soup, we like more liquid soups. I used parsnips instead of rutabaga - it gives the soup a nice sweetness. The dumplings were good and turned out fine. My husband and I enjoyed very much. Thank you for sharing.

I made this soup yesterday and it turned out fantastic.  I'm not crazy about dumpling's, so I used homemade pasta instead.  The noodles just absorb the flavor of the soup compared to store bought noodles.  Very time consuming recipe, but worth every minute.

I didn't have the 1 & 1/2 lbs. of cooked turkey and used whatever I could pick off of the bone.  Hubby loves meaty meals, but didn't complain one bit.  He loved it.  Dumplings are a nice change with the fresh parsley.

I didn't make the dumplings, but followed the basic recipe, I added potatoes instead of the rutabaga.... I also put a little bit of sage as well... the taste was still a little bland... not sure if adding more spice would help... but over all was good

Yummy.  It's very pretty with lots of color.

I didn't have a carcass so I simply put meat in and more bullion.

I made this right after thanksgiving and thought it was the best turkey soup I have ever made.  I froze leftovers and had some @ work - tip: don't microwave dumplings- they turn into rocks!   I just had more that thawed for a couple of days in the fridge, made a micro batch of  cheese dumplings to add to it - as my kids would say, "OMG!".  Even better than the first time.  This ia a really good recipe.
BTW, I used "Herbed Dumplings" from this site - I prefer the puffed dumplings like my Mom used to make, and the herbs just kicked it to another level.
Another good idea in this recipe is to reserve and cube a bunch of "good" turkey meat and add it near the end of cooking time.  I have made a lot of post thnksgvng turkey soup and never thought of doing it that way before.  Always ended up with long strands of turkey shreds.  Annoying.
This is a keeper.

I had already boiled and picked my smoked turkey carcass and froze it, so this wasn't as big of a task as some others had noted. And my oh my, the best soup I've ever made. I didn't have rutabagas so I substituted potatoes, but otherwise followed the recipe all the way.  It was absolutely delicious and I can't wait to make it again!

classic.  Times given are minimum, soup alway improves when each step is slowly allowed to develop all their flavours.  Dumplings like biscuits require a nac more then a recipe.  Enjoy!

I will probably omit the milk/flour addition to the soup in the future. Instead of chicken bouillon, I used 4 cups of chicken stock (replaced some of the water) and added a sprinkle of salt. Added dill to the dumpling dough. Tasty!

This is the BEST turkey soup I have ever had! You know it is good when my 2 picky kids and extremely picky husband all LOVED it! I also added about 5-6 crushed garlic cloves to the broth. I added potatoes instead of rutabaga and used Bisquick for dumplings. Big hit in this house. Can't wait to have it again for dinner tomorrow!!!

Made this today, lots of work but worth it. Will make again maybe changing up the veggies.  Family liked it too.

My son loved this, I thought it was decient.  Didn't like the dumplings very much, but I did use dried parsley.  Would make this again though.  Great way to use up that leftover turkey.

This soup was fantastic! It is rich in its depth of flavor and is well worth all the time needed!  Dumplings were amazing - good point to keep them smaller - about 2/3 the size of a golf ball worked well.  Bagged the rutabaga completely and was not missed at all!  There was even enough broth to make another batch of dumplings (from old hamburger buns, no less!)  Looking forward to my Christmas turkey to do this again!

We loved this recipe.  I discovered that rutabaga is great tasting too.

This was great. I did make my own dumplings and added peas instead of parsnip. Turned out excellent.
