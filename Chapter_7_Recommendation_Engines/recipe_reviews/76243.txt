These cookies were very good. I did not have enough butter to make the original recipe, so I used one stick of butter flavored Crisco instead and the cookies were still awesome.  This new Splenda Blend for Baking is great - I have used it in a few other recipes, substituting it for regular sugar with very good results.

This recipe has the potential to be great just DO NOT ADD THE 1 TSP SALT the cookies turned out very salty. I also replaced the brown sugar with a 1/4 cup of the splenda brown sugar blend and I added nuts the result were great cookies that no one new were made with splenda. There was no after taste as with some other splenda recipes.

I've always used 1/4 cup of the regular Splenda Blend  and made great cookies.  I also omit the salt since I use "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter" which is unfortunately pre-salted.  I also do not use any electric mixer, but rely on a good wooden spoon and a big bowl to break up and flatten the "ICBINB" chunks.  I also find that once you start to add the flour mixture and start to mix, the chunks eventually dissipate in the batter.  I also use less choc. chips since I make these for my husband (who is diabetic) and use real choc. chips (fake choc. chips are just awful).  We also both like the cookie part and not so many chips anyway.  Just spoon out the dough and don't bother to flatten.  I also use parchment paper.

This cookie has great potential.  I cooked them in several different ways.  This last time I added M & M minis, and oatmeal.  I'm not sure on the exact amount of oatmeal, just until it looked right to me.  Also, to make a chewier and more moist cookie, I used dark brown sugar instead of light brown.  This is a wonderful edition! I then cooked them a little less time, until the top was barely solid, with only a little browning.  It turned into such  a soft and chewy cookie.  My goodness, they disappeared.

Everyone in my family likes these. And, friends from church ask for the recipe as they are so good. They are fun to take to friends as I believe they are better for everyone than regular chocolate chip cookies.

The cookies were very good, more like mini-cakes than cookies. I used splenda granulated which would be one cup instead of half a cup of splenda blend, but for some reason it turned out a bit too sweet like that. I would try to reduce the amount of splenda granulated by one to two tablespoons.

This recipe was kinda cakey, mainly because it was not loaded with veggie oil like other chocolate chip recipes. Don't let that stop you from trying the recipe, the cookies are GOOD! :) I like just a little less cake just add just an extra tablespoon butter (less then a quarter stick). I also use straight up Splenda instead of the blend, because that is what we use in our house. I like to shape the cookie dough slightly flattened and freeze it for baking later. Try this recipe with different morsels, I like white chocolate morsels.  ~~~Sharon

I was never successful in baking cookies, especially trying to bake w/o "real" sugar. Those cookies are amazing. you cannot taste the difference and they are so delicious

Good taste; light and airy texture inside and just enough crisp on the outside.  I used whole wheat pastry flour and put less choc chips in than it calls for - which was still plenty.  Made about 2 dozen cookies.  Yum!
