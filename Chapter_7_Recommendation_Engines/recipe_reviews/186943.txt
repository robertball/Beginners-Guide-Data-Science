I made this and it was really good.  I ended up adding an 8 oz can of tomato sauce as it really didn't coat the penne pasta enuf... I also, made it in a 9x13 dish and it was all the way to the top before I added the cheese...I let it bake, then added the cheese to melt...I used more than an 8 oz package...I made this and shared with our neighbor whose birthday was yesterday...She is a real picky eater and she liked it...

Very simple to assemble - got positive comments from the crew. Only change was to go 1/2 Italian sausage meat, 1/2 ground beef.

Very good.  This made a ton.  I used broken lasagna noodles instead of penne and a bit more sauce, but I was using a full pound of noodles.

I've been making something like this for a long time, only we called it Jill's Mom's Lasagna and used broken lasagna noodles. This took me fifteen minutes to throw together, from start to finish. I did make one change and use my own homemade spaghetti sauce, which had both sausage and ground beef in it. I made no other changes. This worked out great for me because it used up half a batch of spaghetti sauce and penne pasta that I had sitting around.

Very good! I had a craving for lasagna but wanted something quicker. This fit the bill. Kids loved it. I used one box of penne pasta and a jar and a half of pasta sauce. Made great leftovers and it was very easy to make!

This is a great weeknight recipe and we usually have leftovers for another meal or lunches. I use riccota cheese and mix in some parmesan and 1 egg for the cheese filling. It doesn't take much more time to mix that up and it gives it a more authentic lasagna flavor.  Sometimes I use sliced cooked sweet Italian sausage and layer it in rather than cooking the sausage in the sauce. I actually prefer this to real lasagna, just as good for half the work!

I'm rating this based on my husband's opinion...I would have given it a 3 but I think it's because I don't like Italian sausage that much!  So, he said it was great with the sausage.  I'd make it with hamburger for myself.  Simple and fast, so points for that!

Great for a weeknight family dinner~  I stretched it (added a little more sauce, cheese), to make 2 8 x 8's- one for now and one to freeze for later!  Kids really liked it.

I love this recipe! It's easy and everyone loves it. I also use my oun sacue and on "creative" days I add a layer of chopped, well drained ( frozen and thawed) spinach. This recipe needs 2 boxes or a fmly- sized bag. Great stuff and you get to sneak in a veggie.

This was delish, I'm eating my leftovers as I type. I cooked it last night but made some changes. The dish obviously isn't the healthiest so I used whole grain pasta instead and I sauteed mushrooms and zucchini beforehand and added them in step 3. I used an 11x7 baking dish, leaving lots of left overs. I liked my pasta bakes a little burnt on top so I put it in broil for 5 minutes at the end.

Was ok.  Maybe next time I'll add garlic to the skillet before cooking the meat.  Once it was done, it missed the garlic flavoring per my husband.  Quick and easy dish though.  Served with salad and toasted bread with butter.

Oh, my gosh, this was really, really good. I thought the cottage cheese wouldn't taste right, but it was great. It was a hit with the family, too. This is a great alternative to making actual lasagna, which we love but takes forever to make and store-bought just doesn't cut it. I will add a bit more sauce next time, maybe a can and a half. But other than that, it was perfect as it and super easy. Thank you.

This was a quick alternative to lasagne and everyone loved it.  It makes for a great weekday dinner.  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese and provolone for the mozzerella and finally rigatonni noodles for the penne.  I also added extra garlic as we are garlic lovers.  I will definitely make this again.

This is basically like a baked rigatoni or baked ziti. So, I used bowtie noodles because they are flatter, more like a lasagna noodle. I increased the quantity to 4 cups of pasta. I switched out the cottage cheese for ricotta. I suggest topping with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Next time I might throw in a little spinach to give it more lasagna flavor. A good way to fix the lasagna craving without all the work of layering. However; this is not enough pasta to feed 8 people.

This is a solid 4 star recipe as written.  To make it totally terrific, next time I will add additional sauce, both cheeses, and add an egg, parmesan cheese and parsley or italian seasoning to the cottage cheese.  I did use hot italian sausage, and will do that again unless I'm making it for kids.

This was a very simple recipe and tasted great. I mixed italian seasoning and parmesan cheese in with the cottage cheese. Next time I will also add in crushed red pepper to the meat for a little added kick.

My Boys loved this and the 11 year old is pretty picky. Will make again! The only change I made was to add a raw egg to the cottag cheese before spreading, it makes it a little firmer.

This was a great, easy, tasty recipe, perfect for a weeknight when you need to cook a meal but don't have much energy. I don't eat meat, so I used vegetarian Italian sausage, and it came out fine! Would definitely recommend.

This seems to take a little longer in the oven than noted.  I do 25 minutes covered and 10 minutes uncoverd and if you like broil top for a minute or two to be a bit more visually appealing.

Also, I have made this with the Jimmy Dean precooked turkey sausage and just saute some garlic, onions and add red pepper flakes to taste for a healthy version.

I made this recipe exactly as directed except I substituted the italian sausage with ground beef since we don't like italian sausage and I also used broken up lasagne shells.  This is a good substitute for the real thing (in fact my son thought it WAS the real thing.)  The only thing I would change is to add spices like garlic powder and maybe italian seasonings.  I baked this in a 9x13 inch pan which worked fine.

i made this for a small get together in my home, and i am glad i did!! everyone liked it and some asked for the recipe. They were surprised at the simplicity of ingredients. I did change a few things as follows:

2 cups pasta (1lb box) same
1lb hot italian sausage
1 26oz can 4 cheese tomato sauce
12 oz (1 cup 1/2) cottage cheese
added 2 eggs (medium size) to cottage and about 1/4 cup grated parmesean cheese
also some left over fresh spinach.

the layers were arranged: sauce, pasta, cottage, sauce, shredded cheese.
somehow my recipe yielded enough to fill a small bundt pan and almost fill a 9x9? sqare glass pan.

IMPORTANT: i cooked the sausage, and added the tomato sauce, but did NOT cook the noodles.

YUM!!!

I started making this recipe a while back 'cause it's so much easier than "real" lasagna.  One point: It's not necessary to boil the sauce, meat and pasta first.. that just overcooks the pasta.  Just mix it up and assemble for the oven.  Even quicker! Thanks!

I love this.  I sauteed an onion with ground beef.  I only had Orzo pasta and my husband called it Lasagna-Rice.  When I told him the only other option was Chinese noodles he said Yaki-Sagna.  LOL.  Thanks for a quick idea!

I used turkey burger and it was delicious! I'm sure it would have been just as good as with the sausage, I just didn't have any when I whipped this together. Very easy to make! Will definitely be making again!

I thought this was very good.  I used actual Hilshire farms Turkey sausage and no sugar added pasta sauce for a very healthy lasagna taste and everyone loved it.

Simple, yummy, a new family favorite!  I substituted ricotta for the cottage cheese out of preference.  I like light sauce - some may prefer to add a bit more.

Only a slight change due to what was on hand. I used ground beef and ground pork (seasoned with Italian seasoning) and a whole box of penne pasta (it's really not much more than the 2 cuos it calls for) which I'm sure is why I had to add more sauce. Great recipe and the family loved it!

Made just as written, except used more cottage cheese to cover bottom layer, and added 1 minced clove of garlic to browned sausage.  Delicious!  Used top quality spaghetti sauce and italian sausage.  Served with Tomato and Green Pepper Salad from this site.  Great combo!

I've been making this for yrs. I used hot gr.sausage, rigatoni, and ricotti cheese instead of cottage cheese. I also found putting it in a casserole instead of a pan keeps it from getting dry...I mix everything up, put in casserole and top with remaining cheese

I cooked this recipe last night, my only change was I added an egg, extra garlic powder, parsley and oregano to the cottage cheese. It was very good and I will be making it on a regular basis for my family.

YUM! My kids ate it, it was easy to make and quick to bake. I added mushrooms for something extra. It can be simplified if you do like I did and fry twice as much sausage meat and freeze half of it for next time. And I am sure you could use any left-over pasta and veggies. I'd love to try dooubling it in a bigger casserole and freezing the leftovers. Very filling!

This recipe was so easy & delicious!  I used 3 cups of cottage cheese though.  I aso baked this in a 9 by 13 inch dish too!  Many leftovers from this dish with just me & my husband - I actually froze 2 containers for future meals to come!

Very simple to put together- I used elbow macaroni as I didn't have penne. I only had one jar of sauce, it was enough, but may have added a bit more if I had another jar. I used a 9X13 pan and with a 1-lb box of elbows, I filled the whole pan, and even filled a 1.5 quart pan which I'm freezing for next week or so. It was tasty and easy, I only gave three stars because it's not gourmet- but seriously worth making for a quick weeknight dinner.

Perfect for a week night meal! I made it with Honeysuckle Turkey Italian Sausage, fat free cottage cheese and fat free shredded mozarella - omitting the top layer of cheese since the fat free doesn't melt very good.  I followed the recipe exactly, with my noted less fat/calorie substitutions.  This was just so darn good!  My 7 year old daughter even had seconds - YAY!

This is a great recipe, easy to prepare and delicious.  I used Ragu Tomato, Onion and Garlic sauce.  The only change I made was adding about 1/4 cup of shredded parmesan cheese to each layer of cheese.  I cooked it 25 minutes covered and another 15 uncovered until the cheese was melted and browned on the edges.  I will definately make this again.  The only change I may make next time is using more cottage cheese.

I made it with ground beef. I seasoned the beef with sauteed green onions, bell pepper and mushrooms...all diced and cooked till tender with garlic salt and black pepper in olive oil ( 2T). The pasta was boiled in H2O & 2  garlic OXO cubes. The cheese filling was made with ricotta, 1 beaten egg, 1/2 C parmesan and 2T green onion tops. The mozzarella final layer was also mixed with 1/4 C parmesan. I sprayed the foil with cooking spray before baking so the cheese wouldn't stick to it....

Made this tonight and it was good.  I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 sausage, also added chopped onions to meat mixture cuz we like onions in the sauce.   I thought it would be a bit dry so added another layer of sauce over the top.  Cheese gets too dried up if baked very long so for us it goes on top after baking, just leave in oven to melt.  With a salad this turned into a tasty five star meal.

So good! I think I almost prefer this to actually making lasagna. I do make changes per personal tastes. I half the recipe and use 2 cups of egg noodles. I also use ground beef mixed with Italian sausage seasoning the meat with Italian Seasoning and adding onion, garlic, mushrooms, and green pepper while browning the meat. I also use more cheeses: Sharp Cheddar and Parmesan as well. It comes out the perfect balance of gooey, cheesy, meaty, and yummy! Even halved, this feeds 2 adults for dinner and lunch the next day and even dinner again. We always have it with a garden or ceasar salad.

This was so easy for a weeknight dinner. I did alter the recipe slightly to add additional veggies and also to stretch this to feed 10, but it did not alter the basic product. I did add the equivalent for 3 cups of cottage cheese as 1 cup would not have been enough. Everyone loved it and sent a serving home with a friend for his lunch the next day. You can make this a day ahead and refrigerate overnight - the flavor actually gets better. Just bring to room temperature before baking.

I made this recipe last night and it was delicious!
The only change I made was adding onion and green bellpepper while the sausage was browning.
Thanks for sharing this recipe with my family!

This was easy, fast, and yummy! I used ground beef because I had it on hand.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  Thanks for this quick dinner!
