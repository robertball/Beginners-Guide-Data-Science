This is the same way I make my spaghetti bake, just using different noodles.  I made it today and it turned out great!  Very easy!

The name for this recipe is misleading because it really isn't chili at all - not even any chili flavor.

Kind of dry and definitely not chili. Should be titled as a pasta bake. Need to double the amount of sauce.
