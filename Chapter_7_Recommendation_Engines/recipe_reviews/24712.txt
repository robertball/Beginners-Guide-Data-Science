I skipped the green beans and onions, but added Chinese mushrooms, red bell pepper and tofu to this dish. I made the stir fry by first sauteing the ginger and garlic, then adding all of the vegetables, followed by the tofu. Next, I added the soy sauce and then the cornstarch in water to make the stir fry sauce. Tossing the vegetables in an oil-cornstarch mix may have caused the "gummy texture" problems reported by other viewers.

This is a good basic stir fry recipe. If you find it bland, you can increase the amount of ginger and garlic, as well as add a bit of chili paste or crushed red pepper flakes to give it a bit more kick.

Being asian and having grown up with authentic asian stir-fry's, I consider this dish a good imitation. I added several additional ingredients, such as fish sauce.  Overall, good.

VERY YUMMY! I'm glad I found this today. I was in the mood for something good. Of course I had to tweak your recipe a bit for my family, but your garlic/ginger/corn starch blend is a keeper! Here is what I did tonight- Hubby demands meat, so cooks chicken breast first and cut it up. I used two bags of Walmart brand sugar snap peas stir fry (1.50/bag), I had to use powdered ginger this time (but I'm sure the fresh would be AWESOME, will try that next time). Since I had so many veggies, I doubled the soy sauce. I also added a can of pineapple chuncks with the juice just before serving. VERY GOOD! thank you for posting!

My husband, 20-month-old son, and I all enjoyed this recipe.  I've already prepared it twice.  Only modifications were more garlic and used dark sesame oil for a more rich flavor.  Great for use with any seasonal veggies.

I didn't have the veggies that this recipe called for so I just used what I had on hand (carrots, red pepper, celery, broccoli, and some spinach) but kept it to about the same amount of veggies over all.  I followed the rest of the recipe as stated except I didn't add the extra salt (1/2 tbsp) at the end.  I'm glad I didn't if I had it would have been way too salty.  Next time I'm not going to add the cornstarch at the begining but leave it to the end to be added with the soy sauce and water.  I found the cornstarch made the bottom of my wok sticky while I was stir frying the veggies.  Over all a good recipe for any combination of veggies you have on hand.

Wow. This one is such a keeper. I didn't have any of the fresh veggies listed, so I used frozen carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower - plus I added some chicken. I am in love with ginger, and this definitely satisfies the craving for it. THANK YOU!

A great, simple recipe. To make it easier, I used ginger paste and minced garlic from a jar, and frozen vegetables. I just made it tonight..yum!

This was pretty good, but nothing spectacular...not as much flavor as I expected.  I even used 3 cloves of minced garlic, and half sesame oil for more flavor. Also, seems there is too much oil...you could probably use half the called-for amount and be fine.

Yummmm! I mixed this w/ soba noodles and seitan and it was great! A light ginger flavor and it works so well w/ the veggies. It's like a dish one would get in a restaurant. It smalls really good while making too.

Excellent.  I paired this recipe the the Sesame Noodles recipe on this website (by scoopnana).  I had leftovers of both dishes, and the next day I mixed them together - it was better then eating them separately.  I highly suggest pairing the two - make each as directed, and combine for a lovely flavor and a more filling meal that both you and your family.guests will love!

I've been making this for years (usually with broccoli, carrots, soy beans, mushrooms and red paprika) but I use a sweet soy sauce (ketjap manis) and before serving I sprinkle it with sesame seeds which I first fry golden brown in a dry frying pan.

Great flavor but doesn't need the salt at the end of the recipe.  Also great with added veggies & tofu (or your favorite meat).

This always turns out great and is always a hit with friends. I add more ginger and garlic than called for and pretty much whatever veggies I have on hand. Mushrooms soak up the juices really well and I always have those on hand for this recipe. Easy, delicious.

This was excellent.  For veggies I used asparagus, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, carrots and green onions.  Because my kids won't eat veggies with anything on them I did not coat the veggies with the cornstarch, garlic, ginger and oil mixture.  What I did instead was to stir fry the plain veggies in 2 tbsp of oil.  Then I removed the kids portion. I mixed the cornstarch, garlic, all the ginger, 2 tbsp oil, the soy sauce and water together then added this mixture to the veggies in the wok.  I continued to stir fry until the garlic and ginger were tender.  I did not add any salt as soy sauce contains salt.  I also used low sodium soy sauce to try and cut down the salt content.  I served the kids plain veggies over chow mein noodles and I served my husband's and my portions over rice.  Was delicious!  I would definitely make this again.  I might try adding some tofu next time for some protein.  Although it was filling enough without it.

I thought it was way too salty. If you're using soy sauce, you don't need additional salt.

Very good!  I was pleasantly surprised.  I added tofu which I cut in cubes and fried in sesame oil (set on med-low) with soy sauce. Even my daughter's friends, who usually don't eat tofu, enjoyed this recipe.

As written, I'm giving the recipe 4 stars because we liked it better with some tweaks.  It needs some chili paste (about 1 tbsp), more vegetables (mushrooms, bell peppers, zucchini, or whatever you like), less oil (use sesame oil), and no additional salt.  Also, the directions are too complicated ... just saute the garlic, ginger and veggies in 2 tbsp of oil until the veggies are tender-crisp, then stir in the soy sauce, the cornstarch/water slurry, and the chili paste.  But it's a good base recipe that you can modify (or not) to your own taste.

Excellent! Yes to more garlic and instead of soy sauce, to make it healthier I used Bragg's Liquid Amino's (non-GMO, organic) and tastes just like soy sauce. YUMMMM!!! Everyone loved this!

This wasn't very good.  WAY too salty.  Substitute sesame oil for flavor.  Double garlic.  Add a pinch of crushed red pepper.  Eliminate the salt (there's already soy sauce!  Why another half Tbsp?).  Finally, whisk the corn starch into the soy sauce and water mixture rather than adding it at the beginning.  Corn starch should always be added near the end to thicken the sauce.

Bottom line: Easy, delicious and versatile but leave out the salt.  
I have made this recipe with a variety of vegetables, whatever I had on hand at the time and it was always well received.  As others noted, the initial sauce needs to be doubled or tripled, depending on the volume of vegetables used, however, I would leave the oil at two tablespoons otherwise it will be too greasy (learned the hard way).  Also, when using the amount of soy sauce AND salt listed, the vegetables were way too salty.  One or the other can be left off altogether, I liked it best when omitting the salt but retaining the the soy sauce.

Delicious and very easy!  I made it as listed, except used dry ginger since I didn't have any fresh and just added about a tablespoon of Thai Chilli Paste and a shake of red pepper flakes at the end.  I liked that it was simple to make!  I used a variety of garden vegetables:  snow peas, broccoli, carrot, green pepper, zucchini, bok choy and onion, then added some leftover pork loin cut into strips.

Awesome, I added about 2 tablepoons of ginger since I really like the fragrant spiciness and I wanted a little heat so additionally I added 1/4 teaspoon of chipotle powder. I wanted this as a main course so first I sauteed some thinly sliced chicken strips over high heat to get them browned and slightly cripsy in 1 teaspoon of canola oil. I used the vegetables listed since I like them all and added a few crimini mushrooms. 1/4 cup oil seemed a little much so I removed about a tablespoon, perfect. I added the oil and the vegetables and cooked them over high (not meduim) heat to get them slightly browned but still crunchy. I mixed the soy sauce with the water then added the cornstarch and mixed it until it was smooth and added this last so I could control the thickening since I knew it would thicken relatively fast. When it was done (about 20 seconds) I removed it from the heat and salted to taste, I probably used about 1 teaspoon since the soy sauce was salty. Served it over brown rice and it was darn tasty. Definately will be making this again. Oh yea, I used about 4 cloves of garlic, love the taste. I sauteed them first to get them a caramel color then added the vegetables.

This was really good; the husband even asked where I got the recipe. I used vegies on hand and I also added the cornstarch at the end with the soysauce and water. I did not add any salt and it seemed to be just right. Thanks!

My husband and I enjoyed it, but I do not think it worthy of a 4 or 5 star rating.  It  was average.  I'll need to keep searching a bit better recipe.

I made this exactly as it is except I added more veggies.  I added snap peas, boc choy, celery, portabello mushroom and greenbeans but I thought that the sauce was flavorless.  I would probably add more garlic and more low sodium soy sauce, I would eliminate the cornstarch and I would possible throw in a splash of hoisin or maybe terriaki or just add some fresh finely chopped parsley - something to add some flavor.

I needed a vegetable side and as soon as I logged onto this website and I saw this recipe on the front page featured as "Recipe of the Day". I used snap sugar peas instead of snow peas but had everything else. I chopped up a little red onions and added red bell peppers for color and texture. I blanched the broccoli crowns so it would be easier to stir fry and retain its bright green color. I just eye-balled the cornstarch mixture and made sure to evenly coat the veggies before stir frying it. I grated the fresh ginger and minced up the garlic clove. I did add a little more soy sauce for taste but omitted the water. I like the crisp yet tender crunch of the vegetables. I am glad that I pre-boiled the broccoli crowns as it was cooked just right. The ginger, garlic and soy sauce is a nice touch, not a strong flavor but light enough that I can taste it. Next time I will use sesame oil in palce of the vegetable oil for a different layer of flavor. The mixed vegetables make this a pretty side dish. I served this with, "Asian Turkey Burgers," also from this site.

So good!  Followed the recipe exactly. I had never had snow peas before and now have a new favorite veggie!  Loved the sauce!  Next time I may add some red, yellow or orange peppers for more color.

Fantastic recipe!!!
The best thing about this recipe is that you can use ANY veggies you may have lying around.
I used zucchini, yellow squash, diced carrots, bell pepper, snow peas, and onion. I also used dry ginger (2tsp is perfect), sesame oil (1/2 tsp), and about 1 tbsp of sesame seeds.
I also made this with some strips of left over steak (add last), and it was so yummy!

Great recipe!  Followed exactly as listed, but could be better with some different veggies.  2nd time I made this, I used a red and green bell pepper, tofu, snow peas, onions and some mushrooms- and it was even better!

Very good! Light ginger and soy sauce flavor. Did not have broccoli on hand, but added in some chopped up chicken breast, yellow squash, red pepper, and baby portabella mushrooms. Would maybe use a little less vegetable oil next time.

This has great potential. I used the veg I had on hand (broccoli, carrots, cabbage, and green onion) but used the sauce exactly as described. It was pretty tasty, I think next time I will add some red pepper flake to give it a little spice and will probably add some extra soy sauce and sesame oil. It was a good base though. Will make again with modifications.

What a fast, easy, and delicious recipe! I did use tofu, which I had thawed from frozen and stir-fried before throwing in the veggies to make for a slightly crispy outside. I also added a little garlic-chili sauce to the vegetables and a little pineapple juice (as another reviewer suggested) which added the perfect amount of sweetness to match a little spicey and salty flavor. Lastly, as this recipe states, you can throw in almost any veggies to make this great! I used canned green beans myself (the kids don't like fresh or frozen..)as well as canned bamboo shoots and water chestnuts I had on hand. So tasty and the kids loved it! A definite to make again.

Good recipe! I also added in some chunks of potato which was really tasty. I think next time I will dbl. up the broccoli (I love broccoli & it absorbs the soy & ginger so well). I also recommend adding in all the ginger at the beginning. Biting down on half-raw fresh ginger is kind of yucky. :)

This recipe was a big hit with my husband.  Like everyone else, I made some changes.  I added more ginger, because we love it.  I also used chicken stock instead of water, and I added about a Tablespoon plus a teaspoon of sugar.  Forget about the weird stes to this recipe.  Stirfry the veggies in oil until they just start to get tender.  Add all the other ingredients, stir to coat and you are there!

This was VERY good!  My first time doing stir-fry, and the results were fantastic.  I used a little less oil, and a touch of toasted sesame oil.  I also put all of the ginger in first (on accident) and added the onions w/the other veggies.  I partially covered the veggies as they were cooking to speed along the process and keep the juices in.  It worked very well.  I used a red bell pepper instead of snow peas.  I added a bit more carrots and green beans.  I would add more carrots next time.  Omitted the salt at the end, and used reduced-sodium soy sauce.  Served with Maple Salmon and brown rice.  A really, really good meal.  I couldn't stop eating it!

Delicious!  I used powdered ginger instead of real ginger, olive oil for the mixture, red bell pepper instead of snow peas, cooking spray for the pan, and a pinch of salt at the end.  This came out very good.  Will make again!   I'll add sesame oil next time and some sesame seeds as some others have suggested.  You could really use any veggies or meats in this!  Flavor was so good.

nice flavour.  added more ginger to give it that extra zing, and at BF's request.  like others, i skipped the "coating" step and just added the soy sauce mixture when the veggies were almost done.  when time permits (and i feel like it) i toss in bite size agedashi tofu (also on allrecipes).  great way to get all your favourtie veg & protein.

Best stir fry I've made in a long time.  In the past I've used frozen vegetables and packaged sauce mixes, but NO more!  A goal for this year is to eliminate processed foods in my home and do more scratch cooking with more vegetables.  And boy, this recipe fit the bill and was SO tasty.  Lots of flavor and lots of crispy fresh veggies.  The least healthy part was the jasmine rice I served it with, but that's a must have.  
I made this recipe pretty much as written.  I did toss the veggies in the cornstarch mix but didn't have a problem with gumminess.  However, I did make more sauce (extra 2T soy and 4T water) so perhaps that helped.  I also added 1T hot szechuan marinade to give extra flavor without making it too spicy for any family members.  We like a little extra sauce with the rice so those amounts worked well.

I used reduced sodium soy sauce and did not add the extra salt.  However, since I made extra sauce the dish had plenty of salt.  More would have probably been too much. 

I used all fresh ingredients: ginger(half amt), garlic, broccoli florets, julienned carrots, sugar snap peas, green onions, and sliced red cabbage.  What a yummy and healthy meal.  Definitely a do-again!!

Thanks, Veggigoddess.  :)

The picture doesn't match the recipe, but you could easily customize it so that it does.

This recipe was quick, easy, healthy & very tasty.  We'll definitely be making it again.

This reipe really works great with any vegetables. I used broccoli, red pepper, cauliflower, green beans, cucumber and onion. Just whatever I had in the house! I also added some chicken and it turned out great!

This was really easy and really tasty with the fresh ginger but I did not follow the recipe to a "t".  I omitted the salt and I'm sure glad I did!  Used sesame oil in place of the vegetable oil, added some julienne zucchini and about a tsp of red curry paste at the end.   Yummy!

This is a fast, easy recipe with good flavor.  I use reduced sodium soy sauce and skip the added salt at the end and it suits me just fine.  I have made this recipe as written and found that the corn starch globs up with the oil and doesn't get distributed very well, so now I add the cornstarch to the soy sauce and water mixture.  Works just fine.  Use whatever veggies you have on hand.  I personally like julienned carrots, sweet bell peppers, mushrooms, broccoli, green onion, and broccoli.  I also add a little chili sauce to spice it up and reduce the oil because I'm watching fat and calories.  Add some sliced chicken breast and you have a great meal.

As with many other reviewers, I used a lot of the family favorite veggies. I mixed the cornstarch as to the directions, but did not add veggies to the mix as the recipe had stated, instead I waited and put the cornstarch mixture in with the soy sauce and water. Served over brown rice .. plan on making again, but think I will use some of the soy sauce and or water to dissolve the cornstarch and cook garlic in with rest of veggies ..

This was easy and very tasty. Our only complaint was that we wanted more sauce to help coat the rice. So next time I might try adding more liquid. But the flavor was great - thanks for the recipe!

I added chicken, which was good. I also used the veggies I had on hand. My ginger I had bought was bad so I used ground ginger, which didn't have much of an effect. It was good though!

I love that this is a good basic stir-fry recipe that allows you to use whatever veggies you have on hand.  I used broccoli, carrots, red bell pepper, green onions, & water chestnuts.  The lovely gingery sauce was very good as is, but even better with a little hot chili garlic sauce tossed in.  This made for a simple, light, flavorful dinner.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!  :)

Just two of us, but I made a second batch because it didn't look like it would be enough as a main dish (on top of rice)and it was easy. My changes were using ginger powder (less than 2 tsp), Sesame oil instead of veg oil. NO SALT NECESSARY. Try adding 1 TBL. soy sauce, taste, and then add the other TBL soy sauce if needed. I actually thought one tasted fine, but added honey to get rid of the salty taste. Stir often. Take veggies out of wok before they soften too much from sitting around). Oh! I also added mushrooms and red peppers for color and sliced almonds for crunch.  Sometimes I'll include shrimp. YOU'LL LOVE THIS RECIPE! Great for vegians and those fasting. Thank you veggigoddess.

I thought this was just okay. The cornstarch and water do need to be added nearer to the end, as another reviewer noted, because otherwise you end up with a gummy mess in the pan throughout cooking. I added some red peppers and some sesame seeds, along with my marinated, baked tofu (so yummy!).

Great, basic stir fry sauce.  My version:  I mixed it all together and voila, yumminess.  I mixed - 1 Tbsp corn starch, 1 large clove garlic minced, 1 heaping tsp of crushed ginger, 1 Tbsp olive oil, and 3 Tbsp veggie broth (to cut the fat).  Added half of sauce to hot wok, mixed veggies in until they were mostly covered, mixed rest of sauce, stir fried it all up.  I had to add a bit more veggie broth but it was a really good flavor, not over powering yet not non-existent.

I really enjoyed this dish!  I used what veggies I had on hand and doubled the sauce since I like my stir-frys saucy.  I didn't toss the veggies in the cornstarch mix beforehand, worried that it might make it gummy.  Instead I just let the vegetables cook in my wok until almost ready and then added the sauce all at once and let it simmer until ready.  Very happy with the sauce recipe, will use it again as a base for other variations!

This was a good starter recipe, but I did change a few things. I didn't have cornstarch so omitted it, used different veggies because it was what I had on hand (used brocoli, carrots, bean sprouts, mushrooms, zuchinni, and chinese cabbage) I also added some extra ginger and garlic as well as red pepper flakes, then served over couscous. It ended up very similar to a dish my mom used to make that I LOVED so this was really good!

very easy - used red, orange, yellow bellpepper, mushrooms and broccoli.  Added slightly more ginger and garlic (fresh), served with basmati rice, and added pine nuts.  No leftovers, quite healthy and tasty.

I made this as the recipes say except for two things:  I add some korean hot sauce in the water and soy sauce mix.  I also used just 1 1/2 T. of oil to stir fry the veggies and put 1/2 t. of sesame oil into the water soy sauce mix.  I served it with steamed brown rice and it was so good!  Even my boyfriend, who thinks a meal without meat isn't a real mean said it was great.  YUM!

Good light flavor. I think next time I will try it without the cornstarch so the veggies wont be as thick and stick together. I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I will keep everything else the same. It was very good.

I was looking for a recipe that would really showcase the fresh broccoli and green beans I picked up at the farmers' market, and this was perfect. There's nothing to mask the flavor of the fresh veggies, just the ginger, soy, and garlic to enhance it. I also threw in a handful of fresh cilantro leaves right before serving. My only suggestion is to taste when adding salt -- mine turned out a bit on the salty side. I have a feeling I'll be making this recipe a lot.

Great recipe! I made it for a Mother's Day luncheon, and people loved it. I used frozen veggies, though.  Had a very Asian feel to it. Very nice.

Wife and I both enjoyed it.  She hates veggies and commented that she’d eat more if I made this more often.  I made a few changes to the recipe to cut down on sodium and phytoestrogens.

1.	Replaced the ½ cup of snow peas with ½ cup of extra onion.
2.	Did 2 cloves of garlic instead of 1 ½
3.	Used olive oil instead of vegetable oil
4.	Used Coconut Aminos instead of soy sauce
5.	Did not use salt
6.	Used an entire lemon for juice while sautéing 

Will definitely do this again!

Agree with other reviewers - saute garlic and ginger, then add veggies.  When veggies are mostly done add tofu if you want, finish with the cornstarch mixture.  Decent basic stir fry recipe and a good starting point.

I used a mixture of fresh and frozen veggies and that worked out just fine. (Frozen organic broccoli at Costco beats anything fresh I've ever had.) Next time I'll add more flavoring because it was a little bland. Red pepper flakes will be on the list.

The family and really liked this recipe. 

I used broccoli, julienned carrots, snow peas, quartered baby portabella mushrooms, and onion. 
I first cubed firm tofu, dried it off on paper towels, and fried them in oil till golden brown. 
I then cooked up the veggies as per the recipe in the remaining oil. I doubled all the ingredients, and added extra ginger and garlic because we like those flavors.  
Last thing I did was toss the crispy tofu in with the veggies and served it over brown rice. 

Very delicious.

Coating the vegetables with the cornstarch mixture, prior to frying, is an awesome idea. Thanks for the suggestion!  I usually fry thinly sliced chicken breast or pork tenderloin in the wok then follow your recipe as written, using about half the oil - sesame oil is my favorite - and no additional salt.  My vegetables choices include green cabbage, mushrooms, carrots, onion, celery, and red pepper.  Top each serving with chow mien noodles for extra crunch.

As prepared, this is actually just an average, nothing-to-write-home-about Veggie Stir Fry.  To really make it a Ginger Stir Fry, you need to add at least 5 times the amount of fresh ginger to bring out that flavor.  Also, no need to add additional salt; the soy sauce makes it salty enough.  And, I did not see the benefit of the corn starch.

Love this recipe. I add whatever veggies we have in the fridge and throw them all in at the same time. Usually includes onions, carrots, mushrooms, broccoli, bell peppers and zucchini. Cook for 5 minutes max and add soy sauce and water. Serve over rice.

Great recipe and easy to change to your own tastes. I added 4 cloves of garlic (we love garlic!) and used frozen and fresh veggies of what I had on hand with a bit of chicken. Yummmmy! Also cut down the oil, I am sure the veggies are great tossed as mentioned, but trying to cut down on calories. Definitely worth giving a try!

It's looks beautiful on the plate and tastes delicious.  Use your favorite veggies.  I skipped the cauliflower, used brussels sprouts cut in half, added whole mushrooms and a can of cubed pineapple.  I also diced two chicken breasts and sauteed them before I added the veggies.  Do use fresh ginger - it makes all the difference in the world.

Pretty good.  The cornstarch really helped to thicken up the sauce at the end.  I think I undercooked my veggies a little bit, so I will probably extend the cooking time at the end.

I just made this and the way I did it tasted AMAZING! For vegtable haters this is the way to eat them. I did it exactly like the recipe said except the vegtable i use was baby carrots chopped realy small, chopped celery, thinly sliced red and yellow bell pepper , broccoli, frozen corn kernals, frozen green beans and a little red onion.
I chose those because that's just what I had. I only had 1 tsp of gingar. And I followed the advice of another review and added the cornstarch in  the water and soy sauce instead of at the beggining and it wasn't gummy at all. Over all this was great, but in my opinion it was lacking in spice a bit. Next time I think I'll add some crushed red pepper, Will make this again. (:(:

This was an easy recipe to prepare so I gave it three stars.  However for flavor it wasn't great.  I added black pepper and extra soy sauce to give the veggies some sort of flavor.  I would not follow this recipe again.

This was pretty good - there was nothing "bad" about it, but it was a little bland for my taste. If I was a vegetarian it would have probably been great, but I'm not, and this wasn't filling enough, as is, to be a main course dish. I added water chestnuts for a bit of a crunch. It's a good start, but could use a bit of pizazz.

This recipe was just WONDERFUL!!!  I make stir-fry dishes a lot, and typically I just buy a jar of "stir fry sauce".  Lately the saltiness of those sauces has been bothering me, so I searched to find a great veggie stir fry on allrecipes.  I am so thrilled to have found this one!  My 10 year old daughters loved it, my husband had seconds and told me to "put it on the regular rotation" meaning make it often!   The only changes that I made were 1) used ginger paste instead of fresh ginger (so convenient!)   2) I used fresh broccoli, fresh green beans, and I used the bagged shredded carrots.  I just used a little extra green beans instead of adding the snow peas. I can't wait to make this again!!!  Thank you!

This recipe is very good. I tweaked it here and there, like with a lot more ginger, garlic and soy. I added bean sprouts instead of green beans and also some green onions and chicken. I also noticed it need a little more moisture so I added about a 1/4 cup of water to the mix so the veggies could steam better. Will most definately make this again!

I make this all the time.  It's a regular in my meal rotation, and a very good meal to make in a pinch because I use two bags of frozen stir fry vegetables instead of fresh ones.  The fresh ginger and garlic are really what make this dish pop.

I made this for dinner the other night, and it was wonderful!!! I love fresh ginger! I ommited the green beans (didnt have any) and added fresh chopped mushrooms instead. Other than that, followed exactly...This is definately a keeper. Great served with Chinese egg rolls from this site.

Mmm this was an ideal weeknight meal- quick but very delicious!  To avoid a gummy texture I added the cornstarch and water after the veggies had sauteed in the oil for about 20 minutes.  I also upped the amounts of ginger and garlic, and added some crushed red pepper flakes.  Great recipe- thanks! =)

This could be chalked up to personal preferences, but I was disappointed. I followed the directions as written, except for adding chicken. Dish was slimy and oily, (the mixture of cornstarch and oil)and I couldn't taste the fresh ginger I grated. Won't try it again, but we did eat all of it - not a total disaster.

This is great if you like vegetarian.  I added tofu, mushrooms, sugar snap peas instead of green beans, extra garlic & soy sauce. Use what ever fresh veggies you have available.  I didn't add salt since soy sauce has enough salt.  I mixed the water, cornstarch, and soy sauce together after cooking the veggies, and then added it at the end of cooking.  I served this dish over quinoa, but rice would work too.

This turned out very good. I used ginger paste and a mix of frozen vegetables. I doubled the coating to make the whole bag of veggies. This was great over rice. I liked this dish. It could use twice the ginger though and maybe even a smidge of garlic chile paste too. Thanks for a great meal.

This was a very light, tasty stir-fry.  The only change I would make is to double or even triple the liquid ingredients because there really wasn't any sauce to speak of.  I added slices of leftover Marinated Turkey from this site - perfect match!  Great as a stand-alone veggie dish, or with tofu, chicken, pork, or even over lo mein or rice, although as I said I would prefer more sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

This is a fabulous basic stir-fry recipe. It's really versatile, and delicious with whatever veggies you use. I also increased the garlic and  and used half sesame oil in the sauce. I normally use minced ginger from the jar, but I've used powdered ginger as well. (1 tsp.) I doubled the liquid because I love extra sauce for over our rice, but it was just enough to coat the veggies. I would triple it next time.

This recipe is AWESOME! I'm chinese and I must say this tastes like what my mom makes, but better. I used cauliflower in place of carrots since I didn't have any. I may try adding in some mushrooms or tofu next time too.

Absolutely delicious.  I used veggies on hand, broccoli, peppers, snow peas and carrots and it was wonderful.  I substituted quinoa for rice and it was great with the salmon!

This was so quick and easy. I followed the recipe exactly, and it tasted GREAT! I served it with brown rice. This will definitely get in the dinner shuffle. However, the serving size says 6, but I think it is more like 3 or 4.

This is a good recipe because it's easy and it's flexible.  You can make it with whatever vegetables you have on hand.  The sauce is a nice consistency, and the garlic and ginger add great taste.  The flavors are not overly strong.  Thanks for sharing the recipe, Karla!

Great basic for a stir-fry! I needed something superfast so just used a 16oz bag frozen "stir-fry veggies" and added 1# chicken breast. Maybe I just had too much volume, but next time will add more ginger, garlic and soy sauce. Also- you defnitely don't need so much oil. Yum!

Wow! I have been trying to get broccoli to taste like it does in a Chinese restaurant for years- This works! Veggies are tender but not mushy at all. Flavour is excellent! Does not need added salt at the end- soy sauce is enough. A definite keeper!

I made it possibly 20 times already!  It’s delicious. I put the stir-fry on a bed of brown rice.  I made it for my cousin’s family after a funeral, and it traveled/reheat well. I made it for a company pot-luck. It went in a heartbeat. And I make it for myself, because it’s healthy and rewarding after putting in a long day at work. I add my favorite vegetables, which include colorful bell peppers, along with those in the recipe.

I thought this was delicious!  I used veggies I had on hand and used ginger paste from the produce section in place of the fresh ginger.  I cut back on the amount of ginger by half.  It was  perfect!  I will definitely make this again.

As "Veggiegoddess" said, any vegetables work here.  I used all of what she suggested in the recipe except for the green beans and added a few large white mushrooms, sliced; half a green pepper, cut into slices and then halved; 4 asparagus stalks, broken into 2" pieces.  I did everything just as it was written.  I didn't double the coating and there was plenty to make a flavorful dish!  I will make this often as my husband really enjoyed it!  I didn't have any Tofu but will definitely add that next time!

This was good but I have 2 recommendations. First, mince the garlic and ginger, don’t chop. Second, the sodium in the soy sauce stands alone- do not need to add that 1/2 tablespoon of salt.

Turned out great cooked exactly according to recipe, my son and I loved it.  I added red bell pepper and water chestnuts but cooked according to directions.  You can add a small amount of hoisin sauce with the soy sauce and water for a little more flavor but it’s not necessary.  Thanks for a great, healthy recipe!

This tasted fantastic. I changed up the vegetables a bit to match what I had, since I had bell peppers and not snow peas. But this is definitely a make-again recipe; the sauce is very rich and yummy.

I was looking for a good stir fry sauce and I found it here. Thank you for sharing.  I did not add the extra salt because I felt it was not needed with the soy sauce.

This tasted like it came out of a restaurant. I made no changes. My husband, and four childeren (20, 17, 14, 9) kids really enjoyed it.

This recipe was quick and easy, and it is highly adaptable to whatever veggies are in season or what you have on-hand.  They only way I strayed was to add more veggies than what the recipe calls for--both in volume and variety.  There was plenty of sauce to accommodate the additional veggies.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks for sharing!

This was really good. I used completely different vegetables because that's what I had - mushrooms, asparagus, carrots, celery and onion.. but the sauce came out great. I have to eat super healthy, so I substituted grape seed oil for the vegetable oil.. I also found a great substitute for corn starch, if anyone is looking for one. I used ground up flaxseed it works well and is super healthy. Thanks for the recipe, quick easy and very good. Will use again for various stir frys.

Added red pepper with the onion.  Doubled the garlic.  Served on soba noodles (found in the Asian section) as suggested by another reviewer.  Added less salt than recipe suggests...just eyeballed it.  Made this for my vegan son and his fiancé but look forward to adding something that vegans would avoid and making it for my carnivorous husband in the near future.  ??

Since I'm on a low carb diet this turned out perfect. I added thin steak strips, tofu, edamame, can of mushrooms and cut baby corn. Of course with more ingredients I added twice the amount of ginger and I didn't add the salt. It was perfectly seasoned that I didn't need to eat it with rice and I could still taste the flavor of the vegetables.

This recipe was a good start. I loved the ginger flavor, however I had to add sesame oil and some additional flavoring as other reviewers stated. Omitted the string beans and added bell pepper and tofu. Overall it was very refreshing and healthy tasting. Will make again.

I used this recipe yesterday and again today, but modified it A LOT.  Using the cornstarch created a jelly substance (as others mentioned) so the next time I omitted the cornstarch.  I do agree that you can use which ever veggies you prefer, but I cooked the carrots in olive oil first, then as time permitted and the vegetables looked almost ready I added mushrooms, then green beans, then broccoli.  I added garlic, fish sauce, and soy sauce towards the end and then added the fresh shaved ginger and sprinkled it with chili pepper flakes. Instead of water I used vegetable broth. I will definitely make it again.

i used this as a starting point for dinner.. i felt there was room for improvement but bf said it's called seasoning to taste.. i added more garlic and ginger.. used the veggies we had in the fridge (broccoli, green bell pepper, carrots, onion, and mushrooms).. i also added some leftover chopped up boston butt to make it heartier.. and sprinkled some sesame seed oil and extra soy sauce because of it.. i'm not a huge fan of adding corn starch to my asian dishes so i just left it out.. it didn't need the extra salt.. ty for the recipe

I'm rating the sauce, since I used a bag of frozen stir-fry veggies and tossed in shrimp too. The sauce is a really good base to adjust to your own taste. I cut the ginger in half since I only had powdered ginger; I'd like to try it again with ginger root. I also left out the salt b/c soy sauce adds enough salt for me. I added a couple drops of sesame oil too. It was a really pleasant, mild sauce, which I'll definitely use again and tweak in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe really did it for me. I didn't add the adtl salt at the end and used a bit more water for more sauce. It was fantastic. I agree with many other reviewers that a multitude of vegetables can be used, and I substituted snow peas with fresh pumpkin slices. Was oh so good! Thank you!!!

Yes, I tried this recipe and enjoyed it. I mixed in a few other veggies like red cabbage, celery and even some zucchini from my garden. I felt it didn't need that much salt since it had 2 tbsp of soy sauce, so I cut the salt amount in half. Thanks!

Easy to cook...try adding baby corn to the mix. Also, I added tofu, which is a harder to cook, but gentle stirring will help it to not break up into pieces.

Loved this! Made it exactly as the recipe called for, the only change was they types of vegetables.  I used broccoli, carrots, snap peas, onions, and mushrooms. It was amazing and even my nephew that is incredible picky came back for seconds. I had to make a second batch of veggies!  Thanks for the staple recipe that I'm adding to my recipe box!

Excellent flavor. Added cooked chicken at the end after taking out a portion for my vegan son. Only issue is the amount of salt called for. Way too much. Probably just a pinch would do it!

Versatile, use any veggies you have on hand.  Very good flavor & crunch, under-cook since keeps cooking as it sits.

I cut the oil down to 2 T, used chicken broth for the other 2 T.  Next time I'll try NO oil & 1/4 c. chicken broth to make a fat free dish.  Also, did not add the salt.  Used this as a side dish with chicken. Very Yummy :)

This is an easy and highly nutritious recipe for vegetable lovers. I did several things differently from the posted recipe. I made a slurry by mixing the cornstarch with cold water. Additionally, I added garlic chili paste along with the soy sauce to warm things up a bit. This sauce was added at the end of the recipe. It was easier to simplify this by just adding all the veggies in at once and finishing with the sauce. A little more garlic was added and sesame oil was used instead of vegetable oil. Use sliced red pepper to create more colors. Add salt and black pepper to taste to finish off this easy stir fry recipe. Goes great on rice!

Ok I had just got a new wok and had some ginger in my fridge I needed to use up. Googled a recipe and I'm so glad I found this! I loved it because I had tons of green beans in my summer garden. What's weird is that I had no onions in my fridge but I did have mushrooms so I put those in instead. Turned out very tasty. I will make again!

I added some baked tofu to this and increased the amount of soy sauce.  The ginger was really refreshing and I did follow one other reviewer's idea to add pineapple chunks.  That bit of sweetness was a great addition.  I served this over fragrant Jasmine rice.  Yummy!

Thank you for this recipe! It was super simple and took less than 20 minutes to whip up.  I made it for my mom who is not vegan and she loved it!.  You can add more soy sauce to your cooked meal to taste.  I'm making it tonight and substituting rice for rice noodles :)

This was Fantastic! My family is not very fond of vegetables and normally my stir fries in the past have wound up with just the meats pulled out. This recipe however was such a wonderful blend of Asian flavors fried right onto the vegetables that we devoured it!

Good recipe. Our market didn't have fresh snow peas, so I used regular peas. The results were fantastic. Thank you for posting.

This was pretty good and I'll definitely make it again. I used a different combination of vegetables - no snow peas, added zucchini and mushrooms - and served over a mixture of brown and white rice. My whole family really liked it (and they're not known for being big fans of vegetables). I think next time, I'd substitute olive oil for the vegetable oil. The vegetable oil was a little heavier than I'd like for the vegetables. I'd also cook the green beans for a couple of minutes before I added the other vegetables.

Made almost exactly as written.  Didn't have green beans, so threw in diced celery, red pepper and green onions.  Mushrooms would also work very well in this.  Nice light flavor.  Will make again.

I added some leftover sauteed mushrooms, some thinly sliced sauteed chicken breast, and some sliced summer squash to this and served it over rice.  It was delicious- will definately make again!  This may be personal preference, but I reduced the salt to 1 teaspoon, and may reduce it further to 1/2 teaspoon next time as it was still plenty salty for me.

There was NO flavor to this at all. We tried to save it by adding some other seasoning, but didn't do anything either. Nice thought having a veggie stir-fry, but I'll make my own sauce next time.

Pretty good.  The vegetable combination was excellent and I found the recipe worked well as written.  I thought it was a little bland, but I certainly could adjust the recipe next time to account for this.  My husband liked it better than I did.  Nice and quick!  We served it with rice and some frozen potstickers.  This won't make it to our regular rotation, but I won't rule out making it again.

VERY good. A little too salty for my taste though. I hesitated when I saw the table salt in the ingredients list since soy sauce adds enough sodium on it's own. I went ahead with it, but next time I will leave it out, other than that, it was perfect. I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables and two tablespoons of oil instead of four. We'll be making this again since my kids liked it and it was so tasty, quick and easy.

I made this last night using the fresh vegetables I had on hand (broccoli, cauliflower, green beans, carrots, green bell pepper, zucchini, mushrooms, and green onion). I didn't add the 1/2 tbsp salt because the soy sauce I had wasn't the reduced sodium kind and I'm glad I didn't! It was perfect - adding the extra salt would have probably made it too salty.   In a skillet, the veggies cooked in a little oil. While cooking, I mixed up the sauce (cornstarch, garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and water) and then added it to the veggies as they were finishing up cooking. I also made cooked up some chicken with the sauce in a different pan for my husband. Served with rice. Very good!

I liked this standard stir-fry.  I did double the garlic and ginger as many reviewers said it was too bland.  With those doubled, the flavor was perfect.  I also added the cornstarch to the water/soy sauce mixture because that made more sense.  I doubled that mixture because I like a little sauce for my rice.  Four stars because of those changes. Yum!

So yummy!  I love the fresh ginger flavor.  I did not have broccoli, so I compensated with mushrooms, red peppers, and purple cabbage.  I'm sure it would be wonderful with broccoli, too.  I cut down on the oil and sprinkled on some sesame seeds.  I will definitely make this again.

Awesome! Sauce was perfect! I chucked a ton of extra fresh ginger in the oil before adding the rest of the veggies, and once everything else was cooking in the wok, I added a dash of cinnamon, crushed red pepper, a few handfuls of cashews, and half a tin of pineapple tidbits.

Added a dash of red pepper flakes and some unsalted roasted peanuts for added protein.

Lovely with plain basmati or jasmine rice. A great vegetarian dish, or would be nice with chicken. I used sesame oil to give it a nice touch.

Yum!  I simplified things a bit and stir fried all the veggies at once.  I did not add water or the extra ginger at the end.  I used 1 tbsp veg oil and 1 tbsp sesame oil, and a different variety of vegetables.  We loved it!

YUM!  MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVED THIS.  I AM A VEGETARIAN SO I ATE MINE WITH TOFU.  THE REST OF MY FAMILY HAD IT WITH CHICKEN.  I USED SESAME OIL INSTEAD OF VEGETABLE OIL.  I ALSO USED SOME RICE WINE VINEGAR THE SECOND TIME I MADE IT.  EITHER WAY, IT'S DEELISH!!

If I could figure out how to cook the vegies first before I stir fry them I would have enjoyed this more. The vegies were way too crunchy for our taste.

I love this recipe, however; I use 3 tbsps of cornstarch, and I add chicken broth (1 can). I also use Aloha Shoyu. It's not as strong as the typical soy sauce. This combined with the other ingredients makes an excellent sauce for your stir-fry.

I made this sans cornstarch and using frozen stir-fry vegetables (though I'm sure fresh would be better). The sauce had a great, fresh flavor. I added chicken sauteed with crushed red pepper as well as the sauce. I served the chicken and veggies in wraps with lettuce and tortillas. If I made it with rice I would use the cornstarch for a thicker sauce, but it was just right and tasted great in a wrap.

This was pretty good!  I did add a couple of pinches of Splenda to give it a bit more flavor, and I did not add the salt, as I felt the Soy Sauce made it salty enough.  I threw in some thinly sliced celery and fresh mushrooms.  I'll use this again.

This was pretty good and easy too.  The sauce was a bit strong, so I might add a little more water and maybe a little sugar to the sauce next time.  Would be a complete meal with some thin beef mixed in.

Simple, tasty and healthy. Used only broccoli. As another reviwer suggested sauted garlic & ginger. Added the broccoli. Then added soya sauce, a little white wine and bullion powder. Finally cornflour mixed in water.

Very good basic recipe.  I usually add mushrooms and red pepper, and leave out the carrots just because of personal preference.  My mom and I have made this stir-fry many times, and each time it turned out exellent!

I really like this simple recipe! My Fam liked it as well - we had it two nights in a row. Natrually, I doctored it up to our taste. I added more garlic and ginger. I did not have any soy sauce on hand (the only time ever!!!) so I used Braggs Liquid Amino Soy Seasoning. YUM! Oh yah! I love the corn starch idea! A Keeper!!!

This was delicious and so easy. The ginger flavor with the soy sauce was great and even a little mild even though I used more than the recipe called for. I used snow peas, carrots, broccoli and red pepper that I added a little after everything else so it wouldn't be overdone. I covered it for a few minutes to let everything steam once it was all in since my boyfriend prefers his veggies a little more well done. Will make again, great base recipe that can be made with whatever you've got.

This was pretty good, the second time I used the recipe I marinated chicken in soy, honey, garlic, and fresh ginger and made a chicken veggie stir-fry. Don't add too much honey or it will be too sweet. I will continue to experiment with this recipe, maybe some squash and zuccini.

Immensely, excruciatingly bland, and a little gummy thanks to the corn starch.  I can use my imagination to make a stir fry juicer and more flavorful than this just by tossing in a bigger variety of veggies and more inventive sauces.

Used frozen vegetables except for the green beans where I used canned. Added red pepper flakes & garlic salt. Served along with Pork Tenderloin & Egg Fried Rice (both from this site) along with an Asian-inspired fruit salad that included bananas, apples, mango,  oranges, strawberries, topped with almonds.

This was a great recipe except I thought the ginger was a little overpowering.  I am not used to fresh ginger however.  I will definitely make again though.

SO GOOD!  i've been looking for the perfect stir-fry!  I used less oil, extra water and just used both powdered ginger and garlic and it still tasted great!  I also added the soy mixture to the veggies and chicken when they were ready, no 'coating' step. I can't wait to try different variations!  :)

Very good stir fry recipe.  I made it with frozen stir fry vegetables and added more soy sauce and water than the recipe called for so I could have more of a sauce.  I also added sesame seeds and extra garlic.  Delicious.

My husband (not a big veggie fan)was helping me cook dinner so he did all the prep work.  He wasn't sure he was going to like the dish but he ate most of it before we even got to the dinner table.  Kudos on a GREAT recipe for vegetable lovers and new converts.

I like this recipe but i like to have more liquid in my stir-fry so that when you serve it over rice it doesn't taste so dry. Will have to play around with it a little but definitely worth a try.

A good basic stir fry recipe; I use the bag of frozen stir fry veggies to cut down on prep time.

Super! Took a little time to get all the ingredients assembled, cut up, etc (I hate the prep work!), but well worth it.
Thanks for a good recipe!

Simple to make, and used what vegetables I had. Added a little extra water to give some carrots extra steam time in the second stage of cooking. Easy to remember procedure after making once or twice.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe!!  My entire family (husband, 15 year old and 13 year old) enjoyed!!  (I didn't have soy sauce, so I used coconut aminos.  I also added water chestnuts, baby corn, and bamboo shoots.)  My 15 year old asked that I make it again!

I cooked chicken breasts and just threw in a bag of frozen Chinese veggies, crushed garlic, planed ginger, ginger-infused oil, and soy sauce. The flavors were excellent, but I need to make sauce for it. The chicken, veggies, and noodles were dry.

This is a great dish. Like most folks, I changed it up a bit. I began with my flavor base. I used avocado oil and a small amount of toasted sesame oil. Once that's heated, I added the chopped onions. As soon as they were translucent, I added liquid aminos (FAR LESS sodium than soy sauce), ginger and garlic. Once that was ready, I added my vegetables and shortly thereafter, some vegetable broth. The outcome was fantastic. Very aromatic and flavorful!

I had to use 1 tbls. ground ginger because I was out of fresh. 
I omitted the corn starch and mixed low sodium soysauce, 1 tsp Olive Oil (instead of vegetable oil) with garlic, ginger, and water.  I wisked it together to disolve ground ginger.   I also used about 1 1/2 tbls olive oil in skillet. I added more veggies. Baby bello and white mushrooms, yellow squash, green and yellow bell peppers along with those in the recipe. When veggies were cooked, I poured soysauce mixture over them and stirred til done.  Sooooo gooood!!!!

Made it as called for in the Recipe.  Used some different veggies I had on hand other wise followed the recipe.  It was very good and added an interesting crunch to the veggies from the cornstarch.

I substituted half sesame oil as did many other reviewers, which added greatly to the flavored. Next time I'll double the ginger and garlic. I did like the corn starch and ginger idea, which I hadn't tried before. This recipe lends itself well to cleaning out the frig of extra veggies.

This is an excellent recipe even when switching up the veggies! I used zuchhinni, grape tomatoes, mushrooms, asparagus, snow pea pods, red & yellow peppers, onion and carrots. I also used Trader Joe's organic coconut aminos in place of the soy sauce. Yummy!

I like to use fish sauce instead of salt and add a little garlic chili sauce after it's finished cooking to give just a touch of heat.

Beautiful dish, but was very bland when following the recipe. Next time we'll add more ginger, garlic and salt, add pepper and some cayenne. Also we omitted green beans and used red bell pepper.

Use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil for an amazing flavor! I’ve made this numerous times for my family because I am a vegan (cholesterol management) this is a vegan meal EVERYONE loves.... Even the meat eaters... if your short on time, cook your frozen veggies 1/3 of the recommended microwave time... then finish them as directed in the instructions. I use the Asian blend of frozen veggies but any veggies are amazing in this recipe.

Substituted green beans for snow peas and used all frozen veggies (stir fried for about 8 minutes), but otherwise pretty much left the same except I left out the salt. Easy and good, will try doubling and adding a bit of chicken next time.

This is fairly a very good receipe. I have made my own version which is very simple. I used brocolli, carrot, chilli flakes, garlic and lime juice. Pour coconut oil on a pan. Add in the garlic and chilli flakes fry it till the garlic turns light brown keep a watch as it might get burnt later toss in the brocolli and carrots add salt to taste. Stri fry the veggies for 5 minutes you don’t want the brocolli getting over cooked. Remove the veggies and add lime. Hmmm yum

Very tasty. I tweaked it a bit for my taste - added cooking sherry, a little sugar and dried red pepper flakes to the cornstarch mix.  Increased the cornstarch. Used frozen green beans. Added the onions with the rest of the veggies. I didn't have snow peas but they would have been a nice addition.  Any mixture of stir-fryable veggies would work. Reduced the salt. Served with rice. Thanks for the recipe.

I made this for my husband and me one night when I didn’t know quite what to make.  We both thought it was missing something.  I added chicken and a few other vegetables but in the future we will add garlic chili sauce to give it some spice.  Otherwise it’s very good!

When they say "keep stirring so the vegetables don't stick" they mean it.  You have to stir the entire time.

Delicious, so easy and it has the beautiful flavors of an intricate stir-fry without much work.  I added all the vegetables, including the onion, at the same time and added all the ginger in the beginning.  I used vegetables on hand, squash and broccoli. Celery would have been great in this too. I chopped up a jalapeno, including seeds and veins, for some heat.  I  doubled the ginger.  This is a keeper, thanks for a tasty and easy recipe.

Perfect!  My family loved this recipe.  I used a little less ginger and only had broccoli, carrots, and vidalia onions on hand so that’s what I used.  Delicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe !!!

This was a simple meal to make and pleased my fussy-eater mother. Not too spicy for her taste, but flavorful enough the two brothers also enjoyed it. Our Vegan liked it very much!  I used red onion, but didn't change the recipe.

It was ok. My test is whether I want seconds or want to eat it the next day. I dint want seconds nor did I want it the next day. 
It was fast and easy but not exciting. I probably would not make it again.

I used home grown snow peas, and sugar snap peas, plus mushrooms. Very good, but I think I use less soy sauce.

The recipe by itself would have been very bland, with the best part being ginger. I added 6 cloves garlic and about 3 tablespoons ginger and tripled the recipe. I also did not add the salt required (or as others have said it would be way too salty!). Instead I added about a half tsp red chili flakes for slight kick and about 2 tbsps palm sugar.  I also used sesame oil rather than vegetable oil? I also added shrimp. With these changes it became the best stir fry I've ever made and I'll definitely make it again.

I did not use the corn starch at all.  Added some rice vineagar and sesame oil.  Broccoli, bell peppers, onions, garlic all sautéed then dumped in the sauce and sprinkled peanuts at the end.

This has great flavor, and is so much fresher than takeout Chinese.  We did add gyoza/dumpling sauce and more garlic to kick up the flavor during cooking. Not more than 2 tbsp of gyoza or soy sauce, I'd say. If you have kids, you can mix maybe 1 tbsp of brown sugar to the soy sauce and add it at the end, and it adds a bit more of that sweetness kids like from carryout Chinese food.
To clarify the cooking time with the water -- If your'e using especially crunchy veggies like snap peas, green beans, or broccoli, you'll want to steam/boil those a bit longer than what seems apparent in the recipe. The cooking time is otherwise very quick -- that is the nature of stir fry -- so be ready to eat when you start cooking!

Overall, it's a nice tasting recipe. The only thing I found was it was a bit salty, going to cut the salt in half the next time I make it. It is easy to make.

the only variation was i used frozen stir fry veggie mix. poured hot water on them to soften and declump prior to mixing with the sauce. and I used less soy sauce and a little more water because I wasn't going to have a side of rice or noodles. this recipe was excellent

Excellent!  I will make it again for sure.
My changes:  I added a dash of liquid smoke and lime juice to the soy sauce/garlic/ginger/cornstarch mixture which I added to the vegetables at the end.  I also added a few pepperflakes when cooking the onion.

This recipe is absolutely delicious. The first time I made it I was in a hurry, so made no changes except to add tofu. My husband loved it so much he wanted me to make it for guests, who also loved it. Great as is. I highly recommend this one.

Really surprised how much we enjoyed this.  Light refreshing flavor.  I added a little cooked turkey chunks to the veggies, but it did not need this.  The final step of adding some minced ginger really added to the dish.  Not only will I make it again, my wife will insist I make it again.

The 1/2 tablespoon of salt made the recipe WAY TOO SALTY!  Suspect it should have read 1/2 teaspoon salt or 1/2 tablespoon  sugar.

I cut the amount of oil in half and substituted a 1/2 sesame oil 1/2 olive oil blend. I cut the amount of fresh ginger in half (a personal taste), I also added 1Tbsp fish sauce and a sprinkle of ground red pepper.

I followed the instructions exactly and I'm sorry to say it was terrible.  Gummy and flavourless.  I had to add more soy and water and even tried adding sesame oil but nothing helped.  It was a guey mess.  Maybe using water in place of oil would help?  I won't try again, sorry this was not for me at all.

I found the Ginger Veggie Stir-Fry recipe to be a nice change  of pace when it comes to stir-fry recipes. I fix the recipe according to the instructions and my wife and I enjoyed the dish immensely . I cook a lot of stir-fry and after awhile one tastes like another but this recipe stood out. Thank you!

I didn't have mushrooms, but the author is right - you can throw in anything you have around the house. I put in sweet corn off the cob. It didn't state # of servings, and I would have made more.

This dish was absolutely delicious and so easy to make. I did alter the recipe a bit with my choice of vegetables,instead of soy sauce, I used Braggs Aminos, I sliced my onions and cooked them with the veggies, added a small piece of jalapeño, and sea salt to taste. I doubled my measurements because of the volume of veggies I had. Once I had followed measured ingredients I added additional seasoning if needed by taste.  My choice of veggies. red and green peppers, onions, broccoli florets, carrots, celery, and string beans.

Change the vegetable oil to raw organic cold-pressed coconut oil and use organic coconut flour or almond flour in place of cornstarch. Then you'll have a healthy plate of veggies. All corn today is grown with GMO seeds and is poison for your body. Vegetable oil is not from vegetables. It's made from grains, seeds or beans all of which I'm sure have a GMO beginning because GMO has huge profits associated with it. Plus the extraction process uses a poisonous solvent called hexane. Manufacturers care about profits, not your health. That's up to you. Yes it's cheap if you want heart disease.

I did add soy/cornstarch at end to flavor and thicken. Since I love Bok Choy, I added it along with sirloin, pre cooked and left over steamed dumplings. Oh, last addition sesame oil to flavor. Fantastic! Noriganial recipe was great, just added my personal preferences.

Overall, very good for a vegetarian stir fry. Easy to change up veggies and think next time I'll add in some bok choy too. Felt it had a little too much ginger, but that's a personal taste preference. Used sesame oil. Didn't add additional salt, but did add a little more Tamari soy sauce. Will make again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

This was a BIG HIT!!!! Instead of vegetables I used steak and instead of soy sauce, I used steak sauce and instead of ginger I used liquid smoke and instead of cornstarch I used dry rub! I added salt, pepper and a little bit of red pepper flakes for some KICK!!!!!! So yummy!!!!!!

My vegan son LOVES stir fried veggies. I added a little extra ginger, cabbage, mushrooms and tofu. Sprinkled with sesame seeds to finish and served over brown rice. It was AWESOME. Thank you for the inspiration.

I changed the recipe to four portions, but it ended up being just enough for two. I didn't enjoy making it, because all the carrots clumped together into a big lump as soon as i added the soy sauce and water, and i couldn't separate it. The flavor was good, though.

5 stars for the idea, first batch I made as-is, the second batch I changed a little and it seemed to help:

1. I used more of the cornstarch and oil mixture, it gave it a nice sort of breading to the dish that I like

2. I used double the garlic

3. I could barely taste the ginger in the recipe, so I used almost *a cup* of fresh grated ginger, the resulting flavor was very strong but very interesting. If you're not a ginger fan about half a cup should do.

4. I would recommend replacing the beans with more broccoli, broccoli is great in this dish but the beans turned out kind of waxy.

5. I added tofu, *cook them by themselves or they get soggy!* Take about four 1 inch x 1 inch  x 2 inch squares of tofu, and brown them in oil until they are a little past golden brown. If I did it again I'd add spices while I was browning but I'm not sure what to suggest, red pepper  flakes and soy sauce possibly?

6. I used double the onions, and added about a teaspoon of red chillies from a local thai restaurant to kick it up to what a restaurant would call "medium", crushed red pepper should work too.

I would definitely make this again, even though it's a lot of work to cut up all the veggies (I think it took me more than 25 minutes of prep time).

What I would recommend is  that you make this a couple of days in a row, have somebody help you chop veggies , and chop more than you need for one batch.

For the second batch it's really quick and easy, just put the ingredients in the pan and c

Turned out pretty good with a few changes....I added chicken, which I marinated in the garlic, ginger, soy sauce & some sesame oil and I replaced the  beans with yellow & orange pepper strips.  I found there wasn't much in the way of a sauce with this (which is a must for hubby!) so I added about a 1/4 cup of orange juice after the water & cornstarch.  Hubby raved about it & wants it added to our regular meal plan....me, its good but not over the top.

I went a little heavier on the ginger.
Instead of using cornstarch, I used Rice Flour (comes with or without gluten).  Rice flour is very cheap ($2)
I cook with very little oil.  I used just under 1 tablespoon of peanut oil.
Both thickening agent and oil changes makes the dish taste more authentic to me.
I give it a four because the ingredients were interesting and the cooking method.  A great recipe to "tweak" for you. :)

This was absolutely delicious!  The only variations from the recipe were the use of brown rice and sea salt instead of regular table salt.  I found that the sea salt made the dish an ever so slight touch salty.  It was great for just me, but if I were to make this recipe for others, I would likely use 1/4 TBS of salt instead of 1/2 TBS since I cook with sea salt.  This dish is going to be a staple in my home!

Kept to the recipe but subbed baby portobello mushrooms in place of the green beans and reduced the oil to 1.5 tbs. I also used Tamari soy sauce over regular.  It wasn't terrible, but I didn't think it was anything I would make again. Not a lot of flavor. Others mention adding fish sauce or sesame oil, or pepper flakes maybe that would've helped. Also, being a stir fry newbie, my snap peas were quite under and my onions (though added very last) were mushy. Mleh. Next time I'd just buy a bottle of "stir fry sauce" instead of attempting to make my own. Esp if I went out of my way to get all these veggies in the first place.

This recipe was delicious, although I made some minor alterations. I am on the Eat to Live 6 week plan so I doubled the sauce to account for extra veggies, water sauteed the veggies, and replaced the oil with water. We also sliced portabella mushrooms, bell pepper, broccoli, onion, and snap peas for our veggies. I ate the veggie version and added shrimp to the other half for my husband and kids. we served the stir fry over brown rice and quinoa.

Really good. I've made this several times now. I use 5 cups of whatever veggies I have on hand. Usually I stir fry some shrimp to go with it and that makes a complete meal for our fam. Oh, and we like a tad more garlic and ginger than it states and less soy sauce.

This was very quick and very easy to make. I wish that it would have had more of a sauce as I found it to be rather sticky and not saucy. I will certainly make this again, but will add some red pepper flakes and a little more garlic and ginger next time. I didn't add the salt that this calls for but it really didn't seem to be missing.

This recipe was ok, however I will try it again minus the extra salt at the end. It was very overpowering.

I made this the other day and we enjoyed it so much that I'm making it again today.  I used fresh broccoli, peppers, onions, zucchini, carrots, mushrooms, and sugar snap peas.  Per other comments, I added a bit of fish sauce and chili paste to the sauce.  I mixed all the sauce ingredients together and stir-fried the veggies.  When they were done, I added the sauce, mixing it to thicken and coat the veggies.  Very easy and very yummy.

The sauce is great on this recipe. Added all ingredients except the green beans. Added mushrooms, bell pepper,and jalapeno pepper to recipe. Added more cornstarch and sesame oil along with a lime for sauce. The sauce was delicious. Had to add more water to the wok along with soy sauce which created a thicker sauce. Added marinated sliced beef for a delicious meal served over rice. Would recommend for sauce and vegetables that are healthy.

Eh. This was okay. I didn't really look at the vegetables suggested since I had just gone to the store. I did take the portions and other ingredients to mind, though. I used eggplant, zucchini, red bell pepper, mushroom, carrots, and peas. I felt like the ginger was lost in the recipe. I definitely ate two portions of it that night, but I feel I wasn't completely overthrown. Overall, it was alright.

Thank you for this great, time-saving recipe!  This is a keeper because it's easy, quick and has potential for adding flavor varieties like black bean sauce, hoisin sauce, teriyaki, etc.  We always have celery, onion, carrots and some kind of peppers on hand so this stir fry ends up being a nice accompaniment.  I would like to add some kind of "somethin" to pizzazz it and make it addictive (sugar, more garlic, Siracha?).  It's colorful and the sauce makes a nice, attractive gloss to the dish. Thanks!!!

I thought this was pretty good, I made as instructed but then added more ginger and just a tad more soy sauce because it was a little bland. I also thought it was a little gummy so next time (and there will be a next time) I will mix everything in a bowl and then add it to the veggies in one step.

My coworkers keep giving me grief for how good my leftovers smell at lunch! This is an easy and yummy recipe. Of course, I did change a few things too - I used coconut oil (which contributes to the delicious smell!) and a few different veggies I had on hand. I did start with the corn starch/coconut oil/ginger/garlic, then added brocoli, carrots, and a red pepper. I also added some red cabbage right at the end, so it didn't get too cooked. And a little tofu for extra umph. Delish!

This was yummy---I've never made a stir-fry this way before but it was very good, and truth be told, more successful than my previous attempts!  I cleaned out the fridge for this one:  broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, snow peas, green pepper, and added two microwaved Quorn Naked Chik'n fillets.  Used garlic and ginger pastes from the local Indian grocery and low sodium soy sauce.  I'm doing Weight Watchers, and this added up to 4 points plus extra points for some rice.  Thanks!!!

I also added sliced mushrooms. But it was too salty, so next time I will add no salt (the soy sauce already have enough salt in it). Children loved it.

Fantastic recipe. Also easy to ad lib on the veggies. I use whatever I have on hand but stick to the basic basting and sauteeing ingredients. Have also added tofu which worked really well.  I sautéed it first, took it out, and then added back in at the end. YUM!

Made this last night and it was awesome! I did double the cornstarch, garlic and ginger root. Also added 1/2tsp of Brown Sugar before taking it out of the pan, and added a Sesame Seeds. It was great and made a perfect lunch the next day.

The sauce was great! As others suggested, I added the cornstarch with the soy sauce and water. I skipped the green beans, but added water chestnuts and baby corn. I also added crushed red pepper for some spice, chicken, and egg noodles (cooked ahead of time). I highly recommend using a large wok for this recipe.

SO GOOD!  I grew up in an Asian kitchen and this reminds me of home.  My husband actually (who isn't very crazy about ginger) loved this dish, too.  I threw in some fully cooked shrimp, which didn't prolong the cook time one bit.  Quick and easy to make!

This is a great recipe.  Only had dried ginger, but no biggie.  Also I took the advice of other reviewers and stirred the cornstarch in with the water and soya and then added this to the veggies.  The sauce had the perfect consistency and I will now use this recipe from now on.  My kids LOVED it--of course they didn't realized they were eating all those veggies!

I used half the oil and my own fave veggies (sugar snap peas, broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, spinach). Almost any veggies on hand will work. For me and my hubby, this is 2 servings, so I had to cut back on the oil. Very easy, delicious, and filling too! Did not add any extra salt, and used reduced sodium soy sauce. Added fresh ground pepper. Hubby added lots more soy sauce to his, as he does with any dish like this. To cut the oil I used the 2 tbsp soy sauce instead of oil to mix with the cornstarch, and it worked well. Then I added just the water at the end. I might add some chili sauce with shrimp or tofu next time, but SO good!

added chicken to this since my boyfriend and dad can't stand a non-meat dinner dish.  when cooking the strips of chicken i added a couple thin slices of fresh ginger and some soy sauce.. then set that aside and did the recipe as stated.  first time i did it exactly as stated and i wasn't crazy about the green beans in the mix.  did this a few nights ago and doubled the veggies but omitted the green beans--replaced it with strips of red pepper and served it over a bed of rice. sooooooo good!

This was very good, but I actually felt like for me, this was a little too much ginger- and I like ginger. However, it was quick, easy, and inexpensive and you could add or take out any of the veggies and add meat if you wanted. Thanks for sharing!

This was a very delicious stir fry! I made it to accompany the Sesame Beef Bites from this site, and it was the perfect side dish. To give it a more "Oriental" flavor, I used peanut oil instead of vegetable oil. I didn't have any snow peas, so I used some extra green beans instead. I look forward to trying this again with different vegetables...yum! Oh, I also didn't have fresh ginger, so I used 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger...next time, I would probably use a little more. Thanks for sharing...this one is a keeper!

Yummy recipe with lots of room for improvisation.  I only used half the oil and as others have done added the cornstarch w/ the soy sauce.  I also added a bit of rice wine at the end of cooking to deglaze the pan a bit.  Very simple and tasty.

i looked for the side dish, to accompany with Mabo-Tofu tonight. I had only broccoli & carrots but it turned out good. I didn't add the ginger at the last step, though. And i probably won't add oil to stir fry the marinated vegis cuz the dish turned out to be a bit oily. The marinade sauce already has oil in it, i think it will be enough oil for me. Overall, it was simple as a side dish, and tasted good.

Good flavors, I enjoyed the ginger!  If I made it again, I think I would add the cornstarch to the soy sauce and water, and skip the step that dirties up a large bowl. Also, to get a filling meal, I had to eat 1/2 this recipe... so consider that if you are looking at the nutrition information.

A nice recipe, recommended. I also added some green pepper and celery. A hit with the kids, but they suggested adding meat would make it even better. Will make again, trying out the above suggestion. Will also add some water chestnuts.

This was good, if you use seaseme oil instead of vegetable, it adds even more flavor, and even a little healthier. But still a good recipe.

I was disappointed with the flavor of this dish.  I used broccoli, mushrooms, water chestnuts, green onions, bean sprouts and carrots for my veggie mix.  I even used more garlic and ginger root than recommended and used 1/4 sesame oil rather than all vegetable oil. It was okay, but that's it.  Next time, I'll try some new flavors.

Yum, easy, versatile and delicious.  I didn't add the extra salt at the end through.

Very good stir fry recipe!  I made as directed, except instead of snow peas and green beans (which I love, but didn't have on hand) I used some green peppers and finely chopped celery - and it still turned out nice.  I think I would make a little bit more sauce, next time, to help keep the rice moist.

Absolutely delicious!  I brought it to a pot luck and my friends went nuts over it.  I used broccoli, sugar snap peas, and julienned carrots.  LOVE the ginger flavor! I really like that the veggies get tender without becoming mushy.

Simple recipe, but packs a lot of taste! We only had baby carrots and broccoli on hand, but this was still delicious.

Very tasty and easy!  The only mistake I made was using boring, plain, white rice!  Should have taken the suggestion and used the jasmine rice!
