AWESOME! Recently, someone sent me gourmet popcorn from Dale & Thomas (on Oprah's list of fav things) and I was addicted to the cinnamon creme drizzle popcorn! I have just reproduced it (with some variation but just as good and sooooo much cheaper) - melted some white chocolate in the same microwave safe bowl that I used to melt my cinnamon sugar butter mixture so the residue of that was left over.  Added a touch of vanilla (to taste) and then drizzled on my baked popcorn.  Absolutely delish.

If you LOVE cinnamon you want to try this!  Very tasty!  I scaled the recipe back to 4 servings.  In this case (and I suspect with 16 servings) you may want to make *double* the caramel sauce if you want *every* piece of popcorn covered.  I did not use microwave popcorn.  I feel a premium popcorn may help this to have the best quality all around. My popped corn seem to get smaller after putting on the caramel and baking in the oven.  Don't over bake in the oven, mine took less time than the recipe stated.

Very yummy. I think it is even better the next day. I also drizzled about 1/2 c melted white chocolate chips on the batch and that added a whole new dimension to it. Just like an expensive gourmet popcorn without the expense! Makes a great gift.

I absolutely love cinnamon popcorn and my Mom used to always make it.  I used 1/2 has much butter though and baked it for 20 minutes at 200 degrees.  I also sprinkled just a little bit more cinnamon over it before it went in the oven. It is so YUMMY and we ate it all in one night. Popcorn is my favorite snack.  Thanks for submitting this one.

Absolutely delicious!  Make sure you let it cool for long enough so that it gets nice and crunchy.  Even better if you drizzle melted chocolate or white chocolate over it.

I loved it. It's lightly sweetened and very addicting. Perfect if you're looking for a crunchy corn that satisfies the sweet tooth without all the heavy caloric coating!

I made this recipe exactly as written for a BBQ, and I was quite pleased with the results.  I do not like Kettle Corn, and this does not taste like it; rather, it is a surprisingly sweet, light treat.  Two things I did: 1) I put the fresh-popped popcorn in a small, unused garbage bag and then added the butter/cinnamon/sugar mixture, sealing the bag and shaking to coat.  Ensuring that the popcorn coats evenly is vital to this recipe's success, and this method worked quite well.  (Plus I just threw away the bag, so clean up was easy.)  2) About half-way through baking, I took the pan out and mixed the corn again to ensure even crispness.  When the dish was finished, I had trouble keeping myself from eating it before the BBQ.  It's worth making a double batch if you're taking it to a get-together so you can keep some for yourself.

The sauce was delicious, and when poured over freshly popped popcorn and tossed, it was divine.  When backed for 10 minutes, however, it tasted as if it had been freeze-dried.  The sugar lost it's crystallization and many of the kernels acquired a stale texture.  If you are going to make this recipe, consider reducing the cooking time to just a few minutes or don't cook it at all; just pour over hot popcorn and enjoy.

My daughter likes this so much I make it for her class on her birthday.  I have to say DON'T make it with tub margarine, just too much water, yuck.  Make it with real butter or stick margarine.  Also, use more popcorn.  This seems to dilute the overly buttery sugary syrup a bit and still tastes yummy.

I made this to bring to a party. This was the easiest recipe ever! I used the microwave popcorn we had in the house (used 2 bags) and I also reduced the butter to 3/4 cup. I couldn't stop eating it as it came out of the oven. I had to make another batch to leave at home for the kids. 5 stars in my book.

This was a nice, simple treat for the family. Usually I make caramel popcorn, but it's 110 degrees outside and didn't want the oven on for an hour! I followed some of the other review suggestions and drizzled a little white chocolate over it after it cooled, . . awesome! I'll definately make this again!

This was great!  I've made it several times since I first tried it. Make sure to stir it halfway through and melt it the second time, so it pours well.

This is a great recipe.  It's like kettle corn with cinnamon added.  I am giving it out to my daughters teachers for Christmas and my husbands businesses that he works for.  I used  Daddy's Popcorn recipe for the popcorn and seasoned it with sea salt instead of seasoned salt.  I also didn't  bake it and it is amazing.

This recipe was a huge hit at my Girls Nite In! I used three bags of Simply Salted microwave popcorn and added 1/2 cup of melted white chocolate chips to it at after baking. As the nite wore on, the chocolate didn't get really firm and really did seem more like icing. We called it Cinnamon Roll Popcorn because that seemed more accurate!

Delicious!  I used one bag of Orville Reddenbacher's Simply Salted Popcorn, and then halved the rest of the ingredients to make a smaller quantity.  Everyone loves it!  Also good drizzled with some melted white chocolate!

This recipe was a lifesaver!  I needed something quick & easy to make in bulk to give to neighbors for Christmas.  My little addition to the recipe was to sprinkle chocolate chips over the pan of popcorn before popping it into the oven.  Delicious!

This was tasty.  I made this for game night with my friends.  Nothing but crumbs survived.  I ended up having to bake it for closer to half an hour to get it to stop being wet feeling.  Still really really tasty.  I loved it.

this was tasty and fun.  Next time I'll put the mixture over the popcorn in a bowl instead of on a pan to ensure the popcorn is a little more evenly covered.

This is a great recipe, I made it with my 9 year old nephew. I too overcooked the sugar portion of the recipe but it turned out none the less. I added vanilla to the sugar mixture after it was cooked. My house smells wonderful! I was going to take this to a party tomorrow night but I don't think there will be any left! Thanks for sharing!!!

I used a bag of microwave popcorn, butter spray and a cinnamon sugar mix. Came out brilliant!

really good, im not normally a huge fan of sweetened popcorn but this i devoured.  i was a tad confused about whether or not we were supposed to dissolve the sugar in the butter, so i just melted the butter then poured it over and hoped i did it right.  it didnt coat as well as i was hoping it would but that didnt stop it from tasting good anyways.  melted the butter on the stove, thats all i did different.  might try to dissolve the sugar next time so it coats more evenly.

This is sooooooo YUMMY and so easy to make.  I cut down the butter to 3/4 cup, and sprinkled a little cinnamon before baking and it was awesome.  My grandson, who is not real big on popcorn, couldn't get enough.  I'm going to try making it with Splenda for my diabetic husband, so he too can enjoy!

Crunchy, the right amount of sweetness, and super easy to make...I followed the recipe except I used half the amount of butter. I also sprinkled cinnamon on top before putting the popcorn in the oven. I'm definitely making this again.

So awesome! I cut the butter in half, because why would i put 2 sticks of butter in w/ one bag of popcorn! bUT STill used same measurements for cinnamon & sugar. Put in oven 20 min at 200 degrees. My friends ate it right up , they asked where i bought it from, not knowing i made it myself. They thought this popcorn would make a killing at the movie theaters!

Great snack recipe. I always have microwave popcorn lying around and the other ingredientsn are simple too. This hit the spot. I was craving something sweet and wow...YUM! The second time I made it I played around with the recipe for fun and added nuts. Also used vanilla sugar and brown sugar and a little fresh grated nutmeg. The recipe is perfect. I just like to cook and enjoy playing around. You can have fun and probably do all kinds of things with this one. Thanks so much for sharing it with me.

This is perfect! I live in Germany and can’t find corn syrup here, so I was glad to find this recipe. It’s easy to make and absolutely delicious. My family likes it much better than the caramel corn that takes so much longer. We can't buy salted butter here, so I added some salt to the butter mixture. I also added some vanilla and I think it helps a bit.

My son and I really enjoyed this popcorn. I would have never thought to put the popcorn in the oven after coating it in the cinnamon and sugar. I think this is what really made the popcorn delicious. Reminded me of the popcorn that you can get in those large cans. I loved it, thank you.

This was really easy to make and not too sweet.  The cinnamon wasn't overpowering, it is a tasty snack, perfect for cold winter nights of watching movies.

This is a delicious snack, and I've made it several times.  It's very quick and easy to put together.  My daughter's third grade class all wanted the recipe so their parents could make it, after I brought it in for a special occasion.  

I don't want to diddle with it, but a cup of butter is--wow!--too much for us.  Has anyone tried margarine?  or something else to help make the syrup without so much butter?  Maybe I just shouldn't make it so often.....

Wow - this was really good and so easy to make!  I used plain organic microwave popcorn (2 bags) and then coated it with the cinnamon sauce and baked it.  Will definitely make this again - it was a big hit!

EXCELLENT!   I was looking for a popcorn treat that didn't involve corn syrup, but I had no idea I would find something so easy and delicious.  Thank you for my new fav recipe!  Next time I think i will make more sauce though so it will cover every piece more evenly

This recipe is killer ! It is awesome good and me and my Grand kids just loved it. I lowered the butter by 1/4 cup - used a stick and a half. After I put popcorn on baking pan I sprinkled white chocolate chips all around. So Yummy ! I will make this again and again

My sister is allergic to wheat.  Wheat shows up in the most unlikely of places, even some chocolate.  Snacks for her are difficult to find.  She calls and asks me to make this for her at least once a month.  It's quick, easy and delicious!

Totally addicting!  For some reason I had to cook it longer in the microwave, and then 15 minutes @ 300 in the oven, but it all worked out and was delicious.  (I did sub pumpkin pie spice for part of the cinnamon)

I quartered this recipe for my husband and I. The only thing I did differently, was NOT roast the popcorn after pouring the sugar cinnamon mixture over it (we were in the middle of a movie, so no time). It still tasted DELICIOUS, even if it was a bit soggy. Yum.

The flavor of this popcorn was wonderful, however the popcorn seemed to shrink up after adding the butter/cinnamon mixture and baking.

This recipe gets 5 stars for taste, but I had to give it 3 stars because of the mess. I was hoping the cinnamon/sugar coating would dissolve and become something like a candy coating over the popcorn. Instead it turned out to be a granular coating. Pretty much like cinnamon/sugar sprinkled over toast. I had to hide this from my toddler or we would have had a real mess in the house!

Yummy! My family loved it!  I drizzled white chocolate on the finished popcorn.
