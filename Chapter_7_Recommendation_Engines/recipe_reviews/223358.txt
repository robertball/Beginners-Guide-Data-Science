This recipe could achieve true greatness with a few IMPORTANT adjustments: 1) DO NOT cook the eggplant slices before coating in egg and breadcrumbs. 2) Dip in seasoned flour FIRST as follows: After sweating the eggplant slices, dip in seasoned flour on both sides, and THEN dip in egg, and THEN in breadcrumbs. Continue as directed. Now, the key to any Italian red sauce recipe is the red sauce. You need a solid marinara to make this perfect, not a crummy jarred sauce. You're gonna go through all this work only to smother your delicious, crunchy eggplant with a jar of Ragu??? No way. Master a basic marinara and you can have it ready while the eggplant is sweating.

FABULOUS! If you're a bit intimidated by all the steps, just use a jarred sauce (Mezzetta is very good), but whatever you do, don't skip a step in preparing the eggplant. Especially be sure to use panko bread crumbs as directed. They're a bit bigger and crunchier.    Haven't tried freezing because we ate it all! Thanks so much for an excellent recipe!

I changed a few things.  I fried my eggplant, first dipping in flour, then egg and then Italian bread crumbs.

Even though it is healthier (not fried) it is still crispy & delicious!  Leave plenty of time for prep - quite a bit of work for a week night.  I sub'd fresh mozzarella for the shredded Italian cheese.  This is a beautiful, brightly colored dish that presents well and The (Meat) King loved it!

This is an excellent tasty recipe!  The way to keep the crunch is to put the prepared eggplant on a baking sheet and just top each slice with a little sauce and the cheese, instead of layering it and smothering it in sauce and cheese.  That way the bottom stays crunchy. Try slicing it 1/2 thick instead of 1/4 inch and baking the slices a little longer before putting on the sauce so it cooks all the way through. I put thinly sliced mozzarella cheese on top of the sauce and a nice sprinkling of Asiago cheese to give it more flavor an a little kick.  Oh so good!  Thanks for posting.

So my husband (who "hates" eggplant) was out and I decided to treat  my daughter and myself to a dish we rarely eat, and I found this less-fattening version. Wow! I followed exactly except that I already had chopped onions and green peppers, which we use in everything, so sauteed those for the sauce. Amazing. Panko is a great sub for regular breadcrumbs. Son and hubby came home and both LOVED IT!  I love that it's not fried. No bad fats, no need for salt except what was in the sauce. Next time I'll use my homemade sauce. So glad to bring eggplant to the whole family! 
Kudos to Mama Smith!

I followed the suggestions of others of tossing uncooked eggplant slices in flour, then dipping in egg, then into breadcrumbs. I also made extra and just parcooked them until slightly browned, let cool, then put into the freezer on the baking sheets and into a freezer bag once frozen. Now I can just bake them up the next time we want them. I also didn't bake them with the sauce. I just kept the broiler on and melted some parmesean on each slice, plated them and topped with hot tomato sauce. This way they stayed super crunchy. My husband who supposedly hates eggplant parm ate two servings. Whoot!

This was okay.  I say that because I was not blown away by it based on the amount of work it required. I guess I don't see the point in doing all the steps to ensure a crispy breading when you are just going to cover it all in sauce and cheese. It had a good taste overall but no one noticed that the eggplant or breading tasted any different than how I would usually make it. I did brown up some mild Italian sausage and added it to the sauce which added a lot of additional flavor.

The best! And worth the steps, which actually are relaxing to carry out. I just added fresh basil and a few spinach leaves.  Great compliments from all. This recipe I'll make again and again. Thanks Mama Smith!

This is an excellent eggplant recipe; absolutely delicious.  I did not change a thing.  It was a bit time consuming with all the steps, but the end result was worth it.  It was just my hubby and me and I'm so glad because we have wonderful leftovers for another meal.  Thank you Mama Smith for posting it.

This is so worth the work of getting the eggplant crispy.  I remember my mom's being gushy, for lack of a better term.  This is a keeper.
Be careful when you broil, it's quick but worth adding this step!

Delicious!  Added diced fresh tomatoes to the sautéed onions and garlic and simmered while roasting and broiling the eggplant.  Made for a chunkier marinara.  Everyone in my family loves this recipe!  Have shared with many friends who also love!!

Very good!  I liked that it was crunchy.  I did it on a weeknight but we were planning on eating later.  It was worth the work!  I would certainly make it again.

Excellent.  We used only 2 cups of pasta sauce but followed the rece otherwise.  The flavor of the baked and broiled eggplant is terrific.

I love Eggplant Parmesan, and this recipe rocked.  I didn't sweat my eggplant for 30 minuted but did soak in cold water for ten minutes. I used Italian breadcrumbs because i didn't have panko. Even my oldest who thinks eggplant is slimy had seconds! Score! I will be making this again!

I enjoyed this recipe a lot! The ingredient that sets it apart from the other recipes is the panko bread crumbs. I tried another recipe which called for Italian Seasoning Bread Crumbs. The texture and taste did not even match this recipe. This recipe is closer to what I am use to when ordering it from a restaurant. It's all in the bread crumbs, in my opinion.

Loved it! 
This was my first time making eggplant parmesan. One of my husband's favorites. It was some work but it turned out great. Even my 14 year old son loved it, and vegetables have never made it past his lips. My meat and potatoes boys thought it was great. So did the girls. 
Thank you for a great recipe!
P.S. I just used Italian Style Bread Crumbs (What I had) It was still good.

This is really good!  Yes, there's quite a bit of prepping but so worth it.  I used to fry my eggplants but no more!  This recipe is a definite keeper and for sure I will be making it again.  Thank you for posting this recipe.

This was a delicious take on eggplant parm! I didn't have Italian seasoning so I improvised with rosemary, oregano, thyme,garlic and onion powder. The eggplant held it's shape and I didn't get too soggy. I think the salt "sweating" step is key. I used a jar of Newman's pasta sauce and served it with spaghetti. The eggplant really sucks up the sauce during baking- when I make this again I will use another jar of sauce to serve on the side. This is one my picky son ate without complaint!

At first I thought I would run out of baking sheets with all the slices, but they shrink so it was okay. I layered this with ricotta mixture and marinara sauce just like a lasagna and viola! It is definitely a great recipe.

So delicious!  While I admit the preparation of the eggplant is tedious,it pays off. Not a dish if you're on a time restraint but so worth the extra effort.  Thank you!

Didn't change a thing and loved it! Picky hubby loved it too claiming it is "amazingly good". Both of our first time having eggplant, definitely not the last. Only downer is the time it takes, have to make it on a non- work night.

Really, even my meat LOVING boyfriend raved about this! I would suggest only using 2 eggs instead of the 4 that this recipe recommends. We used only 2 cups of our canned San Marzano tomatoes and added Italian seasoning to the sauce while it simmered down. FANTASTIC

I have used different sauces. one high-quality sugar-free jarred sauce and once with my homemade sauce. This has become my favorite dish to make. The Eggplant stays crunchy and it's just delicious! We serve it with angel hair pasta and salad

Made almost to the directions only used a few tip from other reviews. Dipped in four before egg, cooked after flour, egg, panko dipping not before. Then broiled as directed really makes it nice and crisp not mushy.  I made the marinara. Used extra garlic, fresh basil and chopped parsley to sauce. Excellent recipe my husband loved it.

I tweaked it a bit like others by first dipping the eggplant slices into flour, then egg wash then Panko crumbs. It’s a delicious dish and I will make it again!

I wanted to make this recipe because I thought the texture of the panko would do it, and it turned out great.  Not too wet.  I didn't have the parmesan blend but I did have some mozzarella slices.  So, I layered with mozzarella and plain parmesan.  It was a little labor intensive, but well worth it.  Will be saving some for a couple of meals.

If this recipe didn’t taste so good, I would not go through the hassle. The extra steps, sweating, baking, broiling, are well worth the time. This is really good eggplant.

It had a good flavor and tasted even better reheated. The only reason I gave it four stars was due to the amount of time required. It’s not a recipe I would do in a normal day.

Made it as recipe dictates. Absolutely great and easily frozen. I could see using this as a basic recipe but adding in all of the ratatouille veggies (besides eggplant, adding in  roasted onions, zucchini and peppers). Thanks for a great recipe!

The amount of sauce used definitely impacted the overall dish.  The eggplant were nice ad crisp until being baked with all that sauce for 30 min.  Next time around I will use 25% of the sauce called for.

This was an excellent way to prepare the eggplant without all of the oil! I did spray a little cooking oil on the slices before broiling as I thought they would be a bit too dry. I also added red wine to my sauce. This is a keeper!

I typically don't rate recipes strictly out of laziness. However, this recipe was so delicious, I felt it really deserved praise! It was a bit time-consuming, but now that I've completed the process once, it will be much easier next time. And there will definitely be a "next time". I don't think I'll ever fry eggplant again! I know many cooks frown on jar sauce, but that's what I used and it was tasty. Thanks for the recipe!!

The eggplant is going in and out of the oven 3 times, its seems a bit over-processed.  Any hint of nutrient is being sweated, baked, broiled, and baked again until this recipe no longer qualifies to be listed under the "healthy" section.  For the sauce I put it in dollops on top of the eggplant to not loose the crunch.  For easier serving, layer the eggplant in stacks.  Took  us 3.5 hours.  So tasty I give it an A+.

I really wish I could just add a comment instead of rating this recipe. I only did steps 1 through 6. Following AhhhJDew's advice not to do the initial bake first,  but to dip in flour, egg wash and then panko and bake for 15-20 minutes. When I saw the eggplant after the panko bake I coated the one side with a small about of spaghetti sauce, topped with a Italian blend of shredded cheese and returned to the oven until cheese melited.  The results gave a tasty eggplant appetizer. When the weather is cooler I will do the casserole part. But, many thanks for the recipe - with out it I would not have gotten the appetizer. I do plan on doing the casserole version when the weather becomes cooler.

The first time we made this I followed the receipt as written (except for the precooking). It was good, however in our opinion the eggplant was too soft and lost its crunch.
Ever since then we ,like most reviewers made additional changes. We grow Ichiban eggplant which is long  and skinny. The skin is thin and tender (no peeling required) and the seeds are small. 
My step 4 included coating them in whole wheat flour seasoned with pepper, dipped in the beaten eggs, then panko crumbs mixed with Italian seasoning and grated parmasean cheese.
I followed the broiling instructions (step 6). My step 7 was placing the cooked eggplant (somewhat overlapping) into a small casserole dish or small cast iron skillet coated lightly with cooking spray.  I moderatly spooned homemade chunky marinara sauce on top and sprinkled with grated mozzarella cheese. Placed it in a 350 degree oven and baked until the cheese melted.
The eggplant retained its crunchiness and was delicious. I have made this several times and its perfect every time.
If we have too much eggplant, after its broiled and cooled I place some of it in the icebox and bake it later in the week. It keeps for serval days, I'll try freezing it next time.

I have made a few eggplant Parmesan recipes in the past but did not like them. This one my husband made exact to the recipe and LOVED IT! I made a simple sauce by sweating the onion and garlic in a little olive oil then adding a cup of Passata. Let it simmer for about ten minutes. It was ready for the recipe. Once he coated the eggplant with the bread crumbs (he used crushed corn flakes) he put the tray in the refrigerator for about an hour before cooking. We have found this helps to get the egg and breadcrumbs to really stick. A great recipe. Can't wait to make it again.

I really enjoyed it.  Looking at the picture, I see that I cut the eggplant wrong, but it was still really good!  I also got a little impatient waiting for the eggplant to soften so the thicker pieces kind of seemed like an apple or raw potato, but that's my fault.  Overall, I would make it again, but I'm going to be more patient when cooking it!

I loved this recipe!  It is a weekend undertaking for sure but well worth the effort!  I used a homemade sauce that I had in the freezer and I added goat cheese for a nice topper!  I even made a lactose free cheese version for my husband he loved it too!

I've made it few time and is always great!  Of course I tweak it a bit...use A LOT less onion, probably more garlic and don't need 4 eggs. Last time I didn't have enough eggplant so I used zucchini also. Delicious!

I'm not a fan of eggplant, for some reason, but when I saw this was crispy eggplant, I thought I would try it.  I, my husband, and my 18-year old son all loved it.  Delicious.

This is my basic go to recipe for eggplant parm. Easy, good, gets the eggplant cooked thoroughly. I make my own pasta sauce...cheaper, fresher and tastier. No, not as easy as opening a jar, but easy enough to make while the eggplant bakes. Really has that homemade taste.

I'm not much of a cook but I do love eggplant parm.  I followed this recipe  using my own sauce. My husband and I devoured it...just as great the next day!  Next time I will slice the eggplant 1/2" instead of 1/4" to make them easier to work with. I only wish the prep was less work.

I have never made eggplant parmesan before, so am delighted to find a recipe that I can stay with. I did as one person suggested and didn't cook the eggplant first. I did use a purchased sauce but cooked it down for an hour to make it richer. This recipe does take a lot of time but well worth it.
Delish.

Turned out really great! I think I used 3 eggplant from my garden and just layered them on top of one another. I also used 2 Classico Tomato Sauce and it was extra yummy!

My husband (who doesn't really like eggplant) & I loved this dish!  I cut the recipe in half since it's just the 2 of us & it still was enough for 4 servings, because I served it with angel hair pasta.  It is a little labor intensive, but well worth it!  I absolutely would make it again!!

This is the best eggplant Parmesan and rivals that at restaurants. I followed the recipe, but  added mozzarella cheese aside from not peeling the eggplant.  Will definitely be adding to our menu rotation.  There were more dishes to wash but no frying, a plus. Next time I'll take others suggestions and prep the extra egg plant (bake 15 minutes, then dip in egg and breading) and freeze, for a quicker dinner option when time is limited.

Wonderful recipe. The perfect amount of oil, cheese and seasonings, and I loved the Panko crust. My tweaks: I added chopped fresh tomatoes to the pasta sauce as they are coming in from the garden now. For the cheeses I used equal parts parmesan, fontina and fresh mozzarella. My three medium sized eggplants were picked yesterday so I did not peel.  The perfect early harvest recipe. Thank you

We loved this recipe. Great flavor & healthier than the usual Eggplant Parmesan. I used Bertolli sauce with tomatoes & basil. I will make this again & again.

These turned out so well the first time I made them, that I have made them 4 or 5 times since.  The one and only thing I do differently is add a layer of chicken parm on the bottom and stack it with the eggplant parm on top (My husband doesn't like meatless dishes).  Delicious every time!

I made a few changes: I did not precook the eggplant before beading. I beaded it raw after sweating it then cooked it breaded at 450 for about 10-15 mins. I also used mozzarella for the cheese. And finally I did not have enough eggplant to layer so I just did a single layer in the baking dish. 
My husband and I loved it!

Hubby and I made this while on vacation and followed the recipe exactly except for adding a few mushrooms to the sauce. I was super - excited but was expecting something different, at least crunchier than basic eggplant parm, but i couldn't tell the difference. On the plus side, I did learn about "sweating" eggplant!

A wonderful version of eggplant parm.  I've always found it a tedious dish to make, with varying results each time.  This version is going to be my new go-to recipe!   I followed the instructions exactly and was delighted with the outcome!  The kids and hubby all gobbled it up!  It did soak up a lot of the sauce, but also remained crunchy.  I used jarred Mario Batali's Marinara and it was perfect!  I also think this can be served as an appetizer If you stop at the step just after broiling.  Just serve the baked crispy eggplant with some warm marinara for dipping!  Yum!

My husband really does not like eggplant parmesan but decided to give it a try since I was really jonesin' for some.  He really loved this recipe, but I found it to just be so-so, especially with all the steps involved.  Think I'll stick with my old stand-by.

Unless you want a "heavy" eggplant dish this one is not for you.  The Panko breadcrumbs really absorbed much of the liquid and made this dish almost " bread like ".  Next time I might try doing half of the eggplant in the Panko or simple stick to the old fashioned way of using only seasoned breadcrumbs.

This recipe is AMAZING! It melted in my mouth. I skipped step 2, and added lasagna pasta. Also, instead of the Italian Cheese Blend, I used just plain mozzarella, which made the dish richer.  Even though it was a bigger project, it was totally worth it :-). I'm sure I'll cook it again.

I added bulk Italian sausage to the sauce, and used gluten free Panko crumbs. I also added some shredded parmesan to the mozzarella. It was delicious.

Delicious! Next time I will definitely only make half though! Just my husband and I only ate 1/3 of what I made. Also, make sure you have time to prepare it, because it did take me all of 2 hrs!

Great recipe!  I made this for a huge family get together for a lot of people on my husband's side that I never met.  I didn't want to fry the eggplant as I had so much other work and cooking to be done.  The only thing I changed was I didn't bake the eggplant before I breaded them.  I took the advice of another chef!  regardless, it came out wonderful and I got many, many compliments.  Thank you!!

I followed the recommendations to skip the baking in step 3 and to dip the slices in flour before the egg and added grated parmesan to the breadcrumb & seasoning mixture.  I had beautiful crispy eggplant rounds after the breading & broiling, so I was careful not to smother them in too much sauce, which I did the first time I made this, allowing their sides to remain exposed and crunchy.  The result was amazing!  The dish tasted like veal parmesan that I remember from my childhood.

I have never has eggplant before and this always looked good so I attempted it. I did skip the first step to bake it before battering and I made a homemade tomato sauce from another recipe from this site. I didn't like it, but this was my very first time cooking and eating eggplant. Next time I'll use a jar sauce and plain panko bad crumbs instead of the Italian that is bought.

FANTASTIC! The best Egg Plant Paresan I ever made. I fixed up the store purchased sauce with some fresh sauteed onion 4 more cloves of Garlic some fresh flat leaf parsley and basil and simmered while tended to to egg plant. I did peel my eggplant as the skin can make it bitter. I also used aged pamesan cheese and Mozerlla as it is what I had on had.  Great reviews from my fiance.  Will be definately making this again.

I made a few slight moderations.  I only sweat the eggplant half an hour to save time.  Then I used 2 eggs beaten (not sure why you would need 4 unless they are massive eggplants). I left out the onion and Italian seasoning and instead just used basil and salt and pepper to taste.  Lastly I pre-baked the eggplant on each side 10 minutes and only cooked it with the sauce and cheese for 10 mins. It turned out beautiful, crispy and delicious!

Great recipe!  I even shortened it by draining the eggplant slices and then just dipped them in egg and Panko crumbs and baked until golden brown.  I then continued with the original recipe.

We loved this dish. I like the crunchiness of the eggplant so i made sure there was lots of eggplant pieces exposed to the heat in the oven, not covered with too much sauce or cheese. I didnt think it was that complicated either. Anyway it was worth making! Yummy

There are indeed a lots of steps, 2 1/2 hours end-to-end and a LOT of dishes to clean.  That said my kids devoured it and one even had some for breakfast.  Wish I could give 4 1/2 stars, deducting 1 star for prep time, otherwise a great dish.

My husband loved this.  I thought it was a LOT of work and I'm not sure if I'd do it again.  The eggplant was nice and crunchy until it was cooked with the sauce, then the crunch was gone.  Nice flavor but again, not sure if it was worth all the extra effort.

I give it a 4 but my daughter says 5.  It was very tasty but I thought a little dry.  I halved the recipe, so I think I should have cooked it for less time at the end.  I will make again but won't cook as long so the cheese doesn't dry out.  My fault so I'll say "try it".  Oh, there was one small change, I thought I had Panko bread crumbs but couldn't find them so I used Italian bread crumbs, they were still crispy.  Next time I'll be trying the Panko though.

My first time ever making Eggplant Parmesan. This recipe was easy. I used bran flakes, cheddar cheese, a little grated parmesan and only 2 eggs with a little almond milk (it's what I had). it tasted awesome!

Like the recipe, but the eggplant didn't turn out crunchy even with all the steps followed.  Next time, I will try frying it first or broiling even longer.  A lot of prep work, so this is a "once in a while" recipe in our house.

OK there is not going to be a photo with my review because,well, we devoured this. I made it last night, I really liked the crispiness of the eggplant baked in the tomato sauce. My BF and I had seconds. It took a LOT of time to make, so not something you would want to do on a weeknight after work and to be honest as I was salting and baking and broiling the eggplant I kept second guessing myself because I felt like I was cooking the BEJESUS out of the little guys. They ended up a little dried out.I think next time I will fry the eggplant, old school, this was a great recipe and tasted great but I missed some of that creamy mouthfeel that you get from baked eggplant. My advice to those that follow this crisping process is to use LOTS of tomato sauce as the eggplants were dry and soaked it up. Overall very tasty. Thanks for the recipe!

One of my favorite movie lines is "the secret is in the sauce" is so true on this.  Great recipe and I absolutly love using panko in this.  I used homemade sauce on this and is was delicious!  Thank you for the recipe!
