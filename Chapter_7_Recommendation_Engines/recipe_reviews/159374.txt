Most awesome. I ate my portion and wanted everyone else's. This will be a repeater in the summer, when tomatoes aren't so expensive. Great job, Sunny!

This recipe is really easy and delicious. I used olive oil, sliced garlic and then the fresh basil 'paste' you can now find in a tube in the produce department. This is a great recipe for using up extra tomatoes.

Very good! I used my garden fresh basil and tomatoes for this and it was an amazing way to cook cherry tomatoes!  I sauteed some fresh garlic first.  It's a keeper!  Thanks.

Wonderful side dish that takes so little time to prepare! Who knew a little pint of cherry tomatoes could taste so good! I opted for olive oil vs. butter and used a bit of kosher salt and fresh cracked black pepper to season. I love the  basil on these. Definitely serve hot off the stove as these cool down quickly. You could add a little shaved Parmesan or feta cheese to this to take it over the top - great with grilled steak!

I made a huge dinner for my family using what is in the garden and this was the quickest and easiest thing I made! It was their favorite!.. (besides dessert of course).  I wished I would've just made these!  Being a huge fan of garlic, I added a bunch of it and it was delightful!  Also, you're instructions were great and the tomatoes blistered pefectly!  THANKS

I must have made these 10 times already! Always looking for ways to use tomatoes. This is fantastic. Last time I added some crumbled gorgonzola cheese. Next time I'm adding some capers. Yum. Good job as always Sunnyshine!

I made these tonight and they didn't taste good at all. I was looking forward to the sweet with the sugar and the basil, but mine got clumpy and the tomatoes never blistered. Sorry, i won't be making these again. My 7 year daughter states " they're yucky".

I used fresh basil, added a little olive oil and omitted the sugar. We loved this alongside our egg breakfast this morning for something a little different from the sliced tomatoes we generally have.  Works well as sort of a garnish and plate filler too, adding color and interest, not to mention a nutrition bonus.

Oh how I love thee little sweet gems!!! I am a tomato lover, it's my favorite vegetable,(well fruit) and these are excellent. I made these as a side with dinner, and the possibilities are endless. I will make these as a snack, to stuff in a pita with hummus, and so on. The simplicity of the recipe is amazing for how delicious they are. I followed the recipe exact, and I can't stop eating them. These will be made many, many times before summers end, with fresh local tomatoes. Thanks Sunny for sharing (:

In my opinion this is nothing special. It is a good way to use cherry tomatoes if you have an abundance (As I did from the garden).  The taste was Ok, but like I said nothing special.  I think you could roast these in the oven and the flavor may deepen a bit.  On the upside this is super super simple to make. I did use fresh basil as I had it on hand.  It's not that I wouldn't make this again. It's just that it was kind of boring.

This recipe was fantastic!! I actually cut the tomatoes in half and added about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and garlic.  With the tomatoes cut in half and the lemon juice added, it made a juice.  They taste AMAZING...I think I will actually serve this over angel hair pasta for dinner.  Thank you for the recipe!

Was looking for a fresh tasting "sauce" to use on top of my spinach/ham manicotti.  I found this recipe and was not disappointed.  Did add a small amount of garlic powder along with the basil, though.

These were great!  This was a great way to use up a bunch of cherry tomatoes from the garden.  I loved the slight sweetness from the sugar.  I will make this many more times.  Thanks for the great idea!

Great Recipe! A burst of flavor and color on the table. We loved these. Found a container of color medley (red, yellow, orange and green/red swirled) cherry tomatoes on sale today and found this recipe and so happy with the results. Served with Turkey Wraps (from this site) and it was a healthy, great tasting meal. Will make these often this summer to use up tomatoes from the garden. Thanks for sharing, Sunny!

Oh my goodness! Who knew that something so simple could taste so amazing. Now I know what all the fuss is about. It took under a minute and a half from prep time to  serving time, and it looks beautiful on the plate. I will be making this for a quick lunch side, dinner side and when I want to impress. Thank you Sunnybird! I love you more now than ever.

I added a bit more sugar. I liked the taste but it has to watched closely. Once it blisters, you could be left with mushy tomatoes.  It is a nice side with eggplant.

I LOVE tomatoes - especially in season - I come from NJ where our tomatoes really are the best.  This recipe did not do it for us at all.  I'll stick with roasting for flavor.

This was a lovely colorful side to the quiches I served for lunch yesterday.  Used on-the-vine cherry tomatoes that were starting to go a bit soft, and this perked them right up. Next time I think they'll be amazing using fresh basil instead of dried and some diced fresh mozzarella.  Thank you for the great recipe, Sunny!

I just made this recipe and thought it was terrific! I used EVOO, sliced garlic and fresh rosemary (didn't have fresh basil). I immediately transferred them to a bed of baby spinach and added feta cheese. Yummy!

These made my lunchtime salad totally delicious!  And they're so pretty, too!  Only thing I changed was to use grape tomatoes since they're all I had (and are my ultimate fave as far as tomatoes go).  Never thought to do this - thanks, sunnyb!!!

Well this was a very simple way to use up our cherry tomatoes, fresh off the vines... I did forget the sugar and I think it would have just made these a little better.. Thx

I used olive oil and a little Smart Balance instead of butter. The tomatoes are in season so there was no need for the sugar. I used the refrigerated tube of basil as another viewer suggested. I sprinkled goat cheese on mine before serving. Decadent. We all loved this! In fact, I'll make it again tonight :)

This was absolutely delicious!!! Aside from a few minor tweaks, this is a winner for sure! Other than subbing garlic infused olive oil for the butter called for and using heirloom tomatoes in place of cherry ones, I made no significant changes - and I'm glad I didn't. It did take a little longer than a minute for my tomatoes to "blister" but otherwise, this is perfect. Thanks for sharing, SunnyByrd! :-)

I loved this recipe!  I have so many cherry tomatoes from the garden and was running out of ideas to use them.  I eliminated the sugar and added minced garlic to the butter (also used just a little olive oil too).  I used fresh basil from the garden instead of dried.  My family really liked them!

These were surprisingly delicious!  I don't usually enjoy tomatoes with sugar added, but the slight sweetness from the small amount of sugar paired really nicely with the Italian Seasoning (I was at my parents' house and they didn't have basil).  I had an abundance of cherry tomatoes given to me by a generous co-worker and I've seen this recipe recommended many times on the Recipe Exchange, so I decided to give them a try.  I served these with steak, potatoes, and fresh baked 10-grain bread.  I'm hoping my co-worker has extra tomatoes again soon so I can have these again!

Thanks Sunny! I have cherry tomatoes growing out the wazoo this year and am always looking for new things to do with them. I used fresh basil and they were lovely. I also really like making these to put into salads - like pasta salad and such - a nice change of pace from regular tomatoes!

Wow! Simple, delicious, gorgeous even with store-bought tomatoes. I can't wait to try this with my own cherry tomatoes. My only "issue," which wasn't really an issue at all, is that it took more than 30 seconds for my tomatoes to begin to blister...quite a bit more. I also used 1 tsp. butter and 1 tsp. olive oil! Thank you...I love these!

We really enjoyed this! I was looking for something different to use as a side to baked chicken, and had some cherry tomatoes that were, well, past their prime, and voila! I couldn't believe how quick and easy this was. I was a little paranoid they were going to blow up on me, but it all worked out, and came out really good!

I liked this a lot - only thing was I added the feta cheese and should not have also used salt.  I will make this again with that small change.  Great with "Greek Chicken" from this site

Followed exact recipe ingredients - also added plenty of garlic powder, some cooked fresh broccoli, and 1 TBS grated parmesan.  My tomatoes ended up with a mild Italian flavor.  This is an excellent recipe if you are carefully tracking WW points.  I used it as a side for some leftover lemon chicken.

Perfect recipe to use the bounty of garden cherry tomatoes SunnyByrd! I did make some minor changes, used fresh basil from the herb garden and baked at 400 for 20 minutes (stir a few times and watch to not crispy the fresh basil too much). Will make again, thank you!

This is great if after cooking you smash then add roasted garlic (pasted) and parmesan cheese.  Lather it up on some french bread slices and YUMMY!

I thought these tasted okay. I have never had blistered tomatoes before. The only change I made was using about 1/2 the dry basil, as I find it kind of strong, and using kosher salt. I jumped when the first one split open as it made quite the spitting sound. The skins on my tomatoes seemed kind of tough. I don't think it was the recipe, but more likely because it has been kind of hot and hard on the garden. No one but me ate any and the next day they took on a sharp vinegary taste, for some reason, so some got tossed. Interesting recipe to try anyway.

I made these tonight to go along with our barbeque and they were the best!! I used olive oil and added the tomatoes, then when they started making a popping noise I sprinkled on a little seasoned salt and took them out of the pan and sliced up fresh basil out of my garden and sprinkled it on the tomatoes. They were wonderful..   ( I forgot the sugar and not sure I would even use it now it turned out so great)

This is very good. I sweated some garlic before adding the sugar, and tomatoes, plus I use fresh basil. This is very good by itself, but tossed with cooked fresh green beans it's phenomenal.

This makes a very nice & very quick side dish. A good way to eat more tomatoes than if they were plain. And, any herbs that work with tomotoes will do.

FAN-TAS-TIC!  After two bites my husband said "Them's good 'maters hun."  Then he went back for seconds.  Then he felt the need to finish the last few in the pan.  My husband has never gone back for seconds (or thirds) willingly for veggies.  Thanks SunnyB for sharing what will become a staple at my house.

These were so very good just the way the recipe is written--perfect for that last minute panic when you wonder if you actually have enough food to plate!  And it can be altered in so many different ways, and that makes it even a more precious addition to my collection of sides!  Thanks, SunnyByrd!  PS  I loved it when they popped!

Excellent! If you like this then you should try the recipe for cherry tomatoes and green beans - it's same flavors!  This is a new keeper!

This is an excellent way to use up all those cherry tomatoes from your garden. I followed this recipe except instead of using fresh basil, I used a squeeze tube of basil. I had lots of compliments from my dinner guests. And the best part, this recipe is super simple.

I cooked the tomatoes a little longer. It’s just my preference. The flavor was nice!  We served cubed fresh mozzarella on the side so people could add it for a caprese taste. Everyone loved that addition. We’ll make it again for sure. So easy!

When I tried the first two I thought they were good but nothing special. After one or two more I realized these little things are addictive!

I wouldn't change any of the ingredients. I did cook a bit longer than 1 min but not by much. 

Finished a pint of tomatoes between two people.

This is such a great recipe, I had the tomatoes already left over from salads earlier in the week and this turned them into a completely different side dish to pair with grilled chicken.

This is one of the fastest recipes I've made since starting cooking in my retirement and so tasty. I don't understand all the reviews that state it turned into juice or sauce--I cooked mine (and only half the recipe for two of us) for three full minutes on medium high heat instead of the less than one minute recommended and the tomatoes still didn't blister but were nicely warmed (more like sizzling hot!) and tender. I used olive oil instead of butter, doubled the basil and added garlic and capers. I'm not sure of the reason to add sugar as it didn't seem to add any sweetness but probably added calories. We had them on top of raw spinach leaves and arugula and drizzled the pan liquid over everything as a dressing (I used a lot of olive oil) and were pleasantly surprised that the heat was enough to partially wilt the greens resulting in a warm salad that was delicious. With the partial wilting factor,  next  time we may try putting it over mustard greens for a more peppery flavor and adding some shredded cheese.

Great, easy recipe and something different to do with a bounty of summer cherry tomatoes!  Didn't add the sugar but tossed in a clove of chopped garlic.  Served with t-bone steaks - was awesome!

Keeper! Quick and easy. If you wish to add an extra flavor add one garlic clove  and sautee it until fragant before adding the tomatoes! Delicious!

EXCELLENT. These have very little work to them but great
flavour. It's all about that little bit of sugar. It just changes it a
bit from the  usual roasted ones. Always love when tomatoes 
get a little ripe and can use up with these recipes . Made with
Greek Lemon Chicken and Potatoe Bake. Very good dinner, for not a lot of work.

Tastes a lot like the heated-up version of sprinkling tomatoes with Good Seasons Italian. I think you can get away with cutting the sugar in half.

These were nice - I made them this summer.  Easy to make and added just a bit of "flare" to the table.  It took a bit longer than described for the tomatoes to blister, but boy were they flavorful!

Wonderful, simple & healthy recipe for tomato LOVERS! I had a garden overflowing with cherry tomatoes of all colors and I needed a recipe to use them up. Found this and loved it. I ate every last one and my boyfriend enjoyed them as well. I would recommend using home-grown or locally grown tomatoes for a tastier experience!

This was amazing - simple and impressive at the same time. Made a great side dish to tonight's roast chicken.  The basil and tomato flavours really popped and looked gorgeous.  I even forgot the salt and pepper and it was perfect. Before washing the pan I scraped off what turned out to be lovely caramel with a hint of basil: a surprise mini-dessert.  so tasty. thanks for this recipe!

When I first seen this recipe I thought it didn't sound very good, but I had a ton of cherry tomatoes to use, and thought I'd try it. It was yummy! I added some garlic. The next time I make this I will put it over pasta.

This is such a simple, tasty side dish! I used a mixture of yellow grape and red cherry tomatoes from my garden...they were beautiful and so delicious! Thanks for sharing...I will be making these again!

Perfect - easy, quick, and delicious.  I added fresh basil at the end, since I had it.  I'll be making it again for company, I'm sure!

I would never think to eat tomatoes like this. Someone gave me a bunch of them right out of the garden, and other than salad, I didn't know what else to do with them. These were amazing!!!!!Thanks for such a simple and good recipe, def a keeper.

I just picked my first bowl of grape tomatoes, so I was very choosey about what I was going to make with them.  I trust Sunny for a good recipe, but because I like tomatoes right off the vine, I still wasn't too sure about this;  therefore, I only made half the recipe......then I made the other half!  EXCELLENT!!  Thank you Sunny for sharing such an EXCELLENT recipe!

YUM, YUM, YUM...These were PERFECT! I didn't have just plain dried basil, so I used italian seasoning instead, but kept the recipe exact otherwise. My 2 year old could not get enough of these, but I figured that because he is a tomato lover. I think he ate more than we did! These were the perfect accompaniment to our grilled steak dinner, and will be a new side dish staple at our house! Thanks, Sunny Pie!!! ;)

Not sure what I expected, but this turned out wonderfully!!  I used "snacking tomatoes" and they blistered beautifully.  This recipe brought out the great, sweet flavor of the tomatoes.  I will make again soon.

Wow! These were so good and so simple. I needed an extra side for dinner and had some tomatoes I needed to use up. This was perfect. So quick which was good because I already had dinner on the table and needed a veggie. The kids loved these as well. Thanks!

This was solid, easy, but nothing to completely wow about. We'll probably make it again.

These were easy to make but mine didn't look nearly as preety as the picture. My mom and I can't agree, she likes hers really undercooked but I prefer mine cooked more. Either way I cook them one of us is unhappy. I would make these again if we had a lot of tomatoes from the garden but I wouldn't but tomatoes out of season or anything just for this recipe.

I have also made variations of these but I usually blow mine apart!  These were great, the sugar intensified the flavor and went well with our fish.  I will be making these again.

Very good.  I have always made these, but never with any sugar, definitely loved it! Hubby is not too crazy about them, he thinks all cooked tomatoes taste rotten...what does he know!  Both of the girls and I loved it. Will definitely make again, and again, and again.  Thanks for the recipe Sunny!

Tasty! I'm always looking for something to do with all my cherry tomatoes in the summer.
