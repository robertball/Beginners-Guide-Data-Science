I tried this the other night, and it came pretty good but not at all the way it was intended.  First of all, I don't think the author of this recipe could have possibly meant 1 sheet of puff pastry.  I use Pepperidge Farm puff pastry and one sheet of that will NOT roll out that much.  Maybe pie crust or phyllo?  My pate-mushroom mixture just went all wet, so I don't think rolling it up like a wellington would have been so successful anyway.  I wound up putting the fish in a 11x7 pan, topping it with the pate-mushroom mix and the puff pastry on top of that.  It tasted great, and even reheated well, but it was a fussy recipe for what you wind up with IMHO.  I probably won't make it again for that reason.

We could not find any salmon pate, so we just bought some chunked, bagged salmon and added it.  I eventually want to try it with the pate, but as it was...it was delicious.  We will definitely be having this again.  We are adding it to our list of fav's.

Don't like smoked salmon?  Me either, but the modification I found made a yummy dish.  While trying to find the pate and discovering the cost vs. how much I needed, decided to taste some aged cheddar being sampled nearby.  I had the thought to try that instead.  Shredded it and combined with cream and mushrooms/onions.  Used Sam's club fillets and wrapped each one with 1/2 a sheet for individual dinners.  Turned out GREAT!

very good. After reviews I used a pouch of salmon in place of the pate. I used Tilapia (had it on hand). Everyone enjoyed it.

Pretty good.  Nice presentation.  Mixed reviews among my 4 kids and hubby.  Next time I will try with a few changes as the salmon pate was a little overpowering for my family's taste.  This recipe made enough for two nights for my family of 6.

This was excellent! I did vary from the measurements but not the ingedients and I found this to be fantastic! I will be making this again. Mine could have easily fed 6 people.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.  It was easy to make and looked great - the puff pastry I bought was the perfect size, and the egg wash on top gave it a nice golden crust.  I thought the taste was good, but unfortunately the family didn't rave about it as much as I was hoping.  I got more of an, "eh it's pretty good" reaction.  Like other reviewers, I didn't use the pate; I used regular smoked salmon which I finely chopped and mixed with the cream.  Since I didn't use the pate, maybe it could have used a little salt to really pull out the flavors.

I couldn't have been more pleased with this! Really impressed my veggie boyfriend! So sad that the pic I took is too small to upload as it looked magnificent. Had to use common sense with the amount of ingredients and the other reviews were v.helpful (eg draining the mushrooms to avoid sloppiness.) Bravo!
