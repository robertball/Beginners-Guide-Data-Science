Good for just a few ears, for larger quantities use the oven @ 350F 30 min cook time, same result.

Wow - this really works! I love corn on the cob but dread the whole cleaning process because the silk gets all over the place and nine times out of ten some of it is inevitably left on the cob. This was so simple and so easy it leaves you wondering "why didn't I think of that?". Definitely give this one a try - you won't regret it! Thanks Chef John for sharing a great kitchen technique that I won't forget!

Watched Chef Johns video and noticed he was using a 1500 watt microwave 
When following his recipe keep this in mind 
my unit is small 700 watt unit so for average size ears i nuked them for about 4 minutes 
Perfect  i'm in love no more pans of water and waiting for reboil

Perfect. We tried this a couple of years ago, without much success. This time, I cooked two ears of corn for four minutes on high, left them in the microwave for about a minute.  Not a single silk remained! My microwave is old and small in size..not sure about the wattage. I might be able to cook four years at one time, depending on size. Might also be able to cook five: three on the bottom and two on top, rearranged halfway thru the cook time. After I removed the husks, I wrapped the corn in a clean tea towel and put it in the oven (cold oven) until the rest of our meal was ready.

I have been cooking corn this way for several years now, it's great but I find 2 minutes is plenty for really fresh corn. If I do several at a time I still use about 2 minutes per ear, rotate them after the first 2 minutes then keep the cooked ones warm wrapped in a dish towel. I've done as many as 12 this way and it doesn't heat up the kitchen the way a pot of boiling water does.

Used this method and then shucked the corn and grilled for a few minutes to get a light char.  Delicious!!! Will definitely use this method again!!!

This is wonderful! It's so easy, tastes fresh, and will be my favorite way to cook corn on the cob from now on. Remember that if it's difficult to squeeze the corn out, cut a little more off the big end. Thanks Chef John!

Yippee.  Chef John does it again!  So easy.  And GOOD too.  My corn wasn't even all that fresh.  Clean up took four seconds.  Really.

This is the easiest, fastest, cleanest no brainer way to cook corn on the cob. I would have never thought to cook it in the microwave but it turns out perfect every time. It is amazing that this method for removing the husk and silk is so simple. The whole family thought it was the best corn on the cob they have ever had.  It comes out juicy and sweet. I'll never do corn on  the cob any other way. Thanks Chef John!

This was a first for me.  I've microwaved corn on the cob before, husked and wrapped in wax paper and was skeptical about trying this recipe.  It worked like a charm! I microwaved 2 cobs for 5 minutes and 55 seconds.  Perfect! No more messy housing cons for this gal ever again!

For those of us who love fresh corn on the cob, but dread the husking and boiling required just to have one or 2 ears, this is such a great approach.  Simple, quick and no mess.  Thank you Chef John!  You’ve done it again!

So easy it’s like magic! However 3:15 was plenty for an 1100 watt microwave, and take the knife and slice a little down the side after taking it out of the microwave, then the corn slides right out easily !

Thank you Chef John! Great technique for de-silking corn. I'll never husk corn again. This technique really does work.

My Mom showed me this way to cook corn on the cob way back in the 1990s. I've used it ever since. Corn tastes way fresher than if boiled in water.

Easiest and cleanest way to cook corn, BUT then throw on the grill rotating frequently for 5-10 minutes to get that charred roasted flavor and look, corn perfection!

Husk first, sprinkle under sink litely, cook 4.5 minutes, much easier to clean before heating up!

Love doing corn this way.  Comes out so nice and tender.  All the husk and silks come off so easily - all in one piece.  No mess at all.

I can make 3 ears at a time in our microwave, which has a turntable. I cook them on high for 3 minutes per ear, then let them rest for about 5 minutes befor shucking them. Easy!

This is my go to way to cook corn now.  I like to cut the big end off before microwaving, one less step while it's so hot.  For four ears: six minutes on high, flip, another six minutes.  Comes out perfect!  :)

I just discovered this method of cooking corn and after reading the reviews I cooked my corn this way.  It was the best corn we ever had.  I thought that was just a fluke and tried again today and yes, it's the best way to fix corn.  No silk is left on and it turns out perfect every time.   Never going  shuck and clean the corn and then drag out the big pan and boil my corn again

This corn tastes as good as when you take the time to boil it.
The husks came right off. Simple and delisious

Thank You Chef John. My boyfriend watched me "squeeze" the corn from the husk & his mouth dropped open. Followed by a WOW. Corn done to perfection, as well.

Glad I found this video. The one I viewed elsewhere said to shake the corn out of the husk. That didn't work for me. I had a bit of a difficult time squeezing it but it eventually worked. I gave 4 stars because the other video mentioned that you can do 2 at a time (2x the time). Also,  one reviewer mentioned Chef John's micro is 1500 watts.  I think that should have been mentioned in the video. My micro is 1100 and 2 husks took 8 minutes.  BTW, luv your witty comments ! LOL

I've been making my corn this way for a little over a year and it never fails!   (When I think of the HOURS I spent cleaning corn before cooking it!)   One thing to remember - Always cut off the base of the corn at its widest point.   (I usually do this before I cook the corn.   It doesn't really matter though.)   If you go down to a point where the base starts tapering in, your corn husks will hold on to that ear and not let you squeeze the ear out.  If it happens, use a knife or kitchen shears to snip that husk back to the widest point.

I have tried this recipe before and it's fantastic. The only reason I've given it 3 stars is because you can only do 1 or 2 ears at a time.
