Hey, this isn't so weird if you have ever eaten the food of Puerto Rico!  They make a wonderful dish with ripe plantains (like a bananna but not quite as strong-flavored) and ground meat with olives and sofrito (a mixture of onion, garlic sweet peppers, olive oil and tomatoes plus culantro) and either roll it up like pinwheels or layer it like a lasagna.  The sweet and the savory are really very good together.  I'll bet this rather tastes like that and I am going to try it!

A great alternative to regular meatloaf!  The bananas don't overpower, and the mustard imparts a great flavor.  This also cooks up very moist.  Excellent recipe.

This is NOT regular old, plain American meatloaf. This is carribean/cuban influenced. Like one of the other reviews said, you may want to substitute plantains for the bananas for a more subtle flavor. I thought this was great!

Updated 7/6/10:
Seven years and three children later this is still one of my favorite recipes, and my kids love it too! I always brush the outside with Pickapeppa sauce - it makes a nice glaze with a hint of spicy to complement the subtle sweetness of the banana. I've also made a pineapple or mango salsa to seve along side of it, but even grilled pineapple slices work great!

Great idea! The naysayers have never had Carib food. Grew up in Jamaica, so I thought this was great! I served it with a little papaya chutney on the side.
Update: I made this again tonight and omited the seasoning, and added allspice, a bit of thyme, a couple of shakes of Pickapeppa, and topped it with sweet catsup. Oh, and used turkey meat. Hubby liked it better this way.

Quite interesting. Really moist and definitely different which is what you really need in a meatloaf. Banana taste might not appeal to all but the title may give them a clue to stay away from this one.

This was an outstanding recipe, the banana put the right amount of moisture and sweetness into the meatloaf. I used a banana that was turning brown.

A very interesting alternative to regular Meatloaf! Sometimes we see bananas as simple dessert fare but many cultures use bananas or plantains in their day-to-day meal preparations.I found the bananas lended themselves well with the mustard and spices.

This was pretty good! I'm impressed! 

I thought it was a little weird, so I figured I'd give it a try. Because I didn't have any bananas, I used a pretty ripe plantain.

I thoroughly enjoyed this dish, the hint of Banana gave this meatloaf a fun and tasty alternative to the norm. I used Ground Turkey instead of beef.

I cook for 10 people and one VERY picky 8 y/o and this is now our way of doing meatloaf. The picky eater consumes large amounts of this meatloaf. His mother is quite picky, so to have both of them eat it and like it was quite a feat. Thank you wo much. I changed nothing which is also very strange for me.

It certainly smelled like banana bread cooking.  I made a mango/pineapple salsa to go with it.  And told my family it was Jamacian meatloaf.  They were fine with that. Hope I remember to make this next time I need to take a dish.

I’ve been meaning to try this recipe for a while and I finally did!  Husband and I loved how the meatloaf turned out.  The banana flavor was very subtle, and if I didn’t know to look for it I don’t think I could have guessed what it was.  It was very moist and tender.  The banana was mashed really well into a really consistent texture, so it was very evenly distributed.  Also, I added more onion than called for (I used half of a small onion) and that likely masked the banana flavor as well.  Used rice instead of bread crumbs; just a personal preference.  As per suggestions of others, I went all out and called in a Jamaican meal:  served the banana meatloaf with Jamaican Coleslaw and a tropical mango salad.  We will definitely make this again, maybe even make it into the standard meatloaf recipe.

Traditional, it is not. But it absolutely fits the bill for an unusually good meal for those with a sense of adventure.  I took the hint from other reviewers who said the style of food is Caribe and went with it.  Rather than regular bread, I used cinnamon raisin bread in the meatloaf. As a side dish, I served mashed sweet potatoes with pinch of cinammon and brown sugar and an array of fruits like pomegranate, mango, and asian pear.  There was no need to add egg, milk, or butter to any part of the meal.  Fun, different, highly recommended.

When I was looking for a new meatloaf recipe, this screamed at me to try it. I always read the reviews to see what other people thought of the recipe or did differently. Even though some thought this was an awful recipe I still had to try it. First time I made it I used half of the banana called for and made it with ground beef it was ok but I decided to give it another try with the full amount of banana and instead make it with ground turkey. THIS WAS WONDERFUL!!! It is definitely better with the turkey and lower in fat. Thanks for this recipe I will be making this again and again.

As soon as I saw this recipe, I had to try it.  It was deliciously fun to include banana in the meatloaf mix and I was secretly hoping for a cooking masterpiece.  Alas, it was just OK.  Good consistency, interesting flavor, but nothing really special about it so back to traditional meatloaf I go.

I used 1/2 cup bananas and it was still a dominant smell & flavor.  Most people who sampled some politely said "That's different."  Not bad, but not "two great tastes that taste great together", either.

I used Veggie Patty mix rather than actual beef, and copious amounts of ginger and garlic.  So, I guess what I made was actually nothing like this recipe, but it served as an excellent guide for a vegan loaf.

I was nervous about trying this, but feeling adventurous, so I gave it a shot! I was leery about adding that amount of breadcrumbs, afraid the loaf would end up dry. It wasn't, thanks to the banana. It was good. Not excellent, but good enough to make again. I made a "tropical" type meal because like others said, if you aren't expecting "normal" meatloaf, you are less likely to be disappointed with this creative version! I won't make it regularly, but if I have bananas to use up and feel like something a little different for dinner, it will fit the bill.

This was unusual, with the banana taste, but very moist, and quite good. I will definately try making it again, with, perhaps, half the amount of banana in the recipe.

I thought the banana would serve to make the meatloaf moist, but the flavor was also quite evident.  Unless you're looking for a meatloaf that actually tastes banana-y, stay away from this one!

How very strange to add a banana to your meatloaf, but it worked.  Had some bananas to use up and put found this recipe when I used the "ingredients" tool.  This meatloaf held together very well and was really moist.  You could tell something different was in it and my husband only guessed the mystery ingredient when he saw the banana peels in the sink.  I would make this again.  Thanks Rayna for a unique way to make meatloaf.

Well, let me tell you a story. I was feeling a little intrigued by this rather interesting mixture of foods. So I decided to give it a go.  I actually used less banana than the recipe called for yet the flavour was absolutely disgusting. I can tell you I will NEVER attempt it again.  I ended up giving it to the dog and even she turned her nose up. Banana and ground beef simply do not work together.

I don't understand why people are so amazed about banana and beef combination. You have to try before telling judging. This meatloaf has a very lightly sweet touch, but the texture is not my favourite kind: I rather like meatloaves made out of oats than bread crumbs. I will try it again my way, with oats instead of bread and with a little more banana.

The kids loved this recipe. It was super moist, and stuck together well. I suggest you watch how many bananas you use, I've made this a few times and once used too many and that's all you could taste.

It was moist.  The consistency was excellent.  But I'm sorry, I don't like banana flavoring, and it was obvious it was in there.  Perhaps a banana lover would enjoy this recipe more than I did.  My 3 year old did like it.

I tried this recipe because I was intrigued by the combination of ingredients.  Needless to say, no one in my house could finish it.  It had the oddest taste to it and the banana was strangely overpowering.

I reccomend not putting salt in the meatloaf, it kinda has a tendency to be a bit too salty if you do and it's just better to add the salt at the table instead.

I love trying new recipes and this was one that sounded interesting enough to try. As weird as it sounds putting banana in meatloaf, it turned out really good. You can't taste the banana in the finished meatloaf, it helps make the meatloaf moist. I put my own gravy on it and my kids and husband really enjoyed it too.

This recipe is great! I was wondering if there were any banana and beef recipes online and found this, and we are very glad we did. The banana flavor was not very noticeable, but I would probably guess it if I did not know, but it all works very well. The texture is good too, despite the lack of eggs. I used a scant 1/4t of wasabi powder instead of mustard due to mustard allergy and it worked! (Someone compared the two beforehand, we have some seeds that are never used). It might also be good with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, etc. Thank you very much

This was a very tasty meatloaf. Our only gripe was that there was too much bread, next time we will likely cut the amount of bread in half, possibly without adding anything else so that it will be a bit more moist.

Great recipe! My family loved it, even my banana hater. The banana added just the right amount of moisture and a hint of sweetness.

This was a pretty good meatloaf recipe.  I often incorporate fruits with meat dishes all the time, especially meatloaves.  I used a full cup of finely diced banana instead of 3/4 cup mashed (I enjoy seeing the fruit).   Thanks for posting, will be making this again.
