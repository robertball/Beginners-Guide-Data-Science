I liked this recipe. I sauteed 1 chopped onion with 8 ounces of chopped mushrooms until they were translucent. I added 3 chopped tomatoes to the onions and mushrooms and sauteed them for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Finally, I added 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1 teaspoon chili powder and 1 can of mild diced chiles and sauteed for an additional minute or so. I mixed in the cooked millet and beans and stuffed the peppers. I topped the peppers with a sprinkling of mozzarella cheese and bread crumbs and baked them in a preheated oven at 350F for about 45 minutes. The stuffed peppers came out great. I had some of the stuffing mixture left over and I simply baked that along side the stuffed peppers. I will definitely use this recipe again.

This recipe is good as is, if you don't like spicy food. Otherwise,  add some spice to it, we used chili powder, cumin, and some Italian Seasoning--a lot of all 3. You don't need any more salt. Perhaps pepper, garlic, and/or onion.  After we put it in the peppers, I topped them with some bread crumbs and last but not least, some shredded parmesan cheese.  That was the only cheese I had in the house.  We don't microwave anything, so, we baked it at 350  for 30 min., the recipe says until tender.  It came out real good with the suggestions made here. Thanks Susan.

Great recipe!  Only problem was that the bouillon made the millet way to salty.  Then again I was using a product called, "Better than Bouillon".  It's always worked great but it must be way saltier than bouillon cubes.  Next time if I use "Better than Bouillon", I will only use 2 cubes worth.  That really was the only learning curb of the whole recipe though.

I added a few hardy shakes of "Mrs. Dash Fiesta Lime" seasoning salt and that really kick it up a notch.  Also stirred in a few glugs of some cheapo picante salsa.  A must!  I cooked it in the oven, not the microwave and it turned out great.  

Millet can be tricky to cook some times (the outside is mush and inside it crunchy still).  This link gives excellent instructions on how to cook millet to perfection.  Toasting the millet for a few minutes before boiling really is key!   Gives it a fantastic flavor.

Oh! Also added a tablespoon or so of nutritional yeast to add a cheesy flavor.  Serve with few good dollops of guacamole and voila!  Amazing. Thanks for the excellent recipe!

I doubled everything except the black beans. I also sauteed about a pound of mild sausage along with 2 chopped onions, some minced garlic, cayenne pepper and black pepper and added it to everything else. I did not use any boullion cubes. I cut the peppers in half lengthwise and baked them in the oven at 350 degrees.

Delicious! I added cumin, 3-4 cloves of garlic, and fresh cilantro.  I cut my peppers in half and laid them in a glass dish with tomato sauce at the bottom (a thin layer).  I baked them at 350 for about 15 minutes and they were awesome!  Thanks!

Would've been bland as written, but is a good starter. Added cumin, chili powder, garlic powder, cayenne, and pepper, and mixed in chopped jarred jalapenos. Topped with cheddar and sour cream.

Made a LOT of filling. Filled 5 peppers with enough leftover for lunch.

SO GOOD! I also added Cumin, garlic, chili powder, and black peper! I threw it all on the rice cooker and it came out great! The second time i made it i just chopped the pepers and threw them in with everything else! Great for a side dish or meal!

Replaced the tomatoes with our favorite salsa and added some cumin.  Yummy!  This will be added to our regular dinner favorites!  Love that it cooks in the microwave!  Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe has potential but I find millet to be kind of dry so if I make it again I will use quinoa instead.

My family enjoyed the fresh sweet pepper flavor of this dish. I didn't have any black beans so had to sub in a can of Navy beans. I also fire roasted my tomatoes before adding to millet mixture.  I filled my peppers and then baked them in 350 degrees for 45 minutes instead of microwaving. It left the filled peppers cooked but crisp. Will definitely make again, adding more spices.

Definitely not bad.  Followed the instructions of others and added some more spices to it, which was good.  I also topped it with sour lean and that made a big positive difference.

I love the idea of these easy and vegetarian stuffed peppers, but I think salsa in place of the tomatoes would jazz it up.

After reading the reviews it seemed expedient to cut-up the green peppers and just throw them into the pot with everything else. Also, added curry powder, Mixed Italian herbs, fresh button mushrooms, Thai hot chili sauce, black pepper, omitted the black beans (mine were getting furry in the fridge), lime juice, a red chili pepper and lots of fresh garlic. Forgot to add fresh ginger, but it would also add some flavor. This is extremely spicy, but that's the way I like it! Thanks for the recipe, it was a great beginning for a tasty dish.

This is a good basic recipe, though I enhanced it with some red onion, garlic, jalapeno pepper, and seasonings.

Pretty tasty although a little bland so you might want to add some of your favorite spices to it.

Loved it.  I only added 2 cubes instead of 4.  Adding 4 cubes would have made it too salty.  Added lots of garlic. Delicious!!! Will make this again for sure.
