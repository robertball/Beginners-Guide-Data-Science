This is my go to drink.  I use to drink whiskey and cokes all the time, but thought to make this instead one day and found it much better tasting. I use Maker's Mark and A&W root beer. It's smooth enough to drink all day, or night.

This was different. Not sure that I liked the combination of whiskey and root beer, but it was nice to give it a shot. (Ha, shot. Pun completely intended.)

Not unusual, but good nonetheless.
