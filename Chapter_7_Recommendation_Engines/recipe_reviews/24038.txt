If you want a four star recipe out of this...the key is to take the advice of the other raters! I hope everyone that tries this recipe reads the ratings first! 

I changed this recipe to go as follows (based on the suggestions of the other raters--and then it should come out more like 4-5 stars!):

Ingredients:
6 Boneless Pork Chops (Or really whatever you want to use...even chicken)
1 onion sliced
1-2 Cans Cream of Mushroom soup (depending on how saucy you want it-I used 1 can cream of mush., and 1 can cream of chick.)
1/2 Cup Beer (I prefer to use dark ale)
S&P, Garlic Salt, Seasoning Salt to prefrence

Season pork with above seasonings. Fry onions & pork in olive oil or butter in skillet until browned. Place in crock pot. In seperate bowl, mix together soups & beer, and pour into crock pot. (I added a dab of BBQ sauce). Cook on low 6-8 hours or on high 2-4 hours.

Good luck! This recipe, in my opinion, is worth trying if tweaked.

Wow. With all the mixed reviews I almost passed this recipe up! Glad I didn't but be forewarned...if you don't like beer (as the name of the recipe obviously implies) don't bother with this recipe. BUT in defense of those less-than-favorable reviewers - I can see where this would be bland without some modifications. Took "Midnight Angel's" advice: Took 6 chops and did a quick fry in some butter, all season salt and onion/garlic powders (all to taste). I then mixed the beer (reduced by half) w/ a can of cream of mushroom soup, a dash of chicken boullion granuels, added some garlic and ofcourse - the onions. Baked at 325 degrees for apprx 2.5 hours. Perfect. Fork tender and my roommate was dousing the chops in the gravy this produced. My daughter thought this was chicken and raved. My boyfriend wished there was more. With the listed modifications, I will surely make this again!!

I read the reviews on this and was skeptical at first. But my husband really wanted to try it. After reading them I thought I would use some hints and my own tips to better this recipe to our taste buds. Tried it and it was a Fav! Was wonderful! Here is what I did....
My variation

Half the amount of beer.
Pinch each of:
Onion Salt -
Mrs. Dash -
Lawry's Seasoning Salt -
Pepper -
1 can Cream Of Mushroom w/ Roasted Garlic (used Campbell's variety)

This time using thinner pork chops lightly floured them and seared them just to the browning point in 2 tbsp of oil (butter would work too) before placing in the 9x13 pan. Added the onions next. Sprinkled w/ seasonings and then the soup mixed w/ the beer. I cooked this in a 325 degree oven for about 2 hours (pork chops were thinner - so didnt need that much cooking time) Times will vary I suppose on size.

We will be eating this again real soon! And next time will use thicker pork chops as well. Also I had a great easy one step gravy mixture for using over mashed potatoes.

A bottle of Guinness made this recipe a smash hit. I too added cream of mushroom soup and fresh garlic, seasoned salt, etc. I also added potatoes during the last hour of cooking. My husband absolutely loved, loved, loved this recipe. It was a huge hit and he was looking forward to leftovers of it. I cooked mine in about 4 hours on high and the pork was very moist and tender. Made the house smell so good and we could not detect any overt beer taste, just wonderful flavor.

This worked great for my family.  I added 3 bullion cubes, garlic, salt/pepper to taste.  The beer flavor was not present like some reviews, maybe because I cooked mine on high, for 4 hrs which brought it to a boil.  Very tender!!!  Kids loved it, will serve again, great on egg noodles.

With modification this recipe is amazing!   I read reviews and did the following....
Seared my chops over high heat on both sides.
Lightly browned about 2 1/2 cups of baby bella mushrooms.

Layered onion rings in the bottom of crockpot.
Covered in a layer of crushed garlic (3)
Placed chops on top.
Poured mushrooms over chops
Poured a mixture over chops of: 
1 bottle of negro modelo beer, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, lots of garlic powder, 2 pinches dried basil, 2 pinches dried oregano, 1 pinch paprika, few shakes of lawry's seasoning salt,  fresh ground pepper, and  2 drops tabasco.

I let it cook for 5 hours total.   The first 45 minutes I did it on high, then put it on low.   1 hour before serving I thickened the sauce by adding cornstarch... then put on high until boiling.   Once it started boiling I let it boil for 5 minutes or so, then put it back on low with the cover cracked until time to serve.

I do not eat meat, and I am allergic to mushrooms so I did not get to try this, but my fiance and his buddy LOVED it, ate every bite.    I only wish I would've had time today to make mashed potatoes... I will for sure make them next time.

Both boys said the beer flavor was not strong at all.   I think it was the beer I used.   If you want the beer flavor mellow then use a mellow beer, if you want it strong, use an IPA.... the more hoppy the beer, the stronger the beer flavor.   I think the negro modelo was perfect.

Great recipe!  I used light beer, 3 chicken bouillon cubes, salt, pepper, garlic and thickened it up with some flour/water the last 15 minutes of cooking time.
Tasty!

This recipe was fantastic. I added some potatoes about two hours before the end of cooking. I took the broth and onions, poured them in a pan, and added a can of cream of mushroom soup with 1/4 teaspoon poultry seasoning and made a gravy. It was so good!

We didn't like this recipe.  I used 1/2 the amt. of beer, but the taste still over powered the recipe.  Sorry, I won't be making this again.

Yummy.  I, too, added a can of cream of mushroom soup, pepper and a couple of splashes of balsamic vinegar, which helped the taste and created an excellent color.  I doubled the onions to two, using one red and one yellow.  (Never too many onions in this household.)  My husband and I are NOT beer drinkers and we both loved this recipe.  Oh, the wonderful aromas as it was cooking, too.  I thickened the sauce on the stove for serving over rice.  I loved the challenge of tweeking this recipe.  For shame it got such a bad rap.  Even though I am an experienced cook, I love the ease and simplicity of this recipe!!

I took other reviewer's advice and I made a variation of this meal. It was super simple and my family ate every bite, which was shockiing! One of my brothers even said he doesnt like pork chops, but he ate 1.5 chops. 

What I did was I carmelized one large white onion and put that in a large roasting pan. Then in the same frying pan that I used for the onions I browned the 6 large butterfly pork chops that I had. I seasonsed them with S&P, garlic powder & onion powder. I then placed them also into the large roasting pan. I then put a can of reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup, can of cream of mushroom w/roasted garlic soup, and a bottle of good wheat ale beer (could reduce amount of beer if you want the sauce thicker). I then used the sauce to get all the good stuff off the frying pan and then poured that over my chops. I then covered them lightly with foil and placed them in an oven at 325 for 1 hour, reduced the heat to 300, flipped the chops and left them uncovered while I made the rest of the meal. Everyone loved them and they turned out great. Also, great plus, super easy to make and they taste like they took you all day.

While the meat was extremely tender, it really lacked taste!  If I did it again I would use a 1/2 can of beer and add ALOT of seasoning.

I followed Midnight Angels advice, but instead of beer I used 1 cup Merlot wine.  It was very good and tender.

This is wonderful!  I have made it several times since I first printed the recipe.  I use 3-4 cheaper pork chops, and sometimes add more bouillion cubes.  The first time I made it I thought it wouldn't have much flavor, but I was mistaken.  Yummy!

I really liked this recipe!  I didn't have boullion cubes, so I added some garlic, kosher salt, and parsley for flavoring, and then a bit of butter.  It was tender and very flavorful.

I followed the recipe and took the advise in the other reviews and added cream of mushroom soup. I also
Seasoned the pork chops with garlic powder
And pepper. Cooked for 6 hours in the
 slow cooker, and when it was done
It fell apart when you put a fork in it. 
I normally don't care for pork chops 
Because they dry out quickly, but these 
Were very tender and had a hint of beer
Flavor unlike some of the reviewers. Would
Definitely make again but my brown them
In butter first next time for color :)

I thought this recipe was just barely OK. I can see why so many people who liked it, had made lots of changes to the recipe. I made it exactly as written; the onion was a medium-size yellow one, the beer was Corona Light, and I cooked it on low for the full 8 hours. The pork was indeed very moist and tender. The beer flavor was somewhat strong, I thought, and I can see how the choice of beers can make a difference. The sauce could definitely use some thickening, and I think the whole thing could use more spices. I may make something like this again, but I'll definitely do a lot more than just this basic recipe.

First time I tried it as is - it DEFINITELY needed some "help" with the flavor. The next couple of times I've added different spices and it was much better - the best spices I've found with it so far are Everglades seasoning.

Another reviewer was right - this IS what pork is supposed to taste like!!     I didn't have bouillon cubes - so I used gray sea salt, pepper, a bay leaf, poultry seasoning, garlic powder, and Cajun seasoning.  I used  a bottle of extra pale ale AND a bottle of Miller Draft.  Once it was done  - I removed the meat, onions, and bay leaf and poured the remaining liquid in a pot.  I added more Cajun seasoning, a little water, milk, and Wondra and made a thick gravy. Topped it all off with crumbled cooked bacon - and yummy!!  I will make this again and again!!!!!!!  Thanks a bunch!!

Excellent!  The first time I've tried cooking/marinating with beer!  Very tender, "cut with your fork" chops...the onions were decadent.  My husband even ate them--and he dislikes onions intensely!  So easy and so simple...yet delicious.

This is one of my families favorite pork chop recipes.  I added 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to make the gravy a little thicker.  You can also use Chicken instead of Pork Chops.  Mine didn't have a beer taste at all.

Excellent, very flavorful and tender.  When I made this dish, I pureed the cooked onions, combined them with the beer/juices, and then thickened the liquid with flour and water.  This made a wonderful gravy - perfect over mashed potatoes.

I read the other reviews and seasoned the pork chops with some garlic grilling seasonings and then browned the pork chops and onions in some olive oil.  I put the chops and onions into the crockpot and then mixed 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 3/4 bottle of MGD along with about 2tbl bbq sauce, garlic powder and salt/pepper in a bowl before pouring it in. 

I cooked it on low for about 6 hours and when I checked it the chops were falling apart.  I had to hold the dinner until the next night and put the whole crockpot in the fridge.  My husband loved them, but did say I could cut back a bit on the beer.  The next day my in-laws had the leftover pork chops for lunch and loved them!  I agree that the original recipe was a good base to add to and made it into a 4/5 star recipe!

I thought this was really good.  However, I  did not fix in the slow cooker.  I put sliced onions in the bottom of a casserole dish.  Laid in the pork chops, sprinkled with black pepper and a little garlic powder, poured in the beer, covered with foil and cooked in the over for about 40 minutes.  They fell apart they were so tender and the flavor was really good.

I gave this a three because I wasn't all that impressed, my in-laws and husband loved it, I love beer, but it didn't turn out as I expected, I added a few things such as red potatoes, fresh garlic, Tony's, cream of mushroom and cream of chicken soup. If I make it again I think I will try Bud or Bud Light rather than a local dark beer.
And the chops were kinda dry,I make better, jucier ones on the grill. I'm sure it's an excellent recipe if you know what you are doing.

First thing's first, the chops DEFINITELY taste like beer...so if you don't like beer, you probably won't like this recipe.  I thought it was pretty good.  I took advice from other reviewers and added a can of cream of mushroom soup, used Guiness, and seasoned the chops with seasoning salt and onion & garlic powders.  Next time I will defintely add a can of mushrooms.  I thickened the sauce with 1 tablespoon cornstarch and served all over brown rice.  Very easy to make, low in fat, and high in protein...you can't beat that!  I will probably make again.

I tried this recipe and we loved it.  I used four butterfly chops and didn't cut them in half.  I layered the onion slices with the pork chops, used 3 cans of lite beer and 6 boullon cubes.  It was delish on hawaiin roll buns.  We will definately have this again.

I'm sure lots of people would like this but my family did not.  I don't actually eat pork but my husband was too skeptical on the beer as an ingredient.  He didn't even try them after I cooked them so for us, it didn't work out.

I thought that the "base" idea of the recipe sounded good, so I spruced it up and added my own flare by adding a packet of onion soup mix and a can of cream of mushroom soup. I used Corona Lite because that is what I had handy, and the flavor was good, but if you aren't a huge fan of using beer in a recipe, you may want to only use half of the bottle. Oh and expect some seriously potent farts the next day! Wowee!! So those who are nose sensitive beware! :)

I used a half bottle of Yuengling. My son said to rate it a 6 out of 5. My husband and I weren't as impressed but thought it was okay. If I make it again, I will definitely add seasonings but wanted to follow the recipe the first time I made it.

Smells really great whilst cooking and the chops were ultra-tender.  I think this is a good base for a more flavorful recipe - just need to experiment with some spices to find the perfect combination.  Don't think the chicken cubes are enough.

Listen to Alissa's posting. This recipe is good for a base in order to prepare further to your own preference. My husband loved this recipe because he loves Guiness. I liked it because the chops were tender and because it was a snap to prepare.

I don't think I will make this again.  I followed the recipe exactly, but I added some cream of mushroom soup like others suggested.  The beer taste was just to much for us, I used Killians beer which is what I had on hand.

I am giving this a 4 because my husband loved it.  I hated it and would have given it a 2, but to be fair I think it's because of the beer I used.  As others suggested, I used Guinness, even though I don't like Guinness!  The taste was just overwhelming for me.  As others also suggested, I mixed the beer with one can of cream of mushroom soup, but to be honest all I could taste was Guinness!  My husband loves Guinness and said this is some of the best pork I've made, so go figure!  I did come out very tender and juicy - not at all dry.  So I guess just use beer that you would actually drink and then you will probably like this!

My family liked the modified recipe - we used a can of Guinness and two cans of Campell's cream of mushrooms. Also used carrots instead of potatoes. We don't have a slow cooker, so I simmered it on the stove for the whole afternoon instead. It smelled fantastic and my parents asked for seconds.

Turned out really good, used all the suggestions from Alissa (below) and it did turn out to be a 4 star recipe.  Thanks.

We didn't care for this recipe.  I gave it one star because it did smell very good and the suggestion to make gravy with the cream of mushroom (I used chicken) made it better.

Great recipe, though be aware that the beer used can make or break the taste, good beer will result in a good taste and vice versa.  If you are not a fan of beer try using hard apple cider (or regular cider).  I've made this both ways and it's great!

Super easy and super yummy! My kids even ate the onions. You can speed up the recipe by doing the first two hours on high and then lower the slow cooker to low for about three more hours. Still comes out perfect!

The pork was indeed very, very tender. I like beer, but I'm not sure that I liked it in the pork. It was just ok to me. I probably won't make it again.

I found this recipe to be a waste of pork chops. They were very dry, like shoe leather.

I will agree with some of the others who reviewed this recipe... the meat is cut with a fork tender. We didn't really like it, I thought it was very bland. I also thought had to much of a beer taste, but then I didn't cook it on high like some one else did. It was by no means a BAD recipe, but it didn't work for us.

This recipe is terrible.  I will agree that the pork chops were tender, but the beer taste was terrible.  I even tried saving dinner by taking the chops out of the beer soup, putting them in another dish and covering them with Cream of Mushroom soup and baking a few more minutes, but the beer taste could not be masked.  I don't understand how others thought this was a good recipe!  Yuk!!

Not very good at all. The "beer" taste was not appealing. My husband is about as unpicky as they come and he could barely eat it.

I tried this recipe and didnt care too much for it. It was easy to prepare though. I thought the pork chops came out too dry and there wasnt much flavor.

This recipe was "ok" I liked the gravy that came off of the drippings, but the chops had a VERY strong beer taste...my husband liked it, but the kids and I opt out...Thanks anyway, it's always fun to try new recipes!

Quick, easy, & tasty.  Kids won't like all the onions.
