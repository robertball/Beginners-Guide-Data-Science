I made the recipe as written.  This was easy as can be to make and I like the almonds.  Flavorwise, it was a nice light taste, one of those things that the more you eat the more you taste it.  I might make extra coating as it did not make as much as I liked.  I am planning to make this as gifts this Christmas.

This was so simple to put together and was perfectly coated and crunchy. I didn't think it had a strong chocolate flavor.  I thought it was very good, but, my husband thought it was bitter - probably from the use of the cocoa powder.
