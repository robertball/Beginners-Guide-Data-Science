Season your salmon in what you like prior to grilling. That is my one suggestion. I never would have thought to use taco seasoning but it was all I had and I went for it. It turned out excellent. This was very impressive and one I will make time and time again. The radicchio adds such an extra touch and class. Loved it!

I was getting a little nervous reading the reviews about it needing more flavor.  We grilled it with our usual seasonings.  I was also worried about the radicchio bitterness but with all the ingredients combined, it was great.  I also added a tablespoon of lite mayo to the dressing and served with feta cheese.  Will be making that dressing for everything!

I think this recipe needs some adjustments for those that are trying to eat healthier, but are not hardcore about it.  The whole dish needed a punch of flavor.   Maybe add blackened or cajun seasoning to the fish, or some spice to the pico de gallo?  If I were to make this again, I would switch out the radicchio for another type of lettuce leaf, because it left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth after every bite which was unpleasant.
