This recipe was delicious!!!  I changed it up a little bit by alternating fresh apple and mango slices on the skewers.  Also, next time I believe I will add a little more mustard and cayenne pepper to the dipping sauce.  All in all, this was great!

This was good!  I'll have to admit I had to drive to 4-5 different stores before finding the mango preserves (spread) which I finally found at a Whole Foods store.  I think the cayenne was a bit too much of spice tho.  I will make this again but will add in some mushrooms, peppers, etc., and make some kabobs. Great recipe!!!!

I didn't really like with steak. I think these would be perfect with grilled chicken or fish.

I made these for a party. I was told it was the best party food they've ever had and keep asking me to throw another party just so they can have these skewers!

This tasted fantastic... it was one of those recipes where my wife said she wasn't really hungry as I was cooking and then ended up grabbing seconds.  

We don't have mango preserves in my little town, so I ended up using apricot preserves instead, which worked out fine.  Also, I threw in some pepper and onion slices between the meat, which also worked out well.  The meat was so good, in fact, that the dipping sauce was basically unnecessary.  Highly recommended!

Oh wow, these suck in so much flavor for such a short marinade time!  I threw some bell pepper and onion chunks in with the beef.  So delicious!

Very enjoyable.  My BF especially liked the dijon dipping sauce.
