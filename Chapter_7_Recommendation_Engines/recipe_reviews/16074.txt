This is the best broccoli casserole!!!
There are some tips to make it better though if it turns out to dry for you.

1. The best bowl to use is one of those round pyrex bowls with the lid. If you need more then just do another one in a separate bowl. These are the best because they aren't too deep and not too flat.

2. Cook broccoli in pan just enough to thaw it, drain the water then spread brocolli between paper towels on countertop to dab up excess water. It should not be wet.

3. After shredding the cheese, chill it. It's so much easier to handle if you do it this way.

4. Layer broccoli and cheese. Cheese should be the last layer on top.

5. Crush crackers pretty fine with maybe a few little chunky bits.

6. Evenly coat butter, be careful not to pour, but drizzle it until all crumbs are evenly coated.

7. It only needs to be in the oven 20 minutes or until top is golden brown.

This should have a nice crispy buttery taste on top and broccoli should be soft, tender, and very cheesy. It should not be dry at all Excellent.

This is the most requested casserole/recipe at every gathering.  Even those who use other broccoli casserole recipes ask for this one.  My family recipe uses the same ingredients but different instructions.  If you can't find two 10 oz packages of broccoli, use one 16 oz and 3/4 pound of cheese.  First cook the broccoli according to package directions then drain well.  Cube the cheese (velvetta works best).  Cubing is easier if you spray the knife with cooking spray.  Mix broccoli and cubed cheese then pour into a shallow casserole dish.  Melt butter or margarine and mix well with one roll of crushed round buttery crackers.  Spread over the broccoli and cheese.  Bake about 20 minutes.  Follow these preparation instructions and you will never have a dry casserole or need to add any additional butter, milk or melt the cheese first.  This is guaranteed to disappear quickly!

As always, I read everyone's comments before trying this... I used fresh broccoli, chopped and steamed a bit.  I used up the cheese I had on hand (some extra sharp cheddar, and 1/2 a package of the shredded Sargento cheddar-blend).  I had townhouse crackers, so I put them in the chopper (to the delight of my 3-yr-old son!), and mixed them with a couple of tablespoons of melted butter before spreading atop the chopped broccoli & cheese mixture.  I baked it at 350 for about 35 mins.  It was DELICIOUS!!!  Will definitely make again.

This is one of my favorites!  I cooked the broccoli in the microwave until it is nice and hot.  Drain any water.  Then I take 1/2 the butter (apprx 4 TBLS) and cut the Velveeta into cubes and add both to the broccoli.  Microwave again, stirring occassionally so that it becomes a creamy broccoli and cheese mixture.  Then, I pour into the baking dish and mix the crushed crackers with the remaining melted butter and pour overall.  Bake and viola! You've got yourself a GREAT side dish!  You won't get any frozen bits and this microwave process speeds things up.  I love it and only serve it on special occassions and holidays.  GREAT RECIPE LEIGH!

This is a classic holiday recipe in my home - and over the years it has become MANDATORY that I make this dish.  There are a couple of things that I do differently, however, the first being that I use a 1 LB. (16 oz) brick of velveeta cheese and secondly, I slightly defrost the frozen broccoli and drain the excess water.  I then separately melt the velveeta cheese with 1 T butter and once melted, I stir it into the broccoli.  The remaining butter (1-2 T) is melted and mixed with the crushed crackers which are then placed on top of the broccoli cheese mixture.  The casserole is then baked until golden brown and bubbly. Bon Appetite!

This is a great dish! I made mine a little differently. I used 3-4 bunches of fresh broccoli and cooked it. I used the 12oz cube of Velveeta, cubed and 36 Ritz crackers crushed and divided. Mixed the broccoli, cheese and half of the crushed crackers in a bowl & then melted butter & added to other 1/2 of crumbs and topped the casserole with it. Even people who don't like broccoli loved it, including my 9 yr old daughter! Will defintely make again.

If you read the reviews and change the cooking method, this will be great. As it is written, you will have problems. It doesn't tell you to cook the broccoli ahead of time, and if you don't at least thaw it 30 minutes is not going to be enough time to have hot broccoli and melted cheese. If you cook and drain the broccoli first it will turn out fine.

After reading the reviews, I decided to just make it as much as possible like the recipe and decide for myself. I didn't have frozen broccoli, so used fresh and added about 1/4 cp of the liquid that was used to cook the broccoli into the casserole. I didn't have the little round crackers either, so I just used the square saltines-type crackers that I had on hand. Everything turned out perfectly. I don't think that a single thing needs to be changed in this recipe!

We LOVE this casserole -- better than even the broccoli casseroles with the rice.  This is one of the most requested side-dishes to bring to Grandma's for Sunday Dinner!  And so easy and quick!  Takes ingredients that I almost always have on hand (American Cheese slices are a good substitute in a pinch!)

Honestly, I don't understand what it is about this recipe that would entice anyone to bother making it!  I had it at a neighbors house last week and I did not care for it.  Processed cheese, frozen brocolli and crackers.   I don't understand why anyone would take the time to make a processed/frozen dish of any kind.  My advice is to pass on this and go with fresh ingredients.

This is a family favorite for as long as I can remember. We make this for every thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter. We use a 9x13 inch pan, 3 packages of chopped broccoli, a little over half the big block of Velveeta cheese. I then melt 1/2 cup butter and mix with 2 sleeves of crushed Ritz crackers until moist. I drizzle any leftover butter over the cheese/broccoli mixture before putting the crackers on top.

I think this is an excellent casserole, but I find it needs 16 oz of cheese rather than the 8 listed. I used 16 oz of Velveeta, and it turned out perfectly!

This is a delicious, simple and classic broccoli casserole recipe.  First I cooked broccoli according to package directions and drained.  I cubed velveeta cheese and mixed with cooked broccoli.  Seasoned lightly with salt and pepper.  Crushed a whole sleave of ritz crackers and mixed with melted butter.  Sprinkled cracker/butter topping evenly over top of broccoli/cheese mixture and baked for approximately 25 minutes in 350' oven.  Turned out absolutely fabulous!!  Broccoli was tender, casserole was moist and very cheesy and cracker topping was outstanding.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.  This is a definite crowd pleaser!

I took the reviewers suggestion to precook the veggies.  I used a broccoli and cauliflower mix.  I doubled the amount of cheese.  
I didn't think for a second that my son would eat it, but he did.  It helps that he loves Ritz crackers.

I remember this recipe from church suppers when I was a kid! However, these days I use 2% milk Velveeta and reduced fat Ritz crackers. I also start out with just a little bit of butter, and keep adding only until the cracker crumbs are coated. You can't tell the difference, and it helps reduce the calorie and fat grams intake. :)

This is a holiday staple for my family and friends and if I say I'm not making it-watch out! I have a slightly different variation. First, I usually use the packaged frozen Broccoli&Cauliflower.I will defrost the mix in a colander until 80-90% defrosted, which seems to help get a just-right moisture level. Also,forget shredding, it works great if you utiize 1/4 cup melted butter and blend CUBED Velveeta with the butter in a microwave, heating for 30 secs each time, repeat the stirring and reheating until smooth and creamy-creates a thick but smooth cheese sauce and prevents this from being dry. Also, I add 1/4 cup grated parmesan to the cracker crumbs for a little something extra.

I've used this site for a long time and have always trusted the ratings of these fellow cooks.  This recipe was a total disappointment though.  I cooked the broccoli ahead of time as many reviews recommended, and otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Not good at all!  And I love broccoli.  Very bland. very mushy (though the crackers help) and the processed cheese got too dry and odd tasting after baking that long.  Sorry, but no one in my family thought this was good.

A little on the dry side. It was almost like it needed another "moist" ingredient. The flavor was good and my family enjoyed it overall.

This was very yummy!  I did make some changes but I think the final product is pretty much the same.  Instead of processed cheese food, I used a can of cheddar cheese soup.  Used fresh broccoli.  Crumbled the crackers directly on top of the casserole and dotted around with butter.  Used maybe 2 T. versus the 8 the recipe calls for!  Very delicious, DB loved it and came home for lunch the next day to eat the leftovers!

This tastes buttery and leaves an oily spot on your plate. I'd suggest either doing away with the butter or drastically decreasing it. You're already getting plenty of butter flavor from the "buttery round" crackers. So either switch those crackers to ground up saltines or bread crumbs heated in a little butter or use just the buttery crackers--but not both. If you don't, this recipe comes out to 25.6 g of fat per serving--way too much for a regular recipe I'd want to use. Try using Smart Balance Spread or some other transfat-free spread instead of butter as well to decrease the fat. Going with lower fat buttery crackers wouldn't have hurt the overwhelming butter taste, either.

This is just like our family recipe except we divide the broccoli, cheese, and cracker mixture into thirds and layer it in the baking pan starting with broccoli, then crackers, then cheese.  Do this three times.  Makes it more moist and the cheese is distibuted through.  If it looks dry during baking, pour some more melted butter over the top.

My Aunt has made this a family staple and my kids can't get enough of this when I make it - I need to make 2!  I have used both frozen and fresh broccoli and each turn out well.  I slice the processed cheese to about 1/4" thickness and place on top of the broccoli.  Then put a pat of butter on each square of cheese.  I crush the crackers in the sleeve and they come out with nice big chunks.  Sprinkle on top and Voila!  MMMM Goodness!  Love this Broccoli Casserole.  Don't need to change a thing!  Don't be deceived by the picture; it loooks  more like an ooey gooey cheese over broccoli with a crumb topping than a quiche.

OK,,this is the real deal! I've been searching for this recipe for 24 years after someone brought it to my wedding shower. Yes, it has processed cheese food, but that's what makes it so creamy. I used 1 fresh bunch of broccoli, cut into spears and steamed until al-dente, and then placed in casserole dish. My husband loved it. Nice dish for company or a holiday meal. Thanks for sharing!

I cooked the broccoli first.  Used velveeta cheese, cut into cubes, which I then melted in a large sauce pan on the stove with 1/2 the butter.  Once melted I stirred in the cooked broccoli.  I melted the other 1/2 of butter in a frying pan and then added the crushed ritz crackers and mixed. I put 1/2 the cracker mixture to the bottom of a  cassarole dish, Poured the broccoli cheese mixture on top of that, followed by the rest of the cracker mixture on top and baked as instructed below.  I gave this recipe 4 stars since I had to make some modifications.

I must be missing something because I thought this was not to my liking. I made it just as the recipe said to, and I normally cook quite well, but my family couldn't even get this down without a big glass of milk. Broccoli, processed cheese, and WAY to buttery cracker crumbs. The buttery taste was overwhelming and I usually love lots of butter, but this was just way too much even for me. And a very dry meal as well. Will not make again.

Yep, this is a keeper!  I used fresh broccoli, some real cheddar and only 2T butter so I couldn't give it 5 stars. But it was really good! Thanks so much!

This was great!  I used broccoli and cheese soup instead of cheese food.  I also skipped the butter and just sprinkled the crackers over the broccoli and soup mixture.  Delicious!

Wow, this was so good.  My kids went crazy for it and told me to make it again tomorrow.  I did not have quite enough Velveeta so I grated up about 1/2 cup of Gouda and added that too.  Next time I will use more crackers or a smaller dish to have more crust.  I also cooked the broccoli a bit in the microwave until it was just thawed and it turned out great.

I took the suggestion of other reviewers and cooked the broccoli first. I then mixed in the cheese, topped with the bread crumb mixture and baked per the instructions. My husband and I loved it.

I made this exactly as is for Christmas dinner. It was great. I've been making another broccoli casserole on this site for a couple years and was looking for something creamier. This was perfect. Thanks for a great recipe.

I think about this Broccoli casserole almost as an American classic. It's quick as a wink to whip up, easy to travel to a pot luck and great for large gatherings. Our family prefers whole Broccoli florets for more substance and better presentation. The Velveeta cheese melts into a creamy smooth sauce and the rich buttery crackers are a classic topping. Can be prepared one day ahead.

I have been making this recipe forever.  It is always requested by others at gatherings.  I season thawed brocolli with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and use a 13 x 9 pan on a doubled recipe.  It has never been dry as some others stated.

My mom had made this recipe for years and it is a family staple at holiday gatherings.  Yummy and easy!!!  I was surprised to see it on here, but happy other are enjoying it.  I sometimes use reduced fat ritz and velveeta with great results.  Enjoy!

Very good!  (used shredded cheddar cheese)  I save out part of the cracker/butter mixture to put over the top.  I mix in the rest of the cracker/butter as well as the cheese into the broccoli. Used 1/4 cup of butter.  Spray the baking dish with cooking spray.

This turned out to be one of the most popular dishes at Thanksgiving. The kids loved it and I have none for leftovers - thats a good sign. Followed the recipe exactly except as suggested by others ... I made sure the broccoli was completely dry after cooking it.

Great recipe.  I made this for Christmas this year.  I should have doubled the recipe.  My family is very difficult to please when it comes to a vegetable side dish.  Everyone LOVED this one.  This one is a keeper for me.

This is truly delicious and ridiculously simple to make!  I kept thinking I was missing something because it was so easy and quick to prepare!  I made a few slight changes -- I used half cheddar cheese (shredded) and half mozzarella (shredded) instead of the processed cheese food.  I also microwaved the broccoli for a brief time to make sure it became tender.  I was careful to drain all the water out too.  I plan to try it with fresh broccoli next time.  YUMMO!  Great recipe - thank you!

Quick and very easy. Great for a weeknight or Sunday dinner. Altered recipe a little by following  advice from another review which was to layer broccoli and cheese. Great idea. Will definitely make again...maybe once a week :o)

My family didn't like this much at all and we all love broccoli casserole normally.  It was pretty bland other than the overwhelming ritz cracker and butter taste.

I used fresh broccoli, so I boiled it for 5 minutes and drained it before adding it to the casserole.  I also used real cheddar cheese (shredded) and added a couple tablespoons of softened cream cheese.  It was REALLY yummy. :)

This is so delicious! Added 1/2c cheddar, 1/2'd the butter and crumbs and it turned out fine. Bake 10 min first just cheese and broc. Flatten the top, sprinkle crumbs first and then drizzle the butter for even, golden brown top.

This will be a 5 star if you try it the way I do it.  I used other reviewers suggestions.  I used fresh broccoli, (sometimes I add cauliflower too), I steam them (but not too long, remember they are going in the oven to cook more). then I add it into a oven safe pot, add my cubed velveeta cheese, stir together.  Add about 1/4 cup melted butter.  Stir in about 1/2 cup buttered crushed crackers (I used saltines, cause it is all I had).Topped with shredded cheddar cheese to cover and more cracker crumbs.  Not good for the waistline I am sure....But sooooo Yummy. The non-broccoli eaters in my family even had seconds!!!

12/22/12 - Cook then DRAIN the Broccoli Extremely well or it will be runny!!!
Re-evaluating on 12/16/09 - did this with frozen broccoli - almost doubled the broccoli to 36 oz, slightly thawed in the microwave.  tossed this with the cheese cubes--used 2 % and regular velveeta 12 oz.  Added  a few cranks of pepper and freshly grated nutmeg over the top of the broccoli before adding cracker, 48 crackers, topping with about 1/4 cup butter and 2-3 tblsp smart balance.  It's in the oven now in two pyrex so I can re-heat tomorrow for the office party.----------
Very easy, very yummy and very rich.  Everyone loved the flavor especially the buttery ritz topping!

A friend of mine used to make this recipe all the time, I'm glad I found it here! I cooked broccoli according to package directions and drained well. Then I mixed it with the cubed Velveeta in the baking dish and zapped in microwave until the cheese was melted and then I stirred. I prepared Ritz in skillet as per directions-came out great!
I had used a 32 oz bag of broccoli, 1 lb Velveeta, 2 sticks butter, 2 sleeves Ritz-perfect!

This was awful.  The cooking temperature was way off, and the casserole was dry and unflavorful. I would never make this one again.

i liked how easy this dish was to make, it looked pretty when it came out of the oven. i really wanted to like this dish but it was a little to rich for me. My husband said it was like eating a stick of butter. My daughter is crazy about broccoli but she just kind of picked at it and didn't eat much of it. if i had to do it over, i think i would probably lessen the topping and add in onion or some other vegetable with the broccoli. i would also think about just using fried onions instead of the crackers. the cheese was also just too... it just screamed CHEESE. don't get me wrong, i love cheese but this was over kill. It would probably do better with milk or canned soup such as cream of mushroom or chicken in addition with a lesser amount of cheese mixed into it. the casserole also needs different spices in my opinion... at least some garlic and pepper.

I had to change the "fake" cheese to real cheddar, my reason for 4 stars.  I used 4 oz shredded cheddar layed with a 14 oz bag of florets.  I crushed the crackers (Ritz) and sprinkled over the casserole, melted the butter and poured over top.  Very very good!!!  The real cheese was not dry at all!

I got this recipes from my aunt years ago...My husband loves broccoli, and this is my favorite way to make it. It's so easy! I always make sure to drain my broccoli very well, so the cheese doesn't come out watery.

Excellent.  I had to vary this recipe as I did not have the fake cheese.  I used about 1/2 cup shredded medium cheddar and about 3 oz of fat free cream cheese.  It turned out wonderfully.  In fact, I'm making it again tonight using corn flakes instead of crackers.

Although this was served at my thanksgiving dinner and it was very good. I had trouble with my cheese melting and getting it to blend in with my broccoli.I wound up having to melt my cheese in th microwave and pouring it over my broccoli. I literally had to pick the hunks of cheese out of the broccoli.I do not know what went wrong but am going to try again.

Tried this last night and I have to say, I was pleasantly surpriced by how much I liked it. I was wary of the ritz crackers, but in the end they were acceptable, however since I did not use the larger bag of broccoli (only cooking for two here), there were definitely too many crackers. Next time I will try less or perhaps switch to breadcrumbs, just to mix it up a bit. I did take the suggestion of mixing the melted butter, cheese and broccoli together first until it was all cheesy and gooey, I think that really made the difference (as well as steaming the broccoli first). All in all, I think this is my new preffered way of eating broccoli!

You know I always have every intention of photographing the dish but for some reason my daughter seems to get into it before I can. I gave this recipe four stars instead of five because I think doing the recipe as is makes the dish really, really salty. We liked it well enough as far as texture and it is a nice alternative to plain steamed broccoli. Next time I will definately use unsalted butter and use a little less cheese just to cut back on some of the fat content. Overall this is a keeper.

I didn't make this; gave the friend a recipe and she tried it.  She used chedder cheese and said it was a bit dry; maybe a bit more cheese next time and/or use velveeta.  She's not really complaining, though, bc her 2 year old, who does not like broccoli, ate this.

I followed the advice of one of the reviewers and did most of the preparations in the microwave.  All I had in the way of cheese was a mild Mexican flavored prepared cheese. And also, I was out of butter, so I used a spray olive oil, to moisten the crackers.  Since it turned out so well, I am guessing that no matter what you do with Broccoli and cheese and crackers, it will be good.  :>)

This is a great broccoli casserole.  I make it for Thanksgiving and its a success!  I do steam my broccoli a bit to avoid hard stems. I melt the butter and add crushed crackers to it to make buttery crumbs then add to top.

I mix all the ingredients in a bowl beforehand, then place in baking pan.  Then I dot w/ a few more bits of butter and also cubed cheese - seems less dry.

Half of the broccoli did not get cooked!  It was ice cold.  I had to heat up the whole casserole in the microwave, even after leaving it in the oven for longer than the recipe called for.

This was really tasty.  The Ritz add a subtle sweetness and texture.  Only thing I changed was to cut the butter in 1/2.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.

This was a fantastic recipe and I only made two small changes.  I mixed in a little bread crumbs with the cracker crumbs.  Some people thought the crackers were too overpowering.  I also used Velveeta and cheddar cheese and added a little half and half when I melted some of the velveets before putting it on the broccoli.  I will definitely make this again and got many rave reviews when I made it.

This is an excellent recipe.  Use fresh broccoli instead of frozen if at all possible.  I also added a bit of cheese to the (Ritz) cracker topping.

This dish was a huge hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. Here are my changes: I steamed the broccoli just enough to taw, once cooled and chopped and mixed in a bowl with the cheese and put in a casserole. I only used half of the butter and mixed with 1 roll of crashed crackers. I baked covered for 20 minutes and uncovered for an additional 20 minutes. I had no idea it would turn out so great.

I always made a broccoli casserole sort of similar to this, but it contained Cream of Mushroom and bread crumbs...so does my green bean casserole. So I decided to try this one instead for Thanksgiving for a little variety...my husband was skeptical because he loves my normal holiday broccoli concoction...but this was a hit. I made it slightly differently, boiling the broccoli until thawed and a little soft, I drained it, put it back in the pot, added a little butter, salt and pepper and then the Velveeta, melted it all, put 1/2 in my casserole pan then put a layer of cheddar cheese, then the rest of the broccoli, and the crackers and butter.  I think my order of favorites was the turkey, than this, than the sweet potato pudding I made. The crackers and butter make it.  Thanks for sharing! I will make this every major holiday!

Very impressive with rave reviews from many, many people. We used 1 package of Broccoli, 1 cup of All-Bran Multi-Grain Cracker Crumbs (place crackers into a blender for ease), reduced the butter to about ¼ cup, along with using 1 cup of shredded Colby Jack Cheddar Cheese for a twist. The multi-grain cracker crumbs gave it that extra flavor that was missing. Delicious – Thank You!

Very good.  I did make a couple of changes based on other reviews.  First, I cooked the broccoli according to the package instructions and drained.  I cubed the cheese (used 2% Velveeta) and mixed it with the broccoli.  Also, I added a couple shakes of onion powder to the cracker crumbs.  I may try cutting back on the butter next time since it seemed a little greasy.

Very easy recipe and delicious. I used fresh brocoli instead of frozen I would add a bit seasoning to pop the flavor, but it was great overall.

Thanks for the recipe! Very delicious, and so easy.. especially since I'm a college student living by myself. I just used regular marble cheese, made all the proportions smaller and also added some chopped carrot. Turned out very nice, thanks again. : )

On the plus side, my husband loved it!  I was not a fan though.  The topping was too rich for my taste.  Made according to directions except I used real cheese.  My son (almost 2) loves broccoli and wouldn't eat this casserole.  More for my husband, I guess!

I think maybe it needed some creamy soup mixed into it, it was on the dry side, the cheese did not melt into the dish properly, I do think the crackers made the dish.

We made this recipe exactly as written, with the sole exception being that we used cheddar instead of the process in the recipe. It can out great & we will make it again. The great part is that you can start with frozen brocoli and just throw in the dish.

This was delicious!  I followed the advice of some others.  I thawed the broccoli overnight & drained it.  My bags were 14 oz each.  I used shredded extra sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed, & it wasn't dry at all.  I didn't bother counting the Ritz crackers, I used an entire sleeve, & approx. 7 more crackers because that's all that was left in the box!  I sprayed the casserole dish with butter-flavored non-stick spray, then layered the broccoli, cheese, crackers & then another layer of broccoli, cheese & crackers.  There were 14 of us for dinner & everyone loved it.  No leftovers.  This is a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

A little too dry.  I didn't have velveeta so I used cheddar instead. I will try it again with velveeta, should make it creamier.

I ran out of broccoli when I made this, so I did like some other reviewers and added a 10 ounce bag of stir fry veggies. It was a hit at a family dinner. I also didn't bother with chilling the cheese and/or draining the broccoli on paper towels...it turned out great!

This was easy to make and delicious, even for people who claim they don't like broccoli. The only thing I would do differently next time is to add a 1/4 cup of chicken broth over the broccoli and then top with cheese and cracker topping just to give it a bit more moisture (was just a bit dry), but otherwise will be making this again!

I was disappointed when preparing it that I had to use double the amount of crackers because the original amount was no where near what was needed to cover the casserole. However the casserole turned out wonderfully and was a hit!

I didn't have any Ritz crackers so I used croutons and Cheez-it crackers instead.  May not be the healthiest way to eat veggies but sure was a delicious way to enjoy broccoli!  I'll be making this again for sure, thanks for the recipe!

I loved this recipe! I added some shredded carrots to the broccoli and melted everything in the micro and stirred it up well before topping with the crackers. Used roasted vegetable crackers for the topping. Yum!

tasty!  I took the advice of some of the reviewers and half thawed the  broccoli.  however, next time I will slightly pre-cook the broccoli in the microwave.  also, it would cut down on the oven time.

I made this as a side dish to go with the ham on Christmas Day. I put the frozen broccoli in the microwave and this really saved me the cooking time in the oven. I used 3/4 pound of Velvetta Cheese, cut into chunks and stirred the chunks into the broccoli.  This was a huge hit.  I saw people going back for second helpings!  Will definately use this recipe over and over.

Everybody loved this. I don't like broccoli, so I didn't try it. I added milk to make the cheese creamier and garlic and pepper for flavor.

I really didn't like this one very much.  I thought it sounded like the stuff I had as a little girl, but it was pretty dry.  Lots of reviewers mention adding some type of soup to the mix, but that is not this recipe, there are others on the site that do include the soup in their ingredients.  I kind of wish I had tried them.  I also was intrigued by the reviewer who melted her cheese with the broccoli in the microwave and then put it in the over.  I wanted broccoli casserole with no soup, so I will try that and perhaps it will turn out better for me. Thanks.

It was ok, but kind of boring and a little dry.  Next time I will try using a creamy soup mixed in or something.  And maybe more crackers on top.

I used 2 16 oz bags of california mixed vegetables and a can of cream of onion soup when preparing this recipe for a church function and it turned out beautifully.  Everyone raved over the dish.  I only came home with a cup full of leftovers, which tasted great the next day for lunch.  Thanks for recipe.  I will definitely make this again.

"The best broccoli I have ever had"  That was the review I got last night at a large family dinner.  The menu has been changed for Thanksgiving to inculde this as the veggie of choice.

I have made this recipe per the instructions at least a dozens times now and it is a big hit with our family dinners.  I have found that even the little ones will eat it because of the crunchy topping and the cheese... they really don't think about the broccoli. Super easy and delicious!

I used fresh broccoli and sauted onions.  I added the broccoli to the onions at the very end of the saute.  I decided to lighten it up and use low fat grated cheese.  It was not as rich but still tasty.

I read a lot of reviews which were very helpful. I scaled this down and used one, good-sized fresh broccoli flowerette which I cut into smaller pieces and steamed for 2 min in the microwave and drained. I melted 1/4 cup of butter and added half to the broccoli along with 3 slices of Velveeta cheese slices cut into ~1" pieces. I mixed the rest of the butter  in with the crackers, along with some garlic powder. I placed the broccoli mixture in a 1.5 qt oblong casserole dish and topped with 2 more slices of cut up Velveeta. Then topped that with the crumbs. I checked at 20 min, and it was already browning and seemed to be done. I like that this did not have rice or canned soup in it. So easy to make, and a perfect broccoli side dish! RILEIGH74 for this great recipe!

My family ask me to make this on a regular basis.  I use fresh broccoli, steam it in the microwave in the bag for 3 minutes.  Then, I set the broccoli on a paper towel to dry it.  I mix mild cheddar cheese with the processed cheese.  I mix the crushed Ritz  crackers with the broccoli and cheeses on stove top in small pot, until melted and gooey.  Melt the butter, put the broccoli mixture in a safety oven bowl.  Put more crushed Ritz crackers on top, pour the butter over it and put it in the oven to bake.  It taste better the next day to me.  My family likes it more than I do.

I am not sure if I cooked the cracker topping long enough, but, that seemed to really detract from the flavor of cheesy broccoli..I would just omit that next time.

Perfect and super easy.  Placed in buttered casserole 9x13.  Did add a little milk before I added the buttered Townhouse cracker crumb topping.  Super easy.  I steamed fresh broccoli, and used steams as well.  Family favorite!

Great casserole. I used a package of broccoli and a package of cauliflower, increased the recipe to 10 servings and my family loved it for Thanksgiving. I will use again for regular meals.

This was good. I can only say it was a little to salty for my liking. Salt content is important when you feed children, you may want to substitute the condensed mushroom soup to a low sodium version or cut the amount in half and select a lower sodium cheese at the market.

I am giving this a 4 star rating even though my version was a 2.  It was my own dumb fault.  I used sharp cheddar cheese instead of processed cheese food (like Velvetta).  The cheddar did not melt the same way and the dish ended up too dry.  I will try this one again using the proper ingredients and I am sure it will rate at least the 4 I gave it.

My mom has always made this recipe for traditional holiday dinners, and I have started making it too.   It is always a huge hit, and always a little embarrassing when people say, "mmmmmm what is in this???"  We use Velveeta cheese and always lightly steam the FRESH broccoli before baking.  I also cut the cheese into cubes and drop it in with the broccoli.  Careful not to add too much cheese or steam the broccoli too long, otherwise, you get a velveeta mush (the opposite of dry, as other reviews seem to have experienced), which is actually quite gross.

Needed a lot of help. Basically was just cheese and broccoli with a crunchy topping.

Made the recipe as directed, but couldn't eat it.  The crackers were overpowering and the cheese was a little runny.  There is nothing I like more than broccoli and cheese.  Unfortunately, this is not the recipe for me.  On a good note, but brother liked it enough to take home all the leftovers (which was practically the whole dish).

My family loved this. I didn't add the butter or crackers though. I thawed the broccoli, then topped it with velveeta shredded cheese. I baked it for 20 minutes. Will make again.

This was good, I used a shredded cheddar and colby jack mix. I didn't use as much cheese or butter as called for but it was still very good. Actually I used Olivio spread and it worked great. My only complaint was the broccoli was a little dried out on top. I used fresh broccoli which I steamed in the microwave for 2 minutes before I put everything together. Next time I will probably steam it longer to get it nice and soft.

This recipe was pretty good but I think the processed cheese was a little too overpowering.  I'm wondering if this can be made with just regular shredded cheese.

My family really enjoyed this recipe. I only had 16oz frozen broccoli pkg and about 6 oz of velveeta cheese on hand but it did not seem to matter. This recipe is a keeper.

I defrosted and drained the broccoli, to cut down on the cooking time. I also used Ragu cheese sauce. Delicious!

Excellent recipe!  I made it for a dinner party.  Many people asked for the recipe. I used 2 glass pyrex dishes, making it one layer. I used  about 3 oz of velveta cheese (cubed) so it would be creamy.  I top it with about 1/3 cup of sharp cheddar cheese (use more if you like more cheese).  I topped with the cracker mixture.Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Definitely a little dry but might be better with a little tweaking.  Next time I'm going to try and layer the cheese throughout the casserole instead of just putting it on top.

Made this for Christmas dinner. I think it was a little dry. Next time I will use less cracker crumbs and maybe mix in half a can of cheese or cream of broccoli soup. However, everyone seemed to gobble it up...:)
