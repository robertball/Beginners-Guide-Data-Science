Healthy quick snack. I literally use all of my  Halloween pumpkins so nothing goes to waste. Scooping the seeds out and using them as a healthy snack works well. The recipe was quick and easy and the seeds came out delicious. I made them as  hot and spicy roasted pumpkin seeds adding  a little Cayenne Pepper, Chili Pepper, Cinnamon, Nutmeg, and Ginger. I used a few drops of Tabasco sauce instead of Frank's.
