Who knew making homemade butter is so easy!  I made this and homemade bread with my 5 year old granddaughter and it was a fun, delicious and interesting learning experience.  She learned how cows give us milk and cream which can be made into whipped cream, ice cream, butter and cheese.  We took half the butter and added honey and cinnamon, which was also delicious.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks!

This recipe is easy. Stupid easy. I mean, "For Dummies" easy...and it tastes so good. There is nothing like this fresh taste on your pancakes on a Saturday morning. Using a Kitchen Aid (Classic), it took 6 minutes on high to get butter. I draped a dish towel around the head to catch any splatter. Squeezing out the excess buttermilk is not as difficult as I had expected.  I put the butter ball in an ice bowl a couple of times, but not for 20 minutes, it didn't need it. Once transferred into a container, with a rubber spatula, I was able to squeeze out a few more drops of buttermilk. A 500ml bottle of heavy cream gave me about one cup of butter. I used the buttermilk (although not cultured, it's still tasty) in my pancake batter then topped them with the fresh butter. A little stack of heaven on a plate! For the leftover butter, I mixed in some fresh herbs/spices and froze it in silicone ice trays for later use. Thank you for this recipe.

Making butter is easy and fun.  This version is very good. Be sure to squeeze out all the liquid as if left in it will turn the butter rancid. Run under cold water and squeeze hard.  The liquid that remains is a NON cultured buttermilk. It will not perform like cultured buttermilk but you can use it to make other things like bread or add it to soup.  This is also fun to make with kids!

So easy and fun.  It took a little longer than 10 minutes for me.  I will definitely make this again.
