8.13.14   I baked this bread in three 6”x3-1/2” mini loaf pans for 40 minutes, and ended up with some of the best banana bread I’ve ever had, moist and just loaded with flavor. Although the banana flavor is dominant, the peach flavor is subtle. In the future, I will add some chopped peach to the batter to see if that will elevate the peach flavor.

I made a double batch of this bread and baked it as mini loaves.  My oven must be on the hot side because some of the loaves got a little too brown on the outside.
The only change I made was to substitute a cup of the flour with coconut flour. (If you're only making a single batch you would sub. 1/2 c of coconut flour. )
I'm giving it four stars, because I'm not sure if the suggestion of baking mini loaves at 350 was right. Next time I will bake them for 35 min at 340 degrees.

If your using fresh or frozen peaches, you may want to try heating them up in a pot on the stove, add some orange zest and lemon zest, some fresh squeezed or frozen concentrated orange juice and some apple juice to boost up the flavor of the peaches.  i know that when Welches makes their peach juice, they add apple juice to bring out the flavor of the peaches.  Everyone knows that when you put fruit and vegetables on direct or indirect heat they release their natural sugars making them sweeter and stronger.  It worked for me.  Oh yes! I also cooked the bananas with it too to release more of the sweetness in the bananas.  This bread was heavenly.  I will be making this again real soon.

Absolutely phenomenal!! I was looking for a banana bread because I've wanted to try to make some for a while. I love the banana and peaches together, never would have thought of it. I ended up dicing the peach instead, and it came out wonderful! Very moist and flavorful

I always make a double recipe of this bread!  My daughter and I absolutely love it, and is one of her favorite surprises when she comes home from school.

Very good recipe!  I did substitute the large fresh peach for the canned peaches I had on hand, though I rinsed them thoroughly.  Also, I split the recipe into the 9x5 pan and two 4in rounds and they cooked well, though the rounds were done cooking before the pan, of course.

I made this one today. Love love the taste! I thought the cake will dry, but I was wrong. It's so moist and taste great. I change the flour to whole wheat flour.  Also I reduced the white sugar to 1/2 (I don't like sweet stuff). I also used 1-lbs frozen peach into the blender, but I use half of diced fresh peach mix with the mixture. Definitely will make more.

This is a really awesome recipe for even just banana bread. I didn't blend the peaches, but instead I cut them and folded them into the final batter. Great consistency!

Used two peaches and 2 bananas because that's all I had. This is perfect if you need to get rid of overly ripe peaches and bananas.   Excellent flavor..
