Not bad.....not fantastic but not bad.   the sauce is a little sweet and a little tangy....tried it over both rice and pasta.  The rice is MUCH better.

Pretty good recipe.  I altered some things based on the reviews.  Used 3 Tbs brown sugar instead of 2 Tbs white, used tomato sauce instead of ketchup, kosher salt instead of table salt and served over wild and brown rice.  I would also mix up the ingredients prior to adding it to the meat.

Followed recipe exactly. Fantastic, even the kids came back for seconds. But you have to serve over rice.

I have to admit I was sceptical about this recipe, but decided it was quick. I am so glad I tried it! I made it with extra lean ground beef and doubled the sauce, and served with whole wheat spiral pasta and salad. Everyone loved it and the best part was the time it took to prepare. Definitely a keeper.

Awesome sloppy joe recipe.  Will never buy another can or mix again.  I added a beef bouillon cube instead of salt, brown sugar instead of white, and threw all the ingrediants in the crockpot.  I used cubed beef rather than ground beef.  It made an amazing sandwich.  Try it, you won't be disappointed.

YUM!  Both my son and husband loved this one.  I did some substitutions.  Instead of white vinegar, I used rice vinegar.  Didn't have fresh onion so I sprinkled about of 1 TBS of dry minced onion.  Also, per husbands trial tasting, I added 2 TBS brown sugar (he likes it sweet).  Also, to thin it a touch, without watering the flavor down, I added about 1/3 cup ruby red grapefruit juice.
I served this on egg noodles, will try rice next time.  This would make excellent sloppy joes!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used stew meat for this dish only because I could not get stir fry meat.  My family liked this dish but I found it a little too sweet. I will fix again but will find a way to lesson the sweetness.

This was the first recipe I made and reviewed when I joined All Recipes in 2003!  I made this again recently and as I did before - I made the sauce first and let it sit, while I cooked the meat.  I used 1 lb. of beef that was pre-cut for stir-fry and served on crusty rolls (not pasta - this is the key!!).  It was even better now!!  I love this recipe!!!!! Simple and delicious!!

Didn't care for it that much. It was too tangy and too sweet for my taste.

I loved this recipe, I used stew beef, used brown sugar and Heinz Chilli sauce, and rice instead of pasta.  It was delicious, everyone raved about it and i will definitely used this recipe again.

Made it over rice for my 5 and 7 yr old daughters, who like many different foods.  It was a bit too tangy for them, and neither one ate more than 5 bites.

Not great...Not horrible.  Honestly it tasted more like sloppy joe meat over rice.  If you're looking for a good sloppy joe recipe, this one would work!

This was edible, but not great.  It is basically beef, with homemade BBQ sauce, on pasta.  No one in my family enjoyed it, but there wasn't anything drastically wrong with it.

Like Judy G., we used a poor cut of meat.  The sauce was quite tasty – enough that we’d try this again w/ either ground meat or another cut of beef cubes.  We did substitute Splenda in place of sugar.  Instead of serving over pasta, we selected mashed potatoes.

Recipe was simple to make.  The flavor reminded me of a sloppy joe with the ketchup and mustard base.  It was too spicy-hot for my 8-year-old.

I liked this recipe.  15 minutes start to finish so it would be a great busy night dinner.  We ate it like a sloppy joe on a bun with cheese.  I thought the sauce was pretty darn good!  I think it would be delish with beef cubes over egg noodles.  Thanks for the fast and tastey dinner.

The sauce was very nice and tasty but I used a poor cut of meat I think.  Rinsed it off and gave the meat to the dogs.  Can't wait to try it with ground turkey, though!  I know it's going to be awesome!  And yes!  All the ingredients were in my cupboard!

Really like this and so does my guy.  Only changes were tomato sauce instead of ketchup and hate onions so I added in carrots after the sauce was simmering. Def a new quick fav of ours.

My family and I really enjoyed this meal. I added a can of black beans which I rinsed and drained before adding to the pan.
We did serve with couscous instead of noodles/rice at the request of my children. We will definately make this again.

This is a favorite recipe in my house.  I double everything but the onion(because I use large onions) and serve it over buttered noodles.  Everyone loves it.

This recipe was easy and tasty.  Def.  the best over rice.  Also, I ran out of ketchup so I used fresh cut-up tomatoes and it worked great!  I will definitely make again!!!

Tasted like sloppy joe meat. Nice flavor. Recipe doesn't say what to do with the pasta, so we just cooked it and served the meat on top.

I made this with the hamburger and served it on a bun--sloppy joe style-- to a bunch of picky kids and they loved it.  Now I make it regularly.  Thanks for sharing!

Even my picky eater couldn't get enough of this! I used Dijon mustard because that's all I had on hand, but it was delicious so I will keep using that and recommend you use it too. So good! I honestly didn't think any of us would like it as much as we did! (Also used turkey burger because that is what I normally buy.)

This recipe is pretty good and easy to make. Great if you have leftover meat to use. I added half tablespoon of honey, half tablespoon of liquid smoke. I seasoned the meat with meat tenderizer, salt, pepper and GrillMates applewood rub. If you simmer it long enough, the meat  gets really tasty from the sauce. I also added minced garlic while cooking the onions. Definitely needed more seasoning/flavors.

Just made this and it was pretty good. I adjusted the serving size for two and used less sugar than it called for and added a bit more ketchup.

The sauce itself isn't bad. The best I can explain it is like a spicy-tangy taste. I used pork cubes and steak, doubled the sauce with a little less ketchup, and served it over egg noodles. Very quick and easy. It tasted better on the pork, and I was surprised I had all the ingrediants on-hand. Thanks

this was really yummy and very simple to make.  i added green peppers and mushrooms and simmered the stew meat for about an hour in the sauce.  i served it over rice and it was a big hit w/ all the family.  definately a keeper.  thanks for sharing.

Tasted like meat with ketchup.  I drained the sauce, rinsed the meat, and made something else.

This was very tasty and one you can add your own spices to, so to please anyone whether they like spicey or not. I actually made this with deer meat and worked very well.

What an awesome recipe!  My husband and I both enjoyed it!  Loved the tangy sauce!  Just one word of caution...don't overcook the stew meat as it gets too tough (common sense).  Enjoy this wonderful recipe!

Delicious for the whole family!  I added mushrooms for a little more texture and served over rice.  We loved the tangy flavor.  It was very quick and easy to make.

This recipe tasted great!  I didn't have any onions so I just reconstituted onion flakes and then followed recipe as directed.  I forgot to add the ketchup so the sauce evaporated quickly.  I added 6 tablespoons of water.  I like the idea of doubling the sauce and I will try that next time I make it.  I served this over white rice and it was delicious.

I was put off by not having a specific cooking time but was glad it turned out okay. I made it with stew meat and served it with white rice, my family liked it.

This was really fast. One suggestion is trying it on a hamburgar bun. Pretty close to something like a sloppy joe. Still it was good with pasta.
