My wife made this against my will. Looked horrible. Well I was wrong and it was great. We're both on a nice calorie counting diet and this fit right in. And it tasted great too! I have about 40lbs. of Cod in my freezer from our honeymoon fishing trip and this fits right in! Definitely something to keep.

We prepped on foil and made a foil package to cook on the grill.  20 min was perfect! We served it with a spinach, romaine, fennel and cucumber salad with vinagrette, and red Quinoa for the starch.  Outstanding!

I've made this twice now and it's delicious -- especially for a recipe so simple and healthy. It even impressed my chef husband.

It's unclear how much fish is a "portion". Using 4 oz portions, getting the vegetables to fit on the fish was a challenge!

I substituted vinegar for the lime juice and omitted the lemon - citrus allergy, and added some epazote and cilantro. The "juice" was delicious!

made this 3 times now, twice without the tomatoes. Super moist, Corvina is a wonderful whitefish that is mild.

Mine turned out delicious but I changed the recipe - I used lemon juice instead of sliced lemons.  I also added sliced zucchini and sliced yellow squash because I wanted more veggies with it.

I wanted this,to be good but it turned out with no flavor at all. I think the fish I used was not right for this.

Made this in an effort to make a healthy meal. It was healthy alright, but we didn't enjoy it. Bland! Will not make again.
