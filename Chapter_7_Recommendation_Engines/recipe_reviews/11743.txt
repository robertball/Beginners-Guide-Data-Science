To add a little more flavor, you may want to first saute the garlic with red pepper flakes in a tsp of olive oil/butter, then add another tsp of oil and the flour to make the roux mixture.  Let this cook for a minute, then add the milk.  Stir over a low flame (milk boils over in a second!) and as it thickens up, season with salt, lots of pepper and add some NUTMEG to add that special twist.

This recipe turned our horrible!  I followed the scant directions exactly.  The area where my husband and I had trouble was with the sauce.  Should you boil it, turn the heat off, let it sit an hour to thicken???  So it became a big soupy mess that even 1.5 cups of parmesan  cheese couldn't solve.  It was a big soupy mess with 2 cups of liquid in the bowl!  I looked up a recipe and it says to use HEAVY CREAM (it'll turn out much thicker, not soupy), and it says what to do with your burners as well.  F- is my rating for this recipe.  

I usually like all recipes but I don't agree with the positive reviews here!!

This was easy and delicious!  I used soy milk because that is all I had and it turned out great!  I thought it might be too spicy with the hot sauce added but it wasn't, couldn't even taste it.  Next time I will add more.  I added ground black pepper, salt and shrimp.

This is a basic recipe which in my opinion must be tweaked.   What I did was 4 1/2 tablespoons of butter as stated.  While it was melting, I added one clove of garlic which I grated on a zester. I also added one teaspoon of hot red pepper flakes.  I let this cook in the melting butter.  I then added the flour but it was not enough.  Ended up with 3 1/2 table spoons of flour.  Then added the milk (actually used one percent)  After whisking and cooking for a while, added the cheese.  At least a cup (I was grating right into the sauce)  Added much needed salt and pepper.  (taste after the cheese because parm is salty)   It came out wonderful and after I poured this on the fettuccine, I added fresh parsley.   Ok it was dried. Raining so didnt want to go pick it.  The sauce had just enough bite.  Next time I am going to add chicken and broccoli.  Maybe Ill try olive oil instead of butter.   Definitly a winner.

This is a simple, classic recipe and an old standby that I can play with depending upon what I have in my pantry. I followed one suggestion and sauteed the garlic and red pepper flakes before adding an extra bit of olive oil and the flour, and making the roux. Then I added the butter (I used soy margarine) and stirred, and then the milk (I used skim) and stirred. I brought the mixture just to a boil (and as suggested, watch it carefully! milk boils fast!) to incorporate the oil (beforehand, the oil had been floating on top...) before adding the Parmesan (and I used plain ol' powdered Kraft in the can, and I'm not sure I even had 1/2 C). I tasted as I went, and the red pepper flakes gave it a lovely zing so I omitted the hot sauce. Mine was more grainy than "velvety" (probably because of the powdered Parm) but it thickened nicely. I used it over 2 packages of fresh ravioli, broccoli flowerettes and salad shrimp. Lovely!

I was looking for an economical version of Alfredo sauce to prepare for a large reception.  I made this to test it, and I am impressed.  This is delicious!  I will make this often!

My nephew is a huge lover of crab, so I always pick up the 'imitation crab' as a treat for him.  Recently, he grew tired of eating it by itself, so I went in search of a recipe to incorporate his crab in.  THIS ONE IS AWESOME!!  An eleven year old picky child scarfed it down!  I only added 6 ounces (which equated to 98cents worth of the stuff) of the crab and whala!  He had so much that his stomach began to hurt, lol:).  Thanks Jane!!  Just a quick note, this was the most inexpensive dish I've ever made and it is so sought after by adults when you 'go out'.  This one is a keeper.

I made this for lunch just now for my father and sister. It was very good. And I'm a slow cook, and I got it done in 15-20 minutes, from the time I started getting everything together until it was on the plate. I'm glad I found a recipe that is really easy and doesn't take much time... And it wasn't even lumpy (I cannot make gravy)!!! Next time I will add some more seasoning, like Oregano and Parsely...

I have to say I was very disappointed by this recipe. I did everything to a "T" and it came out rotten. I ended up cracking open a jar of premade fettuccine sauce and adding it to it to thicken it up.. I was really trying to avoid it.

I agree with the negative review, however, I substituted milk with heavy cream and it came out wonderful.  Heavy cream added thickness and taste. Without it, the sauce is sad.

this way not very good.  It resembled paper mache paste.  It lacked flavor, and was just not very good at all.

This recipe is great for an alfredo. I really like that it doesn't require any type of cream, because that means I always have the ingredients to make it and don't have to buy anything special. And it is creamy and delicious! I will probably never use another recipe for alfredo, and this was my first one!

I am on Weight Watchers PointsPlus so for one serving I halved everything and substituted nonfat milk and Country Crock spread (with calcium). With a half cup of pasta, and a cut up chicken thigh, this recipe comes in at 9 points, under the Points Plus system. Don't forget to add a nice portion of sauteed broccoli and mushroom since veggies don't have PlusPoints!

fantastic, cheap and easy recipe. I added mushrooms in with the butter to soften before adding the other ingredients, and I used fresh crushed garlic and cheddar cheese instead of parmesan. Well liked by everyone!

Not bad! Just needs a little more salt and parmesan cheese to make it restaurant good! We doubled the recipe and used it for 2 lbs of pasta.

This recipe was very good and super easy!  It took less time to make the sauce then it did to boil the noodles.  It was a little thick, but it may have been that it simmered too long while I waited for the noodles to finish.

Absolutely fabulous - tons of flavor and not too many calories for an alfredo sauce!  I deleted the pepper sauce and have used both linguine noodles and fettuccini noodles with this recipe - both are wonderful.  Garlic french bread + this recipe is a perfect and Quick meal!

Wonderful recipe!  I followed it almost exactly but sauteed the garlic first as others suggested...really infuses a bit more garlic flavor that way.  I omitted hot sauce.  Also mixed in about 1/3 C. cream with the milk.  I also noticed the sauce needs a decent amount of SALT to help bring out the flavor.  I can't believe how easy this was!  I was really craving fettucini alfredo but had no idea such an easy recipe could taste so much like what you get in a restaurant.  Well done!

This is a pretty good recipe to use as a base, and add to it. This is what I did: In a saucepan, I sauteed some freshly minced garlic, fresh basil, a dash of salt, and some crushed pepper in olive oil. After a few minutes, I poured it into a cup and set it aside. I then made the roux with 4 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp water. I added the cup's contents, the milk, cheese, and then made a bit more of flour and water (probably 1/4 c. flour made into a somewhat viscous liquid, to thicken it up even more, but this can be remedied with more milk if it's way too thick). I let it bubble a bit, then simmered for about 15-20 minutes. While it was simmering, I added more fresh basil, pepper, garlic, salt and even more cheese, because you can never have enough of all of these flavors. This is pretty versatile, because you can make it as strong or mild as you want without really screwing it up. The sauce was flavorful, thick, and went well with whole wheat pasta noodles.

This was great. I used evaporated milk and heavy cream with the regular milk when I tried it(low on milk at the time).

Also added a dash of nutmeg to enhance the cream. Used olive oil in place of the butter for that authentic flavor.

As I had no fresh garlic(and I'm not good at prepping it), I used garlic salt.

A quick way to add vegetables to this dish is to boil them along with the pasta(used peas when I tried it). I added roasted chicken to the sauce: yum.

The next time I use this recipe, I'm trying garlic powder--that will do a better job of replacing the minced garlic than the salt did for me. And I definitely recommend cream, but that's my personal preference.

This was a good recipe if you don't have cream to make the sauce. It needed more flavor though and to be thicker so I added a bit of stuff. But it was a great starter recipe

Good. Simple. Quick.  Just what i was looking for.  It was a bit bland, but i can see how this is more of a base recipe.  A great starting point.

Very easy. Just make sure you boil it after adding the ingredients. I also added 2 tsp. of corn starch to thicken it up (before boiling) and added italian seasoning and pepper.

This was good but not memorable. I added a lot more cheese than called for and white pepper for some more flavor -- but it's a good basic sauce to start with

Mmmmmmm...I made this for "family meal" at the French Culinary Institute where I work and it was super!  I used cream instead of milk : )  The tobasco adds a great little kick...yumm!  Just a tip...this can't be re-heated or the sauce seperates, so serve immediately!  I topped it with Cajun seasoned, grilled chx breasts and everyone raved...thanks for this recipe!!

Excellent simple recipe.  I doubled the amount of cheese because I love parmesan cheese, and I added a little nutmeg and pepper.  I also left out the hot sauce because I'm a wimp...but it really hits the spot and isn't nearly as unhealthy as fettucine alfredo from a restaurant.

This was pretty good! Not restaurant quality- but very good for a quick fix with things that I always have on hand. I sauteed the butter and flour for just a minute together before adding the milk (whisking it the whole time so I didn't have any lumps in my sauce). I also added garlic salt and LOTS of freshly ground black pepper since some reviewers found the sauce bland. And, I used probably 3/4 C. or 1 C. parmesan cheese. I will definitely make this again.

This was a wonderful, easy recipe for Fettuccini Alfredo!  My husband absolutely loved it, and I thought it was great as well!  Our suggestions:  We also started out by sautéing the garlic in butter before adding the flour.  We halved the recipe (made it for two) and added a little less butter and more milk until we got the consistency we wanted.    This helped to thin out the sauce (it started out a bit thick for our taste) and also cut down on the fat a bit!  We grilled some boneless skinless chicken breasts and chopped them into strips and added those to the pasta after the noodles had already been coated with the sauce (there is not a ton of sauce and if you add the chicken first, they will soak up all the sauce and leave none for the noodles!).  This was a very, very simple recipe and I highly recommend it!

This is the easiest alfredo sauce I've ever tried.  I must admit I was a bit wary of doing this from scratch, worried about botching it up...but other than underestimating how long it would take to be ready it was wonderful.  When they say turn on your noodles to boil at the same time you start the sauce, they mean it.  The sauce is ready in 15 minutes.  I made it for five people the first time, I'm making it for just me tonight.  It's so flexible and easy for any occasion.  This is definitely one I've raved about at work and to friends, working in a retail grocery chain, we always have recipes to pass to each other, and this one has found it's way to so many people since I made it.  Thank you so much for posting it here!

My guy and I made this together, and not only did we have a lot of fun grating the cheese and making the sauce, but he thought it was delicious.  We made it with chicken pieces, cooked in butter and garlic, and my guy said it would have been great with garlic bread.  Great recipe!!

It is great for a base. I usually don't go to websites for things like this, however, I did not have heavy cream, which is usually what I use when I make Alfredo pasta or any cream based pasta sauce at that, so I was looking so I could use milk and have it thick enough. I tweaked it, I not only used parmesan but added 4 slices of bree cheese, and added 1 tablespoon of marinara sauce. Instead of "hot sauce" which didn't sound so wonderful to me, I used Cayenne pepper and chili and crushed fresh garlic... it turned out amazing. I also sautéed green onion in the butter prior to adding the rest of the ingredients.

I had to add about a tablespoon extra of flour.  Very plain so I added garlic salt, table salt, pepper, and parsley flakes.  After said and done, my picky eater that is an Olive Garden lover, really liked it.  2 Thumbs up.  I will definitely make again.

This was super easy and quick to prepare. I switched a few things though to make it a bit healthier. I subbed the milk with almond milk, butter with ghee, salt with sea salt, parm with organic parm, and a gluten organic flour mix verses regular flour. I was looking for a simple and quick recipe that I could play with and this was it! I also used fresh garlic instead of jar. It came out super yummy!!

When I made this, it tasted like flour! I did everything right! But to add more flavor I added some salt, more garlic, and more butter. My sauce was thick and it looked so so good! But when I tried it, it was gross!

This is not the richest or creamiest alfredo out there.  However, being void of the ingredients that normally contribute to richness (heavy cream and/or cream cheese) this is lower in fat, calories and thus healthier.  It is good, not remarkable.  Its perfect for when dinner sneaks up on you and you have little time and few ingredients to work with.  Its quick and easy to make (my 14 year old son made this and he has very little cooking experience.  Basically if you are looking for a fantastic tasting alfredo, this is not it, if you are looking for a quick, satifying, easy meal...give it a try.

Wow, this was a great sauce! It is simple to make and uses very few ingredients. I was looking for an alfredo sauce recipe that did not call for cream or half 'n' half, because I did not have any. This recipe was perfect; simple, easy, quick, and versatile. I will definitely be using it in the future.---Oh, I added some sauteed smoked sausage to the sauce after it was finished cooking and put it all over angel hair pasta--fantastic!! The hubby and guest loved it.

i followed the recipe as written but it wouldnt thicken for me until i made a paste with some flour and some of the sauce. i made sure to cook it long enough after adding it so it wouldnt taste like raw flour. i did add some frozen peas and some cooked and crumbled bacon.

I tried this recipe recently when I felt like some Alfredo pasta, but didn't have any heavy cream to make my usual Alfredo sauce.  This was a pretty good alternative.  Feel free to add more hot sauce!

This was great! I needed a recipe for school for a fund raiser. This was so easy to make and it was delicious. I tripled the recipe and held the sauce in a crock pot on Low.  We then ladled the sauce over Pasta with either Pasta or Broiled Scallops.  I first tried this recipe at home for Chicken Alfredo. Because my husband has lactose problems, I substituted Soy Milk. This recipe was so quick, easy and simple, I will add it to my bag of tricks when I need a quick meal.  For a quick dinner idea, purchase a deli cooked chicken. Cook the Fettuccini Alfredo and stir in cubed cooked chicken. Add a side green salad to balance out the meal.

Wow, I was pleasantly surprised at how well this turned out.  It was really easy, although you have to make sure that while it is thickening you keep stirring/whisking the bottom of the saucepan so that it doesn't get lumpy--which can get a little bit tricky if you are juggling boiling pasta, a grilling chicken breast, and the sauce!  It only got four stars because it was a little on the bland side for my taste, but I will definitely make it again and just experiment a little bit to liven it up.

Excellent sauce!!! I was a little skeptical of the hot sauce but it added some excellent flavor and was not overly noticeable.  I didn't have any minced garlic so I used some garlic salt and added a little pepper too.  Also, used shredded parmesan cheese instead of grated and it took a while to melt but it was well worth it.

This recipe was good but a little bland for my taste so I doubled the garlic and added a little black pepper and red pepper flakes. It took a while to thicken, maybe because I was using skim milk?

This was really tasty. It caught my eye because I was looking for an alfredo sauce without heavy cream (because I didn't have any in the house). I added chicken and spinach and increased the amount of cheese. I won't increase it as much next time though.

I made this alfredo and my whole family absolutely loved it!!!  I did make a couple of changes...  I added a chopped red pepper that I sauteed for a few minutes(until it was tender), instead of adding hot sauce.  I also used heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  The sauce was velvety thick and delicious.  Wonderful.  I will make it againg and again...

I love this!
I was a little skeptical tasting it but the flavors really good! I love garlic so I added lots more and more cheese. I might have used a cup instead of a half.
Also, I left the hot sauce out and added shrimp and mushrooms.
What a great meal! I can't wait to share the leftovers with the people I work with that live in the dorms. They'll love it!

This wasn't bad.  I added some defrosted cooked shrimp to the sauce at the end, just to heat it up.  I also chose to put hot pepper sauce & crushed red pepper on the table, to be added if someone wanted it, instead of adding it to the sauce during cooking.  I liked the crushed red pepper better.  I wonder if a little sherry might have enhanced the taste.  Even though this was a lower calorie version (as it doesn't use cream, half-and-half, or cream cheese), I probably won't make it again as my husband doesn't like rich foods that much.

Absolutely delicious!  Recipe makes far more sauce than is needed for only 8oz. of pasta. And it was slightly bland so I added garlic salt -- turned out great!

The sauce will thicken if you add the milk a little at a time, then whisk. Using half of this recipe on half a box of fettuccine worked great for our family of four.  Also added broccoli and shrimp to make a full meal.

I like this recipe. It was easy to make. I had all the ingredients because it called for flour and milk instead of heavy cream. This is my first time making Fettuccine Alfredo. I was happy that it was so easy and it turned out and tasted good.

Awesome way to make quick alfredo. I did everything to a T until I added parm. I just added enough to my liking. I also added a little pepper and nutmeg. (thanks Rachel Ray!). Lastly, I added a tablespoon or 2 of marinara to make it pink sauce. Was delicious!

This is a very good basic recipe for beginners ! You can build with it by tweaking it and adding spices. I also used a wee bit more flour than the recipe said. I used a head of garlic and cooked it in the butter before adding flour - added pepper, paprika and salt to the milk then mixed it in. I cooked chicken in a bit of minced garlic - also made broccoli. I mix everything together - throw into a casserole dish and add mozzarella cheese! Amazing!

I omitted the cheese because I didn't have any on hand, and I didn't put any hot sauce in there either, and it turned out so good! I should've let the garlic cook a little longer in the butter before adding the flour, but other than that, super easy to make. Making it again this week!

This is a great recipe for alfredo! The only changes I made were only putting in 3 drops of hot sauce and I added fresh minced parsley in with the milk. It was delicious and my whole family loved it. I will definitely make it again.

First time making alfredo sauce and this came out amazing.  Lacking slightly in directions though - in Step 2 I brought the milk to a boil to get it to start thickening, only after scrolling through these reviews to figure that out.  It took about 15 min of boiling and whisking frequently to see it start to thicken, then I sprinkled in the parm cheese a little at a time but quickly (in about 4 batches).  I doubled up on the hot sauce (10 drops) and still was barely able to taste it, also, I added salt and 1 teaspoon of dried onion.   I threw the sauce on bow tie pasta (12 oz) , 8 oz frozen peas, and smoked turkey kielbasa.  Stirred it all together.  Awesome.

My changes: I sautéed extra minced garlic, finely chopped onions (about 1/3 cup) and red pepper flakes in the butter until they were fragrant. Then I put the flour, 1.5 tablespoons, slowly and stirring constantly. Added about a cup of white wine into this and let that cook for a minute. Then about a cup of 2% milk. All the liquids were added slowly and the mix was constantly stirred. The taste of the wine was significant so I let it heat under low heat for a while before adding half cup Parmesan cheese. At this point I added garlic salt and fresh cracked black pepper. Kept stirring and added some milk to get to preferred consistency.

This is a great recipe for when you're craving Alfredo, but don't have any of the special ingredients most recipes call for, like heavy cream or cream cheese. It was really easy and had simple ingredients that I always have on hand. The only thing I changed was added salt to taste. Keep in mind the sauce thickens a lot after its removed from the heat. I let mine simmer for about a minute before I took it off the heat.

The instructions for the sauce were perfect, but it's very bland (even with sautéed garlic as others have suggested). I added Italian seasoning, salt, pepper, used cayenne instead of hot sauce and used an Italian blend of cheese instead of just parmesan.

I halved all ingredients, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. It was easy and delicious! Definitely a keeper (and no more alfredo in a jar from the store)
A pointer for others... Bring the milk mixture just to a soft boil, and simmer until fairly thick, mine took about 15 minutes. Slowly stir in the parmesan a little at a time.

Just made this! Absolutely delicious. Instead of heavy cream I had to use single cream as my heavy cream expired (yuck). I also added a bit of garlic and it turned out delicious! Family loved the surprise pasta dinner! I also added  some chicken and chorizo! Great success!

This is good in a pinch if you don't have cream on hand.  It definitely needs salt, and maybe slightly less flour.  I left out the hot pepper sauce and sauted red pepper flakes with the garlic.  It didn't have much pizazz so next time will use the sauce and see what happens.  I also added some leftover imitation crab from sushi night and made a seafood alfredo.  It was a hit

This was great - simple to make and delicious! I used crushed red pepper instead of hot sauce, and I added canned peas at the end. Definitely will make again!

I really enjoyed how easy  this recipe was. I left out the hot sauce. Also I split the parmesan cheese and half and used mozzarella cheese for the other half. I felt this made the sauce a little thicker. I also used the recipe for good easy garlic chicken to make the chicken a little spicier!

I'm a college student with not much time on my hands, and this recipe was perfect for that! I did doctor the recipe a little bit because the sauce was too bland. I recommend using a little garlic powder, salt, seasoning salt, and pepper throughout to give it some more flavor. Other than that it was great! I served it with steamed broccoli and garlic bread. Everybody who ate it loved it! Thanks!

This recipe is great.  I made it this weekend for my boyfriend and he ate almost the entire thing.  It's definitely a keeper!

I did add more garlic and some basil at the end.  Also, I added cooked chicken breast.  It was great!

Very simple recipe, I found this really easy to make. I added extra garlic and extra cheese. I also added some mixed herbs. 
I will definitely be making this again as my boyfriend absolutely loved it.

Excellent texture to the sauce. Bland flavor and took a lot to spice it up. I added shrimp and peas and left out the hot sauce. I also added more flour to my likings of thickness. Will be excellent once I figure out how to give it maximum flavor w/ spices.

Didn't see the need for the flour as the parm (which I at least tripled) made the sauce nice and thick. Loved the idea of the hot sauce. I made the alfredo the night before and just heated it up when the pasta was close to being done. Great recipe that went wonderfully with our marsala. Thanks!

My family really liked this recipie.  I didn't add the hot sauce but instead I added about a tablespoon of cream cheese, along with my grilled chicken that I seasoned heavily with pepper.  It was a very simple dish to make and I know I'll be making it again many more times in the future.

This alfredo sauce is perfect for families...my kids liked it because of its mild flavor, and my husband and I spiced it up for ourselves.  I added cooked ham and peas to make a great, quick dinner.  Thanks for sharing this recipe, Jane!

I changed the recipe a bit by using garlic powder instead of crushed garlic and it was great !!  I also used left over ham from Thanksgiving and asparagus both in bite size pieces and my husband and I both loved it !! I also skipped the hot sauce and added a little more cheese.
Thanks for an easy dinner !!!
