This is good, but very, very sweet.  Next time I make it, I will cut the sugar in the crust to 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup.  Also, the crust was extremely hard to roll out, so I chilled it for 1 hour and it made it much easier to handle.  I also gave the crust and lattice top an egg wash to help it brown.  It worked beautifully!

This was not at all what I expected, but an extremely pleasant surprise. It's more like a giant buttery cookie than it is like pastry. I filled it with a combination of raspberry pastry filling and peach perseveres, and it was delicious.

Instead of putting the crust into a dish, I simply rolled it out, on a silicone mat, into a huge circle. I laid out my filling, leaving a lip of around a third of the dough, and then I folded up the edges to make it look like a rustic crostata. Mine took longer to bake, an extra 10 minutes, but it was well worth the wait. Next time, I'll put more filling towards the edges.

I think this cookie/crust is full of possibilities. Next time out, I'll fill it with homemade applesauce. It's made for experimentation.

Easy to make delicious to devour. I did alter the filling with ricotta,melted dark chocolate, Kalua, & pine nuts. Half cup ricotta cheese, 2 squares or melted chocolate (in dbl boiler), 3tbs of Kalua, 1/4 cup chopped pinenuts. Bake 325F for 35 to 40 min. & let cool. I would make sure the crust isn't too thick 1/8in.

Good but very sweet for my taste. I halfed the sugar in the pastry. I still felt it was too sweet. I read someone's review which said they added ricotta cheese. I might try that next time. Pastry was really hard to roll out so I ended up pressing it into the dish. I would let it chill next time. However it looked amazing, and pastry had a lovely texture when cooked.
