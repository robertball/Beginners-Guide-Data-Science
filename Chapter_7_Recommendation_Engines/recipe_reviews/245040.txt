Very simple recipe.  Easy for a quick baked item to add to breakfast.

I had bread flour, so I added some baking soda and before I put in the oven I brushed on egg white with a sprinkle of course sugar .

The flavor was good which is why I gave the scones a 2 instead of a 1, but, the texture was terrible.   They were very sponge like and chewy.  I also thought the dough was stickier than I typically find with scone dough.
