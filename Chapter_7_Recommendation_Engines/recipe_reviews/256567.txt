My rating is based solely on the crust. It is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly but cooked it a little differently. I used chopped pecans, but put them in the food processor anyway and chopped until the pieces were pretty small, but not floury. I placed cupcake liners in the muffin pans and patted down the crust mixture into the bottom of the liner. I probably used a little less than a tablespoon per liner. There was plenty to make 24 individual cheesecakes. I cooked them at the same temperature, but added a few minutes to the time. For the cheesecake part I used the old recipe that has vanilla wafers as a crust except I used half a teaspoon vanilla and half a teaspoon lemon extract (got the idea from this recipe). I also used dairy free cream cheese. People could not believe that it was a gluten free, dairy free dessert because it was so good.

These were easy and delicious.  They looked great too.  I put some cherries on top of half and then put on the whipped cream.  I will make these again.  The recipe made about 24 cheesecakes.

Delicious!  Made mine in cupcake wrappers.  Added a strawberry sauce on top just before serving.  The crust was awesome!  Held together without crumbling.  Used 1 tablespoon per cupcake wrapper and made 24.

For someone whoâ€™s had trouble with Gluten Free and cheesecake recipes, these turned out great! I agree that they can be served to the whole crowd. I am not a GF person, but my son is. We both loved these. I finally put a thermometer in my oven, and found that it runs hot, so I adjusted accordingly. The only other changes I made was that I omitted the lemon, and used cupcake liners. We put a few strawberries on top and they were truly delicious. Thank you for the recipe, especially the crust!

Big hit at the dinner party! Both cheesecake and crust were yummy.  But they needed a little something on top. I made  a lemon glaze, and drizzled over the top. Could also do another cheesecake like topping to make it colorful
