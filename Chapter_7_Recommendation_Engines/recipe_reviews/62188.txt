VERY very good. I suggest you use fresh orange juice as I did. Awesome. Very citrus-y and refreshing. I think I have a new favorite drink!

Good but not great. This combination makes a strong and citrus"ey" drink and something was too much making it a little bitter (I think the Cointreau). Not sure how I would adjust but a sugar rim would compliment this drink well.
