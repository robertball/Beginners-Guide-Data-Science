I've been in search of a great potato salad recipe for a long time now, and finally found it! I made a few changes - cut the sugar in half (was a little too sweet), diced celery to give a little "crunch", and finally, inspired by the fabulous potato salad sold at my local gourmet market, added a little shredded carrot for both color and taste. I brought it to a picnic this weekend and the salad received rave reviews from everyone.

This was tasty.  Made a couple of modifications~ I left the skins on the red potatoes (simmered for about 15 mins.); used about 1/2 of the sugar called for; and added celery, pickle relish, shredded carrots, a few bacon bits & topped with hard-boiled eggs.  The dressing was really good though - the ground mustard added a nice "kick".  As other reviews have suggested, definetly make this ahead of time so the dressing can meld.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is great and has even gone down well with people who claim not to like potato salad.  I made it exactly as described and will definitely make it again!

Well Patricia you have accomplished what I've been trying to do for the past 5 years.  When I was little and visited my grandmother in Greenpoint, Brooklyn she served a potato salad from a local deli that I just LOVED.  I've never forgotten the taste.  I've been trying for years to duplicate it and never even came close - your invention is a match!!  I couldn't believe it - it nearly brought tears to my eyes.  Talk about comfort food!  Happily when my guy tasted it he loved it too.  Thanks so much Patricia - All Recipes Rocks!!!!

This is a really great recipe.  I live in Morocco in the country so it's hard to find sour cream.  I always substitute natural unsweetened yogurt.  It's healthier and tastes great.  I used 1 cup mayo and 1 1/2 cups yogurt.  So good!

k, just finished making this salad. Obviously it hasn't sat long enough like suggested for best flavor. But let me tell you, I couldn't stop "testing" it as I was mixing it all together. YUM! I tried really hard to follow the recipe as written so I could give it a true rating. I didn't have parsley on hand, but did have only one boiled egg I threw in along with a hand full of crumbled bacon from the bag along with a little chopped celery... No surprise for a potato salad I know, but my secret weapon was a handful of "matchstick carrots" that I recently purchased at the grocery store and hadn't used yet. That gave it a nice crunch and some nice added color.But what I really liked about the recipe was the dressing. I mean anyone can add mayo to a salad and call it good. I always have. But this dressing was a nice punch of flavor. I divided the mayo with half plain lowfat yougut and half mayo. I think I need another spoon full of salad right now. YUM,YUM,YUM.

This was just too creamy for us, though the creaminess did settle down a bit the next day. The flavor was pretty good, but I feel it called for too much mayo/sour cream. Next time, I might add the sauce a little at a time until the potatoes are coated, not just all at once.

The potato salad was delicious!  This is the first time I have made potato salad.  I made a few changes to the recipe as I did not have everything it called for.  I used minced onion, yellow mustard (a good squirt) and dried parsley.  I also used about 1/8 cup each of vinegar and sugar.  I added 3 hard boiled eggs chopped up.  It was very good.  My husband loved it.  I will definitely make this again!  I served it with BBQ chicken breasts.  A great tasting dinner.

The recipe author was right about it tasting better after being refrigerated! Next time I make it I will do so a day or two in advance. It was great served a few hours after making it, and we got lots of compliments when we served it Labor Day, but I thought it definitely got even better after 2 days in the 'fridge! Thanks!

This turned out fantastic! I used half the sugar as others advised and I also added celery and a few hard boiled eggs.. I forgot to pick up the parsley but I will try it with it next time. Next time I think I will use half the mustard powder (turned out pretty zingy) and will use green onion instead, if your red onion is strong it will way overpower the salad so I would add a little bit at a time, I ended up sifting through and trying to pick some out, unfortunately my red onion was a bit too strong. Great base recipe that you can throw in any favourite additions you might have.

Followed recipe to a T. I didn't have time to do it all the day before so I put all of the dressing ingredients together the night before so the flavors had time to get right. The next evening all I did was boiled the potatoes, cooled and cubed and added dressing. It was SO GOOD! Kept getting compliments so very, very happy with recipe. This will be the only potato salad recipe I use from now on. Thanks for sharing!

Absolutely delicious!  It was a bit runny so I would suggest adding the sauce in a little at a time until potatoes are well coated but it did "firm up" a bit as it sat in the refrigerator.  I did add some hard boiled eggs, garlic powder, and pepper but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Excellent job Pat- thank you for sharing!

Very tasty and creamy.  I will only add half the amount of sugar next time I make this though.  I used about 2 T of dried parsley as I didn't have fresh.

This is really good and creamy. Pretty much followed the recipe with the addition of celery and a bit less parsley and sugar. The dry mustard adds a nice bite to it so if you don't like hot, try adding a little less to start with. I will probably add a bit of celery seed and some chives and basil because they are still growing.

Chives and lemon thyme this time.

This is a fantastic recipe! It has everything in terms of flavour, it's a tad sweet, there is a little heat from the mustard and it has a lovely creaminess. I did make a few changes though. I used creme fraiche in place of the sour cream and added a bit of chopped celery. I also made the recipe only a few hours before serving, so I added the dressing and the onions to the chopped potatoes, while still quite warm. This made quite a difference, as the flavour was able to permeate, with little time to do it.

this is the best potato salad i've ever made!  i made some minor changes and additions, but the base recipe was pretty much the same.  i was making a batch for two, so i just kinda winged it with the amounts, trying to keep the ratios similar.  i used regular white potatoes, because that is what i had, and didn't use sour cream because i didn't have it.  added boiled eggs and carrots, as well as chopped dill pickles.  seriously fabulous!  i bet with the sour cream it would be freaking amazing...

The dressing is good.  The dried mustard adds a nice zing.  Not crazy about that much parsley as it was a bit overpowering.  I will use the dressing again.

Some potato salads are too mustard-y; some are too relish-y.  This one is creamy and slightly sweet with just a hint of tangy-ness.  My family of seven gave it a unanimous 5 stars!  Of course you can add or delete the extras like onion, carrot, egg, celery, etc.  but wow, the dressing on this potato salad is Summer's Potato Salad Standard.  Great Job Patricia!

I used yogurt and cut down the mayo in this recipe. My fiance likes chopped apples in his potato salad so I did that and it gave it a nice sweetness. I've also never used regular onions in potato salad and used scallions (spring onions) instead. All in all a good recipe, pretty basic really and a crowd pleaser.

My only complaint is that it is to sweet. I would go with 1 Tblspn of sugar instead of 3.  Other than that - a very good salad

I have been trying to find a good potato salad recipe forever...THIS IS IT! Made it for my son's b-day party and it was fabulous. I thought the dressing was a tad too sweet for my taste, so I added a few dashes of celery salt to even out the sweetness. Added diced green pepper for crunch, 1/2 onion-grated and 3 grated whole hard boiled eggs. A definite keeper!

10-18-11: Has a nice aftertaste,; an excellent potato salad.  Trying to follow the prorated directions for a 1/2 batch produced about three times the necessary dressing.
2-11-13: Still good, but this time I added too much mustard.

Six.  I asked my fiancé for his rating on this potato salad, one - five, and he said six.  Not sure I would say six, but five for sure.  The flavor is very mild.  I think this would be a good choice with an entrée that’s spicy.  I didn’t really taste the mustard, but I’m sure it added some depth to the otherwise mayo-vinegar-sugar, with sour cream, dressing.  Next time I would make this a full day ahead, instead of just a few hours, as it was even better at lunch the next day.  Also might add celery.

This turned out so yummy.. I didnt have quite as many red potatoes, so I also used some white potatoes.. I did use  3 or 4 more potatoes than called for since the sauce makes a lot, and there was still quite a bit of extra sauce.. 

It is a tad bit spicy with all that ground mustard.. If you dont want it spicy cut the ground mustard down by half. 

Thanks for a yummy potato salad

A good basic potato salad. I reduced the sugar to 2 teaspoons as my family doesn't like salads that are too sweet. The recipe doesn't say what type of vinegar to use so I used cider vinegar.

Turned out sooo good.  Didn't like larger chunks of fresh parsley, so I would use dried flakes, also for ease of use.. I recommend to make this the night before and stir well before serving. Sooo yummy!

This was a good recipe but you have to tinker with the sauce you mix in with the potatoes-there was WAY too much so I chose to throw some out.  I also added egg, bacon bits, and some celery seeds and I'm glad I did. I think it would have been a bit boring without it.

Great recipe to make the day before your guests come.  It was a hit and our guests mentioned that they liked that it differed  from typical potato salads!  I added celery for crunch.

This potato salad is fantastic! I made it for a dinner with guests and it was a huge hit. I didn't even use fresh parsley--I used dried--and I know fresh would be even better. I used a garlic mustard b/c that's all I had. Definitely it make the day before you plan to serve it.

I just made this and took it too a bbq and everyone LOVED this recipe.  I've finally found the potato salad recipe I've been looking for! I kept the skin on the potatoes and added boiled eggs and turkey bacon just before refrigerating.  Turns out I used cilantro instead of parsley, but it was still the most talked about dish at the bbq.

Followed dressing pretty closely and used what was "on hand" to save a several mile trip to town and the grocery store.  Used yukon golds and baby reds cooked separately til done.  Had a small red onion and added a small sweet white onion.  Subbed cider vinegar for the plain vinegar and omitted the parsley.  Did add celery and thinly sliced carrot pieces too.  Salted as I went along adding the solids and didn't add salt to the dressing.  Added two tsps milk to dressing to thin it slightly; it still clung to the potatoes and veggies perfectly.  It was a hit with all the adults at our friends' get-together bbq!

I make this all the time (using red potatoes and keeping the skins on).  I always add celery seed, but it can easily be customized with whatever other flavors you like!

Just finished making this...followed the recipe with the exception adding 4 hard boiled eggs and some celery. Never used ground mustard before so I limited the mustard to 3 teaspoons. This potato salad tastes wonderful and I'm sure it will taste better after it's been refrigerated. Thank you for sharing!!!

Wow...absolutely wonderful.  I love the taste and I like that it is a bit different from the traditional egg, mustard and mayo recipes.  My family does not like onions so I left them out but added some onion powder.  This recipe will be used over and over at my house. A+ on this recipe!

I don't normally like potato salad since I'm not at all into eggs.  This was delicious!  I have never made something for a picnic that had everyone asking for the recipe.  This was a huge hit!  I made it just as written and it turned out fantastic!  I suggest making it the night before since it does taste tons better when the flavors have had time to mesh and get cold.  It has a unique vinegar taste that is very oniony but AWESOME!  I had very little left but my step-dad and husband were arguing who got to take the left overs home!

I have been trying forever to find a great potato salad. Lots of good recipes out there, but with Pat's recipe I have found the one that tickles my fancy.  It's the dressing.  I made half a recipe and went light on the vinegar. (I also only made a half recipe of the salad.) I used a good sherry vinegar.  That was the only change I made to the dressing.  The ground mustard does deliver a zing so ease up on that if you like a milder dressing.  I like the zing. For the salad I used the combination I usually use except I don't usually add onion.  Liked the addition of the onions.  Potatoes, celery, hard cooked eggs, sweet pickle and some roasted red pepper (just to use it up really but it a very pretty addition) completed the dish.  Again, it's the dressing that makes this a winner for me.

A bit too sweet for us but other wise the flavors were good together.  Probably will make again as a base with half the sugar and add some herbs...

This was not as good as other potato salads I've made.  Was a bit bland to me.  I made this and several other dishes for a party and this potato salad was the only thing that I had left over.

I am very picky about potato salad but I loved this one. The only thing I would change is I would cut back a little on the mustard, it was a little too spicy. Still great!

This was good, but it seemed to be lacking something. A little blah to me, I guess. I brought it to a potluck and everyone seemed to like it. I noticed a couple take seconds of just this, so I know it must have been good overall.

Very yummy!  I liked the flavor of the salad and that it was a bit sweet.  I made the mistake of not cutting the fresh parsley small enough, and next time I'll probably just use dried parsley.

I made this recipe for a BBQ for my friends and they couldn't stop asking me about it. I added 2 eggs, and added a little bit of other herbs, but stayed with the recipe 99% of the way.  A definite staple for any BBQ of mine now!

This is a great recipe.  The mustard adds a nice ending to it.  My 9 year old wasn't a big fan (everything is too hot for him), but the rest of us loved it!  Thanks for sharing!
