I loved this for the simplicity and flavor.  We were out tarragon so I used lemon pepper seasoning in place of it and the pepper.  I used raw sesame seeds which toasted perfectly in the broiler.   This could possibly be my "go to" fish recipe.

This was delicious and so easy!  I used fresh tarragon instead of dried, which really added to the flavor.  Will be making this one again!

I melted the butter, and added the rest of the sauce ingredients, and allowed it to sit for an hour or so, pan sauteed the cod a couple of minutes on each side, drizzling with the butter mixture, then placing a lid on top to let it finish cooking with the built up steam. Turned out wonderful, great flavor, very moist. I'm guessing the broiler would work too, although I would be paying close attention to the heat. Nothing worse than overcooked fish.

i didnt think the tarragon was good here. it didnt fit the flavor profile and it isnt meant to be "broiled".  i will try again omitting the tarragon as I feel the sesame seed/butter/lemon combo was good.

The lime & tarragon really brighten this fish up. It was quick & simple to prepare with ingredients already on hand. My husband is not a fish lover, but said he would eat this again.

Did not turn out well broiling. The top was burned and the rest was undercooked after 10 min. What I would do next time is prepair the fish like the recipe says but bake it at 350 until white and flakes easily.

super easy. i didn't have tarragon, but i bet it would be delicious. i kind of want to put shoyu on it instead of butter/lemon/tarragon. good as is, but probably could experiment with flavors.

This has got to be one of the best fish recipes I have tried. I didn't quite follow the recipe 100% but I did use all of the ingredients. I am not a fish person nor do i like to cook fish because i normally can't stand the smell but i could barely taste the fish in this. My 6 year old daughter ate every last bit of hers & so did I without grimacing one bit. I will definately be using this recipe again. I also didn't have any issues with broiling it. Given i did have to do it for longer than 10 minutes but it still came out great. So quick & easy to make. I haven't been this satisfied with a meal in a very long time.

took me twice as long as needed to cook and was very bland! Not even feeling the need to try this again.

I LOVED the method of preparation... 10 minutes in the oven and fish was ready to eat... MARVELOUS!!!  It's bland so it definitively needs some salt and/or spicing up.  The beauty of this recipe is that it's versatile and a fantastic starting point... you can really use any/all spice mixture. I"m exciting to make this again with different spice blends (and pinch of salt).

I tried this out. The fish was okay, but the sesame seeds gave it an odd taste to me. Maybe I didn't toast them long enough, I'm not sure. We ate it but I probably won't be making it again.

I failed to assure the fish fillets were of equal thickness. I had one that was twice as thick as the others. It took much longer to cook through and that resulted in the thinner pieces being overcooked. Make sure the fish pieces are of equal thickness. I think 3/8" to 1/2" thick would be optimum.

This came out all right, though it looked nothing like it did in the photo. I didn't have any tarragon on hand--fresh or dried--so I skipped it. It tasted real well without it and was delicious for a 7 minute broil.  I would make it again.

Sooo good! I didn’t have the spice, but I just replaced it with lemon pepper and it came out tasting wonderful. More importantly, my 4 year old devoured yet and kept on asking for more! I will definitely make this dish again!

I didn't have any dried tarragon but I've made it with dried fennel and this was very tasty. I've also tried it with fresh dill. Yum. It is also good to toast the sesame seeds first.

For all of the flavorful ingredients, I was extremely disappointed by how bland the fish was.  I normally try to offer suggestions or ideas to improve when I find something I don't care for, but we couldn't come up with a way to fix it.  Will not make again.

Fast, needs more flavor. Would recommend stronger herb with the cod.
