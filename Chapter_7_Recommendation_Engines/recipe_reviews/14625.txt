THIS WAS PRETTY GOOD. I USUALLY MAKE HOT DIPS, SO A CHILLED DIP WAS A LITTLE BIT OF A CHANGE. I ALSO ADDED RED ONION AND A FEW JALAPENOS, PLUS I MIXED A PKG OF TACO MIX INTO THE GROUND BEEF.

This is good...I mean you can't really mess this one up. I am a spicy dip girl, so added some jalapano peppers to give it some heat.  It does end up looking alot like a taco salad, but who doesn't like those anyway.  Thanks for a new snack.

Loved this one! Super simple! I did however add some taco seasoning to the meat. I got a lot of compliments.

Great Idea, i made this as a single healthy snack for myself. I just used 1oz Fat Free Sour Cream and 5oz Salsa and 4oz of crumbled 95% Lean Ground Beef and 1/2oz shreaded 75% Cabot Cheese. I mixed that all together and used it as a dip for lettuce leafs. 

Thanks for the idea.

This was really soupy so I reduced the meat / salsa mixture much longer than the 10 minutes stated.  We tasted the meat once chilled and didn't really like it so we warmed it up a bit in the microwave and then proceeded with the recipe as written.  It could use some olives, green onions as a garnish.  This has been waiting for a picture for at least 13 years.
