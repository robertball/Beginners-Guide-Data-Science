Oh my goodness!  This is the easiest and tastiest shrimp scampi type pasta I've ever had!  I cannot believe how little effort this elegant dish took!  I only changed a few things about this recipe: 1) I used a gourmet garlic-infused extra virgin olive oil instead of grilling the garlic in oil.  2) Also 6 tablespoons seems a bit much...that's more than 1/3 cup of oil for pasta for 2 people.  I reduced to 4 tablespoons (or 1/4 cup) for the amount of pasta suggested and it came out great.  3) I added the drained pasta directly to the sauting shrimp in the large skillet.  (You have to have a very large skillet...which I did.)  And 4) You should taste the pasta after you mixed it with the oil.  I found that I needed to add a little bit (1 teaspoon or so) of garlic salt to kick up the flavor.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Mmmmmmm yummy!

Instead of using 8oz pasta I used a full pound of thin spaghetti.  I made the sauce with 8 tbsp EVOO, half a stick of butter, juice of 2 lemons, 4 cloves garlic minced, and 1 tsp crushed red pepper.  I added about 1 1/2 lbs pre-cooked frozen shrimp to the sauce.  but I forgot the parsley! so I am giving this 4 stars because I changed it alot.  

Thanks so much for the recipie idea it was simple and tasty

Really good; I agree with using less oil (4 tablespoons are enough). I added one diced avocado and 2 cups of shrimp as opposed to the prawns and 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar; yum!

I cut the oil to a third, and added 1 tablespoon of butter (less likely to burn and enhances the flavor of the shrimp). I ended up doubling the amount of shrimp because we loved the flavor.

I thought this recipe was pretty good.. My husband didnt like the flavor with the olive oil.  I think if it was made with butter it would taste great!  I'm going to try it next time.

WOW!  This was REALLY good!  I only used 4 TBSP of oil, per another review, and I was glad I did that!  I also added several cloves of garlic, but my husband and I are garlic freaks....the more the better, for us at least!  This was super-easy to make and it was DELICIOUS!  Even my toddler loved it!  Definitely will be making this over and over again!  Thanks for the delicious/easy recipe!!!

I didn't use prawns in this recipe. I just wanted a nice flavourful, seasoned pasta recipe, and this looked good to me. Turned out it was! Seeing as I'm not a seafood fan, I served this with chicken instead. Very tasty!

My whole family loved this and I found it very easy to prepare. I did however halve the amount of oil and found this to be more than enough.

Had this for dinner tonight, and it was very good.  I added fresh mushrooms, red bell peppers and green bell peppers to the shrimp.  I think it would have been boring without these additions.  I also substituted angel hair pasta (my favorite) for the suggested pasta.

I bought really large prawns so they took over twice as long as the recipe states but otherwise it was a good dish. I added meat from king crab legs to the pasta as well and it turned out very good!

I just made this and the aroma is making me salivate... I cant wait for my husband to come home so we can have dinner... I did add more garlic than stated and less oil.. but I did add some milk... this gave a creamy coat to the pasta. Hope this helps someone.

Wow, this was awesome! I followed the recipe, however used half the oil but added a bit of butter. I also marinated the prawns/shrimp in "Basil Shrimp" recipe on here before starting (use less dijon). This was wonderful and I wouldn't hesitate to make it for company! Even my husband loved it! Thank you!

This was so easy and so good. I took some of the other reviewers advice and reduced the olive oil to 4 Tbsp.  I also thought it  needed some color so I added sliced green peppers at the same time as the prawns.

I took the cheap option and used small frozen cooked prawns, but added a nice dollop of very dry vermouth (noilly prat) to the the pan before adding the pasta.  Very cheap and very tasty, this has been added to my regular weeknight meals list.  Thanks for the inspiration!

I love this recipeIt's great as it is but can easily adapted too. My kids don't like prawns much so I make this and put half in a tub in the fridge. Next day it's delicious as a cold pasta salad for lunch. Also, a quick chamge I sometimes make to this is after draining the pasta and returning to the pan, stir in a coule of handfuls of fresh rocket or watercress. Stir in and return the lid to the pan then continue with the recipe instuctions. It adds a bit of colour and is delicious. Thanks for this easy recipe!

i made this last night for dinner and it was excellent.. i did 5 tbsp of olive oil and 1 tbsp of butter, added more shrimp and 2 extra cloves of garlic. boiled some extra noodles and cheesed it till it was cheesy enough for me.. also i sprinkled a tiny bit of garlic salt in it because some people commented that it was bland.. it came out perfect.. i was bragging about it not even 10 minutes after i finished eating.. will definitely be making this one again

This was excellent and delicious and I will make it again and again for my boyfriend and I.  However, I did alter it according to other reviews... I used 2 T EVOO and 2 T melted butter instead of 6 T of oil, around 1/2 C of fresh chopped parsely instead of only 1 teaspoon, 3 cloves of fresh chopped garlic, 1 full cup of shredded Parmesan cheese, and 1/2 lb of precooked frozen shrimp.  Delish!

This was simple and fast, but as others as noted, it needs a little somethin' somethin'.  I added red pepper flakes which improved it.  The garlic taste was hardly noticeable, so I'd suggest adding a couple of more cloves.

this was really good. i didn't really expect much because there wasn't alot to it. but the taste was great. i did add a few cloves of garlic because i love garlic and a little more olive oil because it seemed a little dry, but that was it. it just goes to show that you don't need alot of ingredients in a dish to make it good. simple, but elegant is what i have to say about this. thanks for the recipe.

Very delicious idea for a pasta... only change is I first fried up a bit of zucchini for a while, then threw in the shrimp and lots of garlic. the resultant sauce was really tasty. after boiling mini shell macaroni, i stirred it in the pan with the sauce.

This was dry and really tastless. The recipe is bad unless you add something to spice it up.

Very good. I did made some modifications. I added some green onions to the sauted garlic and lemon juice. I served on top of linguine. Yummy and light.

This was good.  I used small shrimp. Claudia suggested I use lemon zest to deepen the flavor. Also, I used too much pasta (spaghetti noodles)

If I could give this any less of a rating I would, the pasta wasn't good with these ingredients. I was able to use the shrimp and whip up something else.

The prawns were delicious but the pasta was very bland.  The recipe has potential but the sauce is missing something key.

Boring. Too much oil. Why throw out the garlic? Easy to make, yes, easy to eat.
