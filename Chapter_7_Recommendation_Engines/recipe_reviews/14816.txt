I made this for a baby shower,and it was a Hit! It is so easy and can be made the night before and then heated when needed.  For a party, make a double batch.  Great with crackers or toasted baquette slices. 

The recipe references 3 green onions, but doesn't say whether to sprinkle on top or incorporate into the dip.  I stirred them into the dip, and they added color and flavor.

This spread was a hit at the holiday gathering.  It stayed fairly creamy, even as it cooled, and did not separate.  I thought my swiss cheese was not very flavorful, so I added a dash of seasoned salt.  Also added more almonds.  I can also envision adding dried cranberries.  Very good, will make again!

I have made this for a number of parties in the last few months and it has been a BIG hit.  I have been asked to make it again but this time to double the recipe.  The only thing I changed was that I added a dash of salt.  Fabulous!!

This recipe had a lovely flavor ... but it was so thick and gloppy it could hardly be removed from the bowl ... and spreading on crackers was not easy.  If I make this again, I will spread it on toasted baguette slices while it is still hot.

If you heat too long the cheese gets very stringy and the oil separates.

Excellent flavor but sets very quickly as it cools.  This needs to be kept over a heat source so that you can spread it.  You may want to toast the almonds in the microwave before hand as I did not find the cooking time long enough to properly toast the nuts.

Excellent taste and the almonds add a wonderful crunch...perhaps, a little cayenne would work too!

Always good for a party.   You can add some garlic powder as well.   I use a small oblong glass pan to heat it in.

I made this for the first time this morning and brought it into work to share, and everybody loves it! I stuck it in a crockpot to keep it warm and it's been a total sucess! Everyone has the recipe now and can't wait to share it with their family.

This is the appetizer you want when you are trying to come up with something "different." It comes out in such large glops that you may wish to double the recipe. I will the next time I make it. Down the road, I will experiment with dried cranberries or diced bacon, as others have suggested. The flavor, though wonderful, is not pronounced. Adding these other ingredients may elevate the flavor another notch or two.

I needed a quick starter for a dinner party and tried this one. It was quite the hit. The boys at the party LOVED it ! I used a garlic bread and a variety of cracker's to serve with it. It was gone in no time! Note that I did not use the recommended amount of cheese, I only used half of that and it was still fantastic!

I first came across this recipe about 10 years ago, when one of my father's coworker's shared it with him...  It has been one of my favorites ever since, only I could never remember the exact amounts.  I am so happy to have found it on here, and now I will never lose it again.

I could not get enough of this dip. One guest asked for the recipe and made it the next weekend at his own gathering and it was gone quickly.   I suggest doubling the recipe as it doesn't make very much.

Delicious. I halved the recipe and baked it in a small oven-safe bowl. As a group of four, we knocked it out pretty fast. I served it with french bread slices toasted in the oven. I will use this one again!!

This recipe was so great.  I took it to a Bunco group party tonight where there are ALOT of great cooks.  I served it with crisp crostini.  This was gone in around 20 minutes.  Great taste and I would not muddy up the flavors with bacon, or anything else.  My opinion only.  thanks

Not very exciting- sorry!  This was just a bland, cheesy dish without much zip.  Perhaps if you added a bunch more nutmeg or other spices to add to the "depth" of the taste.  I don't know how to make it better but my Superbowl crew weren't fans of it.

Seemed like the cheeze didn't melt evenly, so it was stringy. Still, pretty good.

I have made this many, many times since getting the recipe.  It is always delicious and a hit with everyone who tries it.  So easy to make, too.  I have used regular onions when I didn't have green onions and it works fine.  I have served with all types of crackers and never had a complaint.  This is really a good "go to" dip for parties or unexpected company.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

This dip is so flavorful and easy to make! I used a mix of swiss and gruyere cheese. I'm a huge fan of the green onion in this recipe. I served it with Club crackers.

This was more than a 3 and 1/2 than a four... but with some minor changes i think this could easily be a five... though I am not sure what changes I could make. It was good... but nothing I would write home about. I love cheese and nuts, but together, the texture was a little off. I am planning on playing around with this combo because I think this could be really good.

This recipe was a big hit at Christmas.  My grocery store didn't have shredded swiss, so I used sliced swiss and broke it up into smaller pieces.  Everything melted together nicely in the oven and turned out really well.

I have been using this recipe for years...got it from a magazine ad. To solve the problems listed above: the original recipe called for 3 tablespoons (equals about 1) green onion, and ONE CUP of grated swiss cheese -- this will eliminate the density/over cheesiness.  (One liquid cup equals 8 FLUID ounces, but for solids, like the cheese, use JUST ONE CUP of the cheese...I also toast the almonds lightly before hand and mix 1/2 of them into the dip before baking, then garnish with the rest.

I was also confused by "where to put the onions" so I added them in while mixing thanks to another review.  After I baked this I put this into my small crockpot to keep it warm while I transported it to a dinner party.  It was fabulous and disapeared!  I think I will add crumbled bacon and jalepenos next round.  THIS IS A NEW FAVORITE!

I prepared this recipe for my Cooking Club when our subject was Appetizers.  It was the biggest hit of the evening.  I served it with sliced crusty bread.  This was so easy to make and extremely delicious.  I will always make this for parties and such from now on! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Everyone loved it - I have made it several times.  
However, What I don't like about it is when it is baked it starts to "swim" in oil. What is causing this?  Is there a way to reduce this?
Thanks

Good, but a bit too sharp for my taste. Might need a less sharp swiss or maybe half and half swiss and white american.

Only change I make is that I use white onion instead of green.  And this is terrific!  A New Year's Eve tradition at my house.

This is my "go to" appetizer when I need something yummy and easy.  The flavor combination of swiss cheese and almonds is wonderful, and this dip is always one of the first of the empty dishes on the appetizer table.  I serve it with Wheat Thins or any other similar cracker.

I wanted a new dip for a SuperBowl party at work, so decided to try this one.  Made it the night before and reheated in the microwave for a few minutes while we were setting up the other food items. I wasn't sure that it would be that good the next day, but as soon as I set it out my coworkers converged on it, and I swear they devoured it in about 5 minutes!  Everyone asked what was in it.

Fun for a casual party because the cheese gets really gooey.  I like to grate my own nutmeg and it's usually pretty strong, but I barely noticed it so will add more nutmeg and pepper next time.  Also a coworker suggested adding crabmeat, yum!

This went over really well at a recent holiday party I attended...great with Ritz crackers. Definitely will make it again.
