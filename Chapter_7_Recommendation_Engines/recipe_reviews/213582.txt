VERY RICH! Yummy, but way too sweet.  I think I would leave out the sugar in the bottom layer next time.  Also, I didn't have semi sweet chocolate for the top layer, so I used milk chocolate.  If I used the semi sweet, it may have been better. Make sure if you try this you have a cup of coffee or glass of milk with it to balance out the sweetness.  My husband tasted it and told me not to give it to the kids (that's how sweet it is).//// Had to add another star and more to the review.  Just took this to a friends house for a birthday party and they loved it.  They compared the richness to fudge.  My husband is not a big sweets eater, but for those of us ladies who love our chocolate, this is a nice treat to eat a little at a time.
