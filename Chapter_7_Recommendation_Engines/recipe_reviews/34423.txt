This was an okay recipe but I put mine in a crockpot for eight hours and then shed with two forks and pour the BBQ sauce over and mix. This way you just walk away from it.

I make the roast and serve it as such, then use the left overs for the sandwiches. I make my own sauce as well but the idea is brilliant for left overs even chicken and beef.

This recipe turned out pretty good.  My husband even loved it.  He said it was good even without the bbq sauce, but then again he's not a fan of it.  This will only be the way I'll cook bbq pork from now on, especially because I don't own a smoker.

followed almost exactly. I trimmed alll the visible fat, slow cooked it for 8 hours, then pan fried it in a little of its own fat , then I added S.B.rays bbq sauce.  Delicioso!

So yummy.  I've made this several times and made it for my mom who kow makes it for other people as well!  Always a big hit!  We only use Sweet Baby Ray's after trying to use a brand we got on sale of BBQ sauce and not nearly as good.

This was delicious.  I didn't grill it at the end and used a spice rub at the beginning. I also added some liquid smoke to my bottled BBQ sauce.

This was REALLY good,use a good quality barbecue sauce! Also if you break the roast up into big pieces before grilling you will get more grilled meat edges which adds to the flavor!

I bought my hubby a smoker for Dads' Day, and he smoked some nice thick pork chops for a 4th party. During the week I sliced the leftover pork nice and thin and then cooked it with the barbeque sauce and served it with onion rolls. So simple and absolutely delicious. Thanks!

I used my slow cooker for this and skipped the grill. I used a Memphis style barbecue sauce and topped mine with coleslaw and made this Southern style. This was easy and delicious. The flavor will vary though according to the sauce you use, so do use your favorite for best results.

Thank you for sharing your recipe.  I made a few modifications. 1) I used about a 5lb. pork butt seasoned it with garlic powder, ground cumin, Mrs. Dash garlic and herb. 2) cooked it in a slow cooker for about 4 hrs. then took it out and preheated the oven for 400 degrees.  I pulled the pork with two forks and sliced some of the bigger pieces in a 9 X 13 pan. 3) added some Sweet Ray Sweet & Spicy Bar-B-Q-Sauce over the sliced/pulled pork and covered it with aluminum foil for 30 mins. at 400 degrees. The last 5 mins. of baking, it was uncovered and served with french hamburger rolls along with mac n cheese.  My husband said it was delicious and it was yummy too :)  The aroma of the pork cooking in the slow cooker was yummy too ;)

Needed something quick that used the left over pork roast. To shorten the time I just layed out the tortillas, topped with cut up pork roast, BBQ sauce and shredded Mexican Cheese (I'm not a big onion fan), rolled them up and put into the microwave for two minutes. They came out very tasty and definitely different than our previous two days of leftovers! I will be making these again.

Good idea, but next time I will grill fresh meat on a slow charcoal grill, off to the side of the grill to prevent burning (I don't have a smoker) for 20 minutes or so on each side, after some Lawry's seasoning. Then take it off and put it in the oven or slow cooker with bbq and garlic powder. Grilling first should take care of the outer fat, and keep the meat moist.

1st time, I put in slow cooker on High for 4 hours, then pulled meat, covered in sauce and seasoning (Mrs Dash, ground cumin, garlic powder), and put in 9X13 casserole dish--covered with foil--into oven @ 400*F (preheated) for 30 minutes, then uncovered for 5 more minutes. Was delish, but pulling the meat was difficult. 2nd time, after in slow cooker on High for 4 hours, I left in slow cooker on Warm for 1 hour. This made pulling the meat much easier. However, I liked the chunkiness I got the 1st time, so next time I'll do something in-between or not pull so thoroughly.

Used Kirin beer. Time was perfect for the meat to fall off the bones. Wasn't blown away by the flavor to merit 5 stars, maybe checkout some spice variations.
