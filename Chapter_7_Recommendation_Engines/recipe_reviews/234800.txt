Kids loved this one. Doubled the ingredients just for extras after dinner and my kids and husband almost ate it all. I did not add Peppers but did put in the diced tomatoes

Last night, I made it exactly like the recipe. It's all gone. The kids liked it so much, they asked me to make it again tonight. The only difference will be that I'm using a can of fire roasted tomatoes and Cajun style smoked sausage.... Gotta kick it up a notch!

Made this, only changed the sausage to regular breakfast sausage versus the sausage with casings.  Easy and Yummy!

I put more velveeta cheese in it because I know my dear husband loves cheese. Me and my son don t like it maybe because we are not fan of sausage. Next time I ll make it again but replace sausage with chicken or

I made this tonight and I thought it was pretty good. I followed the recipe pretty much as stated except I used rotini pasta and omitted the green pepper. (I wanted to use a bigger noodle and I don't like green peppers). Very filling. I'll probably make it again.
