Made these as directed, but dipped only half in the white chocolate, and the balance in milk chocolate. They are very tasty. It was a little difficult to get them into nicely shaped round balls, but not a big deal. I'm testing freezing these (as I'd like to put them away for Thanksgiving). I'll report back on the results once my test is complete. UPDATE (11/28/19): Took these out of the freezer to serve with dinner tonight. They thawed out beautifully, and the chocolate did not turn white in the freezer, which is what I was afraid of. Thanks for the recipe!
