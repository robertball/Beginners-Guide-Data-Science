Many reviewers complained that this recipe was "blah" or has no flavor. This is because it has very little salt in the recipe -- a crucial factor in bread "flavor." Definitely increase the salt to between 1 to 1 1/4 tsp, depending on your preferences. You might want to check your favorite bread recipe and see how much salt per cup of flour there is and start with that. Also, if you haven't made focaccia before this recipe is confusing. It doesn't state how thickly to roll the dough. It isn't going to rise a lot so unless you want it to be like a flatbread don't roll it much thinner than you want it to be when you eat it. Also start with adding 1/4 cup of water after you add the yeast/sugar/water mixture and then add a TBS of water at a time till the dough forms into a ball.

I was a little dubious after reading some of the reviews but I have made this recipe several times now always with excellent results.  The reference to adding additional water means exactly what it says, add enough
extra water to incorporate all the flour.  You should have a soft dough; if it is stiff then you put too much flour in to begin with.  Dough does not require a second rising but I have experimented with this and found the difference is minimal and whether you dimple your foccacia dough or leave it flat is a matter of choice.  I think dimpling the dough and allowing the oil and seasonings to pool in the dimples adds more flavour to the cooked product.  Try steeping dried Italian herbs in olive oil abd then pouring the lot over the top of your dough.  Delish!
I find this recipe creates a focaccia that is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside with big airholes perfect for mopping up tomato based sauces.  Don't over think it and give this recipe a go!

I have made this recipe numerous times. Delicious! I have mixed in italian seasoning and garlic powder in the flour mixture for some extra flavor. I've even mixed olives with the dough and put cheese and veggies on top. Will continue to make this time and time again.

This really is an easy Focaccia recipe.  I have made it before and just couldn't find my recipe.  I also added about a tablespoon of olive oil to my dough, because I thought it was in my regular recipe.  
I place rosemary and parm. cheese on top of mine when I baked.  
To the reviewer that stated it was not that easy to make, I don't think it was any more difficult than most bread recipes.  However, I make all of my bread with a mixer and dough hook.  Just don't over mix or it will be tough.

I just made this recipe, it was so delicious!  I found nothing difficult about the recipe and I've not had very good results with bread recipes, until now.  There is lots of room to play with the ingredients.  I added 2Tbs white sugar, 1/2 cup cornmeal and 1tsp. salt and 1Tbs. Olive oil too the flour and enough water to make a stiff, sticky dough, I followed the directions, kneading 1 minute and letting it rise 30 minutes, only once and then brushed on some garlic infused Olive oil and some parmesan cheese with a sprinkle of dried onions and some more course salt. It was amazing!! It was light and crunchy mmmmm!!! I am very proud of myself. Next time,I will add some cooked pizza toppings as it only took 10 minutes to bake.  I will use this recipe often it's so good and I bet this would make yummy breadsticks!!!*

The first time I made this recipe, I found it to be a little bland, but very simple, and knew it would be easy to modify. This time, I added some garlic powder, a handful of mozzarella cheese, some parmesan, some dried onions, and a touch of parsley. But instead of rolling it out, I made individual rolls. Baked it for about 10 minutes, at a touch lower temperature, and my family went crazy!!

I agree with the previous reviewer.  Nothing about this recipe is good.  The directions are wierd, with the "adding tablespoons of water", to the inadequate rising time.  There is not enough liquid in this recipe!!  And, even though I added salt and herbs to the dough itself (not to mention the top) there was a huge lack of flavor.  It baked up a little dry too, even though I did my best to save it.  I've tried many of the other great focaccia recipes on here- try some of those instead of this one!!

I make this bread about 5 times a week... it's great with a salad and soup, and really dresses up just about any meal. It's absurdly easy and utterly delicious. I add a tsp of white sugar to the flour, and preheat the oven a couple minutes only before raising the dough, then turn it off and put the dough in to bake into a cold oven. I also use coarse salt to sprinkle and extra virgin olive oil ... it's really tasty. You can add seasonings, shredded cheeses, black olives, etc to vary.

I am a fairly experienced bread maker, but this was my first attempt at foccaccia.  I read all the reviews and did add a tsp of salt and one of oil to the dough as well as about 3 tbsp of herbs and garlic.  It turned out fantastic.  My husband and I sat down and ate the whole batch with butter hot out of the oven.  It was the easiest bread I have ever made.  I used my kitchen-aide stand mixer so there was no mess at all.  I wish everything in life was this easy and this good.   A  giant hug to Morticia for a new family favorite.

There is really something missing in this recipe.  Made it yesterday, and seemed like not enough liquid, and really not much flavor. Will NOT make again.

I made this today and made just a couple of changes. I added salt to the flour, put 1/2 cup of olive oil on my jelly roll pan and turned my dough in that before stretching and poking with my fingers to get all the neat little divets. After raising (2nd time) I topped with Emeril's Italian Seasoning, Garlic salt and a little more olive oil. It turned out light and crispy and totally AWESOME!

Very easy! I've only made bread once before and that was 30yrs ago!  I sprinkled Italian Seasonings and Garlic Salt on top before cooking, but forgot I was going to try to dimple top like in picture.  I was going to use a meat mallot to gently press dimples? Not sure how that is done.  You chefs might have to sit down for this next part, but I overcooked it by about 5 min and was too hard for my liking, so took a damp cloth, warmed in microwave and covered the bread in it completely.  It actually brought it back to a nice soft crust! It took me ages to add 1 tbsp of water at a time, so will try previous tip of adding 1/4cup then 1 tbs at a time.  Can't wait to try variations of this recipe, it was delicious!

I am not a huge baker so this recipe was perfect for me. I would say it makes about 8 servings if you cut it correctly. I did take the advice of others and added in about 1 tsp of salt for flavor. I customized my bread by rubbing the dough with garlic, an extra drizzle of EVOO. I topped it with sliced roma tomatoes, shaved parmesan and a sprinkle of italian herbs. I plan on making this as a side to my Italian wedding soup.

Fantastic base recipie... I added olive oil to the dough as well. Doubled recipie with no problem then baked as one big piece, after topping like my favorite focaccia...pushing holes in the top, sprinkling with sea salt, rosemary and parm cheese. So good... so, so good. Family loved it. Thank you for a good basic recipie that I'll keep around...

This recipe is fantastic WITH a little bit of changes.  It was a little bland without it. I infused olive oil with garlic and rosemary, and put on top and sprinkled with an addition of finely chopped rosemary.  Everyone loved it.  Next time I will try some of the suggestions adding herbs , garlic powder and oil to the dough.  Enjoy!

I have made this recipe many times, always with great approval.  I learned to make focaccia in a cooking class in Florence, Italy, and modify this recipe with what I remember of that: before baking, I make little dimples all over the surface of the dough, then pour olive oil all over the top, filling the holes.  It gives it a really lovely flavor and golden glow.  The Italians said the more oil, the better!

The recipe states "stir in additional water." There was only the warm water, 1/3 cup, listed in the ingredients. I didn't notice this until I was half way through preparing it. So I added a cup of water for my additional water and then the flour and salt. I added a LOT more salt, 2 tsp. I added lemon rind and rosemary to the top after brushing it with olive oil. My kids LOVE taking this bread as a sandwich to school! Thanks for the recipe!

I tried this recipe because of high reviews and was very disappointed. I was able to rescue the recipe because I bake a lot of bread, but a novice would have a hard time because this recipe is flawed at it's core. To make a good bread you need to add the flour slowly, in stages, to the liquid, giving it time to incorporate. I also recommend bread flour, but that is not a big deal as you can make delicious bread with regular flour as well. You WILL need to add more water - begin with 2-3 TBS more. I also add 1 TBS olive oil and 1/2 tsp each salt and herbs (optional), then dimple the dough after resting/rising and top with oil and herbs (1/4 tsp italian herbs, basil and 1/8 red pepper flakes for a kick). I brush with oil then tomatoes sliced thin and parmesan. I am all about taking recipes as a start, but even the start of this recipe is flawed so be careful, or better yet find another.

I've never made bread before and this was so easy. I was confused about the water until I read other comments. I added black olives, garlic (minced) and Rosemary. I'm not a chef, but my fiancee thinks I am now!  Thanks!

Thank you so much for posting this! I am new to bread-making and love artisan breads, but they can get really pricey. I found this recipe, decided to try it, and it was great! I don't see why people are complaining about the directions - I had no problem comprehending the part about adding water a tablespoon at a time. I will say that it took longer than half an hour to rise - I let it sit on top of my preheated oven for about 50 minutes before it looked to be the right size - and definitely will add salt to the dry ingredients next time, as the garlic salt I sprinkled on top was tasty but not enough. All in all, a perfect recipe for a beginner, one you can tweak to your liking and one I will make over and over again!

So I stated my situation in another review.  My daughter and I tried this recipe 2 or 3 weeks ago, and like alot of others, found it rather....lacking.   One night however, we were left with a bunch of leftovers and no idea what to do with them. My youngest son mentioned this recipe with a twist. We made this and let it rise the first time, cut it in two, rolled half of it out, put the leftovers on it, rolled the other half out, put it over the first part of the mess, pinched it together and let it rise about 15-20 minutes, baked it and just....  WOWOOWWWOWW!  Can't wait to make these "sandwiches" again!  Morticia, on a personal note. 10 thumbs up from our family to yours!

Whipped this up to serve with a bean salad.  I took note of the other reviews and added a teaspoon of salt to the dough.  I also sprinkled in some dried oregano, basil, parsley and sage while I was kneading.  I coated the top with about twice as much olive oil as the recipe calls for, coarse-grained salt, more oregano, basil, parsley and sage, and a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese.  It came out absolutely delicious, with compliments all around.

I use this recipe often, and it's yummy! Great texture, easy and fast. I've substituted half rye or half whole wheat flour with great results, also.

I have always served focaccia bread to mop up remaining pasta sauce or to dip in seasoned olive oil, so the lack of salt in this recipe didn't keep me from trying it. I followed the directions completely except that I let it rise a second time and did not roll out the dough.  After the first rising, I kneaded it slightly, then stretched it a bit and put it on a baking sheet drizzled with olive oil.  I let it rise a second time for about 15 minutes, then dimpled it with my fingertips.  I drizzled it with olive oil, sprinkled it with sea salt and fresh thyme.  I baked it until it was golden brown on top.  While my pasta was cooking, I cut the bread into large pieces and sprinkled an Italian cheese mixture and chopped garlic on top.  I put the oven on the broiler setting and browned the bread just enough to melt the cheese.  The salt content in the cheese and the sea salt baked into it gave the bread just the right amount of saltiness, but it also wasn't overpowering when dipped into my seasoned and salted olive oil dip mixture.  I've bookmarked this recipe so that I can use it again.  My husband loved it.

Great simple recipe! I added 1/4 tsp salt to dough per the advice of others. I also baked in a smaller pan... I like a thicker bread. I pierced dough with a fork, painted with olive oil, and sprinkled coarse sea salt and dill on top before baking. Baked for 10-12 mins. I painted more olive oil on the bread after baking to keep the crust soft and flavorful! Yum! Will definitely make this again!

I really liked this recipe because it is a bread that you dont have to plan way in advance and work on for hours, plus it tastes very good.  It is the best on the first day, but seems to dry out quickly after that.  I eyeballed the olive oil, and I know I used more than 2 tbsp.  I also added some Italian seasoning on top with the oil and it turned out great.

Thanks for sharing.  A bit of tweaking resulted in a perfect loaf.  Breadmaking is a bit of a challenge, so even though this recipe looks easy enough, those with little breadmaking experience may think the instructions are not clear enough,  but unlike baking sweets, which requires exact measurements and methods, breadmaking is more of a loose method that is highly subject to conditions, ie. heat/humidity level fluctuations will result in different rise times even if I were to make this recipe 3 days in a row; the amount of water needed can vary each time I make it as well.  Just keep practicing until you get to know the feel of a good dough (not too wet, not too dry) and don't be upset with the poster if their dough rose in 30 min and yours took 60.  A bad bread is never a waste, the birds will love your failed experiments.

Turned out very weird, I followed the recipe to a tee and it turned out very flat and looked undercooked, but I baked it for the more than the alloted time. :( hopefully next time it will be delicious.

I made this as the recipe states and it was blah.  I also rolled it too thin so it was hard in some spots.  I will try again with spices and rolling it much thicker.

This is literally the first thing I've baked that didn't come from a box. It sounded easy enough and my wife's favorite bread is focaccia, so I gave it a go. As far as "Easiest" is concerned...I would say not (my bread came out like a giant cracker or "thin crust" pizza dough). One writer said to add more salt - which I did and it made the taste reasonable. I also added some rosemary, but not enough. It is a good starter for variations, but the directions are not "easy" enough for a first-timer.

I was disappointed with the vagueness of this recipe.  Not knowing just how moist the dough should be was confusing as to how much water to add.  More or less olive oil and/or salt was also misleading.  However, I guessed pretty close and added 2 very thin slices of red onion, 1 Roma tomato sliced thin and 15 black olives, again thinly sliced on top.  Added 1 T. of olive oil and about 1 t. of Italian seasoning.  Baked 15 minutes and achieved a reasonable success.  Have made notes of the changes to make a good product.

Being familiar with making bread really helps but it is a great base... depending on what we are serving it with I add all kinds of stuff to make it savory or sweet depending on the meal... Even made sandwich bread by pressing it into an 8" round cake pan and it came out thick moist and delicious. I also love breads with goodies in them and have kneaded in a lot of combinations: sliced olives with shredded Parmesan cheese; caramelized mushrooms with cheddar; chopped pepperoni and mozzarella; been topping it before baking with coarse ground garlic, sea salt and garlic blend sometimes adding other herbs too. with sweet bread I've been sprinkling it with raw sugar and cinnamon. Only problem is we can finish 2 loaves a day!!! Also used 1/2 cup wheat flour for health and flavor and it was even better!

Tried this recipe tonight and not only was it super easy and quick... it was absolutely delicious.  The children ate it all as a snack.    I liberally salted the top and drizzle rosemary flavored olive oil (simmered the oil on the stove during proofing) and added onion and freshly grated parm cheese.  I only baked for about 8 minutes at 475 and the bread was perfect..

I hate yeasted bread recipes since I have no bread machine and no stand mixer. This was perfect and came out alot thicker than I anticipated. Even being in Maine with the house being a tad chilly this rose nicely (with some help from the warm mist humidifier) and came out beautifully.  I added Italian herbs to the dough and sprinkled the top with the same, sea salt and some freshly shredded Parmesean/Asiago/Romano cheese. Perfection.

My husband thought this was "practically perfect bread" tonight.  After getting a look, he modified it to "perfect bread."

This was super easy, not messy to make, and tasted super.  The only modifications I made were:

- use 1 cup white whole wheat flour and 1 cup AP flour
- mince a garlic clove and let it soak in a mixture of 3 parts olive oil and 1 part basil oil.  Smear that all over the top of it.

I let it cook just barely 10 minutes, and it was perfect.

This was great! I doubled the recipe and added 1 teaspoon of salt to the yeast and sugar mixture. When adding 1 tablespoon of water at a time, I ended up using 1 cup. So it will probably be about 1/2 cup if you don't double the recipe. I mixed olive oil, garlic powder, and some herbs and brushed it on top and baked 5 minutes. Then I topped it with a mixture I had made earlier of tomatoes, onions, garlic, olive oil, parsley, basil, and oregano. Added some feta cheese and fresh basil and baked it for 5 more minutes. YUMMY! The bread was thick and chewy on the inside with a little bit of crunch on the outside. Just the way I like it.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it's a good basic recipe. Yes it is bland if you make it the way it's written and do nothing else with it, but it's very versatile. There's a lot of room for creativity. I've always added extra spices (garlic powder, onion powder, herbes des provences, etc) to suit whatever I'm going to eat it with. I use it to make pizza. I've even made dessert pizza with it, I just added vanilla extract cinnamon and nutmeg to the dough and instead of sprinkling olive oil over it i made a basic caramel sauce and sliced fruit really thin. After it cool I drizzled melted dark and white chocolate on it.

I just tried this recipe, and I added a lot of things so that is why I am only giving it 4 stars. Its a great start but had room for improvement. After reading the other reviews I added in 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp dried parsley, 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1/2 tsp rosemary and about a tsp or 2 of olive oil to the dough. While it was rising I poured about 1/4 cup of olive oil into a small saucepan and turned it on to low, I added one crushed clove of garlic, and 1/2 tsp dried rosemary. After 30 mins I did not knead the dough on a floured  surface, I just kneaded it in the oiled bowl for a minute. After putting it onto my baking sheet I poked holes into the top and brushed on the olive oil that I infused with garlic and rosemary and sprinkled a decent amount of course kosher salt all over. 17 minutes was the perfect baking time for mine. I guess I did not spread it out enough on the pan because it came out a little thick, but I cut it into strips and it makes the perfect breadstick. We are having it with a grilled chicken salad for dinner, but I tasted it and its delicious :) Thanks for the recipe!

Following another readers suggestion, I added extra olive oil and Italian spices; it tasted good, but next time I'm going to add way more salt, more olive oil, and more spices, then I think it would be really good. =)

I loved this recipe. It was very easy but delicious. But I made a few changes. At the last knead, I folded in some Italian Seasoning and Herb de Provence. Then, after I rubbed oil and salt on top I sprinkled more of the spices and some grated Parmesan on.  It was so great! Next time I'll have to double the recipe at least.

I have tried unsuccesfully for years to make a focaccia which resembles the restaurant variety. I made this last night and it was a hit with everyone! Only wish I had doubled or tripled it. What I love was that I could whip it up an hour before the meal, as opposed to "starting the sponge" the night before, as many recipes advise to do. I did use different flour, as self-rising was all I had on hand. Also, I ground up some dried rosemary and sprinkled on top. LOVED the authentic Italian taste of this bread. Next time, I will double the recipe and make smaller, individual loaves. Will probably have to reduce the baking time.

This is SO fantastic! I have made this several times now and it never fails to please me. I have made it incredibly thin and in incredibly thick and everything in between. Every time it bakes exactly how I want it. I usually soak Italian seasoning in the olive oil and put both herbs and oil on at the same time. I add different herbs on top, depending on my mood. Coarse sea salt works perfectly for this recipe, as well. I have been having the most trouble with making pizza dough lately, and seeing as this was easy to work with I decided to add some salt to the dough and try it as a pizza dough. It works PERFECTLY. Just set the oven to 450 instead of 475 and leave it in there for about 15 minutes.

Very good and VERY easy! I used a Kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook instead of hand kneading and it was great.  The water it mentions to add after the main ingredients are mixed...I jut added it tablespoon by tablespoon until the flour was all mixed in.  I added salt into the flour mix, but will add more next time, probably 2 teaspoons.  I also added fresh herbs and minced garlic on top. YUM. So good.

This was the easiest receipe and so yummy! my only suggestiong would be to add some salt to the actual dough to add more flavor. You could even add some herbs as well. I also but garlic oil on the top before i baked it. delicious!

a fun, simple recipe. add fresh rosemary to the dough, let it rise a little longer than stated and dump the dough out into a cookie sheet with edges that has a healthy dose of olive oil in it. This helps makes that bottom crust, crusty. Stretch it out with your fingers, rub that oil from the pan on the top, too and put lots of interesting toppings like sundried tomatoes, mushrooms,herbs whatever and let it rise a little more before baking. We like to eat a slice with soup and if you make a more plain version, you can split it horizontaly to make a sandwich.

This has become a staple in our house. I use a bit of flavored oil when adding water, sometimes add some herbs. Easy garlic bread: cook with olive oil and add garlic and sea salt over top. Best pizza ever: pre-bake crust until almost done then add any sort of toppings. Even better if cooked on a grill!

This was super easy! I quickly whipped it up when I had unexpected guests arrive to an Italian food night. Followed the recipe exactly when making the dough and turned it into more of a bruschetta bread using fresh chopped tomatoes & basil. More filling that way, and everyone gave it two thumbs up. Will definitely make again.

This was my first time making focaccia, and it turned out great.  It didn't rise as much as I would have liked, but the flavor was amazing.  Served it with tomato and white bean soup.

Our family of 5 enjoyed this recipe.  I added dried oregano, basil and thyme to the flour prior to mixing and added shredded parmessan and mozzarella cheese to the top.  I will definatley make again, with onion and jalapenos on top.

Easy and had a very nice consistency.  I did think it was a little odd it didn't call for salt in the dough.  Thought it could use a little more taste, so next time I will try more salt and herbs or garlic or something.

Great recipe.  I added a good couple of shakes of Penzey's Brady Street Cheese sprinkle to the dough and topped it with freshly-grated Parmesan cheese and drizzled with oil.  Baked on my pizza stone until golden brown and crisp on the outside.  Delicious!  Hubby and I ate the whole thing for dinner with homemade roasted red pepper-tomato soup!

Perfect!  It was almost TOO easy; I was afraid it wouldn't turn out.  But turn out it did.  I mixed Italian herbs, garlic, and freshly ground pepper into the olive oil before brushing.  It was very flavorful and had a great texture.  This recipe will be a staple!

PERFECT!!!  Season however you want.  I used a lot of ground sage and a little basil.  So good.  Double the recipe if you will be serving this for more than 4 or 6 guests.  In a small bowl, mix together 1/2 cup olive oil, ground pepper, salt, basil to taste, and dip your bread in this as you eat it.  You'd think you're at a restaraunt!

This is my go to recipe! I made this for a family dinner and everyone loved it. Next time I will double the recipe so will be a little bit thicker. It was super easy to make. The only thing I changed was I put Salt in the Dough and coarse salt on top. It came out really good.  Will definitely make it again.

Nothin' complicated about this recipe nor cockeyed regarding the mix except for the salt. Add a teaspoon more than it asks for and all will be right with the world. Add the water till you get a soft dough...and the rest is how you like it with Italian herbs and olive oil. A great and consistently good focaccia. Hats off to Ms. Morticia!

I see that there was quite a few reviews about this being bland. In Italy very little salt is added, should add more to dipping sauce or eat with some great Italian Cheese. I add cheese, rosemary with light salt and Olive oil on top before baking. Try and see. This is a good and easy recipe.

This recipe is so fast and easy and it always comes out great! You can experiment by adding herbs and spices to the dough and on top of the bread before baking. Great with pastas, salads and as a sandwich bread! Thanks! :)

Does anyone know can I leave this dough overnight?  I teach a foods class and we often make pizza dough and leave overnight because we only have an hour.  Wondering if it will still work ok?

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  I did tweak it a little to suit my personal tastes, but the first time I made it exactly as-is and thought it was delicious.  The second time I made it, I added more salt, a little olive oil and some minced fresh rosemary and thyme to the dough.  Then when I put it in the pan (I baked it in my cast iron skillet) , I dimpled the dough, brushed with olive oil, sprinkled on some sea salt and then added a generous handful of grated parmesan cheese.  I pulled it out at 11 1/2 minutes and it was PERFECT.  Served it with steaks and roasted brussels sprouts.

Really easy and good!  I like quick bread recipes.  I didn't even knead it, I let my Kitchen Aid doit!.  I did add 1/2 of salt to the dough.  I also topped it with some course sea salt and grated parmesan cheese.  A nice combination of crispy and chewy.

Added Italian herb seasoning and garlic salt to the top before baking and sprinkled cheese on the top just before the bread came out of the oven.  Outstanding!!!

This recipe was very easy AND affordable. I made some roasted veggie sandwiches with it. My only complaint (thus 4 stars rather than 5) is that the recipe doesn't state how thin it should be rolled or what size baking sheet to put on. I actually think I made mine too thick. I did add some tomatoes and italian spices to the top before baking. However, the recipe itself was perfect for me as it stood; only lacking additional instruction for the inexperienced.

Amazing! A good, simple recipe that could easily be adapted.  the dough came out very light after rising, and made a fantastic basic bread.  I added garlic powder and black pepper to the top before baking.  I love how fast it was, and plan to use this for pizza dough, and would love to try on it the grill next summer!
UPDATE: Just did this on the BBQ, burners on medium, bottom of crust oiled for about 5 mins, then off to the side on indirect heat when I added the toppings (caramelized onion with red wine and balsamic, roasted garlic, cherry tomato halves, and zucchini matchsticks).  Worked out amazing! really light and fluffy, with a crunchy bottom.

Awesome and easy!  As others suggested, I added a scant tsp of sea salt to the flour, as well as a couple tsps of thyme, oregano, etc and a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.  (This recipe would easily support several Tbsp of herbs.)  As my bread hook was doing the work kneading, I added about a Tbsp of olive oil then let it rise.  After patting it into shape, I also brushed on olive oil and sprinkled a little sea salt.  I preheated the oven to 475, put the bread in and then turned it off to "cold-bake" for 10 minutes and it turned out moist and chewy and sooo amazing.  Sliced it open for some grilled veggie sammies. Yum!

Didn't find this too great but it was OK so it gets 3 stars. Not enough flavour for my taste.

I've made this several times, but I always modify it to combat the blah. Today I added rosemary, but it still wants salt and extra oil. Dipped in olive oil, Tuscan spices, salt and garlic, it made a nice snack. I've also used it as a pizza dough. I work red pepper flakes or spices into the dough and top it with sliced tomatoes, cheese and spinach. Think of the recipe as a blank canvas rather than a finished work.

We LOVED this bread. It is super quick and easy. I just threw the ingredients into my kitchen aid stand mixer and Wa Lah!!! ...I did have to add extra water, because it was way too dry.  I used a combination of garlic flavored oil, butter, sauteed onions, and a garlic and parmesan seasoning salt to top it off.  I cut  it in half for a yummy sandwich filled with thin slices of leftover steak, tomato, lettuce, pickles, avocado, and jalepeno slices. ...and of course mustard and a mayo sauce!  It was delicious and simple! 50 Stars!

Easy recipe!  I was a little unsure about how much water to add but just kept on going until the dough came together.  I've never made anything with yeast before and this was pretty fascinating to see it bloom. Last night I put italian herbs and chopped olives in the dough and tonight I'm using the herbs again, and sprinkling it with parmesan and rosemary.

So yummy!  Instead of just salt, I chopped up 5 cloves of garlic, oregano, basil, parsley, sea salt, pepper, parmesan cheese, and other Italian cheeses together and put the mixture on top before baking.  Yummy!

Yum! We tripled the amount of yeast and it was really light and absorbent. We drizzled olive oil on it.  This would also be good with herbs mixed in which we plan to do next time we bake this, and have it with motzarella cheese and balsamic vinegar.

This was my first time making bread without a machine, so was quite pleased with the result. However, while the consistency of the bread was perfect, it tastes really 'yeast-y'. I'll have to try it out again to see where I went wrong. Other than that, it's a really simple recipe to follow.

This is really delicious and so quick and esay to make.  I used organinc spelt flour and mixed in basil, oregano, and garlic powder. My husband couldn't stop eating it and begged me to make it again.  This would also make great pizza crust.Usually when a recipe is described as easy, it means it is something processed out of a box or mix but this is from scratch and easy.  We love it.

I made this last night to go with some homemade chicken soup and we all loved it. I found the recipe very easy to follow and I'm a novice bread maker.I add the water a tablespoon at a time until I had a nice soft/sticky dough (about 6 tablespoons). I did add a tablespoon of olive oil to the dough as someone else suggested. Also, when I went to shape it after the 30 minute rising I found it kept "snapping" back. So, I roughly shaped it, covered it with a damp towel and let it rest another 10 minutes and then it cooperated fully with being shaped. I brushed it with 2 tablespoons of olive oil and topped it with some kosher salt and grated parmesan cheese. It was really delicious. Next time I will be a little bolder with the toppings. I wanted to make it as the recipe suggested the first time out. I cooked it for about 12 minutes since DH likes softer breads. Really easy, really good!

I tried to make this bread today...it did not rise very much-I proofed the yeast correctly...anyhow, I got this mass of I-don't-know-what out of the oven and it was very bland.  Perhaps next time...

Oh, this was so good and made excellent panini bread!  I used 1 c all-purpose flour and 1 c wheat flour.  I also added garlic powder, dried crushed rosemary, and italian seasoning to the sugar/water/yeast mixture right before adding in the flour.  10 minutes in the oven was just perfect.  I love how easy and quick this was, especially since my Kitchenaid stand mixer did most of the work!

I've made this 3 times, and it's disappeared within an hour all three times.  I added salt to the dough after the flour was mostly incorporated and topped mine with tomatoes and garlic marinated in olive oil and basil and on another occasion caramelized onions.  I love this recipe, it's so quick for a home made bread!  Try this today!!!

Made with wheat flour and added sliced tomato, parmesan, and garlic salt to top.  Pretty good... next time I'll mix in the garlic salt and tomatoes instead of just putting them on top.

Definitely found it easy to make, and it came out light and fluffy.  I brushed mine with a bit less olive oil, then sprinkled shredded mozzarella and dried basil all over it.  I did not add salt, because sometimes the cheese gives enough of that and I didn't want to over-do it.  But I think next time I will actually add some salt to the dough, as another reviewer mentioned.  Very serviceable recipe, and easy to dress it up any way you like it!  Thanks!

This was excellent.  I sprinkled seasoned chicken bits, cheese, and thin slices of red pepper, onion, and cherry tomatoes on top of it before baking.  The texture was perfect--crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  If I weren't going to add any toppings I would definitely add herbs to the flour mix to give it some flavor.

I hate to give bad reviews, but this was terrible starting with the directions.  I agree with the reviewer that said the directions were a bit hard to follow.  My problem was with the amount of water and adding tablespoons at a time to incorporate all the flour.  What kind of dough consistency is one supposed to have?  Is it supposed to be a stiff dough?  soft dough?  No second rising?  no dimpling of the dough before adding the oil?  So against my better judgement, I didn't second rise and dimple the bread.  It was a bit flat and tasted like flour or a biscuit...would never know I had yeast in there at all.  I consider myself a very good baker and love making bread; never worked a bread machine so do it all by hand.  Will have to find a different recipe.

This recipe is awesome! I am a beginner at baking breads & this easy bread was soft from the inside & crusty on the top. I thought it would taste better if I added some salt into the dough other than topping with salt. Can I do that?
Thanks for the super easy recipe!

This recipe was very easy and it was delicious.  I added alittle oil in the flour mixture and it came out better than my pizza dough.  I make pizza dough every week and make bread often, but I have never tasted anything like this.  Try it and you will like it.  thanks alot Sam!!

Easy recipe and very adaptable.   I used my Ninja to knead the dough and added kosher salt,granulated garlic, and rosemary after brushing it with olive oil.  Very tasty.

I loved it. I followed Islander and Aussiecook's recommendations and it turned out  so good! Easy and delicious! Next time, I'll search allrecipes for a tapenade first! :) Mmm. I was always too nervous to try making yeast bread before but this wasn't hard at all.

I tripled the recipe. I got the yeast proofing, awesome. Then it went downhill. I added the flour, and then I had to add more than 3 cups of water and it wasn't a cohesive dough. When we ate it, the bread was dry and flavorless. I'm NEVER making this again.

Too dense, no flavor, unlike any focaccia I've ever eaten. It quite simply is NOT focaccia. It's edible, though.

Love it! I have made this a lot of times! I have mixed in olives, tomatoes,cheese,artichokes,garlic etc - its a basic recipe you can add many things too! Get creative! Also flavored olive oils work well too! I use garlic and lemon - extra seasoning salt is a plus! If you have an olive bar at your grocery store grab a handful of marinated items chop em up and throw them in (don't rinse) for Mediterranean focaccia - add bit of extra flour if you do yum!

If you follow this exactly, it is flat and tasteless. It is a good starting point however, to add in what ever you want to flavor it. That being said, I think salt should have been included in the dough - not just to sprinkle on top.

My family loved this recipe. Will definitely make it again. I used canola oil in the dough and sprinkled it with olive oil and salt before putting it in the oven.

Beautiful!  It is a fabulous base recipe for focaccia!  I used half whole wheat and added fresh rosemary, garlic powder, and upped the salt to 1 teaspoon.  The end product was crusty on the outside and soft and gorgeous on the inside!  The only problem was how much I ate!

It is very bland and ordinary to be honest.  You have to add fresh herbs or at least garlic.

This is much faster than the "rise overnight" recipe I usually use.  I, too, added olive oil to the dough.  I used a pizza stone (preheated w/the oven), and 10 minutes seemed to be a minute too long. It's good for a quick bread fix, but if I have the time I'll use the Better H&G recipe I usually use.

I followed the basics of this recipe but added some chopped sun-dried tomato and black olives along with some mixed Italian herbs and garlic. I used approximately an extra 1/3 cup of water in with the dough and baked for 15 minutes. The taste was wonderful and the texture superb. You may wish to tweak the ingredients to suit your tastes, but I found this to be a good, simple starting point for some great focaccia. It's quick, easy and the bread goes great in the panini press.....

This was an easy recipe and not very time consuming. It didn't have enough salt though and made the bread very bland. I think if I upped the salt it would be much better! Other than that I loved the consistency of this focaccia

This made respectable bread, but it’s not the best focaccia recipe I’ve tried.  For flavor and appearance, I added chopped fresh rosemary, and sprinkled kosher salt after it was removed from the oven so the salt wouldn’t melt into the dough.

This recipe was great but a little bland. I added 1 Tsp of Italian seasoning to the bread itself and sprinkled about 3/4 TBS of Italian seasoning on the top. I also chose cracked sea salt over regular table salt which makes a huge difference! :)

I made this for the first time the other night.  I mixed fresh chopped rosemary, seasoned salt and a touch of sea salt into the flour.  I brushed the top of the bread with olive oil and sprinkled a bit more rosemary on top.  Fantastic.  I will never buy focaccia again.  I made this "California grilled veggie sandwich".

I am hopeless at making bread. So thought I would give focaccia a go as it seemed easier. I found this recipe read all the reviews first and took everyones tips into consideration. I used my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook on a low speed as someone suggested, I added garlic and herb seasoning and salt to the oil that I brushed on top as I forgot to add it to the actual mix. It turned out perfect first time I am so happy. Thanks for all the tips they helped me know what to expect

I had a free shelf in the oven, so decided to make this bread.  I found it a bit bland.  If I make it again, I'll definitely be adding a bit of salt to the mixture, maybe some dried rosemary or Italian seasoning too.  For a quick, easy bread, this worked out fine, but only if I make something of it (sandwich, etc.) - I wouldn't just eat this with oil and vinegar as I normally do.  Still, a good base recipe to build on.  Thanks.

So easy and the results are awesome!  Omitted the salt (I am on a low sodium diet) and sprinkled with minced fresh thyme, oregano and garlic with carmelized red onion.  So good!  The possibilities are endless on what flavor combinattions to try.  I know I'll be trying as many as I can think of!!  Thanks Morticia, you have made a bread lover very happy!

this was a good "blank slate" for adding your own flavorings and touches, and extremely easy to make. i did half whole wheat flour and half all purpose flour, added ~1/4c olive oil to the dough, along with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp garlic powder. i also proofed the yeast (in warm water w/sugar added) before adding to the flours. my home is pretty dry today, so i used close to 1 c of water to get the dough to come together. i put the dough on an oiled baking sheet, flipped it to coat both sides, then covered loosely to let it rise (30 mins was perfect). after rising, i just stretched it a bit (like you would pizza dough), patted it to about 1/4" thickness, and sprinkled dried herbs, some diced red onion, and sea salt on top and baked on 425F for about 15 mins and it came out wonderfully. makes waaaaaaay more than four servings (easily eight). i will certainly be using this recipe as a base for some more creative recipes, thanks so much for sharing!

Good bread!  I added 2 tsp salt, 1 tsp garlic powder, and 2 Tbsp olive oil to the dough.  After rolling out the dough (to about 1/2"), I added about 2 Tbsp fresh minced garlic and 3 Tbsp shredded Parmesan to the top before baking.

Super easy and yummy! would of been five stars if the time in the oven was more acurate-after ten mins on high heatit wasn;t even nearly done (I've hardly had trouble with timing before) but it tasted soooo good! couldn't stop eating from it.

This recipe serves as an easy base for you to expand upon. I added minced garlic and basil, as well as tomatoes (chopped and dried). Then, I sprinkled asiago cheese during the the last few minutes of baking.

Try making a sandwich with turkey, bacon and aioli...it's very good.

This is what the name says it is - easy.  But, it also tastes great!  The possibilities are endless as to what herbs and spices you could use on this.  I used some basil, garlic and salt.  This was a great addition to our soup for dinner.

I made this tonight and it was GREAT. Used a combination of herbs and topped with black olives. Great for dipping in EVO and Balsamic. Noticed that the quantity of water, 1/3 cup, is not correct. Might have used as much as 1 more cup of warm water. Will make it often now that I know how.

Only use 1 tsp of salt if you arent used to a high dosage...make sure to add baking powder or it has quite a bit of trouble rising. I mix thyme into the flour before mixing the water and then season with Rosmary, thin onion slices and a touch of romano or parma. So good! Now that I've made it so many times it's requested weekly.

Wow, I have been trying a couple focaccia recipes and this one came out the best!  It was easy!  I might try some other reviewers suggestions and make individual rolls for sandwiches.

This recipe is simple to make and smells great! I was initially dubious about the adding tablespoons of water until it was just right, but it turned out well. In my case it took about six extra spoonfuls. I cut my dough into 4 wedges just before I baked it instead of rolling it out and deflating it. The turnout was 4 small sandwich rolls which was just what I was hoping for.

This was easy to make and delicious.  I topped mine with thyme and it was very flavorful.  However I do wish this recipe had included the exact amount of water to use, I bake so I was familiar with the consistency of bread but some one who doesn't would have trouble following this recipe.

This bread had a good flavor but it was kind of thin and flat.  I followed the directions exactly so not sure what happened.  I'll have to try it again though to see if anything changes.

Very easy, yet delicious. Added slightly more salt and had sliced cherry tomatoes and oregano on top. Found that it did rise quite a lot in the oven, so will flatten it more next time.

ALERT! First DO NOT use cookie paper. If you put this in the oven your kitchen will be filled with smoke! 475 is too hot for wax paper.   I've made this 4 times now and each time it's getting better but the problem, as many have stated, is that it's just too bland. I've added a table spoon of garlic and a tablespoon of salt to Step 2. Also when it's on the pan about to bake I increased the amount of garlic I spread on top. This way when it comes out of the oven it's nice and soft. This recipe is a good base but needs extras.

Although I liked this bread, it wasn't really what I was hoping for. I was wanting a hard crusted bread, and even though I baked this on a stone it really wasn't hard crusted. But thanks, as it was good.

I love flatbread and figure I'd give making it a try. For some reason, this didn't rise (my first time doing anything with yeast - sure I messed something up) but I baked it anyway. Added salt, pepper, rosemary, sage, thyme, and garlic powder to the dough and on the top. The result was well, FLATbread. Really hard, crispy, and not what I'd planned - but delicious!

Good recipe. I tried ad libbing some seasoning with an Italian seasoning blend and it was delicious!  But, I cooked it too long.  I plan to try it again soon. Thanks to all of you who reviewed and mentioned the seasoning.

All I can say is anybody that finds this recipe difficult should probably dine out.  I found it to be very simple and quite taste.

I mixed garlic and basil with olive oil and brushed the mixture on before baking.

Its a winner folks.

Not bad for my first try at bread making.  I think it could have been better, but i'm pretty sure it was my lack of experience.  But the taste was good and the recipe wasn't intimidating like other breads.  Maybe I'll try more bread!

I've tried this for the 2nd time and it was much better!  I added garlic powder, crushed red pepper flakes, and italian seasoning to the dough as well as 3 packages of that cheese you get from Pizza Hut (I was out of the good stuff) and it is Really good!

Since this is the first time I've made focaccia, I think this was pretty good and pretty easy.  I read some of the reviews and tried some of their ideas.  I added Italian seasoning to the dough and I brushed garlic infused olive oil on top of the dough before baking.  I think it came out pretty good.

This was great!  With the addition of the suggested minced garlic, salt, basil and rosemary to the dough......  I then topped with olive oil that had been warmed with more of the herbs and garlic, spread on with a pastry brush and sprinkled with mozzarella, parmesean and kosher salt. I didn't use a bread machine or mixer-a wooden spoon worked just fine.  My 3 year old polished off 2 pieces before the pan had even cooled off! Definitely better than what I can get at any store around here!

Very good! A definate must for the aspiring baker, especially beginners because they are so simple. Seasoning is the key. Garlic, rosemary and kosher salt did it for me. So good!

this recipe was all good things in one - easy, spot on with flavor (see below for what I added), and impressive looking. My husband thought I bought it, and I love that!  What I did different is added pepper, salt, and garlic powder to the dough, and topped it with oil, thinly sliced tomato, fresh rosemary, and fresh parmesan cheese.

this yielded restaurant quality bread.  i can't believe i made it in my own kitchen!  this recipe was made easier by using the dough hook attachment on my mixer.  before baking, i mixed rosemary, oregano, salt and olive oil and spread the mixture on top of the dough.  i also sprinkled parmesan on top.  i used the leftover bread to make tasty croutons.  i cut the bread into cubes, tossed the bread in olive oil, and baked.

A wonderful recipe.  This is my first time baking focaccia, and with this recipe it turned out great.  My very picky 11 year old daughter, who doesn't even like PBJ sandwiches, couldn't stop saying, "Mmmmm!" every time she took a bite.  I followed the recipe, added water until it made a soft dough and let it rise about 45 minutes (it's a cool, rainy day).  I used a fork to poke some air holes, and sprinkled garlic salt, rosemary, and parmesan cheese on top before baking.  Next time I'll be more careful while shaping - I let it get thin in spots, which made it crunchier.  And I'll double the recipe so we can each eat more.

I understand the confusion with the recipe directions - I cross referenced other focaccia recipes for clarity and had great results. I think any cook should learn a little flexibility with this craft or else there will be more disappointments than necessary. Allrecipes most times has more than one recipe for a dish and with a little perseverance answers will appear. I love how cheap fresh homemade focaccia bread is!

This is EASY! About an hour from mixing to done!!
I put herbs in it before kneading( basil, rosemary, etc and chopped garlic) I left off the salt as I’m on a low salt diet!

Very easy to make. I used measure for measure gluten free flour and it turned out great. My husband couldn’t even tell it was gluten free. Added garlic and oregano to the top before baking. Will definitely make again!

Very fast focaccia with great results. Note, you MUST increase the amount of salt to at least 1 teaspoon. I add 1/2 tspn during the last knead after the dough has risen to get it into the club for added flavor, and then sprinkle on at least another 1/2 tspn with the olive oil at the end. This results in a much more flavorful bread but does not interrupt the fast rise time. Great for a weeknight taste of Italy!

I have made this quite a few times and love it for a quick bread to add to my spaghetti meals.  I always dust it with some sea salt and sometimes add rosemary. It is an easy go to for a quick bread and it tastes great!

I liked the ease and simplicity of this recipe. However, the taste and consistency was not what I was expecting from a focaccia. It was more like a saltine cracker than a bread. I thought it would be better dipped into marinara, but it didn’t change anything.

After reading several reviews I made no changes to this recipe.  To me this is  classic Focaccia recipe that lends itself to multipe variations yet is delightful as is.  Other reviewers have suggested some addditives that I will try another time.   As to the issue of water.  I looked at other Focaccia recipes regarding the amount of water used and then made a guess as to how much to use in this recipe.   I put in a little more than the recipe called for and then added more as needed.  The result was a wonderfully soft dough and easy to manage. I will make this again.

If I followed this recipe exactly as written, it would have gone in the garbage. There isn’t nearly enough water in the recipe. I used more than double what the recipe called for, not a couple of tablespoons.

I have already made it twice. Went by recipe.  In. Addition to olive oil and sea salt, I sprinkled on Italian seasonings, parsley and fennel seed. So good. So easy. I do have to let it rise about  40-45 min.

I made a few changes after reading the reviews, and it turned out really good. I added pizza seasoning and some fresh garlic to the dough. I brushed the top with minced garlic, more pizza seasoning and olive oil. I then sprinkled salt and grated parm on top. Without these changes I think it would have been bland, but still good.

i'm not a bread maker but decided to try this.  i did read a lot of the reviews which i find most helpful.  i followed the basic recipe with respect to flour and yeast.  as per other reviewers suggestions and my desires, i added 1 t. sugar, 1 t. salt, 1 t. italian seasoning, 1 t. rosemary, 1/2 t. onion powder, 1/2 t. garlic powder and 1 T olive oil to the flour.  then i added the yeast mixture.  then i added a touch less than  1/4 c. water - mixed - added another same amount and it was perfect.  adding 1 t. water at a time is not necessary.   after it rose for 30 mins, i put on lightly floured counter, did not knead, but rather just pushed down gently to create dimples.  then brushed with olive oil (i could have used more as it did soak in while baking), sea salt and then sprinkled with fresh/frozen parm.  baked at 415 for 15 mins.  it is wonderful.  i can't imagine it without all those herbs.  hope this helps!

An easy bread, and pretty good. As others have said, it needs more salt, which I sifted in (@ 1.5 tsp.) with the flour starting the third time I made the recipe. Otherwise, it is pretty straightforward.

It was fine. Quick and easy to make, and a good texture. I'd consider it a base recipe though - as written it has no flavor at all. Inclusions and toppings are needed for flavor.

This was my first time making focaccia. As the recipe indicates it is very easy. I sprinkled half with Italian seasoning and half with rosemary and followed the recipe exact. My family & I agree that more salt is needed and will add more to the dough when I make this again. Great bread-great recipe. Thanks!

This is an excellent intro into making focaccia.  It is, however, very basic - but never mind, it makes a good bread.

I, personally like to knead longer - add 1 tbs of olive oil after a minute or two of kneading.  Knead until oil is absorbed and add oil/knead one or two more times.

For those that think it bland, add a tad more salt, Italian style herbs, garlic and onion powder to the flour before mixing in the yeast water.

The technique of dribbling in another 1/3 to 1/2 cup of water during kneading is foreign to me. The scant water is, I suspect, an effort to keep gobs of dough from clotting up on the cook's fingers. But that loose, sticky aspect is one way to judge your kneading progress. Focaccia wants extreme kneading -- your fingers will clean themselves as the dough gets right.

This recipe tends toward crunchy crust which is not how I want focaccia for sandwiches. There the eater needs a soft crust easy to bite through without destroying the filling. Lotsa oil on top does not soften the crust and makes a messy sandwich.

This recipe is okay for a dinner side and for dipping. I split squares horizontally and made finger snacks (like hors d'oeuvres or canapés).

This is a good basic recipe. Changes I made: I doubled the recipe, and started with 1 cup water (per needing to add more later). I added 2 tsp salt to the flour, as well as some garlic powder and parsley. I forgot to add oil with the flour, but I don't think it made much difference. I topped with oil that had garlic & rosemary sitting it for 40 min. I also topped with slices roma tomatoes, a bit of Parmesan and mozzarella. Baked for 20 minutes total. Tasty!

Great recipe! I made it and ate it with salami in the middle. I do recommend, however, adding salt in the flour, otherwise you can't eat the focaccia by itself, since it doesn't have enough flavor inside. I also recommend adding other herbs in the flour to give it more flavor. The best thing about this recipe is that it's easy to make and easy to modify.

I'm the farthest thing you can imagine from being a good cook, but I'm now preparing to make my third focaccia using this recipe.

Some have mentioned that the flour isn't soaking up much water. I've just kept adding a little at a time until I get what I think is the right consistency (and again, I'm no cook). This seems to be a fairly forgiving recipe; heck, it's only got a few ingredients so it's hard to mess up.

I do agree that a bit of extra salt would help, which I've done this time. We'll see how that works out. However, I've been adding some grated parmesan, garlic powder and Italian seasonings to the dough, and when I knead it, my hands have been covered in olive oil. This helps to keep the dough from sticking to my fingers, and it works in some oil into the dough.

Seriously, if I can make this without messing it up, anybody can. Patience grasshopper.

I made this as a first attempt making focaccia bread and because I have always been super intimidated cooking with yeast. I gotta admit, it turned out great...but I definitely let it rise for longer than 30 mins. In 30 mins it didn't change size at all, but in two hours there was a much more noticeable difference. I also added rosemary to it and a heck of a lot more salt. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the turnout :)

I have made this recipe 3 t imes and it failed to rise each time.  I changed the yeast when it didn't rise.  My ingredients were all room temp.  I checked that the water for the yeast was exactly 110 degrees.  Still it did not rise even in a comfortable warm kitchen.  I will say the crusted bread was tasty even while it was just crust.  i won't use this recipe again

This bread was super yummy and easy to put together! Definitely could add salt to your taste though I didn't mind the amount at all. I made a dipping sauce out of  olive oil, salt, pepper, and italian seasoning. Heaven!

I made this focaccia and topped it like a pizza.  It was great and will now be our go-to pizza dough.  I will add a little more salt next time.  Quick and easy because you can cut up your veggies and preheat the oven while the dough rises.  Also gonna try it just by the recipe for bread to go with spaghetti.  Yum!
Update:  I've made this several times now and it is always very good!  I pour about  3-4 Tablespoons of olive oil in baking pan, put dough in the pan and stretch it out to fit pan, put a little more olive oil on top, then add my toppings.  It is SO good!

Considering that this was my first time making focaccia and using yeast, this was a fairly simple recipe to follow.  The recipe is so easy that I used whole wheat flour and 2 year old yeast (praying that the little yeasties weren't dead), and baked on for 10 minutes on 400 and it still turned out great.  I only gave 4 stars because of the random tablespoons of water not mentioned in the ingredients list. You will need more than a few tablespoons of water to incorporate the mixture into a ball. I just filled a measuring cup up and poured as I went along.  Yes, it was a bit bland. Just add more salt next time. This is just a very basic bread recipe, nothing fancy.  You can pretty much turn this flat bread into whatever you want. The possibilities are endless. I had fun and will be using this recipe again (with a lot more salt).

Perfect for me. Always looking for fast easy recipes like this and the dough came out perfect. Added sliced pimento olives, pepperoni and folded over for a short version of a stromboli and it came out perfectly with a mere 30 minutes of effort. Thank you.

There is not enough salt in the dough. The 30 minute rising time is insufficient. It will not double in that time.

This is an excellent recipe for this first timer. It was easy and quick. I added just a little bit extra sea salt and olive oil for that deep flavour. The family loved it!! Will experiment with different ingredients to try new flavours.

This is my go to recipe for quick homemade bread.  Comes out great and I am able to add seasonings depending on how I feel.  I am not a breadmaker per se so this one is pretty much foolproof if I can make it and get great results.

Made this 4 times in 3 days! Everyone loves it. Ate it as a side dish, made sandwiches and even made burger buns from it. I added more salt and dried oregano basil and thyme. Put garlic infused oil on top one time which was lovely. Im never buying bread again, going to make two of these everyday. The recipe is only slightly confusing because of adding extra water. I used about 150ml total. One day I made it it was much cooler weather and it did take an extra 10 mins to rise. Overall fantastic recipe.  Love it

Have used this recipe many times and am always pleased with the results. I always add some coarse salt/cracked black pepper/fresh rosemary/fresh Parmesan/olives (or some combination of the five) to the top, just before baking.

Very easy base recipe. Most reviewers don't realize that the amount of water you add to a bread recipe depends on...humidity of your area, of your kitchen, of the flour, etc. It is a "by feel" sort of thing. This recipe definitely needs seasoning, but hey - what bread doesn't? As a base, it is real good and adaptable. If you want more instruction on bread making, go to King Arthur's Bread website. Baking involves chemistry, once you have the basics - then bread recipes make sense. This is a really quick yeast bread recipe that is highly adaptable and very tasty. Thanks for posting it!

Fabulous recipe! I added a little rosemary and garlic powder to the dough and topped it with a little rosemary and parmesan cheese!

My husband is the bread maker in my family and he made this very well.  Sprinkling the top with salt and rosemary makes it salty enough for us.  We also served it with good quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar as a dipping sauce.

I was pleased with how this bread turned out. I put sea salt and minced onion on one half and sea salt and rosemary on the other half to give it more flavor. We preferred the half with minced onion. I made it a second time and used whole wheat flour instead. I mixed 1/2 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp salt, and 3 tsp of minced onions. On the top I sprinkled sea salt and baked for 11 minutes. It was delicious.

We cut some of the salt and added a half packet of Italian dressing mix and some Parmesan. It was incredible.

It's super easy, and I would've given it five stars, but it really has absolutely no flavor at all.  It definitely needs additions to be awesome, but it's got an A+ for user-friendly.

This is the quickest way to have Focaccia bread!  I esed that base recipe and have tried parmessan cheese and rosemary on the top, another with chopped olives and Thyme -absolutely fantastic. If you use the base recipe and no additions it makes a great bread for wine tasting!

Love it. As far as flavor just don't be afraid of throwing in several teaspoons of any herb. I used rosemary, Italian seasoning, basil, and oregano on top of and in the dough. Also, unless you have sodium issues don't skimp on the salt. Who doesn't like flavor?

I'd give this a 4.5 if I could because it was so simple and easy to modify. I added sundried tomatoes to one and garlic and basil to another. came out soft and tasty.

This didn't turn out so good for me. Didn't rise right. Could have been my fault but I found a better recipe on another web site.

I have found this recipe very open to interpretation... the default output is a very good-textured bread with little flavor other than the olive oil and salt on top.  What I have done is add herbs to the mix (rosemary, oregano, etc.).  I have also found that shredded cheese on top makes this absolutely wonderful!

I would have liked to give this 4-1/2 stars. It is a great, easy recipe, but we found the bread (inside) to be blah. The topping, which I added assorted herbs and Parmesan cheese, was really good, but the inside needed to be "herbed-up". Next time I will mix in some of the oregano, rosemary and galic. That should do the trick.

This recipe was really bland.  I added garlic powder and salt to the dough, and i put rosemary, thyme, basil and Parmesan cheese on top, and it still needed more flavor.  Next time i will add some more spices to the dough as well as on top.

Very good and easy.  While I was making it I kept thinking this isn't going to work but the result was a professional looking loaf of focaccia.  Next time I may try adding some herbs to it to give it a bit more flavor.  This was good on it's only - particularly dipped in seasoned olive oil.

Tried and true recipe - its become a standby for me.  I sprinkle the top with dried herbs (italian type) before baking.
