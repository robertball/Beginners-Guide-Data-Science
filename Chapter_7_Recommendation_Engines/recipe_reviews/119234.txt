An easy and filling dish. I like to add a can of beans, any type.

This was good.  I added toasted chopped almonds, raisins, and a few chopped fresh herbs, and stirred them in towards the end of the cook time with the peppers (I like mine a bit crunchier.)  Healthy, hearty, good.  Served with parmesan tilapia from this site.

I finally got around to making this recipe this weekend and despite my initial reservations about combining cabbage and mushrooms together (I don't know why but, in my mind, this seems a bit of an odd combo) it turned out absolutely FANTASTIC!  I made the recipe exactly as instructed.  The barley cooked perfectly--thank you for sharing this recipe.  It is a nice change from rice.

Love this recipe ... the only thing I do different is I double the recipe and I put half the recipe in a slow cooker and put a row of either chicken / pork in the middle and top with the remainder of the recipe and let the slow cooker do the rest ... very good !  I am on maintenance with WW and this recipe is just perfect to make one feel full / satisfied without the fat and calories.

This dish was excellent and best of all very simple.  I used coleslaw mix to simplify things and it worked great. The family really enjoyed this.

I left out the cabbage, mushrooms & basil.  I added more liquid & a bit of cayenne pepper and wow did that kick it up - excellent!  I'll play with it some more, I love it.  I didn't even know I liked barley.

I substituted diced tomatoes for the carrots & zucchini and the juice for some of the chicken broth.  It was delicious!  Savory and low calorie!

This was very good! I used half Bhutanese red rice for half the barley. That was a very good combination! Used red cabbage too, more garlic, salt & pepper, and veggie broth to make it completely veg for my sister in law. It took longer than the time suggested in the recipe for everything to get tender, but that can be the shape of the pot I used (a wide porcelain coated cast iron dutch oven).  We both really liked it. I'll be keeping this one. Edited to add: I forgot to mention, I also added celery and toasted walnuts. Loved those additions!!

While this was reasonably good, I felt like it was missing something.  It wasn't until it was too late to do anything about it that I realized a little wine with the broth would probably be the answer!  I was generous with my vegetables, and I added some toasted almonds to the mixture and topped the dish with them to give some crunch.  I would finely dice the carrots rather than shredding them to give them more texture.   I love barley, and would like to tinker with this a little to make it better.

This is the best barley side dish I have ever had.  I stir fried the vegetables, barley & seasonings, then added the liquid and tossed it all in my rice cooker. It was wonderful but I did need to add a bit more water before the end of cooking time.

Made this exactly according to the recipe.  We liked it OK but felt like it was missing a little something flavor-wise.

Yum, yum, yum!  We really enjoyed this recipe.  Instead of shredded carrots and cabbage, I used 1 cup of broccoli slaw and it was fantastic.  We'll be making this again and again!

Versatile recipe. Good the way it is, but I didn't have some ingredients so I made it beef-based with beef broth. Used thyme and rosemary herbs instead. A dash of Worchestershire and tomato ketchup to round out flavors. Great substitute for rice dishes. Lower on the glycemic index.

I love barley and I love all these ingredients... just didn't quite work for me for some reason. I think the combo of mushrooms and barley didnt appeal to me.   It wasn't bad, but there are other barley recipes I prefer.. It was nice try this one though, thanks

Boy, my husband and I really like this one!  Things I did differently: used olive oil in the place of the vegetable oil, and added an 8 oz. can of sliced mushrooms and a cup of diced fresh tomatoes to use up some stuff I had on hand. Also, I used 3 cups broth instead of 2.5 cups, as I am at high altitude, and it came out perfect.  This will be one I use over and over!

I really enjoyed this, although I just used the vegetables I had on hand. My boyfriend/roommate were unimpressed, I think because of the creamy barley texture. Next time I would make this with rice or quinoa.

I liked this. A good way to use leftover cabbage and a nice alternative to rice or pasta.
