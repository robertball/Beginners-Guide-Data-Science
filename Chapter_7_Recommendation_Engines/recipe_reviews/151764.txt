This would be better if you left out the powdered sugar in the chocolate topping and added a pinch of salt to the caramel mixture..otherwise this is a bit too sweet.

Although this recipe is very rich, it is very good. The pie is like one large pecan caramel cluster. If you like those little candies then you'll love this pie!

This was ok if you like carmels.  Pretty sweet. Wasn't bad by any means but don't know if I would make again. Have had better desserts and pies.

This is so expensive, might as well get a cake at the bakery instead. That's Kraft for you.

This was fabulous.  Everyone enjoyed it for Thanksgiving.  It is more like candy than pie - but wonderful!

This is a wonderful dessert for the holidays!  My family loved it-it tastes more like candy than pie!
