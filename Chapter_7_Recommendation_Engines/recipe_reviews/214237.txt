Added an extra dash of lemon juice to the pineapple mixture. Used 9 x 13 pan and baked for 28 minutes.  Hubby took the cake to work and half was gone BEFORE lunch!  Nice summery dessert.  *To toast coconut, spread coconut on baking sheet and bake at 350 for 10 min.

I have made this cake for years, always getting great reviews.  The only thing I change is to mix in an 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese with the pudding and milk mixture.  It's best when refrigerated overnight, making it great for potlucks.
