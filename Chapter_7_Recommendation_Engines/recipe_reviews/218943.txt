As I was making this recipe I felt that it was missing something. I used chicken broth instead of water to give it more flavor, but it was still bland. I would make this again with more spices to give it more flavor. If anyone else has any suggestions please share.

I make this meal a couple times a month. Our family loves it. I add a can of mild enchilada sauce, leave out the salsa and add 1/4 cup chopped jalapenos, and 1/2 cup shredded cheese. When ready to serve, I sprinkle crushed nacho chips over the top.

I am only giving this 4 stars because I made a few modifications based on other reviews (saying it was bland). Several people said it was bland, so I wanted to spice it up a little. 

Here are the modifiations I made: I completely omitted the water. I used one medium onion, one green pepper, and one red pepper. I used a can of enchilda sauce, a can of chicken broth, and a can of Rotel (the Mexican lime flavored kind). I also used a tad more chili powder and a dash of cayenne. It was very watery (despite using no water), yet did thicken as it sat. I served it with fresh cilantro, Mexican cheese, and tortilla chips. Next time, I will have some limes on hand to squeeze some juice over!! It's very tasty and we enjoyed it very much. The way the original recipe is written is a little confusing, because I was under the impression that everything is mixed together. But step 4 states that you serve the chicken over the rice. I was confused because I thought perhaps you were supposed to remove the chicken before cooking the rice? I cooked it by mixing everything together, and served it in bowls and it was terrific. This is a keeper!!

I used some hot rotel instead of salsa, and of course... black beans!  ate it along with some sour cream on the side.  Always cook my rice with broth...no matter what.

I also added chicken broth instead of water for more flavor.  Along with the corn I added black beans and then made burritos with mixture...pepper jack cheese on top before folding tortilla really gives it a boost.

This was pretty good. I cut way down on the rice, and added garlic. Still seemed like it needed something, just not sure what.

Bland.  I did the recipe just and directed.  It was a bit dry and lacking in flavor.

I made this for my husband for supper. Did not have instant rice, so cooked regular rice in advance. Added enchilada sauce, and put it together nice and fast. It was great! He even had seconds. This goes into the regular rotation - thanks!

Along with using chicken broth instead of water I also used medium salsa instead of mild to give it a little extra zip.

This was a great recipe and made a super large batch!  I did make some changes based on other reviews and added my own twist.  I used 1/2 of a rotisserie chicken for the meat so I started the recipe sauteing the onion and green pepper (I didn't have red peppers).  Once the onions & green pepper were done, I added the shredded white and dark chicken meat.  I increased the chili powder to 2 1/2 Tbsp for more flavor.  I also used chicken bone broth instead of water.  I thought the recipe called for a lot of rice so I cut back the rice to 2 cups instead of 3 (I used 2 cups of bone broth subsequently).  I chopped up and added 2 smaller jalapeno peppers, 1 small can of sliced black olives, and sprinkled Mexican cheese on top allowing it to melt.  I also used extra cilantro and fresh corn off the cob.  When I served it, I added a dollop of sour cream and tortilla chips on the side to scoop up nacho-like.  We like things spicy so I had the Tabasco sauce on the table too.  Absolutely YUMMY!!!  I have A LOT of leftovers because this was just for my hubby and me (and I didn't even use all of the rice!).  I think next time I would cut down the rice to only 1 cup.

Didn't get the correct rice.  Used  Great Value instant brown rice and Knorr instant Spanish Rice.  There was enough for the boys.

It was a little bland so my boyfriend added a glass of white wine and feta cheese and it was fabulous. Other then that just add a few more seasonings if the kids are eating it and it will be great .

This is healthy and delicious!  We make it on the weekend and  place it in freezer containers.  When we reheat it and serve it during the week nights, it's wonderful.

Would not make it again.  It's a pretty dish, but lacked flavor.
