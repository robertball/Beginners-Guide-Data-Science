Holy man these were incredible! My 13 year old daughter made them for her class, she made the recipe as is and I wouldn't change a thing! The batter was thicker than I expected but we just flattened them down slightly before baking for 9 minutes and they were perfect!

I am a sucker for peppermint, this is an amazing recipe! Just the right amount of peppermint flavor, I have a feeling Santa is going to love this come Christmas. Thank you so much for sharing this awesome recipe.
