This is very similar to a receipe I have used for years.  It is very good, but I use fresh cranberries in mine.

Really great!  I used Raspberry Jello instead of Strawberry.  I like the flavor better.  This recipe is great with chopped pecans too!

I made this for our church women's Thanksgiving dinner and it was a big hit.  Even the young children loved it.  I never made a cranberry relish with so much fruit in it, but that is what makes it so good.  I also used raspberry jello. Fabulous recipe!!!!!!!

The 5 stars rating is because DH and eldest daughter loved it with raspberry Jello.  Just as good the 2nd time with cherry Jello, but will do it raspberry next time.  Cut down the sugar to 2/3 cup and it was still too sweet with the jello. Will keep tweaking but its going to be a regular side dish for our special occasion meals.

Loved it. Was messy for me to make, chopped cranberries in a blender! I also decreased the sugar.The end results were absolutely delish. Have made it 4 times over the holidays. My go to from now on.
