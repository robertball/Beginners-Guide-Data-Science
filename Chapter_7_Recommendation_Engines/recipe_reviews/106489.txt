The taste of this was good, but didn't "wow" me.  I used large baby bellas (9 of them) and added a splash of lemon juice but otherwise followed the recipe.  My husband loved it,  but I guess I just need bacon in my stuffed mushrooms because that's the flavor I thought these were missing.  However, I'm still rating these a 5 because of how much my husband liked them and for two other reasons:  1) I never thought to broil the mushroom caps...I always saute them when making stuffed mushrooms.  Broiling them was far easier, quicker, and just as yummy.  2) I usually use bread crumbs but I really liked the Ritz crackers.  I think in the future I'll incorporate those two things into my own stuffed mushroom recipe using bacon in place of the crab.  Thanks for the recipe with those great ideas!

Very nice but could use more seasoning. The cheese I chose didn't melt so well. Would have probably been even better if the cheese was super melty.
