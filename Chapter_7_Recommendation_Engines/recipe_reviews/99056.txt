This is a great recipe for a nut-butter! It has a nice nutty flavor and the cinnamon and cranberries are not overpowering. I was out of fresh ginger so I left it out, but I'm sure it would be good.  Make sure you add the water slowly, as you will probably need less than the recipe calls for. Enjoy!

As a new vegan, I can't wait to try this recipe.  I am, however, concerned about all the emerging news about the dangers of soy.  Input  would be appreciated.

This is really yummy! My intensions were to make this for my son. Well, this never made it past my kitchen much less to his house! :D

I used honey roasted soy nuts and left out the vanilla.  I used organic dried cranberry and blueberry mix instead of just cranberries.  Excellent!  Great on celery!

I used raisins instead of cranberries, 1 tsp. dried ground ginger, and omitted the salt.  I only used 1 cup of water to get the consistency I wanted.  This is good.  I will be making this again!
