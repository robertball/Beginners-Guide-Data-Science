This recipe tasted wonderful and I would recommend any who loves fresh blueberries to try it. I only gave 3 stars because mine did not turn out very scone like. They were very soft and moist, I was just expecting a firmer outside. Mine did not turn out like the picture. The blueberry mixture that is added to the wet ingredients, turned my scones blue. Again, if just rated on taste, these would get 5 stars. My kids (2,4,5,9) loved them. I made them for a tea party thinking that if they were purple it would be okay, but they were an odd blue green color.

These were kind of blah.  I made as is, then put a lemon juice/powdered sugar glaze on them which improved them.  They did spread out a lot for me, so I might try using less butter if I make them again.

Loved this recipe! Turned out much more dense than most scones however. These had a consistency more like a raised pumpkin cookie. Great with a small drizzle of icing. Perfect for breakfast with coffee or as an evening dessert. Will make again!

Absolutely delicious! The only alteration I did to the recipe was to use just a smidge more flour than called for— and they turned out perfectly. They may not be beautiful, but these are the tastiest scones I’ve ever baked!
