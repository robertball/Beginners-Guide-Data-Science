***** I've made this 4 times already. TIP:  The best thing is to use it right away (next day) so it won't become too sticky. The dought i baked today was in the refrig. for 5 days and it was sooooo sticky. Didn't have a problem with the previous ones which i baked the next day. /I made a batch of apple filled (apple pie filling with a little cinnamon) and another batch with nutella and crushed hazelnuts. In my opinion, fruit is the way to go. These were delicious. The kids liked the nutella ones too but i think they were a little too sweet. The Nutella is least likely to "leak" in the oven and they seemed easier to handle when they are still hot. The fruit ones stay softer longer after cooking them so i had to wait a little longer for them to "set" so they could be transfered to the serving dish. No Biggie!! I was just in a hurry and i needed my cookie sheet to bake some more. I love this recipe so much i want to try all kinds of fillings in it. You should try it too!

This dough is super. I had no problems with the consistency or the filling. I used plenty of flour when rolling out and baked on parchment-lined baking sheets. Definitely go with parchment if you want an easy clean up! If you're like me and don't like the hassle of rolling out dough, you can also shape these into 1" balls, then press the balls flat with the bottom of a glass - much less work & mess! Finally, use high-quality preserves for your filling - it will make a difference!

Yum!  This is the first time I've made empanadas, and your dough was fantastic.  I filled them with picadillo (ground beef, potatoes, carrots, etc.) and brushed some egg on top to make them golden brown.  They were a hit.  I used lots of flour when rolling out the dough, as others had suggested, and I floured the wax paper on the cookie sheet so they wouldn't stick (the first batch stuck even to the wax paper).  They weren't ready after 20 minutes so I cooked them for almost 30 and they turned out great.  Thank you for this Christmas Eve hit. Oh, my sister suggests a little bit of salt in the dough.  I liked it as is, though.

excellent!  I filled some with thinly sliced apples tossed with cinnamon, ginger and allspice then added a small chunk of cream cheese.  Another batch I added cream cheese with dried fruits and toasted walnuts and then tried a few filled with peanut butter and jam and another few I put apples and cheddar cheese together.  I found that they were all best eatten slighly cooled out of the oven so the cheese is still gooey but tossed in the microwave the next day for a few seconds give the same effect.

So wonderful! A great starting point for many different filling choices. I bought a 3.5" Cut-and-Seal gizmo from Pampered Chef (no- not affiliated with them in any way).  The device has a spring loaded crimping edge to perfectly seal the pastries.  It makes it easier to get good looking empanadas and speeds up the whole filling process.  It costs less than $10.

First, the dough HAS to stay cold or they don't come together very well.  Made these twice, once with a seedless jam and all the jam came out while baking. The second time I used chopped up apple pie filling.  That was a total success!!  Took these to a Spanish Club dinner and they disappeared!  Glad I snacked on a couple before I left home.

This recipe deserves 10 STARS! You need to allow yourself plenty of time to put them together. The result is well worth it!! Make sure you moisten the inside edge of one half of the circle before seal it then pinch it. I rolled the finished cookies in cinnimon-sugar mix. I took these to a Christmas party and they were THE HIT COOKIE! Thankfully I made a double batch!

These were very good! You should double or even triple the recipe though. Also to add a little more flavor to the pastry, when you roll it out on flour add a little powdered sugar to the flour to make it sweeter. My family loved these and my boyfriend said these are better than the ones his Grandma used to make.

Absolutely wonderful.  I wondered about the cream cheese in the dough, but was very pleased with the results.  If you double the batch, just use 1/2 the dough at a time so that it will not get to soft to work with.

The smell is better than any candle you will ever buy!  I made cream cheese pumpkin empanadas.  My tortilla press broke but found that parchment paper worked great with a cool dough and I used my kids Play-Dough cutter for a pretty scalloped edge.....delicious!  *BIG TIP: snip an "X" shape in the top of your empanada with scissors right before you pop it into the oven to keep the filling from splatting out of the seams.

I was short on time but couldn't find a reviewer who had attempted to make these without refrigerating the dough overnight.  But I did it anyway and they turned out great! Here's how:  After making the dough, wrap in plastic and chill in fridge for 30 minutes.  Using a generous amount of flour on your surface, rolling pin and the dough itself, roll out gently -- being careful to always re-flour as it will get sticky if you don't (because you haven't chilled it overnight).  I was also surprised at how much of the sugar/cinnamon mixture these absorbed after coming out of the oven looking a bit dry. No way! They were coated!    I used Nutella for filling. Next time I'll use 5" circles because Nutella is so rich that this could have used a higher dough-to-filling ratio. :)  SIMPLY YUM!

This recipe is great and the dough is out of this world! I have made these two times now and both times were wonderful. The first time used jelly and cream cheese mixture. The second time (which I liked best) I used only the cream cheese mixture - 1 package of cream cheese, 1 egg, and 1/3 cup of sugar. On about half we mixed in mini chocolate chips, and dip in cinn/sugar. The cream cheese mixture was a favorite! Thanks, will use again and again!

I have never had empanadas before, let alone tried to make them. I'm no connoisseur, but I can tell you I loved these! They're lovely for dessert or even in the morning with a cup of tea. So glad I made a double batch. I followed the recipe exactly (except I used apple pie filling instead of preserves) and it was incredibly easy. The dough was gorgeous. I didn't have trouble with it being too sticky, but I did find that as the extra dough sat out and was handled more, the finished crescents didn't stay closed as nicely in the oven. Next time I will pop the extra dough back in the fridge while I fill the first round, rather than keeping it out on the counter.   Thanks for the recipe, Rosina. I'll definitely be making these again.

These turned out great! on an accidental miscalculation I ended up quadrupling the recipe.  The dough is not unmanageable, just use lots of flour on your tools and rolling surface. I did not have a cookie cutter so I used a glass, sealed them with a little water and pinched them shut with a fork. I made most of them with a simple apple pie filling.  I just chopped up the apples much smaller than I would for pie.  The rest I filled with fruit preserves.  I found the apple pie did not leak at all while the fruit preserve filling was very leaky when cooked.  Since I had so many leftovers I just froze the prepared but unbaked remainders.  I cook them from frozen just adding a few additional minutes. They turn out just as good as the fresh ones!

Delicious empanadas!  Some of the reviews made me a little concerned about the difficulty in preparation but it was a cinch!  I'm the kinda girl who HATES rolling out cookie dough but I really wanted to make these to surprise my hubby so I decided to give it a try.  I doubled the recipe and mixed until the dough came together.  It was a touch sticky and I was in a hurry so I took 1/4 of it and threw the rest in the freezer wrapped in foil.  I floured my surface and rolled it out.  Used a 3 inch biscuit cutter and filled with a heaping teaspoonful of mango preserves or pineapple preserves.  I wet the edges with water on my finger and closed them up.  Brushed with egg wash and baked for exactly 20 minutes.  I thought I must be fooling myself into believing that I'd really done it without a hitch but alas...  it worked perfectly!

Huge hit!  I loved these!  I used half Smuckers Finest Apple Cinnamon Preserve and the other half was same brand but Triple Berry.  Both were delicious and chunky - I didn't have the issue of jam oozing out while baking.  I will also add that I used the pampered chef "cut-n-seal" and highly recommend it!  No, I don't sell pampered chef ;).  But it made it super easy and you don't have to moisten the edges or anything just fold and press.  I personally liked the apple flavor best, tasted just like a mini apple pie, yum!  I didn't roll out the dough either, I'm all about baking short cuts and there really is no need to roll it out, I just pressed it with my hands and it worked perfectly.  I will say to be sure to get the dough somewhat thin, otherwise it will be too much dough and not enough filling.  I also doubled the recipe and it made about 27 of them.  So yummy and I will DEFINITELY be making these again very soon!!!

So there is no such thing as a 3oz package of cream cheese.  I used 8oz package of cream cheese, 2 cups or gradually added sifted flour and 1/4cup more of softened butter and they came out perfect. Right out of the oven I tossed them in sugar/cinnamon mixture.   I used a drinking cup to cut the rounds and it made about 24.  The crust is delicious.  Will make again.

This was one of the best tasting and easiest new cookie recipes I have ever tried. I made them for a party and everyone loved them. I put in a little peanut butter and chocolate chips to make a change and it worked wonderfully just like the preserves.

these were very yummy. they looked prettier with the cinnamon and sugar than the powdered sugar. I also recommend rolling them in the cinnamon sugar mixture before baking. I did both strawberry and raspberry jam. They were equally good. Also they do not fit much jam in them. It will start to come out. I recommend sealing edges with a fork to make them prettier.

Deeeeelicious! The dough is excellent and could be filled many different ways. Here's what I did after reading other reviews: divide dough in 2 smaller balls before chilling overnight. Only take one out at a time (you have a fairly narrow window between too hard and too sticky to work with).  If you don't like wrestling with the rolling pin you can do what I did - roll into 1 inch ball and use the bottom on a cup or small plate to flatten. them. SO easy! I filled some with chopped up apple pie filling with cinnamon and the other with canned pumpkin with pumpkin pie spice and brown sugar. Both were outstanding for a fall season treat. Be sure to roll them in the cinnamon sugar right away - before they cool! They are best served warm. Great recipe! Thanks for posting it Rosina!

This dough was AMAZING. I used it the same night I made it (I refrigerated it for about an hour or 2) and it worked GREAT. I didn't even need water to seal the edges - I just folded one side over and pressed it in with a fork. 
To make it healthier I did use 1/3 fat cream cheese, and half all-purpose flour with half whole-wheat flour. It still came out amazing! I also mixed 1 egg with a splash of milk and brushed both sides of each empanada with it before baking. I placed parchment paper on the cookie sheet to keep them from sticking and baked them for about 25 minutes.
I doubled the recipe but it still only made about 10 empanadas... maybe I made them too big? I filled them with a meat mixture instead (olive oil, diced onions, garlic, diced mushrooms, ground turkey, paprika, cumin, garlic powder, red wine vinegar, shredded gruyere cheese), so maybe that's why they were bigger than they were supposed to be? Either way, they were DELICIOUS and I will definitely be making them again. A note - if you make them with a meat filling, make sure to let your meat mixture cool before making them!!! Also, I didn't use the sugar or cinnamon, since I didn't make these as a dessert. I'm tempted to try using this dough for the pie crust in the mushroom pie recipe on this site!
Thanks for this recipe!

EDIT (12/8/08): Ok i made them again this time using 3/4 whole wheat flour and 1/4 all-purpose flour. They came out just as great! Next time I'm going to try using all whole wheat pastry flour

If i could rate this recipe for more then 5 stars i would!These pastries are so Delicious!Once they cook you can't even tell that there is cream cheese in the mixture ,they taste so buttery if anything something about the cream cheese that make them incredibly good and flaky Yum!Just make sure you flour your board before you roll your dough so it won't stick and make sure your empanadas are sealed so the filling won't spill.

Wow!  It is a mystery to me how a pastry dough with so few ingredients could be so wonderful.  I am in love with this dough and will probably use it for a lot of things, including pies, in the future.  It came out wonderfully delicate and almost melts in your mouth.  I made these empanadas with cherry and apple pie filling.  The cherry ones were good, but the apple ones were AMAZING!  I simply chopped the cherries and apples up into smaller chunks, and made the empanada rounds a bit bigger than the recipe called for so I could squeeze more pie filling in there!  
I found it a bit hard to roll the bigger empanadas in the cinnamon sugar, so for the second batch, I simply coated a spare cookie sheet with a dusting of cinnamon sugar and when the empanadas were done, I transferred them to the coated sheet and then sprinkled the tops with cinnamon sugar as well.  
These were a HUGE hit at my Super Bowl Fiesta and I will be making them again in the near future.

*Tip - I found that the cherry pie filling oozed out of the seams on the first batch.  For the second batch, I wetted the outside edge of the bottom, crimped the two edges together with the tines of a fork, then rolled the edges (much like you do for a pie crust) then crimped them again with the fork.  I then pierced the tops with the fork to let steam escape.  May seem like overkill, but the cherry pie filling did not leak at all after using this method.

These are so good. The dough always comes out so flaky. I've only made fresh apple ones and they are yummy. I'm wondering if any one has used this as a pie crust. Tip: When you pull them out of the oven quickly get them off the baking sheet or flip them over so they don't stick to the pan.

I am a college student and I made these for my Spanish class. My Spanish teacher (who is from Argentina) loved them. He couldn't believe that I actually made them. He asked me for the recipe so he could have his wife make them. I thought the dough was really easy to work with. The whole thing was so simple to put together. I am going to make these for Christmas and New Years.

I am in the middle of making these for the 2nd time in 2 weeks.  Fabulous!  They're not much to look at, but boy are they good.  They are like tiny little pieces of pie.  I got rave reviews on them.  They are a little more work than a standard cookie, but I noticed I got faster at it the 2nd time around.  USE PARCHMENT PAPER to line your cookie sheet, no mess to worry about!

These little dessert cookies disappeared faster than the main course. I rolled them extremely thin, but next time I might make them a bit thicker. I used raspberry pie filling instead of jam (tastier), and rolled them in cinnamon and sugar right out of the oven (used a spoon so i didn't get burned).  I'd like to try the dough with a savory filling next.  Excellent.

DELICIOUS!  The dough is very delicate with a lovely cream cheese flavor.  I also use the dough to make thumbprint cookies.  My students LOVE them!

Delicious!  The key is not to overfill these with jam, as the jam will leak out while baking.

My son and I made these for a class project and they were gone in seconds!
I used peach preserves, but I'm sure any type of canned pie filling would work
just as well.  The kids and the teacher want to know when I'm going to make
some more!

Made these for the first time the other day for a group dinner and everyone loved them!   The only thing I really didn't care for was the preserves...the ones with pie filling were much better.  The ones with preserves tended to leak out and you just didn't feel like you had enough "umph" to them...but people could not stop talking about them. 

I did triple the recipe and was very glad I did!  :)

This is an easy and delish recipe.  The dough is flaky and tastes fantastic.  I was skeptical of the cream cheese, but clearly this combination works!  You don't taste the cream cheese in it at all - it is a wonderful pie dough. In fact, I fully intend to make a pie using this for crust.  I made three different kinds: apple pie filling, pineapple preserves, and strawberry preserves.  I liked the pineapple the best, but everyone else raved over the apple pie filling.  I made a double batch and was glad I did.  The recipe doesn't make much and when I doubled it I had some left over.  The dough stayed in the fridge fine for five days.  I actually thought it was easier to work with after it sat for a couple of days.  The key is that the dough MUST be very cold.  I plan to try making a savory one with ham and cheese.  I am going to try to make it with very thinly sliced deli ham and cheese from a wedge of laughing cow swiss.  I can almost taste it now.  Make this recipe!!!  You won't be sorry.

I did not like this dough. It came out way too flaky for my taste. It's better for pastry empanadas, than savory ones.

These were wonderful!!! Made a double batch, and took them to work, gone at the turn of my back. Got rave reviews!! I found out after you seal them if you turn up the edge a little it helps with not so much leakage. This is a keeper for sure. Thanks so much for the recipe.

Delicious!!! I made these last night for my son's second grade class as they are studying Mexico.  The dough was very easy to work with and didn't have to use a pinch of flour to roll it out.  Even my 7 and 4 yr old boys were rolling out the dough with no problem!  I tripled the recipe and got about 40 empanadas.  I used "Comstock more fruit" apple filling that I bought at Safeway.  I used water for the edges and got no leakage at all.  No mess in the oven, just follow the recipe exactly as it says.  I took me about 1.5 hours to form the empanadas because I had little helpers I had to watch.  Just have a glass of wine while you are making them...no stress at all!

I thought this was a great quick and easy recipe. I did not double the batch because I had never made them before ... and they did not last long at all! I have been telling everyone I know about this recipe! I really liked it and so did everyone else at our Cinco de Mayo celebration.

I followed the recipe exactly to the instructions but the dough was so sticky.  I ended up having to add more flour in order to make it workable.  It was also better for me to make little balls and flatten each ball individually with a rolling pin.  But everyone at the house loved the results!

Easy and yummy. I made half with choc. chips as the filling and half with homemade raspberry jam. Both were excellent. I wouldn't change a thing except to advise that you dip your fork in flour when crimping the edges so the dough doesn't stick to the tines.

These are great!  Though I was only able to make 17 rather than 32 and I used a 3" biscuit cutter and rolled the dough to about 1/8" thick.  I had no problems with the preserves oozing out since I put a teaspoon on preserves in the middle.  I also rushed the chilling but putting the dough in the freezer for about an hour and then letting it sit for about 10 minutes on the counter.  The dough was quite sticky but I just rolled it in a little flour until it wasn't sticky anymore and it worked great.  All in all these are delicious and I look forward to making them again and again.

Amazing! I filled some with cheese and hot dog, cheese and ham, nutella, raspberry jam from trader joe's, pepperjack cheese. All were wonderful. The only combo i didn't like was chocolate and peanut butter. These are also great frozen, and baked when company comes by. A very good last minute appetizer. Definite crowd pleaser. Got rave reviews from everybody!

To avoid leakage you have to poke holes at the top with a fork, my grandmother has always poked holes on the top and they never leak. Good recipe! Try different fillings, pineapple, cherry, sweet potato, apple...so yum! :)

Excellent recipe- My mom and I have been making these for our annual Cinco de Mayo party for 6 years now. We have to quadruple the recipe if we want to have leftovers, and they always turn out perfect! Best with peach preserves, we have tried strawberry and pineapple too but they aren't nearly as good. We use some cornstarch with water to brush the edges of the circles to help them stick together, and press the edges closed using our fingers not a fork for the prettiest presentation. A lot of work but well worth it!

I have been searching for an empanada recipe like my mom used to make for quite awhile now.  She made everything from memory and since she's passed, I can't ask her.  But all the ingredients and steps seem the same... the picture looks like hers... I can't wait to try it!

Wow, I was really surprised by this.  Once cooked, any hint of cream cheese was gone.  People actually said it was like a butter cookie crust.    Will definitely keep this in mind for other recipes.

Excellent recipe! Made as directed using peach/apricot preserves and the little gadget from pampered chef. Also used home made diced apple pie filling which turned out yummy also. The cinnamon sugar coating is a must - so good!

i followed this recipe exactly and they all turned out like authentic empanadas..however i thought that my dough was a bit to thin and it wasnt as flaky.So next time im probably going to use the Best Flaky Pie Crust as my dough for the empanadas. Apricots were my filling.  Def. going to save this recipe for next time!  imade the empanadas the same day i made the dough i out the dough in the freezer for about 1hours and them 2hours in the refri. then took it out and waited for 30mins to roll it-the dough was pretty easy to work with.

Pretty good, the dough was easy to work with and came out nice and flaky. Was a bit messy afterwards only because a lot of my filling leaked out during baking.

JUST AMAZING!!! Instead of fruit preserve I boiled up a sweet potatoe smashed it with a lil heavy cream butter and cinnamon for a filling. I swear I was in Mexico visiting my favorite "panderia"(bake shop).

Reading some of the reviews made me hesitant to try this recipe, but it turned out flawless!  The only thing I noticed is that the quantity of preserves is almost twice more than you need.  I didn't double the recipe.  When I was ready to make the empanadas, I separated the dough into 12 small balls, and used my hands and thumbs to press and shape them.  I didn't submit a photo, but you can't tell the difference between mine and some of these other gorgeous photos.  Again, great recipe!  Thanks!

These were yummy.  We'll make them again for sure.  I found it easier to roll out small balls of dough one at a time, than it is to roll out the entire ball of dough and use a cookie cutter.  I used thicker baker's filling rather than jelly and didn't have any problems with the filling running out.

The dough is extremely easy to make, and it also tastes delicious! I used Neufchâtel cream cheese, which is slightly lower in fat than regular cream cheese. You can find Neufchâtel in most grocery stores, including Safeway. Neufchâtel and regular taste very similar, and can be used interchangeably, but Neufchâtel is a lot softer (which makes it easier to work with). I filled the empanadas with canned pumpkin, but I accidentally forgot to add anything to it so I had to roll the empanadas in a LOT of sugar/cinnamon mixture when they got out of the oven.  I also used one beaten egg to brush the tops before I put the empanadas in the oven. Oh, and I had no trouble with the dough being sticky or the filling seeping out.  The key is not to be overly ambitious with the filling- fill in moderate amounts, seal the dough well, and press the edges with the fork to ensure that the edges stick well (also makes nice patterns).

I only had a little bite but I had made them for a cinco de mayo party and they were a hit. I used apple pie filling instead of jam got the idea from other reviews but they were a hit. Just next time I will make them alittle bigger and egg wash them before baking so they can be alittle crunchy.

This recipe was fabulous!  I made these for a Mexican-food themed Super Bowl Party, and they turned out great.  I made the dough in the morning, so it was only refrigerated for a few hours.  I was expecting it to be sticky, but found it very easy to work with after it sat out for a short period of time; only had to add a little flour.  When I started rolling, the ball was still quite hard-maybe that's the difference?  I filled them with apple pie filling and rolled them in cinnamon sugar.  Yum!

These were a huge hit at my fiesta themed halloween party. i doubled the batch. the dough is very sticky-at first i thought i wouldn't be able to roll it out. i had to keep adding flour as i rolled it but it worked out great. i used a drinking class to cut the circles as i didn't have a round cookie cutter. I would suggest having someone help you when you roll out the dough because as it gets warmer it gets hard to work with. I made 1/2 cinnamon sugar and 1/2 powdered sugar-all cinnamon sugar were gone and had 5 powdered left. would definitely make all cinnamon sugar next time. Great easy recipe to make-will definitely make again!

MAKE DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE BATCH. there just isn't enough for how fast they will go. i used pumpkin filling (my husband's favorite)and had the dough in the fridge for 2 days before using it and it was easy to work with once i started rolling it out. i used a lot of flour in the process, as suggested, and had no problems with sticking. i think someone mentioned a bit of salt in the dough, which i might throw in next time, but just a pinch. the only problem? i wound up with only eleven empanadas and get this: right before baking, a crew of workers who were fixing a transformer in my backyard sat down outside to watch the world cup with my husband. not enough to go around! i'll do this a lot, i'm sure - thanks!

These little cookies are fabulous.  They are so much work though.  Toward the end I got better at keeping the filling in, I made a double batch.  To those of you making them for the first time, yes, the dough is sticky.  Be sure to use plenty of flour on your surface and rolling pin.  I filled them with strawberry guava jam (yum).  As wonderful as they are, I don't know if I will be making them again too soon.  Trying to clean the cookie sheet after the filling leaks out and then burns is not a lot of fun.

I wanted to lighten these up with less fat, so I used margerine instead of butter and I also used a low fat cream cheese in the dough. I kept it in the fridge for 5 days and it was sticky to work with when I rolled it out. I kneaded in another 1/2 cup of flour till it wasn't sticky anymore. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU USE BUTTER FOR THE DOUGH. I makes the dough firm as it gets cold in the fridge. But I must say that these were absolutely delicious! Will definitely make again. I added raspberry and strawberry jam filling. A few things that I learned are 1) If there is too much jam filling it will leak during baking, and 2) roll the enpanada into the sugar/cinnamon mixture BEFORE baking - you get more sugar on the dough and it'll have a nice crunch after it's baked. Thanks for sharing a wonderful recipe, Rosina!

I made these for my Mom;s birthday dinner(we did a mexican theme meal) and they were fantastic! I stuffed some with apples and a cinnamon caramel sauce and some with Banana'a and caramel. They were sooooo yummy!! A press helps best to keep from leaking but does pretty good without them if your use a thicker/chunkier filling

Good taste, not too sweet.  I used lemon filling, and dusted with powdered sugar.  The dough was prepared exactly as directed, but was extremely difficult to work with.  I had to shape them completely by hand.  Not pretty,  but tasty.

I did not have time to make the dough and let it chill overnight.  I put it in the freezer for about 10 minutes and it was fine.  I filled them with chopped fried apples seasoned with cinnamon, allspice, ginger, brown sugar and a splash of lemon juice.  These were a BIG hit with the kids.  The crust was very flaky and overall they were easy and fun to make!

I love this recipe!! I've made it with apple pie filling, mashed sweet potatoe with cinnamon and sugar, and vanilla pudding. Make sure to brush the edge before sealing with water to seal right. Also brush top of empanada with an egg and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar. This gives a nice color. I bake them for about 30 min. Great recipe!!!

I made half of them with apple pie filling, and the rest with raspberry preserves and confectioner's sugar (the latter were better). I didn't have any problem working with the dough. Nevertheless, I think the crust would be more suitable for savory mini pies, and not sweet ones. To me it seemed a little too floury and would definitely go better with cheese, vegetables and spices.

This recipe took a bit of effort & if you're not careful the dough can come out fragile or soggy. All in all, people looooved them. I did rasberry w/ powdered sugar & others w/ apple pie filling w/ the cinnamon sugar. Yum!!!A hit at my Mexican themed dinner party!

This was sooo yummy! so much so, this is my frist review for any recipe on this site.  i made this for mother's day and filled them with apricot preserves and it was so good. it is a delicate dough so expect it to be gooey and sticky.  i did use about 1/2 cup more flour and it still turned out great.  be careful to not overfill them if not the filling will leak out. i would also suggest to make them a little bigger, or double the ingredients so you can make more.

WOW, these are awesome! I made them last night and they just sounded too easy to be good, but they are easy AND good! The crust is so light and flaky and has a wonderful flavor.  I made them again today, only I didn't even refrigerate the dough. I just rolled it into balls, flatted them into circles on a cookie sheet, put a spoonful of pie filling on top, and flattened out another circle of dough and sealed it over the top. They baked up just fine. Thanks for the great recipe!

Added a bit of vanilla and dash of salt to the dough.  The secret to getting them to seal is to do just as you would with eggrolls or pie dough.  Water. Wet the edges with water and then fold and seal.  I made and used a chopped apple pie type filling. These are fabulous!! Oh, and really, 1 tsp of filling is all you need!

This only problem with this recipe is that it doesn't make enough!  The dough is easy and delicious - for stickiness just work in a little bit of flour.  I made Pumpkin Empanadas and they were the best.  For the filling:  1 cup pumpkin, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 t. cloves, 1/2 tsp vanilla.  Stir and set aside while you're working on the dough.  Tastes better than the pumpkin empanadas at your favorite panaderia!  As my hubby ate his first one, his comment was 'Can you make these bigger'?

Terrific!!!!!! these were a hit in my home, filled with apple pie filling instead of jam. I would add a bit more flour next time, just because the dough was too soft when i was trying to seal the edges of the empanadas. Omg, these are so goooooood, make sure you don't add too much filling otherwise it will leak out!!!!!!!! THANK YOU :D

NB: I didn't go for the whole recipe, so this review is just for the dough, that was sticky, but rolled out like a dream with plenty of flour. Very flaky and tasty dough. My daughter is not very fond of crusts, but she loved this and couldn't get enough.

I tried other recipes for emanadas and have to say this was by far the best one. My family and I enjoyed making and eating them. We will add them to our holiday meals.

I made these empanadas for apple day at my daughters school, your not kidding when you say they disappear.  All the first graders really ate them up.  I used the dough recipe but only got about a dozen from each recipe, I made the dough thicker because I used an apple pie filling that I mashed up and put caramel sauce in so I needed the dough to be thicker.  They baked up beautifully and tasted great rolled in cinnamon and sugar.  My grandma always made empanadas but used shortening in her dough and filled them with sweet potato filling they were good but I like your dough better Rosina.

I agree with everyone the dough is flaky similiar to that of a pastry.  I did find them to be a little sweet.  I would try and go lighter on the sugar and will definitely try pie filling for more flavor.  They look very pretty!

These empanadas tasted good but too small and messy. I also found the dough rather hard to work with. I don't think I will be making these again, sorry

I doubled the recipe and put one teaspoon vanilla in the dough. Used seedless blackberry preserves for a rich flavor. These are delicious. My kids and husband went crazy over them.

The crust was suprisiingly excelent.  Very tender and flaky.  When I saw there was cream cheese in the crust I had to wonder but it was great.  I did have a problem with the filling while baking.  It all seeped out.  I don't know if I did something wrong or if that is just the way they are supposed to be.  Overall, Yummy!

Fill them up with jelly, and don't expect too many cookies per batch.  But the results are heavenly and well worth the trouble.

I used this at a culture fair bake sale in my high school. It took a lot of time for us to make but it was definitely worth it in the end. I would recommend using battered egg yolk instead of water to seal the edges. Also I would use a larger cookie cutter to try and keep the fruit from leaking. It doesn't make quite as much as it say it will either but it's definitely an all around favorite of mine.

Thank you for this recipe.  I just served it to my extended family for dessert on Mothers Day and everyone liked it. I didn't have the ingredients on hand to make the pastry the day/night prior so let it set up in the fridge for about 4-5 hours then used it immediately after removing from the fridge.  It seemed to work out fine, but I'd make sure to allow for extra chilling time if I expected warmer weather.  I used peach jam and sprinkled the empanadas with the cinnamon-sugar mix before baking instead of rolling tm after baking.  This keeps the final product from being too sweet.  Thanks again!

Yum! I refrigerated the dough overnight, so it was very hard when I took it out, but once it sat on the counter for about 30 minutes, it rolled out very easily. I would like the dough to be a bit sweeter, but with the cinnamon/sugar it was fine. I made 3 different kind using canned apple pie filling, canned strawberry pie filling and chocolate chips. I liked the apple best, but my kids liked the chocolate. I will be making these again.

So quick and easy. I used Trader Joes Cherry Preserves with Fresh Cherries for the filling. The recipe does not make 1.5 dozen unless you make them with a very small cookie cutter.

The dough is very "sticky" when it gets warmer, easier to work with if you flour your hands, cutting board, and rolling pin. I kept placing unused portion in fridge until I was ready for the next piece. This helped...I made gingerbread men cut outs and put the filling between the two pieces. Rolled in white and green sugar. Delicious and seasonal...

Terrific! My son rated them 4.5 stars only because nothing is perfect. We doubled the recipe and cut the dough into 3 inch circles and made mini empanadas for Fiesta day at school. For the filling we used canned cherry pie filling and canned raspberry cake filling. They tasted better while still warm, but we took them to school the day after baking and they were a big hit even at room temperature.  I was not sure how to store them, given the cream cheese and butter, but we kept them at room temperature with no issues.  These empanadas were great and we will definately make them again.

The dough is sooo good! My choice of fillings was not the greatest. I used refried beans and cheese because I didn't have anything else and also some cheap strawberry preserves. But even so it was still good! My bf said I wish we could have these all the time! I'll make them again soon with some better fillings.

Made exactly as recipe stated. I didn't care too much for the preserve filling and it leaked all over the place. I think the one reviewer had a good suggestion in cooking down the preserves a bit before baking. I crimped pretty well and didn't overstuff and they still leaked out. I think next time I will use apple pie filling. I think that would be fabulous.

The dough was very easy for me to work with. I didn't have any sticking problems as some reviewers have stated. Very unusual to use cream cheese, but it turned out great.

Very good, but I changed it slightly.  I used canned pie filling (Cherry and Apple)  I was a challange to seal up the empanda so it wouldn't leak when baked.  I only had a couple that totally held tight and it felt like I was scrimping on filling.  It doesn't really matter once there are cooled, but it looks better when they don't leak.

Wow! These are spectacular! I made these thinking to myself, these seem to be too easy to make that they must not be delicious, but I tried it anyways and boy was I wrong. They are delicious and my family absolutely loved them! Thanks so much for the recipe! They were a hit at a party, gone in minutes!

These are absolutely delicious.  Double or triple the recipe, make the circles larger and don't overfill. Make sure they are sealed well to avoid filling spreading out during baking.

Tastes great, like a cross between a danish and a snickerdoodle, but they can be messy to make with all the jelly. I used a mixture of whole wheat and white flour and no one knew the difference.

Yummy! I used homemade apricot filling for these. I doubled the recipe and used a 2 inch cutter, it made 60 cookies. For those that had seepage, cook your filling on medium-high heat to allow some liquid to evaporate and thicken the fruit. This is a delicate dough and is supposed to be handled lightly with not a lot of flour added when rolling, it is to be slightly sticky to help the empanadas stay together.

Always a hit whenever I've made them.  People especially love the crust - so what I do with the extra dough is turn them into little 'fingerprint' cookies.  After all of my empanadas have been cut out, I make little round cookies with the remaining dough, press them down flat, stick my thumb into the centers to make a little well for whatever fruit filling I'm using - then cook just a little bit shorter than the actual empanadas.  I also dust some of the sugar mixture once cooked - so yummy and no wasted dough to boot!

I made the pastry per the recipe the night before assembling in the morning.Rather than preserves, I used my own canned spiced peaches, about 1 1/2 slices per empanada. I also did not fold them over, rather, using 2 1/2" biscuit cutter and pressed a top round to a bottom round. The pastry is light and durable for preserves or sliced fruit. My oven baked them in 18 mins. Pretty dessert bites to compliment my Paella dinner for guests tonight. Thank you!

These were so good! I followed the directions exactly and had no problems. I think the key to keep them from leaking out is to use a very conservative amount of filling.(one teaspoon at most) We used nutella, apple pie filling, and apricot perserves. They were so good, I will make them again!

I used the All Day Apple Butter from this site as a filling and then coated them with cinnamon and sugar to make an unbelievable dessert.  These were gone almost instantly.  I took some into work along with a whole bunch of other things I baked and these were the first to go.

These are excellent! Next time I'll  double the dough mixture. I got (6) 4" empanadas, using a dough press set, worked great! I used peach preserves and raspberry, then rolled in cinnamon sugar, and they are TDF! I also rolled the dough out on parchment with plenty of flour, placed on parchment lined baking sheet, then set back in the fridge for about  20 minutes,  then baked. So good, I can't wait to try other combinations.

Finished product tasted good..but soooooo messy and difficult to make! The directions were simple, but my dough was sticky and hard to work with. They didn't look pretty, but tasted good. Going to search for a better recipe.

I had our neighbors over for dinner and made the Enchilada Casserole II on this site, along with a taco salad.  I made these empanadas for dessert.  I made half with apple pie filling and the rest with seedless raspberry jam.  They were very good, served with vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Great! I made a double batch and fill half with G. beef and potatoes and the other with apple pie filling. It made about 20 medium sized empanadas. Yum! Definitely moisten the edges, it helps them stick so much easier. As suggested I also increased my baking time to about 30min and brushed them with egg. Delicious!

these were excellent. I tried using apple pie filling like some people suggested but had a hard time with keeping it inside the dough so I switched to fruit perserves and it worked much better. rolled in cinnamon and sugar. I made a double batch of the dough so I'll be making the second batch in the next few days - will try the confectioners sugar.

This was a hit at a Chilean dinner party that I attended. I filled some of these with chopped up apple pie filling and tossed in cinnamon and sugar. The others I filled with pear preserves and tossed in powdered sugar. The apple filled ones were the best. I brought home an empty container, was looking forward to some leftovers.  :)

These were very good the second time because I did have trouble with the stickiness of the dough the first time I tried this recipe. I went ahead and made them immediately this time without refrigerating. I used homemade apricot preserves and the dough turned out flaky and tasty.

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I found some pineapple/apricot preserves to use as a filling.  I took them to a Mexican-themed party and they were a huge hit.  They are flaky and tender--I will make them again!!  Thanks!

I used this recipe for the pastry but didnt use the filling. I doubled it but used an 8oz pkg of cream cheese. It sat in my fridge for 2 days and when I went to roll it out it wasnt sticky at all in fact it was like a brick.  Not to worry it became easier to work with in time.  The dough rolled out great but I think I should've rolled it a little thinner. I used a savory filling of my own concoction.  They baked up beautifully and were rich and flaky.  I'll use this dough for other things as well and will also try the filling for this recipe.  Thanks for the pastry recipe!

I had problems with the dough. I just couldn't get it to fold right and I didn't roll it out because I would have needed to use way more flour and I wanted to try and use the recipe exactly. I ended up having to a spoonful of dough on the baking sheet and instead of folding it over I put the fruit right in the middle and just didn't cover it up. I then sprinkled the cinamon and sugar over it. It still turned out to be very delicious, just a different look to it.

This are really good. I made them for my son's b-day party, instead of sweet ones I use swiss cheese and spinach, they turned out amazing....TIP: I had to add some salt to it, because the first round of them did not had any flavor. After I added the salt they where excellent. Thanks for the great recipe.

These were so much fun to make and it  introduced my grand children to a new desert. We made one batch with cherry pie filling and one with apple pie filling. We sprinkled the apple empanadas with the cinnamon sugar and the cherry with powdered sugar. This is great recipe for teaching kids to bake and thy love it.

These were amazing.  I made these for a Mexican food themed party we had last night, and reading the other reviews I decided to triple the recipe since we were having a lot of people over.  I used a 3 inch cup to cut the circles and I don't know what I did differently but I got nearly twice the amount out of the dough.  Also, I had no problem rolling it out, I didn't even use that much flour.  I let it sit out for half an hour then started rolling, it was pretty hard when I first started though.  I used half apple pie filling and half peach pie filling.  More of the apple got eaten, and I think they were better too.  Didn't have too much of a problem with leaking, the ones that did were because I overfilled them.  But these were amazing!  Easy to make (though a bit time consuming), and they tasted wonderful after they were done.  This is one of the best tasting things I've made.  My husband wouldn't even let anyone take any of the leftovers home!  Thanks for the recipe.

Tasted like the hungarian cookies my grandmother used to make for me while I was growing up. These are not overly sweet. The dough doesn't over power the jam. Try different jams, I used raspberry and OMG they came out awsome. The whole batch was gone. I also used apricot jam. Try applebutter, bet you they'd be awsome too. (Jellies do not work in these.)

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't have trouble handling the dough. I did use plenty of flour when I rolled it out to cut the circles.
I had the same problem as a few of the other reviewers.... the jam escaped from the dough while they were baking. This caused the pastries to stick to the pan and most of them broke apart when I tried to get them up. What we could eat was tasty.

Yum, yum, yum. I've made these a bunch of times and I LOVE them. My favorite is to fill them with teeny diced apples with cinnamon and sugar, and roll them in cinnamon sugar. The dough can get pretty sticky so I usually divide it into several portions and keep the remainder refrigerated. I also flour quite liberally when rolling the dough out, which hasn't affected the way they bake that I can tell.

Only used the dough--used it to make bacon egg & cheese and sausage egg & cheese empanadas for a tailgate.  They all went...rather quickly!

this dough recipe is incredible! I made two different batches over Thanksgiving weekend, and have been mandated to bring empanadas to future gatherings :O)

husband and I are thinking that because there is no seasoning in the dough, it can be used for more than just fruity fillings – we plan to experiment with meat fillings, possibly even pizza sauce.

This is by far the best empanada recipe that I have ever tried. I have made them with sweet fillings, but also with meats and cheeses. My kids like the pizza filling the best.

Very addicting!  I did follow the advice of other reviews - using fork tines to seal, lots of flour, and not a lot of preserves.   I didn't have regular cream cheese and used lite.  They still turned out great!

They're ok.  I had a few difficulties getting them to look pretty.  Next time I recommend sealing the wet edges together with the prongs of a fork.  I couldn't fit as much filling in the middle as desired.  Tasted good while warm.  Next time will try a savory filling instead of jam.  (I also tried a mix of peanut butter & jelly, but don't recommend it).

These were amazing!  Only a few leaky ones and no one cared because they were so good!  Filled them with apricot preserves and seedless raspberry jam, double-coated them with confectioner's sugar and they disappeared.  I needed to make way more than I did.  I'm making them again for this weekend, possibly doubling the recipe.

My fiance and future mother-in-law loved them.  They disappeared when I wasn't looking and my mother-in-law had to hide them from her husband and daughters.  They were very easy to make and I think that this recipe will be lots of fun to make with my 5 year old niece.

Let me start of by saying that I come from a Mexican family and that I grew up with empanadas.  While this is not like the traditional dough it is really good.  Fed them to my family  (born and raised Mexican) and they all loved them.  Made them with pumpkin stuffing and dusted them with sugar to make it a little sweeter (which they barely were).  Also, for the people that said the dough was not easy to handle, I think it might be because the recipe calls for one package (3 oz) of cream cheese.  One package of cream cheese is 8oz not 3oz!!  I almost put the whole package in myself.

I've never made empanadas before but, always wanting to try new recipes, I was excited to try this for a luncheon I hosted. The hardest part of this whole dish is to make sure you get a good seal all the way around the empanada. That and deciding which preserves to use for the filling.  I chose to make some with Oregon Marion Berry Seedless Preserves and some with Apricot Preserves. Being a fragile dough, I found it easiest to place the cooked empanada on a bed of cinnamon sugar and then spoon additional sugar over top until coated.
I served them with a dollop of Greek Goddess Honey Vanilla Greek Yogurt on top.  They were a seriously big hit!!!

This was the easiest ever! That hardest part was making them evenly shaped. The dough came out flakey and wonderful. I used apricot filling and pumpkin filling. The whole family loved them.

I have made these many times and loved the recipe.I did find empanada dough cut and ready to use at our mexican grocery store in frozen foods.They are excellent and cheap!However,they are often out of them so I use this recipe and make my own.Yes,this is good as a pie crust as well.I find these easy to make not difficult at all if using enough flour and dough is properly chilled.I make savory and sweet with them.I thank you for a quality recipe!

Turned out great! I will do things a little different next time however. Next time I will double the apple part of the recipe cause it just wasn't enough. I could only make 6 and the filling was hardly enough for those. Next time I will also try to use chocolate pudding inside too :)

The recipe was okay i guess, but when i baked it and let it cool. the whole thing was braking apart. IT was a whole mess and when baking it the fruit preserves were spilling out. Its okay if i wanted to make a crumble cake, but I am not a fan of this recipie

1st time making Empanadas!  I was not sure about the dough, reminded me of play-dough and very granular until I mushed it all together, and had to let it sit out a while longer so it was soft enough to roll out the next day.  I had to leave it in the oven for 25 min and also the cinnamon/sugar wouldn't stick to the fresh-out-the-oven empanadas so I ended up coating them with butter and dropping them in that way. For the filling I just bough some apple pie filling and processed it in my blender, worked great.  Overall they're a big hit, might try a different dough recipe next time though.

Good recipe. The only thing I think would make the recipe easier would be to toss the empanadas in cinnamon and sugar before baking because it doesn't want to stick very well to the cooked dough, and I like them COATED! For filling I cooked down some finely chopped apples with some sugar, cinnamon and a teeny sprinkle of nutmeg and clove. I also made a caramel sauce to dip them in. Delicious!

This recipe is wonderful! This is the first time I made Empanadas and they were a huge hit! I followed the recipe exactly as it stands here. I filled mine with apricot preserves, strawberry preserves, a homemade apple filling, and blackberry jam. The jam leaked out, the others did not. This is definitely one I will be making again.  I used a 3 inch rim drinking glass as my "cutter" it was a perfect size. Just make sure to pinch your edges together and do not over-fill. These are awesome. Will be adding these to my recipe box! ENJOY!

Amazing! I used Trader Joes strawberry preserves and they are fantastic! Way smaller than I am used to, but I sort of like them this way. I am only sorry I didn't triple this recipe.

Amazing!! I used apple pie filling with extra cinnamon.  I made these for work and they were gone before the afternoon was over!  The crust is very light and is a nice balance to the sweet filling.  Make extra as these will be very popular.

These are a bit time consuming and I have no idea how you are supposed to make 30 out of one batch, but they came out alright. I personally would have prefered a dough that wasn't quite so bland, and I can think of many other desserts I would rather make instead, so I think I'll pass on this one in the future.

Very yummy!  Used raspberry pie filling, which was too runny.  Next time, I will for sure use a thick jam instead.

Yummy! These are easy to make, but it does take time.  We used Neufchatel cheese b/c that's all I buy and it still tasted great.  We refrigerated overnight.  Also, we didn't roll these out.  I cut the chilled dough in pieces and then rolled those in balls and flattened with a glass.  I did have to flatten a little more by hand.  We rolled the empanadas in sugar before baking and that turned out great!  About half of the empanadas with strawberry jam leaked, but I probably put too much in those.  I also made a few with peach preserves and none of those leaked.  The preserves were not so runny so that might have something to do with it.  In any case, both flavors were delicious.  And the crust is delicious so it was okay that some leaked.  My 10 yr old made these with me, and even my 9 and 4 yr olds got in on the action.  Fun family recipe if you're not in a hurry.  The oldest was taking these in for a cultural project at school and we had never made them before, so very happy that they came out so well.  Great recipe!!  We're going to try wiith savory fillings next time

These were really yummy.  Make sure you use PLENTY of powdered sugar or flour (or a mix of the two) to roll them out on.  When you do, it's a piece of cake... pie... empanada! ;)

Delicious!!  I used mixed berry conserve - it seeped out only a tiny bit, but didn't cause a mess or problem at all.  I also used a 6-petal flower cookie cutter and sealed the edges with a fork.  They looked so cute!  Serve these warm with a side of vanilla ice cream.

I made this for a mexican party and it was a huge hit.  I used a apple pie filling and wax paper like someone suggested and it worked great.  So easy...I'll certainly make again.  You must double recipe...even when doubling I only got 19 made..instead of 24 so plan accordingly.

These were fantastic! I made them for my Spanish food final and their only complaint was that I didn't bring more! I made them with apple, and it looks like I'll be making some more for the Spanish vs French end of the year charades match! ;)

So easy! I wanted to double the recipe for a work party but only had 3/4c butter. I used a full 8oz of cream cheese to try and make up the difference and they came out great and the crust was so flaky and delicious! I used apple pie filling (about 1tsp) and only a couple of them leaked out while cooking. Great recipe.

These will make a great addition to my recipe box. These were so easy and didn't take long at all. I had left over pulled pork and just added the spices called for, put it in the oven for about 20 minutes and I was good to go.  I found the dough to be a little dry. I used Crisco instead of lard and that could account for it. Served with Salsa and sour cream it made a nice change of pace. I will definitely make these again.

I made these for a fiesta dinner party the other night.  I was concerned when I first made the dough, that they were not going turn out well, but by the next day it had set up perfectly in the fridge.  They were fabulous!  I filled them with apple filling and everyone raved.  Thank you for such an easy and scrumptious recipe.

These are fine but not memorable.  I made them with jam and Nutella.  The jam leaked out pretty badly, which I'm sure was my fault for not using chunkier preserves.  The Nutella was okay but the empanadas made with it seemed too dry.  My main problem with these is that it's kind of tedious to individually shape and fill each one.  Of course, that's a problem with empanadas in general, not just this recipe.  I won't make these regularly because they're not worth the work, but I might try them again, especially if I come up with a good filling idea.

So good--the crust is very tender and flaky.  For fillings I used orange marmalade + diced apple, and berry jam + frozen blueberries.  I doubled the recipe, used a water glass rim to cut circles, and ended up with only about 24--maybe I rolled too thick, but it tasted great.  Dough is very soft and sticky to work with (though out of the fridge is hard as a rock, so I had to wait almost an hour for it to soften up), I ended up rolling out the dough between two pieces of wax paper.  Definitely use parchment paper on the baking sheet as well for easy clean-up (jam does squirt out a bit).

Wow is all I can say. It must be the cream cheese in the dough that makes them so tasty. I used Trader Joe's rasberry jam for the filling. I will be making these often.

Fantastic!  I'm not a big baker, but I tried these out.  I let the dough chill overnight (appr. 18 hours of so) and formed them into balls and flattened them out by hand. I filled them with strawberries I had cooked on the stove with suger, and some fresh bananas.  Cooked them for about 18 minutes then rolled them in cin. sugar.  SOOO GOOD!

Maybe my expectations of this recipe were too high. I like that the dough was easy to put together and I wrapped my dough and chilled it in the freezer for about 2 1/2 hours cause I was determined to make these today. I divided the chilled dough with a knife and rolled out the pieces between parchment paper. I agree with the amount of preserves being too much but I just eyeballed it anyway. Unfortunately the dough sure got sticky quickly which lead to bad sealing of the pies and leakage of the filling while baking. I used raspberry preserves in mine and rolled in icing sugar. Unfortunately since the dough itself wasn't sweet I had to sprinkle extra sugar on top of the finished pastry - which made it taste much better. This is a recipe with good potential and I just might try it again.

These were great. They were super easy to make and really yummy. I used apple pie and raspberry pie filling. I made the dough the night before (as indicated) and cooked them in the morning. Then I reheated them for 6 minutes in the oven.

These are delicious! I put the dough in the freezer for a half an hour, and this worked fine. I had to work quickly though! I added 1/4 cup of sugar to the dough. The only problem with these was assembly. I kept filling mine too full! Practice will fix this problem though. Great with ice cream!

This recipe makes just 11-13 empanadas, so if you cook for the family with three or more persons, you should even triple these recipe. The dough itself is tasty, but it is more cream cheese-y, not buttery. I made empanadas with cherry pie filling and didn't like the result very much. You shouldn't roll the dough thin, if you use preserve/berry filling, because the filling splatters out of the edges. Don't you too much filling, 1/2 teaspoon more and you ended up with the filling onto your baking sheet. The baked empanada is very fragile, you can easily tear it with your nail or spatula when it is hot. Probably I will make these empanadas again but with another filling.

This recipe was very easy and convenient to make but most of the jelly seeped out of the bread even though i sealed it with a fork. besides that everything was great. I also suggest using wax paper so that you are not left scrubbing a bunch of jelly off of your pan

Yummm!! These are so good.  Made them with an apple pie/raisin filling and they were so great!  I will double this recipe next time though as this made about 10-15 empanadas and they are a bit of work.  They taste like mini pies and the crust is so flaky and yummy!

These were simply delicious! I made tons of them for a fiesta, and they were all gone by the end! The crust is deliciously buttery and flaky, and they are soo easy to make. I will definately make these again. :)

In my opinion, the dough needed some sugar. And my husband thought the empanadas needed to be fried. I won't make these again.

These turned out GREAT, everyone at work loved them and could not believe that I hadn't picked them up from a bakery on the way in.  I made a fresh blackberry jam to fill them, perfect combination of sour and sweet.  I will definitely keep this quick dough recipe on hand!!!

This was fantastic.  My son is allergic to dairy so I used soy butter and cream cheese.  The dough was great and baked up flakey and delicious.  I made apple filling and the whole batch was gone before the day was over.  Yummy!

i made these for my wife's fiesta pot luck at work . it was a lot of work but all 72 were gone and they where a hit . i diddn't roll the dough , i just devided it up into 12 little balls then smash the with my hand to make the round crust . they wern't perfect but they looked athenic. i used apple pie filling (chopped up),blueberry pie filling, cherry pie filling( mashed up), nutello with chopped walnuts, sweet potatoe pie filling , and peach preserves. the ones i tried powered sugar seem to get gummie or pastie but the were ate also.

FANTASTIC!  These were so easy!  I rolled the dough in powdered sugar instead of flour as another reviewer had suggested.  Also, I wasn't paying attention and rolled these in cinnamon sugar before baking instead of after.  We used peach and blueberry preserves.  Everyone loved them!  I can't wait to try them with savory fillings.

These were really good.  The only reason I did not give it a 5 rating was because I added ground pecans to the dough.  I also used sugar free preserves because of my husband's diabtes.  Will make these again, but not use as much preserves because they leaked.  My fault on that one.

I made this with my friend, Emily and my daughter, Fiona. Dough is super sticky, maybe roll between pieces of saran wrap to get the dough thin enough. Great tasting when jam stays in cookie.

Excellent!  I am excited to try other fillings.  The few cookies that remained because of too-full bellies, were eaten before breakfast the next day.  
UPDATE: I have made these several times now using different ingredients: peanut butter and jelly, snickers, fruit - they are all wonderful.  Thank you for submitting this recipe

I didn't love these, not even my hubby who is not a picky eater at all liked them.  The dough was alot of work to roll out which would have been fine but the finished product just wasn't worth it.  I filled some w cream cheese, some w apple butter,and some with preserves and was really disapointed after all the great reviews I read.  If you are looking for a great dessert to make that is similar I definetly recommend the apple enchilada recipe from this site (the one using real butter) and filling it with apple pie filling also from this site.  That is such a great dessert, yummm!!!

These were excellent! I filled some with cream cheese others with nutella.

I fried these empanadas, as is tradition, and it made the crust a great consistency.

These were great.  I was going to make them for a cinco de mayo BBQ but my family got to them first.  I wouldn't suggest them for a large crowd. They are easy but too much time involved.  I will keep this recipe YUMMY.  Thank you

I used pie-filling peaches from a can for the filling. I cut them up into much tinier pieces, and the end result was great!  I got a little frustrated while constructing the empanadas, but that was probably my fault for not working with properly chilled dough.  I used to buy these all the time mexican tiendas down in Tucson, and I have to say that pumpkin and tres leches filled are the best!

Mom loved these.  I filled them with fruit pie filling and apple pie filling.  These could be great as gifts.

I made these for a Cinco de Mayo party and called them "American Empanadas" since I filled them with apple pie filling. I took some other reviewers' advice and coated them with egg for a more shiny brown look. It didn't really come out looking like the pictures (actually looked very far off from the listed photos), but they were gobbled up. This recipe didn't yield 2 1/2 dozen for me (hence why I wasn't able to try one myself; I wanted to make sure everyone else could try them!). So if you're wanting to make quite a bit, double the recipe!

These are absolutely fabulous.  A little time consuming but oh so worth it.  Just a hint of the cream cheese in the pastry, this cookie is to die for.

The first time I tried these was in a Mexican restaurant, but they were made with smoked salmon and cream cheese. They were delicious and I totally suggest it.

This was wonderful!  I made a quadruple batch for work and they were gone by the end of lunch.  
I let the dough sit in the fridge overnight.  I used a gyoza mold to pinch the edges together.  Thanks!

The dough is wonderful! But it was really difficult to seal these up well. I had oozing jam everywhere. I didn't even put in that much based upon another's recommendation. Next time, maybe I'll try making these savory with a curry meat inside. I bet that would be wonderful!

The cookies turned out really, really good and were a big hit at a party.  However, the dough was very sticky, so keep plenty of flour on hand.  I will definitely make them again.

These were good I got a few compliments.  I did not find the dough difficult to work with but I let it set overnight.  I used apple pie filling I pureed it so there would be no large chunks.

These were a huge hit at my work luncheon - a couple people asked me for the recipe.  I followed the directions exactly, and used apple jelly.  Be sure not to fill them too much or the jelly spews out.  Also, be sure to pinch the seams tightly.  I'd also recommend lining your cookie trays with parchment paper.  I'll definately make these again - thanks!

These treats are unbelievable!! I've used this recipe many times now, and finally had to write a review.  I normally make a double or triple batch and use different kinds of preserves (cherry and seedless blackberry seem to be the hot items).  For a change of pace, try it with a little spoonful of easy pumpkin pie mix.

These tasted really good!  The dough is really sticky, have lots of flour ready to roll them out!  Unfortunately, I used a cookie cutter that was way to small and the empanadas didn't look very pretty!  The half-moons didn't close and the jam spilled out.  They still tasted really good and everyone loved them!  They taste a lot like mini apple pies. (Everyone thought that it was apple and I used strawberry preserves!)

This is an excellent recipe. It was super easy to make, not too many ingredients, and the flavor of the dough is amazing.

I needed to bake these the same night that I made the dough, so I made the dough and chilled the dough in the fridge for 45min. After 45min I was able to roll out the dough with lots of extra flour to prevent sticking, then brush with an egg wash and bake for 25min at 375.

They couldn't have turned out better. In fact, they were so good that the next day we made a triple batch with dinner and dessert fillings! Thank you for such an awesome recipe!!!

Based on positive reviews, i made a double batch of dough. My little hand mixer was not up to the job. Rolling out the dough was also difficult. Dough was not sweet at all. (Fine with me) I used apple pie filling, served with ice cream and caramel sauce. Yum. i don't know if I would make again...too much work.

The crust was so flaky and tasted so good. Humidity was high so I had to add a little more flour. Since it was my first batch, I used apple pie filling. So good. Will be making more flavors soon!

It was delicious.  I baked them for 19 minutes and they were perfectly crunchy and crispy.  They melt in your mouth and it was such a great dessert.

This was my first attempt at Empanadas, although I do bake a lot! This dough didn't taste that great. Additionally, all my filling bled out! After asking some friends what might've went wrong, I found out that I didn't properly seal the empanadas. You have to wet your finger and run it along the seam before pressing together.  The recipe didn't mention that! Waste of precious time and ingredients. boo.

I made the dough to use in a savory empanada with a smoked tri tip filling. The dough was easy to make and work with. I used plenty of flour on the working surface and rolling pin to prevent sticking. I added a little bit of salt to the recipe.

Pretty good. My youngest daughter really liked it. I tried pumpkin too. I think the cream cheese in the dough is too fattening or not really being able to taste it though.

Great Recipe! Followed directions exactly, placed the dough on the refrigerator. I didn't get back to it for 2 days and it held up well. This one is a keeper!

I made these for a bake sale fundraiser and they were gone in no time! I doubled this recipe, left the dough in the fridge overnight and took it out in sections. I took out about 1/4 of the dough the first time and I'm glad I did. It was simple to roll but took me a while to get the hang of how much of the filling I could put in and how to seal it best. They did turn out amazing, and it was my first time making them. I did start out with cutting about a 3" circle but the next time I made them more like 3.5" which worked much better. I pulled out another section of dough when I was about halfway through filling the one I was working on.

I was surprised that the dough actually worked considering the ingredients, but it did. I noticed that the time it takes to roll the dough out and cut out the circles makes them quite soft and floppy - difficult to work with. So I put the circles back in the fridge to harden up again. Then I took them out, filled them and baked them.

These were excellent. I used canned apple pie filling to save time and they were delicious! I've made them 3 times now and I used a cookie cutter to make them in 3" in diameter (just right for bite sized dessert) and 4.5" diameter (for more traditional sized empanadas). If you're new to making pastry dough, definitely recommend reading other reviewers' tips as this isn't the easiest/quickest thing to do if this is your first rodeo.

The dough needed a better binding agent and more sugar. I will try again though. I will tweak the recipe.

Overall this is a really good recipe and I loved the flavor and texture of the dough but I gave it 4 stars because the filling was not all that interesting and as many said just leaked out. The dough can certainly be sticky but what I found helps is to refrigerate the dough into about 1" balls rather than one large ball. Then I rolled each ball between two sheets of parchment paper using a little flour if it started sticking (don't use too much flour because the flour will dry out the dough which then causes cracks and more seepage). Be sure to keep the dough cold to prevent major sticking! For filling, I mixed cream cheese with some jam since I didn't have preserves and found that didn't seep out like plain jam. I also mixed cream cheese, honey and toasted pecans which was tasty, plus you can use more since it doesn't leak out at all.  Have fun, be patient and enjoy. Thanks for the recipe.

Easy to make, followed recipe, filled some with mincemeat and others with homemade strawberry jam,  the jam was more likely to leak out though but it wasn't a problem because I used the Chef Sheets reusable non-stick sheets.  Very tasty and tender bites.

FIRST TIMER! although it was a little intimidating on the first few, but by the time I was on the last ones, I was 'a pro'. I used egg wash to seal them.  I used strawberry preserves. I took them to taco night at church and EVERYONE loved them. And I amazed them by it being homemade dough. Thankfully I tripled the recipe- a whole block of the cream cheese, and I measured the flour then sifted (maybe I should have sifted then measured?).  Be careful when removing from pan, they will break.

I've made this several times, and been doing them more lately. I like to use pie filling, allows me to stuff them more. I also make them bigger, I suggest you double or quadruple the recipe. 
This time I decided to do something a little different, I added spice and garlic to the dough. I plan to make a breakfast version with eggs and bacon so I thought it might add a little different flavor. We will see how my experiment comes out tomorrow! 
My boyfriend loves these filled with cherry pie filling, as does my stepfather. Both have been asking for them for their birthdays.

The family really enjoyed these. I did double the recipe  (thank goodness ) :-) and I also added 1/2 a tbsp of vanilla bean paste. The cream cheese crust really complimented the fruit filling. I used cherry and apple filling. I also cut small slit on top to release steam.

I made these empanadas for my spanish ll class's party, and they turned out berry well! (lol) Anyways I used mixed berry jam as the filling and they turned out nice. The only suggestion I would make is that if you are planning on making a lot as I was, make them mini! I just barely had enough and they were bite size! Still really good though. Just a tip. Overall these were great fun little festive treats!

Just made these for the kiddos.  I rolled the dough out inbetween 2 sheets of waxed paper without any difficulty.  I used the Pampered Chef sandwich sealer and baked them on my silpat.  They literally slipped right off the mat and the mat wiped clean without any effort.  Because 3 oz. packages of cream cheese do not exist, I read many reviews before making these to see what others did.  In the end I used the entire 8 oz. brick of cream cheese, 1/4 cup of butter and 2 cups of flour.  I think the dough could use some flavoring, maybe cinnamon.  I found the dough tasteless and the kids did not like them either.

I'm sure I will eventually give this recipe 5 stars but right now I'm sitting back and licking my wounded pride. I failed at what seemed to be a simple straight forward recipe! (I'd cry in my beer but I don't like salty beer LOL) I think the whole thing boils down to not having enough time to make these. I missed the part in the directions to make the dough the day before and with only four hours until party time I went for the freezer to make things happen... They did but not good. Just couldn't get the dough to hold together. I even tried to add more flour but to no avail. Next time I'll try it the right way and update this review. Geez they sounded so good to!!

These are so delicious.  I made them for a latin-themed party and they were a huge hit.  I did half with apricot & pineapple, and half with raspberry.  I plan on trying them again and putting Nutella in them.

VERY GOOD! I made them exactly as written, and I loved how tender and flaky the dough came out. I made mine a little smaller and they looked beautiful. I filled half with orange marmalade and the other half with raspberry-YUM! This is a keeper for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is a really good empanada recipe! My husband loved it and it reminded him of his childhood! The only thing wrong was that the dough was a little sticky to work with.....

Delicious! I made these with homemade apple pie filling (sliced apples, cinnamon, brown sugar, sugar, lemon juice and flour) I would give them 5/5 but it was hard getting the dough as thin as I think would've made them perfect.

Made these with an apple filling and strawberry filling for a bake sale.  Everyone enjoyed them.  The apple reminded me of McDonald's apple pie.  The dough did get a but difficult to handle at times.  I had to use alot of flour and powdered sugar to keep them from getting sticky.

These are really good.  I filled them with canned apple pie filling which I jazzed up with cinnamon and nutmeg.  They tasted like the apple pies from McDonald's but much better!  Took them to a party and they were gone immediately!

These were very good! I don't think I'll be making them often, as I normally don't like to spend a lot of time cutting dough, and the task of filling. I accidently threw in the whole bar of cream cheese, so I ended up doubling the recipe. I filled mine with cherry pie filling and apple.

I found this dough difficult to work with.  I used cherry preserves, and had much of it melt out of the pastry, even though I was careful (or so I thought) to seal them well.  End product was tender and flaky. I think I would have preferred a savory filling, or a dough with a touch of sweetness with the preserves.  I think this is one I will continue tweaking until I'm happy with it.  I've had empanadas, both sweet and savory, but only a few times from restaurants.  I thought those were fried.

The dough is simple to make,I used the 1" ball suggestion and had no problems.  If I make these again I will try powdered sugar, I don't care for the sugar/cinnamon coating.

Not sure that I made it right. Didn't taste any better than Mc.Donald's apple pies but a lot more work. I made them with chopped up apple pie filling. I may try them again just to see if I may have made them wrong or if I can improve on them. They weren't bad, just not quite as awsome as I had anticipated.

These were good, altho I've never had anything to compare them to. I wish you could fit more filling into them without it seeping out (so you could taste it better) but they were still good. Thanks!

Pretty good..I used Strawberry preserves. The dough seems a little bland but when you roll it around in the cinnamon & brown sugar it helps it out. Maybe next time I'll add some vanilla extract to the dough mixture.

These are very delicious cookies but I only give it 4 stars because it is very labor intensive. The cookies are very delicate and difficult to stack and transport. The dough is difficult to work with. My recommendation is to divide the dough in two discs before refrigeration. If the dough becomes too soft, you can pop it in the freezer for 5 min. I used apple pie filling. Tasty but a bit too reminicent of those prepackaged fruit pies. I will makes again but will fill with a homemade fruit chutney instead.

I love this recipe, although the ones with the fruit preserves were not my favorite.  My best so far was one with Tastefully simple dutch apple topping, and one that I put in a dab of cream cheese with Craisins and raw almonds.  Yum!

The pastry is really soft and tender, plus this dish is very quick and easy. The make sure to flour your work surface well, I had to re-flour halfway through rolling out the dough. I made these with peach preserve filling and they were great! Tasted a bit like apple pie

OK...I have to admit that when I read this recipe I thought what the HECK???  When I asked a co-worker about it (she's Hopie Indian), she also was wondering.  However I continued on and made them.  WOW!!!!  They were a HUGE hit at my sweeites work, and mine where we both have a strong Mexican work force.  Will make these AGAIN, and will use a meat filling next time.  They are easy to make and YUMMY for the cold winter days.  I didn't use a rolling pin to flatten, I shaped them with my hands as the dough is a bit sticky at first.

Worth the effort....they take a little time but taste wonderful.  My favorite filling is rasberry.  I use a perogie maker and it worked great.  They are a hit wherever we take them.

I made these as a dessert for a Mexican bbq I went to...filled with Mango jam these are to die for.  I made some filled with apple pie filling - they weren't as good.  The dough is very soft and flaky out of the oven, these go fast!

I used strawberry pie filling and I also tried a few with lemon curd. The ones with the lemon curd all leaked. But the strawberry ones turned out pretty decent. And I tossed mine into some powdered sugar.  Not overwhelmingly great but still tasty.

These were pretty good, but not totally great.  Next time I'll roll the dough thinner, and maybe use powdered sugar instead of flour for rolling.

This is a great recipe. I made them once for friends, and have had requests ever since. One thing that others probably have noticed, you really can't put a whole spoonful of preserves in each one. But they still taste delicious!

Good, but I was expecting fantastic. The dough was easy to work with and the trick it not to over fill them. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The dough for this recipe is wonderful. Very delicious and a tremendous hit with everyone who has it.  You have no idea how many "brownie points" this recipe gives me in my wife's family who are predominantly Hispanic.

If I could give these a million stars, I would.  Totally worth the effort!! I always have my sister come help.  (It works much better as a two man operation - She rolls out, I fill and fold)  I always scale this to make 48 servings, and there are RARELY any left.

The taste was 5 stars, but the recipe got a lil less only because I had a lil trouble with the dough...just sticky I guess, but I found it easier to work with as long as I kept the flour on hand to keep using as I rolled it out. I used apple pie filling & it came out great!

Yummy! These got eaten up almost as soon as they were on the table.  I love the crust and will use it many times over in pies.  As far as the Empanadas....I will make for dessert whenever I make Mexican food.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I've made these several times - they're always such a success!  They are very delicate though - when you're rolling them in the sugar mix at the end, do so very gently or they'll break.  I love making these with apple pie filling - it tastes great w/ the cinn. sugar coating at the end.  One of my favorite recipes from this site!

These are so good! Very easy to make too. I used 3 different jellies. I made them heavy on the cinnamon sugar. I took them for my kids' Wed. night class at church. We were studying missionaries in Argentina so I thought it would be fun for the them to have a South American treat. They were all eaten.
My husband really liked them too and I had to make another batch just for the folks at home.
I'm sure I'll be making them again.

Wow. These were really delicious. I made them for a party and they were a huge hit. The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is because I think that a different type of filling may have tasted better than what was recommended . . .

This recipe was AMAZING!! I kept the dough in the fridge for 5 days and it wasn't sticky at all. I added cinnamon sugar to the empandas BEFORE putting in the oven and they turned out brilliant. I couldn't get my friends to stop eating these. Perfect recipe!!

Very good, but a lot of frustrating work.  
At the time, I swore I would never make these cookies again, but they received rave reviews. 
The dough is pretty easy to roll out (it didn't rip easily), but the cookies popped open in the oven & leaked jam onto the pan. I tried wetting the edges to seal, crimping with a fork, varying the amount of jam down to almost none, and nothing worked to keep the cookies sealed. 
Hints:
1) Light colored jam, like apple jelly, doesn't look as messy when it leaks.  
2) Rolling them in cinnamon sugar helps mask their messy appearance, even for dark-colored jams.

What a fantastic and easy to make dough!!  I really love savory empanadas and this dough worked fantastic for those too.  It may not be the easiest to work with - just have to make sure to keep your surface floured but turned out a great finished product!!  Yummo!!!

Fantastic!  I made this recipe for my sister and her kids when they came to visit me it Tucson.  We had a fabulouse Mexican Fiesta!  They were very easy and the kids LOVED them.  I used pie apple and cherry pie filling instead of preserves.  They turned out fantastic!  I will definitly use this as my main empanada dough recipe.

These were awesome!  I'm not a big fan of jellies, so I substituted Apple pie filling.  They were great!  The whole family loved them, and the dough can be kept in the fridge for up to a week.  I also served my "Apple" empanadas with vanilla ice cream.  It was a big hit!

These are great!  The crust is wonderful!  They are pretty authentic, depending on the filling that you choose.

Theses were delicious! I used raspberry preserves. Make sure you only use a little jam and seal it well or else it makes a mess...it was still delicious! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!
