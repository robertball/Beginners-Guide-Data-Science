With all the ingredients involved in the preparation, I expected something remarkable.  Perhaps that was the problem - too much "stuff."  These were good, not great.

We loved these! The only change I made was in using frozen green beans instead of fresh. No need to change anything, these are delicious just as is. Yum!

I substituted fresh broccoli, and we were quite happy with the result!! I steamed cut up broccoli in step 1, and followed the remainder as written. We'll certainly have this again!

What I like about this recipe is the zingy vinaigrette!  I love green beans, so I don't want their flavor lost beneath other flavors.  This dressing enlivens the flavor, and adds the crunch of almonds.  Plus, it doesn't need to be served piping hot.  Room temperature is just fine here, so this dish is perfect for a buffet meal.  I want to do this one again!

I thought these were simple to put together for a week night meal and jazzed up plain green beans.   I do think the vinaigrette was a touch oily and could have used some more dijon for flavor.   The almonds gave the recipe a nice texture.

I really liked this recipe and thought this was a good way to dress up green beans. A few changes I made based on other reviews and what I had in the kitchen: I halved the oil, replaced the thyme with dill, added mushrooms and omitted the cheese. Will be adding this to my recipe book!

I made these for Thanksgiving.  I  only used green beans, 1 clove garlic, finely minced, 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard 1/2 teaspoon Thyme, 1/8 teaspoon Sea Salt, 1/4 teaspoon  Fine Grind Black Pepper, 1/4 cup toasted sliced almonds, and 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese,  It was a yummy glaze that everyone enjoyed on the green beans.

This was good however the vinaigrette was quite subtle.

Too greasy! Good general idea, but just less oil next time and more mustard...
