I can't tell you all how good this was!!!! Let's just say that for Thanksgiving I had about 20 different things to eat and this was the only thing that was completely gone. Half the people there said this was their favorite. Here's what I did different: I used 12 noodles instead of 9 and dipped them in boiling water as some of the reviews said the noodles were too hard after baking. I also added more flour since my sauce was not thickening (about 2 tablespoons more). I also added one large sauteed onion to the garlic mix. This dish was beyond good and I'll be making it again and again. I was a little nervous about the heavy cream on top but it was great. I baked the lasagna for about 45 min total and then let it sit for a cpouple of hours (to be timed with dinner) and then warmed it up in the over before serving. BRAVO BRAVO BRAVO!!!!! UPDATE: Made this again. I used a Vidallia onion. It worked wonderfully. For the topping I used half and half and just stired some salt into it (didn't have a mixer where I was baking). You don't lose any bit of flavor with that sub.

HUGE hit - I was stunned at the reactions of my husband and guests.  I omited the whipping cream entirely and didn't miss it.  I added fresh basil leaves to each layer.

WOW! And I thought this lasagna was pretty good the day I made it, but the next day it was amazing! I took some of the suggestions made by others: I added a layer in the center of fresh spinach (which I topped with mozzerella), I added sweet onion to the sauce, and I dipped the lasagna noodles in boiling water for 20 seconds before cooking.  It came out perfect . . . this recipe is a keeper and a must repeat for my family! Thank you!

Having everything on hand, company in the house, including a vegetarian, and looking for something yummy to make for dinner between Christmas and New Years, this is what I decided on. I've had this recipe sitting in my box for a couple of months and finally gave it it's just due. This was extremely easy to assemble. I roasted the squash in the morning and had that ready when it came time to make dinner. Followed the recipe exactly, however, I did add a bit of nutmeg to the sauce and when layering also added some mozzarella cheese in addition to the Parmesan. Just a simple delicious meal with many happy groans from everyone around the table. I served it with a spinach salad, and hot garlic bread. Thanks for submitting a great recipe. Now I can't wait to make it again.

This is a pretty good recipe as is.  I added nutmeg, but otherwise stuck to the original and it turned out great.

I roasted both the garlic and butternut squash and together in the cream sauce they create an incredible flavor. It's luscious! While the squash was roasting in the oven, I put dry noodles in a 9 x 13 pan on the stove and poured HOT water over them. They were soft by the time the squash came out of the oven! I made the white sauce with nonfat milk and used fat free half and half on top. I also chopped fresh spinach and put it in each layer. This dish is perfect for a casual family dinner or as a side dish for a more sophisticated dinner party. I give it 10 stars!

I loved this dish! My husband (who is a meat-eater) loved this more than me :) I used the other reviewer's suggestion and added spinach and I also added a bit of red pepper to the dish which added a nice bite to the butternut squash sweetness. Will definitely be making this dish again.

Creamy and delicious! I made three layers and used a few more noodles. I also added some fresh spinach to one of the layers, some mozzerella to all layers and on top. SOoooo good! Next time, I will add more garlic since I'm a garlic freak! My 4 year old even liked it (I made 1/4 of it without the spinach for her).

I really liked this recipe. I think it is a great dish to serve on the side of maybe a roasted or smoked meat. This has a nice mellow flavor and creamy texture. I did add some fresh spinach as a layer in mine to add some color to the dish.

This is probably one of the most spectacular Havest Dinners I have had in a long time...not only because of taste, gourmet qualities and easiness...just plain exceptional!  Do not change a thing.  Restaurant quality......if your squash weighs a little more use it.  Thank you so much for such a fine new recipe!  Do you have any more recipes to share......

Great!  I did make a few adjustments.  I used wontons instead of no cook lasagna noodles.  Double them if you want a thicker noodle but I like the wontons b/c I don't like the thicker traditional lasagna noodles.  I did add a dollop of ricotta cheese in the center of each wonton, smashing to spread it out a little.  Also, sprinkle fresh basil on all the layers. I increased the creamy mixture by using 1/2 cup butter, 1/2 c. flour and 6 cups milk (3 c. whole, 3 c. 1%)  I love the whipped cream topping sprinkled with parmasean.  My dish browned up very nicely unlike the photo.  I did forget to add freshly grated nutmeg before cooking but will sprinkle very lightly on top before serving.  If one wanted a more traditional lasagna dish one could add mozzerella cheese.  I did not b/c I was trying to hold down the calories.  Delish dish for a cool fall or winter day!  Also, good the next day!

This was excellent and actually lighter than I expected.  I followed the instructions exactly when it came to preparing the butternut squash sauce and it came out perfect.  I omitted the heavy cream whipped topping.  I really didn't understand the purpose and it just didn't seem necessary.  After reading some other reviews, I included sauteed spinach in the bottom layer of the lasagna (on top of the first layer of the pasta).  In the layer above that, I spread fresh diced tomatoes.  I also added mozzarella cheese to each layer, and then on top like a traditional lasagna (instead of the heavy whipped topping).  With these changes it was full of flavor, yet still light enough to taste like a vegetarian meal.  Served with green beans and we were in heaven!

I have made this several times.  I have never put the heavy cream mix on and don't miss it at all.  I have made a few small changes.  I layer in the following manner - squash sauce, noodles, sauce, parm, noodles, basil pesto, mozzarella, noodles, sauce, parm, noodles, sauce, mozzarella and parm.  My family can't wait to have this.

For an  8x8 pan I used about 3 cups mashed butternut, and halved the rest of the sauce ingredients. I used 6 no-boil noodles. I was worried that the sauce was gonna be too think and the noodles be too dry. I added sage and basil to sauce. I didn't bother with the whipped cream step and just poured about 1/4 cup fat free half and half over the top. I think an additional cheese, like a Fontina, would help give this some good flavor and give the ooey-gooey that a traditional lasagna has.  Super easy Fall dish.

This is wonderful- I added about 2/3 cup of pesto (my own homemade) for color and a nice balance of flavor to the squash. It's a family and company favorite!

I've made this a couple times now. I like that it doesn't include a lot of cheese so it makes me think it is healthier than traditional lasagna. The first time I followed the recipe as is and and it was good, but I wanted some more flavors. The second time I used a bit more garlic and layered fresh spinach leaves and some cooked mild Italian pork sausage in with the noodles. I sprinkled dried parsley on top before baking. I'll make it that way again. In fact, I think the original recipe is a good base to experiment with. Thanks for sharing Anna.

Tasty but very rich.  One slice per person is definitely adequate.  We used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of whipping cream (so no layer or cream on top) and used mozarella cheese (because that's what we had on hand).  Tasty.  Big hit at Thanksgiving feast.

Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.  I didn't have the time to make a full lasagna, but I needed a different sauce to go over some porcini tortelloni I had, and the butternut squash sauce was delicious as written.

This is amazing! I made it in two 8x8 lasagna pans and froze it right away before baking. When we were ready to eat one, I put it (frozen) into the oven and baked at 375 for 1 hour covered with foil and 30 minutes without. Sooo good! I will definitely make this one again!

PHENOMENAL!!!  one regular size butternut squash was just right for this recipe.  i added sauteed spinach with the bottom layer and brown mushrooms for the middle layer.  that made the PERFECT combo for a yummy vegetarian meal...  if you can't possibly forego meat, add shredded chicken to a layer and i am sure you will not be disappointed!

Love this recipe! Great flavors the only thing I change is I make it as a mac and cheese meal that my kids have named "sneaky mac"!

This was awesome! Like some other reviewers suggested. I added a layer of fresh spinach leaves in the bottom layer for some color. Didn't cook the spinach just threw it in with the cheese on top then added the noodles for my seocond layer. This was soooo good. A keeper for sure!

I followed the recipe but used a kabocha squash from a friend's garden.  I added a little nutmeg and added toasted pine nuts to each layer.   Next time I think I'll also add a little sage.  It was great!  The whipped cream on top seemed odd but worked fine.  My only complaint is the high fat content  -  but it's so filling you won't eat too much!

This was wonderful! One of my favorite recipes from this sight. Made it exactly as directed and although I am prone to tweaking and changing recipes, there is no way I would change a thing about this one. Thank you so much (and your dear aunt too!).

I tried this recipe last night and it was excellent! I did make a few modifications after reading the suggestions by others. 

I added a whole bag of frozen spinach to add color and nutrition; I put the spinach on top of the 2nd layer of sauce. 

I also took the suggestion of adding onion. I did this by sauteeing a whole chopped yellow onion in the butter, before adding the garlic for another 1-2 minutes. 

I also added about 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to the sauce- an excellent suggestion from my husband! 

I didn't whip the cream before pouring it on top- perhaps the reason for a few crunchy noodles on top. 

We are healthy omnivores and we did NOT find this dish at all bland, and it was not overly rich.  I will definitely be making this dish again!

This was fantastic!  I made three major changes: I used a sugar pumpkin instead of a squash, I made my own lasagna noodles (which I boiled for about a minute since they were raw), and added fresh nutmeg.  I brought this to a pot luck and it was the first thing to go.  The whipped cream sort of threw me, but since it was so moist and decadent, it might have been added just to make sure nothing dried out as it baked in the oven.  I highly recommend this!

This is fantastic. Followed the advice of other reviewers and added 2 layers of fresh spinach -- didn't make the dish taste "spinach-y" at all. Definitely skip the whipped cream; the dish is plenty rich without it. Lastly, I fried up a little sage and added it in when I added the squash. The herb gave it a more rounded flavor.

The concept was good. The sauce was a little on the boring side, hitting only a few flavor notes. Still, I'll likely use the concept again but play with the flavorings in the squash bechmel sauce.

I was excited to try this, but was a complete let down.  This was overly RICH, heavy, lacking in flavour and just boring.  Will not be making again.

3.75  Did add more garlic and cannot see the merit in whipping the cream, pouring it on would have had same effect.  Had fresh lasagne so nothing would be tough.  Guess it needs basil or spinach or something per previous reviewer, kinda greasy, good, but not to be made again.

This is wonderful, and just as good the next day.  I actually didn't mind eating leftovers several days in a row.  I made it as written, and also with regular lasagne noodles, cooked according to the package.  I think that it is much better with the regular noodles.

This was very, very good - even my two-year-old ate it.  The butternut squash goes so well with the garlic.  I didn't use the whipped cream topping - instead going with a classic ricotta/egg/mozarella mixture.  Next time I will take some other's advice and add pesto and/or spinach.

This is FANTASTIC! I also added layers of raw spinach before cooking and served over a bed of raw spinach for an extra veggie. I cut out the cream topping for dieting purposes although I am sure it would be amazing. Even my 11yr old son was "surprised" that it actually tasted good, ha!

AS is, I give this 4 stars. The only change I made to the lasagna recipe was adding fresh basil. I poured a LITTLE bit of water over the top noodles, since others mentioned they didnt cook all the way, maybe 1/8 cup? VERY little, but enough for the noodles to have something to absorb and they were great.   FOR 5 STARS: On the side I made a mushroom sauce, and tried both without and with the sauce spread on top. The sauce made this OUTSTANDING!! 5 stars for sure! The savory mushrooms went SO well with the sweet squash. I got the idea from a restaurant that made butternut squash/mushroom lasagna, the butternut squash was like the cheese and the mushroom was the sauce, and it was made just like regular cheese lasagna. AMAZING I love it. Despite being a little labor-intensive, I will definitely make this again :D

I made the recipe exactly as written and I think it was awesome.  My 3 year old even had seconds!  And my husband, who was "dreading" dinner when I told him what we were having loved it.  He felt bad for doubting me :)  Excellent recipe, thanks a million!

I just can't say enough about this recipe.  I did toast up some pine nuts and after the noodle layers I sprinkled some pine nuts and some fresh baby spinach.  That was all I did to alter this recipe.  It was outstanding!  Fantastic change of pace and my family will definitely be enjoying this many times in the future!

I made this tonight and it was really good but it is rich.  I, like many others, tweaked the recipe some.  I sauteed the garlic, onions and mushrooms and then added that to the butternut squash.  I also added nutmeg to the sauce like several suggested. I also layered with fresh spinach and it was really good.  To cut some calories I used fat free half and half so I just poured it over the top, but next time I will make a little extra butternut squash filling and put that on top with some cheese.  I will definately make again!

My husband and I weren't too excited about this one.  It was good, but it really needed something.  Maybe sausage. I think it's a good base for building on and will definitely do so.

AMAZING!  If you are looking to try something new and love butternut squash - this is a must try!  I added a lil spinach as the other uses mentioned and it gave it a nice texture and hint of green.  I think I have told everyone about this recipe - so so good!

This recipe was amazing! Quick and easy to prepare and not a lot of clean-up. My only suggestion is that next time I will use about a third less milk. It doesn't really need a whole quart.  Thanks for sharing this!

My husband even loved it, and he is generally not into vegetarian dishes. I skipped the whipped topping. I will definitely make it again. I think next time I'll layer in some smoked sausage and spinach to make it more hearty. I think those flavors would really complement it.

I've made this recipe multiple times, and at this point have people who offer to pay me if I'll make and share! The only change I ever make is that I add something green... sauteed spinach or something. But it's good just as is, and I'm glad to have the recipe.

I thought the dish was OK as is. My noodles kind of floated to the top of the dish so the top layer of noodle was kinda crunchy.  I also had puddles of the cream on the top that I blotted off with a paper towel.  I think it might be a good recipe to build on to.

i had some odds and ends ingredients to use up and this fit the bill.  i took some liberties with it (as i mostly do, it's a character flaw, don't judge me. :-)  )  i was very much pleasantly surprised. i did not think i would like this so much, but i really do.  i had some roasted squash in the freezer, along with some leftover ricotta/mozzarella cheese.  throw in those last 9 sheets of leftover lasagna noodles, and i have a medium size casserole made without having to shop for anything!  i did not use the cream on top as this is something i would not have on hand.  turned out delicious.  thanks for the recipe ANNARICCIJOHNSON!

Amazing! And tastes so gourmet! The only thing I did differently is that I completely omitted the whipping cream and didn't miss it. Also, I added spinach layers along with the Parmesan. It was delightful. We had leftovers several times and it reheats really well!

This was pretty good. I added more garlic, mozza and a layer of red peppers, spinach and fresh basil. Next time I'll add some chili, more black peppar, and my hubby wants to try it with tomatos in it. A good vegetarian dish and a great way to use butternut squash.

This is one of my absolute favorite recipes. I like to add a few whole sage leaves dipped in olive oil to the top of it to jazz it up. I make it as is other than that.

Soooo disappointed.  I wanted to l o v e this.  'Wasn't bad, but pretty much butternut bisque with parmesan.  I even added another squash to lessen the creaminess.  I added minced onion as so many others suggested.  To me, eventhough it was only a quarter cup (for two butternuts & the rest of the ingredients as listed), it was very strong tasting instead of a flavor enhancer.  I didn't add garlic since butternut is so delicate.  Onions weren't old, but still no doubt they were in there.  Final note:  not bad for soup, but a lot of work & dishes.  If you're going to try this, buy the frozen squash & save yourself a little time.

I added more garlic, some nutmeg, and some cinnamon. Delish!  I had some trouble getting the cream to whip, so I ended up just doing what other reviewers suggested and pour the cream over the top.  I definitely did not use a whole cup though, probably half a cup.

I added spinach at the very bottom and in the middle. It was super good, but kind of time consuming, next time I think I will eliminate the heavy cream, would be good with just the cheese. All in all, it get's a yummy from this reviewer!

This was so good, but a lot of work.  I added sautéed mushrooms, and spinach in another layer.  I didn't use the cream sauce, and it was fantastic.  I will make again for special occasions.

I feel like I'm eating butternut squash soup... amazing.  I usually add spinach in between the layers and add some nutmeg/cinnamon to the sauce.

SO good! I did add some onion in with the garlic. I also left off the whipped cream. Instead I saved a very small amount of the squash sauce for the top layer and put a bit a fresh mozzarella on top. Will make again and again!

This was really good! I did modifications to make it lower fat. I used skim milk instead of reagular milk and only used about 3 cups. I also left out the cream step and I think that would have made it over the top rich so I am glad I didn't use it. I added a layer of spinach and also chopped up some onion that I added to the butternut mixture. I didn't have enough parmesan so I added skim milk mozzarella.  I also added some nutmeg and thank goodness I did because it would have been super bland without it.  I pre-soaked my noodles and that worked super well. My husband did not like it, but it would be a fantastic treat for guests as it is tasty and filling, but not too rich.

excellent....added spinach because we are spinach lovers, my kids LOVED it, they were digging in before i even got it in the oven.  Used the heavy cream as described but in the interest of calories I will probably omit next time b/c this is sooo good I think we won't miss it too much..thank you!

I liked that this was a unique way to use butternut squash, but to me all of the flavors were very heavy (squash, cheese, milk)--it felt like there needed to be something tangy or different to balance it out. I used some motzarella cheese along with the parmesean, which I think helped, plus some basil.

This is out of this world delicious!  I did do a few things different.  As other readers said, I quickly dipped the noodles in simmering water before placing them in the dish. I also added one large onion to the garlic mixture, sprinkle of nutmeg and dash of basil.  Didn't think the nutmeg or the basil really made that big of a difference.  I short on regular parmesan but did have an italian mix (mozzarella and parmesan) on hand which i used. I also had some leftover ricotta that I used up on the last creamy layer.  This recipe is definite keeper!  Next time I'm thinking about adding either roasted corn or a layer of spinach...

Oh wow.  I was unsure what to think of this recipe as I made it, but it turned out incredible.  Made recipe as written, except added a bit more flour and some nutmeg to the sauce.  Had everything ready to go, but then realized I had somehow managed to forget to add about a 1/4 of the squash to the sauce.  Not wanting to waste, I sprinkled the remaining squash over the top and put some slices of mozz over the top.  UNBELIEVABLE.  OH, also added crumbled bacon to the two layers (hubby hates anything without meat).  Will definitely make again.

Really good!  Tastes really cheesy without all the mozzarella  :)  I also put some spinach in middle layer for added health benefits, and it worked great.  Not sure about the whipped cream on top of the lasagna, and I may leave it out next time, but there WILL be a next time!

This was really good and fairly easy.  I added a lot more spices than the recipe called for - allspice, a little cinnamon, chili powder, and a bit of basil.  I also just mixed some ricotta, mozzarella, and cream to make the creamy top layer.  We loved it and the leftovers are great!

This was AMAZING! I spread some home-made pesto on the noodles while assembling the lasagna, but other than that, followed the recipe. I served it for a dinner party and got rave reviews from all the guests. Will definately be making it again. Thanks for the great recipe!

I made this exactly as stated in the recipe and my family enjoyed it but it was too rich/heavy for me. Made it again this Christmas with a few adjustments, and it came out perfect (for me). I added one onion, and doubled the garlic. And following the other recommendations, added a bag of fresh spinach, increased the amount of butter nut squash, but the best tweak of all, adding a 5 ounce package of fresh basil! This is a great recipe, and easy to adjust to your particular taste!

I made this for dinner tonight and it is delicious!   The garlic adds so much flavor but is not overwhelming.  I used 2% milk and Barilla oven-ready noodles.  The pasta was perfectly cooked without dipping them in boiling water.   I did not add the heavy cream topping.  I'll definitely make this one again.

I have made this recipe twice. The prep time is much longer than the 30 minutes stated. The sauce takes at least 20 minutes to cook down and I added 2-3 additional tablespoons of flour to get it to thicken. However, this is a delicious and versatile recipe. The first time, I added onion and spinach. The second time, I also added mushrooms and red pepper. I did not use the cream on top, just some of the sauce and some mozzarella cheese. Depending on what you put in it, and how much chopping you need to do, allow at least 2-3 hours, not counting the bake time for the squash.

I made recipe exactly. It was tasty and rich.  A few bites was sufficient and  I would make it again, but about 1/3 of this recipe would be more realistic.

This recipe was amazing! I never knew butternut squash could taste so good. My family loved it also. I will make it again, but this time I will either omit the top long cook lasagna noodles or cook they first. It’s no big deal but for some reason, the top lasagna noodles or crispy/hard. I also added sautéed spinach for color & mozzarella cheese like some of the reviewers suggested. I believe the key to this exceptional recipe is adding the right amount of salt and pepper which I did, thank God, because I taste tested after I added the butternut squash to the cream/milk mixture.

My family loved it!   I made the recipe as described, with a few additions.  I added chopped onion to the garlic, plus a layer of mozzarella in the middle.  I also soaked my lasagna noodles as was suggested by another reviewer.  That’s about it, and it was spectacular!

This was a big hit with my family. I was asked for the recipe several times. The men really loved it and had seconds! I made it with four layers and added the fresh spinach. It gave it some color and texture. My suggestion would to always use fresh parmesan cheese, not the pre-grated (flavor is not he same) trust me it makes a difference. Enjoy!

Yowza! I found this to be sweet. Was it the squash? I don’t think so.... Hmmm.. Willwill make it again but will use half and half instead if whipped cream. Hopefully that’ll help. I was surprised how all of that liquid absorbed or disappeared. It was not liquidy at all.

This was really good.  Great squash flavor with a hint of spinach.  I did NOT like the oregano in this dish; it was overpowering.  The next time I make it I will leave out the oregano!

We are trying to eat fewer meat based meals, this is a keeper! I had some zucchini which I cut into strips and used as extra layers. I mixed up the sauce by adding the cream in and reserving 1/3 for the final topping with an egg beaten in, it gave a lovely crisp top with browned nicely.

Sorry, this did nothing to convince my husband to eat anything meatless, and he loves Alfredo sauce. I always make the dish according to the recipe the first time. Very one note. An onion and basil probably would help, but way too much Parmesan for no flavor in the final dish. Mozzarella might help. I’ll just stick to my “normal” lasagne next time.

I added cooked and well-drained chorizo on top of the sauce layer.  Added tons of cheese to each layer and topped off with loads of cheese which I broiled after cooking.  I stole all these ideas from another online recipe.

This was seriously delicious, BUT the whipped topping basically liquefied as the lasagna was in the oven, and it came out looking like I had put a stick of butter on top before baking it. Luckily, it was delicious regardless. Not sure what I did wrong, but I will likely just omit the whipped topping next time.

Very rich but very delicious! This recipe is very time consuming but in the end, it is very enjoyable. I added sweet onion, and nutmeg but stayed true to the recipe. This will stay in my favorites. Served with a crab app and white Pino Grigio. Great special meal. My husband is a meat eater but I did not miss the meat.

My 1st time making this. My guest loved it.... I was not sure of it while it was baking .....
I did not use as much milk as the recipe called for. I used maybe 2 cups and made it 2 days ahead of time.. 
just remember to let it cool.
Taste was amazing....

I first made this recipe a few years ago, and it has since become a main dish on Thanksgiving or Christmas for us. We have tried a few additions, including a little onion with the garlic and some fresh spinach added to the layers. We love it!

I took this to share with some friends for our monthly dinner and game night and they went crazy over it!  The only thing I changed was to add a layer of fresh spinach because I had some I needed to use up.  I'm looking forward to making this again soon.

I followed the advice of others and added ore Parmesan spinach and nutmeg. I also used won ton noodles. Glad I did that because the pasta to squash ratio was good, and the spinach lightened the recipe a bit. I used fresh spinach that I sauteed first. Next time I might try frozen chopped spinach. I used whole milk in the custard and half and half to top the casserole. I did "mush" the top down to make sure the last layer was well coated so that the noodles didn't dry out. Everyone loved it.

I followed the recipe and suggestions, making the following modifications: whole milk subbed for all dairy (Fair Life) for lactose intolerant issues, caramelized onions and basil  in the squash sauce, one layer of canned spinach - drained, no cream on top.  I could eat this all day long!   Next time I'll go with skim milk because it's very rich.

I've made this lasagne for my husband's birthday for several years now. I don't normally make it any other time because it's so rich. (low cal it ain't!). But it's just an amazing lasagne. While we eat it, it seems like with every bite we say "omigod, this is so good!). I don't change a thing, I make it exactly according to the written recipe. Enjoy!

This was a great recipe. It had the buttery fall flavor that comes from butternut squash. I couldn't help but add some other veggies to give it more depth. I did put the butternut squash in the processor after roasting it.

I am not a fan of the no-cook lasagna noodles.  They didn't seem to cook enough.  (That is why this only merited 4 stars in my opinion.)  I also added leeks to the garlic in the sauce and added a layer of uncooked baby spinach to each layer.  The (somewhat skeptical) family really liked it.

I chose to omit the heavy cream and am glad I did as it was plenty rich for us. I layered in some fresh spinach per other reviewers comments and a little (2 tbsp) more flour too as I had trouble getting it to thicken. Plan to add additional spinach and maybe some steamed broccoli and cauliflower next time for a little higher veggie content.

Made this for the first time tonight and it was fantastic!  I followed the recipe as prescribed and the flavor was perfect!  I can easily see how small additions like spinach or cubed chicken could enhance it a bit, but as it's written , it is quite good!

I too changed a few things. I used Ricotta cheese instead and omitted the whipping cream. It was wonderful!!!

I pulled out a muffin pan and threw together (messily) "tiny little lasagnas" with various ingredients (parm, mozz, ricotta, spinach, basil, mushrooms) that I gathered from the comments.  It took an extra 10 minutes to do before laying the entire dishes together and it was so essential to how it came out.
- Be careful with the type/amount of cheese in this recipe.  A lot of the cheese suggestions in the comments will mask the flavor of the squash.  We were going to use mozzerella but it really overwhelmed the entire dish.  I use only parm and sprinkle on a full-coverage thin layer for each parm layer (see layers below).
-Our layers (from the bottom) are  squash/noodles/squash/basil/parm/noodles/squash/basil/parm/noodles/cream/parm.
-For the noodles, we bought the refrigerated Whole Foods lasagna egg noodles.  They are super tasty and so easy.

Excellent and a good way to use up my abundance of butternut squash. I used two medium squash and chopped them before adding them to the sauce (after roasting). I added a layer of fresh spinach as I layered.  I would use much less butter next time-- maybe one tablespoon. I made in the afternoon, cut it into small pieces, reheated it and took it to a party. It was a hit!

Excellent base recipe. I was dining alone, so I made this in a loaf pan, using approximately half of the quantities.  I added tons of nutmeg, some diced onions that needed using, and 1/2 pkg of frozen, defrosted,spinach. I just mixed all he non noodle parts together, including the cheese, and tempered about 2 tablespoons of egg beaters in the bechemile and mixed it in.  Made layers of noodles alternating with sauce.  Baked about 1/2 hour.  Then uncovered and let it brown 10 min. Delish!

It was really good, it did taste a little like macaroni and cheese. I ran out of Parmesan so used about half Parmesan and half mozzarella. My husband said he would like me to make it again and I am going to send it to my daughter who is a vegetarian.

This was delicious! Everyone wanted the recipe. The last 5 min I put it on broil to give it some color.  It also made a great meal as leftovers. I will be making this for Thanksgiving.

My husband and I both thought this was very time consuming to make, and extremely "blah." It lacked the punch of flavor that would have made all the effort worth it.

I thought this was a really good recipe. I followed the recipe almost to the "T". I made it as a main dish which I found to be my issue. It has good flavor but the taste and texture become a little monotonous as a main. I will make this again but it will be served as a side dish to a pork chop, perhaps.

I made this the way the recipe called except for two things. i added finely chopped vidalia onion and I used the regular boiled lasagna noodles. It was good, but time consuming and it was missing something. I think some herbs or something else I can't quite put my finger on. Definitely add the onion. It would have been extremely bland without that. I will be making again but with more flavoring.

Such a great recipe.   I followed it to a T, and didn't change anything but using whole wheat noodles.  I took it to my parents for  sunday night dinner and everyone loved it.  will definately be making again.

Delicious! My fiancé loves garlic, he eats whole cloves! (it's good for the blood). However, not necessarily a recipe to eat before socialising, as it could prove overpowering, but still very good!

Great meatless dinner. Tried using smoked mozarella, awesome. I did omit the whipped cream on top, became a pool of grease during baking. Planning to take this as a turkey alternative for a family Thanksgiving dinner.

Super yummy and different. My friend made this for me and I made it for the first time tonight, the only thing I noticed different from the recipe was that it took about 20 minutes for the top of the lasagna to brown in the oven. I can't wait to make this for my extended family.

This was a pretty good dish, but I think would have been sort of bland as is.  I did add some nutmeg, a touch of white pepper, some roasted red pepper and walnuts.  Oh, and I also used the good old fashioned boil them yourself noodles too.  :)  Thanks for sharing, it was for sure something different and interesting!
