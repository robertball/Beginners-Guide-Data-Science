I added onion (because we love it) and lemon zest instead of lemon slices.  I think next time I'll try pinot noirs 1/2 with broth. . .yummy

The chicken turned out tender and moist. I kept a lid on the pan the whole time, which gave me broth while browning the chicken. I used this for my broth. just had to add a little water to it. I used two bags of the Uncle Ben's rice because my chicken pieces were so big. I thinks this recipe would be good with mild fish as well.
