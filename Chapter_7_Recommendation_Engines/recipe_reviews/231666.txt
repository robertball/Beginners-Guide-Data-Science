This is the same recipe I've always used (just want home to double check my recipe, so I looked this up to find a similar one), but I use milk instead of water...fantastic!!! Also, if you sprinklea thick layer of  flour on top then roll up the noodle mixture before cutting, then cut, you can get thinner noodles if you want. Also, I lay the mixer out for a couple hours to dry...evenly on both sides. They hold up better I think.

This was the perfect recipe for a cold winter day.  Noodles turned out perfect, used lots and lots of flour when rolling them out.  Thinner noodles is the key.  Be patient with your roller as the dough will appear to be tough but worth the roll out time.  I rolled out the dough a cup or so at a time. The extra flour on the noodles will thicken the broth. I cooked the noodles half way before dropping the chicken back in for the last 10 mins.  The only additions I made was chopped onion, garlic, carrots, bay leaf for depth.  Family loved it!

Five stars for the noodles alone. Super simple and delicious. I had great results cutting the dough with my pizza cutter. I liked that the noodles  weren't completely uniform, were clearly homemade and were more rustic. They puff up a lot when cooked, so I would err on the side of cutting them pretty thin vs the recommended size or bigger. I also thought the noodles were even way better the next day after they sat overnight in the broth. Texture was incredible. Pillowy but still a bit firm.
These are too simple for excuses.

I have been making this recipe all my life. I remember rolling, cutting, and unrolling the noodles with mom when I was a little girl. Now it's cooking on my stove as I type this. Kids came down sick and this is ALWAYS the big request! They refuse to eat any other chicken soup. I do lay out the noodles 5-6 hours to dry before cooking. They hold up better while being boiled. This even freezes well in freezer bags when illness hits quick. I just run the frozen bag under warm water to loosen, then dump in the crockpot to heat on low for a few hours.

I used 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts and also added carrots, onions, and celery for color. My broth didn't look as thick as what was in the picture but it still turned out delicious. I had to use 6 tbsp of water for the noodles in order to get it to form into a ball.  It was hard to roll the dough thin enough. I ended up rolling it in smaller pieces so I could get the noodles thinner.

I MADE MY NOODLES AND THEN DRIED THEM A LITTLE IN THE OVEN AT 175 FOR ABOUT 30 MINUTES. I ALSO ADDED A CAN OF CORN AND COOKED UP SOME FRESH GREENBEANS AND SHALLOTS IN BUTTER AND SHERRY ON THE SIDE FOR MY NON-PICKY EATERS TO ADD TO THE SOUP.

I made this as per the instructions, although I threw in a medium sized yellow onion, (half chopped half sliced paper thin, for texture and flavor), half a bunch of cilantro leaves, diced, three garlic cloves minced, and some celery, chopped. Oh and fresh cracked pepper, I'm sure you will all season as you like, but this came out amazing. Good luck!

Was absolutely wonderful I made a few small changes. I added carrots, celery, onion, fresh parsley, and garlic. Also used leg quarter because I prefer dark meat.everyone including my picky kids loved it.

Used a couple pounds chicken thighs, not sure I would use a gallon of water next time?  Maybe a couple cans of chicken broth as well as 2-3 c water as another had done.  Maybe even use a little milk to make it slightly more creamy. Added carrots, celery seed, garlic cloves and parsley, will also use a bay leaf next time. Tossing noodles in flour is a must for me to help thicken broth.

I was looking for a chicken and noodle recipe that didn't call for canned soup in it and something close to what my grandma makes. This recipe was easy to follow. I didn't use chicken breasts instead I used drumsticks (I already had them) and I didn't use a gallon of chicken stock I used 2 cans of chicken broth(that's all I had) and 3 cups of water. Flavor was good but I was not satisfied with the noodles because they weren't cooked long enough even though I cooked them for 25 minutes. I will definitely try again but I'll make sure my noodles cook throughly :-)

First time I've ever made homemade chicken and noodles and this was very simple and very good, and to be honest... I don't even like chicken and noodles! I made them for my boyfriend, my brother and his wife and they loved it! I did add a few things.. I added celery, onion, carrots, thyme and garlic (whole cloves) to the stock when I cooked the chicken and removed when chicken was finished cooking. Then added thin sliced carrots and celery back to the stock and cooked until soft then added chicken and noodles. This recipe changed my mind about chicken and noodles! Also wanted a richer noodle so I added an extra egg yoke!

The noodles were great!  I rolled and cut them by hand using a pizza wheel for ease.  I cut them thin and let them dry a few hours. I used 5 tablespoons of water in the noodle mix. (It was a very cold, dry day)   I made stock using a whole chicken, along with onion, garlic and a bay leaf.  I also put a few chicken bullion in the pot (Wylers) for extra flavor.  Family really loved these homemade noodles.

Great base for a chicken noodle soup. Saute thin slices carrots and diced onion, minced garlic in olive oil first. Add stock. Cooked ckn breast in instant pot then shredded.  As for the noodles, add 1/2 tsp salt and another tbsp or two water. Slice super skinny noodles, they fatten up!

This is a great base recipe. I added carrots and celery, thyme, and parsley. This is a great noodle recipe, though for this recipe you will end up with a pot of noodles and a small amount of broth. I would add more broth, or cut back on the noodles. I love noodles, so it was mostly a bowl of noodles for me which was great. Would have given five stars but I think it would have been a bit bland without a couple basic spices.  I also added some corn starch near the end to thicken it up as my grandma's soup was always like gravy (yum!).

I did add onions carrots & celery.  I made the noodles "by hand" old school style, put the egg in the middle of the flour and they turned out great!  Used leftover turkey & stock from Thanksgiving, yum!

I made this in the crockpot!! Super good! I also added carrots (4), celery (4) and garlic (2 cloves). I didn’t have enough room for it all in my 4qt crockpot so I’d definitely recommend either half the ingredients or put it into into two crockpots! Unless you have a nice big crockpot of course! The noodles were amazing!! I also used 7 Tbs of water and lots of flour when rolling out!! Loved this recipe and will be making it again!

Added carrots celery and onion and boiled/simmered until almost tender. Used rotisserie chicken that I chopped into chunks, and brought to temp before adding noodles. Will leave noodles covered with more flour next time to thicken the soup. And noodles needed about 8 tbsp of water.

Bland as written. I cooked a whole chicken instead of just breasts (enough water to cover chicken plus a little more).  Added veggies (carrots, celery, onions (and mushrooms for earthiness/depth)) and seasonings (s&p, sage, thyme, bayleaf) to water when cooking chicken. Remove veggie solids from broth and add fresh (sans mushrooms) when making soup. "Pinch" of salt not near enough for 3 cups flour - need 1 tsp. Same with liquid, 2T not enough (I used milk), ended up using 9-10T (but I used only the yolks; I wanted more texture/flavor/color in the noodles). Let dough rest in refrigerator wrapped in plastic wrap at least half an hour, up to overnight, before rolling out. Let noodles dry out on rack before cooking.
