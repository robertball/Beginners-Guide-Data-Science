My husband cannot usually tolerate orange juice but this is one soup that he loves and it loves him. 
Beside being absolutely delicious it is so healthy and quickly made.

This is a perfect soup to go with a cool summer lunch.  Easy and simple.  I struggled with the kid rating.  My daughter loved it, but a friend was resistant to even try a cold soup made with fruit.  Bon appetit!

Did not care for this. It smelled good but the consistency we didn't care for. Also, we didn't find it to be sweet enough. I am sure you could add some sugar to remedy this. It was easy to make however, just not for us.

A great way to use up cantaloupe. I used 3/4 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice and threw in a peeled orange. Pureed all the ingredients in my food processor for about 1 min, but I still thought the soup was too thick.   So for those that thought the soup was too thin, adding some fresh orange segments definitely thickens it up!

I used 1/2 a cantaloupe and 1 cup OJ, same lime and cinnamon..  It would make a great breakfast drink, or add some vodka and ice for an evening daiquiri. The taste was great; I think it's more suited to a drink than a soup.  My 9 year old wants it for breakfast, and my 13 year old was afraid to try it. 5 star for taste, 1 star for soup.

I think this recipe has potential.  I made it exactly as written an thought it had a bitter taste, but I used Tropicana orange juice and tht could have attributed to the bitterness because the cantaloupe was as sweet as could be.  I loved the cinnamon, very nice touch.  I'll try again with a different brand of orange juice or a different juice all together, maybe a mango juice...

This was a very good and easy soup.  The cinnamon and lime juice are the perfect addition to the soup!  My 22 month old couldn't get enough.

So good and so sweet.   I used 3/4 cantaloupe and 1 cup of orange juice, pinch of cinnamon, and 1/2 a lime.  Make sure you use freshly squeezed orange juice, and not the tasteless frozen concentrate type!

Best to use cantaloupe that was in the fridge.  I had to add ice cubes to chill it quickly.  Used Pine-Orange-Banana juice and it was great.  I wish it was a little thicker... Maybe less blending next time or throw in a banana to thicken it.  Suprisingly delicious!

I made this according to directions and found the soup to be a little lacking in flavor.  I think part of the problem was the cantaloupe was not ripe enough.  To enhance the flavor and thicken the soup, I added some mango, a bit more lime juice (maybe 1/2 a tablespoon), about 1/4 teaspoon more cinnamon, a pinch of salt, white pepper, and a drizzle of honey.  Along with the mint leaves, which I would not consider optional, the soup is very good.  It's great for a summer lunch.

Have a dinner party for 8 tomorrow.

We're on our fourth version of this soup TONIGHT. First we tried it as written.  Hubby did not care for it at all. I thought it was fine. Then we tried it with melon #2 and fresh squeezed clementines (we didn't have any other oranges in the house) and no cinnamon, but we ran out of clementines and decided to mix a bit of batch one with this batch, and then hubby still disliked it (he blames it on the cinammon).  I thought it was still fine.  Then we went to the grocery and picked up melons #3 and #4 and juicing oranges.  Made it again without the cinnamon but with juicing oranges.  Hubby still didn't like it.  I still thought it was fine.  

Now we're on melon #4 and we did the standard Cantaloupe Mint soup -- puree a cantaloupe and add a bunch of fresh mint leaves and puree again.

Delicious! I used a bit less Orange Juice for Consistency, and a bit less Cinnamon for taste. It was perfect!  A great dessert to compliment our dinner, and healthy too!  Wonderful.

This recipe is more of an appetizer rather than a dessert. The amount of cinnamon (in my opinion) is overwhelming the soup, It takes away from the melon. I would skip/or add a pinch, but thats about it. As far as garnishes are concerned, you could add melon balls or add some cream in it.
 Sadly, this recipe didnt go well with the guests.

I saw this same recipe on a different website and the recipe was almost the same , the only difference is the other one had 1 cup of honey as well. I would think that would take care of the taste and consisitancy that everyone is complaining about. Honey gets really think when chilled.

Not bad if you like the taste of cantaloupe. My preschooler didn't care for it, but
it was a tasty way to use up half a large cantaloupe that I had sitting in the 
fridge. Very healthy.

I made this with 1/2 cantaloupe, 1c orange juice, a small lime with a dash of cinnamon. Soup was a bit watery so i threw in a banana. I had some strawberries that needed eaten so I put 6 in as well. Turned out great after the additions!

Loved this light, healthful, delicious recipe.  It is important that your cantaloupe is fully ripe.  I left out the cinnamon, but added a bit extra lime juice for a straight forward, uncomplicated flavor explosion.  As another reviewer stated:  Use excellent quality OJ. Also, the more chilled it is, the better.  I had a similar recipe at a high-end tea room and love being able to recreate it at home.

Delicious and refreshing! If you are not used to cold soup or expect a sweet, thick texture you may not care for it. However, we loved it. If you want to try an even simpler version, just pureed melon does the trick too!

I added 1/3 cup of half and half to make it creamier.    ohh, and  I didn't have a lime on hand, so I used the juice of half a lemon and also added 2 tbs. organic sugar. I thought it was a tasty and refreshing summer soup. yummmm

I just made this today Wed. June 23, what a refreshing idea.  I loved it, but next time I am going to use less orange juice, as I found the juice overpowered the other ingredients in the soup. Other wise I probably would have rated it a 5 star.

This is a fab soup and was a big hit with dinner guests. However, I think it's better with half the amount of orange juice, double the amount of lime and a generous amount of ginger (I used fresh and put it in the processor).

This was also delicious the next day as a smoothie.  This recipe could also be made as a punch and would be good with brandy or vodka mixed in.

The flavors never blended together.  The cinnamon was way too noticeable.  It just didn't work.

It was an interesting soup idea for a hot day.  I liked the idea of the cold fresh soup. Overall it was not very thick which did not bother me.  I felt it had too much orange juice, which in my opinion distracted from the ripe Cantaloupe flavor.  I also used ripe sweet cantaloupe but the soup seemed to be lacking the sweetness I expected.  I think that had to do with the amount of juice added.  I might try this recipe again but double the amount of cantaloupe.

Great!  Light, refreshing, and nutritious.  Keep in mind that the taste of the soup heavily depends on the taste of the melon -- make sure it is ripe!  If the melon doesn't taste good, the soup probably won't.  I put chunks of melon through the ChopWizard onion chopper, which prepped it nicely and quickly for the food processor.

After reading previous reviews I was skeptical of the flavor.  I agreed that it needed to be sweeter.  I adjusted the recipe by using only half of a large cantaloupe, added about 1/4 cup sugar and 1/2 cup fat free plain yogurt.  This made it more like a smoothie and was great with breakfast.

I think I added too much cinnamon (I eyeballed it instead of measuring) but even with the right amount of cinnamon I'm not sure I would have like it. I don't think I'll be making this again.

This was super simple to make and yummy to eat .  Since there is absolutely no heat involved, this is the perfect thing to whip up for a light dinner  on a super hot summer day.  And I love the fact that there is no added sugar.

I made this as written and it is a very tasty and refreshing soup or drink.  It definitely needs to be chilled thoroughly so plan accordingly. I will make it again but will cube and freeze my cantaloupe the night before, add a touch of mint in the blender and serve it in a pretty glass with a mint spring on top!  Nice for the summer.

I made this for good friends, who loved it. So simple. I held back a bit on the orange juice since I didn't know how many cups of cantaloupe were expected, and it was great at 1 1/2 cups of oj. I added a bit of salt.

I used a ninja...maybe I didn't 'process' it enough, but it was still somewhat a little chunky.  any suggestions?  other than that, I love it.  tastes great and definately really easy to make.

I really wanted to like this, but the consistency was strange... kind of like a thin slushy, and the flavor reminded me of an orange julius drink.  It just didn't seem like a soup at all.

Yum! My cantaloupe wasn’t very sweet so I added a bit of mango and a little bit of swerve sweetener. As a light summer snack, appetizer or dessert it’s perfect as is! For a meal, I mixed in some unflavored protein powder and topped with some unsweetened coconut flakes to boost the nutrition. Looking forward to using this recipe quite a bit this summer!

Welp, this sounded good and I followed the directions, but it did not taste good. Out of a family of five, I was the only one who dared to eat some. Everyone else took a taste and refused to eat more. The rest if getting poured down the drain.

It's an interesting idea, and maybe it would suit someone else, but we won't be making this again.
