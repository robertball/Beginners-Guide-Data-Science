Read someone's review about frozen salmon and baking it on 450 for 15 min and broil for 3. Turned out perfect. Thank you. I struggled with broiling frozen fish before. For the first time it turned out great.

Glorious! I used a filet of salmon instead of the steaks but it worked out very well. The melted butter and soy sauce form a crust over the top with the seasonings, and paired with the tender salmon it's just mouth-watering.

I added about a tablespoon of brown sugar that really added to the flavor yet it kept it very simple.

This is so easy, yet so delicious. On the advise of others, I baked, covered, in oven until fish was done. Just as good heated up the next day. Thanks!

An incredibly easy, delicious meal. I don't like lemon pepper so I used Mrs Dash salt free garlic/herb seas mix. I baked it at 350 for 20 min & it was wonderful! Very quick & flavorful. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good and  really quick and easy to prepare.  I prepared it exactly as shown.  Next time I would make a couple changes: I would use a broiling pan rather than a baking sheet, I would baste and sprinkle one side, broil for 4 minutes, turn it over, baste and sprinkle the other side, broil for 4 more.  This worked very well with my gas broiler - I will definitely make again.

Awesome... I lined a cookie sheet with tin foil brushed it with olive oil. I layed the fillets skin side down. I brushed the butter and soy sauce on and sprinkled with lemon pepper then covered and baked @ 400 for 25min. Then i uncoverd and broiled for 5 more min and basted the salmon with the left over butter and soy sauce... very flavorful and juicy tender!

Made this for the wife last night.  I used brummel and brown yogurt spread stuff instead of butter, and low sodium Kikkoman soy sauce.  I tasted the butter/soy sauce combo (I TATSE EVERYTHING!) before applying it to the salmon, it really was delicious.  

No need to brush the sauce onto the salmon, it's not thick like BBQ sauce.  You can just pour it on.  It's gonna run off anyhow.  

I coated the fish with lemon pepper, maybe i should have just lightly sprinkled.

The recipe doesn't mention any flipping, so being a man obsessed with computers, photography and not cooking, I naturally didn't flip it either.  It began to get black on the top after about 5 minutesin the broiler.  I told my wife, and she asked me when I flipped it.  HAHAHA So i flipped it.

The blackened portion was actually tasty, the lemon pepper was lemony, and i enjoyed the fish.  However, it came out of the pan with all kinds of unattractive blackness on it, and it was on the greasy side.

I'm gonna try it again, changing the following:
Unsalted butter instead of brummel
less lemon pepper
A dash of olive oil added to the butter/soy mix before applying to fish

I have been using allrecipes.com for several years and have enjoyed many many recipes, but this is the first review I have ever written.  This salmon was the best I have ever made.  My family said so.  I didn't change a thing.  Served it with a 6 bean salad and fried potatoes.  I will make this often. Thank You

I used frozen salmon filets so instead of broiling it, I baked it from frozen according to package instructions.  (450F for 20 minutes....I actually just baked it for 15 minutes then broiled for 3) This was really good.  Even my youngest ds who hates fish was able to eat it.  I'll certainly make it again.

I somehow wasn't expecting much from this recipe despite the good reviews, but I was wrong.  This is one of those recipes where a few simple ingredients elevate a good piece of fish into something special.  

I was tempted to bake instead of broil but decided to follow the instructions.  I'm glad I did since it resulted in little crispy brown edges that were amazing.  I basted the fish with the remaining butter/soy mixture several times which gave the fish a beautiful rich color along with more flavor.

Timing was a little difficult since I had one large fillet that was uneven in thickness.  When the thinner sections were done, I simply turned off the broiler and left the fish in the oven for another 5 minutes.  It came out juicy and perfect throughout.

I'll be making this often!

This was a very delicious and simple recipe!  I baked it in the oven for 30 min at 350, and it came out very tasty and moist.  I will definitely make this again.

This was awesome..I don't usually like salmon but my husband convinced me to find a recipe and make it for him. I used the same amount of butter/soy sauce but for only two fillets and baked them covered with foil in a 9x13 pan on 400 for 25 mins. I'll be making this again soon :)

This was very good!  I just substituted canola oil because of my personal diet and preferences.  Also, used Mrs. Dash Lemon Pepper due to salt restrictions.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing!

This salmon turned out very nicely.  I did not have lemon pepper seasoning so I added fresh ground pepper, lemon zest, and lemon juice.  I didnt find that the flavor of the soy sauce stood out at all, but I think that added a sweetness to the final taste.  I baked it at 350 for 20 minutes covered, then 5 minutes uncovered.

Yes, incredibly simple but incredibly lovely as well!  I tried it by broiling and decided that wasn't going to work too well . . .so after about 6 or so minutes of broiling I switched to 400, baked it for 10 mins, then flipped and baked for another 5, then broiled for another 3 minutes or so.  That worked perfectly, so I'd suggest baking, broiling, flipping, then baking and broiling again.  Lovely flavor, especially since I brushed the olive oil and soy sauce on both sides, as well as used lemon pepper on both sides.  Thanks for the recipe!

I use a 1-lb Atlantic salmon fillet, and broiled it on high for 6 minutes -- fantastic! Simple, flavorful recipe. I had about a quarter of the fillet -- my boyfriend ate the rest!

I made this last night for our anniversary dinner. I'm not really a fan of fish, but this was SO GOOD. The only slight problem I had though was, since I was using frozen fish as soon as I started brushing the mixture on the butter hardened back up! It was nearly impossible, so I just spread some of the mix on top of the fish and wrapped them in tin foil and baked them for 15 minutes. The butter mixture melted and stayed right where it should be and all was well. Broiled for a few minutes on each side and PERFECTION. I also didn't have any lemon pepper so I used regular pepper and lemon juice.   Sheesh.. I'm rambling. Verdict: Will definitely be making this again and again. YUM!

I'm not usually one to leave a review, but I felt this one necessary!  We love fish, but I rarely venture to baste it with anything aside from seasonings.  My husband loves the way I cook our fish and I don't think he would've ever suggested I change what I'm doing, but his comment to me last night was "this is the best fish you've every cooked!"  I cannot take credit from where credit is due, so THANK YOU for a super simple, yummy concoction!  We are a VERY busy family and making dinner is sometimes a rush for us, but it just doesn't get any easier than this!  **added 9/29/09** have since made this a couple other times and this last time I made it, I thought to add 1 tsp. of honey to the butter/soy sauce.  I probably would add even a little more next time, but the hint of sweet was ideal with the soy/butter!!

Salmon being my favorite fish I'm always looking for new ways to prepare it. Very delicious. I like mine rare almost raw so just cooked it for 8 minutes in oven under 400 degrees.  Added slices of lemon to cover the steaks as well.

So easy and delicious.  My only substitution was Mrs. Dash instead of  lemon pepper.  I'm sure it is just as good with lemon pepper, but hubby has to watch his sodium intake and with the soy sauce, I tried to reduce the sodium as much as possible.  SO good ... SO moist ... SO flavorful!  Simply outstanding.

I did as some reviewers suggested and baked it on a foil lined baking sheet at 400 degrees for about 15 minutes. I also sprinkled a tiny bit of brown sugar over each fillet (maybe a teaspoon) along with the lemon pepper seasoning. It was really moist and delicious.

This recipe was absolutely delicious!  My boyfriend and I tried it out the last night, and it was a definite winner.  We made a few adjustments to the baste and broiling method as was suggested by others.  We added 1 tsp of brown sugar, chopped parsley,and a dash of olive oil to help thicken the baste so it clung to fillet better.  We applied the baste to one side and sprinkled on the lemon-pepper, broiled for four minutes and turned the fillets over (with a spatula, preferably due to the tendency of the fillet to break apart).  Basted the other side, sprinkled evenly with lemon-pepper and cooked for the remaining four minutes.  Which helped a lot with the "burning" that was mentioned in some other reviews.

It was a definite success.  Very easy, very quick, yet it seems so upscale.  Thinking of making this for my Father and Brothers when they come home from vacation.

Have made it twice now, but cooked it on the grill.  I can't say enough about how EASY and DELICIOUS this recipe is!  My two-year-old gobbled it up too!  We used thawed frozen salmon fillets, FRESH lemon and freshly ground pepper and it was outstanding.  We are about to move to a location where we can get great quality fresh fish daily...and we can't wait to try it on good quality fresh salmon!  UPDATE (9/19/12):  We tried this recipe cooked as written (broiled) using fresh fish and, I have to be honest...it was not nearly as yummy to our taste buds.  We Will definitely stick with using fresh fish now that we are on the coast, but will probably only grill it.  We grill it using instructions from another website, but here is the gist of it: 
Use the indirect grilling method with a medium hot grill.
    Grill fish 3-4-inches from heat.
    Place salmon steak/fillet skin side up directly on the grill grate.
    Grill the steaks/fillets for a total of 4-6 minutes (2-3 minutes per side) per ½ inch thickness, turning only once. 
Salmon continues to cook after being removed from the grill. Cook salmon until the meat begins to change color and becomes flaky. To check the flakiness, insert the tip of a sharp knife near the bone or at the thickest part of the salmon and pull slightly. Well done salmon appears opaque and will flake easily.
Thanks for sharing this recipe Chanelle, you sure do have a winner here!

Loved this recipe!  I used a liberal amount of lemon pepper and it was perfect.  The glaze soaks in so nicely under the broiler and the fish turns out flakey, tender and wonderful!

I have never been a fan of fish but this was quick easy and tasty. We only keep  low sodium soy sauce which was good because I only had lemon pepper salt seasoning. I didnt need to use the entire sauce. I did season both sides

Every time we tried to cook salmon it always came out dry. We were a little hesitant with just the 8 minute broil, but it came out cooked thoroughly and succulent. We added a little more (salted) butter and less soy sauce. We brushed the HOT butter and soy sauce mixture on the salmon, which I think it braised the salmon just a little, trapping all the juices and flavor inside. The prep time was more like 2 minutes and broiled for 7 minutes. A meal ready in less than 10 minutes if you do not count the pre-heating the oven part of it. We pre-heated the oven to 400 degrees by broiler only. Did not burn like some of the other reviews. The butter/soy mixture left a slight caramelized coating on the salmon. Definitely a recipe we will do again. Maybe we’ll try to add some brown sugar next time?

Excellent recipe- easy, simple, tasty. I tried the suggestion posted to cover with foil and bake at 400 for 20mins. Will be making this again but might leave uncovered for the last 10 mins.

I have made this several times now, and I would definitely opt for cooking the salmon in foil in a 425 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes over broiling it with no foil for 6 to 8 minutes; the former way really seals in the flavor and juices better.

Loved it!  I followed the suggestion to cook frozen filets at 400 for 20 minutes and then 5 minutes on broil. This recipe will come in handy on those days when I forget to take something out of the freezer.

My son LOVES salmon, but hasn't been thrilled with the ways I've been cooking it.  He LOVED this recipe, and I just cooked it at 350 F for 20 min. covered with foil, then another 5 uncovered.  PERFECT!!!

This was very tasty!  Simple with just three ingredients, too!  I used this brush/sprinkle on amber jack fillets and they turned out wonderful.  I even sauteed some fresh mushrooms and accented them with more lemon pepper seasoning!  YUMMO!!  :-)

I've been meaning to reviews this recipe for ages but I'm only getting around to it now. Wow! Absolutely delicious! The only thing I had to do a little differently was add lemon juice and fresh pepper because I didn't have any lemon pepper seasoning. I don't think it makes a big enough difference to render my review pointless:) My husband isn't crazy about salmon and really only likes it blackened, so he was very unimpressed when I said I had cooked it differently. Well, he absolutely raved about this:) I didn't want to broil it so I did what someone else suggested and cooked it in the oven for 18-20 mins at 400. They were very thick pieces, though, and cooking time could probably be reduced for thinner pieces.
One tip I would give others, since the sauce is so thin and completely runs off the fish, is to keep it face down in the sauce for about 30 mins or so before you cook it. I always feel it lets the flavor soak in more.

Excellent, simple, quick recipe. It's now in the regular rotation:)

Me and my husband LOVED this. The only thing I changed was that I marinated the fish in the cooled down butter, soy sauce and seasoned with the lemon pepper for 1 hour. Only cause I had extra time. Popped it in the oven @ 350 degrees covered in foil for 15-18 minutes, mouth watering!

I made this just before Easter and it ended up looking like MissZee_22's picture, so thats one sign that I did it right. The other sign is that no one could put the fork down till the salmon was gone. Awesome, simple, and quick recipe even for guys like me who have little patience when I'm hungry. And thankfully no obscure and expensive ingredients needed when the salmon alone costs alot.

Interesting flavor combination. I used I Can't Believe Its Not Butter light and mixed with the reduced sodium soy sauce until it was of runny paste consistency then put it on the salmon. This was a bit salty for us (and our blend of lemon pepper seasoning doesn't have a lot of salt). We will have again but cut the soy sauce a bit. UPDATE: we had this tonight grilled and it was fantastic, much better than when baked.  I reduced the soy sauce to 1 tablespoon of the regular stuff and added about 1 teaspoon or so of lemon pepper seasoning.  The flavors really popped on the grill.  Served it with chive smashed red potatoes and grilled zucchini and everyone was very happy.

This was great! Not too salty and not too spicy. I grilled this on my stove top grill and it really gave it a nice crunch.

I did not have lemon pepper so I used 1/2 a lemon squeezed, and 1/2 tsp black pepper. I also wraped the fish in foil before baking it. My husband and I loved this fish. My husband usually complains when I make fish, but all he had about this recipe were compliments.

Giving this 4 stars instead of 5 because the cooking time was a bit off for me.  Didn't use particularly thick salmon filets but even at 8 min in the broiler, bottom was still rather on the rare side.  10 min and it would have been perfect.  That being said I made the sauce mix (double the amount) and used it as a marinade as well.  Added it to the filets & let soak for about 2 hrs.  Then added the lemon pepper & broiled.  I'm not a salmon fan, but the hubby is and he said it was delicious.  It smelled really good cooking as well.

We made this with fillets, baked at 350 for 20 minutes and it was devoured quickly!  My toddler ate her entire portion and asked for more.  We will definitely make this again.  I may play a bit to get some flavor deeper into the fish.  I think doing a light marinade for a short time would help. Also adding a bit of orange juice to it might tweak the flavor some.  Over all it was a huge hut!

My boyfriend claimed this was the best salmon he'd ever tasted! I broiled a whole salmon for about 15 minutes on the Low broil setting on my oven, just until the thickest part of the salmon was firm to the touch. It was great! very juicy and flavorful.

My husband said it has an interesting flavor but very good!! I used the conventional oven and baked it at 400 degrees, and following the suggestion of someone who reviewed the recipe, I created a pouch w/ foil. I had to bake for over 30 minutes because of the thickness of the salmon. Smelled great!

I used this recipe when I made salmon for the first time, and, despite my errors, it came out great.  I thought I knew more about how to cook salmon than the recipe did, so I was cooking it on low, and after 20 minutes, the salmon was fit for sushi.  So, I turned the temperature up to medium (as the recipe suggests), and then it started cooking!  The butter started burning in the pan, but it ended up coating the salmon and blackening it, which we actually ended up loving!  The second time I made it, I kept the temperature at medium, but flipped the salmon a couple times, letting the butter burn onto the fish.  Maybe not how the recipe intended it to turn out, but we think it tastes great like that.  The lemon pepper adds a great kick to it, so I make sure to apply it liberally.

This salmon was moist and very tasty.  I probably would have given it 5 stars because my 5-year old and I really enjoyed it, but my husband was only so-so on it.  (although he doesn't much care for salmon anyway).  I had frozen salmon fillets, so I followed other reviewers suggestion for baking it at 425 for approx. 15 minutes, then broil it for a few more minutes.  It never dried out, as frozen salmon sometimes does in the oven.  Delish!

Pretty good.  Nice and very easy to make.  I marinated it with store-bought marinade for a couple days and used salmon filet instead of salmon steak, but other than that I made it exactly the way the recipe called for.  Nice with steamed vegetables.

The only thing I'd change is the cooking time.  It wasn't cold, but it wasn't hot either, so I put in back in the oven and baked it some more (on top of initially broiling it).

Love this fish!  Don't think I will broil next time though, I had it on lower as not to burn and then it took longer to cook and it was too hard to judge time.  Next time I will grill or just bake it.

This turned out really nice!  It was simple and tasty.  Though, we thought next time we'll try the longer time a lower temperature, because we had one thick piece of salmon that just refused to cook through.  I think it took about 15 minutes rather than the recommended 8.

5 stars because I am not a huge salmon person (my husband is) and I found this to be both easy and very good.  I used Atlantic salmon from the meat market instead of the bagged salmon in the freezer section and that may have made a difference.  I covered and baked for 15 minutes on 400, then uncovered for 5 minutes.  It's really good

We have made this several times, and alter ingredients with what is on hand and what we are looking for that night. We are not huge fish people. Yet we are always looking for more with this recipe. My kids love it usually ask for seconds and thirds. It makes baking Salmon super easy and fast. I took another's advice and did the 20 minutes on 400. Cooked completely and still juicy!

This is great tasting and quick.  I used mahi mahi because I didn't have salmon but I know it will be delicious with salmon too.  I marinated and peppered then broiled it for 5 minutes, turned it over and re-marinated underside and put lemon pepper on second side and broiled for 5 more minutes - they were thick fillets.  I can't wait to try this with salmon.  Thanks 315.

Very easy, very good.  I baked mine in the oven at 375 for 25 mins.  Next time I may bake for 20 mins and broil for 3 mins to crisp up a little.

So easy, so tasty, and so good for you!  The only change I made was I used a squeeze of lemon with the butter and soy as I was out of lemon pepper.  Also I broiled the salmon in a toaster oven - didn't need to heat up the kitchen on a very hot day...

I have made this twice now.  My whole family (kids too) loved it.  I used a large fillet of salmon with the skin still on one side.  I made a foil boat and placed the salmon on it and grilled at 400 degrees for 20 minutes, skin side down on the foil. It was perfect.

As one reviewer suggested I baked the salmon at 400 degrees for 20 minutes covered with foil.  Instead of using the lemonpepper, I used the pepper grinder and sprinkled the salmon fillets with pepper and then placed lemon slices on top of the salmon.  It was very moist and had excellent flavor.

Tried it with fresh caught steelhead fillets. We don't have a lot of fish eaters in the family, but they devoured it. Followed the recipe as written, and baked at 400 degrees for about 25 minutes. Came out perfect.

The taste of the fish wasn't good but not great. I'm giving this only 3 stars though, because broiling this marinade filled the whole house with smoke, resulting in having to open windows in January...

Loved it! I broiled the fish, as it doesn't take as long (10 minutes for an inch of thickness is perfect) and my husband ate it up and asked if saved this recipe to my recipe box! (yes, I did!).

Incredibly easy and delicious. I've made this a few times. Once, I ran out of soy sauce and had to use teriyaki instead. Amazing. Great with mashed potatoes or couscous on the side with steamed broccoli or green beans.

This was simple, fast and fantastic.  I followed other advice to cook for 20 minutes and broil for 5. It was absolutely perfect. My son would have eaten three pieces if I had let him! One warning: be careful not to overdo the lemon pepper. I shook too much on on parts of the salmon.

This was awesome.  I also added a dash of Worcestershire sauce to the melted butter.  I ate this alone with water and a lemon wedge; so delicious! :) I will definitely make a rice pilaf and some vegetables next time.  Thanks!

Used Pampered Chef Asain Seasoning instead of lemon pepper since we were out. Loved it.

I prepared this tonight even though I was out of lemon pepper and it was terrific.  My teenage son loved it.  I used a little fresh lemon juice, sea salt, and fresh ground pepper instead of the lemon pepper.  I used a skillet to cook it and it came out perfect.  Simple yet delicious.  I have tried more elaborate recipes that weren't as good.

I don't love salmon but I wanted to cook fish one night so I tried this recipe.  My boyfriend and I both agreed it was the best salmon we have ever had.  It was so easy and quick to make and tasted great.  I'll be making it over and over.

Fantastic!  My 7 year olds ask for it all the time now.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so used lemon zest and black pepper.  It is heavenly! Thank you

I have made salmon on the grill using  olive oil and lemon pepper for years and it is always a hit.
This was better. I used Smart Balance  margerine instead of butter, but otherwise followed the  receipe.  I did get smoke from the oven, but it came out great.
I am going to try the same receipe on my Foreman grill and this summer on the Charcoal.
Thanks for a terrific and simple idea.

This was so easy to make and so delicious.  I broiled it just like the recipe stated.  It was done in 8 minutes.  So tender and tasty.  I will make again, and again.

Love the ease of this recipe and the fact that it got great reviews from the hubby & kids. Didn't have soy sauce so I substituted Tempura Dipping Sauce. I think it worked just as well. Yumm!

If I could rate this a 4&1/2 I would. Very good and the best thing about it, it was very simple. I actually used a 16 oz. fillet rather than the 4 (4 oz.). It just took a little longer to cook (about 11 minutes). Other than that, I followed the instructions exactly. Oh and the reason it's not a five: my hubby rated it a 4 and my two year old wasn't impressed - but I loved it!

Very good for a VERY fast recipe. I cooked outside on the grill, over medium coals, on some aluminum foil spayed with Pam. I don't like the smell of fish in the house, but I love the end product!

My husband's exact words were... "Baby, this fish is excellent!!"  Yay!  I too thought it was very good and very simple.  Only thing I did differently was to bake in the oven for 30 minutes at 350.

This was really great.  I had salmon fillets and baked B (covered) at 400 until done.  I brushed them with 1/2 the butter / soy sauce mix and stick them in the fridge a couple hours.  Then i brushed them with the other half and sprinkled with lemon pepper just before baking.  I can’t believe how flavorful it turned out!

This is a wonderful recipe. It was easy to follow after I read a few of the reviews. I baked the salmon filets at 375 for 20 mins. Covered with foil. Then I removed the foil and broiled for 7 mins. I also added some onion powder and a sprinkle of garlic salt. It was delicious.

I made this in my toaster/convection oven, on a foil-lined baking pan. It was done in about 6 minutes. I squeezed a wedge of fresh lemon juice over the fish after cooking. It was delicious! It surprised me that I really couldn't tell that soy sauce or butter was part of the recipe. It was a great combination!

This was delicious.  Now I have a new protein recipe for my son!  I have never broiled salmon before but it worked beautifully and cooked so fast (I started on high but moved to medium/350 so it wouldn't dry out or cook too fast).  The recipe was fantastic.  The only change I made was to add the lemon pepper directly to the sauce for even distribution.

Super easy to make.  Whole family loved it.  I did change the baking method to one that I use every time I bake fish.  Preheat to 500 with baking sheet inside.  Once it reaches 500, drop to 275. Take pan out and place fish on it.  I did wrap the fish in tin foil to preserve moisture which results in needing to bake longer but it turned out super moist so the extra time is worth it.  I baked it for about 18-20 minutes (depending on your oven).  I checked the temperature of the fish at 14 minutes & again at 18, making sure it internal temp was at least 125.  Once it hit that temp, fish was done...and yum!

This salmon tastes great.  Moist and tender.  When my husband wanted me to make it, I did not have soy sauce so I used 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar and 1/4 maple syrup. and mixed it on with the margarine.  I also added some Mrs. Dash Chicken season.  Once. I spread that on the Salmon, I then sprinkled Mrs. Dash lemon pepper on.
My husband absolutely loved it.

I made this using fresh, wild caught salmon. It was very good and so easy to prépare.  The leftovers were gréât as well.  It really only takes a few minutes to prépare. I ate it with homemade cole slow and some diced baked red potatoes. Enjoyed it and will make it again.  Also, very healthy.

I made this with all the ingredients listed but added a sprinkle of garlic powder. Instead of broiling it, I liberally sprayed a pan with Pam, then cooked it in a toaster oven at 450F for 25 minutes, for the size of our fillets. Our fillets measured  1 1/2” x 7 - 8” x 2”.  My husband said they were the best dang salmon he’d ever eaten. I thought they were fantastic, too.  Definitely a five+.

This is the first time I’ve made salmon and it was delicious.. my 14 yo son even liked it.. my father enjoyed it and I grilled it for about 7-10 minutes total. 3 small steaks like the one in the pic.. I did squeeze some fresh lemon juice on before cooking them.

Everyone loved it!  My son said it was restaurant quality.  I did the same as a few other reviews and baked it for 10 minutes at 450 then broiled for 3 minutes.  I will be making it again.  Nice easy recipe!

Delicious!  It was a hit with the whole family.  I did use Organic salmon rather than farmed.  More expensive, but worth it.

Made this just for two so had less fish but no matter. 
Used fresh not frozen salmon and fresh not dried
lemon zest. Fresh cracked pepper and a light drizzle
of fresh lemon juice from the zested lemon.
Grilled on a George Foreman type contact grill
skin side down. Light nonstick spray on bottom
plate and brushed top with melted unsalted butter.
Very light delicate flavor and great fresh fish taste.

no changes & was great!  My fillets were about a third of a pound rather than a quarter (0.313 lb), so I had to bake longer--about 4 minutes longer, but it tasted great.

Great tasting recipe. My dish doesn't look very appetizing but it tastes great. I wish I had a nice crust but I didn't follow the directions fully. I didn't melt the butter ( just put spats on top) and I did 450 degrees, 8 min. bake, 3 min. broil.

Super easy and it was so good! Instead of lemon pepper, i squeezed a lemon and used ground pepper. I also halved Brussels sprouts and had it cook in the butter, lemon, soy sauce mix with the salmon. It was all a hit!

This fish recipe comes out moist, flaky, and flavorful, however, however, I have a CAUTION to those who use gas broilers!

In the recipe, it states to use a "baking sheet" in the broiler. I have  a broiler pan, so I instead made a tin foil "tray" thinking this would be similar to the baking sheet and create less mess than cleaning up the broiler pan.  At the six minute check, my fish was done.... but it was also in a sea of FLAMING butter!! My broiler pan was placed on the lowest possible distance from the flame. It took a moment to blow the flames out, and the pan headed for an open window to send the smoke away. Despite the flaming butter, the fish was unburned, and crunchy on the outside from the butter/soy sauce/lemon pepper combo and moist and flaky on the inside. Next time I'll definitely use the double pan feature of the broiler pan!

My review lost one star due to the safety factor. In the author's defense, they instruct you to "brush" on the sauce - but it's so thin it runs off the fish anyway.

I will make this many times again, both as written because we like lemon pepper and with the changes I made tonight which are more oriental in nature. We enjoyed it immensely. Since I wasn't in a lemon pepper mood tonight I chose to use garlic pepper and added it directly to the butter and soy sauce. I added 1 teaspoon lemon juice for the lemon flavor and 2 tablespoons sesame seeds for some crunch. Also two teaspoons brown sugar. I do agree with one reviewer that the sauce began to blacken about 5 minutes in, I thought it was due to my adding brown sugar, but he attributed it to the butter. I may follow his suggestion to do a combination of olive oil and butter to see if it makes a difference. By far the best broiled salmon I have ever made and I have tried many recipes.

I have made excellent recipie in excess of 6 times....I do vary the amount of lemon pepper seasoning I apply since some of my family prefers a less spiced salmon... For my tastes I use a heavy application,  my wife prefers a lighter application... all in all this is  great way to serve salmon....I am cooking this tonight! (wild caught Sockeye  salmon)   I will vary the leoman pepper seasoning based on known tastes  of my family....

Followed the recipe as written and put it in the broiler for 8 minutes which made it a tad dry.  Next time I'll broil it for only 6 minutes.  Fast and easy.  A definite repeat.

PS:  Made it again using EVOO instead of butter, drizzled the soy sauce over the fish then sprinkled on the lemon pepper.  Broiled 6 minutes which was perfect!

Hey, I forgot the butter, but it still came out tasting fantastic.

 This was met with apprehension, but was highly complimented by a constant critic.  Best salmon I have had, in a long time.

We make this at least twice a month, baked at 375 for 15-16 minutes. Serve with broccoli or asparagus and rice and pasta dish.  Quick and easy meal and tasty enough to be our most often prepared supper.

This was an awesome recipe!! I did do some changes instead of using lemon pepper seasoning. I used  lemon juice and pepper,  with brown sugar, butter, and soy sauce.  I than poured over the salmon and baked it for about 20 minutes. Came out great and I will do this again.

I first want to start out by saying this was a quick and easy dish to prepare, and the salmon ended up delicious! I’ve prepared this dish twice now, exactly as written, and both times I’ve had difficulty with the broiling part. For some reason the butter/soy sauce marinade burns on the pan and ends up smoking up my kitchen/apartment and sets off the smoke alarms. Once I figure out what I’m doing wrong and how I can cook this without the smoke side effect, I’ll definitely start making this more often. Overall, I definitely recommend this recipe!

Baked the recipe in foil for 20 at 400. Used lower sodium soy sauce & smart balance spread to make it a bit healthier.Husband & I both love the recipe. Have served this to guests who also like it. Made this many times.

I didn't change a thing, baked in foil pan at 400  20 min.
Husband loved it, salmon can get to dry if your cooking it any longer than that, and it doesn't need to be covered.

Broiled about 5 inches below heat source; worked great.  Substituted Coconut Aminos to reduce sodium.  Excellent.  Will try a smidge of honey next time

Good, a little on the simple side, but good. My salmon steaks started out frozen so I had to play with oven temp before finishing under broil, and ended up overcooking a bit (also smoked up my kitchen as I started out at 450 and the soy sauce/butter burned - very bad idea). Even overcooked it was still decently juicy. I'll definitely give it another try.

This was so easy and the family loved it!  I made as written, except I added some minced garlic and lemon slices atop the filets and juice from 1/2 a lemon.  I think next time I'll add a splash more lemon juice.  I had no problems with moistness having broiled them.

Good. I tried like a previous reviewer said, 450 for 15 mins, but fish came out dry. Luckily, I like my fish a bit dry, but just watch it at 450.

very nice and easy recipe.. only change i made was adding some sea salt to the salmon and a tiny bit of adobo to each side before the lemon pepper.. I also broiled mine in a cast iron skillet and drizzled the remaining butter/soy sauce mixture over the salmon when it was done.. nice fore dipping while eating.
