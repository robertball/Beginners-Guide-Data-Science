This is absolutely delicious.  The entire loaf will be gone in less than 24 hours.  I cannot believe I found such a delicious gluten free/sugar free banana bread.  I added chopped walnuts to the recipe because I love walnuts in banana bread.  This is going to be a go-to gluten free recipe.  Even if you aren't gluten free, it's just so delicious and rich.

So I read almost 48 reviews to see what worked when people liked it and what didn’t work. Was determined to make this for my husband and I, as  we are doing a “time off” from carbs to see if it gives us more energy (though love carbs- def going back).
Swapped a few items cause I didn’t have on hand. Replaced 1 banana w 1/2 c applesauce; lemon juice (fresh) for the apple cider vinegar and avocado oil instead of coconut oil. 
Mixed the eggs together until smooth and continued that idea every time I added the wet ingredients. One at a time and mixed it until it was very smooth. Slightly sifted the almond flour and mixed all dry very well. Then poured in slowly to wet mixture. I usually make regular banana bread and have to say the consistency was very close. Had no issues w clumps or dryness. In fact it was very moist before and after. Did bake at 325 for one hour then 300 for 15 minutes. The flavor is wonderful -sweet but not very sweet. Can see adding vanilla yogurt on top...oh which I did add chocolate chunks shaved on top. Presentation wise looks great. Very happy- thank you all who gave their thoughts- it really helped w this recipe!

I tried making this, followed recipe exactly and when I mixed the flour in the mixture became entirely powdery, it was not a batter at all. I tried to bake just to see and of course it didn't do any magic and become an amazing loaf. I have banana crumble if anything. Very sad cause it seemed amazing as I was making it.

this banana bread turned out great. made a few changes: I did 2 cups almond flour and 1 cup coconut flour (I didn't have enough almond so I subbed with coconut cause I dont like to use regular white flour); I didnt add nutmeg (again, didn't have any); addes chocolate chips for the kids, and because chocolate is always a bonus. tastes great, nice and moist. ill be doing this again, hopefully with nutmeg next time.

Very good. I made cupcakes out of them, and added chocolate chips to half of the batter and raspberries to the other half. Both were good. I found the bread / muffins  better the following day after they had been refrigerated: they held together better.

Nut-crunchy, dense, and delicious! Tweaked it, of course, to add a bit more protein. I'm not celiac, so I substituted 1/2 cup of the almond flour for 1/3 cup Vital Wheat Gluten and 1/4 cup flaxseed meal to bump the protein & omega-3 and give a somewhat fluffier texture. Added a scoop of vanilla whey protein powder as well, used egg substitute rather than whole eggs, and used Nosalt for half the salt. Finally, made this in 12 muffin tins, with 8 chocolate chips each in 6 of the banana-almond muffins. Result has 18.6g fat, 12g protein, 22g carbs, 4.7g fiber, 12.5g sugar & 287 satisfying calories per muffin, by my count.  And it's SOOOO banana-yummy!

Delicious.  The only thing I did different was caramelized the banana's before hand by slicing them up, putting a little raw honey on them, and baking them in the oven for about 15 min. I also added a little extra cinnamon and nutmeg ( seasoned to taste). Overall this was so good I had to keep myself from eating the whole thing.

Love this recipe! I used agave nector instead of maple because I didn't have maple, and switched out nutmeg for pumpkin spice and added a tsp of orange powder! Yummy! Next time I'm thinking about omitting the eggs for apple sauce to appease some vegans in my life. Thank you for sharing this!

The recipe says bake 1 hour at 350 degrees Fahrenheit. After one hour it was the texture of peanut butter.  After 1 1/4 hr. I finally turned the heat up to 350, which it should have been in the first place! 

Almond flour is new to me, so I thought maybe it does need a lower temperature, but after checking other recipes I’m convinced 300 degrees was a misprint!

This is probably the most delicious banana bread I've ever had!  The almond flour gives it a nutty taste and great texture.  I did not have the vinegar on hand so I used 1 TBSP of lemon juice instead and seemed to work well.  It needed more than an hour to cook and I probably could have kept it in a bit longer, as the end resulting bread is extremely moist and falling apart a bit!!  But so yummy!!!

Do not cook on 300 it completely raw on the inside the whole thing is garbage. What a waist of my time. I questioned it at 300 but followed the recipe perfectly....... epic fail.

Absolutely loved it. Best recipe wit the  ingredients most people will have on hand.
Made it twice.
The first loaf, I was impatient and didn't have the exact ingredients.  I substituted maple syrup for the honey and lemon juice instead of Apple cider vinegar. 
I wouldn't use maple syrup again.  It gave it sort of an odd flavor.
I do want to say though that the package of almond flour I had said finely sifted,  I still went ahead and sifted it. 
When I read through all of the reviews, I noticed comments about too much moisture.  That the time baked might need to be longer or the temperature higher.
I decided to bake it  at 320 degrees  for one hour.
It looked fantastic when it came out of the oven.
It is very dense and heavy with a fine and very moist texture. I think that liking this or not would be a personal preference.  I like a moister bread. This was a little on the too moist side. Possibly in my case because I left in the loaf pan(Pyrex loaf pan) too long after it came out of the oven.  Part of it  stuck to the bottom.  The rest was fine, and firmed up by the next day a bit.
I also prefer a sweeter  bread. I will try additional sweetener next time.
Second time. 
All ingredients  listed except sweetener.  Substituted 3/4 cup of brown sugar instead.  Also used white vinegar.  Didn't have the other. 
Decided this time to bake at 315 degrees for one hour and fifteen minutes. (Just a guess).
I didn't hear the timer so I think it baked another ten minutes or so.  It still tur

I made this Banana bread and it was amazing!!
I used coconut oil instead of the spray oil in the pan. I also used a glass cake pan,  1.5 qts.  Rectangle and it was a perfect size for this recipe. The only other thing I did was add toasted pecan pieces that I had left over from some cookies I had made. Probably about 1/2 cup of pecans.  I liked that this bread wasn't super sweet, just sweet enough. I did have to bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe called for. I checked it with a knife, until it came back clean.  I plan to make this again very soon.  All healthy ingredients as well!!!

I'm currently gluten and dairy free and I had a few bananas begging to be put out of their misery so hence I had a go at this banana bread. Really liked it and will definitely cook again however I used almond meal instead of the almond flour and I substituted Nuttelex ( non dairy spread) in place of the coconut oil (due to high cholesterol in the family!) . Thanks so much for this recipe.

I'm not sure what purpose the apple cider vinegar serves.  There's so little yet you can taste it very prominently, and I personally have a weak sense of taste.  I may leave that out next time and see if it makes a difference.

This is super good! Not too sweet and a great alternative to white flour banana bread.

I added some walnuts and  ground flax seeds.

One caveat to this recipe--your eggs need to be at room temperature or else the melted coconut oil will harden when it comes in contact with the eggs.I had to beat the living daylights out of the batter and I still had to pick out clumps of hardened oil. Another reviewer mentioned using avocado oil. I'm going to try that next time.

I made these as muffins and had to increase oven temp to 350 as they were just sitting there at 300.

This is very yummy & feels very healthy & grainy. I separated the batter into 2 loafs and baked for 45mins at 170 Degrees Celsius. For 1 loaf, I added some sliced Almonds, dried sour cherry & choc chips, the other loaf I left it as it is as I wanted to try the original recipe. Both loaves were VERY GOOD! Will make again!

This recipe says to put the oven on 300, and my bread was a pudding mess with slightly cooked edges after an hour. I think you meant 350, but now this bread is probably shot. Yay.

It is a bit too moist thereby falling apart even with cooking it at 1 hour 15 min at 300 and 15 min at 325.  It is delicious though and I will cook it at 325 the whole hour next time.

I loved this recipe.  Often the texture of gluten free recipes is greatly different from a traditional one.  While this still has the texture of almond flour, it is the best recipe I have found to date.  It's yummy too!
I only had two bananas so I used about a 1/3 cup of pumpkin as a replacement and I combined maple syrup and honey to equal the 1/4 cup.  I found the flavor and texture even better after refrigerating. 
Keep in mind the calorie count on this one is high ( I calculated about 2,600 per loaf).  But a nice slice or two with coffee in the morning is perfect.

Delicious! Only had two bananas. Used just over 1/8th cup of avocado oil instead of coconut. Still plenty moist. Baked at 375 for about 15 minutes since I was already baking something else in the oven. Then reduced to 350 for about 25 minutes more. Came out beautifully. Will definitely make again.

Followed the recipe, added walnuts on the top with a little sprinkle of sugar.   We liked that.  The bread is very moist and dense, but not very sweet. 
When I make again I'll add more honey or agave.

I added chopped walnuts and made them as muffins. They came out dense but delicious. The walnuts added a nice crunch to them as well. I'll definitely make this again.

Great. I accidentally left out the honey and baked it in a 9 inch cake pan for only 45 minutes, so it turned out not so sweet, but perfect for my family.

This was really bad. My whole family thought it was not edible. I think it was the apple cider vinegar. It left a weird- sour and tangy after taste. I really wanted to like this recipe but maybe I’ll omit the acv next time.??

Cooked as written, the bread is super dense and looks unappetizing inside - too many bananas/liquid for the amount of flour.  Overall taste is not bad, but I wanted more sweetness. I will try amend this recipe next time by using 2 bananas instead of 3 and adding  2 table spoons of brown sugar, or sweet golden raisins, and nuts. Suggested 300F oven temperature is a mistake, I went  with 350F per others suggestions, and it took 45 min to bake two small loafs from this recipe.

I absolutely, positively dislike this recipe! I literally followed this recipe to the letter and the result is BLAND! I can't see anybody enjoying this banana bread unless they lack taste buds or on a very strict gluten free diet. I will go back to my original recipe with bleached flour *sigh*

Disaster!  I followed the recipe and it  is a hot mess!  Thankfully I don't have to eat gluten free and wanted to make this to use up the almond flour that I have.  I don't know if the issue I had has to do with living in high altitude or not, but the bread is dry and tasteless.  I'll stick to my traditional non gluten banana bread.

Made this to use some old almond flour and bananas and it turned out much better than expected with my horrible baking skills! Only changes were using agave in place of honey and vegetable oil in place of coconut oil and it turned out amazingly! I also added chocolate chips. Highly recommend!

I know that I'm using almond flour and honey rather than wheat flour and sugar, but the flavor of this recipe seemed bland to me. I was expecting more banana flavor, which was hardly discernible, even though I used over-ripe bananas that were very sweet. I love banana bread and I guess that if I want that flavor I will just have to make it the traditional way. This bread wasn't terrible, but for me it just wasn't banana bread.

Awesome healthy banana bread! I did not use the honey (I was trying to make them really healthy) and they were still good! I made muffins instead of a loaf as well. Next time I will put some blueberries in it or some dark chocolate would be awesome as well!

Bread turned out well. I was short on almond flour so used 1 cup almond flour and then 2 cups Bob’s red mill all purpose gluten free flour and added x1 tsp xanthan gum. I stuck to recipe otherwise but had to leave it in oven another 15 min.  It has very mild banana flavor. Next time I will bake at 325, and perhaps add chopped walnuts. It could use a tad more sweetener but I appreciate the lower amount as a type 1 diabetic. Overall, the family enjoyed it and I will keep it in the rotation. Running low on groceries today so it’s going in the kids lunches & they couldn’t be happier!

This came out great! I used a combo of almond flour and gluten free flour, brown sugar instead of honey and I added chopped candied pecans. I made a loaf and had enough left over to drop into small muffin cups.  My family loved the consistency and it wasn't too sweet.

It came out soooooooo delicious. Almost everyone in my family preferred this version of banana bread than another one I made with all purpose flour. I will definitely make it again

Since I don't like the taste of coconut, I substituted  coconut oil with olive oil and added finely chopped walnuts to the mix. The recipe is a success and I like the texture and taste.

I made this recipe exactly.  It was very dense and moist AND it was consistently cooked all the way through, not mushy in the middle! I like that it uses 3 bananas, good way to use browning bananas. It toasted well too.

Made it.  Easily done and added an additional banana.  1st time baking with almond flour and so far I'm not impressed.  Not too much flavor.  I'm using alternative flours for health reasons and having fun in the kitchen.

I changed from coconut oil to extra virgin olive oil. Not sure how much a difference it made. My loaf got stuck in the pan even with cooking spray so it broke coming out and is all crumbly.

Bravo! I never thought I would eat something that tasted this good gluten free! Only issue I had was using a dark pan, I cooked it for about 1 1/2 hours, and it was still a little too soft in the middle. Perhaps the size of the bananas? Will def make again!

I used 2 cups of almond flour,  1/4 cup of coconut flour (because I like the texture of mixing) and one extra egg. I also drizzle molasses on top and chopped pecans before baking. Came out GREAT! Yum

Awesome! No sugar added and plenty sweet enough. My boys and bride loved it! I added walnuts and a splash of allspice. The melted coconut oil coagulated as soon as I added it to the wet mix, so add it at the very end of the blend. (Poet) ;-)! Cooked them at 350 and it worked perfectly.

This bread is so delicious and so moist! I didnt have nutmeg so I used allspice instead. My bananas were on the large side so I had to turn the oven up to 325 after an hour and cook it for about 15 minutes longer. Put it in the freezer and it is amazing warmed up in the toaster using the frozen setting. Will be eating this as dessert until the next batch of bananas are ripe!!!

I'm new to using almond flour. I prepared this recipe exactly as written and was hoping to bring it to a function, but after tasting it, I didn't think it was good enough to share. I think it could have used more sweetness.

I had tons of  leftover almond flour from French marcaron making and wanted something breakfast-y. 

I used this recipe as a wonderful starting point and made my own changes. First, I made them using a large (6 to a pan) muffin tin, which cut the baking time time to 20-25 minutes. Don't overfill, since they are very rich. Makes about a dozen.

-I added 3 ounces of good quality mini-chocolate chips. Yum.
-I added 1/3 cup of flour. Yes, it's no longer gluten free, but I was concerned about the texture and this was just enough to bind them nicely and I don't need gluten or wheat free. 
-Used 1/2 extra virgin olive oil and half avocado oil. 
-I used 1/2 cup maple syrup and 2 T. dark brown sugar in place of the honey.

I just made this and its not too bad! Im seeing reviews that it was dry. I dont understand how, mine was very very moist.  I also read reviews stating that it wasnt sweet and needed more of a banana taste. I agree with that. I did add a little banana flavoring to it. I also added a little maple syrup.  I def will use 1 more banana next time and also more honey and or syrup. It could be a little sweeter.  Other than that its good! Ill probably put a scoop of halo top (seasonal blueberry crumble ) on top! One slice of this is really filling which is nice :)

Made to the recipe. It is spongy and gritty. I could get over that, bu I did not care for the flavors. Way too much cinnamon for me. Needs more banana and honey.

This is really good. Not too sweet. I added 1 c. Slivered almonds, 1/2 c. Currants, and Genepro Protein powder (5scoops). Definitely making again and could add mini chocolate chips or even PB2.

delicious! eating it now as we speak. i followed the recipe exactly and spread some vegan butter on one half and some natural peanut butter on the other. tastes delicious and it's the perfect pre-run meal! my bananas weren't over ripe, just normal ripe and i still think the bread is sweet. i did add more cinnamon and a tsp of stevia and left out the nutmeg and it still came out great. awesome for gluten and dairy free diets!

Added chocolate chips + pecans and made muffins. My 6 year old son devoured these. Saving them for healthy lunch-box treats!

Very good and fairly easy to make.  (Do people feel sifting is 
 essential?)  Also made it with butter instead of coconut oil but prefer the latter.  Added 3/4 cup walnuts.

I think the recipe must be wrong... Too much almond flour maybe.  Made some gross dry vaguely banana vaguely bread.  Not sure why it has a good rating.

Delicious.  I used 2 eggs and an egg white. Swapped the honey for 1/2 cup of dark brown sugar, a teaspoon and a half of baking powder, teaspoon of cinnamon and only a dash of nutmeg. I also used avocado oil in place of coconut oil (much lower in saturated fat).
I baked it at 350 for 45 minutes and then 20 minutes at 300. Came out fantastic.

This is disgusting. I had no idea that something could be so dry, bland, chewy, and flavorless all at the same time. It's a shame...I had high hopes  for this recipe!

Excellent recipe. Held together very well and was moist. I didn't have enough almond meal so I used a combination of almond meal, coconut flour and brown rice flour. I also added chia seeds.

I followed the recipe. I found it to be moist but too grainy for me. My husband said it wasn't sweet enough.

I made this following the recipe exactly and once I added the dry ingredients,  it's like the batter seized up and became crumbly and dry.  I baked it anyway and the end product can't be sliced.  Must eat with a spoon.  The taste is rather bland.  Won't save this recipe.

I added another banana to this recipe and it still doesn't make the grade. It is far too dry and lacks flavour. Adding more oil and honey would help but it wouldn't stop the overpowering almond flavour.

The bread has a very moist consistency. I substituted agave nectar for about 3/4 of the honey and added a little extra cinnamon and vanilla.  Ended up baking the bread for 1hr 45 minutes in a 300-degree oven before it was done.
