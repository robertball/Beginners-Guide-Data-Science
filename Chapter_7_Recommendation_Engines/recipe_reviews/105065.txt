This was very tasty!! I used fat free mayo instead of the buttermilk and baked in the oven and it turned out fine.  I will do this one again!!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!!

Really great, easy meal, but I did greatly increase the amount of cajun seasoning.  I used about two or three tablespoons.

Delicious and the batter stayed on wonderfullly! Would've given 5 stars except I increased the Cajun seasoning to 2 Tablespoons - using 1.5 t would not have been enough "Cajun" in my opinion. Will use this recipe go forward - thanks!

Unbelievable flavour & texture!  I used crushed up toasted bread (it was poppy-seed bread) and I used cajun & fajita spice for flavour.  A great way to add flavour and texture to snapper or any other white fish.

Made this twice now, and it turned out very tasty! Instead of cajun seasoning I used a mix of Montreal chicken spice and some other stuff I happened to find. The breading texture is wonderful! Here too I made a little change, used kefir instead of buttermilk, which is almost the same, just a bit thicker, because I happened to have in my fridge. I would make almost any white fish with this recipe.

Good stuff. Cooked exactly as presented here. Will need to increase the "Cajun" next time. (1T, I think) But there WILL be a next time! Thanks for sharing!!

Excellent.  5 stars for flavour, crunch, moistness and simplicity.  I cut the recipe in half for the two of us and increased the Cajun spice to 1 Tbsp. Still mild enough to taste the fish.  Next time I'll cut the amount of buttermilk and breadcrumbs each by another 1/2 cup to reduce waste.

This was so easy and fast to make! Super delicious and I will make it again.  Here's a tip: If you don't have buttermilk on hand, just add two Tbls. of lemon juice to one cup of milk!

Omit the salt (Cajun seasonings are enough), add some black and cayenne  pepper

Very easy to make. Needs a little more seasoning.
