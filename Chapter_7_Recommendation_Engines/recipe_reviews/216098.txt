These beans were good but I altered the recipe a bit.  I didn't have a spare smoked turkey laying around so I used chopped leftover ham instead.  Tasted great!  I also added Paula Deen's House Seasoning to the beans when I added the olive oil.  Wasn't sure how the olive oil would taste, but it turned out great.  I usually make my beans on the stove top and add vegetable oil.  I also cooked the beans on high the whole time which gave me more of a "pot liquor" which I love to sop up with my corn bread.  I will surely be making these again.  :)

Thank you SO much for a great base bean recipe!  The beans turned out perfect for me.  I added salt after 6 hours. (I cooked for 9 hours total.)  I also used a few slices of bacon rather than the turkey.  THIS is the perfect recipe for making beans to add to dishes, or just on it's own!

Made this yesterday. Turned pot very well -it's all gone. I made 1/2 recipe and used wings in place of the legs. The smoked turkey provides excellent flavor to the beans without all the salt and fat that you would get if ham was used for the seasoning

These are awesome!  Followed the recipe almost exactly.  I did cut it in half, used a ham hock, and had to add garlic salt AFTER the beans got soft because I had very little garlic powder.  I will be making these again.

good! I can't wait to make again! I followed recipe almost to the T. But, I used 7 cloves of fresh garlic plus garlic powder. I used 2 smoked hamhocks. No oil and no bay leaves. I also used almost 2Tb chicken bouillon near the end of cooking so I wouldn't over salt it. SOOOO good!!

I altered this recipe a bit; instead of the smoked turkey leg, I fried up a pound of bacon; added 1 jalopeno and some cilantro for the last hour of cooking; no bay leaves.

These are the BEST beans I've EVER EATEN!!!!!! I soaked 2lbs of dried beans overnight, rinsed them and added them to the slow cooker. I also added a large diced onion, a large diced bell pepper, 2 smoked turkey legs, 1 clove of garlic, pepper, a little less than half a tbsp of sea salt, and just under 8 cups of chicken broth. I set the slow cooker on Low for 8 hours. Came home, made a dozen gluten free cornbread muffins and had the BEST home cooked meal I've eaten in a long time!!! I already gave this recipe to my Mother and Grandmother to make too! This recipe is hands down the BEST ever and this will be my signature dish from now on! Thank you for this recipe!!!!!

I just made this recipe and it was amazing! It was so perfect for this rainy day. The only thing I did different was that I used a package of onion soup mix instead of the onion powder. Thanks for the awesome dish.

I have made this twice on the stovetop instrad of a slow cooker. Not haviing any turkey I have used smoked sausage and ground beef instead. The ground beef combo got "rave reviews" from my family. The only change I made was adding 2 beef bouillion cubes to the pot. Delicious with mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, & Jiffy brand cornbread!

The thing I liked about this recipe was the use of a smoked turkey leg. I must say the beans turned out very good. I followed the recipe to the letter, even added the olive oil. I did use a potato masher just a little to get a thicker texture. I removed the turkey meat from the leg and added it back to the pot before serving over rice. The amount of flavor from these simple ingredients was surprising to me. I will make this again.

My husband asked for a pot of beans and this recipe seemed to be closest to what he was asking for.  I have never cooked beans because I don't like the gas.  But I did some research on how to eliminate it and this recipe covered it.  The soaking for at least 8 hrs and rinsing well is important.  The other gas eliminating  property is the Bay Leaves.  My Bay leaves were very small, so I put 2.5 of them in (one was a broken leaf, lol). I have no idea where to get a Smoked Turkey Leg, but I had some Country Ham pieces I had bought for cooking with and used about a third of that package. I also added about 2T of Wyler's Chicken Granules at another reviewers suggestion. I was worried about adding it at the beginning because I had read salt will make the beans tough, but since I had to leave, I went on and added all my ingredients at the beginning except for the Olive Oil.  I only had 6 hrs to cook, so I started them on high for 1.5 hrs, then changed to low when I had to leave home.  The beans came out great, and not tough. If I had returned home earlier, I may have added the Olive Oil, but decided not too add at the last minute. They were done in time for me to take a meal to my 90 and 93 yr parents who were excited when I told them I would bring them beans for dinner. My 92 yr mother-in-law is getting some leftovers and she will love them too.  I served with cornbread. Best part is, NO GAS!!! So I will definitely make sure to not only soak well, but add the Bay Leaves.

I've been using smoked turkey drums instead of pork shanks with my beans for years now.  They always taste fantastic. I half the onions and add three leeks, 3 chopped carrots, and 3 stalks celery with tops. I use 4 cans 14.5 oz cans chicken broth instead of water.

My beans took a little longer because I didn't put enough water when I soaked them. When the beans were finally finished they were great. I used onion  salt instead of onion power. I added a dash of salt for a little more flavor. I will make this recipe again. Thank you.

I give it 4 stars because the recipe as written is very bland.  But it's a great starting off point for being creative.  The beans cook perfectly and will go well with whatever additions you choose to make.

I used a spiral ham bone in place of smoked turkey wings, crushed red pepper in place of black pepper, and after tasting the beans I added 1 teaspoon of Lawry's seasoned salt to the pot of beans.

I loved eating beans growing up. In fact, you can't miss me when it comes to beans. As an adult I've made 3 futile attempts at making a pot of beans. I was ready to quit. I decided to search online for a recipe and VOILA! I stumbled upon this recipe. All I can say is WOW!. They turned out just the way I like them. If I can do it anyone can. I feel like an expert now. Thank you so much!

Great recipe! I used some smoked, sliced beef brisket in place of the turkey leg and fresh garlic and a large onion instead of the powders. It is a family favorite.

This was tasty. I didn't have pinto beans so I used great northern beans and added a touch of poultry seasoning at the end of cooking time. I cooked it 5 hours on high and 3 hours on low.
