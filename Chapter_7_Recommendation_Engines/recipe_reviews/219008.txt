I thought this recipe looked familiar. This is Marcy Goldman's "Majestic and Moist New Yesr's Honey Cake" recipe out of her cookbook, A Treasury of Jewish Holiday Baking. The only variation is nutmeg instead of allspice, canola oil instead of vegetable oil, and the sliced or slivered almonds on top. None the less the very best Honey cake ever. I've been making it for years for holiday's and all year round and would never think of using a different recipe. Two notes, almonds are sprinkled on top prior to baking and you should let it cool in the pan for about 15 - 20 min and then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely before placing it on a serving platter.

This bread was a hit at my daughters birthday party! The only thing I omitted was the whiskey because no one in my family drinks:) But its was wonderful! Even my mother in law who complains about everything liked it.  I'll definitely be making it again for family occasions! Thanks

I made this cake on Rosh Hashanah. I put the batter into two loaf pans instead of the fluted tube pan. We all loved it. My husband took the second cake to work the next day and they loved it also. I have since made 2 more (one for my daughter's youth group and for her choir group).

I followed the recipe except for the cloves (I didn't have it on hand), so I used allspice. 

Thank you for this recipe. It's the best honey cake recipe I have tried. Very most and had a great flavor.

Dee-Lish!! Everyone loved this cake.  Very moist and fragrant.  Easy to make.  I made the following small adjustments:  3/4 cup honey, 1/2 cup molasses; omitted whiskey; reduced sugar to 3/4 C white sugar; 1/2 C brown sugar.
In my oven it was done in 50 minutes.
Thank you for this recipe!

Wonderful!  I made this cake exactly as directed.  It was easy and came out of the bundt pan beautifully.  I only wish there was a glaze that went with it - I wasn't sure what would go best so I didn't glaze it.  Everyone at work loved it and I got to tell them about what Rosh Hashanah is all about!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe - will be making again!

This is a lovely cake. I didn't have any orange juice at home so had to use pineapple instead and still taste great! As I'm in Australia i also substituted the all purpose flour baking powder/soda and salt for Self raising flour. I iced mine with a lemon glaze.  Really nice different flavour. Thank you

I've made this cake to bring with me to friendâ€™s house for Rosh-Hashanah celebration; almost exactly as per recipe substituting whiskey with golden rum (I didn't have a whiskey on hand). The cake was moist and absolutely delicious. Thank you!

Great cake, both in taste and texture (it's like a spice cake). I find, however, that only 1/4 C each of white and brown sugar is sufficient.

This cake is delicious! I followed the recipe exactly. It is so moist and flavorful and even better the next day. Will definitely make again. I don't think it needs icing but a nice dollop of whipped cream would be divine!

My daughter asked for honey cake for her birthday (she's only 4) and I thought I better try it out before we do one for the party. I think it was simple to put together and smelled good. This was the first recipe I found that actually had honey in it, which was key for me. I don't know if I did something wrong or not, but while baking it spilled out the top of my bundt pan and dumped into the bottom of my oven. It smelled terrible, but I was able to salvage most of it. Part of it also got stuck in my pan, so it didn't have the prettiest of presentations. The final result was very moist and had a "christmas" flavor to me. It was good, but I probably won't be making it for her birthday.

Wow!  Followed recipe exactly and the cake is amazingly moist.  It took an hour in my oven, but I did lower the temp a tiny bit since my oven generally quicks quickly.  Wouldn't change a thing.

This cake was perfect! I am not usually a fan of honey cakes because I find them dry and rather flavorless but this cake was so moist but still light and tasted incredible. I had my guests fighting over the last piece.

This honey cake is totally yum.  I especially like it because it is not light and spongy with lots of air like some other honey cakes I've tried; it is denser and more satisfying.  I used a high quality bourbon and strong coffee.  I baked it in a bundt and cooled for 20 minutes and the cake didn't come out easily.  Part of it stuck to the pan and I ended up with only 2/3 of the cake on the plate so I am going to serve it sliced.  Next time I will wait until the cake is completely cool (it will shrink away from the sides) and/or dust some flour in the pan to avoid sticking. Definitely let it cool longer than 20 minutes.

I made this cake for my children. I skipped the whiskey and orange juice but otherwise followed the recipe. I glazed the cake with a mixture of honey, brown sugar, butter, and vanilla essence. Next time I will poke holes in the cake first to let the glaze soak in for maximum moisture.

This was the best honey cake I have ever had by far.  I left our whiskey because we didn't have any in the house.  Can't imagine it would make it better, but I would try it.  I rejoined this website after forgetting my old account details in order to rave about this one.  Thanks!

Really great! Mine also had too much batter for the pan-I think it was because the electric mixer beats too much air into it. Anyway. I skimmed off the bumpy top and flipped it upside down to serve. I used Makers Mark whiskey because we had it. 1/4 cup is A LOT and I caution you frpm licking the spoon and the beaters. It packs a punch!! Quite delicious!

So MOIST! Followed the recipes exactly. I used a standard Bundt pan and the battered overflowed dramatically. Next time I will use a Bundt pan AND a small loaf pan.

I uused the star of David  pan that is pictured, but it is too small for the batter. It ran over! 
Other than the mess at the bottom of my oven, this cake is delicious!!

We loved this cake! I only wished I had noted the size of the bundt pan listed as mine cooked over and made a mess. Live and learn. I have requests to make it again, so will use the extra batter for cupcakes.

I made this for a Feast of Trumpets celebration and it turned out good.  I had no trouble getting it out of the pan like some because I greased and floured the pan and waited until completely cool.

This cake is awesome! It is super moist and depicts a traditional honey cake! I highly recommend making it! The batter made three big cakes !

It was very easy to make although the list of ingredients looks daunting. Totally moist, fragrant, and delicious. Guests raved. Use a loaf or bundt/tube pan for best release.

This cake was moist, had a nice flavor and my favorite art about it was it looked sticky. It even felt a little sticky, but it never stuck to the pound and the inside of the cake had a nice crumb and wasn't sticky at all. My husband loved it but I wish there was more spiced flavors. I will make it again and have passed the recipe on to others. L'Shana Tova!

I made this twice because the first time it would not release from my Nordic ware pan.  Extremely rare because nothing sticks to Nordic ware.  I made it again after throwing the first in the garbage.  The second time it would not release again!  I.m done with this recipe.  Don't waste your time and money like I did.

I cut back on the sugar. Used 1/2 a cup of each. Otherwise made as written. Came out perfect!

I made this reciep for my Synagogue. since I was feeding so many and they asked for small portions, I used a silicone mold in the shape of small blossoms. I cooked them for 25 minutes at 350 and they came out beautiful. I also used honey whiskey instead of regular. it was a hit.

the only change I made was double the spices.  I found the original cake to be too "light" in flavor.  Double the spices you won't regret it!

The one tsp ground clove was way too much. I will make it again ,reducing the clove to 1/4 tsp, as it was moist .

I've been using it for years.  I've made in a tube pan, bundt pan and 3  8"x4" loaf pans, which is my favorite method because then some can be frozen for later. I've made it many times  as written,  and also have reduced the white sugar to 1 cup to make it a little less sweet and both are good. It stays moist for days so I usually make it several days before Rosh Hashanah.

Moist and delicious, as promised!  It was gobbled up!
I did cut down the white sugar to 1 cup, and I used amaretto instead of whiskey. It added a yummy almond flavour that came trough nicely.  This one will be a favourite for the new year for years to come!

I made this honey cake tonight exactly like  the directions except for the whiskey  it was delicious.  I saved some batter and made 3 cupcakes so I could taste it before I served it to company. Honey cake is not my favorite but we serve this for the Jewish Holidays I am very pleased with this recipe.
