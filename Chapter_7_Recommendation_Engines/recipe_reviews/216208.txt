Was origanilly 4* but after making some changes the second time I made it, it definately turned into 5*'s+ > I sprayed the bottom + sides of 9 inch springform pan with cook spray.  Pressed the crust up the sides about an inch & 1/2 (alittle thinner on the sides than the bottom.)Definatley use butter in the crust. Couldn't find French vanilla pudding so I did add an xtra 1/2 t. of vanilla to the crust & I upped the brown sugar to 3 Tablespoons.  Took about 1/2 cup of chopped up Heath candy bar and gently pushed it into the top of the crust. > I added a Tablespoon of flour to the cream cheese mixture, needed to be alittle firmer.  Cooked for 45 minutes @ 350 then sprinkled another cup or so of crushed Heath candy bar on top of cheesecake, but not on the edge of the crust.  Turned oven off and left in oven for an additional 15 minutes.  Refrigerated in pan till cooled. (at least 5 hours or overnight)  Released sides and gently ran spatula under bottom crust to release cheesecake.  What a great chocolate Creme Brulee flavor & beautiful presentation.  Next time I will double up filling and make a little taller in a 10 inch springform and use for holiday dessert.  ENJOY!!!!

These are amazing!  They are the perfect mix between cheesecake and creme brulee and sooo easy to make!  I did not use the toffee bits because I could not find them, instead I sprinkled an even layer of sugar on top after it had cooled in the fridge and just before serving and used a blow torch as you would when making creme brulee.  I would recommend checking it after 25 minutes as the edges got pretty brown on mine.  Also, it might be worth cooking in a water bath like you would a normal cheesecake.  These were a huge hit and everyone was very impressed.

These creme brulee cheesecake bars are great. A few adjustments: I used twice the toffee bits to sprinkle on top. And even more importantly, I will use a traditional graham cracker crust the next time I make these. The current sugar cookie crust is much, much too rich, and it deflects from the light yumminess of the cheesecake filling.

These were awesome!! I actually had a bag of Heath toffee bits for the topping but I did use my rolling pin to crush them a little more. I also made it a little less fattening by using light sour cream and light cream cheese. Just a tip: Let them cool completely before covering them with foil or plastic wrap and refrigerating them. The heat causes condensation to form and if it runs off onto the bars it makes the topping look like a soggy mess!

Sinfully good and super easy.  Cooling on the counter as I type and I had to taste test! I put toffee pieces only on half as many reviews said they tend to get soggy. This looks to be a great dessert for our New Years Day dinner.  I love the cookie crust and did press it a bit up the sides.

No changes, other than using Krusteaz sugar cookie mix instead of Betty Crocker. These were excellent--my husband gave them 10 stars, although way too rich for my taste. This is an easy & delicious keeper recipe.

These were good but I thought the crust was to tough. The taste was great but I think next time I will try adding a whole egg to see if it improves the texture of the crust. Still have some left over in the fridge so that means hubby wasn't overly thrilled with the recipe. I used Heath bars chopped in my food processor, worked great.

These were one of the best cheesecake bars I've ever had. The cookie crust was a nice touch and the sour cream made the filling very creamy. Definately making these again!

I get recipes from this site weekly and have never before felt a need to comment, but in this instance I want to.  I was really excited about making these, but was so disappointed in the result. I bake all the time, so while it could have been user error, I don't really think it was.  I agree with a previous reviewer, the flavor is very much one of "imitation", even the cheesecake layer.  My family didn't eat more than one bite, and felt like it might be the worst dessert I've ever served. :(

Two important things I learned about this recipe:  1) greasing the pan isn't enough to make it come out easily.  Line it with parchment paper.  2) When you refrigerate it, use a food storage container - don't just keep it in the pan and cover it with foil.  That causes condensation to form and the top comes out soggy.

These are very good. I debated whether or not to use the cookie crust and I'm glad I did. I think it's a very nice compliment to the cheesecake filling. Keep in mind that these are cheesecake bars, so the creme brulee taste is mixed with cheesecake. Simply delicious. If you crush some toffee bits until they are almost a powery consistency, when you add it to the hot pan the toffee will "melt" into the cheesecake layer and it will produce something very similiar to a torched creme brulee topping.

Not sure what Brulee is but, these were pretty good. I thought I had toffee but I confused it with my butterscotch morsels. I used those and it still came out pretty good. Thanks

Kind of disappointed in these. Creme brulee being one of my all-time favorite desserts, I guess my expectations were a little high. They were tastey, but here's what took away two stars for me: the crust, as others have mentioned, was chewy-tough and did not release easily from my pan; and these didn't taste like creme brulee to me, just like vanilla cheesecake bars with toffee on top. Not that I have any problem with vanilla cheesecake, but I was expecting creme brulee, darnit! I would like this better with maybe a graham cracker crust, or just make the BK sugar cookie the way the package directs and press THAT in the bottom of the pan. Although, I doubt I'll be making this one again.

Very good! i made this 2 times, once with the toffee and one time with out.  Simple and delicious! crust was a little thick, so the next time i used a larger pan.  It is a little hard to cut, it really needs to set out for atleast 30 minutes before slicing.  The second time i set it on the stove to loosen up the crust.  I will make this again and again!!

Very yummy recipe...just changed a couple of things after reading the other reviews.  I used white sugar instead of brown sugar. I also added 1/2 stick of butter in the cream cheese mixture. Turned out perfect wouldn't change a thing!

All I can say is OMG these are GOOD!!!! My fiance was coming home from a month long trip and I wanted to bake him something nice to come home to. He loves creme brulee and loves cheesecake so I typed these two foods and this is what I came up with. He was SO excited. I have also made it for his family [what a way to suck up to the in laws ;)] and some friends I have had over for dinner. Everyone loves it. I currently have half a pan of it in the fridge. 2/3 cup toffee bits is usually about 2/3s of the bag so I usually add all of the bag. It's so freaking good! Did I mention that yet? Soooooooo good.

These are pretty good. I think if I make these again, I'll use a different crust. The crust is pretty "chewy" and a little tough. Also, the toffee bits become a little watery after refrigeration. (I used HEATH toffee bits.) These set up fairly firm, but I'd prefer them a little more firm. (Easily fixed.) Overall, my family really loves them, but I'm the one who would like to make the above changes.

These were amazing! Everyone had a second...the crust is so tasty! Well the whole bar is....just delicious.  Did not change a thing.  No reason to. They are a little messy to cut....but worth it. I made these the night before and obviously stored in the fridge overnight.  Cut into bars the next day. The toffee chips on top got a little "melty/swept" on top....but no one cared. Loved this rich dessert!  Thanks!

We all really loved these, and different from others, we really liked the crust.  The only thing we didn't like was the fact, as another mentioned, that the toffee bits became watery and a little soft the second day.  They were great the first day.

These were a big hit and really are award winning. I brought these to a cookie exchange for 25 people. As a surprise the host asked her friend, pastry chef, and cookie shop owner to come and judge all of the cookies. These won top prize. She said they were sinfully delicious, and looked and tasted like something you would expect to see on a cooking show. She said she has a new idea for her shop.
They were very easy to make and took no time at all. As for the complaints of the sticking... I had no problem. I used Baker's Joy on the entire pan then put down parchment paper, and sprayed that. After removing from the oven, I let the entire pan cool completely. Then I put the entire pan in the fridge uncovered over night. The top did not get mushy at all. In the morning I turned the pan over onto a cookie sheet, removed the paper, then flipped it over onto the back of another cookie sheet, and cut it into bars. Worked perfect and the bars cut beautifully. I will make these again and again.

I have made this recipe last year and  agree with another reviewer that greasing the pan is not enough.  Rather than try parchment paper, I opted to bake them in a mini tart/muffin pan which yielded great results. Lined tart pan with mini liners & pressed in 1tsp. of dough then topped with filing.  Baked at 350 for 16-17 minutes. Sprinked with crushed toffee bits.  Great single bite servings.

This dessert was a hit, but mostly because it was  sweet and decadent.  The crust was too heavy and tough.  The overall flavors leaned toward the candy bar side and not the creme brulee side, even with the toffee crushed very finely.  I make recipes as written the first time, so will try adjustments mentioned by others next time, especially the graham cracker crust.  I might go with less toffee and hand torch caramelizing sprinkled sugar at the end.

My family loved these bars, I could not find toffee bits or candy so I used finely crushed caramel candies.

I've had to make these bars over and over!  People just love them!  What I cannot seem to do is figure out a nice,neat way to cut them.  
Has anyone had any lluck with that?
Oh and I leave the brown sugar out of the crust.  It's sweet enough without it.

These are insanely delicious!!  I brought these in to work, I work in the kitchen of a hospital.  Everyone loved them, my team leader went to the store to get the ingredients so I could make more for the next day.  Word got around pretty darn quick about these cheesecake bars, soon the kitchen was a popular place.
