Bitter melon is different but good to stabilize blood sugar.  I added ginger, didn't have tomato and used "patis" instead of using shrimp.  Boiled bitter melon first to remove some of the bitterness; used vegetable broth to simmer and marry flavors.  Also added black bean garlic sauce.  My husband liked it.
