I have had this recipe for years.  I make a few changes to this though. I boil the sugar, evaporated milk and butter together for 10 minutes at a slow boil. I then add the marshmallow fluff, until nice and melted. I then pour this over the chocolates. I do not like the bitter sweet taste of semi-sweet so I use milk chocolate chips. Excellent fudge recipe. Every year my dad insists that i make it.

My daughter and I made this recipe together and found it to be very easy to make. Altough we did have to put it in the fridge to make cutting easier but that is no big deal. I can't imagine wanting it to taste any sweeter or have more of a chocolate flavor. We think it tastes great.

super easy recipe.  this is my first time making fudge and it turned out well.  i would recomend melting the butter and marshmallow fluff with the sugar and evaporated milk to make melting the choc. chips easier.  also, i had to refrigerate it in order to make cutting easier.

This was the first time I have made fudge.  It turned out so well.  It set well, and was absolutely delicious.  It tasted just like what you'd buy at a candy store.  I put the butter in (and used a half a stick)  with the sugar and evaporated milk.  Other than that, I made no changes.  Absolutely wonderful!

This is the first fudge i have made that set up correctly.   My only real complaint is that is is much more like milk chocolate fudge than tthe traditional dark fudge I am used to,  It is a really tasty recipe,

No good. Try "real" fudge. Old-Fashioned Chocolate Fudge on this site is worth the work.

The fudge turned out way too gooey and way too sweet. I think the problem was that this recipe uses too much marshmallow, but I am not about to attempt it again. It was pretty much inedible. I ended up throwing out the entire batch.  A waste of time and money!

Perfect fudge-just the way I like it. I too hate the taste of fudge made only with semi-sweet chips. I am making another batch to mail to my brother who is at sea on the USS Bainbridge

Turned out very good.  It seemed to take the sugar/milk forever to boil.  I would make this again.

Very good.  I may have to switch to this recipe from now on.  I made a double batch for the holidays and it was gobbled up.  A great chocolate flavor and easy as well.

Easy to make and tastes good, but not as rich and chocolate as I hoped.    I could not cut it into nice neat squares.
The pieces tended to crumble and look messy.
