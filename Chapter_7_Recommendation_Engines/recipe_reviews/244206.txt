This was a really nice change to the traditional potato salad. My husband said it was the best potato salad he has ever had. If you are using a brand of pickle you have never had before I recommend tasting them first. I couldn't find the brand mentioned in the recipe and bought a different one that ended up being a spicy bread and butter flavor and I dislike bread and butter. This recipe is mostly about the pickle so make sure you like the pickle that is going in. Can't wait to try this again with a different pickle!
