Excellent. What I like about this sauce is exactly the thing a couple of people tweaked out - it's not sweet. Unsolicited, my 20yo said, "This sauce is incredibly good and spicy." Well said, I think. Thanks for the recipe! :) UPDATE: I don't make a lot of recipes more than once because I'm an adventurer, but I have visited this recipe a few times since I first made it. I made it again tonight for fish katsu and was out of garlic powder so I used fresh - still excellent. I've also used this sauce on steamed shrimp - makes an awesome cocktail sauce. Thanks again!

My mother is from Tokushima, and the recipe she used when I was growing up was very similar to this one.  Oftentimes, we just mixed ketchup and worchestershire sauce without adding anything else.  Also goes great on things like croquette or okonomiyaki.

It tastes like barbeque sauce...nothing special or exotic at all. Sorry, but this wasn't impressive.

I didn't follow the recipe exactly. I eyeballed other ingredients which I believe is essential to Tonkatsu sauce. Measuring to taste: I added a few teaspoons of shoyu (soy sauce), 1-2 teaspoon of sugar, and about 1-2 tablespoons of applesauce. I cut down on the ketchup, about 1/2 cup and added more Worcestershire, about 1/4 cup or less. Over all, the sauce came to 1 cup for me. But the applesauce is important. Why? Because a lot of bottled tonkatsu sauces have fruit in it, like apple, dates, etc. Now, for a hint of spice, I add a light sprinkle of cinnamon. I used yours as a basis, but being that I eyeballed the rest, I can't really post up my own version. :) Remember, really good tonkatsu has some apple in it!

I made this tonight to go with fried calamari steaks and it was very good; I added about 1/4 cup chicken broth to make it less bold.  I also used just 1/2 tsp of the spices and it was perfect for our taste...  The hubby really liked it and I'm anxious to try it on other things like chicken.  Thanks for the great recipe! :)

I made the sauce based on this recipe but added a little bit of sugar.  It turned out very good tonkatsu sauce. My husband and son liked it with pork tonkatsu which I prepared using the receipe I found from this website.

I made half the recipe, and it was the perfect amount for us. I used slightly less pepper and used half garlic, half onion powders. The longer you let this sit the better it is. When I tried it right after mixing, the ketchup and pepper taste was overwhelming. After sitting in the fridge for a few hours the flavours mellowed out a bit and were more balanced. Yum!

This was pretty good! Makes quite a bit of sauce, so for the three of us I halved the recipe.

Very good.
For convenience, if you have a Japanese market by your house buy the ready made brand by Bulldog. Excellent.

this is my go to sauce for Katsu. it's as close to what we get in Hawaii when making Chicken Katsu. you MUST let is sit. you CANNOT just serve it. i mean i guess you can but it won't taste right.

I just paired this with tonkatsu for dinner and it was ok. The only thing that I don't like is that the pepper taste is too strong Probably I'll tone it down to 3/4 tsp next time just like what I did to the garlic powder. Adding 3/4 tsp onion powder makes it good. And also not to mention, I also added a little bit of sugar as what other reviewers mentioned. Thank you Soifua =)

I really wanted to like this recipe. I just didn't. It didn't taste anything like katsu sauce. Totally dominated by the flavor of the ketchup. Texture was also really weird. Oh well, I'll just go back to buying Bulldog brand sauce.

It goes really well with Chicken Katsu.  I use fresh garlic instead of powder (or both), and add some soy sauce, but leave it alone other than that.

I have been looking at this recipe for quite some time now and kept putting off making it because I was unsure if I would really like the flavors.  I wish I hadn't waited this long, because this is a killer sauce.  It is a tad spicy for our tastes, but nothing that even my little guy couldn't handle.  I definitely think the longer it sits the better, so I can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow.  This went perfect with Chicken Katsu and fried rice. A definite keeper in my house!

I've never had tonkatsu sauce before.  So I don't know if it's the recipe, or just our tastes....but it was disgusting.  Oddly spicy and just tasted like spicy ketchup.  Nobody ate it.  Blech!

Hated this. Raymond said it was unedible...Bitter!
Made exact to recipe. Upon further research for  TONKATSU Sauce on the web, I have found some other recipes. They are completely different from this recipe and if I had done my search prior to serving this recipe, I would have definately done the other ones. This sounded 'off' but I trusted the other reviewers that said it was good. To each their own though. This just isn't for us. TONKATSU PORK CHOPS though were PERFECT. Good thing I served this sauce 'on the side'.
(PS gave it 1 star only because you have to give one in order to rate recipe)

I added 1/2 Cup of sugar and 1t of pepper,  I cooked until it was hot and the sugar mixed in.  I think next time next time I will use even less pepper, it was HOT and I'm a wimp.  But it was still yummy.

I liked this sauce and it reminds me of cocktail sauce.  Not too spicy for me but I like things pretty spicy.

AWESOME!!! I loved it with our chicken katsu! I did add a little sugar to mine, just a tad but overall, this is a repeat dip for our katsu! In fact, I just made it about 30 minutes ago for tonights dinner. Thanks!!!!

Very Good, I added a couple pinches of sugar, and halved the recipe. I also used prepared mustard instead of dry, and added some onion powder.

We love this sauce!  I added a little brown sugar to appease my husband, but we both agreed it didn't need it in the end.  He wants me to try it as a beef or pork marinade also.

It's not quite like the stuff you buy from the store, but it'll do.  I added a little sugar to sweeten it up a little.  Nice to find the recipe since I had made Japanese croquettes only to find I had only a little of the store bought tonkatsu sauce left.

i only used half the amount of ketchup needed because for one I was low on ketchup. maybe this is why it didn't quite turn out right. it was more of a BBQ sauce to me. a really good one but not necessarily what i was looking for. could have been all the Worcestershire sauce.

This sauce tasted primarily of Worcestershire sauce.  Perhaps if you add the Worcestershire in increments, tasting as you go, you will find the right blend, but we thought it was just OK as written.

I was looking for a sauce which would go with some panku chicken I'm making tomorrow, but I will add a chopped chilli in this sauce to spice it up a little. It sounds a nice recipe so will update after!

Delish! If you are searching for the perfect sauce to serve with tonkatsu / katsu, this is it!!! This was absolutely perfect and required no modifications on my part - just be sure to prepare this in advance so that all of the wonderful flavors have a chance to blend. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Soifua! My hubs and I loved it. :-)

I followed this exactly, and wouldn't change a thing!  I served it with tonkatsu, and it really made the dish!  It is tangy and flavorful!  I was remiss in telling my boyfriend that the sauce was meant to dip the pork in, so he used it on the pork, the potatoes AND the corn, and loved it on all!  I will be making this often...the possibilities are endless as to what it will be good with!

Close alternative to the local Hawaiian restaurant's tonkatsu sauce. I might of accidently over did it on the Worchestershires sauce cause it was a bit zesty. Next time, I'm going to 1/2 the recipe since I had lots of sauce left over. Had it with the chicken katsu on this site.

VERY yummy! I halved the recipe, but that was my only change. The flavors in this were great and went very well with the Tonkatsu I made to go with it. I can totally see using this as a dip for fries or onion rings too, and I intend to use it for that also! Thanks for sharing. :)

This sauce is good, maybe a little to garlicy, but if you like garlic then you're good. I probably will be making again with a lot less garlic.

We really liked this!  I made it with the chicken katsu from this site and it was great.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out nicely-no need to change but if you wanted to make it a bit sweeter, this sauce will take to it well.  I had some left over the nextday when we had a BBQ & ran out of A1 sauce, guess what!!??  It tastes great with steak too.  This one's a keeper, thanks for sharing!

perfect as written. I used mustard seed and crushed in my mortar to add more texture.

Having never had chicken Katsu myself, i made this for my boyfriend who loves it.  I made this sauce and also purchased a packaged sauce from the store for comparison.  This recipe won, hands down!! the store bought sauce just tasted like ketchup and Worcestershire sauce and was runny.  This one is spicy, and intense and flavorful!  It does pack some kick so if you don't like the heat, maybe lessen the black pepper and mustard, but I wouldn't change a thing!  I did use fresh garlic (about 3 cloves) instead of the powder, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.  It does get hotter over time as well.  I plan to bake some meatballs with this sauce for a spicy asian take on bbq meatballs...thanks for the recipe!!

Liked this more than the sauce for "Ashley's Chicken Katsu with Tonkatsu Sauce." Also, I mixed this recipe (after tasting) with "Wasabi Mayonnaise Sauce" for a non-traditional creamy sauce. I thought the two worked well together.

I tried making this sauce hoping it would match what they give you in the teriyaki restaurants. Unfortunately, this is nothing like that. The sauce was very good, but waayy too spicy. I mixed it following the recipe and it must have been too much mustard powder. I evened up the spice a little bit by adding more ketchup, just a little bit more worcestershire sauce, and some lemon juice. My boyfriend loved it. He liked this better than the restaurant sauce. Thanks,  this is a keeper!

Great sauce made it to go along with the Chicken Katsu recipe I tried from this site a couple of weeks ago.  Now I can’t wait to make tonkatsu to use with it as well.  Thanks for sharing the recipe with us.

I like this.  It is a bit different from the one my local hawaian grill makes, and I will keep tweaking until I get it closer.  Theirs is a tad less "ketchupy" and looks darker.  A different base maybe?  Anyway - this is a good version and we will use it happily.

I couldn't find Katsu sauce at the store so I decided to make this recipe, it is really good!
