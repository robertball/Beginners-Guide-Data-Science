This is a great tofu recipe... especially if you are looking for something to make to change a tofu skeptic. I added more veggies - steamed cauliflower with the broccoli, sauteed mushrooms with the onions, and added a diced roasted red pepper. I also added asiago cheese to the tofu mixture as well as sprinkling it on top.

Since I don't really do pie crust (never comes out right and I don't like storebought) I did a crust with wholewheat couscous. It was easy and tasty(plus it has a lot less fat than pie crust). Mix cooked couscous (make sure it's pretty dry) with salt, parsley or other herbs, and a couple egg whites. Pat it into place like a graham-cracker crumb crust into an oiled or cooking-sprayed pie plate. Bake it for ten minutes at 350 before adding the quiche ingredients.

Thanks for a fun, flexible recipe. Can't wait to try other "filling" combinations.

This was easy and healthy, since I used a "crust" of frozen uncooked hash browns that I'd pre-baked for about 8 minutes. It went together smoothlyand without much fuss; even my skeptical fiance enjoyed it. The mustard and onions really work in this, and I added a little shredded cheddar on top for extra oomph.

Very Yummy-my husband had no idea it was tofu.  I used a bag of mixed vegetables and no crust of any kind and it turned out great.

My broccoli wasn't the freshest and I used silken tofu instead of firm, and the quiche still turned out very good.  The texture wasn't quite like a typical quiche (perhaps because I used the silken tofu), but overall it was successful and I would definitely make it again.

I made this recipe without the cheese for a lunch that had a vegan population, and they really loved it (not to mention, appreciated the effort!). I didn't try it myself, but I made three and there wasn't a bit left. Those who ate it said that the texture was just like a real quiche, and the broccoli was really yummy. I used a homemade shortening-based pie crust. I'm glad to have this recipe in case it's needed for occassions such as this again. Doubt I'd make it for myself because I looooove quiche lorraine so much! I was worried when I made this that the filling was way too thick and almost added some more liquid, but I'm glad I didn't. I forgot that this wasn't going to "set" like an egg-based quiche. Thanks for this recipe!

Aside from leaving out the pie crust all together, I made this recipe almost exactly and it was delicious!  I sprayed a muffin tin with a little Pam and poured the mixture right into the cups.  They scoop right out when they're done (about 25 to 30 mins) and because there's no pie crust to add any extra calories or fat, you can eat a few guilt free!

Fabulous!! we have egg allergies and so have never done a quiche, but I was in the mood for something different and we try to go meatless a couple of times a week. Everyone ate it...the kids were less enthusiastic than the parents, but they ate it!!   Like others, I did a potato crust, simply thinly slicing a russet and overlapping on the bottom and sides of the pie plate. Baked for @ 15 min. and then filled and baked. Delicious!!

Absolutely delicious and so easy to make.  One thing I will change next time (and that's because of personal taste) is to put red pepper to taste as opposed to 1/2 a teaspoon.  I actually only used a 1/4 teaspoon and it was still to spicy for me.  My co-worker whom I brought a piece to loved it too but she found that it could have used more red pepper.  Go figure!  Definitely think this should be "red pepper to taste" like the recipe calls for black pepper.  Will definitely make this one again and serve it to my friends to see if they can tell it's made from tofu!  Thanks for a great recipe.

wow, great recipe - even I couldn't screw it up! (I never seem to have all the ingredients when I cook, so I end up experimentally substituting things). I only had a 13oz bag of frozen broccoli, so threw in some frozen mixed bell pepper strips (tho I chopped them into smaller pieces). I don't have a food processor so I mashed the tofu up in a bowl. The only "spices" I had were ground black pepper and garlic powder. I had some left over salsa, so I threw that in in lieu of the ground red pepper. I saw some grape tomatoes in the fridge, and chopped up a small handful of those as well. And I only had about a quarter cup of chopped red onion. (I kinda steamed the broccoli and peppers together with the onion and garlic powder to thaw them out a little before adding them) After mixing it all together, it seemed sort of crumbly and I was worried it wouldn't "gel", so I added two eggs (I think that is what binds it together?). I also added a small amount of whole wheat flour (it was called for in another quiche recipe, so I thought I'd try it). And then that still didn't look right to me, so I added a small amount of soy milk. After I put it in a pie crust I found some parmesan cheese mix that had come in a bag of frozen ravioli, so I sprinkled that on top. Miraculously it actually tasted really good! I wish I had measured everything so I could make it again!

This quiche was surprisingly good (I was a bit nervous, using all that tofu). I only had 12 oz of tofu, and 14 oz of broccoli, but it really was enough. I added a handful of shredded cheddar in the mix, and topped the quiche with more cheese. My husband liked it a lot, but said it wouldn't have been so good without the melted, crispy cheese on top. I will do it again.

I was amazed.  So was my friend after he finished eating and I told him it was all tofu.  I chickened out at the last minute and added one egg though---this was my first ever cooking experience with tofu.  The fun is serving it and after they've eaten telling them it's tofu!

Made this quiche tonight in a deep dish pie plate.  Made very minor changes to suit my taste - omitted the red pepper and used 1/4 tsp each dried oregano and sage.   Added 1/4 tsp more salt (sea).  Readers said theirs was not firm, so I added 2 tsp flour - it set up perfectly - the pie was firm and sliced well (cooled 20 mins before cutting).  I used the oil pie crust recipe from the original Tassajara Bread Book - Yum! (prick crust and pre-bake 7-8 mins).  Will definitely make again.  Oh - I turned the oven temp down a little (400 for pre-baking the crust, 375 for baking the filled quiche and baked 40 mins).  DEEP DISH PIE CRUST:  1 1/2 cups unbleached flour, 3/4 tsp sea salt, 1/3 cup light olive oil, 1/3 cup cold water.  Add oil gradually to flour/salt; gradually stir in water to form a ball and roll crust.

I loved this recipe...I have already emailed it to family and friends. My husband had no idea it was tofu. I took another person's advice and made a couscous crust. It was delicious! Thanks for such a great recipe.

Love it, love it, love it.  I made it without the crust and made it vegan by replacing  the parmesan with nutritional yeast.  I am looking forward to the variations I can try...I do not miss the eggs or the dairy.

This was good! I made my own crust (1/4 olive oil, 1/4 cold water, 1 cup flour, and some salt) and omitted the cheese and nutmeg, as I don't eat cheese and don't care for the latter. Next time I will add more of all the spices. I also just mashed it up with a fork because I couldn't find my blender. It looked pretty egg-y so maybe that would solve the texture problem for some. Good for vegans- especially with some nutritional yeast flakes!

This was decent. My toddler liked it, but he likes broccoli a lot. I laughed quietly to myself as my FIL who "hates" tofu went back for seconds. The only changes I made were using hemp milk instead of soy, and throwing more cheese on top (Should have used cheddar, the parm wasn't that interesting a contrast for me.)

Wonderful taste! I'm a supreme novice when it comes to cooking with tofu and I'm glad I found this recipe. I didn't give it five stars because it doesn't "set" like regular quiche does so I couldn't make it in muffin tins for quick, individual servings for the mornings when I'm running late or being lazy.

Without seeing this recipe I would have never had made tofu quiche! I read all the reviews and decided to do it on a couscous crust, seeing how I've started eating healthier. I ended up making it half with couscous and half bulgar wheat as I didn't have enough couscous. The filling reading the ingredients I thought for my taste that it would be bland for me, so knowing that me and my family love spicy food I ended up adding green chillies into it (6 in total but that was quite a kick) I kept tasting my food making sure it was flavourful while preparing it. And doing so it was! I used 131grams of mature cheese and American mustard and English mustard, 1 garlic clove half an onion, 1 pound of frozen broccoli, half a red pepper and 4 mushrooms. Plenty of salt and pepper to taste. It was really nice my mum and brother loved it! They didn't realise it was tofu haha! People should know what they like and don't like, whether they like spicy food or not, and should adjust the recipe to YOUR TASTE! That's why there a few negative response as you followed the exact recipe, when we don't all like the same things!  People need to learn to ADJUST ANY RECIPE TO YOUR TASTE. My meal ended up making 2 dishes 1 rectangle shape which we ate from and the other circle dish which is my picture, we all had 1 slice with salad and was very filling I have ended up with a total of 10 portions with each portion as 235calories that also includes the oil I used which was a healthy alternative to veg oil.

Made this with 1% milk and no pie crust and sprinkled Parmesan during last 5 minutes of baking. So delicious and healthy. Great way for vegetarian to eat clean and get protein.

This was a pretty good recipe. I made it completely vegan, so I used nutritional yeast instead of parmesan cheese. AndiI didn't have any broccoli so I substituted chopped spinach, mushrooms and roasted red peppers. It came out good, but I think the tofu mixture was missing something. Maybe next time I'll add some garlic powder and see if that doesn't do the trick. Will definitely make it again though.

Made this tonight for Father's Day and my husband just told me it was the best quiche he ever had! I left out the nutmeg and used a vegetable mix of broccoli, green beans, red peppers, and mushrooms instead of just broccoli. Thanks for an easy to make, great tasting recipe!

My toddler loved this recipe.  I didn't have nutmeg, so I would like to try it with this added.  Also, the mixture seemed a bit thick in the blender, so I added  an egg and a little milk.  I think you could also add some more red pepper if you like some spice.

Very fast, easy to make. A nice weekday recipe; simple, but tasty. I made it crustless in mini pie plates and baking time was only 20 minutes. I also added some fresh dill which gave it a lovely fresh flavour.

My family loved it. They didn't know they were eating Tofu. I did make a change and used frozen hash browns for the crust. It came out great. Thanks

I am giving this recipe a 4 because my husband and I have different opinions on this recipe.

It was easy to make and worked fine. My husband loved it! I make a spinach/mushroom quiche found on this site, which both of us love. It is made with egg whites and both of us enjoy it. My husband liked this quiche even better, so I will be making it for him regularly. I like the fact that soy is healthier than eggs. 

I however, did not like the flavor. I like tofu, but I did not like the consistency nor the way the tofu tasted in this recipe. 

For those who like tofu or are looking for a quiche without eggs, it is worth trying.

This was an alright quiche, although with the first bite I was already full of ideas for 'next time'.  Cheddar (or feta) cheese, mushrooms, and other quiche-like toppings would be a must.  By the way I used regular milk & omitted the Parmesan, but I'm sure it didn't make much difference.  All in all this was a great starter recipe - we definitely couldn't taste the tofu in it - and although I found it to be slightly bland and crumbly, I'll definitely think of ways to tweak it & make it a yummy way to eat more protein.  Thanks for the opportunity!

Awesome recipe! My dh, who "hates" tofu even liked this.  My seven y.o. liked it too, but said it was a tad spicy...it was perfect for me.  I did make a few substitutions though: I used frozen broccoli because that is what I had on hand, I added a container of presliced mushrooms (I chopped them up so my son wouldn’t complain), I used 3 tablespoons fresh parsley and I used skim milk instead of soy.  I also upped a few ingredients: I used ¼ cup parmesan and 1 tablespoon Dijon, and I added ½ cup fat free cheddar cheese.  I did put in nutmeg, but I used fresh ground.  I don’t really like the pre-ground nutmeg.  The fresh stuff is very light and is almost lemony in flavor.  I think it makes a world of difference.  Thanks for the recipe!

We are new to vegan eating so I was a little sceptical about the blended tofu! This was GREAT! I didn't have parmesan on hand so I substituted nutritional yeast for the cheesy flavor. I also served it to my 1 YO so I left out the red pepper. My husband added it to his after baking and said it was great as well. Definitely a keeper ??

This tastes amazing!  I mostly followed the directions, except, instead of a whole pound of broccoli, I added half a pound, and chopped up some green peppers and mushrooms as well. I used real Parmesan cheese, because I am not a fan of the soy cheese. I didn't steam the broccoli (it seemed like and extra un-needed step.), instead, I saute'd it with the onions, garlic, green peppers, and mushrooms. After baking, I cooled it then put it into the fridge overnight to let the flavors meld together. 
This is my second time making this quiche. One of the great things is it freezes well. I travel for work, so I freeze the individual slices and take them with me to save on money eating out.

Very nice!  We modified the heck out of it, but that's what one does with quiche recipes, right?  Anyways we are delighted to be eating quiche again since we have gone vegan.  I used very firm tofu and drained it by putting it between cutting boards and paper towels and stick a pot on top.  I will not use a blender again, you can moosh it with a fork.  We skipped the nutmeg.   I used one shallot instead of an onion and I did not saute it.  I threw in some vegan bacon all chopped up and some chopped olives.  I used the tiniest bit of vegan parmesian cause that is all I had, and we hate vegan cheese anyways.  I put some nutritional yeast on top though.  We used no crust at all, just  baked it in a loaf pan.  It looked like a crustless quiche and tasted awesome.  The kids devoured it and I am required to make this again.  I will add more vegan parm next time and some roasted red peppers.

Absolutely delicious!  Make it vegan by omitting Parmesan cheese.  Bakers should know the mixed ingredients, before baking, are sticky and thick, but you won't need to add liquid. It bakes into a perfect quiche that tastes like the real thing.  Thanks for this recipe!

When I made this I combined two recipes: Tofu Quiche with Broccoli and Eggless Spinach Quiche with Tofu. So I used 1/2 lb. of broccoli and 10 oz. of spinach. It tastes great! We loved it:)

I like tofu and did not expect this to have the consistency of a real quiche, but it was still lacking.  A bit dry and needed a boost of flavor.  Even with subbing the 2tbsp of parmesan with 1/4 cup colby jack cheese, my family thought it needed more cheese and probably double the spices.  We drizzled ours with balsamic vinegar which helped a lot.  I will try again with some tweaks.  Very healthy!  O, and I made it with a potato crust (1 1/2 cups grated potato; 1/4 cup wheat flour; 1 egg white; salt, pepper, and garlic to taste; mix and press into pie pan; bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes).

Really, really good.  I made a rice crust , used 12 oz of extra-firm tofu, a pinch of nutmeg and red pepper flakes, fresh parsley and sprinkled some cheddar on top before baking in a glass pan at 350 for 35 min. I cook w/tofu fairly often so it's familiar to my family but they were surprised that this was a tofu quiche, they thought it contained eggs.

Really yummy, especially for broccoli lovers like me.  We used the hash brown potato crust and it tasted delicious and cut some calories as well! I was a little short on tofu but it didn't matter.

Fabu!  This stuff was just great.  We didn't have parsley or dijon mustard (just the "normal" kind) and we added in some mushrooms and a few egg whites to make it a bit more "stable".  We also had no pie crust, so we used hashbrowns (no grated, which we'd do next time!)  In the future (and there will be a future!) we'll add tomato, and possibly a bit more cheese (including a bit of cheddar)

This was so good! WOW! I made it with frozen chopped spinach instead of broccoli and it was wonderful. I had to add a little more soy milk then called for because I couldn't get it all mixed in my blender. I didn't add the red pepper, just the nutmeg, salt, and black pepper. Couldn't even tell there was tofu in it. Really yummy.

This quiche was delicious.  My husband and I took some advice of other reviewers and added sauteed bell peppers along with the onion and garlic.  We also added a about 2 tablespoons of jack cheese.  This was our first experience with a tofu quiche and we will definitely cook it again.  Thanks!

I made it with 12 Oz broccoli florets and 8 Oz sliced mushrooms, and used nutritional yeast instead of cheese, and it turned out wonderfully! It actually made two 9-in pies and baked for a little less time. Has anyone premade this the night before? Did you pre-bake the crust the night before or save all the baking for the next day? I’m worried it would be soggy if I put it in the crust, but maybe if I leave it separate it would be ok?

I was looking for new ideas using tofu and this recipe was a big hit. My husband had two servings and said "this is a keeper" The only thing I would do different the next time is let the quiche set 10 minutes before cutting. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly except, instead of 1/2 cup soy milk, I used 1/2 cup water because I did not have soy milk. It tasted amazing!! Next time I’m going to play with other veggies to see how it turns out.

NOTE:  I am Indian Vegetarian and we are use to a LOT of flavor in our meals. This said,  this recipe is probably quite bland as written. 
However, The spirit of this recipe is really good. I made a BUNCH of changes to accommodate my taste though. 

First of all I reduced this recipe for 4 people. 
1. Sautéed chopped mushrooms,  .chopped bell peppers,  chopped red onions;  chopped jalapeños chilies; ground garlic in a pan

2  In  Food Processor I put an entire container of firm tofu , approximately 1/3 c milk, some broccoli heads, 2 stems of cilantro (just because we 
Ike it) ,  3 types of cheese I had on hand (Parmesan, spicy jack, sharp cheddar) , salt, pepper, sriracha mayonnaise, green jalapeño sauce (just because I was looking for more flavor). 
Mixed it all together and added it to the mushroom mixture. 

3. I OMITTED the nutmeg, parsley ,  mustard, and red pepper (because I added fresh chopped chilies)

Put it in an 8x6 glass pan (with NO crust) and baked for 35 minutes. 
Came out great. Only thing I will change for next time is that I will press out excess water from firm tofu. 
However, even if you make this on the run and don’t have extra time to squeeze out the tofu water, this comes out really great and full of flavor.  
NOTE:  there is probably not a whole lot of flavor as recipe is written

It turned out good, but it didn't solidify like a non vegan quiche or pumpkin pie.  This is much healthier than a regular quiche, & the other 2 adults loved it, so it's a win-win!  I used green onions & a lot of garlic powder with parsley instead, since it's what I had.

I thought this was very tasty. I don't usually make quiches with crust, so that's how I made this one.  The quiche didn't stay together  quite as well as I might have hoped, but I attribute that to the lack of crust. The only change I made was to add some extra cheese (swiss) as just an 1/8 cup didn't seem sufficient. Next time I would add a little crushed chili pepper to "wake up" the taste buds, and some bacon (for all you non-veggie/vegans out there).

I skipped the pie crust, and just cooked it in a Le Creuset to give it crispy edges.  It turned out really well.

I thought this was going to turn out great, it smelled wonderful as it baked.  However, the taste left a lot to be desired.  The flavor was very dull and the consistency wasn't great.  I thought I would let it cool down and maybe I would like it better.  I didn't.  My husband thought the consistency was alright, but we both couldn't eat it, it just did not taste good.  I feel bad giving a bad rating, because maybe other people will like it, but we didn't.  We eat a variety of foods (including vegetarian) and are not picky.  It is rare for us to find something we dislike.

This didn't turn out as well as I had hoped.  It didn't really set so it didn't hold together very well.  I might be partly to blame for this because I didn't really blend the tofu mixture - just stirred it all together with a fork.  But if I were to try it again I think I'd add an egg just in case.

I used the basic recipe, but with real milk, some cheddar cheese, and HAM! It's not like quiche, but like a nice casserole.  Satisfies the quiche craving, but without all the grease of eggs.

I was really excited to try this recipe based on the other readers' reviews, but it was so awful tasting that my boyfriend & I both couldn't eat it.  I threw the whole thing out - what a waste.  
I don't know if it's just that we're not used to the taste of soy milk, as the only time I drink it is in the odd latte, but it was the only thing I could taste in the dish.  Maybe the milk was bad?  In any case, I won't be making it again!

Excellent! Consistency was great too. I added a little more dijon mustard. I've had trouble with egg quiches separating, but not this one. Wonderful recipe, thank you!

Thanks to the person that suggested a hash brown crust. Great idea, Thanks! When I tasted the tofu mixture in the blender, it seemed a little bland so I added extra salt, mustard and spices. This is a keeper.

YUMMY! Made this for a brunch and it was a big hit - even with the non-vegetarians.

This was very easy and delicious. I would make this again. I made this with a whole wheat crust and everyone enjoyed it.
