The idea has potential and the flavors are nice, but the method of preperation doesn't allow that to come through. I will make this again, however, with the following changes to prep:
Saute pancetta until crisp and all fat has been rendered. Remove from pan and set aside. Stir garlic into pancetta drippings and cook until translucent and fragrent. Remove from heat, add dijon and lemon juice. Drizzle in olive oil while stirring to form an emulsion. Dress the blanched asparagus and store in refrigerator. Immediatly prior to serving, toss in the crisp pancetta pieces. Some toasted pine nuts prior to serving would also be a nice addition. Also salt and pepper to taste.

this was a good choice for our valentines dinner side dish. only change i made was serving the asparagus warm and using 1 T of whole dijon mustard. the lemon juice and garlic add a nice flavor to the asparagus.
