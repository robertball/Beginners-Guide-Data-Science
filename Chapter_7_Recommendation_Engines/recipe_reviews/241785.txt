I would like to add some notes:  you can  grind some flax seed with the chia for added omega 3's etc.  Also, you can use coconut flour instead of wheat flour, just cut the amount to about a tsp. for the coconut flour.

I really enjoyed these pancakes. I was tempted to leave out the flour but made as written. I think I will sub the flour for a little protein powder next time or just skip it altogether. Instead I just sprinkled some protein powder on the top (along with some cocoa) to give the illusion of sprinkled sugar. I'm not into sugar these days and these pancakes were perfectly sweetened with just the banana.

Easy, healthy and suuuper tasty!! I made a bunch of little pancakes that were a great addition to our brunch - easy to eat and snack on for our 2-year old, and definitely a staple for us in the future.
I substituted the flour with ground oats. 
Yum!!!

So in all fairness I tweaked this a bit and combined another recipe from here. Instead of flour I ground up 1/2 cup of whole oats and 2 tablespoons of chia seeds. Added the cinnamon, vanilla, salt and banana. I also used cooking spray instead of coconut oil. Once finished, I smeared on some homemade almond butter and maple syrup. Pancakes came out very good and much healthier than the traditional boxed store brand! Just need a healthier substitute for the maple syrup.

these are very good!  the pancakes stayed together nicely unlike 90% of Paleo pancake recipes.  I used black cocoa powder with made the pancakes very dark, but gives it a deep rich cocoa flavor :). yum!!!

I subbed the flour for a scoop of protein powder and it came out great! The hubby is going to love it.

Moist, yummy pancakes!  I substituted the wheat flour with Domata gluten-free flour and it tasted great, with just a hint of sweetness.
