Once again we enjoyed a delicious supper based on using up fresh produce I needed to clear out of the fridge the night before I head out of town!  Hubs agrees some of the best things I’ve come up with are a result of AR’s recipe search feature, typing in ingredients I need to use up.   I didn’t measure anything, just cooked away, using olive oil rather than vegetable oil, large rather than small shrimp, and no cornstarch.  Also, in consideration of Hubs’ sensitive innards, I skipped the optional red pepper flakes.   The fact I had homemade tomato sauce in the freezer made this particularly fresh tasting.  This, along with a tossed green salad, made for a delicious as well as pretty meal.

I really enjoyed it. I disagree with people saying that oil for this food is too much. It might be because of my cultural background (More fat is better). I think using olive oil would solve that problem. It's healthier but still tasty. One thing. I think this recipe is more in small portion size. I tried to make for 4 but it was enough for 3. However, if you tend to have small portion, the recipe might be good. Two tips: 1) I replaced shrimp with chicken but I think it might be better to marinate and fry chicken before a little bit  and 2) if you don't have cornstarch you can use normal flower to make it thick.

I've made and enjoyed t his several times, and noticed that I hadn't rated/reviewed it yet. I always make it exactly as written, using sunflower oil, sea salt, some "Penzeys Freshly Ground Pepper" and white onion. At first I tried larger shrimp, but then I thought that the 51-60 count shrimp worked better, so stuck with those. It is very tasty, a nice medley of ingredients. I will say that as written it's not very spicy (I like it hot!) and there's perhaps too much oil used. But all in all, I enjoyed this a lot, usually for three big dinners. I recommend it!

Tried this tonight and loved it!  We don't eat seafood, so I substituted smoked sausage which I sauteed in the pan from the peppers and onions and added 8 minutes before the sauce was done.  I think chicken would be great too or maybe andouille sausage.

The only changes I'll make less time are less oil in the sauce (and maybe olive oil instead of vegetable) and a little more cornstarch to make it a little thicker.  But the flavor was great and my toddlers even ate it!

This recipe is one of my family's favs. I just cut down the amount of oil. Other than that it is excellent. Even my picky eaters like it

We LOVED it!!  I've made it twice now and it has came out perfect both times.  My family requests it and DH takes leftovers (if any) to work the next day.  I'm thinking next time I may serve it over steamed white rice like a spicy shrimp creole!  Big thanks to Maurice for posting this!  Served with garlic cheese bread and a crisp salad.  YUMMY!

This is great. I used a package of langostinos from Trader Joe's instead of shrimp and it was delicious!

I made this tonight, and it was quite good. But I thought it had too much oil. I'll definitely cut back next time.
I also substituted chicken with cajun seasoning since I had no shrimp, and orange and yellow bell peppers since that was all I had.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. I used olive oil instead of vegetable but otherwise made it as is. It's SO delicious!

This turned out really well. I doubled (or more) the garlic, onions, black pepper, and chili flakes because I knew it would be kinda bland otherwise. In addition to the spring onion I also sprinkled chopped cilantro.

It turned out pretty well.  In the future, I'd use tomato paste for a thicker sauce.  For the red pepper flakes, I used prepackaged flakes from a pizza restaurant, one package for the sauce and one for the shrimp.

We cut the garlic in half, eliminated the salt and green onions and topped each serving with Parmesean Cheese. This dish was amazing, especially if you like spicey meals. We will absolutely make it again.
