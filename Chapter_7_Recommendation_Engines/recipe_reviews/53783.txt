Fragrant while cooking and tasty while eating.  I doubled all of the spices because our family found it too mild.  Adding a little chicken or vegetable broth is helpful as it tends to dry out while cooking.

I thought this was pretty good, easy to make and a nice low fat recipe.  I wasn't sure what garam masala was, but got the impression it's like curry so I used that.  (It worked anyway.)  Only thing was that I didn't think it was very filling.  I'd like to try making more of the sauce and putting the extra over rice.

I added more garam masala only because I love the flavor of a stronger curry. 
Does Wajiha have more recipes available ? =-)

I cooked this in a 4 Quart slow cooker on low for 6-7 hrs. Did not need extra fluid. Used only two raw boneless chicken breasts cut up. Added 1/2c whole canned chickpeas, 1/4 c golden raisins, and doubled the spices. But, still needed a bit more kick, so next time I will add more spices with heat (e.g., HOT chili powder).  We served over Couscous.

I read over the reviews and took everyone's adjustments into consideration. I did, however, make some additional adjustments, so I am rating the basic recipe as best I can since I "tweaked" it so much. I think it's a good basic recipe to start with, but it would not have been as pleasing left as is. I doubled the spices and the vinegar. I also used canned tomatoes mainly to get more juice. I have added chicken broth or vegetable broth, depending on what I had on hand, and both work well since this dish needs more moisture (especially if you are putting it over rice). I used green, red and yellow (or, sometimes, orange) peppers to the recipe because the red peppers are very sweet and the other colors are not just pretty, each adds a slightly different flavor. I added chickpeas to mine because if you look at the photo attached to this recipe, it clearly shows chickpeas in the picture and the recipe did not call for chickpeas. I was very confused about the photo containing chickpeas and it did make me wonder if this photo was the author's finished dish? Or, perhaps, she forgot to add the chickpeas to the recipe? Anyway, I added them and we enjoyed the dish once I had made considerable adjustments.

Very good recipe - and very quick and easy. Doubled the amount of spices, but that's just personal taste. Is even better as leftovers as flavours have a chance to infuse overnight. Thanks for the recipe!

This was delicious! I'm glad I sought out the garam masala (had to go to a specialty store for that one!) because it added so much flavor! I substituted leftover turkey for the cooked chicken and had to use a yellow bell pepper instead of red, and it all turned out great. I think next time I make it, I'll add some golden raisins and some nuts, maybe almond slivers or cashews. This would also be delicious with that Indian paneer cheese mixed in. Served it over jasmine rice and it was a hit. I'll be making this again!

Really quite good once I adjusted the seasoning to our tastes. I used white and dark meat combined from a pre-roasted chicken. I allowed the chicken mixture to come to room temp and then served stuffed inside a wheat pita with lettuce, cucumber and cilantro to garnish.Served with a lebanese salad for a nice light dinner.

Well, I have to say I expected a lot more flavor from a Pakistani dish.  This was surprisingly bland.  I think I'll stick to chicken karahi.  Or add jalepenos, as another reviewer suggested.

I had to make some adjustments to the recipe since I didn't have tomato paste, fresh tomatoes, and not enough chicken. I added 1/2 canned tomatoes and can of tomatoes/green chilies. I used garbanzo beans to fill in for the chicken, I used green, yellow and red peppers to give it more color. I salted and peppered until I was happy and added a pinch or so of all the other spices until it hit the spice level I enjoy. Over all I know I might have butchered the recipe but it wasn't bad considering all the adjustments I had to make. Hopefully I got the essence of Jalfarezi.

Great recipe BUT I'm glad I read the reviews.  I doubled the amount of spices and added a few dashes of hot sauce.  The next day, I put the leftovers in a small slow cooker with a can of Rotel tomatoes with jalepenos and another tbsp of Garam Marsala on low for about 3 hours. It was soooooo much better then the first day! In the future, I think I will always put it in the little slow cooker for 2-3 hours before serving. It really blends the flavors.  I will definitely make it again.

This was delicious and extremely quick/easy. I followed the advice of others and doubled all the spices. I also didn't have tomato paste or fresh tomatoes on hand so I used half a can of diced tomatoes and some of the juice. Can't wait for leftovers tomorrow!

I made this as per the recipe: reviewers are quite right - it needs more moisture.  I added a 1/2 c. chicken stock as well as 1/4 tsp salt.  I also ended up adding raisins and almonds which helped the taste and texture.
Tomorrow, when I heat up the leftovers, I'll add a healthy dose of curry powder to pick up the flavor a bit. I served this with Basmati rice.

An okay dish to build off, but as a popular Pakistani dish and someone who loves Indian food I was expecting some different in flavor. Not spice and no robust flavors...

Yum!  Very tasty.  I doubled the spices, which made it flavorful but not hot.  Next time I'll probably add some cayenne pepper to give it some heat.  I ended up stirring in a few tablespoons of water as I cooked, to keep it from drying out.  This recipe was easy to make and a great way to use up leftover chicken!

Loved the basics but did alter. I added coconut milk because it lacked sauce. Added sweet chilli sauce because I wanted a kick and sweetness without refined sugar and the some curry powder along with the other curry spices. Very very good. Used brown rice for extra nutrition and texture.

Very tasty and easy to make.  Definitely use a large onion, chop the tomato and  red pepper into small pieces.

after tweaking this a good amount i really enjoyed the flavor.. doubled all the spices.. didn't have garam masala so i added a bit of curry.. doubled the vinegar too (as suggested by someone else) but didn't see a need for it in the dish.. only had green bell pepper.. doubled the tomato paste.. and added 1 cup of chicken broth.. had a little leftover cooked spinach so threw that in as well.. maybe the garam masala would have made a big difference idk.. thanks for the base of a good recipe anyway

Good tasting, but definitely not the mouth orgasm that I expected. I crockpotted mine with raw chicken, there was enough liquid from the chicken and tomatoes. Recommend doubling the spices and adding hot chili powder, as many others recommend. Overall easy to throw together.

This turned out well but, made as written, it was very very dry. I ended up adding a can of diced tomatoes and some chicken broth. I wish I'd used peas instead of bell pepper - better flavor. Thanks, Wajiha!

This was super easy! My Pakistani boyfriend was so impressed, and wants me to make it every night. I've made it 3 times in the past week. The only thing that I changed was adding a little chicken broth and a bit of cayenne pepper for some spice. Other than that, perfect!
