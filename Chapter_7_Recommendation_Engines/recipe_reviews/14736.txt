This was really wonderful! I made some modifications. I cooked this in my slow cooker. I cubed a bunch of potatoes and placed those in the bottom, layered sliced onions on top of that. I browned the sausage (I used the regular sausages cut up, not the skinny links). Placed the sausage on tops of the onions and my sauce mixture over the top. I added a little more BBQ sauce and used 1/4 C. brown sugar. I added a little Worchestershire sauce and prepared mustard as well. Hubby said the meal was PERFECT! Also I used fresh herbs for everything. Will deffinitely make this again, will be especially good come Fall and Winter.

My bf and I both really enjoyed this recipe. It was full of spice & flavor.  It's not very messy or difficult to make if you plan it out ahead of time.  I started by chopping the potatoes and putting them to boil.  Then I chopped the onions, garlic, & the sausage while I was boiling the cubed red potatoes.  I also pre-mixed the spices so that it would be ready to go.  Once you start sauteeing the garlic and onions it all goes pretty quick so you need to be prepared.  The directions were a little ambiguous, but I think just on the cooking & cutting of the potatoes.  I took another reviewer's suggestion of putting the cheese on for the last 10 minutes & it was perfect.  The final product is a little soupy, but who said a casserole had to be dry & stay all stacked up nicely.  I am thinking of next time adding some zuchinni or squash & maybe some french fried onions to add some different flavors and textures.

A waste of time for me. Too wet (hardly a casserole) much too sweet, between the sugar and the BBQ sauce; ambiguous instructions:  are the potatoes cooked or not(if so, how long?) Are they sliced or cubed?  Badly written-

This is the ultimate comfort food!  Takes a bit of work, since you have to cook the onion mixture and brown the sausages, but it's well worth it!

A big hit every time I serve it!  I found it better to just partially cook the potatoes so they don't turn to mush and to sprinkle the cheese over the beans 10 minutes before done.

I will not make this again, sorry.  After cooking for 45 minutes in the oven, the beans were mushy, the potatoes were mushy and the cheese was a bit crusty. What made it worse was the work and mess involved.  From now on I will do it my old way- mix beans, bbq sauce and sliced sausage links in a dish, pop in the oven for 20 minutes along with a pan of cornbread and enjoy.

Awesome and EASY ~~  use canned or leftover baked potatoes.  Adjsut the flavorings to your liking. I added almost no sugar because we don't anything real sweet. 

The biggest time saver is that we slice, cook and freeze the sausage when we buy it so it is ready to go. 

This was perfect in the oven and in the crockpot if you don't have cooked potatoes.

We enjoyed this recipe very much though it is written somewhat ambiguously at points. I sliced little red potatos and boiled them for about 10 minutes and I cooked the hot links into the onion mixture. All in all it was nice for some fun food.

Based on reviewers comments about the potatoes, I parboiled sliced potatoes (about 1" thick) before layering them in the casserole dish.  I used leftover grilled hotdogs (thought the smokey flavor would be nice), and added diced red bell pepper and Tony Chachere's seasoning to the onion mixture.  Added the cheddar cheese with 10 minutes left.  Big hit with the kids on a rainy day!  Next time, I will add the worcheshire to add some additional kick.

I used hot links and cut the sugar just a little and used home fried potatoes it was like the best beanies and weenies you'l ever eat. It was great for the super bowl party. Would also be good for a summer barbecue instead of baked beans

This is AWESOME!!  I used Smoked sausage & Ketchup instead of BBQ sauce.  All it needs is cornbread to go with it!  YUMMY... the whole family loved it, even the in-laws.

we used spicy link/sausages, next time I will use regular.     I modified the recipe, only because I love using my crock pot.   I sliced the sausages up in 1/4 slices,  grabbed a bag of frozen diced purple onion and placed those 2 items in the crock pot placed on high for 3hrs.  I then sprinkled oregano etc on top.   I then used 2 large cans of Baked beans,  added garlic powder, salt, pepper, worcestershire sauce, mustard and stirred together.  place on top of sausage in the crock pot and cooked on low for an hour.  I opened the lid to thicken the mixture.  I baked O'brien potato's in the oven and sprinkled cheese on top the last 10 min.   and it was delish and we will definitely have this again.    thank you so much for sharing!

This was a yummy dinner for when it is cold outside. I used a Texan style spicy sausage and cubed the potatoes rather than slicing them, as the recipe specified both ways.

as is, the recipe is very good, but far to sweet for me. thats why i rated a four. but i tried it again and did what others suggested (half brwn sugar and half oregano) and it tasted even better. it was really simple to make. i loved all the diff. flavors. add your cheese at the end, or its prob ganna burn. after that, rate it a 5.

What a wonderful recipe!  I made this for a Mother's Day meal for my family, and it was a hit!  I took the advice of another reviwer and used smoked cajun sausage and beans that are not sugar-based (and I drained the beans).  I used 1/2 t of oregano rather than the full teaspoon.  It was perfect for our tastes!

This was great! I thought it sounded kind of gross and didn't look pretty but it was delicious! I used a can of precooked potatoes, bratwurst and I had to use a combo of monterey jack and mozzarella and it was really yummy. The only thing that I would change is a little less brown sugar, because the baked beans I had were brown sugar based and it was a little too sweet for my husband. I will definitely make this again. Such a comfort food! And i have leftovers for lunch.

I personally wasn't too fond of this recipe, even though my husband thought it was pretty good.  If I did make it again, I would cut back on the oregano and maybe use a smoked sausage.

As written 4 stars. Read all directions before starting. First for the potatoes I did baked potatoes smothered in butter in the microwave before starting chopping everything. Sautéed the garlic (5 cloves not 2) onion and spices in butter (what I had). Started layering the sliced baked potatoes, garlic and onion mix, used bbq brats I cooked in the crock pot sliced, had bbq pork chops shredded I added on that, for the beans well I had no baked beans. I drained a can of pork and beans and garbonzo beans, added the bbq sauce from the brats, the brown sugar, and some Worcester sauce. Mixed and put that on top. Baked 33 minutes, topped with cheese then an additional 12. This was not soupy at all nor would I change a thing. Boyfriend ate half of this at once and couldn’t stop raving about it. Definitely a repeat. I would not recommend boiling the potatoes or using canned. I think that’s the cause of the mushy potatoes. Mine held their shape fine even as leftovers.

Nope! Pass on this recipe. As other reviewers have said, the directions are unclear in regards to the potatoes. I did not precook mine, and they were still hard after 45 minutes. The dish was way too soupy and sweet; not at all what I was expecting. I really wanted to like this, but sadly it was just a waste of time and ingredients.

I followed MAZZO's suggestions and made it in the crock pot.  Did it on high for about 4 hours and it turned out great!  It saves having to precook anything.  I only used 1/4 cup brown sugar but I think you could still use less than that.  And we didn't serve it with cheese.  Everyone really liked it!

Ingredients call for cubed potatoes with no mention of cooking them before adding to dish prior to baking the casserole.  The recipe calls for sliced cooked potatoes.  If you don't precook them, they will be rock hard after 45 minutes of cooking time.  I'm not even sure why they were in the recipe.  As others said, this is no way a casserole.  It is way too soupy to qualify for that.  That being said, the flavor was excellent and it would make a great slow cooker dish for pot lucks or BBQ partys.  The spices in the hot links mix well with the bean mixture and produce a spicy dish that we both loved.

Easy to make, didn't care for dish but not a huge fan of beans, found they over powered the rest of the flavor.

Loved this! So easy! I used a bag of frozen potatoes o'brien, so it already has onions. Just make sure you thaw them out before using in the recipe. Also, I recommend holding off on the cheese topping until the last 5 or 10 minues.

I liked the recipe however I too made a few changes.  1st I used sausage link and cut them and while I lightly browned them I put cubed yellow potatoes in boiling water and took them out when they were aldente so a little hard.  I used plain pork and beans NOT baked beans and used the same amount of bbq sauce and brown sugar.  I really liked it and I would say if you have a family that likes cheese put it on the last 10 minutes otherwise it is something that you could sprinkle on individually.

This seriously might be my all time favorite. I added green and red bell pepper to mine and topped it with mozzarella  and cheddar.

this was great inspiration for another one of bf's lunches.. i fried up a small spicy kielbasa that i cut up (about 7 oz).. removed and set aside..  then sauteed a chopped up onion in a little bacon fat.. added the garlic and then the oregano.. i left out the parsley and the salt..  added the pepper then sausage back in along with one can of pork and beans with the liquid, 2 cups of cooked rice, 2 potatoes and 2 small carrots that i chopped up and steamed.. left out the brown sugar and doubled the bbq sauce.. at this point it was so good it didn't need the cheese or to be put in the oven.. there were very few dishes to do since i did everything in my dutch oven which is always a plus.. ty so much for the recipe.. it was the perfect starting point

I diced my potatoes (5 of 'em) unpeeled & didn't cook them ahead of time. I added a can of corn after the spuds, used 16oz pkg turkey kielbasa; sliced & omitted the brown sugar. I used Bush's Grillin' Beans Southern BBQ flavor & 8oz extra sharp Vermont cheddar on top all in a 13X9" pan. It's cooking for 1 hour....we'll see..... :)
It came out of the oven on the "juicy" side. Good flavor; great for chilly nights. After removing a serving, I tilted the pan & spooned out the extra juice & it was much better

This sounded so good I had to try it one cold evening.  Talk about a hit with the entire family!  It's an absolutely delicious comfort food with a delightful blend of flavors.
