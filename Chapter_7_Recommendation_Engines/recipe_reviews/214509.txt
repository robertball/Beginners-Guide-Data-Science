Saw the comment about this being too dry and flavorless so I added a good bit more cider vinegar. I also used a mayo alternate at double the recipe, used way more of the habanero hot sauce, cayenne, turmeric, and creole seasoning...all to taste with a good amount of salt and pepper. Oh, also 3 small mangos to balance the spice. Very, very good. I'll add this to my recipe box for sure. So, moral is, taste the dressing as you go and add to it if you think it needs more oomph. Enjoy!

This slaw turned out  to be a perfect side for our Caribbean Night dinner.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated and wouldn't change anything.  I didn't find it dry.  It was great the next day, too.  Thanks for a fresh recipe!

I never liked slaw until I had this, never even wanted to try it.  Anything with mangoes will do it for me though, so I gave it a shot and I loved it, as well as my family.    I changed it up a little bit as I went, I didn't have cilantro or apple cider vinegar, and I used dijon mustard instead of regular mustard.  It turned out great and I ate the leftovers first thing the next day.  Thanks All Recipes

I loved this, despite the fact that this tiny little town didn't have any mangos and agave nector; so, am giving it 4 stars. Think maybe a fresh jalepeno would go well too.   Will make again and again.  Thank you, and will keep an eye out for the agave and mangos.  updated: found some mangoes and now give this 5 stars

My family did not like this at all. Dry and no flavor other than the cilantro.

This was a touch labor intensive, that's just a personal opinion though as I don't like chopping vegetables on end ;)  I really enjoyed the way the flavors melded, the agave and habanero were especially delicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Made this last night to go with Jerk chicken and coconut black bean rice, and everybody loved it including my picky DH! I added an extra TBSP of cider vinegar and used honey instead because I had no agave syrup, and everyone raved- the perfect pairing with any spicy entree! Great recipe- thank you!

I adjusted a few things because I didn't have all of the ingredients. I substituted about a teaspoon ground red pepper for the hot sauce (we don't like spicey), 1/3 olive oil based mayo for the mayo and yogurt and bagged cole slaw for the cabbage and carrots. My family loved it! Thanks for a great base recipe! I was in a pinch. It was fast, easy and tasted great!

We just came back from Jamaica and I was craving the Caribbean flavors we had while there. I made this with just a couple do tweaks. I used just a bit more mayonnaise, substituted sugar for the agave nectar(I'm allergic), and used raisins instead of the other items.

Made this today with extras I had from my bountiful basket.  I used half of the cabbage to start and used red, yellow, and orange bell peppers that I needed to use up.  I also only had white onion and dried cilantro, not the fresh stuff and honey instead of the agave.  I loved it!  I ended up adding more cabbage at the end because there was quite a lot of dressing still.  Not sure why people say it's dry unless they had a large cabbage?  Anyway, 5 stars!  Great recipe!

I made this Caribbean Slaw for a Caribbean-themed dinner party.  The guests loved it.  Everyone was particularly raving about the dressing.  I was probably a little heavy on the habanero hot sauce, but it gave it a little more kick.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again.

This was amazing!!  I did add some celery seed, a little extra hot sauce, and more mayo.  The sweet, cool mango offsets the heat of the hot sauce.  It was a side to jerk chicken & Caribbean crab cakes and was PEFRCT!

Just make sure the cabbage is FINELY shredded- was even better the next day after sitting in sauce longer. I used it on top of salmon burgers and loved it as well as by itself.

I love this recipe, it was very colourful, and I found it had lots of flavour.  The key to great flavour is using good fresh produce.  The only change I made was using both purple and green cabbage for the colour, as well I didn't have any agave on hand so upon doing my research for an alternate, I used a simple sugar method, (2parts sugar 1 part water) this worked great!! I served it with pulled chicken on a bun with ranch dressing!!! Very easy, very Yummy, will be using this one again, and again Thanks!!!
