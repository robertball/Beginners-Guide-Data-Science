This was a great hit at my last cocktail party.  However, Cosco's has the tomato, garlic and herb already combined in a jar.  I did put the appetizer back in the oven for a few minutes just to let the mozzarella melt.

This was delicious!  In the interest of saving time, I did short-cut a few things.  I used a can of petite diced tomatoes instead of the 4 fresh tomatoes.  I also didn't heat them in the olive oil with the basil and garlic.  Instead, let them marinate overnight with the olive oil (only 1 tablespoon), basil, garlic, and I added a splash of balsamic vinegar and some minced kalamata olives.  Spread the feta/cream cheese mixture on the bread, then put it in the oven on the broiler setting for about 2 minutes. Add the tomato mixture with a sprinkle of mozzarella on top, then put back under the broiler for another 2-4 minutes (depending on how crisp you want the bread).  This melted the cheeses perfectly!  It was honestly like having an authentic mini italian pizza.  We're thinking of trying pepperoni with it next time.

The recipe is great but I used a loaf of Italian bread instead and sliced it length wise and put the cheese on then baked it in the oven until the cheese was melted.

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The herb feta cheese made the recipe.  Also, I used Roma tomatoes which added more flavor

This is such a lovely appetizer! I MUST agree with Brenda MacLean (great last name, by the way. Ours is pronounced the same but we underline our "c") I've mentioned before that one of the clubs had an outrageous bottled brushetta (but I got bumped) and I'm sure we're talking about the same brand. It's not worth making your own when you can buy this. I also placed the toasts back in the oven to melt the mozarella. Thanks so much Carrie!

This is a great recipe.  It took a little while for me to make this, but it was totally worth the effort.  I somehow did not have bread, so I used thinly sliced bagels.  That's a perfect size, although not particularly dignified.

I just made this recipe after consuming about a half bottle of wine!  Needless to say, I needed something simple but delicious.  I changed the recipe a bit to fit my tastes, but combining the cream cheese and feta was phenomenal! It made for a creamy and zesty spread.  I sauteed 3 cloves of garlic and chopped 4 tablespoons of fresh basil, 1 chopped roma tomato and spread that on top.  That is all it needed--cheese, tomato, fresh basil, and fresh garlic.  I reduced the recipe for 1 (just me and my wine) and so only made 4 pieces of bruschetta. I also sliced an italian loaf of bread and broiled it on both sides.  I drizzled a lil olive oil over the toasted bread for extra savory flavor.  AMAZING!  I would not recommend shortcutting to save time.  This took me only 10 minutes and the fresh ingredients were well worth the prep.  Now....back to the rest of that wine :)

Excellent and easy.  I used Italian bread sliced 1 inch thick and added about 4 oz chopped mushrooms.  Definitely a 'Do Again' with me and my family.

This appetizer is delicious! I made it the way that it's listed, except that I used french bread instead of sourdough. Still delicious. I was asked to bring it again to the next family party!

The cream cheese in this bruschetta made it a nice twist on the "normal" version. I used blue cheese instead of feta.

super easy, super tasty.  Tzatziki is a great substitute for cream cheese.  It has Mediteranean flavours all on its own.    I kept the feta for topping, to cut down on fat, and keep this to one cheese instead of three.   I added finely chopped onion and  cremini mushroom to the tomato mixture and found it yummy on day old baguette that I sliced lengthwise and put in a regular toaster.   Would be great on grilled ciabatta too I'm sure.   Thanks Carrie for a very flexible and flavourful recipe

I only gave this 4 stars because I had to change it so much for a much better, easier, fresher version.  No NEED to cook anything but the baguettes!  To the cheese mixture, add one clove pressed garlic and spread on toasted baguettes.  Mix together chopped tomatoes and basil (add salt and pepper to taste) and top each baguette. Sprinkle with shredded parmesan (not mozzarella) and enjoy!

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!  The combination of the cream cheese and feta (I used a garlic/tomato flavored) and the fresh tomatoes really make this flavorful.  I did not used to mozzarella cheese and didn't miss it.  I ate three pieces myself!  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Put the cream cheese/feta misture through the food processor with a little sun dried tomato olive oil and it was much easier to spread onto the toast.  This was a huge hit at a recent party, and will certainly make again!!

I found here in Ca, that tomatoes are kind of iffy during the winter.... so I substituted grape tomatoes instead. They're smaller and keep their flavor pretty well. Plus they look good ;-)  Adding balsamic vinegar as other reviewers have recommended is yummy !

I've made this twice and both times had no leftovers!  The first time I couldn't find the herbed feta, so I added garlic powder, basil and oregano to the plain kind.  I think it turned out better than the second time when I used the store bought stuff.  Either way though, great stuff!

I just realized - I forgot the mozeralla on top - but it was one of the best things I had ever made from here.  I made it with regular feta - but it was the top of the chart even still!!!!

I have made this recipe two times now. The first time I made it exactly the way it was submitted. I loved it and so did most of my girl frieds but our husbands didn't care for it much.The second time I added a paper thin slice of prosciutto under the cheese and diced kalamata olives and a few capers to the tomato mixture...It was DELICIOUS and EVERYONE loved it.

Okay, I have to admit... I've made a few changes to my recipe :  I now use the sundried tomato/basil feta instead of the herb feta, I occasionally add sundried tomatoes into the mix as well (the kind marinated in oil), mushrooms work well and I now use grape tomatoes if the 'vine ripened' cherry tomatoes aren't in season.  The quality of the tomatoes really makes a difference.  And you can make extra topping and use for up to a week if you refrigerate ;-) In fact, I mix the cream cheese and feta and use that with my twice baked potatoes (and mix in other cheeses as well)

My family loved this recipe.  It is the best bruschetta I have ever made.  The only thing I add is a little Balsamic Vinegar.  Thanks Carrie!

We really loved this one!  I used ciabbata bread which was light and toasted just right.  We skipped the mozzarella - it just wasn't necessary.  Also, to avoid chopping and so on at the last minute, I made the mixture ahead of time but used dried basil.  Then heated through just before serving.  Worked perfectly!

The yummy-sounding cream cheese spread was what drew me to this bruschetta, and that's all I can really comment on - I chose to use crab instead of the tomatoes. It was delicious! The herbed feta is really outstanding - get the herbed, it will really alter the flavor if you don't. The next time I have fresh tomatoes I'll make as-written - that mixture sounds great, too. My boyfriend is complementing these as I speak - thanks so much for sharing :)

Switch the feta to Tomato/Basil flavor instead of the Herb/Garlic, and forgo the mozzarella.  I made if for my in-laws over Christmas, and not a single piece was left!

Amazing! This recipe turned out wonderfully! The proportions of tomotoes to basil and garlic was perfect.  Rather than heating the tomato mixture, however, I made it a few hours in advance and let it marinate in the fridge.  I then just put it on top of the cream cheese/feta mix cool and it tasted rather nice in contrast to the warmth of the bread.  I will DEFINITELY make this recipe again!

Awesome recipe. Wife my and I are connaisseurs of bruschetta and this was better than our favorite Italian restaurant's bruschetta. I peeled the tomatoes and added 1 tbsp of balsamic vinegar, and served on oven-toasted slices of sourdough baguette.

I made this for a bachelorette party and it was the only food that didn't have leftovers at the end of the night (due to distractions).  The only change I made was to pop them back in the oven to melt the cheese.  I like the brown crust on top.  I also didn't use enough bread, so I could have made more and wish I had!

This recipe is pretty good but not worth the effort it takes to make it. And I find the bruschetta better with cold tomatoes rather than warm ones.

I more a fan of traditional bruschetta, but this was still quite delicious.  I put too much of the cheese mixture on the toast, so that kind of took away from the tomato flavor.  I'll be sure to keep that in mind next time.  Still very good.  Everybody loved it.

This recipe was pretty simple but it was a little daunting to have to seed and chop the tomatoes.  Next time I may have to do diced tomatoes from a can instead.  Also the cheese "spread" was very thick and although the recipe calls for blended the cream cheese and feta cheese, your may scratch your head and bit and wonder with a blender?  (DON'T use a blender, lol).  I did have to add a little milk to it (heavy cream probably would have been better) to get it a little creamier to spread on the bread.  Otherwise I would make it again and made a few variations too.

This was a hit and I came home with an empty plate.  I  think that cooking the tomatoes and basil with garlic and olive oil really helped bring out the flavors.  After adding the mozzarella I put the bruschetta back in the oven for a few minutes to melt the cheese.  Very nice recipe, thanks for sharing, Carrie!

I made this for a potluck today. holy moly this is so good. I  haven't even made it to the potluck yet but I know it will be a hit. I made a sample plate for the photo, so of course I had to eat the sample. Thank you Carrie for this great recipe. I did modify only a little bit. Just brushed the bread with garlic I fused olive oil and added more garlic to feta and cream cheese mixture.

So delicious!!!   Feta and cream cheese mix...YUM!!! Added some chopped kalamata olives to half the tomato mixture (used both canned petite diced tomatoes and fresh tomatoes) because I love them, but wasn't sure if everyone at our party would.  Both versions came out fantastic!
