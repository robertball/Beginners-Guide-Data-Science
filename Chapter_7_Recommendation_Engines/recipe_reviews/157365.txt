Yum!!  I absolutely loved this-a couple of minor adaptions- I chopped up the chipolte peppers instead of pureeing them and baked them on a hot cookie sheet that was placed in the oven as it preheated.  It's also a very beautiful looking bread.  I like the addition of cheese cubes (as opposed to shredded) because it made swirls of cheese.  Used a kitchenaid stand mixer for the mixing and kneading - and it was pretty easy.

Absolutely amazing!  We froze two of the loaves and the dough thawed beautifully!  Next time I think I'll use a sharper cheddar (we only had mild on hand)to really accent the chipotle.  Totally worth the effort!

This bread is decadent!  Made a few modifications in that I used cheese crumbles (in the shredded cheese aisle of the store) which allowed for chunks of cheese mmmmm!, made loaves (think Italian bread) and basted with water to give it a crustier crust. All around a great recipe - although a bit labor intensive, but TOTALLY worth it!

Thank goodness I would never do anything as absurd as give up carbs, otherwise I would never have tasted this extraordinary loaf.  The cream cheese adds a nice texture and flavor layer.  I used chipotle with the seeds, and the heat is about right for me, and I tend to lean toward the spicy side of life.  A keeper!

Used 2/3 cup of chipotle pepper puree with the seeds (I just chopped up the peppers myself). I used mild cheeses b/c that's what I had, but it was still amazing. Made it in the kitchen aide with the dough hook for the most part, although I had to pull it out to knead in some of the flour that would not incorporate. It is a MESSY dough, but so worth it. Baked to an internal temp of 190 degrees. Covered with foil after ten minutes to prevent over-browning. Even though my friends know I love to bake, everyone at my church community group thought I had purchased this at a bakery. It looked and tasted amazing, although you might leave out the seeds if you don't like REALLY spicy bread.

When you get chiptle peppers in adobe sauce thay are usually whole so to cut down on the heat cut them open and scrap the seeds out. If you like it a little hotter you can adjust the seed content to taste. I hope this helps for those having a question on why I said to scrap the seeds from the peppers. If you can find chipotle peppers in the adobe and they dont need to be scraped you can use those just as well.

Very labor intensive time consuming recipe but well worth the effort.  The family loved it.  It made a wonderful toast too.  I know the dough won't be as good but I am going to try adding the cheeses and chipotle to thawed and raised frozen bread dough letting it raise again.

This bread is delicious!  I made one loaf for home and one loaf for work and they were a big hit.  The dough was tough to knead by hand with the various cheeses, but the labor was worth it.  I removed the chipotle seeds to decrease the fire.  I baked two loaves together on a 12.5"-diameter pizza stone; they barely fit!

OMG!  So good.  I loved it right out of the oven, but toasted is excellent, too!  I added more flour when I was kneading in the chipotle in adobo because it got very sticky, but other than that, I did not change a thing.  I also left the seeds in.  It has a kick, but not to much.

MMMmmm... so good.  Made basically according to recipe, but halved it, and used fat-free cream cheese.  Also, used 2 cups of all purpose flour and two cups whole wheat bread flour. Turned out great!

I cut the recipe down and made one loaf.  Everyone who tried it said it was the best bread they had ever tasted.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I have to admit, I followed the recipe but didn't love it. It was okay but we threw the rest away after having the first few slices. I might make the recipe again as a standard cheese bread with some modifications. Maybe we didn't make it right but it wasn't one of our best breads.

I achieved the same crunchiness on a baking pan as I did on the pizza stone.  My stand mixer made easy work of it, kept it clean, and I didn't have to spread flour on my counter.  
The flavor was a little flat.  I'll add 25% more salt next time (an extra tsp).  Definitely keep the seeds as it wan't too spicy.  I'll probably double the amount of chipotles/adobe next time.  Maybe I'll de-seed half of them.  The Big Green Egg charcoal grill added a nice flavor (didn't add any wood chips) without overpowering at all.  Next time I'll put 50% of the dough in one blob, not two, on my pizza stone on the Egg, and the rest in the oven in two blobs.
Jessie Kay, please consider re-writing step 2 so it is crystal clear that all 9 cups of flour are to be added in that step.  Your parenthesis confused me and made me think "remaining flour" was of the 4 cups, not the 9.  Adding the phrase "remaining 5 cups" would have been clearer, at least for me.  I added the remaining 5 cups at the very end and expected hockey puck scones since it rose only 20% (vs. 200%) before cooking, but it turned out well, had air pockets, and looked just like all the other pics.

Made with same ingredients as posted. With bread I take the extra time to make all loaves completely by hand.  No bread machine, no mixer.  All by hand.  It's a 3-hour labor of love, but oh so worth it in the end.  

After kneading the initial dough to pliable consistency, I kneaded in the cheeses and peppers.  Doing so, was by far the wettest bread dough I've ever worked with.  No big deal, wiped it off after and we're good to go.  :-)

I always use sharp or extra sharp cheese when cooking or baking.  The bite of the aged cheddar adds such a nice dimension.

In the oven, I baked for 10 minutes, opened the oven, brushed the crust with water to make it crustier.  I also at this point covered the loaves with aluminum foil, to lighten the color of the crust.

Make sure your pizza stone or cookie sheet is big enough, as any cheddar cheese cubes near the edge of each loaf will melt and ooze out during baking.   Had a little melt-age mess, but not too bad.  The loaves expand a lot during baking.

You'll definitely enjoy a piece when it's fresh out of the oven, however the true taste of this bread is the next day at room temperature.  At room temp you can distinguish the varied and well-paired flavors in each piece.  I am a hard sell to put a savory bread into my "A" category.   This one made it.   :-)

ps, took to the office the next day, colleagues loved it -sending me texts such as "YUM YUM!!!"  and "What is that bread?!?   Delicious!!!"  Make it as described above and your famil

I threw the recipe away right after making it because it was a bit of a hassle to make.  It was so good, I pulled the recipe out of the garbage and will certainly make again.  Didn't need four loaves but it freezes well.

Incredible flavor and texture. Four of us ate 3 of the 4 loaves in less than 1 day. 
I used the ingredients and quantities exactly as written. Excellent.
