This was fantastic. I used a strawberry/rhubarb puree and WOW it tasted so good. This is a sweet pie so if you don't like sssswwweeeet then don't make it or complain. Took most of day to firm up.

I used more strawberries than the recipe called for and it turned out great! It is very sweet especially if you use 1 cup of sugar, I didn't use quite that much. You might also need to make more of the jelly - mixture because mine didn't fill up the pie crust, I had a lot of crust showing. But if you cover it up with whip cream and a couple of strawberries you can't tell the difference!

Didn't set up for me, the filling was tasty but like water. I'll keep trying for the perfect strawberry pie recipe.

I've always had bad luck making fresh strawberry pie, but this one turned out fantastic!  I decided to just make the filling without the crust and put it in individual dishes and topped with cool whip.  It set up perfectly!

This is the worst pie I've ever had.  Way too much sugar and the jello does not help anything.

The best strawberry pie ever !!  I think adding the 1/3 cup of pur√©e is what makes it extraordinary.  Also it comes out of the pan perfectly - no falling apart as I have found with other recipes.
