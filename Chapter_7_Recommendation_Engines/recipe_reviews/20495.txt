This is even better if you float just a little of the Irish cream on top.

This is one of my favorite drinks. We decided to stay in on a very cold day and have some cocktails. This really hit the spot. I used a food processor and added a few ice cubes to make it frothy. Turned out great!

Now this is the way I'm familiar with! These went well with guys and gals. Although I don't care for it, I have served these in shot glasses with a small swirl of whip cream (out of a can) for a little touch. A great way to start out the night!!

the point of the name is to put grenadine at the end and it sinks to the bottom of the shot glass and looks like a boob with a nipple at the bottom becuz of the shape of the inside of the glass. but these are awesome i like them alot!

Very good and easy to drink. We didn't really like that it was at room temperature though. Next time we will use 1 and 1/2 ounces of each liqueur shaken in a cocktail shaker with ice and served in a martini glass.

Chill the bottle of butterscotch schnapps & Baileys first then pour equal amounts into your rocks-size glass.   After 2 it will sneak up on you!

You are all correct in calling these Buttery Nipples. The "Slippery Nipples" shot came first, before butterscotch schnapps hit the scene. Slippery nipples are made with Sambuca, with irish cream floated on top. Either way, they are both yummy, but these "Buttery Nipples" are the best!

These are really divine. I drank these a lot when I first was legal and thought 
that ordering all the "suggestive" drinks was so.....vogue. Yeah.

Funny. We call them Buttery Nipples here.

It really is good. Try it with a little 
whipped cream on top and then shoot it.
It just slides down and leaves a nice 
aftertaste.

I've been a bartender for15 years, and this is actually a Buttery Nipple.  Slippery Nipples are made with Sambuca or Peppermint Schnapps, depending on what part of the country you're in.  It is a delicious recipe, though, and an easy one for those that don't drink often, or don't typically like the taste of alcohol.

Very very good! Goes down easy and tastes great. I added a little cherry juice which sank to the bottom for the imagination.

This is one of my FAVORITE drinks to order when out, or make at home.  I usually order it as a "drink" instead of a "shot" and its usually called "Buttery Nipple"

This is one of my favorite shots. We always called them buttery nipples and put just a dot of grenadine on the top.

One of my favorites. Don't ever this if you're a female alone at a bar. I learned this the hard way when a drunk guy offered to take me out to his truck and give me one for free. EWW. I paid for the drink!:)

It's ok. Not for everybody. Add 3/4 shot of 100 proof peppermint schnapps for a "Pinched Nipple" and on top of that add a teaspoon of Tabasco sauce for this to become a "Pierced Nipple".

I did equal parts vodka, butterscotch and Irish cream, shaken with ice and served as a martini. Could easily cut it with some half and half.
