Tasted great, although I think if I made them again I would add about 3/4 of the vanilla batter to the pan before adding the chocolate to the rest. Cutting it in half as the reciped stated, the chocolate batter didn't seem chocolately enough, so I added another square (and I used semisweet). Plus, when I added the remaining chocolate batter to the pan, it covered the entire top of the vanilla batter, so no white was visible on the top when I tried to marble it. So I think a little less chocolate batter would have worked better.

Came out Ok.  Be sure to split the batter evenly when making the chocolate half.  I was in a bit of a hurry and probably used a little more than half the batter for the chocolate and the end result was the bars with more white tasted better because they were more evenly balanced taste wise.  It's also not a very deep batter when poured making it tough to marble w/o scraping the bottom crust.  May be easier to marble first then pour into the pan.

I didn't have oreos or other creme cookies so I used graham crackers for the crust.  Still came out delicious, very flavorful and not too sweet.

MMM! Perfect! Though, don't make the mistake of buying double stuffed cookies, too much icing makes them too sweet, and the flavor of the icing doesn't really go with the rich cheesecake as well. I might even scrape out the icing next time. Marbling was not easy, next time I'll add the chocolate to only 1/3 of the batter to get better control of the marble. Other than that, these were so so tasty that I will definitely make them again and take them to gatherings.

This is a super easy, very good recipe. I used Who-Nu oreo-type cookies for the crust. I put probably 3/4 or a little more of the plain cheesecake batter over the crust, mixed the chocolate with the rest....next time I'll use even less of the chocolate batter, probably about a cup or a cup and a half, just enough for the marbled effect without the blobs of chocolate in the bars. I froze some of these for another day as I've had good luck freezing similar bars.

I made these so that my fiance could take them to his office as a treat, and he said they were gobbled up right away.  I saved a few for us to have at home and thought they were yummy, too!  I consider myself a novice baker and found these very easy to make. I agree with other comments that suggest using slightly less chocolate batter than vanilla batter.  Remember also that the chocolate is unsweetened, so it gives the bars a dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate flavor.

Pretty good - tasty and very rich. I think they may be better layered instead of marbled but otherwise no complaints. Definitely a treat for hardcore cheesecake lovers.

I've never made cheesecake beforeâ€”I'm new to baking in general.  But these were fantastic! I followed the tips I'd read about setting aside less than half of the batter for the chocolate part.

Made these for a bridal shower and recieved rave reviews by all who devoured them. Slimmed them down by using lower fat cream cheese and lower fat condensed milk.

I wasn't that impressed. And somehow the marble part was like chocolate sand.

Made this for a work party, they LOVED it.  Some people who didn't even like cheesecake were raving about it!  The ONLY thing is that it didn't marble very well for me, it was more just a chocolate layer on top, but it did nothing to mess up the taste, and it still looked delicious, even without that.

I loved these bars and found them extremely easy to make. They came out so rich and delicious. The only change I made was instead of the cookie base I used graham crumbs because that is what I had. It worked perfectly...
