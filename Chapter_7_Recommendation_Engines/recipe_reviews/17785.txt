Of the 3 adults (kid wouldn't try it) at the table, 2 gave it a 3 (not enough taste, not attractive) and 1 gave it a 5.  It was too watery so if I make it next time, I will drain the mushrooms.  I would also add a touch of cornstarch to the soy sauce to make more of a coating for the chicken and veggies.  Garnishing with chopped green onions would help with the appearance.

This was good and simple enough. I used fresh mushrooms and a little bit of chicken broth to replace the mushroom liquid. The finished dish isn’t the prettiest to look at. It would benefit from some added color. If I make this again, I would probably add some red and green peppers.

Used fresh mushrooms and replaced the 'mushroom' liquid I would've had from the can with 2 TBsps. 'Mama Sita's BBQ Marinade/Sauce'. This helped mellow out the soy/salty flavour. I also added fresh garlic, red belle peppers, green bell peppers and sliced carrots. Served over rice.

Really is wonderful....like a previous reviewer, it is not very appealing to the eye. I followed a few others reviews and altered the recipe. I used FRESH mushrooms, did not use 3 onions, because I only had one...cannot imagine using 3..maybe 2, but not 3.. I added some cabbage, and on my next time of cooking this (it is good enough for me to cook again) I am going to add water chestnuts for crunch and flavor. On the pic you see something red, so will try red bell pepper. If I can cook something and everyone loves it,  A OK with me!

Absolutely delicious flavor!!  Once I got home I realized that I didn't have the can of mushrooms that I thought I had:) so I just added a little water.  Still a wonderful flavor!  I'm sure it will be even better next time with the mushrooms!!

I added a bit of Chinese 5 spice and left out the mushrooms since I didn't have any.  This was delicious served with chicken flavored rice with chopped veggies..

Very yummy and filling with the onions, celery and mushrooms. I used fresh mushrooms instead of canned.

This recipe needs spice changes to meet our taste. Chicken, celery, onion and soy sauce are a good start, but we prefer to use sesame oil, water chestnuts not mushrooms, and some chicken broth not water, 1/4 tsp. garlic powder and pinch of Chinese 5 spice then tighten the sauce up with a Tb. or less of cornstarch. Serve on cooked rice, pass the soy sauce, and top with crunchy Chinese noodles.

This was okay. It was quick, but kind of bland. I did add some garlic. I would make again just for a quick meal to have on hand when needed.

Good. Simple easy. My husband who is very picky likes it. So now it’s on my regular repertoire and keep canned mushrooms in the pantry.

We loved this dish. I followed the directions to a T. Next time I will add thinly sliced carrots and substitute a small can of Chinese vegetables for the mushrooms. Thanks for a great quick meal.

I do not know why this recipe has rated as highly as it has. Tasteless, slimy, uninteresting are words that come to mind.

Definitely delicious! Make sure to get a good seer on the chicken to add a little more color appeal.

Really easy and fast. Easily adapting any asian vegetables that you may want to add. I added a can of bean sprouts, substituted sesame oil, and added extra chicken.
