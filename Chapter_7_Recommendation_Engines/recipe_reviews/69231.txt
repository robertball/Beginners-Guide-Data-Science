I wanted to change a few things on this recipe, it turns my father had copied it down wrong. Although this is a recipe from my dads family, my grandmother taught my mother how to make it. When I fixed a pot last night I was so disappointed, I called mom and discovered dad had given me his

Very bland as is.  I melted 1/2 cup butter in the pan, added the oysters with the juice, added garlic salt, paprika, and celery seed.  Cooked the oysters until done, added 2% milk and heated through.  Much better with these additions.  By adding the oyster juice it actually tasted like oyster stew.

Oyster stew is meant to be simple and mild, just like this one!  I normally use some half and half and some milk.  I love a recipe which never takes away from the main ingredient, the oysters!!!

Oyster stew has been a family tradition every Christmas Eve, and we also light luminaries.  My grandma had everyone over before church, then my parents, and now my husband and I host whoever is available to stop by.  I saute the drained oysters in the butter, then add some of the juice from the cans, 2% milk and half-n-half with salt and pepper to taste.  We have to have about one can of oysters per person.  This is a simple recipe and perfect just the way it is.

This is a simple and easy recipe.  I know it may not suit a lot of tastes but it is just like the one my mother made.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I grew up with the same tradition on Christmas Eve having Oyster Stew and Chili and I can't tell you how many people think that's strange so maybe we're long lost relatives:).  I'm almost postive this is the same recipe that my grandmother used, but once I started making it on my own I added a few things.  I like it a little more thick like a stew so a make a reux with butter, flour and chopped onion.  Once the oysters have been sauteed in the butter and the reux is done I combine everything, including the half and half into one put and add a splash of worchestire sauce.  I love this stew and look forward to passing this tradition on to my own two daughters as long as I can get them to try it.  I may have to do what my grandmother did and tell them it's potatoe soup:).

This recipe isn't very good - horribly bland.
Skip it and open a can of Campbells.

I Can see from some of the reviews that adding milk would help a lot, but i did not care for the dish. it was like eating Oysters in a nice butter sauce (that part i liked) but the Half and Half was just too much. it was like drinking creamer. after the meal i felt i wasted some good Oysters ='(

This is a good recipe. I added 2 tbs. of coriander and one tbs. of paprika. I also didn't drain the oysters. Instead I dumped the can of oysters with the juice in the pot. These things added a lot of flavor.

Just like my grandmothers! The only changes I made is I did add some whole milk and cut back on the half and half. And after cooking the oysters in butter I added salt, pepper and the the drained juice from the oysters back in. Real comfort food!!!
