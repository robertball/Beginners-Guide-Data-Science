Very yummy. Makes far more dressing than you need, but we made more salad the next day and thought the day-old dressing was even tastier. Will make this again, without a doubt.

This was very good.  I made the entire batch of dressing but only fixed a lunch sized salad for myself.  I used gorgonzola cheese rather than blue.  I just drizzled the dressing on the salad.  I really enjoyed the salad.  I think the dressing was a bit oily and may switch it up a bit next time but I will be making this salad again!  Thanks!

I made the dressing just as the recipe was written.  For the salad ingredients, I did not have pecans so substituted slivered almonds.  I did not have blue cheese so used mozzarella.  Served this at a summer shower with dressing over the whole salad and got requests for the recipe!  Really yummy!

Only change I made was to use Splenda (and cut the calories).  Toasted walnuts worked great (and easier on the budget). This is the spinach salad everyone wants.

Perhaps  Brave or Stupid.. I made this recipe for a church event. Never tried it at home first. (Usually not a good idea.)
It is a most wonderful, tasty and easy to make salad. The dressing is divine. Thanks for making the luncheon  a success!

I had a feeling that any dressing made with white vinegar would be too sharp, plus I had my doubts about adding Worcestershire sauce to a sweet dressing.  Also -- white sugar?  Really? I made it with half vinegar and half lemon juice, and substituted Manuka honey for the sugar.  It was pretty good that way but next time I will use all lemon juice and no Worcestershire.
