There is one major problem.  Bisquick IS NOT DAIRY FREE!!!!  It has an Orthodox Union DAIRY hescher which means it contains milk whey and proteins in it.

I have been making this for forty years, but with dairy! It is delicious!  These are my changes:  I always add a couple of dashes of cinnamon to the batter for a better color and zip.  I add more sugar because I like a sweeter dough.  We love the streusel topping, so I always make way more of that and also put walnuts or pecans in.  Finally, these are GREAT as mini-muffins or regular muffins. They look spectacular but only take a couple of minutes to make.

My roommates and I made this tonight for dessert. It was really delicious! My only complaint is that it was a little bit dry, but it was a nice way to use bisquick in a way other than pancakes or biscuits. It was also pretty affordable for a college budget. I would definitely recommend!

I have made this before and its wonderful.  Just a note.  One of the reviewers claims there is dairy in bisquick.  There is not.  My husband is lactose intolerant so we are very careful.  There is nothing in the ingredients that would signal there is any dairy in it.

This was good, but I didn't read all of the reviews or I would have been aware that it turns out pretty dry.  I would make this again but next time I will add some applesauce to the batter.  Also, I folded in blueberries after mixing the other ingredients- it's a nice variation.

Very good... too bad it isn't gluten free as well.  Good thing I made it before my sister and brother were gluten free, just dairy free.  But I would definitely recommend this to anybody who is just dairy free.  One change: We don't like soy milk, so we substituted with vanilla rice milk.  It was still good!

I played around with this and it turned out pretty good. I would recommend apple sauce for a moister cake. I like a sweet batter also, as another member suggested. I used Krusteaz brand pancake mix and added an additional 2/3 cup of white sugar. I also added cinnamon to the batter as well. Instead of using soy milk, I used 2/3 cup of sugar free vanilla coffee creamer and 1/4 cup of regular milk. I also added 1 Tbl of vanilla for more flavor. Flavor was really good, I only wished I had included the apple sauce also. This is a keeper.

Good recipe. I used Stevia in place of sugar & added 1/2 cup of pumpkin, 1/2 cup applesauce, & raisins to batter. I exchanged the soy milk for a little water & plain yogurt. Enjoyed it for breakfast this morning:)

Easy to make, tasty cumbly topping, but as others have remarked the cake portion is a bit on the dry side even with added yogurt and vanilla extract.  :(  Tonight I have added 1/3 cup crushed pineapple, 2 bananas, 2 tbsp greek yogurt, and a tsp of vanilla extract so we'll see if that loosens up the batter a bit.

This was quick and easy! The cake is so light and sweet, you don't feel like you are over-doing it. I made a sugarfree version and instead of topping it off with streusel before baking, I sprinkled it on with about 7 min left in the oven and poured warm sugarfree icing on top after I pulled it out to cool! Yum!

I found myself with unexpected breakfast guests and limited ingredients so tried this recipe.  I didn’t have brown sugar so substituted white sugar, a little honey and some espresso powder in the topping.  I also didn’t care about dairy free so used skim milk.  This was very delicious and easy.  A keeper!

these are the changes i made.. after reading how it may be dry i decided to do this.
I added 1/8 TBS cinnamon to the dry mix and I used milk and i also added a 1/3 half and half.. 
so it kept it really nice not dry at all.. with all the changes i made i could not give it a 5 star

This is a good, quick recipe. I used regular (complete) pancake mix and milk. The second time I made the recipe I modified it by adding an extra 1/3 c. milk, adding cinnamon, and doubling the sugar in the batter. This recipe is tasty as is, but is easily customized to your preferences.

Much better a day later after it has had time to sit. I'm not sure why. I also did not omit the dairy. I think I made my streusel wrong as it was very hard after baking, more like an awkward toffee.

I made this for the first time today.  I made some alterations to the recipe as i always do with everything i make.  I added jam to the batter and made it a marble coffee cake and drizzled frosting from powdered sugar and butter came out great.

So good! I added applesauce, cinnamon and nutmeg and couldn't have been happier with the result! I brought it for a class at school and my friends couldn't stop eating it!

Wanted to have more of the crumbly topping.  Next time I will double the topping.
