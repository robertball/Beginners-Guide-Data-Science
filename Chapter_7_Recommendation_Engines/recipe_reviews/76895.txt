I felt like a real chef with this one. The chicken was golden and beautiful.The shallots, wine, and some mushrooms were all a great combination of flavors! Made with mashed baby confetti potatoes and sugar snap peas tosed in olive oil with the rest of the shallots and some rosemary then baked for a couple of minutes. Gourmet meal in a half an hour!

I've been traveling for nearly two weeks and have only two days before I take off again.  After days of restaurant meals I was in the mood for a quick, good, home-cooked dinner but I wasn't about to go grocery shopping.  This chicken dish was just what I needed.  It contained ingredients I always have on hand.  I love the simplicity of not just the preparation, but of the flavors.  I don't need lots of bold seasoning to please my palate.  A little wine, a little garlic and I'm happy.  I said I wanted quick,  so I butterflied the chicken breasts, which not only reduced the cooking time, but also ensured they cooked evenly. For good, golden color I dredged them in flour before I pan seared them. Served this with the simple and basic "Parsleyed Rice Pilaf" also from this site.

This dish was really good!I used seasoned salt when browning in addition to the pepper. I also added fresh mushrooms and extra garlic.Used Chicken Flavored Better than Boullion instead of broth, and a Pinot Grigio for the wine. Served over Mini Penne. If I make it again, I would double the sauce. Thanks, Amy.

First know that I rarely follow a recipe exactly..I didn't pound the breasts thin.  I like a more plump and juicey breast.  I also added fresh mushrooms and thickened the wine sauce a bit after the breasts were done.  VERY TASTEY!!  We loved it!  Thanks Amy.

This was a big hit with my family!  I had to modify this recipe by omitting the wine because my hubby and son despise anything cooked in wine.  I used a full cup of chicken broth and added water to cut the saltiness.  My family prefers thicker pieces of chicken so I didn't thin them and simmered everything together for the duration of cook time.  I added some mushrooms and a heaping tbsp of flour to thicken the sauce and at the end, topped each chicken breast with a folded slice of havarti cheese and let some of it melt into the sauce.  Delicious!

This recipe was great, and added mushrooms for texture and cornstarch to thicken the sauce, and seasoned the chicken with lemon pepper which gave it nice flavour. The sauce was outstanding, but I would double it next time because it reduces quickly, especially when you add the cornstarch.

Fabulous recipe! Relatively quick and very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out great. Next time I might use less butter to make it a little healthier. I think the sauce would still work with 1 tablespoon of butter and the chicken could be cooked in straight olive oil. Overall, though, a wonderful chic recipe. Thanks!

I am always looking for tasty, quick dinners. This meets the criteria. My husband works days & I work midnights. So when he leaves work he calls me to wake me up. I get up and cook dinner. By the time he gets home (1 hr) dinner is ready.  This dinner was delicious. I think next time I'll double the liquid so there will be more of that delicious sauce! This recipe is definitley going into the rotation!

My family prefers dark meat so I substituted chicken thighs and they were terrific...The only other change I made was that I added some grated onion to the chicken stock...and a little dijohn mustard to the sauce for a little zing...Adding mushrooms also is good

This is  a good recipe.  I pulled out an old restaurant method.  Pounded the chicken breast until thin.  Then I dredged them in a little seasoned flour and then cooked them.  This helps absorb flavor, give color and thicken the sauce a bit.  I too added a shade more garlice as I think any cooking problem can be resolved with more garlic.  I would eat it again.

I made a few adjustments/additions, but stayed true to the recipe overall.

Adjusted the recipe for two.  In addition to the listed ingredients, I used two cloves of garlic (left it in larger slices; after cooking for fifteen minutes, it's not bite-y enough to matter), about a Tbs and a half of fresh thyme, chopped, mushrooms, as someone else suggested.  I also added a split leek in there.  I was actually braising them to go with dinner as a side-dish, but I love the flavor so having them in with the other aromatics was perfect.  I thought the sauce amount was good as it was, however after tasting it, I wanted it on everything, including my mashed potatoes.  So next time I might double that.  Lovely, flavorful, perfection!

This is not only delicious, but very quick to prepare. I have made this several times, and as others suggested, have traded off between white wine, marsala, and sherry.Try a touch of fresh basil, too. Its wonderful.

This was wonderful- my husband loved it. We put it over rice, I think that's probably the best combo. It might also be quite nice over linguini though.

I put in mushrooms, and I also used double the shallots. I used garlic salt instead of plain salt. I also thickened the sauce with a little bit of flour- but wow, nice base recipe. Enjoyed this a lot and will make it again for sure.

As a chef, I decided to do some looking around on this website for ideas on dinner. This recipe caught my eye, and it was decided. In my professional opinion, this recipe can easily be a gourmet meal, with very little prep time and few ingredients. The sauce resembles a simple chicken veloute, and after being strained, can really make the dish something to remember. I do have a suggestion. In order to make the sauce slightly thicker, a beurre manie can be added right before the serving in order to keep the sauce from running all over the plate. Absolutely delicious.

I was really puzzled at first, because there are mushrooms in the picture, but not in the recipe!  I must have read the recipe through half a dozen times.  Then, I started looking through the reviews, because I really like mushrooms, and I was curious how other cooks had adapted the recipe.  I FINALLY found a review that stated to add 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms, and boy, I'm glad I did!  This is probably pretty good without mushrooms, but it's fabulous with them.  We really enjoyed this, and I plan to make it again, with mushrooms!  I may add a little fresh minced parsley, too.

Great recipe.  I used madeira for the white wine.  Also sprinkled a little onion powder on the chicken along with the salt and pepper.  Thickened the sauce just a bit with about 1 T. of cornstarch dissolved in 1/4 c. water.  Everybody loved it, even the kids.  Will definitely make again.

This worked really well for me. I didn't pound out the chicken. I just sauteed it, removed it, & let it rest while I finished the sauce. After the shallots were cooked, I added the wine being sure to incorporate the carmelized juices from the bottom of the pan. With the heat up, I reduced the wine by about a quarter before adding the stock which I also reduced slightly. I added only as much butter as was needed to produce a medium thin sauce. I sliced the chicken before saucing & served with grilled radicchio.
Oh, almost forgot:o) Doubled the sauce! Really impressive. Thanks for posting:o)

I also added mushrooms like others....and added just a bit of flour after the mushrooms were sauteed....to help thicken the sauce.  It was delicious.  Added some green onions for some flavor and cruch when I served it.  Hubby exclaimed...that it smelled great...and tasted great too.  Thanks for the post.

My husband and I eat chicken alot and I am always looking for new ways to prepare it.  I saw this, it looked fast and easy and I happened to have some shallots on hand so I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'm so glad I did!  It was easy, delicious and we both loved it.  Will definitely make again.

6 stars!  I didn't change a single ingredient but I simplified the cooking process and it came out even BETTER!  Instead of cooking the chicken and sauce separately, I browned the chicken according to instructions, then added the rest of the butter, shallots, and garlic to the pan and sauteed.  Finally, I added the wine and chicken broth and cooked everything covered until the chicken was done.  I had really thick chicken breasts and knew they wouldn't cook all the way through without the liquid.  I removed the lid for the last few minutes to thicken the sauce.  I make chicken all the time, and I this is one of the moistest, most flavorful chicken recipes I've ever eaten, not to mention fast and easy!  I was dumbfounded and thrilled by the simplicity of it.

I've probably made over 3 dozen recipes from this website, yet this is the first I'm taking the time to review-- not so much because it was good (which it was!) but because it was exactly what I was looking for at the time. My fiancé and I had friends in town and we had been out to dinner (and drinks!) several nights in a row. I was looking for something quick, easy, and *kind of* healthy that I could basically make with ingredients on hand. This fit the bill perfectly! The chicken came out moist and delicious and the sauce is simple and tasty but not overpowering. I was actually surprised that my fiancé liked this as much as he did but he said some variation of "mmmmmm" with every bite! I made only a few small changes based on other reviews: added additional spices (lemon pepper, garlic power) to chicken, and added a 1/4 cup additional broth. Otherwise followed exactly and it was great. Thanks Amy!

I make this regularly, and it's always wonderful! Easy but such delicious flavor. I usually cut down on the butter, and I've taken to throwing some asparagus in with the shallots and garlic just for the vegetable (and the flavors work well together), but this recipe is absolutely fantastic as it is. Thank you so much for posting it!

This recipe was outstanding EXACTLY as written.  The ONLY thing I would do differently next time is use even thinner breasts, or the pre-cut "Thin Sliced Cutlets"; I wasn't able to pound them thin enough and since the sauce is pretty delicate, i thought my chicken breasts were a tad too thick to really enjoy with the sauce.  The sauce was INCREDIBLE. Don't change a thing.

My family loved this. I also used fresh mushrooms and instead of the white wine, I used a Marsala wine and it gave it a great taste and also doubled that, so there would be enough sauce to spoon over the chicken and noodles/rice. I will definitely fix this again.

We loved this recipe - with a few changes to make it "ours."  I roasted 4 shallots in the oven. let them cool and diced them up for the sauce.  For the sauce I used 3/4 c boxed chicken stock - so much more flavor than broth.  I also dissolved abt a TBSP of corn starch in a couple TBSP cold water and added that to the sauce at the end to thicken it just a bit.  PERFECT!  I served rice and steamed broccoli with it for a fabulous dinner.  Thanks for sharing.

This was soooooooooooo good!  This was definetly restaurant quality -I did add a few things to it though - first, I added a little more shallots than what the recipe called for - toward the end of the simmering of the shallots, garlic, wine and chicken broth, I added a small can of mushrooms (without the juice) and I added about a tablespoon of cornstarch to the liquid. (I put a little water in a glass and then the tablespoon of cornstarch, and mixed it well until it was all dissolved) After the cornstarch was added, it thickened up considerably.  It was absolutely scrumptious and will be made again.......soon!  This is a keeper - thanks for the recipe!

Phenomenal! We love shallots so we used a little more. I deleted the butter at the end and used Wondra to thicken the sauce.

On the advice of others I did make a few changes before cooking. Additional seasoning and less cooking time for the chicken kept it flavorful & moist. I used flour (about 2T) to thicken the sauce, first adding it to the sauteing shallots, garlic, and mushrooms, then added the wine & stock.  Do add the mushrooms they add a nice flavor.

DELICIOUS!  I added 3 garlic cloves, sliced mushrooms and saute w/shallots and garlic.  The sauce is simply scrumptious!  May need to add a little cornstarch or flour to thicken a tad.  Served w/mashed potatoes and steamed veggies.

It has good flavour although I found it a little too salty... perhaps there is no need to season the chicken breasts with salt before cooking it. Although I only used 1/4 tsp of kosher salt, the overall chicken seemed a tad too salty for me. But a very easy and tasty dish, for sure!

We liked the flavor of this chicken.  Added fresh mushrooms and used cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  I think this would be good with fresh parsley too.

This recipe was all right.  It seemed to missing something.   Maybe more garlic and maybe lemon?  I am not sure if I will make this again.  My husband did finish it all though.

Quick, easy, simple, delicious! I used extra garlic because we love it. I usually have a good organic chicken stock on hand; but I happened to have the little tubs of knorr homestyle concentrated chicken stock, it was perfect in this as it has a little herb flavor to it. Perfect weeknight meal!

Wonderful recipe! I didn't have white wine, so I used white vinegar (maybe 1/4 C). I also used onions instead of shallots because I didn't have shallots. We were fighting over it!

I'd just bought some thinly-sliced chicken breasts and was eager to try them out.  They were perfect for this recipe, since they all cooked evenly.  I did sprinkle a little flour on the chicken so they'd have some color after browning, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I used pinot grigio wine which I'm now convinced does not add as much flavor as a chardonnay...last time I'll use that in cooking.  Was expecting a little more flavor, but still a nice and quick meal and looked nice on the plate.

Loved this one.  We added capers, mushrooms, a little extra garlic, doubled the sauce, added a little cornstarch to thicken it up a bit.  Put the chicken back in the last 5 mins to warm it up and to let it set in the sauce. Left out the butter at the end. Servered it over wild rice! Loved it!!

What an easy and delish recipe.  The whole thing took about 35 min.  I followed some reviewers advice and flattened the chicken breasts and also used 1 tbsp of corn starch to thicken the sauce.  I added about 1/2 cup of capers and it was fantastic.  My hubby LOVED, Thanks!!

This was fantastic! Everyone in my family enjoyed this one...shocker!! Usually my uber picky son finds something not to like...not this time! And, when he accidentally dropped a piece on the floor, the cat came and ate it, then sat at foot of my kids chairs, meowing & waiting for more to fall...he never does that, so this was a hit even with the cat haha...oh, I did dredge the lightly pounded chicken breasts in seasoned flour (garlic, salt, white pepper) then I browned them in the pan, took them out, added the shallots and some mushrooms, the wine, etc, and then when the sauce was ready, I put the chicken back in with the sauce, and let it all cook together for a few minutes. Served it with rice pilaf & broccoli. next time I will try it over pasta, as others suggested, that sounded very good, but I was already planning on making spaghetti and meatballs the next night, so I opted for rice this time. Great addition to the recipe box& I will be making this again soon.

This is my first review on Allrecipes even though I've tried many recipes.  I chose this recipe by using the ingredient search since I had chicken breasts and shallots on hand.  I followed it exactly and it was an excellent dish.  Served with mashed potatoes for the broth.

Really good and easy!! I sliced the chicken breast into three pieces. One the filet and then sliced the remaining  breast into two thin slices. Cooked faster, browned faster. Also added Tarragon but not necessary, I just like Tarragon a lot. Served with rice and green peas for a real tasty comfort food meal with a gourmet twist.

Very good recipe. I always make extra sauce so I can pour it over rice and veggies as well. I don't know if it's because I made so much sauce, but it definitely wasn't going to reduce enough so I used cornstarch to thicken it. Also my chicken didn't take anywhere near 10 minutes to cook through, so I would check it often. I've already made this a couple times and we love it!

This recipe is excellent! I took the advice and added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch and doubled the "gravy" the second time around. I've made it with mushrooms both times and it adds a great taste. I served it with egg noodles on the side and salad -- my boyfriend loved it!

I thought this chicken was just okay.  Although it was very tender, I did not feel that there was much taste to the dish, and found it in fact to be somewhat bland.  If you do decide to make this, I would not recommend mashed potatoes, I served this along side mashed potatoes and rice would've paired much better.

I also doubled the liquids (wine and broth).  It's delicious and simple. I think maybe I'll add capers next time.

Excellent! What more can I say? Such a simple chicken dish, yet so darn tasty! Even my picky eater loved it. Next time I make this I am going to use more shallots. They were wonderful!  This is a dish I would gladly serve my guests any day! I can hardly wait to make this again!

Very easy and tasty dish! I just added some sliced mushrooms to the sauce to make it a little more substantial. My hubby and I really enjoyed it :)

This was very fast and easy. I used two chicken breasts, pounded flat, doubled the amount of wine, and added a teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Dinner was on the table in 20 minutes and my finicky 15-year-old daughter gave it a thumbs up. She has a gluten allergy, so using cornstarch produced a nice, velvety sauce that she could eat!

My package of chicken breasts "looked" like there were 4 but there were only 3 humongus sized breasts. Followed recipe exactly. My husband and I split one of the larger breasts and now we have dinner all set for another night. The sauce from the white wine, chicken stock and butter mixed in with the shallots and garlic is absolutely wonderful and I'm no garlic fan.  This I will definitely do again! Thanks for sharing.

I followed this recipe exactly and I just wasn't impressed with it at all.  I've tried other chicken recipes on this website and this just doesn't compare.  The sauce just wasn't for me.

I made this while doubling and thickening up the sauce and adding sliced baby bella mushrooms. I served it with mashed potatoes.

It was a good, solid recipe. Used already thin, natural chicken breasts.  Cooking them for 10 minutes was a bit long. Would recommend going 7-8 minutes then allowing them to simmer in the sauce at the end.

After reading all the rave reviews (except for one) I couldn't wait to try this.  Sorry, but I was disappointed. I doubled the sauce as recommended and I added extra shallots and garlic as we like these flavors.  I found it to still be rather bland.  I doubt that I will make this again.

The sauce was flavorful, but the chicken did not absorb the flavor enough for me.  Using thin cut chicken breasts should help.  I even pounded my regular chicken breasts and it still did not do the trick.

I tried it and it was so easy. I didn't have any white wine so I used 2T-3T of balsamic vinegar in its place. Everyone loved it. The next time I going to try a pear infused balsamic, I think it would be very good too.

Gourmet flavor!  Absolutely delicious.  Very easy to make.  Add fresh mushrooms to increase delicate flavors.  Our whole family loved it.  I've made it twice in two weeks.

I tweaked this a bit for more flavor.  First dip chix in soy sauce,then in flour,fry until lightly crispy.  I also added mushrooms with the shallots and garlic.  simmer chix about 20-minutes until done.  Also thicken sauce with cornstarch and water.

We loved this quick and easy weekday meal. I had supper on the table in about 30 minutes.

I used boneless chicken thighs. I browned them and kept them in a warm oven while I sauteed the shallots, garlic and also portabello mushrooms cut in large chunks. I finished cooking the thighs in the sauce. I served with yellow beans and browned some leftover potatoes I had...Wonderful!

Excellent recipe. I used bone in chicken breasts. I removed the skin and brined them for an hour prior to cooking. They are definitely more juicy. Make sure your chicken is at room temperature prior to cooking it. This will help keep it from becoming dry or tough. Tripled the garlic (we like garlic!) and sprinkled with chopped fresh parsley prior to serving. Definitely a company worthy dish!

This is a great versatile recipe! I cut each breast in half vertically to cook the chicken faster and sprinkled them liberally with flour before searing them. I didn't have shallot, so I used minced sweet yellow onion. I doubled the sauce and before returning the chicken to the pan, used the sauce to steam asparagus. I served over brown rice. It was delicious! I will be using this recipe again but will try adding mushrooms.

The sauce reminded me too much of a French onion soup. I only used the 2 shallots that the recipe called for. My husband liked it though and we served it over bow-tied pasta. I wouldn't make this again.

i gave it a 4star only cause I had to change a few things because I didnt have things...so instead of shallots I made it with onions and i didnt have white wine so i just added a tad of sherry(about 1 tablespoon). Other then that they family loved it and the husband said "this is a winner" poured over penne pasta, and added mushrooms yum yum :)

Both very easy and delicious. Best of all, the cost of materials was very low. The tast of the sauce is just right, and I accented the flavor a bit by adding capers.

I've made this exactly as written as well as adding other herbs/spices.  My favorite is pretty much as it is and served over rice with grillled or sauted asparagus.  This is just such a wonderful receipe and you almost can't go wrong.  I would definitely serve this if I were looking to impress without going crazy.  My super picky fiancé asks for this dish often.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe.  I followed just as written and the sauce that it makes is quite wonderful.  I had steamed several zucchinis to serve with dinner and the sauce even tasted great on that.  Very easy to follow, just be sure to monitor the heat level when tenderizing the garlic and shallots so they don't burn.  Although we are not wine drinkers I do keep some in the cupboard for cooking.  I found it provided a great flavor.  Will definitely make again.

I also cut back on the butter for health purposes. Plus I added two teaspoons of Cayenne pepper to liven it up a bit. Fantastic easy recipe.

This was really, really good and easy. I had chicken breast strips, so it cooked a little faster. I also followed the suggestion of others and added a little corn starch to thicken it. It would probably be better with flour, but I have wheat allergies, so I used corn starch. I also added some fresh basil to taste.   I will probably let my pan get hotter next time so that I can get more of a searing, but it was still really good!

Came out great... chicken was fairly tender.  I added 1/2 t of turmeric to the butter and olive oil to give the chicken a nice color and added a tiny bit of red pepper flakes to the shallots and garlic to give a touch of spice.  Also added much more garlic.  Served it with spiced cut okra (touch of cumin seeds, mustard seed, ground coriander, turmeric, salt and a little chili powder.)  Also served with sauteed garlic with spinach.

I think that I was expecting a lot more from this.  I made this as written, because my husband hates mushrooms, but I think that it really needs the addition.  I just couldn't get over the fact that it smelled like the preparations for my Thanksgiving dressing--melted butter, sweated shallots, chicken stock... The wine addition was good and the chicken cooked up beautiful and golden with the butter and EVOO, but it just wasn't enough for me to fall in love with.  I would recommend following some of the others advice and add something to the sauce (mushrooms, capers, something) to give it more interest. Also, I doubled the sauce and thought that 4 shallots was too much.  Double the liquid, not the shallots.

Very simple to prepare. Flattened my chicken breasts and added sliced button mushrooms. I also added a few additional seasonings just to give it a little bit more uummph.

This was an EXELLENT Chicken recipie. I came upon it the other night and decided to try it. It was quick easy and VERY good. I suggest adding more garlic, and I put LOTS of pepper and garlic salt on the chicken before I pan seared it. I will be making this again very soon. Thanks Amy!!!

Loved this recipe. I doubled the sauce (We love sauce and I just don't see how there would have been enough if I hadn't) and put about 1 TBS of cornstarch to the doubled sauce to thicken. It was wonderful. My husband and 3 little kids loved it too. Definitely a keeper. Thanks Amy.

I loved this recipe and my husband loved it even more.  We love the taste white wine gives to a sauce.  I made it a little different.  I prepared the sauce separate from the chicken and baked the chicken in the oven.  I cooked some plain rice to go with the chicken and with the sauce over both, it was an excellent meal.  One of my new favourites!

I though this was surprisingly good, especially given the short list of ingredients.   For 4 chicken breasts, I would double the sauce.  It makes this dish.

I made this for dinner this evening and it was truly a waste of time, effort and food. The chicken was tasteless, the sauce bland even with the wine, garlic, and shallots. Because it was steamed rather than fried, it was easy to masticate but that's the best thing I can say about it.

It's pretty much bland chicken breasts in onion sauce.  I will not make this again. I'll stick with the Chicken Marsala recipe from allrecipes instead, just as simple but way more flavorful and delicious.

Excellent! Easy, tasty sauce. Just watch out not to overcook. Depending on the thickness of your chicken breasts, you might need less time. I used one less TBSP of butter on the finish and didn't seem to miss it.

I liked the idea of this recipe but found it remarkably bland so I added one teaspoon of dried thyme which helped but the sauce was still too runny. By the time I did everything I felt it required to make it delicious, it wasn't the same recipe anymore. I would suggest using it as a base idea to launch your own creation.

This was a fun one to make. I have recently became a cast iron fanatic and pan seared chicken in cast iron and an easy oven to stove dish. I loved cooking with wine in this. The sauce over the chicken (and potatoes for me) was amazing. I didn't follow the recipe exactly, but it was very easy to make and like I said, fun. Anything cooked with wine is amazing. Might be my new favorite chicken recipe. Thanks for sharing!

I've made this a couple of times now and it has become a regular; so easy and very tasty.  The wine and chicken stock make a very nice reduction, but the shallots truly make the dish.  Highly recommend, your family and guests will be impressed.

My husband loved this and my fussy daughter did also!  Made as the recipe was written except used seasoning salt instead of regular seeing remarks that it needed something and also did not reduce any part of the sauce - still wasn't near enough - those breasts were huge flattened so I added a splash more wine and another 1/2 cup or so broth and thicken with a bit of rice flour (what I had been trying lately - blends easy!) Now I had enough sauce to also crown the mash pototates I served with it. Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe. Better than anything you'd find in your best restaurant. I used a ton more garlic because I love garlic and I also seasoned the chicken breasts with a lot of lemon pepper seasoning as opposed to salt and pepper. Truly, a fantastic dish.

I thought it was great.  It didn't take much prep and was easy to make.  It was my first time cooking with shallots.  I'm a fan.  Wife loved the smell when she walked in the door.  Very tasty.

Just finished making and eating this recipe. It turned out really good. I followed a reviewer and floured my chicken breasts before frying them. I used a cup of chicken broth instead of white wine because I didn't have any. It still turned out excellent. Thank you for the recipe, I will be making this again.

I was really dissappointed with the lack of flavor in this dish. I thought between the wine, shallots and garlic it would have a lot. As someone else suggested, I added some capers to the leftover sauce and it made the biggest difference.That, was a great idea. I'll make it again adding the capers and will use onions the next time because the shallots are expensive and didn't add anything to the flavor. Also, if you expect the garlic flavor to come through, you may want to add more or put the one clove through a garlic press instead of mincing. I'd also venture to say that if you didn't have wine on hand, you could just substitute with more chicken broth. This was very easy and quick to make and used only one pan. That's always a bonus!

This was awesome!  I cut the chicken into bite sized chunks and then sautéed.  I used less butter.

This was so easy and quite delicious. Mine came out a bit salty but that was my fault, I used salted butter and chicken bouillon to make the broth because that is what I had on hand. Everyone in our family ages 5 -70 loved it. It's a keeper.

This was delicious!  I added 1 tablespoon of olive oil for each chicken breast.  Added sugar snap peas to the sauce for last 3 minutes of cooking.  Outstanding!

This recipe has become a regular favorite for my family. I originally chose it because I happened to have some dried shallots in my cabinet and I thought I could substitute them. They worked great. Just a couple of teaspoons, and they are all chopped and ready. Such an easy recipe and it wins praise every time! This would be a great company dish, the taste is very gourmet!

Cooked as is except without pounding out the chicken. It was restaurant quality, very delicious. I may double the sauce next time though, there wasn't quite enough.

Great dish, but can be tricky. Careful not to over cook the chicken. I've done it several times. We've done with shallots, and it's very good. But like others, we used a little minced onion instead of shallots and added just a bit of cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce a bit and it turned out great. I also added a few drops of Worcester. One thing to keep in mind: this really makes just enough sauce to drizzle a little over each serving. Don't expect a gravy boat full! Once you get it right, this is an awesome dish!

I really liked this dish. It was packed with flavor and was a big hit at my house. I made a few additions.  First, I wanted a little citrus flavor, so I added some Limoncello and let it reduce with the wine. For the wine itself, I used a cheap Pinot Grigio - nothing fancy. I also added some portabello mushrooms, and a little corn starch to thicken the sauce.

This turned out delicious. I will definitely keep this recipe and make it again. I only made 2 servings of chicken but kept the rest of the measurements the same, and had plenty of extra (YUMMY) sauce. I also used half of a red onion instead of shallots, and added extra garlic, and chopped chives and basil with the butter at the end.  My picky eater husband practically licked his plate clean!

only used two chicken breasts but kept the sauce to the original recipe because so many reviewers said they'd double it. had to add cornstarch to thicken the sauce, and I also added 5-6 oz of sliced mushrooms about halfway through the chicken time. I forgot to s&p the chicken. I thought the dish was great, but hubby found it a little bland. I bet the s&p would fix that. Next time I'd serve with angel hair instead of linguine, and keep it at 1 shallot, as 2 were a bit intense.

Very good, just a bit bland.  No leftovers so that says something!  I did dredge the chicken breasts in flour, salt and pepper.  Would make again.

I agree with everyone else's reviews.  Just made it last night and it was quick, easy, and delicious!  I removed the breasts from the pan after browning, cooked up the garlic & red onion (didn't have shallots on hand) then thickened the sauce a bit.  Put the chickens back in and cooked another minute.  Came out perfect - no leftovers!!! Will definitely make this a staple dinner.

This was the best meal I have cooked in a while. We forgot to cook the side with it but decided at the last minute to just boil some noodles. It turned out great! We used fresh basil, green onions, and mushrooms in the sauce. Since it was our first time cooking with wine, we cooked the sauce and chicken separate. I think the flavors were excellent compliments!!

This recipe was a huge hit with my entire family (who diverse taste are enough to drive any mom crazy)! I was looking for a simple chicken recipe to test out my new Emeril frying pan and this was perfect.  I stayed true to the recipe for the most part, but added fresh mushrooms and fresh basic that i'd just bought from the farmer's market. I also tripled the sauce, because my fam is all about the sauces. The chicken turned out perfect - most and very juicy (i went extreme on the pounding).  The sauce was the kicker. My kids and husband all wanted leftovers the next evening!

At first I thought the chicken breasts would be a bit plain. I was wrong! The buttery sauce made the chicken perfect. I might have used a bit too much butter but nonetheless a great recipe for breasts. The pieces were juicy and tender. Great with rice. Going to be a regular in my household! Thanks :)

This was a decent meal but nothing that I would rate five stars. I doubled the liquids in the sauce, added 1/2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken things up a bit, as well as 8 oz. of thinly sliced mushrooms. I cut the butter down to 1 tbsp. I also used about three cloves of garlic. We had this with steamed yukon gold potatoes and freshly cooked green beans.

Love this recipe.  I leave the mushrooms out because I don't like them, but follow the rest.  Always buy a decent white that we can drink with the meal.

I have used this recipe over the past few years and it has been a hit and it is so easy to make even for a large crowd.

Obviously I made this for dinner the other night, it was a bit salty for me, As others suggested I added fresh garlic and mushrooms which made it even better.  I made this with pan cooked green beens and onion and boiled new baby potatoes with butter,garlic and shallotts.

I love this recipe! I've made it a few times and was looking through my recipe box to find a chicken recipe for tonight and came across this :D Thought I'd leave a review.  I too "feel like a total chef" with this :D It goes with just about anything. Be sure to use a wine that you like to drink -- it makes the chicken taste so much better! Also try to throw in fresh garlic cloves.

Needed some tweaks but good basic recipe- use garlic salt instead of regular salt. reduce wine to 1/4 cup, a little fresh rosemary and also add artichoke hearts after wine, but before the broth and simmer for about two minutes, returning chicken to the pan for another minute or until fully cooked (I only lightly browned on both sides during the first step then returned to the pan)

This was really good.  I, too, added mushrooms because I have alot of them lately.  The sauce was probably the best part.  I could make this sauce and throw it over pasta and eat it just like that.  I inadvertenly overcooked my chicken breast.  There is always something going on while I am cooking and I unfortunately left the breasts on for too long.  Certainly not a reflection of this recipe.  Just of my absent mindedness! Thanks for sharing.

I made this last night for dinner, and I can't wait to make it again. The sauce was rich and incredibly delicious. The only change I made was to use all broth, as I had no wine in the house. It was superb.

I loved this recipe!  I used all sherry and water... thickened the sauce at the end with a little flour and added mushrooms with the shallots.  This tasted a lot like Chicken Marsala... Delicious!

Love the flavors of the shallot in the white wine. To make it a bit healthier I only used 1 T of butter with the olive oil. Omitted last 2 T of butter. Spooned out some of the sauce into a small bowl and mixed with a teaspoon of cornstarch and added it back into the mixture.

This was soooo good!!!  I didn't flatten the chicken breasts, and I dredged them in a little AP flour to aid with the browning and for flavor.  They were such a nice looking golden color!! I did add a little bit of cornstarch and water mixture to thicken the sauce.  I will be making this again, it was so easy! I served with 'Sunday Dinner Mashed Potatoes' from this site, and a green bean/mushroom/shallot side.

This was a quick dinner to make and it was good.  I had evrything on hand except for the mushrooms.  I also made two other changes. 1.  I used Veggie Broth instead of chicken. 2. I added the liquid mixture while the chicken was still in the pan for the last 10 minutes.  It was great...oh, yeah, I didn't pound the chicken thin, either, but it was still really good.

Good recipe.  Added a little more white wine just because I like LOTS of sauce.  A lot of flavor.  A nice change for a chicken recipe.  Wonderful!

This was very good.  Cooking the chikcen with the lid on after browning made the meat nice and tender.  I added extra garlic and the juice from one lemon, and it came out very much like a chicken piccata.

Very easy and very good!  Taking others' advice, I doubled the sauce, thickened it a bit with corn starch, and added mushrooms.  Husband couldn't get enough of it.  Knowing that I still have some shallots and leftover chicken broth in the fridge, he asked if we could have it again this week!

Great recipe! My boyfriend and I loved it! I marinated the chicken breasts the night before by rubbing salt, pepper and a bit of sesame salt into it and it tasted great! The other reviewers were right in saying that the sauce was a bit watery, but great tasting nonetheless. Thanks Amy! :)

I followed the other recommendations and doubled the sauce (which I definitely recommend) and added mushrooms.  The recipe overall was OK - probably won't hurry back to make it.  The sauce was tasty over angel hair pasta, but the color of the dish was very bland looking.

Great recipe!  Very easy to make and not many ingredients to use.  Also used chicken bouillon cubes and added fresh mushrooms.  I doubled the sauce and added more garlic like others suggested.  Served over rainbow rotini pasta.  Sauce only thickened after I added cornstarch.  Only thing I was concerned about was the amount of butter used...I'll probably try using margarine next time.

Great for a quick weekday meal! I pounded the chicken flat (as usual) for quick and tender cooking, added mushrooms, and some left over roasted red peppers for extra texture. We loved it and will definately make it again.

Very good. Excellent over rice, and I suspect mashed potatoes would be equally as good. Make sure to reduce it down enough though, and/or add cornstarch/flour--it can be a bit too runny for the rice. I'll certainly make it again!

I almost gave it 3 stars since i had to add a lot more chicken broth to make the sauce edible.  Way too much wine,!  I did add mushrooms which added a lot and added cornstarch.  With more broth, less wine it was delicious!

This was a wonderful recipe I did add 1-4oz can mushrooms.  The left overs were even great.  Thanks for the recipe. I used Pinot Grigio wine.

This recipe is similar to an old family recipe I use.  The picture shows mushrooms, but the recipe doesn't include it.  I highly reccommend more onion/shallot and adding mushrooms.  Serve over wild rice, it's to die for!!!  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very good.  I added some corn starch to thicken it a little more.  Even hubby who doesn't like onions liked this.

I made this for dinner last night and the sauce was delicious - however, when I make this again, I will add a little cornstarch as well. I think that you could make this into a great one-pot dish by browning the chicken in a skillet, and then in the same skillet cooking the shallots and garlic, and when they were done adding about two cups of chicken broth (and the white wine) and one cup of rice, and then covering and cooking until the rice is finished, about 15 min. I am going to try it this way next time. Thank you for a delicious recipe, Amy!

This recipe was excellent! The chicken in itself was okay, but the gravy is what completed it!  I agree with several other reviewers, double up on that gravy and add cornstarch-- as a matter of fact I didn't have shallots so I used green onion instead- wonderful flavor- definitely a keeper!

I loved this.  I used thin-cut chicken breasts and browned them really well.  Served over rice.  Next time I might double the sauce...it's so good!  I did thicken it with a little cornstarch.

I added some Penzeys old world seasoning and sliced mushrooms. If only the sauce was thicker it would have been perfect.

This didn't have enough flavour for us. As chicken is a fairly bland meat it requires a sauce with a more intense flavour. Also the sauce was too thin for our liking. Easy and healthy to make though.

I thought this was going to be a ho-hum recipe, then I read the reviews and thought I’d give it a try. Added some sautéed mushrooms when sauteeing the shallots. It really was delicious. Served it over Yukon gold mashed potatoes, with a side of roasted asparagus. Great weekday meal.

This is a keeper! It pleased everyone in my family and was so easy to make. I doubled the stock and wine, and poached the chicken after I browned. Once it was cooked, I put it under foil while the sauce reduced and thickened. Served over smashed new potatoes with broccolini on the side, there was not a morsel left over.

This recipe was excellent.  The only changes I made were to add a few more shallots and to use a drink-worthy (V.Q.P.R.D. rated) Marsala wine rather than something drier.  The Marsala brings out the shallot flavor quite nicely.  Husband raved about it.  Chicken was organic air chilled and flax-fed thinly cut breasts.  Trying to eat healthier meats.

Loved it due to it's simplicity.  But there's a great depth of flavor. I added halved cherry tomatoes to the sauce with the chicken and shallots.  Served this with couscous and fresh green beans.  My picky family loved this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! I was thinking it needed mushrooms, and was validated when I read the reviews. I didn't have wine on hand, so I used all chicken broth, plus some extra to get some more sauce, you better believe it! I thickened with arrowroot powder, and served with cauliflower rice and asparagus. Lunch is all I can think of this morning!

This is so simple, yet it tastes so great! Really elevates the chicken breast. We didn't have white wine, so we just used all chicken broth. I also doubled the sauce, and then I allowed it to cook down until the shallots were caramelized and the sauce was quite thick. Make sure you pound the chicken breast flat and brown it sufficiently, because that adds to the flavor, both to the chicken itself, but also all those delicious browned bits that get cooked into the sauce.

I pan seared the chicken and took it out of the pan and set it aside.  In the same pan, I cooked the shallots and mushrooms for a few minutes, then added the garlic.  After the garlic was fragrant, I added the wine and reduced, then added chicken broth.  I returned the chicken to the pan and cooked till it was done.  It was delicious and everyone loved it.

I enjoyed this alot. It was simple. I did make a few changes to help with it. I added corn starch as needed to the sauce to help thicken it as I like it that way. Also the suggested amount of sauce does not go a lot way. Make extra! But the taste was awesome and this was super easy to make.

No changes. Took a little longer than said but usually does on first attempt.  Very tasty and sauce was good but we did something wrong as ours never thickened. I think I put to much wine(didn't think possible ) Will make again and follow the directions closely while making the sauce. Sauce still tasted very good

This is fantastic! Quick and easy, and always good. I use more than the one clove of garlic in the recipe (how about six?) but we love garlic! Oven roasted potatoes goes well with this dish. 5 stars all the way!

This was a really tasty recipe and very fast.  I also added mushrooms and served with broccoli and asparagus.  I'll definitely make this again!

The three thin chicken cutlets I used fit perfectly in the chicken fryer pan I have.  After 5 min per side, I removed and added some chopped mushrooms, dried shallots and later some capers. I may have reduced the sauce too much, but I'll know better next time or add more broth. Delicious with mashed potatoes. Thanks for the good recipe!

This turned out delicious! I used salted butter and the sweetness of the sauce mixed with just a hint of salty was so yummy.

Easy to make! I used some fresh mushrooms in it too, and maybe a little extra wine when I over-reduced the sauce. It was wonderful.  Will try it again for company.

We used fresh organic chicken breasts from the coop, salted and seared the chicken breasts, but then turned our gas burner to low, added shallots and 3 cloves of garlic. We cooked this all on low until they shallots were translucent, then added the broth and wine (Chardonay) and continued to simmer on low for 20 minutes. Perfectly tender and delicious served with brown rice.

The only change that I made was to add a little bit of corn starch to the sauce to make it thicker.  This is a great dish to make when you don't have a lot of time.  It was so good there were no left-overs

I only used 2 chicken breasts but kept the sauce the same plus one clove of garlic. I also used a merlot and can't imagine it with using white wine! Very easy, and was a hit!

We love this.  I didn't have shallots and used an onion.  No garlic clove but had some jarred chopped up garlic and used Paul Prudhome vegetable magic on the chicken. Only white wine was Savignon Blanc.  I'm definitely making this again. It was very easy.  It was a last minute "what to make" and a winner.

Doubled the sauce, dredged the chicken in seasoned flour before frying for thickness - used sherry instead of wine and homemade chicken stock - was delicious!  Only gave 4 stars because I changed it a bit.  Printed Nov 21/15.  Nov 26/15 also added fresh mushrooms.

This recipe was really bland.  I made it with rice and added some extra pepper, but I still felt like it was bland and I'm not sure what to add to elevate it.  Maybe more of a cream sauce?

This was delicious. The flavor was great. My chicken did get overcooked though, so I will need to adjust that next time. I also wanted my sauce a little thicker so I sprinkled some flour into the sauce.

Made this last night. I doubled the sauce and added mushrooms. I think without doubling the suace it would have been too dry. I would love to try this with tofu instead of chicken next time. Served with "Ann's rice pilaf" from this site.

This recipe was okay for us.  My husband and I both decided it was missing something but we couldn't decide on what.  I wasn't sure if I should have added more seasoning to the chicken or added something to the sauce.  I won't be making this exact recipe again but I wouldn't mind playing with the ingredients to see what I come up with!

It was ok. The sauce has a lot flavor but very liquidy. It needs,ti be thickened like others said. Hard to brown the chicken nicely without over cooking it because I have pounded the chicken thin as stated.

thank you Amy! I've been trying to find recipies that I can make without using the oven this summer & this one did the trick! It was absolutely delicious. The only thing I did that the recipe didn't call for was to thicken the sauce a little with cornstarch and used skinless thighs (breasts are too dry & tasteless for us). I will be making this a lot! Thanks again for sharing

Very quick and easy. Pairs well with garlic masked potatoes and asparagus. Kids weren't wowed but it was eaten nonetheless. I enjoyed its simplicity, both in taste and in preparation.

I will definitely make this again! I only made three boneless breats instead of four and I don't think there was enough sauce. I am goig to double the sauce ingrediants the next time.

We really liked this recipe.  It was quick and easy.  I wish I had had shallots when I tried it initially but substituted onions instead.  It was delicious.  I will try mushrooms with it next time but it was great without it.  Served it with some steamed yellow squash and zucchini.

We had this last night and it was a hit, and easy too!  I didn’t have shallots, so I used green onions instead.  After removing the chicken to a warm oven, I sautéed the garlic and then added the wine and broth.  I simmered that for about 5 minutes, but it wasn’t thickening, so I used a small amount of a cornstarch/water slurry to help give it some nice body.  As I was adding the slurry, I also added the green onions as they cook very quickly in my opinion.  I also added a few drops of browning sauce to get a richer color.  I added the last of the butter and returned my chicken to the pan and coated it with the sauce.  Very nice!  I’d make it the same way next time!

This is a delicious recipe that takes little time and is easy to prepare.  I forgot the last two tablespoons of butter but I honestly don’t think it needed it.  The sauce was perfect served over the white rice I had made.  Thanks for sharing!

Very  good. We tried this last night. As others have stated, i doubled the liquid to increase the amount of sauce. I think the next time I will return the browned chicken to the pan and cook it in the sauce for a few minutes.

Fabulous!  When my husband keeps complimenting this, I know I have a winner.  And I even forgot to put in the last two tablespoons of butter!  It really doesn't even need it!  Excellent!  A keeper, for sure!  I didn't take a photo because it doesn't get any better than what Naples took!  Yummy!  Thanks, Amy!

This recipe was delicious. After reading other reviews, I dredged chicken in flour seasoned with Montreal chicken seasoning mix before searing. I also seasoned the chicken with it. Added mushrooms and used some flour and water to thicken sauce. A real hit! Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty chicken... Will serve again!  Sauce didn't thicken as described, but worked anyway.  Chicken took at least 5-6 minutes on each side to brown... At med. high heat (gas cooktop).  Cut chicken thin and pounded ... Very tender.

This dish was awesome.  I used onions instead of shallots since that is what I had on hand.  I also used a little extra garlic.  I seasoned the chicken with the salt and pepper and garlic powder. We felt like we were eating an expensive plate in a high end restaurant.

Added mushrooms,used the same amount of sauce liquid but cooked only two chicken breasts. Sauce amount was to our liking. I would cover and cook chicken only 8mins. and check juices,10mins. was a little dry.

Delicious for the simple ingredients, and fast preparation.  This will definitely be one of my "go to" chicken meals for now on.  To save a few calories, I left out the 2 tablespoons of butter at the end, and it still turned out great.  I made a double batch, and I will freeze smaller portions for single dinners.

This recipe was really good. I added some baby spinach to the sauce for color and I don't use wine so I subetituted more broth for it.  I will definitely be making it again.

Awesome dish. I usually just like cooking for people, not actually eating my dishes. However, I loved this! Took me a little longer than anticipated, but the more I make it the faster I'll get. Defiantly recommend this!

Super easy to make and very tasty. I couldn't find shallots, so I substituted onions instead. I diced a few cherry tomatoes and added to the sauce to add thickness and it turned out great. I'll try to add a few mushrooms to the sauce next time. I would recommend this this recipe.

This was great. I also floured the chicken before cooking it and I added mushrooms to the sauce, as other reviewers recommended. I used only chicken broth since we didn't have any wine around, and it still came out great. The sauce was a little runny, and I wanted to add flour to thicken it up as others have suggested but I wasn't sure when to do this, so I didn't. It was still delicious.

I've made this so many times now that it is my go to recipe for chicken. It is excellent as written and is so easy to change for personal tastes/moods. Will be making this again tonight but will double the sauce, add mushrooms with the shallots, and will ensure the sauce is a little bit thick so spoon over the basmati rice that will accompany it! Thank you so much to the submitter ?

This was only ok. The flavor was good, but nothing really special. I doubled the sauce to put over pasta but there was still not enough. Will probably not make again.

Very good recipe!  I pretty much followed the exact recipe, except I added a little more garlic and maybe a tad less butter only because I was done with that stick.  But it turned out beautifully.  It's definitely a keeper.  I think I'll double the sauce because mine reduced down quite a bit.  Maybe I let it sit on the fire too long?  But it was still delicious and I felt like it was a restaurant-worthy recipe!  :)

OMG!  This was so easy and delicious!  I marinated the chicken the night before seasoned with freshed chopped garlic and onion powder.  The next I make it, I will thicken the sauce to make it more gravy-like.  Extremely easy and delish!

I had some shallots and chicken so I searched and found this recipe.  Pretty basic and simple but very healthy and had nice flavor.  After cooking the shallots and garlic I deglazed the pan with sherry since I had no white wine in the house, cooked that down, added some flour then the broth, let that reduce then added about 1/4 C non-fat half n half and had a wonderful sauce for over the chicken.  Good, basic, fast, easy and healthy recipe.  Wished I'd had some mushrooms - would of been great with this.

This was fabulous!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added celery and mushrooms 5 mins before the end. The crunchiness of the celery with the smooth mushrooms provided a new dimension to this recipe. I also thickened the sauce with a bit of cornstarch. I didn't have shallots and substituted a bit of finely chopped yellow onion. I would still consider it a very easy recipe, and good enough to use for a casual dinner party.

I thought the recipe was very good. The real test was my husband. He is not a lover of chicken breast. He did like this because the breast was thin. So I can make it again

At the risk of repeating what others have posted, I too doubled the white wine and chicken broth.  I also added 1 TB of corn starch to the broth which gave the sauce a great consistency.  In an attempt to make this dish more healthy, I only used 1 TB of butter and a little olive oil while sauteeing the the chicken breasts.  I served this with noodles and my husband loved it!!!  Definitely a "keeper" - thanks for sharing Amy!!

When I first tasted the sauce, I felt it was a little bland.  I squeezed some fresh lemon juice in the sauce and that seemed to do the trick.  It was very tasty!

We added 2 pkg. mushrooms to the wine sauce as it was cooking. Also had to add a little thickening to make it a thicker sauce. But would definately make it again.

This was really good! I made it for the 1st time with company coming for dinner and everyone loved it. I made extra sauce (as reveiws suggested) for the rice. Next time I would make even more sauce, it was THAT good :). I love it when guests have thirds and there isn't a morsel left! thanks!

I loved the flavor of this dish, and it was easy.  The only problem I had was there wasn't enough sauce.  I made rice to serve it over, and ended up with dry rice and some clumpy onions, mushrooms and chicken on top.  So the next time i make it, I plan to double the sauce, and really make the chicken thin, so the flavor sinks in more.  Thanks for sharing!

Everyone in my family liked this recipe.  I used some of the suggestions made by other reviewers.  The only problem I found was that it was a little salty.  My son liked the sauce on his potatoes.

This was very good. I added cornstarch like other said, and it was great. Next time I will season the chicken with more than salt and pepper, maybe a little garlic salt.

The sauce was delicious, sweet and unctuous.  I loved it, it was very flavourful.
