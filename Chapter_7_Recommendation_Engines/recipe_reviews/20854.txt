Very easy recipe with simple ingredients.
The fig preserves are tasty, however they
did not "set" and are very runny.
Maybe they are not suppose to, but I prefer
my fig preserves thicker.

Very good!!!  Easy, and just like my mother used to make.  Fig preserves are supposed to be in liquid. So this was just what I wanted. Thanks for sharing.

Having recently bought a house with a large fig tree in the back yard, I was looking for a good recipe that would use a lot of figs at once. (I love to eat the sweet and tender fruit straight from the tree and couldn't keep up with so many coming off each day.)  My neighbor told me that her mother used to make fig preserves with lemon thinly sliced in them, so after making this recipe I gave her a jar of them with a pan of hot biscuits straight from the oven. It was a delight watching this 82-year-old woman literally devour two buttery biscuits filled with these figs. She was so thrilled and said that they tasted exactly like those that her Mother made many years ago.   Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

A good starter recipe. To the people who are taking out the lemon, DON'T! Figs are a low-acid food (ph below 5) and this means that mold and harmful bacteria will likely form UNLESS the fruit mixture has some kind of acid added to it (lemon juice, citric acid). The lemons in this are absolutely necessary, for food safety. If you don't use it, then your beautiful preserves are extremely like to make you sick, or could even kill you. Do not take that risk--ADD THE LEMON JUICE.

It came out very sweet, nothing like store bought stuff, with figs holding their form beautifully.  Next time i'll put more lemon because mine came out sweet with no particular flavor.  Great with yeast pancakes in place of a syrup.

Made these yesterday with only change of using 3 small lemons sliced very thinly.  Hubby just gave me the thumbs up...ate several on some homemade bread.  This recipe yielded 22 one-half pints as written.  This recipe is the real McCoy!!!

I've never made figs before so I didn't know what to expect. The taste of the preserved figs is delicious. So sweet, a great topping to toast. However, I expected the consistency to be like that of jam - nice and thick. The figs were whole, but they sat in an extremely runny sticky syrup. This is still a delicious recipe, but just be warned, that the end result is whole figs in a sweet syrup, not a "set" jam.

Very easy recipie.  I made one batch exactly as the recipie states, but made a second sugar free(diabetic) batch with Xylo (ran out of Xylo had to use a little Splenda).  In the sugar free batch I also added dried ginger chunks, cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves.  Had a great aroma and both recipies turned out great.  The full recipie cooks down and I ended up with 6 pints.

Great recipe! These came out just like I remember my mothers. The figs held there shape and didn't turn to mush, and the syrup was light and thin. I didn't cook quite as long as recipe called for because I don't like the figs to fall apart.

I just discovered I had a fig tree in the house I just bought. Needless to say i was scrambling around to find something to do with these lovely figs. I am so happy I found this recipe. It was so delicious! Easy and my parents loved them.

I see where someone correctly stated that the removal of the lemons is a safety issue.  They are indeed correct!  If the lemons offend you there is another option.  Add the juice of two lemons or one teaspoon of citric acid to lower the ph of the batch.  This will prevent the growth of most bacteria, yeast and other organisms.  There is yet a third alternative.  You could can using a three hour process.  Follow the above directions, omit the lemons if you please and the fill jars and apply caps and bands.  Then process for three hours at pressure.  Essentially follow the process directions for green beans.  Warning, the figs will macerate into a goo and lose the color but the result will taste much the same.
I am a food science instructor.  I warn you, do not alter food preservation techniques.  Use the tried and tested.  it will save you toilet tissue, insurance co-pay and much bathroom trouble.

This is a recipe my family loves.  It's quick & easy.  No need to alter this recipe.  Not only does it taste great with toast & butter, you can add a scoop to plain yogurt. Yum!

I tried the recipe using frozen figs and added the baking soda to the other ingredients.  I assume this recipe is for fresh figs.   The end result looks and tastes good but a little thinner texture than I'm used to.

Not quite the one I did as a teen. The one I did I had to put the figs in a shallow pan (after cooking), cook the syrup down and then pour the syrup over them and let it "sit" overnight. The next morning, I heated the pan just enough to get them hot enough to work with, then put them in the jars. No processing necessary.

This is the perfect recpie for old-fashioned fig preserves.  I chose this recipe over anothr with spices because I wanted a purer flavor.   The balance of flavors is perfect.  The amber color is beautiful.  I wouldn't change a thing.

I thought this was delicious but takes a little getting used to. I like the lemon flavor but not the lemon slices in my preserves so I push them aside when I'm enjoying this on toast or biscuits.

Great recipe.  If you have time to soak the figs longer, they will plump up nicely.   I added ground cloves, nutmeg & cinn.  Also used a lime, insted of lemon.
Will be making this again n again!

Thank you Dotti K for this recipe. This recipe is easy to follow. I did some research and found that you can chop up the figs before you the cooking process, I quartered the large ones and halved the small ones. The taste is sweet and fruity. This would go great on pound cake, baked brie and pancakes. I would change the name of the recipe to "figs in syrup" since it is not a preserve or jam style recipe.

I've used this recipe at least twice and it's delish! Just the right texture & nice thick consistency. I alter the recipe to add 4 tsp of vanilla for the 64 servings and its my biggest requested preserve!

Excellent.  I cut the recipe in half, but still used a whole lemon, and added a tiny amount of cinnamon.  These figs are just wonderful with a plate of artisanal cheeses, roasted nuts, crusty baguette and olives.  Yum!

Love it!  It’s really easy. Costco carried Fig Jam at one time and we fell in love with it.  And after a run they discontinued it.  I had no  idea it was so easy to make, so when figs are in season I make fig jam

This is the best recipe I've found for Fig Preserves like my Mimi and MaMaw used to make when I was little! I sometimes leave the lemon out. The figs come out sweet and plump!

I added 1 teaspoon of powdered ginger. Cooked 1 1/2 hrs and added two mandolin sliced thin lemons. Very nice recipe. They look delicious. And they aced all the taste tests along the way!
