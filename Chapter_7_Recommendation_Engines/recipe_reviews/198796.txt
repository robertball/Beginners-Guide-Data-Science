It's not too tough to "diet" when you prepare meals like this!  While hubs ate his over rice and I ate mine over chopped lettuce, both of us were pleased with this simple but flavorful, healthy dish.  However, after trying it, he pushed the avocado to the side of his plate, remarking that "it didn't belong there." And, while I thought it was okay, I still have to agree with him and in hindsight would leave it out.  I did measure the soy sauce/broth mixture, but the remaining ingredients I just played by ear to suit my tastes, probably using more chicken and mushrooms than called for and less avocado and green onion.  I actually liked that the meat was not marinaded before cooking, as sometimes the seasoning can be overwhelming. The seasonings that were combined in advance and added at the end were just right - understated, simple, but still plenty flavorful.

I made this for dinner for the first time tonight, and have to say it was delicious!  The only thing I changed was to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil because it is healthier, and used low sodium soy sauce instead of regular soy sauce.  It was different, but not in a bad way at all!  I am really glad I used the low sodium soy sauce though, because it would have been too salty otherwise!  The low sodium soy gave it just enough flavor, and the flavors of the veggies, chicken, and sauce all blended perfectly.  If I change anything at all next time, it might be to add a tad more garlic.  My husband is an avid avocado and mushroom fan, so I thought I couldn't go wrong with this one.  I was right!  He loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!  It will be a repeat for us!

Tasty stuff and easy to make. I changed it a little:

For the SAUCE I used 2 tbsp FLOUR instead of cornstarch. Doubled up the garlic, added an equal amount of fresh minced ginger and mixed the sauce in a mini-blender. 

I used a couple types of mushrooms, added cashews, carrots and eggplant. Unfortunately my avocados were too soft to add so I used them in a salad. Will definitely make this again soon with some firm avocados!

I love it! The flavor was great, and I would have never thought to add avocados to a stir fry! Next time I would customize it with adding some carrots for more crunch and color. It was really green with the snow peas and avocados. I also had it on a bed of rice. Great recipe!

This stir-fry is unique and delicious!  The avocado has a mild, earthy flavor that complements the chicken well.  If you like heat, try a dash of crushed red pepper.

This is a fabulous recipe and a great one even for kids.  My whole family really likes this healthy meal and it will now become a regular in our rotation of meals.  The avocado makes it!

the flavor was really good. i used broccoli instead of snow peas and it came out good but my only problem was that the broccoli soaked up all the juice so my advice is to double the sauce if cooking with a different veggie.

This was delicious! I left out the mushrooms and used only 1 bunch of onions, since that's all I had on hand. Just before serving, I tossed with Chuka Soba noodles. Fabulous!

This was soooo good!! The only thing that I did different was I made a little bit more sauce, which I thought made everything better with the rice. I also added an extra avacado and a red pepper to give it more color. This recipe is something I will make over and over again. I told everyone that I made "MYOTO". (Make Your Own Take Out) So yummy!!!

This was delicious!  The entire family loved it.  I used baby portobello mushrooms instead of crimini, and added a couple of red bell peppers.  Even my husband loved it who claims to hate Asian food!  I will be cooking this again for sure!

Randomly found this recipe as a way to "tease" my father with his dislike to chicken... Oh my gosh this dish is amazing!! Even if you dnt like something in it it works amazing! I used regular sweet peas and broccoli instead of snow peas and oh lord was it delicious! Never had avacado like this unless it's guacamole or sliced.

Personally i thought this was a bazzar combination when my hubby read out the ingredients but my hubby insisted on making it. We wont be making it again. The Green onions over powered the other flavors.

Nice combination of vegetables. Tasty, but too salty for my tastes. Next time I'll either use low sodium soy sauce or cut down on the total soy sauce.

It was ok, Although we do think we will need to change the recipe a little bit to be a better match for what we like to eat. The avocados where very good in this though!

Great recipe, next time I'll make it I'll use a little less soy sauce though, because it was a little overwhelming, and will add some salt/pepper instead. Adding some carrots/red peppers for color and taste like others proposed sounds like a good idea too.

This is a nice recipe.  After reading some of the reviews, I stole various ideas:  I marinated the chicken beforehand in the chicken broth, soy sauce, a lot more garlic, red pepper flakes, and some cinnamon and clove (just a tad--gives it a little 5-spice flavor, minus three-lol), and just a bit of sesame oil, then added the corn starch to what was left once I drained the chicken and cooked it.  Another idea from a reviewer was to add some red bell pepper.  Great!  I also cut the chicken portion in half.  One breast per person is simply too much with all the vegetables and the rice.  I would definitely make this again.  Oh, and the avocado was genius.

I followed the recipe exactly but omitted chicken broth because I didn't have homemade broth at hand and I don't like using premade kinds: too much MSG. I replaced the 1/2 cup of broth with water and kept the chicken's juices after cooking it. This recipe was a wonderful surprise, tasted better than I thought. And whoever says avocado doesn't belong there is dead wrong!

Loved it.  It's different in a good way.  I enjoy how the avocado balances with the flavor of the chicken and the crispness of the vegetables.  Unique and delicious.

Really easy to follow.  I substituted the snow peas for sliced zucchini and used regular table wine instead of the Chinese cooking wine (only because I had trouble finding it at my local market).

Hubby and I loved the different flavours to this stir fry, but next time I'll cut back on the soya sauce (too salty for us).  The photo also showed what looked like cashews to me so I added those and they really tied all the other flavours together - I'll add them again.

We thought this was too salty and I used low sodium soy. May make again and use less. Carrots, broccoli and red peppers would all work.

Thought this sounded good, but tried it using regular onion and the flavors are just not good together.  Will not be making it again.  I personally could not eat it, but my husband will eat anything even if he didn't. He votes no.

Honestly it might be a little too plain for the tastes of my family but for me it was OK. For veggies I just used mushrooms, green onions, and carrots. The veggies had great flavor. But the chicken didn't really absorb up any flavor so if you don't pair the chicken with the veggies at the same time it can be really bland. I think maybe next time I'll make a little extra sauce and cook it with the chicken as well as adding it at the end. The avocados are a great idea - they don't add too much taste (maybe a little earthy taste) but they make an interesting texture in each bite that you have.

I used a frozen bag of stir fry veggies instead of fresh. Otherwise, I followed the rest of the directions and this turned out delicious! We served on tortillas with a sprinkle of cheese. Yum!

This was REALLY good. I hesitated before I added the avocado, based on other reviews but I'm so glad I put it in. It was so delicious in there and even warmed up the next day was good (I was afraid it would make it mushy). I prepared this exactly as stated and my husband gave it a thumbs up!

I thought this recipe was pretty good!  I really liked the avocado in the stir fry.....didn't give it five stars because the hubby didn't love it.

I made this to recipe (minus the avocados) and found the sauce to be very bland. I added several things to try to get some flavor into it (Chinese 5-spice, a dab of sesame oil, some oyster sauce) which improved it a bit, but I still don't think I will try it again.

This was really good and the texture was just like chinese food, until I added the avocado. I have no idea why, but it made it all watery. Weird. It was still really good. I'd even consider ditching the chicken and just eating it vegetarian.

This was very easy to make, though it was a bit on the salty side and not bursting with flavor. Still, it felt like I was eating healthy chinese take-out. Maybe reducing the soy sauce and adding something sweet would help?

I used chicken thighs and marinated in the soy sauce/broth mixture.  Before I stir-fry the chicken, I drained it from the marinade.

this was really good! i doubled the sauce, which was perfect because i served mine with jasmine rice. i also added cashews to the dish, which i will continue to do. next time i make this, i may add more garlic and some spice. overall, very good and will definitely be making it again!!

This dish was really good! I am a big fan of stir frys and this one was super easy and very tasty. It should be on top of rice, as every stir fry should beacause on it's own its not very filling. The only thing I did different was I only used 1 bunch of green onions ins tead of the recommened 4. Next time I make it I think I will make more sauce as well. =)

I subbed broccoli and edamame for the mushrooms and snap peas. It was good but no one was too enthused about the leftovers.

My daughter the fussy eater loved this. I’d call this a basic stir-fry and very kid friendly. Not fancy or super flavorful, but delicious nonetheless. Use good, fresh veggies for best flavor. This sauce won’t mask bland ingredients

I am usually not a huge fan of stir-fry's with them always looking better than they taste but this one was really nice.
