Never used sugar in green beans but it was nice.  I was leary and just added 1 tablespoon.  I always brown cook the bacon in the pot before adding the beans removing some grease.  But I think you have something with the sugar!

I loved it and it was so easy.  I always thought that green beans from the garden would be a lot of work and was very pleasantly surprised.  The sugar seemed fine, actually we never noticed it at all.  Super simple and delicious.

Sounds just like how my mom and grandmothers made their green beans.
