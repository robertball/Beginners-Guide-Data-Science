This recipe has too many ingredients, is too over powering with the spices an is too sweet. I'm afraid that I wont be making this again.

I made numerous adjustments to this recipes. 

Here is what I adjusted:

ColeSlaw:

3/4 cup mayo;
2 tablespoons of lemon juice;
2 - 3 tablespoons of red wine vinegar;
Everything else was the same.  My husband did not like the pepperoncini peppers in the coleslaw.

Pulled Pork:

2 teaspoons of kosher salt;
2 teaspoons of black pepper;
2 teaspoons of granulated garlic;
2 teaspoons of granulated onion;
1 teaspoons of cayenne pepper;
1 teaspoon of allspice;
16 ozs. of apple juice;

I cooked the pork in the crockpot for 8 hours.  Every other measurement of other spices remained the same. 

Sauce:  
Followed the recipe for the sauce adding some of the apple juice/meat juices to the sauce.

The dinner turned out awesome.  I have cooked enough to know that amount of spices written in this recipe would have been overwhelming.
