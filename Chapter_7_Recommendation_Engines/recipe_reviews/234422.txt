I made this for Recipe Group. I tweaked it a bit - I know I shouldn't, but I did - due to what I had on hand. My first tweak was to use some garlic butter that I had in my fridge that needed to be used.  I nearly bought tomato yesterday, but remembered I had some at home - yellow cherries I was going to quarter. Well, I'm not sure what happened to those tomatoes, but they're not in my fridge! So I rummaged around in my pantry and found diced tomatoes with green chilies. I did add another tbsp of diced green chilies, because I had already opened my can - and it didn't look like there was much in the tomatoes. I did not want to buy a bag of tortilla chips to use 1/4 c. I had just bought some Pringles Tortillas-Southwestern Ranch - so I used those. I did use a little extra, simply because 1/4 didn't seem like enough for 6 eggs. I also used extra [colby jack] cheese. I used up a bag, not bothering to measure. My final tweak was to use my favorite corn & whole wheat blend tortillas, warming them on my burner - I prefer the taste of tortillas on the burner to tortillas in the microwave.... These were yummy, and received high praise from my company (=

I used one whole tomato and I sauteed a little fresh minced onion and garlic in the butter before adding the green chilies. Oh my goodness. This was SO good. The kids really enjoyed it, too. NO leftovers.

Pretty hearty breakfast, and very quick and easy. I added in some minced onion after reading the previous review, a great addition. I didn't really care for the crushed tortillas, but my husband liked them.

Excellent recipe for a Tex-Mex breakfast.   I added in some diced onions and omitted the chips, because I didn't have any on hand.   A definite keeper.   Thanks!

Yum, I made these Christmas morning and everyone loved them. I use recipes like this to clean out the fridge. I sauteed onion, garlic, bell pepper, and jalapeno for a few minutes and then threw in some leftover ham (didn't have canned chilies or a tomato). Added an avocado on top.

loved it, especially with added onion and the technique of letting the eggs sit at the side of the pan to finish cooking and melt the cheese.  this kept the chips from getting too soggy which has been my problem with making migas in the past.  pretty close to the Cisco's version (our favorite Tex Mex in Austin).

9.30.19 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/234422/tex-mex-migas/ ... Minimal changes - added a half cup onion & subbed a cup of fireroasted tomatoes.  I'd like be more authentic with corn tortillas, but this was good as listed.  It has the consistency of ricotta cheese, which is kind of odd; but I got over it.  :D  'Looked just like the photos.  :o  S liked; had two.

Love that this is a simple, basic recipe that can be changed up to suit the people eating. I made the recipe for a work potluck and brought pico, black beans, sour cream, cilantro and hot sauce so everyone could fix â€˜em how they wanted. I brought very little of anything home!

Generally good migas: I think the taco sauce is needed. I might add ham or chorizo to it in the future. Putting it on a corn tortilla is a flourish and is really not needed.

My rating is based on the recipe as written. I have made this 3 times now and I always felt like there is something missing.  The first time I made it, I made it exactly as written. It was okay, but nothing special. The second time I made it I added scallions, black pepper and ham. It was pretty tasty. Then I made it again this morning with left over Carne Asada that I made on the grill yesterday, sweet onions, grilled (Mild)Pablano peppers and pepper jack cheese as well as the other ingredients listed.  It was over the top! Thank you Xoana for a good basic recipe!

Excellent.  Just make sure the "taco sauce" is decent salsa, & not something from Taco Bell.  Besides that suggestion,  this is the best migas on allrecipes.

We really enjoyed this recipe! I substituted the green chile with chipotle chile, and the flavor was wonderful! The only thing I will change next time is adding the tortilla chips a little later so they keep more of their crunch for added texture. Thanks so much for this recipe!

Recipe Group Selection:  11, January 2014 ~ Love to fix fast, filling breakfast items.  We enjoyed this breakfast, but weren't crazy with the added crunch of the crushed tortilla chips.  I know I will make these again, but probably without the added chips.

Made this for Recipe Group...Delicious! I didn't want the chips to get soggy, so I crushed them on top after I put the eggs on the tortilla, and I'm glad that I did b/c it gave this a nice salty/crunchy texture that I really enjoyed. Also I didn't cook the tomatoes, just put them on top before adding the taco sauce. Great flavor and so simple...a definite keeper for a quick, yummy breakfast (or dinner, lol)! Thanks for sharing. :)
