Florida has some good resources! ( see submitter's note). Thanks Karissa and daughter. We really enjoyed this summer time smoothie! We left out the sugar and it was still yummy.

I used 1 cup mango and 1 banana that  were frozen so I omitted the ice. I used Splenda instead of sugar and I used Silk coconut milk instead of canned.  I made the mistake of adding 1 cup of coconut milk instead of 1/2 cup so I omitted the water. The lime zest sets of the flavors making it a very pleasant smoothie.

1c - 1.25 c of coconut water frozen into ice cubes can replace the milk/water/ice in this. For those who keep coconut water in stock (or just don't like coco milk), from a former bartender :)

Very good basic smoothie, but as being a native Floridian myself, I would suggest to change it up a bit. I added 1/2 cup of vanilla rice milk, frozen tropical smoothie mix (pineapple, mango, and strawberry), 2 frozen bananas, frozen coconut shavings, a dash of cinnamon, 1/2 cup of vanilla coconut milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract. Perfect summer smoothie to make for you and friends. :-)

Didn't need extra sugar.  Substituted orange juice and coconut milk for water.  Added vanilla whey protein and a bit of ginger - delicious! I will make it again!
