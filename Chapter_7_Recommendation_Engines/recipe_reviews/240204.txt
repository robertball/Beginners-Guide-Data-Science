My husband loves roasted brussel sprouts with the onions and balsamic vinegar.  I use this recipe with the sprouts cut in half lengthwise rather than whole.  I use whatever onions I have on hand but the red onion called for in the recipe is best.   I do not use the shallot or fresh rosemary because I never have those on hand.  Because I'm lazy, I mix everything together in a large bowl including all the oil and balsamic vinegar plus seasonings -- I use dried Italian seasoning in place of the fresh rosemary.  I also add a little bit cayenne pepper to for a little bit more spice to the flavor (less than a 1/4 teaspoon or to taste).  I do not cook the balsamic on the stovetop at all -- too many extra steps for me.  I put everything on a greased sheet pan and roast for 30 minutes, stir and roast an additional 15-30 minutes because my husband loves them slightly charred.  They turn out great and my husband devours them.  Every once in a while I add crumbled bacon.

I use this recipe often.  When I'm in a hurry I add the balsamic to the onion/sprouts before cooking.   I've added garlic, chili peppers from the garden and on occasion sea salt.   Love roasted sprouts!

These were delicious.  I cut my sprouts in slices so I pulled them out of the oven 8 minutes early because they were done.  I skipped the onion and added a clove of garlic chips instead...yum!  I also didn't have shalots so I just heated up the balsamic and poured it over with just a bit of thyme.  My family gave me rave reviews!  I will definitely make them again.

This is an excellent recipe for a roasted vegetable.  I did make a some changes. I used four strips of crumbled bacon, omitted the onions and shallots, and added an eighth cup of maple syrup. Very, very tasty!

This is by far the best way to prepare brussel sprouts.  I only use a 1/2 lb or brussel sprouts - and the recipe turned out great.  I used real aged balsamic vinegar - so didn't have to thicken it and cut down the amount to 2 tablespoons with some sea salt, man you are talking about GOOD .

I followed this recipe to the letter and it came out a burned mess! Thinly sliced onions coated with olive oil at 425 degrees for 20 minutes equals burnt!  The smoke alarm two rooms away went off at 10 minutes. I will try again at a lower temp and less time. Has potential but the temp and time are way off.

Great recipe. I added a tiny bit of honey to the reduction. My little guy kept asking for more. Definitely a winner.

I didn't use the onions and I had to cook the sprouts in a pan on the stove top because the oven was in use. The flavored were awesome though! It went perfect with the balsamic glazed salmon my wife made.

Yummy!!  This will be my roasted Brussel to go to recipe, loved the addition of the red onion, which comes out sweet after roasting, and the balsamic glaze added a big oomph!
However, I didn't have rosemary on hand, but they came out delicious anyways.
I roasted at 425 for 30 min per recipe, but continued on 450 for another 30 min, we like them crispy.  I kept mixing them every 10 min or so, so they will not burn at the bottom of the dish, and they came out nice and even.    My daughter added some shredded cheese to hers and she loved it, melted right away.

This got mixed reviews from my family.  DD didn't think the flavor of the onion blended well with the sprouts.  SIL thought it was just okay.  I liked it but not as much as I expected.  All the flavors are pretty bold.  I used white balsamic vinegar to avoid a muddy appearance.  I think I would make it again but tweak a bit.  Thanks lazy Barb for a new way to cook Brussels sprouts.

I had tried to just wing it when making brussel sprouts before I found this recipe and I had failed miserably....then I found this recipe.  I didn’t have any shallots or rosemary and only used the red onion and it turned out fantastic!  Everyone loved it so I know I will have to make them again soon.  I will try the shallots and rosemary the next time but they were excellent without them anyway.

My husband and I really like this recipe. The first time we made it the onions were overcooked. The second time we made it we added the onions half way through the cook time. The reduction is delicious. I used to hate Brussels sprouts but I love them cooked this way. Thinking of having this as a side at Thanksgiving.

Very tasty! My kids loved this recipe. I did add some fresh garlic to it because I thought it needed a little something extra. I couldn't take a picture because the kids were digging into them before I even thought of a photo.

Absolutely delicious!  Mine were done in 25 minutes.  I didn't have rosemary, but they still tasted amazing.  5 minutes isn't really long enough to make a balsamic reduction.  I had mine over the heat for roughly 15 minutes.  It didn't fully incorporate (the olive oil still separated), but it was long enough to let the flavors blend.  This is really something special.

Made this last night and everyone loved it.  The only very small change was to cut the Brussels sprouts into halves and add a few cloves of chopped garlic. There were no leftovers.  Will definitely make again.

This looked like an interesting twist to the traditional roasted Brussel sprouts drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with salt and pepper which my family loves. The onion and balsamic vinegar along with the rosemary provides a wonderful blend to the flavor of the Brussels. I will definitely be repeating this recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Going to be making this every week from now on. I omitted the shallots (not a fan) and added a few cloves of minced garlic for them to roast with. Like several other reviewers mentioned, I recommend cutting the sprouts in half length wise before tossing in oil, they roast and brown very evenly this way. Thanks for the great recipe!

Delish!  But I did some modifications.  No shallots, onions or rosemary, but added some real maple syrup, raisins, sunflower seeds and pecorino romano grated cheese.  To die for!

I did cut back on the oil for the glaze and roasted the vegetables a little longer than call for.  About 10-15 minutes.  Excellent.

We were looking for an alternative to steaming and found this.  It was really good.  We thought we'd put some halved cherry tomatoes about halfway through the cooking time.

Fabulous side dish!  I substituted scallions for the onion and also added butternut squash (cut in small cubes). My kids loved it which is hard to believe.

We don't care for rosemary, and left it out, and the dish became our favorite vegetable side dish!  The balsamic vinegar makes the sprouts pop with flavor!   We eat this dish almost weekly, and love it more each time.

It was very good, but ended up having far too much balsamic vinegar. Need to really reduce by simmering.

I changed this up a bit.  I left out shallots and rosemary.  I added a couple squirts of lemon and a teaspoon and a half of fresh ground garlic and I added walnuts and craisins.  Delish!!

We really enjoyed this brussel sprout recipe with the onion and shallot combo, but found the balsamic flavor a bit overpowering.  (could have just been the brand I used)

I made this for my husband and me and we have mixed reviews.  I made it according to the recipe and I thought the rosemary was very overpowering.  On the other hand, my husband thought these sprouts were quite tasty.  He gave a 4 star and me a 2.  I will definitely make again, but will cut wayyyyy back on the rosemary or use thyme in it's place.  Thank you for the share lazybarb.
