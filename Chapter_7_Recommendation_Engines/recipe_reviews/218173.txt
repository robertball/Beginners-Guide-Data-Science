I'd give this 3 stars for the egg rolls and 5 stars for the peanut sauce, so I'm rating this a 4.  I was so concerned about the egg rolls coming apart if I added too much filling, and as a result, I didn't fill them enough (that's my fault).  But overall, the egg rolls lacked flavor and need some serious tweaking.  If I were to make these again, I certainly would add some chopped shrimp or cooked ground pork, maybe some chopped peanuts, or some oyster sauce, just something to ramp up the flavor??  The peanut sauce was outstanding, and I definitely will be using that in the future.  Overall,  preparation was pretty labor intensive with a real mess to clean up in the kitchen, and I'm not sure that the final result was worth it.
