Pretty good, with a few changes to add flavor.  I added 2 cloves of garlic, 2 tbsp of sugar, and about 1/4 cup of rice vinegar.  I also doubled the amount of cayenne pepper in total, substituted scallions for cilantro.  Next time I may add some ginger, too.  Goes great accompanied with a hot stir fry.

We have this at least once a month.  It's so easy to play around with...adding as you please.  I always add in stir-fried chicken and what ever veggies I have stir-fried along side like cabbage and cauliflower.  Just toss it all together and season.  I usually toss the noodles with garlic oil (garlic crushed with a motar and pestel and fried in oil till golden) before I add other ingredients.  My hubby is not a fan of sesame oil, so I leave that out.  Use your imagination with this.  Thanks Ashley.

Sorry didn't care for this at all and will never make again. It was spicy but that is all. The flavors never seemed to meld together even overnight.

This did start out as a bland pasta dish. I added feta cheese and it perked up and was great! Definately will be on my favorite list.

We liked this in our house. I used short curly noodles instead of speghetti and it was much easier to eat.

The dish is very simple and tasty, and can be customized with anything you have on-hand for variety.  I used the above recipe, and added a little extra soy sauce, some halved grape tomatoes, and some sliced green onions, and I squeezed in a lime for a little extra flavor.

I found it to be quite bland. I added a few extra dashes of soy sauce than what it said in the recipe and it was still tasteless.

A little bland. I used rice noodles instead of spaghetti to make it a little more authentic asian, and tried adding more cayenne pepper to add more flavor, but it just made my mouth burn without adding any flavor.

We like this okay; a little oily. I have recently had problems with cilantro in digestion, so have stopped using this for now.

Not bad. I used a bit more cayenne pepper than stated, and also added some sesame seeds. I would recommend chopping the peppers; I think it would be easier to eat. :) Very quick and simple, thanks.

I enjoyed the aspect of the heat of the cayenne pepper and cilantro with the chilled pasta, but the dish as a whole I found a bit bland in terms of flavor. Perhaps experimenting with different vegetables would yield a more desirable outcome. Also, quite simple to prepare!

As written this was okay but a bit bland and needed more flavor. I did add a tablespoon of low sodium soy, and tablespoon of rice vinegar, some sesame seeds and few shakes of garlic and onion powder, much more flavor. I also added some green onions along with the red bell and cilantro since my garden is full of them right now. A nice tasting Asian pasta salad. Went very well with Half Time Hoisin Chicken Wings on this website.

This was a terrific pasta recipe.  Recipes for me are usually, if not always suggestions, (that's why I cook and don't bake-too may rules).  I used zita regati pasta since that is what I had.  I added a pinch of Himalayan salt, a few grape tomatoes, a tbl. of pinenuts , saute lightly in olive oil until slightly brown, and a shake of parsley.  Mixed and refrigerated as directed. YUM

I'm sorry but this is pretty boring. I added a lot more soy sauce than called for but it didn't help much. It was easy enough but really ened some additional flavor.
