I use this on french toast and pancakes if I have run out of maple syrup. I just sprinkle the sugar on top and pour some coffee over the sugar. It is really good.

It's very simple and good. I tried on a homemade biscuit and used a spiced coffee I was drinking. Will try with crepes.

Thank you for this recipe, its genius!
For you tea lovers like myself:
 I made this in a mug to pour over waffles...I boiled some water and placed an apple cider tea bag in the mug with brown sugar and just poured enough water in to make the syrup, stirred, then let it steep for a few minutes. Ended up with apple spice flavored syrup!
