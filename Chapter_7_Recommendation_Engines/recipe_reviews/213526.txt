My famliy LOVED this dish!!!  The cheese sauce was definitly a fun add in. It isn't very spicey or anything, I didn't think it had a ton of flavor, but it was still kinda good, the men in the family seemed to really like it. I didn't eat my fajita with just the cheese sauce and chicken so I guess I can't say to much about it.  I of course added my own touches for our preferences when I was cooking the chicken. I put in cumin, cilantro and garlic because I was worried about the zingy tangy vinagary flavor of Italian dressing. It was really really good though!!! I also sliced up red and green peppers and an onion. I didn't put in green onion because it isn't a favorite of mine. For whatever reason the grocery store was out of guacamole, so I skipped on the avacado idea all together.  We also had sour cream and salsa for people to add on.   My husband said this recipe is a keeper. He usually prefers steak fajitas, but he really enjoyed this version. Also I loved how easy this was. Throw your sliced up chicken and salad dressing in a bag let it marinate for a while, slice up your veggies and throw it into a skillet season a little and that is about it.

When my husband asked what was for dinner I told him chicken fajitas but then immediately started to try to describe the dish without the word "fajitas."  That should have been my first clue.  OMG.  Cheese sauce in a fajita.  That's just wrong.
