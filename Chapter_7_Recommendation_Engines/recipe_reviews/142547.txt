This is actually very good.  It's too bad someone had to rate it on what they thought it might taste like.  

I'm not a big instant tea drinker - but I liked this.  

It's very much along the lines of those iced latte-type drinks.

Try it with a chopped up apple instead of the juice and a fresh banana. I omitted the tea and added 1/2 of vanilla yogurt, 1 cup of frozen blueberries and 1 tbls. of flaxseed meal for health reasons and flavor.

I thought it was delicious and refreshing.  Teenager thought it needed a tablespoon of sugar.  I wouldn't change a thing though!

I improvised with what I had. No apple juice, instant peach tea, 2 cups blueberries, 1 banana, 3 scoops low fat vanilla ice cream. It was wonderful made this way.

Not too crazy about this combination.  I had to add quite a bit more apple juice in order for it to blend.  I won't be making it again.

This was very strange. I didn't care for the sour and tangy taste of the iced tea powder and lemon juice. Won't make this again.

I exchanged a fresh banana and fresh blueberries for frozen version, added 1 cup of ice, 5 ounces of Greek yogurt, finished with 1 tablespoon of strawberry preserves for a sweeter taste...Delightful! I know the yogurt and preserves added calories but this smoothie was FABULOUS! ??

This turned out well. I made it exactly as the recipe described. I think it would have been just as nice without the iced tea powder though.
I also agree with another rater that it was silly for someone to rate it so low based on what they thought it would turn out like. I also think it's strange to change the recipe so much that it's a completely different recipe and then only give it three stars.

To be honest, it doesn't sound all that good. But I will make it and try it. I'll try anything once =]
