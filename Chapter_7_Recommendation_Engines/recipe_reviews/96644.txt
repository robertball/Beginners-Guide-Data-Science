Very tasty.  I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I substituted 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/8 tsp ground ginger and 1/16 tsp each nutmeg and ground cloves.  I omitted ground orange peel.

I used Captain Morgan's spiced rum in mine---very yummy.  Also, the kids enjoyed the mix made with hot water only.

Very, Very good.  Prefer this over the overly heavy ice cream types.  Doubled the spices and orange peel, with great success too.

Made a plastic container of this. Keep it in my fridge for instant hot buttered rums. SO GOOD! Perfect for Minnesota evenings. Thanks! Time to replenish.

This was wonderful.  I didn't expect much without the ice cream, but what an after dinner treat it was.  I didn't have any oranges, so I left out the orange peel.  Very easy and worth it.  I used vanilla rum to add the extra kick.

Love the orange peel in this recipe. I added a heaping tablespoon of vanilla ice cream and it is now perfection in a cup.  Cheers!

I just made this and it's lovely. I didn't add the orange peel, so I think I will definitely do that next time. I also didn't have any rum, but it's pretty delicious by itself. :]

Excellent recipe!  I was thrilled to find this as an alternative to the "add ice cream" recipes. I didn't have orange peel and used a couple drops of orange extract instead--worked perfecly--or so says my husband (self proclaimed Hot Buttered Rum Expert)!  Yummy--thanks!

Great to take camping. Big hit around the campfire on those cool mornings and evenings. Orange peel makes it great.

As others have mentioned, adding more spice (1 tsp)made a huge difference. LOVED it! Fantastic with fresh grated nutmeg on top. Will be keeping this in the fridge for the holidays.

Finally a hot butttered rum mix recipe made without ice cream! This was really tasty and I liked the addition of the orange zest. We served this delicious drink with some Italian ammareti cookies. Me and my brother made it with hot coffee and my mom made it with rum and boiling water. Thanks for the great recipe!

We made it vegan and it tastes amazing! We substituted earth balance butter for the regular butter! This will be a recipe that we will be repeating over and over again!

The recipe doesn't say  how much rum and water to use.  Last year I made something similar with cider instead of water and it was delish!

warm and cosey. I didn't have orange peels so I added orange and vanilla extract. I like milk in my drinks so I added a little of that too but the drink was good before it was added :)

Yum.  Very warming and relaxing.  I used dried orange peel and it was fine. Pumpkin Pie spice really varies so I left it out of my first batch and experimented with the first cup.  I actually prefer just nutmeg and thought cinnamon took over.  The spice mix would definitely be personal taste.  I divided the butter brown sugar mix onto wax paper and got 12 instead of 10 so I must have not rounded my tablespoons as much.  This still tasted great in a full size mug.  I may try a small amount of leftover commercial eggnog in my next cup.

Would not change a thing.  Hubby's on his second as we speak.  It's snowing right now and where we live that is very rare...last time was February 2001.  Perfect time to try this recipe out and very glad I did...will be my go-to for the holidays from now on.  Thanks Spicegirl!

Very smooth. Made with water and with coffee and Spiced Tea. The water recipe wasn't well received, but when mixed with coffee and tea, it was a hit.

I loved it! Years ago I had this in the mountains at a Lake Tahoe bar. It is great on the cold Nebraska nights. Thanks for sharing.
