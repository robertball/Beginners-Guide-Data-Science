excellent salad, an alternative is to use a can of diced tomatoes with oregano and garlic, putting the juice from the can in as well.  You can use less oily dressingthis way, and the juice gives the pasta a great flavor.  Also omit or cut down on the fresh tomatoes if using canned.

Spaghetti salad was good, I did change a few things, first I only used 8 oz of spaghetti (I didn't think my family would it eat and I was making it for me) and I used 16 tablespoons of light salad dressing. Whole dish came out to 24 w.w. points I divided that into 6 servings making it 4 points a serving. My family ended up eating it and I'll make it again.

This is a great recipe. I too have a variation we use an entire bottle of salad supreme seasoning, cucumbers and the best part is pepperoni for a kick.  Everyone loves this :)

This is especially great for summer, because you can make a large one, and keep it in the fridge for a few days. I thaw cooked frozen, peeled shrimp and add it to make a great summer meal. Everyone loves it!

This was tasty. I did add some red bell, cucumber, and mushrooms so I could call it a starch and veggie ;) I used cocktail onions cut up because I have a jar that needs to be used. Tasty and easy!!

I added pepperoni, some celery, cubes of cheddar, and deseeded cucumber. Left out the sesame seeds and onions. Just a sprinkle of sugar to cut the tang from the dressing. I also dyed the noodles orange while they were cooking(for Halloween). Good stuff!

Very good.  I added chunks of cucumber because I like lots of veggies.
Edit: I have made this several times and I have discovered that regular salad dressing - not light - makes everything "stick" better. I've tried several kinds and my favorite is Wishbone House Italian.  I use Italian plum tomatoes because sometimes a regular tomato can be mushy - or sometimes just use grape tomatoes cut in half.  My family loves this recipe!

I got this same recipe from a friend about 25 years ago. I use the Wishbone Fat-Free & only half the bottle -- Salad Supreme "Seasoning Mix" -- I sometimes add cucumber and sliced black olives -- but ALWAYS top it with Parmesan cheese. GREAT with garlic bread!!
