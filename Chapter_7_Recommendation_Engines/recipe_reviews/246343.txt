Don't know why this is called Spanish garlic toast, my Italian family has eaten this toast for decades!  Nona made it often.

Simple!  I chop garlic in super small pieces. Add 2 a coffee cup with butter, olive oil and garlic powder (u can add fresh or dried parsley too).  Micro all, a little longer 2 blend flavors.  I spread with a mixrowavable brush so i can leave it in the cup when it goes in the fridge 4 the next time i use it.  If u don't like the smell in your fridge, put the whole thing in a container that will cover it all tightly.
Toast any bread and melt the butter in the coffee cup in the micro, spread on toast 4 a SUPER HEALTHY SNACK ANYTIME!!!

I toast my bread in a cast iron pan.  It is strange that one star was given to this delicious recipe.  If there is anything left to the tomato after rubbing on the toast, you could simply eat it!

Thinking about the garlic jar.That works when you have a dry climate. In Lima, where live it is very humid and things do not keep that long. But the recipe is deliciou. We have  good garlic  especialy from Arequipa..

We call this Alicia bread, because of the exchange student who taught us to make it over 30 years ago. It is extra amazing with garden fresh tomatoes.

Delicious and easy recipe indeed, but the author, "Dangerous Chef", is well-named given the recommendation to use parchment paper.  DO NOT USE parchment paper in the broiler (or a toaster oven)!!!  It can catch fire (most broilers are way over 451 degrees Fahrenheit; in addition, any contact with the heating element will result in immediate fire)!  Use aluminum foil instead.

Had this in Barcelona at a hotel bar.  We watched them make it and replicated it when we got home.  It is fantastic and easy to make.   Thank you for the recipe
