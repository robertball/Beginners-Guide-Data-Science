My fiance and I thought this was a restaurant-quality recipe and so easy to make!! I couldn't find fresh mandarin oranges so I used a juice orange and canned mandarin oranges. Definitely sprinkle on the cashews and green onions over the top if you like them, it gives it great flavor and presentation on the plate! I will definitely make this again!
Update: I have made this several times since I first discovered the recipe (ditched the fiance, kept the recipe :-)) and I just LOVE it! I have started adding a small, finely diced serrano pepper in place of the red chili flakes. I like the fresh, pepper flavor! I serve it over Basmati rice. YUM!

This recipe is absolutely fantastic! I prepared the sauce as written, skipping the chopped mandarin orange slices. However, instead of baking the fish I dredged them in flour, seared them in a skillet oiled with one tablespoon of butter, then added the sauce and cooked until it thickened. Don't skip the cashews or the spring onions, they make this dish even better!

Very yummy! I actually used Tilapia this time and it was equally as good as the snapper. The only thing I modified was to finely grate the ginger to evenly disperse the ingredient into the dish. I grate the ginger by turning it clockwise each time so as to not get the stringy pieces. Very easy!

I think this recipe could be good but needs some work. Sauce was not bold or thick enough for me. I will try this again and next time I will cook sauce and fish on their own and then dress the fish. A good starting place.

just made lat night for 7 adults and one y yr old. a few changes only because we lacked required ingredients-terriyaki sauce for soy sauce and olive oil for sesame-matched rest of recipe and only have to bake fish a lil longer because of the size of snapper fillets-EXCELLENT! very fresh, light with a fruity sweet taste followed with a nutty spicy bite- will use often with orange roughy and trout as well! thank you!

I tried it with tilapia and left out the ginger on accident. It was still delicious!! I definitely reccomend this as a quick recipe for a healthy dinner!

This was really good!  We had clemetines instead of mandarins so used those instead.  What surprised me the most, was eating this as a leftover cold- it was delicious cold!  Who knew?

I liked the idea of this sauce, but we found it too heavy on the citrus and too light in the depth of flavor and too thin to really allow the flavor to bake into the fish.  I only cooked half the portion for dinner last night and although I can't take out the lime juice or pieces of mandarin I'm going to try adding some hoisin sauce for thickness and depth.

No red snapper but works well with salmon  and would probably be good to roast a chunk of salmon.

liked the idea of the combination of ingrediants.. not enough sauce to cook the fish in to keep from getting dry.. we used mangrove snapper freshly caught from here in the gulf -- maybe I would try again but I would season  fish first with cajun seasonings & eliminate red pepper.  depending on how big/much fish fillets you were cooking, double the liquids........

I really didn't like this recipe. I don't think the fish picked up much flavor from the sauce, and I didn't like the soggy oranges or the "boiled" look and texture that the fish got from being baked in liquid. It was easy to prepare, I had most of the ingredients on hand, and I think the sauce has promise, but if I use it again it will be with substantial changes to the recipe.

cook as stated. I found it to sweet and very bland could use more seasoning. I would not make this again.

Used one clove of garlic instead of ginger.  Sauce tasted great but bit thin. next time will reserve sauce and thicken with a bit of corn flour.  Will be great with plain rice.
