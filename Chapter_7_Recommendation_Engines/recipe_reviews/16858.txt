I happened to have every single ingredient in the house except for the yogurt, but I made it anyway.  Oh my goodness, this soup was WONDERFUL! I can guarantee I will be making this soup often.  It reminds me of my grandmother, who was from interior Mexico.  My cooking this dish would have made her proud!  Excellent!

I was looking for a good, low fat, fish soup and LOVE this one!  I made a couple of tweaks (I don't eat shellfish so only used cod, used veg broth instead of chicken, red bell pepper instead of green and used fire roasted tomatoes, and added so chipotle chili pepper for heat and flavor).  The heat and the cumin flavor make this soup fabulous and I never would have put all of these flavors together with cod, so hats off to the recipe creator!

This is wonderful.  I omitted the diced chili peppers and used diced jalapenos (we like everything really "kicked up").  And I used canned diced tomatoes with chili's instead of plain tomatoes.  I also added some Emeril's Southwest Essence, and lots of Cajum Seasoning.  This is surely a keeper around here!!!!  Thank you!!

Thank you for this wonderful recipe! If you are on a healthy heart regimine, you have got to try this soup.  I added another can of chicken broth along with grated carrots and barley.  Don't be afraid to experiment with this.  I will be making this often (and in larger quantities)

This is a fabulous, easy, & flavorful fish stew! I made a few changes for our preferences: added ½ cup chopped carrots, 1 celery stick chopped, ½ cup corn; subbed 2 fresh jalapenos for the green chilies, sub veggie stock for ckn stock, sub red bell pepper for green, used canned fire roasted diced tomatoes; added 1 tsp. old bay, pinch of Cajun seasoning, 1 extra clove of garlic. Used sour cream instead of yogurt (what I had on hand) and served it with lime wedge & avocado slices on top. Turned out spicy, delicious, and very filling! Thanks for sharing this great recipe. I will definitely be making this again!

Wow is this good!!  I made it with cod only since I didn't have shrimp.  I used one can of Rotel and one can diced tomatoes since I did not have the chiles and the rest the same as written.  It was great my 11 and 12 yr old daughters LOVED it. It is only 3 pts on the new WW program too!

This is a wonderful wonderful recipe. I changed it a bit by adding a tea spoon of cajun seasoning and I used fresh fish (cooked it much longer than recomended with the bones, then took the bones out and returned chunks of meat back into the soup). Also, I used greek style yogurt. It is absolutelly deliscious and such a rich taste. I will definitely make it again.

For me, this is only a 3  but my family really liked it.  Replaced the cod with tilapia loins (cheaper and tastier) and the shrimp with crab (we don't really like shrimp) and put a bit in each bowl, then ladeled the hot soup over it.  I did not use the full amount of yogurt and am glad - with the spices, a cilantro sour cream would go better (and with the quality low fat/no fat sour cream would still be healthy).  Definitely wasn't spicy enough but that is easily taken care of.  Has lots of potential for each to customize to make it your own.  Definitely going in the recipe box and has already been requested again.

In the words of Guy Fieri: "Holy Salami, Call my Mommy!"...this was FANTASTIC! I did take one readers advice and bought the diced tomatoes with the green chilis in it. I prefer a tomato-based broth, so I reduced the chicken broth by 1/2cup and added 3/4 cup of tomato sauce....YUMM-O!  I didn't have nonfat yogurt but simply used 3/4 c of fat free sour cream...delicious!!! I also like spicy, so I added 1/2 tsp of red chili flakes. I served it over rice and with crusty bread...one of my new favorites!

I had this in New Orleans over St.Patricks weekend and had to try it at home. I love soups and this is now a favorite. I used bass fillets because that is what I had

This is delicious! Followed the recipe pretty closely, but I doubled the amount of garlic.  Didn't have a bell pepper but I think it's fine without it. My only problem was with the yogurt, I only had Greek yogurt so I used that and it did curdle, but I think it was my fault as I put it in the pot too fast. Next time I'll try to be more patient. I wouldn't leave it out though, I think the yogurt gives the soup its richness.

I had to vary the ingredients in this recipe slightly as I made it late a bank holiday evening where there's nothing more to resort to than what's already in the cupboards and fridge! I used yellow peppers instead of green, fromage frais instead of yoghurt and fish stock instead of chicken broth, but this is a very easy recipe and a very tasty and healthy dish!

Simply awesome! The flavor is full and it doesn't taste "healthy." The yogurt gives it a nice richness both in taste and in color. I did make a couple alterations. I'm not fond of cod, so I substituted salmon. I also poured it over a handful of cooked rice. It is on the keeper list.

This is a great soup. I used 1 lb of shrimp and skipped the fish. I did not have any chili powder so i used 1/2 tablespoon of old bay, and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed red pepper still tasted great will definitely make again!

Fish and soup are a tough combo to make appetizing, so I just love it when it works, and this definitely does!  I made as specified, but added a bit of mozzarella and tortilla strips at the table.  I will try a bit of cilantro and maybe avacado or cucumber next time.  (For the person who curdled the yogurt, turn your heat down :-)

I tried all cod. Pretty good, worth tinkering with, probably better with shrimp.Mine curdled when I added the yogurt, which spoiled the looks, although it tasted good. (May be my fault. I had added some lemon juice before remembering to put the yogurt in.)

Delicious! Read some of the reviews and decided to add corn to the recipe as it seemed like a good idea and added potatoes as well - turned out awesome. I love seafood and this soup is delicious. Only made it with fish (no shrimp in the house).

This was soup was great and the recipe is so versatile. I didn't have shrimp so just used cod. I also have 2 young boys, so I had to make it less spicy. Instead of the diced chilli peppers and green peppers I simply used red bell peppers and added a pinch of brown sugar and tablespoon on cider vinegar to help tone down the spice. I also didn't use yogurt. It was simply delicious.

I happened to stumble into this recipe and it sounded so good, I went and bought some of the ingredients and took some of the comments suggestions in mixing/substituting for other ingredients and OMG! It's the bomb dot com!!! I also added chipotle peppers instead of green peppers and I added diced potatoes and celery....Man!!! I'm definitely making this again!!

I do have a question. What does the yogurt do?? I didn't add it to the whole soup, just in case but I added a spoonful into my own personal bowl and it's tastes the same, just changes the color up.

This was much better the more days in the fridge where the fish/shrimp could soak up the seasoning.  It made for a nice light soup.

Yummy and perfectly light for a warm evening.
Had to add some chopped jalapenos as the only chillis I can get have no bite.  I strained the fish out of the leftovers and cooked penne in the soup.  Stirred the fish back in, put it in a tuppaware and my husband was thrilled with his lunch the next day.

I loved this!  I added chopped potato and course cut carrots and omitted the yogurt.  Super tasty!  I would definitely make it again and try adding clams too!  It's a fun one to play around with!

I modified the recipe slightly.  I added two small red potatoes (diced) and a can of corn.  I also added the green bell pepper before the first boil since I like the flavor of pepper in my soups.  My husband had 3 bowls and my neighbor came over to claim the remains!  Shouldn't have post it on Facebook if I didn't want to share ;)  Everyone loved it!  A keeper.

Another hint is that I squeezed lemon in my soup and  chopped cilantro on top to garnish and for taste,  to truly make it a Mexican dish.

Really good recipe, thanks.  All I added was salt and crushed red pepper flakes. I’ll be keeping this for sure.  Now, if you liked this then I'd like to recommend that you try the recipe for Brazilian Fish Stew from this site.  I did cut the bell peppers from 4 to 2, but that’s all I changed.  Different recipe but it will make your knees buckle.  So good!

Thanks for this easy recipe.  I made it just as written, but forgot to put the yogurt in.  It was a good thing, because I didn't care for the serving I added yogurt to.  It was much better without the yogurt.

Really great, simple recipe! I omitted the shrimp and doubled up on the cod. I also added about 2-3 stalks each of celery and carrot, sliced thick. Came out really great! I will be making this again!

My husband really liked this recipe...my daughter went to bed hungry, but it really isn't a kid recipe. I thought it was good, but need something more. I added extra chiles and garlic, as well as substituting 1/2 the chicken broth for white wine. I served this over whole wheat pasta.

I'm trying this recipe tonight. It really sounds like its going to be good. For everyone who had problems with their yogurt curling you could possibly temper it the way you would do eggs And then slowly add it to the soup. just use some soup stock to do the tempering with.

I love spicy foods, but I also like it with lots of flavor. All I can taste is the chili powder in the broth.

I think my dislike was more that I don't think I'd like ANY spicy fish soup rather than an actual issue with the recipe.  Had the perfect amount of spice for me which was one plus :)   Seemed to watery to me as is so I added quinoa and corn - and still to watery.  Used sour cream instead of yogurt because that's what I had and I didn't like how it looked after adding that.  Don't like shrimp so just used cod.   Made in crock pot - BIG MISTAKE.  My house smelled like fish for a literally a week - the smell also really turned me off to this.  Will probably throw away leftovers.

This dish is wonderful.  I too happened to have all the ingredients on hand.  It all started with a lonely filet of cod that I wanted to do something with. Well what a surprise! It is spicy hot and I love that, however...  When I make this for the rest of the family I will have to tone it down.  Thank you for sharing.

Delicious! Made made recipe for 6, omitted green pepper and used one can of Muir Glen diced tomatoes with Adobe and one regular can diced tomatoes. Instead of yogurt (didn't have) used a splash of coconut milk.

This soup was wonderful. I used canned tomatoes with green chile peppers. It was a little on the hot side for me, but I loved it. I will probably just make it with shrimp from now on.

My family absolutely loved this recipe! I used tilapia instead of cod, We don't like food too spicy so I used 1 tsp chili powder and 2 tsp old bay seasonings. I wanted more veggies so I added carrots and celery. Also instead of the green chiles I added mild banana peppers from a jar.

Great dish! Wonderful flavor and texture mix in a healthy meal. Those who like really spicy food will probably want to add red pepper flakes or hot sauce, but if you like a mild/medium bite this is just right. I sometimes add a little rice for texture. Thanks for a great recipe.

Quite tasty, though a touch too much cumin for my preference.   I added corn, paprika, and more broth.   I made the mistake of adding the yogurt too quickly, so I must reiterate that it's important to add it gradually to keep the texture smooth.

My husband and I do not like bell peppers, so we left that out. I didn't have any shrimp so I used extra cod. In the end I forgot to add the yogurt. Despite the three missing ingredients this soup was WONDERFUL!

INCREDIBLE !!!! I am a vegetarian, so I didn't taste it. My husband said it was FANTASTIC, and he usually doesn't rave about food. I omitted the shrimp and yogurt, as he doesn't eat shell fish or dairy. I doubled the cod & used canned, diced tomatoes that have peppers in it...in addition to what the recipe called for. He actually woke up the next morning and said that he had a dream about this soup...LOL. It was so easy to make. I will never let him see the recipe because he thinks that it was difficult to make and took all day :)

I made this last night for my family and needless to say, it went quick. It was such a hit that I made more and took it to my Mom and brother. Everyone agreed that it was the best fish soup they ever had.

Changes: I didn't add tomatoes since I was out of them, added a tbsp of hot jalapeno green salsa for a nice kick, then at the final stage I added a tbsp of fresh chopped parsley, and 2 tbsp of heavy whipping cream. Since using chicken bouillon can sometimes make a dish saltier, I added 2-1/4 cups of water with 2 chicken cubes.

I wasn't overly impressed by this dish, but it did have some good flavors. It definitely could use a pinch of salt and something acidic as well (maybe lime juice or a splash of vinegar). I used a jalapeno with some the seeds in place of the canned chiles for a more fresh spicy flavor. Overall, this is a good base dish to tweak to your liking.

This recipe is a keeper.  I tweaked it based on what I had (1 tbsp California Chile Pepper instead of 2 tbsp chile powder, no yogurt because I don't do dairy, no shrimp because I didn't have any, fresh jalapeno instead of canned green chile peppers).  I also added a couple of tablespoons of chopped cilantro.  My husband was over the moon.  Yum.  Will make again.

Excellent. I substituted vegetable broth, jalapenos, and fresh tomatoes due to what I had available. Good with a bit of Tapatio/tobasco/other hot sauce mixed in when served. This would also be good with other seafood thrown in as well... scallops, crab, etc.

Great easy recipe.  I used frozen tilapia and a frozen mixed seafood bag (shrimp, calamari, and baby scallops) and it still tasted great.  Also added in a banana pepper for a bit more zing.

This was a very easy and tasty soup! After I had already begun cooking I realized I was out of chili powder so I substituted Siracha sauce and it was great.  I definitely recommend using the yogurt as the recipe calls for.  It really does add a little something extra to this soup (and also tames down the heat a bit). My husband really enjoyed it as well. I will be making this again many times!

I made this for my family and they ate the whole pot within minutes.  I made it again the following week and ended up doubling the recipe to make sure we had enough. I also added double the amount of fish and shrimp and added diced okra, it was delicious and tasted like a homeade gumbo. Thanks for sharing this recipe, it is a hit with my family and they are picky eaters.

I don't know if I did something wrong with this one, but I was dissappointed.  Will not make again.  Spicy, but somehow bland.

really good soup. I prefer it without the yogurt. I screwed it up when cooking and the yogurt began to curdle. Yummy never the less! Enjoy!

Excellent, very flavorful soup.  Easy to change up on the seafood to whatever you like.  Thanks for sharing.

Great Recipe!  Reminds me of a cross between gumbo and chicken tortilla soup.  I didn't find it too spicy, but if you don't like spicy, don't cook "Spicy Fish Soup".  I used a can of Rotel instead of tomatoes and chilis.

This soup was delicious! I did make some changes. Used olive oil instead of spray, added bay leaf & clam juice to the broth, used red & yellow peppers instead of green, doubled the shrimp and did not use yogurt. The soup was so pretty I couldn't see clouding it with yogurt and don't really like the taste of yogurt. Served sour cream on the side instead.

Very good.  I followed one of the users tips about the halopenos - spicy is a must for me.  I actually used fish stock instead of chicken - slightly fishier taste for those who like it.

This is spicy, true, but not hot, so I used a can of tomatoes with green chiles. I also added a little lime juice and chopped cilantro at the end. In all, though, this was only OK. It isn't a 'keeper' for me. I have other fish soups to try....Thank you, though!

What a great recipe! It's so simple and delicous--it only takes a few minutes to prepare and makes a filling and tasty soup. I like spicy foods and i found the original recipe was a little tame, but subbing fresh and canned jalepenos was too much! so the next time i make it i will add canned jalepenos and fresh green peppers--also this soup is awesome heated up the next day!

I didnt see how it says to cook the fish/shrimp so i seasoned the fish (salt, pepper, cayenne, garlic, onion, cumin, chili powder) and cooked in canola oil in a skillet.  I doubled the recipe.  Used 4 Jalapeno in place of a can of green chiles.  Used 2 fresh tomato in place of a can.  Chose fire roasted tomato.  Used Sour Cream instead of yogurt.  Very good, heckin spicy!!

I made this soup once before but I don't remember it being this delicious. Here's the small changes that I made. First I used all cod only because I didn't have any shrimp (next time I will use shrimp). I used vegetable broth instead of chicken. I also doubled the recipe and added an additional cup of broth. My daughter asked me to make rice to go with it but I didn't add it in because I like the soup without rice or pasta. My husband said it was so good that he almost swallowed his spoon. This recipe is a keeper!!

I have made this recipe 3 times now and it has become one of my favorite dishes. When some people hear fish soup, they turn up their nose but this recipe will instantly make any doubter a fan. Cooked exactly as instructed. For a spicier version use 2 diced jalapenos instead of canned chiles.

I decided to try a dinner outside my comfort zone - ended up trying this soup.

My wife and I were *very* pleasently surprised at how delicious and savory this soup was.

I can recommend it unreservedly.

The soup was very good.  I used a package of frozen mixed seafood that I had (shrimp, scallops, mussels and calamari) and forgot to add the yogurt.  It was very light and flavorful.

Got rid of the yogurt for same amount of heavy cream. Looked nothing like the picture. I know its not from the cream. I used very fresh cod and shrimp right off the boat. So cooked about 2 mins. Longer. The flavor wasnt bad, but looked more like a bisque and would have been fantastic with lobster pre cooked and sauteed in butter mixed in at the minute.

It didn't turn out very spicy for me.  Next time will make it with tomatoes with peppers in them to bring a bit more spice.  Still, it was enjoyed.

Excellent recipe.  I doubled it and subbed 1c light sour cream and 1/2c Greek yogurt instead of all yogurt.  Also one 4oz can of chopped jalapeno for the chopped green chilies.  I sprinkled a little cayenne with the chili powder.  We really enjoyed it.

Edit:  I made this again and had a problem with curdling when I added the yogurt.   Next time I will use all light sour cream.

Yum! This was surprisingly very good! So comforting and filling! I was leery at first because I don’t eat other types of fish than salmon, but I’m so glad I gave it a try! The combination of flavors and ingredients made this very tasty!  
 (Note:  I only used a 1lb bag of thawed cod instead of the full 2 lbs required by the recipe, which makes this more watery, but I added basmati rice to make it more of a meal and it was wonderful! I also used plain greek yogurt instead of regular and it seemed just fine.)

I will say that because I bought “no salt added” tomatoes this tasted a little bland so I had to add salt at the end. It also didn’t seem spicy at all so I also added cayenne pepper to taste. Otherwise this is very good! I will definitely make this again! 

Definitely a recipe I recommend for seafood lovers, and soup lovers alike! Yum!

You probably have all of these ingredients so make it! And if you don’t just substitute!

I used plain water instead of broth and adjusted seasoning. Added Old Bay about a tsp. Subbed frozen sliced zucchini for the green bell pepper and used flounder for the fish. Shredded chicken would be good too. 

Great basic recipe that can be accomodated for whatever you have on hand.

This recipe is spicy to anybody that thinks jalepenos are spicy. That said it's still flavorful from the spices, and it has a slightly sour taste from the tomatoes and yogurt. I'll definitely make this again.

Love it!  I was out of yogurt but it still came out great.  Served with white rice.  I can’t wait to try this in the summer when I have a freshly caught Black Sea bass and fresh clams to add!

This was super delicious and I added made a few changes. I added a can of clams with the clam juice, a bunch of parsley and potatoes as well. Substituted the green chilis for 4 fresh jalapeño peppers. Came out killer

I can't even tell anyone enough on how good this is!  First...I hate anything but cod and shrimp.  I needed a recipe for the left over Talapia.  This soup is so good, I kept eating the juice with a spoon.  Here's what I did....I followed the directions as requested with the exception of the fish.  No salt? Really I had to taste it and then I realized I had a home run with the juice!  I tossed in the fish, mine seemed to be thick enough that I didn't need to add any yogurt.  So all I did was toss in our left over fish and it was done.

My boyfriend wanted to make fish soup - I was less enthused by the idea, but decided to look up a recipe and try it out. I can't say fish soup in general is my favorite dish, but I generally enjoyed this soup and my boyfriend definitely liked it. We didn't use any chill powder or chile peppers as my boyfriend doesn't like spicy food. We added potatoes, carrots, paprika, salt, and pepper. The cumin  definitely makes this soup. They didn't have enough cod at the store, so we bought something else to supplement - I don't think that was very good, recommend sticking with cod. And I might make this soup without the shrimp next time, wasn't a huge fan.

Really enjoyed the flavour of this soup. I used a pound of cod and no shrimp. I didn't add the yogurt at the end because I didn't want the spiciness to be moderated. The spicier, the better, in our house! I will definitely be making this again.

This is definitely going in the "keep" pile.
Even my super picky husband absolutely LOVED it.
I used fresh tomatoes and jalapeños instead of canned stuff and added them with the cumin to cook for the 20 minutes. I also added fresh celery and zucchini with the seafood for the last 5 minutes and topped it all of with sour cream instead of the yogurt. The flavor was amazing and I will be making this again for sure

I modified this slightly by using Whole Foods' Hot Habanero Seasoning on the fish and shrimp and substituted seafood broth for the chicken stock. Also, I opted for the fire roasted tomatoes for extra flavor. Very hearty and delicious soup!

Simple and very good. I've made it with shrimp alone, fish alone and both together. Even leftover shrimp or fish will work. I have my own roasted hatch chilies and  chopped up seeded jalapeños instead of bell pepper. Otherwise I left everything unchanged, and served it with a chopped cilantro  garnish and wedges of lime to squeeze on the soup at table. Takes away a little of the Tex, but adds a lot to the Mex.

Loved the idea!! I'm in a weight loss plan and this recipe fit in very well! Read all the reviews and modified in the following ways: 1) doubled liquid content; 2) used grilled Hatch Peppers from earlier in the summer; 3) put a dollop of plain yogurt in each bowl rather than adding to the cooking pot, and topped with fresh cilantro; 4) added fresh corn cut off the cob; added a shake of hot-sauce to taste. I love being able to prepare tasty, healthy, flavorful food!

Made this last night and it was delish. I made it exactly as written with one exception...tomatoes with chilis in them already. We ladles into deep bowls and offered shredded jack cheese, sliced avocados, sour cream and tortilla strips fir toppings.

I tried the recipe tonight. It's a keeper! Delicious and spicy. The yogurt is a good idea to tone things down just a bit. My only issue is that the yogurt didn't fully dissolve into the soups, giving it a grainy appearance. Am wondering if I should have added it in a different way. Also, I added a bay leaf and some cilantro at the end. I've had lots of Mediterranean and Indian fish stews, which are tasty in their own way, but this Tex-Mex version is right up there!

This was delish! I didn't have green peppers, shrimp, or yogurt, so I omitted the peppers, added more fish instead of shrimp and sour cream for the yogurt. It was great. I think next time I'll try to get some shrimp, and maybe add some potato or carrot or both. I topped my bowl with some Mexican hot sauce and it really added a nice kick.

Very, very good recipe. I add 4 fresh red chili peppers and one jalapeno. I use one small can of rotel tomatoes w. green chilis. and a little more chicken broth. I prefer fish over shrimp often so I used flash frozen cod and hake that I bought at costco. 

This is a wonderful dish, I get many compliments and have made it many times.

A good base soup. Even my picky 4yo who said 'he likes the red soup' and my picky hubby enjoyed it as well. I used rotisserie chicken instead of the seafood and added half a cup of pineapple yogurt since that was all I had. It gave the stew a nice, sweet, fruity flavor. Will keep in my recipe box...

Give it a bit of Thai flare.. 
Substitute cubed potatoes for the tomato's... 
Toss in a bit of spicy Yellow Curry Powder to taste.
Simulate a coconut milk curry by keeping the yogurt and adding a bit of Splenda to keep calorie count low,  but the complete full body of heat and sweet.

Definitely spicy! I'd recommend dicing the cod in chunks before adding to the soup. Don't add the yogurt...it just curdles. Instead of green chiles, i opted for Rotel and it's still  spicy. And instead of chili powder, I used cayenne...but I used only 1/2 a teaspoon. Flavor is great (add a little salt) but my nose is running right now and I feel like I'm sitting outside in the Alabama heat!

this soup is really good.  I especially liked it on the shrimp.  However, we used red snapper in place of the cod, since it was the fish we had at the time.  In my opinion, the snapper was way too fishy-tasting.  But it would be worth trying again with a milder fish.

this was a great recipe. i added some things though... and i took someethings out. i didn't have any chicken brothe per se so i used boullion. i used applecider for the boullion insted of water which gave the soup a nice sweet spicy flavour and went wel with the extra bell peppers[since i doubled the recipe]i added some cayenne to make up for the chilli peppers that i did not getand a single slice[more of a shave really]of ginger for my cider. cutting and prparing everything beforehand really makes this recipe seem like child's play. it was a great recipe thanks!

Awesome last-minute choice for dinner, even with my substitutions.  I had no green chillis in a can so I substituted some leftover green salsa and thawed spinach.  I was out of chili powder so used The Firecracker Chili Powder recipe here on AllRecipes.  I'm in Germany -- frozen Seelachsfilet (Pollock in English?) is readily available and what I used here.

This is a regular in our house, we make at least once every two weeks.  We don't include the yogurt since my husband is anti-yogurt.  You can really play around with different fish & seafood - whatever is on special.  I like adding the chopped green peppers at the very end, so that they don't get overcooked and have a little crunch.

I love this soup!  It seemed like a lot of chili powder, but I stuck to the recipe as is since no one else commented on it, and it was very, very good. Just enough heat without being too overpowering.

Excellent - spicy, full of flavor. I loved it. Followed recipe except doubled the cod. Definitely a keeper. It's great for dieters, especially.

Looking at the wide variety of ingredients on this recipe, I was skeptical. But, given the excellent ratings, we gave it a shot. It was FABULOUS!! We love spicy, and it was nice a zingy and super flavorful. And low cal! We will for sure make this again. I highly recommend this one!

Outstanding!  I doubled the fish & omitted the shrimp.  I substituted Rotel for green chili & tomatoe & it was just right but too spicy for one of my boys.  I also added cubed potatoes at step #2 to make it a bit more hearty.  A definite keeper :)

This is an easy and very flavorful fish soup recipe.  The sauted onions, garlic, and chili powder make a nice base for this soup. I didn't alter the recipe and will definately make it again.

We really liked this soup! I judge everything I make by the picky boyfriend and he loved it. (He isn't even a soup-lover!)  I added some jalepenos and some cilantro to up the flavor but that is pretty much the only change I made.  I like that it was SO easy and the fact that I could change up the meat from seafood to chicken easily depending on my mood makes it even better.  For being so healthy it is so tasty! Hooray!

Very good recipe! I changed it up a bit because my husband doesn't like tomatoes in his soup, and I was in an "Indonesian" mood. So I omitted the tomatoes and instead of cumin, used fresh ginger, turmeric and fresh parsley. I also cut way back on the chili powder because of our 18 month old and omitted the green chile peppers.

I absolutely loved this soup.  I used a couple chopped serrano chiles instead of green chiles, a little extra garlic, and replaced the shrimp with scallops.  Cooking was quick and easy and it came out great.

This was delicious!! In the future I'll probably cut out the chili powder and try adding other veggies - carrots, celery, etc. This was so tasty and healthy! I used extra chicken broth as well as vegetable broth, added a bay leaf, and diced jalapenos. I doubled the garlic, used a yellow bell pepper just for the color, and I left out the yogurt. Seems like this would work with a variety of tasty combinations!

This was just okay.  Not that it didn't have a lot of flavor, and certainly spicy enough, my family just wasn't very impressed.

The perfect recipe.  Easy, inexpensive and full of flavor!!  We had some leftover fish from a family dinner and this was the perfect use for it.  I didn't add the yogurt and it was still delicious.

Looking for healthy foods for my husband, and this looked like a winner.  I thought it was pretty tasty, but unfortunately, he didn't care for it.  3 stars is the average of both of our ratings.

OK I am no expert so maybe the fact that the green chilis I used were pickled made a huge difference but this was waaaay toooo hot to eat. I added a full carton of yogurt and some white sugar and my mouth is still flaming. Before the insane heat hit me, I did like the flavor, but after four bites my eyes were watering and my boyfriend was begging for mercy. I will be avoiding spicy food for awhile.

My husband and I LOVE this soup.  It's great as-is but you can also play around by adding bell pepper, jalepenos, etc.
It's also good with shredded chicken rather than fish.  
I think it's a great recipe - easy, quick and very flavorful!

This soup was very good ... the first day. I ate the leftovers 3 days later and it was terrible ... tasted like it came straight from a can (which some of the ingredents did). I used organic chicken broth from a carton and red bell pepper instead of green. You can't really taste the yogurt so don't leave it out.

I accidently spilled the cumin into the soup so
there was considerable more in mine than per the
recipe.  I ommitted the chile peppers, substituted scallops for the cod, and pureed
a can of stewed tomates to add. Very easy and
tasty.

This soup was really great. I am not a big tomatoe fan, so I used half potatoes, half tomatoes, excellent. No one else wanted fish soup...eck..so I ate the pot myself..
