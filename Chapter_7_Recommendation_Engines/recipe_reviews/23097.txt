I LOVE anything with peanut butter and could eat it by the spoonfuls (now if they could only come up with a great tasting fat free version). That being said I finally got around to trying this and I love it when someone takes a classic and puts a new twist on it.  I love the crunchy texture you get from the addition of the toasted bread in the middle - great idea!

Oh, my god, SOOOO amazingly good! You have no idea what a difference the toasted slice of bread makes to the texture. I can only liken the crunchy/soft sensation to when you bite into a 100 Grand bar-- it's chewy with a crunch to it, and it makes the sandwich so much more satisfying to bite into! Use more jelly than you usually do on this, the peanut butter and toast combo makes it drier than a regular sandwich.

TERRIFIC!!!  Made this for lunch today w/ thin white bread & everyone LOVED it!  More substantial than a regular PBJ.  The crunch adds something.  It's so good, it's hard to put your finger on just what makes this sandwich so yummy!

If you are a peanut butter & jelly sandwich lover, you will love this! We have been making our sandwiches like this for quite some time now. Sometimes we toast the middle slice, and sometimes we do not, it's great either way. I have a tendency to make my pb&j sandwiches a little too "loaded", and the extra slice of bread helps break it up, but still alows me to use a lot peanut butter and preserves...LOL. I'm glad to see this recipe posted here :)

A fun sandwich and, of course, very kid friendly!  It has lots of possibilities too...you could use two different types of jelly or do a layer with more PB and then a layer of bananas.

I actually didn't think this tasted TOO different from a regular PB&J. That said, this sandwich recipe is really good. A little time consuming, but I found it fun to make. The toasted slice does add nice texture.

Oh m'gosh, I can't believe I'm rating a PB&J sandwich.  Came across this by mistake and was hungry for it at the time.  Thought to myself, "how different could this be"?  Well, it really messes with your senses which makes it oh, so fun!  The plain bread and toast combo just have your mouth asking for more.  Used chunky Jif and Cherry preserves - yummy.  I've told many people at work about this recipe and they just look at me like I'm nuts.  You must try it.  The grandkids think it's awesome as well!

What a fun idea!  I made this for my son and I to split for lunch one day and we both thought it was great.  Just for kicks, we tried it the opposite way the next day, toasting the outer slices and leaving the middle slice untoasted.  That was good too, but Ignacio's way is better.  Thanks, Ignacio, for a fun recipe to share with my kids!

I eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches every day, so this was a nice change!  I use regular jelly though, because I loathe preserves.  I also used whole wheat bread and Smuckers natural peanut butter.  All PB+J lovers must try this recipe!

Ignacio, this is a crazy mixed up peanut butter and jelly sandwich! When it is cut, it does actually looks a lot like the photo which I didn't expect. I was so full, after actually eating the whole sandwich, I could have almost skipped dinner in the evening. I think it looks neat, but I just can't figure out whether I am eating peanut butter toast or a pb&j. Interesting, take on a peanut butter and jelly though!

I gave this five stars because it's amazing what a small change can do to something as basic as peanut butter and jelly sandwiches!  However, for all you gourmets out there, remember it is, well, peanut butter and jelly after all.

This was definitely very yummy, but I didn't taste that much of a difference to a regular pb/j sandwich. It was more filling though. I'll make this again, it was really good.

I only gave this three stars, but I'm leaning toward four. The toasted center slice is ingenious. It really adds texture. But I turned it into a 4.5 star sandwich. I buttered the top and bottom and grilled it. The idea came from another recipe on this site. Outstanding.

I haven't had a pb&j sandwich in a long time. This was good. I used a special peach preserve from the Texas Hill Country. I'm actually thinking about toasting the 2 outside slices. Thanks!

I had this today for breakfast.  I split it with my son.  I loved the texture difference that the toasted slice gave the sandwich.  My son said he just wanted a regular PB&J, but he ate this one.  So only 4 stars.  Thanks  Ignacio.

This is such a neat idea. I really liked the different texture the middle slice gave, even though it sort of reminded me of a Butterfinger (I don't like Butterfingers). Next time I'm going to try mixing the peanut butter and jelly before I put it on and see how that is.

Awesome this is really good! It's like a 100 Grand bar as another reviewer said. The crunch from the toast is really yummy and I'll definitely make them this way again.

I made this for my lunch the other day and it was pretty good...if you're really hungry. This is a pretty big sandwich and I do recommend using a lot more pb and jelly than you would normally use.  The addition of a piece of toasted bread gives a really good texture and crunch.

I like the texture of the toasted bread with the soft bread, it takes the plain ol' Pb&J sandwich to a higher level! THX.

This is a great idea!  I am 4 months pregnant and am ALWAYS hungry so pb&j are a major staple these days, because they are quick and easy and I need the protein from the peanut butter.  This makes it a little less boring and I love the crunchy in the middle.  My son loved it too!

Really good! I really like the crunchy layer in the middle. So much better than a plain PB&J. Plus this way you can share and a half sandwich is plenty, for me anyway.

This was a big hit served hors d'oeuvres-style to my kids and a bunch of neighborhood kids--I needed something easy and quick. I cut the sandwiches into triangles. The kids loved the novelty of a triple-decker sandwich with a crunchy twist. Most were only able to eat one or two triangles, so this is a pretty filling lunch. This doesn't translate well if you're using spelt bread (for those with wheat allergies)--I found that the spelt bread is just too dense to want to eat three layers of it.

Hey, I loved it.  I'm a big fan of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and now that my husband has started school again, I'll be making lots of dinners for one.  Which means lots of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  I spread peanut butter on two slices of bread and jellied the toasted bread on both sides with my very favorite homemade pear jam.  Then I cut into four squares and enjoyed it just like a little kid.  I loved it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Well, I'm sorry to be critical, but I made this sandwich for my husband's lunch bucket and my daughter took one too for her school lunch.  They both agreed that it was a BIG "thumbs down"!  They said it was like eating rubber.  Did I do something wrong?  I let the toasted piece of bread cool completely.  Or do you have to eat this sandwich right away?  Anyway, they both agreed that I should NEVER make this for them again.  Sorry!

This was OK. I made it when I wanted a PBJ sandwich with a little crunch but not as much as I'd get from crunchy peanut butter.  I did get that, but it was a little too much of an effect. It might have been better if my bread had been a little less toasted or if I'd let the peanut butter soak in for a bit longer.

Awesome! I LOVED the addition of the toast in the middle. It really gave the sandwich a nice texture. I do have to say that I did not measure anything, just went by instinct. A great twist on an old classic! Thanks for sharing. :)

I went into this thinking, "what's the big deal, toast and pbj is nothing new"...and I got schooled.  I intended to eat only half the sandwich, just to try it and ended up polishing off most of it.  The toast in the center is really a nice twist.  A nice little crunch.  Thanks for sharing!

It is still a pb&J..but it is good with the 2 layers & toasted bread in the middle. If I had a little restaurant, this is how I would serve my pb&j's.

I eat grilled or toasted PB&J all the time so when I made this, my boyfriend and I did not think it was such a big deal.  Instead, we thought it was too bready.  Maybe this is a better recipe for kids.  Will stick to my regular 2-sliced PB&J.  Thanks for posting!

 I do like the idea of toasting the bread. I'm going to always do that from now on! It really adds to the texture, and it makes it so easy to spread the peanut butter. :)

Ok, this is crazy good.  I had no idea, but adding in the crunch makes the sandwich taste like a PB&J candy bar.  Kids think I invented something magical here.....I'm their hero!  Thank you!

i seriously did not think this would make the pb&j 50 times better, but it seriously does.  my bf, who is a grown marine, was more stunned (if thats possible) than i was by this little twist.  genius!!!  hahaha.

SIX STARS!! NO WAIT... 100! INGENIOUS IDEA! Make sure toast is COOLED before using, we suggest putting the toast in the freezer while you prepare the other slices of bread. Great with all jellies OR HONEY! Also cut diagonally--just because! We finally found a way to reduce our dad's craving for one and a half peanut butter and jelly sandwichs! Because this one is just the right amount! ???

Using toasted bread for a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich is delicious. And I love it. It makes me not want to go back to using fresh slices of bread. Simply marvelous.

I have to give it 5 stars because just throwing in that piece of toast does more than you can imagine.  Nice spin on an otherwise boring PB&J!

Amazingly wonderful. The extra piece of bread is really very filling, so it's best to split with someone. I don't think it would be too good made, then eaten hours later as a packed lunch, what  toasted sandwich does? But, for those of us craving good old pb&j, I say thanks!

I always eat my pb & j sandwiches toasted but this was a nice little twist.  It is very filling.  I had 1/2 a sandwich, along with a banana and a small salad and I was stuffed.  I used a fresh baked Italian bread.  Very creative!
