Asparagus Omelette Haiku: "Prep needs some short-cuts, so it's easier to make. But SHAZAM, it rocks!" (1st I have to say that I love the recipe submitter's user name!) Made this for lunch for just myself so I halved the recipe for 2 large eggs, and I condensed what would've been alot of dirty dishes when preparing this by using my frittata pan to cook the bacon, retaining some of the grease for then sauteeing all of the veggies (including the asparagus - saw no need to boil it 1st) and cooking it on med-lo, finishing it off on the stovetop w/ the cheese rather than broiling as my pan wasn't ovenproof. (If I was making the full recipe for more than myself, which I totally plan on doing b/c I loved this THAT much, I'll use my larger oven-safe pan and not skip that final broil step.) These ingredients are just magical together. Yes, I can see myself tossing in kale, spinach, zucchini, bell pepper or whatever vegg is floating around the fridge, but this particular combo w/ the nutmeg and mozzarella was scrumpdiddlidoodliumptious.

This recipe is a lot of work for an omelette, but worth it in the end.   I'm not used to cooking my veggies before adding them to the recipe, because I like the fresher, crisper taste, but in this recipe it works.   Also this is a very heavy omelette.  This is thick enough that you could bake it as is and get yourself a nice quiche.   I did not pick up on the flavor of the nutmeg, but I'm sure it helped.   The broiling was a new take on an omelette for me and it worked good for this recipe, but I don't think I will do it on my normal omelettes.   This is a lot of food for two omelettes and will satisfy most hungry men.

Turned out great.  Even my 9 year old loved it and asked me to make it again. 

Menu: asparagus omelette, home fries, fresh fruit.

Didn't have bacon, so diced up some deli ham.  Sauted ham, onions, asparagus, Roma tomatoes, white mushrooms.  Added them to the egg/cheddar cheese mixture in 9" skillet on stove top. While cooking, grilled a slice of garlic toast.  Placed some spinach leaves and a little more shredded cheddar on toast, put finished omlet on toast for an open faced om-which.

This came out really well. I didn't have bacon on hand so I used some crumbled sausage. I've never used asparagus in eggs before but it was delicious - will definitely try it again.

My husband LOVED IT!!!  I used feta cheese instead of mozzarella. I also added a couple dashes of garlic powder.  Excellent flavor combination!
