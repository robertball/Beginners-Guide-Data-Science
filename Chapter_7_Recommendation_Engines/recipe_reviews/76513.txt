Excellent recipe, will absolutely make this one again. I used a large can of Cambell's New England clam Chowder, 1 10.75 can of cream of potato soup, 1 diced red pototo, and 1 extra can of minced clams. Used shell pasta and added a half carrot shredded also.

Delicious!!!!  I love this dish!!!  Instead of elbow macaroni, I used small sea shells and it works well.  Also, I don't use all of the clam juice that the recipe calls for, but nevertheless, any clam chowder fan MUST try this!!!

This was pretty good. I used 1 tsp. Worcerstershire-a tbsp. would have been way too much for me. It tasted more like my mother's old-fashioned tuna-noodle casserole than a clam chowder. Although I like the cheese very much, it masked the chowder flavor. I was a tasty dish, just not quite what I was anticipating. I would make it again though. It was very easy.

I had my doubts about this recipe, but it turned out great. I also discarded some of the clam juice (one can worth) and the consistency was just right. I would suggest changing the name to something like Potato & Clam Surprise!

I followed the recipe almost exactly..(I put in more cheese) My husband & I ate 2 bowls of this and loved every bit of it. My 16 yr old daughter thought it would have tasted better with hamburger instead of clams. I will try that next time.

I just made this and followed the directions exactly. I did not think it was to runny with the clam juice. I thought the clams came out tough. I cooked it for 30 minutes. Next time I will omit the clams and just use it as a side dish.

Easy and yummy... I did mine a little differently. I used 2 cans of clam chowder soup (not the kind you add water to). Since that already had potatoes and clams in it I left out the potato soup and the clams. the rest of the recipe I followed exactly. Good for a quick weeknight supper. I served it with garlic toast.

I had this recipe for a while and just decided to try it.  It was wonderful and I'll certainly make it again and again.  I mis-read the lemon and put in more than it called for but it was fine all the same.

Pretty yummy stuff!  I mixed and matched suggestions such as extra can of clams and less clam juice.  I did 1 can potato soup and 1 can clam chowder.  I also used small sea shells and put hot sauce in mine after and that was a hit!

It's ok. I wouldn't make it again but I love clams and I like the concept here. Maybe with whole baby clams, some celery, bread crumbs and garlic.

Very quick & easy to make but too much pepper for us. I omitted the clams and it was still very good but next time I will cut the pepper in half. Other than there being too much pepper, my family enjoyed it a lot. I'm sure I'll make this again.

This was a unique idea for a recipe.  It really tastes like clam chowder casserole.

I have made this for years and decided to rate it! My boyfriend loves it and requests it often and he normally isn't a casserole kind of guy.  When we clam dig we can the clams of the razor clams and I half the recipe and use one pint jar of clams. Since the razor clams are big I run them through the food processor to chop up a bit. Every Friday my boyfriend goes to the local VFW for clam chowder but if I want him to stay home I make this. (wink wink) haha I make it just as the recipe states. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

An excellent recipe. I used a can of clam chowder and a can of tuna (since I had them on hand) and also added frozen peas. Wonderful!

I was rather disappointed by this casserole, as was my family. It was just sorta blah. I should've used my instinct and cooked the onions first....they were kinda raw and crunchy. As my husband put it, "There are just better things to do with clams!". Would not make it again.

I thought this lived up to exactly what Kathy said, a great weeknight supper. I too left out the juice of one of the cans of clams. Really good, easy, comfort food.

A bit underwhelming. It reminded us more of tuna casserole than of clam chowder.

I made this the second time tonight.  I followed the recipe with no add ins.  It turned out great again.  I love the flavors and the consistency was just right.  Will be making it again.
