The recipe tastes like brownie chocolate chip cookies. A very picky husband didn't want to share the cookies.

Nothing fancy, but these taste very good, especially for the modest ingredients.  This pre made mix is great, economical, handy to have around for the kids.  Someone gave me some powdered milk, had no idea what I was going to do with it, now I found a use!  Watch out when spacing the cookies, they do spread out.  Can't wait to try the other recipes for the cookie mix.  Thanks!

I was hesitant to make these cookies, so I only made enough of the basic cookie mix (scale it down to serve 8) to make these cookies. I chose to only add 1 Tbsp of water and found it was plenty. The recipe is very versatile I added some chocolate chips to a portion of the dough. You could also add in some peppermint chips by Andes for a unique chocolate mint cookie.
