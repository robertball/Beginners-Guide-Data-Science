I have made this cake TWICE this weekend at the request of my son, husband & MIL.
The first time, after baked, the cake mix "enveloped" the cream cheese mixture, and wasn't as tall after cooling.  The second time, the cream cheese pretty much stayed on top.  BOTH times, it was EXCELLENT!  So easy, so good...

I have had this recipe for years (upside down German Chocolate cake and Volcano cake) but had never "swirled" the cream cheese....I'm sure that will make it even better.....

Overall, a great idea, but using the earthquake cake comes out better.  I found it too dry and the cream cheese mixture didn't blend into the cake like I thought it would.  If I make it again, i will make sure the cream cheese mixture goes deeper into the cake mix and is swirled a lot more.  Also, it should make the nuts and coconut stick better.  Great with vanilla ice cream, though!

To me this is a 4 star recipe only if the cake is warm when served - if you don't heat it up I find the cake too dry and the cream cheese topping doesn't really mix in at all. I was also hoping for a richer more chocolaty cake. I might just try some of the other similar recipes on this site or experiment a bit with my own cake recipes. I am going to have to resist adding that cream cheese topping to everything though - absolutely love that in place of frosting!

I used pecans and extra coconut.  I don't think I swirled mine enough, because the cream cheese mostly stayed on the bottom/top.  I cooked for 50 minutes, but I think I overcooked it a bit.  It's flavor was awesome.

Just okay for me.  I used more coconut than called for but otherwise I followed the recipe to a tee.  The cream-cheese flavor is really pronounced and I would have expected the chocolate to be just as rich to balance the flavor.  Maybe I'll try a brownie recipe with the cream-cheese topping next time.

I followed the directions with only one minor change, I decreased the amount of coconut.  This cake smelled wonderful while cooking.  But it didnâ€™t taste as wonderful as it smelled. The cream cheese tasted just awful mixed in, and my husband and I both love cream cheese. This would have definitely been better omitting the cream cheese and adding sour cream, chocolate chips, etc. I will not be making this again.
