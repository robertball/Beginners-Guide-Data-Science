I love this recipe. I found the recipe Sunday and have already made 2 batches of rolls and 2 loaves of bread. I don't have a bread machine, so I use my standmixer. I put the dough hook on warm the milk and honey, proof the yeast for 10 min., add the eggs and butter, measure all dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to make sure distributed, slowly add flour mix in 3 batches.Then I knead with the standmixer 7-10min.To make sure gluten is developed take a golf ball sized piece of dough and stretch in opposite directions using your thumb and forefinger of both hand. If it stretches thin enough to see light through without it tearing right away it is ready.)Then I just followed directions for the rolls or I made loaves. Thank you again. Know my kids only want mom's bread and not store bought bread. We all had fun making it.

This recipe has earned a permanent spot in my recipe file!  Delicious and versatile--I've rolled and cut them, made them into dinner rolls, or shaped them into hoagie buns.  I wanted mine wheatier, so I make them with 3 C. whole wheat flour and 1 C. white flour.  I also increased the yeast to 1 1/2 tsp to make up for the heavier wheat flour.

This is a delicious recipe, it is great for any purpose. If you are not using a bread machine, proof the yeast in the warm mil for about 10 minutes and then add the butter, egg and honey. Mix the wet ingredients then add the dry ingredients. I kneaded the dough with my stand mixer for about 5-7 minutes. I use my oven as a proof box by preheating it to 200 with a pan of water on the bottom rack and then turning it off and placing the dough in a greased, glass bowl, turn the dough over so the top is greased, cover with a clean, smooth fabric kitchen towel and let proof for about an hour. punch the dough down and shape into either loafs or rolls and place back in the oven to proof for another hour before baking. Hope this helps!

Nice texture and lightly sweet flavor made the rolls kid-friendly. Next time I would make them larger (4 inches at least) to make a better size for sandwiches, and eliminate the melted butter on top, which made them greasy to handle for lunches.

Perfect.  I used the ring of a wide-mouth Mason jar to cut out the rolls, they were the perfect size for burgers.

My daughter loved these buns instead of bread for her lunchbox sandwiches!!  I made a few batches to put in the freezer so everone could just help themselves.  I didn't have any whole wheat flour so I just used white.  Instead of lightly greasing the pan I sprinkled cornmeal on the pan.  Thank you for a great addition to my recipe box!!

I made these as dinner rolls for Thanksgiving, and they were a big hit.  They were very soft and the taste was excellent, my son usually turns his nose up at anything with whole wheat in it, but he sure ate these! I have another batch in the bread machine now that I will try as sandwich rolls.  Thanks for the great receipe!

I used my Kitchen Aid to make these rolls. I proofed the yeast (I used a whole packet of yeast which is 2 1/4 tsp.) in the mixer bowl with the honey and warm milk for ten minutes until the yeast "bloomed", then I added the egg, melted butter, then the dry ingredients. I did use 2 cups whole wheat flour and 1 3/4 cup organic whole wheat white flour. I kneaded this dough with my dough hook for about five minutes (I did have to add two tablespoons more flour to get it into a ball and be able to be kneaded with the hook). I set it to rise for an hour in a large greased bowl covered with a tea towel on a warm heating pad for an hour. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup to make uniform rolls (dinner rolls instead of sandwich rolls) and rolled them on the counter to make better shaped rolls. I covered the top of the rolls in the muffin tin with saran wrap before letting it rise on the warm heating pad for another hour or so. I baked them at 400 degrees for 12 minutes. These rolls were really very good! I had one right out of the oven spread with butter and it was just heaven. Very good rolls! We didn't quite get them all eaten tonight at dinner (this recipe made 11 rolls) but I did cut the rolls into thick chunks and used them in a breakfast strata in the morning. NOTE: I will say that I did not get 24 rolls out of this recipe, I got 12. That was fine for me because that was all I needed. For someone else who wants a recipe that make a larger quanitity, be sure to double this recipe.

I made this as a complete loaf in the bread maker machine as I didn't have time to make the rolls by hand. The only difference is that I put 1/3 cup of honey as I like my bread sweet and 2 tsp of yeast to get a good rise. I put the settings on 2.0lbs and light and came out PERFECTLY DELECTABLE! The whole thing took 3 hours in my bread machine.

Made lovely soft lunch rolls, and i didnt overknead them *think this helped the softness* followed the recipe to a T except didnt beat the egg first and maybe added a smidgen more flour to aid kneading.   i dont have a bread maker so started with activating the yeast, milk and honey first, then add everything else, knead 5 min, allow to rise, shape then 2nd rising and baking etc (just for those new to baking who, like me at first were bewildered by all the bread maker recipes and didnt know what to do!)

This recipe makes a mildly sweet roll that was fantastic as hamburger buns.  The buns have great texture and hold up well to the juicy burgers.  I don’t use a bread machine so I proofed the yeast until foamy in the milk and honey which I warmed to 110º.   I mixed in the flours in my KA, partially kneading in the machine, and finishing the knead by hand to get the correct texture.  I’ll be making these again – they’re delicious.

Love these so much I had to resist making a second batch the minute we finished dinner!  This will be made again and again in our house.  I have an unnatural fear of my bread machine, and although I actually got it out and had intentions of using it for the kneading part, I chickened out.  I didn't have bread machine yeast, so I used 3/4 T. active dry yeast.  I added all of the ingredients together after I proofed the yeast and hand kneaded for about 8 minutes.  I let it rise for about one half hour, then rolled out the dough, cut out the rolls with a glass, and let them rise for an hour.  DELICIOUS!

These rolls were great! We don't have a bread machine, so we used our Kitchen Aid mixer and kneaded it for about 10 mins, put them in a greased bowl to raise for an hour, shaped them and raised them for about an hour. We actually shaped them into Hoagie rolls. They were so soft and wonderful! And they're so versatile...I'll be using this recipe again, maybe for dinner rolls or hamburger buns. Oh the possibilities!

Great recipe for a semi sweet roll that is chewy with a smooth consistency.  A good, healthy alternative to the white "fluff" breads that are so common.  My 14 year old daughter loves to make these rolls as all the heavy work is done by the bread machine. She also loves the taste and will eat them as soon as they come out of the oven.

This is the sandwich roll/bun recipe I have been waiting for for years!!  I have a whole wheat one that is good, but it doesn't compare to this.  All 6 kids plus husband said this was one of the best rolls they have eaten in their lives.  **Make sure you let these rise long enough.  Mine rose for 1 hour in a warm-ish oven, and they were huge and beautiful.  I used the recipe precisely as written, and it was great!

I agree with the earlier reviews that these are a bit dense for sandwiches... But I still enjoyed them! The flavor was great, and it complimented our Italian Pork Sandwiches nicely. :) I don't have a bread maker, so I put everything in the MixMaster and let it do it's thing (after blooming the yeast in warm water and subtracting the 1/4 cup water from the amount of milk). I let the dough rise once, punched it down, and let it rise again. Instead of rolling it out, I broke off small balls of dough (a batch made 10 buns for us) and flattened them to 1 inch thick. I let the buns rise again on the baking sheet, and then baked. Next time, I'll lower the oven to 325 as the bottoms were browning much too fast for the rest of the buns. I had to flip them all over on the sheet to avoid burning! Oh, well... They still tasted awesome! Brushed with butter and sprinkled with sesame seeds, these buns were great nuked for 10 seconds and smeared with Country Crock! Thanks for the recipe!

Oh my goodness - what a FANTASTIC recipe!  Yeast is my biggest fear in the kitchen - so I asked for help on "the buzz".  Many wonderful ladies came to my rescue.  Fellow (AR)er Gitano suggested this roll.  I made it EXACTLY as written. Because I fear yeast, I was not about to tweak anything on this.  When it was time to cut the rolls I used a drinking glass to cut the circles.  It made the perfect size for a sandwich bun.  They were light and fluffy with amazing taste.  When I make this again as a bun I won't brush with melted butter when finished.  If making this as a roll, I would do that step.  Additional uses:  I split and made garlic rolls under the broiler one evening and also spilt and toasted to have with homemade jelly for breakfast.  This recipe is so good and I'm grateful Gitano suggested it.  I felt such a sense of accomplishment looking at the finished product.

I made these for Thanksgiving.  They were a huge hit.  I didn't roll them out, I just broke them into 12 pieces and let them rise in a 9X13 dish & then baked them.  Wonderful.  I just used normal yeast, but I do that for all my bread machine recipes.  Thank you for a great recipe!

I make all of our breads and this recipe has become a staple in our house. I use it to make dinner rolls, hamburger buns, and hotdog buns. I'm always asked to make these rolls and bring them to dinner parties. The only thing I change with this recipe is adding about 1/4 a cup of ground flax seed. Makes it even more tender and yummy! Wonderful recipe!

These are a really good, all purpose picnic/dinner  roll.  Much better than store bought and much less $$...
I made the dough in my Kitchen Aid mixer and doubled the recipe.
For those who are first time bakers, if it is a humid day you may need to add more flour to knead the dough properly and get it where it is supposed to be.  I have found this to be true of any flour based recipe.  In Wintertime, when the air is dry, versus in the Spring or Summer when it is humid, flour based recipes like bread, rolls and cakes behave differently based on humidity.  
5 stars for the first batch- I have 4 more batches to make and bake and freeze before our son's graduation~ Thank you for the wonderful recipe!!!

When I first started making these, I thought that they would be too sweet for the pulled pork I made.  But they are very good.  If anyone is reluctant about making yeast sandwich rolls, use this recipe for sure!  I am lucky to have a new Kitchenaid mixer, and so I heated the milk in my microwave in a Pyrex cup, added the yeast (I did use 2 teaspoons) and the honey.  While that proofed, I mixed the rest of the ingredients together and then dumped the whole works into my mixer.  It took only about five minutes to get it done.  I let it rise until doubled and then followed the rest of the directions.  This is an easy, tasty recipe!  You must try it!

Flavor on these were good. I will add more yeast to the mix next time though. I had huge problems getting them to rise so I ended up with fairly flat rolls. Next time more yeast and bigger rolls.

Made these for dinner tonight.  I didn't have bread flour so I subbed AP and vital wheat gluten.  Instead of rolling and cutting with a biscuit cutter, I pinched off the dough, rolled it into a ball then flattened to 3/4 inch. They turned out light and fluffy.  DD said this recipe is a keeper.

I made them for smothered steak sammies and hubster was oooh'ing and aww'ing while eating them! :) the batch made 12 small rolls and with scraps of dough leftover from rolling/cutting, I braided what was left into 3 'braided bread sticks'...YUM! definitely a keeper!

I have been baking bread for 15 years, and this is by far the BEST recipe I have ever made!  Even my toddlers are crazy about it, not to mention me and my husband.  I followed the recipe exactly except that I mixed it in my Kitchen Aide mixer since I don't have a bread machine.    When using my mixer it requires more flour than the recipe calls for (to get the dough to clean the sides of the bowl) but the results are light and airy.  I also used the tips in the Allrecipes article section on forming dough rounds http://allrecipes.com/HowTo/Forming-Dough-Rounds/Detail.aspx  I highly recommend their simple technique for creating beautiful, light, and airy bread/rolls.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe!

Simple, easy, came out perfect. Great recipe that will go in my BM recipe book to make again and again. Only thing I changed was using margarine instead of real butter. The dough seemed too moist and sticky as the machine was mixing it. So I added 1 Tbsp. of bread flour at a time to the dough ball until it looked right. I only needed 2 Tbsp. It may have been a measuring slight on my part and not the fault of the recipe. When I saw how pretty the dough rose I wished I’d made a loaf of bread! I may try it. I formed 6 logs and made hoagie rolls. (Add a little extra baking time until they are golden brown.) These rolls are noticeably sweet and very soft.  For my meatball subs the tomato sauce made them mushy and the sweetness didn’t go very well.  I will make them again when I am planning a drier sandwich that the sweet roll will compliment. Ham and Swiss with a nice Dijon mustard comes to mind. Yummmm.

The Rolls turned out wonderful!  They taste great and are easy to make.  I would have rated it higher but my dough turned out very sticky and hard to work with. I think I just needed more flour.  I will make them again though

Absolutely wonderful!  I made the mistake (I believe) of addidint a half tsp of vital wheat gluten - - - mine turned out light and fluffy, more like dinner rolls, but that was my fault.  Next time will make exactly as directed :)  Thanks so much for recipe!

I love trying new recipes for breads and rolls and this one will be added to my recipe book!  These are very good and taste better than any sandwich shop's rolls!  They are also simple to make.  I divided the dough into 8 portions and made hoagie rolls.  They are a little big so next time I will make 9.  We will probably make this our "go to" recipe for hamburger and hot dog buns to.  Thanks for sharing!

These are really good.  I made them by hand, and they were very easy.  I used olive oil instead of butter. I also used 1/2 white kernel wheat flour, and 1/2 bread flour.  They were very soft and had a great taste.  Out of one recipe I got 4 hoagie rolls, 4 hamburger buns and a small loaf of bread. They were just as good the next day.

This bread came out great.  I don't have a bread maker, so I made it the old fashioned way.  Dissolve honey in warmed milk, stir in 1T (dry-active) yeast and let that rise.  Add egg, butter and salt to the liquid.  Mix in flour one cup at a time.  Allow to rise in an oiled bowl, punch down and kneed before shaping in to form of your choice, I made a loaf.  Also, if you don't have bread flour, all-purpose flour works fine in this recipe.  I will make this bread again for sure!

These were so delicous with just more honey on them! A little too sweet for sandwich buns for us, though. But, we don't like the "Hawiaan sweet rolls" that they sell pre-packaged either. If you like rolls with sweetness baked IN them you probably, will love these.

The only changes I made was using 2c of WW flour and 1 3/4c AP flour with about 3/4c wheat bran added in and 1T gluten. I made 19 dinner-sized rolls that were soft and light, even a day later.

Very good, though I did make a few changes.  I do not have a bread machine, so I made these without and it worked fine.  I used 3/4 T yeast, because I was not sure what "bread machine yeast" is.  I also used 1/2 c oat bran and 2 c whole wheat flour to increase the health factor.  Even with this, they rose very well and came out light and great for sandwiches!  The idea of using a cookie cutter with yeast dough was new to me, but actually was good for getting rolls that rose evenly and were not so fat in the middle.  It was easy to make rolls that were not so much bread.

This recipe is so quick and easy, and it turned out great rolls! I used orange blossom raw honey, and the flavor is very distinct and fresh. The recipe yielded about 18 rolls, but I think next time I will cut them larger - I used the rim of a glass to cut them. One tray looked like it wasn't going to rise, but as soon as I put them in the oven, they puffed right up! This recipe is a keeper, I'm putting it in my cookbook now!!

This is my new favorite bread recipe.  It has a wonderful taste and texture and the addition of the milk and egg makes this wheat bread taste better than most.  I added more yeast because I was making this as one loaf in my bread machine and wanted to make sure it rose well.  I used 2 tsp. total.  I really enjoyed this bread and it made a great turkey-bacon-swiss sandwich today.

These are so easy and so good! Shaped them as hoagie rolls for meatball sandwiches. They came out soft and tasty and held up well even with the meatballs and sauce. These would be great as hot dog or hamburger buns, too.

One word - AWESOME! I don't use bread machine yeast, so I used 2-1/4 tsp of regular dry yeast. These turned out so well, and were so easy, that I'll never buy another roll again! I shaped them into hot dog buns, as well as hamburger buns. Fantastic!!!

I love this recipe.  I have occasionally substituted raw buttermilk or water for the milk or used whole wheat pastry flour for more (or all) of the total flour called for, and they are always good.  I like to make a whole batch and freeze them in foil packages of 2 to just defrost when my husband and I have hamburgers.  Beats the store-bought rolls any day!

I absolutely hate to give a recipe such a low rating, but these just didn't come through for me. I kinda just think that the title may be a misnomer, but nevertheless, I was very disappointed. The texture of these "Sandwich Rolls" is far too dense for sandwiches. The bread completely "drowned" the meat and fillings of my sandwich. I then tried to eat my sandwich open-faced, and it was still hard to swallow. I felt like I needed to slather mayo on the bread if I wanted to get it down. The taste was fine, but the texture is NOT suitable for sandwiches. Others have mentioned that they used this recipe for actual dinner rolls. That might be the best way to go with this recipe. Again, the taste was fine, it was just TOO, TOO DENSE! I had really high hopes for this one. Too bad. I was very disappointed.

These were very good!  I have a bit of experience with yeast, but it's been awhile.  I made these as rolls for a dinner party, and they were light in texture and delicious.  I used my stand mixer with two packets of regular yeast and AP flour instead of bread flour.  I proofed the yeast in the warm milk, then added the butter and egg, then added the combined dry ingredients to the mixer bowl, one heaping tablespoon at a time.  After one rise, I formed into informal balls and placed in greased muffin tins. Since they were risen well before dinner, I partially baked until some structure developed, then interrupted the baking.  I finished them later with my convection oven.  Nice, tender rolls with a good crust.  Thanks for the idea!

Absolutely AMAZING rolls!  I made exactly as instructed in my bread maker (putting in wet ingredients first--milk, butter, egg, honey--then the salt, flour and yeast on top).  Brushed lightly with butter once out of the oven. So good, soft, and delicious.  Will definitely be making these again.  UPDATE:  Just made this recipe into 2 loaves of bread - baked at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes and was perfect.  Note:  I did mix the dough in bread machine, then formed into 2 loaves and let rise another 2-3 hours.  These loaves are light and fluffy!

Yum!! I used a 3" cutter and they were large hamburger bun size.  I would use a smaller cutter for lunch sandwiches.

We can't get enough of these rolls in our house!!!  So very easy, and so versatile!  Large rolls for sandwiches, smaller rolls as a side for dinner, and so yummy.  Thanks so much!

Love the taste for anything from hamburger buns to sandwiches to dinner rolls. I'd skip the melted butter on top and brush them with an egg wash before baking for a nice gloss. Sesame seeds, available in the spice aisle, make a nice addition to the top, too.

Don't think the rolls rose as much as they were suppose too and they took longer to make then was estimated but otherwise taste and texture are excellent on them.

Amazing! The first time I made these the yeast didn't activate, and the rolls came out flat but everyone LOVED them. So made them again and they were even better puffy.

These make THE BEST burger buns. I do not brush them with butter as it makes them greasy. The only change I make is to use 1 c whole wheat, 1 c white wheat and 2 c bread flour. They are so soft and taste divine!

These taste wonderful with a nice honey taste. I cut my dough with a wide mouth mason jar which is nice if you want buns but too small for a nice sandwich bun. These will be a staple for our house. I did sub 1/4 c of bread flour for wheat germ. Can't notice it.

Loved these.  Fluffy but soft enough to smush down to fit in your mouth.  Substituted flax seed for one of the tablespoons of butter. Used an egg wash and added some quick cooking oats to the top.  Skipped the melted butter.  Would love to make these weekly. Got 12 rolls out of the recipe.

These have a delicious taste and texture, and I will be making them again. I made these according to the directions of cutting with a biscuit cutter, and made a small loaf with some leftover. I won't be cutting them out again, they are too small this way and more like dinner rolls. The brushing of melted butter works for dinner rolls version, but I won't use for sandwich rolls - too greasy.

After reading so many amazing reviews, I opted to make this recipe with only one change - I substituted Agave Nectar for the honey, because of dietary restrictions in our family.  The recipe for 14 servings made 14 rolls and 3 mini loaves.  I used a 4.5" diameter can to cut the rolls.  My only advice which I will do differently next time is not to roll the dough as thin as they suggest.  Rolling to 3/4", when it rises even double again makes a low, flat roll only 1 1/2" high.  I would either roll it thicker, or not roll it at all, just shape the rolls by hand (which would likely be far easier as the dough is incredibly springy!).  My VERY picky family gobbled up the 14 rolls and 2 mini loaves (we gave one to a friend) in 2 days and have begged me to make more.  This time I'm going to double the recipe and make 2 full sized loaves of bread and as many hand-shaped rolls as I can get.  No need to bother freezing - these will be gone before they can get moldy!  Outstanding recipe, easy, delicious, and already a favorite in this family!

I really love this recipe.  It was easy and fun to make.  I was out of honey so I subbed molasses with good results - nice flavor and brown color. These rise up really well, so I think it is better to roll the dough out to 1/2" thickness. Next time I will omit the butter on top it made the rolls a little greasy, and I don't think it added anything to the taste.

Excellent rolls. I made these by hand and I only needed 2 1/2 cup of bread flour. I got 8 hamburger size buns out of it.  I used oil instead of butter.  Everything else was the same.  The dough was very easy to work with.  The buns came out soft and tender with a nice flavor to it.  Keeper recipe.  Thank you.

I made these for thanksgiving dinner this year, everyone loved them. I omitted the egg, made the dough in my Kitchenaid stand mixer cause I don't have a bread machine. Shaped the rolls and baked them in a muffin tin. Very good recipe.

These are perfect for sandwiches. They hold together very well, and have great flavor and texture. I've made them 3 times now, and my only suggestion is to add a bit more salt (+about 1/4 t.). Those trying to keep salt down may not agree, but for us, it really brought out the flavor. I don't have a bread maker any more, so I kneaded by had for about 5 minutes or so, adding sprinklings of flour so I could work the dough. Easy though, no problems.

These are really good, and the texture is about as perfect as it can get....but mine didn't rise a whole lot which made them difficult to use for a sandwich.  I still did, and they held up to sloppy joe's quite well, it was just not a lot to them.  I toasted one that was leftover and thought it was really similar to an English muffin....very good.  I'll make them again, but might add some gluten or something to the dough since I have heard that helps with rising.  Thanks much!

These rolls were light and wonderful!  Just the dinner roll I have been looking for!  Using a biscuit cutter, I get 20 rolls.  They freeze great; since it is only my husband and I, I can take 2 or 3 out for dinner, wrap them in foil, and heat them in the over for 15 min. or so, and they taste just as fresh as when first made!

Awesome! I used a smaller glass to cut them out and only rolled out to about 1" thick and they were the best dinner rolls I've ever made- both in taste and presentation.  I threw all the ingredients in my KitchenAid and it worked great too...

I just made these rolls, and they are excellent.  Followed the recipe ingredients with one exception.  Substituted molasses for honey. Since my bread machine has died, I made the dough with my Kitchen Aid mixer (kneaded 17 mins. on lowest speed).  Delicious taste & texture.  A winner!!!

This is an EXCELLENT roll recipe. I simply made dinner rolls out of the dough, used molasses instead of honey,(was out of honey) AND THEY WERE TERRIFIC! This would be an all around roll good for just about any meal. Flavor, texture, lightness, aroma, its all there! Thanks for sharing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Great recipe! I like to weigh, so for those of you with a scale, the bread flour measures 15 oz., the whole wheat flour is 5 oz., and the honey is 3 oz. I found I needed to add about 1/4 c. more flour as I was kneading. I've made hamburger buns, hot dog buns, and I think this would make a great loaf for sandwich bread, too. Thank you!!

I'd agree w/ everyone else - wonderful rolls!  That said, I made some adjustments based on ingredients I had available.  I had a scant 1/3 cup WW flour, so I used that, plus I ground up about 1/3 cup flax seeds, and 1 3/4 cup oats (ground) - to equal about 1 3/4 cup whole grain, and then I decreased the white flour to 2 cups.  Or thereabouts.  It worked, they're delicious!  That's the fun thing about cooking - you can play with these recipes and take advantage of ingredients you have on hand!

Very good hamburger buns! My 3-year-old granddaughter loved them.  I did NOT roll the dough out. Instead I formed the dough into 12 buns and placed them on a cookie sheet to rise. They were a good size for a double patty burger and held up very well with burger toppings. We will definately make these again.

Superior flavor and very easy. I don't like bread machines so I adapted the directions for a stand mixer and more traditional method still using the same ingredients, per directions below, and it was AMAZING.

We have a new favorite in our household!!  I followed the recipe exactly except for not warming the milk since my bread machine does that for me.  I took another reviewer's suggestion and cut out the rolls using a wide-mouth canning jar which was the perfect size.  Absolutely wonderful and a great base for experimenting with adding garlic, herbs, etc.  Next time I will adjust the white-to-wheat flour to increase the wheat flour content and see how that goes.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!

Very, very, VERY good! Made these smaller, for Thanksgiving dinner and while my baking inexperience may have led to rolls that were not perfectly shaped, they were delicious and perfect for small sandwiches with the leftovers!

Very good--I changed the ratio of white and whole wheat (flipped it basically) and added 1 tbsp gluten for each cup of whole wheat flour. Still fabulous!

These are delicious. Very soft, perfect for sandwiches or as dinner rolls. To save time, I didn't bother rolling out the dough. I just made 12 rolls by hand.

Wow, what a great recipe!  My children love this.  I followed the suggestions by switching the volume of the two different flours around for a larger proportion of whole wheat flour.  Plus I added 2 tablespoons of gluten.  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

We absolutely love these rolls!  I made them last night for the guys' burgers and they came out perfect.  They are nice and light and airy and have the perfect hint of sweetness from the honey.  These are definitely going to be a keeper in my house!

These came out great!  I used regular yeast because I didn't have bread machine or rapid rise yeast on hand.  I added 1/4 tsp. more yeast to compensate.  They were still a little thin but I may have rolled them a bit too thin.  The texture was good even being thin.  I will definitely be making these again, so next time I will use 2 tsp. regular yeast and roll a little thicker.

Yum! Perfect dough and was so easy to roll and then cut. I brushed the tops when done with melted butter mixed with a drizzle of honey to really emphasize the flavor.

I’ve been looking for a good recipe for hamburger buns. This is it!! We love them. We used 1 ¾ cups white whole wheat flour and 2 cups of all purpose flour (didn’t have bread flour). My husband is learning to bake since he retired and he is so pleased with the results of this recipe that he brags to everyone that will listen. He has made these rolls twice now, and they turn out great each time. The first time we had them with Pulled BBQ Chicken. It was wonderful. The second time we had hamburgers. I’ll never buy hamburger buns again. It makes eleven 4 inch rolls. Thank you for sharing.

Yum yum! I followed the recipe exactly- let my bread machine do the mixing.  They didn't rise a lot, but that may be due to ingredients or the temperature in my kitchen.  My fiance ate them all in 2 days!

These rolls are amazing.  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly and they turned out fluffy, light, and slightly sweet.  I didn't bother with rolling out the dough and cutting them - I simply plop the dough on a greased and floured baking sheet and then divide the dough into small round balls...saved time and the rolls still came out beautiful.

This recipe was fabulous!  It seriously lives up to the hype.  As with any bread recipe, be careful with the flour and liquids as too much or too little can ruin it.  Not every baker will require the exact amount of flour, so just keep an eye on the dough during mixing to ensure it forms a firm (but slightly sticky) ball.  I think I used just a little less flour than called for and a little more milk.  Delicious!  I'm off to go make another batch and see how it freezes.

Excellent!  I don't know if I'll ever buy store rolls again.  I used some and froze some to see how they turn out after being frozen.  NExt time I may try to add more whole wheat flour to make them a little more healthier.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was very good bread, but I found it to be a little heavy coming out of our bread machine. We made it as a full loaf as opposed to rolls. I would make it again and play with it a little.

Got a bread machine as a gift 12 years ago but never used it.  Got tired of the grocery running out of the rolls I like so I came here to find a good recipe and this was rated best and liked what I saw in the reviews.  So far I've made them 3 times.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly and loved them.  The second and third times I tried them with sauted onions and then sauted garlic and loved them too.  No more rolls from the grocery for me.  Hint.  I like sloppy joes except they're so sloppy so I came up with a solution.  Don't slice the rolls all the way through, slice into them through only one side and with a spoon press the insides. Then fill with the sloppy joe meat.  No more mess.  Not bad for a bachelor.  Now if only I could find a girl that can cook as well as I do.  They love how well I cook but are also intimidated by it.  They feel like I don't need them.  Well, I guess it depends on what your'e talking about .

I used the dough cycle of my bread machine and then baked in the oven.  I made smaller, dinner rolls out of the dough, and used 1 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups bread flour.  I made up a whole bunch of these and am keeping them in the freezer to have quick rolls for dinner.  Thanks for a great recipe!

These rolls are soft and light.  I followed guidelines provided by another reviewer and used my kitchenaide mixer as I do not have a bread machine.  AMAZING!  This recipe will get lots of use in our house!

These have become a staple at our house and we use them in place of burger buns, sandwich thins and bread.  They are, quite simpl, excellent and and fool proof.  I use 2 3/4 c. whole wheat bread flour and 1 c. white bread flour for a healthier bun, and it works perfectly every time, resulting in a suprisingly soft texture.  Delicious!

Made these by hand and they turned out great.  Used all whole wheat flour and subbed olive oil for the butter.  They tasted amazing!

Great! Used wide mouth mason jars - Perfect! Recipe  made 11 rolls and I used them as hamburger buns (my husband really liked them). Baked a little longer than stated because I wanted a nice firm outside.

1/13/11 - Still making these when I want whole wheat buns.. they are great! Best for us as hamburger buns when separated into 8 peices.

I made these by hand b/c I do not have a bread machine so I mixed all the dry ingrediants in one bowl and all the wet in another then mixed them together. Knead them for about 10-15 min and everything else is the same

I used this recipe in my breadmaker using the dough cycle.  I baked the dough as bread in a loaf pan and everything turned out great. It is now my husband's favorite and he asks for it frequently.

Until this recipe, I've been "challenged" as a bread baker. This recipe works for me! I can't mess it up! Thanks for posting! Try this, you won't be disappointed...I was out of wheat flour but all-purpose white flour worked great.

Very tasty and moist!!! I made as a loaf, cooked @350 for 23 mins. I didn't have a problem with the rising, the only change I made was used brown sugar in place of honey (all out), still will make again and again

Frickin' perfection. The flour amount was spot on (sooo rare to find). I added 1/4 cup of ground flax for added fiber. They were fluffy, yet substantial enough to hold up to burgers. The taste was just very slightly sweet - I didn't even notice the sweetness until I had one with a burger. Dough is springy and a charm to work with (did it all by hand). I will be making these again and again. Thank you! - Perfect with Actually Delicious Turkey Burgers. Mm!

This is a flavourful bread. I did this over the weekend, modified it a little to increase the fibre content by reducing the bread flour to 21/2 cup and whole wheat flour to 1/2 cup and substituted 1/4 cup raw wheatgerm, and  1/2 cup oats (pulsed in food processor). Still turned out great.

I followed the exact directions and these came out flat and dense.  Who knows what I did.  The flavor was still good and I'll definatley try again, this time mixing the yeast in with the dry ingredients like I usually do.  I wanted to use them for pulled pork sandwiches but instead I had to make a quick batch of biscuits.

EXCELLENT!!! I shaped these into 24 dinner rolls. I also increased the yeast to 1 1/2 tsps as some have suggested. They were light and soft, yet had a very nice wheat flavor. This recipe will be replacing my regular white roll dough! Yumm!

This is my absolute favorite bread recipe.  I have made it as sandwich rolls (using a large tuna can for a cutter), dinner rolls baked in a muffin tin, two perfect size bread loaves, and baguettes for awesome subs.  I love this recipe, the bread is so soft and sweet!

Simply the best hamburger or sandwich rolls we have ever eaten.  They turned out light and airy.  The only change I made was to brush the tops with egg white and sprinkle on poppy seeds.

Fabulous bread.  Love it for sandwiches and dinner rolls also.  I had made a pan of rolls and had dough left over.  I rolled them into med. balls (1 dozen) and put into a round cake pan.  Let them rise and ate them with supper.  They were a BIG HIT.  This is a keeper for me.

I'm torn with this recipe.  It makes a delicious looking and delicous tasting bread.  However, it just seemed a little heavy for a sandwich, the bread overwhelmed the fillings.  However, I have not given up hope.  Next time I will use the least amount of flour possible and allow the dough to rise twice.  Doing this should make the bread lighter.
The only thing I changed about the recipe was replacing some of the honey with granulated sugar because I ran out of honey.  I didn't have a biscuit cutter, so I used a baby bowl instead, which worked perfectly.  I also only got 9 buns out of the recipe instead of 14.

Thanks P. for a great recipe. I did use the changes 1c flour, 3c wholewheat flour and molasses instead of honey that was suggested in the reviews. Came out wonderful!!!  Formed into rolls and baked in buttered glass pans.  Made 14.  Will be using the recipe to make hamburger buns.  Thanks to all who submit great recipes and the helpful suggestions.  I do read all the reviews because there are great tips there!!!! 
Happy cooking and baking.

Awesome recipe!  These taste just like the refined version of yeast rolls found in restaurants.  I crave these!  The dough is super easy to work with too.  I didn't roll them out, just pinched and formed into rolls.  Serve with honey butter and use the leftovers for sandwiches!

I read the recipe too fast, and used water instead of milk. I worried the whole time these were rising. I had to had more flour, and thought it was ruined. BUT THEY WERE NOT! I used them for the Kalua pork roast from this site. It was awesome, and hubby HATES pork roast. Thanks for a great recipe. I wonder how amazing these will be when I actually use milk. lol

These are so good!  They have more of a dinner roll sweetness to them, but I have used them for sandwiches and burgers with no complaints.  I will definitely be trying this recipe as a loaf, per another reviewer.

Very tasty bun. On the denser side but will make again to see if I can get it fluffier.

This was perfect for what I was looking for- a wholesome, soft roll to use as both a bun and for sandwiches. 

My only deviation from the recipe was that I used an entire packet of active dry yeast (1/4 oz) and I divided the dough into 12 balls instead of cutting 14 biscuits. 10 minutes in the oven was perfect.

Excellent recipe. I changed nothing and nothing needs changing! Flavorful, soft, tender, chewy. Just delicious. These rolls were still fresh tasting the next day as well.

5 stars  

My family loves these.  I shape them into 8 buns instead of cutting them out.  Quick and easy and large enough for my grown family to make a meal out of one bun.

Very good buns!  I had never made buns before and this was my first time & recipe!  They seemed a little dense but it's probably something that I can change as time goes on.  Maybe I put too much flour.  Anyways, a very tasty bun!!

Absolutely delicious! Perfect for the meatball subs I was using them for. I followed the directions exactly, but I did have to cook them a bit longer than directed, probably 5 minutes. I made 12 rolls instead of 14, and they were the perfect size.

This is the only type of wheat bread my husband will eat! It's requested every time I make stew. And, we'll be making this bread for Thanksgiving leftover sandwiches.

Best hamburger buns we have ever had!  This recipe was DELICIOUS!  My husband, who has been a strictly white-bread boy all his life, loved these so much, he says he never wants store-bought again.

The first time I made these rolls my husband's friend came over for dinner ... he ate 10 rolls. Simple and tasty, I always have the ingredients on hand. With the bread machine doing the heavy-lifting part, I can spend my time focusing on making the meal and know my bread will come out perfect. This recipe has become a permanent staple in my home.

Pretty good as is. I'm gonna read up on some other reviews and I'll see. Our first batch with a new bread machine, so could be me, too. I'll let you know! A definite "must try" and I'll even say, "Try Again!"

These are pretty easy. I am a strict machine girl...not successful with 'real' bread baking.. 1st time I made 12 rolls in my 13x9x2 baked for 15 minutes...today i made 6 large buns and baked for 17- 20 minutes. they are out of this world... didn't have honey today so I used dark brown sugar.... still light, airy and strong enough for a burger!

I don't have a bread machine, but this recipe was delicious made by hand! I only changed white/wheat ratio by using 3 cups wheat flour and about 1/2 cup white flour. I have little ones, so we made 24 "dollar rolls" and the whole family loved them!

These are delicious and have the strength and density needed for sandwiches. I baked these for the first time last night and my husband and I immediately ate two apiece!! I followed the recipe exactly and can't see the need for any changes.

I just made these and they were *fantastic*. I think I probably could have stretched them out a bit more and made mine bigger and slightly flatter - but it was my first time trying sandwich rolls, and I was a bit nervous with them. Even so, they were delicious. My roommate loved them. They didn't even last two days.

Wow, these were great!  I don't have a bread machine so I used my KitchenAid mixer and as another reviewer stated for some reason you have to add more flour.  I made these into dinner rolls.  Served hot or cold they are great with honey butter. 3/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup honey, whipped. My all time favorite bread from this site WAS Amish White Bread, these just took the place of that.

I agree with another reviewer, this should be a 10!!! I made these buns exactly according to the recipe. Immediately after baking, I made another batch using Robin Hood flour instead of wheat. They turned out equally as good. My family loves them as well as my sister's family. Will make these again and again with slight variations. Next will be onion. This is a keeper!!!!!!

I used my tupperware hamburger maker ring, and this made nice big buns, although I only had 9 buns.  I am still trying to prefect this buns to make them rounded on the top.  Instead of placing them on a cookie sheet, I will try letting they rise in a baking pan. I am open to suggestions.  I love the taste of this  recipe, I would like the buns not to look so flat.

I made a double recipe of these since we have a lot of stuff for sandwiches in the fridge.  I thought they were good but bf said they were "hard".  I do believe he means dense.  I suppose for him I should've added some vital wheat gluten, but I never know . . .anyway, if I make again I'll add that vital wheat gluten for the picky bf.  I didn't add the butter bc I was planning on them for sandwhiches.  thanks for the recipe!

These were amazing. I used my largest round cookie cutter and they were perfect for packing sandwiches in lunches for my 2 teen boys. They even asked for them with dinners as plain ole dinner rolls. Oh yeah, we'll be making these again. And again.

It is back to school time and I wanted to make these for lunchbox sandwiches.  They are fantastic!  I ended up with 14 but next time I will cut them bigger (5" or more inches0.  They are just a little on the small side for sandwiches.  So far I've used them for meatloaf and turkey sandwiches.  So much more wholesome than store bought and so much tastier.

WOW!  This is the first bread recipe that I love!!  I have searched high and lo for the perfect roll recipe and this is it!!!  I used a whole packet of yeast and instead of butter, used 2 Tbsp of canola oil - everything else was the same.  It turned out well.  I got 20 rolls from this recipe.  I loved it!

These were good - I was a little worried that they didn't rise much but they turned out just fine. I put some oats on top and used them as hamburger buns! Very tasty.

These buns were delicious and my husband raved about them as well.  One addition I made was to add 4 tsp. vidal wheat gluten. I plan on making these rolls for our annual 4th of July get together. it will be a real treat from the store bought buns.

These buns tasted great and were easy to make with either a bread machine or big Kitchenaid mixer.  I froze some and they were fine too.

Wonderful, I accidently added 1/2 cup of honey instead of 1/4 and they were still great.  There's no nead to roll and cut them out, my rolls turned out beautifully and I just hand formed them.  I made big ones and got 7 out of the batch.

Yum! These rolls are very good! I used them as the base for the Lunch Box Handwich recipe from this site; the sandwiches were very tasty and my family really liked them. One thing I had a problem with was the amount of flour; I found that I needed an extra 1/2 cup in order for the dough to be firm enough. Other than that, this was a very easy and tasty recipe! Thanks for sharing!

My go-to recipe for fresh dinner rolls.  I follow the recipe exactly, but I allow the dough to rise twice, and the rolls always turn out very light and airy. I do not roll out the dough - I just divide it into 12 balls, then shape by hand. They freeze beautifully!

Really good rolls!  Baked these this morning and used them for ham and cheese sandwiches for lunch.  I made a few minor changes to make them a little lighter in fat. I substituted fat free half and half for the milk, used half whole wheat and half white bread flour, and added a TBSP of vital wheat gluten to aid in rising.  I had to use about a 1/4 cup more flour than the recipe called for to get my dough to come together. I rolled it and cut it into 4" disks with a large cup.  I got 11 rolls this size, and actually would have liked them a little bigger (next time!) They rose well and get fluffy and thick, but they don't spread much, so the size you cut them is pretty much what they're going to be. I also had to let them rise for 90 minutes to get them to double before baking. Brushed them with olive oil instead of butter when they came out of the oven.  Yummy! I think maybe I'd cut the honey a bit depending on what I'm filling the roll with.  The sweetness worked great with the ham, but if I were to use it for something like egg salad or bbq, I don't think I'd want it so sweet. My husband and 5 yr old disagree however, and will be happy to eat anything at all on these!  This recipe is a keeper!  Thanks so much!

Oh my gosh, these are good. I ran out of hamburger buns, so I decided to make some hamburger buns. Maybe I was being lazy or something. These are awesome.   These are sweet, and certainly double as dinner rolls. I do want to try them cut larger. But, my son didn't even realize they were wheat buns. And they did not last long at our house.

Very good recipe.  I've tried other bun/roll recipes and have been so disappointed... this one was great!  Dh didn't like the tops buttered, said they made his hands too greasy when eating a sandwich.  I will opt to cool with a damp cloth over them next time to get a softer crust without the extra shine. (worked well!)  But for taste and ease... it was wonderful!  Thanks!

These are very easy and delicious! We love them for hamburgers! One tipe is that once they rise up you need to go ahead and bake them immediately.  The first time I made these I left to run an errand and when I returnd they were huge...so big they flatened when baked.

Amazing! Incredible! Delicious! I let the bread machine do all the work and just rolled out 8 decent sized rolls from the dough. Added an egg wash and sesame and poppy seeds to the top. No butter on top as these were for Turkey Burgers. My daughter says she loves them, so I can see myself making these for her lunches instead. Thankyou.

Perfect! These were light and delicious. I substituted the egg with an additional 1/4 cup milk because one of my children has an egg allergy. That might have made them a little lighter than if I'd made them with the egg. We'll definitely make these again. I'll probably try using more whole wheat flour next time.

These are wonderful.  Am using this recipe to make cocktail buns for a birthday party.  Instead of the milk I used water (milk has a tendency to make the bread coarse)otherwise the recipe stayed the same.  I, also, rolled out to 3/4" thick & used a 2" biscuit cutter--perfect size for cocktail buns.  I made 4 batches w/the bread machine & it made around 140 buns.

So easy to make.  I have bread machine, but used the KitchenAid. This is what I did:  I warmed up milk, added the yeast, and honey. Even though I hvave instant yeast, I still let it sit for about 10 min.  Yeast good. Had it in a measure cup.  I poured it in the bowl. Then added butter, salt, egg. Then added the dry Ingred.to the wet. I added the flour mixture iwhile mixer was running. Of course with dough attachment. Had machine run for kneeding for about 10-15 min on speed 2  I live in high altitude so things are a bit different to bake a little.  Anyway, I let it raise in a glass bowl, lightly oiled with olive oil, covered with plastic wrap and put in lightly warmed oven. When done with that step, I weighed the dough to make sure they are even size. Divide the dough in 4 rolls. But 2 are round and 2 are football shape. Then let it raise for 1 1/2 hour. Baked at 350, I think for 14-15 min is what I did   When bread was 190, I took out of oven right in a cooling rack, I didn’t leave on cookie sheet since it’s still cooking., anyway. Wow. I would recommend you to try this recipe out. Going to make Chicken sandwiches tonight. Remember, if the rolls are too big, just cut them to size

These were good. Dough is easy to work with and baked up nicely. They were a little bland though. Increasing the salt a bit would be helpful.

My new favorite rolls. I used a 1/3 cup to cut out the rolls and got 24 mini sliders. Super cute. My family at three each. My kids have asked for these to be made more often and my husband is giving them two thumbs up. Followed the directions, made no substitutions and they turned out great.

These are my husband's favourite rolls! I make them every other week for him (he's always a little disappointed on the weeks I make other rolls!). I have to admit I didn't think he'd like them when I told him there was honey in them, but from  the first bite he's a major fan! Thank you for sharing this recipe ??

These are such tasty rolls! I did omit the butter after removing from oven (personal preference) and used virgin coconut oil and vegg in the dough in stead of butter and eggs, respectively. I used my stand mixer in stead of bread machine and proofed the dough in the oven on proof setting.

I thought these were alright. I was actually looking for a wheat roll for turkey burgers. These seem just a little to dense and heavy for that. These would be more appropriate for Thanksgiving as a heavier type of a dinner roll. I couldnt really taste the whole wheat, added, or honey. I did use a lighter color grain for the whole wheat, called white whole wheat. I think they tasted more like white rolls, though, due to the excessive proportion of bread flour. It was a little time consuming dividing and shaping. It came to basically 2 lbs of dough on my scale for 14 rolls. To cut like biscuits seemed awkward. I divided, shaped, placed on a parchment lined baking sheet sprayed with PAM, sprinkled with sesame seeds, and covered to rise with a sprayed piece of plastic wrap. They took 21 minutes, to bake each, on 2 pans.

Soft, fluffy, tasty.  They are a wonderful hamburger bun replacement.  I add crushed flax seeds to mine.  If you want them truly airy, let the dough rise twice before shaping it into buns.  Also, molasses is a good substitution for the honey if you want them a little less sweet, and darker.

These were really good though they were a little sweet to me.  Next time I may add a little more salt or cut back on the honey a bit to even them out.

Easy & delicious!!  I just hand-formed the dough into 12 sandwich buns; didn't use the butter on top. These were PERFECT!!  Nice & hearty (weren't falling apart!) for my pulled balsamic beef sandwiches. Who needs to run to the store for sandwich buns when you have this recipe???  Yummy!!

Made these to go with the Johnsonville Italian Sausage Sliders and they were AWESOME!  mine made 18 rolls using a Coca-Cola glass to cut out fifteen roughly 3" diameter circles, then hand-forming circles for the last three rolls.  About 13 minutes in my oven and they were done, and I could have eaten half a pan of them right then and there, they were delicious!!

I just made this last night as a loaf of bread and I can't wait to try it as buns. It is fantastic! As one of my children has a milk allergy I used Soy Milk instead of milk and margarine instead of butter and it turned out great. Will definitely be making this on a regular basis!

I baked this recipe as a loaf since i don't have good luck with rolls holding their shape. It baked beautifully. I was a little weirded out by the egg, but it really worked. I think this could make a good sandwich loaf. It did take forever to rise because it uses less yeast then usual. Overall, very good.

This recipe makes delicious buns and is super easy to make.  The dough is very easy to work with.  My daughter likes these so much she won't eat store bought buns any longer.  I do use KA white whole wheat flour for the whole wheat flour.

These are wonderful. My husband is a type 2 diabetic and so I switched the flour amounts... doing 2 3/4 c of wheat flour and 1 c of white flour instead. I used Agave Nectar instead of honey as well. They turned out great! This has becoming my favorite bread recipe!

These rolls were just wonderful- not too sweet but with a subtle honey flavour. I thought they were lighter and better tasting than the average whole wheat rolls.  The baked beautifully and kept well for a few days. I will certainly make them again.

Made these for my kids to take sandwiches on for lunch.  They are so good, and we cut them in half and put honey and butter on them to go with our soup tonight.  I plan on making a batch of these on the weekend to use throughout the week instead of buying the rolls in the store.

Wow, this recipe is great.  I've never made bread before and this was so easy and it came out excellent.  I'll definitely be using this recipe alot.  This is so much better than store bought bread.  I don't have a bread maker so I used my mixer with the kneading hook.  Again - excellent recipe, thanks for sharing.

These are amazing!  I just made them to use for supper tomorrow night and had to try one.  I had with ham and cheddar cheese -- yum!  I can't wait until the rest of the family tries them, I'm pretty sure I'll be making them from now on. :)

These are SO good! And they make super yummy hamburger buns! Even yummier leftover in the morning, toasted with butter and jam. Can't wait to make more!  Did not have a biscuit cutter- used the top of a drinking glass! Skipped the last 2 tablespoons of butter too- didn't think it needed it! :) Highly recommend!

I let mine rise for about an hour and 15 minutes before baking them for 10 minutes. They turned out perfect! We're already thinking of all the sandwiches we can make with them. It will be hard to go back to store-bought sandwich bread after having these!

These were pretty good - great flavor, but the crumb was a bit dense for me.  Next time I'm going to make them using just the egg white, beaten until stiff.  This might lighten them a bit more.  I did add half honey and half Molasses as I wanted a robust and hearty sweetness which was very good.  Thanks for sharing.

These were very easy to make andhe end result were quite good!  I only had AP flour, but it still came out tasty.  I had a problem with them rising, my yeast was fresh, but it was regular, not bread machine style.  Maybe that made a difference, because they took almost 3 hours to double in a warm place, and not quite as fluffy as I hoped for.  Still, pretty good!!  Thanks!!

These are incredibly good rolls!  My children asked me to make more, so after my first batch yesterday, I made them again today.  I only made slight changes according to some of the reviews.  I left my measuring spoons slightly rounded on the salt and the yeast, warmed the milk, and added 4 teaspoons vital wheat gluten.  I hand shaped them into 20 dinner rolls.  Thank you SEEFREE!.

I hate to be repetitive, but WOW these are great! I used the top of a very large glass to cut out larger buns, and I got 7, plus a medium sized loaf made from the cutout scraps. I was surprised that even the re-kneaded "leftover" loaf was light and airy.   This will definitely be on the go-to list.

So easy and soooooo good. Minor change was a little less white and a little more wheat flours. No butter on top either. Let rise in oven that I thought was barely warm but actually a little more than that. They rose very quickly at first but baked up perfectly light and fluffy. I cut into squares and hot dog sizes with a knife. Ate as dinner rolls and sandwiches. thanks SEEFREE.

I never take the time to rate anything, but these are just amazing.  They are easy to make, and turn out great every time.  Every time I make them, someone asks me for the recipe.

Absolutely wonderful. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out incredible.  The first time I tried cutting them out with a cutter, this time I am just going to tear the dough off and make small balls.  The dough is very easy to work with! They also freeze nicely (after baked).

These were okay, but I've had better wheat rolls.  I followed the recipe except I increased the wheat flour a bit and decreased the bread flour. I added a little more yeast to compensate.  I also skipped the melted butter at the end since I was making these as dinner rolls and offered butter at the table.  I found them a bit heavy and dense and the flavor was a little blah.  A perfectly good roll, but nothing fantastic.

Excellent!  My husband never likes my homemade bread, always preferring store bought, but he really liked these a lot!  The only change I made was to use all bread flour, no wheat flour.  I will make them again!

Prepared as is but made into 24 dinner rolls.  Soft and delicious.  This is my favorite roll recipe right now and I make it a couple times a week since it gets eaten so quickly.

The recipe was accurate and these were easy to make. I thought they would be lighter and found that I was disappointed that they were too dense for our family's liking. I have never had bread with honey and for me, I think it's a little too sweet. I'm still rating this a four because the recipe turned out well it just wasn't to our personal taste.

Since I found this recipe in July-09, I've made it twice and I'm making them today again for the third time. I double the recipe and use 3tsp. yeast since I don't have a bread machine. These have turned out wonderfully and everyone in my family loves them, especially my son who's requested them for his birthday for burgers. Very easy to make.

Wow, these are fantastic!!  I changed the flours around so used 2 3/4 c. whole wheat flour and 1 c. bread flour.  I used 1 T reduced fat butter sread and non-fat milk.  Made into perfect little sandwich rounds and they are so soft and delicious.  I did use one pkg of regular rise yeast also.

This was my first time making bread/rolls by hand (maybe in Home Ec?)  I am really glad I tried.  Now when we're in a pinch for bread or just feel like homemade, I can make my own.  I would love to do it every week as some reviewers say they do, but there's just not enough time in my days...and I am rather partial to a particular loaf of store-bought bread.  I will definitely make these as often as possible as the DH and children absolutely LOVED them. =)

My husband loves these rolls and asks for them instead of bread for sandwiches. They are light and soft and easy to make. I've used both honey and substituted molasses and both are delicious. I omit the butter. Update: Still making this recipe each week for sandwiches. It is great! I have experimented to make it healthier, with some good (and other disasterous) results. Substituted the milk for almond milk and soy milk perfectly. Substitited honey for molasses-much denser, but okay. I always substitute 1/4 of the bread flour with a 9 grain mix and gives a nice texture. Went health nutty one day and substituted the whole wheat flour for teff flour and the butter for veggie shortening--yikes! Do not attempt!

These are the most delicious rolls I have ever made.  Super easy and ridiculously good - I used the dough for "Lunch Box Handwiches" on this site and it turned out really good.

Soft, slighty sweet rolls that were fantastic as hamburger buns when sliced and lightly toasted. I divided dough into 8 balls and baked on a baking stone for buns just the right size. I gently rubbed a stick of butter over them when they were very hot, just out of the oven. Added just a bit of great taste, and "soaked" into the bun so when they had cooled there was no greasy feel.

These were very simple to make for a beginning breadmaker and very good.  We made chicken breast sandwiches with them and I froze the remaining rolls for a side to eat with meals for the next week.  Great recipe!

I am truly in love with these rolls.  My husband is a very happy man.   One suggestion, the biscuit cutter didn't turn out big enough for us, so we'll try a different method.  The rolls are delicious and light and oh my goodness, taste gourmet.  If you're just looking around, trust me, try this recipe, it's AWESOME!!!

great rolls.  I didn't use a cutter but instead divided in 8 and rolled them out by hand.  I needed to cook them a tiny bit longer, but they were amazing.

These rolls are great, and my husband loves them too. They're very soft and perfect for sandwiches or burgers. I followed the recipe exactly, and next time will experiment with more whole wheat to see how it affects the recipe.

Great recipe as is.  The only change I made was to omit the melted butter on the top to make the rolls a little healthier.

Awesome rolls!  Light, moist, with just a just a touch of sweetness.  This will become my go-to recipe.  
I too increased the wheat flour and reduced the white, increased the yeast to 1-1/2 tsp per suggestion, and I used brown rice syrup instead of honey which I didn't have on hand.  I can't recommend these enough.  Made turkey loin/honey-mustard cole slaw sandwiches with them.  Unfortunately the dog enjoyed the other half of the rolls while hubby was in the shower.  At least now I won't be tempted to eat them all myself today.

These were great even though I burnt the bottoms.  Watch them closely towards the end to make sure they don't burn, honey makes them burn easier.

These are pretty good, and it was fun to make them in the bread machine.  I've never used a bread machine, but I used my Aunt's today.  I had to restart it because the first time, the dough didn't really come together.  But it worked out in the end.  I do prefer the Light Wheat Rolls recipe to this, but they are both good!

These turned out great! I have the second tray in the oven still but I ate one from the first tray with a little butter and it turned out nice and soft and fluffy. I let the rolls rise for 2 hours instead of one to make sure they werent too dense. I also didnt cut them out with a biscuit cutter, I just cut it into 16 pieces and flattened each piece into a flat round shape. I'll be making these again!

This was very good and easy. I didn't roll the dough out, I took the easier route, because I am lazy by nature and by choice, and simply punched down the dough, divided into even sections, rolled each section into a ball and pressed down to about a 4-5 inch diameter and then followed the rest of the recipe. I made these to serve with the Kalua Pig in a Slow Cooker, also on this site, and cole slaw. Very good. Thanks for the recipe, will be doing this one a lot.Everyone enjoyed it.

I love this recipe. I have made this recipe more than any other single recipe on this site.  I cut them small, and make mini sandwiches for the kids' lunches.  They never come back uneaten! The kids even like to help me make them.

I thought these were pretty good.  We ate them with sloppy joes and they have a nice flavor and held up well.  However, I thought they were a little too dense for rolls.

These were really good. I did make a few changes using 2 cups of wheat flour and adding 1/4 cup of flaxseeds. Great with Butter Bean Burgers from this site.

I was going to make these yesterday for our burgers, but I ran out of time and ended up buying buns and just made a regular loaf of bread from the dough. We ate slices of it with our steak tonight, and the texture would support a burger very well. I did add 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds. The flavor was excellent as well, and I will save this recipe into my favorites.

OMG YAY!  These rolls are fantastic!  I've always wanted to make my own (veggie) burger buns and these are the best!  I was so psyched about them I was singing in my kitchen all afternoon.  Thanks for this awesome, foolproof recipe.

Oh and a note: I veganized this recipe.  I used soymilk, egg replacer, and soy margerine and they came out *perfect*.

Absolutely wonderful. My family woofed these down and begged for more.  The next batch I doubled (as I was not using a bread machine to mix it).  I baked all the rolls, and froze half when they were cooled, so I could keep some on hand for longer than a day or two.  These are the best sandwich rolls I've ever had, and will also use this recipe for dinner rolls too!!

Oh, yummy, yummy, yummy....those are the best words to describe these rolls.  The only thing different I did was instead of the melted butter, I used an egg wash.  My husband and I decided that instead of going to the bakery every Sunday for our weekly sandwich rolls, I will just make these!  Thank you so much for sharing this with us!

This is probably the best and easiest yeast roll recipe I've ever made.  I used regular yeast and all purpose flour.  My one suggestion would be not to use two cookie sheets - they didn't both fit on one rack in my oven so I had to use two racks, which caused somewhat uneven cooking. Next time I will use one cookie sheet with larger, sandwich size rolls and one smaller pan with smaller rolls for eating fresh (you won't be able to save them all for sandwiches - they are too good not to eat right from the oven!) We really loved these, thanks for a great recipe.

This is an excellent recipe. I used the rolls to make grilled portabella sandwiches. The ones I cut were too small so I hand shaped the rest and had perfect sandwich rolls. I'm about to go make more because my family and I gobbled up the rest.

I just made these rolls.  I didn't have bread machine yeast but they worked fine with regular yeast.  Easy to make...after I rolled out the dough I cut it in squares and then just rolled the sides to make them circular.  Turned out great- light and fluffy.

Super recipe!  The rolls come out perfect.  I even cut them into shapes for the kids (stars and hearts).

I don't add the extra butter on top after baking, and I still love them!

The honey keeps these rolls moist, plus I like the added benefits of whole wheat flour. I did'nt roll the dough, I simply formed into buns.

These are DELICIOUS rolls!!  My husband & I thought they were restaurant quality!  I made some shredded barbecue beef & used the rolls to make BBQ sandwiches.  Yum!  Will keep this recipe close by & use again & again.

These had a very good flavor.  They didn't rise as much as I would have liked.  I used a biscuit cutter as recommended in the recipe, but my rolls turned out to be on the small side, not very suitable for sandwiches.

Oooh, these were really good. We especially liked them with Barbequed Pork Done Two Ways, from this site as well. Delicious. My kids ask for these just to eat, skipping any sandwich filling. 

Great Recipe!  : )

1.22.20 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/18073/honey-wheat-sandwich-rolls/ ... 'Recommended by Bibi - "I did NOT use bread flour, when I made these. I don't bake much, so I don't usually have bread flour on hand. For a LOAF of bread, I might get the bread flour, as it does rise nicely with good texture. But for dinner rolls, I had no problem with all-purpose. I got LOTS of compliments, as I made them for a dinner party."  Sold!  Hee hee hee!  :D  Thanks, Bibz!

Great rolls make them almost every time we have burgers. Easy to make.... love the fact they are rolled out and cut rather than shaping individually.

Soft tender inside, nice crust. I have made these with water or milk . Good I either way. I don't brush with melted butter  as I find that makes them too sticky. I  brush them with egg white , makes a nice brown crusts. I needed to bake them for 25 minutes. A very versatile roll

I used the bread machine and rapid rise yeast and they were done in no time. I did find that the 350° oven had to be adjusted. Once I had baked them 13 minutes they were still not browning so I turned the oven to 375 and added another three minutes. They came out perfectly. Great recipe! I made hamburger and hotdog buns with them.

I decreased the water by 1/4 cup, used 1T. Bread machine yeast and 1 t. Kosher salt. Yielded 12 large 80 g. (2.8 oz.) Rolls. Next time I'll add 1/2 T. Vital wheat gluten.

I used my bread machine to make this, and was pleased with the result.  I did find the dough a little  damp and sticky and had to add quite a bit of flour to make is workable, but it was easy to roll and cut into buns.  
I served these with turkey burgers and they were delicious.

This is my go to recipe for burger buns/hot dog rolls. I cannot count how many times I have made it now. I  very rarely buy bread and today took a store roll to work today for lunch...it was dreadful, cardboard came to mind! These rolls are delicious and I have always made them as stated in the recipe and it has never failed.  The rolls get used for all sorts of purposes burgers, sliders sandwich rolls etc. They get rave reviews from everyone who eats them too. Great recipe, you won't be disappointed and  thanks!

Really nice rolls. My first try of rolls after disastrous wholewheat breads put me off. I didn't have enough bread flour left so used 2c bread flour and 1 3/4 wholewheat. Put an extra 1/4t yeast in too. These will be my kids lunch rolls for school on a regular basis now. Thank you!

Thanks Angie for the suggestions 
Used only Multigrain Fluor and worked awesome
Put the dough hook on warm the milk and honey, proof the yeast for 10 min., add the eggs and butter, measure all dry ingredients in a bowl and whisk to make sure distributed, slowly add flour mix in 3 batches.
Then I knead with the standmixer 7-10min.
To make sure gluten is developed take a golf ball sized piece of dough and stretch in opposite directions using your thumb and forefinger of both hand. If it stretches thin enough to see light through without it tearing right away it is ready

I made this recipe for dinner tonight and it turned out marvelous!  My husband actually thought I had bought them at a bakery and asked where I bought them.  I used a large biscuit cutter to shape them.  After baking, I brushed them with 2 tablespoons of butter mixed with honey.  Yum!  I had homemade chicken salad that I stuffed the rolls with. It made a delicious sandwich. I will definitely be making this recipe again.

I don't have a bread machine so just mixed these up the classic way with one rising before rolling and shaping. They have a great taste, Moist tender inside but a crispness to the crust. Thanks for a great recipe. I will make these again!

I'm SOOOO glad I found this recipe!!  I made the dough today right by the recipe and it was very easy and very yummy.  I made 2 sizes...sandwich buns and dinner rolls.  We'll have hamburgers tonight and dinner rolls tomorrow night.  As another reviewer suggested, I used the ring of a wide-mouth Mason jar to cut out the hamburger rolls.  I just pinched off equal sized pieces of the remaining dough to form the dinner rolls.  I don't think you need to roll the dough to 3/4" thick for the buns, however.  I rolled it less than 1/2" thick, and the rolls are just the right size. I have a large family, and it's expensive when we all get together for cookouts.  Making homemade rolls is a delicious cost-saver.  Thank you SEEFREE for a delicious recipe that I will use often!

These are phenomenal!  Made the first time with my bread machine.  Made into hamburger buns.  Used 1 cup white flour and 3 cups of whole wheat.  Used olive oil in place of butter and a whole pkg of yeast.  Used corn meal on cookie sheet instead of greasing it.
Getting ready to make them again with 1 1/2 cup white flour and 2 1/2 cups of whole wheat.  Going to try them in my new kitchen aid stand up mixer and make them into hot dog buns this time.  YUM YUM my husband and I are both eagerly anticipating these with brats in them for dinner.

As advertised, these make a delicious roll/sandwich/hamburger bun.
For every day use, I substitute Light Karo corn syrup for the honey, it's much cheaper and tastes less sweet than honey.  I also rarely have milk on hand, but I do have half and half (for my coffee), so I use about 1 cup of water and 1/4 cup of half and half for the milk.  My only other comment would be that these don't brown particularly well on their own, so if appearance is important, you might want to egg wash them. (like other reviewers, I usually don't brush on the butter at the end)

I'm a newbie at yeast, but these turned out great! I made rolls, twice, to rave reviews. Tonight, I'm making buns. Don't have a bread machine, so I used my upright mixer. Angie G. has good suggestions for this. I didn't change a thing (except used AP flour) but can't imagine how one would improve on the taste. Thanks for sharing.

I never expected the wonderful taste and texture of these rolls.  I put a pan of water in the oven while baking to keep the crust tender.

Good recipe.  I used my KA and proofed the yeast first.  It was a chore to roll out the dough---it kept bouncing back but I managed to get it close to a thickness that worked for hamburger buns.  I got 4 large buns, 2 smaller ones and 2 small loaves of bread.  The buns look professional.

Fantastic recipe with a permanent spot in my recipe box. I make these every week or so as sandwich buns for the boyfriend. I use 100% whole wheat flour and a couple tbsp of vital wheat gluten as well. I also add in some flax seed for the extra health kick and some rosemary to flavour it up. I think the rosemary definitely adds something special.

I like this recipe.  I do not own a bread machine, so I mixed the ingredients using a kitchenaide mixer with dough hook.  I allowed it to rise until doubled in size, deflated and then rolled it out about 1/2-3/4 inch thick.  I used a biscuit cutter to make the rounds and allowed them to rise, then baked as directed.  YUMMY!

I have been using this delicious recipe for a couple years and love it ! Today for the 20 servings size , y I used Kamut Wheat as the only flour and added 2 eggs / 2 tsp of yeast and the same amount of almond milk to add more nutrition . I usually use half honey and half molasses too. No problems with rising and the flavor and texture were perfect ! I am so excited and thank you for this wonderful recipe !

Excellent bread and very easy to make.  I didn't put the melted butter on top as suggested by another review.  It was great for sandwiches, although a little small.  I just gave my husband 2.  I also cut one in half and my 1 year old daughter used it as a teething biscuit. "num num" she said. I will be using this recipe again. Thank You.

These rolls are wonderful!  I usually add 1.5 tsp of yeast, but that's the only change.  I get about 10 rolls out of this recipe if I make them larger for hamburgers/ sandwiches.  This also makes great bread too if you let it complete the whole cycle.  This is a wonderful, versatile recipe for all your bread-like needs.  These kind of remind of the yeast rolls at some buffets.

These were fantastic. Didn't change anything. My fussy preteen thought they tasted as good as the rolls at a nearby restaurant. What she didn't know was that they had wheat flour in them.  She hates wheat bread.

The ratio of white to wheat flour works well.  It's light like white bread but has some wheat bread flavor.

These sandwich rolls are delicious! I followed the recipe to a T...almost. I used buttermilk rather than regular milk. Just had them for Easter! I was expecting lots of leftovers for sandwiches the following week but no such luck! Enjoy!

My first time using the dough cycle on my awesome bread maker...was a little scared at first, but I did it and boy am I glad. This recipe was great! I made them a little smaller than I should have (too thin) but with the scraps I just balled them up and made 4 bigger ones. My family loved them. I may use a bit less honey next time, but overall a definite keeper. I froze @ 9 of them, so I'm hoping they'll be nearly as good defrosted later.

These rolls are amazing. I made these the first time when I was snow bound and needed sandwich rolls for dinner. They were so good and such a hit that two days later I had to make 3 batches of them for a birthday party! Everyone loved them. Didn't change a thing. They are perfect!

Very good and easy to make for a novice like me.  A little on the soft side to use with heavy meats, but then I'm used to old store bought rolls.  These tasted awesome and the whole house smelled wonderful.  Will definitely use this recipe again.

I loved this rolls - so easy to make in the bread maker - practically foolproof.  And just now looking at the photos submitted by members, I am inspired to try all kinds of variations with shape and ingredients, such as seeds and oats.

WOW!  These are the BEST rolls/buns I have ever made!  I have tried many many recipes and these are in a league of their own!  They have the lightest fluffiest texture and are so soft.  The light sweetness is superb!  I made them just as the recipe called for except I let them rise for 1 hour 20 minutes.  This is my new no fail go to recipe for bread!

I bake my own bread instead of buying at the store, mainly for my husband's work lunches.  After trying several bread recipes I stumbled on this one, and now he won't eat anything else with his lunch!  They're really good, great for sandwiches (he does turkey and muenster), nice and soft but substantial at the same time.  Thanks for the recipe, I use it every week!

This is a wonderful recipe for rolls.  The only few things I did differant was I added 1 tsp of salt and used all bread flour.  It took about 1 hour and 20 minutes for rolls to double in size.  My husband loved them and that is a big compliment because he is not a big bread eater!!!  Thank you for the terrific recipe.....

These did not turn out well, but I think it was my fault.  I did not have a bread machine so I was using a kitchen aid mixer.  I attempted to poof the yeast in the warm milk and honey and for whatever reason it did not poof.  Will need to try again later.  The flavor of the rolls were good but they had the consistency of a hockey puck.

These make really tasty rolls.  The texture is wonderful, nice and soft but still sturdy!  I cut out most and rolled a few just to see the difference, and the cut out ones look just like store bought hamburger buns.  They taste so much better, though!  I'll be playing with this to make it more fiber filled, but really love this.  We've only eaten them as rolls as of now, but tonight hope to give it a shot as "hamburger buns"!!  Thanks for sharing!

This has been my primary recipe for years.  I use it mainly for dinner rolls but it makes great hamburger/hotdog buns too.  I usually freeze half of the batch and bring them out for dinner in the coming days.  Great recipe!

Ok.  I guess I was expecting them to be sweeter.  I used a biscuit cutter to size them.  They dry out quickly.

I made this recipeinmy bread maker. It tasted great, smelled wonderful, but was a bit tough, and the crust was very hard (even on the light setting on my breadmaker). I will make this again as the buns it suggests and I'm sure it will be wonderful!

Great recipe!  Used 2 c. whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 c. bread flour to make recipe slightly healthier.  Tastes like it takes a lot more effort than it does.  Definitely a keeper!

Perfect! My husband and I had tried out all the recipes on the booklet that came with the bread machine but were never entirely happy with the results.  This recipe is a winner.  Perfect and delicious homemade bread - our 9 year old daughter just loves it - and so do we!  Thanks!

I have made this into a regular loaf and mini loaves and it has been excellent every time! My husband prefers this bread for grilled ham and cheese over my other fresh baked challah!

I love this recipe,and my huband LOVES it! I've been using it now for about a year and a half now, and these are the only rolls or buns I make. I can't even count how many times I've made them now.  The very first time I made them, we had some friends over, and everyone just went crazy over them. They tast so good, you would never guess that they are both extremely easy and very good for you! Thank you for a wonderful reecipe!

WONDERFUL!! Thank you for this recipe! I was in a pinch for some buns for dinner, but couldn't get to the store because of a sick child, so I made these and they were SOO good! I just used my kitchen aid hook attachment to mix up the ingredients. Super easy and delicious recipe, thanks!

This bread recipe is my favorite! It makes me think of the bread my great grandmother used to make when I was a young child. It is sweet and addicting! All you need is a little butter and it is the most scrumptious treat!

Didn't rise a whole lot, were somewhat dry and bland. But I will try again, as the texture was nice and my 2 year old LOVES the smaller square ones I cut out. I also did some in a glass pie pan, sides touching one another, and those were a little less dry.

This already smells irresistible in the oven but when you bite into them, feels like you died and went to heaven. They were so soft and fluffy. Measurements given for the ingredients I felt were spot on resulting in some very delicious rolls.

These got such great reviews so I was very excited to make them. They were pretty good (my son hugged me after tasting one so he just LOVED them)! Go with 4 inch cut out or you'll have small rolls not large enough for sandwiches. I will make these again but next time may add a tad more honey or even molasses for the sweetness. I didn't find the taste of honey came through much at all. I don't think these were over-the-top wonderful - but I do think they were pretty good.

Oh my goodness!!!! These are the best sandwich rolls that I have ever made.  They were light.  They were tasty.  They were perfect.  No changes to the recipe are necessary.  This is a definite keeper!

I've made these twice.  The first time they were "okay."  I was wanting to try again, which I did today.  The second time, I added a little more salt (about an extra 1/4 tsp.), I added more whole wheat flour, I kneaded longer (I do this by hand), I let them rise longer,  and I let them bake longer.  I LOVE THESE....  I just had one fresh out of the oven with a little butter (I didn't brush the tops with butter either time because I didn't want to add the fat) and it was so good...even though I burned the bottoms on a few of them, I still wanted to eat it, even the burned part.  Didn't matter.  I used graham wheat flour (coarser grain), unsalted butter, and raw honey with this and that was great.  Definitely try.

My husband rates these buns with 5 stars! I did mix the dough in my breadmaker. I made mini buns for roast beef sandwiches. I'll definitely make again. Thanks for sharing!

Loved 'em! I don't have a bread machine, instead I have a 3 year old that likes to cook and it all worked out beautifully. I pulled the dough apart and she rolled them into balls. She was cute and the bread was great!

These are great.  I actually forgot the salt, but the texture and the crumb was fantastic.  We had a highly seasoned filling, so the lack of salt didn't matter so much, but I could tell that, made correctly, these would be awesome.  I'm never buying buns again.

I thought that they really pretty good. They are more of a hamburger bun than a sandwich bun. Too coarse for sandwich meat. I substituted some of the milk with water, as milk makes it more coarse.

Excellent. My family loved these. I made these on Sunday and got 16 out of the dough. By Monday evening there wasn't one left. I think that tells you how good they were. Many Thanks.

These things are so good that I had to force myself to put them away after eating two as small ham sandwiches and then two more plain. My family loved them and have asked for me to make them again. This one is a winner!!!!!

these rolls were the best, i loved them.  they came put perfect, i think mine rose in a warm area for about a hour and the tripled in size they were light and fluffly.  If you allowed them to rise properly and put them in a pipping hot oven they should not be dense at all. Perfect

I made these for my husbands lunch and we ended up eating them with our soup!  Delicious - I only put butter on the ones we ate with dinner, the rest I left plain for sandwiches.  Well worth the effort!

Nice roll recipe.  A hint of sweetness because of the honey and the bread is soft.

These were wonderful.  My kids ate them plain and we ate them as the bread in the recipe "mamas best broiled tomato sandwich"  from this site.  We also put slices of cheese in them the next day and they were great.
