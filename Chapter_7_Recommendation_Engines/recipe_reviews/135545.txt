This recipe has some serious flaws, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else in its current form.  First of all, if you add the sweet potatoes and parsnips so late in the process, not all of them will cook all the way through.  When I made it, many of the chunks were still crunchy.  Second, file powder is an end spice - you should not add it and then simmer for 30 minutes.  The result will be slimy and unappetizing, as I found out when I made it.  I like the ideas of the roasted peppers and the various spices, but not enough to salvage it overall.  Thumbs down.

This was a great way to use tons of veggies from the summer garden! It was my first time making gumbo but my husband and I bothe enjoyed it. We followed the recipe except instead of using a can of fire roasted tomatoes I used 4-5 fresh tomatoes from the garden and roasted them in the oven at the same time as the peppers. Just a word to the wise - gumbo seasoning can be very spicey so if you do not like spicey food be careful and do not add 2 whole TBSP! We served over rice.

This is a very good recipe, although it is seriously high maintenance.  I followed the directions very closely (although I never figured out what 'file powder' was/is) and it still had a nice kick to it.  I ate this with whole wheat bread and my husband ate it with crackers--both were excellent.

This recipe features a bit of unnecessary juggling IF you have a sufficiently thick-bottomed pot (I use an ex-pressure-cooker). Cook the roux right in the pot, and the veg will saute nicely in the roux.

I loved this gumbo, even though I did make a few changes. My grocer was out of serrano peppers so I used a mirasol pepper instead. I also used only two green peppers, and added two red bell peppers. I didn't have smoked paprika so I used regular old paprika. I left out the parsnip, the celery, and the black-eye peas because I don't like those.   Next time, I think I'll halve the kidney beans and the okra and double the green and red peppers.   Truly a delicious and adaptable recipe. One of the best Gumbos I've ever had!

This was so flavorful, had a good amount of spice, and a great texture. I didn't have file powder or use parsnips. I roasted corn along with the peppers and added it to a cornbread mix for a side. I will make this gumbo again for sure!

Wonderful, full flavour. I skipped the file powder, like some of the other reviewers I didn't have any on hand. 

I love spice & was skeptical of the instruction to toss the seeds of the hot peppers - perhaps in part because I only had 2 banana peppers & 1 jalapeno. I'm glad I kept them because when I opened the can of fire roasted tomatoes they didn't have any heat at all. Not sure if this is the norm. - anyway, I added the seeds when the tomatoes went in. I also added a teaspoon of crushed chili flakes. 

Thank you so much for this recipe!! I've never made gumbo before and although it can be a bit work-intensive, I will definitely use this recipe again!

this recipe needs serious work to be anything edible. The vegetables and spices compete with each other too much to make a complimentary dish. back to the drawing board.

First time trying it.  Very DELICIOUS!  The spices were perfect. I couldn't find any file powder but used corn starch instead.

I made this recipe after looking for vegetarian gumbo recipes and AFTER reading people's comments and altering it a bit. I used fresh okra that may have been more than 2 cups (I wanted to use up a lot of vegetables on hand), omitted the parsnip, doubled the sweet potato and omitted the 1st two steps for the peppers and replaced a diced jalapeno. . I also used an entire can of tomatoes. Sorry, too lazy and didn't have the time). My roux was dark gravy color! I also cooked the sweet potato and vegetables together. Yumm. Wouldn't have thought of using black eye peas and red beans, but it was great!

Delicious! I double the recipe, and added cut green beans instead of okra, which I couldn't find anywhere. I took it to game night with some friends and everyone wanted some to take home, so I came home with an empty pot. I'm making some more soon.

This is one of the best mix of spice and flavor I have ever had.  Love it after a day in the wilds of Alaska.
