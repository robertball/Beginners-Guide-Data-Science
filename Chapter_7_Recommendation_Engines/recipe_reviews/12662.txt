Looks like a lot of us had moms and grandmas who put leftover pie crust to good use! Mom and Grandma just rolled the leftover dough into a circle, sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon (no butter) then cut into triangles and rolled up as crescents. Or sometimes they would just spread the dough with a thin layer of jam. Either way, I "kick it up a notch" by drizzling with a simple powdered sugar glaze.

I was looking for something that resembled what my mom and grandma used to make from left-over pie crust when I was a girl. We called ours 'Diddlees' and the ingredients were basically the same except we'd roll out the pie crust, spread it with butter and sprinkle on cinnamon, sugar, and raisins, then roll the crust up and cut it into slices. Then you bake them for 20 mins in a 350F/175C  oven. I always looked forward to them whenever my mom baked a pie. They wre perfect with tea! Thanks for sharing. :-)

My Aunt Mary used to make these all the time from leftover pieces of pie crust dough, but we called them Pie Cookies.
It's important to roll out the dough very thin.  And we always melted the butter and just brushed it on, then sprinkled cinnamon and sugar.  Yum!

One of my favorite memories also, which I now do for my granddaughter.  Whenever I bake pies, I take the left over crust, roll into a rectangle, cover with butter, sugar & cinnamon,  OR  grape jelly  (my favorite) then roll up jelly roll style, slice into  2" pieces and bake on parchment paper, for easy cleanup, just in case I put too much filling in.

Thanks for reminding me of these!  My kids loved to make them too!  We used colored sugars & they were very festive!  Also try turning a small, oven-safe bown upside down - then roll out dough large enough to cover it & brush it with butter & sugar - put it sugar side down on the bowl & bake.  You'll end up with a sugary crusty bowl.  These are GREAT to fill with ice cream!

These are fantastic made with that store bought pie crust that comes in a roll!  You don't have to be making a pie. Super easy and delicious.

Just like most of the reviewers wrote, this recipe is a trip down memory lane for me as well....I took the advice from Naples34102 (thank-you) and cut mine into triangles and spread with raspberry jam and rolled it into crescents...so good!

My mother made these every time she made a pie and us kids would stand and wait for them to come out of the oven. They are crisp, buttery and sweet. That was over 50 years ago and I just made some for my grandson. Just like I remembered! Thanks!

These are soooo yummy and fun to eat.  Like another reviewer, we also did this with our leftover pie crusts and used butter flavored spray rather than butter.  I've also made this with Splenda and it turned out good.  Thanks for the cute idea Dawn.

Wow. thanks for the recipe and the reminder from my childhood. My mom would make an extra pie crust just to make "cinnamon roll" made just like the jelly roll described, but not sliced until after it bakes and cools (reduces any mess as the sugar is sealed into the roll). Just be sure to use shortening instead of butter if you make it this way.  Shortening holds its shape much better.   I never liked pies as a child but I sure loved this cinnamon sugar treat.  I just never knew so many others also had such great Mom's.

I made these for my kids tonight with leftover pie crust.  I rolled the crust REALLY thin into 1 big circle.  Then spread with a super light layer of butter.  Covered with cinnamon/sugar and baked for about 20 minutes at 350 to get it nice and crispy.  I cut into pieces and then we drizzled them with honey before gobbling them up. Mmmmm!!

One of my fondest memories of growign up in the 70's, if you're wondering) was when my mother was baking a pie, her letting me roll out the leftover scraps of crust and cutting out shapes with my cookie cutters, brushing the shapes with milk, and sprinkling the tops with sugar and cinnamon.  It's memories like those that have prompted me to be a pie-making fanatic today.  I can't wait to share this secret treat with my own children.  Thank you for posting this heart-warming recipe!

Memmmmorriiiieees...... My mom used to make these, sans the butter, all the time when I was little.  My husband never had them before, he loved them.  My toddler was delighted to help.  Good recipe for left-over crust-lots of possibilities!

My mom used to make these for me when I was a child.  She always used scraps of leftover pie crust.  It is also good with scraps of leftover biscuit dough.

I remember these from my childhood, but hadn't made them for myself until this year's Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. A great memory that still tastes as good as when I was a kid.

I usually use half or a quarter the butter/sugar/cinnamon because the full amount ends up shedding too much for me as it's moved around.

This was a perfect refresher to a very old family holiday recipe, that I wanted to make for my husband. I added 1/2 cup of brown sugar and removed 1/2 cup white sugar and it was REALLY GOOD!!!
