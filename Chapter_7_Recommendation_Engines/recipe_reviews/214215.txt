I have made these 2 times and each time they received rave reviews. I do recommend marinating overnight for maximum flavor. Great recipe!

I loved this recipe and it made AMAZING pork chops.  Instead of regular applesauce, I used a mango-peach flavor applesauce and I added a dash of cayenne pepper for little more spice. Very tasty!!

Very good!  Will make again for sure.  Next time I will marinate longer-probably overnight-I only had time for about 8 hours.

Awesome...everyone loved it - even my daughter that doesn't like pork chops! I left out the hot pepper sauce and used lemon instead of lime.  This is a definite keeper - thanks.

This is a great marinade. Worcestshire MAKES this marinade (and any other pork/steak marinade for that matter). I added garlic too because we love garlic on everything.

These pork chops were excellent!  I didn't have a lime so I used some lemon juice & they still came out amazingly.  We did have to grill them a bit longer than 6 mins per side, and they were about 1/2" thick.  I also did marinate overnight.  Again very wonderful pork chops!

Wow!  That was delicious!  I'd only had enough time to marinate my inch thick chops for about an hour and they were good off the grill!  I'll definitly make again.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I only had time to marinade my pork chops for about 1 hour; they were not extremely flavorful, but I imagine that's partly because I didn't marinade them as long as the recipe called for. Next time I will do the full time.

These are excellent pork chops!  My recommendation is to marinate them overnight to get the full benefit of the marinade.  As for the hot sauce, only use mild hot sauce such as Franks, not the high octane sauce such as Tabasco.  The left over pork chops were sliced the following day for pork sandwiches with lettuce, tomatoes, mayonnaise, horse radish or spicy mustard with cheddar cheese on whole wheat bread.  After slicing the pork, zap it in the microwave to warm it up.  Even on the following day, the pork was still juicy.  This recipe is a keeper.

Bada Bing... Bada Boom! These are superb pork chops! Definitely take the extra time to marinate them overnight... other than that one tip, follow this one exactly and you won't be disappointed.

These are really good, but I added spices as some of the others did. One health tip--it's very important to follow the precaution of heating the marinade to boiling before you baste the meat.

Great marinade.  Cut down the hot sauce and doubled everything else for a whole boneless pork loin roast.  Grilled to perfection!

Good stuff, although I used frozen apple juice concentrate to add the apple flavor. Apple's perfect with pork; I just don't typically have applesauce on hand. (The frozen juice concentrate keeps almost forever!)

I didn't have italian dressing prepared, so I just added 1/2 a package of the dry Good Seasons italian dressing mix, with some oil and vinegar and water.  Added 1/2 Texas Petes and 1/2 tabasco sauce.  Also, didn't have a lime handy, so just used lemon juice.  VERY moist and a little sweet, but not too sweet.  Will definately make this one again.  One of the few recipes on here where I haven't had to add extra seasoning.

AWESOME!  I not, only use this for Pork, but for Chicken, as well!  It gives such a great flavor and with a lot of juiciness with a touch of spice that my kids don't even complaint about!! They gobble them right down! I haven't had a chance to actually marinate them overnight, I just whip up the ingredients and set the pork chops in it for about 30 minutes & throw them on the grill.  It's fantastic as is!  One day, I'll try to think ahead of time and try to marinate...if they're awesome like this, I'm sure they'll be unbelievable after sitting in the marinade overnight!

This recipe also works well in the crock pot.  The tangy juice is so yummy over rice.  We loved it and I imagine they are even more amazing on the grill. The ingredients were just perfect for us and I only added a small amount of water to the crock pot to make the juice very flavorful.  Thank you!!!

I was missing some of the ingredients so I made some substitutions but I don't think they changed the flavor much. I didn't have a full 1/2 cup of applesauce so I used half applesauce and 1/2 baby food prunes (it's what I had on hand!). I used red pepper flakes instead of hot pepper sauce. It is really hot out so we ended up cooking inside instead of on the grill.   These were delicious and juicy. They had a sweet/sour/spicy flavor. You couldn't really pick out any one flavor over another - they all blended well.   We'll probably try this marinade on chicken next.  We saved some of the marinade mix out before adding the meat and added a little to green beans when we served them. It was a nice addition.

These pork chops were awesome. Followed recipes except that I used apple juice instead of applesauce because that's what I had on hand. It made no difference because they were delicious and so tender and juicy. Don't know what others meant when they said they were bland because they were quite flavorful. I did marinate all night. My whole family enjoyed these so definitely a keeper.

These were flavorful, but nothing off the charts.  This makes a ton of marinade.  Way too much for only 6 pork chops in my opinion.  I halved it and it was plenty!

Pretty good! While my hubs and I enjoyed these, we both agree that Gina Stubbs' grilled brown sugar pork chops take center stage. These were a tad too tangy for our liking. I think a touch of brown sugar would do the trick. I didn't use sweetened applesauce (I only buy the natural variety) and I'm thinking that may be what adds the touch of sweetness we thought these needed. All in all, these were good but lacked the WOW factor we were expecting. Thanks anyways, walleye. :-)

Had a great flavor. It was freezing the night I made these so I wasnt' able to grill them. I just cooked them on the stove top and they still were great. Bet they are even better on the grill and can't wait to try them that way.

1/2012:  not so tender.  i marinated overnight and it wasn't really tough but it wasn't too tender either.  these were thick chops maybe if they were thinner.  or i didn't grill, i used george forman. try again with thinner chops next time.

This was almost as easy to make as it was delicious!! You get the sweetness from the fresh lime and applesauce. The heat (but not too much) from the Frank's Red Hot Sauce. In a word.... "HEAVENLY!"

I used bottled lime juice (about 1-2 TBsps.) and opted to use wing sauce in place of the hot sauce (was looking to use it up from another recipe). We were only able to marinate a little over an hour, and cooked in a frying pan. BF thought the marinade was weird, but one taste and he was hooked! It tastes really good, and will be a repeat come summer for grilling season.

Yum!  They turned out so flavorful and really tender.  I used cinnamon apple sauce because that is what I had in the house (couldn't taste the cinnamon) and Frank's Red Hot Original as my hot sauce.   I marinated for about 9 hours.  I did not boil the marinade to use as a basting sauce because I don't like to use after touching raw meat (even after boiling - don't want to chance it.)  Really simple to prepare and great taste.  Definitely will make again!

I'd been getting sick of the usual dinner meats: chicken, beef...turkey....thought I'd give pork a try.  I ended up buying the "butterfly" pork chops instead of the bone in.  And I ended marinating it for over 24 hours; my boyfriend forgot that I was marinating dinner and brought home Taco Bell so we ate this the following night.  I did cook it on the stove instead of grilling, as I have no grill, but it was still awesome!

Awesome pork chops.  Marinated overnight, but left out the hot sauce - everything else the same.  Our chops were on the thin side, so they got a little well-done on the grill, BUT they were still so tender and just delicious - what flavor!!  The marinade is fabulous!!!  We will be making this often.  Thank you for an outstanding grilled pork chop recipe.

I didn't really care for the taste of these. The marinade was too bitter/tangy and every bite led to a bit of a grimace, lol. The only pro was my super thin chops came out nice and tender. I just pan seared them for about 1.5 minutes per side. Will be choosing a different recipe next time.

Used Siracha as the hot sauce. Only let it marinate about 3 hours. Worked great. The sauce was spicy enough that I was concerned my wife wouldn't like it, but with the meat, it was perfect. Just a bit of heat, but not overwhelming.

Started off positive. I felt really good about the marinade. I even did two tablespoons of habanero hot sauce instead of the suggested pepper sauce. I figured id fry up some sauerkraut with bacon grease and plop down some naked beans. Well, after I found a drink recipe on this same site for a drink called, "dark and stormy" (rum and ginger beer), I  the whole recipe up. All I can say is the pork turned out great, but the meal was awful. I just don't think I'm responsible enough to wait for a marinade. .

My family loves this recipe.  It has become one of my favorite ways to fix pork chops.  I add a little more hot sauce to  the marinade and marinate the chops overnight.  It is in our regular rotation.

I think we just do not like the tangyness of the italian dressing as a marinade.   We like the dressing on salads.  Good for one meal but will not make again.  Thanks for sharing.

These chops were AWESOME! I marinated them overnight and all day.  They were the juiciest, tastiest pork chops I had every made  I made extra so there would be leftovers for lunch and my hubby and teenage son ate every last one!  Love the added zing with the hot sauce.  Definitely a keeper!!

Pretty good.  I didn't baste, as I was using our george foreman grill--it's way too cold outside to be grilling on the deck right now!  I marinated overnight and 1/2 a  day then grilled them.  We had these for dinner with sweet potatoes and pasta.  A nice meal, thanks for the recipe!

I get recipes from this website daily and have never once reviewed a recipe. Until this one. These are, quite possibly, the best pork chops I've ever had. I let them marinade for 2 days before grilling and they were a-mazing. Served with Superfast Asparagus from this site and some mushroom rice. Even though I don't usually make my own marinade, I will be fixing these often!

I have made this dish twice now . . .  to rave reviews.  It keeps the chops succulient and tender while providing that "Bada Bing" as promised.  Works with chops and pork tenderlion.  I have found that I can easily make half of this marinade and it suffices too.  Thank you for sharing!

Tasty way to make a VERY tender chop!  Since the applesauce I used was unsweetened, I added brown sugar.  I browned the pork and then added a small amount of water to simmer until cooked through.

I didn't make any modifications and I give this a strong 4 1/2 stars!  I marinaded for about 8 hours and they were very flavorful.  I may have gone a little heavy on the hot sauce but you couldn't tell unless you dipped the meat in the sauce and/or used it as a gravy on mashed potates and apple sauce.  YUM!

This reciped was GREAT! And the pork chops were juicy. I followed the recipe but used Lemon juice in place of the Lime juice and left out the Hot Sauce. And marinated it over two nights. We grilled them tonight and they was delicious! This recipe is a keeper!

We've been making this for years. It is the only way we make pork chops now. You MUST use bone-in pork chops!! I cannot stress this enough. If you use the boneless, it will turn out dry every time. Not sure why. The other thing is to let it marinate at least overnight. I buy in bulk and freeze them in the marinade, that way it marinates as it thaws.

I love hot spicy food. This was way too hot and drowned out the other  flavors.  Will not make again.

I tried this with cut 1 inch pork loin chops. I marinated this for a full day. I love weird sounding marinades. applesauce and Italian dressing...really, ok! I noted my small changes, besides pan-frying the chops. I used home-made pepper sauce and everything else according to recipe. I also made cheddar sweet potatos and apples. it was EXCELLENT! thanks for posting a great idea!

Very good as is but our tastes enjoyed a little more with 1/4 cup Worcestershire + 1/4c. red wine and added 3-4 crushed garlic cloves + 1/2 tsp dried rosemary.  Great base for customizing to your liking.  Thanks for sharing.

Hubby liked this, I did not. The hot sauce and lime overpowered this for me. The spiciness was good for hubby, and while I like the taste of the different mixtures of acid by themselves the combo just was too weird tasting. Thanks anyway.

Nice change for pork chops.  I found 2 boneless pork chops in freezer and scaled the recipe down.  They were in the marinade for 2 days.  DH grilled them up nicely and we enjoyed a dinner of chops, potatoes, salad and homemade bread.  I will be making this again next grilling season.

These were flavorful but not as good as I expected after reading reviews. Could definitely taste sweet and sour. I made exactly as written and marinated for 10 hours. Not my favorite pork chop but good enough to make occasionally.

These were spectacular chops.  Not only do our children love them, our friends rave at this delicious recipe.  Our only alterations; reduced hot pepper sauce by half and used thick cut boneless chops.

I marinated my pork chops overnight & put them on the grill.  The sauce for this recipe is amazing!!  I got tons of compliments & my 3 year old said they were the best pork chops ever!  I did leave out the lime juice since I didn't have any on hand but everything else I left as written.

I used sliced pork tenderloin (about 2" thick) medallions and let them thaw in the marinade for 2 days.  I had a schedule conflict and could not grill, so we put all of it, plus about 6 red potatoes in the slow cooker on high for 5 hours. I drained the marinade out, boiled it with cornstarch and turned it into a gravy.  It was good, a bit spicy, and we look forward to trying it on the gril.

I marinated four bone-in pork chops for almost 7 hours before grilling them. The preparation was very easy as I had all the ingredients on hand. I used bersteins restaurant recipe (italian dressing) and omitted the hot sauce (preference). Overall, simple and tasty pork chops with a nice juicy flavor. I thought the marinade helped to make the pork chops very tender. I grilled them for 6 minutes on each side with no problems. I served these with "smushed apples and sweet potatoes" from this website. yum!

Chops are my favorite meat right next to fried and grilled fish! This recipe rocks! The only change I did was season my chops with garlic powder, adobo seasoning, black pepper and italian herb seasoning w/ thyme, oregano, rosemary and majoram. How much seasonings?.....To taste! I season the meat before adding the marinade. The marinade is great....I same some on the side to use as extra sauce when serving. Just be careful with the adobo....it does have salt in it! You can be liberal with the rest of the seasonings. Lastly, BE CAREFUL NOT TO OVERCOOK THE CHOPS. Please follow the directions as listed and you will not go wrong. It's a keeper for sure.

Tender, juicy and flavorful.  I marinated these in a ziplock freezer bag in the fridge overnight and my husband the grillmeister cooked them.  We didn't use the marinade when grilling as the recipe recommended, but the chops were excellent.  This will probably be one of our favorite recipes--many, many thanx!

These pork chops were the best chops I have made in a long time! I only had time to marinade them about 5 hours but used the marinade while grilling. They almost melted in your mouth.

Marinated over night and used 2 VERY large pork chops. Also it was raining so i cooked them in the oven for 10 mins on each side and then an extra 7 because they were still pink. WONDERFUL flavor!

Very good and very flavourful.  I had to bake mine in the oven as the weather turned but still yummy.  I'll be making these again but next time I will adjust the marinade ingredients more to suit our tastes.  We found the overall flavour to be worcester sauce and it seemed to overpower the other flavours. I also cut down on the hot sauce for my kiddie.

Awesome! We enjoyed this recipes tremendously. We did use boneless chops which were very tender.  Easy to put together, and scrumptious chops!

1252 is WAY too much SALT! But...these are really good! I will cut down recipe to half as there was too much sauce and a waste. Very flavorful and a good heat on the lips!!!  Will make again. Also used no bone chops and very tender.

Loved them!!!! Only change was to use less hot sauce as I'm not crazy about 'hot' anything. Flavour, flavour, flavour!!!

These chops were very good.  The best I've had in a long time.  My husband told me three times how good they were.  I followed the recipe except for the hot pepper sauce.  I used an asian hot chilli sauce because that is what I had.  I can't wait to make them for my son & daughter in law.  Thanks for the easy recipe.

I made this last night for dinner ... I did not have any bone in pork chops but I had a boneless loin roast so I cut that into chops.  Also I did not have any applesauce so I left that out.  Marinated the chops about 7 hours ... put on the grill and kept basting with the sauce as stated in the directions.  These were the BEST pork chops we have ever had ... tender, juicy and full of flavor!!

These were tasty! I was actually scared of this recipe because of the ingredients called for, but I was also intrigued by it, so I decided to give it a try. When I went in the pantry to get the applesauce, I realized I only had no-suagr added applesauce, but you could not tell at all. I decided to just hold back a little of the marinade instead of boiling it to baste the chops with and that worked out fine. The chops came out tender and flavorful. I would make these again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

There are not enough stars to give to this phenomenal recipe.  This recipe first caught my eye as the recipe of the day.   That was my lucky day!  I go back to it year after year.  This just graced our 4th of July celebration.  It was not the first year that it has played the lead role.  To me, this is the best recipe that I have ever gotten from AllRecipes.  I will say that I think it is gross to boil the marinade.  Simply take out about 1/2 a cup for the grilling portion.  Who wants to risk getting sick with boiling the marinade?  Other than that one issue, an unprecedented success.

Wasn't crazy about the blend. Found that they just didn't work well together. I also used a grill pan rather then a BBQ... Maybe that would make a difference.

Wow! That's all I can say!  I did a quick 30 minute marinade on this cuz I was in a pinch.  Cooked em on the stove with a grill pan! Seared the chops then added about 1/4 of the marinade and cooked it with the chops bout 7 mins per side.  Let stand 4 mins and topped the chops with the drippings.   3 letters.  OMG.   Doing this one again.

Made these last night and they were O.K.  When I made the marinade I thought the taste was alright. I had to marinade them longer than I wanted to, 2 days. My husband said they were ok but all I could taste was sourness. No real distinct flavor, just sour pork. Sorry but I don't think I'll make these again.

We used boneless pork chops and marinated for about 6 hours.  The chops were good but I found them a little tangy for my preference.  I think I may prefer them with less Worcestshire as I felt this flavor to be the most overpowering.

I made these for Father's Day..out of this world delicious! Moist, juicy and so flavorful. Followed the recipe exactly, adding fresh minced garlic and some Emeril's Essence. I had Tabasco so I cut it down to 2 tablespoons and it was perfect, not hot at all and I think I'll keep it at 2 tablespoons because it was so delicious! I marinated my chops for about 18 hours. This recipe is tied with my favorite marinated pork chop recipe and my hubby was one happy Dad today! Thank you, will use regularly!

I thought this was an 'interesting' mix of ingredients and wanted to give it a try.  The chops were good, but the flavor just didn't quite meet my expectations.  Just a little 'off'.

These chops were very good.  The sauce gave them a nice flavor.  I doubled the applesauce, hoping to be able to taste it a little better, but the italian dressing and worchestershire pretty much overpower the other flavors in it.  So next time I will cut down on the italian and worchestershire a bit, to try to let the other flavors shine thru better.  The sauce gave these a nice tanginess and there was no need for any type of steak sauce, etc. for dipping.  I did reserve some of the marinade on the side to simmer instead of using what was marinating on the pork.  Something about reusing marinade thats been sitting in raw pork doesnt sound appetizing to me.  This was a great recipe and I plan on making again!  Thank you!

All of the ingredients sounded strange to me, but I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out great!  We have little ones, and used 1/4 cup of Frank's and it was not too hot for them.

This is FANTASTIC. I accidentally used "zesty" italian dressing the first time I made it, and it was a little over powering, but still fantastic. For the hot pepper sauce, I used Franks. So delicious, my boyfriend loves them and wants to make them for the next family get together! Yum.

This was definitely a tasty marinade! I let it soak overnight, to get all of the flavors perfect. We enjoyed it with a bright veggie medley in a lemon butter sauce. Next time I will up the hot sauce for that kick!

This was a fantastic recipe. My whole family loved it. I did replace the hot pepper sauce with Green Tobasco and it was delicious.

Everyone thought these were just OK. I marinated them overnight and then put them on my George Foreman grill. I thought they tasted a bit off...couldn't really place it. It was a good try but not right for our family. Thanks though...

Family and friends love this recipe!  Truly gives the pork chop flavor.  We've used on thick centercut pork loin chops as well as bone-in.

Flavor was wonderful. I had thick center cut chops and only grilled six minutes on each side, as suggested by others. The chops were still dry in the middle. I probably won't make this again. I hate dry meat.

My family liked it. We opt to bake it verses grill it and it was still good. (House smells like hot sauce now). I liked it because it was sweet but not overly sweet and it had a kick to it. I think it would go good with cole slaw and grilled corn.

I actually had to make these in the oven because it decided to rain when i wanted to grill.  I liked the pork, but the marinade tastes just like italian dressing, not much else going on.

These were great porkchops.  I made them just like the recipe instructed and they turned out really juicy and flavorful.  We basted the pork on the grill with the remaining sauce and served it with grilled asparagus and parmasean mushroom risoto and it made a great meal.  I marinated mine for over 12 hours and I agree with the other reviewers that the longer you marinate the better.  We'll make these again for sure!

I rarely eat pork chops when I serve them to my husband, however these looked so juicy and delicious, I tried them.  They are the best ever!  The chops were as juicy as they looked and to my surprise the meat melted in my mouth...my husband loved them as well and was disappointed he had to share them!!  The ingredients are simple, prep time is short and the taste is terrific.  I can't wait to serve to guests!!

It was awesome. I made a few adjustments. I didn't go with the hot sauce because I thought that my grandmother wouldn't be able to eat it. and used apple cinammon applesauce because that's what I had and let it marinate overnight. Good eating.

This was very good pork chops. I only had time to marinade for about 1 1/2 hours, the still turned out delicious! I thought with the hot sauce that it might be too hot for kids but it wasn’t. Perfect!!!

Made lots of changes based on what I had on hand. I kept the Italian dressing and hot sauce, and used similar ingredients for the rest. They were absolutely delicious! Thanks for the inspiration.

We had a menu change so ended up marinating these for a day and a half. I baked them in the marinade, covered,  for 30 minutes at 350 degrees. Very flavorful and juicy.

This was good.  I think I would add a few more things to spice it up a little more but  it really is very tasty.   Didn't have a lime so went without.  Thanks!

These are amazing! I’ve always been a little bored by pork chops, but not any more! They were devoured by my family. I used boneless chops that were ridiculously thick, so I cut them in half and marinaded for 24 hours. Heated sauce, basted with it, then reheated to serve with dinner. These were the best pork chops I’ve ever made. Thanks!

OMG-- These are fantastic. Strange ingredients worked GREAT together. I left out the hot sauce and used lemon juice instead of lime and added a bit of rosemary.  I marinated overnight and braised them on the stove with the marinade which cooked down into a delicious gravy.  Definitely a keeper.

I only rate a recipe if I make the recipe as written.  I did half the recipe as I was cooking two chops.  We loved it.  The chops were flavorful and moist.  The applesauce toned down the saltiness of the Worcestershire sauce and the hot sauce added a bite.  We will definitely make this again.

It's alright, but definitely not a 5-star dish. I didn't really care for the vinegar flavor. I'll be looking for a different recipe for apple flavored pork.

WOW! I am not one for hot (spicy) food, but these were amazing! When I was preparing the marinade, I thought for sure I was not going to like them due to the large amount of pepper sauce. Yes, there was tingling, but it wasn't bad. I would recommend a longer marinating time with thicker chops.  Putting the marinade on during the grilling process extremely enhanced the flavor & created some nice crispy ends! Definitely will make again!!

Really good. I broiled it which produced some smoke, but all was well. Used soy sauce instead of Worcestershire. Husband approved.

I liked the combination of flavors in the marinade. The only think I did differently is when I boiled down the marinade, I added a healthy pinch of brown sugar. I would definitely make these again.

This was OK I expected a lot more flavor having marinated for a good 24 hrs.  Will try other pork chop recipes before I do this one again.  My nephew liked them and it was not that I disliked them just lacking in flavor.

Yummy. I didn't have applesauce, so I used apricot jam. Gave a great char on the porkchops. I didn't marinate them long, but overnight would probably be fantastic.

The pork chops turned out very well.  I marinated them for about 6 hours.  I will definitely use this recipe again, and when I do, I'll marinate them over night for maximum flavor.

Followed exactly!  Did marinate over night so there was a lot of flavor. After dinner my guy complimented me on the chops and wanted to know the kind of sauce I used since he really liked it.  Told him it was a new try from Allrecipes.  Another keeper!  Thanks submitter.

Thought I wouldn't like it because of the amount of hot sauce, but it was DELICIOUS!  I did add a tablespoon of brown sugar just to give it a bit more sweetness and it was perfect.

Marinated it overnight  and the flavor came through.  I didn't read the recipe thoroughly and threw out the marinade, instead of cooking it.  I will also watch the time it spent on the grill as it dried it out a little, but that's my issue :) not the recipe.  Highly recommend.

This had a wonderful flavor, so surprised with all the ingredients to marinade. I made it exactly as instructed. I also just used Tabasco sauce. Since there is now so many options now for this ingredient. Will make this again. I will try this also with chicken. Thank you. I also had Yukon gold potatoes and fresh green beans from this site too. Thanks for a change.

I'm not a big fan of the flavor although my 15 year old enjoyed it and I didn't get that oh God response from everyone else and even with hers I had to ask.  I honestly think it may have been the applesauce that threw the flavor off.

This was not that bad. Definitely a flavorful porkchop. My husband said it was more sour than he liked it to be. Maybe I'll add some sugar next time to balance it out. Definitely marinating it more than 6 hours and cooking it 6 minutes per side is key. Cooked just right b following the recipe. Thank you!

I cut this down to two servings, and it was just a right amount--a little left of the sauce, but if I'd have had rice or potatoes with it, that would be a great thing to be able to add!  The hot sauce I used was Sriracha, and I only marinated the chops for about 3 1/2 hours.  The chops grilled up perfectly!  I'm so glad to have tried this recipe!  We loved it!  Thanks, walleye11!

As my husband said, "this is the best pork chop I have ever had!"  I followed the directions exactly, except I substituted unsweetened applesauce.  I marinated for 24 hours.  These were the most tender and flavorful chops I've ever had.  I'm trying the marinade on chicken tonight, and hope it works the same magic.

Decided to give this one a try on the ol' George Foreman, and SUCCESS!  Huge fan of simple recipes, and it doesn't get much easier.  Of course, that doesn't matter if it isn't tasty...double win.  Instead of bone-in chops, I opted for a thinner, center cut, boneless chop.  Cooked for about 4 minutes on medium, and it worked great.  Will probably cook a little hotter next time to get some char.  Marinating overnight is highly recommended.  I still cooked the marinade to thicken, and gave the meat a good, final dunk before cooking.  This is a tasty, easy entree.  Whip it together the night before, throw it on the portable grill when you get home the next day.  Dinner in minutes!

Probably the best easy recipe for pork chops I have ever tried. Pork chops usually dry out, no matter how they are prepared. These are exceptional!  Moist, full of flavor!  I did not have a line, so I omitted it, however ended up marinating for nearly 48 hours. Put on gas grill for about 6-7 minutes per side and mmmmmmm boy,
