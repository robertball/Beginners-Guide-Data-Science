Used non-fat vanilla yogurt, freshly-squeezed OJ, TJ's cookie butter, and this was GOOD!  Did add some crushed ice to reach the consistency that we like.

I doubled this recipe. I used vanilla yogurt and peanut butter in place of the almond butter. Kids thought it was great.

I put less honey in it because I felt that would have been too sweet.

Added blueberry yogurt instead of normal yogurt, peanut butter, and ice. Tasted good! A little tangy-like,but still good!

This was absolutely delicious. I used non-fat vanilla yogurt, peanut butter, added some ice cube, and also threw in a kiwi. Soooo yummy
