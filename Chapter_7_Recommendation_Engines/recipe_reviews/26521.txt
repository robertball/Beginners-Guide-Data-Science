I was given this recipe years ago by Beverly Painter of Blue Ridge, GA - who made this for us one night, and I was so excited to find it online here. After reading the other reviewers comments, I used sharp cheddar, 2 cans of green beans, and 4 oz sour cream. Other than that, I made it according to the recipe. This came out of the oven with a nice taste - and raves from my picky family. Thanks for sharing... For next time, I would probably cook the onion, celery, and green bell pepper, prior to mixing the rest of the casserole together.

This is a family favorite. I use only 1/2 cup of sour cream and for the topping use crushed cheese crackers mixed with a small bag of slivered blanched almonds mixed into the butter. Watch the salt because the cheese crackers are salty. Also use sharp cheese. Enjoy.

This is so yummy!  The only change I make is to use all white corn and no green beans.  I have made this for a few years now at all family events and passed the recipe on to many. Family favorite for sure!

This was pretty good, but the veggie amounts listed in the recipie were a bit sparse.  I nearly doubled them all and added onions and garlic.  I also mixed sliced almonds in to add some texture and used them as the topping.  They added a great crunch (not to mention the health benefits) and browned very nicely.

This is my Green Bean Casserole recipe minus the fresh veggies and add 2 additional cans of green beans.  Sometimes I use Frenchs Fried onions on top instead of Ritz Crackers.

I've been using this recipe for years.  We LOVE it!!!  I usually use 3 cans of shoepeg corn, but sometimes I use two regular sized cans of yellow corn.  I also use a sharper cheese and crushed Cheezit crackers.  It's very easy to make and really yummy!!

This was bland and needed a variety of spices to give it more flavor. Also, all the measurements were off when scaled to 4 servings so that if you were using fresh or frozen vegetables it was hard to compare with canned vegetable measurements. I don't buy anything in a can when the fresh produce section is an aisle away! Still it could be doctored enough to repeat.

I made this for a Sunday dinner.  The corn stayed crispy.  I was very surprised, because I usually don't purchase canned vegetables.  My husband love this recipe and I will make this again.

I got this recipe years ago from the mother of a close friend, and it has been a family favorite ever since.  This is the best recipe, not at all bland; however, I do use sharp cheddar cheese.

Oh my gosh this was delish. I made this last night and I reallllyyyy wish I had some leftovers to eat for lunch. It was creamy and so flavorful. I tweaked the recipe a little bit because i had one big chile in adobo to use up so i cut it up and threw it in. SO good. I made it tangy and zesty. Loved this recipe, will be making it for thanksgiving!!

I would skip the cracker crust & green beans -- it comes out too much like green been casserole. I topped w/cheese & added more corn instead of the green beans. It was very good this way.

This is pretty good. The shoepeg corn stays nice and crispy.  It also makes quite a bit.  I added some cubed ham to the leftovers. Very yummy!  I'll probably put the ham in right away next time I make this.

My family has been making this recipe for years (although we eliminate the chopped celery) ... I've never taken it to a potluck without raves and recipe requests.  For a variation, try substituting diced green chili for the bell pepper (canned is fine). YUM!!

Love this recipe.  Consistently a favorite at potlucks and family gatherings.  I like to put slivered almonds on the top for a little crunchiness.  Full of flavor if you ask me!

This was yummy! I put in some shredded chicken right before I baked it. Perfect one dish meal! Just had some bread on the side... the only thing I might change next time is to use cream of mushroom instead of cream of celery. I'm just not a big fan of celery. :) There was plenty for our family of four and we even had leftovers... and they were better the next day! Will def make this again.

I made this and got great reviews from our guests... I used 2 cans corn and no green beans as I already had green beans on the menu. The topping I used Canned Fried Onions and no butter for a healthier version.

I've made this several times now and while I love the original recipe I also like this with a few alterations.  I saute all the veggies beforehand.  I omit the green beans, increase the bell peppers (using red, orange and yellow for more color) and add mushrooms.  I also add sauteed minced garlic, 1/2 tablespoon Italian herbs, 1/2 cup of Parmesan to the sour cream/soup mixture and a dash of cayenne pepper.

Excellent vegetarian side dish.  I followed others suggestions and used sharp cheese and precooked the veggies before adding.

This was good, but next time I make it I will 'tweak it' a bit. The chopped veggies were still a little too crunchy so I would saute those before mixing with the rest. Use more corn and some seasoning...and a sharp cheddar, it was a tad bland.

Wow!  I needed to make a casserole for work.  This was a fabulous choice.  For the record, I am not a casserole-lover.  I was one of those kids who did not like her foods to touch.  But I took one for the team and offered to make a casserole.  It was a hit at work. It was MOIST, but not runny.  The cracker crust was FABULOUS.  When making it, I did not follow the recipe exactly, because 1) when I sent my hubby to store, he brought back low sodium cream of celery; 2) I only had sharp cheddar, so that's what I used; and I prefer kitchen cut g. beans over french cut (I have issues).  As far as I can tell, none of that matter.  If I had followed the recipe exactly, I can't imagine it being much better. It was one of the few dishes that disappeared immediately at our office potluck.  Thanks for sharing.

This was absolute comfort food. Excellent taste. I added more of the veggies (I bought frozen rather than canned beans/corn) and put both whole packages in. Added some extra soup/sour cream to compensate. Just delicious.

I was really wary of this recipe.  While the ingredients sounded fine, once they were mixed together I thought that I might have to call out for dinner.  I was pleasantly surprised!  It was very yummy and had a lot of awesome veggies.

Good taste but needs some protein like a can of flaked tuna!  I would also add diced green chilies and whole chopped green beans not the french type.  Kind of disappointing for a main dish.

I ate this at a July 4  barbeque over 10 years ago, and now I make it every year!  I think it goes well with summer foods as well.  Thanks for the recipe--I just moved and mine is packed away!

This recipe has been used in my family
for almost 30 Years!It came from my
grandmother and because it looks
a little funny (since everything is
all mixed together with sour cream and
creamed soup) we started calling it,
"UGLY CASSEROLE"! It is a staple for
our family gatherings.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HIT.  I used the bigger can of shoepeg corn, and still it was a little soupy, I'm going to try an extra can of green beans next time.  But, this is definitely a new family favorite!!

Loved it!  I made this yesterday in replace of our traditional corn casserole that I usually make every year.  Wanted to try something different this year and I'm glad I did.  I got lots of complients yesterday.  The only thing different I did was use lowfat sour cream and I doubled the recipe, but only had 1 can of crm of celery.  Still very good.  Wasn't sure what crackers to use so I used Ritz. Yummy!

I've made this recipe for years.  Originally got it from a Mississippi cookbook developed by Southern Bell employees.  The cookbook was called Bell's Best.  This is a must for all of our Thanksgiving and Christmas gatherings.  I double the amount of green beans, then double the entire recipe because everyone loves it so much!  I also add slivered almonds on top, which makes it very pretty and adds a little crunch.

Very nice, tasty, filling dish. Only mod was to saute the onion, celery, green pepper a bit prior to mixing with the rest. Used 1/2 of the sour crean called for.

My taste buds were so happy with this! I sauteed the onion and celery prior to baking since we don't like crunchy onions. Then added some cracked black pepper. Went well with steak and salad. Very good.

I have made this casserole for years. It's one of my most requested recipes. I even had a relative call me years after eating it to ask for the recipe. We have it for all holidays and family gatherings. I use half the amount of sour cream unless I'm doubling the recipe.

I really like it. I made it twice so far. Very creamy. The first time I did it as directed. The second time I added a little more vegetables. Also, I personally do not like celery so I did not add the peices of celery to mine. I love the recipe though. It's very good.

I loved trying this recipe.  It is very good, and something different to try when it comes to vegetable side dishes.  It doesn't have a strong flavor to it, but I enjoyed a mellow creamy and cheesy veggie dish.

This was very good. Used canned French green beans and cream of mushroom soup.  Was a bit too soupy so next time will leave out the sour cream. Didn’t use the crackers.

awesome taste. will be easier to make now that i know it takes 1/4 large onion, 2 stalks celery and 1/4 green pepper instead of cups measurements. i can throw the veggies into the food processor to pulse instead of chopping by hand.

used Cheezit crackers and slivered almonds on top with drizzled butter. It is always loved even by our kids. Just as good reheated as leftover if you have any left!

I need recipes to cook for a shelter:  nutritious, quantity, tasty, affordable.  To this recipe I added shredded pieces of large, cooked half-breast of chicken.  Used 2 cans corn, one of green beans, chopped uncooked onion, green & red pepper (didn't have celery), and additional half-can of mushroom soup (because I had it in 'fridge).  Topped with half pkg. of corn stuffing sautéed in 4 T butter; this  increased  the corn flavor.  My family gave a thumbs-up; it will be our shelter meal this week.

We used frozen instead of canned corn and tasted bread crumbs. It was amazing.

You can make everything but the topping the night before and let it sit in the fridge, then bake it the next day.  Seems to taste better that way.  Also this is one of those recipes that tastes great as a leftover!  Also, I don't like bell pepper so I omit it.  I use the cheese crackers as another person suggested and also add the almonds.

My family will not let me have a holiday meal without making a couple of these veggie casseroles.  Delicious!  And it's even better warmed up!

Followed the recipe closely the first time. In the future, I'll add more shredded cheese, as I LOVE cheese. I'll combine the soup and sour cream in a separate bowl before adding to the main dish. Loved the topping with Ritz crackers but might try it with Panko bread crumbs just for variety.

Huge hit at my Christmas dinner. There was not one piece of corn left in the bowl.  And every wife wanted the recipe. And now that it's easter the dinner host wants me to make this again for our Easter dinner. Yummy

this is great for thanksgiving dinner! I would recommend sauté the veggies for a few minutes before adding it to the casserole. doesn't add any more trouble really, and so worth it.  I also should note that I added 2 cans of corn, and 2 cans of French cut green beans, and didn't really measure the other veggies, just added a whole onion, 3 celery spears. was great

I thought this was delicious.  Unfortunately, my family did not agree!  This makes a lot (or maybe I just felt that way because I was responsible for eating it all) so I would recommend making this for big family dinners or potlucks.

I have used this recipe for years but I have always used cream of chicken and mushroom soup instead of the cream of celery. That is my family's favorite version and its a family staple for our holiday gatherings.

This was a good recipe.  The only change I made was I used 3 cans of corn and 1 can of green beans.  I didn't particularly like the crackers on top so next time I will omit them.

I saute the onions, celery and bell pepper in the butter and then add to the remaining ingredients. I also use the Ritz flip side crackers instead of the cheese crackers. I love this recipe and it can easily be doubled for a large crowd. Heats ups well the next day for left overs.

This recipe was such a hit this Thanksgiving!  The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time around though I actually made a few changes to the recipe.  I used 1 regular size can and 1 small can of shoepeg white corn.  I cut the sour cream back to a 1/2 cup, and used about a little over a cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  I also let it bake in the oven for a full hour.  I am not kidding when I say it was the favorite side dish at the table!

This was very good! I added more cheese than the recipe called for and I used a mixture of cheese because it was what I had on hand. It got multiple compliments, and I will be making it again for Christmas.

This has become a new holiday staple! It is an easy dish to experiment with too based on the likes/dislikes of the eaters. I left out the bell pepper (because it's not a favorite of my family) but you can try out different vegetables. Next time I'm going to give it a bit of spice and use mexican corn, pepperjack cheese and some tomates and green chiles!

I followed the recipe to the T and it was entirely too 'soupy' for me. It really lacked something. It was too runny. Maybe if you added more corn or green beans or even rice or potatoes this would have been bettter. Will not be making again...

I made this at home, and although it was a good base for other experiments, by itself, it was very bland. But this recipe is useful when you want to start with a foundation and then go off doing your own thing. I made it exactly as it said, but to make it better, I topped the entire surface with cheese. Made it a bunch bettter.

Outstanding!  At first, I didn't know what to make of the texture, because the veggies were still a little crispy, but I ended up loving it....and I took it to work the next few days and the flavour just got better and better each time.

I cut the amount of crackers in half and the amount of butter down from 8 Tbs to 3 Tbs. I used cream of chicken soup.  I used garden corn and beans and I liked this very much.  I would have rated it 5 stars if not for the large amount of butter in the original recipe.

I thought this was really tasty, and easy.  It is high in fat, though.  I used saltine crackers and low fat sour cream.
