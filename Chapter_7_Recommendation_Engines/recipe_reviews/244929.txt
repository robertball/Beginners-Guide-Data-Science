I needed a new lemon cheesecake idea, and this one ticks all my boxes!  Just a note for those saying the recipe is wrong because it doesn't tell you to separate the egg yolks from the egg whites... I'm quite certain the cheesecake batter takes 4 WHOLE eggs.  The meringue topping takes 4 OTHER egg whites.  8 eggs total will get cracked.  Wondering how that one reviewer's cake came out that only used the yolks in her batter...

This is a good cheesecake, if somewhat time consuming to make. The cheesecake itself is probably the best part for me, and I might just make the cheesecake portion in the future and leave off the curd and meringue.  (Just a tip--if you make homemade curd, don't use a metal bowl! It will leave the curd with metallic taste---use a glass bowl. No plastic either!) I'm really fond of the fact that this cheesecake wasn't baked with a water bath. It gives it a nicer, denser texture--which I really prefer. I baked the meringue for about 12 minutes, and it was browned, but the middle was still kind of soft. It could of probably baked  a little longer, but I was afraid of the peaks burning. Overall, I would make it again with a few minor changes. It was a learning experience for me lol.

I don't make cheesecakes that often but I have to say this one is near perfect. I love that it didn't need a waterbath too. Mine did take longer to bake and I think I may have jiggled it too much when trying to figure out if it was done and it fell a bit. With the lemon curd and meringue you would never know though ;) I did use a jar lemon curd but in the future I would make my own instead of being lazy. My meringue was perfectly cooked, I took it out at 9-10 minutes. I did have crust issues but, I was attempting a gluten free crust and sometimes cookie crusts can be tricky. In the future I would use my go-to graham cracker crust.

Made the cheesecake twice already, big hit with family and friends. The third one is going to be popped in the oven to bake the meringue in a few minutes. A few changes - used a graham crumb crust, and also find that making the batter in the food processor makes it much smoother than using the hand mixer.  

The lemon curd recipe used the 4 yolks left over from the separated eggs for the meringue,  and it does tend to 'weep' a bit down the sides of the cake after baking the meringue. This time, I've frozen the cheesecake and curd, and will try baking the meringue on the frozen cake.

To make the cheesecake more creamy, make it in a food processor, rather than using a stand mixer/hand mixer.  When the cake cooled, I had a big crack in the top, but that filled in with the homemade lemon curd. I took the springform ring OFF when I did the meringue, and it worked perfectly. Delicious dessert that I will make again.

First time making this cheesecake. I didn’t let the center fully cook. I would leave in the oven another 20 mins then what it says if you follow by book.  When applying the meringue don’t let touch the springform pan rim or else it will cook to it and fall apart when removing the rim. But other than that taste amazing!!! Definitely making it again!!!!

My husband loves Lemon Meringue Pie and Cheesecake so I decided to make this for Father's Day.
I used the egg yolks from the meringue to make the lemon curd, I used Microwave Lemon Curd from AR. I used less lemon curd then called for because it becomes drippy, especially when the meringue is browning in the oven.
For me the baking time was 90 minutes with a water bath placed underneath, then I turned the oven off and let it sit for another hour.
Delicious and looks spectacular!

Light and tangy in a perfect mix. Note: don't take a shortcut and use packaged 'egg whites' for the meringue. A day later and the meringue has disintegrated about 50% Everything else is PERFECT!

I followed the directions exactly.  I refrigerated it overnight as suggested and that was a big mistake.  We found it a little too sweet for our liking.  It was pretty to begin with but refrigerated overnight took its toll.

Very easy recipe. Made the cheesecake the day before. Made the lemon curd and put it together the next day with meringue on top. Let it chill for a bit before serving. It’s a very light cheesecake and the lemon curd makes it. I did put a pice of  wax paper between the bottom pan and crust to make sure it wouldn’t stick. A nice touch would be to add some candied lemon slices when you plate it.

I haven't made it yet, but just wanted to point out, the reason some of the lemon is runny on cheesecake, is that your lemon filling was not cooked long enough. My mother taught me this and she made the best lemon pies.

Not for the new cooks.  It is a gorgeous cake but lots of time and some difficulty.  The hardest part was when the cake was in the oven browning the meringue.  You have to remove the sides of the springform pan in order to spread the curd and meringue; therefore there is nothing to grab onto (not to mention the sliding of the bottom cake pan) when inserting into and removing from the hot oven.  It took my husband and myself with lots of almost swearing to achieve this trick.  The curd does drip down the sides as well so you are working with hot sugar.  Yikes!

I made this recipe to bring to a party.  It was phenomenal!  I made my own lemon curd.   To make the recipe gluten free I used Scharr's gluten free shortbread cookies.  If you use them you will need to double the amount of melted butter in the crust.

Super recipe that is sure to impress your guests. So delicious.  For some reason I pushed the Graham cracker base up the sides as well and it worked out well.  I made the lemon curd from another recipe on Allrecipe website and used the egg yolks from the meringue.

First two times I made this it is fabulous, like two favorites in one!  The third time I tried using parchment paper (as the tip suggests) to line the spring pan and it was a disaster, the middle did not fully cook.  The parchmenthindered the temperature.

Excellent. Dense heavy  New York style cheesecake. Will make again. Would have been a 5 but I didn't try the lemon curd part. Per one review they had drippy curd.. Instead I made the filling to my fave lemon meringue pie. Everything else worked out great. Guests loved it and so did I

The cheesecake turned out wonderful. I did use the Graham cracker crust instead of cookies to cut back some of the sweetness. I used lemon curd from jar- that was terrible. It never set and oozed out like syrup when I cu the cake. I will try again making my own lemon curd.

Made for my daughters 20th birthday. She loved it!!!! Creamy nice lemon flavor. I used jello lemon pudding that you cook, instead of the lemon curd.. it was great. I also used Nilla wafers for the crust. I baked it at 350 for 10 min first, before adding cheese cake filling and baking..

I followed the recipe pretty much dead on except i substituted monk fruit for half of the sugar in the cheesecake itself and i took a tip from another review i read and put the  already chilled cake in the freezer for  a few hours before adding the lemon curd and meringue then put it back in the oven. It seemed to work great and i was so pleased with the results! This cake was perfection and i am not a highly skilled baker! will definitely be making it again! Also the cheesecake even without the toppings was one of the best i’ve ever had and will be my new go to cheesecake recipe!!

Excellent cheesecake with a pie like this. I made a Ritz cracker crust on mine and the Microwave Lemon Curd recipes on this site for the curd. It turned out beautifully and a guy that I know declared it was the best he’d ever eaten.

I love lemon meringue pie. But THIS cheesecake knocks it out the park. My family, friends and co-workers love it. I add twice as much lemon juice because I like it tangy. Definitely a hit.

I followed directions as stated. It turned out beautiful and it was tasty. However, after few bites it had too strong of a lemon flavor. I will make again but will reduce lemon curd to a very small amount or make cheesecake plain and go with the curd...

I only added 1/4 to 1/3 cup more crumbs for the crust because I had them to use up.  I did bake the cheesecake an hour and 20 minutes to be sure it was set, and was concerned that the top of it rose so high.  But as soon as it started to cool, it dropped in height and made a slight concave area in the top which held the lemon curd nicely.  I had put a cookie sheet under the springform pan and was glad I did because some oil leached out from the bottom (the butter in the crumbs, I guess).  Not sure why this happened but the cake itself and the taste were not negatively affected.  Made this for my mom's birthday and it was very well liked.  Would definitely make again.

This cake is so yummy! I had to find a recipe for the lemon curd on this site, since I’ve never made it before. I found an easy microwave version that worked well. My husband and I ate the whole thing in 2 days. Made it exactly as written. Making it again tomorrow. Love it!

I had half the ingredients so as to bake a 6-inch cake instead. Everything is great, just that I personally felt that the lemon taste is a little too much. Will try to reduce the lemon in both the cake and the curd next round.

This tasted amazing. Next time however I will get a cooking torch to brown the  meringue .  The curd had a harder time re setting back up and ran down the side of the cake. The meringue I chose one that you cook the sugar and water on the stove and added to the egg mixture which helps to cook the egg whites.  You add the hot mixture extremely slow to the eggs as to not get scrambled eggs. Everyone really loved this cheese  cake

I made this for Easter and today (Mother's Day) and it turned out great both times. I made the crust a little thicker the second time around, but I wouldn't mess with it otherwise. Super creamy and just enough lemon.

AMAZING!  I made this for Easter and it was a big hit.  I found it easy to make, just takes some time. I’d never made meringue before, and it turned out great.

wow.  my whole family declared this a "prize winning" cheesecake worthy of a competition.  If you want to do some of the work ahead of time, make the cheesecake a day before.  Then a few hours before serving, make the meringue.   You can't apparently cover over meringue and put it in the fridge or it will sort of melt.  So I did the meringue a few hours for the holiday and put it in the fridge uncovered.  perfect.  keep an eye on the meringue, mine got a little too dark.  once it starts to cook it really browns fast.

I made this precisely by the recipe for Easter dinner (4/21/19).  It was phenomenal!  My husband had it for breakfast and lunch today.

The only problem I had was the shortbread crust sticking to the bottom of the springform pan, so it didn't look  very pretty on the plate.  Didn't affect the flavor at all!  I'll prebake it next time -- yes there definitely will be many next times!

The flavor of the cheesecake was outstanding. I made my own lemon curd to go on top. The directions were not clear on whether or not to leave the ring on the springform pan when baking the meringue. It was impossible to seal the meringue to the edges with the ring on because if it touched, it would pull off  when the ring was removed.  There was some weeping of the meringue because of this.

Followed recipe and it turned out great. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the curd was a little bitter. The next time I will use filling from Grandma's Lemon Merengue Pie.

LOVED it!  I brought it to friends house for Superbowl Sunday...  what a hit!  They are good cooks and they thought this was excellent!  I did make it that day so it didn't chill as much but it actually tasted more like a gourmet treat somewhat warmer.  Thank you so much!  I love to cook but not always the most experienced baker so I'm so proud of this cake!

Yes, it is rich and creamy. I didn’t have those shortbread cookies, so I substituted vanilla cookies for the bottom crust.  It tasted fine.  I thing i would have added a bit more of the lemon to flavor the cheesecake part.  It would only be my preference, because I like lemon flavors.  It tastes as good as it looks, but be patient, because it takes time to get to the end of the recipe.

This one best cheesecake I ever tasted! The only problem I had is when you take it out of the oven & it starts to cool it cracks right in the middle. I just cover it with the lemon curd. The other thing I changed instead of meringue I made a whipped cream topping because you can't freeze meringue.  Good recipe!

Amazing!

I love lemon, and this hits the spot. This was first time making an actual cheesecake (previously I've done cupcakes), meringue, and lemon curd. the meringue is definitely tricky, but I think that's baker's error.

I made this for a large family celebration, I should have made two! I did swap the sour cream for nonfat greek yogurt and I used low fat Philadelphia cream cheese for a lighter feel and no one even noticed. I call that success!!

I made this for my family's Easter Dinner.  Got lots of compliments!

I am not a fan of lemon zest, so I used Goodman's Natural Lemon Flavor instead.  I just think zest ends up bitter and leaves little pieces in your finished product that I don't care for. 

I thought it was good - but the cheesecake was not as creamy as I like.  It was dense, like a cheesecake should be, but just not creamy enough.  I'm not an expert on making cheesecakes, so I'm going to have to play around to get it creamier. Maybe more cream cheese in the recipe?  Maybe just egg yolks instead of full egg?  Some of the more expert chefs here can give some clues! 

I'll keep this and just try to tweak it to my own personal preferences.

Thank you for sharing!  It came out beautifully!  My cook time was closer to 1 hr and 20 mins until set.  It settles a little in the middle leaving a perfect indent to fill with the lemon curd.  I made my lemon curd by using the filling recipe from "Grandma's Lemon Meringue Pie" because I consider that to be the perfect sweet/tart combo.
