This was a great lunch! Really smart. I actually used those pre-sliced "carrot chips" and kind of goosed up my canned tuna with a couple chopped dill pickles, a little garlic power/onion powder and a little spicy brown mustard. Of course my littlest wouldn't eat it but my oldest and I had a great lunch! Thanks for the great idea.

This is a great idea! I added pepper and instead of all mayo, used a combo of mayo and dijon mustard to add the the tuna.

My carrots weren't really fat enough so I cut it length wise and arranged them around the bowl with the tuna as a dip. I'm always on the lookout for substitute for gluten products. This is great to use instead of crackers, it's tasty AND healthy too!

These were great! I am watching my weight at the moment, so I loved these. I added a dash of soy sauce as someone suggested and I also sprinkled some garlic & chilli mix in. The tuna I used had tomato and onion in it. The best thing about a recipe like this is that you can experiment with different tuna flavours! Thanks!

Easy and delicious.  I threw some onion and celery into the food processor along with tuna & mayo.  I dusted with some dried dill before serving.

Great idea!! I've used cucumber slices before, but the carrot is much sturdier - and has a nicer crunch. These are so delicious and addictive!

There wasn't enough mayonnaise and there was WAY too much green onion. Won't make this again.

This is a good idea, but I found that this recipe is very bland when followed exactly. I jazzed mine up with some salsa and other spices. Thanks for the unique idea of using carrots instead of crackers!

What a creative, versatile alternative to customary carbohydrate bases like crackers or bread rounds!  This recipe is SO easy to customize, too: cucumber or zucchini or yellow squash rounds for the base, beef or chicken or egg or chickpea [etc., etc.] salad for the topping...5 stars for creativity alone!  Thanks, Nikki ~ I'm too-often challenged in coming up with new ideas for things.  You obviously have no problems in that department!  (c;
