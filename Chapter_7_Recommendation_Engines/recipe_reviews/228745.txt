Started out a written except for the fact that four bunches of green onions has got to be a typo. I love me some green onions but have to think this was supposed to be 4 onions and not 4 bunches. With that being said, why limit yourself to just broccoli when they make the frozen stir-fry blend? That is what I used which gave me variety and also a lot more color. Great recipe for times when you just don't have time in the kitchen.

This dish can be adjusted using any vegetables and still come out great.  I didn't have any red peppers but substituted carrots and used fresh parsley from the garden.   I loved that it was fast and easy and so very tasty, perfect for a busy day.

My family really loved this quick and easy meal! However, I did have to make some minor changes. As another reviewer suggested, I added both seasoning packets. I used half of a large Vidalia onion rather than green onion, simply because I don't keep green onion handy. In the last step, I put the lid on the stir-fry to retain the water, but still had to add about 1/3 cup water every 3 min until the broccoli was cooked. I did use fresh broccoli, so frozen might create extra water. It was very good and anyone who prefers more soy sauce added it at the table.

Quick and easy to make. Perfect for a busy weeknight meal. Left out the onion and used mini sweet pepper strips. Yum!
